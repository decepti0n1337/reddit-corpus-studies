Holy shit! My head exploded after reading this translation. Is it translated by triglavian translator?
---
---
---
wouldnt it be CNTZ? since CH is Switzerland
---
Does it actually work? I've heard some things about Great Firewall of China, but does it work like that? Doesn't VPN prevent it
---

---
TBH, if I were them, I would fear more about chat log files, and screening of such.
---
Also, I doubt that interacting with people of people who may express negative views on Chinese government won't tank their Social Credit score.
---
They will be starting fresh with fresh toons. No assets will be imported across. This is purely a large alliance deciding to move their activities to TQ.
---
sounds like a recipe
---
Hong Kong is a special example because it used to be a British colony. Even to date people use English words in their daily speech; for example, they will say something along are lines of "are you **pro**?" With the "pro" being rendered in English instead of Cantonese.
---
In (mainland) Chinese some of those slangs are similar/easy to understand. Barghest is a ping di guo --- a frying pan. Abaddon is ABD, and Orca is the xiao Jing yu - small whale, while Rorqual is the da Jing yu - large whale. Some are quite weird though, Proteus is Harley because it looks like a motorcycle, and sometimes people call Iteron V a da bao jian --- "big treasure sword" or, more directly, a penis. Or people just call it long wu --- dragon five because the "Ron" part of the word sounds like "dragon".
---
The difference in yhis case is that the Chinese literally *did* kill their server.
---
Before I would have said there was no chance in hell the tourney wouldn't get interrupted by someone... but hey, nowadays that seems more likely than CCP giving a fuck.
---
IDK, i didn't see anyone else doing it so I just ran it through the tools I found.
---
Translation of the graph for those interested - Starting from top left corner to bottom left corner, top right to bottom right corner. Think of this as a rough translation of the "outline" of a meeting.
---
Items I find interesting will be highlighted in bold. If someone can give me the entire recording I can try to be autistic enough to translate garbled mandarin.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Changing (our) mindsets:
---
1) Going OF (I assume it means "international server") is the same as pioneering (Attempting to kill the new boss in WOW/ getting shit on by said boss and dying non-stop - Try til you succeed)
---
2) **There will be obviously be a big disparity in strength**
---
3) **Don't even think about owning 0.0 space right off the bat**
---
4) When we move to International Server, bury the hatchet regardless of when and where it occurred
---
Meeting begins:
---
1) Picking our home
---
2) Alliance management
---
3) Forming our alliance
---
4) Investigate the nature of the international server
---
**5) No decision on who to join YET, will decide and announce later**
---
6) Approximately a fortnight on this
---
Moving In:
---
1) Initial Chaos is unavoidable
---
2) Set up in low sec initially, conduct activity near Jita
---
3) Basic skills (Fitting/ etc) first
---
4) Do not recommend using large amount of brain goop (I assume this means Injectors, but a more literal translation would also mean "Dont think too much about it all")
---
Early Stages:
---
1) Alliance benefits suspended (Prob things like SRP)
---
2) No SRP - Replace your own losses
---
3) No hard time frame for move to 0.0
---
The alliance is established:
---
1) **Alliance: "The Army of Mango Alliance"**
---
2) **Corp: "The Army of Mangoes"**
---
3) **Will welcome international corps/ members in the future**
---
4) **Army of Mango is intended to be the "Core" fighting force - Welcomes vets from Serenity/ Foreigners**
---
5) We are not an indy corp - combat remains our primary focus
---
6) **NO RECALL OF ARMY OF MANGO MEMBERS WHO ARE ALREADY IN EXISTING ALLIANCE** \- (My interpretation is people who split into international server prior to PIBG's official forming can sit in their corp. Passive spais)
---
7) **International server is now our MAIN EFFORT - Serenity doesn't require as much**
---
Oww, that will hurt. I got Venture mining flashbacks.
---
They just create new accounts. Although they want to drop their titans to TQ but it's impossible.
---
There is an example from the book that works perfectly here. Alliances used to make proper declarations of war on the forums in a more RP type of fashion. This doesn't really happen anymore and it gets called out in the book.
---
We all had to start somewhere
---
yes
---
Da
---
Sure thing bud.
---
honestly youre going to hit at least a bil/hour with just 1 dread it doesnt really matter lol. your alt would be better used as a scanner/roller/picket and sit on a crit hole
---
yes ,but no.  they can not subscribe game from official website without dual-currency card , but they can subscribe from steam. There is a way to bind the EVE account with the steam account and charge the game time.
---
My tactic is always to leave those shitty cans because I know the frustrated explorer following me is clearing them for me.
---
&gt;NO RECALL OF ARMY OF MANGO MEMBERS WHO ARE ALREADY IN EXISTING ALLIANCE - (My interpretation is people who split into international server prior to PIBG's official forming can sit in their corp. Passive spais)
---
mass chinese player purge coming?
---
i asked myself the same question back in 2014, and so far the answer seems to be yes. Really, just jump in and join any of the numerous newbie alliances: horde, brave newbies, dreddit, karma fleet, EVE University, etc. The only one of these that really differ is EVE University, the other ones are pretty similar, so just do some research in that aspect. Definitively dont stay in npc corp for too long, it will get boring without fleets and people to play with. The game is hardcore, but its actually relatively easy to get into, it aint no dwarf fortress. And i doubt it will die any time soon, it has been chugging along just fine for the last decade and a half or so.
---
sure, they can all bot, but it's not easy to bot pvp ships and whatever happens goons have more than enough players and hardware to almost definitely win or at least put up an impressive, lengthy fight. 
---
if you want content as a goon, this is objectively a good thing for you
---
Hes had a rough April...
---
A brush means a krab. Not sure about fish --- I haven't played in Chinese corps for years
---
Just a heads up, Eve isn't a game that will just give you something awarding. Its a vast and open sandbox and like real life the enjoyment you will get from this game is what you make of it. Don't just expect it from nothing. Be brave and daring, join an active friendly corp and go shoot other players.
---
I hate you...
---
To be clear, its what killed the ship
---
And also it took place on a gate, so its not a explo thing
---
they're called goons
---
It used to be completely taboo to stay in a belt that someone else was mining in high sec. Like it was viewed as okay for another miner to suicide gank someone over. This started changing when the venture was released. The main driver of the shift was mining barges and exhumers got their ore holds. It has basically died out now.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
Then people could log out to escape campers waiting on their trace, or even open a filament as an escape from people chasing them.
---
Mittani should have just had you right his book.
---
Serenity
---
If I were rich I would shovel money at him to do audio book reads.
---
Its your guys' own fault for actually believing things CCP says.  How many times do they have to fail before people get the hint?  People give them a free pass on everything.
---
Its drone rats. Thats just how they show up for whatever pos code reasoning
---
Wow, if the Chinese hold true to the talking points about not supporting rmt/botting or ultranationalism, they might be like the better version of eve russians.
---
you had 350 off a rage ping...
---
So.  the rumor is true.  Mango has a very professional propaganda machine or media centre as strong as goons. 
---
Amazing, how efficient the management team is!
---
The meeting summary comes out so fast.  even with an English version and a mind map.
---
man Russia is big, and I'm from Canada...
---
Arranged tournament """"PVP""" faggotry quite literally has nothing to do with the hardcore openworld sandbox EVE is supposed to be, dumbo.
---
remote shield booster - "leika" - watering can :)
---
\- Cloaky Camper - lampochka - a lightbulb 
---
no "lampochka", comrade, just short "lampa" (same meaning)
---
\- Plex (in FW for example) - yolka - a spruce 
---
some of us call this "vilka" - a fork
---
Other Miscellaneous :
---
1) **We do not understand the botting trends in Tranq**
---
2) **We are not here to print Isk (The wording is closer to "gold farming" on industrial scale)**
---
3) **We will not habour/ tolerate/ protect botters**
---
4) **We will not RMT**
---
5) It is important to learn a foreign language
---
6) Tranquility has Chinese patch, CCPlease does not ban
---
7) **No comment on our stance on other Chinese groups**
---
8) **No comment on our stance on other Tranq alliances**
---
9) What do we do about 辱華 (Insulting Chinese Race) situations - "We argue back if we want, but our focus is still developing our capabilities
---
10) CCP or Netease is unexpected to take action against us
---
11) **CCP is unlikely to region lock China due to no precedents**
---
12) No plans for foreign language training, might have it for leadership though
---
13) Army of Mango discussion group open to all
---
14) **If you want to jump ship to AOM, you can either take everything with you now or wait til a good time**
---
15) **We plan on shrinking our sov in Serenity, but continue to use current YY channels**
---
Can you shed some light on why they respond negatively to being called a pancake.
---
there was a phobos cloaked 700km below and an onyx cloaked 200km in line with the fort. that's a shit excuse.
---
Yeah Nighthawk is super turbo garbage and is essentially unuseable. The sad part is that it's been shit for like 10 years.
---
Now wait until you figure out that EVE had been wasting your time for years and that all of a sudden you’ve got loads of time on your hands.
---
Yes
---
if you're someone who wants to know everything and see the different cool things you can do:
---
https://english.eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg
---
anyway, china's invading with lots of low sp players, so great time to join the party
---
Ahahahaha nope
---
You have been listening to too much Armchair lawyer shit. 
---
Announcing that someone has been terminated for violation of a contractual agreement is not libel and even if it was he is a public figure and thus is required to prove CCP acted soley out of malicious intent.
---
In this case (and in many others in the list) I'm quite certain that the actual meaning is completely unimportant. It's just that the word "zhaba" sounds kinda like "jammer", especially when spoken fast over comms.
---
Are you unaware of Dotlan?
---
More to the point, how in the hell do you think Jita is "well connected"?  It's in the middle of two pockets in The Forge.  How about starting with any of the systems you have to go through to get to any of the other trade hubs?  Perhaps 1/3rd of the systems in The Citadel that are closer to everywhere else?
---
Any decision that discriminates based on race, which is what you are doing, is racist. I am not saying CCP is racist. I am saying YOU are a racist. That is all. Have a nice day, I consider this discussion complete.
---
Make mass battleships counter mass titans.
---
*BREAKING*  
---
    SNUFF TO REJOIN IMPERIUM! NEWS AT 10.

I lived there for 8 years, that firewall is 100% real. VPN will get you around it some, but you don't need a VPN to play Eve in China.
---
A few differences in from that AAR BTW, the Autism Nations dudes were genuinely autistic and warped into us at 0, hence why we got a short range advantage as we couldn't close on them previously due to P I R A T's sphere of protection, we lost shit to P I R A T due to bumping Machs sending dudes into their range which was a good call by them, we were fighting outnumbered and out shipped and after the timer was "complete" we pushed Autism nation off the wreak because they were loosing Nestors. From there we had Pirat Gekos inbound the other parties had warped off, P I R A T were the only ones that Could fight us properly, the rest of them were short range fit and coming to us would bring them into range of us enough we could close the damage gap and fight them without the P I R A T Rattlesnakes range needing to be a worry, hence they left grid. All that was left was pirat who had the same number of basis as we had eagles which didn't look like very much fun.
---
According to the man himself, he was FC but was busy with other stuff, so another FC was calling targets. The targets being called were too far away and the HACs had to swap to longer range ammo, when there were perfectly good targets right next to them.
---
I'm assuming that the secondary FC calling targets thought that they did not have enough tracking to shoot that close but he wasn't aware that armor HACs is a close-range doctrine.
---
Have you ever done anything in history or anthropology (which is more what OP's question sounds like to me) for an actual higher ed program? This is how you get started. You go to the people who actually know what you need to know, poll a crap load of them to get a good mix of ideas, look at the answers and pick a direction you want to explore. The digging deeper or "genuine research" only comes after a question like this gets asked. Otherwise you are fumbling in the dark and never find your flashlight, let alone the light switch.
---
))
---
Well... the guy has spunk, I'll give him that
---
Now is the best time to jump into EVE! We just got a bunch of subcapital (smaller, easier to fly ships) buffs. A lot of people are out killing ships that are worth quite a bit more than theirs. 
---
As a member of Dreddit, I should probably let you know that [Dreddit is recruiting](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/). We're a super fun nullsec corp and we are part of one of the biggest sovereignty (basically we own our own space) holding alliances in EVE. We also have a fantastic mentorship program where we will pair you up with someone who shares your interests but has been playing a lot longer so they can guide you on what to do. 
---
If you have any questions, feel free to message me here, ingame (Aimsucks) or check out our Discord via the link above.
---
You know what they say about assuming...
---
....and how is the mathematics for those that want to buy PLEX to sell for ISK vs. buying PLEX directly from CCP?
---
Big bad bastad botty mc botty boy bot
---
But will you offer a full and frank apology for any mistakes you are responsible for?
---
Do the shield and armor resist skills affect damage control units, or just the damage-specific passive resistance modules?
---
Could we get a download link of this?
---
Sat in KF chat for months, never was contacted by a recruiter...
---
was very active also.
---
Why is it to so cancer to join?
---
or give us t2 and t3 titans
---
that way we can go back to our first alliance t2 titan being a huge deal
---
PayPal is a good thing which is accepted by CCP.  It recognize almost every Chinese bank card. 
---
Steam is more convenient because it accepts Ali Pay. a totally Chinese E-payment. 
---
I don't think there will be any payment difficulties if you want to give money to someone. lol
---
I feel if you can't figure out setting safety to green in HS you probably don't deserve to have a ship.
---
Korean MMO 101 , no spend if not 50x return.
---
People generally have to plan ahead on these things.  You can't just "MAYBE it'll happen this day instead..." and expect it to be competitive when half of the team members can't show up.
---
LOL yeah right.  They won't be at a discount.
---
Nope
---
Look at the newest rooks and kings video
---
Six billion year old light? It might not even be there any longer.

This might just be the coolest reddit post ever made. I'm not joking.

lol your welcome to try and sort me the cyno's next time ;p
---
lord 'few against many' maldoror gives us a glimpse of the high-risk, asymmetric tactics he used to lift the simple folk of serenity out of the dirt while on his space gap year. no doubt he is even better at the game for having witnessed the quiet spiritual dignity of these simple folk in 8k
---
Yesterday? Or in the past?
---
Why even go to hs in the first place
---
Blue them up too.
---
\&gt;Chinese
---
\&gt;mongol horde
---
Pick one.
---
Curious to ask because your English is great: how/when did you learn English, and how would you compare the two in terms of grammar and such. Language fasinates me and I've dabbled in learning Russian and may jump back into it.
---
What is the backstory on why Yulai lost its good connection  gates?
---
it is not for everyone, but if you put even a little effort into it it's extremely fun
---
Ah yes, says the guy leading TQs charge in to Serenity like situation.
---
300 mil plexes when I started.
---
I didn't learn to do wormholes correctly until they were 700mil.
---
Right, glad you have a good understanding of the definition.  I've yet to advocate for that. If ccp banned all vpn's to prevent an influx of a region where the majority of Eve online players are proven cheaters....they wouldn't be racist either. So you've got the definition right. Maybe you can work out how you're still wrong for calling me a racist now that the discussion is over little buddy.
---
So... Reading back through the thread;
---
&gt; you shouldn't have to have structures to wardec
---
&gt; they ARE the risk
---
&gt; they are the risk of owning a structure in highsec  
---
&gt; they don't have to have arbitrary risks imposed on them for BEING the risk itself
---
But you agree there is no unfair risk imposed upon wardeccers. I'm confused now.
---
Would you like the city chicken or city beef?
---
Just pet it happen
---
Does it help if you realize I just fly that flair to make gin of Init?
---
When they first were around they were called ETC (not GTC) and you could buy a 1 year one for 200m :P
---
200m was a lot more than it is today though :| EvE isk has crazy inflated over the years.
---
Fool me once...
---
the botting argument is getting so old by this point. welcome the change and it will embrace you, stand against it and you may be crushed.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty
---
It's as good of a time as any. And if you're prone to rage and frustration, please make it public.
---
You used a weapon with bad application.
---
Your skills to improve that application are probably not good.
---
Your filament's weather increases the enemy's velocity which reduces the applied damage they take.
---
You are shooting at a target smaller than you.
---
Your cruiser level is low and lowered your DPS.
---
Your missile damage skills are low and lowered your DPS.
---
So you were quadruple-fucked by application and twice-fucked by DPS, which means your applied damage is god-awful.
---
First, get any relevant skills to 3, it's a super quick train. Second, I recommend you use Rapid Light Missile Launchers, because they are based on your frigate Light Missile skills which you probably have fairly trained and they'll apply better. Third, read up on abyssal weather effects to know how to adapt your ship's defense and offense. Fourth, do Electrical filaments; their weathers are the easiest to manage.
---
Seems you can't buy braincells with isk.
---
Flying Merlin is more fun than carrier tbh.
---
&gt;Blockade Runner - blokadnik - word used primarily for survivors of siege of Leningrad
---
This is pretty epic.
---
He's not wrong.
---
No, but youre confidently asserting that I do
---
even better make T2 and t3 limited quality. Only so many can exist like the Paladin Keepstar.
---
OGN was founded in 2000, now unless you can cite some older source 2000 is after 1997.
---
Personally, I'd recommend against Suitonia's fit because it requires manual piloting, and I'd recommend Electrical over Gamma because the NPCs get no benefit out of the capacitor bonus and chances are strong that a new player will not have cap skills and benefit greatly from the bonus.
---
Neutron stars tend to be very stable. Its probably still there
---
saying something shouldn't exist doesn't mean it does
---
beep bep
---
Why not. Lot of players come and go with breaks and have to get reaquainted with the game. As well a fair amount of new people as well.
---
Flying smaller ships for fun, hell yeah.
---
Making money in small ships, not so much.
---
I highly doubt they will fly small stuff because it's fun. Everybody wants to helicopter dick everyone else with their big toys. So they would have to get big, that requires crabing their way up there.
---
Cheating was unrionically a thing in early ATs, it's not just a meme.
---
Kinda looks like a Gallente stargate.  
---
Trig null sec on it's way?
---
To be clear, that is the part you blurred out.
---
Lmfao, what RMT prices are you looking at? It is still cheaper to get RMT isk vs Legal RMT isk
---
I wanted to make that joke... but in reality it was crappy cold coffee 😞
---
Hahaha
---
They'll be blue to goons, at least at the outset.
---
Capturing 8k lossless can be a bit of a pain because it's beyond the reach of Shadowplay and Fraps. OBS can do it with some fiddling and Blackmagic and companies like that offer dedicated 8k capture cards. 
---
I make extra work for myself because I like to have it lossless (although this particular scene won't likely be in the next RnK video; different theme there) and 8k/60fps/lossless does need some fiddling - I could make a guide sometime. 
---
It also needs a fast ssd/raid (at least a 970Pro) to keep up with the file.
---
But in the end it's simply game footage, just bigger.
---
Cultural terrorist.
---
I'd probably do r/gonewildaudio for free.
---
Regardless, it's not being cancelled. People need to take a chill pill before jumping to conclusions. If CCP charged an ahead with a buggy tool anyway, the same people will be bashing CCP for running a shit event. In fact... People will always bash CCP at every opportunity.
---
At first I thought it said "The Army of Mangoo".  Upon reading it correctly, I was disappoint.
---
Honestly we should just watch and see. 
---
Do they bot hard like most of the people who moved over? Do they bring some fresh air and go in? Do they want the challenge of not having to bot?
---
Its definitetly something to watch
---
Lmao, what are you trying to say here? The Yuan (like the Qing) were a foreign culture that ruled China through military force, and abruptly imploded afterwards. Unlike the Qing, Yuan officials were largely drawn from the Chinese bureaucracy, but the Yuan ruling class was Mongolian first and foremost. 
---
This akin to saying that Greeks = Turks since they were held under force by the Ottomans for hundreds of years, or that Poles = Germans/Russians in much the same way. In fact, the Yuan dynasty's armies were fucking separated between Mongol and Chinese ranks.
---
They made that change because it used to be very easy to steal excavator mining drones.  I can remember flying my dominix and they would stop responding at 50-100 km past my maximum control range (I forget exactly how far).  If you move outside of your pilot's control range (MJD or on-grid warp) you could still recall them.  However, if you got outside that buffer (again, it used to be relatively short) they would stop responding completely.
---
Why did you blur it out then?
---
Do you not need a VPN to play on Tranquility in China?
---
" CCP will probably develop something like that if they haven't "  
---
I think that was called the Serenity server :thinking:
---
Are you calling them a "pancake" in English or with Google Translate? Either way, Russian word for "pancake" is "blin" which also kinda means "damn" in slang
---
[You realize the earliest of these events are exactly what he is talking about and were in the US?](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/1999_PGL_Season_4)
---
&gt; how can adding thousands of bot masters and cheaters with extreme in-group preference possibly be good for anyone else
---
this is the game that housed the dronelands in such a position for how many years now? stop treating this as if it was the end of the world or some shit. Will they end up as turbokrab goons? probably, but if anything the game needs more players. This whole fucking moral panic has to stop
---
Rubal sure sounds a lot like ruble. Let's not rule out Russian interference.
---
Possibly not, we're about to be flooded with chinese bots and players.
---
Yes, it sounds like a jammer, and also has a meaning of a bad person that would deny you something out of greed/spite. In this case, the toad is denying you the cyno generation. I am sure it stuck around for both reasons
---
You're acting like it was an impossible save. It was 7 rorqs, who panicked about 3 minutes apart. Most of them tanked for a few minutes, too. If you can't form a subcap defense fleet and chase us off in the ~20-30 minutes we were on grid, then the problem isn't your cynos
---
Resistance is futile
---
Elder scrolls, reddit. Whats the difference?
---
I don't know about you but when people start cancelling holiday plans for a game, that just sounds unhealthy. 
---
But this is the game where people aren't shamed for calling in sick to work so they can sit in a 12-hour long fight, so I'm not surprised the attitude being shown here.
---
Well, nobody accused Horde of being smart.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Provide token support, enough to look ~ok~ for a while, let allies fail, widot. Test SoP.
---
In order to join KF, you need to apply on the website. Nobody will invite you ingame

TEST SOP has been to provide token support to allies, just enough to get by, and then widot after they fail.

They are the defending champs so maybe super capital isn't so out of place.

Test has a clear sup cap superiority, stop playing the victim card like it was 3-5 years ago. You're the 2nd fucking strong entity by a long shot, stop crying.
---
Bullshit, the most important part was mentioned. Steamed. Bread.
---
They weren't accepting website apps for the longest time.
---
You sure they are now? Last time I was in their pub chat it said just to hang out and be active. Also said in-game and website apps weren't being accepted.
---
wtf toxic
---
Seeing more shit like this is just making me lean more and more towards finally winning EVE, the Chinese migrants to TQ will likely be the deciding factor. 
---
&gt;please don't fuck our economy more than it already is
---
TEST SoP has always been to provide some level of token support, enough to say "well, we did try guys".
---
No.
---
I'm all hype for it, with the decline of NCPL over the last few years, The imperium really need an arch-enemy, I hope they will fill that spot
---
Yeah, only get the main cache, very rarely I will pick up a convenient secondary cache if it's a bs spawn and nearby or something, but it's never a priority.
---
+1 for Karmafleet. Obviously would ask you to check out Brave Newbies as well, but Karmafleet are good dudes :)
---
I once lost a hulk against drone rats, I was pretty bitter and made a ticket with a screenshot of the br "Look I get one shot by "rats" and yet they don't show on killmail, srp  please" believe it or not, I had my hulk SRP by CCP xD

Only in Jita

I hope this makes Eve great again.

Well, "PIE, inc" the main corp in the alliance, is the oldest active corp in the game. I think it was just a meme when it started and they backronymed it when it was decided to be an Amarr RP corp.
---
It's done quite a lot. We've been mentioned in a bunch of lore news articles, knighted by Empress Catiz I recently, It was the founding corp of CVA and a disgruntled former member leads/led Triumvirate. Amarr Victor.
---
let me break down something for you, take a seat for it may shock you.
---
all conflitcs are meaningless, everything can be easily replaced and nothing is hardcore anymore unless you choose it to be(and suffer as a consequence)
---
and if we're to eschew arranged pvp from the game say bye bye to 90% of fights, unless you're one of those "bluetral" and "shades of grey" guys

My best guess is that we are looking at a killmail.

It is useful for finding where items are if you have a lot of alts.
---
I think the current meta is nestors.
---
idk if it would help or related, but I run eve on linux through steam play, probably one of your best bets. And you don't have to have signed up through steam, I login with my standard accounts just fine.
---
The chance would still exist, but that certainly doesn't answer how anyone knows whether or not an investigation took place.
---
Wow look it is a terrible hunter that wants ganking made easier.
---
Htfu and get good.
---
*Hawkeye used harden*
---
  
---
It's not very effective.
---
&gt; The most common misconception in EVE is that CODE doesn't actually honor permits, which we do. We have a database with over 800 active permits in it.
---
They may technically honor the permits, but operate under a logic that would make the Spanish Inquisition proud: *"...if we were able to kill you, then obviously you were bot-aspirant..."*
---
The couple of evictus guys shooting my machariel and going criminal/dying to concord was pretty funny to watch

Saying Chinese are a scourge on most games they aren't region locked out of is not racist, it is just a fact lol.

No BOT and RMT (cry in NC)

Just be careful that you don't piss them off, lest they say you broke some rule, drag your name thru the mud and ban you.
---
So they should be happy CCP continuously fucks them over? 
---
WOW THANKS ccp for taking a collective shit in everyone’s mouth. Real top notch lads they are.
---
FW is a tolerable source of money, enough to pay for small ship pvp anyways.
---
It's the transition from a pack of newbies running around in cheap fleets to nullsec power trying to muscle in on the big stage that needs the fat wallets. But even that is workable if you play the diplomacy game. On the scale of Test to Brave, these guys sound way more like Test.
---
Neither are you. And assuming that Alcoholocaust flair is truthful (because who would ever lie about themselves on the internet) your corp is just a little more shit than people who don't enjoy seeing PVP events cancelled.
---
that's not my only weird preference!!!

Imagine believing a company like CCP doesn't throw in postponed where forgotten and thrown away belongs.
---
I mean, I've been playing for just over a couple weeks now, and I love it. And I'm not even talking like played forever ago and picked it back up like I never even heard of the game before April 3rd lmao
---
I recommend it and being open to whatever happens. Check out the plethora of youube videos to help you out in figuring out how you want to play, do the intro missions (seriously, do the intro missions, they give you free basic ships, in-game cash, A LOT of experience and practice), and find your fun in it. I already have my two other character slots filled because I like taking various approaches to the game. 
---
It can def feel a little overwhelming at first, but don't let it discourage you. Take it as a challenge, step by step, and you'll start catching the bug like I did.

Like the supers dropping on subcaps in LS? Can't imagine why some people enjoy playing arranged tournaments. I hope you overcome your mental disorder.

Technically correct is the best kind of correct.

"Oh yeah... Oooh... I'm about to- FLY AWAY FROM THE WORMHOLE!"
---
did the forum pvp meta change since i last played?
---
&gt;Does playing on TQ from China require a VPN
---
No. But the network latency can be high so players tend to buy some special VPN for network acceleration (This kind of VPNs are just for gaming and cannot help people visit blocked sites like YouTube and twitter)

Hello! try /r/evejobs

The game was over 15 years old when I started last year, and I’m currently having a blast. Just train into ramjags and enjoy the salt from all the vets while holding down their blingy roaming ships in your cheap frigate.

Well, I was sick of you guys just sitting there tethered watching your structure to die. I came for explosions.

If you dudes would have just gone cheap and did t1 BSs with some logi for your numbers, you could have had a fun time and lots of kills would have been had, maybe even won, if not caused a lot of damage and won the isk war.
---
\^\^ This shit, I like.
---
2000 players, if each averages 15 characters - that could easily be accomodated in null given how much rental space there is.
---
&gt; the game needs more players.
---
Yes. And this is exactly the problem with these guys. Instead of players we'll get multiboxed AFK accounts at best with an occasional fleet, but more likely just plainly apparent bots. Also this kinda shit makes actual players leave as they get sick and tired of it, which is opposite of what needs to happen.
---
Corp who owns it didnt even bring this one up. We play in nullsec, so we don't necessarily show up for all this highsec stuff.
---
Rofl. FC yelled to set green safeties. So... the ones that got concorded got what was coming.

News at 11 when space is hard away it can be hard to defend. Next up we will hear how water is wet and fire is hot.

Bhaals, Nestors, Leshaks, Snakes and Pancakes are all used a fair bit, even in low class space.

Alphas can’t fly cloak, his best bet is probably Astero the go Omega to get a cloak asap, if he wants to stay Alpha then he’s gonna have a hard time.

A dreadnought is a pretty good idea because the lead could alpha a young hurricane in a fight and then collapse when the rest of the hurricanes finally show up.

Nope. Only passive ones. The armor ones do affect the adaptive though.

The amount of unabashed racism coming out of r/eve over these players is pretty fucking terrible.

It's going to say "orbiting \_\_\_\_\_" so as long as the name is not the save as surrounding, you'll know. Also, turning on the tactical overlay in the camera options would help figure it out.

---
To be fair this is required otherwise people is PIBC would see it as a half assed attempt at jumping ship. The HAD to make it look good otherwise people would just keep leaving Serenity and their numbers would drop too low for a critical mass invasion of Tranq.
---
Even with them coming to Tranq, they are going to be going to a LS point in space and can still be clubbed to death in their crib before they get on their feet and able to establish any form of territories to make isk in. Even if 2,000 players come to say, Tama, Tama cannot support that many people, nor can the surrounding systems. They will need space, lots of space. Simply because EVERYONE will have pretty much nothing, low SP and no in space owned infrastructure and any they do, they will only have numbers on their side to defend. 
---
Whilst that worked back in the day with rifters and Goons, I can't see it working when fleets of supers and titans come to crush an upstart early. We have ALL seen what happens when a group is left alone when effectivly defenseless when they could of been killed off very easily. Hint: They own Delve now and the largest super cap force int eh game. People are NOT going to let that happen again. Granted using Goons as an example is extreme due to already living on Tranq, massive SP and already large fleets of ships and infrastructure, but the point still stands. If you want to stop an invasion, you snap it's neck in it's infancy, even if you don't kill it, it's crippled
---
I doubt they will not bot, it's culturally acceptable to cheat in China, they feel rules don't apply to them, thus cheating in schools, universities and games is so damned common
---
Add all your way points, optimize, then add your final desto as a new way point.
---
True, but who will give it to them and how would they defend it from established powers that want a slice of that pie? Remember they are starting off with 500,000 SP characters and fuck all isk. It's going to be VERY hard for them to get on their feet if they go directly to Null. If they live in LS for say 6 months, get a feel for the geo-political landscape and establish relationships as well as letting their members skill up and ship up, they will be able to possibly hole space. Numbers simply does not mean you can hold space. Just look at what happened to the Drone Lands over the past 12 months. They had numbers and the ships (granted not orginization) and they still got swept out and now the whole place is a constant shit storm of fun and content where as 2 years ago, it was a wasteland for the Russians

‘03 player here - haven’t played since 2010 but I still look in from time to time. 05-08 were the golden years, I played an *unhealthy* amount of eve back then. I’ll never forget the time I dual webbed a drake for the first time in my gank fit Navy Mega - I was absolutely pounding on him with a full rack of t2 neutrons/void and 5 ogre IIs. He tanked me long enough for his gang to jump/pop me and my multi-billion ISK head full of HG/officer implants. Drakes were *scary* ships for a long time. Miss those days.

Hmm. Why, yes, I did.

Possibly even faction mods

Thank you kind sir

Yeah, when you live in null and you're deploying/moving somewhere you pack the ship maintenance bay with the ships you plan on using there. You can jump 1m m\^3 of assembled ships (that can only contain ammo and fitted modules) plus a corp hangar and a cargo hold.
---
welcome to the human condition
---
I for one enjoy delicious chinese food and welcome our new chinese overlords.
---
The pedant in me requires to point out that the term 'nationalism' would probably be more correct, though still not 100% correct. The stereotypes you see applied to these situations is based on the nationality of the subject, like when people rant about Russians, and not skin color/ancestry. I doubt anyone would care if they found out a member of their corp was some Chinese dude who grew up in Athens, TX.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem
---
Pure fucking gold
---
\^ He's absolutely right. This is where you will play 90% of the time. You go make money in-game while watching Youtube/Netflix, so you can buy ship, join fleet and shoot people in the face. Then brag about it on Reddit when you win the fight. If you don't, make sure to find the enemies post and downvote it. Rinse and repeat - welcome to EVE!
---
Never too early to quit that's what I know
---
I would also suggest fixing your overview for FW. Quick Google search should get you on your way.
---
Aparently they want to be independents. Lets see....
---
Travelling salesman is actually quite different from optimizing a route on EVE lol

In my opinion the best Russian slang in EVE is 'chemodanit' (verb.) - to protect someone or something in forum fights.

Based on mentioned chemodan as Damage Control Unit of course.

Did you actually apply?
---
You are 100% right.  Their long match will be full of thorns.  In my comprehension of this meeting, the low-sec is just a rally point waiting for the members to catch up and white or blue to everyone is also temporary.  They may gather around jita for the sake of easy-logistics, rebuild their organization, count numbers, store ships and isk, skill themselves. 
---
After all of that, then there will finally be a direction. Go to war or negotiation table when they know what cards in their hand. As you infer above, null-sec is the only choice, the only question is which one. There are too many regions with few population.  Own population then own territory, not the other side.  That exactly what you goons do. 
---
They may be lack of all the ingame things for now, however, never be lack of rl skills and professional teams. They are not a bunch of nob but a fully organized army who are the winner of another serve. 
---
Just wait and see what they may bring to us，quiet exciting.  :)
---
Yes it is. Even by putting "catching up" aside, you will find plenty of content you can enjoy right on day 1.
---
Nowadays I like helping new players more than actually playing the game, so if you feel like having someone with experience to answer your questions as you go along let me know, and I'll PM you my info. If you get the hang of it quickly I'd be glad to travel with you for a while.

He was just saying don't bring bots and rmt in TQ

From all that talk about people complaining about botting and saying how its killing the game, almost damn near nobody wanted to do anything about it and didnt take his offer to help.  Nothing but complaints on reddit.

Getting awoxed by fellow Amarr militia members won't be common as they will take a standings hit and possibly be forced out of militia after a few times. Caldari on the other hand don't lose caldari standings and are not at risk of being kicked out of militia, so watch out.

Well, to be fair, using that suffix (-nik) is a common way to make a word for a person, machine or some other subject being associated with whatever word's root you're sticking it to (podvodnik = sub-marine-er; razboynik = brigand, aka rob-ber, blokadnik = "blockade-related" person etc.).
---
I doubt people had Leningrad siege survivors in mind when they came up with this term for blockade runners, but I guess some of the older EVE players could think of that meaning the first time they heard it on comms or something.

I don't know Polish, only Russian, but it was enough to decipher them. In Russian we use equivalents as well, mostly s'yebat' and v'ebat' (variations exist, ofc).
---
For those who read this, please note these are not words you are expected to say in polite society.
---
The reason why everyone continued to use english version in 2008 is very poor localisation at beginning. 
---
The most funny was "Warp to fleet member" that was translated as "Slip on your fleet's dick" ("скользнуть на член флота"), so everybode rolfed and switched to english back.
---
And yeah, now its more a habit.
---
Well, it was pretty normal to use "dig" for "mine" IRL as well. You can still occasionally run into now-archaic word "rudokop" ("ore-digger") in some old or poetic texts. It was mostly replaced, especially in official and technical texts, with the word that means "extract, procure" etc., which can be used for any resource: ore, oil, lumber...
---
I guess people choose the word "dig" here because it sounds less formal and its simplicity contrasts with imagery of working industrial spaceships, which makes it funnier.

As a Russian player who is currently winning EVE, I find your username... interesting :P

That's what I'm saying... there was no method to apply a couple months ago when I was trying. It was just "hang out in chat, be active, wait for recruiter to contact you".
---
I was active, chatting with people all the time and posting my solo killmails and never heard a thing.
---
I think KF was switching to a new API system or something at the time, it's probably been sorted out and the website applications are open again.
---
I wasn't around Russian EVE community for a long time, but I definitely heard people using "jackiechan" (both noun and verb) exactly like that.
---
I guess different parts of the community could came to this in different ways.
---
I mean, even English community uses "krab" exactly like that, but for what I assume are different reasons.

True. Very true.  =)

---
It's a common gaming slang. "Brush" is Shia Zi, Shua means "to brush" or "to farm" in gaming, "Zi" is something we append at the end of a noun (but usually you can't make new words with it). So it means a krab. The exact origin I don't know, it may come from some dialects or the act of repetitive farming making the game spam notifications like crazy --- like brushing a wall with those notifications. 
---
Shua Zi also have another meaning in a certain phrase. If someone say "这人有两把刷子", or "this dude has two brushes", that means you are a man worthy of respect. It is from a dialect and popularized by TV dramas or things like that.
---
&gt; It's really just a measure of inflation/deflation, and games are generally inflationary. 
---
Exactly.

Urban Dictionary though has another term for congo line, which is more fitting:  [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=congo%20line](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=congo%20line) (semi-NFSW)

Things don't work like that. It's quite a bit more nuanced, and if merely interacting with people that will troll with those copypasta will have negative consequences on their lives, TEST would have destroyed FRT long, long ago.

But those players will get angry for obvious reasons

Do real Chinese take offense to outsiders mentioning Tiananmen Square and the whole thing of the brutal killing of 10s of thousands of peaceful democracy protestors? Is it more just to get their Internet shut off?
---
To be honest, I'm surprised that there isn't more Mobile Depot spam along these lines. For example, just go every 2 days to Fraternity's staging and leave a depot on grid with their Keepstar with the message, "Tienanmen Square was a deadly massacre in 1989," or something. Effectively a denial of service if their Internet keeps getting DCed.
---
I would love to see CCP banning people mentioning the Tiananmen Square massacre. 🍿

You have come to us at the exact *perfect* time to join EVE as a new player.

The game’s never been this good and we want you to explore the full potential of features that New Eden has to offer.

If you can take your boat being blown up [and it will, it’s not conjecture] with everything in it and on it [and you won’t get it back] without nagging about it and carry on with a new ship, they by all means!

This is now my favorite bit of EVE related trivia now, given that the ship is shaped like a toenail clipping.
---
This was the plan all along. RnK 9 dimensional chess moves to conquer TQ.
---
I\`ll add a few words, some of these are obsolete but were used at some point:   
---
Carrier - Kara  (english approximation: Judgement/Retribution/Punishment)  
---
Leshak -  Leshii (similar to Leshy in name and meaning)  
---
Megatron - Mega (easier to say this than Megathron)
---
Arazu  - Zaraza - (rarely used, meaning disease/infection.)
---
Dominix - Domik -  (russian word for small house)   
---
Dramiel - Drama/Dryan\` (Drama is self explanatory, Dryan\` is trash/rubbish)
---
Lachesis - "Lacha"- (a name for russian "Lake Lacha" in Arkhangelsk oblast OR just short version of the Lachesis in russian)  
---
Noctis - Nogot\` - (Nail, although i haven\`t heard this in a while)  
---
Thanatos - Tanya - (Tanya or Tatiana, a russian name)  
---
Rapidki - name for any missile launcher group with "Rapid" before its name (Rapid Torpedo Launcher for ex.).
---
zKillboard - Borda - (Bulletin Board System or just a board... but definitely not a french mathematician  *Jean-Charles, chevalier de Borda*)  
---
Killmail - KillMilo  - (Kill and Milo are 2 words, first one is obvious and second one translated as "Soap"...)  
---
Unrelated/Offensive/Not-eve-exclusive/18+/Rated**NM**for**N**otSo**M**ature:  
---
Pidr/Pidarasi - Faggot/Faggots,  depending on context might it  be used jokingly or to provoke a response for laughs OR to indicate the enemy doing to the pilot something he can\`t prevent or repel (like blackops drop on solo paladin/thanny). **WARNING:** ***Usage of this word IRL is not advised and one risks tanking a lot of kinetic damage from the target-person*** ***(especially if target-person is dumb and/or strong and/or higher ranked)*** and instantly  points at speaker low intellect and/or poor vocabulary, potentially bad manners.

---
That was uncalled for, but to clarify: TSP is described over a set of fully connected vertices, whereas graph path optimization has a well-defined set of edges. TSP also implies that no path may be traveled twice (which is a corollary of being fully connected), whereas graph path optimization has no such requirement. I don't have an optimization algorithm to give you right now, but a simple approximation algorithm would be to run all-pairs shortest path and use the result to calculate the lowest sum.
---
So yeah, optimizing routes in EVE is definitely not TSP. I can see it being in NPC (though I haven't bothered to check :P), but it's not TSP at all.
---
huh... if it works it works.
---
There was no plex in 2003 :thinking:
---
Cannot tell that by looking at the picture honestly, but thanks for the explanation.
---
I was gonna give a different answer but instead I'll just copy a quote from the TSP wiki page that was linked: "Even though the problem is computationally difficult, a large number of heuristics and exact algorithms are known, so that some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%."
---
Besides which, whether it is or not in NPC makes no difference in my question lol
---
carebearing must be boring...
---
Yes, it is rather decent income for HS actually.

How do EC-300 drones work? I thought you'd lose the ability to lock on a ship for 20 seconds? I was hunting an ASStero and had him scrammed + webbed. He then threw some EC-300s at me. I believe I got ECMed because I saw the jam symbol appear above my HUD. But my target was still locked. He managed to gain distance and warped off shortly after. Do ECM drones only deactivate modules?
---
How is it done? Do people typically scan down signatures or get them as escalations from anomalies?
---
Hurricane ftw, capitals cant track :)
---
How can i make income from combat? I do security missions and jumps to rats nests. But if the enemie spawning are too low bounty, it’s not very worth it. 
---
I really like the combat aspect of the game, and would like to make money while doing it.
---
Maybe i should join a Corp for this?
---
Yeah, sorry then for the bad comment.
---
You are right that as you have both the start and endpoint fixed, it is not the classic TSP. Though, if you could solve the modified problem, you could modify the graph construction to correspond to the classic TSP, which has been proven to be 'hard'.
---
Idk which relaxation CCP uses in its code, though.
---
More like sub-scan, or proximity scan. Imo, here pod = russian sub rather than pod = capsule.
---
Was a great fight - we lost more - had fun - thanks everyone!
---
Gas spawns in regions now with "hot spot" constalations
---
thanks, thats the reason i unsubbed
---
While probably the best option given what's available ingame, this is not necessarily optimal.
---
Figure anything out?
---
Can't do what lol there are no rules in Eve
---
Thing is with TZ tanking, what ever space they get will most likely stay theirs.
---
then please let me know which one, because not a single VNI jumps my eyes as a bot. I lost too many VNIs on different ways that i claim dying way X is botting. Also, good bots usually don't get caught in VNIs

---
Short answer : You seems to be in HS. Most income from HS comes from either L4 missions or incursion, the rest is very nice and cute but mostly for new comers. The important thing is, HS income will always be somewhat bellow the rest, and unless you really really enjoy doing them, you shouldn't stay in HS. Join some LS/NS/WH corp, find run anomalies or abyssal sites or high payout missions to finance other more fun endeavors (aka PvP generally).
---
Both.
---
Whast exactly can they take with them when they transfer over?
---
nah he's right, this game would be much better off if biggest ships in game were battleships. A lot more tactical plays could be made.
---
"English people not Chinese people"?
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Also, what type of ship should i have for venturing out into LS? I currently run a Caracal Cruiser.
---
Do i need to have at least a Battlecruiser?
---
I read this like a letter Kenny monologue.
---
I totally agree that the VNI nerf is not the greatest nerf to VNIs. but 10% less income for a bot already means 10% less inflation, which sounds like a step to me (not great but okey).
---
More value has the fighter application/NSA nerf, that carrier/super nerf for ratting is far larger. And if botters are forced to move from supers to VNI's, the impact will be huge. We will look at 40-60% decrease in income, which is enormous.
---
I expect a botter to be maxing his profits anyways, so a botter will not be able to just add more accounts, as he would have done that already before to maximize the profit. If only a single botter is now deeming that EVE pays to little per hr (IRL), it has a great impact on the economy.
---
Not your fault Jin, don't worry. &lt;3
---
Easy to learn the basics due to how ubiquitous it is.  Doesnt matter where you are in the world, its a fairly useful language.  
---
But its hard to master.  English pulls a lot from both Latin and germanic languages and mixes these freely.  Throw in homonyms and homophones and it gets confusing very quickly.
---
In that case, if you can't take range after jumping right into the gang, stay close to the hole and jump back when you got hitted to hard (be carefull to not be alphaed).  
---
they will eventualy try to follow you they will have few seconds delay, so you have better hope to pull range quick before to be pointed. 
---
if there are enough people, they can split light tackle on the both side of the hole, making this strat more difficult.   
---
after forced you to jump, maybe your opponent will feel confident enouth to try to chasse you away from the hole and give you a chance get some kills. (or use a comand destro).  
---
but, in fact, a hole isn't the best place to fight with a kity fleet, thats why armor brawl are so common in WH ^^
---
Thanks!
---
This is one of those chases when the more you know, the more new question you want to ask. Which is a good thing, I guess.
---
First off, NO. RMT botters are basically companies, aiming to maximize profits. So they already ALWAYS run at max possible accounts. They cannot just add more accounts, as they already run at max. So every plex they earn less, is less $ they earn.
---
Second, if it was CCPs fault, show me an example of a game (with a public market) without bots? They are working on it, but bots behave closely to real players, so it's not that easy to spot them.
---
Damn, good catch!
---
What's the voltron fleet, All I can see on Tapi side is eagles and stabbers
---
Not quite sure what you're trying to accomplish here.
---
Depends on who you ask. That one is closer to how icelanders do it, but norwegians and swedes pronounce it almost like english.
---
I would assume most botters want to keep as low profile as possible, but when "requirements" change, the risk they are willing to take also changes.
---
What probably happened lately was that the number of bots kept growing until the problem was undeniable. This caused forum rage which resulted in CCP being forced to step in.
---
So a low effort copy paste. Gross.
---
if you don't have "expanded way points"  in your route planner, just optimize, and add your home station last. failing that, refer to my first suggestion, and drag/drop reorder your way points.
---
I guess you point out a tournament scene while the other guy talks specifically about widespread of VG player as a legit profession, supported by mainstream organizations.
---
Either way, there's no reason Korean organization would try to distance itself from tournaments just on the ground of those being tournament / organized PvP events.
---
For real, I'd just make ratting bounty nerfed by 90% while dropping more loot and let market do it's thing. A few Chinese bot corps are already setting up in low and null, collapsing economy.
---
As I just said, there is a balance. They could easily flood the game with bots, but they realize that might be bad.
---
Why do you say they are already maxed out? What do you think determines the number of bots they can run?
---
&gt;Second, if it was CCPs fault, show me an example of a game (with a public market) without bots? 
---
Not sure if I can do that, but I can say that when a bot is able to run 24/7 for months and there is no automated checking for even the most basic stuff like active play time/number of ticks, etc, then CCP becomes responsible.
---
i don't know why but voltron is everyone but tapi
---
So Tapi has one fleet with about 130 dudes give or take voltrons the other part.
---
For low/null, you don’t need a ship, you need allies. Join a Corp, either a big null one like Horde/Brave, a smaller FW one in lowsec, or maybe a wormhole Corp, which I know nothing about. But no matter how big or powerful your ship is, it won’t do anything but die if you take it into lowsec solo
---
Tea. We also drink a lot of it.
---
Can't beat them join them am I rite?
---
Honestly, I have been using a Stratios for High Sec exploration. For me it's a pretty good sweet spot, it's similar to a VNI with scanning bonuses.
---
I generally run an all round set up with an integrated scanner so I rarely have to refit.
---
We have some things going on in hs
---
ECMs have a chance to succeed. If they fail the icon shows up anyway but is more transparent. If it’s successful you will lose lock and it will be more lit up.

What do you call "venturing in LS ?" You really shouldn't go into LS for PvE unless you really know what you're doing. Maybe clone soldier hunting at best, but expect people to chase you down. If you're looking for PvP, buy a dozen T1 frigates, get into FW LS, look for other T1 frigates in novice complexes for LS and you will get a lot more content for your money.
---
I wouldn’t recommend a wh Corp for you though as it seems you don’t have too much experience

Eve is designed so that new players have a place in the game, be it fleet fights, the economy, or what ever most common activity people generally do. You might not be able to do everything but you will always have something to do that's somewhat fun and/or rewarding.

If you have a humble frigate friend or two, you might consider trying doing Frigate Abyssal sites together. They take 3 (matching) Filaments to enter, but let you bring two friends along (all of you in frigates) for the party.
---
And if you like missiles, you can actually do T1-T2 Dark Filaments pretty easily in a group of *extremely* cheap Kestrels. (Seriously, these are like 6mil, and 3mil of that is that one rig.)

---
    Small Core Defense Field Purger I
---
    Small Bay Loading Accelerator II
---
If you can use any T2 modules on this, use them. Preferably the launchers and the Ballistic Controls over everything else. 
---
When I was first getting into Frigate Abyssals, I used a slightly more expensive version of this (Republic Fleet extenders, T2 other things, etc), and then a Navy Hookbill (almost the same fit), before upgrading to the Hawk I use now. The DPS of this is pretty low (so you will definitely need those friends), but it flies at around 4km/s (in a Dark filament), and so it stays alive by outrunning everything on the field. The shield extenders/purgers are enough to shrug off the few hits you do take, and really the strategy is as simple as 'orbit the Transfer Conduit at 10-15km and throw missiles at whatever's in range'. (If you're having range problems, go for a smaller orbit; if you're getting hit, go for a bigger orbit.) Dark Filaments are extremely cheap (because so many of the Cruiser pilots hate them) so between cheap ships and cheap filaments you can learn about the Abyss, its enemies, and flying together in a small group (target focus and priorities), for minimal investment.

To add to /u/1darklight1 's reply, it will also get a white colored ring around the outside (in addition to being less transparent) of the icon that will tick down to show how long the jam will last. See the below video - it's time stamped link, but if that fails, 4m 45s.

---
In the top right where the raven is locked, you can see two ECM symbols. The left on is greyed out - it's activated, but failed to jam the target. The right one is brighter and more saturated - it's successfully jammed the target and the white ring around it is ticking down to show how long the jam lasts. For an example with even more, check 5m 40s in the same video.
---
oh yes within month/years they will be important, but they know the game and injector is here to help them

I think it's more that "everyone else" does it too. So to keep up you have to do it yourself and noone cares anway, right?

Which doesn't make the result any better, of course!
---
A trade would say: stop loss
---
It's the same in reverse. The only target for sov in their timezone is GOTG and FRT. Maybe russians, but i think they mostly use early EU tz IIRC.
---
Now GOTG is not in it's best state i think, but they have enough caps and supers to hold off low SP swaths of subcaps i'd say.     
---
Same goes for FRT and the russian sov holders are either with GOTG or TEST, which gives them strong enough allies to defend themselves.
---
We'll have to wait and see.

My only issue with this kinda thing is it misrepresents what EVE content actually is. A lot of people looking for new games look at twitch, myself included. If I tuned in and saw someone AFK, not interacting, mining in hisec, and they were the most viewed streamer I never would have never started playing.

Stupid question ! I never gotten the fitting browser to work, am I missing something ?

Voltron is all of legacys group without test or FI.RE. 
---
If test alone ran fleets our own group wouldnt be able to grow and learn esp the FCs.
---
I think its a better atmosphere than "welcome x corp or x alliance you are now ours so get in fleet these systems are yours so krab there and get in fleet here".
---
 All these smaller groups make up a good like 2 or 3 regions. They might be under one giant quarter of a donut but imo its healthier for the game when smaller groups are able to work autonomously
---
shit br tool
---
Its a shame that this game can look so good in some aspects and then fail and flop like a retard in other aspects that nullify any gains made. So much potential for eve to be more than in it ruined by upper management with thier heads up thier ass and not a clue shared between them.
---
Solution is to make titans ~~easier~~harder to ~~kill~~build/distribute
---
Why
---
As a bonus that makes even less sense, the FC for the voltron fleet is from test too. I don't get it either.

Dimishing returns on Titan blob could be something like a gradual nerf to Titan tank based on the number of friendly titans surrounding it.

Or to the Titan's offensive abilities, again based on the number of friendly titans.

This can be on grid / in system / within 250km, etc etc

Alone, definitely not. Consider PvP to be a fun activity that need to be funded by isk making.

Well then I hope you guys the best and really really looking forward to see you grow very big :D

Cool, thank you!
---
It's grey area RMT with a multiple dimension of questions/issues.
---
At the first dimension there is this question: How do you discern a legit streamer who does giveaways, from an illegit streamer who solely uses giveaways to get RL money? It looks like there are clean cut cases (like this guy) but also, as a game company (CCP), if you ban this guy then where do you stop? I wonder whether people have the same for other games (like streamers giving away WoW gold etc.) and how did these games react.
---
The second dimension is what do you do in cases of giveaway fraud. That seems to be more like a twitch issue. Do they even have a policy?
---
The third dimension is how this giveaway culture sucks ass for genuine streamers. But many of them too use giveaways for more viewers so to some extent they are getting shot at with their own weapon.
---
Thank you for your welcome.
---
(btw I only speak about RMT botters, not players that bot to progress faster)
---
Well, economy 101: invest as long as return is higher than investment. 
---
-Creating an additional bot is basically free (if we consider that "they just make an additional bot if they earn less")
---
-If an additional bot is NOT free, they also cannot "just make another bot".
---
On the return side: 
---
-There are more than 1 RMT botters, so they are in competition with each other (no monopoly!)
---
-So as long as bots are free, they are ALWAYS willing to make more, as they produce additional income. So they will ALWAYS create the max amount of bots until they hit cost vs return equality. So an additional bot at this point will NOT be free, otherwise they wouldn't stop making bots.
---
-If your bots now suddenly create less income, this point of cost/revenue equality will come earlier. You either work with the new optimum (most likely the same amount of bots as it's a sudden increase to buy another pc) or if your profit is too small now, you simply stop.

I unfortunately can't find a graph for this :( Would have been way easier to explain

---
Thanks. I can tell you some secrets. The top managers（CEO） don't really want to get too much attention. Obviously, it's too much now.  Now it's kind of like putting them on a fire. 
---
Maybe you are curious about the unknown, or maybe too many PIBC enemy immigrants arrived in Europe early.
---
Calling code ?
---
Is there a way to tell which are hotspots?
---
Deleted?
---
This is completely without reference, just drawing from memory, but what I recall reading was it’s against TOS if any form of monetization gives an advantage to viewers in giveaways, or if giveaways are locked behind sub/bit requirements.
---
Isn't that the case already? :)
---
Heh heh... "turd chomper"

Even Orange would stop this from happening.

It’s like fukken Cockney rhyming slang.

Heh, that one is Greek. And I'm not sure he was bound there.

I dunno seeing your discord messages is pretty up there kid lmao

Sorry, my kids were using the TV when I got home (computer is in the living room, doubles as the TV, small house).

Unfortunately the answer is no.  You can use google play cards and google play credits on Amazon products IF they are purchased through the Amazon Kindle app.  This of course limits you to what you can buy in that App, which is only magazines, books and such (you could try buying something there and then trying to get a refund through Amazon instead of Google play but that may not work either, Amazon might be forced to give you a Google play credit again).  Sorry again for taking so long to answer, I rather be correct than fast.  o7.
---
And the Lord speaketh unto them, "wolololol"
---
Come join TEST. We have an internal Chinese language division with a hilarious amount of intel and memes on FRT, and we look forward to memeing PIBC.
---
I dont think its that simple. I guess you could say risk and attention are a "cost", but you dont seem to take those into consideration. Botting is "illegal", but the enforcement is not constant and varies depending on activity type and community rage.
---
&gt;So an additional bot at this point will NOT be free, otherwise they wouldn't stop making bots.
---
Until recently, we can assume they were essentially always free. At this point there is probably a VPN cost, but we dont know if it is negligible. You dont seem to consider the realities of virtual items.

You cannot take the structure out of the BR, as that do have a huge force multiplier in favour of the defenders.

 typical ending in Black Rise !
---
For sure: every Titan is a capital, but not every capital is a titan, because [and that is why I said it] Titans are classed as super capitals (silly me, dreadnoughts would also be a super capital, right?).
---
It's absolute rubbish. on the front page of searching rmt I can get a plex for $10US. its $15 US to me in Aus of CCP.
---
Who knew that after all those years all it would take to bring down PL was one salty B tier FC.
---
Yeah, but what are their thoughts on FAX balance?
---
How long before said corps ‘leave’ pl and have their members coincidentally join snigg?
---
I'm curious. What do you want to say?
---
Should not be...
---
Nice!
---
I mean, memes aside, we're not a million miles off the things they hated about Serenity here on TQ.  Nothing worth fighting over, borders not really moving.
---
No, I was being dumb. It's "English, not Chinese" as in the languages spoken
---
pl has the staff turnover of an amazon warehouse but the productivity of a business from the panama papers
---
it doesn't hurt yourself unless you go back to those areas in the same day or period.  People doing this have gigantic routes and they just run them once per day, or once per every few hours (so that non-cherry pickers clean them up)
---
All the salty B-Team FCs were driven out long ago.
---
Make PIBC great again？
---
why not just have the player click a box that asks if they are human! if there not they would not click the box! bam problem solved!
---
mabye just ban accounts form china

Apostles look like monk hats so they're obviously superior.

I hate those so much.  As a visually impaired person captchas are a curse from Hell.
---
Gotta light the signal in the night sky.
---
The thing is if they build up their alliance and take sov by force something epic will happen. Meanwhile all the established alliances sit their krabbing/botting without doing anything except for this autism war between test and frt.
---
You're right, I meant to say F tier.
---
And then join NC?

I hope they stay true to their words, this has the potential to really stir up EVE

It is discouraging as a streamer to see stuff like this. I don’t know who or what is watching him, but I see so many smaller streamers under Eve all of the time that are/could be very entertaining if you just get in there in talk to them. Instead people are watching this to win prizes that from the sounds of it aren’t even real. 
---
Streamers use giveaways for multiple reasons - and most of them are for good honest reasons! As a way to engage with their viewers, promote certain content, or even promote themselves. To use giveaways as a sham like this makes the rest of us feel dirty. In my personal opinion it’s wrong to use giveaways in this way. Sadly, as far as I know, it’s only a no no with CCP if monetization is used to increase chances, or if you can only enter the giveaway by paying. 
---
It’s disheartening to see, especially when you work hard and put the time in only to have someone else come in and AFK/chatbot their way to the top. On a positive note, the people that watch you instead of a sham AFK giveaway bot is that much better because they actually want interaction and entertainment, and choose to watch you over that.
---
I wonder how the Serenity cluster hardware stacked up against the Tranquility cluster hardware.   Tranquility went through a major refresh a few years back, did Serenity do that too?  Or are they ahead or behind?   This in context of large fleet fights, crashing and TIDI experience.
---
Don't insult Sort, he's an honest, upstanding member of the community, how dare you.
---
Audio?

Boy is CCP fucking up bad lately. They blow a player tournament and now this fiasco. Good thing they've laid off their community team. xD

Yes it's good.
---
No It's not Pay 2 Win, it does have a path from cash to isk tho, but unlike other mmo's in EvE just being able to make a ship move and keeping it alive are totally different things, there is no I Win Button.
---
If your genuine about trying the game out, get a referral from some one you'll get some bonuses, also you really need to force yourself to stick with it beyond the first month, its not a game your going to get a quick feel for in like 30 minutes hell even a week isn't long enough for most people to really see what the games got to offer.
---
I'v been playing for literal years and I am still learning things and there are still professions in game iv never done its well worth your time but you need to give it a chance.
---
And as everyone will tell you, find a good corp.
---
To be fair, you can reduce the eve map to a fully connected graph with only the manually added waypoints as nodes. The cost between any 2 waypoints is deterinistic and fixed (a unique path of K solar systems, route affected by securty/avoidance list and all the good stuff). The problem is then equivalent to TSP.
---
i think the only thing sadder than stainguy's obsession with pl is watching pl's alliance leader constantly try to pre-empt stainguy with these posts. that's a pretty low-tier reddit nemesis m8

EVE enjoyable to new players?   
---
\[Laughs in killmails\]
---
They are seeded, as filament CRATES, however they are limited to t1 and t3 only.
---
Well then I apologise for not making it sufficiently clear when I originally said "BPOs I already owned".
---
I’m talking about them saying about mining in Immensea
---
How did the chinese kill their own server ? What's the story behind it ?
---
Just report him
---
If they shoot you they lose standings with amarr, which doesn't affect their ability to stay in Caldari militia
---
Chinese invasion plan haha Well let's say them banned words like tianaman square 1989  Winnie the Pooh etc in chat haha
---
But now serious it's good that we are getting more players on Eve it Will be Nice though.
---
Req is part of Legacy you fucktard
---
And it Will also die out the players who can not afford to sub

Good AAR and very nice engagement.

No, but I still play it almost every day for some reason.

It's all explained in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/wiki/index).

Who is this Jay Guy ? What's his story?

Concord response in 2 seconds? Okay so engaging like that was silly but it's still a bit unlucky.

becouse nullbears are boring

You can credit card warrior your way to the best items in the game, but unlike other games, the odds of winning are still heavily stacked against you as an individual. If you do decide to buy all the stuff with your credit card, the people who destroy your ship are gonna be super happy.
---
So yes, you can get some easy kills initially due to having superior gear, but all it takes is that someone bigger and better than you notices what you're doing and you end up losing all of it. That's EVE's way of policing pay2win.
---
It's from when I played Warcraft. Supposed to be ironic because it's click and shoot, so you can't miss.
---
It was functionally the same other than not being on the ingame market until 2008.
---
haHAA they're having fun how pathetic
---
Dont fly a standard kestrel. Fly it like a cheesy rocket garmur, nobody expects rockets from 24km away. It'll take a while but you can beat most ancil repped and buffer fit ships. You can even take fights against people in the plex and just heat and hope you get out of their scram range.
---
i never said they were or weren't, or anything about that? www.rif.org?
---
Nobody wants to see your so called (blobbing) combat vids anyhow
---
The ending is everything wrong with eve tbh. Better drop a super on someone who come and give you good fights amirite?
---
Now I need to re-watch Scott pilgrim.
---

Nay, only supercarriers and titans are supercapitals.

All supercapitals are still capitals.

Some English speakers in SW referred to barguest fleet as battlepaddle fleet.
---
Most of my kills in my WH don't show on Zkill but some do. Any idea what's going on?

Yeah, good luck with that, it would take actual hours to farm T4 and T5s that way. Why can't they just seed all filaments directly.
---
https://prnt.sc/ne4wou
---
Yes, I'm here to help.
---
But before, could you help me pls by leaving TQ with your friends?
---
Promise to find some nice flairs after fix it!
---
In order for zkill to pick up a killmail, it has to have access to it. It can do that in one of three ways:
---
1.) If the attacker has given zkill access to their killmails (and by that I mean the pilot that dealt the final blow)
---
2.) If the victim has given zkill access to their killmails
---
3.) If anyone who has given zkill access to their killmails opens the mail and reads it (not sure about this one, can someone confirm?)
---
Since so many people have zkill accounts, this happens most of the time, but not always. So make a zkill account, and connect your pilots to it via ESI.
---
Oh of course. I don't know why I was confused, I believed you were talking about friendly fire within the Caldari Militia.
---
When a small lowsec entity forces all of QFC (friends club?) to blue each other in order to unsuccessfully defend their space, they call upon their goonswarm masters. Darwinism. is the best QFC member not in QFC. Dont be a puppet, take your own space and control your own destiny.

Game status is "Early Access" thats why you can experience some minior ingame bugs. But its F2P :D

because access is only for the time period of events
---
You can pay hundreds of Pounds to inject a Supercarrier Pilot and buy one and lose it in a couple minutes because you are a scrub with a 1 day old super pilot.
---
couldve gone either way, good fight hope to see more fights soon. these fights where theres no prep on either side are the best
---
The annoucement is that the tool is not functioning as desired and this would mean a sub optimal viewing experience.
---
As it stands, we are looking at ways to still run the tournament (the tool does impact the actual game mechanics as well) for the players, without streaming it - so at least all those who have trained and practiced can still benefit from the fights

Binliners entry in empires of eve is going to be hilarious, 'he was gifted command of the premier pvp force in eve and promptly dropped it into the trash and smiled. Sadly, his pained eyes revealed the truth behind the smile.

Top tier failure.
---
we are working with the captains on making this happen - the 1st day will be the 27th and pilots were already available on that date - the task is to make sure day 2 can work for everyone involved as that  will be a new date and time. 
---
This event at the end of the day is for the pilots - as such dates and times must work for them
---
This. I think an all around stratios is the best option. You can hack, do ded sites, peek into wh. Later when you have the isk to bling you can move to lowsec and do the mid tier ded sites with ease. If you develop the taste for pvp along the road you already have a supernice platform to use.
---
You're right. He has no hair.
---
The government won't block an Internet service that easily, it only blocks those influential services like Youtube &amp; Twitter where a large number of Chinese people will have chances to view them - and a small hard-core game like EVE online by no means counts an influential service.
---
But most Chinese do get angry when foreigners mentioned "Tiananmen Square  massacre", because most Chinese who live in mainland China believe there was no such "massacre" or "brutal killing of 10s of thousands of peaceful democracy protestors" (We do know there was some incident in Tiananmen Square, but most of us believe the number of people died is  minimum and some of those protestors are not that "peaceful"), so we feel offended when foreigners trying to use those words as evidence to prove that we come from a "bad country".
---
(Note that I'm not here to debate whether those "massacres" are real or not. I'm just trying to explain why many Chinese people get angry because of it)
---
Every day's a school day! :D

It can be Pay2Win if you have a loot -&gt; Really a lot of monies.

For now its old school MMO with tons of grinding and probably everyone ingame is praying for CCP to avoid Blizzard WoW route with making game for casual nobrain kid's.

Sounds like he's just scamming people honestly, might be worth looking into twitch rules or contacting staff to make sure it's all good. Also are you sure he's partnered and not just affiliate? Not a huge difference, especially from the viewer side but it is easier to obtain affiliate status.
---
Haven't watched the channel but only thing that bothers me is him taking views/time from other eve content creators by dangling the carrot of "free" stuff.
---
It brings out the shitlords time after time. If that's not entertaining I don't know what is. Killing entosis frigates I guess.
---
It means "Didn't you call yourself '**The winners**' ?".
---
Back to those old days, Chinese players in Serenity, especially those from PIBC, tended to laugh at those who migrate to TQ and call them " '**Losers**' who are afraid of PIBC and have to flee to TQ".

Snuff will move close and farm them with titans vs t1 cruisers until they go back into Serenity.

Yes, Serenitys biggest alliance is joining tranqulity as new players, there will be tons of small ship pvp

Which you get round by doing giveaways based on time in chat, you get partnered off the view count and get that sweet revenue for doing basically nothing.

stream would be fun at least. for a minute or two

Decided to click the link and check out his stream for myself. I happened to come in to the stream as he was ranting about this Reddit post. He started addressing a few points in the post, admitting to some and refuting others saying his job had been taking up a lot of his time, which is why he hasn't gotten around to it. He mentioned that the reason he looks AFK during his steam is because he streams while at work......
---
At the end of it he basically said it was bullshit and that he was triggered and told his mods to ban anyone posting about it because it was a "hate post".  He promised to give out some of the more expensive prizes people had been waiting on during the stream sometime today.

This is how you make money in eve: After the battle, loot the field and salvage in cheap, expendable probes. 1.5B profit in 1 hr.

There are plenty of groups you can start with as a new player. No need to wait for such a group. 
---
Btw, those 'new' players you are hoping to play with have flown titans as if they are frigates for longer than you can imagine.

Good luck to them. I hope their as fun to fight as FRT are!

See here is a thread you have knowledge to share!!!

But how would you know you can't play eve for 2 years.

I notice you failed to mention arty shells.

Since lasers don't count as projectiles, why did you exclude the minmatar ammo huh?
---
Is that how you have played since being in central Russia?
---
sad..

So creative. Love the style.

Wow!!!! Have you spoken to the central African missionaries as well.  
---
#FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE HERE FOKES!!!
---
Ah so thats why there was a test fc leading voltron’s fleet.
---
Why would someone downvote your Statement I found it factually correct.  Are you a CEO of a large marketable corporation as well as what else you claim to be?
---
Yes you can pay to buy your ships but none of it matters since you wont know the games mechanics.. 
---
So it dosent matter  the amount someone pays to win. Just means they actually probably dont know what their doing.
---
That being said if you do start playing specialize yourself into something you like doing like tackle(finding and pining down targets for your fleetmates to kill.
---
That being said eve is like nothing else if your into space sims, ever played the X series, even are just into big fleet fights or being a lone explorer its probably for you. But eve is tough.. But not punishing in most cases. Lol as the old frizzle says ask questions make mistakes and get messy. The community is like no other find your corp and stick with it. A lot of newbro corps accept you on day 1 so you have access to their collective knowledge. But there are a lot of trolls and scammers tho but thats a side effect of how free eve is.. So be wise.. If something is to good to be true it probably is. And dont use the trade window.. Like ever unless your FC tells you to lol.
---
Hope you join us, its a world like no other. Theres a reason it got put in the Smithsonian. o7 fly safe.

https://youtu.be/qa31nDBsUJI  They dominated Serenity in ways we haven't even attempted on our server.
---
More and more I think they need to add a few more regions of space.
---
Except disable the ability to bring in / build supers, and make citadels have fewer RF timers.

Kinda like a wormhole, but with traditional stargate based navigation and normal upgradable resources.

I havent tested this personally but with some good flying its supposed to work.
---
1) only people in their timezone can shoot them
---
2) claiming that plex increasing from 300 to 2b over ten years is the same as the hyperinflation on serenity is beyond idiotic
---
3) claiming that everyone has bots therefore the Chinese get a pass is not a logical conclusion. it is abundantly clear to anyone who looks that Chinese space is far and away the worst, most obvious, most egregious offenders, to the point where their alliance got negwalleted by the absentee father CCP for being so upfront about it
---
you are not arguing in good faith. you are trying to run a damage control campaign to lessen the resistance you and your kind will have when you attempt to destroy our Eve server. 
---
you are the enemy
---
They fucked their own server, people are wary they'll fuck ours too.
---
I for one welcome more bodies.
---
Are we just going to forget how Noraus funded the SRP wallet for months by RMTing big isk?
---
EVE is run by hate, if we got along, there wouldnt be wars.
---
if you cast them as "those evil people", then its easier to declare war on them later on as members will be all for it.
---
meanwhile if you find yourself allying with them, you can just say "oh those claims were exaggerations", and msot are happy to just accept it.
---
its a bit like the Russians and "mail order brides" or "money from oil barons".  not true, but people use it.
---
or Americans and "oil oil oil", "searching for weapons of mass destruction", "gun nuts", and so on.
---
or france and "haha your flag is a white surrender flag, you go faster backward than forward"
---
honestly theres stereotypes like these for everyone. doesn't mean its true....well the vast majority of the time(stereotypes had to start somewhere).
---
the fact theres a large migration of players incoming, jsut means they'll get more attention with the stereotypes than others.
---
if we had a large number of japanese suddenly joining the server, we'd see a ton of posts of "pedos, weebs, hentai".  again, doesnt mean its true. just stereotypes to create hate to justify later wars.
---
Botting
---
Yeah. That question knocked quite a few tables out of the running. Most people thought Cerberus as well.
---
Everyone pretending EVE is fun to watch PvP is barley above afk mining when watching for entertainment
---
Wow, what a nazi.
---
Anytime!
---
Anyway, there seems to be a market to start teaching Chinese. haha
---
For point 1, that is not something you can blame them for. It’s not like you can blame AU TZ guys either. Also, they show up around US TZ nights (their morning). So you can most certainly shoot at them. For point 2, please look at my edit. And for point 3, I cannot comment on the negwallet, but I haven’t seen more botters in FRAT space than any other space. I’d like to see how it’s abundantly clear that the Chinese bot more on TQ. If you have any proof, it would be greatly appreciated.
---
There better be jal-lap-pen-oh in the cheese spread too
---
I love how you act like ccp is tough on botters
---
I wish we lived in that reality too, but..... pa
---
Didnt see a cyno, but that changes nothing really. The subcap damage is ridiculous. The useless nerf was indeed useless. CCP keeps failing us.
---
Some sexual relations only.
---
You are adapting by avoiding the problem. Apparently creating less content is what CCP wants.
---
because our server is 100% not 2 blocs controlling everything right now like it is in serenity.
---
Chinese are easy to trash because the chinese government IRL is such a shitshow. Just like how people trash Americans for “haha school shooting” or “lol blowing up brown people”, now us Americans finally have a group of people that are under a government worse than us. Except the russians, but eve players have been memeing russians for years.
---
If they start botting or fuck up the server, all we need to do is simply unite and fuck them up until they can't log-in anymore and have no space to live.
---
Dude, don't worry too much about it, you've already done so much for us.

how do i dislike someones comment twice?
---
Regarding the third point:  if you open a killmail in-game that you were neither the aggressor nor the victim in, nothing will happen automatically.  However, if you click in the upper-left corner of the killmail and click "copy external killmail link", you can go to the Post section on zKillboard and manually add the killmail that way.
---
Looks like it would need a mid grade crystal set + blue pill to run it comfortably.
---
Could work without those if you know how to fly your ship really well
---
Thats not the only problem on serenity though
---
People just don't understand the rules for botting were different.
---
Botting isnt going to skyrocket just because they switch servers
---
It must be just a certant rat or atleast the ones in gates, yes?
---
A lot of it has to do with the engagement envelope of the "standard" Kestrel, which is pretty narrow compared to a lot of ships you encounter in FW space nowadays.  I've seen some people have success with a 400mm plate/dual web one, where the second web gives you more control over the ranges involved in the engagement.
---
But, generally speaking, buffer-fit ships will struggle against ships that beat them both in terms of DPS application (drones, missiles, rails, etc) and DPS overall (Kestrel with heat only ekes out ~140ish, which isn't too hard to beat).
---
How does it feel having Sabre A back on the team.

---
What was the reason FRT Chinese players left the Chinese server?
---
&gt;We all love this game some way or another so it's not like the Chinese want to ruin it again. Give them the benefit of the doubt. Besides, we can also be welcoming. It's 1500+ new dudes to shoot at, that's not something you can just get in EVE.
---
No. They have proven they will fuck up the game. The more chinese, the more chinese-like the server becomes.
---
&gt;Serenity was run by TianCity, a shit corporation that only reaped in the profits. 
---
I can think of another company that seems to want the same thing.
---
Yeh, i am dubious of it. It deffo needs blue pill, but i was told i wouldnt need crystals. 
---
I dont have Cal Cruiser V to test it though.
---
Amarr militia won't usually shoot you, but you're better off in a corp that can back you up.
---
The boss of frt said the wallet is negative by 1.5 T isk because of the ccp confiscated isk from botting.
---
1500 new real player is good for TQ. Ccp must handle more the bot problem.
---
oof. I´m sorry to hear.
---
REDUCTIO!
---
With the amount you talk to yourself I think you should go get yourself checked.
---
&lt;you and your kind&gt;
---
Easy now
---
I’m curious what sections of null are unoccupied?  Or would they need to evict space forcefully once they are ready to move from lowsec.
---
Also how many years until their fresh accounts are able to contend with other large alliances.
---
I know karate. I know jujitsu. I drive like a gangster when I'm coming to farm you.
---
yeah you dont need crystals but they help just in case. I'd recommend taking the missile application drug too if you're worried.
---
the only one i didn't know was Loki's father
---
Others have said it.
---
Report him on Twitch for not monitoring his chat, engaging with users and setting up false rewards to scam people.  
---
Done.
---
Always would take that with any Hams just in case anyway. I#ll get round to testing on test server when it resets so i can grab some Skill extractors.

This entire thread is just lip service. Hyperinflation here we come bois

Last week, on April 8 2019, we announced the permanent banning of  Brisc Rubal and their ejection from the Council of Stellar Management.  We also issued one-year bans to two other players involved in this  incident and confiscated their associated in-game assets and ISK.
---
Following  this statement, we have held further discussions with the affected  parties. We have also been conducting an internal review to substantiate  the evidence available to us and evaluate our handling of the  situation. We intend to share a full follow-up statement next week.
---
Transparency,  fairness and trust is of utmost importance to us, which is why we’re  issuing this brief update while also taking the time to ensure that we  conduct a thorough investigation. We understand that there are many  questions lingering over the incident, and we want to assure you that we  take this matter very seriously. Both the sanctity of the CSM and the  relationship we have with our players is of paramount importance to CCP.
---
As  should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any  mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate  reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken.
---
lol and where are you from?
---
Posted 2 days ago?
---
Your allies will also bait you to death. Eg.
---
\- amarr militia pilot enters your plex or the fight happens on a gate and you have a suspect timer or killright etc
---
\- minus 10 security pilot in the same fleet with your ally jumps in
---
\- they put up a mock battle
---
\- you approach and suddenly you have a scram on you as the pirate burned directly on you with mwd because he wasn't scrammed even though you saw he was scrammed previously
---
\- your allied pilot can also simply be a disguised logi / booster etc
---
Personally I've taken more economic damage from amarr allies than enemies so I just left fw. I advice you don't even join it unless you're in it for the isk. As neutral you have more free targets anyway.

---
To me it has very little to actually do with botting and a lot to do with the notion that this is an alliance will apparently do whatever it takes to "win", to the point of literally wiping new eden clean of all significant resistance to the point of their server becoming a barren stagnant wasteland bereft of virtually all content. They literally blued and consolidated to the point where their primary adversary trashed their ships and biomassed rather than try to play the game against them. 
---
This is the group that is moving to our server - and in the context of the similar entities already here which seem to have no qualms about forming big megablobs that kill content, I think many of us are weary that the addition of PIBC will just swell the already huge blue donut that is imperial legacy.
---
I spent 5 hours last night roaming through the least populated systems in The Citadel (according to Dotlan) and made 10M isk. I got a single escalation from a combat site which yielded a 700k c-type module and I netted another 2M from 5 different faction ammo drops. Am I doing something wrong, or am I just unlucky?
---
Too late, mate.
---
You missunderstand what he is doing. He is actually scamming people into watching his stream which he turns into profit (see " The guy just got partnered by Twitch."). So, it is classic eve game play. Not my game play but hey vOv
---
Railguns were just the most EVE-y thing I could think of on short notice. I wasn't trying to exclude anyone's favorite faction. Note that I didn't say that the ONLY thing that crosses cultural boundaries was rails, just that they do.  
---
Also, technically photons are both particles and waves, so they'd count as projectiles.
---
You're late, go away
---
What a little turd chomper, you're late by two days.
---
&gt;Abandon hegemonism, this is a new world. No ultranationalism, it is possible to be enemy with other Chinese.
---
Pitty you didn't learn this before killing your own server.
---
I just asked him if he had a valid mining permit and he deleted my comment and banned me from the chat. I will do the decent thing and report his channel for "streamer is inactive".
---
You're doing something very wrong : They are Hs anomalies/combat sites/escalations. They are not made to be of any worth. If you just want to stay in HS and earn isk, run L4 missions. Otherwise just join a corp outside of HS and do literally anything else because making isk in HS is the most boring and least worth it thing to do in this game.

The tank is enough for level 4 and i never ran into any issues (the nano pump could probably even be replaced with a tech 2 flare rig for better damage projection)
---
The damage + projection is bad bad and bad. 3-5 % damage implants are highly advised and keeping your drones save for those high ehp ships is a must (like drone battleships and lucid deepwatchers). Also use the explosion velocity booster (crash?). And #1: faction webs... The 14km webs should be minimum otherwise you will not have fun.
---
Who?

Ah, I had no idea! Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Lol it's irony, it's a joke. I could ask you if you're an autistic kid if you can ask him where he's from.
---
Yes, the rules for botting were different. But because of those rules, many of these players now have botting programs installed on their pcs and know how to use them. A bunch of them also have experience in developing botting programs.
---
Does that mean that they will now also use and develop more botting programs than westerners do? Not necessarily. PIBC claims they are against botting. But then again so do all other alliances. In the end, we'll have to wait and see to know for sure, but in the meantime it's not unreasonable for someone to assume that it's a likely possibility. And it's in those people's right to go shoot PIBC's new alliance, just as much as it's anyone's right to go and defend them.

---
Have you interacted with the Chinese in any other game before? Shooters, mobas, MMOs, literally anything?
---
There's a reason they are universally despised in those games. They have a completely different culture and approach to gaming.

Is it just me, or does anyone else see an unholy alliance of Dinos, Bees, and Viruses banding together to crush the invaders?
---
I do nag-lll-far or nag-luh-far

You can say what you want about ccp but they actually do a lot against botting. 
---
Some people are always going to cry about something.

---
it didn't worry me then, and it worries me even less now.
---
see, even the chink gets it
---
So migrating over... Does all ofbtheor stuff, sp, etc migrate too, or is it all starting from scratch?
---
The Serenity migrants are not feared because of their ethnicity. They are feared because of their (online/internet spaceships) culture.
---
This is what appears to go way over peoples' heads (intentionally, maybe?) We're not (well, most of are not) screaming racial slurs, saying the catch-all of "the Chinese are coming" is just a shorthand for "Serenity players are coming."
---
I've got no beef with Chinese players in general, pandas are cool, you guys do whatever to fit into the TQ meta. Part of that meta is that, yes, every alliance/coalition/bloc wants more blue space, but in the end they want content as well, and crushing your enemy beyond resistance torches that part of the game.
---
PIBC did that in their server, and it logically follows there's a chance they could try it here. That's the fear -- the 50/50 chance they go down the fork in the road where they don't play by our rules, but instead just flip us off and try roflstomping everybody as quickly as they can.

Mmm I doubt the hatchet can be buried between goons and panfam. More likely the new alliance will be relative underdogs for a while and look to blue one side or the other.

Ah, so rather decent I come for hisec still can’t compete with anything in null?
---
no.    Panfam is still pissed at the dinos.
---
and Horde and karmafleet remain "happy" enemies (aka no real grudges, but htey refuse to work together as they like having a forever enemy).
---
right now, its basically Panfam and Frat   vs Goons and Goonpet Test.

i don't see this changing soon. if anything. frat will absorb them and grow stronger. but it wont give panfam/frat enough to beat goons.

Our plex prices would be the same when there weren't wars earlier in the game. If TQ would have been so peaceful as it is today over the 10 years we would have such prices too just becasue everyone would krab.

They start from scratch.

you're retarded in every possible way

People think serenity went up and everyone started botting so the plex prices exploded. Serenity rarley has big wars so the majority of time they krab, TQ would be the same if there weren't many wars in the 10 year history.
---
I can't tell how many layers of irony that flair is
---
Sure, but he's hit the head of the nail with those words right there. It's simply the cultural difference between the Chinese and the rest of the world. China views cheating and other forms of external assistance as a legitimate way to succeed because they will do anything in their power to win. They run rampant in other games and cheat because they *don't know that it's wrong*.

CCP couldnt ban anyone there at all because the chinese server isn't run by CCP
---
Personally, the Chinese royally screwed their own servers. Our economy on our servers is already having a rough time, and the last thing we need is for the Chinese to come in and royal fuck our servers up too. I say they should just start over their own crap and do again, leave us alone.

Yes indeed. It was a rhetorical question. It’s amazing this OP is surprised by the fact a lot of us don’t want this to happen. Their server turned to absolute shit because of the players and to a certain extent ccp/netease.
---
is your country such a shithole you can’t get keyboard with the right apostrophe?
---
they not allowed to ban people on chinese server, as its under a different producer.
---
but on our server.  gloves are off. CCP can ban any.   and chinese government wont care as technically they using a VPN to get around the firewall built to stop them doing that.
---
First a 64-bit client and then 4K textures can be a thing.
---
I'm a firm believer that CCP should prevent the Chinese from taking over our server. Period.

why does ccp hate good things

better be careful bud you're gonna get called a nazi

I highly doubt that as well, but if a common enemy is created out of the new bloc then we would more than likely see a mega-coalition to combat them.

Yea. Or just remove caps from LS, or make them "travel only" don't let them activate any modules other then for travel through. Double this in FW systems, but LS as a whole.
---
german LUL you probably got put on the tradesman path in schcool cause you’re too retarded to go to uni
---
This is probably the best comment I've ever read about Pandemic Legion. I applaud you and your analogies, sir.
---
Trying to apeeze the masses after killing their game
---
sweet, can still be used to get away, but a welcome nerf
---
i went straight to the HJ tbh
---
Thank you for explaining that makes more sense now.
---
Holy smokes you are 2 days late and someone already posted this an hour ago.
---
oh yeah i bet you did bub
---
Another reposta
---
o/
---
Cmon man, you really thought this hadn’t been posted yet?
---
I have nothing against the Chinese in general, it's not a racial thing. It's just that they have already screwed their own servers, why on earth would we allow them on ours?
---
CCP hates ecm confirmed?
---
&gt;This game is better with more people.
---
Yea. But don't confuse accounts with people. Regardless if its bots or multiboxed / AFK cancer or whichever of these, also don't forget this sort of shit makes many actual people quit, not play and be replaced with cancer accounts.
---
If goons went all out on them they can erase them
---
Interesting. How often does CCP nerf things vs make them more powerful? I keep seeing all these nerfs but not so many boosts.
---
Hasn't this already been shared though?
---
Yeah, I always tell people to leave safety on yellow, there's really no reason to be red (unless you're deliberately trying to suicide gank of course).
---
nooooooo, the dank tears! won't somebody think of the dank tears! :-(
---
So will it be 20 seconds cycle with 5 seconds jam or 5 seconds cycle? The latter would be a qol change...sort of.
---
Hmmmm you can use WINE if you like. I find the N.E.A.R. tool to work really well for me.
---
&gt;snuff vs chinaman  
---
&gt;lets see how this goes
---
I forsee a lot of Nyxes dropping on a lot of botting frigs whenever and wherever possible. They kinda deserve each other.
---
We don't hate the chinese. We hate the bot-heavy residents of serenity moving to TQ and we fear they will bring those bots with them. The fear is that they will ruin TQ the way they ruined SY. If they prove everyone wrong and the economy doesn't go into the shitter, then the hubub will die down and they will find welcome friends. If TQ goes the way of the Chinese server, Eve suffers and probably dies.
---
Yes, we have bots (and too many of them) but serenity IS bots.
---
😂
---
Booshing requires red safety, so does killing pods in lowsec iirc.
---
you mean the outdated video's that in no way give any representation on the current state of the game?
---
Chinese is not a race.
---
WTF? Now we sort of like you again...
---
I'm with you, just advising you of the consequences of openly admitting you hold a reasonable opinion
---
the masses dont care about ecm drones, cuz the masses dont pvp outside of mashing f1
---
it's not about new material.
---
people won't work with people they dislike, so it won't happen.
---
Eh, now all they need to do is nerf sensor strengths that make some ships all but unjammable and ECM will finally be balanced.
---
ccp overbuffs things all the time
---
see: ramjag
---
supers/carrier post cap changes
---
rorquals (though then they got a fat couple of nerfs thankfully)
---
I was talking about the last video they did about Serenity
---
Thank you thank you :) I appreciate it. :)
---
I really don't understand why there isn't a buffer shield equivalent of the damnation
---
Haha! Everyone laugh at the brony! 😄
---
I think N.E.A.R. is what you're looking for.
---
Yep. http://sheet.new works great for that exact purpose. It’s an amazing app that works for all sorts of things, like industry or intel.
---
If the health of the entire game is in jeopardy, I would hope they could put their shit on pause to handle it.
---
On the bright side, once plex becomes expensive enough maybe CCP will finally pick their heads out of their asses as having to run a farm of 100 alpha bots is easier to spot then running 10 omega bots. Of course by that time it will be too late because of how many people will leave the game cause of this shit, but hey...
---
5s jam cycles? I am already getting cramps from spamming lock with my battleship size vessel's scan resultion
---
War is good for business. Maybe they improve the economy if they play righteously?
---
Ohhh yep! You're right. Thanks for that bit of info. I guess the human side of us always tries to look at the negative. I think CCP does do a decent job of actually listening to what us players want and need.
---
TQ is quite fucked tbh. Good of Goons to not swing the titan dickhammer.
---
&gt;it's not a racial thing  
---
&gt; why on earth would we allow them on ours
---
its good to know you am still playing tho ^^
---
that's a buff, not a nerf.
---
Hmmm. I'd have no problem with it if the Chinese decided to play by the rules and make the game better than when they came to it. &lt;3
---
that is very loud friend i hope u r okay tho and have fun :)
---
I do nazi your ability to post here continuing.
---
cant wait for ~~2b~~ ~~3b~~ 5b isk injectors
---
you are the reason people have to put /s on the most obviously sarcastic statements.
---
https://i.imgur.com/8xmRqKM.png
---
How did goons go from encouraging scamming to calling the iceland cops for illegal video game gambling and reporting afk streamers.
---
you mean by his black cards?
---
&gt;Wow, if the Chinese hold true to the talking points about not supporting rmt/botting or ultranationalism, they might be like the better version of eve russians.
---
Your hopes and beliefs about PIBC are quite a lot like Tyrion's Lannisters hopes and beliefs about Queen Cercei sending her army to help fight the undead in the north.
---
This, and the prefix "pod-" has the meaning of "underness."
---
Public ansiblex? 10M isk per jump?
---
Sounds good.
---
And you sound naive. [99% of cheaters banned in PUBG are from China.](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/16/99-of-pubgs-banned-cheaters-are-from-china) You can close your eyes and pretend that you're better than facts all you want, but you'll just look like a fool.
---
It is an ethnicity though, so take your meretricious pedantry and forcibly insert into your fecal orifice.
---
Nah, i think its a liamllik.
---
So the solution to fixing eve is more caps, more cynos, and higher subcap damage?
---
Taking out the competition, business 101
---
If you dont think our server wouldnt be just as bad as theirs you are mistaken.
---
Theirs only got so bad because Netease didn't enforce any botting standards. 
---
Yeh theres a cultural thing, but lets be real, If Goons,Test,Panfam could bot without repercussion they would absolutely do it.
---
... what?
---
I'm having a great time in EVE right now, really enjoying myself. Finally got myself a Nyx, a Naglfar and several coalition doctrine ships ready to go out on roams to have a blast. Got new skins for a lot of my ships too which you can check out here  https://imgur.com/a/ye129fS . All in all, I'm having a fantastic time, can't wait for the weekend. Have a good one folks :)
---
He specifically said "jam duration", so cycle time is untouched.
---
i think making the connection that if an entirely homogeneous population hardcore turbo bots on their server and suddenly the same entirely homogeneous population moves server it's fair to assume that they are gonna turbo bot just the same
---
But how do they say gila?
---
&gt;Do they bot hard like most of the people who moved over? Do they bring some fresh air and go in? Do they want the challenge of not having to bot?
---
Even if they truly take an official stance and the leadership gets serious, due to game mechanics there is just no way for them to pay attention and police line members, and lets face it, for reasons everyone knows already that have been mentioned countless times in countless places already, the rank and file members are far more prone to botting then any other group.
---
I hope whatever you download reformats your hard drive
---
Shit I'll fit up a bunch of cats and hand them out to anyone willing to go gank this dude repeatedly. Who's keen?
---
It sounds like the cycle time will stay the same, but the duration of the jam will go down to 5s instead of 20.
---
Ahah, didnt even have to look at the zkillboard to know who it is.
---
WELCOME
---
Help us break up our BLUE null.
---
I am, I'm sorry. I don't know why I do things like this. Just feel the need to turn everything into a joke. I deserve my down votes.
---
I'm good with the super caps.  I think that looks pretty cool.
---
Mino/Naglfar though. That shit is trash.
---
in that case, they're exactly as useful after the change as they are now. so it's a mostly irrelevant change.
---
Nice try at deflection
---
good. should have happened 10 years ago. thx dedicated balancing team.
---
however u want to interpret it. i am just translating.
---
I think you've commented on the wrong post my friend. But instead of giving such a negative review of the fits, how about you share your own so we can all enjoy what Eve has brought us?
---
Get downvoted amarrvictor

---

---
yikes bro lmao
---
the statement leaves room for interpretation...guess we have to wait for confirmation
---
next thing i know youll be posting fbi crime statistics out of context too
---
Still more useful... assuming you're even nearly aligned, 5 seconds is long enough.
---
Everybody who isn't 'l33t' hates ecm
---
This thread you're commenting on is about being able to view ships from within a station. If that doesn't help you, then I'm completely lost on what you're even talking about, as it has absolutely nothing to do with this thread.
---
Well, then CODE should enforce their mining permit policy!
---
Thats not what i said at all, just pointing out that the game didnt lose content, it just moves around.
---
But yeh, i'd rather see caps nerfed, i dont think fighter bombers should apply any damage to cruisers and cruisers should be able to deal with fighters fairly easily.
---
And I said that I'm ok with how supercaps look inside a station, but the Mino/Naglfar look like shit.
---
Are you fucking retarded?
---
Seems like a little too much, now they are only useful to warp away and nothing else... not that you could permajam someone with them before, but it did give room to a little more options.
---
Absolutely right.  This should be a priority for CCP (re-working station interiors).  Ship spinning is one of the best things about Eve.
---

Botting killed their economy. Aside from that one of the blobs grew so large they became unassailable and took over most of the game via unstoppable titan blob.
---
We all know XIX RMTd out a lot of ISK, doesn't make it any better that Fraternity is an alliance that credit carded their SRP wallet at $5/b from members of a wealthy wormhole alliance.
---
No sir, you're right. I admit my blunder there :). I had made two posts, and the way your post was worded it looked as though you were responding to a different thread I had posted regarding skins. My bad.
---
How do you know he's viewboting ?
---
Apparently the two intel warning optical devices attached to the front of your face don’t work so you should probably just not play EVE.
---
You dont think balance can be damaging to the content because it just "moves". Then you dont have to fix anything. Convenient.
---
Go ahead and call me Rudolf Hess then, i dont like the chinese. Had enough run-ins with them so far to justify it.
---
yes, i pointed that out 2 posts ago.
---
Are you fucking serious he got the twitch partner thing ? I burst my ass and hours creating shit like this [https://www.twitch.tv/warden50/clip/GrossLuckyEndiveSquadGoals](https://www.twitch.tv/warden50/clip/GrossLuckyEndiveSquadGoals) trying to engage with my viewers and everything... and after all you have to do is promise some fake rewards ? Dayum I might be old or some shit 'cause I dont get it.
---
&gt;It is an ethnicity though, so take your meretricious pedantry and forcibly insert into your fecal orifice.
---
How cute! You don't actually have a point to argue so tell me to shove it in my ass. What's happened to you, mate?
---
You don't hear people saying "Those fucking Japs" or "Goddamned Korean players" or "Kill the Indian corps out of the game". the people of one single country are being pointed to. 
---
More than that, the issue is people are complaining about an even more specific group: the population of a server that is now trashed by the people being complained about. 
---
If anything, we're being shard-ist.
---
BTW, You are thinking of the Han ethnicity, not the Chinese. Manchu and Uyghurs are other ethnicities within China (the latter being in the news because the Han-run Chinese government is basically trying to exterminate their way of life). There are many others.
---
Good change.
---
How do you misunderstand or misrepresent the statement "99 % of people banned are from one population segment"? I mean, it what other context can that be taken?
---
Why do you consider this to be out of context?  Just because it's a different game that isn't EVE?  That was addressed in the previous comment where he talks about the cheating that's rampant in games specifically from Chinese players, so it's fairly in context with what's being said.  Is there something else that would make it out of context?
---
hello :)  what is your fit?
---
Nerfing is actually the way to go if you want balance. In many cases, buffing results in powercreep.
---
Botting on a server that allows botting doesn't necessarily mean they'll bot on a server that doesn't allow it (any more than any other player from around the world is likely to bot anyway).
---
Nazi is the currently trendy word to use when you don't agree with someone. The fact is, what he stated does not sound like what a Nazi would say. They would agree with the sentiment of ultra-nationalism and victory at any cost.
---
Jesus christ you are thick.
---
It must be easy for you to "win" arguments in your head as you just completely make up what the other persons point is.
---
Also you do realize a nerf to one thing is a buff to the other...
---
Embrace the negative! If they keep nerfing, eventually we get more choice and fights that actually happen!
---
I do, yessir :)
---
That makes sense to me :)
---
Oh, yes, you could permjam someone.
---
Null sec are only bitter because there's a new group who can out-krab them.
---
Again, using the trendy Nazi word to decry someone doesn't make it an apt statement or application here.
---
&gt; from my experiences in FRAT, the amount of botters vs real players is just like any other nullsec bloc i've been in
---
This is excuse #1 for botting. imo it doesn't matter if you have more or less the same amount of bots than any other alliance it just makes them bot harboring alliances. The amount of blatant botting in Frats renter alliance is ridiculous. And don't ever come with: "its hard to detect" or "only CCP can do something about it"...
---
Got one example for you:  [https://evewho.com/corp/Third+New+Universe](https://evewho.com/corp/Third+New+Universe)
---
They are direct descendant of the infamous  [https://evewho.com/corp/WE+LOVE+WEST+WORLD](https://evewho.com/corp/WE+LOVE+WEST+WORLD) (if anyone remembers them)
---
They used a couple of corps in the meantime ( [https://evewho.com/corp/Cute+Cat+Little+House](https://evewho.com/corp/Cute+Cat+Little+House)  [https://evewho.com/corp/BeeBeeBeeFederal](https://evewho.com/corp/BeeBeeBeeFederal)  [https://evewho.com/corp/The.Ring](https://evewho.com/corp/The.Ring) ) to just name a few of which all got removed or either left their alliance and moved the unbanned accounts to the next botting corp.
---
If you dont believe me:  [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Wicked\_Creek/4F89-U/YHEN-G/G063-U/Z-A8FS#npc24](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Wicked_Creek/4F89-U/YHEN-G/G063-U/Z-A8FS#npc24) 
---
Those 4 systems got 8 vni bots each and between 1 and 3 salvaging bots running from 00:00 till downtime including intel bots 1 jump out in each direction. So they are difficult to hunt by me since i am EU TZ.
---
They operate for a few months already and expanded during that time (for example when The.Ring got removed from goons and they moved their characters over). 
---
Also 100% tax rate...
---
Btw they are chinese botter since i had a few conversation with them and yeah they moved through a lot of different alliances not just fraternity.
---
I never really saw eve as a QOL kind of game
---
I know English speakers who still call a DCM a suitcase.  That one wasn't unique to russians.
---
Is content ever lost because balance is shit?
---
I agree. One of the most frustrating things for me was when I got my Nyx and the Police skin. I wanted to check that thing out, but the Nyx is only viewable up and down, not full 360, and only shows the top of the ship and one single side. I had to undock my Supercarrier just to get a good look at the skin.
---
i think the nighthawk as no dps and no tank
---
Super nope.
---
&gt; So I've always heard abotu this game but never really cared that much about it, but it's starting to get my attention, could I get a TL;DR on what this game is and is it Pay2Win?  
---
Thanks. 
---
Yes. Game is P2W now at least for any higher end activity. AT the low end its still ok, but at high end you will not be able to function without playing multiple accounts at the same time, some corps won't even let you join them unless they verify your accounts and playing them. If you do not multibox you will never be able to fully enjoy any of the higher end stuff in the game on a decent level, sure, you run into an occasional oddball here and there but majority of people are not such oddballs. This is a form of P2W #1. 
---
In addition, Eve Online is built and designed from the ground up to support multiple accounts and lots of very easily scriptable activities that can often be done AFK or semi-AFK without much trouble or any scripts running in the first place. This is CCPs business model. Kinda like CIG sells jpgs of ships in SC for 100s or even 1000s of $$$, CCP is focused on multi accounts instead. To boot, the game is fucking overran with AFK multiboxed shits and bots. According to CCP, posted a few weeks ago, there is average of 1.6 accounts per playing player in the game. That translates roughly to 1 out of 3 people that you run into in the game is not an actual person, it is either an AFK shit or an outright complete bot. Add to that, there used to be a server called Serenity (still kinda is technically ?), and the shits on there botted themselves to shit, to the point where the server has died and now they are all coming here to Tranquility. This is of course welcome news by CCP because more short term $$$ from the P2W mechanics cause now the $$$ can go directly to them instead of Netease taking its cut.
---
Second form of P2W are skill injectors. If you want to take 2-3 years per character and can / would like to pay out of pocket for your accounts, then you do not need injectors, thus the game is not P2W. However, any sane person with half a brain nowadays can not wait this long, thus buying plex and selling it on the market to obtain skill injectors is a thing, and it is straight up P2W. How much P2W varies on how much time you would like to cut down on. It could be as little as $200 to as much as $1000 per character.
---
You can of course get some serious VPN set up and VMs and a half decent bot and grind all the ISK necessary yourself. Otherwise as a single starting account or alpha, GFL. 
---
Your financial support is very welcome by CCP.
---
I have no idea what amarrvictor is. Oh no my fake internet points! Dont downvote me!!!

Wait... why do you put an ESS on a WH?

Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass on that one Charles...

When people jump through it in local it will tell me they came from the wormhole and not a login trap or gate jump. It's great for intel.
---
 20s duration, 5s jam
---
Yes, this is correct.
---
I have 10+M SP but pretty slim on small missiles and rockets skills. Flying Tristans is getting boring. Should I start flying a Worm (2-ish days to train), or should I get the relevant missiles skills all to 4+ first? Do not plan to fly with implants, since Worm would be completely new to me I expect to die in many of them. One day I would like  Rattlesnake. And sometime in the future, to fly torpedo stealth bomber. Thx for opinion... o7
---
It will be 20s duration, 5s jam
---
Yes, why not? And why not popping-up a window that shows what kind of wormhole is, if there is anybody at the other side, if he/she is a good pvper, and why not, just allowing you to close that wormhole if it bothers you with just one click of your mouse, so we, the wormholers, don't bother your VNIs anymore, and we can uninstall Eve quietly.
---
Is there any actual article about this or is it just here-say?

Anyone else see the irony of a guy named after a deranged terrorist trying to virtue signal?

Why does everybody want Stain Guys crown?

Of course, i never claimed otherwise.
---
&gt;How cute! You don't actually have a point to argue so tell me to shove it in my ass.
---
My point is that hiding behind word games doesn't change the truth and you know it, and you know I know it.
---
&gt; Note that I'm not here to debate whether those "massacres" are real or not.
---
Good, because they inarguably were.
---
I can’t wait to meet these fine and wonderful people :-).
---
Well, yes, but the chances were far too little... hell, most of the time the little fuckers wouldn't do shit.

Just post your location in the channel "Bringing Solo Back" and you'll find out about your nearby pirates.

It comes down to whether the container was anchored in space or not, password-wise. Secure containers that can be anchored I don't think are able to be password protected unless they are anchored and past the anchor timer.

But mah plex tho.
---
PL and Goons have worked together multiple times throughout eves history when the threat was perceived as large enough to both groups
---
Oh I like that one, that's a pretty sweet skin for a Nyx
---
Not quite true, they know its wrong, they just don't care. 
---
And theres plenty of Chinese people that dislike it, and the Government is even trying to mitigate it with real life consequences to cheating in videogames.
---
What I know is your virtue signaling is tedious. Would it be helpful if I pat you on the head and congratulate you for being a tolerant fellow?
---
Feel better? Your moral superiority has now been acknowledged, even though you're wrong on the facts.
---
I bet you dont think you're a racist cunt...but you most definitely are

Here's the one I'm using for my Nyx at the moment, the Police skin. I need to take it out for a spin and get a better pic than this of it though.  [https://i.imgur.com/nh1SoiW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nh1SoiW.jpg)

---
They must really hate it because ECM modules took a huge kick in the dick a while back, now ECM drones... not complaining by any stretch, but  75% nerf on jam time is p big.    I didn't realize they jam for that long.
---
One day you're "venturing in LS" and catching scourge rockets to the chin every time you stray from the gates. The next, you make a decision to be either one of two types of Eve players...  
---
Type one: buy scourge rockets for you and your spacefriends. happy hunting! still get blown up and wisely choose FW combats. PvE in LS is just someone else's fun because they get to drop on you and pop you.  
---
Type two: stay in hisec for months or years and then repeat cycle scenario.
---
I do have to say this Naglfar skin is pretty nice too :)  [https://i.imgur.com/dvStdNo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dvStdNo.jpg)
---
All these armchair economists and experts on the history of the Chinese server while never playing a day on it are funny. 
---
If I was the leader of pibc I'd have my own lake of salty tears already lol. Maybe instead of crying over possibilitys grow a pair and get ready for some dank content. 
---
Also there are tons of guides on how to catch bots for ez kills and isk.
---
You deserve extra wormholes just for posting this. Bob will provide.
---
Pirate Little Helper (PLH) allows you to make notes on characters and gives a ton of intel on what they fly, with who and such.
---
Hmm TIL, tyty
---
I do nazi your ability to post here any continuing
---
k
---
I'm an max skill alpha (ol lady has control of the credit card) and I make out just fine and have funv. I'm happy with what I have access to. I can do a little mining, ratting, hit sites, salvage, exploration, some manufacturing (skill limited), and dabble in the market, attempt some faction warfare.
---
Give it a try as an alpha and work ur way up. It's a good game. I haven't done any play to win. I been in eve for 4 years( with a year break from time to time). 
---
Get a little experience in the game and see how u like it.
---
Im on my phone so no pic :(
---
But Headhunter on the Phoenix is dope.
---
CCP is unable to directly influence player policy on Serenity, but they can ban whoever they like on TQ
---
No worries man, I can wait for the pic later, can't wait to see it :D
---
Ship nodding
---
Made carriers great again!
---
Get premium intel on sigs near you now: "BUY FOR 10 PLEX"
---
If you do the math and your ship and fittings right you can easily cause them to LOSE 8 to 10 times the ISK they spend blowing you up and that's if they solo you. If they come at you, in groups it can easily LOSE many times more than that.
---
Pre Alpha, I used to do something similar in FW. Even if they didn't die it's funny as hell watching some fool chase you around in a Billion Isk Tengu while you're in a nearly naked 400k frigate that didn't even have a cloak. 
---
Hell a couple of times I was able to "call the hounds" in on somebody focused on chasing me about with unfortunate consequences for him or her.
---
Well, can we get a logi drone buff then? I used ECM on my logi simply because it was better for keeping people alive than logi drones are
---
If you're like me (at the moment) then the rest of your life is very, very busy and demanding on your attentions. Moving to Null for the isk unless you've been playing Eve for years at least... Is nothing short of a real, measureable commitment to playing this game.  
---
Nothing wrong with that. Not at all. I've been playing on/off since 2006. So, based on my wisdom... If you have the hours per week to pitch-in for everyone else and most importantly make living in Null worth it... Do it! It's great fun. Very social, as well.  
---
But yah, if you're just too busy but not quite busy enough to logout for months or years... Play the game whatever way keeps YOU interested and don't worry about PLEXing or making tons of isk or anything.  
---
The most fun I have playing Eve right now is on a recovered account from when I was in high school. My one character on that one from 2006, apparently I cared very much to skill into a Caldari missile combat 'toon. Less than 5.5M SP (not a very high-end character). SO MUCH FUN!
---
E-uni's page lists them all
---
Would've rather seen other ewar drones get buffed

ABC ore? Lol of course their was. And minerals like mega and zydrne were actually valuable.  Yes battleships were not expendable, but pretty much everything in eve has been made expendable now. That's a symptom of mineral over supply and inflation. 
---
And pretty much everyone could rat like that. That rats haven't really changed.
---
i welcome our new PIBC chinese friends and hope they stir up some more content   (✿◠‿◠)
---
cause eve (and /r/eve) is filled with a bunch of racist jackasses?
---
Don't fit rlml, 35s reload will kill you easily, the paper dps seems good but counting in reload you can't clear up any cruiser/battleship spawn in time
---
One fed web + navy ham + at least lvl 4 missile supporting skills + 3% implants are enough for application
---
And one more point, the most dangerous room for a t5 dark running Cerberus is full Damavik spawn, in that case quickly find blue cloud; if there is no blue cloud, overheat ab and launchers, kill web first, then wd, then normal, leave neut to last since they dont have rr
---
My white whaleskin
---
To make it seem bigger? 
---
Out of interest are POSes and... Ship maintenance hangars.. Maybe, still a thing? You know the ones that were smaller than the ships they housed
---
Not even that imho. If you jam him and he drops a web off you you wont be able to instawarp anyway. Small ships maybe but big ships wont be able to escape.
---
You co habit with waffles so yes.
---
at this point why not just remove ecm
---
I'm sure they can make the ships seem bigger without making it so that I can't even see the ship at all like the Naglfar and the Apostle/Mino.
---
Agreed, though I have been known to collect the Exoplanet Hunter SKINs for their sheer awfulness.
---
I think the only gameplay avaiable now would be to be aligned out with your destinaton selected, drop the drones and pray for the jam while you hammer the warp.
---
Get in the habit of setting your orbits around fixed points rather than moving targets. Especially since it seems like you're talking about PvE (missions, ratting, combat sites).  
---
Pick out an asteroid you're not currently boring with a laser, a space station module, a (distant) sentry tower, or something you set like a Mobile Tractor Unit. Orbit around those things.  
---
Remember to conduct yourself in combat so that: you're going as fast across the view of enemy weapons as possible (fast enough that their tracking speed may not be fast enough to hit you), while your offense remains in range (apply DPS at all times when committed to fight), without exposing a weakness of your defense (know your tank, play to your tank). Basically. You're still gonna get blown up a lot. But that's the basics of effective combat right there.

how DARE you check MY PUBLIC PROFILE on this WEBSITE that ISN'T an ANONYMOUS MESSAGEBOARD, I will have you know that this is FASCISM and you are BAD for checking my PUBLIC PROFILE with all of my PUBLIC COMMENTS on this PUBLIC WEBSITE.
---
This is one of the few times I'll agree with CODE. This is pretty fucked up.
---
The sarcasm is rich in this comment :-) I love it
---
🥐
---
It's good that the government is actually trying to make a difference!
---
&gt; What I know is your virtue signaling is tedious.
---
Well shit, if I'd known it was required to be entertaining, i'd have embedded some dancing girls and an elephant.
---
Try roam around Okkamon with PLA, they are blobbers, never 1v1, never gf in chat and if you try to engage one of them you'll see 3 garmurs and 8 enyos inside 1 AU coming for you. That's the reason I started to roam elsewhere, they are just cancer.
---
If you note the attributes, DCs are aggressively effective resistance % additions the more EHP of the ship is eroded by damage. They're progressively stronger resists, basically.  
---
So when you think about it that way... it would be quite unbalanced to have the DCs buffed by skilling those ones you mentioned.  
---
Also, you can pretty much only fit one DC. Same reason. Because they're really quite effective, both on cost and fitting needs.
---
Sounds fun
---
That skin is clean af
---
Very rude.
---
Sounds like ur salty because they bring friends maybe you should get some to return the favor.
---
good art

Depending on the jurisdiction you live in (and which one Google Play operates out of), you may be able to ask them to direct you towards any value conversions that would end up giving you a payment method CCP easily accepts.  
---
I would think that if you contact Legal at Google they might be able to transfer your Google Play credit into a cheque mailed to your house OR maybe a Google \*Pay\* credit.
---
Another nerf Brought to you by CCP's daddy Goons
---
i wouldnt put it beyond them tbh
---
Well, the ECM ships could still use some love after this. Rook and griffin navy are in bad shape.
---
Dude that frost one is great. One of my favorites too.
---
i am really having fun since i joined a w-space corp, profits are comming in, and i like the interactions we have with other small wh corps.
---
rolled a hole the other day and found my first ghost site, called a corp-mate and we got all the cans
---
Totally agree man, it looks sick af
---
Really if you get hacked they do nothing?
---
Anything. And I do mean anything... Anything short of an exploit of CCP-designed content is fair game.  
---
Goons = Gordon Goonckos ... Greed is right. Greed it GOOD!
---
I'm at work, so I can't share my favorite, which is the Cold Iron skin on my Paladin... 
---
But I do have [this one](https://imgur.com/ccx4aYp), the breast cancer awareness skin for a Rorqual. I think this was either right before or like the day after the patch for excavators. Can't recall, but I can say I didn't have them :3
---
Not if you hit them with a big temporary EHP nerf then once the stockpiles reach a target level, lift the nerf. Its that simple.

Yo this is like a trailer park slap fight. I don’t even understand why you’re trying to start shit with him when we’re a dead corp and our alliance had to join RC just to get enough fleet members on any given day. Everyone is subject to the need for more dudes because of corps like ours that are 97% inactive. Can you really blame Hedliner for taking in RG? That’s just Eve in 2019, man. 
---
Maybe we’d have a leg to meme on if we had more than like 20 kills this month, and those are all me on like the two days I logged in.
---
Perhaps he's looking for some _alternative facts_
---
Still they will forget about ECM fighters, don't worry }:&gt;           
---
^(ok maybe not now as someone posted about this on reddit )
---
A wise E-6 once told me “just because you’re a hypocrite doesn’t mean you’re wrong.”
---
Perhaps he is a fucking idiot.
---
One does not simply quit eve :D
---
Never been big fan of just making isk, so while nothing big is going on I go into a hiatus
---
You forgot a comma, my dude.
---
Think of Eve like this scenario here...  
---
Q- Can I manipulate the markets by means that are clever but altogether illegal pretty much anywhere IRL?  
---
A- There is no limit. The only limit is how much time and isk (or PLEX) you have at your disposal.  
---
Go join them. You'll figure out something greasy eventually. You're already playing Eve with your eyes open to market opportunities. It's going to be impossible to shut them now.

Aside from having the best roaming FC in the game (Mukk), PL's line members have a B tier FC only capable of amassing 40 man bomber fleets to look up to and their super pilots are at the whim of an FC experiencing an ongoing psychotic episode... Waffles isn't perfect but its a paradise compared to that disaster.

All the Nefantar skins. Was the first skin i ever bought, got it for the nado, not too long before it was discontinued.

What ? Not even a mention of coin-op arcades ? I was my local arcade champ for 2 years straight when Virtua Fighter came out. Thanks for the lack of respect :(
---
Yeah legion was far too inflationary so tokens shot up, blizz turned off the gold fountains in bfa while upping required costs in order to pull that gold out of the market.
---
im happy autz and off-time tzs are going to get a boost! especially if our newfound friends from serenity start off in caldari lowsec :)

in real world news, it was a beautiful day today and i had a nice family walk through the hills behind our home. finally feels like spring has arrived.
---
I'm literally here just trolling mah dood.
---
You must not have been in black rise yet when snuff was there then :D its all the same to me now
---
do you guys have any prominent solo or small gang players/groups, or is it all zerg rush?
---
mah bad, its still morning before full coffee for me.
---
I’m literally here trying to shame my corpmates into logging in a bit mah dude.
---
Except it happened yesterday, are you confused about another time we did similar epic ops?
---
You tried to downplay the broken bullshit.
---
&gt;Well they moved somewhere else in which they create content.
---
You think everybody moves somewhere else and never quits?
---
so if i understand right, every 20 seconds you have a chance of being jammed for 5 seconds?
---
Yes.
---
Fuck no.
---
thx
---
how do you propose we deal with the "chinese question"?
---
&gt;You don't hear people saying "Those fucking Japs"
---
I had a guy at work try to give me a book yesterday because, and I quote "It'll teach you to hate those damn Japanese."
---
This has nothing to do with the game, but I thought the timing was... good. 
---
And no, I didn't take the book.
---
tl;dr meme copypasta about c4 wormhole space

EVE is kill
---
&gt;We will not habour/ tolerate/ protect botters  
---
&gt;We will not RMT

Anyone here watch Game of Thrones ?
---
I'm finding an odd parallel with Cercei's promise to bring her army north to help fight the undead and these statements by TAMA (PIBC?) along with the naive people actually either buying into this shit or subtly trying to troll.
---
So they broke their server and now they coming for "ours"?
---
not that anyone asked me or anything, but the shredded chicken burrito and the chipotle chicken loaded griller are pretty decent
---
&gt;you are not arguing in good faith. you are trying to run a damage control campaign to lessen the resistance you and your kind will have when you attempt to destroy our Eve server.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm okay Goebbels
---
Well okay but the company that was running it at the time lost a lawsuit against a player banned for botting and forced them to reinstate the account. Whether that company was CCP or not is not super relevant.
---
Hey, at least he's still beating doomchinchilla at least in terms of "PL fail-cascade velocity"
---
I cant belive you reach 1k of dps
---
It becomes the only game after a while, one that is very hard to quit. 
---
There is nothing else that has you build from scratch a sand castle only to watch it burn because of one silly mistake. Good luck.
---
They won't be a mega coalition for a while, even if all their players move over. Even if they buy a ton of Plex or rmt isk it'll take time during which they'll need allies to survive.
---
ive been out of town for about 2 weeks now, so no eve for me, but im really excited to come back and join fleets with my friends
---
I'm just making fun of them with my comment. Lol.
---
Try undocking lol.
---
More like just Reek.
---
The other day I asked if Wind Spirit still ran frat and nobody knew who I was talking about :(
---
I don't know how botting kills their economy but wow unstopable titan blob.  Man we should invade their server next
---
If you log in, you’ll see the game is actually still alive, even if there’s no AT this year.
---
HTH
---
Booshing in lowsec? It doesn't give you a criminal timer, does it?

Killing neutral pods in LS does yeah but why would you want to do that? It kills your sec status as well for no gain.

Would you like to know about transversals?

Wow bud.

/r/eve before this announcement: fuck ecm drones and anyone who uses them, they’re too OP
---
/r/eve after this announcement: why do CCP keep destroying all the things that make Eve good????
---
It's 100% from scratch.
---
&gt;Thank you for explaining that makes more sense now.
---
If someone gets pissed off enough they would make a very public blog and post it in a few highly visited and visible places, about how incabale and incompetent Chinese authorities are at stopping illegal use of VPNs and how their lack of capability negatively affects Eve Online and gives Chinese a bad reputation all around. List some details in the blog to bring up some solid examples.
---
They hate "losing face" and would start paying some attention to it.
---
that really comes down to are you comfortable with / able to recoup after loosing a worm or 2. also what are you planing on doing with it?
---
in my personal opinion with as new as i assume you to be i would stick to t1 frigs. you dont have to fly tristans try other t1s. 
---
all in all i think the best thing you could do for your self if you havent already is find a decent corp. if your in one and you think they suck leave find a new one .
---
Would someone be kind enough to link PICB forum/discord/whatever they use? 
---
I travel to China for work and play often, and it would be nice to invite some fellow EVE players out for food and beers.
---
Difficult to move when scrammed and webbed.

Yeah OK. Kid yourself into thinking reza cares about literally any of you while he works his three jobs and your corp transcends into a dead husk of what it was in the project wafflebox days.
---
the fact that you haven't got that rotated slightly so there are 2 slices of banana against the straight bottom edge makes me uncomfortable.

Nope it doesn't but still requires red safety

And cause I like shooting things.

Region locking?

Banning the bots?

Its confirmed on Twitter. 20sec and 5sec.

Everything in cold iron.

Sure. But this post isn't about undocking. It's about being able to view your ship while in the station.
---
What?
---
TEST and Pandemic have a long and storied history of being on the same then opposite sides a lot.
---
PIBC would likely oppose FRT, FRT were their enemy on Serenity.

Why is the rare instance of actually something non-toxic being downvoted on this subreddit?

Keep it up bro your doing well

Most of solo pvp is learning how to fight outnumbered.

Lol you think america and china are equal??

Try protesting in China, speaking out against the govt, being a uighur, and see how far you get.
---
Is there a particular corp that would be best to contact?
---
There's actually more incoming.
---
ECM modules are getting a 65% range nerf in the winter patch. Each ECM module fitting is getting a 10% cpu and grid requirement increase and a 30% cap requirement increase.
---
They are also addressing the number of targets you can lock while equipping ECM to one ship to make it "Fair" for the ship who can only target you. This will also count if you have ECM drones carried in your drone bay.
---
Also all ships are getting a 98% boost in sensor strenght against ecm across the board. This will only apply to ecm.
---
This is only step one im the fight ahaist the 250 blackbird fleets that we have seen so often ingame as CCP want to ease us into the heavy ECM nerfs starting next year.
---
Morelike the devil we know...
---
Rampant botting injects tons of isk into the game devaluing it while rampant mining botting injects tons of minerals/building materials into the game devaluing ship and mod costs. This combined makes everything worth a trivial amount.
---
it is relevant. different company, different country, different rules/laws. but the same players that are coming to TQ now. and color me surprised if they live by our rules and not theirs.
---
Contrary to popular belief, alienating your playerbase and failing to attract new players for the sake of short term profits is not a sustainable business plan.
---
That gila one with flames
---
This is good. Thanks
---
Yeah how dare they try to make money instead of running a tournament that is just for a couple of nerds.
---
j-space best space
---
Again, CCP nerfing exactly where they have to.
---
most of the playerbase don't give a fuck about a tournament that a small handful of entities rely on for income.
---
But Elo doesnt believe in Huginns....
---
Speaking as someone in TEST who has been engaged in combat operations against Frat for more than a year, I don't hate you at all. Actually, after living in your space and doing a bunch of small gang fights against your mission runners in Curse, I'm actually pretty fond of you guys. (Shout out to NEWBEEGOGO for being a fun FC to fight.)
---
I *am* concerned about the botting and RMT that wrecked Serenity's economy coming here, but overall I think your comments on the matter are pretty accurate. It's a different server with different rules, and we have the advantage of seeing how badly all that fucked up Serenity. I think the Mangos will probably make different decisions on this second try. There's no third server to migrate to if we break this one.
---
I'm probably in the minority here, but I think this is too hard a nerf. I'd rather see something closer to 20 second cycle, 10 second jam. Bigger ships take more time to align out, assuming that's the only thing these drones will be good for anymore.
---
Love you and your efforts, my dude.
---
The coolest I own is Cryptic Nemesis
---
The trick is we know Reza doesn't care about us, he cares about the direction and thus he cares that we enjoy what we do.
---
It's not like you care about anybody in PL at his point, you care only about keeping up appearances, ensuring green lines on Zkill, and inbreeding your alliance to maintain some sense of relevance.
---
[started this challenge](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mauti404/comments/bbjv2x/a_kill_for_every_ship_challenge/) where I try to get a decent kill out of every combat subcap in the game, already finished the gallente frigates and now getting into caldari frigates. it's been lot of fun and lots of feed. can't wait to fly some bigger stuff.
---
Personally I hope they all come over. Eve needs a good shake up.
---
uh hmmm what's this about?
---
Your making the mistake of thinking CCP want to balance ECM.
---
So if this is a massive influx, presumably, in order to build bases, turn a profit, etc. these guys are going to need some territory to call home.
---
For myself, the question would be "whose backyard is about to get smaller?"
---
sadly true.
---
Logging in
---
botting means isk comes into game in massive droves. people who bot get lots of iskies and amount of iskies in game goes up. oh no legit players who rat for like 70 million isk per hour now have to compete with the fact that a large amount of the population has 5 vni bots versus their 1 legit vni. this is an issue because the people who ran serenity did not give a fuck about botting and just let it run rampant. this is also how plex prices on serenity reached 20 billion isk.
---
it's just a fucking vni, if you afraid of losing cause you are to lacy to put a scanner on your vni, and scan as soon as a sig pops up, you deserve your problems!
---
Best ship. ♥

How could it possibly be nerfed? All ECM is worthless now.
---
CCP nerf, claim they will balance in future patches then dont.
---
See their claim they will look at ship sensor strenghts before touching ECM again.
---
The newer Lavacore skins are really beautiful, I want to pick up a full set but for now settled on one for my Redeemer.
---
I am sure the Chinese government is really interested in Eve Online and a single blog from some random Eve player will mobilise the leadership of the most densely populated country in the world.
---
Because they arnt done fucking with it yet.
---
In PI, in Eve, you place factories very close together. They're circular. I'm assuming that's the reference.
---
Goan git farked ya cheeky bastard
---
you cant stop me I gave you most of my stuff 😂
---
but it is on tranquility....
---
No kidding, lots of the same names
---
but then they'd have to create another type of ewar for caldari. would it really be a good idea
---
By that time they’ll finally let the game die.
---
I just don't want to be or give anyone else content. The loss is meaningless, it just gets the hunter to fuck off
---
What I meant was that if it had been CCP running things they would have had the same problem after the lawsuit. The fact that it wasn't CCP doesn't impact the fact that the laws are different for China, as you mention.
---
He is talking about his PP. 😉
---
He learned how to stack the circles efficiently on the resources.
---
Even the shitposters were better back in the day.
---
actually in-game: Hel Firewall Breach
---
unavailable: anything Kor-Azor Family
---
so people switch to sensor dampening instead :P
---
As far as I'm aware, it's because banning people in China is more problematic legally. Court cases have happened, with games companies losing.
---
However, people playing on TQ aren't 'protected' like that. Only when the entire thing is in Chinese Jurisdiction.
---
I think. I can't find a source at the moment.
---
As long as you hit warp before firing, have a nano setup and are using sebos.
---
unless, you know, they do the classic pull drone and relaunch thingy like you'd do now if the jam failed.
---
Bot are player fault. It s not ccp that use bot, it s player. It s not ccp that rmt, it s player. It s not ccp that cheat, it s player...
---
If nobody buy rmt plex or isk, nobody will run this business.... these bot exist because player are cheating...
---
i think ur more retarded than i am
---
Roleplay as a dirty traitor that sided with those that enslaved you.
---
Karmafleet and Ascendence are the two noob corps and are the easiest way into Goons.
---
not necessarily. if foreign companies were allowed to actually run business in china it would *propably* look a bit different. i might be in the wrong here but that lawsuit propably would have had much less chance of being successful if it hadn't been a chinese company.
---
Pure Blind
---
it should be 5s vs ships and 10s vs fighters imo
---
20 second base duration was actually insane for a 20k isk drone
---
Sorry drunken rant :P
---
ECM drones will only be good for GTFO now, I guess that is ok. The large ECM drones a kind of worthless then.
---
I'll have you know sir that all of the people on Reddit who haven't played Eve in years have reassured me the game is in fact, dead. Please stop spreading lies.
---
Love you more.
---
PI structures are circular, you want them as close together as you can to make the links between structures shorter. this is because links use cpu/pg in proportion to their length.
---
this basically means when setting up a PI planet you'll generally tessellate your structures in a hex grid formation - just how he has done with his banana slices.
---
They're mad because they are EVIL BOTTING CHINESE HORDES, so we have Tiananmen copypastas spammed by 33-year old edgelords as their "resistance"
---
Are you sure you are unsure? These questions seem rhetorical to me.
---
Sarcasm detector malfunction
---
F1 mashers get frustrated when they can't lock targets.
---
If you hate player interaction and content why do you play eve and not a safer MMO ?
---
hahaha
---
people are mad because Serenity is a fucked up mess, and they don't want TQ to go the same way.
---
i love it because i deal with whatever opens through the holes.
---
relic sites, combat sites, gas sites, people to shoot at, j-space, null/low/hi-sec whatever, we get what we want then roll the hole.
---
nothing going on? micromanage that pi/pp, mine a moon field, throw some ships on the grill.
---
The Amarr Imperial Jubilee skins, without a doubt. The one for the Oracle is especially sexy.
---
Hi
---
Spoiler alert, it already is.
---
people are mad because china
---
Have to say any cold iron, simple and beautiful
---
Aah, we have to protect the utopia that is tq, thanks
---
That's probably true, but it's also probably the reason CCP was forced to use a local company. I doubt they gave up that much control by choice. From that I know foreign companies in China are required to work with a local partner and this is probably why.
---
onos our annual leet alliance circlejerk isnt going to happen the game is ruined ccpwaaaaah
---
careful, that sounds like you're promoting ge nocide, might get called a nazi
---
Also my favourite way to fuck with spools when dueling triglavians
---
...and my least favourite way to get fucked with when spooling
---
I like any skin that makes a ship look like a ship. Matte black or gray like Cold Iron preferred.
---
This really isn't a good look for CCP.  
---
Everyone involved has been working extremely hard to make this event into something amazing. Even some of my own work is featured, so it's personally disheartening to hear that there may be no broadcast at all because of these issues.   
---
I want to send my appreciation to all the people that took time out of their lives to give so much love to this production. All of the promotional material I've had the pleasure of viewing has been phenomenal, and even if we never see it, I'm sure the rest is even better. &lt;3
---
Like, honestly, who the fuck cares?
---
tbf, on TQ it isn't and theres still shitloads of bots
---
Suitonia, I'm curious what your overall thoughts are on this change and where ECM stands now that we've had some time for the last batch of changes to settle in.
---
Did Brisc Rubal tell you this?
---
I'm here for the salt.
---
Because people hate Chinese, mainlanders especially, in their games
---
Yes because lowsec being a shell of it's formerself and nullsec being the same as always but more boring is very lively compared to the last 4 years
---
compared to Serenity it IS an utopia
---
seriously
---
Don't most of "the masses" include crabbers and explorers that rely on ECM drones as a final "cross my fingers and pray" escape from ganks? If anything this appeases low-life pirates who can tackle ships knowing there's a lower chance for escape for their prey.
---
how so?
---
I dont know much about serenity politics.

Theres nothing wrong with the nyx blapping him while hes not moving at all in a BC, the application is fine, the shit part is that you cant get a good fight in low without Snuff or Snuff pets dropping caps and swinging their little dicks around.
---
Most of the PIBC fear seems to be a meme, though I do think some fear that TQ could eventually become what Serenity has where Titan blobs prevent any real content from ever happening. I think most veteran players would say more players on TQ is always a good thing, regardless of where they are. Null is by-and-large empty, so we're not hurting for space. I look forward to a new entity to fight! Things are far too binary right now.
---
&gt;though I do think some fear that TQ could eventually become what Serenity has where Titan blobs prevent any real content from ever happening.

Have you missed the past 3 years? That is already a reality.
---
"NA/EU competitive PvP players"
---
WUT
---
imagine a single block controlling the whole server. imagine not just a fraction of people botting but most of them. imagine single persons multiboxing dozens of titans. imagine a plex price that by a multitude higher than ours.  
---
the problems you mentioned in your rhetoric questions are in a babystate compared to what happened on Serenity. what do you thing why they're migrating here? the game is in an unironically *literally unplayable* state on their server.  
---
people are scared this is gonna happen on TQ aswell, allthough it is frankly unlikely. If they don't want to become pets they're gonna be a threat to papa goon after all and i dont think 2000 chinese nerds are gonna pose a threat to that.
---
Excellent information on Chinese slang for EVE. I had not played Eve when I lived in HK. I was thinking about slang and language mashups in general. 
---
English is one big mashup language in any case. A collision between Romance and Germanic languages that accepts loanwords and slang from almost everywhere in the world.
---
When I lived in HK I worked for the United Nations. Some colleagues and I had taken a personal trip to Shaoguan in Guangdong province. In the market, we met a professor of English language at Shaoguan University. He greeted us and quickly realized that the seven of us represented native English speakers from England, Wales, Ireland, Canada, and the US. He became our host and guide for the week in exchange for our group providing recordings and in person speaking with some students. It was a great time. Cheers

Better known as woosh
---
And yet back when it was the CFC, and therefore much closer to the original BoB days, PL worked with Goons &amp; Co. I remember Shadoo being in fleet planning channels etc.
---
So the BoB part is a red herring at this point.
---
&gt; no one's gonna plot a route over 150 waypoints
---
You don't know me. Noob me was not smart. I used to set up regional buy orders in multiple regions for ore I was interested in reselling, and used a miasmos to go fetch it, then compress somewhere and move it to Jita to sell. It worked pretty well for making me isk when I had little to none, but the routes used were *bats.* I eventually learned to stay within a region when making my route for the day, but that took at least one bad trip around the universe to figure out.
---
I remember doing something like this before I was aware just how bad the optimizer was and despite the warning tried to optimize the full route. **Once.**
---
Forceclosing eve from task manager when it's stolen the mouse is actually a lot harder than it looks...
---
Jesus, didn’t know y’all were so salty about us keeping Haneef. You can have him back
---
Eve has sound?
---
Eh, we still see some good fights on TQ. Titan proliferation is definitely a "problem" on TQ, but it's not even remotely how bad it is on Serenity.
---
For some reason people feel the need to blame the state of Serenity on the players rather than the people running it. Can you imagine what TQ would look like if it was run under the same standards as Serenity? But hey ho, let's just blame a specific race/nationality of people for everything bad.
---
I don’t understand. Like the widow and shit are useless now if they are reducing the range of ecm idk why they did this in the first place. The range is so low the widow counted on ecm at range to not get targeted. 
---
They are making ecm so useless just ducking remove it.
---
I am mad because they are chinese. They bot like everyone else, blob like everyone else, betray you like everyone else but they are chinese and that to me is the killer. I might be young but i´ve had my fair share of run-ins with these people and each and every time they´ve left a sour taste.
---
this happened years ago
---
Hedliner cares too much. We are all his terrible children who are squandering our potential. He's not mad, he's just disappointed.
---
Literal HERO v PL catch eviction ptsd right here...
---
This is what I was getting at.
---
Not like I think they'll be super best friends forever from then on, just that it would be intriguing if somehow every player united in righteous indignation.
---
*For profit company fails to capitalize on fanatically devoted customer base that any semi-competent company would kill for, all the while pursuing misguided side projects incompetently.
---
ECM fighters don't have a presence at all like ECM drones do.
---
There could definitely be a lot more. From what I've heard fleet pvp f1 monkey bots are commonplace there but I've never even seen someone get accused of using one on TQ.
---
Those are some thick slices for a sandwich.
---
I mean, we are getting into the era of the internet where it is almost impossible to retreive evidence.  
---
In those days they were 50d and 100d gtc.
---
I flew in one op in my eagle before the evacuation of GE-. Led to me heading out to have fun with PFR though, so it wasn't all bad

---
Voltron are literally just a meat shield.
---
For PvP function I'd suggest going for T2 Frigs or T2 / T3 Destroyers.
---
If you look up Lossmails at zkill you can compare those ships, Worms cost usually above 90mil where your average Hecate or Wolf is down at \~70mil ish.
---
Also those T2s / T3s have a way broader engagement Profile compared to a Worm, and come with added benefit since you have Combatscanner, Defender Launcher or an ADC.
---
In fleet combat you can make way more use of many T3Ds and other T2 Frigates, also you can easily replace them because they're cheap asf and very durable.
---
So I guess price/performance you're better of going anything else besides pirate faction.
---
thanks for your honesty.
---
I don't really see much issue ECM drones since the ECM change, I feel like that removed most of the frustration from them as a high-delta RNG affair where you could get locked down indefinitely, since you can kill them when you get jammed now. This change pushes them even further in a direction where they are a tool for escaping rather than for winning fights which I personally like.   
---
ECM Modules still feel powerful if used in the right situations, but require much more knowledge and thought to their use now. I think it's made a massive positive impact for solo/small gangs, although I can see the drawback of changing a mechanic that used to be very powerful in the hands of a new, unskilled player. I think there still are some ECM ships that need some love (Griffin Navy, Rook and Widow) which aren't doing super well after the change.
---
i noticed an at vi winner monument in the elite pvp capital of new eden
---
is there a story behind it, do any other previous winners have monuments etc.
---
Don't let the hate get to you, I much prefer this br tool, just needs a dark mode.
---
that is true, however humans are animals that are not very fond of dropping old habbits. so I'm sure we're gonna see quite a few of these migrating to TQ.
---
gila

&gt;I was mostly afk, so was he as he seems to be only streaming

maybe proofread your posts before submitting them, jesus christ

They will blue goons and then together they will kill the game by bluing everyone.

&gt;  these people
---
Classy.

Clearly an action to help NC! CCP to be helping PanFam confirmed
---
Nobody's. The game is so fucked that the largest entity in the game needs just one and a half region to krab like crazy and make massive amounts of isk and supers
---
tfw super pilot but no station spinning for me :(
---
hey now, doom has deliberately exposed himself to the mouth of madness in order to harness the power of prophecy! examples include the eviction of test from esoteria, predicting the goon dual tank at X47, and uncovering the INIT false-flag Pandoralica ban (it was actually sisbliss!). just a few days ago he revealed that brisc will be banned forever, so i am eagerly awaiting the fulfilment of yet another prophecy next week.
---
seething
---
Where they'll probably get the banhammer because they don't know the right tricks to avoid detection. PvP botters especially since there's a victim with strong incentive to report them.
---
Winter is here.

but I was born to endure this kind of weather.
---

---
welcome old friends \o/
---
I stand corrected. Your reduction is quite easy to follow too, thank you for the explanation!
---
I do believe the question isn't whether or not there will be bans, the question is the *when*. sadly CCP is really slow on these.
---
I never said i´m classy. I distrust and dislike them. The chinese mentality is something i can not and do not want to deal with, they can´t be straightforward, they will try to fuck you over at every possible opportunity, they hate everyone non-chinese and feel superior to everybody. I don´t want to deal with that anymore.
---
Domi Quafe skin.
---
Every one is named "Vending Machine _" now.
---
Whether they dispense death, Quafe zero, or some combination of both, now that is the mystery.
---
Do they all know the rules are different? And do they care? They all have botting programs installed which will presumably also work on TQ, and they don't think there's anything wrong with botting in games.
---
 Because cheats
---
And they will be banned, isk will be removed from the game. Its already happening today.
---
I don't think anyone's forgotten that the Russians are also huge cheaters and RMTers. Russians and Chinese have that reputation - justifiably - in any game there's a large number of them.
---
True.  The battle of GErusalem was definitely eventful for that.
---
Debatable. I don’t think government should have too much say in my leisure hobbies, but I suppose China has a much different culture.
---
It's the gentlemanly capital nod.
---
Its completely fucked up. This is what we get after the cap damage nerf? Laughable. Knew it was useless.
---
Of course hes not gonna move when scrammed and webbed.
---
&gt;the shit part is that you cant get a good fight in low without Snuff or Snuff pets dropping caps and swinging their little dicks around.
---
And why do you think they do that? Because they are overpowered.
---
heheheheHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH HEHEHEHEHEHEHEEHEHE
---
Not when CCP knows about it and can fix it.
---
I agree, but without the Naglfar part. It is still overwhelming to me when you sit from some pleb subcap to the Nag, and the elevator starts wooshing up. I'd miss that feeling if the model would be shrunk.
---
FIIIIIINNNNEEEEE.  Fine. Fine. Fine.
---
Logi drones are borderline OP if you use them en masse and in smaller-scale combat. The recent AT meta (heh) has been heavily influenced by rep-drone heavy comps. The vast majority of good AT compositions need some way to clear rep drones, whether that's smartbombs, stealth bomber bombs, or enough high rof/tracking weaponry to effectively clear clouds of heavy armor maintenance bots. You can try to punch through rep drones solely with massive DPS but that's not a given and an easy way to lose a match quickly. 
---
If we could finally get logi on km's and people didn't feel the need to use whore drones in f1 fleets I think a lot more people would use them on larger-scale TQ fights and respect the power of rep drones.
---
Just make a module that deletes your opponents overview settings
---
Hire me CCP
---
For all of those points, although there are problems on TQ, they are far far worse on Serenity and that's largely down to PIBC.
---
lol cute
---
No  
---
No
---
Yeah that's true. Maybe this will get them to step their game up out of necessity, but I wouldn't be holding my breath.
---
Eve Macau needs to be a thing.
---
That's literally the law of supply and demand.
---
i just think it is a more productive mindset to ask what you can do to overcome the new challenges. rather than tuck your tail and bark at everything that scares you.
---
Hey man
---
Internet spaceships are serious business.
---
Ccp has usually two approaches to balance: - overbuff less used or new stuff; - give it a 25mbit drone bay. I wish they would nerf things faster and more often instead. This is a nice change, it keeps ecs as an escape token but prevents a cloud of these to just shut down a ship permanently.
---
Such is Mango
---
There is no way of transferring assets. It's not even CCP's servers in China, so i doubt they could do that even if they wanted.     
---
They could conjure Serenity assets form thin air on TQ, but i'm fairly certain they won't do that...
---
photo should be taken at a lower angle

 Why don't you just try it out since it's free now

after a month of grinding abyssal sites i finally have enough isk to open up my own azbel for abyssal runners. its been a long time dream finally coming true!

Jesus christ, you made your own thread to ask the same question as the other threads, top tier tard.

Honestly, I can't think of a situation where that's ever not a good move.
---
Negative
---
As a westerner living in China I can tell you that is complete and utter ignorant bullshit. Do they have a different culture? Obviously, most countries do. Do they have ignorant, selfish fucktards, definitely, but they aren't any worse than the ignorant selfish fucktards you will find anywhere else in the world. They have just as many, perfectly nice, friendly and civilized people.
---
I’m looking forward to more players on Tranquility and don’t care what nationality they are.
---
Thats a terrible reason for us to act the way we have. Just piss poor.
---
It's almost as if Reddit has a massive number of people on it and different people have different opinions
---
Where are all the people that always commented on here with  “Adapt”  or  “GetGud”  now?

 It's a decent time to join if you get an invite you start with 750k sp
---
You should take a long hard look at why you act that way then, be better.
---
CCP "padding numbers" is not "the law of supply and demand" what the fuck?
---
&gt;A large number of sales offered by a company to boost profits before an acquisition seems pretty straightforward to me.
---
It's not because it's a ridiculous idea. You can easily spot anomalies like that (and they will be brought up in many, many M&amp;A meetings), and factor them out when making an evaluation of the company you're about to buy.
---
Meta-EVE.
---
CCP has stated they plan further balance to capital application. And Snuff does that because in the confides of lowsec (especially Black Rise because of location) they don't have to worry about escalation, and if there is an escalation they will just blob it with titans. It's not a matter of overpowered it's still a matter of proliferation.
---
That's a violation.
---
r/eve does not have a massive number of people on it
---
Having to reprogram overview on the fly. In effect, ecm. But one that skill can actually mitigate.
---
Brutal

This has to be one of the worst ideas posted on this subreddit in a while, and that's an accomplishment

Statistics aren't people. They can't be racist.
---
Default Flycatcher hands down.
---
 no it's fucking not as due to the company that runs the server in the rules that they gave out to those player
---
Bold to assume they won't just join the imperium for some safe botting space
---
So, are they coming in with the same assets they had on Serenity, or starting from scratch? Same question but about characters and skill points?
---
Very simple, most people hate uncertainty and change.  With a supposed 2000 person strong alliance, that poses a lot of uncertainty, and scares people of the changes they could cause.
---
Personally I welcome all new players and content creators.
---
You are welcome
---
If they removed ECM jammers they'd have to reimburse everyone who isn't retarded and actually SPed into the sensor compensations.    
---
But yeah I wish they'd stop fucking destroying jammers and just remove them already.  Jamming is dead after the "jammed targets can now lock you" bullshit patch everyone was raving about.
---
doing well, ty

Thank you for your replies and insights.

How do people get that much disposable ISK without buying Plex? Holy...
---
I dont think goons will protect them so they can get strong and BS them
---
Nah I never react, I try to analyze what went wrong, sometimes it's just annoying to see how the same people has that game style and nothing more. Also yeah I'm in a losec corp but I like to solo PvP
---
If you kill an NPC, the wreck belongs to you.
---
If you kill a PC, the wreck belongs to the PC whose ship you wrecked. You have shared custody for as long as the aggro timer lasts. Once the timer expires, the victim regains sole custody, and you are considered an aggressor again.
---
Based on the fact that PIBC blued 9/10ths of everyone on the Chinese server, and the goon/tapi blob is 3/4 of our server, it seems that it is right up their alley
---
Just remove PvP
---
TIA
---
Its not like players blame anyone, its the MMO fuckupd history of the - as you say - "nationality". People are scared .... rightfully so i must say given the experience with said "nationality" from other mmos in all those years. It wont end well for EVE, as it didnt for any title many times before ... and since.
---
If this happens its going to be a farmville simulation. Lets wait and see
---
thats actually an incredibly broad question, and the really short answer is that there are tons.   
---
Longer, but still not very detailed answer: Where are we fighting, why are we fighting, who, all play into choices about what kinds of ships, tactics, and maybe strategies used. What weapons and countermeasures mostly boil down to ship choices, although even within a ship you can fit them in an infinite number of different ways.  
---
For example: all depending on the objective of WHY we are fighting, may determine roughly what kind of things we are using. Are we sitting on a gate, to harass/interdict people trying to move through it? If so we would probably employ use of some interdiction ships, along with shorter ranged, heavier damage weapons, along with stasis webifiers, to make sure that whoever comes through gets caught,a nd blown up quickly.  
---
Maybe we are harassing an ongoing operation, as a 3rd party. We may be in smaller, faster ships that can engage targets from longer ranges, and dictate what can and cant shoot back at us. We may be less concerned with tackling our targets, and more on just killing them and/or interfering with something they are doing.  
---
Perhaps we are in a wormhole, where the size and mass of our ships may be a factor we need to care about, which then plays into some of our choices about what kind of ships we use in our fleet.  
---
Happy to help further, you can PM me on discord  **Exooki**\#2108.
---
Why do players have to wait for a fix to something that has been known for years?
---
&gt;And Snuff does that because 
---
They could do it because they are retarded. It would make no difference.
---
No. It means more bots and people you cant communicate with, and they are likely all blobbers anyway.
---

Pessimism trained to V lol I want to believe.
---
lmao remember when that company bought CCP for their community management chops and then
---
*sniff* why does everyone hate me?
---
&gt; people are mad because Serenity is a fucked up mess, and they don't want TQ to go the same way.
---
I don’t think I’ve read a statement that was more correct and more incorrect. They are mad about this, but they’re actively pushing the game that way anyways without PIBC being here.
---
PIBC isn’t even big enough to make a big dent on TQ as it stands. They’re likely to be a big bloc alliance that will be in the top ten pop-wise, but not the top five. They won’t be skilled enough yet to be an elite of small group. They’ll have to adapt to some significant changes from Serenity to TQ.
---
Much of the fearmongering comes from the same people who fearmongered the PA acquisition. I wonder if maybe there’s some common thread there.
---
This entire thread had me laughing. Out of context that makes no sense, but with the context that ecm is my irl job.. The whole thread is saying they hate me lol
---
rip ecm clouding fighters :(
---
Just confirmed with Toni, he says you need to apply through website
---
I think we're cross posted, see my edited comment
---
Widow still mega useless. No you do not drop 3 fucking widows to jam 1 fighter each. Bring a falcon for that. Change ecm bonus to 4% shields ccpls
---
Goons also evicted Test in 2013(?) when moon changes made it profitable.
---
Keep in mind propaganda intentionally portrays the current enemy as the "forever enemy", but when objectives align pretty much no one has problems with working together.
---
Betrayal is one of the few things that can overcome mutual goals however, which is why alliances declare war.
---
Telling someone you are going to shoot them is all good, telling someone your not going to shoot them and then shooting them will come back to bite you 3 years down the line.
---
I don't see any real blockers to Goons/NC/PL/Test all working together if objectives aligned.
---
Cloak faster, if you do it right nobody should be able to lock you
---
I didn't mention anything about locking.
---
Remember when dozens of people spent literal months preparing for this only to get told to effectively fuck off 2 days prior?
---
people are always mad about something. This is just another eve is dying trend and in a few weeks it will all be forgotten.
---
Might be cause they fucked theyr server with booting and cheating, why allowe them to ruin TQ ?
---
I only remember sailor
---
I am torn on whether it should go ahead if the tool isn't working.  On the one hand, the pilots who have been prepping should get to shoot each other, on the other, what is the point of not being able to stream a tournament and having everything take so much longer?
---
The mods should permaban anyone who posts a helpful answer in this thread.
---
Will this sound still [haunt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/198rorF4cLXzmzepMtoRkNPKr4tpfIQPd/view?usp=sharing) you?

You will always be seen if someone is watching the WH or pounding Dscan. 
---
Go join EVE Scout / Signal Cartel - they have a ton of great resources to help you get started in WH exploration or watch some of WiNGSPANTT’s early videos on YouTube
---
This is already TQ, Goons can run over any coalition they want to
---
If ECM could jam fighters again the widow would be the most useful fleet blops BS again and fleet blops BS would again have a use
---
Fleet blops are in a very very bad place atm mostly thanks to the inability to jam fighters along with various other meta reasons
---
remember when i played and cared about this game

at least they're not from the US

TIL hunting miners in sovnull is "real content"

---
West hates East, nothing new
---
Everyone that lives in J-space hits the d-scan button ever 1-3 seconds while in space. If your not cloaked they will always see you on d-scan. Yes covops cloak is awesome to have, and maybe necessary for hunting. Otherwise if they’re watching the hole which a lot will be, they will see and hear that someone came through the hole. So there’s nothing you can do about that. 
---
Once your in if they weren’t watching the hole, or even if they were. You need to hit your cloak within the same second that you decloak. Then odds are they won’t see you pop up on D-scan for a second and you can continue the stalk.
---
Drone lands are probably their only chance if they don't want to blue the north or imperial legacy.
---
Classic shit. Try to think like your target do.
---
Check his killboard. Deckoak near a wh and pull your drones back make him think you jumped off, follow him cloacked, camp him, he will do something stupid it's just as matter of time.
---
 Protip: they always come back after a few minutes. Always.
---
i'm going to assume this is a crap version of a naz post, cos i ain't reading all that.
---
It's not that we don't the Chinese to come over (hello we already have PLA and FRT in Tranquility but you don't hear anyone complaining about them), it's that we want them to come over and not fuck the server up. In the end it was the PLAYERS that chose to kill their server. You also need to know that most people have no idea who PIBC is and have only heard news about how they killed their server.
---
To insinuate that people hate them simply because they are Chinese, shows how little respect you have for the Chinese and their culture. Sure there are people that probably think like that but seriously, understand its two different cultures that are about to clash. Do you really expect no one to knee jerk about that?
---
ah ok, I can see that. Mistake on my part. What I was trying to say is they must see me on Dscan for that split second while I'm cloaking and then dock up
---
If you are doing PVP - watch the later videos. You will learn a lot on how hunters work.  
---
Signal Cartel is a pacifist organization and PVP is not allowed
---
Yeah this sounds like a shitty long boring Naz attempt. Made it 3-4 lines and quit.
---
I've been doing that with the cloak, I jump through hold cloak until I know what I'm doing, move slightly and hit cloak right away. Seems like they target always docks up, maybe I'm not doing it as fast as I seem to think I am
---
So *yoooooou're* ecm? We hate you.
---
Needless to say your questions are pretty loaded but nevertheless i'll take the bait. 
---
###People are mad because PIBC is a cancer.  
---
Okay that's a bit over the top.  While malignant tumors are capable of metastasizing to unaffected areas (as PIBC is to our server from their truly broken one) this is a dysanalogy because cancers generally aren't communicable.   More specifically, PIBC is a virus and the Chinese sever was their unfortunate host.  They infected that server and grew by dominating the only resource that truly matters in eve (content).  They outblobbed their opponents with titans and harvested content at the expense of the rest of the server, and when their quarry went to ground [they left no ground to go to](https://youtu.be/qa31nDBsUJI). The inevitable consequence of their "playstyle" (if you can call it a playstyle) was the death of fun on their server which now wallows in interminable stagnation. 
---
Now they're making the conscious decision to leap onto tq with the rest of us.  I personally don't think they deserve the content, nor does any group that is so woefully shortsighted to anticipate the consequence of limitless consolidation and constant blobbing of an opponent in an environment with a finite number of participants. It's a very simple lesson:
---
###You can arrive at a point where you're so big and your enemies so small that you must consider thinning your own herd to make more content.  
---
The most frustrating aspect of this of course is that it's always members of the groups which approach this limit on tq that mindlessly parrot "adapt to survive" - while their more extreme counterparts on the chinese server (PIBC) employed the exact same strategy (coalescing into a mega-blob to win) to the extent of irreparably damaging their server membership and plummeting its community into an unprecedented era of stagnation and boredom.
---
Hunter’s Quiver! I have it on an exequror.
---
That and the most recent Christmas one on the jump freighter or the Nestor
---
The only bs allowed for hole with a c5 static is nestor and couple of leshak :p
---
Thats the shittiest part, all the prep that has gone into it, the Streamfleet crew have worked their butts off, the pilots have been prepping, and then it gets pulled.
---
Maybe. Or maybe they are watching the holes. What are they doing before they dock up? Mining, hacking, ratting?
---
lots of PIBC from serenity have already joined TQ and FRT. This is a common misunderstanding. Frat and PIBC are not enemies.
---
I wish I could get close enough to see his name, always seem to dock just as I come into the hole. Must have been spamming dscan and caught me
---
Not even close to an accurate analogy, because boosts don't stack.  Having more weak webs is never a bad thing, while having unbonused boosts is useless if you have a real ship doing said boosts.
---
I seem to find a lot of ratters, mostly rattlesnakes so far
---
Always assume you are being watched when in J space.
---
Always.
---
Eve has been around long enough for everyone to have been both enemies and friends.

Or just stay in an overview channel and just immediately click to save

people don't like immigration. EVE IS FULL!

Tl;Dr?

Hmm maybe we all move to serenity as a response...I like thia
---
What are you arguing here? I'm saying myself that any sort of real content has been ground out by massive titan blobs from the past few years, where Rorq saves and kills are now a central content beacon for people as opposed to traditional sov fights and wars.
---
One of the favorite fights I've ever been in is when I was in HERO and we fought for 7+ hours in northern Catch against Provi, to the point where I bagged 250+ killmails during this time.

If you have warped and jump through a brand new wormhole (that isn't a K162), that wormhole signature will appear in the probe scanner window for anyone in that system. This is a BIG tip off to anyone farming that a new wormhole has appeared in system so they will dock until they investigate. They don't even need to see you on dscan.
---
Nope.
---
You don't need to wait for reset for skill extractors.  PLEX should be seeded, so you can buy PLEX and then use said PLEX to buy them in the New Eden Store.
---
If you dont want to pvp you will be forced. That is eve
---
Yeah, there’s a great chance if they’re out ratting that they have an alt on at least one of the holes. I know when we rat we at least 75% of the time have eyes on all the wormholes.
---
ow wow, I never even thought of that but that makes sense
---
I hadn't thought of that. Nice one.
---
After the third sentence I was beginning to question if this was about Eve or not?
---
u/CCP_Rise enjoying Friendship Friday Nice branding? Great news btw (☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞
---
I really wish there were more 'cross-faction' skins. I want all my ships done upp Amarr style.
---
Yeah, and I'm sure a big part of what convinced the folk at PA to shell out the big bucks for CCP is the dedicated community that has been going on for 16 years on a single game, which is almost unheard of.
---
Why else would they be willing to spend nearly half a billion dollars on a company that hasn't made any new successful product in the last 16 years ?
---
Now think again about the importance of keeping the community engaged, through sponsoring player-run tournaments for example (or just maintaining the already established one). Because when that's gone CCP is worth junk.
---
lmbo when you clowns can´t even fathom anymore that content that was neither mouthbreathing F1 mashing nor 1337 VNI kiting until tackle arrives even existed. sad tbh.
---
An overview scrambler actually sounds kinda neat. maybe it just randomly clicks on which column you're sorting by every tick, or fucks with your brackets or something. Enough to throw someone off if they get caught in the heat of the moment but counterable if you keep a cool head and pay attention.
---
I'd love a module that blanked chat, or a module that force-closed your voip program
---
Oh yeah, didn’t think about that, but that’s probably happening too at least some of the times.
---
They didn't have a lot of other places to go.
---
During the period that they were making drastic changes to the spawns daily, they got butthurt that people could test in a controlled environment rather than put a 3B+ ship up against surprise 9-Leshak spawns on Tranq.  Since they stopped making changes every day, there's no reason they shoudln't be seeded now.
---
as long as they blue anyone but imperium it isn't going to make a difference in anything. as soon as The Imperium and PIBC are blue then even our server will be dead.

Hahahah thought about making it my text tone.
---
So do their characters transfer over with no sp or isk?
---
If aligned with Test, yes. But if Test didn't join them I'd argue they wouldn't be successful. Especially if Init remains headshot.
---
the moral of the story is theres nothing more you could do that you arent already doing. you can only hope the are not watching and not paying enough attention. if your sure you spooked them the next best thing is to try and figure out where there going and maybe there is a play to be made from that. dont feel bad tho because you will generally miss most of the ratters you jump into. still worth trying. your on the right track keep it up.

You were disappointed with your nyx, which I totally understand.  As well as a Nyx I've got an Avatar, an Apostle and a Minokawa and I have to say the most disappointing of those four are the latter.  They just look horrible.
---
Good,  I really didn’t want one anyhow
---
This won't last (and looks like it hasn't already).  Botting is a systemic problem now that can only be solved by Ccp developement.  They either need a better way of bot identification (or shorter time period/ easier method) for their GM's or a way to identify and remove them in far shorter time frames.  The only way in my laymen's opinion I can see would be to implement in game random captchas or on specific things like when going to collect isk.  I like the attention to the botting problem but unfortunately op this is merely short term.  Until something is done or implemented from ccps end, botting will not only continue but increase.  I appreciate the security teams efforts but it is frankly not enough nor the correct method for this.
---
Naz is a lot better.
---
depends, Test needs to actually ally PANFAM, not just stay neutral.
---
And right now that just won't happen, there is no reason for test to end their friendship with goons
---
Wait until bob knows about that...
---
That depends on ship.  Darks are actually the best for most missile/frigate setups with proper skills, but the worst for about anything else.

Sounds like you need to have a cloaky camper added to your system instead

If you have poor skills tho even missiles aren't gonna apply given how fast those frigates go in darks.

Out in wicked creek you will see in total maybe 50 botting vnis. All named the same name, all with chars who join corp at the same time. Its insane.

This is just a few. Its definitely a bit of discrimination against chinese playerbase, BUT the way chinese gaming culture is and what happened to serenity makes this kind of freaky for tranquility

Pushing forward with the tournament without a stream is basically just a consolation for the competing teams. As a team captain, I would much much rather have this able to be streamed, but even still - teams have put in so much effort at this point that we want to compete simply for the joy of competition and seeing our hard work pay off (or crash and burn as is also totally possible).
---
The meta is generally to keep eyes on holes if you're krabbing and you're actually able to.  
---
This isn't always done, and sometimes as soon as you go through a static connection into a new system, it's going to be the first time that the sig even pops up on the other side.  
---
It's probably not the best place for soloing anything other than miners or explorers if you're actually solo hunting, but you can kill some juicy targets if you bring even a few friends.  
---
What I'd suggest regardless is to move into a WH if you're not already living in one. It's really cheap to move into one and so long as you pick your static exits strategically instead of "this hole looks cool and this will be my hole" then you'll do fine.  
---
Even for an explorer, theres C2 (gud) and C4 (ehhhh) WH's that would be perfect for exploring if you aren't interested in krabbing sites.  
---
I remember when I last played, our new players would be able to earn a plex in like 2 weeks of semi-regular playing just doing exploration  
---
add on helping with sites and you a rich boi
---
I mean you already have a form of that with the different Meta types, it may not be as significant as E-war scripts, but it sort of fulfills that.
---
That makes sense. It is a real shame for all your effort that it isn't going ahead this weekend.  
---
I just really hope that the tool gets fixed next week.
---
It use to be that winners of the AT tournament got a monument as well as AT ships and a medal. I believe the winners got to choose which system got it as well. That has since been stopped, though I don't know which tournaments it was an award for exactly.
---
This would be interesting, maybe this particular MWD could be balanced by a large increase in CPU or Power Grid cost.

Or, instead, we can go back to 14 day trials instead of everyone have Alpha accounts laying around everywhere. Alpha accounts were a mistake.

Nobody is hating on them because they're Chinese. If the Aussies had their own server and it had stagnated the way Serenity did, people would be complaining about them coming over too.

---
Indeed, ECM drones are pretty cancer even in F1 blobs.  Since its Feroxes Online, every pilot puts their drones on a random ferox.  With CCP TiDi kicking in on every major fight, one jam cycle lasts FOREVER.

I mean I don’t play but I don’t see people being upset
---
Buyer beware...I mean...watcher of boring shit beware!

Nah a lot of people (including myself) started subbing after playing alpha for a few months.

This has always been my thoughts on the matter, but couldn’t be bothered ( or too scared) to post a CCPLS about it.

not to be rude - but are a few players like yourself really worth the obvious drawbacks to the health of the game of people abusively cycling alphas?

---
Have you actually calculate the ratting efficiency of an alpha vni?
---
The problem is not alpha, but rather skill injector that made ratting alts mass-producible
---
I mean, this discussion repeats itself every other day, but to keep the circle spinning...
---
Isn't the problem really the fact that null anoms are mindless isk printing that requires no thought or player input? It's simply so easy to bot because there's so little to the activity it's hard to differentiate actual players from bots because they basically act the same... warp to anom, drop drones and orbit. 
---
I love the fact that alpha accounts allow players to test the waters in Eve and I've met a good few players who got in because of them. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
---
Not like it matters, the mods here are complete garbage so non-eve posts are regular around here.
---
the thing is if you hardly contribute anything to killing someone then if you are able to take the loot itll make people steal a lot of loot with speedy small ships during events etc

Garbage.

This is a bad change. If you really hate ECM that much then remove it from the game and think of something else for Caldari e-war. But if you don't want to do that, don't nerf ECM so much it might as well be out of the game.
---
Don't leave ECM drones with no role other than rolling the dice for a last ditch escape.

You don't get anything for killing shiny pods. I guess if you want to stroke yourself over killboard stats then sure, but it doesn't even look good on zkill when someone actually looks up the kills.
---
Kind of suprised they never went to an unlimited train and unlimited scale of strength. The player with the higher strength wins. Think of how much invested to get the highest strength over years and years lol. I know super bad idea but suprised CCP hasn't done it.
---
Dude they announce explanations for high profile bans all the time, especially when (as it is in this case) it's for out of game reasons.
---
And come on, you have to know that simply doing something high profile like banning a CSM member and not issuing a statement is just not an option. Do you really think the rumors WOULDN'T be circulating if they banned him completely silently? You think people would just go "huh, I guess they're just headshotting CSM members they don't like. Life is strange!" and move on.
---
Do you like Homosexuals and members of the LGBTQ community to be publicly, personally derided?
---
Why do you publicly deride others? Have you ever considered treating others the way you yourself expect to be treated?
---
That's a possibility but I don't actually agree. I think it's good that people don't feel time pressured to their 21 days (everyone got an affiliate trial, didn't they) before deciding whether to commit to the game.
---
Nullsec Anomalies are way too easy in general. With how much they pay compared to other activities the risk is laughable.
---
Great fight, thank you!
---
It is definitely a problem that anomaly ratting is so low APM, yes. I've proposed doing something about that in several other threads (the easiest fix is to make them target drones).
---
&gt; I love the fact that alpha accounts allow players to test the waters in Eve and I've met a good few players who got in because of them
---
That's why I'm not proposing killing off alphas entirely. But you don't need to be able to fly ships that you can use in nullsec anomalies effectively in order to get into the game.
---
They tried diminishing returns on titan blobs by making them do aoe explosions on death... this crashed tons of people in fights so far!

This thing is supposed to open list of fits for your currently open ship. I suppose you already have it open, so nothing happens.

There's ticket for that already, to not show it in these circumstances: [https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues/1928](https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues/1928)
---
I guess that may actually be my issue. I do lots of solo logi for nano gang, and I do WANT to be on the killmail as well. It's a shame that logi frigs don't get any bonus to logi drones either.
---
&gt; Banning people for botting has no real effect if they can just create a new alpha with a different VPN and get straight into a new VNI.
---
Botting income has been great enough that injecting a good omega VNI alt is not a problem at all for any botter. Probably even means more isk/hr for them and less computational hassle of onlining many at once.
---
Alphaes aren't the problem you are trying to pin down.
---
When the hell were there 250 person Blackbird Fleets? Did I miss that?
---
Would you say that's a common thingy?
---
Sure, but you have to consider the player experience for those legitimate players too. It's really cool that they can get out into null and actually grow there. Simply cutting off one of the 3 main ways they can make isk just strikes me as a poor solution. Instead, address the anoms directly - make them more active and interesting, give a variety that is flexible enough to accommodate players of various skill levels and attack the problem that way.
---
But at what cost?
---
Been playing about a month and I  feel like my skills are good enough to contribute. Some of the 5s have insanely long train times which is a bit disheartening but whatever.
---
AND fighting outnumbered without running or logging off.
---
What's a collection like that worth?
---
I mean, depending on playstyle if someone gets hooked into eve enough to sub they’ll be a much more productive and resourceful person than a multitude of bots, but it doesn’t shade the bot issue itself. I’d take a few more genuine players who may recruit good friends.
---
How about less "scripts" and more smart decisions before you undock ?
---
wyvern bpo lol
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what's so hard about balancing. It's like everything they try to change they go one step too far and leave it for like a year or two, then come back around and are like "Oh well after a careful look at how the balancing pass went, we're going to change this to what it actually should have been". I guess maybe it's easier for the community to accept for them to nerf the shit out of it and then buff it back up some if needed than to nerf it twice?

I miss walking around in the station. After a rather long hiatus on my part I came back to find that feature removed completely.
---
No faction supers....how pedestrian.
---
CCP please rank this higher than any other priority.
---
It's a good start!
---
lol yes
---
Now only 100+ t2 BPO left to collect
---
That would be an incredibly scummy thing to do, and I have zero respect for anyone who tries it.
---
You think NA/EU players are the only ones engaging in the tournament scene? Really?
---
Fair point. Honestly I feel alphas should be more limited to prevent vni botting at the least. Having a f2p version of Eve is something that encourages younger people (like teenagers who don't have the money to sub to a game) to play the game.
---
It would stagnate... We'd be too busy drinkin piss and baggin on eachother.
---
how about you delete your reddit account, cuck
---
Can you make me a bunch of BPCs at cost?  I'll think kindly on you forever!!
---
Wouldn't mind some Sansha skins too.
---
The truly idiotic thing here is that in 2019 (and in fact for the past like 5 years) community engagement and "things happening" have been the only real selling point of Eve.  These kinds of events are CCP's best advertising, and not providing tools to players to advertise for you for free is really silly.  12 years ago I could understand this mentality but we live in the era of "influencers" and "content creators" and not supporting yr community is really not smart.
---
Since CCP was bought by PA specifically for its chops at managing a Western player community, this kind of snub is a really bad showing to the new owners tbqh, and will have knock on effects for everyone, not just the tourney people
---
Thank you for single-handedly sinking (or helping others sink) craploads of ISK out of circulation. 🙏🏻
---
Congratulations! Now set another goal!
---
IANAWH but if I was and ratting I a home system I would close the rando holes scan all the sigs and then crit the static
---
Yes absolutely. Any competent group will have someone on the wormhole. 
---
We even at one point had a guy that his main character was cloaking on the hole while we ran sites and he got paid as any other member would. 
---
You've gotta be fucking quick to catch ratters, if you dont have Covert Ops cloak as well you can't even warp to them cloaked.
---
Use a Recon my man
---
I hope so. The game is really fun, especially the fear of other players ;)
---
Individual cases vary, but I've spoken with a lot of people who've been hacked, and CCP usually does nothing for assets. 
---
Usually they'll restore your SP if your skills were completely drained. But for assets, you are *probably* shit out of luck - it's borderline impossible to track down the assets once they're resold (especially if, as is common, your case sits on a desk for 3-8 months before they can get around to it); and while it'd be easyish to refund some of the value from the GM X rmt-isk hoard, it's apparently not their policy to ever do this. 
---
So yeah, hacks will ruin your day. Even if you're online when it happens, you probably can't keep from losing everything you own. 2FA your account, 2FA your email.
---
The truth is you are white knighting the most nationalist nation on earth.. one that when they arent destroying the the entire ocean, areworking on building literal muslim re-education camps (not a bad idea tbh)  and try to come rushing to their defense with some PC virtue signalling drivel. 
---
Get a clue... China has lasted 2000+ years because they ARENT pc... they value their strength and their civilization while pussies like you get upset because someone says they dont want chinese ruining their game. 
---
Does the difference between your perspective seem a bit different? 
---
chinese ruin every fucking game they play... they ruin any western concept they touch. 
---
Here is a humorous example. The good old all american buffet "that is chinese"-
---
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMVjskBB4w0      
---
They have their culture and they will do it there way... they have their own set of norms and acceptable behavior... and they will never ever give 2 flying fucks about yours. 
---
Americans are pretty "murica is great" etc in fact being American traveling abroad i was personally embarrassed by the way i saw numerous Americans act when i was unfortunate enough to cross paths with them.... now multiply that 10X over for 2000 years and you have chinese.
---
If the group is good, yes. If you jump down our chain during our primetime hours, we will know you are there the moment you enter j-space. If you find our home hole, you will be greeted by a Sabre. I would say our uptime for these things to be in effect is about 95% during our active timezones, and I don't think we are particularly l33t wormholers.
---
At some point, the gankers must look at a ship and try to answer the question "Is this bait?" 
---
Because it can be bait. Even a JF can be bait.

So insightful.

you're talking about kill efficiency, and if someone is too efficient it's because the gameplay is horrible

it'/s the same logic

---
nothing is going to fix CCP at this point, 50% of developer work time is doing nothing
---
lmao calling othe rpeople "kid" when you're literally stainguy
---
Sorry sick, also not my direction in the pipe
---
Define what you mean with "fuck up the server"? Like fighting and winning whole nullsec or botting?
---
Skill Injectors... I must admit that I have a divided opinion on those. Seeing one day old titans capsuleers always bring a smile to me, but also that what is advertised as "formidable warships" (c.f : EVE Online Gameplay trailer) that would normally require years of focused training can just be achieved by paining dumb amount of real life money. There’s no pride behind it, and the "endgame" has never been more accessible to everyone.
---
On another side, there’s also the argument of how new players would be able to catch up with endured veterans (read : bittervets). True, you won’t see new players (at least the ones truly interested in the game) battling in the biggest nullsec battles aboard a Capital vessel, but smaller scale PvP can be won before the engagement even started with a player’s skills.
---
They’re scanning the new sig you came from probably.
---
If one side on TQ has bigger numbers on titans they use it prevent anything, don't act like it's a serenity problem. Just think about PL/NC when they were the powerhouse of eve they blobbed everythign with titans because they could do it. Today the numbers of titans are more euqal and spread out and everyone is afraid of losing them.
---
Agreed !
---
CCP seems to go toward a reduction in nullsec anomalies efficiency lately, with the recent nerfs to Havens respawn rate (honestly being on The Initiative’s Discord, it’s just so funny to see the carebears crying about how it was "unfair and not needed").
---
But they’ll have to do better than this to put nullsec AFK farms to boot and more in line with other nullsec activities.
---
No. Go away.
---
Captain Kill Joy stakes again
---
Yes they are already integrated into the game a d your face. It's called your lookballs and Intel channels

Do you prefer to haul them each week between Jita and Amarr in a shuttle or in a rookie ship?

I joined PH when I started playing and had fun. I was making a ton of money mining moons they had for public use. I made an alt and joined another Corp in null and found out that they only have moons one day a week. Do most alliances not have moons open to the public? I tried mining anomaly ore but i made barely anything selling compressed ore. I would prefer to just look mine and sell to a buyback. Any Corp/alliances have as many moons open to it as PH?

It highlights that Eve is a sandbox and you can do whatever you wish. Including afk mining in HS. This is a twitch issue not an Eve issue.
---
Pretty good haul for your first trip. One tip for ya: Change your ship name! \[name\]'s Magnate screams that you're a newbie and an alpha pilot. If you venture into wormholes (which you should), then it will be even more important as lurkers like me will see your ship name and look up your character's killboard and fit.

Suddenly inflation skyrockets.  Welcome to the era of 20billion for 500 plex.  Also known as "China #1"
---
With a Yacht I am comfortable hauling them all at once from one end of the map to the other :)
---
Given they blued literally everyone on their previous server why would they not just do the same thing here?
---
You can do the same thing on YouTube. Just follow the format of a 10 min video with 2 minutes of intro and outro 7 minutes of speculation/personal opinion with irrelevant gameplay in the background followed up by 1 minute of reading straight from a dev blog.
---
Sounds like you don't really know what happened on serenity
---
Borderline racist
---
Everyone else who changed servers had to start from scratch why would they be different?

I've logged back in after 2 years absent. First time I played was 2006. Just not consistently.
---
So I can do the absolute shit out of about 8 different things for isk and fun... But as we know, 8 things is about 0.000001% of Eve content.
---
I have 2.5Bn set aside that I can afford to lose even if 100% of it turns into debris and loots.
---
But I dunno what skills I need to have to X, Y, or Z level in order to even bother, ya know? That's kinda the advice I'm after.
---
Botters are just more fodder to my KB
---
Cause you dont wash your ass dude.
---
One month of PLEX on Serenty cost 20billion.  Due to inflation.  Due to literally every single person on Serenity botting.  Botting is already a problem.  Add literally everyone from Serenity (who are botting and think botting is ok) to TQ who already have more than critical mass worth of botters, and you will see what happens.
---
If you like null exploring you should checkout Rushlock's twich stream after DT every weekday, rush does a good 3 hours of null exploring.  Later in the day /u/FrankTheBank takes over the stream and does something he thinks is PVP.
---
It does. Because expensive kills are expensive kills, pods or not.
---
Period.
---
&gt; where Titan blobs prevent any real content from ever happening
---
So why not ask for nerfs to the fucking titans instead?

Sadly phoenixes are probably the worst ratting dreads. Nags &gt; revs &gt; Moros &gt; phoenix

1.6b DOWN THE DRAIN
---
can you please be so kind and add a Night Mode?
---
I just flashbanged myself again
---
I didn't even know you could renaming ships. Thanks a ton!
---
No idea what people would pay for the research, but the NPC price is around 500b
---
I'll be sure to check it out. It will be useful to see how others play!
---
ok I thought this was bait but now I'm sure it is
---
8/10 you got me
---
👀
---
Agreed. 10 years ago when ECM was an actual active issue ingame they should have done this.
---
Doing this now is a waste and is just further killing Caldari Ewar.
---
Maybe 5 seconds of jam for lights, 8 for mediums, 10 for heavies? The bigger ships that need more time to align out would be able to carry the bigger drones.
---
to bad that blue salvage  have are mostly stagnating and/or haveing a nose dive in price atm.
---
I'm still happy with what i got!
---
now to lose it and start over!
---
Nah Range Reduction is much funnier.
---
3 T1 Vigils can reduce the Long Range ammo type falloff to 5km.
---
I mean
---
At least you dont think the world revolves around ustz, and included eutz
---
We're getting somewhere, soon you may discover us down in autz
---
Hmm... Compelling! Thanks for breaking it down like that for me.
---
What about a Hecate? Looking in ship tree now and Hecate is a 9d train away only. 14hrs from certs for lvl 2 mastery. Could work? How much does it usually cost to fit a Hecate for FW and lone roaming?
---
in all those weeks of war and all those times where pirat didnt achieve anything. they get a few BS because we decided to lol into their fleet with t1 blapster megas with lower numbers and they somehow think they won now? looks like they have no idea what's happening around them :D
---
Damn, thats crazy
---
That's crazy! How long you been working on getting them all?
---
Why hasn't anyone told him to change the name of his ship?
---
It prevents capital proliferation.
---
"Dont hear anyone complain about them"
---
Have you read a pgl post recently?
---
Or seen the stereotype meme about frt and pla being nothing but botters
---
We see some good fights on TQ, but titans and bosons have become suffocating for a certain subset of gang content, as now every coconut head with 3 brain cells rattling around inside attempts to drop and boson passing gangs in many regions. This wouldn't be a problem if Eve wasn't already incredibly diffusive in player populations outside of those highly protected regions.
---
I think its a pretty big problem when I'm solo podding back home and I get boson'd on the gate by a titan just sitting there, rather than it having to be an actual thought provoking usage of a weapon.
---
My experience is, only if you're a giant dick and/or assist neutrals in killing militia members. That'll get you on the kill on sight list quick.
---
CCP want you to buy Trig ships.
---
ECM is being nerfed into oblivion because its the strongest EWAR against them.
---
Guaranteed the next EWAR nerf thats not to ECM (Im certain they still have ideas about fitting and range nerfs) will be for Remote Sensor Dampening
---
 "So please don't tell me that 2b PLEX prices are the result of ONLY FRAT botters right now " Those prices are the fault of ALL botters, and adding 2000+ more people who think botting is ok is only going to exacerbate the situation.
---
[actually\_ixex](https://www.reddit.com/user/actually_ixex) did, but i appreciate the suggestion
---
I'm just shocked that so many people seem shocked CCP screwed the pooch after announcing they'd support player tournaments.
---
You are definitely better and more reasonable than someone who started a war against a race in the name of hilarious anti-bot.
---
Now that you are done can i have.....cough!.....them....cough!.....pls?
---
Good start man
---
Almost makes me wanna start playing again
---
&gt; working on a comic series based on the Eve/Dust universe
---
Hope you're not planning on making any money on it. Because it's CCP's IP.
---
And it's not like havens are the only anomalies, just the most profitable. People just farmed the most profitable anomaly over and over again while the supply was basically endless.
---
And that most profitable null anomaly can be run in a single AFK faction cruiser, which is just baffling design.
---
Wyvern is the best looking su0er carrier. I considered buying one just for that reason
---
I need to love to null...
---
That was an excellent fight and a lot of fun.  The super was bullshit though, and had nothing to do with us.
---
How about you let me worry about that?
---
so yea its seems you aware of mastery's. if you have at least 3 on a ship then you can fly that pretty well and its worth taking it out. but really your toons actual skills arent quite as important is general knowledge of the game and what kind of engagement profile you have. and that you know just comes with getting out there and trying it out. and learning from other people helps so much so i will re recommend finding a corp.
---
Glad to see you're liking it. If you havent already invest your earnings in new versions of that ship so when you go poof you can get up and going again
---
You sound like the person I was looking for.  I'll be in touch soon.
---
I find this very interesting, as in games such as CSGO, where you are forced to work in a team with random people (and Russians play with the rest of Europe on the servers), this doesn't happen as much and people tend to always communicate in English.
---
But in Eve, where there's no such requirement, people very much separate along language lines...
---
"he thinks is pvp" Most accurate description ever :D
---
It's near the poles so it's slightly askew
---
CCP have a lot on their plate right now.
---
They have to nerf ECM into the ground.
---
They are busy not updating the Thunderdome servers so YET ANOTHER tournement is postponed / cancelled.
---
And those skins arnt going to make themselves.
---
I probably make my first 50M in 15 days lol
---
Yeah that tag is for people who make 8 paragraph long dead serious replies on satire news, not someone who goes "wait, what?"
---
This change beats any I've seen in my 10 years of Eve.
---
ECM drones are pure cancer.
---
If they coupled this with buffing up the other ecm drones or allowing hull bonuses to apply to ewar drones it could be useful. As it is, this doesn't really change anything fundamentally. It's honestly a bit sad to see how unloved ewar drones as a whole actually are.
---
Back when I started did wormholes that appeared in high sec. Occasionally the exit would close and you would have an epic adventure trying to get back home with all the loot.
---
I will, i just need to do some research on improving the ship first.
---
Heh, that requires some next level vigilance. But it still sounds like fun
---
I had help starting with the game. I would still be on the tutorial missions if i went into the game blind
---
This is fundamentally wrong. ECM disrupts the gun spool up. It's not that you're preventing damage with ec drones, but that you're preventing the gun from spooling up and keeping it at 300 dps as opposed to 800.
---
CCP has only had about 2 years to fix the tool since they fired CCP_LogiBro. #BigBrainPlays
---
Having personally dealt with him for quite some time his entire MO is to act like everyone is against him. He's the poor little guy just trying to make his way. Hes just a shitty person. He viewbots like fucking mad. If anything I now know twitchs partner program is a fucking joke.
---
i dont think that bypasses the timer
---
I frequently name mine 'Amarr Control Tower' on the slim chance that someone doesn't pay proper attention on the d-scan results.
---
I am familiar with some of these words.
---
Because theyve already murdered their server and my desire to play most of the multinational games i used to enjoy. I cant even play Apex anymore because about half the time I get very obviously shot through a building, or watch someone go speeding across my screen. The fact that hacking is so accepted, and it fucking ruins the games I play.
---
not on the current patch it isnt.
---
You can use it to actuvely cheese. I had a thing going for a bit where I would use 2 chars with similar names
---
One would assemble the ships so it had its name on it, and lose like 2-3 shitfit Magnates in highsec to rats
---
And the other would use the ships under the name of the first, but be battle magnate fit )) Killed an astero that way
---
Oh come on I am just translating, I am not even PIBG  xD
---
counterpoint: no it isn't
---
I think most people are referring to the majority sov null takeover by pibc, reportedly legal botting, and absurdly extreme inflation of both isk and Plex on serenity. May be others, but those are what I've heard most.
---
fake news sotiyos dont spawn in the southern part of the map, stainguy told me so.
---
"news"
---
Show them who good the show is?
---
Banning people will never have any real effect because anyone who knows how or is willing to learn will always be able just create a new alpha or omega with a different VPN. Always.  FIFY
---
Whats worse is that CCP have said NOTHING about this.
---
CCP Dopamine was happy to Slap this up on the Eve website to get as much publicity from it as they could while doing nothing to organise it. Then they fuck over everyone with nothing said as an apology or explanation as to why this happened.
---
Streamfleet need to decide if CCP can now be TRUSTED to help in the future. This isn't the first time a community run tourney has had to cancel last minute because CCP couldn't get their shit together.
---
The worst thing was, they had a tweet out promoing this yesterday at 1200 Eve Time, then had to delete it within 15 mins
---
Its an eye opener as a new player when you double your net worth on one site.
---
\&gt; Snub
---
Thats EXACTLY the word I was looking for.
---
Thank you.
---
Nice haul!
---
your dedication to the craft is admired
---
Congratulations! What's ME/TE on em?
---
xD
---
Ah yes the coveted faction super BPO
---
9/10 on Supers, 8/10 on Titans. 
---
When I take a bigger break from the game I'll get them each up one more level.
---
Don't think I'll ever get ME 10 on a Titan.
---
I’ll give you 3 bil ^/s
---
note I said anybody, PGL is a nobody.
---
Bat shitlords like you clearly. Tell knobber jobbler what's up.
---
Eve gave me a kind of purpose
---
I didn't know the streamfleet tourney was relying on the AT tournament tool so much.
---
That was probably a mistake, though it sucks that CCP promised you it would be available and then it wasn't.
---
Where do you normally explore? Asking for a friend...
---
Well if they come we should unite and destroy them and their bots
---
You passed our Gatecamp today, we didnt kill you, because your toon was so fresh ;)
---
Cheers mate !
---
They’re starting out in Tama. They say that they aren’t going to join an alliance and they can’t really start taking sov until they get established and build up a capital fleet
---
That's not how you play eve!
---
Yes. The servers are completely unconnected
---
Instead of...what? Yeah Titans need a nerf, no argument there. Or at least some more counters to big blobs of them. Maybe a stealth BC/Cruiser bomber that rapidly fires XL torps at some crazy explosion radius penalty so they suck vs smaller targets?
---
I used to play around in a probe called Scanner Probe. Used it to hunt explorers.
---
Idk ask the NSA and the CIA and Google what they use for everyone
---
Yup, I didn't even know how much i really had until i returned to highsec. It was a good feeling seeing that estimated price
---
Can confirm, lived in J-Space and now even in null when I can see there is no one in local, my finger still habitually spams the d-scan hotkey.
---
I can also report that screenshots from eve occasionally bring about this response.
---
it indeed is, be nice to others. Respect new players. if we happen to see that we killed a toon below 1week we SRP him his ship. Its our tradition 
---
we all were new players once and i bet you too encountered someone who killed you but said sorry afterwards. i had this moment 2008 :)
---
still going to give others the same i received back then
---
what about "you break it, you bought it" ?
---
What I mean by that statement is that, the players on serenity knew that botting is bad, their leadership told them to do it (to my knowledge at least, could be wrong) and they did it. It does not take a rocket scientist to realize that inflation of your currency is bad. They proactively killed off groups/content.
---
It is true that PIBC worked their ass off to get where they did, kudos to them for winning. At the same time they broke rules knowingly and didn't care for the over all state of their server, and that is something we don't want more of on tranquility.
---
Televised ESports started in South Korea in 2000.
---
The South Korean Gov setup the  Korea e-Sports Association to handle setting up the broadcasting of E-Sports, the management of Professional Esports players conditions and saleries. They also regulate the TV channels that broadcast esports like Ongamenet and MBC Game both of which started in 2000.
---
Found the falcon pilot. How’s has your Sabre main been?
---
Oh, thanks for not killing me! I went past a few groups of players on my way to and from where i explored. But i guess they let me pass for being a newbie
---
Please feel free to tell us more about these "coding reason" that allegedly causes sounds to "put tons of stress to your PC".
---
The IT professionals here simply can't wait to hear your detailed technical explanation.
---
Check your Wallet newbie.. Hover over it and read Note...
---
funny haha
---
Does the probe window update immediately now? You used to have to toggle a filter or something to get it to update if it had only been a few minutes since the new sig appeared.
---
Yes make pilots work for it....never take default ship name.
---
You would be amazed at how many pilots don’t do this.
---
praise james
---
I'll always srp a newbros ship after pew-pewing it to pieces. And then make sure to teach and explain how to avoid it. Shoot first, ask questions later. 
---
As a side note, I was in The Marmite Collective for about 3 months before leaving (not our corp's preferred play style). Learned quickly that the newbros have no idea what's going on, and how unfair it is to pick on them. Granted, when a flashy red shows up on grid, shoot it before it has the upper hand, then look up their info. Glad to say I've met and taught several newbros how to avoid it, and gotten them into a better corporation to help them succeed.
---
I'm not on right now and won't be until tomorrow morning. Thank you for whatever you did!
---
It updates immediately. Rolling a static takes about a minute to respawn the wormhole. That sig appears immediately. There are some relatively complex rules with how K162 wormhole sigs appear if left untouched from the other side, but that's off topic here :)
---
Next step: load them all in an interceptor and crash gates in Aridia
---
I guess the downvoters don't appreciate grate puns.
---
If you were shooting ships floating in a market somewhere, sure. But that ship was already bought and paid for by someone else.
---
And "you break it, you buy it" would mean that blowing up their ship deducts the costs of a new ship from your wallet and into theirs, so they can buy a replacement.
---
F this chinese cheaters
---
I was under the impression it was common knowledge StainGuy is in Goons.
---
They do have the posting quality of a Goon, with the quantity of a Dino after all.
---
thats the spirit !
---
You won now delete the game
---
I usually say 'welcome to New Eden' just before the pod pops, reimburse whatever they were flying and open a chat window to see if they need any help. I might be a gatecamping pirate bastard, but I'm a friendly one.
---
What's an alpha :). I'm new at the game

Yeah kind of stupid that an apostle's bay takes up the vast majority of my screen. :(

YOU HEARD HIM BOYS.
---
Don’t worry m8; just some bitter cunts being cunts
---
you get -25% explosion radius   
---
50% Explosion Velocity from max support skills  
---
then  
---
standard crash booster drops explosion radius by 20%  
---
then 3% explosion velocity/ -3% radius from implants  
---
And he's only using faction ammo  
---
should apply very well assuming no draw backs from the crash booster, but you can always pop it before going in to make sure you dont die from a shit drawback roll.
---
Theres other ewar drones? /s
---
Alright, I see people on here and Ingame using “o7” as a greeting. Does it represent a salute?
---
the reason it's so hard to touch bots is local my dude. as soon as a neut enters they warp off. without local they can only do so once you enter grid or d-scan range. problem with d-scan is you can't determin wheter it's friendly or not and once it's on grid it's often too late.
---
Instead of fear-mongering about the chinese hordes coming in to blob titans like titans have never been blobbed before.
---
(Not you in particular, since you are ok with them coming in. But among the people who think PIBC will ruin Tranquility, the ones who aren't talking bots are the guys trying to hold on to the last gasp of elite pvp and don't want any of their big dick toys getting the nerf bat.)
---
Agreed. Maybe lances should stay and bosons should go. Wiping a fleet with a DD should be a bit more challenging IMO.
---
I once warped to a Naglefar named ‘Amarr control Tower” thinking it was a offline pos. I was still very new to the game. One of my first times in lowsec
---
I'd argue in favor of removing or drastically reducing their jump range, limit them to slowly moving through gates. Just say their mass is too big.
---
If I could redesign the game I'd still keep titans but would require an incredibly rare material to produce, something that CCP could manually limit the drop on to control titan production. Plus, and this is total dreaming, but I wish that Dust was implemented for boarding ships -- mini first person shooter matches between marines attempting to board and capture control of capitals during tidi battles.

Exploring has always been the most fun way to make ISK for me. I load up my Astero, undock and set out on an adventure. The most I've got in one trip was 600 million, when I found a C1 wormhole system with 11 safe relic sites only a few jumps from staging.
---
Why's he being down voted? Hes right tho.
---
It is really fun. I'm still yet to look into wormholes but one day i will
---
How is that already 4.2million isk lol

What exactly did you do

&gt; Here is some inspiring message to everyone

Tell me how girthy

But slowly
---
I know i had to Mutch beer this evening
---
I have a super specific question about MTUs. I've noticed that if my MTU has, say, 243,537 Veldspar in it (the overly specific number has a reason) and I were to jettison exactly 26,463 Veldspar from my cargo, the MTU will NOT pick it up, despite that being the EXACT quantity that would fit inside it. I haven't done too many tests with this, but I noticed that when the difference is a more "whole" number, like say, 240k inside and I jettison 30k, it'll work just fine. It's only when it's these exceptionally specific values that it refuses to pick stuff up. Does anyone know exactly why that is, and how it works? It's a bother to always have to keep an eye on that in case the MTU "malfunctions" and I end up with a can floating around.
---
PS.: Please avoid comments of the "you shouldn't afk mine" or "MTUs are dangerous, don't use them" sort. I know all that, I've done my research, I know the risks and trust me, I watch local and D-Scan like a hawk, not to mention other things to stay safe. The question is about how MTUs work, not how to be a miner. Thanks!
---
beer is nice, keep it up
---
us veterans of the game would loveeeee to know WHERE you were exploring.... so we can bring our ships and explore with you!
---
Systems in the game have different security "ratings" (when you open the map and look at a system the is a number next to it, like 0.9). The lower the rating is the less secure the system. I traveled to what's called "nullsec", which are zones with a really low rating. In those systems players are free to kill you, but you can also find much better loot. Ask around on the subreddit for some more experienced players to explain it to you, this is just how i understand it
---
Only 2?
---
oh please....grab some tissues....cry me a river...or go spam local like your masters tell you to
---
Great work!
---
I like our new Chinese immigrants. Maybe they'll drive you and people like you away and we can all be United in that.
---
Yea. To help me with the power of friendship, and high powered lasers
---
Good lord, are you suggesting StainGuy is biased?
---
Haven't anchored it yet but it should be up Tuesday! I have two options for where. I'm deciding between close to jita or pretty far an remote
---
Well it makes sense lol thx :D
---
It’s not isk it’s blueprints
---
If he wanted to sink isk he would sell the blueprints and then biomass
---
lmao, implying im in need of isk
---
Yea Maybe we get some new changes in nullsec  more People in Eve more Fun in Eve
---
Glonn plz
---
You need a place? I have a corp that's recruiting. Message me if you want info
---
Wow way to necro a 4 day old post.
---
Can a Titan be bait?
---
You'll fit right in!
---
Very nice but please, do this: File a similar report about your state of mind about the game every half year from now on. Believe it or not, this is actually extremely valuable information for both devs and players.
---
I've never seen them announce any ban in this way, ever. If you have some sources to prove otherwise, please share.
---
It's completely an option. When has CCP ever, before now, shown they give a fuck about rumors? And no, people wouldn't just move on, but that doesn't matter, does the name Stunt ring any bells for you?
---
How much are the copies worth and how long does it take to make them?
