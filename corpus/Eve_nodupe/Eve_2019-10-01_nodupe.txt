Newbros can fly better in cáncer wings of ewar. A Lot of people gave newbros the tackler rol in fleets, when TBH is where i prefer have the veterans.

A bit before my time but there was a huge culture shift in Rote itself and its a lot more chill now. Most of us are in our mid to upper 30s and don't play like we did 10 years ago.
---
Integritas are tryhards but aside from AP most people there are p chill too.
---
He’s not trash talking you, he’s simply explaining that your response was nonsense and that there has never been majority support for removal of local in null, it has always been a vocal minority.
---
By that same argument, it's incredibly bad sportsmanship to come to someone's space and run when they try and fight you.
---
In short, it's fucking dumb.
---
When you start harassing someone's space, you are making their lives worse. It's the epitome of undeserved entitlement to believe that anyone owes you a fight, let alone people who you are actively trying to hurt.

How is makeing isk worthless a bad thing i mean have u seen these crazzy prices i mean lets just look at supper cap prices thier cheep i mean real cheap compared to before instead of only a few people being able to have them to the point im surprise thier isnt a special edition supper/titan just like the gnosis being handed out by ccp

Koreans can't read English so they aren't concerned with good lore anymore. So buy more plex, 외국인
---
A lot of people are giving you suggestions with no clue what you intend to do with it. That's a very important question before you can make a fit. Bombers are somewhat specialized ships but there are for sure different types. So, what do you want to try and do with your bomber?
---
It's worth noting that a significant number of those lost went to classic wow, who are possibly now returning since the hype wore off. I think it's likely many of those player would have left regardless of blackout.

that is so cute and awesome at the same time
---
I have a rorqual that is my first one.
---
 I got it way back in 2013. I pvp'ed with it, was bait for dread drops, was logi, boosted and compressed on grid way before it was a thing, took it wh diving to mine, been hot dropped so many times I lost count. largest drop was 120 or so bombers, attacked pos's with it, then citadels, and all this before they got a rework. 
---
Post rework I forced a solo dropping nyx to gtfo after I killed all but 1 fighter (this was important, they have to recall, reload, reload fighters, then drop more) per wing, dropped an ess and a cyno inhib and was chewing through his capacitor. he never dropped me again. fought off bomber gangs ranging from 20 to 70 solo.
---
 Saved a group of rorquals solo from 60 bombers. it got to the point where bomber fc's just straight up avoided me. Cowkiller dropped me with his bombers one time, i was kicking ass and then he extracted the group. I asked why, he said "we are here for content, not to BE the content." I shaken the views of several titans when they said their DD was gonna kill me but they only dinked the shield a little bit.
---
 To this day that rorqual still lives. my first rorqual went through a lot. It still lives.
---
Some proofs:
---
[Soloing](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004726/201806031600/) a 20+ bomber gang, Thanatos came when he heard there was a falcon. Was telling comms it's fine I do not need help. But he really wanted that falcon kill. 
---
Proof of the size of his gang: https://zkillboard.com/related/30004742/201806031500/

[Failed](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004727/201803310200/) to save a Thanny bro from a 20 man bomber gang. Sorry bro, you were just made of paper. I tried.
---
[Distance](https://zkillboard.com/kill/68265597/) check fail. This person lit a cyno....then nothing happened. Locked and killed. I assume the person lit it out of range. Le derp.
---
[Rorquals](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004743/201806251700/) got attacked by 60+ Bombers. Fax jumped in and died. I jumped in and started wrecking shit left right and center. Lots of bombers left in structure/armor, would have gotten 20+ kills had all hit or stayed on grid.  I will always remember local. "Fuck you Gray!"
---
For some reason the citadel bashes do not show up on my zkill, nor the POS's. I would love to link those.
---
I chosen to highlight the solo's instead of the ones where I just join in on the fun.
---
Fucked if I know what the traffic difference looks like serverside. I haven't spent a lot of time researching it.
---
Thanks for sharing, thanks for caring.
---
the target is to be able to quantify player stories (which can be gathered by qualitative methods only)  
---
adding  context to data is good but you gotta understand even if this quantitative method can be designed to give accurate info, it won't equal to "the player story"  
---
CCP Workers starting to play EVE is a very big opportunity
---
If every CCP worker keeps a diary of sorts (it's going to be a multiboxing life for them, like most of us down here.) In a year's time they will start  self-regulate their priorities.
---
Ok, so if you're going after PVE'ers running WH combat sites you probably want to go with an afterburner so the site doesn't immediately fuck you up. Don't worry about cap stability at all. Dont worry about target painting since you're primarily looking for battlecruiser sized targets. You may have better luck with a scram since MJDs are a thing. The rest is just DPS and buffer. 
---
If you mean people doing relic and data sites then it's a totally different setup.

Ye... wait... Nooooo!

Eh, provi-bloc is about as independent you can get.
---
They have a lot of friends in Legacy (because legacy siphoned off half or more of their player base), and bat phone a wide variety of entities when anything of real importance is at risk. But legacy has not come by to purge the area of entities hostile to provi-bloc yet.
---
Test mostly just wants to occasionally remind everyone in the provi area that they are the power house in the region and could flip it on a whim if they wanted to...

So doing pvp in a stealth bomber is not the way to make cash then? Guess I'll stick to making money doing site, and only hunting down people for fun xD
---
I tore Command Ships 5 and all the gang warfare skills right out of my alts head and stuffed them into rounding out my mains gunnery skills the day off grid links died. I only trained that pilot just in time for the change essentially, got like 4 months of my own offgrid booster. Fun while it lasted. I get more mileage out of Small through Large Projectile Turret 5.
---
Legacy shows up for content or to maintain the balance of power (limit the chance of provi failscading)
---
That's crap, dude. Seriously. There are A LOT of people who multibox legitimately. You are not helping anything by accusing everybody of being bots.
---
With insurance, its not really a sink but a faucet. The Isk you used to buy a ship just went to someone else, rather than removed from the game.
---
No we were winning. Winning so hard you couldn't and still can't believe it. Matter of fact we were so fed up and sick of winning and you losing we even let goons win in the end so you still lose.
---
Misquoting him like that only proves that you're an idiot.
---
&gt; was his life (EVE) mission.
---
Who?
---
Actually this exists if you're willing to pay for it. The newest techniques use machine learning to identify and catalogue traffic. The most likely place you'll see it in action is if you fly with a major US airline who have in-flight Wi-Fi. I can't find the thread right now but there was a great write up in a comment on either /r/netsec, /r/sysadmin or /r/networking. The Chinese government is looking to implement a similar system, the main issue is simply the processing power required to run the analyzer on very large volumes of traffic. 
---
It's pretty much impossible to fool these things because they analyze the entire stream, not just individual packets or ports. If you shape your traffic to try and not have it recognized as a VPN it'll last about 30 seconds before the ML algorithm realizes what you're doing, blocks you and logs that pattern to watch it for it later.
---
Is there a better target? Would one net me more profit over the other?
---
Prolly some sort of bot.
---
That should work. It's not like there are easy ways around IP blocks that Chinese nerds all know by heart. /s
---
April/May of 2010; We (Primary.) went out to help SYS-K in Esoteria.  Though it was kind of awkward because the day before we deployed, their military head left for vacation and we couldn't do any actions without their approval, so it was more confusion and fucking about than actually doing anything of actual military importance.  By the time that they came back, a lot of shit had fallen and we were given the call to fall back.
---
the biggest problem for eve has and always will be...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
the playerbase
---
Ya, but that is basically purely because RocketX. We don't share any command structure or show up to any panfam objectives.
---
Test shows up to help provi more often than Panfam shows up to help Phew/HTP and I don't claim provi-bloc to be part of Legacy.
---
Horde is not blue but is the most likely entity in Panfam to show up, we batphone when we know provi has batphoned to balance out the numbers. Though occasionally we end up with more because its hard to bring just a few horde dudes.
---
TBH we would probably batphone goons in place of panfam some times if they were willing to work with us and didn't already get asked by provi.
---
Those exhumers went away because they were so easy to gank. It's a perfect example of the hunters exterminating their prey.
---
Most of sov null is wasted space.
---
Groups hold it because they can, not because they use it.
---
But I didn't say they owe you a fight.  There's a nuance that perhaps I didn't elaborate properly.  
---
Mechanics to ROFLSTOMP every incursion into your systems is bad game play in a PvP game.  And supporting it because you want to demoralize other people is bad sportsmanship.  Think about that statement, it is saying, "I want to take the enjoyment out of playing the game with me".  That should never be the goal of a game you play with others.  
---
This is not the same thing as saying, I want mechanics that prevent me from being farmed by every incursion into our system (which is reasonable).  There's a tit for tat that's healthy for PvP, and this is fundamentally a PvP game.  I fully acknowledge that balancing this is a nightmare in a game as complex as Eve, but mechanics that regularly allow 40+ players to clash in battle and have a completely one-sided outcome is objectively bad game play.

Hail Bob!
---
Mango is botting on mass, like literally put a blue toon there for a couple of day's and observe.
---
This problem isn't unique to EVE online, or gaming.
---
I've never botted, but unlike your special breed of moron, I am also capable of understanding the difference between bots and people who are simply better at the game than me. It's quite pathetic how some of you need to excuse your lack of skill and understanding by accusing everybody of being bots, just to cope with your inadequacies.
---
&gt; After learning those lessons, then progressing to logi is a good secondary as it is definitely easier for a newbro to be useful to a fleet as logi then tackle.
---
Definitely. And for a newbro, logi is good because it's often cheaper than DD ships. For T1 ships, compare a Brutix to an Exequeror or a Ferox to an Osprey. T2 ships are still out of a newbro's likely budget, but I just looked up the cost of a Guardian and HAC for the same doctrine. Guardian is still cheaper (by roughly the cost of a fully fit T1 battlecruiser).
---
Hilarious part is that CCP seems to think the solution is to make it even MORE tedious, instead of more engaging.  Cuz tedium definitely stops bots.  Eeeyup.
---
Killing explorers is worth way way more and tends to be lower risk. May be easier to find targets in nullsec than WH space though.
---
Just to add to this, /r/eve is super lax about moderating what Reddit could constitute as "abuse" - we let you guys call each other cunts and whatnot and as long as it's not homophobic or racist it's pretty much fair game.
---
Depending on how new rules play out, we could be forced to start automoderating certain words and removing content that'd otherwise be ok.
---
My advise would be to start being more creative with your insults, perhaps we can refer to each other as the right honourable player before our back and forth..
---
My Prowler was the first ship I seriously tried to train into. Bought the ISS Shangri-La six years ago, and has been through numerous lowsec adventures, including once almost getting awoxed. I've bought another one, for the more dangerous transport runs, but I still take my original out.

"Aight. Now its like wormhole space."
---
"Wait what?!"
---
Gotta get rolling and scan, my man.
---
So, Legacy in 2019 is just stronger (since they aren't actually losing any wars right now) GOTG?
---
It's almost like literally everything you said is already contained in my original post.
---
That does not work, especially in an open world environment like eve has. If you limit corps membership then you will see corp1, corp2, corp3. It happens in other games that do have limits on players in a group. Fleets are already told to not shoot unless something is broadcasted, which renders any limits on blue list useless. If you start forcefully dissolving groups that do that then you will see more neutral operations like certain blops and ganking groups will focus on targeting certain groups.
---
They made it more difficult for bots with the blackout, then backed out because they're more concerend about money from botting accounts than the game itself.   
---
CCP is not going to do jack shit
---
That’s not harassment, you’re acting like a child and people are calling you out on it.

Poop, I missed that one.  Literally fit all the things the ship is not bonused for.

---
Try it. It's fun.
---
Okay bro, have fun living in your fantasy narrative, because reasons... 
---
I’ll never understand how people can deny that losing a high SP pilot to a bot ban back in the day meant a LOT more before injection was possible, or before you could run 50 alpha clones on a VPN. The current mechanics of EVE simply make botting easier, thus more bots. The Serenity migration didn’t help either.
---
But if you just killed 3 now you bring 20 more raxes...eventually you hold grid *and* you're isk positive, if you give up like a little bitch coz there's a bit of red on your kb then...you're a little bitch. :p
---
"XD Blue more people" The Tapi mouth breather right here lmao
---
You must have 50k Blues to ride this ride.
---
While true, I feel much safer in wh space than claimed nullsec
---
This is fairly disingenuous. Few people deny that fw and pve and citadels need tweaks (if not outright reworks). Only a handful were clamouring for local or cyno changes.
---
Out of game tools are powerful enough now that people will just use those to coordinate and maintain unofficial alliances. There's no real way to shatter the large blocs short of wiping out their entrenched assets and forcing them to scrabble to rebuild in a less farmable version of 0.0 (which won't happen). Look at the salt over blackout and then imagine how people would react if CCP straight up deleted cap fleets and citadels (or blew them up with OP turbodrifters).
---
I miss snuff box :(

You know there is rarely a 'best' way.  Making a decision rationally using a feedback model invariably produces good results or leads to good results with the follow up decision.  Ergo any decision to (to correct a problem) is generally better then doing nothing.
---
A lot of good ideas have been put forth, and anyone of them could work well when using a proper decision tree, then following up as often as it takes.  The worst thing is doing nothing.  
---
Where this doesn't work is when you radically design an entirely new process to 'fix' something, because you introduce a whole new set of problems.  This is often CCPs method, when all they needed to do was tweak some things.
---
For this to work data is only a fraction of usable info.  Experience and first hand knowledge are far more important.
---
Unless you find a dps fit because ecm doesnt protect the jammer anymore
---
A simple, partial fix for boring PVE is to increase stacking penalties.  I know y'all are squeamish about making anything more ~~less tedious~~ difficult, but that's a basic principle of designing a game.
---
Solitary players being able to tank a whole room while afk is not an example of good game design.  Resists are obviously too high.  
---
Make most of PVE into co-op content, and bots will become easier to detect.  There are lots of ways to make NPCs meaner, or less predictable, but this is the most low effort way.
---
Sorry if you lose your favorite minmax fit, but frankly the meta needs to be stirred once in a while.
---
&gt;Imagine believing botting on TQ started in 2017.
---
That's literally not what he said. Stop being disingenuous.
---
&gt;My favorite one is the people who think that eliminating drone auto-aggression will somehow stem the tide of botting.
---
Literally no-one believes that. The line is that getting rid of auto-aggression will *reduce* botting *and* AFK activity, forcing players to actually be active at their computers designating targets.
---
How is this valid, every business competes with other priducts in their industry. If wow classic is taking eve customers then ccp have to look at why they are losing to their competitors product but its not just a because wow classic excuse every business alive needs to constantly deal with competiton its not a valid excuse for sub standard services.

Just get rid of alliances.  Corp limit should be about 100.  
---
&gt;Allow for a limited number of blue tags per corp
---
Maybe a few.  I say get rid of them completly.  No standings tags at all.  No overview Corp tickers.  No API producing Intel.
---
&gt;Dissolve corps/alliances. More mutiny. Do something you worthless F1 drone fucks.
---
Yes.  I'm afraid it might be too late now...  Eve has become a PvE game.  It would take significant salt to do now.
---
The ol' sov4tress
---
Having been there, I can tell you, without a dedicated ewar fleet, no matter how useful the maulus may be - you just don't see the use as much. It doesn't feel as viscerally satisfying as seeing the ship you're visibly pinning down with your very own scram get blapped to bits.
---
So does that mean that EvE is built to fail? That WoW with its ability to reset to baseline with every expansion/patch is what players prefer more?
---
More like CCP please change the following things:
---
Sov war
---
faction warfare
---
finish ship tieracide
---
CCP:   
---
Ok here you go: 
---
Fucks with local and cynos for no fucking reason instead.
---
nobody asked for WH space, multiple different version of ACTUAL delayed local were put forward CCP went with no local.
---
Its not a sandbox anymore. CCP has been moving more and more toward the instant reward zero wait time theme park style of wow for a decade.

One of the most popular expansions in Eve history was Crucible, which was just a ton of small changes and fixes that had been repeatedly shoved on the back-burner.

I'm just RPing

It's almost like the PvP'ers can't be bothered to try killing rorquals that panic, citadels that can TZ tank to some ass-end shit 8-11 days later, or the fact that there is no reason at all to take another region since they are all just as good as the next when upgraded....

I know as an FC I'm running out of fucks to give. Blackout was the first thing in two years that got me excited again and all the krabs bitching killed that off. Turns out now all those people you see roaming actually ARE bots! Who thought...

Out of game tools can be ruined by disallowing Intel based API.  But yeah the time to act was 2013 when people first recognized n+1 as a major problem, back when things were shaken up by b-R

I had a Loki, the *Darden Claden*.
---
I have no idea at all what the name meant or where it came from, but it was a gift from a corp mate as we were leaving the corp and the entirety of my assets got blown up on a lowsec gate camp to me hitting the wrong button. Apparently, he was given the ship by one of his previous CEOs, three years ago.
---
Funny thing was, the Loki was so old at that point that it still had the extra Subsystem, and thus had a really wonky module layout when I first tried to get into it. Second funny thing was that when he gave me the ship, it was two months before I could actually fly it. However the moment I could fly it, I immediately became an absolute Loki fanatic, constantly refitting it to fill any possible role I could need for any solo or fleet operation.
---
Sadly, the *Darden Claden* was destroyed in battle last month, in an attempt to gank a Tengu that turned out to be HG Crystal Bait with an Abyssal modded Nightmare sitting behind it... thankfully, the Tengu was destroyed for his trouble, and the loot was used to reincarnate the *Darden Claden* as my new flagship, the *Unknown Soldier*.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if there were no damage caps and timers were less terrible?
---
VNI so much time pass together.
---
I'm not entirely sure at this point what a sandbox truly is. 
---
In WoW you can gather resources for crafting and craft (mining and manufacturing equivalent in EvE), yes it's simplified, yes a lot of the stuff that's best for your character can not be made, but that's where the PvE aspect comes in, and PvP too up to a degree.
---
You can do PvE solo or in small or large groups, most of it is repeatable (equivalent of ratting, doing missions or incursions in EvE) in this case WoW has a lot more variety.
---
WoW has a market, provided the market is fairly simplified and limited to the server.
---
The only difference would be the PvP aspect and territory ownership. 
---
But what exactly is the sandbox? In both games you can do a wide variety of content and no one is forcing you to do one thing or the other. Except WoW gets an expansion with new PvE content every few years and class rebalances while EvE gets a minor tweak to several ships along with some small newish feature from time to time with PvE staying the same for years and years.
---
I don't think it's built to fail, I just don't think it's a good comparison to make.  
---
WoW's easier to pivot but lacks depth and player agency.
---
EvE has more depth and more player agency, but less ability to pivot.
---
It's a trade off for the targets being different demographics of players.
---
WoW tends to try and cater to the short term gratification players.  
---
EvE tends to try and cater to the players in it for the long haul.
---
That said, I believe there are far more instant gratification players then there are long haul players these days.  I think ratio was a bit different in the early days of EvE, more towards the longer term gamer.
---
Not that I can provide any real confirmation, but I have also heard that there is a Chinese FC who is a PLA officer

you should send this to dunk
---
god if only there were modules that let you counter diminish weapon optimals or lock ranges. that would surely fuck up some kitey nano bullshit, I bet!
---
#Valued meatshield
---
It won't reduce botting at all, except for a week or two as the scripts change.
---
Looks like he had a bad day!
---
Literally yes, but proviposters spin it as them vs the world
---
That doesn't look fake at all nope.
---
I believe that is part of the joke.
---
You're actually wrong, so perhaps avoid trying to sperg at people pointing that out to you lmao.
---
Remember RMT is only as effective as the people willing to buy the ISK. ISK buyers ultimately do have an effect on the game, at the top end, when mass ISK is released into circulation through purchases etc, but ultimately the biggest loser in an RMT situation is CCP due to lost profits.
---
FYI you could purchase pilots previously, and there was a lucrative market for ratting ready characters, so I'm not sure what you're really talking about.
---
The botting situation is bad, yes, but to claim that it's significantly more dire than 2,4,6,7 years ago is just fallacy, since you have no data to support or disprove your claim, save dropping player counts (which is mostly because CCP abuse this game rather than a reaction to botting so unrelated for the most part).
---
Ah, my apologies, that makes more sense.
---
I would still take a position somewhere in between though. 
---
&gt; mechanics that regularly allow 40+ players to clash in battle and have a completely one-sided outcome is objectively bad gameplay. 
---
This was the broader discussion going on at the time and is a sentiment I entirely agree with. I firmly believe that the most fun fights are the ones where both sides lose ships and that moving the game design more in that direction is a good thing. It's no fun when you are hard-countered, and your options are to get massacred or not to fight.
---
On the other side, Dunk's point is still entirely valid. Sportsmanship or not, if you regularly supply fun fights to those who are coming to harass you, you are encouraging more people to harass you more often. In effect, the people who are providing the best gameplay for others are themselves suffering the most. Brave, in particular, has something of a history of being farmed for the amusement of more powerful groups they cannot contest.
---
I'm not sure how to improve this state of affairs. It feels like the alliances creating the best content are the ones who get punished for it. Meanwhile, the submarine alliances whose members become invisible when hostiles arrive benefit the most. You wind up with a self-reinforcing loop where the alliances that are "fun" to harass experience more harassment, while the invisible ones are left alone. The best thing I can come up with is a global change to the map to make sure that more(maybe every?) sov nullsec region is within jump range of an NPC station. That would make some of the emptier regions both less painful to live in, and easier to harass.
---
Yeah one half is a lighter shade of blue.
---
Awesome
---
No doubt but a t2 magic Merlin fit costs about 6m. You could fly 25 of them for the cost of one worm. A few well fit t1 frigs will drop it every time for a fraction of the cost.    
---
Worm is an awesome ship as are all the caldari gal hybrids. But the cost is quite a bit. T2 frigs will give it a run 1v1 for a third the cost per fit. I rather run roaming gangs of cheaper ships where you can drop one or 2 fancy ships and lose and still come out isk positive.     
---
Just had a battle last week where my pve osprey/gnosis fleet engaged a very fancy fleet. We jumped in knowing we'd lose. But we dropped a t3c that cost twice our entire fleet :)
---
You do get that staying around in hostile space for a couple of hours isn't that hard for most experienced fleet's right? like if a setup wants to be disruptive and be in space they could ignore you undocking completely. 
---
Also given the ships in question that seems very unlikely to be the intention of the hostiles because that comp is really ill-suited for such an activity ( it's not impossible but there are much better comps at doing harassment out there ). 
---
Like it shocks me that a roaming gang that likely goes in with the knowledge of there about to feed you like 5 to 10 billion command ships is viewed in such a negative light like really.
---
&gt;Just not a priority until recently. Same reason it took 15 years to realize wardecs were killing new players. They don't seem to care until shit hits the fan. Senior management appears generally uninformed or uninterested as long as revenue comes in.
---
Not sure if it's good or bad for eve community to share this. I guess if this encourages more people then it may tip the scale where CCP needs to handle it. But if they can't handle it, then this will have a harmful effect.
---
EvE has also been shifting more and more towards the instant gratification demographic with Skill Injectors becoming a thing.
---
It would be the red in the wallet not the red on the killboard. Maybe everyone can't afford to throw away 20 thoraxes each to kill 20 sleps. Or maybe they dont have the hours it would take to do it.
---
It doesn't have to be a negative light though. The point is he doesn't want to take that fight, and doesn't view being isk positive in the described fight as worth his time.
---
It's not fake lol whats the point of doing that
---
#[USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST]

Karma
---
They need to create automatic bot detection programs (or implement a csgo overwatch like system) rather than going after each report manually. Also, afk ratting/mining should be nerfed hard.
---
Yes and no, it's a way to catch up but still, you need to put in the hours to do anything with the new toy.
---
Skill injectors allow the players to shift rather quickly, but the material objectives can't be bought with SP.
---
Personally, I think they amplify every misstep CCP makes by allowing us to instantly capitalize on created issues.  
---
Ex: Rorquals changes wouldn't have been so bad, if it took a month or two for everyone to shift gears while CCP tweaked output numbers. 
---
Instead we were on that in hours, and the amount of outrage if they'd nerfed it into the ground after people blew money into removing barge skills and injecting Rorqual skills would have been amazing.
---
All they can do is change the fucking game so it isnt so easy to bot!  I'm sorry but if the fire department cant keep up stop building more wooden houses. They already have the AI with diamond rats and abyss... This was supposed to be part of the chaos era!  Fuck!!
---
So I can't 'grr goons hat goons' anymore? WTF reddit?
---
It's not my oldest ship, but I won a nicely fit Stratios in a corp contest on our 4 year anniversary fleet a year or so ago.
---
I fly it all the time and somehow haven't gotten popped yet.
---
My gripe was Tony not describing what the ships looked like, hes just flat out said the name of the ship. I know it's based on the game but it pulled me out of the immersion. Its Like he assumed everyone that read his book would automatically know what they look like.
---
lol... heres the un edited clip  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKy4g3snWyQ&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKy4g3snWyQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
I used to think NPC station spam was a good idea.  I'm not sure that's really that beneficial, though.  
---
I think the answer is to make that feedback loop a good thing.  More harassment improves your space, and perhaps more farming diminishes your space.  Raising/dropping true-sec is an old idea to implement this.  And I realize there needs to be some checks and balances to prevent player abuse, but imagine if allies had to regularly "unblue" and fight each other or their space becomes almost worthless.
---
Election season heating up in the USA and now reddit reserves the right to just outright ban people without a warning... sounds about right... this place really is turning into the liberal dystopia we all feared it would
---
certainly not anymore eh :)
---
I have a ashimmu that I've gradually upgraded with loot over time to many times its original value. 23 killmarks and counting.
---
Do more that many corps/alliances use TS3 or mumble for voice comms due to wanting more robust administration capabilities.
---
Most that I have joined just use discord for pings and offline chat.
---
Eve is a very sysadmin heavy game with most major powers and even a lot of the smaller ones operating a plethora of 3rd party/in house tools.
---
Don't worry, in no way we are. In fact you are not even an eve player now!
---
From what I've heard Brave are fed up being overfarmed. They are a new player focused alliance without an umbrella that are seen by some groups as an easy place to farm kills using more experienced pilots and more expensive doctrines. It's no surprise the mentality has shifted from "Yey a fight", to "Fuck off and stop harassing our players ".
---
About a decade ago I remember making a Vampire: The Masquerade character who adopted the name Menace after they were turned because they figured they were a monster now and wanted to embody a primordial concept and basically become an anthropomorphic personification of that concept. They figured you can kill an individual but not an aspect of the universe, so if they were killed the concept would endure. So now Intergalactic Headquarters wants to ban... an aspect of the universe. A particularly slippery one, at that. It's all just so vague, like the IRL cop bullshit that makes it so anyone can get arrested anytime anywhere. Last time I checked, half the most downvoted posts on reddit are mod abuse. Just logged into Imgur and saw mod abuse hit the front page. It's never gray area, either. It's always the most obnoxious middle-school bullying, like something you'd see in an 80's movie, and even then, think "that's unrealistic." Mod abuse is not just a reddit problem, it's an "every URL ever" problem. I have yet to see a solution to that problem, and while I don't want to condemn reddit for not fixing a fundamental flaw in the internet, I can point out that they're making it worse, not better. 1 strike, zero tolerance, vague rules that can apply to any situation? I thought these kids were campaigning IRL for these 90's era war-on-crime measures to be repealed in the US.
---
Cool. One side jams. The other burns away at 5km a second. Amazing leet pvp
---
er, damps and/or TDs instead of jams m8. Also why not have your own 5km/s ships? They arent mutually exclusive to one side, ya know? Also, the lach has a bonus to point range, and command dessies give off links that extend that bonus + allow you to maybe boosh on top of/in front of them?
---
The only 2 ships that I have that could be considered special to me are the ship I got from my first time running the tutorial (back when it ended with a suicide mission, I was given a trash one to use for that by the guy who got me into eve) and my pacifier, I grinded project Discovery and mined to build that one when PD got it's revamp and added them as rewards.
---
I agree that anyone going into an organization to makes changes in a video game, needs to have a practical understanding of how that video game works, including coding knowledge.    
---
IMO, the situation that would lead to the best possible result for the players, would be the ability to vote for 1-5 people with proven coding skills and prowess in the game as interns with a 6 month provisional employment contract, subject to renewal upon review. This would, in the very least, force CCP to have some sort of training program constantly going, with fresh blood constantly injected into the system. I think this sort of setup would create a very contentious and competitive atmosphere working at CCP, which for the light hearted just wouldnt work. And as the saying goes, the creme rises to the top.    
---
But, the one glaring true facts detail that will always defeat this concept is the fact that CCP is headquartered in fucking Iceland of all places, and no one in their right mind would move there to pursue a video game development career.. and when you put it like that, suddenly you realize what's been wrong with this game, all along
---
&gt;  imagine if allies had to regularly "unblue" and fight each other or their space becomes almost worthless.
---
I can think of little worse. Sometimes it feels like community is the old thing holding the game together at that point. After Blackout, I am somewhat paranoid about anything else that threatens it.
---
What the game needs is not to tear down the few surviving communities in the game, but to make it easier for smaller or newer communities to grow and thrive.
---
I agree, back in "the day" alts had multiple roles because unless you were someone who planned ahead to make pilots to sell on the bazzar, all your alts were always training, and had to be subbed in full - there was no injectors nor extractors, so when you wanted to set up a new alt to say mine with, you either had to sub it up and train it manually, buy it from the bazzar or train it on a slot on an already existing account.
---
These days that has long gone, I can just make an account, smash injectors into the first guys head to meet my needs, make sure to get cybernetics V for a training clone and start SP farming, then the sub is nearly free, throw in a well placed alt making some side ISK via PI or something else passive and bang, free alt x as many times as desired.
---
Winning is winning. /s
---
You'd be surprised by how many people in EVE code...
---
These are genuinely terrible ideas. It is true that MMO economies are different from IRL economies in the way that IRL only governments print currency and URL every single player is printing currency every time they kill a mob. However IRL still has a problem with bots; here we call it automation. As for making PvP more profitable, you're still dealing with inflation, except now even more noobs are getting toasted by veterans and leaving the game before their first week, and they have no way of catching up, because they need PvP kills to get money for ships and skillbooks and such, but they can't get those things because PvP is completely lethal for them until they get all that. Superadd to that the fact it will take about a day for the botters to program bots that fight and kill each other constantly in an infinite loop and suddenly the entire currency is worthless due to currency inflation not seen since Weimar Germany.
---
Fun fact.  The best solo frig PvP I ever had was with off grid links in t1 ship.  If people came at me in t1, I would leave the links off and cloaked.  If they came in blobs, t2 or pirate faction ships, I would use them.  It really evened the odds and would get me several fights per hour in faction war plexes.  I won about as much as I lost, but I could engage so much more, after off grid links were nerfed, I could only get like 1 decent fight every couple hours, that's how many people roll in op ships who mostly only interested in fighting t1...
---
I got a large rigged vengeance, and my first ever carrier. both of them don't really have any funny stories aside from when I YOLOed my niddy onto a WH gang and damn near lost it if my buddy didn't come clear the sabre bubbling me
---
This sub typically doesn't get too many RL politics discussions, I doubt they care enough about FW to start oppressing imaginary 'undesirables'
---
I get what you're saying whole heartedly but... _Was he wrong?_
---
botting is not killing EvE....its the blue donut my friend
---
In my experience, regular good fights with your neighbors really builds respect and camaraderie, but that's from my time in small gang PvP.
---
CCP has done several things very well.  The idea of using your space to improve your space is fundamentally a beautiful thing.  They've primarily limited this to PvE activity, although they dabbled with the PvP aspect of this in FW (to debatable success).  My point, using the positive feedback to benefit those regularly undocking and engaging is the type of mechanic that fundamentally eliminates Dunk's complaint.
---
I've seen something similar hit my ship.  Quite a few times over the years, but not recently.
---
It was always a 'WTF' moment, as every time I was cloaked, and wondered if I had been uncloaked and attacked.  However, that was never the case; I was still cloaked.
---
That is extremely odd. Given the location i wonder if it has anything to do with the bug where all the color disappeared on you the other day.
---
Are l5 bots a thing?
---
Is the Reykjavik airport the main hub these days or is Keflavik?
---
Edit: to be fair to the new location, the current one doesn’t look like any sort of garden spot. Not like they’re moving from Santa Monica to the Inland Empire.
---
If you find a WH which leads to somewhere inside NULL you can be pretty safe - if you jump in from high its a little different.
---
How many refineries can there be on the same moon? Can there be more than one?
---
CCP gets the majority of their money from the PVE hordes. This is ultimately unsustainable but hey if they can drag it out for ten years more who cares right!?
---
RMT has always been a part of EVE.
---
At that time there was a fuckload of overtly racist shit and the mods really just let it go, no big deal, just naked ugly racism. Who cares if there are a lot of Chinese just playing i.e. trying to have a good time, being shit on daily with spam about how horrible they and their country are?
---
It's like only half of the original sound is playing.
---
And there's no visible effect when a shrink occurs.
---
Isn't that kind of our thing?
---
instructions unclear my dick is stuck in my floppy drive
---
Do you know what that word means?
---
...
---
Was it ever up for debate? That's obvious. What dumbass blackout lovers cant seem to grok that a random elite pvp small gang lowsec player is not more valuable to CCP than someone who mutliboxes 3 nullsec chars.
---
not all corps/alliances use discord some use TS and other use mumble
---
Like Xtra Squishy needs more Karma lol
---
Combat fitting is alive and possible under certain contrived conditions, most notably a fax in triage that is not combat boosting.
---
Because he's trying to look at the impact of the blackout in specific, and wow classic release messes with those numbers as an unrelated event
---
I've recently just returned in eve, and am looking to start a mining/industry career in nulsec. I have joined a large alliance. I also have two accounts with a high lvl miner and a combat main with hauling training. I am looking for profit, but also just want to chil and do it, not looking to min max.
---
What kind of mining setup should I be doing? What kind of manufacturing would you recommend to focus on in nul? Are there any ores you would say I should buy and haul in rather then mine?
---
"Its not so much a Non-Invasion Pact as it is neither of us wanting to invade the other guy"
---
wat?
---
So 4chan Eve general will get more traffic and still be cancer?
---
can u be more specific?
---
It’s literally just you claiming I’m wrong. And perhaps provide evidence for your own claims before sperging about me. That’s probably too much trouble for you though. I mean, why do that when you can be condescending instead? 
---
Here’s exactly why you’re wrong:
---
As I said, the current nature of EVE facilitates botting now more than at ANY other point in its history. Before injection, losing a multi-year trained character to a ban was way more significant. With current mechanics, whatever money bots make and launder before CCP catches them goes right back in to rolling another character. That didn’t happen as smoothly before injection. You’d have to buy a costly new character or sit on your hands and wait for skills to train. These are just facts.
---
The next big difference from before is Alpha VPN multiboxing. That didn’t exist until recently, but you selectively chose to ignore it. With the right setup, you can produce mountains of ISK while contributing absolutely nothing to the game. Before, you had to pay a subscription cost to make those RMT dollars. Chinese Alpha VNI blobs were *everywhere* before CCP nerfed the ship. Now it’s mostly Dominixs. But the point is, you don’t even have to pay a sub cost to make money anymore. This is different from days of old.
---
Lastly, take look at current RMT prices - for everything imaginable - and compare them to previous values. Injectors are around $4, whereas before they could be as high as $7. Illegitimate character sale prices are also much lower. A 90m SP pilot could go for hundreds more than it does today. As you said, RMT is community driven, so the bottomed out pricing comes from an excess in supply. But I’m sure that has absolutely nothing to do with thousands of players migrating from a server where cheating is a way of life. A shift in demographics has occurred on tranquility, and with it, came a shift in culture. All of this ultimately led to more botting.
---
Enjoy your bogus narrative though. Undock sometime and go roaming. You’ll see just how bad botting is today, and it wasn’t this bad before.
---
There are simple changes to fix this but it will cause people to bitch and moan so much that it will be blackout 2.0. CCP is scared of their income maybe. It'd be nice if they spent less money on failed ideas and realized they are a 1 product company.
---
What's pathetic here is your sperging. Are you actually special needs? I need to know if I should adjust my expectations down-wards.
---
The cni has always, always, always needed fitting room.  This is not debatable,  it's a fact.  They gave it drones.
---
Just as a solitary example.
---
Well then the book would’ve been a wikipedia if he added descriptions for each ship mentioned.  The book is already at 75 chapters.
---
The more interaction a bot needs with the game, the more chances for CCP to detect it.
---

You welped a bomber fleet with a ship and now it is "cursed"? More like "blessed"!
---
Salvager fit tackle ships always have a certain special place in our hearts.
---
Reykjavik is only used for domestic flights, Keflavik is the international airport.
---
The current office location is quite good, with a number of bars, restaurants, and hotels close by. The new one has the airport and the university and not much else.
---
I run fortress in 0 tank carrier and never died, probably players not aligning out and getting tackled after they finish the site and not being able to align in time
---
Not sure if anyone has posted about this already. So I figured I'll do it anyway. My guess is that this is some 'pre triangle dreadnought' shenanigans.
---
There's also the issue that this becomes massively annoying to the user after a while. If I had to click on a pop-up even every hour, I'd very quickly come to just drag it to the side or minimise it and just ignore it, especially if I'm in the middle of a big fight where my attention is focused elsewhere. If you allow people to just ignore the pop-up then bots will come to ignore the pop-up as well and if you ban people who ignore the pop-up then a lot of legit users who walk away from their computers (such as when I'm docked and want to get a cup of tea or when I'm cloaked in a deepsafe and want to go out for a burger) will get banned.
---
It's not a very good solution all around because it's going to have a combination of a high false-positive rate, low actual effectiveness, and high degree of frustration for legitimate players.
---
wagging intensifies
---
Too bad that one was the worst book
---
I don't really own it per se, but I have a soft spot for kestrels.  Day four or five of playing back in 2008, "home at last"  was playing on the jukebox, and I was like "oh my god so much more power than my noobship, \*whooooooooaaaaaaa\*  wait they make BIGGER ships?  Cruisers?!?!"
---
But I still loved that specific kestrel.
---
the sentinel isnt a jamming bonused ship tho
---
Pure, unadulterated, high-grade whataboutism.
---
Your posting is menacing me and abusing me.
---
I know it's more than a few, but it's a niche within a niche. I doubt it could support a real game.
---
Better than nothing but it requires that CCP hire a lot of GMs to handle the task. Given how much their staff has shrunk over the last few years I'd say that's not a good solution in practice.
---
This actually proves his point. CCP tends to extremes.
---
They went to the extreme of blackout, which was a good experiment, and then instead of dialing it back to a delayed local like everyone suggested, they just removed blackout. 
---
CCP could have so very easily tried different lengths of time for delayed local, it's not a hard experiment to find a middle ground between not perfect intel and not complete darkness, but they didn't even try that before just panic reverting it.
---
Le Sigh
---
I have a kikimora named kikis delivery service 
---
I always ask it if loves me.
---
Fact: due to currency conversion in different regions, buying plex with RMB or RUB on Steam is way cheaper on CCP's official website or with, let's say Caucasian money, on Steam
---
&gt; This actually proves his point.  
---
Uh. Wasnt trying to disprove it.
---
Now PA is in the picture they can't do anything. They'll have profit goals to meet and CCP can't do anything drastic that will jeopardise that.
---
Monetisation is going to steadily get more aggressive until the game is sucked dry and shut down.
---
I mean that's the point right? No one asked for it but CCP decided SURE LETS DO THAT INSTEAD!
---
Then get some catalysts and fucking gank them.
---
Half a dozen catalysts (at 2-5 mil each) will chew through the gila before CONCORD arrives, leaving you very isk positive. Just make sure you've got a plan to ninja loot.
---
They'll keep you occupied for weeks before they have to change their strategy.
---
They scan everything they can warp to.
---
Oh fuck off.
---
One of the things that comes to mind almost immediately is the fact that so many players have..."done it."  The intensity of your first conflict, your second, hell even your 5th-10th was pretty awesome.  But after a while, Things just get...stale.  Your wide-eyed wonder at all the things happening around you, the political intrigue, etc, fades with repetition.
---
Ok can we bring back kugu now
---
No way *that* would get abused strategically...
---
Yeah, the Texas Burger joint is right across the street. 
---
But the whole neighborhood looks like it should smell of fish. 
---
The vibe i get from the Google Streetview photos of the city and the regions outside is Big Island Hawaii with way worse weather. Everything looks that little bit temporary.
---
Not everyone want to play spaceship kiting every single time they undock.
---
That might be a good solution to some of the citadel spam...
---
Sorry about your terrible failed thread
---
Yes the game is a on verge of dying after blackout removal not when blackout was happening, that is totally how it is happening. Protip the next step if blackout had continued was hunters crying about there being no targets without the self awareness as to why they left.
---
Just because bots can adapt to the changes, doesn't mean the changes shouldn't be made. It might reduce bots to a degree and some progress is better than no progress.
---
Similar to the whole climate issue.
---
Ok, so... is there an easy way to find "vacant" moons with no anchored refineries? (without having to search one by one, if possible)
---
if you don't want free kills fed to you, then what are you whining about?
---
ratters aren't who you are looking for if you don't want free kills.
---
and don't get too salty just because i have fleets to join pretty much whenever i want them - perks of playing with other people in an MMO i guess.
---
No MSE? Wtf is this?
---
Yes, it might be the case that more nerfs are needed.
---
Any ship can be tackle if you’re brave enough.
---
But yea tackle is dumb in fleets fly a maulus. Tackle frigates are for fucking around in staging and roams.
---
now is a good time to start a VPN company, perhaps?
---
:pray: triangles
---
Yeah... you’re right. You’re totally right. I guess the game is just fucked. Or at least I don’t have any more ideas.
---
Unless you have enough players, it's wouldn't be easily dedectable.
---
It would mostly just be seeing too many people login from the same place, but it could also just be a bunch of alts.
---
I have a condor in which I got my first solo killmark ever. I still have it 2 years later and even took him to my wormhole. Of course its super useless here and I would now fly an inti 100% of the time but it makes me smile to see it in my hangar &lt;3
---
This seems rather clearly a technique for the connected users side, and not at the destination side.
---
So totally different.
---
This is badass! Keep it up :D
---
With my country currency and wallet from selling dota2 item bought with real money, plex is 25% cheaper if I bought it from steam....

But I dont plex for isk so it doesn't affect me...

Is this a suggestion post? Where is the reee?  I don't see a casually racist comment about the Far East? Where is the bot? idgi
---
Idk man, when the non-kiters bring damp/lach the kiters often get pretty upset about it and just pull even more range. Then not only does no one fight, but now everyone's tilted.
---
Not saying that bringing mjd/etc isn't ever viable (because sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't) but kitey bullshit vs kitey bullshit is pretty dull and generally doesn't go anywhere.
---
&gt;Maybe a few. I say get rid of them completly. No standings tags at all. No overview Corp tickers. No API producing Intel.  
---
\&gt;Show Info on pilot  
---
\&gt;Copy corp name  
---
\&gt;Alt-tab standings list maintained on 3rd party website  
---
\&gt;Check corp name   
---
So 15 seconds done by the scout. Cool story bro. Why did we remove standings again?
---
bro 😎💪
---
I don't get the idea of not wanting to fight your friends. My best non-corp friends in the game aren't blue and I hope that it stays that way. We have a lot of fun shooting each other.
---
You are all wrong. 
---
They dont have access to TQ/Shop in china so you dont convert it to RMB.
---
I Think they fixed all conversion last year.
---
Sounds like a bullet that CCP definitely needs to bite at some point. hopefully sooner than later
---
French connexion were always someone's pet.
---
Has anyone ever told you that you're a cunt automoderator ?
---
Thought I'd take a break from the regularly scheduled salt and shitposting to offer something productive (for a change).
---
Why would I travel a few regions away to bring you content when you don't want it?
---
No Plex inside? Needless.
---
We can agree to disagree on number of targets because your second point is much more important.
---
CCP need to iterate on this either with a middle ground blackout or a buff to reward in nullsec, not just treat blackout like a light switch. That decision to just hammer between two extremes is what is killing eve and not the blackout itself.
---
yep, you are not the first in this hole
---
There were primarily 2 things that made Serenity cancer and dead:
---
1. Botting
---
2. One Blue donut too big.
---
The first issue is on CCP, the second issue is on us players.
---
Nah. I’d rather unsub all 69 of my mining alts and play the remake of another decade old came because I have sand in my vagene.
---
&gt;3 points 6 hours ago
---
The absolute fucking state of the payer base in 2019, gl winning eve dude.
---
But the reactions were pretty funny and still are.
---
CSM exists because CCP has this terrible habit of not knowing the first thing about the various communities and mechanics of their own game. Like.. that’s not even a meme. That’s reality.
---
Actually didn't think to check that so i have no idea
---
The nullbears got what they wanted lol
---
If not all-out (give them a go they're cool dudes) then please try another WH corp. Spoopy are pretty terrible and numerous other corps could give you the full active WH experience.
---
Oh blackout was great for humans in subcaps roaming. Maybe you should've tried it out.
---
God you’re dumb as fuck.
---
Do you know aprox. the respawn time? I can long in every hour and check
---
If you live in WHs, c13’s aren’t that rare.
---
Right? Goodposting is so passe. The people demand angry walls of text!
---
I am a returning player after a long time and started playing with 3 friends who started.  At the moment our comp is a Raven, a wolf, a vexer and a talos. At the moment we are focusing on pve. Yesterday we were doing Triglavian conduits and it felt like my damage was trash. Is there that big of a dmg reduction if you hit destroyers/cruisers with battleship cruise missiles? Or are they just very tanky.
---
&gt;Banderlogs Alliance  
---
&gt;French Connexion
---
Are Init Pets, as soon as some timer comes up they call Init, Snuffed and Goons
---
That sounds way better 'near the airport"
---
Bullshit, it is as easy as that you dont have to solve the fucking davinci code to find a specific piece of code, even the shittiest codebases have semi decent folder structures and a simple search on names will suffice.
---
&gt; by modern standards 
---
  
---
Low bar.
---
this is a slow fucking game
---
Yep.
---
&gt; with mediocre 
---
....
---
graphics 
---
Nope. I'm out.
---
If you wanna remove ISK from the game just make CCP offer players a place they can send ISK to and Hilmar gets one hit with a whip per bill. Repeatable as often as you like/can effort. With video-proof. His butt ll never be the same again after just an hour, I bet.
---
Are abyss sites good money?
---
For some players, OPSEC *is* the game.
---
Have a copy of the book too. Mine, however, is more or less broken in half, stitched together, pizza grease smeared, tangerine juice stained, and missing half of its cover page.
---
Quoting myself:  
---
"Mutey letzten Sonntag um 21:36 Uhr
---
Just nuke it all... Make all citas going Low Power get hijacked by Trigs and used for spawning attacking, pod-killing, bad-ass Trig-fleets...or rogue drones......or both... "
---
Never not MSE
---
But there you had more than one force multiplier. The griffins could make the logi unusable and you had one ecm for each enemy ship.
---
Have to admit that it feels like that is the counter to logi and personally I'd rather see more e-war to counter logi rather than nerfing them.
---
Will check it out, thanks!
---
I've done none of those so I can't really comment on them but 1) are there enough of them to make it viable for a large group to do and 2) are they something that a fairly new player can do with low skillpoints?
---
usually you can fit any ship, using the same slot up to make a buffer fit or a active fit.
---
While you're not wrong, all you write is about how to get new people into the game. But we know that this isn't the issue. We know that enough people try eve but that too few stay.
---
The problem is you have to make things profitable. And the content/game small gang pvpers gameplaye is not that much profitable.
---
This is just straight awesome! 7o
---
Remember you are Australian if someone ask.
---
&gt;Let's be real, by modern standards
---
Of what? Fortnite?
---
nah cus you can just make another account in \~30 seconds
---
Theyve been doing that for years.  I agree I really think theyve given up.
---
Yep. Something like 500k people tried EVE last year.
---
Sure but we're playing a game so leave it at the door. I don't constantly make fun of Americans during fleets for voting Trump so why would I do the same for Chinese people who have far less say?
---
There is some truth in that. But there always was a vocal minority who did ask for CCP to remove local in null. It became sort of a meme at some point, but still. Mind you, it wasn't the null residents who asked for It, but their foe.  So they just stopped playing when it happened. That could have been anticipated tbh.
---
The players ask for capitals and supers being balanced for a looking time. More recently the voices who also asked for cyno changes got louder. Because jumping is apparently the problem. 
---
I don't necessarily disagree, but I would have liked a capital rework first and then touch cynos if necessary. But that is obviously more work to do.
---
My beloved astero is one of my oldest ship : 2.5 years old, 17 killmarks. billions isk earned. I use it everyday.  
---
Recently, I stoped to use it for ghost site because I feel attached to it. 
---
I also have an Ares, quickly fitted with cloak an probes during a WH eviction to go through the blockade. used several times since, allways under eviction. this ship is linked to high stress and memorable times for me
---
So we can agree that they shouldn't respond to reddit memes?
---
This should be a pin
---
[https://i.imgur.com/N5vkRtY.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/N5vkRtY.jpg) wow
---
i was specific for that exact reason, judgement day was on slightly more than 2 years so quite old news, hk eviction as i said is an unprecedented event but still it was a turkey shoot and x47l-q was a smaller loss than b-r so while it was a big fight when you have a battle from 2013 that is bigger, despite supercapital proliferation, you cant say oh wow look at eve online where titans died.
---
You laugh but I haven't lost a carrier after years of doing this so.....
---
But that's the thing.....people are losing carriers.
---
exploration is sexy. boy you know, man, how to turn it on.
---
We're not saying do eve classic like that...
---
Just keep current iteration of eve, but wipe all user data... Start everyone back in a noobship in the tutorial with no isk, no ship and no sov...
---
Sure, but skills.
---
Skills regarding your dps will have a greater impact against an active fit than a buffer.
---
Like say, you have 200 dps, they have 10000 ehp.
---
This will takes you 50 seconds.
---
Now if they have 5000ehp and 100/s active tank.
---
That will also take 50 seconds to kill.
---
But, now skills causing a 10% decrease in dps, so you do 180dps.
---
Against the buffer, it takes 55.5s. Against the active it takes 62.5s.
---
It's only 10% less dps, but against an active fit that's a 20% reduction in damage that bleeds through.
---
1. What was the last bold move that you saw from CCP about Eve?
---
2. What's the next one that you would like to see?
---
/r/titlegore
---
My vigilant I bought in late-2015 the moment I could use t2 medium blasters. I used it to defend north deklein with my friends, broke it out of hostile stations twice, and made my way down to delve with it. It'll probably be a hangar queen forever now because I'm too attached to it and the memories made flying it.
---
10 tethered people - 2 doing stuff in space, i will take the latter. Nullbears like you cried that "blackout is killing the game cause there are no people in space" whereas hunters killboards were telling a different story. Also its pretty hilarious that you call people out for being whinners when for 2 months you cried unbelievable tears about blackout.
---
Why is the Leviathan the least used titan ?
---
dont bother with him, just check his posting history while blackout was active.
---
The only issue here is, are you overrepping? loosing rep amount for the cycle (with ancillary this is lost tank)
---
did you heat every time? did the need to manage reps cause you to make mistakes? 
---
and your giving frigate stats, however no single rep frigate reps 100/s its more half that, maybe 70/s with ancillary armour reps.
---
dps on some of the higher dps fridates is more like 250 - 300. putting alot of pressure on the reps and often breaking through them, you may not ever offload the charges. and the game doesn't give active rep frigates 5k ehp
---
(it may seem like im nit picking here but im not, these things matter)
---
whats ever more powerful than dps? neuts. what can you fit with buffer tank, neuts.
---
pyfa shows total amount of EHP from a rep, with ancillary it shows EHP total over all charges. and what i noticed was the reps usually gave around and about the same as a plate did on a plate fit. once an ancillary is emtpy it doesnt tank anything.
---
The whole citadel era started to get rid of old POS and outpost code, when you look at the early announcements. 
---
If they build it around or on top of the same old code... I don't even know what to say if they did.
---
Null makes more than WH space and can produce end game ships, why should null be easier space to live and rat in compared to WH? Just by logic, it shouldn’t be.
---
Wtf? Is that a lost code piece?
---
there are 10 people doing things in space. but if you want less players, that's up to you.
---
i didn't cry about black out - i just did what most other people did, things that were more worthy of my time.
---
EVE is absolutely not boring to watch it's low pace compared to other action oriented games but you have to see it from the newbies perspective. 
---
They'll see the cool ships they'll see the super impressive warping around and stations and beautiful space graphics and they'll want to play out the fantasy despite the seemingly low pace. 
---
It takes experience to appreciate what people are doing in any game Path of Exile for example looks like a train full of random paint buckets went through a tornado this is normal. Every sufficiently complex system of interactions is completely unfathomable to a newbie.
---
If CCP invested in promoting streamers by giving them stream drops of random event skins for example they would win a ton of new players who want to live the fantasy and don't even realize the complexity might be a problem for them.
---
I put this through a translator,
---
"Hai, isk for sale. Really cheap, 70 yen per million isk. Please hurry, bad weather incoming. RIP Vilerat! Please buy isk now, need to feed pet turtle now. Selling cheap navy raven, trade me!"
---
[Banned for racism. Thread locked.]
---
Why would it require the single account thing? If a botter gets his real identity banned and can't get back In, that's good enough imo.
---
But yeah...
---
brilliant as it was, it made it look like an active tank is the only option. when it very much isnt. in the real 'game'? stats matter, balancing is a thing, and a rep repping double what they do in the game is a pretty big thing to use to show 'i get 12seconds more in active tank'
---
using correct numbers, youll find the buffer fit to live longer in almost all realistic cases. however, the ancillary does do a reasonable job at reps. its almost as good as buffer, but you do not loose any speed and it costs little to fit the ancillary rep. it uses a godly amount of capacitor, but frigate fights are short enough for this to usually not matter TOO much.
---
When doing level 2-3 or 4 combat anomalies and triglavian conduits, should I switch to Rapid Heavy missile launchers instead of cruise launchers?
---
You play wow?
---
Maybe that was the reason for 200 titan blobs very few coalitions had. But today's capital proliferation was caused by the ability of players to mine and build safely. Partially because how easy became to get rorqual alts.
---
Should my salary depend on plexes sales, I'd be happier to see players with 10 accounts instead of 3. Not to mention 100 skill farms.
---
I'd say afkstars, then alphavnis and now myrmidons or whatever, have very little impact in comparison.
---
You don't really want to prevent players to play together in a sandboxish-mmo, but you can expect them to build lots of big things based on they access to ingame resources.
---
That's not what would stop botting long-term either I think.
---
In the end you still shot red icons in a pre determined priority.
---
Not that I know of...
---
Warp to upwell moon beacon and see what's what. 
---
Grab a cepter.
---
Waiting for tapi to come defend why they support AOM and the botting empires.
---
bots return, nothing more. we lost nothing during blackout, and we gain nothing when its gone.
---
I miss Blackout like ALOT. it was the first time nullsec felt fun and actually slightly dangerous. the day blackout returned i warped into a bubble. usually wouldve scared me and i maybe panic....but no, local clear. i just kill bubble and leave.    worst desicion to return local to nullsec
---
Remember the days when newbro suicide tackle had to have at least 5 fitted ships and there was no such thing as reimbursement?  Pepperidge Farms remember.
---
 [Corrected](https://media.tenor.com/images/b9d588d69f74cd5df20043965d1eca44/tenor.gif)
---
I heard FRT one of the biggest Chinese power house is working with panfam. All in All it's just more raw power for each side
---
they didnt tether up with blackout, simply cause they had no free and unparalleled intel.  
---
you have never in your life small ganged right? Cause you should know everyone holds fire so a response fleet comes in a populated system.
---
I guess some people have a lot of money to burn. Yeah I would def wait if it’s 200m and up. But my cap is 48 hours. The show must go on as they say.
---
Self delusion is a stinky cologne
---
In South América too is way cheaper the omega time in steam than CCP prices.
---
Wow, I was being snarky but you're actually doing this, eh?
---
In EVE community discords, why do so many people have pictures of cartoon ponies? Am I missing something here?
---
It really destroyed one of the few central pillars of the game. Making skill point liquid was so so greedy from CCP, and the game and its players have been paying the cost since then.
---
&gt; entitled manchildren
---
Reading all your posts, I agree this is a valid description of you. Whining and crying, and when someone points that out you call him manchild ... no knowledge, no clue - lets do a NO U ... XD
---
I KNEW something was missing - a Salvager!
---
It was a published goal of miniluv to make Hisec miserable and drive people to KF. Now back in line F1 Bee
---
Damn, didn't know they are doing isk doubling services!
---
This reminds me of Microsoft
---
lmao 'i was once relevant'. fucking state of panfam 2019
---
Tbf you have to explain to him what is roaming, he only knows of orbiting Anoms and being ganked by Cloakies cuz he is bad.
---
Hey if you wanna lose multiple trillions in structures every year when goons make a trip to your space be my guest dude.
---
He's using weekly peaks though.
---
Average is 1.6 according to CCP (a couple of years ago).
---
Thank god we have dumbos making unbased assumptions in this thread. Consider I am a persistant bot hunter that has personally eyewitnessed hundreds of Bots accross all of EVE. 
---
Now please explain to me how a human being manages straight horizontal graphs over 16-18 hrs for multiple days in a row. Everyone with half a brain can see this is bot behaviour. If you deny that you either hve no clue or you have something to cover up, simple as that.
---
You can now continue the presentation with its destruction by init and friends with require opsec as well
---
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK REDDIT :colbert:  
---
THATS PRETTYMUCH OUTLAWING SHITPOSTING, SCREW YOU -.-\*\*
---
half?
---
Can we build a RorqWall too ?
---
Hardly ever noticed any bronies so it might be just *your* Eve Online discords :^) food for thought
---
That said given your username we might share quite a lot of servers lol
---
imagine being a chink and believing your the good guy
---
&gt; hunting ratters
---
You will have to add "from a C2". Try to hunt ratters 10 systems behind a NEAR2 Bot by roaming ...
---
That is what i meant on both accounts.
---
The part that annoys me about this racist comment is we've had the exact same spam in English for years.  All of a sudden its a bigger issue because its not the alphabet.
---
Botting, scammers, hackers is an international problem and you and everyone else slamming the Chinese all the time just show how ignorant you really are.
---
Noobs don't even remember when the Ferox had 5 missile hard points and drones had loot. Hell, I bet this kid thinks mining barge lasers were always blue and gates always made that woosh noise. There have been thousands of fixes and updates that CCP were showered with praise for and worse problems than now where CCP were shit on just as much. Your problems today, noob, are no worse than any this game has faced. Go back to WoW.
---
Technically you can, but that will get you permabanned. Preventing CONCORD from killing you is a known &amp; declared exploit. 
---
Source: https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/204873262-Known-Declared-Exploit
---
&gt;Committing a criminal act and delaying CONCORD response for an extended period of time.
---
&gt;Commonly involves leaving empty ships or drones in space that CONCORD focuses on before dealing with the attacker. This exploit is not limited to drones or ships and applies to any item or method which might be used to delay CONCORD.
---
&gt;It is also considered an exploit to commit a criminal act and prevent ship loss to CONCORD by any means.
---
But yen is japanese.....
---
Yeah, it's pretty odd alright. Maybe it's their way of hiding from the communist tax man.
---
i think many would not mind paying for their gameplay like i do today. I never rat nor mine and i always fly what i can afford to lose and still have lots of fun:)
---
maybe if the game didn't reward grouping up in to the biggest blob, people wouldn't do it.
---
I would welcome the content. 
---
Be warned however, you will get bootyblasted. Fortress Delve is for Goons
---
Now back to lurking
---
The mobile depot and can spam is also pretty cancerous tbh
---
I guess no one in reddit like NCPL
---
Assuming your are serious in your post, and banning people from any  particular part of the world is off the table, what would you do to prevent more blue doughnut?
---
&gt; (payments in the form of faction forts)
---
Is this just a reference to GotG suing for peace, or some other feverdream?
---
If the botters are back, curious who all they sell to ? They wouldn't be here or in great numbers if there wasn't a market. Is it just the ones coming over from Serenity they are selling to, or are alliances or whale players buying this ? If in the next 1-2 years the PCU continues to go down, wouldn't they be better served going to a more popular game to bot, or is the bot detection SO BAD in Eve that its worth the effort, even with less sales than say, another popular MMO.
---
depends a bit on timezone of course but a max form eutz legacy vs a max form eutz WC+panfam is p even numbers. so it's only natural tapi calls goons to secure the W and avoid a fight.
---
Shoutouts for F-OFF! 
---
We have the best ticker in game, log standing history, with original founders still in corp, in a growing alliance in Cache.
---
Primarily PvP minded, we do have our own industrial team and a dedicated jump freight team to help moving in!
---
The r 3 t a r d a t i o n continues.
---
Depends on the activity, really. Shipping, mining, ratting, exploring, tidi battles, and more, you can spend most of your time zoomed in admiring your ship or the enemy ship or whatever.
---
Not everyone is a fleet scout/dictor, or flying solo or in a small gang, or micromanaging and manually piloting in an abyssal, etc. There's plenty of things you can do effectively in eve while zoomed in.
---
I know but I was mostly addressing querns's belief that companies/governments don't have access to this kind of technology already for filtering their outgoing traffic.
---
read up on the lore, as capsuleers are immortal,  
---
they have been neutered and have no genitalia to keep them from breeding   
---
its also unknown what happens if a capsuleer has a child (pregnant woman f.e.), thus the capabilities have been removed
---
exactly CCP needs to do something game design related to alleviate this problem, but the weaponized boredom and helldunks or blueballs gameplay that TAPI coined is also part of the problem on the side of alliance leadership.
---
It does.  It's fucking beautiful
---
In other games you are required to dailys to get limited time items or other required items. This is why its aids in other games.
---
Its not my job to be Eve Online's lead game designer, hopefully someone that gets paid big bucks can actually do their job and fix the problem. However any idiot can obviously see that the current meta is a problem
---
It is vague on purpose. I think this started with Youtube and the Vox Adpocalypse. They were pressured to ban Steven Crowder but really couldn't because no rules were actually broken but Youtube demonitized him anyway. Now they allong with other progressive tech companies are now using  perceived offense with regards to speech to ban pretty much everyone they don't deem politically acceptable. 
---
I'm sorry that the crazy in the US political system has bled over so much into everything else. Platforms such as Reddit will soon if not already become a one way claptrap and normal people will have to find alternatives.
---
rep grinds...
---
*shudders*
---
considering i said " Goons have Darkness as defacto renters " immediately before the statement you're referencing, yes it is a reference to GotG
---
other than instancing and forcing 'fair fights' then i fail to see what can really be done.
---
so heres the thing about all these epic events... they are super awesome and nostalgic to talk about after the fact, but during its boring as shit. B-R? Massive tidifest and subcaps didnt matter. WWB? two battles and a lot of boring structure grinding. The most entertaining thing from WWB was Sion losing his marbles. Northern Eviction? TEST and CO2 picked up their toys and left, leavinb a huge structure grind. Southern Incursion? A few fights against stainwagon, Goons saw they were hopeless and left, and the rest was...you guessed ot, structure and sov grind... and on and on and on.
---
CCP needs to stop focusing on advertising these Le Epic Events and focus on the basic broken as fuck mechanics of the game such as structure spam and PvE to retain new players in current year.
---
To bad you can't make limitless anonymous accounts.
---
You can always join a non big bloc corp/alliance. Players blue themselves, not CCP.
---
Its interesting how the timing lines up, The mangos are buying their way into null sec, people are worried that they will ruin tranquility like how they ruined their server and CCP just throws at us some skill points so we can forget about it.
---
So was Twitter and YouTube at one time. Trump winning in 2016 has upset a lot of people. They're not handling it well and many are in big tech.
---
Well I am also not playing this game to see silly russian, or other propaganda, thats why we have to block option to not hear them anymore.
---
Lliterally just a REEE thread. Funny how you never REEE'd about BoT ain't it.
---
Time to bring back people that stop playing i guess
---
ofc you can and I am part of a small group with few blues, but also a stagnant nullsec is not good for anyone in the game, it has such massive economic and geopolitical ramifications
---
Any idea how long it's going?
---
Nice smoke grenade to cover all that plexed multiboxes in Delve.
---
It was Lifeblood and TQ Krabs that made PLEX price explode, and blackout that lifted the pressure on PLEX price for a short time.
---
This. I dont really see these SP events as bad thing since its not required thing to do.
---
Sure, but that only identifies if anyone in their end is using a VPN, not in the other end.
---
Not a bad idea.
---
When someone abuses it then they get a 7 day ban.
---
&gt; how the fuck is BOT relevant? they're just trash renters
---
There we go, remember good people of r/eve, the chinese created botting on the the 5th day and saw that it was very good.
---
[Oh look what is this, it's the just trash renters chart.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6IdqdwXsAEgZu4?format=jpg&amp;name=large)
---
and daily quests are cancer, but i do love me some free SP.
---
Smarter than the Mouth Trumpet Calvary that is for sure. Then again, not hard to be smarter than them in the first place.
---
even not visible tits are every-time worth :-D
---
&gt; more scarcity of resources
---
that doesn't break up big groups - it causes them.
---
a smaller slice of something is better than an empty plate. how do you guarantee your plate isn't empty? join the table with the only plate that has something on it.
---
It's also bad daily quests.
---
I mean come on CCP, there is an activity tracker. Maybe use that to track activity and give a reward based on that.
---
Not really. Who cares if they see when you go into a system if they never account for you leaving and just go ratting 15 mins later after you have setup bubbles. But then again I guess I am just wiser than you.
---
You're not wrong, but you're also still pretty hilariously arrogant.
---
&gt;they're basically paying them tribute / protection money
---
Any actual evidence of that, or again, are you counting that one transfer of forts as "tribute"?  Because that's just the cost of losing a war.
---
What's nutty that they kept the stupidest thing about it, the randomness. Some folks I know weren't too happy about only ever getting 10k ones throughout the event.  
---
As for myself, at least I know not to bother with sub-5mil alpha characters this time around.
---
I don’t think it’s a problem with the meta, it’s a people problem.
---
People want to fly cool ships, so they group up, and protect each other doing the things they can do to pay for said cool ships, oh no, it went to far and now everyone is kinda friends.
---
If this was IRL this would be the equivalent of world peace and everyone would think that was a good thing.
---
You're assuming that this is a real leak and not a edited discord screenshot.
---
Reddit is dying. Time to jump ship.
---
Bad website.
---
Oh yeah, there was no bot use nor RMT activity before they come.
---
TBH. If they become a power house could be fun a new full new eden war. TQ empire vs Serenety and allies. That is a lot of pewpew.
---
I'm not assuming anything, nullsec "players" want it, leadershit will provide it. Sooner or later.
---
Did at any point I claim that these two individuals were not bots?
---
I've always wanted to live in Vale again.
---
Bad admins.
---
But did they really, if half of them quit before first log in.
---
Popular demand? Damn, people are weird.
---
Botting became rampant in null shortly after CCP ended the soap opera era. Long before skill injectors.
---
&gt; Any actual evidence of that, or again, are you counting that one-time transfer of forts as "tribute"? Because that's just the cost of losing a war. 
---
Thats literally the evidence, what is to stop Goons from coming back once the peace treaty expired and demanding more tribute?
---
&gt; That campaign was months-long slog, and had some pretty goddamn even titan brawls, so, yeah, it was a war regardless of your weird opinions. 
---
The point is is that war is meant to be a struggle for both sides, yes Georgia maybe wasn't a great example because there actually was a struggle against a stout insurgency... fucking GotG vs GSF was literally the opposite, there was no appetite for a struggle they just wanted GSF to go away so they could get back to krabbing
---
Botters raged, ie nulls major players. All of them have a botting backbone.
---
When you reach the breaking point, come to wormholes and FC, sov FCing is a fucking snore 90% of the time
---
I thought that was the problem, the large groups not fighting and trying to take each other’s space all the time?
---
If that’s not the problem with the blue doughnut what is?
---
if you think this is just an advertisement or scams, you are too naive.
---
I have my 2nd destroyer when i started to play EVE ... 1st one died in a very stupid way.            
---
I also have my first T3 and first carrier.            
---
To be clear i have like currently 4 carriers laying around togheter because one of them is my 1st one ... but with the cap modules introduction i unfitted all of them and gave them name 'unfit' before i realized what have i done.           
---
Now they are just will be sitting on a station till the servers go off.
---
They can account for you leaving by scraping the list of pilots in local. And all said, unless you get off on reverse engineering a bot’s logic, it’s usually too much of a time investment for too little kill reward from the hunters perspective.
---
Blackout was not a mistake. Blackout killed null bottong dead. CCP just gawped at the extent of the problem and is allowing botting again by lifting it.
---
Eve in that respect is dead. If you wanna play the null game you need to bot and ccp is happy with that fact.
---
We do..  bling me ingame.   The tebo.  Ls hs ops.. huge indy with pvp pve on the sides

I would just like to point out that the reason GoTG wasn't steam rolled after the payment of faction forts to Goons was due to there being a 6 month agreement to not push their shit in any more. Contrary to popular belief, we actually hold to our word when we make it. HOWEVER that 6 month time has passed so they are free and open to be invaded again.
---
However I'm SURE you knew this, being on that high horse and all....
---
ITT: members of cancerous blue blob  circle jerking
---
This game is dead lol
---
I disagree. I feel significantly more impacted when I get triple headshot by a cheater in rust.
---
 Kill my ratting ship?  I've log in an alt in your alliance in deeps of Delve and ratting in it until I'll get enough to compense my loss.
---
&gt;I don’t think it’s a problem with the meta, it’s a people problem.
---
You really can't imagine a game mechanic that would be a conflict driver in EVE?
---
&gt;Nullsec will soon be FRT + Panfam consolidated in the backwaters of Eve aka Dronelands whilst Legacy owns 13+ regions
---
dont mind if i do (:
---
Well we don't know what they are because we don't speak fucking Chinese.
---
Do you?
---
I think thats exactly the point he's trying to make. Eve has abundant resources and all of the space is equally good, resources are vast and nobody has ever reason to fight someone else.
---
indeed, this was pretty much the only way a bunch of my alts could get them done since you can't get very far with frig I, small weapons I, and fuck all support skills.
---
Not really empire building when you are a sub 2k alliance who doesn't even live anywhere near the people you supposedly protect.
---
no, you just get the biggest group on the best resource, the 2nd  biggest on the 2nd best etc.
---
and if you're introducing enough so there are multiple different groups popping up.... well resources ain't scarce any more, are they?
---
I always thought popular demand was for CCP to actually fix all the MANY reported and known issues of the game?
---
Guess most people are wrong and CCP is right......no..it can't be the people being right!
---
We already have them, faction standings to attain better missions and such
---
Wait does this.mean urg*pwnd will go away?
---
I mean you have to be able to reship quickly right? So yeah.
---
how is there a best resource when you need all of them to create things :thonking:
---
CCP-like?
---
Well if you are not flairbaiting, if you look for responsibilities inside the player base for the actual state of the game, look no further than at your own alliance/coalition lead. They did not make the patches that (foretold by many people incl. me as soon as the patchnotes aired) killed the games economic balance of sinks and faucets and implemented the staticness and lack of incentives surrounding the citadel meta, but they cheered Seagull for the "Farms&amp;Fields" approach with their close to 80% in CSM that time.
---
Apalling?
---
Fits pretty well with that kind of shit tbh. Feels like an event from a 2002 game.
---
Wait, no mention of date range that this will last? Possible new semi-permanent feature like chaos era?
---
so-  how does that solve the problem?
---
That sounds terrible for american time zone hah
---
It's pretty trivial to route it through something not-obviously-a-vpn though, but I doubt CCP will even bother looking for them.
---
No it is mostly not a good way. As John already said, fitting depends on what you wanna do with it. I know  a lot of people who went to go "hunt for fun" in whs, after a few days of scanning through wh chains most quickly gave up on that idea. Your engagement profile, the various ships you might be able to kill with a bomber, is usually very limited and dependent on what fit you picked. A few organized bombers tho can take on a whole lot more. There is also NPSI communities/fleets you can freely join without joining a corp or signing up on anythig, for bombers i'd recommend bombers bar, for non cloaky stuff there is a ton out there most known is spectre fleet.
---
No not really. You can jump from highsec directly into every bloc space if you want and then it's tetherland all the way to staging/market hub to sell things.
---
How about you share the nugget of gold that's obviously rattling around inside your head?
---
You seem to not know a lot. Did you hear about the riots in China in front of a High School that tried to enforce non-cheating during exams? Parents rioted in front of the school, as they said the schools denial of cheating spoils the future career chances of their kids. Cheating in China is just a competitive tool to get ahead by culture. That is a fact.
---
Man if CCP does that shit then they really deserve all the bullshit
---
Till they get all the players back that quit from blackout
---
well me getting an infinite amount of 3day bans everytime 3 people report me means a permaban
---
Like 60% of the value is in npc buy orders. They still make money just fine
---
Because people won't do it.
---
So should finish in July 2026?
---
You're not getting my spodbrain
---
i dont know what that is sorry
---
You can actually fight nano with nano and it can be a really fun skirmish. Really wish you saw that kind of response more often
---
twice as many that didnt do a last stand.   
---
Yes, 10 people doing X is x/10 hard, 800 people doing X is X/800 hard and the amount of planning was stupid and unnecessary as was said 2000 times, get hole control get ships in, dont die (mjd ravens and stukas anyway), the end.   
---
Even if it were 2 weeks from now, its still quite old, do you realize that eve is an abnormality in the timeline of games life. From 2017 to 2019 another game might have 3 different games.
---
ok sure, so lets say drakes are in meta and they are heavily weighted on tritanium to create, whoever controls the main source of trit is going to have an advantage. 
---
Now you think they'll hand out trit to other people to make drakes? Unlikely. They'll charge a premium and eventually people won't want to pay and will find other more violent ways to obtain it.
---
I could actually get behind the idea of making titans immune to FAX reps for 5 minutes after firing a DD.
---
The logic of a bot these days are human readable thanks to all the time people invested into frameworks such as Sanderling. But then again guess you wasted your time typing this instead of using good ole fashion google.
---
I actually had to look at Dotlan to remind myself where the hell Insmother is: the fuck end of nowhere is where it is.
---
I pity the GSL crew if this is true.
---
Not necessarily.
---
&gt; all you write is about how to get new people into the game
---
Probably because that's the topic of the post. Not sure how you read the title and thought "oh, hey, this guy's gonna say some enlightening shit about the new player experience!"
---
That or this could not really impact us that much. In the wonderful world of reddits rule, anything can happen!
---
Wow who would have thought the moderators are silently shadowbanning people who disagree with their opinions
---
Nah that would never happen
---
Fucking gorski set this to auto reply and it's a terrible idea.
---
I am pretty sure killing miners is the content we are after when on a public roam
---
Yea I could do without this tbh
---
&gt; imagine being a chink and believing your the good guy, can i have your stuff you salty little cuck?
---
To be fair, this is the comment it removed.
---
Imagine if we could just undock and go shoot this scum instead of bitching about it here on Reddit.
---
Oh wait.
---
Instant week targets
---
&gt; Meanwhile everybody not hooked on koolaid knows
---
Everyone else is the same regardless of where they are in new eden or what narratives are being used for what war, everybody not hooked on koolaid knows.
---
Wars should just be renamed the 'NO U BOT #37' war.
---
God you are always just this whiny bitch playing g the same record while you sniffle and cry.  Your histrionics amuse me.  Go find mon and see if she will wipe the snot off of your shirt and hug you until you settle down.
---
Whilst its nice that it encourages people to undock, even here in lowsec just ratting in belts. The original booster events would be much nicer to have back.
---
I have a barghest. Bought it out of jita local for 300 mill despite everyone screaming scam. It was unfitted but came with a fedo. Only thing was there was a couple of low sec systems between it and highsec. I just waited a week, got good and plastered on tequila, flew it to jita, dropped a bill in a fit and roamed around null sec until passing out somewhere in space. Never saw anyone, was never scanned down, and I still have it in cold storage. The barghest was one of the ships that got me into Eve as it looked really cool. I love that frying pan. As a bonus, with the convergence skin on it, it has a picture of how to perform safe sex when looking at it from the top. It's important to teach Eve players how to do this as most may need a pop up book to understand how to have sex, safely to boot.
---
5. No one was in space wasnt under w super umbrella, and no one ever wanted to fight.
---
6. The whining about Blackout was so fucking bad it made me realize that "try hard" Eve has been dead for years.
---
The game needs logistics. Not the CCP definition, but the actual real life thingy a doodle.
---
It's what makes the game break. To much huge shit and nothing needed to keep it going.
---
Having some sort of supply system for a large ship or structure would alleviate the super/cit spam.
---
Have a 20,000 person crew? Feed them. Thing needs fuel for normal power? Gas it up. Etc.
---
There's a reason why blue water navies in real life are rare. It's very difficult to supply and support far off ships. In eve you just build it and nothing is ever needed again.
---
God forbid we make PI semi interesting.
---
There is a very fine line between "not forcing" and "not allowing" players to partake in certain content. 
---
&gt; Except WoW gets an expansion with new PvE content every few years and  class rebalances while EvE gets a minor tweak to several ships along  with some small newish feature from time to time with PvE staying the  same for years and years. 
---
This is just not true though. Eve expansions have always been free, building one the same core game. Some expansions have been significant, some less so.
---
how would you imagine them discouraging blobs in a game about building empires?
---
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker ccp
---
Scarcity of resources. Let's start with the MASSIVE amount of resources and ISK generated by so few people in WH space.
---
I figured CCP could ban those along with the bots, but I guess they could be created with distinct IP addresses, virtual machines, emails and credit card info to avoid that.
---
if you think the blackout discouraged grouping up rather than sitting so far up each other's ass the next human centipede is just a hair's breadth away.... then i got a bridge to sell you.
---
I don't think you fully understand what I'm saying but it's nice that you tried.
---
One trick pony
---
For reference, the picture is not real
---
Not that I disagree with your sentiment, but do you realize with one breath you complain about empires being too compact and in the next you complain about them being too sprawling?
---
Not sure why downvoted but faction standings are directly equivalent to rep in other games.
---
&gt; Aren't they blue to you?
---
You do realize we've been fighting WinterCo for months... also a Serenity entity.
---
I support a logistics system, such as space fuel, fuel trucks and having ships and stations consume commodities.
---
This is like a tier 3 meme, nice.
---
Don't worry, the characters Dan001 - Dan025 are all organic players and are no way harmful to the game.
---
Yeah, but they let go all of their core development and are in "keep the lights on" mode. No one left to design, test, or implement the systems you are talking about. Regardless of the fact that they are interesting ideas with valid integration paths.
---
Wanted a stronger CNTZ/AUTZ I'm assuming so they can contest in all TZ.
---
Bug Dumpster Energy.
---
The guy who got tackled was extremely Russian, but good at baiting. He didn’t know the word for inhib, but was ok enough to get in the super fleet.
---
Great job from the Harpy Fleet fc on tackling the lokis.
---
Those guys probably should have rolled for somewhere they could get a fight on their terms like a WH in need of eviction or a region where people aren’t actively hunting the hunters. Multiple FC’s were looking to catch them.
---
Fuck off
---
if the trick works, you don't need more than one of them.
---
Its not against the law to make rules against it in china.
---
Either way it doesn't matter now because CCP "fixed" moon resource scarcity with alchemy.
---
Baited on a free photoshop
---
Lol the irony
---
Thank you! I remember reading about that- really clever solution to that problem.
---
I definitely think the graphics could use an update--specifically the background and nebula--compare to elite dangerous for stunning visual effects.
---
The biggest hurdle though is the learning curve. I don't think the game should be simplified. The complexity is what gives rise to all the emergent meta game events, and is what makes the game so appealing. However, it's a deal breaking hurdle to casual gamers--the market that CCP needs to tap from both a stability and profitability stand point.
---
So how can you make losing less horrible? Maybe even incentivize it, or make it fun?
---
Maybe gain a skill point for every 50k ISK you lose, up to 100 points or something.
---
Or somehow make it less of a time commitment if you lose.
---
I don't always have much time to game anymore, and when I do, most the time I just want a chill experience. I'm not hardcore anymore, and will likely never generate any of the amazing meta. I like to mine and trade, and I recognize the risk of being ganked, but it can take a whole play session just to refit the ship and get back to where I was. At that point, I'm just as likely to say fuck it for a few days...or months. I can get all the drama on here anyway.
---
Which brings me to your main point. Completely agree that the best asset is the player generated stories.  Additional in-game media, like a newsletter, radio station, news clips on the station tvs, more/better ads for shit in the NES. It'd be really neat to have a major news agency for each of the races that covers the major universal and corporate events with their own spin. That's all stuff sponsored podcasters can do, send each of them a green screen backdrop and a leather jacket and some funky Spider Jerusalem glasses. Between streaming, they can record clips to use in-game
---
If they could get the mobile game integrated with TQ that'd really help the population a lot. Even if they can't join fleets, and it's a dumbed down point and clicker, the point is to drive engagement and logged-in time and to make the universe FEEL more alive/crowded. But that all seems like a logistic/balancing nightmare.
---
Id rather deploy to curse to farm the small folks that Vily + PGL install in scalding ASS and wicked creek.
---
Oh good, down voted for standing up for the developing world. I &lt;3 you r/eve.
---
Thx
---
It's not, he just thinks he is being edgy and hip to use words he doesn't understand like a parrot.
---
not really, I'm complaining about how its too easy to effectively defend a sprawling empire. If empires need more space, but werent able to protect it so easily with magical no fatigue jump bridges, that would be best
---
A little too late as I understand it ;D
---
Elite shitposting.
---
i am guessing this isnt for the vets but for the newbros
---
Anything to feed your confirmation bias amirite?
---
I once had a taranis with like 40 someodd kills (pre-killmarks) from mostly solo/smallgang stuff.
---
She were my special girl.
---
Then she sploded vs a couple of maledictions.
---
RIP *(Asteroid) Veldspar*, you will be missed.
---
It made it easier for small groups to pass under the radar of large groups.
---
buying PLEX isn't cheaper in Russia, or at least, not "way cheaper". Depending on the exchange rate, it's maybe 1-2 bucks cheaper which you might lose on conversion if you try to dodge it with VPN. 
---
Buying subsciption is massively cheaper, around 8$\\mo or less with yearly, but that shit ain't transferrable so it doesnt affect you. Unless you wanna risk the account or lose out on ping.
---
no I mean i legit dont care if there is a real donut or not, anymore.
---
Alchemy is inefficient though, so it isn’t a terrible workaround for resource scarcity.  No one uses it though because moon minerals aren’t hard to acquire.
---
but did absolutely nothing to discourage large groups, and absolutely encouraged their continuation.
---
Do these people know the game keeps running when they goto work/school/sleep ? , their clearly missing out on loot, kills and isk maybe they should just stay logged in 24/7 ???
---
There are a wide selection of ships, might I recommend any of the 2013 models.
---
Inner Hell managed to snag two a few days ago so the umbrella doesn't always save people. The first one [here](https://zkillboard.com/kill/79127565/) was "allowed" to be killed but there was no cyno on grid until he was already in low armor/structure. M40 also warped a bunch of ratting supers in from their sites to try and save it but ended up getting stuck too. Goon supers rarely get safe when a single neut enters local. Same with rorqs but maybe that is different if you are a known hunter of bigger targets.
---
&gt; What you are asking for is a 100% rewrite of the industrial side of the game.
---
&gt; OR, you could bring back T2 scarcity by redistributing moons and having regional locked moon goo (more so than now), something that was previously in the game, and an actual content driver.
---
This was done in a very poor way though, since they gave one region with an established alliance control over all sources of the resource. This also has a giant flaw because the resource is used for T2 modules, there is no alternative to T2 modules and no ability for counteraction.
---
What’s the point of building your fictional space empire if you can’t stand on the walls and defend it?
---
How much extra time a day do you waste ensuring you come across like an asshole in your replies?
---
hence my comment
---
You can try. But the eve account must be original from steam. For sure there is a way.
---
I remember paid almost a half than my friends in Europe for some games. (Triple A, +/-30 USD vs almost 60) its not just eve prices.
---
I can say that my group never botted, but thats easy to say in a group that never exceeded 25-30 people that you all know irl too.
---
Supports my point that the possibility to create completely anonymous 40k-pileups of incognito randoms is not good game design.
---
Its been on max level for years so not much change can happen.
---
In other words, there's no way to metagame IRL and make god almighty update earth.
---
yeah maybe it should account for a disproportionate amount of ISK generated compared to population. You know that nullsec accounts for a disproportionate amount of ISK generated compared to its population too? Because most of the population lives in highsec.  
---
Are you suggesting that there should be a proportionate amount of ISK generated through-out the entire game? Highsec should be the same ISK generated as nullsec, etc? Seems pretty fucking stupid to me
---
a boomer under the age of 20.
---
Them mining roids and killing a few rats doesn't require any setup, of course you won't be making pure efficiency when you load up a few transports with goods and the head back to high sec, but hey you will get a large injection of cash when you get to jita.
---
ree i cant exploit something ree
---
Can't wait for the day when that trick doesn't work anymore (ideally this is discovered while trying to do the trick)
---
Almost Flair baited me, almost
---
&gt; Big blue cancer blobs might have been allowed over there but on TQ it isn't allowed. 
---
Wtf?  Was there an EULA update I missed?
---
I reckon a Stratios can still qualify.
---
Buy navy slicer, dunk everything in 3 volleys, repeat.
---
INHE eats a bag of dicks once again
---
Probably
---
As you are now "Ex-CSM" can you explain CCPs reasoning for not doing another "This is EvE" type advert? I assume you guys must have asked them.
---
It seemed like they wanted/expected the players to make their own and do the advertising for them.
---
10K is like 3-4 hours of SP I believe, with perfect attributes for the skill being trained.
---
How is that any different from your T1 plan? Hint: it isn't, but T2 scarcity makes more sense.
---
Tempted to come!
---
By popular demand ^(within the CCP marketing team)
---
I may make this its own thread since CCP apparently doesn't learn anything about their game except from here
---
but HOLY SHIT, please why not just make this PVP kills
---
\*but people will kill their cyno alts\*
---
YES. Yes. they will. and that would still arguably be harder and more creative than this fucking braindead shit
---
Space trucks aren't the problem.
---
Parallel to real life. Blue water navies have the equivalent to JFs. Whether it's C5s dropping shit off at an airbase near a port, an oiler or an ammo ship.
---
Big vehicle that moves things is a real thing.
---
Whats breaking it all? Post scarcity. None of this garbage needs upkeep.
---
There's a HUGE reason why even big regional super powers don't have big carrier forces. They are a nightmare to support.
---
I'm not saying that owning a titan should be a chore and a nightmare. But it needs to represent some sort of burden to keep the bitch online. Same with cits. Can't afford the upkeep? Degrades over time until it's a hulk of scrap. There's the cit spam problem solved.
---
I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to you.
---
Loot, kills, and isk are there to get when they get on. Daily SP are just gone if they miss them
---
I see they said super happy, not supper happy
---
likewise
---
Wow, you suck at math.
---
I just dont understand how CCP can drop the ball so often when it comes to marketing. 
---
There are so many stories that you can tell in an advert form. Andrew Groen did exactly that when he released Empires of Eve https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WkYqWn3HSQ
---
I love Rooks and Kings but those videos arent going to bring may Non eve players into the game.
---
No, I got them from Exooki.
---
There's nothing in the linked announcement requiring sub words to autoremove nono words.
---
And when they do the ubernerds will find a way to exploit it within hours and cry that it wasn't enough or it was the wrong decision, but then continue to exploit it because "everyone else is doing it".
---
Nah, it really is quite random. My main at 77mil SP (at the time) got 25k for six days in a row, for example. None of the low-SP ones got THAT lucky. Overall I saw little to no relation with account status and current SP compared to what "challenge rewards" I was getting. And I was doing this on a good 10 characters.
---
Well, you should actually ask Exooki for his analysis rather than asking INN.
---
Or just edit the HTML...
---
It's terrific for lower skilled pilots who might not have a specifi off-remap pre-req trained.
---
I got impatient on one of my alts and swapped off of int/mem before cloaking 4 finished right before the recon announcement. I hard-trained Cloaking off remap, but if skilling spree was running I would have continued training Per/will skills and filled in Cloaking 4 with free SP. This could also apply to pilots who didn't train long range targeting V and want into Logistics, or didn't train gravitron physics and want into hictors.
---
Also remove remaps.
---
The pvp is not something your corp or alliance will ask you to do sometime  to have the right to krab. Fights are our aim and the reason why we live here, not some constraint what we have to deal with.  
---
You haven't the right state of mind to be a wormholer
---
Whatchu saying is go bot.
---
It's all over man... it's all over
---
Stabbers are so easily kited though. Even with arty. Their damage can be nuked by someone orbiting at 25k.  
---
Also is there such thing as a good stabber fleet issue fit for solo?
---
&gt; you don't - because it's a game about building empires.
---
so you concede your previous comment to be complete nonsense, right?
---
Hahahahaha they’re trying to get me and my friends to log back in. Bring blackout back or delay local. We don’t care about skill points.
---
Hold on TAPI invented that? 
---
Where my goons at you going to let TAPI get credit for your trademarked strategy?
---
Ngl, I lol'd.
---
Gl hitting JFs going from friendly citadel to citadel
---
stabber fleets are pretty strong solo. Armour tanked dual prop is how I flew mine.
---
Also not sure how stabbers are easily kited, they are faster than a lot of frigates lol
---
Erm, I didn't ask INN. I read his analysis in the CAM minutes. You are welcome to do the same.
---
The randomness isn't a good thing whether a newbro or a bittervet, though.
---
Taser Face ?  :-D
---
that's something else CCP can do something this wtf.
---
It's obvious the tutorial needs fixing...
---
I can only play an EVE that allows me to log in and get a fights every 15 minutes. Where I can roam 1 or 2 pipes and easily find conflict. That was FW/Amamake from 2009-2012. EVE will never have that again, so I'll never play again.
---
That's correct, but you do realize that making high sec miserable is *not* the same thing as wanting everyone to move to null sec, right? It is actually about emphasizing the importance and power of null sec to the very people who attack our existence on a regular basis.
---
Oh man the gankbear cloaky lokis is also real.
---
I mean.. and then they should give me the keys to the car to get away, right?
---
Protecting their RMT empire ... well done
---
We hit you so hard villy thought he was in goons again and progod has nulli flashbacks.
---
Yes I'm sure developers only put them in because they are aids.  I don't know any players who log in every day to do their dailies...
---
bill paxton... RIP :(
---
I know. You guys even scanned every super that warped in to save it. The fact is that you weren't able to save that one but pinged that it was allowed to die. It was already pretty much dead by the time the cyno falcon was on grid.
---
This is why you don't stream, you use streamers to create videos, pseudo tutorials, scripted, but feel like just game play but with enough screen time for certain elements that it can be learned from. YouTube is the platform for that, twitch streaming by these streamers is used to promote that. CCP just need to get their ass in gear and make a marketing campaign with game play that makes it look easy for new players. Get them engaged.
---
Imagine two fleets staring at each other because you can't get repair if you shoot the enemy.
---
As soon as you get agressed, shoot one target, wait for enemy logi to apply repairs, then proceed to kill all logi who got combat timer.
---
Or you bring boosh Raven/Rokh, because those are not in danger of getting aggro.
---
"Reeeeeeee, your style of play is not the same as mine! Daddy, please take away their fun, it's making me sad!" -you, probably
---
touche ...
---
Recons are exceptional since they dont appear on dscan. You are a ghost. No one can track you down. 
---
The rook without ecm is a solid brawler. Good tank, decent damage.
---
The curse is the god of 1v1 which is rare in eve. Shit tank but you can cap out anything that doesnt have a cap booster.
---
Ares is not a good combat ship. 
---
Huguin is low damage but a great kiter with its web bonus.
---
All these are fairly expensive and vulnerable to gate camps.
---
F4R, UALX i was in both and also watched the stream. 
---
&gt;Unless you have a LOT of time on your hands, it's really not that interesting...especially if you aren't a titan, FAX, or spai.
---
I can only speak for myself but i was buzzed for the majority of those fights, The excitement is seeing how the fight is going and hearing the rumours start up "NC. are moving their Titans down to rescue PL" then it was "goons northern Titans are heading this way too".
---
I remember the same thing happening in the Hero days when we had PL titans tackled and had to hold them for hours until Black Legions supers could join in. 
---
Its more than just the fight, its the whole experience.
---
When WWB started i made this post on r/games https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4c5dul/eve_online_the_first_great_war_in_nearly_2_years/
---
Look at the top comment,
---
&gt;is there some way to follow some of this live? sounds highly intruiging
---
TIS didnt really exist back then, to find a pod explaining what was going on youd have to go to the Meta show or Open comms. Neither were any good for outsiders wanting to watch. 
---
The same goes for the B-R post https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1wb8lf/largest_super_capital_fight_in_eve_online_history/
---
Top comment,
---
 
---
&gt;I always love how these EVE Battle Reports read like battlefield journalism. Or, at least they do in my mind.
---
The fact is, this is what draws people to EVE.
---
#(・o・ )
---
Introduce dynamic environmental effects like black holes, that suck in high mass ships (capitals), nebulas that cloak ships that are inside it, drifter attacks that affect local in affected system, etc. Make running citadels more expensive, introduce more AOE weapons that put debuffs on ships (i.e. 50% less reps) to counter blobs, ... Combine all that with finite resources so that the big blocks have to move around if they want to keep income at highest level. Once the big blocks are spread out more and traveling more, there are more opportunites to attack and disturb their operations.

I never understood why CCP and the EVE community have so little creativity and will to experiment with things. Most changes CCP makes are just nerfs or buffs of existing ships or systems. The recent blackout was unusually bold, but to me it seemd they were just looking for the cheapest way to introduce change.
---
Oh you need a PhD to talk now?
---
Is there really any real reason for the randomness though? It just means some get luckier than others for no reason. You can say that's just life, of course, but seems to me there's really no upside to doing it this way. Unless you specifically want to annoy some of your playerbase, I guess. By the same logic you could for example award new characters created on a new account a surplus of free SP on creation, varying from say 100k to 5mil, and it'd be just fine for everyone because it was, after all, just a free gift. Which is of course true in a sense, but also unequalizes the players for no reason whatsoever.
---
That’s actually scary - goons taking a sub cap fleet to get tackle before dropping in the soups! 
---
Well played goons !
---
I don't know man. Skill went from 2 d and 4 hours to 1 day 21h
---
I bet Alex could even hand him a German one...
---
Triple rep merm
---
Working as intended.
---
I’d say any ship that can nano/kite. There are a number of these ! 
---
Happy hunting
---
This man lives in Delve
---
The Cynabal is always a good time.
---
Can just do level 1s instead. It's what I did for most of my tertiary chars.
---
That's _exactly_ what people did before Alliances were a thing.
---
Gosh darn it, you're right. I always had one fit, but never lived long enough to use it!
---
People seem to find my stream not boring...
---
And that one time TEST kicked a player for dropping a dread with us (after solo roaming provi space) when EQ whined to TEST command.
---
You could start by not being apart of the biggest blob Dave... but god forbid you’ve never undocked with less than 20 people in a harpy fleet.
---
i mean, it kind of happend with blackout. They all just quit
---
&gt;Solo
---
How many alts?
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Bot typically cost ccp more money than they gain due to stolen account investigations and backcharges on credit cards. Do you really think all bot users build their own bots? Hell no they down load a malware infested program that steal account information off your client.
---
it's not a perfect system, they don't always have the ships on deck to save people even from PvE losses
---
if they ditch the randomness it encourages people to play
---
huge margin. 1b isk is around 6-7$ with plex it’s like $11-13 depending on plex price
---
500 plex for $12.50, 1 bil isk for$ 6.20. 
---
Yes people are willing to risk it to get ahead at a cheaper price
---
Remove asset safety. With no fuel and no asset safety, cits will be helped along the process
---
Eh, playerauctions shows up when I do that search, but plex is still the first result (ditto on incognito).
---
vOv
---
You are making a few assumptions here.  
---
1. You deserve content on your terms when you show up.  
---
2. Your fun is more important than their fun.  
---
3. They aren't having fun by dropping capitals on your face.  
---
It's a rather narcissistic thing to believe that a group of people, any people, should be willing to stop everything they are doing 40-50 times a day as people content roam into Delve and provide you with content just the way you want it.  Would you be willing to stop what you are doing every 20-30 minutes in EVE and participate how someone else wants you to and disregard what you were doing beforehand?
---
I mean the world is a peace right now because of the horrible realities of nuclear warfare... we don't have that limitation imposed on us in this made-up universe. Look at the world pre-nuclear age, the fighting never stopped.
---
"new"
---
there is rmt at the top, eve plex store is second, then more rmt
---
Yeah 200% margin I can see why people get tempted. I didn’t think it would be that much.
---
What we us nullseccers told when blackout happened?
---
Something along the lines of "AdaPt Or Die".
---
You say you're getting blown up in highsec due to pvp. Are you in a war? Are you venturing into lowsec/null/wh? Theres not many ways you can be legally pvp'd in highsec and being ganked as a newbro is pretty uncommon. We'll need more information if you want a better answer. DM your character name so I can look at your killboard and get a better idea?
---
You know that google etc also have sorting algorithms for advertisements? So if you look on phub all the time for grannies then you get more likely grannies on your next visit on top of the page.
---
At least for me the order is different, and the official site is on top.
---
They also claim that you chances of being banned are about 3%
---
Right. I am not saying that isn't true. I've been on enough save ops to know that is true. I am saying that it couldn't have been saved even if goons wanted to(and they did) but they stated it was allowed to die. It died because of the shitfit not because goons decided to let a shitfit super die.
---
Quick Google says 6.20 dollars for a billion isk, 240 plex costs 10 dollars which is about 880 mill? So about half the price?
---
i buy plex legit sometimes and looked at the site twice for less than 2 minites
---
You're a NullBloc propagandist. Your coalition takes N+1 players who have pulses and internet connections. The solution pretty simple: Griffin and Maulus. SeBos running take away mid slots from something else.
---
A bit harder with capitals, but if you jam a few Guardians/Basilisks, the rest will cap out and any logi ships will be ineffective without a lock.
---
I played for 10 years and never did any missions though.
---
Yes, I'm implying that that has something to do with your search history/cookies/etc, as my result puts plex at the top:
---
https://i.imgur.com/zPg5YlP.png
---
Again, not great to see playerauctions so high up, but vOv
---
I agree with the structure bashing but Risk aversion and blueballing as a tactic are massive issues to player retention and thats the playerbases fault. We don't really like to admit that though.
---
I think CCP has
---
Absolutely agree. That fit is beyond dumb and cheap. IH got lucky with that one since even without a titan bridge S-6 is close 1-D(3 jumps with a JB).
---
Blackout would have actually made cloaky camping pretty ineffective, since you couldn't just sit in a system and get paid for it and you can't tell if the ship you are dropping on is bait with a sabre sitting right next to it.
---
Problem was that blackout was just too big of a change.
---
Yeah, I'm kinda over free skill point.... Kinda pointless when the only decent server you have left is turning blue.
---
I am indeed in goons, and fully acknowledge where the problem lie. I am just a fc though (shitty one at that most tell me). I think unless citadels and tz tanking get changed, with the implementation of a reason for conflict (resource scarcity) then we are screwed. Even then, it might not fix a lot of the current stagnation and risk aversion / demand for safety that a lot of people have. That combined with the cancer that is mass blueing....sigh. if one thing in eve needs to go away it's alliance diplos.
---
I would have thought that would be too high a risk for someone with a 10 year old character or something. But I guess most rmts aren’t old characters that people care about
---
Yep and if people can't fit something close to decent it makes the save that much more difficult.
---
Legacy is currently fighting a war against WinterCo (PandaFam), the theater for that being on the eastern edges of their space. You seriously don't see the advantage of PanFam gaining control of the territories on their western shores?
---
oh i don't wanted to say that you buy on rmt sites, but right now people write a lot of stuff about rmt, and then people will look this up... Which changes for a while the ordering on search engines...
---
they just use an alt to obfuscate the transaction and ccp loses millions to rmt but still doesn’t sue the shit out of rmt sites.
---
remove anom and belt ratting entirely
---
give mining vessels a 60 second align time
---
remove rorq panic mode
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but that phrase was coined by PL and TAPI took it from them.  You know much like everything else.
---
The force is strong with this one.
---
Nope, you read this into my comment. 
---
I explicitly mentioned the game design to make clear it’s CCPs fault for still not looking at supercarriers and tone their applications to subcaps down. 
---
Players of the game are not responsible for playing it in the most efficient way. Hence why I don’t see blobbing as a problem, nor using subcaps in massive numbers to defend something. Both of this is easier to mitigate than the wonder weapons supers are especially in blobs.
---
if you use ad block it will block the ad which is the first result
---
I really don’t. The first move toward that Goon and Test super fleets deploy. Panfam can’t take both on. So why bother? No one wants to grind structures or sov anymore.
---
I like the selection of drones.
---
MORE RANDOM BLACKOUTS!
---
I have tried them on n off. Using them for hunting a lot now (thank God for drifter connects). I wish null-null connections were doubled at this point. Tbh how safe eve is they should just double all connections.
---
Big issue with wh I have is what to do with my titans n supers. And most of my Corp would struggle making isk in one (lot of old casual people)
---
Gist X-Type X-Large Shit Booster

Brutix Navy hull tanked, myrmidon active, dual rep stable, stable vni, all good choices for solo fun. Myrm is the cheapest tho. Bni has the best dps I think.
---
the trick did work - it was just that the 'other guy' was better at the trick.
---
the trick has always been, and still is "drop every super you can get your dirty little paws on".
---
In a group bigger than 1 person, are you shocked when 1 or more people complain about something?
---
considering i've never seen an RMT site advert - i think this has way more to do with your search history than anything else.

F for injector prices next month.

This has been around over 10 years. Every couple years I see another post about it, but AFAIK there's no good explanation for what's happening.
---
Sandboxes have limited amounts of sand.
---
If little Timmy has 85% of the sand used to make his castle, and the other 5 kids can't make a single tower, then they will go get Timmy's sand.

How can i get that?
---
I don't know much about the game, but I find it ridicolous that multiple accounts can run at the same time. One person can have a fleet of miners, bodyguards, stealth ships in nearby systems and doing fw at the same time. It's only natural that people automatize it with bots. I honestly would make only one account can run on a machine on a given time(like it is for alphas), and put in the game "corp npcs"(with a restriction on the number, maybe with a new skill that gives like 5+3×lvl or something for the copr leader) that do mining or other slow activities and behave a bit like the existing mining npcs, but with player made fits and some basic instructions(go there and mine, warp away if yellow box, 
---
...), and an operating time(maybe 4h a day you can choose). Attacking them would give suspect timer if not at war with the corp. If destroyed revive after a cooldown and refit if a ship is available.  
---
Basically make bots a feature of the game, so it can be controlled and tuned by CCP and discourage third party bots that insta warp out as soon as someone enters local or other things like that.
---
Yes. Now if you don't mind; your papers, please.
---
OK, I'm not going to teach you about military strategy in this comment section. Ask Meiqur, he'll know.
---
&gt; No one wants to grind structures or sov anymore. 
---
Did an RC member seriously just say that with a straight face? It's like 99% of what you guys do xD
---
You guys troll toast when we are asleep or at work, we sit in keepstar 2 days later babysitting the timers and listening to our FCs doing kareoke while you're asleep/at work. Maybe hunting down DeadDuck as he chases toasters around while we're at it. - This is what the Provi vs RC conflict is.
---
Any timer of important isn't so much Provi vs RC as it is PanFam vs Legacy. Basically whoever has the most bored batphone that day wins.

No titans? 5/10 umbrella.

Eve's implementation is rather an incentive to its truest sense, rather than something that is canon-gameplay
---
You suggest just to buy raw/P1 materials to produce P3/P4?
---
Ads on the search results page are based on the specific query.  Companies can target keywords they want their ad displayed alongside.
---
buy which ever makes the most profit, it may be p2 -&gt; p4, or even p3 -&gt; p4.
---
as i said, you'll have to do the maths.
---
The main advantage of having multiple accounts is that it allows you to field multiple ships at the same time. Those extra ships can:
---
1. scout
---
2. tackle
---
3. provide links (buffs)
---
4. probe
---
5. increase your combat ship count and therefore firepower and defensive power
---
6. light cynos to move your caps
---
7. increase your mining yield
---
8. haul stuff around
---
9. \[...\]
---
Many pve activities are greatly enhanced by multiboxing, ie you make way more isk if you mine with 5 ships instead of 1, or if you fight super strong rats with 5 ships when 1 wouldn't be able to kill them, etc.
---
In a fleet situation, 40 players flying 1 ship each would be at an obvious disadvantage when facing 40 players multiboxing 2 ships each.
---
Most players who own capital and super capital ships usually have separate accounts to fly those, since as stated above, it allows them to fly scout and recon (cyno) ships at the same time. It also makes management easier if the capital character is always sitting inside its capital ship ready to undock, while the player can go on with their everyday routine on other characters.
---
Having multiple accounts isn't required to have fun in the game (especially if you're a casual), but many vets do have more than one active character and the advantages this provides are undeniable.
---
No. But it also means that if I'm a narcissist, so are they. They - the cap droppers - are putting their method of having fun over even their own alliance members that would want actual fights. So then we have three groups - attacking roamers, defending subcaps, defending cap droppers. And the third one is the only one that gets to have "fun" in this scenario.
---
Thank you so much, that is great news!  Will try it tonight!
---
Pretty much. Eve is the purest implementation of capitalism, so it only makes sense that it would become another strong argument against it
---
For sure. The isk faucet turned into a fire hose and screwed the game up long term. Oh how I miss the pre-mining rorqual and post fighter nerf days. Isk had real meaning and fights had consequences. Now you can expect anywhere from 5x supers to 50x supers in response to anything.
---
I am literally getting my information from the CSM minutes, from the presentation that Exooki presented. He even posted the same info to Reddit very recently. Basically, you are full of shit. You obviously don't have alts in GSF, as your opinion on how super ratting and saving them works is hilariously wrong. You are a worthless krab, just admit it.
---
what the fucking fuck are you talking about?
---
Ebic nice
---
Well, you know the risk-vs-reward principle, and you also know that there is no local in Wormholes, and Hole control demands high dedication?
---
If you would accept no local in Sov-Null I would gladly grant you the higher income per Char. Finally then you would not be forced to create up to 50-Acc-Setups to satisfy your needs ;-) ....
---
Agree wholeheartedly.
---
you do it in jspace for a reason tho, aren't you? Then stop pretending these are the same.
---
Nothing, because ramjags are a thing
---
Yeah I don't think there really is a way to fix it. EVE has always been an N+1 game, but there were limiting factors in years past: i.e. there was a skillpoint gap that could only be overcome by time to train into capital ships, where a smaller force could use capital ships to beat a much larger subcapital force. This went out the window with skill injectors, and the cost of obtaining these capital ships went insanely down due to mineral proliferation, unlimited build slots in structures, and the general ISK farmability allowing players to afford them.
---
T1 BC are cheap and fun.  
---
the MJD can save your ass.
---
bulked brutix, multi rep myrm or gnosis. Brutix or hurican Navy are awsome but a little more expansive.  
---
navy cruiser as omen navy, osprey navy are very good kiter
---
You can make pretty good money killing explorers in a wormhole. Wait til they hack all the cans, then while he's hacking the last can (he'll be distracted by hacking), blow his ass up, scoop loot, scoot off and drop loot. repeat. Ive made  like 8 bil in a month doing this a few years back. Fit a scram and an AB, or maybe no prop mod at all, its preference at a point. Definitely a scram though.
---
Poo just wants that sweet ass honey.
---
I am certainly not there. I will say I am past the enforcer :P
---
Real talk though, a lot of the new PvE content that has been coming out (Abyss, invasion, etc) make some pretty decent streaming. Combine that with a knowledgeable and engaged streamer and you have some pretty high-quality streams out there right now. 
---
There are also some GREAT PvP streams. The issue there is that often PvP is unpredictable and thus hard to work with from a streamers perspective. Once again the secret is in the streamer far more than the content. 404 and DTM, for example, I find entertaining even when he isn't actively getting a fight
---
Invite more choas...put it in a random non planned skill. Keep yourself guessing

Risk/reward does not affect who drives PLEX demand, only reward. The price of a limited good like PLEX is determined by who gets priced out of the goods first, and the people with the highest incomes are the last ones to be priced out.
---
&gt;more than two supercarriers for every Loki of the attackers. 
---
Rookie numbers.
---
just because people don't like people building empires, doesn't mean people will stop building empires. this is because the game rewards people for building empires.
---
A good story, well told.
---
here's a much shorter version:
---
what we learned is that ccp has no direction, no balls, and no motivation since the purchase a year ago
---
I don't disagree that streamers are valuable and should be encouraged, but my argument is that CCP has traditionally, and continues to, miss the mark on the biggest asset that brings people in. 
---
It's not a slick promo video (that has literally zero in game footage), or a "Get Your PLEX" banner on Facebook, or a Twitch partnership. Each of those does bring in players, but they're the icing not the cake. What draws interest in this game are the stories of the shit we pull off. And CCP could be doing a lot more to publicize and promote those stories, particularly by supporting the people who are already trying to.

Same here, we as a small Lowsec Group had a blast between Phoebe &amp; Lifeblood Patches. Schroedingers Supercap-Fleet was removed (it was always there if you did not scout) and Moons did belong to regional groups, sparking nice regional conflicts around them. The 1st iteration of Citadels tbh killed some of our content (Supers could jump into insta-tether on unfueled structures) of Superhunting, but the moons still did pay for some nice comps free4all in Corphangar that we regularly brought to Nullsec to spark fights. We were the type of guys that tackled something and let it live to cause a defense fleet fighting us.

You might want to look at the dates on your graphs next time before trying to trend-fit them via confirmation bias

Give it some years

People still care about numbers?

yeah i read it too, funny thing is that one thing that one person from the CSM says doesn't necessarily make it true, nor does it mean that other people in his "group" he supposedly represents agree with him!

Also the CSM is shit and should be disbanded, nothing good ever came out of them.

You can continue to take everything he said and all of the stats he listed out of context if you want, have fun with that.

While I don't find your first statement reasonable, I do agree region lock for Chinese would not hurt anyone

---
Really good thought there. Make the blob unnecessary as a defense strategy. Making fewer game mechanics depend on corp/alliance membership sounds like a smart move. It moves more of the cooperation and coordination into the human element of diplomacy rather than in-game flags.
---
Hm. What if sov could be held not just by alliances but by corporations? Individuals?
---
He runs effective harassment campaigns. I remember a certain FC having to jump back and forth to deal with timers he created until that certain FC made a lil mistake and got his alliance + NC.’s alliance superfleet murdered by other people.

Good times.

Cheating is much more accepted as a way of getting things done in current panda culture. It’s deeply engrained in their education system, which acts as an indoctrination into the panda states narrative of the world. The “all of a sudden” feeling, comes from the kickback of the politically correct wave of sentiment that says. Anything said that’s negative is racist, and shouldn’t be allowed.
---
Tldr: You can’t say negative things about Panda, period.
---
So what you're saying is, Supers shouldn't be able to jump, and should only be manufacturable in an alliance/corp-designated capitol system... I dig it.
---
Sure, you can just set up a \*bunch\* of holder corps, but at some point that'll become untenable. :D
---
That was kind of my thought. They'll be "entrenched" no matter what. The point is to make the surrounding territory they aren't using less vulnerable to game-breaking super blobs.
---
That doesn't make the content of your writing more truth. 
---
All but 2 of the players represent a null sec perspective, writing veteran players from different areas of space implies that there is some degree of representation of different area's there really isn't and you should be fully aware of this.
---
Yes, but that is only to subs and you need it to be a steam account, buying plex on it is more expensive then a sub directly on your account in case it isn’t on steam...

*My harbinger was fit with the following...*

Seems the same to me. I don't see any harm in this?
---
I mean ship stats are basically just changing numbers in a db and ccp cant even do that regularly
---
Panda culture?
---
As if they had before
---
Players value winning zkillboard more than playing the game
---
I feel like your reaction is predicated on thinking that it's the fringes of large blocs' sprawl, where capital response is slower, and lighter, that people \*should\* be relying on for content, versus that just being the case now because of the blobs.
---
Who cares if GSF is un-evictable from the 10 systems they are willing to gate-jump their caps to, if it means there's now 40+ systems they don't bother defending/holding anymore? Someone else will move into those systems, \*without the resources of GSF\*, and you'd hunt them. Also, gate-jumping a cap response fleet gives you time to kill almost anything before they arrive. I suspect response fleets wouldn't be caps at all, barring structure fights.
---
"after cyno change the goonies are really dead this time" lmao hahahaha
---
It's to kill a small amount of rats, its almost the easiest version of a daily I've seen in any game. If you want to login and spend the 5-10 minutes, here's a prize. If not, well you were missing out on stuff anyway. This really feels like the most minor of grievances for a minority of people.
---
Complaining about Russian botters is so 3 years ago. Complaining about Chinese botting is the new hotness.

Answer the man's question, Zelden!
---
Also your point about "making life harder" is totally right. It isn't that null needs to be harder, the PVE is challenging enough as it is when you're in subcaps. The point of null wasn't necessarily the difficulty but the lawlessness. The way of life out there should be entirely player driven and lean on game mechanics as little as possible. I wasn't there for it but the way null worked prior to sov (to say nothing of fozzie sov) sounded pretty dynamic and organic to me vs. what happens now.
---
except you aren't punished. even the folks that play every day don't always worry about this. eve is the long con, you'll have more sp eventually, and 10k a day here and there isn't going to bump you to anywhere crazy much faster.
---
Degrading space.. scarcity of resources. Have thousands of people mining and shooting red chevrons in the same two regions, have those regions become worthless over time... Force people to move, force people to work like idiots to keep the massive super fleets flying and citadels running...
---
Doesn't really matter though. I doubt the game would survive that kind of change. Nobody currently playing can be arsed to put in any kind of effort.
---
Oh, they are. The drifter attacks that happened over the summer? Prelude to the triglav/drifter war where huge NPC fleets will plow through null battling it out and the residents will be caught in the crossfire as their assets/structures are burned to the ground.

i literally said nothing about the difficulty, you complete oxygen thief.
---
1) like I said, you're not actually factoring in the total isk generation of the two, just ratting bounties; in actuality, the single k-space region produces WAY more isk in total.
---
2) the risk to individuals is much higher in w-space, so it makes sense for the reward to individuals (i.e. ratting bounties, versus e.g. moons, which are more of an org-oriented income stream) to be higher as well.

0.0 conflict (actual narrative conflict, not meaningless lolfights) was the same thing over and over - a stampede of casuals and newbies into nullsec who got into a tussle with established residents. ie, casual zerger underdogs vs geared tryhards elite as in every RPG ever. Either the residents would fall from their own hubris, or the newbies crash on their own incompetence. One side poached anything worthwhile from the other and the cycle started again. Completely fucked now obnov because CCP handed out welfare space/SP/supers to everyone and anyone.

No I won’t. My alliance has chinese corps, so chinese content will be on the table.
---
Could you link one of these posts? I’ve had a quick google but can’t find anything
---
Silly question, what does PCU mean? I'm sure it relates to player count but I don't know the full acronym.
---
But there is a conversion ratio to everything. If you are fine with just grinding for isk later when you wanted to play, then just buy the sp you feel you missed out on? I'm no fan of injectors but skills are just another form of isk waiting to be converted, you only lose out in your mind. Its freebie stuff to help with login numbers, sure, but is anyone really harmed? Seeing more people log/logged in encourages some players to login as well and see whats up. I don't see it hurting anything. 
---
The aspect about minor grievances is that people seem to find a way to grieve about _EVERYTHING_.
---
I miss the days where I could predict what every member of a corp could fly by looking at a characters age
---
The game has inputs and calculations on 1 second ticks.
---
So it's more quality of life as long as you get a few frames per second.
---
Nice, good luck!
---
You're not asking this in good faith because it's clear to everyone
---
Well, being able to learn about the "meta-game" and follow it would, IMO, make it more likely people stick around for more than a couple days.
---
so its racist but you wont explain how or why
---
Interested to see the RamCane idea, got a fit lying around for one anywhere
---
Recently the chinese bought a large alliance, after only being on this server for a year.
---
Well, it's more that what they don't want to happen on TQ happen on Serenity, which is where this "new foreigner group" came from and they are doing the same things they did there.
---
doubt this will become a reality but a decision like this being made in good faith on both sides does give me hope, so heres to a better warzone!
---
It's real, and it's actually a ton of fun to be on coms when somebody gets in trouble and race to save them. Particularly when somebody competent is around to organize tackle + the drop to get sweet BRs like this, instead of just causing the aggressors to scatter.
---
so you are someone on "alternative facts too"? As mine are real and proven scrub
---
Wtf. Lvl 1mission or do a combat anomaly? Burrows and hideaways are so dick easy.
---
ohh, and there by forcing content through the plexes? or are they after a different goal?
---
Good to see the players coming together to fix an issue when the devs won't notice. It means that we really care about eve and long term health of the game.
---
Somehow this stuff was mostly fine when it was RED.OVERLORD being funded by deep(er) pockets than the above.  Not sure what's different this time.
---
Well... I'm not that new XD
---
I played this game for four years some time ago, I'm familiar with community and all the bullshit happening
---
I would assume the goal is to force people into plexs and hopefully result in fights
---
EVE is dying because of:
---
* ~~POS spam~~
---
* ~~Tech moons~~
---
* ~~Capitals~~
---
* ~~Citadels~~
---
* ~~Fozzie Sov~~
---
* ~~Jump Fatigue~~
---
* ~~Russian renters~~
---
* ~~Local~~
---
* ~~Goons~~
---
* ~~No local~~
---
* ~~Black out~~
---
* The Chinese
---
does that require to blue all of eve though?
---
The above comment is the only one you really need. Between Eveplanets and Fuzzwork you can gather most of the info you are looking for. You will definitely want to look at the planets directly to get a sense of resource availability/yield. Check the market for price trends and volumes. Also think about what kind of commitment you want to make time wise to your setup, how long the extraction cycles are, how much shuttling of resources from planet to planet you want to do. 
---
In hisec importing component resources to factory or split factory/extraction planets will make the most isk. If you already have your planets set up it’s probably too late to shift what you are making without tearing planets down and setting new ones up. If you just want to know what PI is most profitable open fuzzwork and sort by profit.
---
haha no u dont get it wormholes are the problem
---
Lol no one owes you anything more than the explanation already given.
---
Jokes on them the krabs will never ever pvp and rather leave or unsubscribe
---
basically this. if people want lp they'd be forced to be out in the plexes where an engagement is more likely to happen.
---
Hypothetically it could make the zone more pvp-focused as those solely interested in mission-farming would probably pack up for safer pastures, meaning less lp farming in general.
---
Is this operation condoned by the real owners of the Amarr - Minmatar warzones?
---
is this the "yellow-donut" or "brown-donut" ?
---
FlyingHotpocket still plays? He was a giant retard back in 2013.
---
Disposable accounts would work just fine for that purpose, especially if there was the potential to temporarily headshot FC's or people in leadership positions within enemy groups on the the eve of something critical.
---
Cyno was not in place until after he was already in low armor/structure. You weren't going to save it even if you lit and jumped in. Cyno inhibs were up too so you couldn't light the cyno on top of them.  Like I said in another comment. It didn't die because goons decided to make an example of a shitfit. It died because it was shitfit.
---
When you see a Megathron on dscan in a WH, most likely it’s rolling.
---
I think it was more about "hey we cant be killed if we fit a cyno".
---
I saw some lightning while ratting, but it was hitting the NPC structures in the anomaly, not my ship.
---
that's giving a lot of credit to the botters...
---
I'm already enjoying the game by doing exploration and PI/industry. I've been in WH corp, low-sec corp, null sec corp. But I'm just really curious cuz I'm unfamiliar with these terminologies.
---
you really don't know how the game works at all do you. Who's blues? Each alliance has different lists of blues(and reds) and here's the kicker, sometimes alliances that have NO affiliation with any of the groups on the field will come just to get free kills.
---
Hahahaha good to see they're back to trying to inflate the logins, to make it look like Blackout recovery is going better than it is.  Didn't they already learn fudging numbers makes metrics harder to judge?
---
that's not really how that works...
---
I want to find the MC vid where nc and PL completely blocked a gate so you couldn't even get to the gate cause there was so many titans blocking the gate
---
I bet they still dont out mine delve.
---
Ugh please no CCP. Don't make this one of those shitty Korean MMOs with stupid daily quests.
---
We hate dailies because it makes you feel like you have to log in and do them, even though they're not at all entertaining, otherwise you're missing out. The beauty of Eve's skill system is that generally, once you've paid (or PLEXed up), it avoids that.
---
Events that actually get people out in space and potential content are different, because they improve the gameplay for everyone around them. The old Guardians' Gala and so on, before you made them not worth it with the mining and BPC nonsense, they were fun and worthwhile.
---
But 'shoot 10 rats in a level 1 mission' isn't, it's just a daily grind and that's not fun.
---
allowing docking for supercaps was one of the many mistakes (definitely not the only one)
---
Name checks out
---
Requests for low-sec gate to stain is extremely menacing and harassing. I'm going to report you.
---
&gt; hey can't really delete space now
---
yes they can, though not overnight. Some transitional arrangement would work just fine. It would be too bad for the people living there, but there are plenty of examples where certain players had somehow invested in one thing or another and got hit with changes / nerf bat / whatever. It's justifable if it helps the game.
---
Good luck with jamming a FAX
---
It’s strange that peace is bad for the game. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I understand PvP is the biggest draw for a lot of people, but it just makes me laugh that we’re in pretty much a “space golden age” and the reaction is “WHERE’S ALL THE WAR!!!!!!!!” Not saying peace is good for content, quite the opposite in fact, just kind of funny!
---
no that's just a basic fact.
---
if you don't want people to do things; stop rewarding them when they do.
---
yeah bottomline I dont see how things got better with citadels, with the exception of swapping pods that have implants, but that could have been done via other means
---
Or you could remove 85% of the sand and have all six kids fighting for that remaining 15%
---
*roll Grammarly ad*
---
No local was already asked for for 0.0 before WH space even existed.
---
Thank you very much 😊
---
I’ll try to stop on by.
---
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
---
I was warned that this sub is cancer. Seeing people complain about 10k SP for logging in and killing an NPC confirms it. I could multibox rat for a few hours and buy 400,000 SP with with my earnings, but somehow 10k SP is blasphemy.
---
This was discussed at the csm summit, the current data/relic sites are lacking that "jackpot" that they used to. I cant provide any info on a fix, or timeline, but we did bring it up.
---
This is like Goons/TEST transferring all their keepstars to each other temporarily and not allowing any docking so super pilots can't rat with their supers and have to do something productive.
---
Is skilling spree per account or per character?
---
Likewise, none of the elite pvpers are looking to give the krab a fair fight either.
---
When you're trying to gank someone and you become the one being ganked, you're not really in a position to complain.
---
Oh god you guys are really going to make this your new propaganda line, aren't you?
---
PLEX prices dropped when nullbears and botters quit null. Wormhole income won't have changed during blackout.
---
Not to mention the hilarity of comparing *the entirety of J space* with *one single region*. If you compare J with K then it looks quite different, doesn't it?
---
That's the point. We don't know, but you're assuming it was more than "some", whilst chastising the dude for making assumptions. I just thought it was ironic.
---
cant we get free baby injectors like the old days
---
Biomass then also leave reddit
---
RMT sites almost certainly aren't breaking any RL law. They're trampling all over the EULA of course but all CCP can do about that is ban accounts.
---
I mean what does a 10 years old character means if u get banned , u could just injected a new one with rmt money
---
I have a very specific memory but I don't know which memory is correct!
---
Wait, are you implying  these people understand logic ?
---
stainguy has become a protected class
---
This. If ccp had added system control methods before removing local everything would have been fine. Removing literally the only system control method k-space has without anything else being added was simply never going to work.
---
Yeah that was sort of my point. It could be done but it'd be a lot of effort to pregenerate cleanly unassociated accounts in advance.
---
But, in turn, it removes some intentional difficulty.
---
Multiboxing ruins the economy and warfare of EVE. 
---
If more people (thus more effort) are required to mine, then the value of mining goes up. This in turn means that resources become valuable again, means that mining can be done by smaller groups and be more profitable, thus more enjoyable.
---
If more people are needed to move capitals around, there would be more difficulty in organizing cap umbrellas, this in turn buffs sub-cap warfare. I also think that if it's a bigger group with capitals, they will also have more difficulty with moving them around. Where as smaller groups have an easier job.
---
Also, say there is a war between two corps that have 20 true players each, but one of the corps has an average of 2 accounts per player, then currently that corp would have an advantage in terms of firepower, despite it being the same amount of people. Removing multiboxing would equalize such a situation that should be equal in the first place.
---
Oh no, I was throwing out a logic bomb. Waiting to see who stares at it and pokes with a stick like it's some strange machine from another world.
---
We're super happy you raised this!
---
You can roam in a cruiser, many good suggestions in here. But you'll get caught a lot more often and miss tackle on a lot of other ships than if you were in a frigate.
---
I've had the most success solo in a frigate. I started out flying the Slicer and learning to kite. I now fly the Retribution and Wolf. I've also seen a fair bit of solo Kikimoras.
---
Yes. This people are the directors of the mains fw alliances
---
Osprey Navy Issue is a little more forgiving for the newer pilot- while it isn't as fast (a powerful tool for a good nano boi), it has a more forgiving tank and can reliably deal with ramjags by running 2 neuts (I've found that a med/small mix is hard to deal with, even for enemies that are using a nosferatu)
---
Nosprey RLMLs also fly farther, so even blingier ceptors have a harder time holding you.
---
The kikimora is popular with some people, but it's hard to get fights because the Kiki is just aggressively better than any ship that isn't a cruiser or bigger, so nobody will fight you.
---
That sounds great. Now go use that isk to do something you really enjoy!
---
Oh wow. Good job copy pasting my post :D
---
Though I am glad you agree with me. Way to spread the word.
---
How about the blackout, would you like to see it back?
---
The purpose of the gank is not to get a fair fight from the gankee, but to provoke a fight from the defence fleet.
---
Gosh look at the Tapi victim complex at work lmao
---
"You have to blue everyone otherwise you are in danger in a pvp video game" oh no xd
---
Out of the loop, someone explain?
---
Defenders will always bring, out of what they have available, the most cancerous composition, *if they don't actually want to play the PVP game*. Which shouldn't be the case.
---
Also, any of those other options would have been a far more fun fight than supers. It *is* retarded that supers can apply to subcaps, you wouldn't expect battleships to apply to nano frigates.
---
You only get banned if you pay the smaller amount 4 times.
---
There was a time goons wouldn’t drop supers until subcap superiority had been established.
---
"New blood" and a "bunch of cheaters" aren't the same thing.  More people are NOT good for a gaming community if said group consistently shows they have no regard for the rules.
---
There are some 70-80m Sleeper/Talocan/etc items that drop in data sites.
---
Some faction BPCs for Upwell modules - whatever the faction POS mod BPCs are going to be converted to - should end up in there though.
---
I think he means snuff
---
Not nyxes
---
Surprisingly i actually enjoy PI so far))
---
On side I also do exploration in hi-sec, now I train for stratios to do WH exploration. Not sure tho which fit to pick, I guess C5 data anoms with stratios full passive shield tank is deprecated these days
---
True, they are 8.9b. But they are sexy so worth.
---
Like jump fatigue??
---
because reddit has shit formatting https://pastebin.com/4L9BJMhx
---
But the people getting ganked don't want to give you a fair fight. You came to their house and they are going to use everything in their power to kill you.
---
I agree completely. Its just another broken and forgotten feature.
---
Yeap, different opinions about whether an event is good or not is cancer. You got it bud. You think I don't also have a problem with injectors?
---
They got shit on. Gone are the days of shaking a station to see what kind of fleet falls out.
---
Fucking normies
---
People generally spam the missions as it provides the best isk/hr in the game for its low bar of entry.
---
Plexing is not really going to compare so I suspect it will result in the farmers swapping back to the Cal/Galmil warzone and those who wanted to do PvP in the Amarr/Minmatar warzone remaining.
---
Though when I did actively do FW as my main source of content I lived of the missions. Doing 2-4 hours of them a week allowed me to PvP for the rest of my free time without feeling poor. I was Galmil and when those missions stopped paying the bills I moved into Wormholes.
---
So I feel this may cause a small contraction in the amount of PvP that happens in the warzone, but probably not by much.
---
The supers were just an honorable third party to the rescue harpies.
---
Yeah the difference is he was banned and the RR purchaser wasn't as of yet.
---
Yes, which is why there's a responsibility on CCP to make game design changes to encourage interactions between players which are fun, and make it harder to drop a blob.
---
Htfu tbh
---
Copyright laws?
---
Should we also make it harder to gank? I am sure if you think getting blobbed 200 vs 20 is unfun you will certainly consider 20 vs 1 unfun as well?
---
A thesaurus rex? Falcon is a middle management dino now? Whut.
---
Bingo. Something I've been saying for years. Every time they change something to make the game "harder" for any specific type of playstyle, people will band together more. Those changes affect large corporations/alliances far less than solo/small gang people. The Cyno changes aren't great, but they don't really affect large alliances much, because they have the people and money to be able to work around the changes. It just causes people to seek their shelter even more.
---
People band together to fight the game now, instead of banding together to fight each other.
---
&gt;Win trading to keep one side permanent tier 5 would probably be more effective in forcing ccps hand to change fw. But yeah you are right let's see if they can defeat the farmer pigs
---
\&gt;Implying that hasn't happened for over 3 years.
---
Very generous of them to ensure the Harpy pilots for their content.
---
Somehow a hurricane fucked me up the other day. I still don’t get how, but it happened.
---
Not quite forgotten. Fozzy mentioned an idea for, I believe it was the Sansha dreadnaught, that when in siege it also max locked the AB to max settings and it could not be turned off while in siege. It sounded like a fun idea.
---
Did you just assu 
---
-user has been banned from the server-
---
Not as a result of that, as far as I know.
---
My understanding is he was banned _prior_ to that for RMT-related nonsense, but then "legitimately" dropped 50k into plex.  As far as I'm aware, no ban resulted from that.
---
I’m a friendly wormholer! Don’t mind the downvotes if that’s what people want to do :) have an upvote
---
4 if you're TLF, 5 if you're IC24.
---
At least according to Dotlan and assuming you only blitz lv 4's.
---
Logically in any real world example there are huge downsides to grouping up too heavily - there aren't enough resources for people to group up past a certain point. In eve however people don't need any space, food, drink etc and the `jobs` are spawned at a rate capable of housing mega empires in single regions.
---
You know that's a meme because that's what nullblobbers have been saying to small gang players for years when changes favoured you, right?
---
A lot of dudes that were in FW for years began to think of it as *just* a source of income.  It started with them creating an alt to put in the opposing militia to farm LP when your own militia is in the shitter.
---
Eventually a lot of people figured, why bother being in militia when you can just have a couple bomber alts in each militia and leave with your main so you can shoot anybody.
---
Wormholes are the way to go
---
So, you're that sad of a person that you consider EVE players as your siblings and CCP is your mommy?
---
&gt; Allowing docking allows for people to play without committing insane amounts of time to playing the game
---
Stop spreading nonsense
---
I have no idea what transpires in Eve anymore. Some of the best content I ever got was from snuff kicking us gals out of null. Fond memories really.  Looking back I left on a high note.  Was really fun.
---
Is this an alt account for you? Literally all your posts and deleted posts are twitch clips for this guy.
---
That is not and has never been true. Nothing says "looking for a fight" like a covert ops cloak.
---
They are looking for easy kills, then complaining when they become someone else's easy kill. It's pure hypocrisy.
---
Doubt it, they're not republishing anything as their own. I guess if they're using the logo for PLEX or something but even then they could probably claim fair use.
---
I didn't blame anything or anyone. Players currently value winning more than playing. This means they will "win" at all costs - by not taking 50/50 fights and only taking fights they will win 9 out of 10 times.  Think of it this way - I play CS:GO - due to ELO, I win 50% of my games. I don't care when I lose as long as I did well, and they just outplayed me. In EVE the community mostly will not undock unless they can win, or they are forced into it. Players in EVE value winning more than fair pvp. This isn't a knock on anyone, or anything - just an observation.
---
It would be better if there were other objectives that roamers could use to provoke a fight. The thing with being ganked in a risky site, though, is that while the gank in itself isn't fun, it's the risk of it happening that makes the PVE have any interest at all.
---
so it would be the only dread that wasn't locked in place while in seige?
---
&gt;As far as why winnie the pooh, the Chinese “president”  made it illegal to compare him to pooh after a meme came out doing so.
---

---
I enjoy your stream sometimes too, but I'm an active player rather than someone with no background in the game.
---
I'm not looking to diss streamers, and in an earlier comment I stress that supporting them is a good thing. But from a marketing perspective I think they should be pushing more content about the shared world we're building and what we do in that meta. There's a reason why those stories get so much attention.
---
I think we’re still at citadels, but I’m not saying it’s the Chinese that’re killing it, in fact I think FRT were one of the few to actually fight the TAPIperium blob. Mango killed serenity and Legacy welcomed them into their coalition with open arms, what a joke.
---
Wow that is so funny and witty
---
I recently reinstalled the client and toured around EvE in an alpha toon just to see ‘what’s new’.  Aside from noting how the graphics are starting to look a bit shit compared to other games, it was quite jarring to see a lot of chatter and depots etc using Chinese characters.   
---
Jarring in the sense that not only could I not read any of it, but how it breaks immersion for a player who joins a game primarily about socially interacting with others — and they can’t, because language.
---
For games that have social interaction at their core, there should be language separation per server.
---
TLDR; all real world pilots and air traffic controllers speak a common language (English) for a reason.
---
Yes.
---
Where did you hear that? I think maybe the only other bloc opposed to PIBC that stood even a little bit of a chance leaving the game to come to TQ was the final blow 
---
That group was FRT, and now PIBC migrated here in the form of TAPI valued coalition members.
---
What an insightful and not at all hypocritical thing to say!
---
Yes let's drive more content to null. Great idea kiddos
---
I mean, sure, it certainly might be RMT.  It also might be some whale just dropping cash into plex.  After all, we've got nerds dropping double that into jpeg spaceships in star citizen.
---
If it's the former, sure, ban that filth.
---
If it's the latter: that's just EVE, baby.
---
According to CCP numbers at least. 5-7% of the playerbase lives in wormholes, 30% live in Nullsec. Then according to coalition.inspace, Imperium makes up about 25% of the sov null playerbase.
---
Maybe the gal/cal dudes will migrate over to the ammar/minmatar zone, and we'll end up with one FW zone full of PVP and the other one full of LP grinders.
---
Goons and their pets always say that something is hurting the little guys, or some change will hurt the little guy, when in fact it’s hurting them more.
---
I think the most recent one was how blackout didn’t hurt Goons it only hurt the little guys 
---
Drifters didn’t hurt goons cus they had the numbers to defend, it only hurt the little guys
---
Etc
---
Used to get mentioned.
---
It was 5 Trillion isk
---
It's got a resolution of about 10px. The number one way to hide a fake is to shit all over the quality.
---
You must be AUTZ, where spoopy activity is basically just me.
---
&gt;Im doubling down on this shit
---
Can they run agents in caldari/gal zones for lp?
---
I bet you have a problem with a lot of things.
---
&gt;Oh no, I was throwing out a logic bomb. Waiting to see who stares at it and pokes with a stick like it's some strange machine from another world.
---
Holy F , i love this

Chinese communist party? I dont see Ji Jinping being of serenity. Especially with the reeducation death camps right now
---
You just realized NOW that FW is infested by Jackdaws running missions?
---
&gt;Never skip 'better' because its not 'best'
---
In this particular case this is very true: rate limiting skill injecting would likely be a simple thing to implement that would help. Far from a complete solution but as a stepping stone, it would be great.
---
I have a problem with people that don't use turn signal indicators. The lever is literally an inch or two away from where their hand already is. The degeneracy of choosing not to use it is immeasurable.
---
inb4 more mining little tiny asteroids in a pocket where ventures get 1shot for ores that yield handfuls of minerals to make boosters you need 100s of the mineral to make.
---
quick questoin . If the issue is that cap superiority  arrives via cyno , why don't we fix the issue that causes it like, WH exits only spawn on nullsec/ls border systems . Now people can't rageroll holes to bypass defenses that would normally be done by subcaps ( IE gatecamping ) and there would be no need to use a cap umbrella ( cause gate camps can stop roamers and provide fights ) so then you don't need ships sitting with you on grid pveing  with a cyno ?
---
Nobody said they didn't want any PVP. I just said I dislike one specific type of PVP play style. 
---
It's also worth pointing out that CCP have made two massive areas within the game where supers can't enter, and where capital *drops* are impossible. So claiming they have done nothing to provide people who don't want to engage in such game play is just flat out wrong.
---
Remember, there is nothing that says you *have to* go roaming in null-sec. If you legitimately just want a subcap fight, why not rage roll into wormholes instead of nullsec? Or go wage ware in high-sec, where capital usage is a literal impossibility.
---
You are choosing to play this way. CCP has given you other options.
---
no missions 
---
no citadels 
---
ship down
---
plex only

He was in Brave space the other night looking for a fight. Source: saw him in our space.

Said by a person on a Sub that called for the extermination of the Chinese, pot meet kettle.
---
Said the sub that had a person call for the extermination of the Chinese? Really? You have no right to talk.
---
Guess that makes your racism okay then?
---
Hull tanked brutix with scram and mjd will put out DPs, and still give you options. Navi issue is just a beast of ehp.
---
Said this trash sub that called for the extermination of the Chinese.
---
Is that you're sub is full of racist scum?
---
Racist asshole.
---
Legacy and Imperium can/should break their NIP. Don't blame it on "the Chinese".
---
All things being considered, those are some light losses for inner hell.
---
Maybe don't be racist scum.
---
i'm not into FW so it's news to me. Is ppl running missions in FW corps a bad thing?
---
wh gas

Salt.

You know what I do with my ISK? I spend it on ships (also sometimes skill injectors). So if I had less ISK but more ships, I wouldn't complain.
---
BEST READ OF THE YEAR - CANKOU XIAOXI
---
The chinese that came here before were the ones who found the situation on singularity unbearable. Now the group that caused the serenity situation have moved over.
---
I get the sentiment but the LP gained from novice and small plexs is fairly minor. And in a highly contested system you will get a lot of fun but you will not break even with you isk spent. 
---
Mission running pays the bills and then some, which is good if it results in the runner spending more time pvping.
---
Issue with all things in EvE most the mission runners don't end up PvPing, which is sad.
---
Did you ever think that, maybe, this game *should* die due to it's piss poor design compared to what exists presently now?
---
What search engine is this? Normal mode google, incognito mode google, duckduckgo - all of those show official EVE site as 1st result for me.
---
Huh, I thought it might have been in Detorid and the lightning was something related to the “dead storms” the region’s description talks about.

Do you mean to say there wouldn't be fights over systems unless the invaders actually wanted the system? Great!
---
I second u/XeBrr’s request.

i used to run incursions with the russians. that was some of the scuttle butt i picked up. people started using chatlogs and whatever to dox each other totalitarian gov style, and rumor was that had spilled over into the actual owner of the sever getting heat from the chinese gov. cus u know how nerds talk shit about anything when they are in their little cliques and feel safe... they had coded language and everything to get away with it.  but yea all i know is some time later serenity got notice of officially shut down, or losing support or something, and then Eve as a whole got sold to a korean company... a big hmmmm from me... but that's enough tinfoil hat for now i guess

I dunno

Are you Alpha or Omega?
---
If alpha, you're stuck using a Venture to mine. A Venture is good for gas harvesting, but abysmal for anything else. You should get better isk/hr using a frigate to run missions in highsec. (I haven't done either in a long time, so please let me know if your data shows otherwise.)
---
If omega, highsec ice mining is ok-ish, and I think has a lower cost of entry than gas harvesting does. No beginner mining is going to be good isk profit compared to other things you could be doing though.

Its from a cyno/jump animation.

There's a whole world outside of the Anglosphere. Soar above The White Cliffs of Dover, across the Channel Sea and discover lands numerous and rich with culture and over *two-hundred* languages waiting to be discovered—spoken by millions!

I've fought Jita Holding Inc before. They're a handful of Chinese players who don't know their head from their ass.

damm, is ccp ever made a "buyback isk program" thing i whulde sell all my spare isk to them for that price (7-800B) and pay 1 years rent for my appartment
---
I wish you were wrong...
---
Honestly i dont really understand all the complaining etc at the moment, game is pretty great imo, the thing holding it back is all the complaining

The supply of LP injected into the system is mostly from the missions.  If there are no missions, the value of the LP will increase.
---
Nah, talking bout the beebois. Had been dicking around with the LP there for a long time, shifting around the warzone every few months, not that i've been keeping tabs on it in the past ~4 years. maybe they grew tired of it.
---
Yeah.  Back in the day people didn't do that, they just used a solo bomber.  Account has 3 character slots, so you got your main and then a bomber in each of two opposing militias.  Year round farm with one account was attractive at the time.
---
Calculate 10-20mil a tick, 3 ticks an hour, 4-8hrs of ratting a day, and how many days in a month. 
---
At 15mil ticks for 8hrs a day, thats 3.6bil a month.
---
18mil ticks at 12hrs a day is 6.5~bil a month.
---
Just make a basic algebra formula and you can guess.
---
If you're an alpha i wanna say its more efficient to mine with a battleship IIRC
---
&gt;How the fuck do you know they didn't buy the plex from CCP
---
That's exactly what I'm implying, friendo

I think there are exactly 3 items worth anything. And they drop once in a blue moon. Datas arent worth running at all.

I meant to reply to the other guy sorry dude.

optimal outcome tbh

Look for Condensed / Dense Veldspar in ansteroid belts and sell it.

My fav for sure. Loki does good work too if you’re smart about what you engage

Mission runners aren't content, just crabs. No value to anyone.

Ofcourse pirat did alpha nados. The hard counter is sneaky petes that pirat cant probe or boosh rail nagas.

Maybe next time inner hell will boosh them apart.

The nature of the event makes you feel you kinda have to. That is my main gripe.

Old style events were the best with accelerators that dropped directly

If you loot the field you'd cover your losses...how does this take hours? You're defending your home so your replacement ships are right there....who can't afford 20 raxes? There's month old newbros that can spare 20 raxes...Sound like more excuses to me.....
---
Lol!
---
CCP's only response will be to release a commemorative skin for all Amarr/Minmatar ships, which can be yours for 695 plex.

The point apparently keeps flying so far above head that it has achieved orbit around the planet all the while managing to turn the wording of a simple if exaggerated comparison into an ad hominem. Well done. But considering this is the EVE Reddit I'm not sure what else I should've been expecting.

Ah yes the great YouTube forums

Strongly agree! They should have no tether and no timer. Why should an un-maintained structure have any benefit.

Here's my stupid question of the week.
---
Say I want to buy 10'000 of something and the sell orders are say, 500, 1000, 500, 20000, etc. Right now I'm clicking buy on the first one, buying 500 then clicking buy on the second and so on and so forth. Is there a way to just say "buy the cheapest 10'000" in one go, without using a buy order and paying the broker fees? Cheers!
---
I wish you good luck in your life sir.
---
Nicely done.
---
He is. They me had dev time set aside for it anyways.
---
The hilarious thing is that there was a Guristas Outpost 1j from Jita. 
---
Saw several (player) frigate wrecks in the belts, who got roflstomped by the diamond rats.
---
Way longer than that
---
...obviously not. If you want to lock your super pilots out from keepstars, you could just remove them from docking access, instead of going through a needlessly risky asset transfer with a hostile coalition. 
---
Not to mention that POSes will still exist, supers can still tether up on smaller citadels, whatever.
---
If you know what a shit fit is then surely you can rub those brain cells together and figure out a good fit.
---
It just allows the same number of humans more power. Bad for casuals sure, bad for game? Why?
---
lol, forum indeed
---
And then CCP panics when krabs unsub and add local to wh
---
hold up, 25m ticks in a carrier, ive been carrier ratting for less then a week w t1 fighters and im still getting 35m minimums. Granted when i ran 5 smartbombers i got 100m ticks that was still split between the 5 so it was 20m basically.
---
Good luck!
---
Will see how the kiddos are doing, but will try to attend. Excited to meet some of you/

I like the initiative here. Just one thing. This is not the equivalent of pulling Keepstars to fight Supercapital proliferation, simply because Null Sec groups like their Titans and Super Carriers. Dropping SOV and moving to NPC space to protest against Fozzie SOV is a better comparison.
