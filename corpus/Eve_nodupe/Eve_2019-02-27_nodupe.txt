remove local. problem fixed. 
---
---
---
Those numbers from 2014 to now are likely alts of alts of alts. üòÜ
---
wow, that game is still alive?
---
you'll just see more people fitting cynos and more umbrellas get created and more standing response fleets, removing local is not a cure all for what ails Eve.
---
Yeah where you getting that from? Maybe more alts online. Because the current numbers surely aren't indicative of actual people with most of null sec multiboxing rorq blobs
---
Yeah I spent 20 minutes trying to hand out ships for a fleet this morning. Extreme input delay, long black screens, etc. 2nd time in the last 2 weeks it‚Äôs happened.
---
You cant deny that Skyrim is a classic at least, Fallout 3? and Fallout: New Vegas was their prime imo.
---

---
I tried a little bit of Fallout 4 and that was a little rough because of the "crafting". I can only imagine what monstrosity Fallout 76 is.
---
eve players are dumb, slow and old. the only reason why the above mentioned things are effective is because people get a 5 minute prewarn wallhack that does not rely on human coms.  
---
Have an upvote.
---
Depends what you think I mean by what I said.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yeah I was doing with puller alts for burner missions. 3 pullers ads billions per month and with extracting I could add another billion to that and offset the plexing cost. If I had cared to I could have made a second runner account and kept making puller accounts but that‚Äôs too much effort for me. 
---
Injectors caused so many problems with this game. 
---
I guess you're forgetting intel channels? There's plenty of people out roaming through delve looking to kill hunters and they report just as much if not more than local does. And cynos work just as well with no warning as they do with a warning, a back up fleet is a click away regardless of the warning time.
---
Yeah who wouldnt want to get what amounts to a teabag by blobbing daytrippers that you cant even roll into and get any semblance of revenge.
---
I wish. Even if they have finally realized it, its too late for them to now make huge sweeping changes, they no longer have the ability even if they wanted to and committed $$$$$ to it.
---
And it would kill them on financial end cause of the sheer amount of accounts lost upon realization that they have switched directions. So they are trapped between a rock and a hard place financially.
---
Either continue to cater to current playerbase and continue support for multi account whales, or switch and get rid of that support. Also, the forementioned whales drive many players that do come into the game and try it out for some time quit due to sheer disgust of this situation as a whole. The 2 can not co-exist. So die a slow death as the whales slowly evaporate while driving away new blood, or die a quick death resulting from knee jerk reactions of quitting whales but before there is enough new blood to sustain the business.
---
How about INIT? Those guys just don‚Äôt even try to hide it with names like
---
 ‚Äúghld 9ks3‚Äù
---
So you are saying I should stockpile these in advance.
---
If you're implying that the PLEX people would spend to direct inject skills comes from anywhere other than the market I think you'll be wrong. If what you said is unclear, it's on you. The job of the reader is not to guess what you meant.
---
Pretty much sums it up
---
&gt;There's plenty of people out roaming through delve looking to kill hunters and they report just as much if not more than local does.
---
what do you think is the predominant tool those hunters/spotters use to acquire information?  
---
Jump Clone?
---
Just get an alt in an instaaligning interceptor and fly them out in bulk...you can only train one at a time, and after a certain point you have months and months to grab your next books.
---
Imagine being this out of touch with EVE tradition.
---
Are you surprised that devs stay out of Reddit now days given how toxic this cesspit has become lately?

  No wonder why they focus on their official forums.

If you're in horde, PM me
---
Yes it would come from the market, and less of it on there is good. 
---
Well let's see, their own eyes, dscan, ship/pod losses on Dotlan, zkill if the person they are chasing was nice enough to add the ESI to the site for up to date kill postings, people who got killed previously by the hunter who know where they were and what they were in, other hunters, intel channels. Local is not the only way to keep track of people it's just the easiest.
---
Karmafleet is also pretty newbie friendly. We finally got our website working again, hurray!

https://karmafleet.org

We have an ingame channel, Public Karma, as well if you wanna just chit chat with some of us.
---
Brand Newbros is the TEST alliance newbie friendly Corp, worth checking out too, but I don't have their info.
---
Remember, you can always hop ship if you don't feel like the Corp fits your needs or playstyle. Lots of corps out there and hoping around a little til you find the right one is totally fine.
---
Good luck! 
---
Great post.
---
&gt;This isn't a Goon-instigated problem or a pubbie-instigated problem. It benefits CCP Games to make you think the Imperium is abusing the Rorqual balance issue when any common-sense gamer would get a Rorqual and print ISK.
---
Yep, and many PVP-focused players have long supported their welping by putting mining/ratting alts in goons.  Unless you're heavily into wormholes, regularly buy plex, or have a more niche isk-making venture, it makes a lot of sense.
---
Yeah so you do fundamentally misunderstand how markets work
---
more demand for plex
---
higher plex prices
---
more people buy plex to sell for isk
---
Thanks for posting this - I hadn't had a chance to read it yet. 
---
Even pooling together every resource that exists in the entire game won't be enough to build it. The ISK isn't the problem, it's the materials needed.
---
So can I still make another 300 bill off skills?
---
hey you got it!.
---
PLEX prices should be way higher than they are now. 
---
Trade in Perimeter. Buy whatever modules/drones/ammo goons/test/init use on their doctrines these days at 25% of their value. Sell at Jita market price. Profit.
---
Faster dscan of green sites when hunting?
---
Alliance logos coming to ships near you.
---
If that was your initial point, then you're a very ineffective communicator. 
---
My dude, i would like to introduce you to ctrl+click.
---
Set your cone at 5 degrees, ctrl+click an anomaly. Visually it wont track the anomaly but it will dscan in that direction. Congratz you can now hunt 500% more efficient.
---
No you just inferred i didn't understand how markets work (and likely assumed I wanted cheaper PLEX). That is on you. What I said is 100% accurate. Less PLEX on market is good.
---
It's a fun little thing. 
---
Also, just use a bait paladin on a C3. They'll swarm to you and you can shwack 'em. Of theres too many, sacrafice your best friend in a Gila as you make your escape.
---
Work in software.  One of the understanding marketing guys actually made a comic for our biggest product with the caption "You'll get it when we're good and ready!"  It never got to the field, of course.
---
But really, captures a lot of what should happen in software, but doesn't.
---
No.

Salvage behind a carrier wish I had done that earlier.  In low sec go clone hunting belt ratting 
---
Skyrim may be a classic but very much in spite of itself, as a game on a functional level it's bloody awful. Kinda like Eve.
---
Seems we have a type.
---
No, but it's not worth fighting you about it. A reasonable reader would have assumed you meant exactly what you said, not what you think you implied.
---
Ah yeah, the crucial skill gap between those who can click five or six buttons one at a time versus those who who can.
---
Really? The attribute system doesn't require talent. It doesn't provide entertainment, it in itself is bland and boring 
---
EvE 2019 - Game of "who you called"
---
did like, a palatine keepstar worth of PI drop? or at least a keepstar worth? is this the downfall of yodik?
---
Yeah...
---
This is pretty much the reason Im close to unsubbing. When I started playing EVE a couple of years ago I felt hesitant to spend much time on such an old MMO, fearing this exact kind of end was already starting to take place. It seems those fears were validated 100%. EVE has become diseased stillwater. 
---
Incel veterens with 15 accounts will be milked for all they are worth and EVE finally laid to rest. What a depressing end to such an iconic game.
---
Evernus .. it enables you to also manage your iterations on buy orders etc. It sucks on the sync via ESI rates (tbf ESI isn't always stable either). It however can read your market logs directly..so it helps manage the burden of station trading via some tooling.
---
No tool really gives you the "insta profit win" formula... there's a lot to do with speculation and stock movements, like for instance when Jita burn is on your stock tends to go for a higher return given logistic traffic in/out is unlikely..but at the same time stock also doesn't leave at this time either...so you have to somewhat hedge your bets on supply/demand ratios in different regions and consumption rates.
---
The attribute system isn't even complex, it's just dull and needs to go.
---
Nothing of value dropped
---
You mean dumb bots that just sit there when neuts turn up in local... Why would ppl user those over the current bots? Also more passive income is bad no matter the mechanics
---
aw. I was hoping all of the supposed PI dropped. :-(
---
Thx for your answer! What‚Äôs the best way to contact CCP regarding moving one ship for free? Is this actually a service they provide regularly or just for some if they ask real nicely? 
---
And /r/eve said the Hedliner SOTA was too verbose. Good lord.
---
Thx! So the asset safety wraps containing my assets open when I pay 10% of it‚Äòs Value? Where do they get the ISK value from?
---
"Enjoyment" != "Healthiness"
---
Unbalanced games can be quite enjoyable, sometimes because of said lack of balance. And imbalance is just one manifestation/symptom of lack of health in a game. 
---
I think the best piece of advice is the early simple advice given to me, and that's to not limit yourself to one market. Jita is actually a great place to start, but pay attention to market behavior buys and sells across multiple markets and you'll see more profit. You'd make more money ratting in Delve (lol) but you'll feel far less... filthy on the market.
---
So, how much you lost in the ship they killed, i can smell the anger all the way to Norway.
---
I did mean exactly what I said. Its good. Maybe you don't understand markets.
---
My first faction warfare kill was a friendly militia member thanks to the default overview. Good times.
---
Most of the people responsible for the better changes to happen over the past few years *no longer with CCP after a string of layoffs, firings, and people  moving on*. It isn't the same company now, which is now has a sugar-daddy. 
---
Hilmar has begun parting out EVE to a shitty publisher to fund CCPs next ambitious failure breaking into a different market.
---
You mean the carriers that assigned fighters to a vni while it sat in a pos completely 100% unkillable. Then yes.
---
lol sorry but Overwatch was never anything to me but a TF2 rip-off, the beginning of Blizzard's slide into clueless, greedy game studio hell. 
---
any goon that actually took that seriously is a smoothbrain tbh
---
I‚Äôve got mine running in lightsail. But you‚Äôll need at least 1gb of ram. 
---
I'm sure PL would post image macros... stop that.
---
Ive been considering blowing my wad of ships and gear soloing and unsubbing honestly. As a relatively newer player of 3 years or so, it was somewhat difficult to feel like I should invest too much time into such an old MMO when this path is how most of them eventually flame out. That fear is being validated at this point while EVE becomes a stagnant pool of nolife nullbears with unassailable in-game wealth to be milked at the EVE store, milked by CCP until EVE is sold off for scrap. 
---
Monoclegate has returned in full force. Problem is there arn't that many people who give a shit anymore, including CCP. There is no more passion left at that company. 
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203207992-Inaccessible-Assets-and-Returning-players
---
I did come up with the idea while taking a shit so it could just be a terrible idea. They wouldn‚Äôt be all that dumb, they would warp off but not instantly. I agree that I can‚Äôt really see a way to make that intriguing without making it worse than botting. 
---
An improvement to existing structures that does nothing to fix EVEs actual long standing problems
---
Either go back to highsec, or find a nullsec group to join that accepts miners, all you're going to do in lowsec is give a pirate group a couple of nice killmails.
---
I was hoping for more drama but this is actually a reasonable change.
---
Triple boxing subcaps is pretty ineffective in pvp. Let alone having to swap into the combat ships in space. It's way easier to have your fleet higs rigged and aligned out and just squad warp if anyone tries to tackle you.
---
Good question. The "CCP value" of an item is usually somewhat lower than market value of the same item. While I don't believe that the exact formula has been made public, it is derived from the value of the basic materials that are needed to manufacture the item (mineral value for T1 stuff) with some exceptions for special items that cannot be manufactured by players.
---
So you know what it means but decide to misspell it anyway?
---
lol why would the Council of Goon Management give a shit about FW
---
That's the fun part of video games, sucking at it and learning how to achieve.  The accomplishment is where the real fun is.   
---
not my proudest fap
---
They're already monetizing bittervets by not giving a shit about anything other than squeezing every last Dollar from them now before tossing EVEs withered corpse into a dumpster
---
&gt; The fattened pigs, inseminated by greed, truffle through the rich asteroids, haunted by hate and corruption.  
---
lolol very nice
---
Even then, it's just textures, and the polygons don't even look complicated.
---
As I said. There are a million and one things to do in EVE. It‚Äôs only logical that the most basic mechanics should be easy to use. 
---
If you claim that EVE is easy. I suggest you to try some incursions/FOB‚Äôs/wormhole escalations. That‚Äôs some serious shit that is not easy to learn. Especially on your own
---
Woosh
---
Firstly you think Near2 is a botting program that only Goons use and now you think that GSF directorate gives a shit or even would be aware of someone petitioning a blue for botting.
---
I guess Horde propaganda is on point these days.
---
Heck I'd be happy if they added the new overview for cynos/new ships/new deployables etc enabled by default as they are released.....
---
" This new system will make sure that the old core mechanics of seeding and **injection** remain in place "
---
No, just no.
---
I find that when I do that:
---
A)  I missed a prerequisite book.    
---
B)  Forgot about another book I wanted.    
---
C)  Purchased the wrong book.    
---
D)  Already have it injected, but not trained, and didn't notice.    
---
I train skills as I use them.  That's when I need the missing skill book immediately.
---
that's the first time I've seen someone use the phrase "some people in delve are bots" usually the posts start out something like "all goons bot, delve is cancer, ban all goons bla bla bla..."  
---
Lol. The whole "all of null is like 10 guys boxing armies of rorqs" thing had really gotten out of hand. Like, people actually believe that the average nullsecer has no fewer than half a dozen rorqs alts eating rocks 23/7.
---
Lol.
---
they'd probably have more success if they stopped feeding T3C's and redeemers to diamond rats in NPC null.
---
I smell bacon...
---
Best post I've read all day.
---
I highly doubt that capital ships are part of the "core skills"
---
oh look someone got downvoted for a shit post better accuse the imperium of brigading.
---
they are. as of right now all seeded npc market skillbooks are included which means cap skills too
---
This is stated where?
---
Same answer as other inexplicable phenomena:  magnets.
---
don't worry the ~~winter update~~ ~~I mean spring-summer~~ I mean soon to be winter 2020 update releasing the 64 bit client should solve all these problems.
---
There's no evidence that they ever actually hired a balance team.
---
I think you could make a very interesting and unique RTS (Though I think there is also something to be said for a Total War style hybrid RTS/turn-based system) based on Eve and it's mechanics. Sins is a fantastic game but there is no reason why it should be the last or only space combat RTS.  
---
  
---
Of course CCP will never create that game because it's not #innovative enough. It wouldn't have enough... 'pssshhhhhhh'
---
read the article lmao
---
Think of the poor families that survive through the sale of pitchforks!
---
At this point, wouldn't mimicking intelligent AI/bots/robotics be how power blocks would really work in the distant future?
---
I was playing in 2009 and peopel then were like CCP don't care; game is fucked. Don't worry too much. EVE is an amazing beast to tame, but like most MMo's once you tame it, it's glory fades a bit. EVE just takes like 5+ years to tame
---
Nice try, but still some unimportant shit compare to what we really want, ship balance and structure mechanics
---
Every dude in my corp has like 5 minimum sadly. I listen to them on comms happily mining and NOT wanting to o any pvp. Or dude has 17. I have zero. So it's really not out hand it's pretty accurate. When I can roam nullsec and dscan in populat d systems and 80% of the results is rorquals and VNI's id say it's pretty accurate. But what do I know. I'm a 14+ yeah player who pays attention to the meta 
---
I never got bored of small gang PVP and when I was in a WH group that fought I loved the game. ISsue was my corps kept dying for one reason or another or saturated themselves with PVE money grubbers.
---
Maybe I should rejoin amd go to Brave if they still around...
---
I did, but I don't read the part that excludes the rare skills as necessarily including ALL school skills as core skills. So I see that as possible, but not as a given.
---
The part is the following:
---
The largest part of this change is the fact that all core skills will now be purchasable directly from the character sheet for ISK. Rare skills that are not seeded on the market and are only available through the completion of in game content will not be available, but the skill sheet will provide a market link for them.
---
Can this be used with 16 rorquals and a super? My friend wants to know.
---
Yea i agree, i came to the conclusion that perhaps ccp did this a long time ago but realized that to remove the botters would crash the game's population and economy so hard as to basically be unrecoverable without extensive CCP intervention so they chose the lesser evil and let it persist while keeping appearances up until they can fix it.
---
now that's just embarassing

Yea the warden system they use is probably the most sophisticated.  By now it is multi faceted and well beyond anything off the shelf.
---
It doesn't help that Autohotkey now has a really powerful AI vision system that works in the single digit ms range on QHD+ pixel buffers.
---
Wow. An anecdote like that MUST accurately represent the entirety of the thousands of systems and hundreds of corps in nullsec. Boy was I ever wrong!
---
Well the Upwell Palatine Keepstar Project did have the biggest EVE accomplishment of worst words to isk ratio scam.
---
Yea they have (had?) a hilarious problem with the community trade website and bots with premium access manipulating prices too haha.
---
Doubtful
---
Yea, I s'pose you got a point about how rampant it still is. If it were policed better people might try a little harder to cover it up but right now why bother, you can get away with it in plain sight. 
---
I probably should have included that I meant little Jonny Rocket is someone deep down the chain of exchanging hands between alts and building this super out of laundered materials, little Jonny is totally oblivious to the fact that this is a dirty dirty super. While it doesn't change the situation, and I personally understand that in real life the same would happen if you got ahold of a large sum of stolen money, this would probably seriously ruin little Jonny's game experience. The truth of the matter is CCPA is trying to prevent the whales from being scared off so they can squeeze out all that cash, taking little Jonny's super might lead to some canceled subs.
---
But hey that's all just a hypothetical right

there is a difference between continuous rolling (for content or correct static) and rolling off to bear in home. The former requires cap sustain that will depend on how fast your scanner flings you to a new hole - eg. astero vs. virtue pod tengu scan speed. In that case, it is much preferred to not use a dread. For the latter usage you can literally slap on any dread (like your bear nag) a 2500mm plate, 50000mn, 10000mn, cloak, stabs, 2 capital batteries and be good to go. 
---
for a dirt cheap dedicated roller I would pick the moros. https://i.gyazo.com/715c94cee01448ca59aa807d6047d483.png
---
As mentioned, depending on how fast you roll, you can add or reduce the amount of cap mods. Also, there is a sweet spot of align time where you can enter warp in one cycle of a 500mn which can also help reduce cap usage as well as roll speed.
---
if you want a dedicated cap roller, this is probably the best budget method. https://i.gyazo.com/2175a8ff2f00f8669f37fb7e55353a9f.png modify for cap usage as needed.
---
Yeah. It's really mods that give Skyrim what it needs to stay in the limelight. The same can be said of Morrowind, but that game could stand by itself as an RPG where Skyrim cannot. The former is outdated, yeah, but the latter was just fundamentally broken upon release if you attempt to view it as the RPG that Bethesda advertised it as.
---
I miss the old days of EVE, and I miss getting into Morrowind for the first time. It could just be that those games had a greater impact on me then, as a child, than games have now.. but eh, they don't just make them like they used to.
---
Actually my time is spent more on pvp than pve these days.
---
It's okay. I mean if you don't pay attention to the environment you operate in as well as others it happens. Ido have friends in several alliances and  we do talk frequently. Because we all started together. And we all have the same stories. Spread across all the nullsec blocs...I think it's a pretty accurate evaluation. Just look at the Plex prices touching 2 bil for 40 days. Inflation is indicative symptom of the reality. But you can shit post me if you will feel better and chose to think everything is fine.
---
Thanks for noticing!
---
I mean carriers that just afked with 8 geckos and made dank ticks.
---
Wait, Init was in Curse? I barely noticed, I thought they were coming through wormholes or something. 
---
How's Chinese you for you?
---
There are many ways that the default overview is inadequate. Evidence of this is the fact that one of the first things a pilot is told when he joins a corp, or has to work together with other players in some capacity, is to install a 3rd party overview package. 
---
The overview is the primary interface by which a pilot establishes situational awareness. EVE is a PvP game and it is therefore fundamental be able to see other players' **ships** clearly. The default overview fails at even this basic function. The default overview does not have a tab that shows only ships, neither is there a tab that shows only non-friendly ships. 
---
All the default tabs are cluttered up with a bunch of other objects in space that get in the way and prevent you from seeing what's happening around you until a ship is right next to you. And because there's no filter for ships, dscan's purpose is also rendered opaque.
---
A good overview will have a tab for *all ships*, a tab for *non-friendly* ships, a tab for *non-friendly drones*, a tab for *travel*, and a tab for *PvE*. It will also have a number of other predefined filters for specific tasks that can be loaded into new tabs, such as mining, ratting/missioning, exploration, viewing structures, and viewing everything. It will also have filters specifically made for dscanning so you can easily see what is in nearby offgrid space.
---
Those were two separate thoughts, hence the period instead of a comma.
---
Will we get some free skill points because we wasted crazy amount of ISK on some weird hipster skill book ?

You forgot the 61 ranger regiment Ishtars batphoned by tri. Triumvirate provoked this, batphoning for every timers, not undocking unless in blob  they were 300 for the armor timer of our forti with over 50 dreads... I personally distaste flying with goons for various reasons but they can bring the numbers... In the end our fortizar is saved, and trium's one is dead. 
---
You're off your rocker if you think that the average line member in all of the nullsec blocs is rocking several rorq alts.
---
Imagine if CCP reset Eve; Eve - Classic.

A mwd + inertial stab also works for a 10s getaway

All this proves is the anti-vax movement is working

nice thought experiment. i'd play it if it was an exodus, rmr or revelations 1/2 patch...

Have you heard about the "Gobbloons?" The propaganda is so thick they have a currency named after their leader
---
There are no bots or EULA breaches in Delve. Fake News. :D

It seems to be a trend recently... I would love a classic version of eve w/o all this garbage.
---
That sounds like the kind of understanding we dont allow 'round these parts. We dont like your kind. 
---
Hey my friends are all in the Imperium and only a few have a slew of mining alts. I guess my anectdotal evidence contradicts yours and is therefore more valid!
---
No, LS will remain dead
---
You take the initiative to do your deployment, indepenpantly of Goons ( for the moment), that's a good point.
---
The wrong point is you have overestimated your alliance, or have underestimated ours. 
---
tip #1 is: dont jump to d-w beacon
---
no the wrong point is that it sounds like a mentally challenged pig in his first d&amp;d campaign wrote this embarassing garbage. Also i'm not in init.
---
Only 7 jumps? Try having to find a viable way out of your chain then doing X number of jumps to the nearest seller once you're in K -Space just because you forgot to buy a certain skillbook last time you were out there...
---
I... kinda like it?
---
Yes, but inclusion of two sentences in the same paragraph implies that the two separate thoughts are directly related, especially if one follows the other.

Separation into separate paragraphs (by pressing enter twice) makes it clear when two thoughts are distinct and not directly related... Though sharp readers will notice that this paragraph is actually directly related to the previous paragraph.

Hi all,

To be totally fair, there is a difference between tackling rorqs and jetting around looking for a fight, or even tackling other ships.
---
"Underestimated your alliance?" lol Mate anyone from even the outside, like myself, can see INIT. is facing a united Panfam of NC., PL, and Horde who for the first time are trying to cooperate on a level similar to the Imperium. If all they do is guerilla warfare and trolling, that shouldn't be a surprise to you. 
---
I'd just assume they canned, failed to hold onto, or retasked whoever was in charge of maintaining it like they do with everything else.

Alright, cringe time.

---
Yeah I'm getting ready to try the hobokrab run but don't have all three caps ready yet, so starting in an empty C5 and getting used to it is the goal, which would mean rolling.
---
So the 500MN is to align to warp, the 50000 to come back hot and reduce mass, the 10000 to burn back but not risk rolling yourself out. Is that right?

i also empathize with little johnny, but honestly once he has the taste of RMT and his mother's cc, he isn't going to stop unless someone hits him over the head with the ban hammer.

And if you were insulating that you didn't want to follow the isk chain all the way down, then yea i'd agree.  punish the direct buyers but not every single party that received a single dirty isk.  you'd still get a lot of pilots caught up, but we could use the drastic measures right now to combat the plague of botting.

Does it really need to make sense? Its a game system not an RP conduit.
---
people are already complaining about the Player count being lower now than any time in the last 10 years, if this were to happen " Disallow PLEX from providing Omega Status. " subscription numbers would fall off a cliff. CCP would be much better off actually putting time, money and people into solving the bot issue then screwing the entire legit playerbase by removing plex as a way to pay to play.
---
What if i told you sub numbers are only where they are because of bots buy cheap as fuck (to them) PLEX.  
---
If CCP hunts bots, their PCU dies. If they remove PLEX the PCU dies.

I know I would instantly quit the game no questions asked if I had to either fork over hundreds every month to play or delete most of my accounts, and that many people I know would as well. 
---
This reduces the need to travel to a system in search for skillbooks due to local supply.
---
For new players, learning to play the game is about undocking, exploring, getting ganked, reshipping, getting lost, distracted and finding your way again.
---
I see this change as making one of the main reasons for undocking a choice or shortcut.
---
Having said that though, for alts, it could make the core skills in SP farming easier to get.
---
I see this as a move to pay to win. It isn't doing the newbros any favours and directed only to appease short attention spans.

Thats a shame. Enjoy mining online then!

RMT $ per 1 Billion isk was once around 70% to 75% vs plex. So buy buying RMT isk you would get around 25% to 30% more.
---
However now that isk can be botted super easily with very little chance of being caught, or caught within a reasonable amount of time, isk can be sold very cheaply vs the cost of plex.
---
You cannot nuke plex to solve the issue, that is a non starter.

As much as I disliked the ban of broadcasting as it "inconvenienced" me... I could understand why ccp did what they did. Only a few really took multi-boxing to the extreme solo bombing wings. It was an art in itself but, 1 man in 70+ bombers is just game crippling tbh...

---
I've heard of them but no idea what they are or how to find them, care to explain?
---
No they couldn't, because then you still have bot miners, bot plexers, still generating more ISK than average players, selling it for less than the rate CCP sets, buying PLEX at a market rate much less then they rake in...
---
Only way to kill bots is to kill their free access to the game. Period. 
---
There is no way in hell a sustained average of 35K people go from generating 30T Isk in rat bounties to 80T in rat bounties in 4 years, without botting being insanely dominant in this game.
---
Haha thanks, and thanks but I'm already in a corp just don't chat alot (still new) (and our corp may have had a couple run ins with PH ;). )

Pretty much, I'm Strayin, correct spelling isn't exactly needed or used

A huge amount of players would quit if you killed plexing...
---
So lets say that 40% plex accounts vs paying with RL bucks. 30% leave in protest. You now have 30% less PCU numbers.. What do now?
---
That I did not, I E just always used ECT, thankyou for correcting me
---
He's saying that's how it should be.
---
It was always presented as being a long road. Would you have preferred CCP rush the feature out?
---
There's just no pleasing anyone. Features either takes too long or they're too rushed. Which do you want?
---
How long does a paid botting account take in hrs to pay for itself? 
---
The whole concept of F2P botting is not isk efficient long term.. You need to baseline botting numbers as an alpha vs a paid / plexed account. Run the margins with isk ratio per hour and deduct any investment costs / monthly costs to maintain the account. You will be surprised how little an alpha can make vs a Omega over time.. 
---
Mutually assured destruction is not a good position to take just to tackle bots.
---
Move on because the cancer in the game is gone. 
---
The PCU is only where it is at now because of botting anyway. Look at it over the last 2 years...its basically flat. No crazy influxes since Alpha clones, no crazy drop offs.  
---
Shit the historical summer drop barely registers. Cripes for like the last 6 months the peaks and valleys are almost identical.  
---
CCP would probably lose like 70% of its PCU.  
---
which is why they have ZERO intent to actually tackle bots.
---
Lately they've been fucking with skins after release, so they don't even seem to care about people buying skins anymore.

Interestingly the ship used at[ Vegas 2017](https://youtu.be/D5TA9_2FyZw?t=984) to show off the new visual effects was also the Vexor hull.

Also the Vexor hull is one of the more recent redesigns. 
---
I suspect it is a combination of the nice flat side, and the fact that the redesign happened when they could take such things into consideration is why the Vexor/Ishtar line is the experiment.

"Curse drones should get dumpstered really bad. Also no fit that i've seen can no-sweat tank a maxdps orthrus."

Maybe not no-sweat but some of the blingy curses do pretty well for themselves, like u/proxxq. Bonus points if they get ontop of you and launch/fire/return drones after a volley so you can barely get a lock off. Or if the pilot is counting your volleys and attacking during reload.
---
Ive only seen a Curse as Orthrus twice and was never able to live to the damage buff, but that might be able to do it if you can kite long enough (assuming AB fit curse). I could have beat the first one with better play, I suspect, but was still learning to fly them.

PCU hasn't risen in 4 years. PLEX has doubled in price.

Who do you think is buying it....

More importantly

What happened to the people selling it? (they already gone.)
---
The game was never made to be a casual mmo. You are trying to turn it into a casual mmo in order to gain more paying customers. Only you are failing at that and losing the hard-core players along the way.
---
What makes Eve truly unique is that the larger narrative of the game is written by players. There are no epic campaigns here except those we invent. That hasn't changed and this game is still very much what we put into it.
---
What is hurting the game more than anything is risk-averse game play. It results in uninteresting fights, massive inflation, and pressure on ccp to make that play style easier. 
---
Grrr bots. Let‚Äôs just forget the rampant AFK VNI farms, 360/ hour super ratting, boson ratting, all the things enables by having a dumb 10 year old pve system. 0.0 ratting is the largest Isk fountain because it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt hold up well in today‚Äôs eve, mining and ded space sites don‚Äôt contribute anywhere close to the same Isk.
---
10s is too long if they're landing on grid.... and you don't want to dock up everytime someone enters local as that hurts your isk/hr
---
He said if you gave him isk he‚Äôd use it to build a palatine keepstar. Instead he just moonwalked away with all of it
---
almost everything I have heard recommended to make it "harder" for bots would have made it much harder and even more un-enjoyable for for actual humans to do the same thing. Remember the more miserable you make PVE for real people to play the game the more willing they will be to try botting just to get away from the monotony of ratting and mining.
---
best idea ever!
---
the captcha ideas are a bad joke, there are already captcha solving bots and crowd sourcing captcha solving solution that would blow right past any measures CCP took to implement them all those things would do is piss all real human beings.

DEAR OP, WRONG.
---
You have literally no fucking clue how much you absolutely do not want unfinished/untested expansions ~~trash~~ being added into the game before it's ready. CCP used to do this all the time in ways that make any kind of bugs you get nowadays look like a wet fart in the background of past expansions represented by a fucking volcano exploding. We begged CCP to stop doing this and to just take their time and release things when they were ready to be released, rather than at some arbitrary corporate date. And that's exactly what they're doing, and WE THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT CCP.
---
People in this subreddit seem to think it's super fly to go bashing on CCP for doing exactly what we asked them over the course of *years* to stop doing. They listened to us. These kinds of shit posts are just not OK.
---
You know you can go roam lowsec/null while in a big Corp, right? And just ask around standing fleet, and it‚Äôs easy to get a few people. 
---
Whereas if you try to join a smaller Corp you‚Äôll have times when no one is on, you won‚Äôt be able to go on the big fleets if you ever feel like doing that, and you don‚Äôt have as good of a source of income. 
---
I'm new to eve and I'm not really sure how to make money hauling to the point where I'd have the gear/skills needed to join something like redfrog or pushx. I've managed to get by with mining enough to get a mammoth and fit it out with no worries of losing the money I spent on it, but I'm not totally sure where to go from there
---
&gt;All that isk has to end up somewhere.  Once you find where the isk is going, just work your way back out to ban all the connected accounts.
---
They have talked about doing that for years, but without any real manpower behind the effort its never seemed to keep up with the problem.

That's a very interesting application. I'll add that to my list of software to monitor. Thanks!
---
I think MMOs in general are just trending downwards as we see a rise of MMO-lites (Division, Destiny, etc.) EVE will probably last another decade, at least. 
---
But for those who got to play while it was growing and expanding (2006-2014) it's just not the same game anymore. 
---
Give that man a venture.
---
&gt;mining and ded space sites don‚Äôt contribute anywhere close to the same Isk.
---
they come close, but the key difference is they don't directly provide ISK, they just provide you with something worth selling, someone else still has to give you the isk for you to make money in plexes or mining. Ratting on the other hand is basically an unlimited isk printing machine. Even a casual player running anoms for only 1-2 hours a day in a super can pull in 3.5 - 4+ billion a week. And the turbo nerds can pull 10 times that, and that's just normal people. The numbers bots can pull are fucking insane by comparison.
---
In summary, a 'plex problem requires a plex solution.
---
That's the dumbest shit you could have typed out.
---
Honestly, I usually use an astero, in the lows fit two reppers and to resist modules. you can out-tank the usual dps fit astero and if you scram-kite you can do surprisingly well against sabres, although you'll need a scram and web to make that work.
---
If you purely want to make ISK, look on the map for active players in space, and just generally avoid those systems and find those sections which are more empty. Watch out for pipe systems, they are often camped.

place NPC buy orders in a way which drive traffic into now dead regions

you can't be shocked at an in-kind response... you get what you put into it.

It's higher profitability at a much higher investment cost.  Rorquals aren't cheap, especially if you're fitting them to live if they get dropped on.  Not to mention the prohibitive prices of Excavator drones. Yes, it's good income once you make that initial investment, but it requires you to actually pay attention (or cheat) to keep yourself in the large profit margins, as you have to watch for rats landing on you or in the case of Delve right now, a cyno popping up next to you.
---

I've been doing abyssals for a bit, but the system I have been doing them in has been home to some baddies.  Is there a way to scan abyssal sites down?  I tried testing it myself and the abyssal trace did not appear on the probe scanners(combat and core).  Am I right in thinking that abyssal traces cannot be scanned down? Or did I do something wrong with my testing and I am just a juicy target when I come out of a scanned down abyssal?

The "right" way to play Eve has always been to just find a nullbob hide deep in their space and grind isk until the next maxxxbois CTA.  Now, instead of each person having 20 accounts out mining in Exhumers with an off grid boost, each person has 4-5 accounts mining with Rorquals.  Nothing has changed except more is being done with less characters.

2003 player. I once reprocessed indy'**s** worth of harvester drones because they were so common and such a pain to haul the minerals were worth more.
---
Few things to open this up a little
---
1: Whenever you're moving a Jump Freighter, especially with cargo. You'll want to have an exit cyno ready to light incase CODE or someone else comes to bump you. **Especially** if you're wardecced. In that case you shouldn't be moving a freighter at all but in a neutral corp. But. If he had that ready and lit, he could jump the JF out after uncloaking (after waiting out the session timer of the gate jump) before the garmur could lock him
---
2: The sadder thing is, if the garmur was webbing him, even if he went 25m/s he could have burnt back to the gate eventually, and the garmur pilot would have either had to de-aggress in time or the JF pilot could have jumped trough and perhaps warped to a safe station. Assuming the garmur guy didn't have backup.
---
Yep 5 whole billion, better pack up and head home.
---
Lol you should have just realized that nullsec wasn't for you, and went to another area of space like wormholes or lowsec.

This will be the same exact experience, stop trying to go to nullsec and try the other parts of the game 
---
I now have read poetry today. That's nice. I like that.

More ISK sinks like these. Please, do buy BPO's from NPC and carry them with you to dangerous space, or preferrably, buy BPO's and delete them in stations to save time.

Seriously though, we need more ISK sinks unless CCP will adjust bounties on NPC's.

---
Pathfinder is fast as fuck on a private server, don't run it on a potato
---
The difference is looking to kill defenseless things vs things that actually want to fight back. If I roll into your staging with a fleet and fuck around on your undock for 20 minutes, it's because I want you to form a fleet I can fight. If I bring a fleet of small fast shit and run around a pocket for 10 minutes and then leave, it's because I want to bleed your Krabs.
---
i think it's cute how SB wants to rid the alliance of the "pet" label they wear. I will give them credit (for now) cause I haven't seen the first Goon in this INIT blops/stuka mess they are trying to pull off...so I commend you, Sister Bliss, at your cringy, half assed attempt to inspire your little doobers. We still laugh at you, just not as much as we did last week. 
---
...and I give it another 9 days before I see goons in your fleets.
---
You know you can respond to a tackled rorqual with a subcap fleet, right?
---
Because tackling a rorqual is a strategic asset which paints your intentions as either killing it, baiting out other assets, or (way less likely) getting a good fight.
---
Sounds to me like you're taking propaganda wayyyy to personally thank you.
---
No TL;DR no read. If you cant take a well put together idea and condense it for me to read and see if you're full of bullshit or not, your idea is trash.
---
Wait, MCAV and who?
---
2 hours a day  x 7 days gets you around 3.5-4 bill depending on your luck with ticks. Turbo nerds get the added bonus of a lot more faction drops + more chances for escalations they can sell which is where you get the much higher return. 100 hours would be nuts, but I've encountered more than a few people since coming back to the game that are active upwards of 60 hours a week, and if they aren't in a pvp fleet they are out ratting.

In order.
---
* FLEX structures and cyno bridge replacements were released in November of 2018. 3 Months ago
---
* Abyssal space is nice. I actually do say its good content since its a 100% material sink whenever people lose stuff to drifters, but rather wish CCP would revitalize other things first. Missions, Epic Arcs, COSMOS missions, new anoms etc. The new ships are nice too, but aren't used all that much due to the price of them.
---
* Diamon rats are at certain locations.
---
- Asteroid belts (NPC Corp mining/response fleets)
---
- FOB's. Which very few are done due to incredibly lackluster rewards
---
- Sotyio's, again, not many will even see these or take part in them due to, well why would they? (Plus its better to grind them down with few supers).
---
No others come to my mind, feel free to fix me if I forgot some locations. But not present in missions, wormholes, anomalies etc.
---
* QoL Improvements. Yes, they are awesome. More of them, but again, Quality of Life. They aren't 1:1 good in say, when wormholes were introduced, or when T3D's were introduced for example.
---
* [Doesn't play the game?[(https://i.imgur.com/dMSQVMx.png)

People are mad at CCP since at least currently, they aren't the best at communication. For example. When the chat system broke, they should have been out at latest few weeks afterwards "Hey folks, we know we have these problems and this is why, and this is the expected ETA for it being fixed"
---
There is no future roadmap. Winter "Features" were moved to spring, or probably summer.
---
No Fanfest or AT either, first one is a massive hit to it since it did bring a certain shine to the game, something unique just for it. That and I was thinking of going for the first time this year, but guess not now.
---
Again, if CCP needs time to work on stuff, hey by all means. We all want them to release good, working products, but at least let the customerbase know whats going on and why. Now many are simply frustrated due to lack of communication from their part.
---
Trash post deleted in 3...

Imagine actually believing this 
---
Yeah. Rorquals die. Point is them dying is mostly about being lucky - you catch a retard that doesn‚Äôt know how to play eve, or you catch them while there‚Äôs some maxform STRATOP/CTA.
---
There is very little risk mining in most large nullsec alliances that have the capacity to utilize the retarded 7.5 minute PANIC mod in a timely fashion.
---
Also, 7 rorquals can chain panic 50+ subs mining a moon out completely, all the while then being *literally impossible* to kill.
---
You might like rorquals because it benefits you/your type of alliance (as it also benefits NC/P/GOTG), but this does not justify the issue of the mechanics surrounding them being retarded. 
---
He‚Äôd have ran out of rockets well before killing that thing solo.
---
Personally i mine with RORQ to build my 2x Nyx , 1 for pvp 1 for pve. It took forever but i'm building one of them now :))
---
Can't underestimate a group that doesnt log in.
---
Yeah I get it. Nothing wrong with mining or ppl that do it. Ore fuels the fires of EVE. 
---
Rorquals are just a badly designed mechanic, though. It‚Äôs disappointing to see that this isn‚Äôt being addressed either by CCP or CSM. 
---
Low level contract hauling tends to be on the side of "not worth it", at least not with the level of risk you'll have to take. A Mammoth tends to be relatively squishy, and if you had to work hard through mining in order to buy it you probably don't have the liquid isk to accept courier contracts that would actually give a good reward. Even then there's a fair chance you'll get shot at in Hisec just for your loot. At any rate, it's a long path between using your 1 million isk Mammoth to a 1 billion isk Freighter just to haul stuff around hisec. 
---
Have you done the career missions yet or Epic Arc? I'd recommend those first in order to build up some gameplay knowledge and isk. 
---
Where are you getting your inflation numbers?
---
I remember planing training queues so there was always a skill with enough time on it to run over night so I didn't have to get up.
---

---
So yeh thats roughly 280m an hour which seems accurate for super ratting. So to earn 10x that amount you would have to rat 10 times as much right? Or are you referring to multiboxing like 20 rorqs?
---
I always forget how much lower income is in nullsec compared to wormholes 
---
This has to be bait.
---
Can't tell if doesn't know about dust or just baiting

That would be amazing. Maybe we could even help by bombarding the planets from orbit.

How about actually investing in the game instead of milking it for their failed projects.

Hauling at the low levels is going to be mostly for personal use. T1 haulers are super duper squishy and get shot just at random sometimes because they can be killed so easy. 
---
You really don‚Äôt want to take much over 50 million at a time in one. This is going to make finding contracts to haul awfully difficult and very low income. 
---
You can help some income by hauling your own goods for industry, exploiting prices between regions, selling ammo and drones in mission running hubs or various supplies close to faction warfare systems. 
---
Hauling really becomes worth it when you get to a freighter or t2 hauler. And that‚Äôs when you are able to join red frog or pushx. Profits before that are going to be extremely slow going and honestly are still slow going even with a freighter. 
---
If it were important for the interface to be good, it would be. 
---
CCP could charge to, for example, have certain features added to the game. Would you object to that kind of monetization?

Just tries. Internal structure error. Fuck that site.
---
I'm gonna say it, I'm not really a big fan of any of the standard overview packs but I couldn't be assed to keep updating my custom overview every time CCP added a new ship
---
I really don't understand why CCP's never considered it a problem that every new ship is invisible until people add it to their overviews, why they wouldn't just add new ships to all overviews by default if they couldn't be assed to code one of the several simple heuristics, or god forbid actually give a fuck and do something intelligent like adding it selectively to overviews that select all ships or even cluster overview ship selections by frequency and manually specify the intuitive selection for the top 25 or so then default to enabled for the rest that have any ships at all selected
---
Does anyone else feel
---
Upset by the fact
---
Something like this
---
Totally never happened?
---
Yep me too. A single best developer knows how to do things that a dozen b-grade developers will never figure out, which is why they're worth the money.
---
The dozen b-grade developers might eventually get to a solution, but it won't be as optimal as possible in a variety of ways, it won't be as well polished or organized, and their solution techniques will frequently be reinvented where they shouldn't be. 
---
I dunno about you, but those problems sound remarkably like a certain games company I know about.
---
YES! I've always thought that would be the best way. Although maybe we could at first get 50% blue loot, 50% liquid isk so that corporations can still get taxes.
---
Unless you got a time machine this adds nothing.
---
Players = plural. You're example is singular, I believe.
---
the more sites you run the more likely you are going to get faction spawns, dreads can easily pay upwards of 60 mil per dread or more, titans can drop well over 100 mil per spawn and that's not counting the actual bounty just for killing the dread of titan, the 10/10 escalation that come from the sites can run as high as 100 mil each when sold then add in 40-60 hours of ratting ticks its relatively easy to get north of 30 a week for no lifers.
---
Pretty much this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHLdYVELWrQ
---
where will reddit users harvest easy karma now
---
pretty much every player group in the game does this, there is literally a guide in PH forums on how to set up this tool to be a safer ratter. 
---
as for removing local, players would just set up twitch streams/etc. of cloak scouts over the gate and go from there... none of these tools scrape intel automatically, but just shouting 'remove local' is not how to fix them.
---
it would be cool if CCP made it so with the new 64-bit client, logs weren't saved until you close your game. but I'm sure that's technically impossible for a myriad of reasons.
---
" . Jita is still the one place most go for everything... it's time for that to change. " This is one of the dumber things written on this sub in a while, markets consolidate because its cheaper and more effective to due business on a large scale in one location then on a small scale spread out all over the place. No one is going to like or support that idea because it sucks.
---
Nice essay
---
Here is an easy problem for you. 2015 a significant isk sink was the LP store. Fast forward 4+ years and LP store cashouts arent frankly worth it and the amount of mission runners/ incursion groups that have metric fuck tons of LP collecting dust because there is nothing new or worthwhile to cash out their LP for. PVE has to be revamped. The LP stores have to be redone. New content needs to be added to both.     
---
The problem is less the bots themselves and moreso that CCP completely lowered the barrier to entry so that anyone willing to invest up front can have a super alt to bot with that pays for itself from brand new clone to profit with injectors and hull within a week. Prior to implementation of Injectors/extractors you could go on the character bazaar and pay for a super alt that has been training for it for 2 years straight but the supply was limited. Bots existed but were more limited to things like stealth miner and belt ratting bots. The problems are not the VNI/Gila/Ishtar armies frankly its the instant super bots as 1 of them instantly replaces the need to run 3 VNIs/Gilas/Ihstars. 
---

Good stuff. Although whenever I come across bots they warp instantly, and I have to anchor bubbles to catch them, such a hassle but sometimes it pays off. https://zkillboard.com/kill/73956317/  https://zkillboard.com/kill/73956498/
---
The fuck
---
You may not be aware but selling game time cards was allowed all the way back since the beginning. 
---
The salt in local about blobbing was very hypocritical considering the current situation.... 
---
Nothing will come back. The game will die for real real. Not like hyperbole you see on here all the time but actually really dead. 
---
And i would rather put up with some bots until they can be properly surgically removed than to have a hack job with a machete go at it and kill everything.
---
A more proper solution for this problem is proper isk sinking or some process to convert isk into a form that can be blown up. And once that's patched up go after the bots directly. Remember to make your isk sink scalable so that the rest of the playerbase doesn't suffer horrifically once the isk deflates again from the lack of all the botting inflating it.
---
Also this guy has the most bizarre killboards I have ever seen. Looks like hundreds of deaths in empty Corvettes.

Well, shit. There goes my 1dq skill book racket

Yeah but we have all these spare nails for the coffin? What we do with them?

Hauling isn't a good career for a newbie for the reasons the other guy mentioned. Do something else until you have Omega, a few billion ISK to cover collateral, and the skill to fly a DST, and then come back to it if you're still interested.

I had forgotten this gem. This was an epic vid lol

I bet he just sits there with dozens of accounts in different systems, watches local and alerts miners/ratters about incoming traffic. Manually of course since botting isn't allowed in eve.

Mr. ElleRisalo, what you have just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard.

I think we need to just stop at the fact he was in an expanded cargohold JF in highsec with 28 billion in the hold.  Someone was going to pop him.  The autism level was too high for him to left to alive.

---
There is only one way to win EVE. 
---
Detective gobbins is on the case! 
---
Due to the average age of the Eve playerbase, I'd dare say that $100 is not that much to a majority of our players, at least compared to other communities. People can, and will, spend money to not have to grind isk.
---
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY about my favorite ship in the game???!!!
---
I watched this while mining ice (ofc).  Sounds exactly like the undock sound.  It was triggering my (Eve) PTSD.
---
It‚Äôs a tool that encourages automation and lessens the chance of player interaction. Watching a gate does nothing to help against no local if a wormhole is used, someone cynos in, logs into the system. No local adds a much needed unknown to the automated intel gathering we have now. So dismissing the idea as it not changing anything is asinine.
---
It's part of what got me into eve in the first time, I miss it 
---
lets hope they wont up the price for a titan skillbook bc i just about got enough moolah for one 
---
i mean the button is labled "buy and inject" and not "buy"
---
that it could be 100% better 
---
thats the best coinflip in a while 
---
Pretty much my situation. Have a career + family. Would much rather spend time with my family then rorqual mine or rat to feed my pvp addiction. Happy to spend $20...
---
i know a few, renember that pack w/ the rorq skin? yea i can name you a dozen who bought that 
---
I buy it if its a good deal or they are offering something else I can flip for more liquid isk. Same concept to those 50% off galaxy packs. If I didnt enjoy the game I wouldnt play it. Supporting CCP occasionally when it best benefits me is a no brainer.
---
and make it a console exclusive, but only last gen
---
Do you not know who I am... Link your main kid.

I know, let's invite Chuck Norris to fix Eve. It is our last hope.

i agree w/ you that attribs are not great to new beans, but a new bean will not remap and will have equal attributes across the field, literally making it have ZERO impact on the players skill traning time

meanwhile i, a 4 year old toon that never injected, remapped for titan skills to shave off 24 days in training time, remaps are for the late game where skills take 56+ days not for Battlecruiser level 1 that some rookie just bought and injected

The game died the day people started to spam citadels at every gate. I played since 2007 and the best years were 2010-2014.

The content that whs brought to the game in 2009 were game changing for me. 
---
No one lives in c6 space, you were getting blueballed by farming alts lmao
---
All C6's? Id say maybe 10 new systems at most. This would be such a good content generator, and if the nullsec blobs didnt like it, they would be highly inevitable holes.

About 15 times that last year ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

The only 'pvp' corps left in c6 space are dead star (lmao) and indigo (they undock when tackled, which is more pvp than some corps so)

Since you don't have asset safety in wormhole space the easiest way of minimising losses is to put all assets you don't need for home defence into a freighter on an alt and safe log it.

Why not send a bill for the ordnance that was used ?
---
I'm not sure that people understand how many Rorquals die, every day. For most players a rorq is a 10bill isk investment, which can be a  huge investment. If you look on zkill, every alliance in the game loses them, almost on a daily a basis. For some of these players they never come back from the loss and will move on to something else. 
---
You refer to the so called golden era of wormholes? I'd say the problem back then was it was too easy to roll into the same group multiple times a week. And if you are consistently dunking them then of course they will turtle. However with the NS it would mean less 6 rolling and starved J-Space content.

can I ask why you wouldn't just buy the $500 packs or contact CCP for a custom one?
---
+ T H E R A P Y, Dopamine and tuskers
---
So, that seems like a bit of money, and it is, but try buying a few fancy tanks in World of Tanks, you‚Äôll spend $100 bucks in a heartbeat.
---
As hobbies go, EVE is fucking dirt cheap.
---
Mining isnt what i'd think of as marketable gameplay
---
Considering there are literally thousands of rorquals mining on a daily basis, very few of them die, actually. 
---
A super is a much bigger investment than a rorqual, but if you actually catch one ratting, get it bubbled and cyno jammed, it‚Äôs easier to kill than a rorqual is simply due to the PANIC mod being overpowered. 
---
Referring to injecting the skill book, not skill injectors.
---
This game does have a bad habit of re-using terms (plexing, for example).
---
That is not true. I was involved in this conflict from day 1 since TRI moved into Pure B. You guys batphoned Snuff and INIT and Goons with every major timer. So don't even try to shift this on TRI batphoned who'ever lol. You brought 4 times the numbers in batphones. Pathetic
---
I think his sentence does not imply that he bought 15 times this exact deal, i read it more like "about 15 times that "ammount" last year"...
---
Ansiblex gates mate. Goons can be in Pure blind in 10 jumps.
---
yea that's what I thought
---
Well to my understanding it wasn't just about the legal battle. It was also about the extra step where WoW began scanning for running processes and if the bot program was detected on your system, you got auto-fucked for 18 months, no questions asked.
---
The captcha in quotes, I hoped, would make it clear I didn‚Äôt in fact mean an actual captcha, guess that went right over your head. Your comment about giving the bot authors more money is hilarious )) 
---
So the price of skill books is going up then?
---
After seeing star citizen and what they charge for there unfinished ships buying a bit of plex doesn't seem to strange. 
---
There is, I thought the ‚Äú‚Äù around captcha would make it clear i was not referring to an actual captcha, more a machine check. 
---
This is true, and it really sucks that it‚Äôs got to the point where such extreme ideas are being thrown out there. However, at the moment CCP are doing sweet fuck all, and I believe the players are more likely to come up with a solution if we keeping up with the suggestions. 
---
OK, OP you seem semi decent guy (pls read as guy, girl or apache helicopter IDGF).
---
In my opinion all your problems stemmed from being passive and not pushing yourself to ''play the game''. I get it you were now nullsec was scary and maybe you were in a shit corp with no help from the other more experienced players. The game is fun what you did was make it stagnant and stale trapped by your own insecurities at that time. By your own words you were confused (lack of knowledge and experience here) and you fell behind the events around you.
---
**A better you and friends:**
---
This time perhaps i want you to imagine yourself as the best version of you and throw yourself head long into anything that scares you, do your research figure out your weak points and strive to gain experience. Again google is your friend learn to fucking use it and if the answer is not there go to the community (as you rightly did now).
---
Make friends in eve, hek, the best friendships in this game come at the point of the scram and web in fun fights and the talk after (if it can be had). 
---
Do not stay solo and do not retreat in your shell for it is clear that you need to play with better players than yourself to get better.
---
**Possible corps / alliances in nullsec**
---
* Karmafleet (i am biased towards this)
---
* Brave 
---
* Dreddit
---
* Pandemic Horde
---
They all do pve and pvp but as always in nullsec pvp is required to stay in them at least once per month or something in a fleet. 
---
In Karmafleet (the only one i know, but i am sure its the same in the others) you will get the help you need.(unless you are dense as armor plates)
---
**The question of freshness in a eve:**
---
There are many ways this game can be played,  and the best thing when you are bored and the game is stale is change the tables.
---
 Think of a thing  you could not possibly conceive to do (ganking, pvp, scamming mining exploration etc.) and explore that path even if seems dirty:P you might learn a thing or 2 about you in the process. 
---
I hope you can find your fun what ever that is.
---
could be getting bumped in the mean time, but yes exit cyno
---
The minimum wage where I live is about US$9.62, 240PLEX pack is 10$. So a person working minimum wage would be making \~231 PLEX/hr which is about [888.42 mil ISK as I am writing this](https://evepraisal.com/a/lcn1l). I am not saying that such a person would necessarily want to spend money on ISK, but still I think its very worth it.
---
But how would they win at the mer if they did what you say? 
---
If that is true it was probably like a 2 person team working on it.
---
are you the Orthrus pilot at the end?
---
was wondering myself why you stopped shooting
---
What makes this morale post even more amusing is that the North might as well be the former Yugoslavia, 2001, and INIT might as well be the US. Pretty overkill and laying on "UNSPEAKABLE OPPOSITION" way too thick.
---
I mean, I've said for YEARS that the best ISK/hour in eve online is getting a minimum wage 2nd job, and using the income to buy plexes.  It's between 3x and 10x+ more profitable than ratting (3x more than super ratting, 10x+ for VNI ratting, rorquals are somewhere in the middle).
---
It could be really good!
---
Ever since getting in a Rorqual, I lost : 14 bil in bombed drones ( wh in system) 1x 9 bil Rorqual (during the non- schedule DT/ restart while we were sieged but unable to log in for hours ccp aid sorry) and a fully imlanted clone worth 3 bill.   Still for most players rusts would be the end ...
---
I pay for 4 accounts and buy plex. I have spent more on fortnite skins then plex. I can pew pew without mining or ratting.
---
well making life hell for real people to discourage cheaters seems unhelpful
---
What you always did for fun in MMOs. 
---
Scam people, hunt newbs, join a blob and fuck someone smaller than you, train to t3 frigate to roam in pair and get blasted on a gatecamp in enemy territory before you even find first afk vni to kill, haul 20B in a freighter and get dropped. Or just get a bot farm and profit. Tha last one is very popular lately, at least according to this sub. :)
---
what's the point in training for titans if you barely afford 5b lol
---
[removed]
---
CCP should just do better at hunting bots. Players don't do exactly the same thing at exactly the same time every time they go Ratting for hour after hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month..........
---
It can't be that hard to find bots when you have access to the back end and and can see the commands player/bots send with just pattern recognition on the commands sent. 
---
Player appears in local, super warps out after x amount of seconds, this is repeated 1,2,3,4,5.....10......20.......100 times. It can't be that hard to detect.
---
Spamming the same commands over and over and over...... 
---
More sophisticated bots might try and get around it but they'll never be random.

Hello,
---
I played this game for 1-2 years, I'm not Omega, reached skill cap and did a lot of small pvp fight (mostly in low sec, but some ine null sec / wormhole), I got bored, got offline for a long time and currently have no corp.  I never experienced a big scale battle and feel this is something i want to see.
---
What is the quickiest way for me to take part in a big pvp fight ? Even just as a spectator I don't mind.  Thanks
---
I wouldnt take a orca into ls otherwise, its just a huge GANK ME sign.
---
Use filament - enter dungeon - clear 3 rooms in 20m max - get loot
---
You can either grind to a certain level in the game, or you can fork out some cash up front. For many people the choice is simple.
---
Do the people who paid for the sheet earlier get their isk back?
---
Wait, do people actually NOT chain their guns/mining lasers??? 
---
r/eve is more like c+p than caod tbh
---
I remember the good ol' days of bounties- You'd rack up billions in bounties, then use an alt to kill yourself to claim it.
---
Does anyone have any tape out there?!
---
&gt;The largest part of this change is the fact that all core skills will now be purchasable directly from the character sheet for ISK. Rare skills **that are not seeded on the market and are only available through the completion of in game content** will not be available, but the skill sheet will provide a market link for them.
---
They define rare skills for you. Capital skills are seeded. Ergo they are not rare, therefore core.
---
Well, it would have been 1.00 isk if it wasn‚Äôt for them pesky fleet members wrecking my dank ticks
---
&gt;In recent times, the tributaries of the South have dried up
---
this just in - init and tapi are blue (or bluetral)
---
prove me wrong, initposters
---
How about servitors?
---
still sad coulda been dope cap brawl without the goon overkill. see ya next time i guess :)
---
Guns yes, not sure if you can group mining lasers yet, as for shame, I am not one of those heroes.
---
&gt;I have spent more on fortnite skins
---
I'm so sorry
---
Think about it ... imagine yourself **how much money CCP had to make (and is making) on those rorqual miners** so they decided to do mining focused advertising campaign. 
---
keep saying shit like this
---
apparently idiots like pgl and malcanis have actually started to believe you
---
If you read what i wrote, you kinda see i am saying the same thing :D
---
Baby steps
---
For it to work they would need to have bounties be assigned per corp or something. So fuckers who got the bounty on their head can't collect it themselves (that easy) with an alt. Then the kill can be closer to payout equal to his ship loss. You still don't want him lose a shuttle for 1b payout  i guess.
---
That sounds a lot like merc work, though. Just with an ingame mechanic, which in turn doesn't sound like a bad thing. 
---
But I'd rather see a rework of lowsec and anoms before they think about "probably cool" features and mechanics.
---
You have a Titan! If anyone is going to have tape, its you!
---
Either way. Not my fight, not my problem.
---
well syndicate was fun, crabbing in fountain is not.
---
i am very much enjoying this and hope for more in the future but the north is spewing so hard from the get go and im concerned for their safety.

as far back as i can remember you've basically lived in npc space or under the coattails of whatever coalition would have you, dating back to like 2007 when init were a tenant alliance in the northern coalition sponsored by (iirc) tcf

I've done it twice using the refer a friend on an alt on a galaxy pack. Made sense and funded a fax and rorq alt.

Why would you ever have lasers on a mal?

&gt; I never experienced a big scale battle and feel this is something i want to see.
---
from someone who's been in a bunch of them, a warning:
---
being involved in those big battles is a huge time sink and not very personally rewarding unless you're actually emotionally invested in the campaign. those fights often last upwards of 4-5 hours and there really aren't a ton of opportunities to leave and take care of personal stuff like eating or sleeping
---
that said, if you must, probably join horde. they're the newbro group that is the least averse to pvp, and often find themselves in large scale battles
---
shocking surprise
---
Well, that is a possible reading. But it's not necessarily the only way to interpret it. It could also mean that just mention the rare skills, because people will worry about them a lot. And there are still non-core, non-rare skills. And I really hope that is how it woll work, because there is no reason at all to have any capital (and others like t3 cruiser or smth) to be part of the "core" skills

I suggest newbros (without nullsec corp behind them) to get in exploration in null/low/wh space to introduce himself in the hostile zones, they will learn about move and survive in this areas with a very cheap ships and high rewards, using safes, tacticals, dscan, etc. When they have experience in survive hunters, i suggest them to become a hunter with a less cheap small pvp ship, introducing in Factional Warfare, one of the best ways i see to get in to pvp: a pve mechanic that pays well and you can do pvp simultaneously. Of course, at the beggining, you will loose a bunch of ships in engagings, but it's fun and teachs you a lot, at the time you can fund losses.
---
And i thought practically all rorq players made their gametime from mining!
---
That seems pretty obvious, I can‚Äôt remember suggesting making life hell for anyone though? 
---
Im always told the right people are not Interested in the game right now, which imo is a bit fucked up. But then im just a slightly above linemember so who knows 
---
It is more about how many Rorqual they inject and how many alts they have in them.      
---
Calling rorqs strategic assets is a joke. It's just a way to be safe in your space without having to admit you're blue.

I'm thinking of playing this after many, many years since forgotten how to play.  One thing worries me: people are saying highsec is riskier than nullsec.  Can I ease into this game, learn some newbie skills and figure out the Interface without being thrown into PVP from the first 5 minutes?

C: a titan capable pilot is useful even when you dont have one for the eventuality that you need to move one as someone who builds em or in case you need someone to bridge stuff so the alliance gives you the mighty shipcannon bc all the supercap pilots are busy dicking around in supers on the battlefield

Join one of the big newbro corps, probably Pandemic Horde, since we have the fastest application process and probably get more big fights than something like Brave/KF. 
---
When a ping for a stratop happens, just join it, and buy the ship listed in the ping. It‚Äôll probably be either a ferox if you‚Äôre in hisec, tackle stabber if we think the enemy will try to run, or crucifier.

Then just listen to what the FC says and do it, and hopefully the enemy will also form and you‚Äôll get a fight

Did you read the last summit‚Äôs minutes? We did bring this topic up, and the Ancil nerf came as a direct result - We also brought up a lot of our concerns regarding it and the general economy. Personally I think the most problematic thing with rorquals is that their effort scaling is very low - it‚Äôs not 8 times as hard to run 8 rorquals as it is 1. Compare that to say Abyssal running, or even Supercarrier ratting, which are at least 8 times as hard to multibox as solo.
---
I think that is the primary thing that‚Äôs the problem, and it would be my (highly uneducated) guess that this makes it difficult to tell bot-tier perfect gameplay automation from genuine human play.
---
Yes, the Reddit comment section, where we all try to prove to each other were fun at parties.

7 years ago PLEX was about 350 M isk. $99 /  $19 old Plex is about 6 rounded up (considering any deals, etc).  6 oldPLEX x 350 M is 2.1 B.  How does 2 B last that  7 years?

This is amazing! How come no one came up with this idea already?

I thought you could only buy one of those?

No I don't. And I don't care. You can barely form a sentence and you call me kid. Fucking nice one nate

The last two events convinced me to stop giving a fuck for a while. Each time I was waiting for them to get back into the game and each time they were a boring, grindy mess made by people who obviously think I would be dumb enough to waste time in their grind so that they can get some kind of metrics.
---
Well, you get nothing instead, I forgot to lapse the subs, so they still got my money, but I plan on fixing that fast.
---
Someone tell hil corvets don't provide killmarks please.
---
Making it not work in wormholes seems like a better gameplay solution to me. 
---
There are edge cases where this can have a decently large impact on gameplay.
---
The primary problem with rorquals is PANIC. The ancil nerf helped a bit but it‚Äôs not far enough. The effort scaling on rorquals is silly as well but that‚Äôs less of an issue if you can‚Äôt kill the bloody things. Most of the whaling fleets I‚Äôve been on rorquals die either because A) the guy is AFK, B) he‚Äôs shit and forgets to cyno before the inhib goes down, and even in case B it‚Äôs hit and miss. 
---
The PANIC module has no counter when you‚Äôre sitting under a supercapital umbrella. Any good pilot whose aware of what‚Äôs going on and how to use his ship is very unlikely to be killed, especially in places with an active standing fleet that drops an overwhelming response.
---
The fact that the PANIC module can also be chained continuously to keep subcap fleets permanently invulnerable is retarded as well. 
---
If PANIC were to be removed, I‚Äôd be happy with changing Indy core so it doesn‚Äôt stop you from warping, but instead gives you a massive agility nerf so you align incredibly slowly (a few minutes, for example). Gives good players time to evac, as you‚Äôre no longer dictated by the Indy core cycles, while still providing hunters the ability to catch bad pilots. Additionally, makes it harder to multibox rorquals as being ‚Äúperma aligned‚Äù drifts you further from the drones/ore. 
---
I never understood this logic. 
---
Second job is a fucking job. And a second one on top of that!
---
AFK ratting/mining means that i am lying in my fucking bed in my fucking home, smoking a fat blunt, watching some stuff on YT, chat with corpmates or play with an alt, all this WHILE drones kill stuff and make ISK for me. 
---
Even if this was 20x slower than actually WORKING for money, it is at least 50x more comfortable. So all and all, it is still a net gain for me. :P 
---
Pay as little attention as possible to this subreddit is basically rule #1, to be honest. If you read here more than just casually, you'll find the drive to play the game leaving you.
---
I like pathfinder the most, find it the most intuitive, but fuck me the issues with it lately are putting me off. Is it an ESI issue or a pathfinder issue? Are other tools having similar issues?

Your best bet would be to combat fit the orca, rename it "ThE bLoOdThIrStY oRcA" and at least give a good fight to the inevitable gankers.
---
Maybe we end skill training time. I mean, there is no skill, it does not entertain, it is only their to provide a cost to your choices -- a frustration.

You can wait out their reactivation timer, then re-enter system while they are in warp, then try to catch them.

Pen and paper
---
Yea, you can join a big corp and wait for it to give you content, PVP or PVE.
---
It's very fun game, you join a corp, suicide jump to your new home, get a VNI, rat for hours. Be bored, take a Procurer, mine for hours, be bored. When a neutral pop in local, dock. Be even more bored.
---
With all this ISK you can enjoy big F1 monkeys fleets, waiting hours to press F1, what a fun game. You don't chose your fitting, you don't chose your target, you don't chose when to attack, well you just press F1. Even a miner bot looks to have more fun than you.
---
Repeat for a month and now you are the perfect big NS corp player, you just don't know how to play.
---
Or, you actually learn how to play this game..
---
good let them leave
---
&gt; You think I'd roll into, say, tdsin and just go yeah np, 9th time this week you don't wanna fight, guess we'll roll into delve for actual pvp?
---
It's funny cause I'd rather get facefucked by titans in Delve than deal with TDSIN forming for 2 hours.
---
&gt;Also an idea to join one by myself?
---
don't
---
every random onlooker who shows up to a large fight just to watch contributes more to tidi and makes the experience worse for everyone in the system

try morrowind

oh its the launcher variant, forgot that they use those too, my bad

One of those 2 will create 10x more content

All Titans should have tape in the hangars, thats why you have them.

Those are extremely steps. Just nerfing nullsec anom respawns would accomplish the same things: spread many of the folks currently holes up in a few pockets of null into the rest of null (and other parts of space) in search of the income they're accustomed to.

I live in Delve and yes, there is plenty of Rorquals and VNIs, some botters ofc, but there is also a plenty of people flying all other stuff imaginable from Praxises via Typhoons to Rattles (i have even seen a Drake last week) for PvE, many others actively or passively defending our space from booshers and vni hunters. Others scanning/rolling WHs, others avoiding or orchestrating ganks and many, many others i almost do not even see as they are constantly in fleets killing shit. :D In short, anytime i log in, there is stuff going on, actual live people playing and having fun. 
---
Either this, or they have very, very sophisticated bots that can chat with me about movies and stuff. :)
---
Yeah dude nothing like having to get into another stupid uniform to do some bullshit job under managers you hate, co workers that are useless, and paying more taxes just to get some ingame currency at a faster isk/hour ratio lol!! Imagine being so stupid to gain money ingame at whatever rate you want, whatever days you feel like, quit whenever, and instead getting a job where you have a schedule you need to attend to just to get some ingame money LoL!

Me too actually. Eve 2 set in Eve universe but combat and resource gathering mechanics etc. all set on active instead of passive gameplay. No AFK anything, no SP farms or any of that sort of bullshit, skillpoint system based to grow with you according to what you actually do and maybe decay somewhat if you don't do it.
---
As far as the Online bit, I think the battles would have to be smaller. Simply because of raw numbers of plygons, HD textures, better physics, all that. No more submarine and spherical blob shit in space. But it would still be OK. PvE could be at least in parts instanced to relieve a lot of the server stress.
---
If it lasts a long time then the battles could become bigger, and PvE could be integrated back into main space.
---
This made me LOL
---
Stop giving them new ideas, they are unable to fix broken shit or finish what they started in the past. With the speed at which they currently operate, all fucked up things will be fixed in 2089, adding new stuff (stuff that makes sense especially) only slows them down. Thanks in advance.
---
Of course their is. Basically every MMO sees mudflation at that sort of a rate. And eve added injectors and already had a preference in favor of multiple accounts. The runaway isk inflation shouldn't surprise anyone.
---
Explo was very good to me as a newbro, i made my first couple of hundred mill isk off that. 
---
Also OP please don't be that guy who starts complaining and putting bounties on people when you get killed. Be cool about it, ask what you did wrong in a convo or something, a lot of people will give you valuable tips and even pay back your explo frig if you're new.
---
&gt;what do I do in EVE for fun
---
Log off and actually do something which is fun.
---
The community *had* to do the work for them. It is a damn shame that the *unpaid volunteers* of EVE Uni did a better work at documenting CCP's game than they did themselves. In fact, if they wouldn't have been so damn slow in vetting volunteers to help them maintain their own EVE documentation Wiki it could have been updated much more effectively. Instead CCP just axed all the staff who were busy with that, took their hands off it and retired their Wiki because "the EVE Uni Wiki is doing a better job than we could". 
---
I forgave CCP quite a lot, but that move was when I got *really* pissed off at them.

You can make a new account and activate the galaxy pack on that. Last time I did it I got ~4b from the assets it gives you (some MPTCs and skill extractors) and a new account with three months play time that you could make a skill farm alt or something
---
Yes it works now. They've got esi into a working state and it's playing nice. No more custom fuckery needed
---
probably invested it in market? dunno he said something about initial money that was needed. so it was an investion in something
---
&gt;For it to work they would need to have bounties be assigned per corp or something. So fuckers who got the bounty on their head can't collect it themselves (that easy) with an alt..
---
Wouldn't work, since everyone has out-of-corp alts.  And I'd gladly take a shuttle death to grab the hundreds of millions on my head - not just for the money, but to alleviate the heat I'd get if the bounty system actually encouraged people to go after high-value targets.
---
&gt; CCP offers a variety of PLEX packages from the Account Management pages, but players wishing to purchase 150,000 or more PLEX at once should send an e-mail to PLEXSales@ccpgames.com for further information on bulk purchases.

More than that actually.

Just curious but, is English your primary language?

I never said they were not entitled to complain.

Yes, some of the whining, bitching, moaning, complaining has resulted in positive change... I wonder how many possible new players have been so turned off by the entitled complaining that they decided not to even try to play...
---
I do enjoy the game, will continue playing the game because I still love it... and, as you so rightly pointed out in your idiotic assumption that I am "white knighting CCP", this IS a public forum...

One per account. With a bit of planning, you can get &gt;90% of the galaxy pack value as often as you want. Create some Alphas and train them to 5M SP. Then activate a galaxy pack on them. PLEX, MCTs etc. can be sold directly, only problem is the Omega time. But if you extract at the end, you can get most of it's value, too.
---
bot Hel?!... 
---
Firstly, I am not a cap pilot, so,, no Hels... 
---
Secondly, I do exploration and ratting as my primary source of isk.
---
So, not sure what your point was from reading your post but, there you go.
---
try out some skill injectors
---
I think you dont understand the economic background why PLEX is so high. This very much CCPs doing and they are milking the cow hard atm...which is smart if you only have short to midterm goals in mind tbh.
---
High PLEX prices will eventually lead to lower active players or active alts and in both cases to less content for everyone. There are many players that have time (eg students) but not 100 bucks a month to sub/plex for ISK to be competitive wallet/account wise so these ppl will always try to grind ISK for PLEX to sub.
---
Current market trend for PLEX is not healthy. I say that as someone who is buying PLEX with IRL money to get mad ISK.
---
I just figured that there are people happy with the higher plex prices.  Those that don't want to grind must be getting more pew per plex.

Oh, they are, especially with lower mineral prices causing ship prices to fall.
---
&gt; Signal Cartel / Eve Scout doesn‚Äôt control any area of space
---
unlike the other thera-based groups
---
which makes spreading a non issue
---
You made this post thinking you gonna be cool but you don't really understand the issue. You made this post because you are an idiot. So let me explain. This increase in plex is mostly due to the huge increase in skill points farm characters. Those chars only sit in jita doing nothing but training sp and extracting them for montly profit. there are ppl who run tens if not hundreds of these chars. Those accounts are paid with plex. Therefore increase in demand. The injectors itself are a problem in the game because it can create titan pilots in 1 day so it feeds into the capital proliferation problem.   
---
So back to plex. Yes people who own 1-2 accounts and play the game for pleasure and pay with plex are not happy about the situation because it cannot be stable. More and more people will start creating sp farm because of the situation and so plex'es will be more and more expensive. All the problems we see today with EVE is from injectors. and in the following months more and more will come. Injectors created capital and supercapital proliferation and also plex prices.   
---
The only thing you can do is object to it. Because this will kill the game. But being an idiot you might not see it. And you complain about people who complain about it. But those are the one that understand the problems of these matters. So if you love the game as you say you would better think more about the future of it and where do you see it in a few years. Or we can all do sp farm chars and fuck it in a few months. 
---
a character of yours got a debuff that explodes in few seconds.
---
It does not take 100 bucks a month to be competitive. Folks need to buy a ton of PLEX solely because they have so many accounts that are trying to earn enough to, you guessed it, merely PLEX the account. Drop down to fewer accounts and suddenly it is much more manageable on the subscription model.
---
How hard would you need to slap a titan to cook it? 
---
To be honest, the Palatine Keepstar itself ist so super stupid, that building it is even worse. So it was totally clear that this project is never being finished. Because either it's a scam or the guying doing it is stupid/has no idea about how EVE works.
---
If the project was for real, he would be better of building 100 Keepstars. Would be the same amount of fame if you anchor them all in one system, and would be a lot more useful/fun/whatever.  
---
&gt;You made this post because you are an idiot.
---
This is how you start a conversation if you want to make absolutely sure that the other one WILL NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING YOU SAY.

Also:

"You made this post thinking you gonna be cool....." 
---
You're thinking about EFT, not EveMon
---
I'm a programmer so I only have a vague understanding of the devops side of things, but if each solar system was it's own instance, and they used an elastic computing type architecture, I think it would be doable to have large scale battles as the solar system instance with all the action would be able to scale up on demand.

I *think* that makes sense but of course easier said than done.

That in the opening sentence and then not even bothering to include a TLDR on a poorly formatted rant.. Sure to get him far!
---
Well i know you think it's a poor choice of words. But i'm not wrong. 
---
you pick one single argument out of this and try to argue with me about the fact that PLEX price is healthy or not lmao. my statement means the same if you only have 1-2 accounts.
---
While tbh i cant understand how someone can be competitive with only 1-2 accounts...well the term competitive might be hard to assess objectively. I atleast could not do with less then 4 pvp toons logged in.
---
Skyrim is hot garbage without gigabytes of mods.
---
Fallout 3 is a spin-off of Fallout universe that was casualized to accomodate bigger audience.
---
Fallout: New Vegas was made by Obsidian, not Bethesda.
---
&gt; you guessed it
---
Spoken like someone who lets other people do the hunting, logistics, links and cynos for them. But I guess so long as you get to log your two accounts in for a ping, get content spoon fed to you and then log out again that's fine in your world.
---
They make more money with sales. They can then use confiscated isk to buy up the new supply... rinse and repeat. 
---
years of spoonfed f1 content...i dont want to judge this playstyle. If ppl like it and have fun okay. good for them. having an argument might be hard tho.
---
2 jobs? Will you have time left to spend your precious isk?
---
&gt; I see why. But i would not do it at all, as Uber drivers in our country are not paid very well. :D
---
American?
---
I think the major reason for PLEX prices rising is that more people are buying PLEX of the ingame market than people buying PLEX from CCP and supplying the ingame market. But im more than happy to hear out your understanding of that topic.
---
I don't know what you mean with CCP milking the Cow, but im sure you can explain it to me.
---
If the PLEX price is getting too high for a player, he has the choice of paying with irl money, play as alpha or quit playing the game. I don't see people quitting when they are having fun with the game (and asking for lower PLEX prices to so they can keep playing).
---
If i understand it correctly, your answer to the problem of rising PLEX prices is effectively thinning out the moneystream CCP receives by PLEX sales and DLC sales.
---
The students i know are very well capable of working for their privat expenses if their supplied money doesn't covers it all.
---
Do you read it yourself or just have somebody tell you what it says?
---
No it's not.
---
And cool, we totally agree there, but then I don't see the reason for your post... I might have given your words a tone you didn't, but you surely sound like you are complaining about people complaining.
---
Go on the official forum thread there's plenty of rage. Although it's probably just the same cocksucker that opposed the removal of learning skills.
---
I have about 50 large ones on stock ;)
---
lol. lazy to read 13 rows then don't read them. i'm against tl;dr concept. 
---
What does scanning siege even mean
---
Yes, that dosn't make what I said any less true.
---
nice ref
---
What a fucking neckbeard to write that shite. 
---
It is a shitpost.
---
Also, nestor enters siege, cant move, gets crazy bonus to scanning strength
---
They become immobile but their scan strength goes up alot?  I mean it's a terrible idea, but you should have been able to figure out what he meant
---
And?
---
Ok,,, it does sound that way.  I can see why most others would think the same.
---
I guess I should be very thankful that I can still play the game and enjoy it the way I want, just one account and one toon, which still can't Rorq mine... :)
---
Sorry, but that players count thingy that is being repeated over and over again is bullshit. Top online i remember, because online numbers are usually what matters, were around 2010, no clue about time prior to that since i wasnt realy paying attention to those. Then big chunks of players fell of the active gameplay. Reasons for that migh vary case by case but it wasnt a plex issue. The numbers were thinner every year yet it still wasnt due to plex, since at that time plex (500 plex nowdays) was roughly 600 mil despite that, player numbers were falling down, so it had to be something binded with the game irself. Yes, it was.
---
To fix this, CCP came up with the idea of free2play model, which was retarded idea, still is and everyone knew. With this change the game did get new players, usually from other mmos. Alpha accounts skills and abilities were limited to reflect exactly what they deserved - next to nothing. Soon after joining, the very same players started to bitch about EVEs complexity, learning curve and overal eveistoohardplshalp. Injectors poped up and alpha abilities were bolstered later on and guess what. VNI ratting bot armies became a thing. And like if that wasnt enough, serenity went bonkers and chinesse bots flooded TQ. Then another great idea came to life, Rorqual "balance" - the very last nail into the almost complete EVE coffin.
---
So now we have legions of alpha accounts running VNIs, chinesse boting supers and armies of rorquals which leads to fucked up economy, high plex prices,people bitching and players leaving.
---
Who would have guessed, right? The circle is closed, history repeats.
---
I should happily pay more for plex to keep this unique game going?  
---
More like CCP should happily offer plex sales to keep their small, unique player base interested, am I right?
---
Think of the blob that split a bounty to that level.
---
Don't trust Silvanoes, I heard he should probably be working.
---
I've been trying to come up with a bounty system that doesn't suck for years. Everything that would yield satisfying results to the person placing the bounty would also be open to some rather severe abuses. At this point I don't believe an in-game bounty mechanic will ever be viable. 
---
Find a group to roam with..
---
It's *two* Rifters held together with a Slasher, because 3x1=3
---
You want expensive? Try flight sims as a hobby. EVE is peanuts.
---
fuck off
---
And having people like that are a requirement for how a lot of null sec groups operate - and one could argue - for eve as a whole. But there's no denying that these types of people are inherently less valuable than a content generating FC who organises things, hunts, gets links alts, does cynos for their fleets, etc.
---
Then these people say "well you only really need one or two accounts to be competitive so it's totally fine if plex is expensive," and that's pretty obnoxious given their entire gameplay is predicated on someone else a) fronting the cash/time to grind the accounts and b) putting time in to get them content.
---
everyone is "friendly" till an aeon drops out of a wreck
---
I think it is decent, as it is, gives the game more depths in general. Also in a time where new releases constantly take off complexity and we enter a more theme park-like game where we have our hand held more than previous, i think we should do the opposite of making the game easier.
---
I think a major aspect of the game is to manage long-term plans for isk-making, as well as future potential professions to get into, and how to get to that point as efficient as possible etc.
---
!!But it is obnoxious to wait a whole year for a new remap!!
---
you can buy skins or inject SP to mine in a rorq
---
Can if find afk Cloaky campers? If so I'm all for it.
---
When I was underemployed I used to say, I have more hours than I have dollars. Not everyone can justify that $15 a month when they can spend a few hours of gaming time grinding.
---
This is one of those delicate balance things. If plex gets too expensive, people who grind for it won't consider it worth the time and go alpha.
---
There is already a solution for cloaky campers:
---
Git gud
---
Are you kidding me, those prices follow boters... that means if they start baning boters price will go down.. so dont tell me story about ccp and servers cause i will look at you as boter.
---
It has very easy to read graphs, check them out here

Wait, you can‚Äôt do bait killmail channels anymore? 
---
EU (Czech Republic), but i guess its similar everywhere. 
---
Don't forget a shoot blues preset, very good for setting up watch lists and things
---
wouldn't the opposite be the case since eve players are turbo-autists?
---
ok
---
Goons in to spoil everything as usual 
---
Quite wrong
---
The fuck are you talking about ? Are you even playing the game ?
---
1- PLEX rise because of the amount of bots, problem which CCP doesn't care about.
---
2- CCP does more profit from PLEX sales, which also help lower the PLEX prices.
---
3- A high PLEX as it is now is toxic for the game. Legit players won't deal with that bullshit while botters won't care cause they do their PLEX money in one day anyway.
---
4- Don't post when you don't have a clue. 
---
I is as simple as that, my dear Watson.
---
if you struggle to pay for entertainment grinding Ingame is probably not what you should do. 
---
Playing eve is terrible isk/hr 
---
Pve is terrible fun/hr
---
I can go outside and make 500 plex per hour by collecting bottles, its harder to justify wasting hours not having fun instead of just work 1/10th of those hours and have fun 
---
you seem to be rather new to the game my dude.
---
So buying a skill from the sheet will be marked up from the seeded skill books? So its more cost effective to still go buy the books?
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **4th Cakeday** Dentt_! ^(hug)
---
500mn to align to warp, 50,000mn to burn back to hole, 10,000mn to jump a hole with much less cap use than 50,000mn -or- burn back to hole while scrammed.
---
You are missing the rolling trick. While a cap with prop on is too heavy, if you activate the prop **immediately after** pressing jump, it will apply the full mass of a capital with a prop mod running that would normally be not allowed.
---
In other words, the game only checks your mass at the moment you press jump, but only processes the effect of your mass onto the hole at the time of session change. Thereby you have a small window to activate prop between when the 'check' happens and rolling mass is applied.
---
I take back my previous post, this is the dumbest shit you could have typed.
---
I unsubbed and started plexing all my accounts because I have very little faith left in CCP and don't think the game currently is worth paying for. So until they fix the game, they won't be getting any money from me anymore 
---
Why not spend the extra free time finding better work then? 
---
Except this is wrong. Its the bots that consume the PLEX. Its why EVEs PCU has been steady almost 4 years...yet somehow amount of ISK held in game has doubled and ISK from bounties has gone from 30k to 80k
---
well, this is a retarded post
---
then inject them
---
yep!
---
Just don‚Äôt get cloaky afk camped
---
Unfortunately I'm a noobie Alpha and had less than 500k skill points at the time, now near 1.3 mil. I usually have no clue what people here are even talking about but I'm learning and understand the cloak trick perfectly. I was pinging off locations and using a cheap ship to scout jump gates but still got caught. It'll take me awhile to get Omega up and running and the first couple of times it'll have minimal impact except to allow me to bank some skills till I can make it more permanent. I have got my income up to about 300+ mil a week though even as an Alpha and that'll improve in a few more days. While waiting on timers I'm busy creating spread sheets to maximize my strategy. I'll grow up some day.
---
I can honestly say my bot army allowed me to never pay CCP IRL isk.
---
plex price in game should be fixed. 500 plex should be at 500m isk maximum.
---
Maybe we end EVE. It is just a bunch of space pixels which waste everyone's time and money and makes them say dumb shit on the internet. 
---
But I'm just so addicted to the hate I get..... 
---
that must've been very difficult to thrive in such a hard contested market. i always cheered for Eve to be the most successful scifi sandbox MMO. it was a close race but i'm glad eve took it home.
---
weew. can you imagine if the other scifi sandbox mmo would've been  the successful one? nah, i can't either
---
In before CCP comes up with direct buy of blueprints, just like skills.
---
Yup, bots are ultimately good for the developers and for people who pay with real money (because they inflate isk and for each $ i spend on PLEX, i get much more ISK).
---
They are bad for plexing people. As if anybody cares about those scrubs.
---
they also killed most of the organic conflict... they are a disaster from a mechanical standpoint
---
"alot of heartblood and lifetime is invested into the game" , uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Not seeing the wisdom of this post is actually retarded. 
---
yeah was really worth it for those 100 ppl
---
eve isn't fun. Nothing in eve is fun. No not even pvp.
---
2010
---
I mean I see what you‚Äôre saying but it‚Äôs kind of like telling a poor to get unpoor or asking a homeless person why they don‚Äôt use all that free time to find a job. Not exactly the same but it‚Äôs not that simple
---
Ooooo a piece of candy
---
Let him downvote and feel good. 
---
ever heard of sunk cost fallacy? ppl have been playing this game for 10-15 years. you can't just turn your back to such an amount of commitment. just think about it, most people don't put as much effort into their real life as they do into their space pixel persona.
---
so yeah, for sure people will have a hard time to quit. it's less about addiction and more about losing an investment
---
That's why I was asking.  It certainly can be as simple as searching craigslist for a few mins, but I'm aware situations can be complex as well.
---
This is an awesome change for wormholers, you can now just move  clone to a wormhole and have it train everything up in there. 
---
I doubt CCP banned you because of that vid, they spotted a pattern in your online behavior that looks like an automated activity and took action. If you don't bot, they will look through it and find that it's a false positive, if you do bot then RIP (and fuck you). 
---
for tl;dr always write: No you can read this. It has to do with respect.
---
Take your friend to a bar and spend your money on drinks.
---
Like from a wormhole perspective Covops frigs or frigs/covops cloaking are massive, especially for smaller groups, and yes dumping like 4 billion on a scanning toon can totally be worth it. 
---
100 bucks US every so often  ain't so bad. Though I did rorq moon mine, and will again very soon as that kinda isk is just stupid good. Averaging a bil an hour last 3 times on just 1 rorq with suboptimal skills. Noms.
---
I mean I'm in the position right now where I make more money in game than I do irl.
---
($10/hr irl vs 800m/hr eve)
---
It is kind of depressing tbh.
---
If you'd rather flip burgers and take abuse from drunk idiots than flip rocks and watch Netflix, idk what to say.
---
i feel that most of the times tl;dr misses the true meaning of what the op wanted to say. Is no biggie. If no tl;dr you don't have to read. I respect that. It has nothing to do with the kind of respect you are talking about.
---
&gt; the major reason for PLEX prices rising
---
the main reason is that you can turn 23 PLEX into enough ISK to buy 24 PLEX by running a skill farm.
---
what activity makes you 800m/hr?
---
Ok
---
Looks interesting! Is it possible to import price data from citadels as well?
---
It's wise if an assumption the op made, that high Plex prices keeping credit card warriors happy won't drive off so many players who aren't credit card warriors that it more-or-less kills Eve, is correct.
---
It's pretty open to debate whether that assumption is correct.
---
Hm I plex 7 accounts, is that worth 105$ a month? Nah
---
This kills the server node
---
Nah if I'm making minimum wage I think I'd just grind that shit, but I'm in my 40s and working senior level IT, while I would never work nearly 12 hours to buy $99 in plesk, I'll definitely work 1h45m to buy it.
---
So Snuffed Out and Goons are calling themselves "Pure blind madness" now?
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
That's your choice to to take a video game that far lol.
---
I can give you an honest answer, one that won't be liked because that's just how r/eve works.
---
The comparisons are not the same, if PH was a sister alliance to PL, and corps upgraded from PH to PL then it's not really a group losing corps, they are just moving into the main alliance. I think we had 1 corp leave because they didn't fit in and that's ok.
---
In relation to Curse, if we want content there we can just go via Querious. The age of jump gates means I can get from J5A (Fountain) to 4-0 (Catch) in about 10 minutes with a Muninn fleet. Curse was great for us in it's time but really serves no purpose any more.
---
With all due respect to TAPI, we aren't them. Opening a third staging on PL / NC / PH doorstep livens up Eve a bit, both for us and for them. I've had more fun in the last week than I have in the last few months (capital fights excluded). We discussed this on TIS where Killah himself said that it was content so there really is no downside. As an Alliance we aren't afraid to try things and have them fail, usually things work out pretty well like Stukas or Boosh Ravens.
---
Again in relation to TAPI, had we deployed against them it would have turned into an EU focused Alliance vs a US focused Alliance, and I think everyone can agree those wars are the worst.
---
Had we gone for groups like Skillu etc then it would have been boring AF, we are just too big atm for those kinds of groups.
---
PL and NC are competent, they have the super umbrella that provides a challenge and they are all grouped up in one region. Sure we can't take the 800 vs 250 fights but we are having a blast so far and getting kills alongside the losses so its all good.
---
Let the rage flow.
---
it's respectful to read the whole post. Because it took a lot of time and effort to write it.
---
&gt; So BOT's make CCP rich
---
No, they make NC. rich.
---
Maybe not fixed, but minimum and maximum should be caped as it is the case in BDO, but then again, in that game, the market is not player driven. Then thing is, at the current rate of inflation, there will be only bots left and no legit players in a year top.
---
They might not get more money because the price goes up. People quitting is just as likely. The game does have massive issues.
---
&gt;Once EVE servers are shutting down,
---
Then we have finally won!
---
no.
---
but PLEX should not be 100% safe form of long term investment.
---
CCP maintains constant inflation by ensuring ISK sinks are lower than ISK faucets.
---
If a year or so of deflation was allowed then the smart long term store of wealth would move away from PLEX towards ISK.
---
Oh i don't want to get into what alliance has more BOT's. Im talking about the whole as a game.
---
I'm the exact opposite. I don't mind spending real cash on SP, but I don't like using it for disposable items like ships.
---
I'd probably be more hesitant to undock if there was actual money on the line. 
---
yeah i startet to pay for my 4 accounts with euro because plex price is so high and i want to buy some expensive stuff in game. That can't be done if most of my isk i grind in a month goes for just keep my accounts running.
---
$99.99 is pleb number. I only do $425 (when there's a discount).
---
The bots are often far more decent human beings than the Eve players themselves, maybe it'll be a better game when they are the only ones left.
---
So how do you go about finding a good spot to house your high sec corp? Not sure how people go about it I guess. Is there a better way to pick the site to do research online, while say you're at work and can't play for instance?
---
Oh im sure it will.
---
How far back does that history go? I wanna check how much I‚Äòve spend on eve
---
Also injectors. The plex consumption is hostile to player retention.
---
Whoosh.
---
Also, you're aware that bot is not an acronym, right?
---
We have never charged for our services. It has always been our goal to provide weapons and defense mechanisms for capsuleers are defenseless regardless of their economic situation!
---
yes. sry for caps.
---
&gt; It's wise if an assumption the op made, that high Plex prices keeping credit card warriors happy won't drive off so many players who aren't credit card warriors that it more-or-less kills Eve, is correct.
---
Well, i would be inclined to say, that it really isn't correct in the long run. But short term, it most probably will motivate people with money to spend them. I know it does motivate me.
---
yes it works - but not the old API version.   
---
you want the ESI version someone linked above.  
---
there was a time the ESI version wasnt an option without a developer registration, which needs payment history with CCP. so Alpha acount users couldn't use eveMon for a while. but that is now fixed.
---
a big Thank You the the guys maintaining EveMon ESI version.
---
Bit of a personal question tbh, no?
---
I'm going with jita scam contacts
---
I am guessing you only have 1 toon.  
---
After playing the game for a great while, I have learned there is 2 distinct ways of doing it, the 3rd one will not be explored as it is the road of misery and broken promises, more about that to the end. Also when writing this I keep in mind that end-goals will be like fund some kind of PvP, learn more in general about the game itself, and give you a steady income for you to easily try anything and find your place in the universe.
---
1.  Actively learn the game, by this I encourage exploration. You learn to use important survival tools like D-scan, zkillboard and dotlan etc. To learn about surroundings and to better understand if something is "safe" vs not.
---
Inspiring videos by Chance Ravinne in the start, where he went out to Null sec with a 2m ship, and return to HS with 200m. Making rapid progression very early on.   
---
You will much faster learn how core game mechanics work in general by taking this route, with probably the best possible isk/hour as your first week into the game.
---
Also "when" you get caught with your pants down, the attackers will probably pay back the ship and sometimes donate some extra to help you further if they realize how new you are to the game. Chances decreases the more salt and insults are thrown!  
---
2. Though I would suggest #1 after learning the game, I equally think #2 is viable but might be more a long-term plan. It requires you to get into a BS usually, and join a incursion community, also doable VNI ratting in NS, but that is pretty close to #3, also it is 60m/hour vs 180m/hour. Then use the overwhelmingly dank isk to buy injectors for an alt toon perhaps, so that you can later "learn" the game.
---
To start this path I started off doing missions. Almost any frigate to deal with Security 1-2 missions, LP helps with getting inplants to get skills faster too. Then progress to LVL 3 missions using cruiser etc. Then when you get BS skill which shouldnt be too far into your first week, you can probably easily apply to WTM perhaps. (alpha too)
---
(I did a prolonged instance were I did lvl 4 missions, and the isk was very bad, requires blitzing of certain missions etc. but imo, that require some more skills trained)
---
After one week of incursions you should be able to buy plex and some injectors. From there you have the whole world to look forward to. 
---
3. VNI ratting and Mining. This is a profession that is very passive and boring, and the isk/hour isn't very great, but great enough so that people can sustain it, and they can even add +4 accounts doing the same thing for even greater profit. However this does not develop your experience and knowledge of the game and you will be looked down upon. BUT if you measure your success in eve with your isk earned, this is probably a good start. 
---
But be warned, this is something to get easily burned out from, as it offers very little future possibilities. Though if you like the progress I am sure it might be one of the best roads to take with the mining in thought.  
---
Going from barges to rorquals with 5 accounts will give probably the best isk/hour the game can offer.
---
Also this probably requires joining an alliance with good home defenses etc.
---
But this route is also accessible  through #2, with the amount of injectors you can afford to buy. 
---
Cheers  
---
They are! Especially if they break they tend to give out free killmails to anyone who goes by. :D
---
If I were you I'd just pay the ¬£10 for a sub man. Grinding nearly 2b ISK just to blow it all on 30 days game time will burn you out before you have chance to discover the game.
---
Using PLEX to pay for your subscription is end-game, not start-of-game.
---
Good rule
---
and those epic campaigns won't return with the current pvp meta. at best you have some big alliance's sig completely ROFLStomp a new aspiring and talented player alliance.
---
this game is dead and gone.
---
He had three paragraphs. That is better than some. His main points are also true.
---
thanks... Already dumped the initial 3.x Version and found the 4.x one with ESI support ;)
---
The only sad thing is that I have so much stuff in "Asset safety" and I have to pay a LOT to get it back... 
---
I don't have much choice. It wasn't that long ago I was homeless and I still have no income. 
---
Its bots, injectors, and probably some regular plex purchasers finally giving up on the game.
---
What do you think. Rorq mining no doubt.
---
New stylish "Drifter Invasion" skins for VNI and rorquals?
---
&lt;3
---
Thank you! Think we do have the data but we need to retrieve the 'citadels' correctly to parse it on the website.
---
Do you have a Citadel name so we could cross-reference it in our database to see if we can find data? Would help us a lot!
---
What's the "long run" to you? CCP is working to earn bonus buyout $$$ and isn't truly independent anymore, and Eve is their only success ever even though it's currently at it's lowest PCU in over a decade.
---
If you're betting on Eve being healthy in the "long run" ... well...
---
I won't pay them in Euros, neither in PLEX at the current rate. 
---
Definitely emulating the X series. The fact he just flys around in a Corvette is also interesting...
---
I'm not reading this as "I'd prefer to work in reality for ISK" but just the straight up math problem of "real world money will get you more ISK than in game money".
---
meh, too many blues. newbies need a target rich environment to learn properly
---
bullshit, if all plex was used tomorrow they'd throw a party because all the skin buyers would need more.
---
You could try the TEST trading Keepstar in Perimeter? Don't remember the name from the top of my head.
---
Yikes
---
make me play a mini-game to continue ratting for long periods and I will drop the game like a bag of flaming dog shit.
---
I always say the same thing about Magic the Gathering. I nearly had a heart attack about 18 months after I started playing, because I realised that between travel, cards, tournament entry fees, accessories, and just randomly buying boxes/boosters, I'd spent like 4-5 grand in 18 months.
---
There's also the fact that there's plenty of people (like, say, me) that  have been playing long enough that their characters are "done".  So, every month, I consume at least 3x accounts worth of plex via skillfarm characters to maintain omega status.  Do I care if I'm profiting on those accounts?  Nah -- it's just cheap AF plexing for my mains that don't need training anymore.  Lack of new blood that needs that training is probably a non-inconsiderable factor.
---
you really know how to give a man a chub 2200 kiki's oh boy
---
...sunk cost fallacy is strong with this one...
---
I‚Äôm cool with that. Personally I think a mini game / captcha is a poor solution (as I‚Äôve mentioned numerous times itt), but you do you, my dude. 
---
I mean, while it's true that people wanting skins or resculpts or whatever would cause some continued demand for plex even if it no longer could buy omega time... I bet the demand would be 10% of what it is now, if that.
---
Huh, that's news to me... I mean, its not very useful to me, but still news.
---
Thank you 
---
In my 6 years of playing Eve I have never interacted with anything related to PI. I have recently created three chars that will be dedicated purely to making money, running agents in NPC space. Should I give it a try with PI? Would it be worth the hassle?
---
....yeah making losses even more meaningless sounds like a good plan ...
---
incidentally it's the same solution to your posting
---
I don't really think so
---
Good posting on r/eve died out long ago
---
i am not even the guy he is replying to but that sentence made me skip his entire comment
---
Eh 6/10s are more like 3-400m an hour. EANM drops are lucky finds, not the regular. 
---
Expensive plex because of botting inflation is about as positive for a CC warrior as going out of business sale at the closest grocery store is good for hungry consumers. Sure, you get what you want today at a price you like. But next week you need to find a new place to buy your groceries.
---
and when did you leave highsec?
---
I do not thing EvE can ever get "healthy" again. It is not just the game itself, it is the business enviroment on game market that is totally shit and overestimated expectations of investors into it in global. 
---
No, EvE is not getting healthier any time soon, cause industry grew to be one giant tumor slowly digesting itself. 
---
But it will help keep the numbers somewhat up for upcomming few months, maybe year. What commes after that, i can not say, too many variables.

To be fair reddit did tell me the best way to earn ISK is to get a job at McDonald's.
---
I mean, does FloppieTheBanjoClown really have a personal life?
---
why did you post this again
---
Z-S should be the default... it comes with useful tabs and requires very little fiddling around to fit one's taste.
---
internet importance ensues. 
---
this was written like the smug, oily, evil count trying to win the hand of the fair maiden by guile. does sister piss say m'lady often while tipping his fedora IRL as well?
---
the cringe is strong with this one
---
I actually recall our conversations on this. There were always some really go ideas, but then it just comes back around to being potentially huge exploitable problem.
---
And the miners, doubt forget after you've setup the mining pilot any SP you generate via the active subscription = isk that can go to more subscription.
---
When I was playing every waking moment I'd drop ¬£200-300 per month on Plex easily. But now other games are better, and eve is f2p.

if the capital skill is too expensive for you, how do you figure you can afford the capital itself?
---
Last time when i checked is was not working, earlier the same. 
---
see my other reply
---
I have a feeling he self-destructed.
---
And downward trending. Not sure what CCP did, but it's working!
---
This is very, very, very simple. The player base cried for years, we want to make more money, making money is hard or dangerous, not worth it like it should, people always said mining should make more isk/hr. people cried they wanted more isk when ratting so they can spend more time 'having fun' well. ccp gave us those things.
---
Bots and Rorquals, easier isk for everyone, SP farms, people able to be in super and super rat in goons safely (so more do that now than they ever did before)
---
All of these things mean more people have isk, ALOT of fucking isk, it means less people buy plex for thier isk. it means plex prices are high, with high plex prices usually that makes people buy plex because its more 'worth' buying, but theyre not. anyone seen the graph data for january? delve is disgusting. its 90% of the entire new eden income, and 10% of the destruction. they generated or mined like 40TRILLION isk in january alone.
---
Allegedly.
---
Fewer.
---
You know they published like, an blog post giving that exact same number right and detailed reasons for the bans ?
---
I agree with you but as as a player i am pissed off that those 'plex players' are replaced by skill farms that constantly raise the plex price.           
---
From selfish reasons - i prefer more active players in New Eden rather than bigger number of skill farm alts that do nothing more than sitting on station.

Not mentioning the gangs of lowlifes waiting on every corner along the way for the slightest opportunity to rob you naked and possibly infect you with hepathitis while they are at it. 
---
I know. Not saying that i like it, just that it is. 
---
It's a simple matter of economics for me. I can grind isk for an hour and get what? 100 Mil ISK? OR I can spend about 2 - 3 hours at work and grind IRL Dollars for 11 Billion ISK. I've been playing since 2013 and have only skilled into doctrine stuff. If I drop PLEX it's usually to avoid having to go crab to support my habit as I prefer going on roams, kitchen sinks, strat ops, and general tomfuckery, MUCH more than crabbing or mining. 
---
Of course CCP will never solve bots. It's not a problem that can be solved completely. This sort of stuff is an eternal arms race with no total solution possible, short of shutting down the game.
---
Seems kind of dumb to spend real money for fake money so you don't have to play the game as much.

Maybe i will try opera, last time i tried to use it it was full of adds on startup and after the initial cleaning it was still letting in a lot of them in while not providing enough additional support addins you can get on FF.           
---
For example above the basic " adblockers and anti-anti-anti(anti)-adblockers" my FF have i have bunch of other useful addons that :              
---
* allow me permanently remove parts of the webpages with one click            
---
* stop specific scripts from executing ... or inject something if it is missing          
---
* let me download any media if i wish  ....           
---
* block any kind of forwarding without my consent          
---
... just in perspective my host file have 130kb :D 
---
They just need to assign a bounty to a corp for 24 hours and if it's not collected it gets shuffled back into the stack.
---
And make sure the selection is random.
---
shoot me a PM with your character name, i'll hook you up with some free omega
---
they didn't kill anything with those bombers?
---
I'm not sure what you are talking about.
---
Rorqs are absolutely a strategic asset, they are ~3-5b ships that are unable to move or protect themselves against a legit fleet.
---
Yeah. That's pretty much my take on it as well. It's disposable income for someone at that level of their career. I can 100% guarantee if I were still making minimum wage I wouldn't be spending on ISK. 
---
Time is money, and my time is worth quite a bit. 
---
It's entirely possibly to get plenty of content by being a solo or small gang pvper with 1 or 2 accounts, you're basically saying that you need lots of accounts if you want to do particular playstyles. Which is fine, but it's false to say you need more than 1 or 2 accounts to have a good time in eve and have success.
---
lol if your insult is, "I work **very** hard at eve to have fun, you might want to reevaluate your life
---
I didn't know people used "filthy casual" unironically 
---
free hugs

---
took me literally a minute of research  
---
so you need 40b per month and about 50h of grind each month to plex those 21 accounts. nice if are having fun but i couldnt do that lmao
---
Here's the rules I followed and they never let me down:
---
* Pick a system that's a comfortable range from Jita/Perimeter. By comfortable, I mean a distance you wouldn't mind flying every day if you had to in whatever ship you most use for moving goods back and forth. For me, that was a blockade runner, so 6-8 jumps from Jita/Perimeter is good. If you're flying bigger haulers, you may want to be closer. Too close, though, and you'll rapidly start violating most or all of the other rules below.
---
* That said, no matter how close to Jita you are, your route to Jita should *not* include Uedama under any circumstances.
---
* Pick a system that has a school very close by, so you can pick up skill books. Better still if it has a couple of schools owned by different races close by because some books are race-locked.
---
* Pick a system that has a low-sec system nearby, within very easy jump freighter range. That low-sec system must have a safe undock station. Ideally, that safe undock station should be a Factory station.
---
* Pick a system that has cloning services either in that system or no more than one jump away from that system.
---
* Pick a system has both open offices, and if possible, multiple stations with open offices.
---
* Pick a system that is not saturated with other people's open dock citadels, but it's useful these days to have at least one other corp's open dock citadel in system. That way, you have a fall-back warp-to if your own citadels get war-dec'ed and/or camped.
---
* Less important these days, but still a consideration: if you can pick a system that has a L4 security or L4 distribution mission agent, that can be useful. Also much less important these days, but also useful: have a Repair station in system.
---
* Finally, a system with a lot of moons in it is worthwhile.
---
Find a system that meets all of these rules and you can't go wrong. Find a system that meets most of them and you won't go far wrong.
---
Yup, Wargamming sqeezing that lemon properly. :D
---
Yeah, but bots are like Hydras. Putting them down for good is much harder than cutting off a few heads.
---
Our small gang group doesn't have anyone using more than 2 chars and we do fine.
---
At least for me it was really worth. I‚Äôm enjoying a lot of the experience. At least I can fly any T1 ship.
---
Sure they need to spend less money for the same isk ingame - don't deny the fact. 
---
you mean supply and demand? that's logic. get out of here with your logic.
---
Meh, it was cool until CCP opened the gate of hell themselves by inviting the Serenity community to join Tranquility... That's the point where the problems started, predictably tho.
---
I guess he extract those accounts like every one else so the upkeep is almost 0. 
---
No idea when you may have last checked but EVEMON has been working since I started playing again a few months ago.
---
Prices will probably go up, but if you can't afford the book, you can't afford the ship.
---
ye you are prolly right and it makes very much sense...good gameplay mechanic
---
If your gameplay makes you think you need $100 a month to have fun, that might be the disconnect between most eve players and hardcore players
---
Man... I got into one of those online CCGs a while back and ended up dropping a couple hundred to buy out the whole set. I made the mistake of telling someone this in the game chat and everyone acted like it was pure insanity. I had to explain that I've probably got about $40k worth of MTG cards in my closet right now that I'm not playing with anymore and that $200 to buy out an entire playset of this game so that I could make decks that are cohesive and competitive isn't that much relative to other games. 
---
Same thing when I was talking to my nephew about EVE. He was giving me guff about buying Plex because you could "play other video games for $60". Then I asked him how much his MTG collection was worth and he stopped giving me shit.  
---
I would be if the only thing worth buying with plex, skill injectors, didn't also rise with the price of plex.
---
2012
---
id like to see your kb if you feel like showing it. seriously
---
I've spent way more money on way dumber things
---
Sometimes it has to be said, not for the benifit of op but for other readers.
---
Yeah what the other guy said.
---
I extract all of them and only pay like 3 or 4b/month in plex if I don't stockpile extractors.
---
Links for channels are a different colour than killmails now.
---
Irony: same guy says in the same thread that he's won EVE.
---
Won a $100 visa giftcard at work over the summer and used it at the end of 2018 on the $100 pack. No regrets.
---
The price is driven by demand/supply, the demand is from multi training/bots/rorq alts, the supply is drive by plex sales/new content/payday.
---
Most of the people moaning or asking for sales fit into the multi training/bots/rorq category. I'm not saying they are wrong doing what they do (well maybe botters). Most people I know pay for their primary account with $$ and plex anything in addition (those with a number of rorq's know they can fund plex subs with a few hours of mining).
---
I dispise people posting on reddit as "champions of the alphas and newbros" when in reality they just want a better profit margin for their isk income.
---
Sure, 
---
[https://zkillboard.com/character/580679549/](https://zkillboard.com/character/580679549/)
---
This has about 0 relation to my message. I'm just pointing out that looking at the active player graph to figure out how many bots are gone when CCP themselves gives the numbers is a bit useless.
---
While not wrong, I don't think its the whole story.  Until a couple of years ago, there was no real "preferred" region in EVE.  Sure, NS favored the large coalitions (and that's the way it was supposed to work) but WH &amp; FW offered a different experience.  You are right that now, CCP's and EVE community has shifted their foci entirely onto SOV NS to the detriment of all else.  
---
I can't speak for FW but WH space is still competitive with Sov NS for fun/hour, has decent ISK making potential and offers a true "EVE" experience where a small, close band can make an impact.  (wormholer btw).  
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 2: The sadder thing is, if the garmur was webbing him, even if he went 25m/s he could have burnt back to the gate eventually, and the garmur pilot would have either had to de-aggress in time or the JF pilot could have jumped trough and perhaps warped to a safe station. Assuming the garmur guy didn't have backup.
---
Bumps are a very real thing.
---
Tbh it's pretty obnoxious to refuse to lean on and let others lean on you in an mmo.
---
Also give it the ability to bridge to the scanned object.
---
and i thought having a c6 is good isk income lol
---
Why do you think most of the small T1 industrialist died? Each "free" account is 30 industry lines ... also each rorqual comes with those industry lines.
---
Exploration in wormholes is great isk and provides content for people in wormholes!
---
and injector farms are a nice boost to Omega Account numbers, a number that Hilmar rubbed under PAs nose to get a good cash out
---
While it does suck, is this actually why people quit? I doubt it.
---
That's pretty much it. If I want something I work it out to how many hours of overtime I have to work in real life. Fortunate enough to have a decent paying job with no familial expenses so sometimes it's totally okay for me to work a few hours extra in a week for that sweet, sweet Eve fame.
---
There is quite big possibility that those are not bots(only) but also players pissed up with the AT that stopped to login. 
---
because as a titan pilot he did it again ?
---
&gt; you pick one single argument out of this and try to argue with me about the fact that PLEX price is healthy or not lmao. my statement means the same if you only have 1-2 accounts.
---
Z-S would be a bad idea to pre-load. If you tweak the entries in the tab descriptions &amp; bracket format fields, it breaks all the fancy formatting, because the strings you can import via YAML are longer than the text boxes permit you to save in the client. 
---
That's why my pack  doesn't have any of that fancy stuff, no matter how much people ask - I prefer to make the pack as easy as possible for people to adjust on the fly without concern for breaking anything. If CCP used Z-S as the default, they'd have endless tickets from new players whose overviews went to shit as soon as they tried to change anything - that's not a good outcome either. 
---
&gt; started plexing all my accounts
---
- these PLEX give CCP money too
---
- this causes the rising demand vs. at least not rising if not declining supply --&gt; ingame PLEX prices going up 
---
As long as you admit this and not start complaining and reeeeeing about rising PLEX prices its ok. But keep in mind that this same developement on the Serenity Server led to 500 PLEX costing 20 billion ISK.
---
Eveybody called me a grumpy old git when i said skill injectors would be bad
---
You don't really need to read this subreddit for that tbh. 
---
Thought you could plan skills queues with it too. I‚Äôll bugger off back under my asteroid.
---
Let me make a short calculation, at the end of the current developement (that can be observed on Serenity Server) this would mean you need 140 Billion ISK per month to sub your accounts.
---
Everything is fine ....
---
I mean.. if you need that much of a boost to your scanning skills that you would rather be locked in place for 5 minutes because you can't scan it down faster than that without a boost... maybe scanning/exploration isn't for you?
---
&gt; I think the major reason for PLEX prices rising is that more people are buying PLEX of the ingame market than people buying PLEX from CCP and supplying the ingame market.
---
Prices are going up because demand is exceeding supply. Someone get this man nobel prize.
---
You mentioned this on twitter last week - I took a look, and have to say it's a pretty half-assed job they did after 10+ years of players suggesting it needs revision. There's a ton of problems pointed out by others in comments.
---
Did CCP actually talk to any players who've put thought into overview issues to inform these changes?  I struggle to believe they talked to you before they did it, because I can't imagine you'd have given a thumbs-up to some of the decisions they made. I'm by no means the only, or even the most, definitive expert on overviews, but over what, 6 years of maintaining a widely distributed pack, I reckon if CCP wanted to talk to people who knew overview shit, I'd be somewhere on that list. 
---
I'm glad they're finally turning attention to it, but I hope this is a first step - not a finished product that they won't revisit for another decade. It's nowhere near enough of an improvement to justify a one-look-and-done approach.
---
Would be lovely to scan down a w-space system really quickly at the cost of safety ;)
---
"a bunch of money and a friend"
---
That pretty much covers sp and mentality requirements. xD
---
And people wonder why I smartbomb everything that moves. Darwin award winners, that's why. 
---
You're aware that "collecting your own bounty" would cost you more money than it would bring right?
---
Good job linking a BR from 2 hours earlier, moron.
---
have a venture from me
---
So you are referring to volume rather than just a single item? That's not a terrible idea. Would need to be mindful of how OP it could be to scan down a system with 20 sigs and get 4 or 5 quick wormhole connects solo.
---
Either take 1 or 3. 2 is just not it.
---
my only question is where the fuck are these people when i'm around??
---
because you mainly did fw ls, big bloc ns/ls and casual roaming the last months. thats okay and fun.
---
but try to do a specop or kill a super/rorq or anything that has ***some value*** to it where u need preperation. cynos, caps, sabres, scouts, spies, logistics. ppl that are content creators cant do with 1-2 accounts.
---
Same here, small team wormholer. Love the game.  
---
However, while I don't mind the NS focus on /r/Eve, (its expected and fun), CCP has - imho - lost their way by making SOV NS the only "EVE" that matters.  
---
So, for now, yeah, love the game, really do.  Not sure how long that's going to last though... 
---
It's funny because as soon as he flies into system now, they think he's about to drop them and all run off and cloak.
---
Yeah a big bonus to scan strength can let you scan things down with a much bigger probe radius, so you can scan down the system much faster. Could be OP like you said which is why siege could be a thing. Its a dumb idea but nestors are cool yo.
---
I just installed a version last updated this year. Are you using the github repo? You'll get the api error if the version is too out of date but my install definitely worked two days ago.

---
I am so sorry, that you are poor. 
---
WE WILL JUST GO TO SCAM CITIZEN
---
The most fun thing you did last time, quit again and come back in 2 years.
---
Well obviously you need more people the bigger the thing you try and kill, but you can still easily do with with people who have 1-2 accounts each. 
---
Multiboxing lets you effectively play as more people, if you wanna kill a rorq with 5 people then yes you'll need to multibox. But you can be perfectly competitive without multiboxing. 
---
It comes down to what you count as "competitive" and "content creation" I guess; I'd definitely say I create content, but you might have a different definition by the look of it.
---
BRING ON
---
##THE WRECKING MACHINE!
---
CCP are alone to blame, and I won't cry a single tear for them if the game dies because they are stupid fucks and didn't listen to players like it's always the case.
---
When CCP invited Serenity players to join Tranquility, we alarmed them that the bots and RMTers plaguing Serenity would spread to TQ and cause the exact same issues as on the chinese servers, but as always, CCP saw the raw profit of selling more PLEX and subs and didn't care.
---
CCP executed it's own doom, it's deserved. I'm tired of trying to find them excuses for just being greedy assholes, now let them do what they want, they will get what they deserve soon enough. 
---
How about a kill contract? Set an expire date, a payment, and a minimum ship value. That way you am have bounty hunters go around doing them, and it harms people who would collect it on an alt, because of the manually player set ship cost
---
Please, go on...
---
Does the fact that we enjoy different things anger you? Does the fact we like doing something you consider boring offend you so much? And does the fact that we are not afraid to pay in real money to get said content disturb you?
---
Yeah, that can be filed under "shit ideas that we can't undo", next to skill injectors, nuPlex, and rorquals
---
Yeah I know what you mean $10 basically lets you skip 7-8days of training that you never losss and that's if you buy the $19.99 pack.

---
Yeah, i got like a c type em membrane and a bunch of trash on the last one i did.
---
MMMAAAAALLLLLLL! Sabers! Intel's pitching a fit. They're 1 jump or will be soon.
---
&gt;The comparisons are not the same, if PH was a sister alliance to PL, and corps upgraded from PH to PL then it's not really a group losing corps, they are just moving into the main alliance. I think we had 1 corp leave because they didn't fit in and that's ok.
---
i respect that. pl has never really culturally embraced the idea of having a training alliance, and phorde has always explicitly stated that you don't graduate from horde to pl as was possible in waffles in days past
---
that said, in the past couple of years horde has developed into a strong, independent alliance and partner in our coalition, and a lot of people are finding that it makes a great place to stay and participate in the culture
---
training alliances work for some groups, and they don't for others. i wasn't trying to knock your process because clearly it works for you. pl's process has generally been to poach corps on their way out of other alliances and either help them develop into strong members of the alliance (habit comes to mind), or eventually widot the useful people and discard the empty husk (nesw comes to mind). it's macabre, but it's worked for pl for a long time too
---
i guess tl;dr, whatever works for you
---
&gt;In relation to Curse, if we want content there we can just go via Querious. The age of jump gates means I can get from J5A (Fountain) to 4-0 (Catch) in about 10 minutes with a Muninn fleet. Curse was great for us in it's time but really serves no purpose any more.
---
i'd suggest that it does, at least for the purpose of maintaining a dread cache so you can participate in capital fights, but i'm not you and i don't tell you what to do. if third partying in stukas is your end game, then cheers
---
&gt;With all due respect to TAPI, we aren't them. Opening a third staging on PL / NC / PH doorstep livens up Eve a bit, both for us and for them. I've had more fun in the last week than I have in the last few months (capital fights excluded). We discussed this on TIS where Killah himself said that it was content so there really is no downside. As an Alliance we aren't afraid to try things and have them fail, usually things work out pretty well like Stukas or Boosh Ravens.
---
i agree that you're not tapi, and the fact that you've brought your whole alliance to our doorstep has actually given us some pause, where the geminate campaign was pitched to pl as a fun rapid deployment where we'd farm dinos and then probably go home when they got bored
---
however, i think collectively eve's playerbase has spent about the past two years, through various entities deploying, discovering that in the post-phoebe, post-citadel era, it's more or less impossible to overcome a local supercap umbrella and make any meaningful headway without bringing your own
---
i'm sure you've noticed that we've picked up your stuka doctrine and have been hard at work trying to crack the code of how to use it and how to beat it, so i'm definitely not saying "go away and don't give us more opportunities to learn and improve"
---
i guess what i am saying is that at least from my individual perspective it's hard to understand what your goal is with deploying to hakonen. if you're just here to farm rorqs and occasionally reinforce some stuff, then okay, but that's not my idea of a fun deployment. if you're here for anything more than that, i'm at a loss
---
&gt;Again in relation to TAPI, had we deployed against them it would have turned into an EU focused Alliance vs a US focused Alliance, and I think everyone can agree those wars are the worst.
---
yes.
---
however you guys are active enough, early enough, that i think you could have had a lot of fun out of curse showing up to third party the xix versus frat conflict that's brewing down there, and you probably wouldn't face-check a super fleet every time you undocked there either
---
&gt;Had we gone for groups like Skillu etc then it would have been boring AF, we are just too big atm for those kinds of groups.
---
i honestly think you might actually be surprised. skillu has gotten pretty meaty over the last year or so, i'd buy tickets to a skillu vs init pay per view special
---
i'm not sure your post was as controversial as you thought it would be. a lot of initposters tend on the dumb euro side, but you've always been pretty measured and reasonable so
---
Awesome, thank you for clarifying. I did search on this first and while there's references to the trick I didn't see a description.
---
Theres a few and they depend greatly on whos dropping, the situation and what you have available:
---
* fit a cyno to your ratting ship - jump in fax/carriers/supers
---
* dont rat in the same system as a cloaky camper (not always able)
---
* dont rat in expensive stuff that cant protect themselves - rattles, orcas etc. 
---
* fit your rorqs properly so they can survive.
---
* use a titan and such on standby so you can bridge in reinforcements
---
* dont rat when the cloaky camper is usually at their keyboard.
---

* make yourself unattractive to gank.

Doing some rough math, that's approximately $0.0000007
---
Your horse is so high, that i almost can not see you all the way up there. :DDD
---
&gt; Then these people say "well you only really need one or two accounts to be competitive so it's totally fine if plex is expensive," and that's pretty obnoxious given their entire gameplay is predicated on someone else a) fronting the cash/time to grind the accounts and b) putting time in to get them content.
---
Did you ever hear about cooperation or reciprocity? Having people with different skills to do different jobs for each other is what this game is supposed to look like, right? 
---
In my opinion, its those guys with 1000 alts (one cyno, one subcaps, one caps, 100 for eyes) who can do everything in the game solo, are the ones destroying the opportunity for cool and challenging gameplay. 
---
If you're underemployed, your priority should be fixing that, not grinding ISK for internet spaceships.

I don't really have my own home. Just a place where I can stay as long as I want. I actually still prefer being outside even though I don't have to. My bed while I was homeless was just as nice as any bed. If it wasn't a regular bed in an abandoned car wash it was a homemade hammock with an 8 inch thick foam pad.

---
not after we #kickwecu.
---
I play on TQ...
---
I have done this, and I have sacrificed an Orca.
---
I had this same Idea, fit up a tanky group of procs and a tanky 150k+ EHP Orca and go into low sec to mass mine some of those more valuable ores.
---
The problem?  My mining barge alts didn't have the skills to run interference for the orca, and the procurers only mine about 2/3s what the covetors can. 
---
Your fleet can make 50-70 mil an hour mining plagioclase and compressing it for sale, more if regular compressed omber stays in the 8500 ISK per unit range.  
---
Like they have said before there is absolutely no reason to take that fleet into lowsec.  Your lower mining yields due to the defensive nature of your fittings will cancel out any profit advantage you have for the value of the ore. 
---
The one exception is if you're going to someones moon mining op, and you have guards and station guns and E-War to protect you.  But then, you are probably not keeping that ore, and you are only getting a small cut of the profits.
---
But if you must go, do not go until you can fit all T2 Light Drones.  And your ORCA Driver can fit T2 medium Drones and E-War Drones.
---
Your Procs should be able to run a 80k EHP buffer Tank and mine for 14-15 m3 per second.  Your ORCA should have 200k+ EHP, and with T2 drones should be able to get 200-400 DPS.

Your not a "bait" or a "trap," you have no scrams.  You have enough combat drones to scare someone and handle belt rats.  You have no way to repair, you can only outlast.  
---
Your ORCA is heading to safety whenever someone you don't know is in the system (remembering that interruptions cost money too). 
---
 If someone jumps you and you drive them off, your day is probably over, because they will likely come back with friends after you have shown you can put up a good fight.  
---
Also, if you have a low-sec area that you want to mine in, figure out who the locals are.  Do some PVP, lose some ships, have some good fights, make some friends.  And then it "might" become safe to mine.
---
That's all I have for now,
---
Fly Safe
---
better start crabbing with this plex price
---
That is pretty interesting tl hear. I hope things will becomr even better in the future and I'm glad you play EVE o7
---
I stand corrected, thought it was less in the past.
---
seriously my favorite hting in EVE.  
---
im just now getting into the game as a new player and im having a blast doing L3's in a Battlecruiser/mining/exploring low &amp; null/looking into geopolitics - the sorts. of course the game isn't what is was all those years ago or heading in the same direction - that's life. now where it's going right now, i cant say if that's good or bad; mostly because i wasn't around back then, but that's subjective, you can't please everyone. i probably would have liked "old EVE" better too if i was playing way back then, but the constant doomsaying and white knight accusations and just the "agree its bad or you're part of the problem" shit mentality this subreddit promotes isn't helping.
---
You can mention these rorqual, they weren't in comms.
---
But please lets mention that INIT
---
But then there is a greater inflation in prices ingame, no?
---
Looking at a "t1 frigate" tutorial on YouTube, from 2017, and finding the same frigate with the same specs in Jita, it is almost twice the price.
---
deploy to literally any other alliance/coalition in eve's home space, init included, and this is the exact response you get
---

---
&gt;&gt;minimise risks and do not throw your ships away cheaply
---
yeah like that blops that gated into death
---
Well, there's only one way to find out
---
*unzips*
---
Pretty bold to assume constant number of actual people
---
meh, losses were always pretty meaningless. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose is one of EVE's longest standing mottoes, but even further than that, there's a piece of it missing: If you were able to save up and buy the very first one, you can always do it again.
---
At any rate, the real problem with losses feeling casual isn't the impact on the wallet, but the intense supply glut. When the ships sell for less than the value of the minerals it takes to construct them, you can bet that there's just too fucking many of them. Losing a large fleet of high quality ships used to be more of an issue because the armada itself was actually gone. Unfortunately, the present state of things was always inevitable. Industry is simply too low effort of a mechanic. That's not necessarily a bad thing, either. A lot of players, new and old alike, love making ships in the game. It's just that, taking a handful of mats and a commodity, putting it all into a hopper, push a button, and 3 hours later a ship pops out that's completely indistinguishable from anyone else who decided to produce that ship today means that, in the long run, too many of the things was always going to happen.

Hey don't diss, Gunjack was awesome.

CCP shill
---
Are they giving you a free account or what?
---
four is right out
---
&gt; fit a cyno to your ratting ship
---
Will not save my VNI.
---
&gt;dont rat in the same system as a cloaky camper
---
Entire pipes can be shut down by a cloaky camper moving up and down them.
---
&gt;dont rat in expensive stuff that cant protect themselves - rattles, orcas etc.
---
&gt;fit your rorqs properly so they can survive.
---
I can't afford to fly a rattle and can't fly a rorq so i don't know anything about these.
---
&gt;use a titan and such on standby so you can bridge in reinforcements
---
Because everyone has a fleet on standby 100% of the time to save your VNI.
---
Congrats on Bittervet V! What are you gonna put in your queue next?
---
But what about electricity? It cost a lot whee I live
---
It's not sad. The way in how titans are used to rekt an entire fleet of bombers. Not just jump on a cyno and boson in the wrong way, if you know what I mean...
---
You can pay off your vni in around an hour and a half of ratting and if cloaky campers are killing your vnis then they are probably not very good. If they are moving up and down the pipe then you probably shouldnt be ratting
---
Yes they have. Bots are plexed, they farm, they ultimately get banned at a given moment if CCP does something, afterwards, a new botting char is created, plexed, and so on. In the meantime, legit players quit the game because of shit like AT being canceled or just the game becoming AIDS juice, which lead to less PLEX being consumed by legit players. 
---
&gt; CCP shill
---
&gt; Are they giving you a free account or what?
---
Nah, it's just Falcon posting through his alt. ;)
---
paying for plex is infinitely better than doing pve
---
idk, just lock chinese IPs and it's done. Sure you'll lock out some legit players, but at least you'll bitchslap botters in the face. 
---
I am a grumpy old git, and I just respecced a character from abyssal grinding to mining and reprocessing because skill injectors are available.  It was great.  One of those things that's always been available in other games but totally missing in Eve.
---
&gt;Snuffed can only take the grid if they drop titans which is interesting.
---
Do what Shadow Cartel and Escalating Entropy did in Placid - batphone the fuck out of NCdot, leading to FC brain-drain and poaching into NCdot and either collapse or become a hollow shell (or elite gatecampers, depending on whom you ask).
---
subscription numbers would go up. PLEX is not a subscription ;)
---
I look at it more like I dont have to *grind* the game as much. The PvE grind in Eve is mostly torture, I'm happy to drop a couple bills a month and can easily do so to support my Eve play without having to endure that torture.
---
Inject into a Rorqual and assist in the rapid destruction of Eve.
---
so NC. is a cruiser fleet and horde in a jackdaw fleet but a goon harpy fleet and its the whole master-pet relationship lol.
---
also Leshaks look super fun in these type of engagements 
---
I've probably spent about 400 dollars in my "eve career" on PLEX, which isn't bad considering I've been playing since late-2009, off and on.
---
I make a decent living, and it's worth it for me to not have to spend hours and hours grinding isk that I could be spending with my family.
---
I mean a c6 is more like 2-3b/hr with just 1 or 2 dreads. It is just not infinite, so you make that is for a few hours and then it's a few days iirc before you can do it again (or you roll holes and do it until you die).
---
Quite possibly
---
I'd argue that it's essentially the same. I'm not educated enough in neuro-chemistry, but as far as I remember there are similarities between what happens around substance abuse and patterns of unhealthy, repetitive behavior. 
---
From a subjective perspective I think you're right and as you say, it's often a fallacy. Unless you really, really, really (really?) have no other choice than to stick to your investment, it's better to cut your losses and move on. In order to do that, you first have to acknowledge you're beating a dead horse and that's harder than it may sound. That's where I think it looks pretty much like addiction. Unhappy players don't defend CCP, they don't scetch optimistic visions of EVE's future and often they don't even report much positively about their current in-game activities. The one thing that is keeping them from acknowledging they're in an unhealthy loop is whatever their current affliction with EVE gives them. I really mean current time, not their former days of fun and glory. 
---
Is it really the idea of losing an investment? If so, what kind of return do they hope to get in the future by logging in right now? I thought the only thing that counts as value in EVE is the fun you're having and maybe your assets and character. None of that is lost when you take a break.
---
Kenshi MMO when
---
Is this a dig at Goons because it sounds pretty Leet.
---
Hot dang, dude. I should just sit back and let you do this for me! Hell, just DM me and Ill just give you my password and you could do it all!
---
yeah, those poor rorquals that individually do ~1200 dps with 5 heavies or 1000 dps with sentries, while being able to tank a small subcapital fleet while under neut pressure, have a 5 minute invul button, and 100km remote repairs.
---
&gt;Looks like only \~40k more active ~~bots~~ NPCs to go. 
---
NPC lives matter
---
We moved 700 people on our initial op to Hakonen and for even day to day stuff we have been able to rage form 250 people into a fleet. Honestly, while Skillu are good at what they do if we wanted to force them out of somewhere, and assuming it was only INIT vs Skillu, they wouldn't stand a chance - that's an opinion purely based on numbers, i'm not trying to brag. 
---
You can only mine for so long, or stand so many "tackled send help" pings before you need to move everyone away from that mindset into a more aggressive one. 
---
Also fighting under a hostile super umbrella provides great experience for people and in the Age of Titans that experience can be invaluable. Every major Alliance has some form of super fleet to defend their home regions now so getting used to flying under one of the more competent hostile ones is a good opportunity.
---
Both sides know any mistake will be picked up by the other (reference: some of my bomber fleets - i'm not pando) and I think that makes things more exciting and not something that would happen if we stayed in J5A.
---
At the end of the day why does anyone do anything in Eve, mostly just because they can.
---
Love me some #kickwecu memes 
---
Still, do bear in mind that you have to pay a percentage to unlock it from asset safety. 
---
Same.
---
Looks like a good fight
---
That works, but much better to find a carrier/super bro to follow around.  He can create wrecks faster than you can salvage them, insanely good isk for a newbro.
---
Skip the orca, use a porpoise. At least you can warp out
---
Tip one don't lose 94 faction forts to Test....
---
Can't believe it, I have 50b invested in this project. Hopefully there will be a release of the investments back to those who backed it 
---
Not our fault that voltron is too pussy to dreadbomb
---
We all do. I also love some solo loki dying to pvp fit VNI memes. Ugh. Real talk, that one made my ass pucker, but alas. Even a blingly loki isnt meant to awkwardly land at 0 on a bait VNI. Mock that one all you want, cause I said we were competitive, not good. lol
---
Guess faxes are strategic assets as well, then, huh
---
TIL
---
But if you pvp and hate pve, the pve is there to get ready for pvp which will take time, or you can spend a few bucks and get straight into the pvp.
---
not sure if bait or retarded, the 3 titans and supers were dropped after SG and friends bailed to clean up and kill the structures. How about you tell us more about the nice fights with almost equal outcome in the beginning of the deployment where our titans were left home but instead you kept batphoning half of eve?
---
Titans only appear to be on Horde killmails and a couple caps + structure 5+ minutes after previous killsmails. Looks like fighting was basically done and they came in just to tell Horde (who arrived late) to go back home and clear up timers.
---
Grr gons grr snuf tho
---
Asset viewing and multiple character integration would be good. i haven't had a chance to check out your alpha yet but wanted to throw my 2 cents in for something I'd like to see outside of eve. If you are trying to make a do it all harvest to sale thing having blueprints and material lists and material of material lists could be cool as well.
---
You realize you just got snarky with Avare right? Wow the fucking entitlement of PH youth these days.

Haha

---
Welcome to 1999. 
---
looks like a pretty decent fight to me compared to most fights in 2019
---
oh my sweet yonis. get back to meming mate thats the only time you are effective
---
I also failed at checking his zkill first. Guy makes a living killing gankers on his ratting vni. Wont even make excuses, dude is better at killing people than I am. :P
---
I've been thinking about this. I jf my goo to jita but I don't typically have that pricey of a load. In this instance, would you make your final jump to the lowsec entry system, dock up, swap to bulkheads and slowboat to jita 3 times instead of just once? 
---

---
Stannis, is this you?
---
Kinda bummed out by all these 'botting' threads at the moment, it's pretty clear that CCP will never win the 'war on botting' because the aspects of the game where bots thrive are 10+ years old. They have been making these bots for [fucking years](https://i.imgur.com/cQlovxY.png)
---
Change these broken mechanics that shouldn't exist in todays eve and over night the bot numbers will die. Also the PvE fucking sucks, people buy ISK from RMTers because it's easier to spend ¬£10 on 2B than spend 6-7 hours smashing out your super ratting; the options for PvE are crap, i would rather see challenging, well paid, PvE on 1 account than 4 accounts AFK VNIing or 1 super/ titan/ carrier relatively untouchable prealigned to a POS/ citadel.
---
Not gonna nitpick over shit but there's alot of potential being wasted in the PvE system too, people say that bounties should be 'collectable' etc. Not gonna get into semantics about it. CCP fix your stupid pve.
---
Ps. Pls no ban capqu.
---
Point aside, the way in which you go about the presentation of your case is horrendous. 
---
Also this comes off as super-tinfoily. 
---
Redeemer 1bil, Super .. a lot more. quick math!
---
This stuff makes me so hot and sweaty at night. #pray4devblogs.
---
My apologies. Fixed.
---
thanks friend.
---
What I like about Z-S (and your pack, as well, although I tend to use Z_S) is that it‚Äôs generally easy to understand and I like the Z-S color - it would be nice if they could change the text boxes to allow for the easy coloration. 
---
In the end, I think it‚Äôs better to give new players the most information about othe players around them, and that‚Äôs what the PvP centric overviews do best. 
---
Fuck yeah, we're elite!
---
well yea, its to be expected, but its not "leet pvp" either, nothing to boast about 
---
L O L
---
I hear you. None of these costs are, on the face of it, prohibitively. You‚Äôre not not going to buy the pack because it‚Äôs 3 bucks. But it‚Äôs that 3 bucks, and the 20 for the train, and 5 bucks for coffee and a biscuit... add it all up, it‚Äôs costing you a bundle.
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not really that shocked about purchasing an item. It shouldn‚Äôt be about that, but on the other hand, look at what people with ‚Äòreal hobbies‚Äô spend. Try fishing. A former colleague of mine likes to fish, he‚Äôs got a gazillion and a half lures. I go: ‚ÄúSo, how many fishing rods do you have then for all those lures?‚Äù
---
- I have a shed.
---
‚ÄúSure, you‚Äôve got a 5 or 6 rods, you take out the boat, there you go.‚Äù
---
He looks at me like I‚Äôm stupid. ‚ÄúI have a shed full of fishing rods. Upwards of 100.‚Äù
---
Oh.
---
Add that up, rods, the lures, the boat, tackle, gas, a trailer for the car to pull the boat, permits, how much money do you want to spend?
---
Bicycle riding. You don‚Äôt see guys riding bicycles in clubs wearing an overcoat and a cap, riding granny‚Äôs bicycle. No no, good sir. They come decked out. $5,000 for a bike is the hoi polloi version, you need kit to wear, couple hundreds bucks, a good helmet, the right shoes. You‚Äôll spend 10 grand before you blinked.
---
It‚Äôs the same with every hobby. It‚Äôs all ‚Äòvery doable as a starter‚Äô. Sure it is. But you‚Äôre a starter for a few weeks and after that you see the guy who‚Äôs been at it for 10 years, tearing away with their fancy gear that they know how to use and why they have it. And you‚Äôre chugging along with your cheapo galactico n00b gear. So, what do you do? Out comes the wallet...
---
In that context, EVE, or most online games, is amazingly affordable. I‚Äôve heard people gripe about ‚Äúit costs $15/month :-(‚Äú. Dude, really? If I go out drinking and I sneeze twice, that‚Äôs $20 bucks right there.‚Äù I pay for a 3 monthly subscription. I can‚Äôt go for a night‚Äôs worth of beer for that money.
---
The thing is though: if you spent that money and you had a good time, you didn‚Äôt throw it away and you had a lot of fun for that money. I‚Äôve bought stuff for ‚Äònot much money‚Äô that I understood to be crap the moment I handed over the money. It‚Äôs just a 20 or so, but that‚Äôs money that‚Äôs gone and you got nothing out of that. -That- is expensive.
---
I‚Äôve never found people to play ‚ÄòMagic the Gathering‚Äô with, because it looks to me like it‚Äôs a lot of fun. It will cost something, but if I had fun while doing it... I‚Äôd spend that money.
---
Thanks for that perspective.
---
[hello](https://imgs.ovh/i/jA4M8c.png)
---
Phew, didn't make it to an olmeca mod bias thread
---
Only because they docked their faction titans ;)
---
hmmst 
---
We‚Äôve been nomadic, yes, but as I recall, Curse was always one of our permanent staging places, and we‚Äôve always had stuff there - some of my oldest ships are in Curse and I‚Äôve not been in INIT as long as some of the old guys. Pando and others have a shit ton of stuff up there. 
---
na dude. its high apm. 2b/h. i can only make myself do it like once a month which nets me like 5-10b before plex. when i loose my caps in site i loose +15b. maintaining a farm is work too. scanning, fuel etc. the risk of getting evicted when u cant login for a month. you can only do it if you have sites and in certain timezones due some groups actively rolling for c6 farmers to gank.
---
dont get me wrong its great isk but this 20 barges with skill extraction thing with a rorq that can safe its value in a depot plus the panic and the cyno to call in your umbrella sounds way more efficient and sutainable longterm. also netflixable :)
---
One day Olmeca will realise he isn't hated by just goons.

"It's funny because as soon as he flies into system now in his signature cyno malediction, they think he's about to drop them and all run off and cloak. Also just ignore the Titans we just undocked?"  
---
FTFY
---
Are you fucking kidding me? "Like with our Planet"... bitch please. 
---
Also, let's please look at what exactly PLEX are and how there happened to be such high demand for them. If you cherry pick, you're not getting the whole picture. Basically CCP hoped to increase demand for and thereby revenue from PLEX by a) making the game F2P and b) adding Skill Extractors to the game. They knew that there are people playing this game who will happily use their credit card to buy skill progression, if that was an option, because the same people formerly already bought ISK with PLEX. They also knew that there are people playing this game who PLEX their accounts by selling their in-game progress to the ones with the credit cards. 
---
CCP is and was the middle man by offering the link between credit card and in-game values. As you say, it's income for the company and that's fine. 
---
So, it's not the PLEX price that bothers me, but what a fucked up situation they allowed to happen in the game. Botting, super ratting, safe nullsec, respawn rates and so forth. Essentially it is still comfortably possibly to PLEX your accounts if you follow the nullbear playstyle, but not if you're doing anything else in the game. And that's fucked.
---
This certainly explains some things...
---
This is sad not because it's fake. It's sad because CCP never follows up on player suggestions, in any given form. More like they actively avoid doing anything players suggest them to do.
---
Now that you put up these ideas on paper, I now know for sure CCP will never put them in place...
---
All of your posts are pretty dumb.
---
spicy 
---
I stopped going there because everybody or thereabouts was using golden ammo.
---
At that point it becomes a rat race. also: if everybody‚Äôs got golden ammo nobody‚Äôs got golden ammo.
---
Anyway, I loved the game, because it was a lot of fun, but having to buy stuff the whole time got old and I just quit.
---
Your logic is flawed. "Hey, I need iskies.. I just buy some plex and sell them on the market. Thanks to buts I have to buy a lot less of those, so I spent less $ now and CCP makes less $ because of bots."
---
Olmeca might be kind of tinfoily sometimes, but he can occasionally make a good point.
---
Your answer is "no there isn't a counter just don't play."
---
Taking my CCP hat off for a moment, this is the most godawful and ridiculous thread I've seen on /r/eve so far this year.
---
Let's look at it in real talk:
---
&gt; CCP doesn't communicate with us nearly as often or to the depth that they used to. The years of dank devblogs showing the behind the scenes making of the game are over and have been since 2012.
---
There‚Äôs no doubt we‚Äôve been on the back foot in terms of communication recently, no denial of that at all. We're currently in middle of planning an entire world tour where we're going to be talking a hell of a lot about the future of EVE. There's going to be a little glimpse of that next week, then the first event is at the end of the month. Attendance numbers are already outstripping Fanfest 2018 for the events that are on sale, and we haven't even started selling tickets for Vegas or the events in the second half of the year.
---
We‚Äôre mega excited about what‚Äôs coming and we‚Äôre hoping that it‚Äôs going to translate to excitement for you guys too once we announce plans, but there‚Äôs a time and a place for us to do so once all the pieces of the puzzle line up.
---
The World Tour is part of a stronger message that we want more people engaged and playing the game and creating EVE Pulse is also the start of a fresh look at what we're doing going forward, but it's still in the early stages with only a couple of episodes under its belt.
---
&gt; Most or even largely all of its talented staff are gone and have moved on.
---
Not gonna lie, we've lost some incredible talent over the years and I've lost a lot of good friends as colleagues. That said, we now actually have more people working on EVE Online than we've had in the last half decade. 
---
We‚Äôve brought some incredible talent on board recently, but the issue is that these people are coming on board having worked in other areas of the games industry - the spin up time for learning to work on EVE - especially given it proprietary graphics and physics engine -  is a lot longer than just slotting into working on a game that's built in unreal 4 or an off the shelf equivalent.
---
The new starters we have are incredibly promising and we‚Äôve brought some people on board who have a wealth of experience. I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing what they‚Äôll bring to the table.
---
&gt; We haven't had a decent expansion since Citadel (No, abyssal space was not a good feature, still isn't) and before that, I would argue, for quite a long time measured in years.
---
That's a matter of opinion, I respect that. Everyone's opinion on whether content is good or bad depends on what they want out of the game. I've always been a PvPer, I've always wanted a dark and harsh universe. I love abyssal deadspace because I don't have the time to play EVE like I used to - 6-10-hour sessions are just not a possibility for me anymore, so it allows me to get my fix when I want, on my terms.
---
Each to their own in this respect. You‚Äôre not right, but you‚Äôre also not wrong. Opinions are like that.
---
&gt; CCP Falcon doesn't really give a shit to actually own up to communicating about problems for months at a time
---
This is a very personal stab at me for some reason.
---
I've put seventeen years into EVE Online as a player, volunteer, contractor and now an employee. I wouldn't be so crass as to toot my own horn about how long I spend working each day, but I've done my fair share and have immense respect for so many other people I work with who go above and beyond their station every day. There's an intense, almost cult-like love for EVE Online at CCP from the roots of a new starter at CCP to the guys who‚Äôve been here long enough to get a sword twice over.
---
Not many things get under my skin, but I‚Äôll be honest that I‚Äôm genuinely offended by the insinuation that I don‚Äôt care about EVE or about the community. I‚Äôve spent the last 7 years as a CCPer fighting for what‚Äôs right for New Eden and our players, even when it‚Äôs meant going completely against the grain internally and being savagely critical.
---
I could say more, but I don‚Äôt think my boss would appreciate the amount of foul language I‚Äôd use.
---
&gt; CCP also doesn't care much for the community anymore, as displayed by nixing the alliance tournament.
---
As we‚Äôve pointed out repeatedly, the alliance tournament is not gone. Just the same as Fanfest, it‚Äôs on hiatus for 2019 while priorities are elsewhere, and we look at how to better execute on it. Just the same as Fanfest, we fully expect it to return.
---
The announcement that we‚Äôre postponing is of course being used in abundance as ammunition by people who want to speculate on doom and gloom. We fully expected this and it‚Äôs just one of those things we must live with. I‚Äôll see you guys from the desk during Alliance Tournament XVII.
---
&gt; All they are doing now is focusing squarely on microtransactions and the new eden store at the behest of their new korean overlords.
---
I‚Äôve had the pleasure of talking to a few people at Pearl Abyss and they‚Äôre just the same as CCP ‚Äì a big pile of nerds who love making video games. Do I agree with all their design choices for their titles? No. Do they agree with all the choices CCP have made for EVE Online and our other projects? Probably not. The fact of the matter is that they‚Äôre great people who share the same love for making games as us. 
---
I‚Äôd far rather that CCP was owned by a group of people who‚Äôve literally told us that the main priority is to make amazing games rather than a bunch of venture capitalists who are more interested in what the bottom line reads at the end of the quarter. I feel way more secure in the fact that we‚Äôre working with a likeminded company over people who just want to make money. It gives me a LOT of hope for the future of the EVE Universe.
---
That said, there‚Äôs no ulterior motive here. Are we focusing more on the New Eden Store? No, but I‚Äôm sure from some points of view that given we‚Äôve been quite about feature development for a while it seems that way.
---
&gt; They've killed every other game because they keep attempting to find the magic of what made EVE great and unique while also wholly avoiding what made EVE great and unique.
---
If you understood the fundamentals of the games industry, you‚Äôd understand that there‚Äôs all kinds of concepting going on at pretty much every company. Most of these concepts never see the light of day because they‚Äôre nixed early on or just don‚Äôt make the cut when it comes to vertical slice. Diversification, even within a single IP, is a good thing to make sure that you continue to do solid business.
---
My personal opinion on this is that one of the things we‚Äôre very guilty of here at CCP sometimes is talking about things too early. Whether that‚Äôs feature development for EVE or announcing a new project, we‚Äôre often super excited about what we‚Äôre working on and we tend to start talking about things when they‚Äôre in the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù stage.
---
This is part and parcel of the strange and unique relationship we‚Äôve always had with the community where we‚Äôre typically very open about what‚Äôs going on and we‚Äôre super willing to talk about things happening behind the scenes. It‚Äôs both a blessing and a curse and has bitten us in the ass a few times for sure.
---
&gt; CCP isn't bold anymore is the problem. 
---
It‚Äôs true that we‚Äôve taken a beating in the last few years, but we still have seriously ambitious long-term plans for EVE Online and the EVE Universe. Taking a beating is par for the course in the games industry when you‚Äôre a company that‚Äôs lasted for two decades. Not a month goes by when you don‚Äôt hear about a studio that‚Äôs hit with controversy or has had to cut a percentage of its staff. It rips my guts out every time I hear about a round of layoffs or a project being cancelled.
---
It‚Äôs painful to watch, but when the dust settles it‚Äôs always awesome to see the people who‚Äôre let go move on to awesome things. It‚Äôs also a testament to the games industry to see how many people who work in this community dust themselves off and dive right back into the same field of work because they‚Äôre so passionate about making video games.
---
Seven years ago, I came from heavy manufacturing to the games industry because of that passion with the full understanding that in a couple of years I might be heading back there with a sore ass after a round of layoffs or an unsuccessful change of career. I consider myself incredibly lucky to still be here, doing what I love to do.
---
&gt; They've become lax and lazy while they attempt to find their footing in the age of loot boxes and bullshit microtransactions.
---
I‚Äôm an adamant hater of lootbox culture, but I‚Äòll admit that I‚Äôve opened a few crates in RocketLeague and Heroes of the Storm.
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt feel that there‚Äôs a place for it in EVE Online, because I‚Äôm a purist when it comes to the EVE Universe. 
---
Then again, I‚Äôve always been super direct that because of the fact I‚Äôm an EVE purist I was vehemently opposed to the idea of skill trading when it was initially floated as an idea, but now it‚Äôs with us and the world hasn‚Äôt ended. In fact, I‚Äôve heard a lot of good stories that have come out of it in terms of people being able to re-spec or quickly build characters.
---
As for microtransactions, they‚Äôre simply a hallmark of the evolution of the games industry at this stage. I don‚Äôt particularly like them but I‚Äôm not going to get bent out of shape over them personally. I can still enjoy gaming without the need to spend more than I‚Äôm comfortable with.
---
Seek help.
---
Oh, thanks. 
---
Fantastic post. Finally someone found out the truth and isnt afraid to speak.
---
That sounds pretty racist to me tbh.
---
do i qualifiy as bittervet. Only play since 2014 and have only 72m sp.
---
Oh yes, when he gets his head out of his ass he can be pretty smart dude.
---
A complete idiot couldn't pull off the booshing he does but besides that, holy fuck.
---
&gt;  that point it becomes a rat race. also: if everybody‚Äôs got golden ammo nobody‚Äôs got golden ammo.
---
The only way to "win" at their games is play clever and NOT use golden ammo. That means learn the strong and weak points or all tanks (ships/whatever).
---
Also, the playerbase, which is in general much younger than in EvE for instance was unbearable at times as well. 
---
But that's exactly what i meant.
---
You assign the target and bounty to a "bounty hunter corp" which the target is no part of. So he can't claim the bounty himself.
---
I also said the payout value could be closer to ship value than it is now. But not the whole payout for cheap shit.
---
I'm  sorry, but I get the impression you didn't read before replying.

Wow I thought your normal posting was bad, this is almost so bad that it rivals AAD posting in the GSF forums, which is impressive.
---
Link your main kiddo
---
its the same fleet super moron
---
&gt; the options for PvE are crap, i would rather see challenging, well paid, PvE on 1 account than 4 accounts AFK VNIing or 1 super/ titan/ carrier relatively untouchable prealigned to a POS/ citadel.
---
I agree whole heartedly and completely.
---
No matter what I did, I could never make PvE engaging or fun. It was always a grind.
---
Its not a surprise that rorquals under super umbrellas are so popular. Its fire and forget basically. Throw on netflix and chill. 
---
&gt; The Goon discord logs
---
There are definitely a lot of things why I like being in goons. Not using discord is in the top 3.
---
Google "Be in NC."
---
Thanks!
---
Seriously, I feel attacked
---
It's finally happened. Olmeca Gold is Delve Goons' Gevlon Goblin.
---
this has to be the best bait post ive ever seen
---
Olmeca going grrr goons consipiracy on reddit and discord? No different from the other block doing the same. Both as bad as each other and no cunt cares, more news at 10....
---
&gt;realized that they better polish the fuck out of it and work out everything before they let it go live 
---
lol nice joke m8 10/10. tell that to CCP when 64 bit client gets released and the game plunges into complete disarray with shit breaking left and right.
---
I did some quick math, and between all my accounts and some plex purchases, over the last decade plus I've spent probably close to 5k USD on eve.  At first it was more challenging as a poor college kid ect, but now with a real job and working full time, 400 USD for subs (4 accounts at 99$ sales that happen basically every year), and like 450$ for plex once in a while is a no brainer to not have to work and be able to play the game instead of work at it. 
---
Is it jabber? Thought they were discord lol.
---
Got a better idea: bounty gives you a sp boost. The higher the bounty you have the higher the SP boost
---
We would be worried his account got hacked, if it wasn't super-tinfoily.
---
The reason that rorqs are so popular too is scalability. It's not often talked about but the idea is that you make money for doing less things, so you could have a rorq and make 1/2 - 1/3 of the isk of a ratting super, but you get those 3 rorqs and you're making as much as a super with alot less effort. Also the reason why VNIs are so popular. but TL:DR excavators shouldn't be drones, they should be fighter type things.
---
100 $ is what i spend a week on weed. 
---
Yeah, we use jabber.
---
&gt; 1) Here, /u/koahi

 says that they are waiting for me to say something dumb
---
i mean

Are we really going to have that godwin conversation ? Do you really believe I am saying that chinese IPs should be locked because I am racist ? It's a matter of fact that most cheaters and botter in games are chinese or russian, that fact is not my fault mate. 
---
I like what you do in Delve Olmeca
---
Why is it so?
---
Imagine ripping rigs and replacing them with T1 when snuff arrive to save KB efficiency ü§£

I love you.

---
&gt; PS: I wanted to post these logs, but was afraid of getting banned. So I first had to explain the situation to /u/ZeldenGM, and get his permission to post them. Even this fear shows the kind of unfair advantage Goons have over me.
---
Wait a minute. You think there's goon bias in the moderation team even though they're happy to let you post _all evidence of this supposed bias_?
---
Olmeca I'm hardly one to defend goon culture especially when it comes to doxxing/harassment, but if they're living rent free in your head like that you should probably disengage from reddit for a bit for the sake of your own mental well being.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people keep nagging about the subscription price, or PLEX.
---
The EVE pilot demographic is [mostly, I‚Äôm not ignoring the women!] adult males in their late 20s, early 30s. The kind of people that will blow money on beer on a Saturday night like it‚Äôs going out of style [also, but this is just hearsay: some of them claim to be smoking weird plants while they‚Äôre flying. I have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about, but that‚Äôs going to cost something too, right?]
---
I‚Äôve said it earlier, I‚Äôll say it again: EVE is cheap. Your subscription money and PLEX purchases keep the developers coding.
---
You *cannot* have it both ways: you can‚Äôt expect a fantastic universe like that to do in as you please [something most other games will kick your ass six ways from Sunday for] and not pay a dime for it. Be fucking serious.
---
Not paying for it leads to being sold to a company that does not understand the game, the environment, the ethos, the players and the history. They want money. They -only- want money.
---
The real thing is this: you can‚Äôt dum down EVE to the point where ‚Äòeverybody will play it‚Äô, because it is by now its own entity. It is, quite literally, a living work of art. It has transcended being merely a game. That doesn‚Äôt lend itself to easy monetising, other than what OP rightfully claims: when EVE goes away, there is not going to be something else, something better. That won‚Äôt be made. Star Citizen may be a candidate. I‚Äôll bet that after its release, somewhere after 2082, it‚Äôs going to be amazing. Until then though, EVE is it.
---
EVE has something that no other game has, and why you won‚Äôt see it anywhere else: EVE is real.
---
I‚Äôm just a nobody but I‚Äôm pretty sure we wouldn‚Äôt have deployed to your doorstep if you guys never logged in. 
---
oof
---
Try SF Spectre Fleet or Bombers Bar public fleets.
---
someone work very well on his subject
---
Holy shit, this guy is using "discord" like "kleenex" or "xerox." I must be getting old, because this makes me really angry for some reason.
---
I would feel bad to fight in the same side as this guy indeed
---
I remember the good old days when Panfam was told not to post on reddit. I miss those days. 
---
~~I forgot the /s my bad.~~
---
Have all those titan pilots doing PI. ez clap
---
Ez, just become a mod and ban all gons.
---
I‚Äôd just like to clarify that you didn‚Äôt *have* to get my permission to post this. 
---
I‚Äôve no issue with people posting EVE related content here. What I have taken issue with is modmails claiming modbias in instances where posts have been removed for legitimate reasons, or by automoderator without prejudice.
---
It's really more a state of mind/philosophy than a time thing
---
Why is what so?
---
he is also the one who made a post 1 week ago to personally harass a guy ratting in a dumb fit calling him pleb and mocking the fact he was a vet etc, but well usual Olmeca post
---
To be fair, Snuff dropped titans at end of fight, they did nothing during the fight. So " Snuffed can only take the grid" is wrong statement.
---
But Snuff titans made SGGRN's dreads unusable except few beam revs (who will use dread if titans can dropped on your head anytime). 
---
Also SGGRN was forced to warp off cuz snuff started log on their titans (only 3 jumped to grid, but there was more).
---
So not committing dreads on field and end of this fun brawl was kinda Snuff's decision, We used dread a lot when snuff's titans were on black rise.
---
Blame Hy and Tau, but anyway was very fun.
---
MRW shark week is over

this is literally the best thing ever

What am I supposed to call Kleenex?

He's gone full gevlon.

Hell, I buy that much every couple weeks.

Koahi doesn‚Äôt say mean things. This is obviously fake news. 
---
You can extract some next level salt from people in that game for that reason. Someone spends 400 dollars on a big ship, and I just delete them with a little 70 dollar boat. People lose their damn minds when it happens lol

Why is &lt;WHYSO&gt;?
---
&gt; Wait a minute. You think there's goon bias in the moderation team even though they're happy to let you post all evidence of this supposed bias?
---
I did not generalize the bias to the entire mod team. Zelden is not a Goon. I think Goon mods are biased. I think they let me post stuff because they don't have full control. I've been banned from many other places which they do.
---
&gt; the playerbase, which is in general much younger than in EvE for instance was unbearable at times as well.
---
Ain‚Äôt that the goddamned truth!
---
Becoming better is one thing, but in the end you‚Äôre just not beating the guy who‚Äôs going to clobber you before you have a chance to respond. I‚Äôve hit plenty of guys dead centre and the shell bounced off the armour like a pebble hitting a steel wall. They on the other hand, would shoot you and it was as if you were using a news paper for armour.
---
A great game, great graphics, wonderful atmosphere, lots of nice tanks. Too many kids mewling over bullshit and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to report you!‚Äô. When you then think about what happens in EVE... ‚ÄúSure, sweetheart, go get yourself a lollipop.‚Äù
---
I really don‚Äôt mind paying for a great experience, it‚Äôs debased by the need to constantly having to buy top gear to be able to be competitive.
---
:iiam:
---
You know this guy work his subject when he think we use discord, he must be incredibly right about everything he said in this post (stop reading after seeing who made this, even my 6 year old sister lie better) 
---
damn, that reads pretty close to a real dev blog.  if i were to copy paste this onto a CCP site template. no one would ever imagine it wasn't real.
---
props for the effort =D
---
&gt; Goons are metagaming against people with other views
---
I am shocked, SHOCKED I tell you!

"Tissues."

You‚Äôd collect your own bounty to take the heat off you

That‚Äôs a made up word

lolmeca gold
---
That is developing economically the same as Serenity, gues you did not understood what I said ...
---
yeah turn your monitor on to see it lol
---
snuff seems to have a very big problem not understanding that people just don't want to feed them, cause we all know the moment they lose the upper hand the titans will come, as they always do.
---
w8 goons control reddit?
---
i thought that was test o.0
---
It's perfectly viable to enjoy highsec level 3 missions without even subbing I don't get why people complain
---
Lmao I know its pathetic isnt it?
---
Kinda like how several Snuffed pilots will eject from ships before dying lul

I hope that jibrish permabans you
---
Oh look a space cowboy
---
Pretty sure that that's the joke m8
---
you're a made up word
---
So its just people talking about you on our Jabber? It should be obvious you're not gonna get praise there.
---
omg so it is true - you are better than 'goblin'
---
Even this post is too well reasoned for falcon
---
Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Predatory Modding Real Hahahaha Olmeca Just Walk Away From The Screen Like Brutor Close Your Eyes Haha
---
It doesn't, but while PLEX was worth less 7 years ago, it was also that much easier to pay for your game time via in-game activites. 2.1B invested in goods with prices that cycled every 2-4 weeks meant making enough off the profits that getting to 350M a month took a lot less effort from my active income activities. All leftover profits got pushed right back to my station trading char, so it didn't stay 2.1B for long. Once you make it to 50B invested in the market it becomes a question of how much money you really want.
---
I had a good run as a bounty hunter once upon a time. 
---
Farmed the same guy in the Amarr FW zone.  Dude was a dishonorable asshole that liked flying blingy frigates and had like 200mil of bounty on his head.  
---
I was getting something like 20mil every time I killed him.  
---
tl;dr
---
harsh but sadly true
---
Nice try spy
---
Ok, can anyone explain to me why Olmeca has this obsession for goons? I mean i think he is at a point where if you  read tomorrow someone stabs someone olemca is going to say it was goons doing
---
Automod is goon
---
Dude they obviously aren't going to ban him/delete this post now. It would only further his message now that it has some attention.
---
I don't like Olmeca, news at 11. 
---
The 'deal' with Zelden was he banned you because you PM'd mod mail every single time someone down voted you or said they didn't like you. You PM'd us constantly about all kinds of low tier petty stuff. Your 'deal' was don't do that. If you all want an example of the kinds of shit Olmeca wastes our time with, have at it:
---
https://pastebin.com/ZnG5GYCZ
---
&gt; Here, they are proudly talking about how they banned me from r/Eve discord channel.
---
Yes. I banned you from a shit posting discord server. I did not ban you from reddit. In fact, you are still posting right now about goonbias or whatever. I would love to ban you from reddit but you haven't done anything (ever since you stopped spamming the hell out of modmail). For that, I didn't ban you either - Zelden did. Discord and r/eve are not the same thing. One is decent mostly and the other is a cesspit of garbage memes. 
---
I get that you are very bothered that I don't like you. Maybe it's because you post garbage goonbias mod threads all the time - even when you have nothing? Maybe it's because you spammed us in modmail every time someone said something you didn't like? Maybe it's because you cry in modmail when someone calls you lonely?
---
https://imgur.com/hULA7o3
---
&gt; TLDR: Goons are actively trying to isolate alternative (or enemy) voices from the community, including the subtle use of reddit modding to do so. 
---
You got any evidence there bud? You're framing this as if I'm getting orders from Mittani to silence you or that a video game alliance has some conspiracy to control reddit - the evidence you presented is *literally me saying I approved one of your posts despite not liking you*. Right [here](https://i.imgur.com/mNQD22e.jpg). Did you even bother to read your own logs or did you just see someone mentioned you + reddit and then ran to cry about it?
---
goons do not hate olmeca at all, he is our new gevlon. we loved gevlon
---
Kill rights are available for this suicide ganker flying a catalyst.  Sweet!    
---
900,000,000 isk to activate.
---
No, what you are proposing to do would just lead to the same, if not worse problem that injectors have. If an aspect of the game becomes broken good ( rorqs and super ratter) you can just inject into them on day 1, making the problem worse. If you train unlocated SP you end up with injectors that you haven't payed for 
---
&gt; Kinda like how several Snuffed pilots will eject from ships before dying lul
---
That changes literally nothing on the killboard? They still show up as snuff losses unless for SG/SC etc are boarding these ships and dying in them
---
&gt; I'm  sorry, but I get the impression you didn't read before replying.
---
No, you didn't explain yourself clearly. It makes some sense now.
---
has this guy ever seen posting on something awful or are all modern eve players ignorant of where are roots are
---
I wouldn't call r/eve a "cesspit of garbage memes"
---
#eve-deu btw
---
goons are all bots so this fits
---
did that, outside of your coolaid fueled fantasy, ever happen tho?
---
"you shouldn't be trying to have fun if you aren't making enough money"  
---
Sometimes you don't have a choice in your circumstances, but you do have a choice how you spend your free time. Notice that I said "when I was underemployed" which would suggest that I solved that problem AND successfully did isk grinding.
---
&gt; In the end, I think it‚Äôs better to give new players the most information about othe players around them, and that‚Äôs what the PvP centric overviews do best.
---
I generally agree with this, but sometimes there are as many players around you who are friendly as those who are hostile. PVP overviews - other than those crazy people who small-gang with every single ship on their overviews - tend to filter some of that context out. I think learning that situational awareness is valuable to new players, so I'd argue my pack is perhaps too focused for a brand new player. It makes sense if you're in an alliance straightaway - if you sign up and go to Horde or tapi or to karmafleet - but if you're just bumbling around hisec on your own, I'm less sure.
---
Plus I have no fucking idea if my mining preset is any good or not.

I'm surprised you guys haven't perma'd him already.

/u/ZeldenGM &lt;3 for helping him to post this !

Such victimhood on display here. You really have to have a warped sense of the world to think this suggests the mods are breaking any rules.

You know what is the best here ... i think it is not bait post, but he actually is serious :D

&gt; 3- A high PLEX as it is now is toxic for the game.

It's certainly toxic for the people who plex accounts, but keep in mind that

2. you're not actually CCP's customer

Beep Boop 011001101reporting in, Sir!
---
The most positive thing that could be said about this idea is that it would be so incredibly niche that it would a waste of developer time to implement.
---
With all this ISK you get from excavators - have you ever considered employing/funding some elite alliance to fight the goons?      
---
Like Darwinism. they are near and dislike goons.          
---
i might be blind but i see 3 here, when we consider how many dds single dread can take before it dies(2-3, depends on dread) and the fact that after insurance it isnt rly big cost you should be able to get enough dreads to kill at least 2-3 of them(esp that your megablob voltron coalition+batphones are like 25k chars and its like our worst tz), but yea, keep looking for excuses to be pussy

This mod deleted my posts based off of pure personal bias, and then shit talked me in mod mail when I asked why. The post was a good meme that most people on this sub would chuckle at, although it did slightly poke fun at goons. He cited some vague rule from r/eve that is not factually based but extremely opinionated. Meanwhile posts like this https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/av0vmi/mining_yield_show_off_thread/ made by goon members are allowed to remain on this sub.

dude get real nobody actually wants pvp, it's an outdated playstyle. adapt more friends and get more accounts to build a REAL ECONOMY nanofag retard. boxing 40 rorqs takes effort unlike passive income rental exploited cheated dark money isk from casinos

&gt;Here, [/u/koahi](https://www.reddit.com/u/koahi) says that they are waiting for me to say something dumb

Mission accomplished!

Beep beep fellow goon
---
Damn his post knock my self preservation instincts off. 
---
&gt; I can go outside and make 500 plex per hour by collecting bottles 
---
I can't, because they aren't worth anything here and because my neighbors aren't litterbugs. But even if at that time I could spend a few hours hustling to get a few tens, that money was needed elsewhere and STILL wouldn't have paid for my game.
---
However, I could gank, scam, and PVE my way to paying for a few accounts with maybe 20 hours worth of effort in a month, and do that when I had no earning opportunities to pass up.
---
This is blatantly a lie. No-one ever has to wait for him to say something dumb.
---
Yep the titans staged in the next system over would totes not log in and drop if a dread bomb for 2 titans formed.

It's whoever you need it to be to fit your conspiracy of the moment.

Notice how other people who didn't like my post made 1-2 comments. You chose to post 5 comments in 10 minutes. And you don't even have a stake in the Goon machine lol. You do it all for attention and affirmation. Sad really.

TQ is nowhere near developing the same way as Serenity. Serenity literally has RMT function built in to the character sheet where you can sell isk and botting is almost never banned, that is not the case on TQ.

C4 WH space is poison to children's minds and it creates a fake world for them to live in, they think they are safe from HK and LZHWK seeding 250 caps in their azbel, or from the inevitable 60 man TDSIN gila blob out for their rorqual but they are wrong and delusional, this will happen. C4 causes radiated autism which created anime and furries and this introduces pornographic material at a young age and has very graphic and violent scenes which rots your children from the inside. This carries over into adulthood and creates these lazy, nasty, hideous slobs that were once your children that now sleep with an anime/furfag body pillow at night and read mangas at least 10 times a day, this was caused because C4s take a long to time to scan to find content and this rots the brain, just like spodbrain. C4 scanning also consumes your soul and wastes time that could be used to go outside, get 60 minutes of fresh air, do homework and contribute something to society. The people who live in wolf rayets are not the problem, C4s are the problem, think about it, if C4s were deleted, the current C4 corps would move to the next cancer, Wolf rayets, and kill the current degenerates using stabbed cerberus (after their reload killed like 7 sabres of course) living there. C4 WH space is the root of all problems, cancer, war, Africa, anime, furries and Nazis. Since people have to scan sooo much for content on the monitor screen for hours, it uses electricity and is the reason why the oil reserves will run out soon.
---
C4 space causes cancer because it has been proven monitor screens emit radiation and radiation causes uncurable spodbrain cancer. spodbrain has caused war by inspiring the Nazis to side with the Japanese through their cartoons and establishing the Pacific Front in World War 2. African leaders in Africa are corrupted by spodbrain addiction inflicted in C4 wolf rayets as well anime and furry influences caused by this and they cannot tend to their peoples needs and cannot feed them. Future generations of wormholers will be ruined and destroyed by the C4 influence. Everyone thinks the downfall of humanity will be ourselves, but in reality it is spodbrain C4 rorquals . After the atomic radiation, the Japanese wanted to get their revenge on the world and created their ultimate weapon C4 wormholes, which led to the creation of anime, furries, nazis and commies.

This is what V2 is for.

&gt; Goons actively try to 'trigger' people or mentally harass them othewise, to get them isolated, get them kicked from community channels, and make them look bad. 
---
To be fair, isn't that just the default goon behaviour? i mean they were never known for being nice :P
---
Your jabber has 27 mentions of me and pages of conversation about me in a week. I am obsessed with you.
---
Never. Btw, new skins available in store.
---
tbh It's very clever move, It has lower change to get podded by smartbomb.
---
Oh look olmecqa is being a dumbo. Man, the reasons are in the same logs you've brought! E.g. deperately annoying the mod team by spamming their mails? I don't know any resource, eve related or not, that tolerates this. All you do is just shitty bullshit rhetorics and straight fucking demagogy with a straight face.
---
Also its good that you didn't edit the flood out. There are quite a few clear tips that explain the statements you demagogy'ed out of the logs.
---
Not that there were CCP announcements on the NPC AI, that they want to overhaul ALL NPC towards the new AI used by Drifters and Incursion rats. 
---
Then there was that meeting when someone said "Wait, we lose all that botted PvE-Account subs, and we need bloated sub numbers if we wanna cash out, we cannot do this!!!"
---
Yes. And I think we should talk about it.

Meanwhile, Candy Crush still makes like 800-900 million a year.

---
&gt; 'trigger' people or mentally harass them othewise, to get them isolated, get them kicked from community channels, and make them look bad.
---
???
---
if rorquals did PI maybe
---
Only if there's a significant risk to the person who has the bounty on them.
---
Skillpoint loss based on bounty tier would be the only thing I could think of right off, but that would be explicitly abused.
---
Without a risk for someone cashing in the bounty, it will never be a significant working system.
---
Which comes back to risk-aversion. It lead to the "blue donut". It's why citadel mechanics are what they are. It's why Rorqs have a panic module that lasts as long as it does. It's why almost every major entity in Eve is stationary and why we've had so many disappointing and unfulfilling battles in recent history: even though most large alliances should have a massive reserve of wealth and assets and be able to weather heavy losses, they're afraid to commit to uncertain fights.
---
pot meet kettle :P
---
High sec is the end game content. No booshers no caps just brawl like man
---
I agree with everything you said, scalability and lack of input. 
---
Skillpoint loss.
---
Skillpoints are the only persistent thing you can lose in this game, and they've already taken away all the risk to losing them.
---
Other than that, there's no risk in having a bounty, no matter how high.
---
Yeah Titans, the ones you are now forced to drop instead of whelping your Muninn fleets to us. 
---
For a sub par fc you sure have a loud mouth :D
---
you're actually batshit crazy dude, get some help
---
When people say that, they're making the point that nullsec has become too safe, not that highsec is too dangerous.  You're still **relatively** safe (it's still Eve, you're never totally safe) in high as long as you're not flying something overly blingy or otherwise overloaded in value.  War decs can only target corps with structures now, and gankers mostly target high-value freighters/mision running boats.  So long as you don't make yourself a target you're likely fine.
---
As for the rest, number 1 advice I can give is to find an overview pack you like and use it, don't try to make your own or worse yet, use the default one.  Number 2 would be find a community/corp to play with, and be willing to try several if necessary.  Eve is all about playing with and against other people, don't isolate yourself.
---
lets try
---
goons are fucking retarded
---
Would be pretty dank in w-space where you often have 20+ sigs to scan
---
I applaud you good sir, this is very well the best meme bait in the past month or two. Not only do you manage to include the #down with the mods movement, but you also include the #grrr goons movement in a single stroke. Masterful if i do say so myself, I look forward to the memeologycal compositions in your future. Godbless
---
you make it very easy to appreciate goons for the simple fact that i want to have as little things in common with you as possible
---
If you think about it, I bet many of them were miners.
---
Mine fewer.
---
Even Kenneth Arrow would have never thought of this.
---
Just imagine trying, like the Aridians do to INIT., some dreadbombs die, some not. But 1st you have to try, insert Wayne Gretzky here
---
What difference would a Bumper do? I mean, the Garmur sure had a scrams to hold that ship where he was O.o
---
&gt; E.g. deperately annoying the mod team by spamming their mails? 
---
That convo was about me experiencing a bug. I did not mention mod bias until mod mentioned it. After that, I just said it exists, which led to a ban.

Lovely sarcasm. 10/10

Sounds decent.

April Changes - Removal Of Neutral Assitance
---
Following the round of high priority loophole closures and bugfixes in March, we are also prepping a set of changes to the mechanics around highsec ‚Äúneutral assistance‚Äù for the April release.
---
Removal of neutral assistance
---
Under current mechanics, if a neutral character applies a remote assistance module (such as a remote repairer) to another character they can receive a suspect flag if their target meets all of the following conditions:
---
    is involved in a war (including normal wars or FW)
---
    does not share a corp/alliance (or FW side if the war in question is the FW war) with the assistor
---
    is engaged in PVP (has a capsuleer logoff timer)
---
As well, area of effect command bursts currently apply to every member of a pilot‚Äôs fleet that is within range, without distinction for whether those fleet members are at war.
---
In both of these cases, the resulting gameplay can be frustrating and unfun as combatants cannot effectively engage neutral repair ships until they activate their modules and cannot engage neutral command bursting ships at all without incurring CONCORD‚Äôs wrath.
---
Recently the bulk of the community feedback we‚Äôve been seeing on these particular issues has been in favor of making direct changes to remove these tactics.
---
After the April release, the penalty for direct targeted neutral assistance meeting the conditions above AND occurring within highsec will become a criminal flag and CONCORD response. The safety system will prevent the activation of the targeted assistance modules under these conditions, so we suggest that support pilots in highsec engage their safety at either green or yellow levels to prevent unintentional CONCORDOKKEN.
---
For area of effect command bursts we are approaching the problem a little differently as you may want to continue boosting the members of your fleet that are not involved in a war. Therefore, after the April release neutral command bursts will simply not affect a pilot that meets the conditions listed above when activated in highsec space.
---
The increased penalty for neutral targeted assistance will also apply to limited engagements (such as those caused by duels) but for performance reasons we won't be preventing command bursts from applying to pilots in limited engagements.
---
Neither of these changes impact assisting your corpmates or alliancemates in a war (since you‚Äôre in the same war as them), and neither of these changes apply to lowsec (the penalty for targeted neutral assistance in lowsec will continue to be a suspect flag just like today).
---
There are counters, I just told you them. If you dont have enough brain cells to figure out a counter to a cloaky boi then that is your own problem.
---
I've had a few hundred of millions on me and never felt any heat worth taking off (killrights on the other hand, can be a PITA). The kind off people accruing big bounties are the one welcoming all the heat they can get in any case.
---
Maybe you just do not know why? Because Smartbombs of hugging BS waiting to kill your slaves ... JFYI
---
Mate, some of your posts are ok / pretty funny, and I‚Äôm all for you disrupting goons and having fun, but this is pure bullshit. You were banned for acting like a twat, get over it. 
---
You're a high profile character that posts about us for a year+ and is highly active in our space. Everyone from Imperium can join these channels and talk and they're highly active. Of course you're gonne get mentioned in there lmao
---
As was explained to you, repeatedly, in mod mail - your post got removed because of the BIG BOLDED LETTERS AT THE TOP OF THE RULES. You also posted it during Shark week.
---
Here is what you posted: https://i.redd.it/1frqe1oj2zi21.jpg
---
You have 100 reddit warriors and mods trying to get me isolated, just because you don't like what I do ingame. Ofc I will post about it.
---
Man, really. Get a life.
---
Do you need help? b4r, we will be all glad to help you out. Just stop being a smug attention whore you are and seek aid. We are all human after all.
---
reminder posting on reddit is against skill urself rules
---
strike 1
---
Aren't you the guy who bases his content , his reason for eve , his 20+ accounts all in the name of shitting up delve ? 
---
The dude hasn't really denied this. If he's up front with it, what's wrong with doing that?
---
I have jumped twice lmao. First one was a lowkey trollop I FC'd. We were supposed bridge from 7RM to 6RQ to troll FedUp sov. Totally jumped to a rat and bumped 100KM off it, solo, right next to a cyno, with a fedup gatecamp two systems over. Lucky, no one saw besides the fleet of like 25 hordlings. Big oof there.
---
The other time was a HD fleet from C4C. Luckily Belter had taken over the fleet by the time I had bridged like 10 times then mistakenly clicked jump, so there was a friendly super fleet on grid. 
---
Funny enough everytime I bridged completely shitfaced everything went okay, besides me putting the cyno in the wrong system but who cares, it was drunk fleet lol
---
Yep I am definitely looking to group up after I get my bearings.
---
Thank you for bringing up Overview pack, is this one ok?:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Installing_the_EVE_University_Overview
---
Apparently it is Z-S Overview with some modifications.
---
just buy the bot pack
---
Banned from where?
---
**tl;dr** OP believes there's a concerted, deliberate conspiracy on the part of Goons to alienate, harass, and manipulate him into rage quitting or doing something that would ban him from /r/eve or other platforms.
---
Look, you should be flattered Goons talk about you at all. You're not that important, in-game or on social media, and 99% of the time Goons are all about shitposting, memes, and general Eve gameplay. There's no interconnectivity, no master plan, no conspiracy, and certainly no planned harassment of you or anyone else. 
---
Besides, Elysium is like the bar on Tattooine, and gs_isk is not much better. Not exactly reliable sources of intel.
---
Human to human, I think you need to take a step back from the game. Take a break for awhile. The tinfoil hat is a bit too tight, and you're so wound up you're starting to sound like a genuine conspiracy theorist. You're a smart guy, and incredibly dedicated in what you do, but in all seriousness you're taking it a bit too far and I'm honestly concerned for your mental well-being.
---
Soulless machines!
---
Cast them out with the input broadcasters.
---
/r/eve doesn't represent the majority of players, only a percentage. If people were as upset as they seem here, people would stop buying PLEX altogether. But they don't.
---
qq bitch
---
Didn't say anything about orchestrated efforts. It's more like a cultural thing they need to get rid of.
---
Darwinism a threat to goons? Lol k
---
if you could read and comprehend the text, i said there have been bots from the start, and they arent influencing pex price any more than before. Stop blaming bots and blame all the newbro alliances that have thousands of legit players/crabs
---
Well yeah but that‚Äôs because bounties are pointless to try and collect right now. If the payout was adjusted to be worthwhile then the danger of having a large bounty goes up and therefore so does the advantage of exploiting the mechanics. 
---
It's the only explanation I can think of, tbh.
---
Dont even bother deleting your post, it's already screenshotted for the comedy gold collection
---
Put diamond rat AI into anomoly rats. Reduce the number of rats so payout is the same or whatever but make it more involved than bots can handle
---
This is the kind of petty popcorn drama I subscribe for. 
---
Lol you came to the point in which the goon poster runs out of legitimate points/arguments and begins talking about my life pretty quick.
---
I read that in an Indian accent.
---
Don't you mean 50%?
---
You do realise i'm one of the nyxes we dropped there yeah? You truely are the most arrogant mediocre fc just like everyone says. And i even defended you on several occasions
---
Reddit using and not Reddit using amok members get a permanent for questionable shitposting of a few members, banned by a goon, and there's supposedly mod bias. Olmeca makes my brain hurt.
---
Hey! Didn't you read here that i have goon chars?  I even confirmed many times that i have goon chars!     
---
If you think that i crave attention - well if this will make you post more things like this ... pls can i have more attention.          
---
Good changes.
---
If I deleted a post just because a hundred goons circlejerk about me in it I would have to delete all my posts.
---
One day you'll get in one. I'm pretty sure he's accused everyone ever of bias at one point or another. The guy is physically incapable of rationalizing that some people don't like him because, well, he's an asshole.
---
I also noticed how you got more hostile toward me since the time I first said your main motive is attention lol. Probably hit a nerve there.
---
I welped to Pando, sure.

I cleaned your clock out the other night though.

but why

[i]holy shit[/i]
---
ha get a load of this guy 
---
Where TF did you end up anyway?
---
This make true point. I am feeling same bias on posting from me.
---
/u/koahi is a good person and did nothing wrong
---
&gt;1) Here, /u/koahi says that they are waiting for me to say something dumb so they can ban me.
---
Please be nice to koahi. He is good people.
---
Must be nice being able to use capitals while you worship your false emperor, don't choke on the kool aid too hard. 
---
As I said, been there too. Nobody says you can't have fun, but be realistic. If $15 is out of your budget for a months entertainment, then you either find a way to fix that (which you should because that makes "college student broke" look wealthy), or you make do.
---
If making do is 20+ hours of mining spod or shooting red crosses, then said individual should reconsider priorities because those 20 hours could be spent getting a burger-flipping gig or selling autoparts (that was my temp fix), which fixes more problems than just "wah I need to grind forever for Plex because I can't afford sub". Or they can just accept playing as an alpha and live with it vOv
---
&gt;4) Here, they are proudly talking about how they banned me from r/Eve discord channel. [I was banned from that discord channel, about half a year ago, for nothing. /u/Jibrish just pinged me in the general chat and banned me for saying that "you can't ban me because I did not do anything wrong").]
---
Jonas still says you cannot ban him.
---
bots are alpha accounts, which are for free.
---
you can just create 5 more when they ban 1
---
Uh...here. As you said in your post. Remember? 
---
You can do that now buying injectors with the payout... What exactly would it bring to the game?
---
&gt;2- CCP does more profit from PLEX sales, which also help lower the PLEX prices.
---
Higher plex-&gt;isk prices encourage people to buy plex due to getting more isk for their $$, coupled with minerals/caps getting cheaper and cheaper, its more effective to buy plex when the isk value is high vs when its low and on sale.
---
**#FREEEVEDEU**
---
There's no monoculture in Goons. There's more culture between my toes. It's a bunch of individual spergy gamers behaving like idiots online without consequence. This "collective" mentality you are projecting simply doesn't exist. At best, there's a "herd" mentality but it's so fleeting and temporary that one can barely say it existed.
---
If you think Goons are cancerous, fine. Most corps have their own types of cancerous jokes, pilots, or whatever. That's what happens in a sandbox video game played by adults, most of whom are looking to have a beer and disconnect from adult life for a few hours. Besides, being an adult doesn't make you mature and there's no minimum maturity level in Goons.
---
I'm baffled that you honestly believe it's a cultural thing, and that it's something that can or even should be rectified.
---
You are banned for a reason fam
---
&gt;Particularly, on how they isolate their in-game enemies from the community,
---
Spend ages coming up with conspiracies targeting by far the largest alliance in the game that was created on Something Awful specifically known to troll the shit out of others. Gets mad when his posts get downvoted.
---
&gt;Even this fear shows the kind of unfair advantage Goons have over me,
---
This is the biggest fucking act of playing the victim I've ever read. Man up pussy, it's a video game.
---
&gt;and how predatory the behavior of their reddit mods were.
---
As a proud shitposter for GSF for the last year, I've gotten banned 3 times for making Judge jokes. I agree with you they can be a bit heavy handed. (No regrets)
---
but for what? a possible titan kill that will be replaced almost instantly and will in no way harm the group(probably will even make them stay more to bait another)? for the "fun" of using and coordinating the deployment of a one button ship? and in lowsec no less?
---
I honestly just don't get the appeal, not that i'm part of them regardless but I'd assume those are the reasons.
---
"HELP HELP, I'M BEING OPPRESSED," Olmeca
---
 I am part of that slope,quit right before AT announcement because I didn't like how the game was going
---
&gt; But but but Eve is in maintenance mode get used to it CCP changes nothing just milks the playerbase literally no changes for years Eve is dying now for real

Idiotic whinery the whole sub is.

All depends how deep you want to go down the rabbit hole.  in your example you talk about biking.  But many people buy a single bike for \~$100, wear causal clothes, and enjoy biking at a recreational level - just like all kids did.
---
I own two fishing poles.  I have invested under $100 in total.  I have everything I need to fish at the level I care about.  
---
In Eve, you can have just one account and have a fair bit of fun.  You do not NEED to go further.  Sure, i too have a second account (and two more in alpha), but I know I do not NEED my second account to have MOST of the fun in the game.
---
K, we did. 
---
Now can we talk about how gang stalking delusions and the mental health issues you are exhibiting? 
---
About fucking time!
---
That gives me flashbacks to the ifunny app, yikes 
---
Thank you so much. &lt;3
---
No no. I mean you get a sp boost for having a bounty on your head so you don't want to actually die. But make it so it's not worth it to give bounties to yourself instead of just buying injectors
---
Oh this is simple i dislike dishonest people.             
---
For me people input broadcasters are cheaters in eve (aka Marshy is a fucking cheater).            
---
For you guy that input brodcasts is a cheater ... well as long as he is not using this to hunt group of players you don't like.               
---
Yup Titans work wonders, i'll just say its very easy to feel special with Killah or Vince holding your hand.
---
I'd say you could slowboat back to gate if you're tackled after jump by a sole garmur.
---
It‚Äôs just you...
---
I said I was temp banned from the subreddit, and permabanned from r/Eve discord.
---
My post didn't say I was temp banned for no reason from the subreddit.
---
It said I was perma banned for no reason from the discord. I wasn't even active there, so I don't know what you refer

No but if gevlon had MOA ...

It's certainly a nicer hand than Bliss', that's for sure. Does he talk like this post in your standard command channels too, or does he just save it for special occasions?
---
But hey listen you have a good deployment, I'm sure there's more fun and games in stock for tonight.
---
Such a dumbass argument. You really think that spending $500 a year on Eve is realistic for everyone? If you want the optimal amount of accounts for nullsec (where most of the player base lives, ignoring retard highsec) then that‚Äôs what it costs approximately.
---
Oh but you don‚Äôt NEED 4 accounts, well then Eve really is pay to win. Enjoy not having a titan or super just cus you can‚Äôt afford it irl.
---
Also not everyone can get overtime work, like seriously just think for a second ‚Äúdoes me saying just have more money lul‚Äù make me sound like a douchebag moron?
---
Plex was like 1/3 of the price a few years ago and this massive inflation was done ON PURPOSE by CCP with the release of rorqual injectors online. If you don‚Äôt see why people are maybe pissed off about it then you‚Äôre an idiot.
---
No it's still here 
---
Why would you want to live in a C4 and not being a real pvp corp by living in a C5?
---
Because you said you were acting that way towards Zelden or whoever? Jesus..
---
Amazing, it only took them 6 years to unfuck wardecs!
---
Damn the nerve got touched :D
---
I'm sure your an ok guy but don't talk shit when you have absolutely nothing to back it up with.
---
2nd language and all.
---
NOW YOU SEE THE VIOLENCE INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM!
---
These are really good changes. As a member of the CSM, I'd like to point out that Team Five-0 came to us really early with this design and gave us plenty of opportunities to have input at various stages, their communication was fantastic throughout the entire process. I'm really happy with the end result.  
---
I'm so glad Neutral RR and Neutral Links are being removed from wardecs. These two parts were one of the most frustrating parts of wardecs, now you need to have your logistics and boosts inside the corp/alliance where they can be scouted and engaged. I can't express how much this one change is going to vastly improve the quality of engagements in highsec, especially for less experienced groups. 
---
The War HQ design is also something that's going to make wardecs a lot more bloody in my opinion. Gives Defenders a reason to actually fight, gives defenders a reason to actually hire mercenaries, gives wardeccers a location to get an engagement. 
---
Really looking forward to how this plays out. 
---
Yes but my post has nothing to do with it that ban. You didn't even probably read it.
---
Mediocrity has it's charms.
---
Please don't defend me, mysterious stranger, I'm actually a horrible person and not worth the effort.
---
&gt;I've gotten banned 3 times for making Judge jokes
---
then make good ones you muppet
---
These situations are pretty different though, dropping on ratting supers / dropping on response groups vs dropping on titans in a pre-formed fleet.
---
I do think people need to try more often though, what's a couple dread losses to a pilot+alt and maybe 100 losses to an alliance vs getting multiple titan frags, who cares if the other sides has fun and gets to clean up your shit. 
---
Did one group alone defeat Goons during WWB/Casino War? Nope. It starts with one group, I don't know why, It doesn't even matter how hard you try, keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
---
They forgot the scale on this one, fixed it. https://i.imgur.com/mqqWILa.png
---
But yet you contribute to circlejerk of an alliance whose financial guy was just banned for rmt.
---
Yes, it could be useful under those circumstances, however the total percentage of Eve players who live in wormholes is very small and the percentage of those who would prefer scanning in a vulnerable sieged BS over a cloaked covert ops when that can really have its scanning stats max'd out with modules, rigs, and implants is even way way smaller.  So I still think my summary is accurate.
---
Finally. This is really great news and hopefully finally stops these cowards that protect their structures by abusing these bugs. Thanks to CCP for that.
---
Thanks for the good fights
---
Yes I did - when I you said ‚Äúin his defence..‚Äù and ‚Äúhe was probably thinking of the hard work goon mods do‚Äù. So it...does have to do with that ban? Hahahaha
---
there should be a payment history in your account management page. 
---
As a human running these sites, you'd build a decision tree to deal with the NPCs in the anomaly.  For example, shoot logi first, kill webs next, burn away from things with a point (if you're in a subcap) and so on.
---
Once you work out that decision tree, it's not going to change.  You're just going to use a slightly different tree if the variations are different enough.  And you're going to be able to quickly figure out which variation you are in when you land.  And in about 2-3 months, you're going to be really bored again.
---
And no, CCP (or any developer) can not revamp the content faster than you can get bored of it.  Development takes time, even if you have a massive team.  That's why so many multiplayer games have PvP as the endgame.
---
So, how about bots?  They can follow decision trees.  Even if the rats are equipped with scrams.
---
Bots can not be eliminated by game mechanics.  Bots can only be eliminated by 'player' behavior.
---
Lol nice take on a umadbro.
---
Nah, I'm terrible (and genuinely a bad FC) but it's fun to trade banter with walking egos, you get picky over the strangest things.
---
Pay the same price as it was when they had more people working on Eve and before they laid off teams in order to have more people working on other stuff not Eve. I'll pass.
---
I offered to mod deadtear and he told me to fuck myself.
---
That‚Äôs a perfectly sensible approach.
---
I do that for a lot of things myself. For those things that I want a bit of a richer experience, sometimes I spend some money.
---
If I could get rid of computer contraptions I could do with a notebook and a ballpoint pen, less than 5 bucks tops, and I could write until the starless dark. I could live for really cheap because I notice I don‚Äôt have all that many material needs.
---
So, your way of doing it is actually a lot closer to my ideal for perfection. I‚Äôm also accounting for a level of laziness and the circumstance that, on my own modest level, I can spend some money doing things that give me joy.
---
Sounds good to me.
---
How will PIRAT continue to be l33t now?
---
I asked why their mods /r/starcitizen were such fanatics defending roberts space industries, not allowing open discussion about it. You know what they said? "You're banned"
---
Olmeca always makes drama so i‚Äôm surprised that anyone treat this post seriously. If he puts more effort in gameplay itself then shitposting and accusing ppl for hurting him he could really achieve something.
---
Do you have a full time job? I feel that maybe deserving of as much effort as you put into a video game. 
---
I don't hate him, I'm worried about him actually.
---
We dreadbombed into 80+ Titans with 150 dreads, killed the dumb Erebus an then all died in a fire, it was a blast. Would recommend to you trying the same, it is fun ;-)
---
Should be, as long as it's still being actively maintained.  Otherwise new rats, ship classes, etc, may not show up properly.  I personally use Z-S's base pack with some adjustments I've made over time.  You'll probably end up making changes as well, everyone does, but the packs get all the base work like coloring standings done for you.
---
Sounds about right.
---
But who do you think is the test master?
---
Must be nice being able to undock without having a bloc-level fc online.
---
lmao, good point. Graphs with X or Y info missing are made intentionally to mislead people
---
Please lend me a hand
---
if instead of spenting the time to write this you crabbed, buying plex would not be so bad
---
i bet the 100 people doing that kind of pvp in highsec are happy about this.
---
I once had something similar in mind, but then with (omni damage dealing) drifter rats coming through wormholes, infiltrating cosmic anomalies and making it more difficult to rat on autopilot.
---
Can't deny the ego part, all fcs have them. Anyone who denies it is lying!
---
There are particular cultural elements being reinforced in goons.
---
You won't see similar metagame tactics being used by members of horde, for example. Goons treat their alliance more like a cult because this behaviour has been reinforced in a top-down manner for a long time now. Meanwhile horde people are mostly there for pvp content and fun so they don't resort to this metagame.
---
TL;DR: grrrrrr rrrreeeeeee
---
Translation:  these frosted flakes are grrrrrreeeeeat! 
---
Dont forget. If you are at war with a group, and another group is ALSO at war with that group, and you decide to remote rep the group that is at war with THE SAME group you are at war with. You are then suspect.
---
The group that is at war with you can then get neutral toons to perma point your logi, and you cant do a whole lot about that.
---
You are a sad sad man. Lol get a life buddy.
---
mod me so that i may punish these pubbies with the might of my powerful posts
---
Olmeca's pretty clever most of the time. I too doubt that he's drowning that hard in the Grr Goons Koolaid. The confirmation bias reeks too hard to not be fish bait.
---
A hundred?
---
Either you're really into playing the victim, or you've vastly overestimated how many people care about you in relation to this game. Honestly, you're setting yourself up to fail simply by posting this massive cry for help on /r/eve. What did you think would happen here?
---
That is like saying you are not serious about getting a gate to stain.. he just doesn't get that most people **act** serious, but obviously aren't. It's like a magical blindspot
---
And you constantly spam threads about how bad mechanics are that make the game safe - then run to modmail and cry when someone calls you 'lonely'.
---
Harden the fuck up.
---
Cue *This is really eve*
---
The ban was mentioned as background info.
---
The point of the post is how goon mods are trying to get me banned (apart from the temp ban I received) and looking for opportunities.
---
There is obviously no reasoning with you so this is my last reply 
---
Seconded, this kind of drama is why I'm on reddit.
---
More like tl;dr: olmeca didn't read his own chat log and is blatantly, directly and provably lying to you.
---
Am I misunderstanding the war HQ part or will having to designate a structure as the HQ make the big null alliances much safer from wars from the likes of PIRAT etc since the null alliance can just blap the structure with vastly superior numbers?
---
who are you 
---
"No low effort shitposts Mspaint images or simple Eve logo copy pastes onto a pic - they will be removed. This includes generic meme templates - though sometimes we let them through. Post at your own risk. Read this post Expect 1-3 temp bans if you ignore this rule"
---
How do you define "low effort" as effort is a relative term. What is a "generic meme template". That term is so broad it could be used for literally any online joke. None of my images were made using MsPaint, and I am not an graphic designer so it took some effort. The only thing that sets my posts apart from the hundreds of other meme/joke posts on this sub is the anti goon spice, which you obviously take offense to.
---
I think you may be beyond help
---
Because people are hurting your feelings?
---
It's a game. Don't take it seriously. None of the idiots posting here, in-game, or on Discord actually matter. I don't matter. You do you, and ignore everyone else.
---
Posting this opens you up to so much ridicule and criticism. If you framed this as a B4R, people might care and listen. But with you, and your on-again off-again exclusive relationship with Goons, it's hard to take it seriously.
---
&gt; WH &gt; TEST &gt; ????????
---
just look up sunk cost fallacy. it's a thing and has nothing to do with addiction. it's a simple bug in our minds.
---
this has been an issue for YEARS, im glad you guys worked on it so hard with CCP, well done Jonah
---
But you certainly implied it. Like, several times.
---
are you actually this retarded? or just playin?
---
RIP Eve, the carebears win again lmao. Well done CCP you've broken the last place that was dangerous! Now all the carebears are free to run around in COMPLETE SAFETY!!! This is not the game I started 14 years ago. 
---
Great response to OPs question. Thanks for the information
---
Dude! Thanks. TIL. 
---
Imagine caring so much about kb efficieny you batphone a 40 thousand man alliance to win fights against a group you allready outnumber
---
Well everyone will just put a HQ in some deep deep nullsec pocket or in WH space. 
---
It will cover almost your entire character history except if your character was made in the first couple years after the game was launched (iirc). 
---
This says something coming from StainGuy
---
Exactly what I expect is happening. Upset goons circlejerk about it in the comments, giving me an exact example on their cultural problem I am talking about. While impartial people who actually read ir upvote it because its points are valid.
---
You need to be in the same corp or alliance to get Remote Reps. Allys cannot give remote reps without being CONCORDed. The reason for this is that it's really complicated to track and both corps/alliances could have a different set of war-targets. 
---
What?!
---
As if Goons have a dedicated team to isolate *you*? You're not that important.
---
Besides, what you do in-game is fascinating and impressive. You've  taken a game mechanic and cranked it up to eleven. Who fucking cares what others think? Do what makes you happy. It's a video game. Let go of this victimhood complex and delusional conspiracy theories.
---
Our calling tablets ipads. Reeeeee irl
---
My friend, have you heard of correlation &lt;&gt; causation? Now, I'm sure you've witnessed plenty of Goons ragging on you, but it isn't because we have some sort of diabolical monoculture driving us, hivemind-like, into a particular course of action. It's because *you nearly exclusively post about us.* Of course we're going to pay more attention to you than most -- you're talking about us! 
---
Lmao you bitch about carebears, but these groups cant even fight the carebears properly.
---
I used to wardec indy groups, never used logi just neutral SCOUTS. If you need neutral logi you are either complete shit at the game, or hitting above your weight class
---
It's not your maths they hate, it's the truth they despise.
---
All I took from this long wall of words is Goons are being goons and saying bad things about me.  
---
This guy has been gevlon'ed. Keep it up my brothers you are doing Gods work. 
---
tell me about it... now PIRAT are going to have the bring logi from their own alliance. 
---
This is unacceptable.
---
Speaking of Concordekken, I remembered this wonderful video. https://youtu.be/EhcZHhFTejU?t=84
---
All your solutions boil down to 'stop doing what you are doing.' Guy uncloaks and warps in on your vni? Stop ratting go get a pvp ship and come back and hes gone.
---
Stop ratting go to another system, he follows you, rinse repeat until you get nothing done.
---
well my buying power increased immensely from 2009 to current year without putting more effort into isk making.
---
as a soloist i don't really care about logistics/supply and it certainly does not play into the meaning of my losses. before i could whelp 10 canes/month. now i can whelp triple that
---
How about person who setup bounty can choose what characters or corporations can claim it? That way we can have professional teabaggers and victim cannot just steal this money with alt.
---
Thank fuck. No one cares the point of your post, or would care if goons got you banned, so good luck with that, son. 
---
Except the booshing mechanics and stats posts. Pretty interesting.
---
&gt; I agree with you they can be a bit heavy handed. (No regrets)
---
I'm gonna show you some modbias and let your account live for that one. One time get out of jail free card.

I explicitly said there is some level of abuse of modding powers. I didn't say it included breaking of any rules.

Again, I don't even know what rules mods have to talk about whether they are breaking them.

Not some casual game where someone can actually shoot my command bursts OMG!! Also if my Logi characters have to be in my corp/alliance and might actually get shot!! Or get killed while moving.... that's unacceptable. ITS A PVP MMO I SHOULD BE IMMUNE TO PVP BECAUSE IM WARDECCER THANKS.
---
Thank god, the neutral logi system went on for far too long.
---
Your post is being upvoted because it's hilarious and sad, not because people agree with you.
---
And this is far from a real circlejerk. Check out the Goon forums sometime. Christ, they tear apart anyone for any reason, all the time. You're just the latest target. You set yourself up to fail here.
---
Hey listen, we all know at this point NC and PL aren't quite the ''top tier'' alliances they used to be. With all that being said dude, no mad bro. 
---
ccp will lose a shit ton of money if they disallow plex to sub 
---
alt numbers would drastically drop, skill farms would disappear and a lot of players would just quit rather than pay actual money because that's just how their brain is 
---
i mean yay you killed bots but you probably also killed half the game population with this change 
---
It's less about hurt feelings but more about unnecessary toxicity, abuse of mod powers, and isolation of good balance opinions which turned this game to krab online last 3 years.
---
I know impartial people are getting that point despite goon circlejerk in the thread.
---
This post pretty much boils down to "I don't want Goons to be able to comment on my posts." If that's the case, why not start a blog instead? No one can comment on your blog if you don't want them to. There are many free blogging platforms available.
---
I kinda had to stop playing when they introduced injectors. Buying isk to skip farming is one thing... buying literal time off the grind? I knew I wouldn't be able to resist, and I didn't want to be that guy.
---
Reinforced? Suggesting there's an invisible hand guiding hundreds of people do hate...you in particular?
---
And now you say it's a cult?! Far from it. The only reason this mega-alliance holds itself together is through wealth and infrastructure. There's nonstop drama, goonfucking, and generally problematic behaviour that to even suggest there's a controlled cult-like monoculture is absolutely ridiculous.
---
The only reason you're not attacking Horde or anyone else is that they aren't as big a target, and you're not playing in *their* space.
---
r/eve being r/o for most people wouldn't be the worst thing to happen.  We need deadtear.

This one made me lol for real. Thanks.

Its funny how this always happens for heavy anti Goon posts.
---
You accused of bias out the gate. There's the proof.
---
The best counter to cloaky camping is to come to wormhole space, if they try to jump on you you can have your buddy or an alt in a cloaky ship nearby to kill the camper. The lack of local chat is a double edged sword.
---
can we also IP ban all members of "we form volta" for being literal shit human beings?
---
see, i can also make blanket statements for an entire playergroup.
---
fuck off dumbo
---
You are correct.
---
Ohhhh I see what you mean... Granted I do not quite know how it works, but if you manage to slow boat and jump through the gate, won't the Garmur be able to follow you to the other side and wait the time till you de cloack to start shoting you again? O.o
---
That makes a lot of sense. That's why I was asking OP, genuinely curious about the situation
---
Lets make eve a safespace!
---
Nice flairbait.
---
That's an incentive toward noob griefing if I ever saw one, as it's mostly noobish players that put bounties...
---
Im all for it as long as the siege animation makes that little part in the middle that usually spins stay fixed, and the rest of the ship spins.
---
I was naive enough to think this is about FW revamp. Oh well I will keep waiting.
---
&gt; unnecessary toxicity
---
That's your opinion, though.
---
&gt; abuse of mod powers
---
Pure speculation on your part, and your evidence isn't as damning as you think.
---
&gt; isolation of good balance opinions
---
You're not a victim or isolation, or anything for that matter. You're fodder for anonymous video game players, and you make it all to easy because of how seriously you take things.
---
&gt; I know impartial people are getting that point despite goon circlejerk in the thread.
---
Somehow every time users disagree with you, it's because of a Goon circlejerk. Odd, no? As if there's zero chance people could ever disagree with you because you might be wrong.
---
Your post was a generic meme template. 
---
&gt; After the May release, whenever a corporation or alliance declares a non-mutual war they will be required to select a specific Upwell Structure (only including Upwell structures with docking facilities, not FLEX structures) they own **somewhere in highsec space.**
---
&gt; much safer from wars from the likes of PIRAT
---
My heart *bleeds* for the likes of PIRAT.
---
I understand you want to try to give ways out to the botting and think that pay with money for the subscription is the way it must be 
---
but you are thinking on yourselft and people who can do it , for example me i live in cuba  my only way is to omega time is plex on the game and i know   with this prices  i have to work harder to get the isk to be able to play it with omega
---
BUT if your believe is the right one  and is the way to save from bot , and have to be alpha again i will be playing still  EVE
---
Hope you are right but not every solution to something is to kill and start all over again cause mistakes will be there again and who knows is then worst than before
---
You said it, and you implied it, but your evidence is not as convincing or damning as you think. You're connecting dots where there are none, and making logical leaps so grand that I can't help but think you're walking a fine line between passionate and crazy.
---
needs more ressource depletion
---
Has to be in Hisec.
---
but plex is money for ccp, more money than a sub in a lot of cases. 
---
people would unsub all alts except a few at most, all sp farms would go away, the "free to play" people would quit 
---
i would guess that ccp would be halving their sub numbers(sub plex whatever its all the same in terms of $ for ccp) 
---
now ccp has done some pretty stupid shit lately but they won't throw away the plex profit by removing its main use 
---
My friends and I are back and have really enjoyed the Abyssal Deadpacd PvE content. With a friend, you can easily do the T1 and T2 sites in assault frigates, and T3 isn't that bad once you get some practice.

Imagine certain kinds of bad behavior often exemplified by leaders of an alliance, or applauded by leaders when others subscibe to it. Then imagine it disseminates to other people, as they realize the behavior gets them affirmation. They in turn, affirm other people subscribing the same behavior. There is no orchestration but a natural cultural appropriation of some bad behavior here.
---
I shouldn't have to give you a lecture on circlejerk mechanics to argue that circlejerks exist.
---
&gt; whenever a corporation or alliance declares a non-mutual war they will be required to select a specific Upwell Structure (only including Upwell structures with docking facilities, not FLEX structures) they own somewhere in **highsec space**.

That last word should have been an adverb

You can't. It has to been in highsec.

Take a chill pill, mongoloid.

---
&gt; Your post is being upvoted because it's hilarious and sad, not because people agree with you.
---
I had posts which you would call with similar names, yet got no upvotes.
---
&gt; Bots can not be eliminated by game mechanics. Bots can only be eliminated by their behavior.
---
This is true, but you can make it much harder to program.  While the goal should be 100% elimination of bots, even getting to 75% or 50% is better than 10%.  
---
Plus, most bots are terrible at reacting to new changes while players can quickly pickup new patterns.  Slight changes week to week by tweaking the npcs or site layouts can have drastic effects on the botters.  
---
If everyone is saying your an idiot and acting like gevlon 2.0 is probably true. Maybe try leaving your basement for a while and you may see the light 
---
thats almost like you didnt read to the end. classic

Unless he actually believes this shit too, which ehhhhh

50/50?

Which of these is more likely:

* Reddit is a place of logic and predictable behaviour; or
---
* Random people felt random things for random reasons.

I do not play EVE and I have no clue how I ended up here, but this was all very entertaining subreddit drama.

&gt; The best counter to cloaky camping is to come to wormhole space

Then you always die because you don't even know he's there until hes plunging your asshole with blasters.

This is the main problem with cloaky camping. I could be eternally vigilant towards people being in system or on grid and it won't matter because the amount of effort i can exert to actively counter it is 0. 
---
Plus after doing some krabbing into C5s with a small fleet i know for a fact that i couldn't do it solo or with a VNI. I would need to find a group that almost doesn't exist its so small and is overwhelmingly hostile to outsiders to maybe get in. My C5 nestor is going to stay docked in null until another C5 opens nearby fuck that shit.

---
&gt; your evidence is not as convincing or damning as you think. 
---
A mod trying to get someone they don't like to say bannable stuff to ban them is biased. A mod lying to his alliance about what's going on in private modmail messages, or a mod banning people for no reason from discord channels, is abusing his power. 
---
Wait it says targeted assistance though?
---
As a goon that flew in Burn Jita, mined in Delve and took part in 'other' fleet stuff around the eve map at the same time this is uncannily accurate.  If you think this is a bad outcome....what does your game look like?  Eve is an equal opportunities platform.  Take the opportunities that your environment provides you.  Enjoy.
---
THERAPY shoots people in Thera; Signal Cartel oes not.
---
"Went on for far too long" should be CCPs "Do no evil" version of Googles.

Nah I see no point in arguing with you. I just see your desperate cry for help that you tried to supress :(
---
Olmeca retard post #69420 no surprise 
---
&gt; Imagine certain kinds of bad behavior often exemplified by leaders of an alliance, or applauded by leaders when others subscibe to it.
---
You've already lost me. Your assertion is predicated on specific and deliberate behaviour that simply does not exist. It cannot exist in a group like Goons.
---
No one joins Goons and subscribes to any social behaviour. Hell, most don't participate at all preferring instead to mine, rat, PvP in near silence and in solitude. To suggest one or several individuals are invisibly controlling socialized behaviour is ludicrous.
---
&gt; I shouldn't have to give you a lecture on circlejerk mechanics to argue that circlejerks exist.
---
You're the one making the argument, so yes. So far all you've argued is that because of downvotes and disagreements, it must be a Goon circlejerk. Then you throw up your arms in defeat, claiming you're once again the victim of some "unorchestrated" mass cultural conspiracy of toxic behaviour which is somehow, inexplicably, directed solely at you.
---
This would be fascinating if it weren't so bizarre.
---
Correct . Command boosts just stop applying to you.
---
Naglfar?
---
&gt;For area of effect command bursts we are approaching the problem a little differently as you may want to continue boosting the members of your fleet that are not involved in a war. Therefore, after the April release neutral command bursts will simply not affect a pilot that meets the conditions listed above when activated in highsec space.
---
Command Bursts in highsec that meet the same criteria for getting CONCORDed through remote assistance will not apply. You can't get links from neutral characters in wars.
---
Wish this was true
---
Yeah, without this you could just get around Concord by having both allies make mutual wars with a third party. I think the neutral logi nerf is a good thing, it will bring on a change in tactics for subcapital brawls in Hisec.
---
Take your friend; go to the pub. Have a few pints and enjoy real life.  Then, come back to Eve; find an even bigger group of friends; and enjoy the game.  Simples.

Find a better game?

But can I still safely rep freighters that are being ganked??
---
Was he wrong? The original post, by a member of the Imperium, was wrong. This post was right, and downvoted.
---
Worked better than I expected as well
---
&gt; A mod trying to get someone they don't like to say bannable stuff to ban them is biased.
---
And *human*. Nevertheless, bias and poor judgment does not a Goon conspiracy make.
---
&gt; A mod lying to his alliance about what's going on in private modmail messages
---
That's not what your "evidence" suggests. And it wouldn't matter if you did have a smoking gun.
---
&gt; or a mod banning people for no reason from discord channels
---
We have a reason elsewhere in this thread.
---
&gt; is abusing his power.
---
If you think this is an abuse, check out other major subreddits. Tip of the iceberg. That said, this isn't an abuse: the mod has responded elsewhere shedding light on things, and explaining that your behaviour (which you admit at times has been unreasonable) earned you a ban.
---
&gt; Do you wanna argue against these? 
---
It's hard to argue against something fabricated and founded purely on speculation and hearsay. I'm not challenging the authenticity of the screenshots, I'm saying they don't matter and that - importantly - they do not serve your objectives in the way you seem to believe.
---
The dev blog says that the war HQ will have to be in high sec space.
---
&gt; After the May release, whenever a corporation or alliance declares a non-mutual war they will be required to select a specific Upwell Structure (only including Upwell structures with docking facilities, not FLEX structures) they own somewhere in highsec space.
---
&gt; This structure will be designated the ‚ÄúWar HQ‚Äù for the war.
---
Olmeca, you're a fucking cunt. That's why people down vote you. There is no active silencing because no one gives a fuck. If you think there's some concerted effort to shut you up, it's because your ego is too thick to realize you're at a house party and everyone is sick of listening to you. I haven't even seen anyone talk about you other than "oh look, this fuck is feeding again lolololol".
---
Give it a rest.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pospy
---
Exactly, so pirat declare war on test, pirat select a high sec structure as a war HQ, test brings 100 man fleet to kill citadel. War over. Or am I still getting this wrong?
---
These sound like great changes, particularly neutral logi and links as you say.
---
War HQs is a great move, and gives an opportunity for indy corps to defend themselves (by hiring mercs). I do feel that the majority of War HQs are going to be in solitude though, to make combat logistics harder for normal HS corps. I suppose that's just a market opportunity for a Solitude merc corps.
---
I have like $20k worth of machine tools in my garage for my hobby.  I feel you.  Also, check out MtG: Arena.  It's a lot of fun to play online and costs nothing to start.

A better option would be the person who puts the bounty on you have to assign it to a specific player or list said bounty in some form of item on the market and only that player that accepted the bounty could claim it

Tempted to cross post in /r/SubredditDrama/
---
I'm not sympathizing with pirat exactly, just saying high sec could end up being safer than it is for null alliances
---
This is sad. 
---
&gt; How do you define "low effort" as effort is a relative term.
---
As I painstakingly explained to you in modmail - there's are *literal examples in the rule*. There's *even an entire thread on the subject, directly in the rule* [Right. Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/wiki/rules). Just read it. Seriously.

People believe the world is flat and than we never had a guy walk on the moon.
---
I think this guy is only tinfoil hat level crazy and not quite a professional lunatic yet.  
---
Is my understanding correct then, any high sec war dec alliance declares war on a big null sec alliance, aggressor designates high sec citadel as HQ, 300 man null sec fleet blaps that citadel, ear over? Safer high sec for null alliances? I'm not complaining just trying to understand
---
so what you're saying is team 5 o is the only team at CCP that does anything good for the game?

Gevlon was a mittens alt

Suck it hisec deccers!

You know that this war HQ should be in higsec to have sense. 
---
Reddit automatically removes quickmeme.com. This is good because your post is terrible.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
hmm what about incursions?
---
That is correct.
---
In practice we probably aren't going to care enough to do anything about it because we're used to living with wars from the likes of PIRAT and showing up for 3 timers in the ass end of hisec somewhere is effort.
---
This is really good.
---
But please, one additional small step... require a "War HQ" service and make it require a metric ton of fuel (or some other trade good) directly in proportion to how many War HQs you have online.
---
is jew a verb
---
answer carefully 
---
The structure needs to go through its full reinforcement cycle giving the attackers at least some guaranteed time when the war is active. But yes generally you are correct. The unfortunate "downside" of giving a defender an objective they can complete to end a war means that defenders who can effectively achieve that objective will be able to end a war against them. 
---
True the timers will be tedious but I do feel like it will make high sec safer, which I'm not really keen on. Then again mutual wars will still mean high sec isn't as safe as it could be
---
You should try to have a little bit of self respect, seriously.
---
Or it is just a bait. I don't know
---
PIRAT has abused a broken system for too long so long o7

**Step 1:** Anchor Large Mobile Warp Disruption Bubble II outside of Olmeca staging station.

**Step 2:** Occasionally defend said bubble when convenient.

Upvoted for visibility. Keep fighting the good fight olmeca. G*d bless
---
It shouldn't change much for incursions. If you're not in a war remote assistance/bursts work exactly the same as they currently do. Most High-Sec Incursion groups operate on green safety, and wouldn't RR you if you are in a war right now anyway. 
---
You shoot at people...
---
Always has been and always will be fun
---
I see what you are trying to do.
---
I think what would happen in that situation is described here:
---
&gt; If the War HQ leaves space for any reason (such as unanchoring or destruction) the war becomes invalid and will enter its 24 hour cooldown just as it would if one side lost their war eligibility or if the attackers fail to pay the war bill.
---
Well, according to the dev blog, it has to be in high sec.

I think you need to rat in something that can survive long enough to get help

otherwise your argument is fundamentally "I shouldn't be allowed to die in my space"

I'm almost starting to believe or grand kids will see a finished module tiericide.

To be fair, at this point the goons aren't going to change what they do and no amount of electroshock therapy will change that :P

Although it might make you feel better

Hi capqu!

Is a good way for newbros that cant rat yet to make money

---
Those sound like really good changes that reflect most of what the community has been asking for years... well done! 
---
I understand that the new mechanics seem like the most important and exciting thing for the devs who are working on it, but the neutral logi/links changes are the true game changer here without a doubt. Props to everyone involved in pushing the "CONCORDOKKEN" solution, simply amazing.

Now I'll just sit here, waiting for the "HS Merc" salt to start flowing...

^^^^^(any ^^^^^news ^^^^^about ^^^^^lowsec ^^^^^changes?)

Imaging all of lowsec forming a Voltron to fight snuff and then still batphoning NC + Pandemic Horde + CVA on occasions.
---
Seems like it's their fault they batphoned NC who only came with 30 people (lol) forcing snuff the batphone goons who came with 150
---
Wow that's a lot of words. To be honest its no secret goons have placed added focus on reddit in recent years. It's part of the whole killing morale wins wars not killing ships. You probably have noticed goons on reddit tend to stick to the party line and are always there to rebuke any post.  Using mods is probably just part of the meta game.
---
For one, you can choose not to pay the bill and end the war.
---
HOLY SHIT 10 YEARS LATER THEY FINALLY FIX NEUT REPS
---
Yea how dare someone batphone to defend their staging forts and primary income sources. I suppose they should have just stood down and let it all die. 
---
plexing an account is less than 70m/day

that's fucking peanuts, plex is still cheap.

Double statics give double possibilities for content, if we cared about what people thought of us we wouldn't be wormholers to begin with and finally we decided to name our static after the best girl in Nekopara but we couldnt decide between Chocola or Vanilla so a dual static pleated both sides

They have to be in HS, it says so right there.

&gt;they will be required to select a specific Upwell Structure (only including Upwell structures with docking facilities, not FLEX structures) they own somewhere in highsec space.

Well, I see one solution, make PVE pvpish
---
*I think you dont understand the economic background why PLEX is so high. This very much CCPs doing and they are milking the cow hard atm...which is smart if you only have short to midterm goals in mind tbh.
---
High PLEX prices will eventually lead to less *active players or active alts and in both cases to less content for everyone. There are many players that have time (eg students) but not ***15-30*** bucks a month to sub/plex for ISK ~~to be competitive wallet/account wise~~ to have fun so these ppl will always try to grind ISK for PLEX to sub.
---
Current market trend for PLEX is not healthy. I say that as someone who is buying PLEX with IRL money to get mad ISK*

PTSD from Goons having to Doomsday frigates because in anything smaller they would have to take their eye off Spod

not to bash
---
this man fucking gets it
---
‚Äúhaving to‚Äù == is hilarious because it triggers you 
---
I think we need to stop anthropomorphising the goons so much. 
---
Non direct combat PVP confrontations can be created. Kinda PVE, but u get nothing if someone random in a region far, far away does something better
---
it wont, they wont have capitals, they wont have booshers, they wont have allies to 3rd party. They wont have a lot of the tools that make nullsec fights so large in scale.
---
You forget that each botter does not need to make his own bot.  The people running the bots buy them from people who write them.
---
A more difficult botting environment doesn't do much, 'cause the people writing the bots are not amateurs doing it in their free time.
---
&gt;Slight changes week to week by tweaking the npcs or site layouts can have drastic effects on the botters.
---
Bots aren't written to "go to x,y,z location".  They are positioned in relation to the rats.  Moving the rats does nothing.
---
If you install an overview your alliance wants you to use then your overview is still fucked.
---
Only way to unfuck it and see what you want to see is to make it from scratch yourself.
---
Why make it Nestor‚Äôs? Make it an SOE Cap either a dread or a FAX with a siege/triage. I like the triage/FAX keeping in line with the Nestor role
---
This reminds me RIP Erebus Silentkill
---
I love that the CCP employee's name is Darwin, its the perfect name to call out how dumb stainguy is
---
Eventually we will add this since we also think it would be great to have. This will be a part of the "My EVE" environment within our website.
---
Our focus now is to create a as stable market overview and trade tool :)

Nestor?

What are your thoughts on geopolitics in sub-Saharan Africa?
---
&gt; Safer high sec for null alliances?
---
But nullsec alliances have always been perfectly safe from highsec wardecs.
---
Safer highsec for idiot members of large alliances? Maybe, if the alliance in question cares to kill a citadel by organizing fleets multiple weeks in a row. Which nullsec alliances won't do, because as stated they are completely unaffected by highsec wardecs.
---
Put their hq in solitude haha

Hisec, scariest sec

When I lived in w-space for nearly 3 years, it was out of a POS without any asset safety.  We never used log-off freighters either.

Putting mine in the aridia islands
---
I never said they shouldn't batphone - people just seem to surprised that snuff turn to goons (a long standing ally) when their enemies call upon those from the north to come and help.
---
Are snuff just meant to stand down because they're getting blobbed and waste time?
---
"pvpish" isn't possible without enormous computation behind it.  Think: Chess program on your PC vs Deep Blue playing Kasparov.

My bad missed this, amazing
---
There is a minimum of 5 days reinforcement for hull in highsec on structures, plus the shield+armor timer. If you dec at a strategic time you can get upwards of 10 days of PVP against a null alliance if you want to engage them in Guerilla Warfare in highsec. A Raitaru is 500m + the 100m flat cost from the war means you pay 600m to dec a big alliance, which doesn't put it that far out of the picture for dedicated groups wanting to harass Goons/TEST/PL or whoever in highsec, and that alliance still needs to come and bash your structure 3 times. They do at least get a kill and a way to end the war against them however.   
---
I think you are overestimating how well the bots are programmed.  I'm sure there are some bots that are maintained and meticulously run, but the average bot is dumb as fuck.  IF you had professionals writing these bots, they wouldn't be stuck in bubbles, they wouldn't lay down and die, they wouldn't warp to anomalies that are already there, they wouldn't fail when local disappeared, they wouldn't fail when someone bumps their orca etc.  The bots are written quick and dirty and break all the time.  Moving the rats for example, could screw up all the targeting mechanisms and the bots would just sit there and do jack shit.  
---
Ohhh god the tears THE GLORY!

---
If i'm vigilant enough to watching like a hawk and not afk and willing to ship into a pvp ship why should i not be allowed to defend myself at least?
---
Well, we did log-out in our capitals, but we didn't use them for storage.
---
Some people left them sitting in force-field, which was inviting disaster.
---
Says you while another blog post to change wardecks following player feedback is published.
---
&gt;The War HQ design is also something that's going to make wardecs a lot more bloody in my opinion. Gives Defenders a reason to actually fight, gives defenders a reason to actually hire mercenaries, gives wardeccers a location to get an engagement. 
---
It will also lead to largenullblocs being virtually immune to wars from higsec alliances. No surprise here tho if we look at the current csm.
---
Because he is a retarded pubbie one a 15 day old reddit account.
---
This was worth the read.  Really worth the time.  
---
GOON TRAITOR BIAS I SEE IT RIGHT HERE OMG REEEEEEEEWW

they would trade dreads for faxes, which isnt a lot of fun. and even then, if the supers are at risk they can just warp of, unless they have a massive ball of hictors ready.
---
no u

I see what you did wirh sex position and pot numbers.

Buy Raitaru for 500m, wardec goons for 100m. Time the wardec so the structure's final day is within 5 days of the war starting. You get 10\~ days of war against goons for 600m. Which isn't that much worse than the current system, and cheaper if you're deccing more than 3 alliances, you'll just lose KB stats.

Doooo itttttt

I think i see possible abuse of this mechanic.         
---
People in FW are using wardecs to fight other corporations in the same FW.       
---
So attackers can just drop a structure in the "opposite faction" 1.0 system ... and defenders cannot touch it without getting steamrolled by faction police.         
---
You pinned your response? Wtf?
---
Yeah, bots warp as soon they detect you in local. Some try to call drones in but you have like 5-6 seconds to reach the site. Thanks for the good for your opinion!

High-sec is like the first level of a mid-90s RTS where you and the AI only have infantry to throw at each other while your harvestors/svc's are fleecing the homelands.

In the next episode I will add some kills of full AFK ratters. They just check if they finished the anomaly. We killed several guys that 10 or 20 minutes after we killed them, they reshipped and died again.

Um. 
---
OP let me take a second and reflect on how you are mad at the Gon, for being a mod in a subreddit that runs it in a biased way. Even though this subreddit is about eveonline. Where being a lying , cheating bastard is a accepted, and encouraged. 
---
Please grow up.
---
Why is there no scale/label of the y axis of ‚Äúrate of a new player joining a corp within 3 days‚Äù? Data could easily not be as shocking as it seems
---
That makes no sense. I agree that olmeca is disproportionally paranoid about goon bias, but **IF** he is right, then yes, your point b) is unironically correct
---
now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time
---
I think you can simply fix this by disallowing the War HQ to be in a highsec that the owning corp would be shot in by faction police.
---
do you have the goatee to prove it?
---
i too was banned by modbias /u/jibrish for destroying the pedophile channel in discord. i want it known that mod bias continues to tear this community apart from our true enemy of weebism
---
&gt;Goons actively try to 'trigger' people or mentally harass them othewise, to get them isolated, get them kicked from community channels, and make them look bad. 
---
It's not like their leader encouraged them to harras someone to commit suicide on a stage, or trying to trigger others by posting beep beep i'm a jeep after someone died in a car crash, or bullied a streamer because her grandpa died etc.
---
Oh wait

Pearl Abyss makes spot to introduce CCP Games (known for Eve Online) in Korea
---
Body:
---
Pearl Abyss revealed that they are hosting a 'Pearl Abyss X CCP Media Talk' on March 7th.
---
Recently acquired by Pearl Abyss, CCP Games CEO Hilmar is vising Korea to introduce his company as well as talk about future projects. This presentation is slated to cover the details of 'Eve Echoes' and other future CCP projects in the works.
---
Pearl Abyss have stated that Pearl Abyss business staff will also be joining the session for acquisition stories and would like the scene to be seen as introducing CCP Games to Korean audience.
---
'Pearl Abyss X CCP Media Talk' is to be held on March 7th 11:00.
---
&gt;  Your 'deal' was don't do that.
---
This is a weak kind of explanation for you telling your alliance that I have a "special deal" with one of the mods to get myself unbanned. To not to do the same thing is implied for every ban. It's not a special deal. Meanwhile, there was not even such a "deal". He temp banned me in the first place, and we did not even communicate before or after. A deal is something you explicitly communicate on, and agree on. Nice spin tho.
---
&gt;  Yes. I banned you from a shit posting discord server...  In fact, you are still posting right now about goonbias or whatever.
---
We still don't know for what exactly I was banned from the discord. Please show me some screenshots on that? You ban me from discord for no reason at the first place, then blame me when I talk about mod bias, which provides ground for further bans. Sounds like exactly the metagame trick you are trying to pull off to get me isolated and banned.
---
&gt;  I get that you are very bothered that I don't like you. 
---
Not really, I am not disturbed. I don't like you either. And you get fucked as well. 
---
But that shouldn't be a factor or a reason for you to predatorily find or create reasons to get me banned. That's mod privilege abuse. And you really don't need to sink to this kind of shit in a video game either.
---
&gt;  You're framing this as if I'm getting orders from Mittani to silence you or that a video game alliance has some conspiracy to control reddit
---
It's not about Mittens or top-down orders, but a culture inherent to your alliance promoting some bad behavior, and how you are participating in this behavior, to the extent that you are abusing mod powers.
---
&gt;  me saying I approved one of your posts despite not liking you. 
---
This is in no way a response to what I am saying as I already made it clear that you are not that blatant in your agenda-following, as you don't have full control of this subreddit. You already made it clear that you would not let me post, if you had the control.
---
&gt;  Oh like the actual screenshots and chat logs that completely ruin your entire post 
---
You mean the conversation that got me temp banned? I already pre-admitted that I was agitated (due to your previous bias btw) in that conversation. Imagine I am experiencing a bug 2 times in 2 posts involving Goons, which the posts disappear. Given that there are Goon mods trying to get me in the simplest mistake, there is a chance someone might be tampering with automod to cause that bug (I don't know how automod works, or whether this is possible). The very reason why I can ever think this way is your previous conduct. 
---
So I don't see how your posting of that conversation "completely ruin my entire post". I didn't even claim that I didn't deserve that ban (of which you posted the "defeater" screenshot) in my post. 
---
Like the way you are trying so hard to spin your screenshot as a "complete ruin" of my post shows your intentions are unwell and you just want to cover up your shit behavior. Here were my actual points, with which you did not engage at all:
---
- You've been actively trying to trigger me to get me banned on this subreddit.
---
- You banned me from the discord for no reason.
---
- You lied to your alliance about a "special deal", which you now spin as "not doing the same error again", which is implied in every ban ever (whereas a "deal" must be explicitly made, which there was no such deal).
---
And my suggestion was that perhaps you should stop playing this kind of metagame.
---
Also Gevlon was pretty good about letting people comment on his blog even if they were calling him a moron and demolishing his dumb arguments. Because what gevlon really wanted was attention.
---
^^(also what olmeca wants)
---
mittani with the wizard hat
---
You are under arrest
---
Well, it's not released yet, and I would hold my breath for it, can still be delayed for months.
---
Gotta love the graph range ... 4% to 5%
---
Hi dream!
---
&gt; The current war cost formula is:
---
&gt; Weekly Cost = (log N / log 1.675)^2 300000 N^0.26815
---
&gt; where N is the number of characters in the defending corp/alliance, and with a minimum cost of 50m isk per week and a maximum cost of 500m isk per week.
---
&gt; The currently planned formula after the May release is:
---
&gt; Weekly Cost = 100 million isk
---
&gt; which is a lot easier to calculate in your head. Not coincidentally, 100 million isk is quite close to the average war bill over the past few months.
---
Can't argue that logic. 
---
Yeah like I said in the youtube video comments. Some are afk ratters some are botters. In the next video ill add some evident full afk ratters, they are also from another alliance. Botters usually warp to a place and orbit a citadel or something. 
---
I think this is absolutely a huge, huge problem. This prevents a whole host of options and is incredibly detrimental to the highsec ecosystem. The suspect flag was bad, but at least you could make the choice to just go for it anyways in some situations. This effectively means that you can't have a group of distinct but friendly groups working together in highsec. Templis and DHSJ get to form fleets and share logi in lowsec, but not in highsec. That's an incredibly powerful tool. With this change, there's no way to have a smaller corp or alliance that is maybe more industrial than combat, or just newer, join in the fleet of a more experienced group and gain that knowledge without bringing them into the alliance which may not be practical for a whole slew of reasons.
---
I understand that it's a hard problem to solve, but effectively denying the ability of highsec groups to blue each other and support each other while remaining independent is a much bigger issue than you're seeing.
---
How long before goons put bee stickers in his niece's backpack?
---
Koahi how does it feel to be at the center of an Olmeca Gold conspiracy?
---
I feel pretty good all the time
---
Yeah its a pretty good gig.
---
I don't do excavators on the rorq and I don't have a super umbrella(the main reason I transitioned to subcaps). I've always wanted to try doing suicide wh diving with dreads, though.
---
I though generally when you got ganked you just threw all your fittings into a depot and retrieved it later with a br?
---
But when he posts his no traffic blog to reddit, we can comment on it!
---
Well, people have been been hoping since 2003. And in many cases it is those hopes that still keep them going. This is just one of those hopes. Though admittedly, lately the number of people losing hope and losing faith in CCP in general has been increasing quite drastically.
---
I hope we get a good Corean localization that brings more players to the server.
---
I believe your organization hurts Eve in many ways. Such as promoting krabbing culture, promoting metagame shittery, promoting lack of content, and promoting balance opinions which do not help this game at all. And I am operating to make its space less safe. I also daily see lots of broadcasters and botters in your space. I also make billions in your space, and kill billions in your space. My post history is about my Eve activities, or my balance opinions.
---
Fuck me about posting what I do in Eve, or believe about Eve, on r/eve, right. Must definitely be koolaid.
---
This is the best AAR I've ever read. 
---
Next he will say he saw a goon put bee stickers on a family members backpack.
---
I never implied rorquals weren't powerful, just that they have to be saved so you aren't getting a good fight if you try to attack rorquals.
---
Yeah, you can catch VNI bots. You just need the right fit. ;) Also, some bots do some weird things when they fail or maybe they are not configured correctly.
---
tl;dr next on the eviction list
---
Yay more bots...
---
Should we start a pool on how long til he mentally implodes? Maybe make the winning pot ten fully fit forquals, all named Olmeca's Folly.
---
Most players don't care about AT.. Fanfest on the other hand is a big let-down. Same for lackluster in-game events and bugged chat. All contributing to player disappointment past few months.
---
Is this the beginning of the end ? I am afraid. 
---
Please never stop posting, this is too good.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYI6PXBkkBs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1 ^^blame ^^harly
---
And yet we take actual beatings from people, losing regular caps and subs and generally drawing fights like the one linked here.... 
---
People see what they want to see. 
---
xenophobic much?
---
Yea, but regardless of anything, Eve 2 is just a nice thought, not even on their planning boards :(
---
This is great. And honestly, please don't ban him- It's so satisfying having a weekly "Goons r literally satan" post where he uses the fact that cap umbrellas exist or whatever to prove that goons eat babies.
---
Like, goons are b
---
Besides the fact that faxes aren't generally just chilling in a site grinding isk, yeah.
---
They are a cheap, disposable, and very effective strategic asset too.
---
I mean have you seen what happens when people just willy nilly drop supers without any chance of fax support? That is a very non-strategic move.
---
There may be issues, but frankly this is like saying you shouldn't operate to remove the cancer because the resulting scar would be unsightly. If you can come up with a perfect solution please do, but in the meantime neutral logi/links need to die in a fire.
---
fresh blood is always good
---
Left or right hand?

He's deleted the vods and copyright claimed Olmecca's reupload but I was in twitch chat at the time. 
---
I'm sorry I've upset your notion that GSF is full of flawless upstanding people. 
---
Yeahhhh the ore prices will fall! :)
---
(Yes, I'm being SARCASTIC...)
---
Six months after the acquisition - It's the standard time most companies take to evaluate their acquisition. I'd expect more high-level meetings, staff changes, and financial model changes to come shortly after this one. It pretty much always happens, as the acquired company always inflates their value prior to acquisition, so the acquirer is basically always forced to make some form of profitability change to account for that.   
---
AT ship BPCs in NES when?
---
FREE /U/KOAHI
---
you are not the hero we deserve, but the one we need
---
I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into PA wanting to show off their new purchase. But then as an eve player, I guess I would..
---
&gt; probably club baby seals on your lunch break.
---
Hey now, we're union here. I only club seals during working hours.
---
Or an rpg where the final boss is in the first city you came to 50 hours ago
---
&gt;Only one Proteus 
---
What is this amateur hour?
---
Yea, beyond hilarious. Fuck you highsec ‚Äú elite pvpers‚Äù 
---
Perimeter station made ours finally again , now this easy
---
I bet you that this didn't occur to CCP. That said, do these changes make what you described any worse? The current situation is that there is no war HQ whatsoever, so I guess it's still an improvement.
---
&gt;After the May release, whenever a corporation or alliance &gt;declares a non-mutual war they will be required to select a &gt;specific Upwell Structure (only including Upwell structures with &gt;docking facilities, not FLEX structures) they own somewhere in &gt;highsec space.
---
High Sec Islands will now be the offshore bank accounts for High Sec HQs. 
---
What do you think? How many bots are needed to make 40t with 30 mil isk/hr - abour 2000.
---
Assuming that serious rmter has 70 accounts its only 30 rmters.
---
Honestly would love having no "allies" in trash-ships on both sides of the brawl in these fights. 
---
I'm a goon and I feel like this is not cool. Spying awesome, but this kind of political maneuvering is dumb I'm. Don't make this too real pls.
---
Even if it were, no practical applied difference between the 2 now.
---
I really think you are getting yourself too much attention. Panfam are hotdroping in delve more than 2 years ago, some other alliance too (gang bang team, and so on the list is big :D), it has always been like this abd it will stay like this. You are not the first and you will be not the last. Hope you enjoy pvp against goon, hope they enjoy pvp against you. Nothing more nothing less ;) just enjoy the game and stop drama :D
---
It's not about the 100 people doing it (that's low btw), it's about the thousands that are impacted by it.  High sec is currently the only region of space where Logi all but invincible.  Engage when you want, leave when you want.
---
This is a spicy thread thanks Olmeca.
---
Sounds like some CSMs too, not just the mods.
---
Nullsec members go to Jita too, sometimes. In fact, if you look at the 70 or so wars in which PIRAT is currently engaged, they're almost entirely the large nullsec alliances.
---
This is some spicy drama. Just the type of entertainment I needed today.
---
No no no, all 150 of our titans were there, they just failed to kill anything at all, hence hardly any on KB. Yes.
---
You're an idiot
---
Says that hq had to be in HS in blog. I missed it too in first read.
---
Yeah everyone knows ratter bots are more efficient. 
---
Please don't be rude. It's unnecessary and adds nothing to this thread.
---
Hey you leave Ishtars out of this! My bby did nothing to you.
---
get good
---
Bet there's going to be a group of mercs setting up shop there that will do nothing but take contracts smashing citadels. 
---
And there it is ladies and gentlemen, the legendary Reddit "Just find a job 4Head" comment. We did it boys 
---
Ditto. This was one of my top priorities when I ran last time, and I'm happy to have been a part of finally getting this issue fixed. It's been years in the making, and I'm glad CCP was willing to do the hard work and make this a priority. 
---
uh what.
---
There were bots in the WoW bgs ever since BC.  Warden doesn't care about AHK and other types, and those are simple to make.  
---
You don't fight bots with an arms race, you fight them with lack of incentive.
---
oic thx
---
Trying to help the "small guys" is how we ended up with the current citadel mechanics.
---
Probably just doesn't want to compete with people who play the game instead of crying about it all the time.
---
You are Irrelevant compared to what they have achieved form the looks of the BR posted.
---
All those devs and you ain't playing their game.  :thinking:
---
 Look you say they harrass you. But it s you that always and always post about it, they just answer. Stop posting and they will stop answering ;)
---
$99.9 pfftt... I spent $999.99+ on Star Citizen xD
---
wow fuck you
---
gottem
---
Not a bad idea
---
You at least took the time to respond, and so I'll respond in kind.
---
&gt; This is a very personal stab at me for some reason.
---
I'm not trying to offend you. That it does is something I'll actually offer an apology for. 
---
However. Months went by with the chat server thing before you decided to communicate about it via official means. At no point between release of the chat upgrade and just recently did anyone at CCP bother to take the time to communicate on a wide scale, say, via a blog about what the problems were, what were being done to track them down and what potential fixes were being worked on.
---
I get that it takes time, but you all seem to be focused too narrowly on other stuff instead of taking the time to actually... you know... communicate with people about whats going on with what is a pretty fundamental part of the game. Sometimes, quantity of updates is better than quality. And, as you're the community guy, i'm laying that at your responsibility. I think that is fair, not personal. Its criticism, not a stab in the face.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs true that we‚Äôve taken a beating in the last few years, but we still have seriously ambitious long-term plans for EVE Online and the EVE Universe. 
---
How about you share them, then. Stop censoring the CSM report and share those plans and future plans on a wide scale. Prove me wrong. Prove to everyone that CCP is still capable of being bold and has a vision for where its going, because right now a lot of people don't see it going anywhere.
---
&gt;As we‚Äôve pointed out repeatedly, the alliance tournament is not gone. Just the same as Fanfest, it‚Äôs on hiatus for 2019 while priorities are elsewhere, and we look at how to better execute on it. Just the same as Fanfest, we fully expect it to return.
---
You understand the skepticism many of us have, I'm sure.
---
If there is some mod abusing his power to get me banned then that's worthy of posting.
---
soooo... they only need start a duel to work around this?
---
true.  Goons or Goon pets.  
---
lmbo for pinning your response u cuck
---
Look like Elo's followers went offline at this point. 
---
Google Translate spelled "Abyss" in four different ways in the same article. How strange.
---
shut up chester u big gay 
---
When you get killed on the jita undock, your alliance is not harmed the least iota. Highsec wardecs have zero effect on nullsec *alliances*.
---
Hello. There were other words next to the words "no risk". Please read all the words. There is no risk/reward _tradeoff_. _Tradeoff_ is the operative word.
---
I know there is technically &gt;0 risk. 
---
H E U L  N I C H T 
---
I don't, strictly, disagree. I do feel very strongly that without allowing for joint fleets, highsec will remain a general wasteland. All of this work will just make it somewhat less awful without actually _improving_ it, if you see what I mean.
---
To be clear I am not suggesting they halt these changes. Not at all. But highsec will remain deader than fw without joint fleets. This is applying pressure to the wound, reducing bleeding, without actually getting the patient back on his feet.
---
No one was talking about rorqs tho. It's safer and more profitable to take the same barge from HS to NS.
---
Remember the Rogue Drone event from a couple of years ago? The rewards were relatively low, but you could do them in just a couple of minutes in a pvp-fit T3D, and everyone just buzzed around from system to system running them and getting in fights. It wasn't even clear if people were trying to run the sites, or trying to kill site runners and just doing the sites to "bait" or kill time, or both - but it was really engaging, because it didn't \*matter\*. Your Hecate or whatever was great for both. That would have been a fantastic model for all Eve PVE.
---
You have some correct interpretations, but a few flaws:
---
https://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/68738/1/sinksfaucets.png
---
Active ISK was still going up, it went up 6T.
---
The cause effect here is hard to pinpoint, but PLEX is trending upwards towards the RMT -&gt; ISK ratios.  This is the type of incentive required to weed out professional botters (botting as a company income source).  Once PLEX -&gt; ISK give the seller more ISK than RMT -&gt; ISK, the only botters will be hobby botters, and maybe some stragglers in low currency countries.
---
This parity level is around 3-5bn per 500 plex.
---
Work hour worth of money? After Taxes, eve costs me 3 hours. wtf are you on about?
---
Our lord and savior has returned.
---
All praise mighty Gevlon reincarnated.
---
This can be examined in the null sec players in top 25 corps.  
---

---
Post 2015 saw both Karma fleet and PH rise.
---
As long as most = GSF - I'm down with that.
---
Most people don't really, like Reddit is likely a bad platform because most of the people on Reddit know. 
---
But goons has gone truth a massive effort in the last couple of years ( about when the re-branded from the CFC ) to appear well more socially acceptable, so pointing out that the people that consider swastika spamming an alliance policy of doxing acceptable are still in charge has some merit.
---
ITT: People who were predicting the games death and CCP to fail yesterday, are now applauding their hard work and good faiths efforts to improve the game.
---
Thanks for clarifying that. If that's what you meant then yes, I agree. A big null alliance overall is not affected by war decs.
---
You have a lot of hate for wormhole people. Now show me on the doll where the big bad wormhole people touched you. I know it's scary but you can do it.
---
Olmeca, you cry WAY to much for someone playing a video game. Seriously, it's a fucking game. You pour way to much time into your bitch/cry post about a ====&gt; VIDEO GAME ALLIANCE &lt;=== and how they are so mean to you. Goons being mean to you is of you're own doing. You brag about killing us or stealing our drones and all your dank isk, and then you come on here and bitch constantly about us. Come off really hypocritical. Whenever you feel triggered, take 3 deep breaths. put away your Goons hate boner, log out, and go do something else because clearly this is now a job for your and not a game for enjoyment.
---
Assuming you're only talking about miners, I'll give you a solid "sorta". You still have cap proliferation and further consolidated nullblobs. Some of that is the natural progression, right? Without a reason not to, people that wanna watch netflix and their wallets will consolidate cause there's safety in the herd. However, if the game is supposed to have robust conflict, this should probably be mitigated. It has been encouraged.
---
I agree, strong ships should involve more risk of losing isk on them. Like an orthrus cost more than a t1 battleship, I'm ok with that, because it can be countered. However a navy issue battleship costing more than most pirate faction battleships? Let's not even talk about a marauder costing more than a fleet dread or carrier. Now, it shouldn't be that every ships should have the same chance of winning if fighting another in it's class, there should always be subtle differences, but it should also reflect on its price.
---
&gt;posting a 500 word conspiracy theory essay about how people are trying to trigger you into discrediting yourself by posting dumb shit on reddit
---
0___0
---
How's it going friend
---
You implied exactly that lmao.
---
it's ok you can always use your botfarm isk to replace the logi losses
---
Nice
---
You kind of lose credibility for anything you say when you sticky your response.
---
&gt;&gt; Here's my **stickied using mod powers* personal attack: Get fucked, Olmeca.
---
Also an option. I just like the idea behind whole corps who organize themselves for hunting bounties.
---
Lone wolfs could still create their own small bounty hunter corps.

Blog title should have been,

     CCP, CCP sometimes releases a gud patch

Awesome, long overdue changes.

Question: Still takes a minimum of 8 days to kill a high powered citadel in highsec due to reinforcement cycles. How will defenders be able to destroy a War HQ if the war ends after 7 days? 
---
&gt;where XD   
---
&gt;its not ur drop  
---
&gt;&amp; am gregpeck
---
Good! Been replaying Witcher 3
---
blooo blooo goons troll me and make me cry
---
lol you post your screed as if no one realized this already.  you sure can dish out the shit, but wow you whine like a mule when it comes your way
---
I am not convinced it's limited to just "in game"
---
Where did Mittens go? 
---
After having played many games with a large Korean Audience for many years, I can say, It is rarely the Koreans that cheat. Most of them are just really good at what they do.
---
I mean, I've been chuckling a lot...
---
Think of how bad the botting mess would get if bitters started flying Guardian Vexors...
---
Love what I read but there is still a flaw in the HQ idea. Current reinforce timers are far too long. The last one in an astrahus can be 11 days long. So even if the defender decides to start bashing immediately it can still take like 2 weeks. Better than what we have currently though, that's for damn sure.  
---
Why the hell it takes CCP so long to do simple shit I'll never know.
---
You have control over the war. So you can end it 25 hours before the final timer of a structure, and the war is over for the timer (and since a new war takes again 24 hours to start).
---
I never understood this complaint as much. Once you rep someone the neutral logo turns suspect and is engageable anyway. I can understand why it may be seen as game breaking that you can't shoot them *until* they rep. The neutral links thing though is game breaking IMO 100%, and a good fix. It can still be used in duels in HS, but that's probably not a big part of the game.
---
From conversations on Horde comms at least, I suspect that there is a large misconception that neutral logo are entirely immune in HS which is false. It can be frustrating discussing the finer points of this game with somebody supremely confident but entirely incorrect about how it works.
---
&gt;AT ship BPCs in NES when?
---
Dont give them ideas.
---
I just bought the $250 pack days before the ten percent price reduction...feelsbadman
---
The War HQ idea was championed heavily at the end of CSM X. It's been 3 years, but I'm glad to see something come of it. A recurring concern at the time was "Won't people just anchor their wardec structure in one of those remote hisec island systems?"
---
Well, probably. Let's see what happens!
---
Just don't ask TheJudge, he can't help you there now
---
They _possibly_ want to have it also available in lowsec, and had seen the highsec restriction. Maybe.
---
He really wasn't. He let posts by people he thought he could argue against through, but if you had (in my opinion) a solid argument that showed how wrong he was, then he simply ignored it. Why else do you think he required comment approval?
---
Amazing
---
Probably because raw new player counts could be extrapolated from them.
---
Believe me, this is the one that would negatively impact the least. There's a whole swath of money grabs that would hurt the game much more.
---
Yes, grinding out a 80 mill fleet jackdaw cost me over an hour VNI ratting with 18 mill ticks, just to have the FC welp the fleet in 20 minutes (FC what do?). An interceptor or retribution is an hour to grind out. A carrier can grind one out in 20 minutes or less. That hurts, I don't skill inject cause they are too expensive for me( over a week of grinding just to save a week in training). I understand making content sometimes you just have to go for it, but welping something every other day that takes me hours to grind out is frustrating to the max when poked at for participation. I am trying with t1 cruisers and such which aren't too bad, until something t2 shows up.
---
How does that save killboard
---
That would be the worst botter in the history of botters, but a man could dream.
---
Choice between $11/hr or 11 isk/hr? Sign me up for the isk directly in my wallet!
---
so ableist
---
it's not our fault, we're just born this way
---
Reset to Apocrypha!
---
Right in his Rorqual
---
What about all the people who post about quiting Eve because \~I hate what CCP/Goons/CSM/that bad person\~ did to me?
---
It only applies in cases of war though, so it only effects 'joint fleets' for war efforts, nothing stopping casual players from grouping up and supporting each-other outside of wars, you can still do it to kill people who doing suspect related activities such as shooting deployables/can flipping. 
---
Nah, full Gevlon would be accusing /u/CCP_Falcon of goonbias and CCP having a secret conspiracy to belittle and insult him.
---
do you pay attention to the player numbers vs other successful MMOs. Eve is fucking poor by comparison. they just dont have the budget to to quickly introduce great new expansions, especially when you consider how much work needs to be done to make a 5000 player pvp fight into something vaguely approaching fun or even playable for that matter. 
---
shouldnt that be some sort of priority given that a huge draw of this game is the idea of ginormous epic space wars.
---
This is like watching Hilter (r/eve mods) vs Stalin (olmeca Mar5hy). Grabbing my ◊§◊ï◊§◊ß◊ï◊®◊ü
---
My approach is the other way round: I m retired cause of health-reasons, so I got time. Like, tons of time. Not that much money though. And I like hanging out with muh corpies, munchin some rocks, toasting some rats...Grinding ISK is only a grind, if you see it as a grind. For me its "the game" as much as spending the ISK on some shit that I get blown up in space somewhere.
---
I am the pusher robot
---
Lol fuck off retard

I guess nobody get's that this gives you a tool to figure out if anybody in highsec at war has a combat logoff timer, also it now means the safety system is no longer a helpful tool and it's usage just became mandatory for some players. ( incursion logi comes to mind ) 
---
When are we getting that low-sec gate?
---
Replacing the current staff isn't a bad thing! 
---
I always thought that the monthly cost of subscriptions when paid in PLEX is too low. 
---
Right now RMT prices swing around $10-$12 / month range, with the $12 being rare, most do not exceed $11 or they can't sell as much.
---
So if you raise the PLEX price in the game it puts pressure on shitty stuff like bots and multiboxing.
---
At the same time, if CCP lowered actual sub prices, lets say instead of a plex sale have a subscription sale, to where the 6 month sub goes just under the RMT cost per month, this would get a chunk of the legitimate players to switch while at least some of the botters and AFKers would whine and die out.
---
Added bonus: Currently a lot of players who progress a bit in the game are leaving when they find out and realize all this shit such as multi rorq mining, multi afk VNi ratting, etc. etc. It simply disgusts them and turns them off from the game. These players would instead of leaving, replace the multiboxing / botting shit. All the while, CCP would not just make up, but surpass any losses from lowering prices by increased sub volumes while the game gets healthier.
---
Its a win-win-win all around.
---
no it isn't
---
they are their own timezone with cn and au, they will not interact with us at all
---
however, consistent worldwide timezone coverage means au tz tanking aids will be less safe, which might finally, finally mean the vulnerability timer system works the way it should 
---
Good job guys
---
Or let the war lapse at the end of the week. unless they dec you back (score?), you can start it up again after it ends, with a different structure.
---
(yes, I did just explain how this is less than optimal)
---
Also, I‚Äôll use myself as an example. I don‚Äôt have the time to grind 24/7 or run 10-20 accounts to make billions of isk. In which case it is way more convenient for me to buy plex and sell it, so the higher the price the better for people like me that are occupied most of the time and get on to actually have fun and do whatever instead of mindless grind.
---
Most Incursion players had 'Green Safety' anyway to prevent a suspect timer when remote repairing someone who might be in a war or who dueled an alt to be able to kill you.   
---
If you played in Incursions with 'Yellow Safety' literally nothing is changing.   
---
I don't know what you mean by combat logoff timer? It always concords you to RR/Assist someone out of corp/alliance in a war regardless of a PVP timer. 
---
hey bby
---
Same place same time? ;)
---
Thanks Omelca for uncovering what has become "the" EVE cancer.
---
lol "promoting krabbing culture"
---
Listen you fuck. CCP designed this game so that you need to build ships before you get to blow them up. It's been that way since forever. This shit ain't a vacuum where fucking bombers pop out of NPC's assholes like this is some fucking space Bethesda game. I dunno what fucking "krab culture" means, but people fly Rorquals because their greedy fucks and CCP made them over powered, not because there's some Goon conspiracy to turn the game into a fucking PVE dick sucking fest.
---
Can we just ban all goons from r/eve? 
---
The reason people where against it then, is the type of people that declare war. 
---
We have the highsec trade hub campers ( bad )
---
The small group of folks that have some playstyle reason you mined from my highsec moon comes to mind. 
---
Now the second group is negatively impacted the high sec mercs will dump there war HQ on some high sec island and have the blue's to out form there targets with the exception of maybe the large nullblocs. ( if they particular care to kill a random rat on a highsec island ). 
---
It just encourages more Blue donut mercs. 
---
Hahahahahaha the butt PIRAT‚Äôs and other asshat hisec wardec corps can kiss my fat bumpy ass.
---
CCP are morons, I'm sorry, cretins.
---
PvP is the ONLY attractive piece of Eve. Well if you want PvP, why don't you fly into goon(insert insert) blue ball, fight capitals with a cruiser. 
---
CCP are you have improved old aggression mechanic, 80% of people I met on Eve had quit. Good boy, you've shit right in the living room.
---
New people come to join, and they say it's boring as hell in WH space, others say it's boring in 0.0. hey CCP phycos, did you know it's hard to have fun in Eve? A buddy of mine left Eve saying "server numbers are 30% boots and multiboxers, I would setup everything ready to go and kill nothing in an hour. Eve time to fun ratio is down, I don't think it's coming back up" 
---
CCP, you decided to listen to crybabies who play 8 hours a week, ignored people who play 8 hours a day.
---
I hope you get everything what's long over due. I will take part in it, because I can no longer advocate for Eve. 
---
Look! There's people who aren't green or blue in local!
---
It actually is depending on who you're talking about. A lot of the staff really love the game, and initially started working there because they love the game. As a business, it's commonly difficult to find people that have that level of dedication to your product. They tend to work harder than people who have no emotional attachment to the product.
---
Or just make it so that corps can't wardec corps they're on the same FW side since they're ostensibly supposed to be on the same side anyways.
---
The question always comes up: how did you figure out how to get 75bill, but not figure out you should be moving that in a JF, or at least a &lt;2 second ceptor with tank, or.... warp to pings. Is it just that once you have a 15 ~~bot~~ man rorqual fleet even 75bill is nothing and you don't bother making an effort because, "muh ticks!"?

yes!

that supposed coalition consists of absolute trash. i doubt they can even think of fighting off guristas pirates. pure, blind and simple garbage

---
You don't need a fleet for those things. And no, you couldn't rep each other there either. 
---
I have a feeling that PLEX prices affected the bot numbers more then anything. Sure, the big botters are unaffected yet due to massive stockpiles and all that, but the small ones are feeling it.
---
Also a lot of PvE players have stopped logging in and cancelled subs / omega due to Guardian Gala fiasco. And some PvP players as well due to the AT shit. So these and others like them are also clients that no longer log in.

---
I have nothing but respect for what Chribba does at eve-offline, but it's almost impossible to read any conclusions from his data the way he displays it.
---
Here's a true picture of the last 12 months, right up to this afternoon:
---
http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-2019.png
---
Daily active users is down about 3.5% since January 1, but that is completely typical of past years. EVE's highest daily average user count for the year nearly always happens within a week of the end of January and has for years and years, other than 2016 when it was artificially moved to November by Ascension and 2014 when it was moved by a [minor player action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB) (the peak that year happened the first week in March).
---
There's no evidence in the data that shows CCP has taken a one-day action against bots. I'm sure the action they take is spread out over many days over the course of the year, but I'm equally sure that most botters shrug and start again with a new account, causing only very minor ripples in the daily user average.
---
The next anti-botting change that *might* show up in the daily user average data is the restriction of L4 and L5 missions to Omega accounts [scheduled for the March release](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pn66sg/security-update-q1-2019?origin=launcher).
---
If you want to be worried about something relative to EVE's daily average users, be worried that EVE *didn't* get the 25-30% increase this January that it gets every year. I'd point that one firmly at the lack of player content this winter rather than anything CCP is doing.

You are also grossly underestimating how many people play HS PvE and how many of those left due to the event being the final nail in the coffin for them.
---
All the Olmeca hate in this thread is clear evidence that goons have successfully taken total control over the subreddit.

No it doesn't because most of the wardec groups are spoiler blue to 1 and other and given this change breaking that donut isn't worth it because it means you likely will lose your ability to generate off contract content

---
&gt;IF you had professionals writing these bots, they wouldn't be stuck in bubbles
---
Bubbles are a rare enough thing that the bot doesn't need to bother.  When you're talking about fundamental game mechanics, the bot needs to bother.
---
For example, all the bots that used to use a supercarrier were updated for the new fighter mechanics.  That's a bit more work than "d-scan before warp".
---
&gt;they wouldn't warp to anomalies that are already there
---
...how do you expect the bot to start it's day then?  It's got to start with an anomaly that already exists.

&gt;they wouldn't fail when local disappeared

Again, rare enough you don't bother to program for it.

Oh wait.

No the issue isn't really to do with suspect, even though suspect is fucking dumb.
---
They became valid war targets before too, temporarily so that was never a fix.
---
The issue was your gang of six finds a warred gang of three.
---
Me and my other 5 friends call a fight outside station and get logi to protect the three(we don't care about the three, we just side with them because a) content b) the perceived winners are more likely to take on more than they can chew) the six see a single logi and engage me- I'm excited now, and I slowly pull the rest of my Corp into the fight and eventually theoretically your now outnumbered because of some neutral entity. 
---
In reality obviously you will just drop grid / safe / deagress because you can no longer kill anything.

The issue is I can do this with any group making the war mechanic pointless.

PLEX prices have almost zero relation to anything in the economy (outside the things they actually buy, where they have an almost perfect relationship, like Extractors, injectors, and skins still on sale and not dropped in game).
---
T1 (Minerals only) cheaper on the whole because of rorq mining.
---
T2 (Minerals + Moon Goo) about double or triple in prices after things settled form moon changes, this was just as true when PLEX was sub 2.7m.
---
If stuff is getting more expensive in jita, it's because less people are producing for and shopping in Jita.

Shadow Cartel have 714 as per zkill - [SC](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/495729389/)

Last I checked 860+714 (1574) is larger than 1380 then they still call on shoot first ([330](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008458/)) and others.

To say they're not being blobbed fighting down in Minmatar lowsec is pretty disingenuous.

Provably, WITH HIS OWN LOGS, fucking delusional.
---
&gt; A deal is something you explicitly communicate on, and agree on.
---
You agree to it or he bans you. That's the deal he gave you.
---
&gt; We still don't know for what exactly I was banned from the discord. 
---
We have a rule that says "No unfunny garbage"
---
&gt; But that shouldn't be a factor or a reason for you to predatorily find or create reasons to get me banned. That's mod privilege abuse. And you really don't need to sink to this kind of shit in a video game either.
---
I can shit post about whatever I like. That's the beauty of it. If I wanted to get rid of you and your insane honeypot rant threads I could have simply done it for spamming mod mail. In fact,  you shit up modmail again with dumb garbage the other day. You were warned about that but still did it - so there's the justification I "need" right there. You're still not banned though - ask yourself why.
---
&gt; It's not about Mittens or top-down orders, but a culture inherent to your alliance promoting some bad behavior, and how you are participating in this behavior, to the extent that you are abusing mod powers.
---
What have I done as a mod on reddit that is abuse, exactly? All you've got so far is that I made fun of you in a public jabber channel. One that I don't even control. One that is also, amazingly, not reddit.
---
&gt; This is in no way a response to what I am saying as I already made it clear that you are not that blatant in your agenda-following, as you don't have full control of this subreddit. You already made it clear that you would not let me post, if you had the control.
---
The only thing stopping me from banning you currently is the fact that I believe in not removing topics of discussion and fairness. I don't need some arbitrary 'control of reddit' or whatever the hell you are trying to imply. You single handedly managed to piss off *every single mod* because you clutter up the subreddit with garbage bias threads where your evidence is someone saying a mean word to or about you. This is the exact kind of thing you cry about in mod mail. You also have directly lied in this thread on multiple occasions - and I've called you out for it each time. Nice spin though - Mittani would be proud (peace be upon him).
---
&gt; You mean the conversation that got me temp banned? I already pre-admitted that I was agitated (due to your previous bias btw) in that conversation.
---
You mean the conversation I had no part of about an issue I had nothing to do with? If you can't even follow your own narrative here... How the hell am I supposed to follow yours?
---
&gt; Imagine I am experiencing a bug 2 times in 2 posts involving Goons, which the posts disappear.
---
You think Jabber is discord so it's not surprising that you struggle to use computers.
---
&gt; Given that there are Goon mods trying to get me in the simplest mistake, there is a chance someone might be tampering with automod to cause that bug
---
No, there is 0 chance it's automod because of the direct proof you were provided. Check next to the username of the thread. Do you see a checkmark or is the post red? Guess what - no mod action happened. Feel free to test this yourself by creating your own subreddit.
---
&gt;  The very reason why I can ever think this way is your previous conduct.
---
You conflicted your own narrative again. Your screenshot is after the conversation in modmail. 
---
&gt; You and your buddies have been actively trying to trigger me to get me say bannable things on this subreddit, so you can jump in and ban me.
---
What buddies? Otherwise - welcome to bait. This is r/eve, you must be new here.
---
&gt; You banned me from the discord for no reason.
---
It's literally my discord server. The reason I banned you is because you post unfunny garbage. You will remain banned from it until you start posting good.
---
&gt; You lied to your alliance about a "special deal", which you now spin as "not doing the same error again", which is implied in every ban ever (whereas a "deal" must be explicitly made, which there was no such deal).
---
So the deal is now "special"? I don't know what you cut with zelden - I just know Zelden said you've been good since they you two had a chat. That is why the word 'deal' is in quotation marks in your screenshot. It's funny you missed that bit and hinged your entire argument around it. 
---
**tl;dr:**
---
&gt; Here were my actual points, with which you did not engage at all:
---
1: Baiting is literally allowed on r/eve.  
---
2: It's my discord server. Get out.  
---
3: Deal is in quotations marks, referencing a comment [Zelden made](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ar0oxj/its_time_for_shark_week_im_going_to_destroy_every/egkfow9/) about you.
---
Sounds pretty awesome to mess around with.

INb4 "GM bias" threads when he dies and doesn't get reimbursed.
---
Why aren't they changing the wardec system to only allow corps with highsec structures to get wardecced? The only reason wardecces are used is to attack highsec structures or to grief corps. If the corp has no highsec structures is shouldn't be wardeccable.
---
I approved it, actually. This isn't the first time he's made this dumb thread. He see's goon and loses his mind.

The target of your reps has to be at war and currently engaged in PVP for the changes to apply.  So if they're not at war, you can rep them.
---
https://i.imgur.com/KnuRXO1.png kek
---
So can we have honest and open dialogue with the mods here? Because in the past when I've been forthcoming about mod abuse or biased, I've just been met with "haha we will start with your post." And a ban from r/eve.
---
You seem like a pretty level headed mod but everyone else is just a smug little shit about the "power" they have on a reddit sub for a dying video game. 
---
There is a real problem with the moderation(or lack thereof) in the subreddit. But don't bring it up because you'll just get banned. 
---
You are going to have so much more fun now.
---
When you declare war on for example goons... You are going to get content brought to your highsec structure.  I would have previously said this is hardly fair.  But since you like highsec PvP... with neutral logi and neutral command links thats the kinda one sided pvp you like.
---
I hope you enjoy it.

neutral logi in hisec has been a problem since eve was created, iirc a group called mo0 used to camp gates in hisec killing people and just tanking concord with remote reps
---
I appreciate you trying to make my point.  The bots are not programmed that well because they cannot deal with rare things (e.g. unexpected events).  So changing little things will screw them up.  Unless you think that the bot programmers will spend their time planning for unknowns instead of something simple like a bubble?
---
honestly, i'd rather have the developers stop coding entirely and just shut the servers down, this "game" is just a cashgrab at this point and people are still hanging on to it like it's some godsend miracle... the devs literally shit on you every chance they get and everyone just gobbles it up, takes another plate and asks for more...
---
I'm planning to improve and implement that stuff over time.  
---
It's primarily a tracking list so people know what is or isn't expected to match in game behavior.  
---
Was there anything specific you were looking at?  
---
Link lossmail. [This](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75393481/) by any chance?
---
Imagine the Marmite and PIRAT tears, it will be glorious...
---
There hasn‚Äôt been a good /r/Eve dramapost in a while. Remind the world it exists. 
---
This could be real because it totally leaves out NPC drones regions.
---
In HS, in a team a vs team b engagement generally one (or both) will have alts out of Corp (neutral) and they will act as logistics and for the most part be safe from getting shot
---
Because the first time I posted, it somehow got unlisted from the main Eve subreddit. For some reason, it now seems to be unlisted again! No idea what is going on :(
---
Can you provide examples? I'm not writing off your complain but it's very easy to claim mod bias and then find that after a little digging the claims are completely untrue.
---
Case in point the guy responding to Jibrish about modbias when all of his posts have literally been low effort memes. 
---
There is definitely a gap currently in the late US/AU tz and that's something we should look to fill. Outside of that I'm very frequently checking the modqueue and answering modmails.
---
If you think there's an excess of content that shouldn't be on /r/eve, we try to take a hands-off approach in a lot of circumstances, particularly when it comes to comments. That said anything reported is looked at and I've personally handed out temp bans for remarks that are overly offensive or inflammatory. The other side of the coin would be a subreddit where you have to think a lot before you type or else face your comment being removed. I don't think anyone wants to come to a thread to find a chain of deleted comments.

They will gift him a tant≈ç and ask him to perform sudoku on camera...
---
Hmm, i thought your definition of pvp was ganking null sec freighters and viators?
---
God forbid your war target shot back.
---
Previously, targets never bothered cause you 15 neutral guardians would protect you until you could dock up at jita 4-4.    Now, you can't get neutral assistance and have to actually risk participation in real pvp, which involves possible real ship losses. 
---
They already did that in November... 
---
&gt;"the last place that was dangerous"
---
  &gt;*Relies on safe neutral logi to rep their blingy proteus while killing a t1 hauler*
---
It's minimum 5 days.
---
If the attacker times it perfectly, they can stretch it to 10 days, assuming they renew the war for it's second week.
---
*How will they whore on kills now flying logi?!*
---
So if I understood well, If me and you are in a fleet and only I attack someone in HS, you will also go suspect?
---
How do you lose a mining ship!!? Rorquals are quite strong.
---
If you are in corp a (which is wardecced) and I am in a NPC corp and you shoot corp B (who war decced you) and I repair you, I would go suspect.
---
&gt; I believe your organization hurts Eve in many ways.
---
You don't know anything about it and this post is proof. For some reason you think I'm mad about you killing goon krabs. Hint: I'm not. PvE in eve is the single most boring thing and the fact that it's effectively a requirement to play (due to the games grindy nature) is my single biggest issue with the games design. I also don't like bots. I'm sure some goons are pissed about it but I think it's funny. Especially when you kill PLA.
---
&gt; And I am operating to make its space less safe.
---
Then why are you trying to create a safe space by whining to us when someone calls you lonely?
---
&gt; Fuck me about posting what I do in Eve, or believe about Eve, on r/eve, right. Must definitely be koolaid.
---
You have a hard on for this 'goons control reddit' thing which is definitely kool aid. You flip flop between "you don't control reddit!" to "goons control reddit!" (I'm the only goon mod, outside of koahi whose here to help with shark week).
---
&gt; Not that I have elaborate arguments for every claim I ever made about Goons, which you never engage.
---
You are engaged each and every time, directly - with gigantic fucking walls of text. Every time you try and dance away and spin the hell out of something I come at you directly. I've *stickied your mod bias threads* before. I put my response right at the top of your thread. I replied to every single line - with quotes.
---
You're just a compulsive liar with some seriously messed up issue. Seek help.
---
I bet olmecas next thing is to pay two guys he knows to beat him up and put a noose on his neck and call it a hate crime.
---
The system is fucked but the challenge to killing people in hisec isn't in being good at the mechanics of pvp, its in knowing where to find targets and how to engage them. 
---
I used to join hisec corps to kill people before that was changed, and the challenge was in figuring out which targets were worth your time.
---
Well that's cool and right actually. Thanks for explaining me!
---
I hope people would fight in Eve as much as they fight on forums üòÇ

Fool me once, shame on god. Fool me twice, shame on init. OUT WITH YA FUCK

Simple as that.
---
I actually get slightly worried that when people get to this level of unnatural hatred towards a group it's because they associate it with something that's going on in their personal life. Like he's viewing goons with such hatred and animosity that its plausible he's viewing them as his real life bullies if he's in that situation. Like I hate Panfam but I would still happily buy anyone in panfam a beer in real life and shoot the shit. But this, this seems like it's on a whole different level. 
---
it applied to limited engangements as well
---
386 responses and counting. Sort by controversial. Yeah, I think you're right.
---
Can you add structures for bashing time?
---
The default overview in addition to the fundimental PvP issues pointed above also fails for PvE. It needs a seperate tab for wrecks, containers, explo containers, mission objectives, even things such as MTUs and some structures, for example the Cathedral found in DED sites, should be on this TAB,  etc. And a seperate TAB for NPCs, although the NPC TAB should also include player ships for the times when someone warps in on you while you are doing your PvE. This is of utmost importance.
---
In addition, many PvE NPC types are by default completely excluded and new players do not know or are not proficient at adding them into their overviews. 
---
I don't mind helping out I've played off and on for years I recommend trying to run some of the starter missions as it'll let you try a little of everything to see what you like to enjoy. I normally play mornings weekdays and on all the time weekends. US west coast feel free to shoot questions and I'll answer when I'm on

Re your latest comment in that AskReddit thread. You aren't 'famous' for spending $99.99 on PLEX, your getting attention because these most of these sperglords won't admit that they have done the same / can't work out that going 'Eh, I'll buy PLEX' every once and a while adds up.

To clarify this showed up on hoboleaks a few months ago, but only just recently became accessible on the test server.
---
I would recommend joining newbie friendly alliances like Brave.

They will help and teach new players for all kinds of stuff and they are also part of Legacy coalition, so you get in to those massive fights.
---
There is also other newbie friendly alliances, like Pandemic Horde, Goons Karmafleet and Test alliances Brave newbros.

no its fine, it isnt a shit post, its a real life story. People need this, it isnt like one of my posts, totally isnt an alt reddit account to see if the shitposting was targetted or not

The changed it to say any structure no high-sec, so technically owning a poco in a random ass wormhole makes my alt corp subject to wardecs. 
---
underrated post that will die unread by many... goons are cunts that deserve everything coming their way and more...

There's literally no doxxing in what you posted. You linked a thread of Olmeca crying about something and no RL information what so ever was in it. Unless you mean the guys real life twitter that you just blasted out into this thread.

---
Ah damn, must've missed it
---
Solitude will become quite important real estate after this.
---
&gt;The number of total pvp kills across all wars has also gone up, but that particular number is strongly influenced by the current Perimeter trade hub conflicts so we don't consider it to be a reliable indicator of the impact of the December changes (at least until we get data from a substantially larger period of time).
---
yay for Horde and Test messing up CCPs ability to easily extrapolate the numbers
---
Well bear in mind, with the exception of the recent Perimeter battles, high sec wars usually have smaller numbers of combatants.  Even the large fights would be "small gang" by nullsec standards.   So having neutral logi is a big gamechanger in terms of visible force disparity.  Combine this with station games and gate mechanics and the side using them could often engage at will with pimped ships knowing they could safely disengage thanks to their logi if threatened.
---
On top of this of course, is the effect it has on positioning and targeting.  In nullsec, in fights below alpha damage thresholds, breaking up or punishing logi positioning is pretty standard.  Now imagine if the opposing logi could not only achieve perfect positioning while you have no recourse, but also stagger when they're engageable.   
---
It's extremely difficult to kill anything under these conditions.  They can rep from the optimal position to rep their targets without being caught themselves, and either stagger the reps to their logi, or just have logi disengage prior to being threatened directly, while staggering their reps on the actual war targets.
---
The end result is predictably the experienced party being able to engage with virtual impunity, especially against the small,  inexperienced,  or isolated targets they favor. 
---
Big if True.
---
&gt; ...but I do feel like it will make high sec safer, which I'm not really keen on
---
Well if it works as intended it's considerably *less* safe for the aggressor. Overall high-sec isn't any safer it's just that the risks have been rebalanced so they're not one-sided. Now instead of the only realistic counterplay to being wardecced being evasion the defender has a victory condition which involves them actual fighting. If Test brings a 100 man fleet to bash PIRAT's structure then PIRAT can damn well raise their own fleet to defend and everyone will have fun. If they don't want to engage in gameplay that involves risk... screw them this is Eve. 
---
I've been away from eve for a long while now. Not sure what's happening here and am not taking sides. One thing I do know, is as soon as you start attacking someones personal character calling them lonely? Using your mod powers to stick your response first, trash talking him with your answers and flat out calling him names. You are wrong and proving his point even if it's untrue or most likely in this case way over exaggerated. As a mod you should be ashamed of this response and take better pride in cleaning up this community and providing a better open forum. If you or your team did nothing wrong simply state show proof and move on. 
---
Your tank and support skills carry over. For example skills for Adaptive Invuln, capacitor, navigation (warping, AB, MWD), support skills such as missile flight time, missile precision, etc apply all across for all missiles.
---
By default, the smaller versions of things such as remote reps, neuts, local reps (both shield and armor) simply have lower skill requirements to equip, but use the same skills.
---
The only ones that will change are the weapon skills themselves and MJD once you get to hulls big enough to use MJDs. Some specialized stuff such as Assault Damage COntrols is obviously usable by Assault Frigs and HACs.
---
So realistically speaking, you're best jsut setting a goal for single weapon types and concentrate on it. For example light missiles for kitey frigs, HAMs for cruisers, Cruise missiles for Battleships. If you spread into different types, they will be ineffective for much longer, until you reach an appropriate skill level with them, also, if you intend to stay alpha there is a total skill point cap, so again if you spread yourself too much you'll be kinda screwed.
---
Can confirm. The same thing happened to me a few times. I was astonished by his stupidity and thought I must comment to save people from believing the crap he posts there. He never let my comments through. It's pretty typical for a person with his belief system.

if your looking to stay in highsec to get your feet on the ground. join the E-UNI channel. they'll answer anything.

if your looking to just jump in and get in the middle of the game.  Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, or Brave.   they'll all help you get set up, and you can't go wrong with any of them.

What if every bounty placed is like a contract. When the target is killed the kill mail is sent to the contract creator and they need to accept the kills as an acceptable kill or not. If it's acceptable the killer gets the bounty or a portion of the bounty. If it isn't they don't get anything. If they kill a ship that's more expensive than the bounty they get the whole thing regardless.

&gt;No low effort shitposts Mspaint images or simple Eve logo copy pastes onto a pic - they will be removed. This includes generic meme templates - though sometimes we let them through. Post at your own risk. Read this post Expect 1-3 temp bans if you ignore this rule
---
Train up a cruiser to run level 4s, not T3C. Either faction or HAC. By default any cruiser that you can do full clears of the big L4 missions can also farm T3 AByss. Advance to T4 Abyss when you're ready and have T3s on farm, once you have T4s on farm, advance to T5s. T5s will always remain challenging, even if you have them on farm cause there is always "that" spawn that will get you or you'll mess up on your overheating timing or something.

We‚Äôre talking about neutral logi interfering in wars aren‚Äôt we?

Have the faction police bash the structure themselves? Don't see why they'd do nothing about an enemy structure in their system.

Noone complains about memes, they laugh for a second and move on.

Do you mean for actual fights or uncontested structure bashes?

Not that I care either way, but this is interesting to see after I just watched a video interview of Mittens talking all the ways he uses mind games to win (or avoid) wars. This type of thing sounds like what he was describing. I'll try to find the video, but it's a couple years old.

OP gives Team Security too much credit.

If these were bots, then those who are botting "professionally" will have replaced them, this is a downward trend of people leaving the game...
---
&gt;I'm not saying they are wrong doing what they do
---
Thats OK, I'll say it. They're fucking shit for destroying the game for everyone else.
---
95% of the ''memes'' are complete ass garbage shit that got reposted x times.

id rather miss out on the 5% that are good than getting spammed with the same shit over and over again tbh...

Wooo, this is going to be great fun to play with

just take mod away from nullsec corp mods and give it to some asexual robots so there can be no bias. case closed.
---
You drink the same water every day, even if its a clone of the day before, why dont you stop that? Because it isnt so bad, and the yelling stops
---
Definetly, it should cost at least 5-6 hours / day while super ratting.
---
Seriously, give this man his titan already.
---
I still say most of what the gsme needs is a drastic increase to mining and ratting anom respawn timers. It could single-handedly deal with isk faucets, super cap umbrellas, cap proliferation, rorq multiboxing, nullsec blobbing, and even botting to an extent, while aldo likely somewhat reinvigorating other areas of space like WHs and LS as some folks only following the isk seek greener pastures than fortress delve.
---
TL;DR version: grrr gons, hat gons.
---
How does this affect logi for hi-sec pvp that doesn't involve wars?
---
Example: Player A is not at war, but is attacking a suspect flagged player. Can player A receive logi still, or will logi will concordoken? That seems dumb if so.
---
&gt; One thing I do know, is as soon as you start attacking someones personal character calling them lonely? You are using your mod powers to stick your response first
---
I didn't call him lonely.
---
&gt; trash talking him with your answers and flat out calling him names.
---
This isn't the first time he's done this. I've wasted enough of my life responding to Olmeca's baseless accusations and outright lies (As shown elsewhere in this thread). Enough is enough, I'm calling a spade a spade. I get you don't know the history here but suffice to say there is a lot. I don't particularly care if you don't like that I told him to "get fucked". This is an open shit posting subreddit and he's come at me a half dozen times now, blatantly lies and wastes dozens upon dozens of hours of time we volunteer for this place. The simple fact of the matter is he doesn't like goons and I'm the only goon mod - so he's coming after me solely based on that. He's been doing so for nearly 2 years now. He can fuck right off with that.
---
*shudders in memory of getting meepwnd*
---
Why does everyone think that the accounts botting are alphas... Run the math on profitability of an alpha vs an omega botting in a VNI... or as an explorer bot vs omega explo bot... 
---
Remember that it takes CCP months upward of a year to catch these bots, so an investment is well worth the return if for RMT purposes.
---
I can only think of 2 "fair" solutions. Either remove the Bays as a module and just make it an automatic function. Then nobody can offline them to conserve fuel, and you always have your clones.
---
Or kill the clones when the Bay goes offline. Then you don't need to worry about regaining access, b/c it's gone.
---
Not true, Botters only need a few hours ratting in VNI;s to afford an account for the month. The rest is just profit &gt; RMT &gt; $$$'s
---
You can but whats the fun in that?
---
CCP won't reinvent the wheel because PvE is shit, that would require them to completely rethink their approach to PvE in the game, which just won't happen. At most we would get some minor change that won't really make a difference...
---
Changing PvE in this game is akin to porting it to a new engine - not doable, or CCP just won't do it...
---
You're wading into something you probably don't want to, friend. Suffice to say you don't have nearly enough information about the history of this sub nor its mods.

Exactly. I was hoping the community would see this as a post in good humor, not meant to offend anyone or complain about anything in the game. I am honestly surprised that this was removed, as people seemed to be enjoying it.
---
Null blobs has always been the go to place for ratting as well.  That too has not changed. 
---
This sub is full of mods that feel a NEED to censor things that dont need to be, and a huge followership of sheep with hurt feelings

Ah, appreciate it!

&gt; We have a rule that says "No unfunny garbage". It's literally my discord server. The reason I banned you is because you post unfunny garbage. You will remain banned from it until you start posting good.
---
Care to provide proof on unfunny garbage? I literally posted nothing on that discord except helping wormholers, sharing my moneymaking methods or helping new players here and there. You pinged me in the general chat, dared me on whether you can ban me, I told you you can't (as I didn't do anything wrong), and you banned me. Just because you were memeing with your friends about me.
---
PS: You marketed it as r/Eve server, not your server, which is why I was there. I am not interested in being in your server.
---
&gt; I can shit post about whatever I like. 
---
The issue is not was not whether you can, but whether you should. If you are too closed to criticism about the toxic behavior and culture you represent then there is nothing we can talk about anyway.
---
&gt; You also have directly lied in this thread on multiple occasions  - and I've called you out for it each time.
---
Where?
---
&gt; You conflicted your own narrative again. Your screenshot is after the conversation in modmail.
---
You kicked me from the so-called r/Eve discord server and [even told me you did it out of a dare](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8zdayp/is_olmeca_gold_the_new_gevlon_goblin/e2i89eu/). I am not contradicting anything. Your hostility is way older than the modmail conversation. I had every reason to think it is possible that you were tampering with automod, when I was having those problems. You provided proof to me that it wasn't automod, but then the convo already came to mod bias exists or not. And I said it does, which was the point I was banned for, and it still does.
---
&gt; Baiting is literally allowed on r/eve.
---
And again, my post is not whether being a predatory mod to get someone banned is allowed in this subreddit, but is about whether you should be one. Perhaps you should reconsider your cultural habits.

This is the quality I have come to expect. Thank you.

I'd point out veiled threats aren't a great way to interact with those you're moderating, but that might spook you into acting unprofessionally. Not that acting unprofessionally appears to be much of an issue for you, given your responses to the OP above.

These meatballs are spicy.

At most I implied that rows won't be able to take a large fleet by themselves. Which is absolutely true.

If you don't have a lot of logi, a well-saturated anom (15 rorqs) will be able to whittle down slow cruisers or under tanked battleships, but they'll still need to be saved in most situations.

(Also just for posterity the average rorqs pilot gets closer to 850 dps without using augmented drones, faction ddas, or geckos.)

I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not being rushed

Delve is goons.
---
I for one didn't have to read it, which worked perfectly for me! Everybody was happy!
---
I feel like you missed the joke there by a mile.
---
This. Probably the only benefit of them cashing in on AT BPCs is that they'd have to rework the older ships.
---
RLML Caracal are just fun. You and your friend should buy a few and go wild in low sec.
---
Also HonorBound Phoenix is recruiting
---
What's this thing about bots?  Haven't played in a year or so.  Are bot accounts a problem now?
---
Its fucking delicious. We live for this shit.
---
Thinking more like highsec Pirate FOB bashes.
---
Nice video!
---
Would give gold but too broke
---
  This is way way waaay overdue  as was wardec system.Too bad good change comes too late and in too small doses for this game
---
\&gt;he doesn't pick up an extra shift at work to make 10bill a week in an internet spaceship video game
---
Never gonna make it
---
You can feel that way if you want, it‚Äôs a free country.
---
Yeah, your not wrong.
---
Its one of those shitty situation where to be competitive people abuse what they can with the excuse "My enemies are doing it, if i don't do it as well, they will overtake me".
---
To be honest, if i had the time/safety to run 10 Rorquals, i would, just like i suspect most people would :)
---
 He'll do fine talking is easy delivering the product is hard
---
Not only, but yeah. Basically any time a neutral can assist in PvP with impunity. So, duel, wardec, anything.
---
Solid video!
---
That's probably a authenticity page. If your unsure just ask anyone in the brave chat channels. 
---
Red vs. Blue might be still alive, and of course e-uni are all good choices.
---
I would look for a smaller Corp that actively PvPs as they seem to be more open to new guys and are willing to mentor even the newest guys. In that note, Honerbound Phoenix is recruiting.
---
Fake news destroyed
---
He clearly did not get the joke at all, as it was clearly relevant to anyone that had flown a ship with a jump portal generator.
---
&gt; who you're talking about. A lot of the staff really love the game, and initially started working there because they love the game. A
---
I also am afraid :(
---
CCP is too busy developing mobile games for the Chinese market than working on their main product. They will never learn, I guess. 
---
Thanks, I have considered adding mid-simulation AI controls.  
---
I don't plan to mimic traditional rts games where you construct units and harvest resources.

need to add

He makes mad shit up to get attention and fuel his persecutory bullshit ideas. He's actually worse, in that he is not, in fact, oppressed in any way.
---
Nightmare?
---
I dunno im pretty pumped for EVE Toronto.
---
A lot of groups expect you to log into their web services with Eve's "single sign on" (SSO) tech as a security measure and such. If you fill in your eve info, you'll get a page that says what all you are consenting to then seeing about your character before you ok it or not. You can later delete permissions you've given out through thr eve website. There's probably an Eve uni or official page about this stuff you can get details from if you need.

I thought it was his nyx
---
Yeah but wouldn't this only work if you're flying logi? I don't think it's as useful as you suggest.
---
How does the safety system stop being helpful if its usage also mandatory?
---
Also, bear with me, what benefit do you gain from knowing someone has a logoff timer?
---
Please, dont be negative. This does not help the thread. Grow up
---
i have been wardecced a fair bit, there was no challenge in how they chose me, they simply saw me in space multiboxing 10 ships and wardecced or saw me flying a freighter and wardecced. 0 challenge involved here, just a little bit of isk and have plenty of decs active and you are set. I had even inflated my war dec cost to 150 or 200m and it made no difference, having loads of wars in my corps history that show 0 kills made no difference, the only thing that mattered is that they saw me in space. 
---
back in the watch list days there was some challenge involved but let's not pretend that that is how majority of war decs corps operated, they camped trade hubs for the most part
---
It in no way needs to be deep blue level, small tweaks work.  e.g. make rats randomly warp to a "perch" out of range when they are taking damage then ratters will have to add a point to their ratting fit for example if they want to be efficient.
---
Currently that's the case but not after the changes. RRing a duel will give criminal, though command bursts just won't be effective (if I understood correctly)
---
Will the bot be able to actively reflect that one overly drunk dude in fleet who passed out in his chair and fell behind?
---
Will this be streamed?
---
Can ccp introduce their plan to ... the god damn fucking community that plays it also at some point? 
---
Asking for Brisc 
---
&gt; is akin to porting it to a new engine
---
You mean like how they made the diamond rat toolkit
---
High plex prices are good.
---
A newbro who buys PLEX with $ and sells it on the market should get as much as possible.
---
And the veteran who puts the buy orders on the market to buy the newbros plex SHOULD pay a hefty price.
---
Paq? Hes sc tho
---
Probably because it was shit
---
PL 2.0?
---
jesus christ can you fuck off already, you are the most insufferable sperglord since...holy shit are you actually Xenuria? 
---
thats fair though, null/wh corps shouldn't be immune because they have no hs structures
---
I agree
---
CCP, no need to belabor the point. Thanks for this.   
---
I know i can be cruel, you did the right thing here.
---
The big issue about suspect is, imo, it doesn't flag until they activate modules. So if you have a guy on you, who you could maybe 1v1, and his neutral logi shows up, until you start winning that fight, there's nothing you can do to get rid of the logi or scare him off. So it's a guaranteed loss unless you can somehow tank the guy long enough to kill the logi or make him disengage, but at that point they'll both probably just wuss out and retreat.
---
With this update, sure, logi is still safe until it engages, but now if it engages at all, it'll have til CONCORD shows up to contribute anything before getting popped. So it greatly disincentivizes neutral logi.
---
This. Stop being a idiot and know who owns the citadel atleast too make sure nothing will happen to the cit before you can evac
---
Shit, Jin was the one who kicked you from the CSM discord? I thought I did that. I guess I just kicked Seraph. 
---
Anyway, you often ask why folks dislike you - this post is basically why. 
---
If you are going to attempt to insult someone, especially when it comes to mental capacity, at least spell it correctly moron.
---
\&gt;Unless you mean the guys real life twitter that you just blasted out into this thread. 
---
Posted once, already posted in that previous thread, it's his gaming twitter as evidenced by his repeated stream links and also linked off his twitch - nt though. 
---
After chasing it up for evidence of the doxxing I've been told it didn't happen and it did happen so I'm going to assume it didn't per lack of evidence and amend the original post. If I wanted to go for low hanging fruit I wouldn't have posted "nastiness all round".
---
Overview is everything.
---
With this change though, him healing would make him a criminal, which makes CONCORD attack him. So it really discourages neutral logi.
---
Same. It seems that as high as the price per unit is, people will still happily shell out billions with great speed to buy them from me.
---
So North Korea? Because the rest of the country doesn‚Äôt get a say?
---
^sorry I had to make that joke
---
To this day I'm not sure who issued that ban, but jintaan said he did.
---
I like when a goon living in his own circlejerk speaks in terms of how everyone is not liking me. Guess I shouldn't expect you to be different.
---
I'm not asking why goons dislike me. I know they will with this thread. I am not after their sympathy. If you are closed minded enough to be unable to take criticism that you shouldn't commit predatory reddit modding and irl isolationism vs your in-game enemies, we have no common ground to talk anyway. I will just keep exposing your shitterym
---
Check the article:
---
is involved in a war (including normal wars or FW)
---
does not share a corp/alliance (or FW side if the war in question is the FW war) with the assistor
---
is engaged in PVP (has a capsuleer logoff timer)
---
So in order for this to occur, all 3 of those things has to be true. Otherwise, no flag.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I regret to inform you that despite our best efforts we have been unable to accurately model the behavior of the one overly drunk dude.  
---
It's unfortunate that we can't include such a fundamental part of eve online fleets but the technology just isn't there yet.
---
Those bots are becoming more and more realistic every day
---
The $-value of isk is extremely elastic. 
---
\- Buyers usually decide to invest a fixed sum of $, which means, no matter how much isk you get from a single plex, the influx of new plex is absolutely stable.
---
\- A second kind of buyers, want to buy a specific thing ingame with RL money (i.e. a titan). In this case the sum in isk is fixed. This causes the influx of new plex DECREASE!
---
Just think about when you bought something the last time. What were you thinking when to decide how many plex you buy?
---
\- Limited offer, i.e. galaxy pack? -&gt; fixed $ sum invested -&gt; no relation to isk/plex prices
---
\- Specific thing ingame to buy? -&gt; higher isk/plex -&gt; less plex/$ needed
---
\- Regular or one time gift to yourself or for a friend with fixed amount? -&gt; no relation to isk/plex prices
---
\- Taken opportunity because you get more isk out of the $ investment? (here it is important: , the investment must be ADDITIONAL to what was planned) -&gt; Additional plex-shopping due to high isk prices  increases plex influx -&gt; decreases isk/plex
---
Oh well, no need to go out of my wormhole anymore !
---
It worked off and on for a bit. I switched to Eve panda and have been very pleased since. 
---
Title of his keynote: ‚ÄûHow to fuck tens of  thousands people simultaneously‚Äú
---
Goons are too stupid to tackle, do math, or fit ships, but we're capable of masterminding shared intricate plots on social media services. K
---
Right? People have been saying to do this change for a DECADE! Anyone have any juicy high sec war group years who relied on this?
---
So NC. has to post on Reddit when they hotdrop a t2 fit nid now?
---
My how the mighty have fallen.
---
RIP AUTZ I guess...
---
It's mostly the Chinese that cheat/bot/RMT while it's Europe, Americas, Australia that buy from them. You can see that in [PUBG](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/16/99-of-pubgs-banned-cheaters-are-from-china). If it isn't the Chinese, it's the Russians.
---
That is true, but let me ask you this: Do you think its all undeserved ?
---
Because personally, there are excellent reasons why I dropped BDO like a fucking rock into the ocean. And I am not the only one. Do you understand what those reasons are to cause people to go this far on such scale ?
---
Well to start, I appreciate your legitimate response and not some snarky bullshit, this is the very first time I've seen that.
---
It's really not a rampant bias towards certain players or player groups, more of a really bad attitude towards anyone that asks for the mods to step up and moderate this sub. Perfect example is Brisc Rubal's shit post about his sons little league baseball team a couple months ago. Like haha funny funny but seriously, that post had NOTHING to do with Eve. It's cool to act like a giant man child if you're just some spergling mouth breather that shit posts on Reddit but if you have a role in this community(CSM member or even subbreddit moderator) you acknowledge the duties and responsibilities that you are undertaking to make this sub, this game, and this community a better place for everyone. So now you have a CSM member who knows he is violating the rules and polluting the sub here by posting something completely unrelated to Eve just to spool people up. Then you have people calling for that post to be taken down and instead of taking it down they harass the folks asking for the mods to fulfill their duties. 
---
Does putting the word CSM at the end of your garbage post qualify as being relevant to EVE?
---
It's really a minor situation until we encourage this behavior and now these people think that is an acceptable way to represent this community and even worse, an acceptable way to interact with the very community you represent. 
---
I'm certain Brisc Rubal knows this sub Reddit's rules and I'm certain the moderators know the rules here. So why can't they just acknowledge that it's a violation of the posting rules here and do their job? Why do we have to vilify people for expecting the moderators to live up to the very duties they volunteered for? 
---
You can act like a giant man child if you like, but for the sake of the rest of us, step down from your responsibilities first because there are other people here that will take your role seriously.
---
Exhibiting culturally appropriated bad behavior is barely a plot or requires skill.
---
Stop being bad
---
Also, I have no idea how to mail the mods or file a formal report or anything. So all I know how to do this far is tag mods and ask for them to regulate. But it's more so the garbage posts that polute this sub, not the comments.
---
Is that what you modmailed about to warrant a ban?
---
The Abyss? 
---
low effort
---
I forgot there was a recent update about bots when creating the title.
---
It's a combination of few past years (excluding alpha clone release), and yes, I'm worried. Past months show decline compared to player activity in previous years.
---
WWB didn't happen every year so I'd not blame the "blue donut" entirely. It's one of the contributing factors.
---
Jonah?
---
Massive Singleplayer Online pls
---
Burner Missions?
---
Now BJ is done you should hellcamp him with battle ventures and ratting vni‚Äôs, if you ping &amp; pap I would come just for the salt )
---
why are you denying that timezones exist lol I don't understand this white knighting 
---
how late will these Koreans have to stay up to talk to an Englishman, huh? 
---
Shit, my intel channel is broken here!
---
this is good bait 
---
Is there an option to designate some units to start looting the field while the fight is ongoing?
---
EvE is a premium gaming experience that a lot of people seem to think should be free or low priced...wait, that‚Äôs exactly what it is.  At the annual subscription rate it works out to .35 cents per day, and yet people bitch while they‚Äôre sucking down Starbucks premium (lol) coffee or tapping away on their $800 phone.
---
Or seen a bridge Titan jump away xD
---
Allegedly. 
---
But what if the character is in a corp which is at war, but is not actually fighting a war target? What if the character is at war but is fighting a criminally flagged player?
---
This is a fair comment, the Abyss is indeed fun and admittedly something I forgot while posting. 
---
My main issue is that for example, with the April Update, smaller or lone players are at a huge disadvantage regarding wardecs, as it ties these war decks to structures, which changes hisec pvp to N+1 tactics, just like Null sec.
---
wait are you saying you needed help from goons to sperg?
---
01110111 01100101 00100000 01101100 01101111 01110110 01100101 01100100 00100000 01100111 01100101 01110110 01101100 01101111 01101110

That translates to: "we loved gevlon".

And/or a protection racket to not bash citadels.

You seem to enjoy being a victim...
---
They will reinforce the least active timezone... How is that bad? 
---
could say the same for goon damage control in every thread 
---
Damage control? It's a nid.
---
If you refer to abyssal PvP, it‚Äòs not an easily accessible and especially not affordable thing to do. There are some who are very successful at it, flying excellent fits and having fun. But it‚Äôs only few people in general constantly doing it and you have to throw lots of ISK at it to have a chance.
---
what
---
dude its a north korea joke, nothing to do with video games
---
Those are all good questions. Unfortunately all I know is what is in the post.
---
Abyssal PVP
---
[First rule in the sidebar link](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/wiki/rules)
---
Have a nice day.
---
Neutral logi = shit tier pvper for sure.
---
Yes, before exporting the fit from pyfa set the character skills to "All 0".  
---
This should be accurate provided the fit only uses salvage drones and logi fits no less than two guns.
---
The structure will need a service or it will be in low power mode and can be killed much faster and easier.
---
I like war Dec service though. 
---
Sooo, some things you should be doing:
---
\- Don't take a JF into Jita.  I am sure there are reasons to do so but I can't think of any.  If you can safely get a JF from lowsec to highsec there is no reason for it to travel another AU.
---
\- Train a second character on your cyno alt account, sit him in HS for use as a scout.  Use him religiously (As in EVERY time you undock a freighter).
---
\- Since you are transferring everything to a normal freighter (with 3x the space) you should not need to do this however **split your cargo!**  I can only think of 3 cases were expanded cargoholds are acceptable and only one use in HS (Titan/Jump bridge a normal freighter to a cyno on a station in NS,  JF in lowsec cuz if you get caught EHP is not going to help you and a regular freighter in HS when you are transporting high volume, low cost items like repacked T1 ships).
---
\-On the topic of splitting items for the love of Pete take out EVERYTHING that is .1m3 like BPOs and expensive Faction/DS modules.  There is no reason to put those in a freighter, none.
---
\-ISK tank your ship.  Regular frieghters with reinforced bulkheads start to become gank worthy around 1-2 billion ISK.  If at all possible transport less than that at a time.  1 billion ISK + in cargo is also the threshold where you remove ALL expanded cargohold modules.
---
\-Read Gank-Intel channel before an during your travels, especially when going to/from a trade hub.  Anti-ganking may not be very effectual at saving freighters once they are caught but extra intel and eyes does help.
---
\-JF in highsec should ALWAYS have an exit cyno.  Do not skip on this, you are flying a 12 billion ISK ship and gankers like to pop them for LOLs.
---
\-If you can field a 3rd pilot a webbing alt is helpful.  Saves time on travel but it is not something you can do AFK.
---
If I can think of anything else I will be sure to add it.  Good luck.  I am a reputable scout if needed (I have VC).
---
That's a lot of slopes.
---
Oh yeah, absolutely.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll take another double soy latte with whipped cream, no gluten!‚Äù Congratulations, you just blew a month‚Äôs worth of EVE.
---
&gt; [People like this](https://youtu.be/VbYNLmtAMAw), who also dox others ... yeah ...
---
&gt; Goons leadership are scum. They attack the players instead of keeping it in the game and fighting the characters.
---
&gt; Zero honour.
---
&gt; Mittens only changed Goon's goal from trying to destroy the game and force CCP to shut it down when his income became linked to the game.
---
Goons does not change. Maybe some of the members will.
---
exactly 
---
I've tried to explain this stuff to you, but you can't handle any kind of constructive criticism.  You just revert back to the name calling and generalizations that I have called you on over and over again in the past.  You never seem to learn. 
---
Doesn't it get old?  I mean, you were on a pretty good streak on reddit before this bullshit. 
---
&gt; Now that we have established what's going on...
---
It is very clear that you have no idea what's going on.
---
If you could kindly dumb down the language for us simple folk, that would be great.
---
I always find these kind of conspiracy theorists amusing.
---
"Mod bias, anything anti-goon gets shut down!"
---
*makes anti-goon, anti-mod post*
---
Mod: Leaves it up.
---
She was really a good sport.
---
o7 everyone reacting to a gank that way.
---
I never got into the PvP world so I haven't lost a huge number of ships (probably 3 dozen in the last two years).
---
I started out market trading and didn't lose ships until I started exploration and mission running about a year in. Thankfully, with my (novice at best) market skills, I'm able to keep a steady flow of passive ISK.
---
I think everyone should try market trading, Eves economy is, IMO one of the most interesting things about it.
---
Someone should invite him into goons so he can REEEEE even harder.
---
Well crap, I'm out of popcorn.
---
‚ÄúThe increased penalty for neutral targeted assistance will also apply to limited engagements (such as those caused by duels)"
---
I‚Äôm essentially paraphrasing this section: whether you have a limited engagement with the target or not, the increased penalty (criminal flagging) applies.
---
Hey Olmeca, I am triggered by your forthright and unrelenting buffoonery. If I am re-elected to the CSM I will do everything in my power assure that EvE Online's NPE has a module designed to prevent anybody else from ever making the same mistakes you have. New Players are the life blood of this game and we simply cannot afford to have any of of them follow in your footsteps. Vote Xenuria for CSM.
---
A harsh point of view. Not entirely unjustified, a harsh point nonetheless.
---
/I‚Äôve met quite a few of the devs, there‚Äôs quite a bit of very fine people there.
---
Given CCP's record, probably Concordokken.
---
I would tell more, but it is the terrible secret of space.
---
pak
---
You might recall the infamous "Falcon bullied me" bullshit with Gevlon started off with Falcon offering to buy him a drink if he ever showed up at a meet.  
---
Make the base fuel cost (one war) not too prohibitive.
---
**Make the fuel cost double for each subsequent war.**
---
I just love you &lt;3
---
AHAHHA holyshit I almost peed myself laughing at this. 
---
That‚Äôs certainly a way of doing it. Your argument is basically why PLEX exists.
---
They have a ~20% drop chance. You can run 3 sites per hour.  Together with the other loot you're looking at 800m-1b per hour. 
---
Oh yes, let's harass someone because his ticker is "Goons", you should really look what human being you are right now, because trust me, this is sad
---
I am still on a streak. You don't know how many thank messages and mails I get, or how many people upvoted this post because they approved the message. Meanwhile, I have no problem with being controversial. I don't mind talking about cultural problems inherent to the largest alliance, and then inevitably getting shat by them, as most of these people live inside their own bubble. Reading some of the comments about me in the Imperium discord gives me a sad cringe given the amount of circlejerk.
---
If I can't voice what I believe to be true without getting shat on by people whom I criticize, then so be it. Someone should talk about predatory modding and isolationist toxic metagame. Most of the influential people are either chasing their ingame interests, or RMT interests, or an ego boost from empty popularity. 
---
Thanks Peanutbutterjam_derp is appreciated mate

Everyone knows the worst botters are Chinese gold Farms and spoiled American Suburban kids. Koreans often play PC games at internet cafes, not exactly the best place to set up some kind of botting Network when you don't even own the computer.

The fact that someone from PIRAT is crying proves that this was a good move on CCP's part.

That suits you and your kind of people. Running for CSM for the memes is your kind of thing. If I ever ran for it, I'd just do my best to actually improve the game. And I'd make sure I am actually one of the candidates who can.

sounds like fun

It took dreads to kill a T2 fit ascee carrier who didn't hop on comms and died quietly. Oh wow so elite? Olmeca get banned so you had to shit post for him?

gevlon logged in wayyyy to much to be a mittens alt, we kicked one of his alt corps last week that he forgot to register on services. The alt corp had a keepstar anchored in delve.

Yes because thinking for a decade to fix something retardedly broken that was fixed in a month is hard work
---
tbh, garbage like you spinning your own narrative to make yourself looks great and just causing drama all the time do not belong in /r/eve, this an eve online related reddit, not an "how great Olmeca is" if you want people to appreciate you stop acting like a cunt, the fact you are targeting all the time the alliance people hate is not enough to hide the fact you are a moron, I saw many people telling you "I'm an anti-goons and I hate you"  because no one who check your narrative will ever follow you, you are literally the kind of person harassing personally an eve player and saying 1 week later "duh mod are harassing me" guess what they do their job

There's part of me that thinks this is going to be awesome way to quickly theorycraft fleet designs and see how they function.

There's also a part of me that fears this will be the go/no go control for risky fleet fights: "Simulations say no, so we're docking up to deny them kills."

I sold about 200bn when I quit last year. Got about 1.5k for it from one guy. The game is crawling with RMT and always will be. 
---
Coulda got triple if he just bought it off the chinese.
---
But CCP doesn't want any to kill bottom as it hurts player numbers.. you'd lose half of the Chinese player base that is currently propping up player counts
---
Well I mean it is /r/eve
---
Olmeca just posted in this thread though. :thinking:
---
My subjective opinion in somewhat order of importance:
---
1. First and foremost, join a friendly player-driven corporation/alliance that acknowledges that you're new. While you stay in an NPC corp, you're essentially playing single-player... and EVE is awful for playing alone (with some exceptions, like single-player PvP which probably isn't relevant to you yet). Do your research on the corp you'd be joining (don't join a predatory one that'd just milk you for cash and effort); based on my intuition, I'd suggest BRAVE. Be on comms, get to know people, be on their communications channels (Discord, Slack, etc). Move on if you feel like it.
---
2. Think of what you'd like to do in a game like EVE, and pick a focus or two, and change it if it feels boring. It's a sandbox MMO, one of the first, and has its own unique traits, but many career paths mirror those of other games. I still think this image is pretty exhaustive on the multitude of things that you can do in EVE (although some are behind a time-wall for training or monetary investment not yet available to you): [https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post\_img/eve-career-chart.jpg](https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg)
---
3. Plan ahead your skill training based on your to-be career path (I presume you won't be buying tons of injectors, which would cost you real-life cash at this point). In EVE, your character's skills develop no matter if you're logged in or not. Some career paths can take up to months in real-life time without boosting before they become even remotely relevant. Some are accessible within the matter of hours and days. You didn't mention for long your Omega is going to last, but there's much of content that is Omega-exclusive, but still behind a time-wall. There is not only a steep learning curve, but there is also a game mechanics based time curve.
---
4. Establish a steady, enjoyable and/or improvable source of income (ISK, or something that can be transformed easily into ISK). You will be losing ships, or needing money for moving to the next tier of ships, modules, implants, skills etc. You need a secure way for a steady income, and there are many ways to do this - might as well enjoy it while you're at it. Never unnecessarily risk this source of income; i.e. ignorantly fly your first expensive ship to lower security space, where people will kill you - they may do so also in higher security space, but it's less likely.
---
5. I know you said it, but still read guides, watch tutorial videos, ask advice from your newly found friends. There's absolutely no shame in researching the mechanics. EVE is a mechanics orientated game - while I previously mentioned skill training, your character's skill points will always be second in priority to your personal knowledge of game mechanics in pretty much everything you do. Guides, forum posts and videos will help you optimize your ISK/hour if you're engaged in PvE, industry, market trading etc, your chances of succeeding in PvP, etc. Always learn from your mistakes, but also learn when you do succeed; much of EVE is based on trial-and-error. Watching EVE streams on [https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/EVE%20Online](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/EVE%20Online) may serve you better, as you can pick a stream with a title that is interesting to your, and most EVE streamers are nice enough to interact with people asking them questions in the chat.
---
6. Use publicly available EVE tools and resources; software-wise this means mainly pyfa ([https://github.com/pyfa-org/pyfa/releases](https://github.com/pyfa-org/pyfa/releases)), which is an EVE spaceship fitting tool. You'll import your character's skills, and it'll be very helpful for you to plan ahead which skills to train for ship fits that you want to and tell you your ship's defensive and offensive capabilities etc. I'm not sure if EVEMon is still a good tool for skill planning, but at least little googling suggests it might still be a good software (it used to be). Also, there's public fleets for PvP like Spectre Fleet, and you can find them at [https://spectrefleet.com/](https://spectrefleet.com/)  (not sure what's up with Bombers' Bar). There are many good websites; zKillboard (PvP statistics; [https://zkillboard.com/](https://zkillboard.com/)), dotlan (navigation, politics, etc; [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/)), EveWho (people, corporations and their stats; [https://evewho.com/](https://evewho.com/)). If you find a particular thing you like to do in EVE, chances are somebody's already done a lot of work in optimizing that career path and has shared a guide or a Google Sheet with numbers that will help you do what you like to do even more efficiently. Do not expect the in-game tutorial, achievement systems, agency and whatever to hold your hand and guide you very efficiently - essentially everything that's currently built in the in-game client is not going to be super helpful in learning to play or even finding the fun content. After learning the basics, there are some supporting in-game things like player-created overview settings and shareable ship fittings for the in-game fitting simulator.
---
7. Measure your time in EVE by ISK/hour if you're in for the money and PvE on your way to becoming a space-rich mogul, or fun/hour otherwise in e.g. PvP. EVE is not a game for everybody, but there's plenty of career paths to go around to, and most quit because they just didn't find their place. This is where multiplayer social interactions play a large part, hence pt. 1. People say that rule 1 in EVE would be to "never trust anybody" - well, to a degree it may be true, but the big heists and such you might've heard about don't really apply until you've progressed far into the game. Otherwise people are people; some are rude by nature, some mostly want you to do their work for them, some are genuinely good people who are potential friends even. To tilt the odds in your favor, common courtesy will get you far: Be kind to others (even if they've just killed you), be respectful on comms (e.g. don't talk if your fleet leader is maintaining an active operation), and do your research before asking an "obvious" question (chances are your first google hit would've been an EVE Uni Wiki hit with a comprehensive answer to your question; others may ignore you not because of malice, but because you've been too lazy and it'd take them an essay to lay it down to you).
---
Feel free to send me a private message and I could add you on Discord. I doubt I'd make a good mentor though, as I don't have the courtesy for spending lavish hours in EVE any more, but who knows. Best of luck, young capsuleer :)

if you watch the video you can hear her call out what is on grid while she was on comms.

Goodluck, i cant be asked to log into 500man cap brawls so enjoy

His claims are tenuous at best, I wouldn't be too concerned.

true. we put about as much effort in our posting as ccp does its game balance/ design

The main problem is that it is cheaper to buy the ISK from some botter and buy the PLEX.

I don't think defenders are supposed to walz through and swipe the HQ away in an hour.     
---
he would make a professional rich with all the help that guy need tbh
---
&gt;Care to provide proof on unfunny garbage?
---
literally everything you post is unfunny garbage
---
Here is my solution for asset safety btw.
---
Introduce a deployable structure that has no timers but a 30 minute damage cap. It locks down the asset safety services of the citadel whose grid it is deployed. If the attacker side manages to defend it 24/7, then the 15% asset safety tax goes to them instead of NPCs.
---
This would be much like wormhole mechanics, where you'd need to arrange 24/7 hole control (in this case citadel grid) to score good loot. And the defender could try to breach it.
---

"humans" harass each other every day. the modern society is built on harassment, no matter if you can or can't prove that someone did anything to you just blaming gives you power these days and so called "rapists" get fired from jobs only to eventually be exonerated, but at that point the damage is done and noone really gives a fuck about the actual truth at that point... so i'd say i'm pretty average...

Aww..

TCU's are worthless.

The only thing they give is your name on dotlan and a POS fuel reduction. This isn't really a dig at you for reffing it, good job. It would be nice if the TCU actually meant something though.
---
I enjoy reading these well thought out suggestions on how to make Eve better. And then I realize CCP doesn‚Äôt give a shit what ppl want and are just chasing that dollar. Which is what the majority of game devs are doing nowadays. Congrats CCP you are status quo when that used to not be the case. 
---
also full of ppl that need to respond to everything

he's like siigari, even if you're an nc fc with 20 pl alts you join in with the universal hatred
---
What goons fail to realize is that their entire alliance is being used by their leadership to generate numbers on imperium blogs/advertising platforms as well as leadership twitch channels. Essentially RMT, but in a diluted fashion such as to avoid suspicion.

---
This is like accusing a company for promoting a "for profit" culture. The company lives in a system and has to survive. You can't blame the company for that. 
---
Everything you said is true, but I think the problem is that a large percentage of the gaming Market has moved away from the concept of Premium gaming experiences. The default gaming experience is single purchase, free to play, or seasonal in some manner.
---
CCP has obviously tried to adapt to this to some degree, but there is only so much EVE Online can change. Honestly this is where Dust had the chance to shine, but we saw how that went. 
---
Yes, let's showcase a new game acquisition that recently axed it's annual competitive tournament in a country renowned for it's competitive game tournaments... 
---
PA is just as dense as CCP...
---
So here's the question that's popped up from my alliance:
---
We (small alliance) are currently heavily allied with another (small) alliance. They operate significantly differently than we do, have their own command structure, and we're both in agreement that we're generally happier being separate organizations.
---
But we sometimes collectively decide that someone or something in highsec really has to die. At current, if we both wardec the same target we can pool our numbers into one fleet and accept a suspect timer in highsec - praying no neutrals come to bother us. After these upcoming changes, we will be unable to support each other in any meaningful way.
---
Given that there is no real 'unfair advantage' being gained in this arrangement - anything we fight can already shoot both our groups - is there any chance of an exception being opened to allow our two groups to continue to work alongside each other?
---
Because it doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot else going for it besides some utility high slots and some speed? 
---
That second part certainly has occurred to me.  
---
My hope is that it helps people find a way they could take the fight, even if they can't always reship to it on the day.  
---
I also think it's important people consider the graph at the end.  
---
Often fleets that lose badly by the end can take decent trades as long as they don't get trapped and get out at the right time.  
---
I figure if neither of those things are true it's often the type of fight not many FCs would take anyway.
---
I didn't run as a Meme, I was elected as one. I ran as the only reform candidate in the history of the CSM at that time. I re-wrote the white paper and worked with my peers to change the way the CSM functioned as an institution. I attended fewer sessions than other candidates but spent hours one on one with developers and producers to spin up solutions that you may only now start to observe. 
---
Some Edgy people voted me onto the CSM as a joke, I had the last laugh.

Make the warfuel expensive in quantity or quality, have it drop on destruction of HQ
---
&gt; including the subtle use of reddit modding to do so.
---
He's been full gelvon ever since he teamed up with marshy the only other person to ever go full gelvon
---
As long as it has the chance of dropping a metric shit-ton of fuel or something as loot when it's exploded if it belongs to one of the wardec-500-alliances-at-once groups.
---
&gt;Solution #1
---
Legacy structures will remain unchanged and unmoved. High sec, low sec, NPC null and WH space will remain unchanged. This is with the intention to allow smaller groups to realistically build and have their own structures while providing reasonable invasion staging points. Legacy structures will remain in place for technicality reasons and WH space will remain the same for overwhelming logistical restrictions that already exist.
---
In Sov Null all new structures will be limited to an anchor position on a moon, planet and or sun with a limit of one structure per celestial. This change will serve multiple purposes. Not only will invasions / defences become more focused in narrative but also serve to allow weeklong timers and damage caps to feel more balanced.
---
The problem with this is the second it's announced you will see a mass anchor in home regions of null sec and WHs to make it as cancerous as possible to invade.
---
&gt;Solution#1
---
Introduce a new passive moon mining module for refineries. The intention of this module will be to compromise the old system with the new. Actively mining your moon ore should still be the only way to full harvest the available moon ore. I think a healthy amount for the passive miner would be around 10-20% (depending on athanor or tatara) of the available moon ore in a complete chunk. Miners will still be required to mine moons to full extent and alliances will have clear incentives to compete for moons. It will also open up space for more PVP oriented groups creating a more dynamic universe in EVE.
---
I've seen this be brought up time and time again by smaller alliances or people who simply thing mining is beneath them. People in ships in space doing things is what is good for the game and probably what CCP want. NuMoons are a huge benefit to individual players who can mine R64s their alliance allows them to so they can increase their own personal wealth rather than funnelling 20b/moon into the alliance wallet. Alliance should be making their money with buyback programs for moon goos, market taxes on moon goo sold through the citadel markets, taxes on T2 production etc. I could really go on but I don't want to write a post about how to run your own economy.
---
&gt;Solution #2
---
Introduce a new ‚Äúlock box‚Äù hanger in every citadel. I think a fair and reasonable size would be around 50k - 100k M3. All items in the lock box will have a 100% chance to be asset safetied in the case of a citadel loss. All non lock boxed items will have a 50% chance to drop or enter asset safety. This will give control to players knowing they will be gone to lock their more valuable assets up. The chance for loot will increase incentive for groups to actively destroy important citadels while maintaining a chance for defenders to recover on average more than half or all of their assets. This will give more meaning to alliance conflicts and impose fair and justifiable consequences for all.
---
Asset safety is dumb. Half the fun of killing a hostile region was knowing their stuff was stuck in there for a while. Most people chose to firesale assets they had trapped. Now its "OH BETTER ASSET SAFETY MY TITANS"
---
Simply remove interdiction nullification on interceptors. This will be my only non compromised solution. The negative impact this change has had on eve is unmistakable and only serves to unequivocally prevent player interactions or conflict. These ships have single handedly wiped out a massive source of fun in this game. They are severely unbalanced for their cost effectiveness and make travel in eve supremely trivial.
---
Remove all nullification and add it to shuttles and T3 cruisers (however it would make them virtually combat ineffective)
---
Nullification + Sub 2s align interceptors killed gate camping pretty much.
---
So you mean in modern society there is people who call out people randomly for thing they never done, without evidence I guess and those people suffer from it ? Wait... 
---
&gt;For full disclosure, some Goons/alliance mates then doxxed abused the guy afterwards. Nastiness all round
---
&gt; goons are cunts that deserve everything coming their way and then some...
---
So much fact here, so much evidence, you can clearly see those both guy know the truth, you can 200% believe them
---
marshy did that in his little discord rant about goons making CCP sic the diamond rats on him, ever since starting to hang with marshy olmeca has been more and more like gelvon, it was only a matter of time.
---
am i being memed here
---
i guess if your theory is "well i'll die eventually so limit the cost of hull loss" maybe the "use a regular freighter" advice is good?
---
JFs have so, so much more tank than a standard freighter they can often survive just based on "we don't have enough dudes to gank this", plus they have an out if they get bumped which regular freighters don't. if the gankers are horrible JFs align faster too but lol
---
your best bet for getting into jita is a slaved a-typed ark with several exit cynos tbh. combine that with a webber, only moving at quiet times, and dscanning on the in gate for a gank fleet for extra credit
---
Sounds great. I'm glad we didn't interfere with this.
---
It's not unhelpful, it's no more a QOL tool it's something that becomes a game mechanic, that's what I was trying to say. ( and clearly failing ).
---
INN is fake news
---
Frankly... who cares? 
---
High sec is supposed to be the really safe areas of space that have little in the way of economic opportunities. Nulsec is supposed to be dangerous, but much more profitable, and also with the ability to field caps and what not. 
---
While it is true that you can‚Äôt bubble/siege high sec citadels (a mechanic that also needs to be looked at, high sec shouldn‚Äôt be allowed Keepstars for example, and should be limited to a certain amount of citadels per Corp per system), it‚Äôs fine that high sec is safe. That‚Äôs the point of its existence. 
---
CCP just needs to work harder at making it less worth being there or more worth being in low/null (and please in a way that isn‚Äôt just buffing rorquals online)
---
This idea is one of those that sound super great on paper, and if ever implemented would be a disaster of unintended consequences for the game.
---
The whole "more interesting/challenging PVE" idea has been around forever, yet every time CCP has tried to do it, the end result is the same; The new stuff if little used and the old stuff continues to be run. People (in every game, not just EVE) think they want "engaging PVE" when in reality they (we) want PVE that generates wealth that we can then use to do the things we actually want to do.
---
 There is a reason there are WAY more people running anoms and missions than abyss sites, and that reason isn't botting for most of us.
---
This idea would force the abyss crap down everyone throat. All because of Super Carriers making to much isk and VNIs being to easy to use.  It's making up a complicated solution to an easy problem. Which is stupid. It's trying to fix super and VNI ratting by destroying anomaly ratting for those of us who won't use VNIs and supers (I rat with a Machariel, sometimes smartbomb fit, sometimes pvp fit as bait).
---
The real fix is a simple one. Make anomalies spawn random ewar/capwar towers (an ecm tower to jam fight, a web tower would slow down a vni and get it kills, neut towers would do VNIs in the same way NPC dreads do).  For super caps, let the game detect when a super capital is in an anomaly and give that anomaly a chance to spawn a 'super cap killer' npc that has no bounty.  Most supers would jsut warp off, but that disrupts the flow of isk making a bit thus lowering the isk influx (which is mainly from carriers and super caps anyway).
---
Do you read the devblogs? Also, what gives you the right to say what games other people should be able to play. Are you trolling?
---
True
---
" What goons fail to realize is that their entire alliance is being used by their leadership to generate numbers on imperium blogs/advertising platforms as well as leadership twitch channels. " Goon here, totally realized this months ago, don't care,  I play the game because its fun not because I want to pay someone's rent, but if they can make a buck off me playing then good for them coming up with a way to do so. If making money on website and twitch ads was RMT, every twitch streamer there is for eve would be banned by now, stop claiming RMT just because you don't like goons its a bad look.
---
Answering the age-old question : How many slashers does it take to pop a HAW dread?
---
This sounds like a good set of changes. It's a bit weird that lowsec or nullsec groups will need to put up a highsec structure if they want to declare war, but since war only really matters in highsec anyway, there's a logic in that too.
---
the sad part is this might not actually be bait, Olmeca might have finally stepped off the cliff and gone full retard.
---
you sound like a deadset cunt aye  
---
have a bit of fun in the game and a bit less salt intake
---
I didn't ban you for it for a reason. I just removed the comment because if the claims are true and people are harassing that guy in an RL capacity then I can't leave that up. Though if you edit out the link, I have no issues re-approving it. 
---
&gt; quit right before AT announcement because I didn't like how the game was going
---
and immediately after, ccp announce that they're killing off rorqual online's only pvp event
---
b-but these are honourable gentlemen who would never use a vpn!!
---
Except I'm not Olmeca.
---
"EFS makes it easy to simulate PvP by using dynamic AI that mimics real player behavior alongside a wide range of weapons and effect implementations. "
---
Does it account for the people who jump through gates when they are red?
---
"if you lost TCU, you lost asset safety in the system"
---
&gt; Are bot accounts a problem now?
---
when people say eve isn't dying because 40k people still play, they're forgetting that even an optimist would say a few thousand of those are bots
---
now that would be pretty neat. i was just hoping for a citadel fuel reduction bonus (like the POS bonus) but i kinda like that. it would make people more willing to fight for TCUs for sure.

IIRC, 1 ISK is the standard annual pay for a capsuleer's crew member, and it is enough to support his or her family, yes.
---
Do you know who I am, fuck you.
---
hence why i'm average... not asking for a title of some honorable 1st rate citizen here... however with the things goons did in the past that post is not that far from the possible truth. no evidence? well that's, my friend, is the entire point, isn't it? harass someone with no trace and you are god, completely untouchable, goons had the time to grow over the years and hone those skills, so here are the results, they can harass anyone they want while you need to bring proof, that would require so much work you to acquire that it defeats the entire point...
---
My unsolicited advice:
---
Take a break from this subreddit. 
---
I know you have a lot of passion about Goons, but you aren't helping your cause here.
---
For people with no dog in this fight/drama, you are coming across in a way I don't think you intend.
---
Go have some fun without worrying about what a bunch of Reddit posters do or think.
---
And yet instead of waiting for a mod to get back to you, you decided to make a thread. Talk about being self absorbed 
---
It was a shit meme, utterly low effort. 
---
" and a certain mental toll with it"  
---
Yeah that i believe but i got a feeling you're confusing cause and effect here. This stuff really sounds like you should see a psychiatrist just to make shure you're not actually suffering from schizophrenia. And maybe take a break from social media if it stresses you out that much...

My favourite was how he made a post wondering why no body respected him, even though he had suicide ganked many more miners than the average PL guy (Back when PL was still in top shape) and thus should be considered a PvP god.
