I would insert a snarky comment here, but who the fuck cares. 
---
---
---
That was fun. And to think less than 3 months before my corp owned that system. I still remember the rendering bug if you warped to any of the asteroid belts past the 5th planet you would get framerate crash that would only get worse until your computer melted...
---
no balls not biomassing your main
---

---
I was thinking the same thing. Haha. 
---
I'd rather deal with subcap blobs than capital blobs. Game is better balanced around subcaps. Also, a subcap blob can be countered by a smaller force. Such as bombers/bombs, booshers, EWAR etc.
---
I'm free to ask for whatever I want, remember, its a forum, it can be asked and debated. You're an idiot though if you think this about nano gangs. Just a typical spodbrain response that is too short sighted to see how bad it is for 8 ships to hold hundreds of subcaps in a strangle hold in the meta.
---
&gt;As for Battleship, I agree that Navy price against Pirate are bad, seeing the navy are way less effective than their pirate counterpart.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;But nerfing the droprate is retarded at most, rebalancing navy ships is a fine idea, and I think you don't understand how farmable Mordu's ships are. Nobody cares as they aren't fit for line member usage, else the prices would be the same as the current NS faction BS.
---
I've farmed mordus before. They're harder to farm and riskier than running DED's in a Widow/BLOPs. You're not in a site that needs to be scanned down to find, you're out in a belt, in space. Meaning you're exposing yourself to be a lot more danger/risk.  Mordus are just a single pirate faction, and as you said, aren't hunted by nullbears/fleets. But if machariels were the same, there's going to a WHOLE lot more people out in belts trying to meet machariel demands, or Nightmare demands, etc. Which means a lot more people will be in belts/space and not hiding behind a site that needs to be probed down, where as soon as combats show up, you cloak or warp off.
---
lmao yes they did 
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pin6hy/black-friday-sale
---
Has nothing to do with their budget being limited, it has everything to do with ccp wanting to meet some arbitrary financial goal PA set for the earnout agreement. 
---
I think the unexpected error is you tried to buy Plex after the pr nightmare. The server couldn't believe it and crashed out. 
---
Ah.. my bad then
---
It's out of CCP's control with the EU crackdown on online gambling, they wanted to play safe rather than risk anything. You can still gamble in private.
---
Because the player base is smaller then it was 10 years ago, so not only has the intake increased but the amount of takers has decreased. 
---
Now the reason it becomes an issue now is that all other limiters to how much you can grind have been removed. 
---
10 years ago you had to spend over a year focus training to generate a titan alt, now you can get a titan alt in a couple of months if your willing to no life it. ( or spent the cash on farming the SP in a month ). 
---
This means the barrier to mass farming of resources has been reduced this means that problem like you can mass farm this resource become way more visible in the game. 
---
So this might have been an issue 10 years ago but the number of people both aware of it and able to exploit it where limited meaning the issue didn't become as visible to the rest of the player base. 
---
Now everyone can so the issue is very much visible and it means to most of the player base the game feels in a bad state, it's like if you have criminal in town your mostly fine because the majority of people don't deal with him whereas if everyone in town is a criminal living there becomes hell.  
---
We've gone from every other thread being about bots, to every other thread being a doctoral thesis about why Eve is dead, CCP is bad, I quit, blah blah blah. Not sure which is worse.
---
&gt; Alternatives to the Alliance Tournament
---
Undock and play Eve.
---
Elise mentioned in a comment on his CCP Morale Post (F) that EVE NT will probably do something along those lines, so I hope it becomes a reality in the nearish future.
---
Uninstall already.........why do people continue to invest in something they apparently sold out on already

Combing them was the only good UI decision CCP has made in a decade.
---
Does it matter? He still hasn't got Navigation 5 trained. It's as worthless as a new character. 
---
CCP going down in flames bub 
---
You should probably stop posting then.
---
&gt;play Eve
---
complete garbage in comparison. 
---
today I learned moon changes for one are 10 years old.
---
I swear someone makes this post every PLEX sale
---
The game changed and I didn't adapt.
---
Skinnerbox? Strange coincidence to see this pop up while listening to Mike Skinner from the Streets....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As a 14 year vet I agree with most of your points.... IMHO The game has been won by the farmers who want 'balance' (actually homogenisation) and lobby for mechanics (a pathetic CSM filter on ideas) to help protect and propagate their wealth, without any real goal other than to add more titans etc to the bloat that is large scale PVP today.
---
My greatest respect was for groups like Burn Eden, BoB, GHSC, the old CVA/Provi-Bloc etc who actually built a reputation on their own values and unique achievements in game rather than all simply buddying up to blob out the competition and become stagnant, bloated, professionals of playing the game like its a day in the office. The cancer that is Supers jumping on anything and everything bigger than a BC gang is the death of Eve.
---
I don't see much hope to be honest until the players themselves desire for change to a less risk averse direction, which feels like praying for climate change to suddenly reverse.
---
I pray every night that the L*RD will deliver me from npbee whitenoise posting but it appears he has not yet deigned to do so. 
---
I hate it when people don't play the way I want them to
---
I thought everything was my fault?
---
Is there a way to see how many people unsubbed due to the AT announcement?
---
:mind blown:
---
And it has the police SKIN on it!
---
Ignore these idiot responses, CCP regularly bans botters and shit, and all you have to do is look at a few MER's to see the Active ISK Deltas.
---
This is dope. Nice video, thanks for sharing.
---
Funny part is, this use case for the falcon still works to some extent.  Its a little harder to  use to secure the kill (though if you keep it out of range the tackled ship likely can't hit it), it is still almost guaranteed to let your main ship get out.  
---
Uncloak, jam, warp off main ship, warp off falcon.  Still nearly guaranteed escape from a small fight going south.
---
I didnt get to play eve when this was a thing, I wish I had, that launcher looks so crisp ans unbloated, i love the squareness of everything like how locked targets and their HP bars looked. I love the font, i love all of it. 
---
this is exactly the problem with groups that choose to win at all costs because even if it's hurting the game the will pick that method because of the advantage it provides. 
---
That’s the only way to truly stop yourself from coming back. Lol
---
You are getting the ALLIANCE RORQUAL MINING TOURNAMENT and liking it.

Lol this is great. Thanks op
---
Moons still vend moongoo now. In terms of wealth generation, little has changed, other than who gets the wealth.
---
Chances are that it's just a bug, knowing CCP
---
Maybe that game is eve?
---
Only CCP would change war mechanics because it was "effecting the player count" to then cancel fanfest and AT to seriously effect their player count.
---
Great logic.
---
I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds like you don't know either. OK.
---
IN THIS CORNER WE HAVE SPODLOVER69 HAILING FROM DELVE WTH 53 RORQUALS AND IN THIS CORNER WE HAVE AFK4LYFE HAILING FROM BRAVENEWBIES WITH 1 RORQUAL 3, 2 ,1 MINE
---
Thanks for taking the time to explain everything. The answer actually makes a lot of sense
---
Wow you are delusional.
---
Station games happened in like 1/5000 of eve systems that are not high/lowsec, and those fucking places still have the same stations.  Those same systems could also have PoS in 99% of likelyhood.  
---
We have identified one source of your missing content, station games are gone.  
---
Second, war consequences.  This is just some more blah blah rorqual bullshit.  When r64's were all over the place, what actual fallout from a war was there?  You traded regions, like Goons in Delve, Goons in the North, Goons in Delve Mk34542.  You are so buttblasted about rorquals you don't even have a fucking clue as to the cause of Titan proliferation.  (HINT:  It is not mineral prices or mineral volume)
---
"I Lack Content" "I wont respond to you saying that though"...  Are you fucking High?  No Offense buffs?  Fuck right off sonny boi.  Polarized Torps, T3D, CDs, MJD, 6s Combat Probes, WH teleports, T3C, T3BC, like what the fuck.  These are all super powered hunter tools.  Toss in nullified hunters, cloaky prospect hunters, time-limited bubbles, faster AU's warp speeds, like wow you have some cognitive dissonance there bud.
---
I bet you $100 you never even fucking used the old probe system.
---
"there are no solutions", then fuck off and stop posting.  You sound like some shitbad like IronBank at this point.
---
Yeh there's alot more to Eve than that I VNI rat I mine I do sov war and that's all just in my first 6 months there's alot wrong with Eve ATM 
---
The pr campaign on reddit is realer than EvE.
---
This sounds like a complaint about skill injectors, not ihub anomaly spawn mechanics.

I've missed your postings, tbh. You're my third favorite eve nerd.

Who's this nerd? Cuz goddamn, get some fuckin benzos in your system before you die of your heart ripping free from your ribcage.

---
&gt;Station games happened in like 1/5000 of eve systems that are not high/lowsec
---
We call them staging systems. 
---
&gt;When r64's were all over the place, what actual fallout from a war was there?
---
Often eviction. TEST was entirely evicted from Delve. AAA was evicted from sov entirely. The Northern Coalition was completely scattered and most alliances died. Stainwagon was evicted from the game post Halloween war. 
---
&gt; You are so buttblasted about rorquals you don't even have a fucking clue as to the cause of Titan proliferation. (HINT: It is not mineral prices or mineral volume)
---
Sotiyos enabling infinite builds is a contributing factor but, by and large, ~60b titans cause proliferation more than 100b~ titans. Pretending otherwise is asinine. 
---
&gt;Polarized Torps, T3D, CDs, MJD, 6s Combat Probes, WH teleports, T3C, T3BC, like what the fuck
---
I hope you're joking. These things were in the game and functioning long, long, before Upwell or PANIC were dreamed up. That's a non-comparison entirely.  
---
&gt;"there are no solutions", then fuck off and stop posting
---
Nah, I'll keep encouraging people who feel the same as me to quit the game. 
---
Uninstall Eve . Is a fine alternative
---
&gt; Name me 1 big war that was not involving some form of BoB and/or Goons
---
everything regarding the drone regions? the lowsec grudges between SC and snuffed out? the countless week long non-stop FW sieges before the wz died? 
---
for someone who likes to tell others they should be "post 2012" you sure do stink like some newbro educated solely on a couple andrew groen talks.
---
So in 3 minutes, you have to go from 0 information on the candidates to vote for them that's honestly gonna lead to mostly random votes. 
---
Like for people that don't get send a list you sorta have this thing called research time in the process where you have to look at the people running etc, this makes the time commitment already not synchronized between null blocs and the rest of eve, now couple this with non-bloc players often not being pushed by there environment to vote ( your gonna listen more to what your friend thinks then what a notification says ). 
---
Now that alone would be bad enough but this shit also snowballs because if your space doesn't get the votes it's more likely to end up in a state with fewer players come next election. 
---
Do we really need an NDA for a video game council? Really?
---
Hookbills all over New Eden shed their camo skins in protest over the cancellation of this year's AT
---
That's a question of priorities, like CCP doesn't value the AT over other things ( like flying dev's around to be visible ), the issue is I'm not so sold this reasoning is gonna change all that much next year. 
---
Because if you don't want to do something you can find yourself way busier then if you want to get something done. 
---
You guys are idiots. They're giving you 10% less plex. Not taking 10% off the price

I thought it was 2 hours/week for streamers (simulcasting their own stream) in exchange for being hosted by CCP (bigger audience, in theory) and a free sub per month.
---
you see, so far i've thought you really was just an incredibily stupid person, but this is just not possible, it has to be bait.
---
I mean, botting programs weren't so easily obtainable and usable by your average retard 15 years ago.  Also, multiboxing was still considered to be "ULTRA MEGA NERD" to most people so I highly doubt it was anywhere near the prevalence of today.
---
11 years playing and it doesn't bother me, never got into watching it or anything. If people want to get riled up about it more power to them I guess.
---
Yeah it's a gradient feel black to pink
---
I suspect most are a lot of i have won eve shit is honestly bullshit. 
---
The simple reason is that really your not gonna be on reddit talking about eve if you're not playing it, the real scary part is when reddit goes from being people complaining to being people not posting because at that point people stopped caring. 
---
I am a bit astounded at their messaging lately.  Do they not have a PR person?
---
made last year when event still gave you those 
---
ITS SO FAR!
---
If CCP can't pay for a couple of flights/hotel rooms for something that honestly gives there game good PR or neutral PR ( compared to the PR hit a cancel would give ), the therein an insane amount of trouble as a company ( like we can't pay for the servers next year levels of trouble ) 
---
LR titans are far more effective than HAWs. HAWs are pretty meh, especially when compared to guns that let you blap subcaps at range, which is very common especially when defending citadels, while simultaneously being able to employ those same guns to great effect against caps, especially dreads. People who blame HAWs for the current issues are missing the forest for the trees.

If it was a staging system, and you were successfully doing 'docking games', then chances are your fleet wasn't very small... or they didn't care...  Interestingly this is exactly how it works now... n+1 and all.
---
You also just repeated what I said.  The only consequence of war is location on the map (with a nod to temporary power shifts, but since the loss happened, that is moot).  
---
Infinite builds were already possible in various capacities pre-citadels.  You are getting closer though.  Also titan material cost is well under 40bn, and has been for a while.  The price differential is another clue as to the proliferation mechanism.  
---
I am not joking.  If 2019 eve's issues are as described, they did not start in 2015 like you idiots think.  Your 'side' often argues the PCU or ACU of the players as a metric, but if you look it proves them wrong.  The 'rise of the mega-empires' follows the trend of these power creeps.  I saw it in my local areas, we see it in the mega-corps.  [Picture](https://cdn1.eveonline.com/community/MER/Jan_2017/corpstream.png) shows that the top 25 corps potentially doubled in 2012-2017.  A decent portion of the later gains will be the alpha changes no doubt, but couple this with the 'PCU loss' around the 2012-2014 area that 'elite pvpers' like to point out as the 'death of small gang pvp'.  Coincidental timing, no monsieur?
---
i can get behind this post
---
Yes that is essentially what im saying but they arent just doing poorly.  They are hands down doing absolutely nothing for the longevity of the game.  This is a cash grab and has been since the sale to PA.  They have absolutely no interest in doing anything but making sure their inflated bot numbers are still in place regardless of the damage that it is doing to the game it self.  I mean i can't say i blame them.  I just wouldn't sacrifice what I have worked so hard on for such a long time for a little bit of short term financial incentive.  They clearly don't feel the same way.  I used to shit on the starcitizen devs because they were so blatant with their cash grab antics but at least they were up front with it.  They didn't try to blow smoke up their players asses for 3 fucking years. I dont want to stop playing this game because it is the only game that has ever given me an adrenaline rush but im thinking I wont be coming back this winter becuase there is nothing left for me here
---
Do you even know what Brisc does for a living?
---
Excellent job. 
---
&gt; That's a question of priorities, like CCP doesn't value the AT over other things ( like flying dev's around to be visible ) 
---
It has zero to do with money.  It has to do with time.
---
&gt; the issue is I'm not so sold this reasoning is gonna change all that much next year 
---
They're doing this round-the-world gig because the only convention center in Iceland that is big enough to hold Fanfest is being remodeled this year, so it's not available.
---
Next year, remodel's done.  And after all that travel, I really don't think anyone at CCP will mind staying home.
---
How so? Moons vend moongoo, but rather than going into the pockets of an alliance directly, it goes to the players. They still generate wealth.
---
clearly we need more navy cruisers. Gimme my Navy Moa!
---
excuse me
---
CCP does just Eve because that is what the people who own the company (PA) want. When Eve eventually shutters, you can be certain Pearl Abyss will have plenty of other projects 
---
The AT is quite a niche thing, with ~500 players (of the, what - 500k players?)  taking part in it.  Peak views hit 10k in the best of times, 5k average for the last two years.  So really, not that unpopular an opinion to say "meh I really don't care".  
---
What made people have such an intense reaction, though, wasn't the AT being put on hiatus necessarily - but what the AT represents.  It's one of the last vestiges of EVE history and gameplay that rewards small, coordinated groups outplaying opponents.  For the last 3 years those players have felt like their playstyles were being marginalized and they were being pushed out, and the removal of the AT represents that trend even more.  
---
An actual unpopular opinion on /r/Eve would be to say that RnK were C tier PvP'ers at best who relied soley on taking fights against novice opponents who couldn't escalate enough to deal with a handful of triage carriers.  
---
I  care. 
---
Hahaha! Get it? It's mining! GUYS, MINING. MINING. HEY GUYS. GUYS? Guys? Mining! Hahahaha!
---
A bunch of random no name conflicts so small you cannot even point to one as an example?
---
+1 to this so much.
---
Also please just let me hit "Play All" again instead of making me add all my accounts to a group *every time I open the launcher* if I don't want the launcher to remember them.
---
Or the toggle switch for launching multiples at once, I like the toggle switch. But no. No more toggle switch for me. Only sadness.
---
No, as CCP no longer publishes subscriber counts publically. You could perhaps do an analysis on active or concurrent player counts, but that isn't quite the same thing. 
---
how do i rmt with a biomassed character
---
Well they *did* fire their community team...
---
The thing here is this: the farmers, the miners, used to be the ones farmed for content.
---
There has been a real shift in my Corp where the pvpers shot ships and decided wars and the farmers provided us with ships.
---
These days, the farmers basically won. It is not something to get salty about, just a fact,
---
Once a titan was something for the hardcore, something out of reach of the normal line member and only the most dedicated got those.
---
These days, they are within the grasp to whoever has a rorq and mines for a month.
---
And guess what our farmers are good at?
---
The pvpers got surpassed by the farmers because THEY are the ones getting the titans which they previously only dreamed about.
---
And they don’t stop at one titan.
---
Faces it guys, those previously farmed farmers grew some teeth.
---
And there’s a lot of them.
---
Yes and no, for something broken to be a problem you need people both aware and with the means to exploit it skill injectors gave the means and well the internet gave the knowledge so that's why it's a problem now.
---
Now unless you literally roll back all skill injector SP ( yes please ), you're kinda stuck dealing with people exploiting the alternative is fix the exploitable mechanic and it's honestly the more realistic solution. 
---
That's why it becomes an issue now the means to exploit the issue have been unlocked for the majority of the player base (and that leads to visibility), and more people facing exploiters as opponents. 
---
Now where on the brain did the spod touch you?
---
It's CCP's new "Chinless Wonder" player skin. Available now for just 150 Plex! 
---
Zainou 'Gypsy' chin restoration booster E-719 also available in-game! Buy it now!
---
You're in touch with the player base, not out of touch. Most people don't care about at
---
Are you a solo wormholer
---
&gt;It has zero to do with money. It has to do with time.
---
Yes but time is still a resource, so CCP choice to spent there dev time on flying them to pubs all over the world rather than do the AT. 
---
This means CCP as an entity value's there devs being around the world more then they value the AT.
---
&gt;Next year, remodel's done. And after all that travel, I really don't think anyone at CCP will mind staying home.
---
The issue is that most of the volunteer devs are no longer with CCP, last years AT barely made and after a canceled year the pressure to keep doing it as a yearly event is gone. 
---
I really don't see too many employees sinking in there personal time again. 
---
send some to Estebor Stormcrag pls
---
He offered only one when asked, you're free to offer more.
---
They're privy to game features/development before it's announced, so yeah? 
---
I didn't know you played grandma!
---
Only spodbrains care even though most of them don't watch it, don't participate in it but hey, it's reeeeeee time in /eve just like those idiots started when Pearl abyss took over. Remember those bastards who said they would quit the game? Wish they did but here they are getting apoplectic again over nothing.
---
Make your own game?  Yeah what a feasible and sensible solution you smooth brain mongoloid. 
---
I've never seen anyone do this before, and I hope it becomes the new standard on posts like these. 
---
&gt; run the numbers on player retention &amp; wardecs.
---
Sounds like you're saying the CSM never thought to ask CCP the question, a glowing endorsement.
---
Ok, gotcha, yea, I use T2s pretty much exclusively on mine. I'll play with it, see what I can do if I go with an EM Energized instead of Hrdener and play with those neuts and stuff, see what happens.
---
I want some
---
(Send to henrygi)
---
That will get them in legal trouble in a lot of places. 
---
i kinda prefer the standard caldari colors, would be even better if in rattaa sunset red 
---
Yep! It’s split 50/50 between this and robl0x
---
CSM is not usefull, generally speaking it is only a 0.0 block intel gathering tool, and has been for some time.
---
So yes remove it pls
---
Stop buying skins.

Jokes on them. No one left worked on the single server game originally or now knows how to work on it reliably.

Fuck this launcher takes me back
---
Relying on humans to shed their competitive nature and give up a potential competitive advantage is going to disappoint you every time.
---
I definitely share your opinion if we're talking about the real world, but it's a game. Who didn't like spamming monks in AoE or carriers (lol) in SC?
---
Balance the game so zerging isn't the only way to win, ccp
---
Didn't want that AT ship anyway, and also already replaced.
---
But this is fixable, makes resources scarce enough and people will be forced to spread out and conquer.
---
You say you have a feeling that a new game is just around the corner. What would this game be? 
---
How many kills did he get with it before feeding ?
---
I unsubscribed my main account but in the short term I'll continue using market purchased PLEX while I decide whether to stick or not.
---
For me the AT wasn't a factor in this decision. It's the last two events showing more and more soft testing of paid cheating future store options (the testing of loot boxes here, the time limited skill injector augmentor in the last one). 
---
Neither crosses the line of clear proof the game will be scaling up paid cheating but both make me distrust CCP even more.

The North died on their try hard attitude. The Fact fucking with every ally, calling them meatshield etc. I still have no clue how they could fail so Hard After the Casino War.

That's a pretty sweet deal. No /s

CCP. Changed. The game. 
---
i'd like to thank anveri for waiting until I got home from work to die so I could make fun of him
---
Honestly, I'm right there with you.  I watched AT, but I don't really care about it going away.  I've been living in lowsec since 07 and am still having fun regularly.   We still get kills, we still lose ships and we could give less of a shit about almost everything people are bitching and threatening about.  The game would probably be fun if you didn't need 2000 people to help you undock too.

You can see inside the containers on assets tab if you are in search tab and leave it blank then find st ration they are in and expand.

Not really true. It's just that fun would find you more often than you really want to.

I should have said more about PvP. I had a lot more battles while living in WH, than I ever had in K-Space. For example once I got a camped Astero in relic site. I didn't run away, though I had all the chances to. I took the battle just to see couple of BCs to warp in from nowhere and help him. Not much fun. The other time, however, I scanned down every site in C3, there were some data sites which I didn't want to do. I was almost done with scanning when I saw other Astero in the system. Decided to camp him, long story short - not only it was a great battle (we both died, what are the odds of that happening?), but I also got contacted by the other pilot and had a really enjoyable conversation. I also shot couple of explorers, and once I also saw a totally obvious bait of 4 ventures and a prospect in one gas site. Had nothing else to do so decided to have some fun. As soon as I decloak and lock a prospect, nemesis uncloaks nearby, i switch to nemesis, while taking it to armor Loki decloaks. Before he can lock me I take down Nemesis. Now at this point I had a second when I could cloak, or warp off as Loki had not yet locked me up. But I didn't expect that to happen and just missed that chance. So Loki blew me up. Still was fun, as I did take Nemesis down.
---
Now when there are groups of tackle+multiple T3Cs I just don't see much fun to face them, not only I don't have a chance to win, I even wouldn't be able to take somebody down. I don't see a point to go against the larger groups, that's it. As I said - you would see PvP content more often than you (or at least that's how I feel about it) would be willing to have.
---
Outside of HAW titan, I fail to see which 8 capitals can hold hundreds of subs. And yes HAW titans are dumb.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say Cap and Supercaps are fine, just that what most people are proposing, which each hinder the ability for capitals to remove subcap from the field will leave them useless.
---
Also Mordus ships can be LP farmed (using 5Z station), especially via nullsec burners, which doesn't make you risk anything outside of a 300M frigates that will escape most gang easily, and you cannot pass the gate with anything else than a frigate.

This isn't true, if you go on the ITL website and order with high collateral, the price goes up.

I fucking love [aesop rock!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEBGCOCxLgA)
---
are they allergic to working on eve wtf
---
For all the hate that starbases and moonmining got, it sure was better than whatever we have now with these Upwell monstrosities polluting every goddamn system.
---
But the real surprise to me, as someone who hadn't played this game in 8 years, is asset safety. If you had told players in 2005-2010 that, eventually, they'd be able to move their stuff from across the map with the click of a button, they'd have declared you mad.
---
CCP made the same mistake Blizzard made - make it easier for the "casual" player, not realzing that it'd hurt the game in the long term. I don't think Eve can recover from this. Unlike Blizzard, who are launching "WoW Classic" this summer (A re-release of the 2004-version of the game), CCP can't launch an old version of Eve.
---
That's the easy way to hide failure. Like blaming White toxic masculinity.
---
If it were X titans rolling through some systems and taking out 100s of Rorqs then it'd be good. Like this.... its just garbage.
---
So you would have wanted around 1000 subcaps to be able to kill 3-500 supercaps with FAX support ?  
---
Big fucking difference.
---
Can't do that without alts, nor do I see a point why would anyone do it totally alone.
---
That probably explains why CCP treats EVE like a wartime slave.

---
It's petition time!
---
&gt; Do you have any to the contrary? No one here has evidence other than our experiences
---
Well then my experience says that these bots are all new. I'm ready for your counter argument
---
I'm just here to tell anveri he's shit, don't mind me.
---
i already petitioned ccp and they told me they will replace it soon
---
Do you think Apex Legends has a dedicated balance team?
---
Cruisers gang kills capitals everyday. Hell, a lone supercarrier would also lose against a good gang like this.
---
The problem here is not the random renter that drop a carrier on you, is it ?
---
Finally! The balance team has been announced :)
---
They better bring back world of darkness... Buttholes.
---
But then those who already have the resources can invade. Once one side has unsaillable wealth then only another entity with wealth can fight.  Attempts at costs associated with large space would have worked in the past but it’s probably too late now 
---
Jaguar was tackle and Jaguars are OP
---
There were many hanging on by a thread, now that thread is broken and I don't think I will see them ever again.
---
I still have daydreams about that milk stout from the pub downstairs from CCP HQ.

https://i.imgur.com/l82uxcw.png
---
My fav pic I got of the fight.
---
CCP sold WOD and white wolf to paradox unfortunately. 
---
That would be assuming you are generally more skilled than the group attacking you, and trust me I like winning while outnumbered.
---
But let's be honest, you cannot outbrain the same enemy everytime.
---
But they had the game more than half made, just re-brand it.
---
That's one possible method, although I think using disincentives is better than hard bans. Also low sec wouldn't allow for interactions with the sov game, and is a fair bit larger than the region sizes I'm imagining
---
Get rid of local.
---
You know the Arithmos are going to get a hell of a lot nastier soon...
---
In before CCP spends millions and millions of dollars on this project and then abandon it.
---
No, it’s just really cold in space...
---
Fucking retarded. Hilmar is actually annoyed that Eve is his greatest accomplishment and literally just uses it's revenue for his own little playground of failscading ideas. 
---
Take a look at their glassdoor page. Only advice to management is to hire a new ceo. 
---
PEARL ABYSS. TAKE THE HINT
---
It was probably the biggest scifi show on the air at the time, if not very close. They cancelled the show not because it wasn't profitable or popular but because they wanted the budget for Battlestar Galactica, if I recall correctly.
---
At least Farscape was the one instance where ScyFy made it right by releasing peacekeeper wars.
---
ppl from pizza + people from broski + some people from ncdot = INRI, take the broski out and you have skillU + the new corps

I don't get it.

what a great investment! how long will it take before you can cash out and repay your mortgage? :)
---
AA Report: I was warping through the system around half an hour earlier and saw the Rifter + Caedes on dscan at the small. I attempted to bait him then with my Enyo but he didn't take it. We continued with our random roam and ended up circling back using the classic GalMil Derptron as bait, which he hilariously fell for. The jag spiked into system and got tackle on the Caedes. Anveri must have panicked because he took tackle off the Derp, allowing it to get secondary tackle on the Caedes. I came into system last and got tertiary tackle and it was game over. While I don't care for the meta of flying AT frigs as glorified kill whore snipers, props to this guy for undocking! 
---
Why would you ever want to get it fixed?
---
https://www.gamertribute.com/eve-online-war-stories/
---
sorry your single page retardedly bad google search is bad.
---
&gt; conflicts so small you cannot even point to one as an example?
---
we all know that regardless of what conflict I tell ya you'll just arbitrarily say they're too small to be considered, so why even bother.

"One manager couldn't answer questions on gameplay or focus. I  remember him standing over the shoulder of a programmer putting his  finger to his lips and saying 'No - make it more... *psssshhhh*’" Having people like this as managers would explain why a large part of the changes and events over the years have been complete shit.
---
&gt;Everyone always at CCP for not throughly finishing or thinking things out. Like every.single.patch.
---
Yes, we get fucking pissed when CCP rush a chat system that didn't even work on sisi, or rush a fix by breaking everything else, or throw something new in without thinking about it at all. That doesn't mean they need to cancel an annual event like the AT that just needs prize ships added, matches run, ruleset updated, and prizes given at the end. They have a year between each one, more than enough time to make sure the ruleset will work and the prizes won't break the game without coming anywhere near rushing it.
---
&gt;JESUS you all are whiney ungrateful gamers.
---
"ur all whiney because an event that takes relatively few resources and is good for player numbers (profit) was cancelled for no actual reason" lmao
---
Just like a frigate can be a serious threat to a battleship? 
---
While I get your point, why do you expect people to answer your roam with a fleet of the same capacity when you are in their home ?
---
I get it, wormhole people do that sometimes and reship/downsize to "have good fight". 
---
You are assuming your gameplay must be what people should try to follow, which is wrong. A guy mining in his rorqual doesn't care that you want gudfites, he will remove you from space by any means necessary.
---
Today, these means are "MUH CYNO TITAN BOSON HAW". Do you know what they will do without it ? Dock, they will dock. Or just throw in 15 times your subcaps numbers and erase you from the constellation if you dare to fight. Never expect people to actually want good fights when you are trespassing.
---
Try roaming in RMT space, see if people form gangs to fight you.
---
Also you kind of wrong on the SOV map. People can invade other people, and having a supercap fleet doesn't prevent you from being dunked (X47 &amp; H-5 Keepstars fights are good example).
---
What's blocking people from invading or taking space is the retarded structure spamming, because bashing citadels is much fun.
---
Also, did you try to go through an Ansiblex with a capital fleet ? Because you  will have some problems.
---
The way to beat these already established alliances then would be guerilla warfare with groups spread out attacking their space left and right, question is would there be enough players willing to give it a go instead of just taking their super and joining the blob ?
---
Let's just play Apex Legends my dudes.
---
I was really hoping it would be a client disconnect message or a crash error. Those were the only pics I got of that fight. 
---
close
---
jag was in system and i thought i could've memed the atron and moonwalked out (spoiler alert: i did not)
---
i tried to tackle the jag with my rifter, however im dumb and that did not happen (rip)
---
speedy boy jag got a scram on me
---
by the time you were neuted out, the enyo had secondary tackle and the rest is history
---
Do they even have that much to throw away right now? They have a shooter in developement, this project they are now hiring for and more than one mobile game in the cooker. Unless big daddy PA is just writing them blank checks they can't have that much cash to throw around because we all know hilmar isn't going to spend any of his own money from the sale on it just so he can cancel the project in 5 years when its still at square 1.
---
Updooted for uploading it. Need more people uploading and sharing their vids. 
---
Having regions where there are no capitals because of jump fatigue isn't going to happen. If the region is worth having then people will just make alts,skill inject to a capital, and only use them in that area.  With the way the game is now, the only way it will happen is one of two ways. One the space sucks no one wants it or two they can't deploy there like highsec.
---
Is it "nerf rorquals week" again already? I thought it was "balance capitals" week that got sidelined for "reeee, no AT".
---
Frigates are fucking terrifying to battleships not kitted to deal with them.
---
Not as well as the others in its class
---
The problem with guerilla is it so freaking time consuming and to what end? Sit cloaked up while you sleep to lower the systems rating and when you are present kill a few vni and procures. 
---
AAR: Our elaborate trap started with an intensive planning and intel phase, consisting of: "hey that Caedes is back in the small." I then sprung said trap by ordering our drunken derptron pilot into the plex with our mission-specific phrase "yeah dude just get your ass in there." I then tactically warped to the plex, burned at the Caedes, scram/web etc. etc. Gori brought the extra DPS and Teizo Amatin showed up in a Burst to make sure we stayed alive. gf and props to the pilot for undocking. 
---
&gt;Relying on humans to shed their competitive nature and give up a potential competitive advantage is going to disappoint you every time.
---
Wait you never see groups do this, honestly, you must have the worst fights, no seriously like most of the really great fight I been in some group gave up a competitive advantage by choosing to engage even known the advantage was not on there side ( generally it's a rather mild offset ). 
---
Like to me, it seems a problem rooted in null sec culture in general and the goons seem to be the worse example of it.
---
&gt;ccp making a new game
---
anyone want to place bets on how long before this one gets dumpstered with dust, valkyrie, and nova?
---
as long as eve makes enough money for them to start up new games that die in 3 months on a regular basis why would they want to do something silly like improve it
---
That's what you get when you don't do angel fleet.
---
&gt;PEARL ABYSS
---
we don't speak that name here unless you want to bring plex lootboxes into the game, you can hardly expect them to be any better than hilmar
---
I really enjoyed that type of gameplay before i quit but i get that it's not for the majority of players.
---
Anyways it was just something off the top of my head that i thought would shake things up a bit, i'm not known for my creativity. anything would be better than the current predicament tbh.
---
Quite honestly 90% of the stuff this sub bitches about has little to no impact on how I play the game. I'd like it if ore prices went up because rorqs died out, (but then again my favorite ice would lose all value) but other than that I don't know why I even browse this sub
---
Grug see Korea tribe fund CCP.  Korea tribe tell Hilmug ignore gameplay, add more options for berry-pickers!  Autistic black and yellow flying egg tribe with magic rock collectors "necessary for healthy game".  Grug hear many story from shaman: magic rock collectors work even when tribe sleeping!  Grug hide in wormcave now to get away from sleeping rock collectors, but Russia tribe throwing logs at anomaly while sleeping too.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/94167103/losses/
---
Grug wonder where gameplay fix is to prevent sleeping tribes from collecting rocks or throwing logs, until Grug remember CCP no care as long as each sleeping tribe berry-picker pay 500 stick each month.  
---
Grug think Balance Team tribe is a dream, because Krug need to be sleeping to believe it.  
---
Fortunately, being able to afford a ship doesnt equate to being able to fly it well.
---
Did writing that post make your self-esteem rise again? It's OK, we can talk about anything here.
---
You need to stop the World of Darkness meta and work on Eve. Because people are uninstalling or biomassing left and right. 
---
CCP and long term plan, lol.
---
Bdo could have been great if Pearl Abyss wasn't the greediest publisher to have ever walked the Earth
---
didn't hilmar start the birth control pills with project nova
---
Nice pipe.
---
How long is the average timeline from project announcement to never hearing about it again? I wanna say 2 years
---
Black Dersert Online 2
---
however long it takes hilmar to get bored, he was only halfway into the pregnancy when he got an abortion for nova but dust at least lived long enough for them to try and integrate it into real eve
---
[last time didn't go well though](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74398790/)
---
Nice, I don't think I would ever make it that far. That's the point where you start making so much ISK from Sleepers, that spending time on other stuff (like mining, harvesting a gas, or doing PI) makes no sense anymore. And it's like saying a good-bye to the best half of this game for me.
---
[here you go](https://pics.ballmemes.com/ive-reached-300-meters-under-the-sea-the-pressure-here-26525062.png)
---
My thinking is that high jump fatigue (or i suppose more aptly jump timers) makes escalating with capitals a serious  time commitment because they will be unable to respond to any other fight for an extended period of time.
---
If you couple that with low site spawn rate (per system) where each site is high isk/min, you can make sub caps the prefered ship for responding to almost every low to mid level fight. You can tune the region so that sub caps get higher ticks by virtue of warping to sites faster, and are best for engaging enemies by virtue of being able to quickly recover from a fight.
---
In this region capitals lose their farming power, and while they retain their pvp supremacy they come with a long cooldown that will leave you vulnerable when used. Enabling smaller groups to bait capital escalations, and then leave system to go attack a now defenseless region (if your enemy has decided to only have a dedicated capital defense fleet)
---
Of course someone will try to just brute force with capitals, but they will inevitably lose out to the groups that adapt to the region's meta. I also know for a fact that capitals can become naturally inferior to bring to fights, because this already happens in C4- wormholes. Groups are usually hesitant to engage with capitals since accidentally engaging a force that can handle them results in a several month long window without capital superiority. They become reserved for only certain victory (ie flexing) or battles for continued existence.
---
How many upvotes can this simple caveholer get for this?
---
Its at least 20 hours of flying from Australia (depending on if you are east or West Coast). 
---
It would be closer to 26 hours from New Zealand. 
---
So roughly $4-5k return
---
Insert credit card, receive loot box.  Rinse and repeat until credit limit reached.
---
any suggestion would be better than their current plan to make the accelerators take so much effort to build that no one really bothers.
---
&gt; those previously farmed farmers grew some teeth
---
no they didn't, they just kept farming. They didn't get better, the game got worse.
---
Hmmmmmmm
---
Supply vs Demand.
---
Cancelled so they can devote more resources to balancing.
---
Grug think volcano tribe need sleeping tribe to get rock. That why it no go. No sleeping tribe, then volcano tribe starve. Volcano tribe almost starve when they banish ISGrug. Volcano tribe no fool: only Grug fool for remain in volcano tribe land.
---
&gt; Strong understanding of game balance methodologies
---
Finally!
---
I moved to highsec.... adapt  and overcome son
---
Is it me or are mmos almost always just run into the ground? 
---
 Does this game not make a profit?
---
Instead of voicing general discontent we could also start shitting up reddit with requests for specific, high-quality changes. 
---
Such as:
---
-&gt; Add a direct cyno suppression module to blops
---
-&gt; Revert the ECM changes for fighters so they can be jammed
---
-&gt; Make supercapitals immune to FAX reps
---
etc. Might have more impact than just screaming that ccpsux. 
---
In CCPs defense, it’s pretty stupid to put all your eggs in one basket and it makes sense that they want another successful game under their belts.
---
Too bad they’ve proven many, many times that they’re not only incapable of fixing their one successful game, but incapable of making a new successful game.
---
Honestly CCP. Just put all this money into fixing Eve. Fix the balance problems. Make it more approachable for new players without having to shaft the veterans. Then market the shit out of it. 
---
Learn how to fix your current mess before picking up another, or both are going to fail. On the other hand, play the right cards with the current successful game/IP you have and you might finally have enough money to hire a competent management staff (I’m fully convinced it’s the management that’s the problem and not the devs)
---
Maybe they’re allergic to money. It all makes sense now. Trying to grow as much of it away while pushing away their paying user base.
---
That’s actually a really good point. Apart from changes to citadels, one of the important balancing steps would be adding some vulnerability to titans or adding another ship class that can counter them, and making sure that that new vulnerability/class is balanced, although I myself can’t think of an idea like that, especially not on the fly.
---
Of course, the balance team is already working on the new event sites and SKIN rewards so we don’t want to give them a larger workload.
---
In space.
---
You forgot "citadels in general".
---
I'd actually give CCP the benefit of the doubt for all the shit they pulled if they came out and said "no new content expansions this year, we're going focus solely on fixing the game."
---
I actually highly suspect that their current development strategy might be to not work on any content that's specific to just one part of the game. FW is fucked, but they won't work on it, because it only affects lowsec players. Sov is fucked and makes no sense in citadel meta, but they won't work on it, they don't want to release a nullsec-specific expansion (onslaught kinda was, but it was an extension of citadel and abyss).
---
Structures with asset safety in empire space, alpha clones, abyssal space, activity tracker, adding moon mining to wormholes at the last minute, the new launcher... It's these misguided attempts at trying to please everybody (and to draw new, non-existing players in) over the past 3 years that led them to completely losing track of who their target audience is.
---
The solution is this: CCP, start playing your own fucking game. If the devs no longer have the passion to do that to understand what's broken, that's how you know you really fucked up. Let them back into sovnull alliances even. I think we can all put up with a little blueprint fraud at this point, if that's what it takes to get shit fixed.

You're an actual retard.  Theres at least a dozen different major wars I can name from 2010 to 2012 alone that didn't involve BoB or Goons.  Named conflicts, things that formed fucking legends in this game.  I won't bother because you're a fucking brainlet who unironically thinks the only conflict involving drone russians was with intrepid fucking crossing lmfao.

hey valkyrie was a successful recreation of real eve (in that at least 90% of "people" you played with were actually bots)

If I was your employee,  I wouldn't be mad at you for this.  Just mad that you didn't invite.  Call it a company morale boost

I love how everyone thinks that AT is gone forever. We aren't having one THIS YEAR. That was all the announcement said.
---
STILL MAD ABOUT THE FIRST TITAN LOSS BEING THE OLDEST EREBUS WE HAD IN AM0K.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
No not at all.  But killing a Keepstar isn't evidence that Subcaps are not oppressed by Capitals.
---
More like salt from everybody.  The only people who hate the AT are CODE.  
---
I would personally enjoy taking risk, mining in nullsec without Cap umbrellas but most of the empire or bigger alliance only care about their killboards..
---
I don't think there is hope for small alliance to get a part in null anymore when you face bigger alliance that can drop at any given time with unlimited resource.. 
---

---
This sounds like a yearly stomp and compare eve with the past rant.  
---
I only play since 2013,  but i enjoyed every year and from those years some nerfs are loved and hated.  Sure skynetting was great for some small groups,  but always a few ruin it for the rest and so we get hit with the balance hammer.
---
I do notice less frequent updates, but to be fair CCP is involved in more then 1 game now.  Exspecting the same lvl of attenting every year,  thats a luxury few games have. 
---
If CCP can grow as a company,  we will see more given back to this game aswell.  Can't all be great whale years.  
---
Is the music that starts at 1:00 really wii music? 
---
Consider most every ship or doctrine flown in the game.
---
Outside of booshing comps or executing normal doctrines while significantly outnumbered there are none that require basically any finesse whatsoever. Compared to old ABC snipers or pre defender bomb fire walling the most complex thing your average line member might be asked to do is mash their invulnerability button on their HAC.
---
Triage is hilariously easy and let’s not even get started on titans or supers.

yessir, mii channel to be specific

You are actually a moron.
---
You fuckers are soooooo fucking retarded
---
 Stop wasting money on failed idea after failed idea and actually care about this mother fucking game 
---
It’s the old carebear with teeth slogan. 
---
The game got developed to the point that they are in perpetual safety and can blob any aggressor with almost infallible intelligence.
---
They think they grew teeth because the sheer cowardice of the krab was rewarded by the game devs 
---
Dry memes for dinner again 😭
---
What if... we held the AT... in Uedama. They'd love it then. /s
---
oh haha.
---
seriously though. AT was EVE's Superbowl.   so it sucks being shut down.
---
How so? Where is your infinite font of PI? Can we have some?
---
i bet this HIGH QUALITY POST took you a whole 10 seconds to come up with
---
9 seconds.
---
The Purge event
---
And you're free to actually read the minutes.  Or pay attention when CSM members post and say "we did this".  Like, the fact that wormholes don't have asset safety is because of the CSM.
---
My favorite part of AT is wishing I had 300 Billion ISK so I could buy one of the trophy ships to cruise around in.
---
Everyone on Eve preaches, "never fly what you can't afford" and so the entire populous of Eve goes about trying to make isk the most efficient way and buy the cheapest shit that would have zero consequence losing. Then people bitch and write a book that things are the way they are..

Did I say that? No. Just pointed out that it's not entirely free for them and never has been.

Ya but at least Paradox is a company who actually takes care of their games. Especially their staples....I mean CK2 is probably the best game on steam and its like a decade old. 
---
Folks keep pointing to asset safety, and I think there's a nuance that's lost.
---
Previously we had two tiers of asset recovery. In the first tier, all my stuff is in a POS. You explode my POS, and you can steal my stuff. In the second tier, I was wealthy enough to lay down an Outpost. My stuff is in that outpost, and you can take it, but you can't get my stuff. I can try to get someone to move it out for me, or retake it to get my stuff back.

Now we've totally lost the first tier and changed the second tier to be more forgiving.
---
I'd like to see a changed system wherein Medium citadels loot pinata. It'll put more risk in the game, especially for groups looking to invade and base out of one.
---
I have no idea what a safety system for Large and Yo Mom-Sized Citadels would look like.
---
It's solid rod, no pipes.
---
Background is 45° side seals, just practice
---
It's a symbol of the ever-growing apathy in regards to CCPs approach to the game and it's community.
---
No fanfest this year
---
No AT this year
---
Rare balance passes 
---
I really feel bad for the devs who have made Eve their life.  But clearly the higher ups in CCP are only keeping enough people employed to keep this game plugging along on auto-pilot.  Merely a source of revenue and an IP to fund other games.  
---
This all just bums me out, it feels like we've been taken for granted.
---
They are allergic to money, its why they keep throwing it away.
---
Titans have been the only ship that matters for a very long time.
---
Stopped reading after first sentence. 
---
CCP Fozzie, when can we expect tiericide to be complete. Its only been 6 years.
---
Yeah.. I had done PI before, never again.
---
I did some gas mining, but found it not worth it, I even brought a rorq into the hole, but the ores just aren't worth it.
---
But to each his own, I just loved being able to use dreads in a PVE setting instead of them being throw aways. I never got tired of it, and the added risk of someone rolling in right when you siege makes it even better. 
---
Post is basically perfect apart from an over emphasis on cynos on HAW titans and an under emphasis on citadel mechanics at large.
---
Not being able to rep them is almost as dumb as their damage cap and sheer power (why do they have launchers/webs/neuts again?) 
---
Cynos are fairly important acting as an instant module as they’re one of the only tools for generating nonconsentual pvp (bridging in front of a fleeing gang, on top of a tackled miner, on top of those tackling your ratter etc) but agree that it seems bizarre that a cyno inhibitor wouldn’t inhibit a cyno once it was online. You could make the case that then the onlinining timer should be longer but that’s really irrelevant minutiae when you consider that rorquals can still take mobile micro jumps still. 
---
For 1 year.
---
Just like you can only pull so much thought from the spod rock between your ears lmao
---
CCP has a twitch stream?
---
Yeah, no Iceland this year, but a bunch of them spread around so that more people have a chance to attend. THE HORROR!!!!!!!
---
Yeah? Is it any good?
---
With monkeys
---
They used to be, especially post phoebe and pre citadel, complete and utter garbage for anything other than bridging and driveby DDing. 
---
I didn't do it myself, so I dunno.
---
I understand that you are hopelessly out of your depth, but you don't need to react to things that you'll never be able to understand with such projection.
---
Louisiana? Pretty sure I've met a few coonass eve players.
---
*blinks*
---
Apparently this discussion isn't worth my time.
---
You get skins from these?
---
*looks at prospect*
---
I disagree haw guns need to go to often a small gang will have haw dreads dropped they have no counter for most small groups as shockingly not everyone has a counter cap/super fleet let alone one on st and by.
---
That would be better I think
---
His name was Toxic Apollo.
---
It's further pawning responsibility for gatherings onto the playerbase.  Very similar to how they could barely get an AT event together and had to rely on players in the form of EveNT.
---
Yes and no. If you try and do all of it, youll flounder a bit before finding what you like. Thats fine, just dont try and do everything on one character forever - youll waste time.
---
Generally if you find your niche then 99% of the stuff you wont need to touch
---
See I think it’a worse than that. PA’s an easy scape goat, their actions are invisible to us so we can ascribe everything bad to them.
---
No, the blame is entirely on CCP - they were the ones who chose to make these monetization changes because their investors started squawking for returns. And when they realized they weren’t going to see them, they forced the companies hand to sell so they could recoup their money. They claimed to have these grand plans but the financials don’t lie - quarterly statements are god, and they are beholden. 
---
What’s worse is that they chose those changes, their investment in VR, the failure of Dust 514, all of it. They floundered utterly for years, making changes to EVE that have continually dropped PCU. And then they had the balls to double down, divert resources to so many hairbrained projects (Where’s that EVE Mobile game at CCP? Yet another dustbinned concept you wasted time and money on?).
---
Truly I think they went mask off when they teased that mobile game (to thunderous silence I’ll add). They’ve bought into the cult of mobile games. That means hunting whales, identifying your biggest spenders and doing everything possible to keep them spending to the detriment of all else. That certainly rings a bell for me when I look at their focus lately.
---
CCP will milk every last ounce of goodwill they can trade on to get your dollars until there is nothing left. I don’t say that as some bitter rube who hates micro transactions and DLC. I state that as fact - it is an industry standard for mobile games to do exactly that. They will cash out on your lingering, if vague, feelings of positivity when you think of EVE until they can no longer turn a profit, and then they will be quietly gutted and Ol’ Yellered by PA when the beancounters have sucked the marrow out of it’s husk

---
"I can't get free carebear kills anymore gg qq" is what this wall of text boils down to.
---
Basically you're quitting because killing carebears became harder than your self-entitled par for it. HTFU, Triumvitrash.
---
Keep going I’m almost there
---
And falcons comments about looking at promoting player based tournaments in the future makes it sound like they are looking at off loading tournaments onto the player base just like they have the kill board sites over the years so while for now its a one year break by the time it comes around again it may very well be permanent
---
Sorry, that's all you get for a free sample. I'm a highly paid dominatrix and I can't let word get out that I give it away for free.
---
Jag pilot here. Can confirm. Also git off mah Villasen citadel. 
---
Unfortunately for the drifters all the structure timers are set to tuesday at downtime.
---
Everywhere in life we see people wishing things were easier, that life would be enjoyable if things were easier. This is flatly untrue. Everything exist in relation: there are no highs without lows, no pleasure without pain, no success without failure. The greatness of all things is directly proportional to the scope of possible experiences. 
---
Hopefully someone at CCP will have the balls to admit this truth and realise that what has made this game great is the struggle, the possibility of total failure, and that the casualties along the way are the cost of greatness. 
---
Does the bad man want to take your 7 rorquals away? Is that why you’re lashing out son?
---
You just linked me some shit from 2010-2015 about BoB and Goon remnants doing war, like I said.
---
CCP turns losing millions of dollars and ignoring their golden goose into a passion.
---
Neither does afghanistan
---
Space monkeys again ?!
---
My own idea is to make supercaps immune to fax reps (and probably all reps); they'd still be good but wouldn't be reliably isk-efficient vs. dreads. (This puts them on par with dreads/faxes that need to siege to fight, except they can still warp out.) 
---
This would also be a major nerf to super-umbrella content suppression, &amp; make it easier to commit caps to a strat timer without worrying about supercap escalations as much. Probably more content all around. 
---
&gt;I can name things  
---
&gt;Proceeds to not name 1 thing
---
Truly the Eve killer CCP worries about at night
---
In bathsuits
---
It's 2019 and some silly people still believe that space without local would have carebears who aren't a bait. Human stupidity amazes me sometimes.
---
As I keep having to say to Olmeca myasshuts Gold, I don't really rat or mine...
---
Your attempts are sadly weak and lacking...
---
Broadcast to the world a competition where other sandbox players have the opportunity to harass and bully other players. This will turn out well.
---
Is it a mobile game? We all have phones don't we?
---
Let me know how guerrilla warfare works with entosis &amp; structure timers
---
Heard some rumblings that hilmar was starting to get pushed out, more so now with PA 
---
What’s ur user flair say?
---
It doesn't matter if you fly it well. It's probably better if you don't so then you use up more ore building another. 
---
Blizzard will wipe the floor with them... RIP
---
Yea CCP can be retard at trying to compete at billion dollar companies, fucking vikings 
---
siigari's a fucking nazi
---
Beautiful 
---
Disincentives are always overshadowed by motivations, this is like basic level theory here.
---
So yes Eve is directed towards the casual player, but take a look at who those players are. A large number of them are late 20s - mid 30s with careers and family. They played Eve in college and played the try hard PVP because they had the time.
---
 Now they keep up with the game the best they can and maybe pay for a sub because they can afford it now. What they don't have is a lot of time to be try hard anymore. 
---
&gt; The citadel combines the luxuries of a station with the ubiquity and near absolute safety of POSes. Consider the average regional roaming gang - previously they could harass an entity for a fight by camping their undock and needling the locals for a response. Now, this is impossible. As you say it is a decline in content patched entirely out of the game.
---
You are wrong in every part of this.
---
First of all, in terms of safety, POS outclasses citadels by A LOT. Even station does. I don't know why ability to hang out outside is so much to you as you could do that with undock invulnerability in stations as well. It came to the point where I wonder if you know the actual game mechanics to be able to tell how tremendously UNSAFE citadels are.
---
You can still perfectly harass anyone you want, and even better, since citadels are much less safe than stations, it is so much easier to grab a kill at citadel dock radius than it is on a station it's not funny. There is a reason botters use POSes you know, exactly because citadels offer much less defense from harassment.
---
P.S. btw, Triumvirate is allowed to post on reddit again?
---
Except 1 vote per account is retarded and only further entrenches huge null blocs on the csm
---
Especially when you throw dummy canidates in the other alloted spots and still have huge null blocs back them
---
Ie brisc "wormhole representative" rubal
---
Don't worry, they told us we'd get viceroys (partial control over low sec) in low sec back in 2012, I'm sure it's right around the corner.
---
If you're not a hotel employee or a frequent flyer who gets steep hotels via rewards programs and you're in a hotel at any con. You're retarded. 
---
Get you and 5-8 folk. Get you an airbnb. Save yall hundreds of dollars. Don't get hosed with stupid prices and overpriced add-ons.  
---
My last fanfest was 850 in flights and 150 in airbnb. 
---
My last pax south was 400 in flights for 2 in main cabin. 200 in airbnb. 
---
I spent more in cigars then lodging.
---
14 dreads.. how?
---
drifters ships !!! I would be all over that ! and make use corps as fuel or something like it 
---
Drink bleach brainlet

more like 7 dreads

and 3 carriers
---
TEST CHINESE BEST CHINESE  
---
EN-PL NUMBER ONE
---
wtf just throw all your money at a dying mmo
---
Exactly,  you keep your creative freedom which is a plus. But an incentive system will still push unoptimized strategies out of the meta, especially in a game like EVE. 
---
Ex. You technically can pvp in a retriever, you will however find yourself at a significant disadvantage. It's still a good thing to allow because you get great memes and stories about 'the bait retriever strategy'
---
CCP will use corporate  discounts that you won't ever see. 
---
A 2200 flight might cost me 700. 
---
A 700 hotel might cost them 150
---
Your example is stupid and shows your ignorance to corporate logistics 
---
The game wouldn't die if they gave even 2 shits of a fuck
---
Not wrong
---
This way CCP still have their money, and sometimes even more than if you just pay for your sub ^^idiot
---
"fat fuck"
---
You're speaking to a retard. 
---
Damn, that's a HUGE bitch!
---
And by that logic.. 
---
Holy shit EN-PL
---
Yeah they would bring it back right after they finish Walking in Stations
---
There are way too many retards. 
---
Plz no
---
GJ En-PL bros &lt;3

WTB aar
---
I am feeling extra salty today, so here is a bonus:
---
People used to run 2hour long missions in lowsec, shallow nullsec back in the day, in random ass fit ships ranging from T1 BC to T2 Recons, HACs and Pirate BS.  
---
They did this because the risk was worth the reward.  How is this possible you say!  Because they didn't just eat shit the second an enemy entered local...
---
Like the other guy said, let the prey animals be on reddit so you can kill them ingame.
---
BUT WE HAVE NEW SKINS!
---
PGL doesn't speak chinese
---
No more u/EGTime posts would be a good thing.
---
The value of shitty posts is very very very broken. Good Posting would be a much better content that does not unbalance the readers.
---
The Subreddit has pointed this out for threads and it was right, at least r/eve did something right.
---
All real ingame social gatherings from this subreddit's community promotes homosexuality and clicks that totally pervert the sub's natural ability to generate shitposts/ideas. Discord, logging in, r/evejobs and all other hookups you mega autists desire... So now you blurred the lines between r/eve and goodposting leaving yourself unable to post the way a content driven cesspool subreddit demands of you. The choice of most all the major posters to blend these two worlds to the max is unhealthy for the individual and the subreddit as a whole. The discord server and other big r/EvE communities are the biggest factor in the degradation of posts leaving us with hisec posts in New and prearranged shitposts becoming the norm.
---
This would be a good thing for the game. An ironic poster would do it better anyway.
---
CCP Executive: "Eve was one of the most successful MMO games ever...how we can replicate it's success by doing none of what made it successful in the first place?"
---
wojak feelsbadman sadpepe
---
Well that was short lived.
---
Blockbuster and Sears were both very successful at what they did at one point.  Blockbuster especially didn't branch out, how did that work out for it?
---
Yeah because alt are independent individuals, right?
---
Would you really want the guys doing the events, stuff like scripting, objects, maybe some textures etc. to do the balancing ?
---
please stop leaking thanks! 
---
Carriers should be adjusted so that average EHP for a standard fit is around ~700k-900k, while the incentive for pushing resistances lets them jump over the 1000k mark to maybe a bit under 1500k max with the downside is that it's a pretty killmail once a gang jumps on it.  Light fighters should be able to apply to subcaps, but at at least half or 1/3rd the current DPS.  Heavy fighters should be dedicated to structure bashing, and maybe fighting large sig subcaps with cooldown abilities only (not normal DPS, maybe needed to rely on signal boosting within the squadron to be able to apply for a moment, *or* give support fighters the ability to signal boost [not target paint, that is way OP with a bunch of squadrons on a single ship]).  Of course, drawback is that you can't bash a structure at the same time if your heavies are out with other carriers to slam a nearby battleship.
---
Dreads should have a normal EHP of ~500k-600k without siege, but then jump to double that under siege (the major bonus is still ECM invulnerability and reps, but reps could be nerfed a bit).  Of course, the urge to pile on resistances is only subverted by how batshit blingy the killmail will be in the end.  Allow dreads (and marauders) to maneuver just a bit while sieged cause immobility is boring af, but reduce agility by at least half as well (hell, maybe add another module function to cause siege to divert a bit of power to moving for a cap cost).  Reduce siege damage bonuses to maybe 4/5ths or a lower, rounded number, but other weapon bonuses are fine.
---
Eve and brick and mortar retail stores are nothing alike.   
---
Go mine more spod.
---
Even worse, you using multiple ships to do the trick! Definitely not SOLO!
---
Have a good day, dude. Don't listen to idiots like this one.
---
Don't grossly exaggerate. I have done my share of travel all over the world both on business and personal trips and since you brought up the corp stuff then you should also know how badly corps get taken for extra sometimes because everyone knows thinks can afford it. So while discounts are true, they are no where near what you say and the reverse in form of higher prices to begin with is also true.
---
Yeah good thing they stopped making Call of Duties, Halos, Warcraft and Battlefield games after the first one was successful. They really could have bankrupted themselves. 
---
Your right, business only works how you want it to work when you want it to work and is in no way bound buy universal rules across industries.  Must be nice living in an imaginary world. 
---
At this point, what choice is there? The same shit keeps happening in eve under hilmar.   
---
New leadership will either make Eve great again, or we can all finally let go and put old yeller down once and for all.
---
Yup!
---
You can AFK attack it as an alpha, no need for a sub. Unsub 1st then attack it anyways and AFK while at it. Pick some slow ROF weapon and fill your cargo full of ammo for it.
---
Be honest, that would be reason enough to log in 10 years from now
---
I was implying that you have to remove all incentive (ie hard ban).  See suicide gankers for proof.
---
&gt;new games that die in three months
---
You're saying this like the games they make actually come out of Devhell
---
They gotta fire more staff first, *then* they can cancel the project.  
---
One must observe CCP's traditions.
---
Don't mind be. Baboon passing through.
---
Yea, I'm okay with suicide carriers
---
They steam a bot running 23/7.
---
How fast does that thing go with a snake set?
---
This dude eve's.
---
This game will be a shell of it's self anyway in a year not like this game is getting actually better and lively each year
---
Jokes on us, its probably mobile.
---
&gt; Must be nice living in an imaginary world.   
---
I'd like to play in (this) one, but CCP keeps scaring away all my friends by ignoring Eve and failing every single new other project they've ever attempted :(
---
Time for CCP to divert resources to another failed project while completely neglecting the bread and butter of their company. Hope the game's called "Final Nail".
---
Drifter battleship roams the new meta.
---
Here you want some fucking content:
---
Buy a Standing Accelerator  
---
Get some Faction standing with your local pirate faction.  
---
Go camp one of their stations or drop a cheap citadel and give them docking rights (i think this still works)  
---
Tackle some shithead and watch the npc army kill everybody.  
---
I don't think so. I think they just switched their business model that is all.
---
Instead of getting paid by a wide playerbase they decided to take notes from Star Citizen and concentrate all their efforts on whales.
---
Whales in Eve Online are not same as in SC. In SC Whales by JPGs of ships for hundreds, and sometimes even thousands of dollars. Eve Whales are buying plex for injectors then paying for multiple accounts for a wide variety of purposes such as Rorqual mining for example. 
---
So the goal here is for very few players to have entire fleets of AFK ratting and Rorq mining who will pay multiple subscriptions each month for multiple accounts while fucking over everyone else. This is also why they are supporting things such as "forgetting to turn off ISBoxer" etc., and it is also why they are so bad at fighting against automation and bots within Eve Online, cause actually they arent bad, just instructed not to do all they can do.
---
Seriously, I don't understand why there is no real uproar anymore about Asset Safety. Like, what the fuck is that mechanic doing in Eve. Who in God's green Eden thought that aas a good idea?
---
This company needs to die already.  They're \_literally\_ brain dead.
---
Is that a dildo or a meth pipe? Lol. 
---
CCP is like a drug dealer. It's simply changing the wares depending on customer preferences. Spod, while not as addictive as PvP salt, has greater spreading potential. It's like switching from heroin to weed.
---
Seeing through CCP's shit: so easy a caveholer can do it!
---
CCP has proven they're fucking incapable of "branching out".  They're up to what, 7 failed games on one successful one, while still failing to put money into the successful one?  That's called retardation, not "branching out".
---
Next Event in EVE Online will be the server shut down ceremony
---
Personally I think it's time to raze iceland to the ground and salt the ashes.
---
There are many many people who get in WHs.
---
Sorry, how exactly is having MORE CCP sponsored meets pawning it off on the playerbase?
---
can I have your stuff?
---
To be fair, it is a bit simpler to kit and employ a Carrier that is useful against Battleships AND caps then it is to outfit a Battleship that is useful against Frigates and Battleships.
---
Its more a reflection on the fact that there exists some compelling role based play in this game, but Battleships largely are *Generic damage dealer* and they are heinously outclassed in that by Capitals.
---
Oh thats going to be a clusterfuck 
---
&gt;You claim citadels provide perfect safety, but their safety level is similar to a PoS you had access too.  
---
No. They're more similar to stations. Stations with a POS shield. That you can cyno on top of. That you can immediately dock in. That have a damage cap. Which you can remotely remove assets from via asset safety. Which can be spammed *endlessly* with essentially zero consequence or restriction. They're a lot different than POSes.  
---
  
---
&gt;Name me 1 big war that was not involving some form of BoB and/or Goons (in b4 2006 era Russian stuff).  
---
The eviction of XDeath from the East. I don't even know what the point of this question or statement is either, but whatever. I probably don't get what you're alluding to or why it matters that different people play the game under the same old banners.   
---
Also I have no idea why you even wrote the last two paragraphs so whatever.
---
Clearly they haven't found a way to reverse mouth cancer damage on capsuleers yet.
---
Yeah. It’s was a different era. Was with RISE then Skunkworks. 
---
Then got married, had a kid and wife aggro broke my tank 
---
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!
---
So?
---
The unfortunate thing is this is the way the gaming economy works now. Make a game that whales want to spend shitloads of cash on, keep the game alive JUST long enough to invest in the next shitty game with the same model, and as soon as that one picks up steam, let the old one die a slow death - ad Infinitum.
---
In a way I can’t blame companies for doing this - it’s been basically proven to be the best way to make a profit in today’s gaming atmosphere. It’s easy to take advantage of people’s addictive personalities - and you only need a handful of rich enough players to make it all worth it. 
---
I resent gamers for allowing this to happen though. I want to resent the companies but they’re just doing what earns them the best/easiest profit. That’s how businesses work. They won’t change unless gamers change. 
---
god this is worse than the pgl capital balance post
---
Truly, this is masturbation with sandpaper.  I don't use my main to mine, my miner is ineffective against rats like these.  Ergo, dual box or be damned.  Fuck this and CCP.
---
I wrote some nasty troll replies to this out of fun, but figured they would be taken the wrong way so instead:  
---
I don't really rat or mine.
---
Did you have actual content or argument to make?  I will take it seriously and not troll.

Nova is effectively dead, so they have to have a new project to piss money into.  It's the CCP way.
---
It's only a "dying mmo" because they've spent the last 5 years' profits developing 7 other stillborn games.
---
under fucking rated post, lmao
---
Woow more people liked it then I thought it would awesome!
---
PI is produced in pretty vast quantities, a few things.
---
1. Its fucking easy to do.
---
2. It can PLEX an account monthly + some bonus ISK for whatever .
---
I'm in a 3 man WH Corp, I only run 4 accounts, with only 2 doing PI.
---
My two Corp mates have 8 accounts each, with 3 toons on each all doing PI,  32 toons doing PI total between 2 dudes. A shitton of people do this to plex, no it's not infinite, just over saturated which results in lower cost keepstars.
---
If this happens three more times I will begin to think it's staged.

We didn't make falcon rage quit his shitty job because he failed us more times than we can count.
---
&gt; (I’m fully convinced it’s the management that’s the problem and not the devs) 
---
Unfortunately, I think it's kinda both.  Most of the talent left long ago because between below-average compensation and having to live on a lifeless Nordic rock, they aren't exactly very attractive for most A-list programmers.  The work they do now (outside of the art department) tends to be absolutely loaded with bugs and programming problems that never seem to get fixed.  Even when they try to fix them, they take like 5 tries to not make it worse than it previously was.
---
Elise ur my good dude and i have this respect for all the work u did for eve
---
its peculiar, to say the least, that u decided to nitpick my comment
---
...we both seen the same schedule spreadsheet
---
how many weeks does a month have?
---
if we say 500 plex is $20, then would you work for $2.5 worth of space pixels per hour?
---
The engine was an absolute failure, so it was broken at its core.  Yeah, it looked good...but it melted GPUs just running one person in a tiny room.  Imagine trying to run an actual MMO in that engine.  It would be unplayable, and I'm pretty sure that had a lot to do with the scrapping.
---
Focus groups. 
---
Amazing work OP. 
---
sigh... you sir, are not wrong
---
i would say that I do not play it. I ship spin 95% of the time running indy jobs and undock to move shit around.
---
If they threw even 5 more developers at Eve and made clear that they were diving full on into tackling some balance issues, building community events (AT, in-game roleplay events, new seasonal event types)....
---
They could deadass ask the Eve Playerbase to make all the videos, promotional materials, etc. etc. for EVE, and we would probably do it.
---
&lt;dusts off Atari Jaguar &gt;
---
The last Blood raider event was my last. So much mining for so little ore. 
---
&gt;The Eviction of XDeath  
---
So we usin WH terms for nullsec now?  Out with the old renters in  with the new?  So hot and dramatic it had stories with bold names like '[Corp Name] Gone'!.  
---
Sure there was interesting aspects of it, and it set precedence, but come on.  When you google "XDeath Eviction eve online"  the top result is "2018 who even is XIX" lmao.  Part of this is localization and such, but also part of it is what I call 'Russian secrecy'.  It is not real secrecy, but its like they undersell their own efforts or something.  I dunno, maybe its the lack of sweet propaganda.   
---
The main point is that people come and reference the 'memorable wars' and to be that, they have to have people remembering them and talking about them.
---
&gt; All that citadel shit  
---
Out of all of that, the docking of capital ships is the only true consideration to the supposed complaint of 'my small fleet is bored'.

AND I would argue that is offset by fatigue motivating capital gate usage, which is now a new and highly used avenue for pvp on both sides.

CSM IS a focus group. And most focus groups in the world have NDAs.

So still subbed. Nice

I’m one of those people whose best times in Eve were 10+ years ago and I find that it’s very rare for Eve players of today to even have heard of the groups you mentioned.
---
Camping alliance stagers and fighting their response fleets in Burn Eden was the most fun pvp ever. The k:d ratios were so strong we’d sit on comms after each deployment and argue over percentages of the loot splits of a fortune, even by today’s standards.
---
There _are_ many groups making a name for themselves with very impressive pvp skills, usually living out of wormholes will null statics these days. But when they find a juicy gank or a good fight, the party tends to be over once that cyno goes up and the supers and faxes appear.
---
Eager to hear more about this from Eve's community team at this year's fanfest... wait...
---
LOL, i will link the vid to annyone asking me about eve :)
---
Remind me again the argument against resources shifting through the cluster? The idea would be that the huge entities would go around steamrollering the small ones? Still, this game needs CONFLICT above all else. I still feel like a rotating set of spiral arms of different resources would shake everything and everyone up. When you combine that with gameplay that favours settling down then it makes an interesting mix I think. Small entities could set up shop and 'wait their turn' and try to bear the brunt of the onslaught as their area of space becomes filled with the best minerals for a short while.

poor guy has to start botting again for a new one :(
---
I believe you mean the pilot experienced desync and FW bots that have been left unchecked by CCP accidentally tackled him when the server missed a tick and a bug that caused a module to spontaneously eject into space caused the ship to fall below it's hull limits and collapse into itself and spawned a second PL wormhole generator.

Hi guys, questions about C5 Wormhole farming with a revelation.
---
Do you just use Haw guns or do you switch to cap guns to kill battleships?
---
Do you just warp to 0 on the site or create bookmarks or something else?
---
Do you kill everything in the site or just the battleships and triggers?
---
What kind of reps per second do you need? Any suggested fits?
---
I currently have a decent fit T2 haw Rev, and i wanna get some extra money to move some characters into wormholes permanently.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Each and every loss that I failed to learn from.

Maybe it’s dying because they’ve spend years investing in failing ideas rather than their one successful project.
---
My first Worm. I built him to be able to run all of the DED sites in high sec, pretty shiny. Had him for years. 
---
One day I was running the Gallente career missions for standings (the ones meant for brand new players). One of those missions is meant to teach you that losing your ship is no big deal and tells you that your ship will be destroyed, if you read the mission description, only noobs read those. I lost my favorite little ship that day. His name was Jim. 
---
an unfit carrier in providence. Got takled by one frigate. Activated self destruct because i thought that would deny him a killmail. Didn't call for help because i was ashamed.

That applies to hyperspatials, not overdrives though.

---
Jup. I get the idea of branching out... And it might be the best for ppl who can do it. But CCP gotta accept they re a one-trick-pony and instead of failing at learning a second trick they d likely better be the best one-trick-pony there is. But who am I to judge such delicate topics... vOv
---
Yeah, every so often I check out the launcher (I don't actually play anymore) and it's just... awful. I don't believe they put any design or user experience resources into it.
---
Revenant, but not relevant 
---
But it still does well, so, ehm, its not entirely useless ;)
---
I fear they actually did put in all of the creative ressources they got left. Scary.
---
Again, great video! I wish my laptop could handle recording :(

You're retarded
---
Csm is a group. They don't have focus tho and we saw that when they rolled out hic changes. You could make a point that it's a nullsec focus group.
---
The t3d and cap focus groups didn't have nda as far as i remember and discussions were shqred with everyone while only the members could apeak in the grouop.
---
&gt; The AT and other big EvE gatherings are the biggest factor in the degradation of conflicts leaving us with safe spaces in Null and prearranged encounters becoming the norm.
---
Lol. AT was one of the mere venues where you could earn some value with skill and prowess, instead of multiboxed anomaly pve in safe spaces. Mittens or whoever Goon CSM that was , he was probably upset because this was a thing.
---
better offline your MWD when these dudes are behind you, dont wanna get caught w/ that fitted and online 
---
most of the pvp'ers I know where above and beyond the biggest krabs , max min production, mining, ratting everything.
---
if anything people grew up, most people just dont have time to eve 8+ hours day, 
---
&gt;You just linked me some shit from 2010-2015 about BoB and Goon remnants doing war, like I said.
---
Lmao, just as predicted, bet you think nc. is bob remnants too
---
Also the edit was for formatting ya fucking mong, it was done before you even replied. 
---
&gt;whatever your first paragraph said  
---
simple question, simple answer. i don't give a fuck if you can google it you mongoloid, it happened, and it was a major war. would you prefer if i used the word "ousting" oh wait nobody cares.  
---
&gt;your absolutely retarded second paragraph  
---
that wasn't the point of my brief response. you said citadels were like POSes. specifically this is what you said:
---
&gt;Structure Safety - This is a false argument. You claim citadels provide perfect safety, but their safety level is similar to a PoS you had access too. They prevent undock shenanigans ala stations, but otherwise are very similar to PoS, especially post Cyno-tether change.  
---
nobody said anything about "my small fleet is bored". i'm specifically replying to you. citadels are unlike POSes. they are significantly different than POSes. i don't know how to make it any simpler for you.  
---
fatigue only increases gate use during fleet travel. nobody just fucking gates it because they have an orange timer. they tether and wait it out. maybe you're talking about jump range nerf, which is definitely a huge reason for capital gate jumps. but i honestly don't think anyone knows what you're talking about at all.  
---
&gt;ALSO can we just all agree that tether is better than no tether? Did you want to have to insta-undock every fleet just to not get ass fucked by AOE damage like boson titans? Because I sure know a group with a lot of boson titans who like to use them... (insert Bombs/Supers/Smartbombs for titan as req)  
---
i would actually respond to this but i just want you to realize you just asserted that you need tethering because of station undock smartbomb camps, and you earlier questioned some other posters on mechanical knowledge. just consider for a second how sincerely dumb you are. thanks. 
---
It's PS-9 :)
---
You do realise that the United States is also rather close to Iceland, right?
---
I honestly thought people loved AT. Frankly surprised people have said otherwise.

Don't make me feel bad for you guys now.

But what if joe casual who decided to play fortnite for a few weeks isnt around to play eve and save his 5 titans???

Back in the day people used to move their stuff to npc space. Or they just lost it because you know, eve was hard.
---
As someone who really enjoyed participating in the AT, I really am disappointed that CCP decided to just scrap it. I don't actually play EVE anymore due to my style of gameplay being almost destroyed but i was looking forward to flying in the tournament again, just a huge bummer.

EVE needs to die so that the other game can have an opportunity.
---
Momentum.
---
Gamers are not changing. They're getting worse. 
---
Remember all those people who cancelled their subs over the microtransactions in "protest"? In doing so, they all voted with their wallet, right? 
---
... What they may not have realized was that this is not the age of the Jita riots of old, where our subscriptions were CCP's main source of revenue.
---
If a game is funded less by subscriptions, it will be redesigned to encourage more funding from the whales who ARE paying. 
---
Ergo:
---
**Unsubscribing from EVE votes for MORE frustration-based microtransaction-encouraging game design.**
---
This might sound backwards, but if we want the game to be less about rich whale players and more about, well, the whole game as a totality, we have to get as many players as possible to subscribe and pay monthly, and resist the urge to buy PLEX. 
---
For the good of the universe.
---
yikes
---
Did you even read the context or are you just actually that stupid? The entire point is people come here regardless of what rules or policies we set. You have absolutely no clue what goes on. The new group has people actually trained with this sort of thing. Literal professionals in the field. But don't worry - you're obviously brilliantly educated opinion that can't be bothered to read the damn thread before spewing garbage is probably the one I should trust.
---
By your logic we should tell people who refuse any form of referral we give them who are dealing with suicide to effectively go fuck themselves. Great idea. Let's let those people sit behind a spam filter with 0 communication vs. simply referring them to people who are better equipped to deal with that sort of thing. 
---
Here's the literal situations we deal with since you can't be fucked to read the rest of the thread:
---
1: Person comes in threatening suicide and demands the B4R process  
---
2: You provide them links to suicide prevention numbers staffed by professionals  
---
3: They lash out at you for denying them the thing they feel they desperately need. Or worse yet - they never respond again after posting some legitimately harrowing shit. On accounts that are active daily. For years. Every single thing you can see about them goes dark, all at once. 
---
That's the actual situation. You have no idea what B4R even is or the history of subreddit with them or even my own history with B4R because you are so grossly off base that it's honestly shocking. Hint: It's not some randoms on a discord. It's a legitimate legal charity known as Spam4heals that both has and receives help from professionals. If people who are threatening to kill themselves post a thread you have exactly 3 choices. No more, no less.
---
1: Send them only the suicide prevention hotlines  
---
2: Remove and completely ignore them  
---
3: Send them both suicide hotlines and the actual B4R group while informing them that they can be helped much more rapidly on their discord server.  
---
I'm not playing with lives here - you are with your stupid fucking opinion.
---
yes
---
finally we have time to play others games. eve servers offline before christmas.

The biggest mistake CCP can do is release another game it will kill eve and the people who do play the new game will end up quitting. They’d just end up with nothing.

---
The price is actually 10% lower for the same amount of PLEX as before they just decided to cross out the free PLEX line for some unknown reason. 
---
This is not even addressing the biggest elephant in the room. The lifeblood of everything that happens... the economic balance. The out of control ISK injection that ratting in nullsec from bounties represents. The stockpiles of billions of tons of ore, moon goo, and PI that the nullsec empires are sitting on, and mining more of in record numbers, and carefully controlling the supply of to gain full control of the T2 market. The devaluation of the ISK.
---
Yesterday I watched a guy with a HAW Titan, perfectly applying to cruiser rats in a Haven, then Boson'ing the shit out of the entire site, then in come his five Rorq alts to further strip mine everything in the site, and in comes them dank ticks. In perfect safety, under a super umbrella. He barely finished the site, and another site spawned for him to hoover. No risk, full reward. No subcap fleet (or even small gang cap fleet) can even get close or even if they did and engaged him, he just lights his cyno, and in comes dozens of bored alliance/coalition supers and kills everything. Everyone knows this. So they don't even try. PVP for the small gang in null is dead. PVP for wormholers roaming into null connections is dead. N+1 has reached its ultimate form. This isn't an ISK faucet, it's an ISK waterfall.
---
There are no more reasonable means to steer the economy back into competitive health. Only unreasonable draconian measures from CCP can work now:
---
1. Introduce Mineral/PI/Moon goo Denaturation - apply a time algorithm to every unit of resource - you don't use that stockpile of robotics - it'll sit in its warehouse and eventually rust. That mineral stockpile will decompose if it sits too long. The moon goo will deteriorate with time. The decay rate can be adjusted and is another tool of balance that CCP can use.
---
2. The Triglavians are sick of our incursions into their space, and unleash a superweapon onto New Eden that propagates throughout the cluster. Jump Drives can no longer function without the ship blowing itself up due to the interference. The only form of Jump Drive that still works due to its technobabble use of a different frequency or domain of subspace, are those on Black Ops battleships and the jump drives on Freighters.
---
3. The Concord call centre is sick of the endless pings of capsuleers demanding bounty for killing pirates, and changes the way rewards for busting pirate scum works. "Bring us physical proof." (Nullsec rats now drop a "random color" loot, that they have to physically bring to Concord stations in hisec to get the ISK bounty)  
---
4. Asset safety fee is 100% tied to the market value. Concord Officer: "Oh you can get your stuff back, got it out in just the nick of time, risked my non-immortal neck to do it, let me just check the market price. good, that'll be xy billion to get all your ships and cargo contents back." Boom, a significant ISK Sink.
---
The point is that the balance between destruction and creation in EVE is titling increasingly towards creation. The balance between risk and reward is almost firmly in reward's corner. There is no more **consequence** in the game worth writing home about - the very thing that was famously touted in the past as a major selling point of EVE, is gone.
---
You can have some stuff yes.
---
Yes, I am absolutely certain of this decision !
---
You forgot the magic word
---
Why, though
---
There's no point taking fights that you have a 100% chance of losing without even breaking an enemy ship's shields. Sure if it's a decently fair fight then go for it but he has no obligation to suicide into an enemy fleet for no reason.
---
you still gota blue nc. etc
---
Plenty of reasons. In brief, just kinda done with the way CCP is managing the game. 
---
That's what we get when the csm is only a ccp mouthpiece. 
---
&lt;3. Good luck out there man, no matter what CCP does I'm not sure I could ever fully leave Eve (just had my 5 year anniversary of playing). Not unless something better came to take its place. 
---
my initial $20 sub i spent buying the game in 2006
---
Just broke the 4-years barrier myself, figured it was a good time to go. 
---
Premium quality shitpost
---
Why the uproar about there being no AT this year. Not saying they should've cancelled it for 2019, but I don't see why several people say that they're stopping their subs. I'd imagine most of those people just watch it anyways.
---
However if we're to riot or whatever, why don't we wait and see how things play out. They're cancelling it this year to work on the game itself. Let's see if this is going somewhere first. Not that the AT would stop them from doing this, but I'll accept no AT this year if we see a lot of changes. But 100%, they should bring it back + do these changes. If not, feel free to go apeshit.
---
Docking request accepted.
---
This is yet more evidence that CCP management is beyond shit. That fucking request for talent isn't even well written. It's full of catch phrases and nonsense. Most of the people reading this reddit can apply and would probably do a better job.  
---
So this is the first guy to get fired then?
---
Thanks bud, sorry you're leaving :(
---
Send some to horaculus Riven infame please :)
---
Game is trash.

Nothing matters.

CCP doesn't care.

I have to say, I honestly feel really great now, like a weight out of my shoulders 
---
Now they got axed unironically a month or two after it was made.

Will do :)

The AT inspired me to mine billions of tons of ore (daily)

I can tell you how those fails came after worldwarbee. 
---
Everyone who posed a threat to the goons was banned. Iwi was perfectly fine rmting untill they messed with the goons. As soon as that happened boom banned. 
---
Funded by Eve players, again.
---
because they suck
---
The CSM does not have final say in ANY changes. And neither did any specialized focus groups either. They give their opinion, then CCP decides what to do from there. That is the same for all player groups in the history of Eve.
---
The non-NDA point I was making was concerning pretty much any focus group out there, not just those involving CCP.
---
我只是谷歌翻译这个所以有很好的lols。你有没有听说过没有低污染的门？所以你知道人们可以在这里拥有的这个广阔的空间里建立新的公司和联盟。而不只是加入一些大集团。
---
I foresee Eve Battle Royale. It will be perfect, you float around an asteroid belt with 100 other players, in between ships and cans with modules, the occasional mobile depot etc.
---
CCP, this is current best money printer.
---
10 years of life - if this count. 
---
Speaking the truth 
---
o7, see you in a few years.... hopefully. ;)
---
How are they broken? AT ships aren't relevent in terms of their stats to anything that isn't a 1v1 or the alliance tournament. It's not like winning prize ships gives you any kind of direct strategic advantage. The advantage comes from ISK of them to collectors or AT teams. 
---
The price of AT ships mostly comes from their value to collectors and the potential to leverage them in future alliance tournaments to win more ships. Not because of ingame power. 
---
It's incredibly hard to win the alliance tournament, it takes extreme dedication from dozens of hours of tests weekly, you need talented pilots who know how to function on a competitive team and be able to take criticism and strive to be the best, you need excellent theorycrafters and the highest level of small gang knowledge,  you need to be able to read the meta, review opponents, get in their heads and understand the banning meta. Deep pockets not quite mandatory but a big advantage.
---
I think AT ships are awesome because they're rare collectables that give people long term goals in the game, and promote the highest level of competition.
---
IDK why you seem to think real life eve meets are what is causing stagnation in the game, and not Rorquals/Supers but ok. 
---
I hope you find what you're looking for in other games. Fly safe! 
---
You can ! (Just give me your ig name)
---
Just fyi your “lowsec gate to stain” translated into “low pollution door”.
---
More like IRL than in games...
---
Oh snap
---
I have yet to see an actual participant quit over this.
---
hey op if anyone cared they could find out what system you're in in like 5 minutes, so don't bother blocking out all that shit next time
---
&gt;They give their opinion, then CCP decides what to do from there.
---
If macroeconomics of eve are discussed who can gove an opinion?
---
If api use is discussed who can give an opinion?
---
If fw systems bonus is discussed who can gove an opinion?
---
If large scale production is discussed who can gove an opinion?
---
If spfarms are discussed who can give an opinion?
---
And so on. 
---
You'll see that at best none of them can give an opinion and at worst just one person is feeding back info to ccp where no one else can disagree because simply they don't know. 
---
Sarcasm?
---
Translate back to Eng from Chinese:  
---
I' m just google translating this so lols. Have you ever heard about non-low pollution gate? so you know people can have big open space to build up corporation and alliance. And not to join some big group 
---
Well in whatever you end up doing then :) 
---
&gt;Wow almost like I was making a point about how bad your position was. You had a problem with your own answer when it affected you. You're a hypocrite.
---
As I said, I am fine if it has a warning, a counter and a way to avoid it. You are a retard that can't read what I've written. You are also a major retard for trying to create an equivalence between one-button-kill for every ship in space out of nowhere and without warning and the current capital umbrella. That's hilarious btw and the epitome of retardism. 
---
It only underlines how your agend is nothing but to kill PvE players, just like any self proclaimed elite pvper. 
---
&gt;Almost like how current mechanics make roaming less appealing due to the further favoritism for krabs.
---
except that your argument isn't supported by numbers. More krabs in Space leads to more PvP is underlined by the numbers from the MER's since November 2016. That's 2 1/2 years of evidence raping your arguments throat with it's humongous dick. 
---
Removing local without compensation for the now increased risk =&gt; less PvE in Space, less PvP in space. That's the basis I've established and you didn't manage to find a conclusion to the numbers that makes sense and that suggests otherwise. 
---
All you have is "Make belief" that with less PvE'ers in Space due to higher risk will lead to more activity in space. MER's also have the numbers against that if you check out the times The north / Kalevala were camped to hell. 
---
&gt;Limited local doesn't just affect krabs, it affects everyone.
---
i Agree it affects everyone, not just to the same extent. For a PvP'er, it's convenience. For PvE'ers, it's the last line of defense they have to avoid certain death by gank. 
---
&gt;It's the "most active" because it's the most populated area. If those Goons were roaming instead of PvEing there would still be content.
---
We are already having fun fleets (i.e. not strategic) ops day in and day out and day in and day out. Without the wealth delve allows, you wouldn't have that. Less money = less wealth = less ships people comit. 
---
It's the same for you too - granted, you are one of the most extreme cases when you have 50 bil on your wallet while still being unable to bring a single bubble to your roam, but well.. 
---
&gt;Structure grinds are boring. "HURDUR these Huns aren't smashing their horse archers into my castle walls...they must not want to fight us huurrrrrrr"
---
I agree, structure grinds are boring. And? It's a way to provoke fights and fights is what you want, right? Maybe stop whining like a little cunt when you have to do something you might not like in order to get what you like. 
---
&gt;But if people don't grind my Keepstar they don't REALLY want pvp hurrrrr.
---
it's actually a "If you don't provoke fights than you aren't interested in them", and there are numerous proofs for the fact that you aren't interested in fights. 
---
This is just one major point. You can provoke fights, yet you refuse to do so. IF your only goal would be to have more fights without PvE'ers involved, then you would focus on options that don't involve krabs. 
---
Instead, you focus on the one thing that isn't a N+1 advantage that is beneficial to crabs. The one inherent advantage to have. No, it's not just an oppinion, it's your actions that speak louder than the garbage that your mouth forms. 
---
&gt;What tools specifically favor attackers just like things like panic modules, citadels, alliance gates, toggle cyno jammers, favor defenders. Be specific.
---
Which one of these can't be destroyed and are literally unvulnerable? 
---
&gt;I don't care who I kill. You're meat.
---
Yeah, and that's why you aim at Pve'rs, which are by far the easiest meet you can have. :) 
---
&gt;I don't krab and I have 50 bil liquid sitting around.
---
see, I only have 7 bil lying around. Who's more affraid to lose his isk? Is it me or you, mister destroyer that can't afford a sabre? I put my isk into assets - ships mostly and I do own a Nyx and 5 Rorquals which I regularly use. Who do you think exposes his assets more? Me or you?
---
&gt;Because pvpers go out to find fights regardless. Look at FW. Look at lowsec. People still go out to kill stuff.
---
then why would you suggest a change to the game that will disadvantage the people that are already at a disadvantage by default (can't prep for the fight) way more than others? A change that would make space less active and will produce less PvP in the end? 
---
That doesn't make sense. Unless you are a notorious liar with an agenda ofc. 
---
I care

Seriously, I used to live in Kentwood, so saw those Sheriff's cars often. Never knew there was an Eve player among them.

If you're still feeling generous, I've been playing a few months now and would appreciate some isk =). Name is Snoochy Boochies.

Thanks!

ya only a handful of &lt;4 character systems and then just look at station location ez pz
---
A++ title, and a sad but accurate write up. Actual PVP content, i.e. not gank VNIs, is getting harder and harder to come by. When someone does decide to fight it is usually in the form of caps and super caps.
---
Thanks, appreciated
---
send some to gosu lau in game please :) 
---
sad to see you leave.
---
if youre giving stuff our send some to me just fearless
---
The biggest mistake CCP have made is relying solely on Eve for over 15 years.
---
A developer ***CANNOT*** be expected to survive off one single game. That they've managed to survive this long on it alone is a massive fluke from a gamble that by all rights should probably never have succeeded.

Just a few days ago i have lost a vedmak in the abyss due to a bugged modul. Ticket was sent, i recieved an automated message that they do not give a shit. Tried to escalate my ticket, they haven't even answered ever since.
---
I don't know what the deal was, but CCP don't own the licence to WoD any more. I'm pretty sure that was transferred wholesale to Paradox.
---
Paradox, coincidentally, currently have an ARG going on that is looking like it's pointing at a VtM game of some persuasion.
---
You say "unfortunately". 
---
I say "The ARG Paradox are currently running looks like it might be pointing to Bloodlines 2, so ***FUCK THE FUCK YES***."

People who use the word "triggered" in 2019 need to hang. Geezus. Nobody is mad that I know of

I posted this about 6 months ago, I hope it is an RPG in the eve universe maybe set before space travel was reinvented

i don't get it either. Who cares about the AT? How do you get from AT 19 cancelled to eve is dying?

Maybe it’s time to remove entosis and timers on most things, make the space a lot poorer and reward effort even if you are just 40 strong?

Half of r/Eve are people who have long since quit the game but get off memeing it's flaws.  The other half still still cling to their perceived idea of what Eve is -- usually 100% solo or small gang PvP -- and have never bothered to adapt to large corp gameplay so they get off memeing it's flaws. 
---
There exists a few few others that actually play the damn game and have fun doing it only to come in here and post now and then. They are the silent majority because they are playing and not redditing all day.
---
GL bro!
---
a stupid grind fest like every event?
---
Considering the fact that all the games they've tried to make were half assed attempts to quickly produce a photocopy of whatever was the money printer trending at the time (VR, FPS, mobile), I think your guess is right on the money. Only issue is, they're not gonna make any money, cause the game is gonna go down in flames like the ones before it.

Hi, i wish you best of luck. Can I have something too, please? Char: Ddolik
---
Wanting to stop playing because you're dissatisfied: sure, nobody is forcing you.
---
Giving away all your stuff: generous, good for you.
---
Biomassing your character: that's just retarded. This game has been around for 15 years and may yet be here for another 15. You're closing a door that you want to open again someday. I started in 2005 and didn't play for many years. But when I came back I was very glad my character was still there. It gave the feeling of coming home. 
---
delete panic
---
Hello Ymenoa. Can i have some too please! Ingame name is Queen Estoria
---
They moved them to the skin department.
---
Hey, I'd love to get a share, Queen Estoria
---
Oh wow, I admire your dedication. May you find happiness through winning EVE. 
---
Furthermore, if you would be so kind, could you please share the wealth with character 'Linnea Alfar'? Many thanks.
---
&gt;As I said, I am fine if it has a warning, a counter and a way to avoid it. You are a retard that can't read what I've written. You are also a major retard for trying to create an equivalence between one-button-kill for every ship in space out of nowhere and without warning and the current capital umbrella. That's hilarious btw and the epitome of retardism.  
---
&gt;It only underlines how your agenda is nothing but to kill PvE players, just like any self proclaimed elite pvper.
---
Examples are difficult for you to comprehend I guess. I never proclaimed to be an "elite pvper." Simply that krabbing is the safest it has EVER been in the history of Eve.
---
&gt; except that your argument isn't supported by numbers. More krabs in Space leads to more PvP is underlined by the numbers from the MER's since November 2016. That's 2 1/2 years of evidence raping your arguments throat with it's humongous dick. 
---
Again Delve is the most populated region in nullsec. It's not krabbing that makes content, it's population.
---
&gt; Removing local without compensation for the now increased risk =&gt; less PvE in Space, less PvP in space. That's the basis I've established and you didn't manage to find a conclusion to the numbers that makes sense and that suggests otherwise. 
---
Without compensation? The compensation is already here. Citadels, alliance only gates, toggled cyno jammers, Panic Rorqs. These are all tools that favor the krab not the hunter.
---
&gt; i Agree it affects everyone, not just to the same extent. For a PvP'er, it's convenience. For PvE'ers, it's the last line of defense they have to avoid certain death by gank. 
---
Because wittle baby is not safe enough with citadels everywhere, alliance only gates, toggled cyno jammers, Panic Rorqs?
---
&gt; We are already having fun fleets (i.e. not strategic) ops day in and day out and day in and day out. Without the wealth delve allows, you wouldn't have that. Less money = less wealth = less ships people comit. 
---
People have been having fun long before "delve wealth."
---
&gt; It's the same for you too - granted, you are one of the most extreme cases when you have 50 bil on your wallet while still being unable to bring a single bubble to your roam, but well.. 
---
Not really an extreme case. You've just been fed this propaganda by your goon alliance that you have to be in delve to make money. Uncreative tards like you think grinding is the only pathway to wealth. You are low IQ cattle getting milked and you don't even realize it.
---
&gt; I agree, structure grinds are boring. And? It's a way to provoke fights and fights is what you want, right? Maybe stop whining like a little cunt when you have to do something you might not like in order to get what you like. 
---
"If you don't grind structures which btw are over spammed, you must not like pvp." GENIUS IQ TAKE
---
&gt; it's actually a "If you don't provoke fights than you aren't interested in them", and there are numerous proofs for the fact that you aren't interested in fights  
---
But fights are provoked. Often you tackle a rorq to provoke a fight and what you get is a cyno lit, 30 titans pop through with smartbombs and instantly annihilate your entire roaming gang. You don't even have time to fly off. Titas block out the grid.
---
&gt;This is just one major point. You can provoke fights, yet you refuse to do so. IF your only goal would be to have more fights without PvE'ers involved, then you would focus on options that don't involve krabs.  
---
&gt;Instead, you focus on the one thing that isn't a N+1 advantage that is beneficial to crabs. The one inherent advantage to have. No, it's not just an oppinion, it's your actions that speak louder than the garbage that your mouth forms.
---
Again the fights are provoked. The problem is the various safety nets that are provided to krabs. Citadel spam, alliance only gates, cyno jammers, moon mining platforms. With so much protection you still whine about keeping local.
---
&gt; Which one of these can't be destroyed and are literally invulnerable? 
---
It's not that they are invulnerable. It's that they offer many many many layers of protection for defenders and no tools have been given to the attacker as a balance point. I don't know when you started playing but the game as further resorted to farmsville gimmicks of keeping krabs such as yourself safe. Every table corner has been given padding. Which is why the game's been flooded with retards like you.
---
&gt; Yeah, and that's why you aim at Pve'rs, which are by far the easiest meet you can have. :) 
---
You are easy. You're spineless and weak and at the bottom of the food chain. We kill your krabbing ships with a resounding "meh" and then move on. The goal for us is to find people who actually provide a fight. But places like Delve really offer 2 options. Krabs and supercap spam.
---
&gt; see, I only have 7 bil lying around. Who's more affraid to lose his isk? Is it me or you, mister destroyer that can't afford a sabre? I put my isk into assets - ships mostly and I do own a Nyx and 5 Rorquals which I regularly use. Who do you think exposes his assets more? Me or you? 
---
I don't know you're the one crying that you need so many defenses. So I'd say you're the one that's more afraid. So you mine and export rocks. So what?
---
&gt; then why would you suggest a change to the game that will disadvantage the people that are already at a disadvantage by default (can't prep for the fight) way more than others? A change that would make space less active and will produce less PvP in the end? 
---
You're not at a disadvantage by default you imbecile. You are the most pampered protected class in Eve Online. There has NEVER been a time in the history of Eve where krabs had so many defenses and way to protect themselves. Unless you are literally retarded you have no way of losing even your shitty little VNI.
---
&gt; That doesn't make sense. Unless you are a notorious liar with an agenda ofc. 
---

the senshi hawk tournament of smoking marijuana and doing other things good too
---
About small teams like VYDRA, HYDRA, Camels and Tuskers(and possible Volta when they was VoC)
---
Maybe it's happens because big alliances are not interested in "give all the best"-participation. 
---
And maybe because CCP had tunnel vision on "alliance tournament is battle HYDRA vs PL"(before AT13) and "counter HYDRA and their system"(starts from AT9), when they changed rules after AT9 incident, after AT13 and when they understood HYDRA comeback before AT15. (I got the impression)
---
And what we got at the moment - as I think, in sandbox game we got synthetic tournament with strong restrictions in interaction of teams, which confuse the viewers: when they see same setups on field or unexpected/expected boundary-violation, they spam "collusion" in chat and dont understand why battle is continues. %(
---
Connection between participants and viewers is broken. I agree.
---
If we want change situation, as I think, need move away from alliance-component in tournament OR arouse interest of full-power-alliances to participate "on all money", maybe allow to hire AT-pilots or full AT-teams officially. And ofc, try to come back bets maybe in predictions competition form, maybe create compendium system(like dota2 compendiums) with different missions/tasks/quizs, predictions, tournament results and prizes for successful execution.
---
It only remains to wait which way CCP will choose ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Remember there is a drug and an implant too, and also the fact you can heat cap modules forever.
---
Hi mate can I have some please. Just started playing yesterday. Plan is some solo pvp as quick as possible. In game name is Vargo-Host (all one word). Enjoy RL

Saying that CCP has mostly left wormholes untouched after removing capital escalations, and making mjd rattles/nestors/leshaks the only reality... You must be MAD!!!

---
No need to nerf them in this super nice spacefarm simulator.. Better nerf the comat ships  which are used to interrupt the miners 
---
Everyone talking about the Kiki needing a NERF but look at the jag
---
Yup. I warned CCP that as soon Serenity shutted down 2/3 years ago our server would be flooded by bots. But they didn't listen and guess what happened. And with skill injectors it was just easy game for those bots. Also remember Chinese ingame mails for advertising their bot tools. Luckily that didn't stay on for to long because they got insta banned but you can understand how Serenity was.
---
Really amazed me how some Chinese alliances had already a big super/titan fleet in less then a year... 
---
Man it's been too long since I've seen that movie. About time for a re-watch.
---
I think there are a fair number of valid points there - if made in a somewhat verbose way. It would be good to hear a strategic direction, something we've lost since CCP Seagull left. 
---
Ccp says a lot of things. I'll let you in on a secret... It never happens. 
---
Speaking as a wormholer, they have most certainly not left them alone. 
---
They removed Capital escalations, which was the driving force behind a lot of High Class dread brawls that used to happen. C6 space used to be a PvP haven. C2's used to always have day trippers in them. Myrms, Drakes. Nanoribbon drops used to be high in lowclass and they were worth around 5mill each.
---
Frigate holes. Drifters. Collateral Damage.
---
Wormhole space is still where it's at, but to say they've left them well alone is silly.
---
The most important question is, how to nerf rorqs without fucking up the small groups while doing little to the big ones? 
---
Done.
---
Good luck on your future life
---
If you have stuff left and don't know where you can put it, Bimbo Andedare will take your stuff, I would appreciate that a lot, thanks. 
---
Give esacavators light fighter dps along with the mining
---
AT ships don't unbalance the game. They can be killed by a T1 frigate if the person flying them is a special kind of numpty.
---
Not to mention the people buying them already have that kind of cash so it really is a moot point.
---
did your pulse rise above at least 100?
---
If it did, i'd say #worth

---
This is certainly a big issue as far as map real estate goes. EVE's map was made for 200k, not 30k. Solo roams can be disgustingly tedious flying through one empty system after the next.
---
The summer of REE is now the winter of REE, because the shit we raged about didn't actually get fixed, they just promised to fix it.
---
Im not sure guerilla would do the job, KWG was camped by marshy dude for months and the're still there, pandemic horde vanguard dudes were ripping that place apart with supers and they're still there. Unless you're willing to grind through the structures camping doesnt do much, some of the people will stop loging in untill campers are gone.
---
There is far too much space in this game for too small playerbase you can easily navigate through nullsec for quite some time and never see anyone apart from intel bots If CCP would remove half of the nullsec or just populate it with those doomsday-dirifters and made people move around that could make things more interesting. But i guess ccp being understaffed that will never happen and the game will stay stale for quite a lot of time
---
Was fun . Stay safe .
---
Darkislife Zhang in game I would really like some due to recently coming back to the game. Anything would help a lot!!!

Increase Rorqual yield, remove panic invulnerability, increase ore anomaly respawn times 
---
It is like they seriously just have zero vision at all for anything.
---
How many times will we get teh same re-dressed PVE year after year?

CCP at this point just seems creatively bankrupt for several years while they do anything but work on their bread and butter in place of dumb fads like VR or more mobile gaming vomit.

I've said it before and I 'll keep saying it till someone proves me wrong...the MOST unbalance thing in Eve is Goonswarm's (and to a slightly lesser degree Test's) ability to organize and motivate their membership. A few years ago they were down and looking for a new home. Their leadership didn't go on hiatus. They didn't whine about things not being fair. They sat down, looked at the game as it was, and concocted a plan to rise to the top again. And then they set to work implementing that plan.
---
You can nerf Titans to death, you could obliterate Rorquals from the game...it wouldn't matter. Goonswarm and Test would still be running rampant. Kings and Queens may rule the board, Rooks may be devastating and Bishops may be clever, but any real chess player will tell you the game is won or lost by the pawns.
---
Good on you. Winning Eve is a difficult thing to do, especially biomassing and walking away. A year later it's the best decision I made for myself. Best of luck irl. 
---
Excavators are literally the only achilles' heel existing for any kind of capital pve (supers, rorqs, titans, carrier) under heavy supercap umbrellas. They are the only valuable PvE thing under decent risk.
---
Like holy fuck there are retarded topics offering a brain dead solutions to legitimate problems with capitals, that I suspect it's nullsec PvE'rs intentionally trying to obfuscate the discussion and keep capitals OP.

I have a few questions about this:   
---
\- Why did the numbers increase post rorquals? Why is there more destruction or to be more specific: why do you think more destruction is indeed a bad thing for the game?  
---
\- Why aren't the null empires in constant wars, if loss doesn't mean anything anymore? From my Point of View, it's merely a treshold increase in whats considered a "real loss".   
---
Undoubtedly, the game has changed away from catering to small groups/gangs. It's harder for them, I give you that. But that's the nature as you had all the advantages before and CCP merely gave Nullblocs the tools they needed to do what Null is all about: Empire building.   
---
I also think that these issues for small gangs could be resolved, just not by removing every change that happened that was more beneficial to one side. Granted, you could just do that, but with it comes the risk of bleeding players again (as was the case pre-Rorqual).   
---
The main problem for me is that the wealth disparity is ever growing between Null and Lowsec/Empire. When we make 100m to 2 billion isk per hour with our army of rorquals, then we can, naturally, afford much more losses then lowsec inhabitants. Now, you could argue that lowsec has means of getting rich quickly, and those, infact, do exist, but it's not as convenient, repeatably and safe than it in nullsec.   
---
So, I would try the different route of making lowsec a lot more wealthy. How that is to be achieved? Well, I could imagine new and exclusive faction items? Give them some unique value because at the moment, there just isn't any of that in lowsec. The high ISK/Hour activities are tied to LP or MoonMining, but that's simply not enough. They don't have the infrastructure to reap those rewards consistantly.   
---
Lowsec desperately needs something unique of it's own. Something the smaller entities can use to get to a wealth level where they can, at least, somewhat afford to contest nullblocs for their assets.   
---
Right now, the problem is that the smaller entities just don't have the ressources to man up and sting empires and that's why you see so many people arguing against the cap umbrella/rorqual proliferation. They know that the occassional rorqual (or their drones) and the super they can kill every now and then hurts these empires at least a bit (even though the claim that's not the case), but they just can't grind enough meat to overcome the existing stock.   
---
In a sense, Goons breed faster than you can slaughter them because destroying a tank isn't that easy with simple bullets but what can you do if RPG's are just too expensive to afford?  
---
While the tools to dismantle alliances exist (both sides have access to the entire toolkit after all), it's just unaffordable for those that would like to lean up and rise against the nullsec domination.   
---
Yes, CCP screwed up and they need to fix that. However, I don't think the problem is that nullsec is too wealthy, it's just that lowsec is too poor. The changes to rorquals brought positive change (by MER metrics) and reverting them would be risky. However, bringing other securities to a closer level to null (if not higher, WH's?) is desperately needed.   
---
If the most hardened and most wealthy WH entity can't do shit about the nullsec muscle, then that's a considerable problem and I think it could be solved by more ISK, because we all know ISK is the driving factor for the big game. It always was and it will probably always will be.   
---
Biomassing isnt permanent tho...
---
Their biggest mistake was in both not maintaining a high standard for EVE, in addition to wasting countless millions on one failed, cancelled trainwreck after another.
---
It is of course normal for a developer to branch out with other titles, but CCP has been burning the candle at both ends with failure on both sides of the fence.
---
If it’s not already spread too thin niichan thatsthe wronghole would love some

it is tho...
---
There are those who fly more than one trashtier T1 frig and missing the possibility to quickly move between different hangars and cargo bays makes the UI significantly worse. Those, who don't want to use separate icons should simply remove them from Neocom, that's all. 
---
ofcourse it is. i mean future is mobile /S which even Chris Roberts told us back in 2012. ou grrr time flies by ...
---
No pasa nada 
---
IMO what "comptetetive EVE" needs is a ladder and leagues. 
---
I mean having all the matches once per year is fun and all, but what about other 9 months? We now have that abyssal deadspace location that can serve as an arena, let's develop a set of rules, add a "Create team button" in-game to add your own 3x3, 5x5 and 10x10 team and have teams fight like once a month. Teams that get as much points as possible during the season get to the grand final which is AT.
---
This was people that watch AT can form up and try this shit themselve, making them MUCH MORE involved in the process of arena style brawls and it's logic. It near impossible for a common krab to understand wtf is arena AT if he has no tools to try it himself.
---
And yeah, ofc everything else you mentioned.
---
It is not. You can ask CCP to give you the character back.
---
Also, you can fuck up, biomass a second time and they will still revive your character.
---
Third time though, that shit sticks.
---
This is the greatest thing Ive read the entire week, no joke.

If you would have somthing left to spare, I would gladly like to receive some stuff. It would greatly help me out! Wanted to get my own Athanor for while, I still need some ISK and SP for that. :)

To be honest, loss of a player who only logs on during AT is not a very big loss.

Great run on that caedes, props for actually using it that much oh wait...

I think, it's more about today's scalability of multiboxing than the general attitude towards it. Back then, you had to shell out the full ISK price to plex an account, so running 20 windows was a prerogative of turbokrabs with a lot of time on their hands to do the grinding. With skill farming, the number of active accounts is limited only by their owner's hardware and dedication. Even though the net profits from one month of skill training no longer cover the cost of a plex, the maintenance required is still a fraction of what used to be.
---
They really shouldn't do that, that's just stupid. Its a very annoying trend WOW players do - they delete their gear/accounts on twitch/youtube to get views, than quietly ask for them to return their chars...
---
I'll happily take some assets, corpses or anything else. Feel free to contract it to doctor awox :)

"ccp gives fuck all about their opinion''
---
I can only talk about the CSM I was part of and lets just say there were a lot of moments in which CCP was very thankfull for our opinions. Hey cant go into detail but I understand that I might look like they dont care from the outside. 
---
Congrats on finding something better to do than Eve (and committing to it to this extent)! That’s a good thing.
---
That said, if you still have extra stuff to give away, please send some over! And if not, no worries - enjoy your life of freedom from Eve.
---
Its not like its by choice seeing as theyve tried to diversify themselves but because they are actually shit at making games theyve simply been forced to live off of eve.
---
That they continually fuck up eve on the side while burning all of their money is the real mistake.
---
BTW, they were combined even before, under the Inventory icon would you miss it before. So CCP did not make a new, better decision: they just removed the alternative, which makes now operations between hangars and several ship bays a pain. Uff.
---
I like how you think you made a counterpoint but are actually supporting my argument.
---
If one person can steal trillions in the safest region, that means excavators are the only way in which rorquals take some risk even in the safest places. If you wanna nerf rorquals their risk factors are the latest place you start.
---
Coming up with balancing at this point is just wasted.
---
beautiful; unsarcastically glad you've not changed 
---
Lold
---
&gt;ships
---
you mean rorqs?
---
Like floating in your pod through random ships, like the random gun spawns in BR games.
---
Yeah you are correct thanks for correcting me. Although I have some counter points :)
---
C6 space being dead is mostly attributed to QEX and HK or am I mistaken?
---
C2s are still full of daytrippers but ribbon prices certainly didnt help. But ribbon prices are just victims of supply and demand? Not directly CCP's doing? Drifter farming with cits is OP but thats an issue caused as a side effect to citadels. MJD battleships have always been a thing in w-space. 
---
While cap escalations provided plenty of content they where broken af. All ccp needed to do was to prevent the same site being run multiple days in a row, not gut them completely.
---
I was wrong about CCP not changing anything but a good portion of the problems you listed where not directly caused by CCP and the gameplay we enjoyed can still be found now. W-space is still victim to collateral damage from other changes like you said, but no extremely silly changes have been made that make w-space anywhere near as safe or content sparse as null :)
---
You mean I bought a BBC Micro for nothing?

Why can’t we get AT ships for Free one of each kind for free per Account?

---
Having spoke to a Dev there does exist a 1% in Eve that contributes to something like 25% of the income subscription.
---
I asked, what are the whales buying in game? He replied cryptically that CCP makes a lot from whales buying alliance support and infastructure. So I took that as Bridge titans, jump freighters and structures alongside the alt accounts used to run.
---
&gt; Interesting, I've never ran into LR titans, mostly bosons and/or HAWs. What would a viable nerf be for these, in your opinion?
---
removing titans from the game
---
I'm jumping on this train as well. Extracted my 190m sp and 110m sp alts. Thankfully I play with Plex so those accounts will lapse in the next few days rather than having paid a multiple month subscription. 
---
I feel like this is the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of people.
---
For me it was more the way they said it than what they actually did. "Taking a short hiatus from AT but also return, gonna focus on balance instead!" Yea right, go fuck yourself.
---
CCP are the biggest bunch of incompetent ass clowns I've ever experienced in a game and they don't deserve any more of my time or money. I honestly hope they go bankrupt.
---
Think about all the moronic shit they've pushed through without any thought then left in the game to rot away at the playerbase for months or even years;
---
-months of citadels being able to smartbomb on gates
---
-a year of the svipul being downright oppressive to every ship smaller than a cruiser
---
-Over a year of 40km hic scrams making gate camps unsurpassable
---
-multiple years of autocannons being completely useless
---
-a year of the 10k/s hics with travel ceptor agility, then removing the module finally but completely shafting wormholes for months afterwards by not introducing a new mechanic to roll with then having the sheer audacity to say "we know we're fucking wormholers, but we wanted to get this fixed as soon as possible"
---
And that's just the stuff that immediately comes to mind, ignoring the straight aids that is this retarded capital rework that hasade the game do its final circles of the drain.
---
Go fuck yourself CCP you useless cunts.
---
Haven't played for a few years but what happened to PLEX? Used to be 1 for like  $20
---
its called project legion and it might get a real name anytime soooooonish
---
Send some to Yumi Iku in game please if you've got any extra you still wanna give away! :)

---
If you have actually stolen trillions (which I doubt btw), then there is nothing wrong with them, the system would appear to work.
---
ooh gimme some stuff! 
---
It was more incompetence than malice, there were some items that were genuinely cheaper than pre sale, but for some stupid reason they couldn't do that without putting everything on sale
---
Do you remember the "all skins on all ships"-thing a couple of years ago? About the lore of the ships and skins...yeah?
---
...good job CCP not messing with the lore. Your lore is a stable construct with no flaws and fuckups.
---
Petrified wood, for sure. 
---
I waited for almost a week for my blinged out golem to get shipped to null... got to fly it for about twenty minutes before I got blown up. Haven’t played much since then.
---
I don't, and I did.  
---
Also, make the sites either  be a permanent fixture in space like frostline, one per constellation
---
Or have them 1 per system
---
And regarding the agency rewards, let the accelerators there just drop. Unlocking a crate, to get a bleuprint that needs ore, random pi, and even mor random stuff is a pretty negative feedback loop when you start the event.
---
Events should be fun and rewarding. Perhaps taking a step back and reevaluating why people run them is a good thing to do.
---
Make Bombers do increased damage to capitals and exponentially increased damage to super caps. Fix the scaling on fighter damage per ship size.
---

Argh! I have just come back to Eve!  If you could see it in your heart to help out I fellow pod pilot I would be indebted to you (Krollin is open to receiving financial benefits to feed his ship habit!).

Good luck and thank you for all your contributions.

Now, lets just role EVE back to 2011 and all will be right with the world :)

Blaming the customers for shitty business model for the past years who only profit a rejected skin draft CEO. You wanna blame someone for all the bots, rmt and whale meta business model? Blame the ones behind all the changes. Not the customers because they don't wanna invest more money in a shitty company who has been proven to invest in some the worst ideas who never work and never invest enough on the game that worked for the past 15 years and actually kept them alive as a company. 
---
God driveby DD’s used to be so fucking cool too. People would post videos sniping a dread in a move op with their rag with a clean getaway and were lauded as wild-eyed adrenaline junkies with more KMs than sense.
---
Now using an unsupported titan in combat makes you wealthy and rather dull, “unsupported” is a laughable concept.

Oh man, glorious

why not just sell them for nuPLEX?

ah glad to see CCP didnt change a slight bit since im gone :)
---
^^^^imnotsayingitoldyousobutifuckingtoldyouso
---
Because we couldn’t argue with it at the time. The only way to get people to use citadels was to give them the same features as stations. That MUST include “I can go afk and my stuff doesn’t explode” or they would see scant usage. They should have nerfed conquerable stations, you lose docking rights you lose everything except your active ship if you’re docked there. Then citadels doing the same would have been an easier pill to swallow. 
---
That's really stupid
---
For a game where people constantly talk about the consequences of losing stuff, literally choosing to delete your character out of rage should be final barring true accidents and account takeovers/hacks
---
Recently start up again after a 10 year break, interested in trying faction warfare before committing to omega. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks Ymenoa_merent.

When QEX, HK and LZHKs went on their C6 rampage, we had already seen the C6 holes starting to leave. In No Holes barred we had already seen people starting to leave. Arctic Light, SSC, EXHALE, Dissavowed etc etc. Many more C6 groups that were going down to C5 and C4. Some left w-space all together. Frigate holes didn't help that fact (cheers chitsa, twat).
---
I agree they needed to sort out the ISK printing issue, but lets face it, when a site despawns in Null, it reappears again instantly in system. They constantly rinse and repeat. Not killing that last trigger, was our way of 'keeping up'. Not saying it was good or anything. But it kept the Caps in C6, it kept the fights happening. I remember many a time we ran into farming groups and it led to the best Cap brawls I've ever had. Dread, Triage Carrier, Bhaals and a fuck tonne of HAM and Neut Legions with Guards and an ECMgu. Man I miss those fights.
---
I honestly don't find many daytrippers in wormhole space anymore, sad to say. And when I do, they're often two week old Gnosis pilots with a fit that makes people cry. Don't get me wrong, I help them and give pointers. But gone are the days of Drake's and Myrms daytripping in every hole they can...
---
Side note here, the Abyssal sites and Incursions have pretty much killed this. Why run a C2 site with maximum risk and next to no reward, seriously, 25mill for a single C2 site with loot and salvage... Wtf, when you can just hop into an incursion and make 150-200mill in incursions with no risk and 400 mill in Abyssal sites in a shit fit Gila... (sorry, I'm a little bit sour).
---
But yeah, it is partly our fault as players. But it's direct fallout from CCPs changes.
---
Honestly, we will never see the Golden Era of wormholes again I don't think. The people that made that happen have all left the game, no one really wants to make Eve a second job. Would I, given the opportunity, move the corp I'm currently in to a C6 C6 in the hopes of getting them back to a PvP haven, sure I would. But others would need to do the same. A lot of fights these days in high class consist of 'Fight?' and we tend not to do pre arranged fights.
---
I dunno, I guess I'm just a little bit 'meh' over how wormholes have shrunk over the years. Still love them though. Still epic fights to be had, still major players in wormholes. Just wish there was more. 
---
Yeah. I couldn't remember if it was a straight sale or something else, is all. I'm just happy Paradox seem to be wasting no time in putting it to use.
---
I remember flying against FIX back in 05 or  06  and then flying alongside not long after..
---
If you enter a Wormhole, exploration sites there are usually better. However, they're much more hostile, too.
---
Other than that, in normal K-space, there aren't really any shortcuts to exploration other than making sure your skills and ship + mods are as good as they can be.
---
expected King Voodoo lossmail, was left disapointed
---
he propably forgot the atron too, and that killed him :3
---
why is there no ship in the "old" picture?
---
Reminder: when you use skill extractors, you're consuming PLEX just like you would if you subbed. I know it feels different to *you,* but to CCP it's just paid player activity vindicating their current strategy.
---
Same I have an alt that's cooking for a fax but I might just stop it's plexing. The game's not what it used to be where supers and titans were the pinnacle of an alliance. Nowadays having a super/titan is nothing. I blame Roquals and skill injectors for that. Why injectors? Because they actively help botting accounts being created. And Roqs? Well lets just say that normally it took a day to mine enough ore to build a single cap with a couple mining alts. Now you can stamp out multiple dreads and carriers a day. 
---
I think this game needs an genocide event... to thin out the population, assets and wealth. 
---
I thought this was an Eve Onion post when I saw the title
---
You know by "extracting" a month of perfect skilling you are sinking almost as much plex as a month sub is worth. 
---
I still have some of the eon magazines in a box somewhere.
---
Was the first game I really threw myself into.joined a corp and met a great group of like-minded  adults.. evening roams that lasted into the early hours were fine as their was always such a great attitude from everyone..do miss those days..
---
you can be the special guest referee

Its a backdoor when shit hits the fan with EVE. Good(?) news is they have to keep EVE alive somehow untill that shits finished.

Try albion online for a change :)
---
Good luck finding a game to replace EVE.
---
Haven't pulled this trigger myself but am getting close, because of all the pay-to-cheat bullshit getting added. 
---
No, the effect isn't temporary. As long as you're scrammed -- either by a HIC or a regular scram -- your MWD will be disabled.
---
It's possible you drifted out of the HIC's range, which is about 15 km for a T1 Warp Disruption Field Generator with a Focused Warp Scrambling Script. If you were still seeing the HIC's WDFG icon above your cap display, it's possible he had a second WDFG fit with a Focused Warp Disruption Script, which has a T1 range of about 28 km. Or maybe he switched from one script to the other, and lost the scram in the process.
---
the "big reveal" ...it could work if you retain momentum and use it as an evangelism approach. It's used by Google/Microsoft/Adobe, but they always hinge it off a "main event" and then use the tours to reinforce the messaging.
---
They haven't done this yet, so i'm not convinced they have that stacked as the strategy?..
---
So imagine if they put all the resources of the wasted games into Eve
---
Get well mate! Sounds terrible :/
---
Eve 2.0 with bdo graffics funded by pearl abyss. Naaah just kidding. 
---
PLEX \*always\* has to be purchased for real money first, by someone, somewhere.
---
Only after that can it be sold in-game for isk.
---
So, if more players decide they want to buy PLEX in-game instead of paying real money for it, prices go up.
---
In addition, Eve has a built-in form of inflation. More isk in the economy tends to push all prices up, over time, in the absence of things like balancing passes, special "promotions," hugely destructive wars, and so on.
---
If this game is still around in 15 years I'll literally have a heart attack.  Hell, with current CCP, if it's around in 5 years I'll probably go into cardiac arrest.
---
~~~ EVE FOREVER^^^^^^^^not ^^^^^^^^getting ^^^^^^^^fixed ~~~

Thanks for the in depth reply, I learnt plenty :) I left w-space for a bit and tried most other areas of eve and w-space is still always my fallback plan. It just feels like the part of eve that is still eve.
---
I want cat ears, cat eyes, cat whiskers and cat paws. Maybe tails too and all that with tiddies. 
---
If they put that in the game and I had some sort of reason to even plex if not sub then I'd actually buy that shit. For reals. I think it'd be hillarious to blow someone up while flying in something like this.
---
Sad to hear your that but I can totally understand your decision.
---
Alright now the question, would you share some of your leftover wealth with me please? :)
---
Nobody gives a shit about Goons and Test except Goons and Test. There's a small group of people on here who are convinced that every grievance with the game is just jealousy over how awesome they've been at recruiting everyone with a pulse to grind supers that practically fly themselves. 
---
Yeah great job at reading the meta and exploiting it to the fullest. Sincerely, great job, it's very impressive. Now fuck off and let us change this garbage. Afterwards people will find a new meta to game and when that gets out of control we can change that too. That's how you keep a game fresh and evolving, not stagnant and boring.
---
&gt; unsubscribe
---
Yep. If player numbers are going down and CCP's profitability is at risk investors will panic. It's going to have the same effect as EA's stock crash in 2018, force a decision on the higher ups in the company: either go quietly down into the night or get back to improving their product.
---
Most sane people wouldn't go quietly if they have any passion left in them, see EA's 180 with Apex Legends: legit f2p with absolutely fabulous gameplay and replayability (although with the instability of the client being a symptom of what I presume ginormounts ammounts of rushing the thing out). And would you look at that, people actually LIKE AN EA PRODUCT like wtf, I didn't think I'd be saying that ever.
---
One can only hope CCP would make similar moves when facing disaster.
---
But I thought you didn't like it when goons came last time. Now you want time to live.
---
Just accept the game as it is now either adapt or die and quit the game
---
If you're in highsec and want to stay there, work toward being able to fly incursions (skills, ships, implants).
---
If incursions don't appeal, then find a decent corp and move to null. Start by doing ratting in a VNI, and work your way up to a carrier from there, pvp'ing for fun along the way. FWIW, PI is also much better in null than in highsec or lowsec.
---
A big nullsec group coming in and turbo blobbing a group has never not been a risk, but you will find most groups will not change how they live because of it.
---
Thank fuck cancer like you has left the game, hopefully you stop visiting here with your two brain cells as well
---
Valkyrie was actually OK, what killed it is that they made it only for VR. By the the time they switched it to PC it was too little too late.
---
If they started it on PC and tied it to Eve somehow, even externally, like for example instead of flying some missions within Eve, fly them in Valkyrie but pick up your ISK / LP in Eve, or something like that, it would have been fine and still going strong. But they fucked up and went with VR.
---
I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings at some point?
---
Probably around the same time they make armor Crystals.
---
How can you blame anything other than time? Eventually it was always going to come to this whether we liked it or not. Over time people train, save and purchase bigger and better ships. 
---
Don't get me wrong, it is. Hell it's the only place I play any more. 
---
I am sure people will have different memories and opinions of it that I will, but that's just how I remember it. Still the best space. 
---
Well one can only hope, seems you are still holding on
---
Limit it to one citadel per constellation in nullsec. Has to be designated during anchoring, have to unanchor the old one before you can reassign it which triggers asset safety for everything inside. Everyone gets a safe place to store their stuff while the rest of the citadels in the constellation trade safety for convenience. 
---
Too much lately, actually. We've had a week or so of two major StratOps a day that pretty much shuts down any industry, krabbing, etc. for the hours those go on.  Normally we get Goons coming with mid-size fleets multiple times a day. We still get those. Add to that SkillU taking a new interest and likely Frat as well as soon as they run out their NIP.  We had a couple months of relative quiet after the summer war with the north but for the last few weeks it has been extremely busy.  This is all just what comes to us (except stratops) so if we get bored we can always find some friends to go on a roam with at a moment's notice or join in wormhole diving fleets.
---
Gotta love the feeling of that first reward, a crate, with blueprints... And all the random ingredients
---
Congrats! Good luck in whatever you choose to do next.
---
Rorqs and VNIs or Gilas use up the plex that is bought then sold off in large quantities, they are very much a part of this equation. Also there is a big difference between someone running 2-3 and 10+ of them, or in case of VNIs / Gilas 30-60 or more at a time. While these arent the specific $100k whales, they are most definetly whales when compared to the rest of us that sub 1-2 accounts and plex another 2-3, not even all at the same time. I personally havent needed more then 2 accounts at a time for almost 3 years now.

1. Remove capitals or make heavy covert bombers with heavy focused bombs whose focus is to kill supers.

---
i think OP messed up the img or something
---
If you have any left, Fatimer Lightspeed would be very happy to receive! Best of luck man! 
---
No, you see, since PA has acquired EVE, this is what will happen.
---
Randomly across new eden, ["Bosses"](https://www.blackdesertfoundry.com/world-bosses-dungeons-guide/) will spawn, much like officers, but everyone who does damage to them gets entered into the drop table to get a prized AT Ship! These bosses will have timers on them, 1 shot mechanics, and cause massive lag :)
---
Now, you can instantly respawn your ship for just [200 plex](https://bddatabase.net/us/item/17566/), to continue doing damage, as the more damage you do, means the higher chance of you getting an AT ship. 
---
But some people don't really like this RNG grind, it's horrible! So of course, you can buy the AT ship in Jita, or wait for the [black market dealer](https://www.blackdesertfoundry.com/daynight-vendors-guide/) to show up in jita, but this costs a lot of isk just to see what he may have in store for you!
---
but but muh sandcastle.

If you have any left, would be aweosme if you could send any to Fatimer Lightspeed, thanks man and best of luck!

It's not about doing what's smart or convenient. It's about making a statement.

---
Op simply speaks out what I always wanting to say. 
---
CCP should feels lucky the only reason they can live and  harvest money from eve is because no other company wants to make a similar game. Once there’s a competitor coming out, you will see how you lose your player base because of your own fucking lazy ass.
---
Wow, popped my Reddit gold cherry! Thanks :)
---
&gt; this is the way the gaming economy works now
---
Well, it's *one* way it works. And as long as players support it, it will continue to be a valid strategy for making money. But there are plenty of people that wont support those practices, and wont pay money to companies that do that. These people make up a fairly large market, and buy games that tend to be from indy developers. Factorio is one that springs to mind, and minecraft when it was owned by Notch was similar.
---
If it's an issue that bothers you (like it does me), then drop games that do these practices (whether intentional or not), and look at other devs. 
---
I also dislike that people put money towards those companies, but it's screaming into the wind to ask everyone to stop. Instead, I've just made the move myself, and am making myself happier when it comes to my gaming hobby. Hopefully others follow, but my happiness doesn't require it.
---
I do hope CCP sort their shit out though, because I will come back when they do (due to the unique-ness of this game).

---
The old Cadbury switcheroo
---
I love the highly concentrated autism that radiates from all those so called adults in here
---
sounds like an improvement
---
For me it seems pretty clear that the massive layoffs from CCP were a plan to be as profitably as possible in the short run to boost the price of the company in the planned sale we saw last year. I personally even think that CCP not paying CSM food bills is a Scrooge McDuck move.
---
Doubling CSM costs would have the same impact as setting them to zero......none at all.
---
The sale to Pearl Abyss could imo be a good thing, more money for devs and while there is pretty much a guarantee to be some kind of lootbox p2w Asia servers(or related but different games) imo this aspect wont be implemented in the eve we play.
---
&gt; null fun
---
That's awesome, I like it. Good work!
---
Hilmar should be a figure head a marketing tool at this point.
---
That *still* doesn't get around the 'all the eggs in one - let's be honest - not great basket is a terrible idea' thing. The result of putting all those resources into Eve would just be a fundamentally slightly-shit game that's a little bit shinier.
---
Mechanically, Eve is a janky mess. It's not exactly engaging and more often than not, it's not exactly fun at a gameplay level. No amount of investment can change that.  
---
What's made Eve worth playing for the last 15 years or so is the shit people can get up to in the game to make it fun against all odds and the social aspects to underpin them. It's like a tabletop game using a shit system with a fuck-awful GM, but a hilarious party.
---
The projects that didn't pan out aren't by any means 'wasted', either. That's simply not how development works. A developer ***HAS*** to try different things to see what sticks and what lessons can be learned from those attempts. In honesty, the only bad result is a non-result.  
---
DUST, for instance, was by all accounts profitable. That's a big check mark there.  
---
Walking in Stations led to WoD. In that regard, they tried. From that, a lot got added on the backend. Maybe not full games, but saleable expertise if marketed correctly. That in itself can command a good price.  
---
The VR projects? Again, it's more valuable experiences in a field that very much has a market, if pointed in the right direction.
---
None of these things would directly translate to the core Eve experience, but if you look at things dispassionately instead of throwing toys out of the pram because they didn't directly give Eve a boost, you see that they also had to be attempted when the opportunities presented themselves. 
---
No MMO survives forever, even the ones with mainstream appeal. Eve should have died a long time ago if you look at things objectively, and as much as I've liked playing it for what it is? It's entirely possible that keeping it on life support for so long instead of shifting the company's core focus has done much, much more harm than good in the long run. Sure, *Eve* is still running, but in making that the case, CCP as a company seems to have caught the short end of it. 
---
If I did, I wouldn't dump it on EVE. Quite unbelievable that it was valued that high, wouldn't even think it's worth a quarter of that.
---
Looks like it. I have heard they might be considering a port for the NeXT Cube if there is enough interest. 
---
If you tell me your mains name I'll send you some isk to make you feel better ;)
---
We have strayed from the path!
---
Get fucked in general is characteristic to EVEology too. :)
---
I’d rather you didn’t 
---
My first Atron as a noob. I'd mined hard in my low skill venture to get it. I was belt ratting in the corps staging area, when I was jumped by a neut (null sec). Despite calling in standing fleet my poor old Atron bit the dust. Standing fleet then turned up and told me I'd been  bit of a dick to rat in staging because that's where all the enemy comes to play.
---
They then warped off and one of them gave me 20 mill isk and told me where to rat.
---
None of the many other loses since, bother me much. If I un dock a ship now, I don't expect it to come back.
---
I will try this in the evening. Tnx
---
Being thankfull and listening to those that actually play the game are two different things and we all know now the terminal problem is the majority of ccp devs dont actually play this game. They may be thankfull of csms opinions but they still go and jump off that cliff of stupidity. Csm isnt even setup like it should, it shouldnt be a whos who of popular idiots from the major power blocks, it should be leaders of the different fields of eve. Show me someone that does large scale mining and management of mining fleets , large scale logistics, mission running , large and not just nullsec industry on csm, oh wait you cant. Its pointless if the people giving thier opinions on said subjects know fuck all about them. 
---
Man you're talking to someone who has more firsthand experience and knowledge in this game than you could probably fathom, and you don't even realize it. You're wrong about this. It's not a big enough deal to dig your heels in and double down on
---
Thats not true, I think its just people hoarding plex before they unsub.
---
That's what you get for making a hentai channel on slack
---
Jk love u♡
---
Not to mention all the shitty whaaaa posts.
---
Losing the alliance tournament.
---
If you think what I was writing was whiteknighting CCP, you clearly didn't read what I actually wrote.
---
What happened?  That sucks.  I wish you a speedy recovery.
---
Maybe I can play it on my Samsung Smart Fridge
---
alts or corp mates to scan you in. 
---
Damn, is that all it takes? I should try being an asshole more often.
---
Ya, Jags make laser frigs super sad.
---
Removing OGB and buffing rorquals into the abomination we have now.
---
EVE just lost one of the greats.  
---
For anyone that doesn't know this duder was known for running his own tournaments without any ccp support on TQ. He was a legend and an all around dude.  
---
o7 sir
---
That could actually make a pretty fun abysmal deadspace activity. 
---
You all start in noob ship, Floating ships and depots with module, deadspace gets smaller. Last man standing, it would make a good isk sink, winner gets loot at the end. 
---
they are fucking hopeless it's not even imaginable, wtf
---
Believe it or not but there are way people having actually fun in null 
---
I'm gonna hit 50 this year... Time to get my cap, slippers and pipe!
---
I've sent you a PM.
---
Good times. I was there for the epic battle when we tried to save the baby titan. Stayed up way too late despite having work the next day.
---
It's going to be EVE online mobile edition, stand alone game. They're taking lessons from Blizzard.
---
Oh wait, they are actually developing EVE mobile already?
---
Sexy
---
good bot!              
---
^(pun intended ; nice to see so fast response)       
---
I dunno how you can argue removing ogb was good for the game. It made PvP more accessible for more people. 
---
Although I used it prolifically to my advantage I still can't think of an argument for it having been a good thing for the health of small gang.
---
I wouldn't say it's a bad time at all, despite what the vocal complainers on reddit say. Is it perfect? No. Is it still being developed and evolved and played by thousands of people? Yes. Don't get me wrong not everyone in game will be nice but find yourself a good corp with nice folks and you will be sorted, it's fun. Why not fire up an Alpha  and give it a go.
---
I am looking to buy a HAC for running the event.  Normally I would never beg for stuffs but I do no have enough isk for the ship and fittings (i could sell the Gila bp I found a few weeks ago but I would rather save that as a backup for the one I have in WH space (and I would still come up short with T2 cruiser prices what they are)).  If you are so inclined I would appreciate it.
---
Being 26th best Tapirum FC means you're 1 ahead of Asher!
---
The winner gets an AT Rorqual that can field 10 excavators and can PANIC for 30 mins.
---
&gt; then removing the module finally but completely shafting wormholes for months afterwards by not introducing a new mechanic to roll with then having the sheer audacity to say "we know we're fucking wormholers, but we wanted to get this fixed as soon as possible"
---
What the fuck are you on about, they put in the new rolling module in literally the same patch they changed the bubble generator.
---
&gt; I also asked if they had any mega whales 100k $ or more and he said yeah. How the fuck can you spend 100$k on eve? 
---
Does this mean they've spent $100k buying subscriptions and PLEX IRL, or bought $100k's worth of PLEX with ISK?
---
bookmarking it
---
My 1st ratting Rattlesnake, I was already disappointed because I got lower ticks and so much effort than my old Ishtar... and I lost it in a haven by a gang of ceptors thanks to a spy in my corp... 🤬
---
I think you grossly misunderestimate the knowledge of those on the CSM.  I also think you grossly misunderstand how their meetings actually operate.
---
Ok bye 
---
Oh yeah I was there too, sitting in all those bubbles in my Ferox if I remember correctly. Or maybe it was a Hawk. 😀 Didn't last long anyway even with all the lag.
---
Now you're listing a failure as an accomplishment.
---
&gt; Examples are difficult for you to comprehend I guess. I never proclaimed to be an "elite pvper." Simply that krabbing is the safest it has EVER been in the history of Eve.
---
And I never argue with that, not even once. I merely said that you could do something against that, which you try to deny with stupid examples. 
---
&gt;Again Delve is the most populated region in nullsec. It's not krabbing that makes content, it's population.
---
and what do you think drives the population? Does it ring now? :D
---
&gt;Without compensation? The compensation is already here. Citadels, alliance only gates, toggled cyno jammers, Panic Rorqs. These are all tools that favor the krab not the hunter.
---
All of them which can be killed and taken away, except local. Even the panic doesn't have a use if it's not backed up by a force helping out to kill the reason the rorq went into panic in the first place. 
---
&gt;Because wittle baby is not safe enough with citadels everywhere, alliance only gates, toggled cyno jammers, Panic Rorqs?
---
Yes, exactly. Without all these things (which you could take away), the advantages are all in the hunters favor. 
---
&gt;People have been having fun long before "delve wealth." 
---
but it was less fun in total across the game, as evident by the numbers on the MER. That is, if you think "destruction equals fun". 
---
&gt;Not really an extreme case.
---
oh yes you are an extreme case of loss aversity. 50 bil on the wallet but still scared to expose a 100 mil isk in ships. That's 500x more isk than you are willing to comit. I for one have no problems putting my nyx at 30bil at risk when I only have 7 bil quid. See the difference? I don't even have enough isk to replace that loss. Granted, I have SRP which will likely replace some of that, but I don't need 500 times the ISK. 500 times you loss averse excuse for an actual eve player. 
---
&gt;"If you don't grind structures which btw are over spammed, you must not like pvp." GENIUS IQ TAKE
---
It's a "if you don't have interest in provoking fights then you can't be all to interested in them". So, based on your actions, the problem isn't as drastic as you claim it is. And again, actions speak louder than words. 
---
&gt;But fights are provoked. Often you tackle a rorq to provoke a fight and what you get is a cyno lit, 30 titans pop 
---
and that's exactly why you need MORE PVE'ers in Space and not LESS. Making space less safe will result in less targets in space. That's why your claim of removing local will fix everything is pointless and stupid. 
---
&gt;It's not that they are invulnerable. It's that they offer many many many layers of protection for defenders and no tools have been given to the attacker as a balance point.
---
You have all the tools you need at your disposal. You have the option to assemble 1000 titans and field them against them. You can also bring a couple dozen dreads and feed them in a controllable way without any option for the defender to prevent you killing his Keepstar this way. A couple of dreads are enough to pause the timer and if you can bring enough dreads then you will kill it no matter what the defender does. 
---
If you would have said "I can't afford that", which you can't or, at the very least, don't want, then that's a legit argument for another problem. It's just not a "I can't because the game doesn't give me the option" because the game clearly allows you to do just that. 
---
Whether you don't want to or can't afford the tools you need to successfully kill a keepstar this way is irrelevant for this discussion. 
---
&gt; I don't know when you started playing but the game as further resorted to farmsville gimmicks of keeping krabs such as yourself safe.
---
I would say the game argument to actual players that cherish the entirety of eve and not just some half assed players that focus on one thing. You may dislike PvE, others don't and yes, PvE has been pushed and it lead to more desctruction in Eve. Don't argue with me, argue with the numbers - if you can comprehend the MER's to begin with. 
---
&gt;I don't know you're the one crying that you need so many defenses.  
---
I certainly don't need them all, I just dislike the idea of removing the one thing that allows you to survive nullsec on your own in the absence of your alliance's capital umbrella. Because you know, all the advantages an alliance grants can be stripped and taken away. 
---
Local can't be removed like that. The same way I can't remove your inherit advantage of being the agressor which usually has superior numbers and which is prepared to do the job at hand, while I can't prepared for PvE equally at the same time. Local is a balance to that and in the absence of local and the alliance, you would have an advantage that is almost impossible to overcome. 
---
And that's why I belive you are one of the self proclaimed elite PvP'ers which are caught to in their own little bubble and too dumb to realize that the game is way too complex for them to ever come up with a reasonable change this way. I realized that, that's why I am not in the position to make demands in the first place. 
---
I only provide arguments. 
---
&gt;You're not at a disadvantage by default you imbecile.
---
A PvE'er is at a disadvantage by default since forever and for aslong as PvE isn't 1:1 the same as PvP. As I said, there are numerous advantages that can be built by labor in the game, but none of them is inherited by deciding to opt in the PvE-Skilltree (that, you know, doesn't exist). 
---
Having the initiative and the option to chose the fights you take is an inherit advantage for the agressor. One the PvE'er minding his business in anoms does not have and will never ever have and in the interest of an enjoyable game for everyone, there needs to be a counter to this. Local is that. Remove it and provide something else is fine. Remove it without compensation is not. 
---
If you have so many problems with the other advantages an alliance may or may not offer, burn the alliance down and fight against them. 
---
Sad to see a good pilot leave. Had fun shooting you and shooting others with you. If you ever decide to come back, you'll have friends waiting. Au revoir mon amie. 
---
True but CCP gave the tools to progress the time for it's current situation faster. Sure people would become richer by the time but that would still have taken years. Now you just grab your credit card and pump some skills into your brain, grab a roq and start culling asteroids. 
---
A couple years back EVE24news had amazing articles about almost every super/titan loss in the game since it was rare to see one get blown up. Now they are barely making news articles about them due to the big amount being blow up and the "meh already replaced" mentality. 
---
And here I am recruiting one player after another that's bored by the large-entity-playstyle and want to put actual effort in building something new with their own hands.
---
People always told me there is no chance of becoming big and successful without joining one of the blobs, but until now the people I've recruited speak another language. We are just at the beginning of our journey, but for many of us, Eve isn't dead. It just came to life for the first time. At least that's what they say.
---
It used to be 1 plex = 1 month. Now it is 500 plex = 1 month.
---
Plex is now also used for other purchases instead of the Aura cash they invented.
---
Yes, yes they are.
---
Aryth had enough knowledge to try to get ccp to remove the mer. The rest of the csm didn't even question aryth about the "threats" posed by the mer. Same with the hic mass changes.
---
And i bet there's more of these happening that we just don't hear about because of the nda. 
---
Same shit happened to me. My module showed that it was cycling and it wasn’t. Abyss rats killed me and CCP laughed
---
Or neither of them do.  Bob be praised.
---
Oh, another project?  Great that all that plex can pay for CCP's short-term business planning.
---
I removed my recurring subscription to the game on my 2 accounts at Christmas.  I am currently on the fence about renewing them or just finding another game to play.  Going to try Stellaris out .. a different type of game; but one where i can pause it.
---
CCP had a great idea for a computer game.. epic in scale and brutal in risk vs reward... However, over the years the game has been won by the player base.  The simple fact now is that PvP is now 99% consensual.  You can spend hours roaming through null and find nothing; unless you go to certain regions and immediately get dropped by countless pirate supers / titans.  When people twitch stream ratting in supers and titans which 3-4 years ago would have been unthinkable; you know there is a problem.
---
The number of bots is a problem yes... but its more the lack of actual players.. Why bother playing the game for 3-4 hours at a time and just have zero fun.  The slack / discord channels I am in dedicated for Eve the majority of players have quit; which over the years is to be expected.  But these players are not being replaced.
---
CCP have failed to invest in their cash cow and its quite clear they have put the game into maintenance mode.  The CCP devs do not play their own game.  I find it incredibly annoying listening to CCP devs talk about null being a scary unforgiving place... its not.  I find highsec more scary when hauling stuff around in an Impel.
---
My fear is the game is too far gone for people to return.. even the suggestions the CSM are in agreement with in regards to captial nerfs are too late and not enough.  CCP wanted to spike their profits; which in fair they did but in the process tore the very essence of what made eve special.
---
meh.
---
Well they could use it... 
---
Right. I think it's time to take a break from /r/eve. The reeeeee is getting out of hand.
---
Most likely the latter, also mix of direct purchases of straight from CCP and RMT (RMT either directly or via proxies to bypass game rules) but CCP can not afford to get rid of them.
---
In past I was also searching them for my monitoring services at work... But in the end I abandoned the idea, the cause too much stress for me... Actually I'm far less stressed by an entire datacenter down than from my eve ship being in hull :O
---
&gt;Eve has swung so far in a horseshoe that personal loss is now meaningless and the scale of the game has skyrocketed to the degree that infinitely condensed empires are untouchable to anyone but one larger than themselves. In this I mean - there is not any conceivable timeline in which Geminate could be meaningfully disrupted asymetrically as was the case in HBC delve circa 2013. Wealth has grown to the point that there is an unassailable disparity. 
---
And people laughed when I said that EVE Online provided an accurate critique of capitalism.
---
Rip dude, had fun in the frig 1v1 tourney you organised. Gl. 
---
Not weird with this shit bitter community that never appreciates even the smallest thing, always complaining about fucking everything
---
I mean nerf supers
---
You look like one of those dogs that ate a bee.... 
---
Uh, no it's not. It's a video game.  Now fite me, 1v1 at the sun.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pf7gpi/october-balance-pass 
---
I don't recall if the outcry worked and they fixed the issue before releasing it, but it literally says in that article that they're just removing the mass effect and dlare fine with it shafting wormholers for now.
---
I'm positive if there wasn't a massive screeching REEEEEE from wormholers we still wouldn't have the mass entangler today.
---
ccp priorities have been out of whack for the last 4 years on top of really bad changes with no iteration
---
Rage had TIDI
---
For an actual answer, technicly yes.
---
It does "Exist" but given that said devs most likely are in other teams as well, they are simply not kept in that/allowed to balance stuff.
---
just take empty space and eve physics.
---
much less 3d models to be made.
---
(actually... bouncing people out of th eplaying field could be a fun mechanic)
---
Where did it it say they canceled the AT because of funding?
---
I agree with all of your other points, but I think it's unfair to judge CCP on things that *could* have happened but didn't.
---
Adapting to the patch as a wormholer was as easy as going to jita and buying 4 of the new modules for your hic.
---
Ship build from BPC stolen from Sansha Nation died - Praise Kuvakei!
---
Google translate
---
You mis-understood.  I meant OGB was good.  I see now how that seems like I meant the opposite.  I will fix it when I am awake.
---
I'm conflicted here then, cos BSG is one of the all-time greats (other than the mystifying "Gaius Baltar is a Jesus metaphor" of Season 4).  The truest injustice of Farscape is that Claudia Black wasn't a megastar afterwards, and yes, I will die on that hill.
---
F. Old Friend
---
Oh my...
---
Neat
---
give me something
---
Pepperidge farms remembers
---
How do you know the 64bit client won't just be so bad that it'd be just a nail in that coffin? 
---
Yes, please. 
---
Because there was a nullsec blob.
---
More conflict is better than no conflict and entities in motion are vulnerable to getting picked off.
---
Preach brother. Wormholes are where it's at tbh. The mass/size limits are brilliant soft caps for engagement sizes.
---
Damn they're playing 4D chess
---
I wonder if it's easier to incorporate microtransactions on 64bit.
---
Oh my god dude I got vertigo just watching that zooming
---
i mean let's see if CCP can make it work because so far it's been a mess for them 
---
though i guess they can just keep trying for a long time since eve playerbase doesn't seem to be quitting that fast 
---
o7 F
---
Send the ISK to a newbie, like me. 
---
so as you admit yourself neither of these fits is actually any good for pvp
---
how do you get from no AT 2019 to kill the game off? I don't get it.
---
&gt;pretending Abyss pvp and ransom is a thing for poors
---
yeah, cool . tnx for info
---
why else would they cancel the AT
---
There's a certain logic to making sure pve remains viable: 
---
* No one mining/doing indy/farming LP BPCs/whatever means a lack of ships for pvpers to go get blown up, or at least more expensive ships ensuring players become more rusk averse and less inclined to take part in "fuck it" fights.
---
* Ensuring there is something for new players not yet ready to get blobbed by supers to do creates engagement with the game, so newer players stick around long enough to dip their toes into pvp.
---
* Roaming empty systems for hours gets boring, so having something to do rather than log off is important.
---
* Creating pve sites creates sites for hunters to look. Roamers can jump to belts, anomalies, abyssal traces, etc. rather than having to scan down every individual ship (with said ship probably bolting the second combat probes start floating). Ditto missioning hubs create reliable traffic for hunting.
---
Ignoring pve entirely would kill pvp, so both sides win.
---
You've missed the greater conundrum: why did anyone think a group that came from a website that routinely harassed people to suicide and entered EVE Online with *the express goal* of making the game miserable to play for everyone who wasn't a member of that website *WOULD EVER* act in the interests of the game?
---
Because in ages of dominion there was neither skill injectors nor rorquals. And no citadels.
---
Nope, you're putting words in my mouth
---
Your other option in abyss is hand-craft a 2b+ fit and play rock (active hac/vedmak) - paper (curse) - scissors (purger gila)
---
which, for obvious reasons, most players wont do.
---
While you are there, lets not forget moon / Rorqual mining.  Basically, CCP's lazy design approach was to copy/paste Nullsec features into WH space.  
---
Resource-balancing was overdue on WH space but copying / pasting NS features into WH space was inexcusable lazy from CCP.  
---
'Kay. Bye! 
---
I'd argue that if the CSM can do *this*:
---
&gt;A CSM whose sov and structures were under attack got keepstar lockrange buffed to remove one of the only ways outside of megablobbing to reinforce one. 
---
Then CCP is only a CSM mouthpiece.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA  
---
no
---
Yea, I misremembered that point. I just remember raging about it when I saw that devblog about the October release.
---
Are they really the same? 
---
Eve dominates its niche, there are no competitors. Blockbusters got bullied out of the way because they didn't hop on the next tech train if i remember correctly and their business model became outdated. Sears i honestly don't know about but it just seems like a general store from the little google i did, buttloads of competition 
---
where do you see the similarities? 
---
Who even is the head dev now that Seagull is gone? At least Seagull tried to keep us optimistic with a blog ever now and then....aint heard shit from no one for months.
---
set yourself a goal. My goal is being able to produce one carrier each day.
---
:(
---
Nah
---
Before that PL and Raiden dropping small gangs of tracking titans on mediums sized gangs used to be routine.
---
Yeah but we're talking about wars between groups of *thousands* of players that had to fight a lot to own their space.
---
I mean, that's a pretty large amount of people that you'd expect to give up an advantage just to play """fair""".
---
I asked them twice to revive my character. They never replied. 
---
So thanks to CCP helping me overcome this addiction. :) 
---
Pretty much every german of my age had this as a poem in school. To see an sung version of it in an eve video crosses some wires in a very weird way in my brain. :D
---
I'm not a fan of Goons, but isn't their motto to ruin *your* game, not *the* game, right?
---
Hehe wanted know how natives feel when watching this. Okay lol :D
---
no way eve gets sold again, PA already paid a pretty inflated price for a sinking ship 
---
who is gonna take that hot potato off them 
---
CCP invented inability to communicate
---
Man, that was part of the greatest part about wormholes. Stumble on some dude doing a capital escalation and call in bros, then he calls in bros, then some third group shows up and starts shooting at everyone. 
---
You also get to fly some fun shit. ECM, Neuts, brick tanked T3s, the occasional assault frigate, the works. Mass is at a premium, so bringing value to a fight is huge.
---
I ended up moving to null when my corp did, and null is _boring_ compared to wormholes. F1 monkeys, shit fights, capital umbrellas, etc.
---
My alliancemates have tried many times to sell me on the wonders of null, but I'm honestly pretty bummed out. Trying to work out if going to lowsec is worth doing, since I've never really been able to afford pvp ("sustainable pvp is nice and all, but I've never been able to pull it off").
---
&lt;/rant&gt; 
---
**TLDR:** Fights in null are garbage.
---
64bit client is just test for black desert online 2
---
Didn't think of it tbh. I used to solo low sec vanguards with 15 accounts for my isk so there was a fair bit of SP to melt down there alone lol.
---
Work overload on the few people running it, that now have to focus on getting the World Tour up and running.
---
That shakes the game up once until the most powerful groups have relocated.
---
It's basically what we have now only that the difference is density of systems in lightyears rather than ressources per region. 
---
PM me your username on Discord lol
---
back when eve was good, rip.
---
so much nostalgia in one video
---
Ugh. Listening to the masturbation over that was annoying as all hell.
---
Congrats nullblobs! You managed to kill a wormhole. Very impressive.
---
&gt; I'm not gonna lie, vs. a lot of abyss pvp fits (pretty much anything with mwd and deadspace tank) this is gonna be a quick loss.
---
 This Orthrus, frankly, has quite a slim chance of killing anyone in pvp pocket 
---
Idk back in 2009-2012 when they would do live streams about going out in smalls fleets filled with plex, showing up on peoples streams to talk in chat, do monthly walk throughs of their studios, and constantly were talking one the forums, it was a lot of fun how included they felt. Never forgot the nonstop solo Talos streams!  
---
Now it feels like you they don't even know how to login through their own launchers. 
---
This comment is under appreciated. 
---
A very bad submarine?
---
So because they can't pay new people to do the AT, they cancel it while announcing a brand new mmo.
---
Yeah, some people do. I'm entitled to my own opinon too of that it is super fucking boring and all the big groups do is indoctrinate newbros into farming and quitting.
---
Garth that is how heroin shit happens
---
respect meds they are spooky af
---
You can change it all you want. You can reduce it down to everyone gets the same ship...8 high slots, 6 mids, 6 lows, 3 rigs, and a capital size cargo bay that can hold anything. Make it so you can use every module in the game. No bonuses, how much more balanced can that be? Doesn't matter. Cloaky campers would bitch that it's unfair that they are forced to use one less blaster because the cloak takes up a high slot and miners would bitch that mining laser reduced their DPS too. And as long as two people can join together to defeat one, you will still be facing the same problems.
---
Should have clarified 'if not afk or retarded'.
---
what does that have to do w/ what you posted?
---
&gt;  Afterwards people will find a new meta to game and when that gets out of control we can change that too. That's how you keep a game fresh and evolving, not stagnant and boring.
---
That's something many folks forget. To keep a game like a MMO staying around, it has to be a constant update stream to throw up whatever current Meta players use, because if the name of the game is to win then you can bet your bottom ISK that people *will* find a way to exploit anything and everything.
---
Too true. I scroll through here to read once in awhile when I have to do some chores aka mining otherwise I make use of what is out there to go kill stuff... Or get killed.
---
Even with no AT😂😂😂
---
This is not true. My brother was the mistake. 
---
Awww, I bet you say that to all the girls. Happy valentines to you too sweety
---
it was not milk ......
---
"ok guys, we unhappy with game, now let's log in and play it!"
---
Have you ever eat at McDonalds?         
---
Ok it is not a whales one ... still prime meat.
---
Marshal to CODE. and then whining about it

---
Oof!
---
Sorry to see you go, bro. 
---
That's cute and all, but it doesn't disprove my point. PI is still the bottleneck for structure spam, keepstars or otherwise. 
---
I did the the same - extracted NorwegianDarkness, gave away all isk (close to 100b), sent her to doomheim, and deleted my Reddit account. But guess what. I returned 10 months later. Good needed break. But it's difficult to quit.
---
OP: Leave some isk on a separate character and unsubscribe.
---
AKA lack of being able to pay other people to do it
---
How? 
---
I quit too in 07. I'm back and happy. Idc about all the flaws I love the game and appreciate the time I get to spend in it. If anyone wants to spare me from buying ISK or injectors because I have no income stream in game and no time to build one and they are quitting, in game name is Ludwig Otto Wilhelm (my alt) please and thanks. 
---
You actually can't make this shit up what the actual fuck
---
Thank you. I'd come back if I could afford a decent PC.
---
Still no lowsec gate to Stain apparently ....
---
That easy, what
---
You understood everything, (legit)
---
Keep the fun gameplay, and fuck the minmax, I've min maxed everything I do, and at times I consider just trashing my toons and restart from 0...
---
If the best strategy to "rise to the top" is digging in and fortifying a region that *should* not be able to support you, then that's kind of unbalanced, right? Do you think Rome would have collapsed if they would have been able to field all their armies and produce all their stuff purely out of Italy?
---
standard meal with a softdrink is hard to come by below 30$. I brought alot of energybars when i went fanfest last year and was very happy about them as it saved me 200-300$ easy.
---
wtf am i reading even 
---
&gt;The projects that didn't pan out aren't by any means 'wasted', either. That's simply not how development works. A developer HAS to try different things to see what sticks and what lessons can be learned from those attempts. In honesty, the only bad result is a non-result.
---
which happened with a fair number of their "branch out" attempts and are you talking about coding or business? because business wise losing money is certainly a bad result every time unless you do some funky accounting. 
---
&gt;DUST, for instance, was by all accounts profitable. That's a big check mark there.
---
until they release some actual numbers here this means nothing. Spent 10m, got 10.5m is not exactly a good business decision(especially if it's over years) and judging by how they didn't brag at all about this "profit making venture" my guess is the numbers look something similar to that 
---
&gt;Walking in Stations led to WoD. In that regard, they tried. From that, a lot got added on the backend. Maybe not full games, but saleable expertise if marketed correctly. That in itself can command a good price.
---
who the fuck is gonna buy their expertise of massively failing 2 projects in a row, what kind of fucked up world do you live in even 
---
&gt;The VR projects? Again, it's more valuable experiences in a field that very much has a market, if pointed in the right direction.
---
They fired their entire VR staff i believe and have completely stepped out of that "valuable" field, you seem to approaching this from a developer standpoint rather than a business stand point to be completely honest, a company is not an individual that can sell their experience, CCP sells PRODUCT
---
&gt;No MMO survives forever, even the ones with mainstream appeal. Eve should have died a long time ago if you look at things objectively, and as much as I've liked playing it for what it is? It's entirely possible that keeping it on life support for so long instead of shifting the company's core focus has done much, much more harm than good in the long run. Sure, Eve is still running, but in making that the case, CCP as a company seems to have caught the short end of it.
---
Why should eve have died a long time ago? it is completely alone in it's niche, no other game comes close to it- a ton of people still to this day only play eve for this reason, nothing else comes close to it. 
---
It certainly has done more harm than good to focus on failed shit rather than eve but hey what do i know i'm just an ex customer 
---
Because it is nearly ubiquitous that people avoid fights they they think they they cannot win - the AT crew like the event because it imposes an equality that means "gudfites" can happen. In reality groups very very rarely limit their offensive capability - they might not go for overkill if they are farming the residents of an area, but they still ensure they have an edge in terms of overall power. The hardest thing in getting a fight any more outside Sov slogs is tricking the opponent into thinking they have the upper hand so they'll actually engage. It's been like this since I started playing in 2008 and it's no different now.
---
One of the good games that come to mind are Warframe and Path of Exile. Both f2p, both have had a great growth for the past couple of years and have seen the daylight of mainstream twitch advertisement and ,simply put, fun to watch and play. Other than that, there are plenty of good indy games around. If eve online players don't have much to do with their money they can invest in a switch with a huge microsd card and buy plenty of amazing games. Or do the same but on PC. 
---
People are bored of the stale state of the game - promising things which have time and time again not come, i think the last few years people have been hanigng onto change and that the game will get better but has not, over and over and i think people are sick of it.
---
so... go krab away and buy injectors etc or unsub and come back when its better.
---
Getting rid of non-essential rorq skills
---
lol i'm still on windows 7
---
Get your backside back in wormholes, doesn't even have to be with us. Plenty of groups out there. Can't guarantee fights 24/7 like null can and they're not like they used to be. But man they're still there. And wormholes are still fun.
---
Apparently cancelling the AT was the last straw for a few people
---
Bok. Bok

I knew you would be here.

Not... Empty quoting...

@1:18:30    Is that Doc's Gillette song? 
---
Anyways , you destroying something that took you 10+ years to train and pay for isn't costing CCP anything . You leaving is good for them , less bitter player ( vet's maybe)  whining to the masses  causing others to rethink their frivolous  spending. 
---
When you're gone, no one cares ... its that simple
---
HAS THERE EVER BEEN A STATE OF THE GAME EVE ONLINE  THAT DID WELL AND WAS MET WITH GREAT FEEDBACK?  JUST ONCE?? in 15 years?  
---
Is that representative of CCP's lack of actual skill and community awareness or representative of the fact that Internet Spaceships attracts the biggest fucking group of whiners and complainers in any game ?  I'd say about 50 / 50
---
Finally! There's your perfect balance!
---
Just imagine ppl shitting on your product  whilst using it everyday  
---
Those who cant adapt always try to make some grand  I'M LEAVING spectacle .  Blaming the game Dev's and the people  instead of their own preconceived notion of the future ...................................
---
 when you come back , name your next character Blockbuster Video    
---
I mean, as someone who loves to find Rorquals in the chain and explode them, I am not complaining. Especially if it leads to an even bigger fight. But I do understand what you mean. And you know me better than most on here haha
---
move entire eve community into wormholes and see how long all those things you love wormholes for stays that way.
---
no tidi in wormholes? are you crazy? of course there is tidi in wormholes, its not a different server mechanic, just less people in the thing.
---
Never said it was. Simply, I'm asking that people start thinking about something else than "MUUH I WENT TO DELVE THEY DROPPED TITANS ON ME".
---
Maybe it's Eve 2.  Eve with all the shit fixed. 
---
Are they? In my experience most wormhole corps were still so goddamn paranoid that it wasn't worth the trouble.
---
_thinking_
---
Though I suppose now that POSes aren't an issue and Citadels make stealing less of a bitch that's probably not so much of a problem.
---
CCP cancelled AT with no definite promise of any real change, the new event added LOOTBOXES of all things, that make you isk negative, as well as requiring mining, around 20 event sites (after rats are cleared) to make even a basic booster. There has been no decent balance change for a while, chat has somewhat stabilised but the refusal to rollback seems like a slap in the face in response to all the issues with it. Gameplay has been stale with no incentive for actual combat or conquest, lack of action against bots are making people pissed, most of the community team was fired, devs responses seem out of touch causing even more reeeeeeee
---
don't know why the downvotes. appreciate the time to make it. 
---
I thought the whole point of CCP hosting streamers was to do this for people who are &lt;already streaming&gt;.  Its not really "asking you to work" if its something you were already going to do.
---
lol
---
Maybe some more PVP streamers should offer to work with them?
---
Where do you think games come from?
---
While I don't like Citadels in wormhole space, POS living was much better for what I used to do. (intel gathering and eyes). Citadels has made things more laid back. But at the same time it's also killed off some of the content, POS killing used to take 2 days tops, Cit killing now means 24/7 hole control for days on end. Not fun... But the fights are still there, if a groups not too risk averse. 
---
But many groups out there, while still paranoid, have relaxed somewhat. N0VAC and Hole Control still kicking around if you want the massive cap brawls etc. Sound mind still doing their thing. Stranger Danger and Sinners Trajectory PvPing a fair bit.
---
Course there's us as well, group of washed up old vets trying to breath life into the old wh bushido.
---
a simple scram on each drone fix'es the boosh and his method. So there. Back to square 1.
---
Notice how many wh alliances are taking sov?
---
Thanks for the detailed run-down, I think I get it why people are mad :/
---
How does he get away with having that on his squad? 
---
exactly. the game is long gone broken. Even if a nerf comes right now it will take years to actually feel the effect.
---
&gt; HAS THERE EVER BEEN A STATE OF THE GAME EVE ONLINE THAT DID WELL AND WAS MET WITH GREAT FEEDBACK?
---
Apocrypha
---
if enough ppl quit the game id will simply die. And you will lose it as well who you thought you adapted. 
---
I UNSUBBED GIVE ME KARMA PLS
---
probably devs working on acquiring dank new skills before having to look for a new job
---
Then you blow them up.
---
This is a neat post. Made neater by the people crying on the comments. Any personal stories about ransoms from these ships?
---
Bad faith coy questions are obvious. 
---
Dibs on free isk please! pm me :)
---
No AT was just the icing... 
---
If the game was remotely healthy people would care far less.
---
This is why spies are useful. 
---
&gt; Good luck finding a game to replace EVE.
---
This right here is why I keep returning. If another publisher cane along with a high quality space sandbox that replicated the older versions of Eve before skill injecting and asset safety, I'd jump ship in a minute.
---
Hey there, could I have some isk please :)
---
Wormhole resources needed an overhaul, you mentioned nanoribbons and their decline from ISK 8mil to worthless.  Sleeper loot and some gas were the resources only found in WH space and hence made the space worthwhile for PvE.  CCP blew their chance to do something (*anything*) unique to WH space with Citadels, mining, events, ship functions (T3D), PI,  "weather" and so on.  If we got anything at all, it was "collateral damage" from NS.  
---
Now, I understand the rationale.  CCP doesn't have a marketing department able to recruit new players.  Their only way to boost subscriptions is to incentivize existing players to plex more AFK miners / ratters or wait for some massive battle in NS to make it into PC Gamer.  Neither works for WH, FW or LS (HS has other issues, wardecs etc) and hence all development efforts went into NS, actually SOV NS.  From the commercial point, I kind of get it.  
---
Unfortunately, this isn't sustainable.  EVE is the only surviving MMO where there wasn't a traditional "endgame".  Now CCP is driving the "Endgame" into Delve with massive boosts to AFK mining / ratting and meaningless goodfites over nothing but KB stats.  
---
All that /r/eve whining aside.  WH space is still where EVE can be played at its very best and I'll stay here until I biomass or the servers shut down. 
---
Excellent name! 
---
o7 Jim, you were loved.
---
&gt; I agree with all of your other points, but I think it's unfair to judge CCP on things that could have happened but didn't.
---
Yes, but it only didn't happen because the community massively railed against it. The fact of the matter is that they don't know how this game works and they are happy to just plough on regardless of impact.
---
"Ah noone flies rorquals, let's make them cool so people fly them"
---
"Oh, the entire economy is fucked, and there's no dialling it back now, whoops".
---
&gt; Half of r/Eve are people who have long since quit the game but get off memeing it's flaws. The other half still still cling to their perceived idea of what Eve is 
---
I get what you are saying, /r/eve has always been pretty much memes and negativity but have you looked at the official event feedback forums:
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/event-feedback-guardians-gala-2019/
---
TL;DR It's not just Reddit that's pissed off with the state of the game.  Time to stop reading as it's making me depressed.
---
Ghehehe. Then again, back in 2005 nobody expected it to last as long as it has either.

I'm not sure you'd know what to do with yourself if CCP ever gave you what you wanted.
---
Not paying anymore is a far more hurtful statement to CCP then whether or not a character is also biomassed.
---
Quite a lot of ppl. But t's not simply an alliance tournament. It's a symbol. A symbol for people who enjoyed small gang warfare. For people who don't enjoy sitting in a Titan outside a keepstar in a super cap umbrella emprie and drop bosons on every frigate. People who play the meta of pvp warfare. And it's one of the few situations where fairness comes into play. You can't blob, light a cyno or whatever. It was broadcasted as a yearly event, and for people who were participating, it was a dream come true. Quite big amount of pride in it. Now all that is gone. And it's the feeling that we keep having in the game for last 2 years. That quality is being sacrificed for quantity. The imbalance of it all is getting worse and worse.  And the shattered hope we had for CCP to fix the game are gone forever. Imagine being the developer of this game and have such limited understanding of it and what it means for so many people that you simply announce NO AT THIS YEAR. Even i never participated in AT myself it was always on my bucket list. And for that reason alone i unsubbed 6 accounts. And i suggest that to everyone. Even if you have 10 rorquals accounts and you love mining, even if you run high sec missions, whatever you do in the game. This affects you as well. You should boycott this with all your power. If the game maintain it's current course it will surely die in a few years top. So fight for it.

Alright, thanks

its nice that ccp is giving their players an opportunity to explore new games (✿◠‿◠)

---
I've had a mirror-match in a pretty expensive deimos (he had 3 damage mods but still no way of breaking him, cause damage profile), dude offered me 1.5b if i turn off reps, scammed him out of  half of that, then we both died to abyss timer. He posted his loss
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75136227/

https://zkillboard.com/kill/75136230/
---
And then back in December i was trying the cheapo Orthrus and got 1bil ransom off of an expensive krab gila who entered the wrong pocket (this happens less and less though)
---
I think the outcry about this is more due to the general feeling that CCP definitely has put Eve on "low flame" mode by canceling such a old tradition than the "no AT" news itself.
---
Combined with the stagnant state of the game in the last years (Lack of ballancing efforts, unwillingness to deal with controversial but important changes to supers and caps, no real vision for the future, takeover by PA, etc.) it just doesn't look good in terms of commitment to the game.
---
And because beer is necessary to have a good trip? Food isn’t awful if you do a small amount of research on where to eat.
---
At this point I don't know if I even want a next event if the quality doesn't change for good. The overall feedback I got about the event is *even worse* than the feedback about the christmas event. There is a lot of salt but even more lack of understanding about the design decision for this event. Reprocessing of the event ore (1000m^(3) for two, really?), garbage drops (what a pun..), questionable distribution and spawn of the event sites and more. But that's actually not the problem for me, decisions can be reverted and mistakes corrected. However, none of that happened until now and a patch during the weekend is unlikely in my opinion. A week of event wasted, most likely the whole event will be a flop.
---
Suggestions:
---
* Future events should NOT have the format event currently have, there seems no appreciation for how they are run currently. Return to the "old" format of x sites per system respawing every y minutes. Loot tables like this: Null &lt; Low &lt; High. Ensures there is some incentive to run sites in lower security systems.
---
* Accelerators should have a price that newbros/newer players can afford them, because they have to catch up. A basic accelerator for &gt;80mil ISK is not affordable, not to speak about the prices for other accelerators. Make them cheaper again by providing a proper supply of ore. There is no problem for me to require industry/mining to acquire accelerators.
---
* Encourage PvP in the sites, especially in high sec. Not by weird missions (like killing people in a barge) but by having drops worth fighting for. 
---
There are more suggestions but I don't want to inflate this comment. I would ***love*** to provide structured feedback to CCP, but it doesn't seem there is a place for it because regardless of forums or here, it doesn't seem that decision makers from CCP at least acknowledge feedback from players given to them. (I don't want to attack any dev here, in contrast, I see many of them replying on reddit or the forums quickly and directly to posts. But unfortunately none of the people taking the bigger decisions seems to have the balls to get out and admit things gone wrong..)
---
SPHERE.EXE
---
&gt; x3 albion prelude
---
Never heard of it. Is it non consentual PVP with opponent loot drops and the same loss we used to feel when losing a POS?If it harkens back to the HTFU days of Eve, I'll defo give it a try.
---
CCPs Valentine's gift was to cancel AT for this year and "focus on balance". No idea if the AT is going to return or balance will really be done. But plenty of people don't seem to believe CCP and finally call it after swallowing many decisions they didn't like.
---
After all I can relate very well. I pay subs to EVE and hear a nice PvP event gets cancelled for bogus reasons while pornhub is giving away premium free for 24h. 
---
Well...at least we could fuck ourselves watching some nice adult movies.
---
oof. full broadside hit (◠﹏◠✿)
---
yeah its single player, the player base refer to it as eve offline. worth a look for anyone more interested in the PVE aspects of eve 
---
Tbh losing a Tengu while actually watching porn, even more so than losing a titan on a neut cit.

McDonald's UK advertises that it only uses cuts of beef. Giblets and ofal go to dog meet, protein shakes, or boiled down into other protein feed. I've seen it they pressure wash the shot right off the floor and scoop it up for boiling.

If they haven't nuked the community team this would be less of an issue. 
---
Big money. Big women. Big fun.
---
Huh, I heard good things about warframe, and was downloading it before I read your comment, but PoE looks interesting too.
---
One other thing I didn't mention is that if a dev is considered "good", it's usually because the community is friendly too, which is obviously one of the most important parts of many games.
---
even with this week being especially "interesting" for eve and players leaving making me a bit sad, I had plenty of good solo and small gang fights already and got to know more nice people.
---
this game is still what we make of it and we should enjoy it as long as we can {◕ ◡ ◕}
---
I thought I was in /r/Gamingcirclejerk for a second.
---
It's a shitty event. Indeed. It's also meaningless to the game as a whole.  It makes as much sense to rage quit the game over a shitty event as it does to rage quit over AT. I suppose if those are what it takes then cool, the game might be better off without you.
---
To add that above, Instead to put more stuff Power in EVE itself, CCP are working on a new MMORPG game. Thats the point the ppl realize that nothing Big changes are Coming anymore or new (Good PVP pointed) Expansions are Coming, and by this I mean adding just new ships with new fancy guns doesnt Really Change anything apart to Make structres Grinding less stressfull 
---
I hope that link involves game stop and a circle jerk otherwise I'm not clicking that bait.
---
It will be an "event" in name only, it will effectively be a lootbox delivery service. This event introduced them, the next one will introduce playing PLEX for a premium lootbox or isk for a shitty one like you got in this event. Shortly after the next event ends they will announce that loot boxes are now permanently available on the PLEX store featuring exclusive faction items and eve will officially be Pay 2 Win .
---
don't know if this is a good spot ask but I'm a wow refugee and I'm looking at joining would anyone give a potential newbie some advice?

i met my best eve friend several months ago and have spent an absolutely ridiculous amount of time chatting with him since.
---
tomorrow he is flying across the atlantic to hang out with me for the week and i'm so frickin nervous and excited (◕‿◕✿)
---
They never payed anyone to do the AT...
---
Just after article about lack of lowsec gate to Stain.

They should have payed the people that have been doing it all this years for that logic to make sense.

Indeed.
---
Woah buddy let's not get too ahead of ourselves now. Just concentrate your efforts on the Stain gate first.
---
Is it good? Are there enough people playing? 
---
Well, istead of hiring new people for this soon to be failed mmo, hire people to work on the AT.
---
Which in and of itself, is shit. Really fucking shit.
---
r/OldSchoolCool
---
&gt;  It's also meaningless to the game as a whole. It makes as much sense to rage quit the game over a shitty event as it does to rage quit over AT
---
That all really depends on what the game is *to you*.  Sure, shitty events and lack of tournaments might not concern you one bit, but it's always important to remember that just because something doesn't effect *you* doesn't mean it's not a legitimate concern.
---
Diamond Dawg42 would love anything you're getting rid of, if not, no big deal. Congrats

i like playing team fortress 2 when i'm not being silly in eve (◕‿◕✿)

Or pay the ones doing it and let them dedicate some of their work time to it instead of their free time... but yes, you are right.

i certainly do not mind that you have stolen this thread from me this week and hope your weekend will be full of positive experiences ◔_◔

It's early to know, but so far we are still salty about the AT and the general (lack of) direction of the game.

eve is a social game, so join a corporation as soon as possible to make everything more fun and less confusing. i am not sure what kind of playstyle you're looking for, but feel free to message me what you want to do or any potential corporations you're looking into joining and i can give you advice. (◠‿◠✿)

Your idea is simple and actually makes sense from a balance perspective. What a great idea!
---
i did not steal anything friend, i simply want to continue the tradition that /u/UpgradeNova started. (✿◠‿◠)

Indeed. Warframe community must be one of the best i've been a part of. You still get your fare share of market people who are trying to scam but using warframe.market most of the scams get denied.

Well he's already a tool - so just add marketing and we're gucci.
---
This sums up my feelings pretty well. I used to tell people I'd still be playing the day they switched the servers off but that's looking less and less likely as time goes on.
---
I've never actually done this, but I assume to ransom you need to let your own ship get destroyed yeah? So you need to always demand enough to make a profit 
---
This makes no sense. There is no local in WHs and there are still plenty of carebears to hunt in those.
---
EVE ONLINE SUCKS AND I HATE IT
---
Init scum winning eve is always a good thing.
---
F
---
pvp sucks anyways
---
What's this? Another fake game/tax scam? Every two years on the dot, they pull this.
---
Garbage scam company.
---
While I would like to be patient and see what CCP is coming up with, I‘m afraid that AT is going to end up in the category of things promised but never happened. 
---
With the more recent issues revolving EVE i can unterstand people being disgruntled because they see what happened in the past and assume what is going to happen with AT: nothing. 
---
Check a man's past before speaking so quickly
---
Ok old timer - remember when horses didn't branch out and got replaced by cars (new tech substitution) never forget
---
Yeah the game enabled people that were so dumb they were free kills to become unfree kills.
---
Think on your post for a moment. If you’re a genuine free kill then you’ve gotta be either really dumb or really bad. If the game was changed to enable you to be *not a free kill* and you stay as retarded as you always were then the game just got a whole lot shittier for people that don’t suffer from chromosomal disorders 
---
I don't now. The game is the same shit as always
---
Thanks dude
---
I can hear your Scot accent in the way you're typing Velsh. Glad to see you've acted as well. 
---
I tell you man, it's such a weight off your shoulders. We've reeee'd all we can; it's time to move on. 
---
Nerf buffs and buff nerfs
---
That would make sense for AT as people practice in those teams for months.  But I find it hard to believe that people only play Eve for the events.  If so, I encourage them to check out the rest of the game before they rage quit.
---
It was very fun. 
---
initially he has passed this tradition to me but i am sure he will be happy to see that more and more people are committed (✿´‿`)
---
&gt;The cancer that is Supers jumping on anything and everything bigger than a BC gang is the death of Eve.
---
They jump on any cruiser tbh, and not just a gang of cruisers, 1 will do for some lols. Such low risk. and even with the risk they don't care to lose it
---
ELIaP?
---
Finally doing it ! Feels so good man. 
---
Let's keep contact on discord shall we 
---
hope they read all the salty thread too
---
&gt; in the process tore the very essence of what made eve special
---
Injectors/extractors did this it's true.  Also PLEX to an extent as it made the game FTP provided you logged in to earn enough to cover a sub.  
---
I'd rather the game had 6k players than 40k.  I remember when it was 2.5k average.  It's too late now but I'd quite like another shard for the hardcore - no injectors, no extractors, no PLEX.  Everyone starts from scratch.  Complete wipe :p.
---
Thanks Malaka, thanks for the good laughs on comms 
---
Furries are the walking equivalent to cancer.
---
The lack of balance in terms of capital oriented PvP and the apparent desire to create a 'safer' and less aggressive environment in general has annoyed a lot of people for one thing.
---
CCP focusing on mining over PvP. Fine, everyone plays how they want of course, but in the long run what is the point of mining and building up funds if the citadel spam and sov system is so broken that wars are too tedious for anyone to bother doing. I mean, asset safety ffs. Can you imagine if that was in the game from the beginning? Take that shit out. Remove insurance from all capital ships.
---
Half finished features or ideas. Tiericide? Faction warfare dead? Pirate structures only for 2 of the main 4 pirate groups? Resource wars pointless? Abyss underwhelming? Npc haulers in high sec pointless? CCP ignores all of that and adds new skins or more replica events. Finish the features that have been started ffs.
---
I remember when I started playing the dev updates were good. Even if the content/balance etc shown wasn't great at least the video accompanying it was entertaining (I distinctly remember one of the first dev blog vids I saw showing a dev at their desk with only a condom and a gun next to their monitor and remember thinking damn they really aren't pandering to casual kids here are they). Now? Well pulse is back which is ok...except they just repeat the "we are fighting bots, report bots" mantra. To me it shows the different direction the company is taking.
---
CCP don't seem to realise that the playerbase isn't calling out for new things. The playerbase and the game need finished features. It needs a look back at rebalancing existing aspects of the game every now and then after having some time go see how the recent content additions have impacted them.
---
Every dev update etc is about new content nobody wants (e.g. abyss), new skins, new events... I can guarantee the positive reaction if there was a big dev blog saying "we are going to spend the next few months revisiting old content, ideas, balance etc" would be phenomenal and would convince players to come back.
---
But nah lol just add new skins and make new events, ignore the half completed stuff and balance
---
you can have next week friend (◕‿◕✿)
---
its called high sec
---
get fucked &lt;3
---
This, is a name I haven't seen in a long time. Glad to see you're still around Nerapa
---
Because some people are rich enough to be able to fit a retarded fit and dont care about it when losing it.
---
You see, but the Aegis Sov system is going to help the small guy fight the big buy, it's going to descentralize the wars and generate even more content. ^(/s)
---
i love pixel spaceships
---
As I said, I did that, left some remarks. If you want to stop arguing about this topic, just stop. There is no locator agent for reddit accounts so you wouldn't have to be worried about me coming for ya. 
---
They hard coded the maximum number of items on the New Eden Store and going to a 64bit client will double the number of items they can list at one time
---
BuT aT PiLoTS aRe tHe mOsT eLiTe PiLoTS iN eVe
---
Well let's get them outta the way.
---
•Eve is dying (change my mind or something of that sort here)
---
•I'm a new player should I return/is the game still good?
---
•Ummm...
---
•Rorquals are op ccplease
---
•Carriers are op... should we just remove caps from the game?
---
•Grrr - goons - test - pl - gotg - in fact grrr all alliances.
---
Oh one that is honestly worth while...
---
•ccp is not hosting an alliance tournament this year after promising their changes wouldn't effect it. I'm sure lady years player commentary had some decision making involved with that as ccp clearly decided they didnt want a community team cause who needs community right?
---
Am I missing anything?
---
get fucked you to &lt;3
---
Do you know why you are so angry and wrote this post all dramatic etc. Y'all take this shit to seriously. It is a game! If you aren't having fun then simply don't play it.. don't throw a temper tantrum like a child and scream and kick on the way out.  People get upset when they lose shit in game, that to me says you didn't have enough fun getting it to begin with. People get upset out of game  I think they had a little too much fun at some point and then it became more than just fun with space friends.
---
I am still very sad to see the event in its current state... But ccp has finally reached us in the feedback treat in forum and I'm now hopefull for the event to still me salvaged and to it's second week being enjoyable and rewarding ^-^
---
overall, I still believe in ccp and eve. xD
---
They will give you one but instead of it requiring LO it'll require plex. #CCSellout
---
I will miss Goryn Clade killing me :( Hopefully someone other than CCP makes another single shard space pixel game soon.
---
Well fuck, I think it’s ccps fault there’s no air in space... Got to be mad at them about something, right?
---
about 200 i think
---
&gt; Why aren't the null empires in constant wars, if loss doesn't mean anything anymore?
---
The outcome of a conflict is a forgone conclusion in many circumstances because the focus of inter alliance conflict has shifted so heavily towards smashing raw numbers against one another - this (raw pilot count) is the only meaningful figure in the entire game. 
---
Most fights - especially in “war” - are so obviously decided from their beginning that it’s just boring for people at the top. And because it’s boring people don’t want to do it. Test, for example, went home from a northern campaign to hamstring PHORDE in order to rescue their pets from subcap fights because (in my opinion) they realized that almost fight would follow the exact same script of dying to supers and titans and it just wasn’t worth trying in that situation. 
---
The flip side of that is they lost 600~b in dreads and thats a hilariously small figure to many nullsec alliances now
---
I LOVE IT! SOO NICE!
---
Can you give me some stuff?
---
Don't be so rude dude (✿◠‿◠)
---
Eve works fine, at least a ship do not cost 1k$ and it is not a 12 yo Alpha that cost 200M$ to players.
---
I mean, you're free to try. The only people who have the access to get that done is the Imperium, though, and we are disinclined to bring back the dole.
---
Baited on a free atron. I signed off like 20 min before this happened and was kicking myself. Sad. 
---
EvE went from a game, to a way for CCP to squeeze every IRL isk out of players to pay back their investors for their failed projects.
---
is that a code: lyoko + ada lovelace reference (◕‿◕✿)
---
I believe that post was a question.
---
Histrionic fits, basically. The grown ass adult version of taking one's ball and going home. Witness the result of a complete, self-inflicted lack of agency!
---
Maybe the biggest lie ever sold by CCP and desperately championed by a bunch of newbies led by the truly stupidest leadership ever seen. 
---
CCP thanks you for your support.
---
The day that happens r/eve will colapse.
---
&gt; No. They're more similar to stations. 
---
but worse.
---
&gt; Stations with a POS shield.
---
Which you can enter and do whatever you please as if it's yours.
---
&gt; That you can cyno on top of.
---
and have no shield(tether) for anything incoming
---
&gt; That you can immediately dock in.
---
There is a delay that allows tackle, and unlike stations, you can't dock while tackled, making citadels stupidly unsafe.
---
&gt; That have a damage cap. 
---
qq cant kill it with solo bombless bomber
---
&gt; Which you can remotely remove assets from via asset safety.
---
For a cost of a subcap fleet.
---
&gt; Which can be spammed endlessly with essentially zero consequence or restriction.
---
Except there's no point to it.
---
&gt; They're a lot different than POSes.
---
POSes are a lot better, even botters use them and not those silly unsafe citadels, despite having access to stupid amount of ISK and being able to afford anything.
---
can I buy a team tag from "TeamLiquid" then to put on my Rorqual?
---
Lies, Kiki did it say more than 3.
---
dont do it
---
I've never seen a community being so unanimously being against a game company's idea. Also the Hilmar hate, Jesus.
---
Can I join in?
---
all meta abyss ships atm are expensive AF compared to normal TQ standards though, so if you actually manage to stalemate you should be able to reimburse your loss + get a fat extra payout.
---
examples of good/meta abyss pvp fits (+ mostly mid-grade-set and 5% damage implants making the pod another bil)

\*grabs pitchfork\*
---
a part of this is true
---
I'll be honest - despite all the issues (which I do acknowledge) - none of the issues have really effected me yet. 
---
     
---
In fact I just tried exploration again after a few years, and I think they've greatly improved that aspect of the game.
---
    
---
And.. I know lots of people don't like The Agency - but I actually kind of enjoy it.
---
My only big complaint is mining. Its so bleeding boring. I have no idea how to fix it.. but.. I dunno, I find it mind numbing.
---
Just my 2cents :)
---
He seems to be pretty dedicated to Orca-Pvp ^^
---
I guess he uses it as his mobile gank-headquarter and wants to be able to reship or having ships for his friends / alts ready? And either has enough isk to not care about it or just forgets or doesn't have the time to put them on a station...
---
They didn't. Because it's not to do with funding, except in the tinfoil crazed minds of some.
---
Is that including links too?
---
*Insert "Yo mamma so big" joke
---
Funny, cause using extractors, you gave a last money boost to them, instead of just leave the char as it is and them not getting that plex money.
---
So funding then.
---
"you wanna get fired in two years?" 
---
"sign up with CCP games!"
---
What effort have you put into finding out?
---
can you show me your fancy hat collection  (◕‿◕✿) 
---
&gt;If they want to see what the player base thinks/wants they just have to come here
---
Really? You *really*  think that relying on whoever is yelling the loudest in r/eve would be a useful or reliable method of determining development priorities and goals?
---
not a login music - but a great tribute to the original EVE music and the old Aura.
---
[Above the Asteroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxzXBDeSHc)
---
looks pretty simple, he probes out mission runners, kills their MTUs, or loots their stuff, they start shooting him. He, together with the NPCs or sometimes with friends, kill him.
---
I have mixed felling about the new exploration puzzle. The first time is a nice feature. But after 100 times....
---
StainGuy pls.
---
He's gotten miners to aggress him too somehow. Mining salt I bet too. I will say it looks like he's very isk negative as far as ganking. Each one of those he loses seems to be around 3B and he loses one a month at least. From his KB it doesn't look like he quite makes out.
---
My god you're dumb.
---
Think on your post for a moment: if you cannot get a free kill now, you've gotta be either really dumb or really bad. The game enables you to get free kills more than ever, and you still can't get it? Well, sucks to be you.
---
The game was designed so anyone wishing to do pve in it was a free kill and it is still a free kill, in fact more free than ever. Despite that fact, missing chromosome people who do that "roam" thing consider getting free kill "pvp" (while running from every real pvp attempt like a cat which wrapped itself in a plastic bag and shat itself). With removed safety of station after introduction of utterly unsafe citadels, getting free kills have never been so easy, yet there's you who can't do even that?
---
my name? no...it's a combination of ancient roman and old english. (◕‿◕✿)
---
aelia is ancient roman which means "sun" and i got lovelace from old english to mean "outlaw/lawless". (✿◠‿◠)
---
i'm just glad to see the tradition being kept (✿◠‿◠)
---
I tried a burner mission. Got completely savaged in my lame Kestrel. I decided it was not worth purchasing a 300M Isk ship to try again.
---
Maybe when I am a trillionaire I will come back to it.
---
No, they just finished. All bugs are fixed and balance has been perfected. Time to move on to something else. 
---
(◕‿◕✿) (✿◠‿◠) (◕‿◕✿) (✿◠‿◠) (◕‿◕✿) (✿◠‿◠)

i'm so happy you found your first friend (◕‿◕✿)
---
&gt;He's gotten miners to aggress him too somehow.
---
maybe stealing from containers
---
going out with your bud on beer? 
---
CCP thanks you for your support. 
---
+1 on Warframe.  No lootboxes.  Initial learning curve is semi-steep, but nothing that an Eve player can't handle.  Space ninjas.
---
All items can be purchased w/o real money.  Also, any money you do spend actually lasts a long time.  
---
The thing is EvE is NOT a regular game. A lot of people commit a lot of time and dedication to this game. There is so much to do out of game to be successfull at this game therefor people have an attachment and I understand the hurt feelings when what they've worked so hard for is being threatened.
---
It's a game but not your average game...
---
Either way, seems pretty fun.
---
"Working On", "Balance"
---
Nice write up :)
---
Im not a new player, but just this past week I decided to try my hand at WH exploration and relic sites.
---
The first challenge I've encountered is trying to figure out a bookmarking convention that is both as clean as possible while still being as informative as possible.
---
I am also trying to decide which of the several WH chain mapping tools are best to use.
---
Anyone have any advice on either of those issues?
---
Thanks! o7
---
Almost the same with me:
---
&gt; And ~~despite~~ because of the overall negativity around I like this new EVE 
---
nice try, Hillmar
---
It's not just you.  Still having a blast.  Been playing off and on since launch.  I think too many people let Eve define who they are, literally. 
---
No one said anything about yelling the loudest, however maybe you weren’t here during monocle gate and all that nonsense. There are plenty of idea and qol threads on here that aren’t shit posting. Before they made the new official forums atrocious and modded to death people would use the idea and feature section on there to post ideas. CSM is not needed for development and priorities.ccp knows what the community wants to see more/less of. Like I said before, they’re going to do what they want regardless of csm input or our input. I’ve been playing this game for near 15 years and that’s always the case. Hell a lot of members in the past have just been someone popular from a null alliance aka a popularity contest and not actually have any real ideas anyway. There are great members like suitonia, but guess where you see a lot of his ideas posted.....reddit. 
---
Page is called CCPlease not StainGuy pls.         
---
You should check it!        
---
I think you're spot on here.  I'm relatively new but it has always seemed off to me that resources in a region are infinite and predictable.
---
If a region is being constantly hammered by a player made empire why isn't there some sort of depletion mechanic?  Ore belts getting smaller or longer to respawn in heavily farmed systems.  Force players to spread out a little more in their space, force defence fleets to be spread thinner or deal with multiple attack vectors.
---
thats ok friend :)
---
Just another wave.  Eve has been slowly changing for years as players get older, SP becomes irrelevant, wallets become fat, etc.   Drama queens here on reddit like to claim the sky is falling every time something bad happens.  I was actually surprised that so many people had characters to biomass after they all claimed that abyssal modules were going to ruin the game. 
---
Anveri is a raging homosexual and a weeblord. He introduced the weeb corruption to odins call ny creating a hentai channel. Obviously he tried to leak loli shit to general, but was stopped by anti weeb crusaders.
---
I seccond that!
---
The most usual ship used to run those are T3Cs, either Loki or Tengu; the problem with the sites is that they are in lowsec and you'll probably be pointed most of the time by the NPCs.
---
On the other hand, the best loot is the BPC for a specific lowsec structure rig, since there are easier ways to get Gila BPCs.
---
Can i have some of the stuff you are taking?            
---
I feel that my posting is bit down lately. 
---
If you explore in a single constellation in nullsec, any anoms you clear will respawn in that constellation. This definitely helps with normal relic sites, although I’m not completely sure that ghost sites always respawn in the same constellation 
---
IIRC there were a lot less anoms per system back then too
---
Trahis post I gold, and so true. Fucking ccp only wanting sheep pve fags to play eve 
---
Not sure if you are high as a kite or just stupid...
---
You don't tell me what to do!
---
Can you send your stuff to StainGuy? Have a small construction project and need a lot of stuff for it.      
---
Based on CCP own words it will prove that CONCORD is actually a concord. 
---
What an ungrateful asshole- you've enjoyed the game for years. Leave with grace, thank ccp and gimme your isk! Lol
---
Do not ask CCP for a lowsec gate to Stain.        
---
I repeat DO NOT ASK CCP FOR A LOWSEC GATE TO STAIN!          
---
&gt;No one said anything about yelling the loudest, however maybe you weren’t here during monocle gate and all that nonsense.
---
Uh yeah I kind of was
---
&gt; CSM is not needed for development and priorities.ccp knows what the community wants to see more/less of.
---
Wrong and wrong. I know these from direct personal experience; you only have shouty forum narrative and poorly focused disappointment to go on.
---
&gt;Hell a lot of members in the past have just been someone popular from a null alliance aka a popularity contest and not actually have any real ideas anyway.
---
For example you've picked up this particularly stupid bit of truthiness.
---
Sry all charcters have been given away :(
---
Well for one, no one is going to make an alternative to Eve Online by themselves just because they're mad at CCP. 
---
Now watch it never happen!
---
I agree 100% with you that it's not a regular game and I do understand that it takes hours, day,  weeks or even years to accomplish some things in this game but if someone is not having fun. The answer is simply not to play and do something else that you enjoy. And if they are true friendships they will last. Eve is a game filled with mostly adults. We all know this. But as adults we also tend to get stuck on things and wish for nostalgia and change when in reality it's not feasible. 
---
I'm guilty of it just the same. Not being pot calling the kettle. But it took awhile for me to learn that leason and now that I have man oh man is the game fun again. And a few other games are too! Just this week I have went on fleets, been ganked, ganked another person and gave away a ship that a year ago I would have been pissed to lose.
---
Have a healthier mentally has just made gaming even better in game and out. We just have to remember why we play. 
---
Yeah don't listen to the reee brigade. They did it about Pearl abyss and they did it about the abyssal rng. Nothing changed, no one left, they're all just crappy people
---
Before 2009 they wouldnt even respawn back into system constantly :) 
---
Cap guns to kill battleships with proper bookmarks they have 0 transveral and get insta blapped you keep two haw to refit for cruisers.
---
You create bms for every site https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8lgoce/c5_dread_escalations_a_mild_guide/ shows you where

---
Can show you the damage you need to tank.
---
You don't recall the absolute outrage that "F1-pushing femtobrained nullbab spodmonkeys" should presume to attack a wormhole group? That's odd, because I recall it pretty clearly.
---
I am surprised y'all are acting like impetulant children. 
---
Oh wait, it is /r/eve. No I am not.
---
Your jedi mind tricks will not work on me.
---
This is a very good synopsis IMHO.
---
More reeeeee-ing and fake "I'm leaving" bs just like all the other times
---
It is. Just like eve it also has something for every walk of player :) 
---
Are you afraid to step out of the line?
---
That's why carebears roll everything before carebearing there, making it even safer. Remove rolling?
---
please dont give me a crazy amount of downvotes because im simply asking out of curiousity.   
---
why is a 64 bit client a bad thing?   
---
i've barely played eve before but thinking about getting in to it. spaceships are fun!
---
Move to a wormhole and do PI much better planets.
---
What is stupid about it?
---
I thinought you were kinda lowballing the numbers there but to be fair most alliances have an off-TZ so yeah that's about right
---
CCP Falcon do you see how creative players can be ? He is totally not suggesting to CCP a way to remove posting from /r/eve.
---
I realise my error :(
---
It seems that things are constantly going downhill :/
---
When I started playing Eve 12 years ago I would play “Welcome to the Jungle” as I logged in.
---
Now, it’s the theme to Barney.
---
*This is not **THE GATE** you are looking for* 
---
Let thumbs up /  down do their work or rip mr nazi
---
Target painting range, but not lock range...
---
I stream on the CCP channel.  I did a month of PvP on the CCP and my own channel and got fewer viewers than wormhole exploration and constantly stream sniped when on CCP.  Maybe I suck at PvP. Doesn't matter either way.  Not worth it to me. So, if you want to watch PvP on the CCP channel, go watch it when it's up there.
---
I still remember the days of Burn Eden showing up in their fucking torp ravens and just murdering anything that tried to catch them.
---
Of course this was years before missiles were changed when the proper way to survive missiles in a small ship was to outrun them.
---
Wormhole space is thriving. Ex-bitter vets who joined my corp are saying this is the best time they've had playing eve, ever.
---
Everyone is generally very happy, good are encouraging they're friends to leave null sec and join wormholes.
---
Small gang is alive and well. Thera is especially fun because it allows us to roam everywhere. 
---
Eve is thriving.
---
Zkill doesn’t show ransoms. And stop being a Goofus and only focusing on isk. A Gallant remembers that Eve is a game and should be fun. 
---
Sad indeed
---
It bounces off the signal and turns everyone into gay frogs. 
---
Yes, it's another meaningless reeee. It's hilarious to watch people lie about leaving the game because ccp cancelled at, even though these guys don't even play or watch the at.
---
It's just stupid and entitled assholes on /eve as usual. Ignore them, game is doing great
---
Why would I leave my corp/alliance?  They're the only reason I've played this dumb game this long.
---
Finally someone that gets it
---
I don't focus on isk lol but that would be hard to sustain :P Maybe not. Still, seems like some fun.
---
Paint me like one of your French girls!
---
customs office cost a lot in resources to set up &amp; high sec planets generally don’t make enough to justify spending so much 
---
Move to Null better PI and better planets, easier logistics and probably you will sell all stuff locally. 
---
Well said.
---
Wardec the asshole and blow it up, put your own in place... 
---
I fucking love this game. It's an awesome release in terms of "fucking up someone else's day gives me a mild euphoria"
---
I agree but not to spite CCP. Just do this because it’d be fun and this is a game. 
---
Find another way to spite CCP 
---
Most these players don't make decisions, it's a rather small group of FC's and other leadership that set coalition policy. 
---
They can easily create a culture where killing the majority of content in your region is a seen as bad. 
---
More importantly the have the military power to force such a policy onto other groups. 
---
Ironically this is effectively why wormhole space still has such a fighting culture, because groups with the military power choice to keep it that way, and any group with a content kill policy will quickly see themselves isolated and likely evicted (because the health of wormhole space is more important to all of US then small advantages over 1 and other). 
---
You'd need to dec the owner, bash each of them with like 2-3 oracles twice and then deploy your own. This is assuming that the owner doesn't respond. You might be able to do this in one of the more quiet systems, but even then it's possible that someone will just come and take them from you.
---
Therefore you'd need a few alt accounts or a few friends and those friends might want a cut of whatever profits you get as well. Just wanted to point this out to you since you said you're new.
---
Well, maybe we'll get something next month when EVEsterdam is happening. I bet there will be allot of questions and hopefully allot of answers. 
---
I can fuel it with complex organism - not an issue.      
---
Sansha Nation is bringing hundreds thousands of those on a weekly basis.        
---
Like 1/4th is rejected after initial processing. 
---
Yeah man, most people don't give a fuck about at. Literally less than 50 people play eve of of 19,000+. 
---
It's just a small but vocal minority of the reee brigade. They did this about Pearl abyss and they did this about abyssal rng modules. But nothing bad happened and all those reee people suddenly forgot they were being apoplectic dicks for no reason.
---
It's a cycle on /eve. Just ignore it and enjoy the game like most eve players.
---
Eve itself. I miss it.
---
I am not sure what you are talking about...
---
I’m not convinced that small groups even risk Rorq mining that much.
---
The increase in ore respawn time may be a step in the right direction though.  Truth be told, I really have no solid ideas on how to help solve this.
---
Ishtar.
---
Warp at 100km.
---
Drop sentries.
---
On final wave recall sentries, drop heavies.
---
Burn to the spawn while finishing NPC + structure. 
---
Loot.
---
Repeat.
---
You may be tackled only by the final wave. Also hunters rarely warp at 100km when they intend to tackle the ratting ship. 
---
Shhhh!  Don’t tell anyone this!  I’m about to go WH diving.
---
Why not start small by undocking in groups of &lt;50 in subcap ships and doing some NPSI skirmishing?
---
&gt; My greatest respect was for groups like Burn Eden, BoB, GHSC, the old CVA/Provi-Bloc etc who actually built a reputation on their own values and unique achievements in game rather than all simply buddying up to blob out the competition and become stagnant, bloated, professionals of playing the game like its a day in the office.
---
Utter revisionist bullshit going on.
---
I've seen him in action first hand.  He's one of my HS Heroes.  He's got two major tactics:  either he'll go suspect and have an alt/friend proclaim they're hunting him and request support only to kill the white knight.  Or he finds MTUs on active missions, and you seen how well that turns out - https://zkillboard.com/kill/74212785/ .  
---
Yes
---
Yup, if you got caught in a botting super it way bye bye accoutn you worked hard on to skill up. Now it's just oh I got banned? Pff.. "makes new account and inject skills from botted together skill injectors. Buys new super from isk made with botting" Now where was I.... 
---
UP vote for doing what you said you were going to do.
---
Yes. Burn. It. All
---
Prepare to get slammed with down votes, smh. 
---
I was going to ask if the EvE universe had Gender Studies majors in the future, and are they as useless there as here.  Silly question I know
---
&gt;Going to try Stellaris out  
---
thats funny, i got this game last week and some change ago and im almost at the 100 hour mark, its my first ever 4K strategy game, and ive never played a strategy game beforehand either so i have 3 save games before this where i absolutely got stomped either on resource management or not being able to keep up with fleet production/replacement...but a few days ago i got into a sweet spot, i expanded early and fast and efficiently, intelligently put my jump bridges in key systems (thanks eve) and finally figured out the war dec system...the end game crisis just hit last night, i have to retrofit my entire armada, but once thats done im in a good place with over 1000 fleet force, or w/e that metric is called again  
---
super different game than eve obviously, but at least in stellaris i have 5 whole titans :&gt;
---
Eve 2 Unreal ?
---
Less fun, more loot boxes, plus guaranteed redundancy packages!
---
The only thing that impacts me personally and rides on me after a while is the failed projects that apparently Eve has funded for CCP instead of investing some of that back into Eve.
---
Do drifters count as a gender?
---
The idea that every single player thinks the same way, that this shitty subreddit represents the majority of the playerbase opinions and/or the fact that you think that what you are saying is even remotely possible.
---
And if this was a troll or bait attempt, it was a seriously bad one.
---
Thought this was going to be FrankTheBank losing dread yesterday.
---
Why should I fuck over my friends, because I disagree what ccp does?
---
Is the reason why I see tons of quitting threads because this tournament thing was cancelled? I say that in pure ignorance, I never had a chance to get into it. thx
---
You are not wrong, but this just shows how deep in the shithole the game has gone.
---
No, we said you were retarded for saying it was a fight against the odds. 
---
It isn't all just about you - its about everyone else aswell. If everyone keeps qutting because their playstyle is removed or fucked up that is less content for everyone. Its about making the game fun for everyone, not just appealing to a type of player.
---
In additon, the less people who come around hunting people and making fights the bigger the krabfest and the less destruction. Reducing the game to just farming to have 100+ people fight is very depressing, and not exciting for a lot of people.
---
The question becomes "Is that region any more plentiful than any other region?" There was nothing stopping PL or NC or GOTG or anyone else for that matter from doing what they did. There is nothing special about Delve, they made it special. That same path was and still is available to everyone else in the game. Everyone is a ways behind right now, but so were they when they moved to Delve.
---
Fare thee well. Wish we had gotten to know you longer.
---
Just want to say too: if this is truly a 'weight' off your shoulders, then perhaps EVE was more of an addiction for you and less of a game. I'm not judging, just commenting. I hope you pursue what brings you joy. o7
---
Just sell it on the bazaar. Then donate the isk. No way to recover from that
---
Breadcrumbs, mostly.
---
Im a newbro since october, and this is the best game I have ever played. Subbed two days after registering as an alpha.
---
However I would like a smaller galaxy. There are so many empty systems in null, it would be much better if they cut some of it off and let the players compete for the remains. But I guess that would be hard. Certain alliances losing sov while certain alliances get to keep sov
---
Kill kill kill
---
Fake news. 
---
it´s a process. By killing the AT, probably most of the AT focused groups that train months for said event will quit the game leading to less people actually playing. 
---
My first t2 ship, a cheetah, dropped connection while in warp when taking it out for the first time and when i signed back in I found it was killed by guristas at the gate, with ~250m loot in cargo bay. 
---
So, im a PVP streamer, that did/can stream on CCP.
---
They have nothing against PVP streamers, i could stream on that channel at any point.
---
Streaming on CCP is a double edged sword however, Streamsniping is even more common, though that could be a good thing with how hard it is to find actual content nowdays.
---
but then you do reach a larger audience :)
---
Honestly, im just finding it hard to do solo pvp anymore. its either capitals, loki's, hornet ec's or a gang with falcons and logi. So ive been taking a break from eve, see if the spark comes back in me to do it all again.
---
TL:DR. There are PVP streamers on CCP, we're just lazy, or taking a break.
---
What exactly is biomassing though? Is there a delete character button I missed?
---
Yeah...I have a sudden urge to live in a WH again now... Last time I did that was back in 2012.
---
We have better GPU s now? The game was so pretty...
---
I mean, good on him for doing that, but if your main only has 80m skill points, I still think of you as a noob. 
---
Tbh I haven't even made it that far yet.   Im still stuck on getting my WH travel protocols down first. And practicing my scanning…  I guess I will find out soon enough
---
What gender are aliens? Or is it rude to assume that they even have a gender?
---
It was the old CCP that made the game we enjoyed.  It is the new CCP (and now their overlords at PA) who are making the game that is driving its own customers away far faster than new customers are signing up.
---
This will lead to reduced effort and increased monetization.  Same as always happens in situations like this.  EVE did not keep pace with the times.  So it is being left behind.
---
Did the same. Jan last year I extracted and gave 26b away and then 3 months later started anew. Dont give everything away. 
---
Fuck sake you people.  COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO WORK ON MORE THAN ONE GAME.
---
No plex means more RMT, which isn’t good for anyone 
---
&gt; no one left
---
yea no one is leaving...

Can I have your stuff (and skill injectors)? Have fun playing that alternative title to EVE on the market currently! What is it called? \*crickets\* 
---
Dont tell me all hundreds and thousands of members of large alliances are friends. That would be boring as hell. And if everyone you are playing with is your friend, by all means keep playing with them.
---
I’ve had some decent drops from these but honestly they are very few and far between. Usually my best drops have been omega implants, etc.
---
This is pretty damn awesome. I've seen what looks like a guy using 4 or 5 accounts with alpha nados off gates hitting DSTs. Also hitting anything that's bling fit too. All things I'm considering.
---
I wonder how many people put in fake applications saying stop making shit products stop being retarded start hiring good devs for game design.
---
If the HS route contains Uedama and Niarja, there is also a (longer) route, which avoids both. For [Amarr-Dodixie](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/route/2:Amarr:Dodixie:-Uedama) that's 35 jumps instead of 17, for other routes it's not that bad (e.g. Amarr-Hek 27 - 21)
---
For bashing POCOs, you can use super cheap Vexors full afk. Fit Meta DDAs, a set of T1 drones, maybe some meta 1 pulse lasers with T1 ammo. Put 2-4 of them on a POCO, go to sleep. Next morning either your Vexors or the POCO are dead. The insurance covers your losses almost completely. You can use Alphas if you want to keep your killboard green.
---
I didn't say he should welp his ratting/exploration ships into fleets of damnations and guardians every time he sees anyone. There's a lot of difference between that and "I notice that you never once discuss PVPing in your original post; you just say to dock/run/hide every time you even suspect trouble."
---
&gt; Except there's no point to it.
---
Big brain comments.
---
Wormholes would be great if they weren't filled with wormholers.
---
Biomassing is effectively deleting your character yes. 
---
I still think that EVE is the best game in town (pun intended)  for what it is and is trying to do.  As a student of Game Theory - it seems to me that most if not all the other MMORPGs out there are finite whereas EVE is infinite.  In terms of in EVE the goal is to keep the game going as long as possible doing things of interest whereas other's guide you and hold your hand along a storyline that eventually comes to an end. EVE can only be judged by playability - not REplayability. 
---
I've thought many a time about getting a gang together just to try and pop him (weird that in this game we sometimes want to kill our heroes, lol).  He has at least two Basilisk to support his ops sometimes, and with his brick fit, it would be a fun fight.
---
I personally have used only Pathfinder. I like it, I just think it's too much for solo. Even if you are running several alts in same corp it's much easier to just follow the bookmarks.
---
Regarding the bookmarking, here is what has worked for me for years - I always mark my exit as 'WH Exit'. I save every wormhole with it's appropriate type and class. E.g. 'WH Q003 - NS', or 'WH B274 - HS', or 'WH O477 - C3', or 'WH X877 - C4' etc. I also save K162s according to their description, i.e. 'WH K162 - C1-C3', 'WH K162 - C4-C5', 'WH K162 - LS' etc.
---
Once you save a bookmark for WH B274 - HS, next time you see it you don't have to go and check what type of WH it is, as soon as you start bookmarking it and type WH B274, it will popup the list of what you have already saved before and you can clearly see the class of WH it is connected to.
---
This has been super helpful for me, when I was just learning ropes of WH mechanics. And it still works now, when I come across some rare WH, like the Drifter one, which I probably have seen less than 10 times in my life.
---
I like the game. The toxicity is really real though. So much “muh pvp” but they keep flying cheap ships. I remember a time losing a ship was a great cut in your savings. 
---
Just all the people pissing on everything annoys the shit out of me. If only they would put their efford into the actual game and stop complaining about everything or only caring about zkill. Then again, most people complaining either lost their way of having fun or cant adapt to the “new” eve. 
---
&gt;and they shift damage to your biggest resist holes
---
They don't, it's a meme.

---
The main reason to run them is various rare implents (virtues, crystals etc) and the chance for prototype jump drive economizer (5-run)/ prototype hyperspatial economizer blueprints (10run), both worth about 1B.
---
A lot of people run then in Tengus, although I've seen Gilas and Lokis too. I have a cheap dual-xlasb torpedo Raven that works pretty well.
---
Basically the same “muh pvp” and “supercap/rorqual” bullshit as ever. Oh and “eve is dying”. Did I forget to mention “ccpls”?
---
Then persuade your whole corp to do it.
---
They said we'd get a dedicated balance team, too. It's not worth a lot.
---
Watching the continuous stream of absolutely ridiculous investment gambles CCP has made (and failed at) over the years, it honestly kind of surprises me that they have lasted this long.
---
Imagine what the game could have been had they actually invested their profits in the game rather than whatever retarded project caught their fancy that morning.
---
No no no, its not to spite CCP. Its to spice things up.
---
Interesting. Never saw that button before.
---
Use t1 laser crystals, never need to reload.
---
This is all good and well but most Eve players are just sheeple. Eve is in a near full state of PvE currently, the mass majority are not interested in PvP sadly. Everybody has been made to feel like they HAVE to strive towards Supers and Titans. Some of this blame lies on CCP but mostly on Alliance leaders that just want to be King of the hill. The end game is taking the joy out of Eve, not CCP. Forget the Capitals, focus on Subcaps and you will have far more fun. FC can I bring a drake?
---
Skill points don‘t matter. Skill does.
---
Well, I do believe there is a lot of people who would like to do something new in the game. There is an opportunity.
---
&gt;. This game has been around for 15 years and may yet be here for another 15. You're closing a door that you may want to 
---
A-fucking-men. To me, "I extracted/biomassed my character hrrr..." is like cutting off your dick because you are having a rough patch with your significant other. 
---
You sure showed them, until 6 months from now when you've made up and decide you want to have sex again. 
---
Oh shit, looks like they fired the guy who had the passwords to the accidental biomass undoer.
---
Sorry, Goonwaffe doesn't provide enough PAPs-per-member to survive anywhere else.
---
Interesting that you were given a minimum number of hours you had to stream. Or is that what you believed? Sure, it's said that some people like to have a consistent weekly schedule of ~2 hours a week. But there was and is no mention of it being required. 
---
id rather play a different genre than a game that is shit and is owned by a company that doesnt care about anything other than fleecing every penny it can from its playerbase. I heard apex legends is pretty good :)
---
Good for you, I suppose. I recently re-subscribed but it was a much harder decision than last time. Still feel as though there's a bunch of things I haven't tried in the game, so I hesitate to walk away. 
---
But I've definitely dialed back my game time, focusing on specific new ships to try different things. In a way, it's the beginning of the end for me since I'll eventually attempt and exhaust my preferred options for game play. What would keep me here are player-focused activities such as AT. Luckily I'm in a large corp with decent activities, but I fear even that won't keep me here forever.
---
Hope you find another game you enjoy, or some other hobby to make you happy, OP.
---
The northern alliances hold a far greater amount of space. And I never said that Delve is special per se. Almost every region could probably support close to 50k players with a bit of active management. And that is the problem. When you can comfortably grow in your region, why invade others? By allowing for this degree of condensation, CCP takes the reason for conflict away.
---
I enjoy shit talking in local, but am cognizant of opsec. FC what do?
---
Nanoribbons are collateral of the farming in wh space... High class wormholes drop way too many nanoribbons and it flooded the market until they were worth nothing. Ccp should remove all nanoribbons from c5 and c6 space, as that would barely touch income, but make lower class wh space income grow significantly.
---
I remember when I first started in wormholes in a c2, if I had a site with 2 nanoribbons, it would more than double that site's payout. Now those 2 ribbons wouldn't even make 10% bonus. 
---
My understanding is that only about 200 million is the offer and the other 200-225 million is only if CCP hits a certain agreed upon bench march regarding revenu and player numbers by a certain date. 
---
They have not officially forked over 425Million to Hillmar yet...
---
Awesome!  Ty :-) I will give pathfinder a try.  As well as your bookmarking protocol.  Thanks again!  \o/  o7
---
With it setup the way it is, we go live on the CCP channel at our leisure. It works well for some people that don't/didn't already have a huge following. Besides the constant confusion that we are in fact CCP employees, as is kind of hinted at in the OP by /u/Magalaus . Unless it's stating it's a CCP stream, it's most likely a player streamer anyway and with the amount of stream sniping that happens on the "big stage" of the CCP channel, it's easier to just do PVE there and move to PVP on your own with less exposure/risk of direct counters.
---
But where did peral abyss bring the ccp employees to?
---
Thanks for clearing that up! The damage shifting worried me since my armor skills (for the reactive armor hardener) aren't quite up to par yet
---
^ this. IRL is kicking some people down atm, others are just taking a break. Some haven't streamed eve in a while and are doing other things on their own channel. 
---
&gt; Not really true. 
---
It was literally true. 
---
I'm not ragging on you. I specifically complimented you. I just also happened to include a factual observation about your OP, that you only ever discuss PVP in the context of avoiding it. 
---
You're elaborating here a in this reply here, but you can't say "it's not really true that I always seem to avoid PVP" when the only times you ever mention PVP in your OP were when you lost some ratting ships, when you were excited to dock up and log off because you saw a bomber, when you suggested you might get into a war that ends with you being evicted if you offer to buy POCOs off someone, when you counseled against bring any PVP ships into a hole initially, and when you suggested logging off or otherwise not playing Eve any time you see a spooky hole. I can't read your mind that you actually did go after PVP sometimes; you'd need to actually put that in the post. And since you didn't, that's why I commented that you only ever seem to be trying to avoid PVP, even to the point of not playing at all because it might happen.
---
Use of my account.
---
I can't login because CCP - after a decade - decided that my email is no longer acceptable - because it contains the word "mail". They also now ban addresses containing "admin" and some other words.
---
A policy so mind-bogglingly stupid it defies credulity.
---
Even if there was any good reason to have such a restriction (somebody please explain to me what that might be), I fail to see why they wouldn't whitelist existing long-term customers (I started during the last days of beta).
---
I gave up after 2 tickets got closed with no hope of a future fix.
---
OTOH that clearly means that they have too many paying customers. That's a great problem to have admittedly.
---
*has the spod brain*
---
she has a peen, but since you are into that.... i am very happy for you both.
---
He’s technically a 4 years old noob you are correct. The kind of noob that has a passion for learning the game and trying stuff, organise it for others if he feels like something is lacking. He’s certainly not the elitest solo or small gang pvper out there (even though some of the best current players have that age or sometimes less). He will probably still kick the ass of 90% of stupid “vets” out there. So yeah just one of these noobs. Not the f1 pushing empire building posting noobs that eve is now made of. God I miss real noobs. o7 Ymenoa you’ve tried. I had a lot of fun in your tournaments even though I wouldn’t agree with the rulesets and bitch about the organisation (that you were doing all by yourself). Good job CCP. o7 frenchie. Meth.
---
30 seconds to do in a carrier
---
Then again, back in 2005 CCP was more or less a completely different team.
---
don't forget about insurance though...
---
i turned my newbro friend into a mining slave for the event sites
---
Guard is still around :) If it weren't for the player streamers, the channel would be significantly more inactive. Since there's a common confusion that just because we are streaming on the CCP channel that we are CCP. Most of what is broadcast on the channel is from other players. 
---
Does anyone know how to fix multiboxing non focused clients dropping fps?
---
When I select a client, it shoots to 300 to 500 fps. The two side clients on my other two monitors go down to 20fps.
---
When i select any other window(like chrome), all 3 clients go to 90 fps.
---
Very very odd.
---
Yes, I'm aware that I could avoid those systems, but it does not make much sense and let me explain why. First of all most of the gankers scan you right away as you undock from the trade hub. Once you get scanned every single character in the system could be gankers 'spy' just watching your route. You potentially could dock several times on the trip and just wait. Point is it's not very efficient, it's easier to risk and lose several times, but have fun and learn small tricks how to avoid it next time. I talked to my 'ganker', he said that there was other guy coming after me, as he saw me docking in one of the dead-end systems, and was hunting me down from there, it's just my 'guy' was faster to wreck me. I avoided one gate-camper in Niarja, just cloaked and slow-boated for 50km before I could warp. It takes time, and I only have several hours to play every day. You would be surprised how many alts are these guys flying around New Eden. They are smart and they are good at what they do.
---
Regarding POCOs, the ones in my system have RF timers at worst period of day for me. I wish I could just afk-bash them, but I can do that only on the weekends. 
---
No actual skill involved in eve, you don’t actually fly the ship you just click around and activate modules and you don’t even have to do it quickly.  Winning fights in eve isn’t about “being able to pilot well” it’s about knowledge of the ships your fighting and how to utilize your ship.  It’s not a skill game it’s a knowledge game.
---
It’s funny how seriously you all take something that doesn’t actually require any skill.
---
Currently rank 5 world 3v3 wow arena btw
---
This isn't the first time /eve had declared the world is ending. Nothing happens each time and rightly so: literally only 50 people play at. That's it. Out of 19000. Think about it before replying.
---
So far it's doing perfectly well
---
Sweet 
---
Lmao what its way more than 50
---
PVErs pay the bills at CCP.
---
He just said he wasn't interested in a carrier -\_-
---
80M main. Oh boy.
---
Thanks so much mate!
---
It really does seem to defy all logic that CCP is pushing updates on activity tracker, agency, events (which still are bad anyways), etc., to pretty universal complaints. Say what you will about how the vocal minority here on reddit are bittervets who don't represent a lot of Eve players... but when have you ever seen someone talking about great the activity tracker or agency window is? Praising this event? Lol.
---
And yet all the stuff the "vocal minority" here are worked up about would be received with relatively universal praise. Who would complain about citadel spam being toned down? About cap proliferation being dealt with in at least some fashion? About tiericide completion, numbers tweaks on underpowered hulls, improvements to the default UI? Hardly anyone could complain about that shit, and tons of people would be ecstatic.
---
But noooooo. We get CCPls gimmicks and trivial plex sales (plex prices are down like 2% in jita... lol) and whatever instead.
---
I have thought long and hard about it.... as requested.
---
Indeed 50 people who also are mostly small gang or content generators... maybe them leaving will have a knock of effect... who knows.
---
I am thinking of hanging up my boots; but its nothing to do with AT.  It more the fact CCP decided to make all but a handful of play styles at all viable in this game.. i know ... 'IT A SANDBOX... or IT'S A CAPITAL SHIP'.
---
sad thing is i know who your refering to without even clicking hte link.
---
yeah he's been doing that for a long time. technically it is perfectly legal how he does it.
---
but there is some discussion about the time he takes scramming you (excessive scram time).  if he continues to scram you after 2 hours, apparently you can submit a ticket to report him.
---
hello friend i noticed you have some threatening anger symbols in your post :)
---
please remove the capital letters in this thread, friend or your post may be exterminated :)
---
Shit talk in local anyway.
---
Dont let no fc tell you what to do@
---
They really just need to make an EVE 2 using the lessons they learned in EVE 1 (IE do not make endgame content so much immensely more relevant to everything then all the other content that its not worth trying at all unless you are flying a Titan or Rorq).
---
They could set it on the Terran side of the Eve Gate and if they manage to really iterate on the formula well and get people invested again they can port over the changes to EVE proper by reopening the Eve-Gate with some proper universe resetting cataclysm on the New Eden side.
---
HAHAH lOL xD gate 2 stain xDDDDDDD hahaha LOl lmao funny eve yve eve MEME ahahaha :) smile haha lol r/eve flairbaited thanks for the gold kind stranger lmao xDDDDDDD haha 
---
Noooo i missed the free sp giveaway
---
I started playing back in 2006 for about 7-8 years and then played on &amp; off since then, eve was dying when I first played and it’ll be dying for years to come. I’d honestly be more concerned when people stop shouting that Eve is dying as something must be amiss. 
---
hello friend - please remove the threatening anger symbols from your post :) this is a happy place free from loud noises and capital letters :)
---
It's another day with the same old, shit posting bullshit. The negative Nellies are out in force as usual.

Not sure if being bait flaired...

hello friend - out of concern for your posting well being ive gone ahead and given you an all expense paid vacation out of this subreddit for the next 24 hours :) hopefully this will cheer you up on this gloomy day! :) 
---
TIKKTOKK KISSING GIRLS? CCP THIS IS WHAT YOU CAUSED GETTING RID OF AT
---
I guess you had a lot of fun while typing this. 
---
hello friend, please remove the threatening anger symbols in your post from this nice happy and all lower class thread :)
---
They don't exactly have a stellar track record when it comes to following through on promises, even when they give specific timelines and ideas instead of vague, general statements.
---
The problem is just that anything that anyone can do, more people can do better, and that money = power and power = money in a recursive spiral that can only be broken by someone else having more money or being more powerful.
---
Fair enough, well answer is both yes and no. My first intent was to crab, however once you get there you realize that you have to take care of so many things, that crabbing is just a side activity that I personally am not doing every day. But the good news is that doing it two-three days a week is totally enough.
---
As I said, I just enjoy being in WH space too much. You will be surprised if you knew how much time I have spent sitting cloaked just watching others, I learned a lot just by doing it. One day I got an incoming connection from Dark Order's staging system. They are pretty big company and they started using my HS connection right away. I watched them for couple of hours, just looking what type of ships are they bringing. Then at some point I thought trying to catch one of them, it didn't work, then I tried to roll their connection, lol. I managed to hot-jump 2 Megas to and from, right before they realized what I was doing and I managed to get away from their tackle fleet. Still could not crit the connection and they have put a bubble on it. Well, at least I got that on my KB.
---
The point is, If you want just to crab, you better join some big entity that has loot buy-back program, take care of the hauling stuff and run all the structures, so you can peacefully lay back and crab without worrying about anything. When all that lays on your shoulders that's not crabbing anymore, there is too much stuff to take care of. And yet, this is the best opportunity that some smaller entities could ever have. It is much better than being a renter in nulls (never been myself, but I can imagine how much does it suck). 
---
You can bash highsec POCOs without a war dec?
---
&gt;For a game where people constantly talk about the consequences of losing stuff, literally choosing to delete your character out of rage should be final barring true accidents and account takeovers/hacks
---
No, civil disobedience requires you doing something that *actually has an impact* despite the potential legal consequences.  So blocking access to a building, or shutting down traffic by marching in the streets and refusing to disperse. 
---
Getting pissed about something (and lets face it a fucking tournament is a relatively minor thing) and then making a choice that has very little impact on what you are protesting, but a huge impact on you, is not civil disobedience. 
---
This is like saying, "I am pissed about Nike's sweatshops, so I am going to cut of my own feet. That will really show them! I mean, sure I could have stopped buying Nike shoes, and then left myself open to buying them again if enough people like me stop buying too and Nike changes its business practices, but nah... I AM REALLY PISSED, WHERE IS MY CHAINSAW." 
---
it's a lot more bits for handling modern microtransactions
---
2\^64 is way more bucks they can charge than 2\^32
---
::CCP turns off the server::
---
Ok game is balanced now!
---
Career agents should be handing these out for completing starter missions.
---
I don't think injectors are a problem by themselves. What they do though is highlight and worsen any balance issues, simply because now everyone can pile on to them without having to train for months or years.
---
People bitch about injectors making the rorq and super proliferation possible, but they wouldn't be balanced with or without injectors. Balance them properly and people will have less motivation to crowd into the FotM.
---
So this is a video if you bashing an afk ship
---
I've said pieces of it in other threads I'll say it here. It's not the Rorquals or the Supers or the Titans that are the issue. It's that the game is designed to support huge numbers of players using a small amount of systems such that there is no conflict and mega-alliances are sustainable. If folks had to spread out more, the effectiveness of umbrellas would be diminished and you'd see groups like skill urself, PL, etc. more willing to escalate in certain regions. Yes, you would still have the large coalitions but there would be more conflict on who gets the 'good' space and pressure on traveling longer distances to defend allies.
---
Wow. Amazing! :D
---
i’m finally hooked on eve. buying omega today because i appreciate the free to play aspect of the game. i want to go to Jita but i don’t want to die. i need money. 
---
&gt;none of the issues have really effected me yet.
---
it has in ways you don't realize (ie the halving of the pcu, the tens of billions injected into the economy from bots every hour, the significant less pvp activity over eve than this time last year)
---
r/eve will always overreact
---
just ignore those crybabies or "martyrs" deleting their Eve accounts, they will be quite within 1-2 weeks :)
---
Needs more Will Smith.
---
If swag means killing the games economy, health and balance with tabbed out multibox-pve ... this is 100% true.
---
But they did introduce the mass entangle module the same patch that they took hic module away from rolling whers? 
---
A missioning bid in venal to co2 - Elo called me a retard and it hurt my feelings
---
&gt; will be quiet
---
like the Tranquility Server ... I mean even with the inflation of some thousand chinese players, the logged in accounts on saturday prime are half of what they were just 4-5 years ago ....
---
I thought a while ago of making mining drones/excavators act more like fighters, but thats probably not a great idea. Maybe make it closer to explo with hacking?
---
But doesn't that give away info about corp in the hole?
---

Folks are very passionate about this game.  We have shittons of hours into it and lots of digital hard work.  They are scared that because CCP might make errors enough to the point where it'll basically cause the game to be shut down by their new overlords.  The game is still lots of fun and the nerdlords will always rage about something.  Lots of games have bugs but when a bug hits you in Eve it means alot more in most cases.  I'm glad you're enjoying Capitals online...also look into Triglavian ships.  Leshak = baby carrier.
---
Honestly, cutting off your own feet in protest will get far more attention than simply picketing NIKE.
---

It tells us a lot that your analogy for eve is a significant other.

Some would say, this is highly irregular. No, highly irregular is the time I found a human foot in a toaster oven. This is indeed just odd.
---
Edited my first post with stuff your reply made me think of. Hadn't gen thought about the agency or the damn activity tracker

It doesn't have to be though. Think how much of my post would be wrong or irrelevant if they spent 6 months looking at half finished concepts. But nope, plex and skin sales

Yeah, but same applies to basically all ships. Even dedicated PvP-ships, cause "idiot if taking a fight you ll lose". ( and, yeah, I m an idiot :D ) vOv
---
&gt; due to funding whilst creating a new mmo with eve money just further upset people
---
Because they just laid off a bunch of people associated with their non-eve titles, and in the processes laid off all but four of the community management team... including the guy who was responsible for handling CCP side arrangements for player tournaments like the AT.   
---
When shit like this happens, there is always a lot of confusion and catch up to be done, so as responsibilities are condensed and re-assigned, inevitably shit gets delayed. And in this case, what got delayed was CCPs ability to update the Thunderdome survey properly in the limited amount of time they had before the AT.   
---
So, I guess, you could say "it is about money," in as much as CCP leaned themselves via layoffs; however, they are *not* cancelling the AT because "they don't have the money to hold it." That's actually ridiculous. 
---

You don't need to pop the lab to get the loot, the moment you kill all the spawns you can access the lab! &gt;.&gt;
---
Also, people don't talk about them because they are not a new feature, they have been around for years, and yes, they can be rewarding, usually they will always give at least 10-30M isk, but not many corps and alliances can control low sec spaces not keep a strong enough presence to keep you save wile you do it... Cause you said it yourself, the incoming DPS is quite high, and once you start it you aren't leaving until you are done! &gt;.&gt;
---
A good T2 cruiser can do the site in around 10 min, a descent Battleship can do it considerable faster, but it all depends on how luck you are that no one will get in system and disrupt your site!

The hell is the point in cat ears if I can't have a fuckin tail?

I never tried it, But I thought Wormhole Moons had overall low value when it came to mineral allotment? 
---
Media player and Web browser were essential to me. (I started playing in August of2015). I think you may be able to control your media player through discord with some type of custom overlay but tbh, I usually just watch yt/netflix/prime video if I am doing anything boring like mining.  In battle I prefer as little distraction as possible.
---
little newbie. i've heard rumours about the people of the eve subreddit.
---
love it already.
---
So is it also a good thing that our characters don't starve like in all real world socialism examples ?
---
This is basically true - N+1 with the biggest ships will always be a winning strategy. If we removed supers/titans we'd have a more balanced fax/carrier/dread meta but numbers would still be the biggest factor.
---
The main difference, though, is affordability of losses. Titans are too expensive for most alliances, even goons, to megawelp on a regular basis. It's why a lot of wars end without any major supercap throwdowns (and often major cap brawls, because why commit caps if you won't risk your supers?) This is boring and bad for content. 
---
With dreads, though, anyone and their dog can replace a dread fleet. So we could have escalations and fights on a more regular basis, without worrying about getting evicted to highsec if you lose. 
---
So my main argument is less "nerf apex forces" because that's not gonna happen. It's that rule #1 of Eve is "don't risk what you can't afford to lose", and nobody can afford to lose a titan fleet, so we shouldn't require risking it to win fights, even against other titan fleets. *This* is why titans need to be nerfed out of the #1 spot. 
---
ninjaedit: the other important difference is it doesn't take like 300 hours of mining to be a competitive player-who-matters, which is a pretty aids thing to ask of anybody. If we're gonna go full casual we might as well embrace rapid content delivery, right? 
---
I won a few years ago. Breathe the free air my friend. 
---
nooo ymenoa don't go ;\_;
---
That's why I said I should have included more stories about PvP. The point is that those would be just a stories, nobody would learn something new from that :)   
---
Another good memory is when my static opened into a C3 with at least 10 structures. They had 2 fortizars, lol. I started to roll it right away. Now I am flying two megas, and one managed to jump back, another got tackled by group of 5 hecates. I don't run from every fight, it's just sometimes I can't do much, like in this case, I am limited to number of pilots i can fly, and one of them is already useless. But it does not mean that I just give it up. FYI, I managed to get away, I played smart, they got a wrong impression they would take an easy kill, so I call it a win. :)
---
I also had a Q003 (frigate-hole to nulls) open in my systems, with VNI's crabbing, but I still have not come up with the plan how to tackle them properly. I tried asteros and bombers, but the Rats seem to immediately aggro at my ships and I just can't tank against them, I can't orbit @40km, I need to tackle VNI... 
---
so i sent a ticket saying reddit told me to, and to ignore if they want.
---
they gave me plex
---
My lungs are already breathing this fresh breeze named **FREEDOM**
---
The main issue is it takes a DD volley to break through apostle reps on a super/titan as-is. So if people aren't willing to open up their titans to dreadbombs, you're in for a really aids 14-hour tidi brawl with minimal losses. 
---
This'd also leave super umbrellas untouched, and I'd rather hit them pretty hard. 
---
take into account the bots as well. 
---
This is going to be an extremely cynical cashgrab ala BDO as long as PA is in charge.
---
Yeah, CCP has just basically admitted that they are no longer invested in EVE, and just want to drop it as soon as their new project hits the ground running (or so they hope).
---
Nice o7
---
Looks like the characters from Chicken Run. 
---
Brisc had no bloc support.
---
People don't seem to understand that eve isn't just supposed to cater to the people who want to bear and press f1. Of course, how are they supposed to understand that when CCP has forgotten
---
And a monocle!
---
Can someone tell me what’s special about the delve?
---
it's like a company run entirely by regulars at /r/wallstreetbets 
---
So, you'd prefer CCP's original plan of asset safety everywhere.
---
No wonder you're whining.
---
&gt; Big brain comments.
---
What's the difference between having 2 and 20 citadels in system? You'll be staging in one of them, and once it's destroyed, you're rekt. If stuff is moved to another one, that's extra opportunity to wreck it. It doesn't seem to me like there's any point of having more than a few, since there's no difference between having a few and having a lot.

Secret Peen : Trouble in Midtown
---
I just want from ccp what I want from my girlfriend... More communication. 
---
Easy, nerf belt respawn rates aswell. Hell, make it dependent on the mining ADM. 
---
Each level of ADM increases the time for a belt to respawn by a security-level-dependant amount. 0.0 means the adm won't impact the respawn rate as much. -1.0 systems will receive the biggest hit.    
---
If your alliance is able to capture and hold sov in a -1.0 system you're not eligible for nerf-free mining. 
---
Low activity systems will get faster respawns, high activity systems will be slowed down.    
---
Means, if you're able to maintain a high mining adm in your -1.0 you're getting the bat.    
---
If you're regularly mining and manage to stay at a low adm in your rented 0.0 you'll get a new one in half an hour.    
---
Just some brainfarts while waiting for the bus.

Tbf there's just so much to choose from. I think the Balance Team was a Seagull pet project, and when she walked because they told her they were selling to Pearl Abyss (lol) the whole driving force behind it fell apart because they have no managerial redundancy. This is strange, because they have the turnover rate of a highway side McDonalds.
---
Upon consideration - I'm sure you're right.  Im a CEOv&amp;  Alliance head and we are small and starting to try to grow - but competing to be even slightly relevant is difficult.  I do think the botting miners/ratters  is throwing off the curve.  In that sense yes - its affecting our meta.  But as far as the daily activities - i feel like its relatively the same.  But you're right.  As much as one of me is grinding for resources - I just can't hope to be competitive. 
---
Hint: Don't bitch about random downvotes, it makes you look super needy
---
On short timescale yes, but over several months it would lead to much healthier situation. The only asset you can't keep hoarding and stockpiling is player numbers, and getting people to spread (it has to be done in a way that can't be cheesed by constant redeploying around for pve - like goons do with their moon mining locust fleets) will overall be of benefits of groups that are currently behind the wealth/power race. Having players spread means the amount of resources and people you need to use at one time to be able to force a fight (and cause meaningful losses) from defender is much lower, long-term enabling groups that are behind in power race to slow down wealth generation of their opponent and catch up. It would basically open a way to outsmart, outpredict and be able to meaningfully bait opponents into bad situation (add more ways for defenders to make mistakes that will cost them something, while not opening easy way to keep them constantly pressured).
---
Is this because they are not having AT this year?

Hmmm

---
While i am not a solo pvp guy, i always preferred small &amp; tight knit groups, lemming hordes always drove me off. There was a time when we had hope that we could make our impact to the game without piling up 10s of thousands of lemmings, where nobody knows each other really. It was after Phoebe and before Citadels, jump range changes gave possibilities for smaller groups to dominate their small area even against larger groups, Lowsec got buffed a bit in income with clone soldiers, Mordus &amp; Covert Research stuff ... then came citadels &amp; new moon mining .... they took the incentive to engage any structure and forced small PvP-Groups to start mining for their income ... and since then this tendencies have increased. 
---
Basically EVE is just a social platform for me now, as our group core sticks together since 2007. But CCP got us that far that we are now looking for another refuge where we can defect to as a whole group. And we will take a lot of peeps with us then over different timezones and language areas. Our discord has people from different groups in EVE, some AU guys, many people in Russia and EU, Us guys ... we have built quite a nice community over the last 12 years that definitely does not need EVE anymore to last.
---
Correct, as far as I have been told.  So, instead of adding a new ore or resource to WH space, CCP simply copied / pasted the NS mechanic into WH space but made it "less good".  Job done.  Does not get any more lazy than that.  
---
10k seems low, but out of 30k peak average users, that's about 1/3rd of players(assuming you can compare these numbers). So, it's low, but not as low as it may seem. 
---
I linger and lurk around here for the shitposts and memes! I do miss the game I haven't played in 2 years and by the looks of things, not rushing back to return!

Eve is 15 years old.  They need a new game if they want to stay in business.
---
Hopefully this will actually be released and not platform-locked.
---
Dont do a hard limit, use a sliding scale that weakens them per type. Per constellation. One single cit in a constellation has great defenses, ten have an extra hour or two and weaker resists or something. Thirty have five extra hours of vuln and a debuff on weapons. What you are looking for is a perfect density to defense ratio that doesnt involve a million cits, but doesnt disallow a million cits. As the number of citadels drops, the remaining ones get stronger. But only in their particular type, and only within a specific range. 
---
Drop asset safety to region or constellation only, no more dumping back to lowsec. It would make evac and last stand defenses more important and the last (friendly) cit in a constellation would be a loot pinata.
---
I agree on the Injectors the only downside to them is no longer being able to go oh that's a week old char he cant be in a cloak or a cyno user.
---
Dude just do small gang in wormholes if you're so upset about capitals I'm balance.
---
Eve is still a lot of fun. Many bitter vets love playing in wormholes because it gives them what they want. Many in my corp are having the time of their long eve lives.
---
100? Out of 19000?
---
200?
---
500?
---
It's insignificant.
---
This could be true - tbh, I don't know what actually drove down the price of nanoribbons.  I heard it was something in T2 material requirements but I could be wrong.  
---
Either way, reducing the drop or increasing demand (by adding it as a material to other blueprints) may increase the overall (non-mining) PvE activity in WH space and subsequently drive PvP.  
---
At the moment, the salvage from a C2 site is \~2mil (with 15 mil in blue loot).  This isn't terrible for a few minute's work in a 200mil ship but of course, Wormholes don't have endless anoms and running them can be quite risky.  
---
Cool story bro...very nice well done
---
Just join us in RvB we blow up shit for the hell of it. We kill and be killed simple. 
---
All of eve ganged up and kicked GOONS out of the north.
---
They moved to Delve and started the largest economic empire, protected by a large titan/supercap fleet since it was centralized to one region.
---
The north started eating eachother instead of containing GOONS expansion.
---
GOONS now owns Eve.
---
I think this sums it up
---
64 teams in previous ATs, minimum of 10 per team with a lot of subs as well
---
More than 500 at least, why try to pretend that's insignificant? 
---
that is true. i always wondered about these numbers. id love to see how many actual active players EVE has
---
&gt;Gimp your gameplay style for the sake of content
---
Nobody will ever actually do this, even if the gameplay is super aids.
---
awww :(
---
The true root of the problem, i think, goes deeper than that.
---
Back in 2008, CCP first show off both avatar gameplay and (then unknown) dust gameplay. They showed a certain ambition for the game, to make it grow, to make it evolve far beyond its 'internet spaceships' core. This was always the plan, at least, it was up until around that point.
---
The [Future Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45mlVuLs_Nw) trailer is still a remnant of this. I know of a corpmate who flat out said "Now i know i'll be playing EVE for the rest of my life."
---
The years passed, and sadly we started seeing more and more evidence that CCP simply didn't know what they wanted to do, and what they were doing full stop. WoD went into full production and Dust was marred by an incredibly difficult development process due to CCP's indecision on what they wanted it to be, taking far too much time thinking and not spending enough time on doing. I've heard somewhere that Icelanders are famously indecisive about everything, and i guess this applies here too.
---
Meanwhile, EVE suffered. Jesus features were introduced and abandoned. Older features were neglected. Day to day operation and development were doing there best, but they had people at the wheel who simply did not know where they were going or even where they wanted to go, splitting off new projects, hiring, firing, shooting down good ideas and pursuing bad ones.
---
Then, the big blow came in 2011, where the Greed is Good memo exploded while Incarna was released. This combination - Talk of increasing monetization while at the same time neglecting the game itself with half-assed features - Led to the famous revolts. 
---
And i think this is where CCP truly lost the plot.
---
They let themselves steer by a single unfortunate event, instead of consolidating and plotting a proper course. EVE became purely iterative on its existing features and mechanics rather than introducing new ones. The balance between the two was lost forever, as was the ambition. CCP became scared to innovate, and became happy to simply placate the players with what essentially boils down to an 8-year period where all the 'content' the game received was a series of *balance patches*, nothing else.
---
For all it's mechanical problems - Of which there are many, especially in sov warfare - The game simply hasn't moved along. If i logged in in 2011, and logged in right now, i'd be hard pressed to see the differences. In fact, i think that if the 2011 me were to log in to the game now, i'd see *less*, not more. 
---
The scope has shrunk. The ambition is gone. CCP is scared to do anything which isn't dictated by a balance sheet from their financial department, even before PA took over. There is no passion left in the people who are steering the ship.
---
Pls no I'm an alcoholic
---
LMAOOOOOOO

Look up D-W beacon incident, look up any dreadbomb in Delve from 2017, check skillu/scourge dreadbomb onto Brave random response recently. Compare that to INIT. counterdrops when various groups tried to snipe their Molok. It's exactly the case here - spreading people doesn't change much in constant harassment kind of guerilla warfare, but reduces critical mass required to successfully hit someone and makes difference between everyday standing fleet response and ready to bait and counterdrop response much more important.
---
It's very taxing and time consuming for people who set this up (find targets, gather intel, find a way to go in and have extraction ready), but for people taking part, it can be reduced to joining a fleet and doing the F1 duty. It's a lot like Bombers Bar whaling fleets used to be before playerbase concentration in few areas reached current level - they had so many potential areas to go and so many potential targets, that even knowing they forming whaling fleets meant only that you have no idea what they're forming for. The force you had to deal with when you suprises someone was much more manageable than what you can expect now - dealing with immediate response having available 5 supercaps and like 20 FAXes is easily handled by medium-sized dreadbomb (if in that scenario someone's often cynoing your roams, just offer being a bait to their enemies), while what you can expect now as random drop in most densely packed areas is impossible to handle without full scale move that alerts the targets and gets them prepared.
---
The AT hasn't been completely about sport ya know. Of players wanted to host their own AT for the sport of it they could. But people complain every year the AT ships are too powerful and the people who participate do it for the ISK. 
---
So if you think about it, killing the AT is denying groups of players an ISK faucet. 
---
For all of you crying about the Alliance Tournament, why dont you all get together in order to make and host your own!
---
you mean asklepians?
---
I love this game. I'm not saying it's bad. I just wish they would revert back to it being ruthless (fuck asset safety, get rid of capital insurance) and complete half finished ideas (resource wars, tiericide etc)
---
I think over shipping causes less pvp honestly last few roams we have had say 10 peopleish cruisers and below do you know what response fleets we got? One was 30 people ferox fleet with 7 of them being logi. The other to our desy gang? 3 fucking titans warped to the gate to try and use their dd on us. If it wasnt for the fc being crazy and continuing to go back that way why would anyone try to go there for fights anyways when those are the normal fleets we are seeing in responce.
---
thank u for this original post lmao!!
---
Sorry brother your playstyle (especially with FRT) is what people are complaining about
---
EA was *against* Apex right up until the day of release. It's almost completely Respawn's own project. EA only provide the infrastructure.

I'd wait for Anthem's unavoidably botched release before deciding that EA turned the ship around :)

Their investors are currently focused on mobile games anyway.

Maybe they fired the guy who brought us the abysmal demo for the first person shooter. Hmm. 
---
Learned helplessness, ladies and germs.
---
&gt; How can you blame anything other than time?
---
because I see shit that's not time based, like when a super pilot doesn't know jump mechanics and coms has to walk him through it. 
---
I do not miss POSes for the crap RF mechanics.  If you're a small,  single-TZ corp,  it was quite possible to get RF'd while everyone's offline for a final timer noone can make, and a few groups made a point out of planning evictions this way. 
---
In our case, after Dura Lexx came through we made extra efforts to make sure that killing our POSes for loot was worthless unless you planned to move in,  thus guaranteeing us a chance to retaliate. 
---
That is the one big advantage to citadels, its much easier for the defender to ensure they can actually defend... the problem being the people who instead just reverse the roles from before and try to ensure the attacker has trouble attacking rather than any plans to truly defend.
---
Create your own. 
---
Offer no prize money. Have players compete for the true sport of competition. Now let's see this occur instead of all the whining and bitching on reddit. 
---
fucking agreed.  Like what's the point of this post at all? 
---
The super thing is an issue and ccp does keep making it worse. They even said long in the past they thought they would be super rare hence their power yet now ever ever alliance has hundreds if not thousands of titans and so on hell I'm starter corp and have a supercarrier.
---
Not even good for that usually after some troll comes along and decimates your fragile little ego. 
---
T3 works well.  Active tank has can also do it.
---
Can you tell me more about it? Because I can't see my playstyle "wrong", if you can blame someone by playing a game in a way. I log earn some isk. Buy ships. Destroy them doing PvP. Rinse repeat. 
---
My respect for CCP
---
u rly think literally every person who has ever played in the AT and subs 1 or 2 months a year is going to affect ccp lmao
---
the people who dont sub 90 accounts 
---
the people who get their at ships and rmt out
---
Wow people gonna downvote you but ur completely right. CCP setup Eve as a nutrient dispenser. Even when the colonists on Eve get ass blasted about their nutrient paste they just eat more.
---
Dude frank is hilarious. He fails and still laughs just to do it again. Gotta love it. 
---
please do us a favor and fuck off it would be great lmao, such a drama child
---
Ha! Yeah I guess it shows people care
---
I see that makes sense. Well In this case, the players are to blame right? I mean it’s a sandbox mmorpg, people should of been able to contain them or do something about it if it’s a problem, or at least that’s what I think..
---
From personal experience, my corporation had 5 customs office in a well trafficked and populated high sec system. On average the customs office made about 20m ISK each. This was because the tax had to be low because of the added Concord tax inherent in HiSec customs offices. 
---
awoxing an afk.  dishonabru. 
---
i'd still do it but I wouldn't brag about it. 
---
yeah thats why ccp canceled the AT, so they can pander to people who rorqual mine with 30 alts 24/7 more, maxing that profit right?
---
Yes exactly right, people let it happen and now complain about mechanics being at fault.
---
It's a sandbox, mechanics are universally available, everyone needs to stop whining.
---
Not a goon btw
---
Oh that too, although we never said it was "a fight against the odds", only that we had no idea what to expect. Which, if you consider it from the perspective of F1-pushing femtobrained nullbab spodmonkeys, I'm sure you'll agree is reasonable.

But there 100% was a theme of "dirty nullseccers can't be allowed".

How certain are you that it's constellation and not region in Nullsec? I do most of my exploration in w-space, so I haven't gotten around to doing a test of that.
---
rorqual miners also arent out here being crybabies every second of the day cuz their favorite elite douchecanoe ship isnt strong enough against fighters
---
Right, but the point would be to force people to DD, which puts titans at risk... 
---
But I do get your concern about both sides "Committing" without actually committing to *using* their titans. However, we still need a real fax nerf, kind of ridiculous how powerful they still are.
---
yeah ok nvm

Not actively trying, it's usually the infamous CCP mismanagement combined with the "A-Team" leaving for other companies or the industry entirely.

last thing i read was that in 2013 the Accounts per Player was around 1.7 and that its about to hit 3.0 atm.
---
CCP has a history of drawing manpower from "running project A" and senselessly sink it into "failing before launch-project B"
---
reminder that eve players don't care about your shitpost
---
its ok there will be 19 more EPIC gamer threads about quitting cuz their tiny exclusive ring of EPIC gamers got BTFOd by ccp
---
I slapped it together, was trying to explain what a bhaalgorn was to people who don't play Eve. I'd like to try to make a barghest, as well as making a non glob job bhaal
---
Them sick burns tho
---
The type of player that is leaving eve is the pvper. You win PVErs. You can have your anoms haha. I don’t understand grinding for no reason but heh. To each their own. I just stick around and read r/eve. My accounts already got juiced. Sometimes there’s good stuff to read here but pretty much Eve is going out because the pvp era are getting driven away. This is how games truly die. Literally half of my friends have unsubbed, these guys didn’t post on r/eve that they were leaving. They just left. 
---
If you take anything from what I’m saying just take that you’re only seeing a fraction of the players that are leaving posting about it on r/eve. There’s a lot more of us. 
---
They say they were against it, but they bought Respawn in 2017 iirc and could've made their produce the general ea cashcowmilkscheme if they so wished
---
Talk is cheap and "in the future" is a very, very vague deadline :D
---
But that's not connected in any way to 50 at people having to wait until next year, nor is it connected to people quitting eve just because those 50 can't play at.
---
Furthermore if you look at the /eve posts throughout it's existence, you'll notice they are filled with stuff about eve is dying,  you'll see the unnecessary and insanely apoplectic unreasonableness exhibited thought. 
---
For example, recall all those "OMG I'm quitting eve because Pearl abyss took over"?
---
It was extreme reeeeeee about nothing at all. I even posted the Pearl abyss ceo's statement that they weren't going to interfere with eve. But it was simply downvoted because of the reeee circle jerk.
---
And the pearl abyss CEO was right; they didn't interfere. But where are those reeee people now? Apologizing for being apoplectic and wrong?
---
Nope, they're reeeeee-ing again because some 50 people can't play in at.
---
Fifty out of 19000.
---
This is a non issue once again.
---
Just like  the abyssal module rng reeee was and just like all the other times.
---
When will you realize this community routinely over blows things that don't matter? The facts are staring at you in the face.
---
The goal of guerilla warfare in that case isn't to completely shut someone down (that'd require proper invasion, structure grinding etc.), but to slow their wealth generation enough so your own industrial machine can catch up or outperform them. It adds another way to compete in power race that isn't just "get more players, produce more" - you don't have to build your power as fast as possible to get and stay ahead, it's enough to just build it faster than others.
---
And arguably space isn't the issue, the issue is in player density - if you removed half of nullsec now, almost nothing would change and you'd still have this self-sustaining accelerating rapid growth that uses safety of powerful supercap umbrella to generate more resources to further increase the power of supercap umbrella, at some point reaching unassailable levels (one could argue both Goons and TEST already achieved that point). Keeping amount of space as it is and cutting resource density per system/region would mean that - to increase wealth generation - you have to spread and either water down your potential safety measures over larger area, or give up protection of some of that area
---
From last war between Imperium and northern groups (the one that arguably ended with X47 keepstar) pressure from Goon SIGs, Init. and Snuff on CO2 was strong enough to make it near impossible for them to replace what they were losing during fights, effectively setting them more and more behind in terms of power - and this kind of dynamic being possible to use against any group given enough dedication and reasonable amount of players/resources is exactly what I'm talking about.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I quit eve a few years ago, last played with DNG saving the warzone from filthy minmatar hoards in fun but stupid T1 frig fights and shitting up local.
---
Does shit like this still happen? Looking at logged in player counts and seeing complaints about the state of lowsec I'd hazard a guess at no. I've had my fill of nullsec stuff forever with various Delve wars and finally the Halloween War, wormholes were a bit too much effort but I enjoyed the madness of lowsec.
---
Try fac war lol. 
---
That's exactly why i left LS to move to WHs !!!! I was about to quit the game like a month ago, then i got an offer from a WH group, joinned them, and god damn ITS A BLAST !  
---
WH space/Best space &lt;3 
---
The first step to solving any problem is recognizing that there is one.
---
Burying one's head in the sand solves even less than 'just' complaining about something.
---
this guy isn't interested in talking about losing a particularly noteworthy piece of the highest level competitive pvp in the game, and its *only* "official" tournament.  
---
to this guy, the game could literally be instanced with only him in a belt with his rorq and he'd be perfectly happy. it's not worth wasting your time.
---
Ive tried Tripwire,  but I must be doing something wrong.  It auto tracks me just fine in known space - but when I go into a wormhole - it gets stuck on the last known space system I was in. 
---
TBH i love the idea of ensuring these ships remain available as long-term goals for players not wanting to join the titan blob... but i do worry that CCP would totally fuck up implementation. 
---
The method of getting them would have to be very carefully controlled and balanced to avoid becoming AT ships online.
---
You can pull 20+ nanoribbons from a c5 site.. Given you can do them in 5 minutes, you can generate hundreds an hour.
---
Its legitimately an oversupply problem. 
---
\&gt;  it was quite possible to get RF'd while everyone's offline for a final timer noone can make.
---
You had all your POS's come out at the same time? That was your first mistake. You set them to times using the Stront amount. If DURA LEXX was able to come in and wipe your entire system out in one go, while everyone was offline then in all honesty, that was the fault of whoever managed your towers...
---
you forgot "days without content". 
---
The issue now is that you go between areas that are ghost town with nobody being there, and areas where you have more people packed than in hisec - there is no middle ground, you either have empty space or huge groups to deal with. Back before Tribute war of 2016 map had much more even player spread, and solo/smallgang roaming more often meant being able to fight against local groups that - while large enough to defend their structures when formed up - fielded manageable response size to be able to get decent fights more often. Ad-hoc rageping formups were something that could be handled by 40-man roaming fleet and didn't require full coalition deployment being there just to be able to make a scratch.
---
That was the engine that powered walking in stations, right? If so, yes. Burn it with fire.
---
He's not talking about killing them, he's talking about memeing them and forcing a stalemate/ransom payout 
---
i have been an on and off player for the last year or so,  i have only recently dedicated to the game and started getting more into it, and i fell like i have to say that, even with the recent drama, this is still the best game i have ever played, it is one of the truest sandboxes i have ever seen, you can do anything you want to, mining, industry, combat, trading, exploration, you can be a member of a corp or a lone wolf, there is an amazing community and on top of everything, the economy if the game is almost completely player based
---
Those are just some things, there is even more than I could fit here, and while its no excuse for any bad choices the devs make, people shouldn’t overlook what an incredible game this still is
---
I think someone lost his stuff to INIT...
---
Sometimes.... If you're about to gank site runners and somehow they don't know you're there, obviously don't say anything.  But sometimes it gives you more information that it gives away if you get someone to talk back.  I often start talking in local when I see probes, just to see if anyone responds.
---
Sometimes talking in local can even be a tool... like to spook someone back to the hole you want them to go to for example.
---
Utlimately, for me wh space is about getting away from the rules and regulations of the big NS entities.  Imposing dumb ones for no reason kinda ruins the point.
---
Hey dude, Corail here, was great playing with you, i'm considering extracting it all too since i've played maybe 3 months out of the last 2 years. But honestly i can't even be bothered to launch the game again.  
---
Sad to se you go and sad to see other known faces doing the same but then again it was expected. I'm not sure if i'll be playing Eve again myself, i've been enjoying Path of Exile lately, if you want to try it out message me on Discord and we'll play.  
---
As said by so many others in the thread, i think you made the right call. Not only considering the sorry state of the game but also regarding your personal life, which I know very little of, but more time to do shit IRL can't hurt.
---
Dans tout les cas, bonne chance et bonne continuation a toi pour le futur. Et peut-être a une prochaine !  
---
You know you've won EVE when you get so salty that even the saltiest people you moderate on the EVE Facebook Group think you've reached peak salt.
---
dont worry, jita isnt the death trap some people say it is. just fly small fast things if youre getting only a few items. if you get rich enough, buy a transport ship. i love my occator :)
---
Hope you got some good Ice cream as well. I can personally recommend cookies and creme flavour.
---
Five years, actually, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore at this point.
---
Look like he quitted after this lost hahahahahahahaha
---
Pixel spaceships love you too &lt;3 they told me.
---
&gt; worth a look for anyone more interested in the PVE aspects of eve
---
why not just move to Delve?
---

Would you mind sharing a good jag fit? I'm finishing up AF V, but I don't have a good fit for the jag yet
---
Lol just adapt
---
Atm the community is argueing about stuff that made this game lose more than 50% of its playerbase and that will crash the market for plex subs in short time if CCP does not artificially support it (by piling cheap PLEX into the game with Packs).
---
The people unsubbing atm were the ones that sub &amp; buy PLEX with credit card, supplying all the PLEX in Jita that all the newly created low-risk-pve-multiboxes consume for subbing. That is exactly the reason why a PLEX sub is closing in on 2 Bil. Less people supplying PLEX, more accounts consuming it.
---
It's a glob job bhaalgorn. I make scientific glassware. 
---
WH space is the best opportunity for the smaller entities nowadays. It's just that people are too scared of giving it a try. People prefer to rent shitty space in nulls, rather than trying their best in WH.
---
I was in an AB vagabond and someone had crafted a scythe fleet issue fit purely for ransom. Caught him once in 25 min and got him to half structure but then he smartened up and I couldn't get close. Ended up paying 300m dor him to suicide. 
---
He said his fit costs around 80 mil, so decent profit for him!
---
Sorry, I have plans this weekend.
---
The Kiki at least is expensive. Destroyer and small disintegrater specialization skillbooks are pricey
---
i need to stop training on my main for a week to get my occator fit up to par, but thats fine. i wonder if I can slip it by a lowsec gatecamp... any ideas?
---
Does that mean you are also an expert on Texas Law, and the ramifications of its application in this setting?
---
So its the same 10 guys fighting each other and sometimes losing 4 bil in one day. 
---
Theres a few where the guy gets killed and loses 2.5 bil then 45 minutes later loses another 2 bil to the same guy.
---
? huh, wasnt that exactly what I said ?
---
capqu, you are now doing alot more important things than trying to win a shiny fuccboi ship
---
someone needs to atleast be trying to shake this shit up before the game dies
---
ps. hounds are for shooting bombs not torpedos :pepega:
---
So because Nova was not up to par they are now remaking it into a generic action mmorpg?
---
The money I spent on Warframe was because I wanted to buy community made fashion. Been playing the game since first closed beta key was sent to me and I never had to buy the currency with rl.
---
Here's one of the most recent amazing things in my honest opinion: https://youtu.be/cutWz4Jnh_U?t=2315 Watching that excitement live was just... one of the most amazing things that happened in 2018. Good developers thrive from all that nerd excitement. I recommend watching that entire TennoLive and seeing for yourselfs how amazing eve online expansions could be if CCP management would put any effort in. Or if they actually want the game to succeed.
---
Are people *still* trying to pretend it wasn't called World War Bee?
---
Historical revisionism only works for the winners.
---
Honestly, you don't really need the reason to fight, if you give the ability to fight and generate conflict, people will find or make up reasons to go to war. Shifting resources over map doesn't solve the problem of positive feedback loop of power generation - being able to keep all your power concentrated in one place means more powerful groups will have better safety and be able to increase their ability to generate even more power faster than others. And having resources shift even increases that factor - because the most powerful group will at the same time deny resources from other groups that can't directly fight against their full force.
---
We can easily see that now by looking at how Locust fleet by Goons work - it's smaller scale resources shifting due to how moon mining timers work; if moon mining instead spawned new rocks constantly while preserving current 48h despawn time, this approach would be impossible and - to keep using moons outside current umbrella - would require them to spread out and be more vulnerable instead of being able move around with full protection of supercap fleet. If resource shifting was a case, you'd eventually see form up of this kind of unassailable power moving around and taking everything, making it even harder to catch up for everyone else.
---
I think they have people with that knowledge but management does not let people use this knowledge.
---
They d have the money. They just throw it outa that other window.
---
If you're retarded and dont know how to roll, or dock up whenever someone finds you.
---
Tell us if the gaysex was good
---
Its just another part of EVE that kept ppl in it and that suddenly is on fire. EVE is burning at too many corners already and instead of firefighting CCP is sitting there playing with gasoline and matches.
---
And whwnbthey finally made it non-VR they changed the gameplay to space overwatch...
---
The game was good. It is considered one of the if not the best VR game out there. But the exclusivity killed it and when it lost the VR exclusivity CCP killed it with unnecessary and unwanted gameplay changes.
---
they should hire someone who can write better copy
---
boundless creativity, really?
---
A 64-bit client in itself is a "why do you not already have a 64-bit client in 2019, wtf" thing, however CCP has a proven track record of fucking up every client change along these lines, and what we'll really be getting instead of expanded limits and maybe more performance is a ton of new bugs.
---
My hurricane, to diamond rats in a belt. A corpmate wanted to clear them out, he couldnt get the logi to me in time.
---
Just glad I didn't use my fleet issue cane
---
Eve will live until Star Citizen comes out. Which might actually happen 2020.
---
they only cry when the PLEX sub rises and their Rorqual ticks are falling "CCPlease why is dat???" ... economic analphebetism is wide spread sadly
---
And yet still some TRI AT pilots got nothing from their AT run....
---
Most of the people I talk too that actually log in and play the game feel this way. r/eve is a hive mind of scum villainy that is actively trying to destroy the game.
---
I seriously can't relate to the r/eve constant saltyness compared to my in-game experience. In the past that subreddit has been a huge help for me to learn how to play this motherfucking game. Now all I see is people complaining about how it's turned bad.  
---
I've been on eve for a long time now, even though I am still arguably a noob, but then most of the alterations that CCP brought to the universe seem to me like improvements more than problems. It is also worth noting IMO that I still have a lot of fun in 1v1 pvp, small gang roams and a lot of subcap activities that a lot of people talk about as if it were completely dead.  
---
As I said I pretty much don't understand why people are complaining that much.
---
Played off and on since 2009, started as a miner/ mission runner in highsec, did several different null things, great lowsec pvp for a while, now back in highsec with friends having a blast on comms in wars and experimenting in all the different abyss sites, making more friends, I play more now than I have in many years. 
---
at a glance i read this as a post about abyssal sockets and started to question what sub i was on
---
EVE is more a hobby than a game. I've won EVE so now concentrate on other hobbies. If someone tried to fuck with my motorbikes, guns or barbell I'd be angry and throwing a tantrum too.
---
shame that ur extracting and rmting all ur chars out for a profit off ccp lmao
---
if you call more than 50% of the playerbase in the last 5 years small &amp; exclusive ... well ....
---
50% LMAO
---
Don't be obtuse, I never planned on participating but watching the tournament was always fun for me, and the casting was generally entertaining.
---
It's a loss for all eve, not just the participants.
---
math is hard isn't it?
---
Probably by not drawing attention to it... Like taking pictures of it and posting online lol
---
Ironic how a few years ago this would've been the highest praise.
---
Its so sweet that they give us a free 60 plex on top of the 440 when you buy the basic pack.
---
EVE has been a nonevent since at least 2014 when Shadoo unironcally floated that wargames idea. But there's just enough addicted lifers and lolmemers palying to keep it from literally dying no matter how bad it gets.
---
Jags are only as good as the pilot. Some idiots whelped a jag, an enyo, and a dramiel to our fleet of drunken shit fit Tristan's. Our whole fleet of 7 was worth less than one of their ships XD they should have been able to kill us easily but guess they we're drunker than we were.
---
CCP fucked up marketing? That sure never happened before!
---
Reports of CCP Falcon kicking puppies has been greatly exaggerated. 
---
This really isn't any different from what it used to be in the past.  People gonna say MOOOOOONS.  but they basically exist in the same space as they use to, you just have to actively mine them.  If people wanted to fight over moons in the past it is the same mechanism as it is now.  
---
CCP has looked a gift horse in the mouth by siphoning off all the cash they could from their main IP in vein attempts to create new IP. If they'd concentrated on the one, sparking diamond they had rather than piss money into the wind all these years they'd be in a far better position.  
---
I have a bad habit of taking my cloaky astero out and just exploring through whs u till I pop out into either low, null or High... 'Home' I's whatever station I dock at. 
---
My suggestion is bookmarking. And detailed notes on the WH description when you find them or you land yourself a 100+ long haul back home.
---
We are both on a sub reddit for an internet space ship game and you are calling me a nerd. HAHAHA
---
You vastly underestimate just how many capitals the big alliances have.
---
TEST currently krabs in Esoteria, and we don't fill it.  Let's say post-your-changes, TEST has to krab in Paragon Soul, Esoteria nd Feyth.  More than triple the current level of "spread out".
---
TEST has enough carriers to easily cover Paragon Soul, Esoteria and Feyth in a crush-all-roams umbrella.  We'd just need three standing fleets instead of our current two (2 because of the pilot limit).  The only thing keeping us from doing it now is we don't bother to protect renters from roams.
---
Supers in Esoteria can respond to escalations in Paragon Soul and Feyth with one mid, so SkullU and PL are only going to be able to pick off the occasional stupid ratting super with a dreadbomb before Titans and Supers show up....just like today.
---
To spread out enough to bring about the result you want, TEST would have to cover around 5ish regions.  And that's just us.  Scale that way up for Goons.
---
So let's say you did that.  Goons own half the map, we own 1/4 and Panfam owns 1/4...and that's it.
---
Along comes a newcomer like, say, Fraternity.  In the current system, we did not intervene because they were "far away" and that gave Frat time to grow into a big player.  In the massive-spread-out-system, they wouldn't have enough space to grow much and we'd have to destroy Frat as soon as they showed up because we need that space.
---
So null is left with nothing but the giant alliances, and no new alliances can try to find a pocket to become the next big alliance.  You're left with one conflict driver: The grudges Goons and Legacy have against Panfam.
---
Human nature is to band together into larger groups.  The limit is the ability of the group to have a coherent identity, which is a function of communications.  We have plenty of communications technology to keep the large alliances feeling like a coherent group, even when they cover lots of space.
---
Yes that might be good idea. Drek has high em resist already. It could be better if u can fit it that way.(didnt really check so it allows you to fit t2) i might check it too later. 
---
I use a cap stable 1.2k dps rattlesnake With active tank :D
---
But maybe of my 7 page dissertation, CCP can recognize I’m #SERIOUS
---
Like I said, small group.  We only really used 2 towers, with a couple extras for backups/giggles.  And no, they had different timers, but they sieged over the course of 10 hours and lucked out.  USTZ group, siege started at 1AM EST on a Tuesday with final timers between 2AM and 3PM Wednesday. We were weighted towards 1 day 4 hours to 1 day 9 hours with anticipation of most likely initial attack being in EUTZ.
---
And yes, our revised policy after that involved more small towers and all storage in SMAs or freight containers so nothing could get locked out, but there's no denying that was a PITA for logistics. 
---
ur literally arguing about something else lmao
---
Ah the CCP classic. Announce something everyone hates followed immediately by a plex sale (discount level dependant on how bad your announcement was), sit back for a few weeks then show the beancounters that the choice they made was the right one because income held/went up at the time they made the change. 
---
Do you think there are really more players than that in this game that are not bots and leave highsec :-D 
---
Sadly, some of my fond memories was rushing to the computer after high school to jump on and watch the AT and play a lil somer blink cause those sexy AT promos they did. But even without blink, it was still a lot of fun to watch and learn from those experienced pilots and see what cool doctrines (At the time) people did. vOv

Yup, getting rid of your character is really stupid, sure you may be salty as hell and might have all the right to be right now, but who know what will happen in the next 6 months, year, or 5 years....
---
My main has 65m SP and literally have had no desire to train skills in months. Between my main and my alts I can fly quite literally any ship in the game outside of titans and some BCs (which have never been in the meta).
---
Remove trading.
---
Ironman btw.
---
Let's be honest, this sub is shit when we're not reeing about something, or getting really good fights.
---
It tells me that 15 year old MMOs have difficulty retaining players.  It's not like this is a problem unique to EvE.
---
Wormhole space has certain restrictions.
---
As for the culture, it’s the Wild West our in nul. If you want restriction that facilitate different play that to high sec. Nothing wrong with either, but perhaps that’s the issue. Since it’s every man for himself out there, once territory gets settled... then what? It’s not like we grow new players through ad campaigns. I mean, isn’t that CCP’s job?
---
Still, why go out to nul anyways? All the big money is not in high sec. AFAIK there aren’t big corps like goons or test operating there, which makes me wonder why. Is it lack of money? Lack of opportunities to lure all the big guys back to high sec en mass?
---
So... Skill(extract) Urself new Alliance name ? Gotcha 👌
---
99%. Haven’t tested it myself, but every single time I’ve looked up guides on explo they mention anomalies respawning within a constellation 
---
about how many people actually still log in, you said that its only a small elitist circle leaving, i proved you wrong ... simple fact
---
&gt; it's unfair to judge CCP on things that could have happened but didn't
---
They did make a devblog quite literally saying "fuck wormholers just adapt, we didn't have enough time to make an inclusive solution for all playstyles", which is what matters at the end of the day. It shows how they don't even consider PVP players when working on the game these days.
---
So I'm reading through your post and it has some good points, but then I got to this:
---
&gt;and then the cyno remains on and cycling as long as the pilot doesn't cycle it off.
---
And I realized you've apparently never used a cyno inhibitor before? You have a fundamental misunderstanding as to how they work. Even if the module is green cycled, when the cyno tries to cycle again it is prevented from doing so if there is an active inhibitor in range.
---
You can quite easily set up keyboard macros to pause your music.
---
Why do you all rage-quitting bio-massing retards feel the need to make a post about it? Is it to spread your negativity to actively try to take the game down with you? Or is it just simple attention seeking?
---
You're not a martyr, you leaving will affect nothing, and nobody gives a shit.
---
If CCP has any glimmer of competence, they ignore the hell out of this place.
---
Nice straw man you erected. How many plexxed Rorqs you need to justify?
---
xddd
---
Why would I fuck over my boys?
---
Last time they did we got Fozzie Sov
---
That's true. But maybe the trend of people leaving the game will start a larger trend that effects subscriptions and PLEXs.
---
If it effects the bottom line, the company will either change their practices, or they'll (eventually) shut the game down.
---
Im going to unsub soon. Maybe come back in a few years, like the last time I unsubbed.
---
What do you mean adapt do you mean join a big bloc and go mining because yes most of the people how complain about the meta don't particularly like that play style. 
---
Now the flying cheap ships is an adaption because more blingy tank isn't gonna save you so minimizing the loss if your ship pops is the best solution couple this with nano's to make sure you can GTFO when people form more then you can fight and then you go out shooting VNI's because that's literally the only thing in space you can pop. 
---
It's not Goons' fault that CCP let the current meta last so long. If we didn't abuse it someone else would have.

what with how easy it is to just make a new account (*cough* gigx *cough* *cough* lenny *cough* *cough* most RMT and botters *cough* ) a permaban is literally no punishment.

Underrated comment right here. You sir, deserve more upvotes.
---
Yeah, I'm enjoying seeing veterans quit. More fun for freshmen. 
---
Don't engage these mentally deranged keyboard warriors, they don't even log in.
---
I'm confused because if seems like your arguing against your idea?
---
Regions of space that apply your idea of spreading out resources will be challenging to put under a super umbrella, and will drive the groups that live there to build wide. 
---
The 'few' regions that don't get this applied to them will still keep their current hyper vertical setup. Which I dont think is fundamentally an issue, its just that its the ideal strategy everywhere. 
---
True the initial major shakeup will only last until the major power blocks move to the areas that enable their current city building strategies. We get both the modern meta and the new meta your aiming for at the same time.  Not only do players get to choose which playstyle they prefer, but we get the dynamic of both metas interacting with each other. 
---
The key is definitely to have more TOTAL wealth in these new 'low density' regions.  Meaning that the cumulative power of the low density empires (ie allying everyone) is sufficient to overpower the  high density bastions of power. (which are structured like current alliances, where everyone is tightly packed and lives under a super umbrella)
---
rest in piece hoobler
---
mate the ship in itself is something the game could never achieve before the af opatch, but yeah, it's ok not op. all pilot skill, fastest shit out there, huge tank, insane agility, huge resist against laser platforms, no problem here.  
---
They aren't filled with wormholers... They're empty.

MAYBE IT WILL BE WALK IN STATIONS!
---
Of course the Player Empires don't fight wars that they believe they will lose.  When I was first introduced to EVE one rule was drummed into me by every source I perused; "Don't fly what you can't afford to lose."  However, every player was encouraged to go out and fly *something*, even if it wasn't terribly impressive.  Combine that with the fact that EVE has always been centered around the concept that cooperating players can accomplish more than individual players, and large empires only become a matter of time.
---
The only thing preventing large empires from forming more quickly than they did would be the various trust issues between players present in EVE that are so sharply mitigated in other online games.
---
If your problem is that large numbers of players can outperform small numbers of players in the same timescale, you may have been looking at New Eden all wrong.
---
If your problem is that all existing power blocks are unassailable, then you are definitely looking at New Eden through the wrong lens.
---
For anyone not familiar, here is the map of present Alliances.

---
And here is a map of the present Coalitions.
---
[http://www.verite.space/maps/coalition/coalitioninfluence.png](http://www.verite.space/maps/coalition/coalitioninfluence.png)
---
Do you want to shake up the existing Null Security blocks?  Fine.  Do it.  But you are going to have to *commit*.  Because your efforts are going to require more of a combined arms approach than you have ever imagined.  Breaking an Empire's hold over a piece of territory is not just about destroying ships.  It is about destroying *assets*.  In New Eden, the one thing serving as a foundation for all other resources is player time.  You will have to not only declare war, you will have to begin true psychological operations.
---
* Spread propaganda.  Make jokes.  Recruit your enemies, either with laughs, or promises of wealth, or revenge, or anything else you can bring out that works.  In that, reduce your enemies' effective overall numbers.
---
* Encourage guerrilla warfare.  Cloaked campers, annihilating small mining operations, and harassing large ones.  Hit and runs are your bread and butter here.  You want to motivate your own player base to keep at it, and not give the enemy a moment's true peace.  Encourage whatever mindset it takes to keep your privateers going, and make your enemies resource gathering even less fun than before.  In that, reduce your enemies effective numbers for mining.
---
* Actually spy on your opponents.  Send in people you trust to learn more about their operations.  Learn their patterns.  Find their chat channels.  See who operates from where.  Pick a corner of the galaxy, and learn everything there is to know about such a place.  Learn about the people, their personalities, their likes, their animosities.  This will make your other efforts more effective, and allow you to better target your operations.
---
* Spread distrust.  Perform false flag operations.  Convince people to openly turn their coats, and bring as many players as possible with them.  Convince people to stay in place, and feed you their comrades.  Send people you actively *dislike* into your rivals' organizations.  You know the type.  The people who cannot help but stir up trouble in any conversation.  The people who cannot resist the urge to screw with their buddies.  The ones who live only to frustrate each and every sane human being both on Earth and in New Eden.
---
* And, of course, assemble a true battlefleet.  Even if it starts as nothing but a collection of tin can destroyers and tackle frigates.  Find soft targets and hit them.  Eventually, find a hard target, and utterly destroy it.  Turn it into a turning point, or at least claim it is, and create the impression of momentum which favors you and your goals.
---
All of this will, of course, require a massive amount of time, effort, and general dedication, which is why most players do not pursue it.  And that is why the Empires endure.  They allow players without the dedication to do all of this to still participate in the great game of dominion, to feel that they are part of something greater, even if it is only a small part.
---
But the people who do accomplish it, are looked upon as legends in New Eden.
---
I have one Rorq, not paid with plex.  Need build up ISK to afford a couple titans.
---
How's WoW's player count?  It's still near their peak, right?
---
DAOC?  EQ2?  Heck, EQ?  Runescape?  Dwarf Fortress?
---
Old game is old.  Lower-than-peak player count doesn't really tell you all that much.
---
You really think they would bin a huge undertaking like that because of a few scrawled screeds on a bad echo chamber forum?
---

Well, CCP has shown off [Project Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXEo8v6MXGM)
---
&gt; "At EVE Vegas, we showed you the most recent iteration of our vision to provide an engaging and unique FPS experience to enrich the EVE Universe. Our goal for this was always to reinforce the ‘One Universe // One War’ gameplay and create a worthy spiritual successor to DUST 514 that has the potential to captivate not only existing Mercenaries and Capsuleers, but also to attract new adventurers into the ever-evolving world of New Eden. [source](https://www.ccpgames.com/projectnova)"
---
The also showed us [EVE: Echoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6BcQtszj0)
---
&gt; CCP Games is excited to formally unveil EVE: Echoes, a brand-new mobile spaceship sandbox MMO set in an alternate New Eden, the sci-fi universe of EVE Online. Players will be able to experience authentic EVE gameplay on their preferred mobile device and engage in interstellar combat, trade and exploration, as well as many other activities across thousands of star systems. Developed by NetEase Games in conjunction with CCP Games, EVE: Echoes will arrive on iOS and Android in 2019. [from video description]"
---
So we have a mobile MMO ... something, and a FPS that may be for PC this time and holy fuck that might actually work but no it won't because you and I both know they will go with a console for the safer money or some such bullshit instead of the painfully obvious PC crowd that would eat the shit up if it was anything like a successor to Dust. 
---
Hell, look at all the whales that are on Star Citizen. Nerds don't mind spending money on pixels, but you gotta make them fun/cool/something enough to hook us in. It seems CCP is really trying to do that, and I wish them luck. 
---
Good riddance
---
Venting is a completely valid reason to do it, and shareing your concerns with other people that do the same as you do is another good one.
---
I mean, most of the wannabe edgelord twats in Adversity vent off their frustrations both here and in game all the time.
---
People aren't scared that CCP will be shut down by Pearl Abyss, at least not in the foreseeable future. People are worried that CCP is sacrificing the very soul of their to squeeze as much money out of the casual playerbase as possible, leaving the game a hollow shell of its former self where risk and commitment are just illusions and only one playstyle is truly viable.
---
Brilliant
---
Listen, I put a lot of time and energy into my complaints! I've paid like 100$ or more to this company, I demand to make decisions that affect thousands of people. 
---
I think it does.

&gt;a condition in which a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness, arising from a traumatic event or persistent failure to succeed. It is thought to be one of the underlying causes of depression.
---
Yep, fits. 
---
What’s next for you? Another game?
---
I mean if I recall correctly it was after a couple weeks of hate threads on /r/eve and the eve forums, then the fateful gathering of all the big wigs at the time on INN stating they wanted change cause the old system was tedious and only those with the most supers at the time could take and hold sov which denied content....wait where do I remember this from.
---
I've had this done to me. First and only time I'll fall for that. 
---
R.I.P. my maelstrom, you were a fantastic ship while you lasted.
---
Lowsec has worsened considerably. Now every gate has a cluster of system-wide warpable freeport citadels anchored near it to which anybody who feels threatened can tether and become invulnerable. Gone are the days when you could chase a guy around unless he had a POS to hide in. Now he tethers and talks shit.
---
but after four years in the game you had finally just gotten your first capital ship!
---
Go with God, and become the next Genghis Khan of New Eden!
---
&gt;white knighting
---
Now that I've gotten coffee into me ... you uh ... do realize what the term white knighting implies "defending CCP no matter what," right? 
---
I ... wasn't? **If we truly want to stick it to CCP and protest the way things have been going** *(I am a "grey" knight if anything I DO NOT think CCP is infallible LOL)*
---
We need to 
---
1. Sub
---
2. Not buy PLEX
---
Anything else is a vote for a game shaped by its *actual paying customers --* PLEX purchasers.
---
The players aren't 100% the problem. However, we are willfully making the problem worse.  There's a culture of entitlement lately. Fewer subs = EVE profitability relies more and more heavily on PLEX = EVE pushes PLEX more = more people mad = more people unsubscribe = problem gets worse. Logically it follows, best way to protest PLEX \_is to sub and not buy PLEX\_.
---
TLDR: People screaming at CCP won't make CCP change course. *How* we spend our money might.
---
Lost my Anshar (JF) in HiSec, loaded with stuff to sell in Jita.  That hurt but, was my own fault and I learned from it.
---
ok, THAT i can get behind! its been a while since we moved to x64 i guess but maybe they want to keep it if many people are running old cpu's? can't be it..
---
i was just so clueless to this whole thread i had to go in. i also kinda thought a game like eve would benefit alot from more memory available?
---
again, so clueless. 
---
all i know is that you guys praise some entity called bob and i'm into that.
---
The problem isn't too many systems, the problem is that each individual system can be farmed/mined infinitely which means there's no reason to do anything with all that empty space
---
The Orthrus deserves a little more credit, at least if you pick your damage types right, roll some cheap abyssal BCU2, and take a Pyrolancea. It does die to a lot of fits but it's a cheap entry fee for its ability to counter the common Gila and ransom anything with an AB. My fit hits from 58km.
---
You can kill the common Vedmak if you pick explosive and warm the reactive hardener with non-explosive drones:

That said, it dies against most things with MWDs, but you are making me want to drop 2 midslots and try the TD fit...
---
What is your favorite answer to that 600m vaga fit? My last 4 deaths are to those. I know the easy answer is Curse but that's a little blingy for my blood. Neut Gila?
---
There should be asset safety only to another station or citadel you have access to in the same system. That way you can lock peoples assets still, and people would have to reanchor something to get their stuff back.
---
If you have time and some isk left do you mind sending some isk or injectors over? Would be greatly appreciated! IGN darkislife
---
&gt;Wormhole space has certain restrictions.
---
Yes there are some mass restrictions, but there is very little that encourages fighting believe it or not. 
---
The majority of fights happen because both sides opt in to having them, in generally there isn't even something on the line because really nobody is gonna evict a active pvp group for going sorry where not in the mood to get fucked today. 
---
&gt;As for the culture, it’s the Wild West our in nul.
---
No it's not, it's feudalism, with a small nobility of land owners, that are mostly playing eve like an Turn based strategy game. 
---
While the rest of the players are mostly watching netflix. 
---
Like i'm not sure what you on about with the structure war in highsec, like what point are your trying to make there ? 
---
Not when they've proven they're god awful at doing it, with subscriber's money/at the expence of the game people are paying for.
---
Understanding the difference between correlation and causation is a growth area for you, I see.

While true it also takes away some motivation to come back to the game.

Sure ya do. Lol.

Nonono I hate high sec. Im a null player since I started. I think highsec is too safe
---
Well I also don’t give a shit about AT, after CCP made logistics viable, actually my interest in EVE also vanished after logistics boost.
---
It’s like letting your child hold a knife knowing the last 3 times theyve held a knife they’ve fucking stabbed themself.
---
No more games for ccp
---
Oh look more terrible propaganda by the special people. 
---
Yep im planning on using that but cant fly it right now.
---
By introducing new 64-bit code they can easily search for old hidden 32-bit legacy code when upgrading features.
---
Jagex? :thonking:
---
Considering the "self-inflicted" and "learned helplessness" bits had separate conversational targets, I can't see how that works.
---
Who else would “spodbrain” imply? If you didn’t mean goons then nevermind.
---
Without AT ships PL would have never been a threat in EVE. Do you understand the isk value of those ships? 1tril today might seem broken but for the last decade it very much so was and it was that isk from cheating at AT that gave PL the advantage over most others in game. 
---
And this proves, what, exactly?
---
It's long past time to admit the fact that  Hilmar doesn't have a fucking clue what he's doing and needs to be replaced.
---
Totes, just drop 1k suicide gank ships on it.
---
Yeah, caps were much rarer in those days, and you almost never saw them in lowsec. Though I do recall a group of us blowing up a guy mining in his carrier one time. He got real salty in local.

Buzzard scans victim in mission, swap to Orca warp to mission, do some canflipping stuff to make the PvE-Ship engage you (its just an Orca) and then kill it. Let an Alt man the Basi if needed to rep the Orca.

Okay, my hobby is now swimming, I enjoy swimming in my local pool, I pay monthly to do so. The company who operates this pool has now installed a piss fountain that squirts high velocity piss into the air for myself and all the other swimmers to dance beneath. I am now annoyed.
---
It boils down to desirable space and less desirable space. 
---
That difference is currently made by rat type and density. 
---
If CCP makes some space less desirable the residents might look around to move elsewhere. Let's say goons want to move back to deklein as an result.    
---
They either succeed in their conquest, or they don't. Regardless of the outcome after that one shakeup will be virtually the same, just that the location of some alliance might change.

All I hear is is “im jealous I don’t get to go to Iceland wahhhh”

Getting rid of the csm doesn’t mean ccp would hire another dev. So no he didn’t make your point.

I'm upvoting a querns post again. Have you ever considered running for CSM /u/querns_gsf. Not a troll. 
---
So you're... positing that they, in fact, do not have a glimmer of competence? I'm not really sure what you're trying to accomplish by finding a single incident where they posted on a bad forum.
---
i still undock and find people to shoot or get shot at, and almost every time it's happened there's always a chat that ends with "o7 fly safe, praise bob"

no matter what is going on, in-or-out of game, we will always have that and i love that about this place
---
bye retard
---
Well the AT was pointless so yeah, just for retards to feel eLiTe in a game that doesnt require any sort of skill 
---
&gt; First of all, in terms of safety, POS outclasses citadels by A LOT. Even station does. I don't know why ability to hang out outside is so much to you as you could do that with undock invulnerability in stations as well.
---
&gt;station safer than citadel
---
gotta step up the bait game
---
Intentionally stupid.
---

---
What will extracting all your characters achieve other than you know deep down you will return at some point and this is just a temper tantrum.  If you really want to prove a point just biomass all your characters with the skill points left in.
---
Occasionally. Horror stories from our previous CSM members tend to dissuade me, though. 
---
Some food for thought for any others of you reading this: If I so chose to, I could guarantee my election to CSM. All I'd need to do is ask the right people, nicely.
---
Thanks, yeahhh it s expensive ! I have one similar in t2 and it is 870 hp/sec with 140k bufffer (extender instead of buffer for the rig, and t1 for the price) and no implant.
---
I will think about it when i will be space rich :D
---
Lol, fucking why
---
shut up entitled millenial
---
&gt; You'll be staging in one of them, and once it's destroyed, you're rekt. If stuff is moved to another one, that's extra opportunity to wreck it
---
&gt; that's extra opportunity to wreck it.

unironically calling another free dmg capped structure bash opportunity, this is what the game has come to

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Unsubbing tactics which worked during Monoclegate will not work now. If you can't grasp this I don't know what to say to you.

It's mostly people who deleted their toons years ago who come here to stir up the masses. Just ignore it.

Lul remove local tee-hee wormholer btw 
---
That is only part of the issue, and - if it was for this case alone - we wouldn't see titan numbers skyrocketing as hard as they are now. Two more things that, when you combine it all, give you current state of sovnull arms race are: positive feedback loop and lack of lingering cost of having titan fleet.
---
Positive feedback loop is just super umbrella - the more titans you have, the stronger your super umbrella is; the stronger your super umbrella is, the more you're able to mine to build more titans. Back when umbrella size was still building up, we've seen successful dreadbombs hitting whenever mining scale went ahead enough from standby umbrella size, making dreadbombs to kill bunch of Rorquals worth it, even at the cost of entire dreadbomb. With dynamics like that, every group of sufficient size will eventually reach the critical mass that makes suicide dreadbombs of this kind completely unviable - the moment you reach dreadbomb size that generates some tidi, you are basically handing defenders more time to rageping and form up before sending response on grid.
---
Lack of lingering cost is a bit more complex - before Citadel patch, you had three ways to keep a supercapital: you could have dedicated pilot that you had to keep subscribed when you wanted to use it; you could have sitter alt that also had to be subbed, while adding logistics annoyance of switching pilots when you were to use your supercap; or you kept your supercap in XLSMA on POS, that put the ship in moderate risk. Due to that, no group was able to reliably build any noticeable stash of spare supercapitals, and having a supercapital came with essentially a tax of having to keep it subbed regardless of how often you were using it. Between Keepstars and convenience of building in Sotiyo instead of in POS any of this "supercapital tax" is no more - now for big bloc member getting a supercapital is just like getting any other ship, except it's more expensive and can't dock in NPC structures. I'm not sure how much of a factor it was, but decision to get a super before you could leave it docked in a Keepstar while doing other stuff had some drawbacks potential super pilots would consider before buying one. The phrase of "space coffin" kind of illustrates that.
---
That doesn't mean what you think it means. It's not a hip, edgy way to say "something I disagree with."
---
"Do gala event" Pure gold.

In all honesty I have no idea how the community can put a message across to CCP. I know there's the CSM but that is all but ineffective or only focuses on new content. Or in this case, with so many goons in it I imagine a lot of the points I raised aren't relevant to them. I wish posting on the forums would garner some attention but I think posts there are even less relevant than posts on here
---
Casino War is the Political Correct Term.
---
This is a really good thing, I had stuff lost(forgotten) for months because of not having this option

---
No balls

??
---
07 gents.. I'm streaming EVE both on my own and the CCP channel. My focus in game is and has always been non PVP related content, specifically geared towards educating, explaining and showing other aspects of the game than PVP. As mentioned by others, in general if someone streams PVP on the CCP channel it's highly likely they get sniped fairly quickly because some seem to think that is a good way to support the stream.
---
Mind you, I am not saying stream sniping is bad by definition, to be honest the occasional snipe is just content in my opinion. That said though, if it becomes a structural occurrence and if you as a streamer consistently can't get into your game play because you get cut short by a sniper every time you get going it does burn you out fairly quickly. Several streamers are or have been taking breaks from streaming PVP content because of this.
---
So in general, maybe it would be helpful to not try and get screen time and let streamers do their thing. In addition, if you feel that there is not enough PVP content on the CCP channel, why not start streaming yourself? It's easy to stet up  for it and #StreamFleet will be more than happy to welcome and support you. So instead of complaining, why not pick up the gauntlet and show us all what you are made of?

still tho, go for the CSM to both spark more reddit outrage and shit it up with terribad economic ideas. im sure between aryth and you, yall can think up of something really retarded that sounds good on paper.
---
Exactly leaving empty space in null sec free for the taking because it is beneath the spod brains and big fish.  And this is supposed to be a bad thing?
---
That desirable space becomes sought after, and because the cumulative wealth of the "low" value space is greater, conquerable. This variability in desirability already existed in the form of moons. 
---
Also 'low' value space doesn't have to be low purely on grounds of revenue. You can keep isk/hr roughly equal between low density and high density regions,  the difference being isk/hr per person per system.
---
Instead 'high' value systems simply have the revenue density to justify a super umbrella and vertical building. Making them valuable because they can be fortified, and support 'low IQ' gameplay. 
---
Join the club, me and my corp are having a blast in EVE. Have played since 2007 and the game has never been better, everyone I talk to agrees. People are entitled to their opinions, but the un-moderated cancer on this subreddit is affecting the game negatively. New players come here to research and get filled full of the opinions of a vocal minority.
---
There's a difference between constructive criticism and active sedition, and I wish the moderators would learn to understand that.

OCD pattern-based repetition may need some work, however. Patient appears to be caught in a loop.
---
Assuming goons kick out darkness, where do you suppose darkness moves?     
---
Either taking out someone smaller or moving to the vacant delve. 
---
If they kick someone smaller out, that one either kicks someone smaller or moves to delve. Because less diserable space is better than no space.
---
We get content while things settle down. But once they did, it's stale again until the next shakeup.
---
My gods! How could I have left that one out!
---
The "just adapt" was there since the very beginning - things were changing and niches were created and removed. Issue we've seen recently is that more and more niches and ways of playing the game were becoming unviable, turning "adapt" from "pick another playstyle" to "pick dominant playstyle". It's just the most efficient way of playing EVE (in terms of available power) has no counterpart niche that could effectively serve as counterbalance to the playstyle.
---
If you made mission running the best way to build wealth and power, you'd see groups camping and hunting in mission hubs; if you made DEDs the best way, you'd have spike in blops popularity; what is the answer to large scale mining condensed in range of single supercap staging? If "more supers" then the moment any group gets significantly stronger than rest of the game, there's no way of stopping them.
---
CCP did that in the past indirectly and it had the exact opposite result. If sov becomes scarce there is all the more incentive for the big blocs to stomp any weaker entities into the dirt and take everything for themselves.
---
Glad I am not the only one who sees it. Unfortunately, the un-moderated cancer on this sub-reddit is negatively affecting the game as new players come here to research and all they see is a very vocal minority of whiny cry babies and their eve is dead/ruined narrative.
---
I wish the moderators could learn the difference between constructive criticism, and sedition.
---
The cyno is not yet lit o7
---
Come, so you can provide content by being evicted by one of three major power blocks and stand no chance aside from being at the mercy of those three power blocks!
---
Yeah, totally different than NS.
---
I love the big fleet fights and tidi fests! I enjoy when I go into my alliance territory and see civilization! Small gang is boring and so 2010
---
Changes nothing, any semi-competent group would just keep cloaked eyes on every gate to their krab area, and the moment something shows up, a cyno would go up with enough overkill to deal with whatever was able to get there. Removing local allows only those organized large groups that have enough critical mass to curbstomp any random aggression to survive long-term.
---
Lol this is Reddit bro 
---
nah
---
cancelling a sub is a lost sub.
---
biomassing a character is a strong indication that you have no intent of coming back.  people do come back, but most don't biomass on the way out.
---
&gt; It's that rule #1 of Eve is "don't risk what you can't afford to lose", and nobody can afford to lose a titan fleet, so we shouldn't require risking it to win fights, even against other titan fleets.
---
I can not wrap my head around what you are saying here. So what, because no one can afford to lose a titan fleet we should all agree to leave them docked up even if it means losing Sov, all of our stations, all time spent building up that Sov and those stations, all of the goods in all the markets and all the items in all the personal hangers (to asset safety)?
---
And your answer is to make anyone who spent the 300 hours mining and god knows how much ISK and time on skill books have to look at an empty hull nerfed into submission?
---
ほら、オマエは「アホ、アホ、アホ」は言っては面白い。もっと話してください
---
how do you think a jag is supposed to tank 7 Tristans exactly 
---
Lack of balance, absolutely ruined economy, introduction of lootboxes, cancelled AT tournament, layoffs and firing of the community team last year, selling the company to a P2W asian firm, failed chat deployment that's taken a year to fix, tons of bugs and problems, the game's just in a massively downward shit spiral.
---
Sure and then darkness is going to be totally fine forever, knowing goons are in their space?
---
Having variability in the value of regions means there's a latter to climb. The "lowest" value regions will see the most hand changes, while it takes a major build up to hit the largest groups. 
---
Part of the value of "high" value regions IS because they remain stable, isolated from all but the largest of conflicts. Players crave safety and just having regions which are easier to fortify,  would be a huge boost in value even barring differences in isk making potential. 
---
are you....proud of this?
---
Or perhaps /u/jibrish is referencing the fact that his mod job feels like repeating the same thing over and over.
---
Cool PR, I'm gonna go with the ex-CCP GM who was actually there and not doing damage control though.

I was pretty sure he said "they wont give me back the character a third time"

First time I've seen a photo of Hilmar with something over 4 inches............. 
---
If r/eve was even remotely like the playerbase in general then the #1 topic would be how to fit a L4 mission crab boat.
---
Only problem is they stay on reddit and spread their negativity.
---
It's what I do.
---
I can check when I get home, but IIRC I run a dual booster 1400mm Mael and run them pretty easily. I did try a triple rep Hyperion a while back, but after I dropped to 20% hull one time I decided to run something different. 
---
Mmmmmm, this is my favorite. 2 weeks til rapid heavy 2s, and I'll be there, too. Currently at 1080, just need those and I'll be happy for the time being.

Past that point.

He probably got ganked. A blinged Golem could tank every rat site in a null system.
---
No, but the ore is huge.  It takes up about 7,500 m3 space for one site that refines to only 2-3 tricarboxyls.
---
:woosh:
---
Context?
---
It's pretty common knowledge in the business world that angry customers are a good thing, because they actually say something that you can consider acting on. Most customers who are dissatisfied just leave without a word and take their money with them. CCP would be foolish to ignore what goes on here out of hand.
---
I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that if resources were scarce on a level like you are suggesting, all of null sec would be owned by 3 or 4 entities. Part of what makes a region able to support a coalition is ADMs. With constant fighting over SOV, ADMs would be all zeros. It would take 4-5 regions to do what Goons are doing in Delve (as an example most are familiar with). They wouldn't lower the bar. They would still build all the caps, supers, and titans they could. And between the blue donuts would squeeze every other alliance out of the game even faster than they are now. An alliance of &lt;1000 people would have no choice but to choose a super coalition to join...or die whithering in low sec.
---
Sure you are
---
I can understand asking one's gf for more oral.
---
good for you, you do what you want and like in wh space. did the same in my early wh days but we had posses back then. just remember ppl will burn down small corporations for the possible loot piniata. fare well 
---
That's mad gross. :(
---
hi
---
Nah. It's because the Jag is one of the best fast tackle boats. Here, it was used exactly for what it was built for. It's a hard counter to anything that survives based on range control (anti-kyte).  It's ok to have an anti-kyte boat that tanks decently. Any brawler cruiser or BC would eat the Jag for breakfast.
---
You may not realize this, but Sears was the Amazon of its day.  I am talking a long time ago.  They either started or perfected ordering from a catalog, and it was the only way that many people were able to get things in rural areas.  They were the king. 
---
Point being, there is no industry in which throwing all your eggs into one basket is a good idea. 
---
It is constellations and Im pretty sure the same mechanic applies in wh space as well. Wh space is organized into constellations and regions too, iirc.
---
No, neither POCO nor PI are worth your investment in high sec

Not salty, I don't have anything to be salty about, was just conversating. I don't get worked up or salty over random people on the internet, or a game, or the high velocity piss  fountain at your pool lol. I'm sorry that you can't separate your emotions from pixels and obviously can't separate your addiction to Eve. But good luck with all that. Especially the piss fountain.. that's rough

Activision has more brands than just CoD.

Thank you for proving my point.  These companies used their money from their popular products to develop other products.  That is what CCP is doing.  If you think that this is a bad idea, you are mistaken, and if you think that they aren't using any of the money to improve EVE you are mistaken.

---
Godspeed - hit me up on discord if you ever need anything. should be a wakeup call to CCP and everyone here, this man spent his time trying to provide content for eve, and this is how it ends.
---
Failure is part of business.  They will be more guaranteed to fail if they don't diversify.  There may come a day when EVE is no longer popular, but is supported because other games that CCP is making are successful.  Try to take the long view.  
---
Since you’re new, I just want to clarify a couple things you may or may not know (since it’s better safe than sorry). 
---
1) Each planet can only have one customs office. This means you would need to kill the customs office there first, which includes declaring war so you can legally attack it without concord killing you. 
---
2) PI planets scale with the security like most things, so the lower the security, the more PI you will get.
---
3) non-null customs offices have both owner taxes and concord taxes. This means that you’ll be paying more taxes on the same items in high sec vs elsewhere. 
---
If you’re considering PI as primary income I would think carefully about where you set up. Also POCOs are expensive to set up and probably hard to earn a return on unless multiple people are using a planet (for example everyone in your Corp). Just thoughts, and good luck.
---
Later
---
Buy it off the market, problem solved. 
---
I could build a graveyard for all of the things CCP has said they would do in the future, then never did.
---
Only negativity is on reddit.
---
Plenty of people enjoying Eve who never post on reddit/forums.
---
Lowsec is no longer the pvp place it once was. Its riddled with Gnosis + armor gatecamps that have instalock, and then citadels/dropping caps when the gatecamp gets broken up. FW space is actually a decent place to get some good 1v1s but they are becoming less and less common because 5 people just sit at a plex and hold it down, spamming dscan and warp away if anything equal comes to the gate to fight. The majority of the player base has this "i want to win" mentality, whereas it used to be "i want to prove my skill." I'm getting nostalgia just thinking about ransoming someone :'(
---
(.
---
&gt; They said AT would return in the future, for what it's worth
---
They also [promised](https://www.eveonline.com/article/planetary-interaction-impossible-is-our-middle-name) that 'Team Pi' would continue to work on planetary interaction, so that it wouldn't be a 'Jesus Feature', and they'd add more than racing stripes.
---
Team Pi was disbanded.
---
And they wonder why some people buy isk through RMT &gt;.&gt;
---
ok heres the offer
---
i'll stream elite pvp every day up to 8h per day for $10+ per hour
---
seems like ur the type of dude who thinks streams grows on stream trees
---
mine.
---
Yeah, that is my point.  CCP throwing only money at EVE is like someone only investing in horses.  Eventually, someone will come along with something new.  That can either be CCP, and they can use the money they have made in cars to pay for their stables, or they can just go bankrupt when everyone else is buying something else.    
---
This is why they have to invest in other games. 
---
horse = Hard Knocks

Can't you just burn away?

So true, in basically all sub-reddits.

I don't know if you do remember, but I do remember you. I was asking some questions about WH mechanics in the "No question is stupid" thread (it was about rolling statics IIRC) and you gave me some really great advises. Just wanted to give you some thumbs-up o7

Sadly there are more and more LOW POWER structures in J-Space every day, so I don't think anyone is going to evict any active corporations unless there is bigger reason for that.

What's the point of extracting and converting everything to isk you can't spend if you're planning on leaving?  what does it matter what state your account is in, unless you're planning on giving everything away...?
---
In that case, please contact me ingame.
---
For every 1 player actually go out and roam there are 5 players shittalking about capital ships and imbalance
---
I agree with you the abyssal rage was unwarranted but isn't the lack of an AT this year somewhat concerning to you?
---
pgl approves this post since there are no caps???
---
It's also good for discouraging new players from trying Eve.
---
If people could focus on constructive criticism instead of letting their emotions get the better of them, Nerd raging about how they're biomassing all their accounts, and pushing their stupid "eve is dead/ruined" narrative, it might actually be more effective.
---
do you have plan to remove squid or snake? 
---
It's on the character selection screen. Hover over your pilot and it's the "x" on the top right of the portrait.

Right answer.

No i'd have proffered no asset safety, in the end we got a thin sausage dressed up as a ham shank that get's paraded round these subreddits by deluded fools as a victory.
---
The CSM are about as effective as Theresa May at getting a deal.
---
If I had to guess, it would be that there is a larger group of people that actually want to pve as opposed to pvp. They can probably see what the most amount of time is spent on in the game.
---
Have you? I keep an inhib in my sleip for when we hunt capitals. We had a rorq pop a cyno and we deployed an inhib and it never uncycled its cyno the entire time we were on grid (15-20min), and then had capitals cyno in 5-8min after it lit the cyno. 
---
We use plenty of inhibs and do capital hunts, everyone is aware that if they light their cyno before the inhib onlines, it will remain on until they either manually cycle red, or they run out of liquid ozone. Unless there is some kind of hit/miss bug in CCP's coding where it doesn't decycle the cyno, but in our experience, its never decycled the cyno once its already lit and the pilot doesn't manually turn off their cyno.
---

---
Umm, drakes were the mainline ship for quite a while a few years ago. Canes have been the meta for small gang and solo quite often.
---
Ah yes, attack the monument and risk giving them potential news to help them advertise the game :thoinking:
---
What are some examples of the cheating? Not doubting you at all, this is eve after all, I can never seem to get a straight answer out of anyone. They all say the same one instance and say etc. lol curiosity is killing me.
---
A bunch of bombers and my inexperience at flying such a nice ship.
---
Take the wormhole approach (not a wormholer btw), have amoms spawn on a constellation basis, for example I do a Haven in one system. When that Haven respawns it can spawn in any of the systems in the constellation. Then have a constellation have the same amount of sites that ~2-2.5 systems does now. 
---
This would make it so that at any given time the system you want to run sites in won’t have any of the sites you want. Which would also force ratters have to move around, and do sites in systems that may not be as safe, causing them to be extremely vulnerable. This would also severely limit the amount of people that one region can support, causing mega groups to either expand or trim the fat. On top of all this the current renting system would be thrown into chaos, and my not be viable at all, which in my option is a good thing.
---
Why don’t the players that want an alliance tournament arrange their own? It doesn’t have to be as swish and fancy as what CCP put on, but there are plenty of streamers who could cover it and we could have it in a system where everyone could watch - just a suggestion ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I used to love playing the game, but over the past 2-3 years or so ever new patch just made the game worse.
---
OP's post really itches my sides too. "I haven't played the game for 5 years then came back and joined the fastest growing null block in the game that's why you should listen to me".
---
join a Wormhole corp, check r/evejobs
---
The rest of the game is shit, but the true spirit of eve is alive in wormholes 
---
Not particularly.  The AT is a 1%er event.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing, but it is only applicable to a small subset of players and it takes a lot of work and time to setup and run.  
---
I'd prefer they take the time and effort and put it into balance changes.  I also kinda laughed when i typed that as "balance changes" basically means "soon."   
---
You want people to quit, you want eve to die so you can be proven right. You'll do everything in your power to make that reality.

You can't just quit for your own reasons, you're so pathetic you need to seek validation from internet people.

No, eve is shit now cause the updates all suck, shit breaks (and stays broken). Ccp cancels or ignores basic ideas (like fixing shit when it breaks). And instead posts plex sales and announces new ship skins for sale. 
---
Great news everyone, we can trust the csm to take our concerns to ccp, except they are all goons. So I guess in the end goons do win, they ruined the game for everyone. Congrats.

he typically uses a worm or other small hard to kill(by battleship weapons) ship to scram you infinitely while demanding a ransom.
---
if you refuse to pay. he'll happily scram you for hours until your afk, switch ships(from alt that warps to him), and kill you.

hence the discussion about the excessive scram time, as its not really clear. and i've seen some tickets say its not legal past 2 hours.  other say it is.  grey area.
---
You made a lot of good and short videos. I liked them.
---
AT wasn’t what eve about. That can be found in lol or dota. Eve about working with others to accomplish a goal.
---
For Imperium or Test that empire building. For nc. pl ph controlling the mindless masses into doing the bidding of there overlords and screw them over in the process.
---
&gt; we should all agree to leave them docked up even if it means losing Sov, all of our stations, 
---
This is literally what goons did during wwb/casino war, because it was *far* cheaper than losing their titan fleet. 
---
But that's not what I wanna argue. My argument is, we should change the meta so you can fight the war and avoid losing your sov/space/etc, without needing to deploy titans. Deploying titans should give an advantage, but it shouldn't be so overwhelming that there's no counterplay other than deploying more. 
---
This will allow people to commit to fights with a manageable level of risk, without needing to ask "if I lose this fight will my alliance be evicted to highsec?" (or accepting that if the opponent drops supers, you'll lose 100% of your ships with 0 kills because you aren't prepared to take the ultimate risk and counterdrop). 
---
As for the people who did mine titans already - they'll still be really good tbh, especially if aoe DDs aren't changed much. 1k dreads vs. 1k dreads &amp; 200 titans is gonna go heavily to the side with titans. They just won't be invincible or isk efficient anymore.

---
Its not about just no AT but rather the general direction the development has taken. Eve business model has changed from normal players to multi account whales for starters. So a shit ton of the development is focused on those whales instead of players at large. And what is good for multi account whales, is by default good for the bots, hence rise in botting. So as bots and automated AFK characters rise, actually active characters keep falling, and its getting to extreme proportions now.
---
Likewise with everything in the game, including ship balance, its all geared towards that. More caps, more need for multi account Rorqs and AFK ratters etc. and the infrastructure to support them. 
---
A lot of people are disgusted and royally pissed off and quitting the game over this already.
---
Meanwhile, they are really fucking up on shit for regular players, take the last few events for example, they came out with some super shitty scheme to force mining for event participants to force them to buy plex and injectors and sub or plex more accounts and inject them for mining. A lot of people really hate mining cause its the most fuckingly retarded and boring shit in any game ever made, and they fucking forced it. Now with the most recent event they have taken this to whole new heights that people never thought that anyone with half a brain would do, but they did and surpassed that. Add to that bugs, like really fucking bugs and untested content, as in like, late alpha, not even beta bugged stage, and they released the shit live. 
---
On top of that events were originally designed for newbs, and they removed that and made them to be comparable in difficulty to be compelted by max skilled chars in heavily blinged ships, which means either you are a very long time vet, or you again buy more plex and use injectors to get to that point. They pulled a fucking Bait and Switch on this. Like seriously and for real, not just a figure of speech, but actually perfectly fitting the definition.
---
Then as the latest thing finally they canceled the AT, on top of all that other shit. Granted that it had super low viewership, but it was also super low resource activity and kinda an icon in the game.
---
So put all these thinsg together and its just getting real bad. Many people unsubbed, many simply logged off and not logging back in not plexing their toons again, etc. etc. And its super bad because we keep getting more bots and multiboxers while less and less actual players in the game.

Someone who has soo much experience they failed to name a single memorable war to prove their credentials?  Wow, such personality.  
---
I don't play Argumentum Ad Authority, I play with the words people type, and you shit bads have typed some horrendous shit here fam.
---
Guess which two I have trained.
---
Pure Attention Whoring. Like Chessurs dramatic quit
---
They might not care about shitpost itself but they care about $$$, and you'll be surprised how many people come and read shitposts nowadays before hopping into an MMO and how much $$$ its costing them.
---
Open world cruiser 1v1 PVP, no. (Is there even such a thing?) But the Abyss has more ways to win than blowing up your enemy.
---
Another shit bad falls to lack of reasoning and resorts to character attacks.
---
Lmao, I mentioned tether because bumping constantly with large fleets is fun and engaging content.
---
Keep being butthurt no one remembers your little tiny side war.
---
It just came out. Idk
---
I will bite.
---
What problem.  Can you identfy not only the implied issue you see, but the driving mechanics both player motivated and game enforced?  
---
I will wait, but I doubt you have the mental facilities to do so.
---
Thats why i said they shouldnt get to go to iceland eh.
---
Old but gold &lt;3
---
&gt; allot of answers
---
Yeah, but will any of them be true?
---
Pandemic Horde for large fleets of alot of players, good content as enemies come to us. literally 0 requirements to join.  growth opportunities are limited but growing as Horde is expanding into a larger power.
---
Karmafleet for fleets supported by skilled players,  part of the strongest group in the game. good growth opportunities
---
Brave Newbies for....well Brave.  they pretty fun. not sure what else to say about them. they part of Legacy...or Test(i know...alliance vs coalition. most people still call legacy test).  bad news is lately due to Test(alliance), they've been viewed as little more than goon pets.  kinda unfair to brave....but when test keeps spamming the goon batphone....
---
dreddit is the test group for...well reddit.   you post here, they accept ya.  unless your me.  who will probably be lynched for not praising test.   sorry, your goon pets(pet : coalition who relies on a different coalition to win its battles), prove me wrong.
---
E-UNI and Red or Blue alliances are 3 groups in highsec.  E-UNI being tutors/teachers and generally nice people.   Red and Blue being...well an unending war.  good for experience through combat.
---
and yeah....go nuts.
---
Yea I actually prefer the cap meta of today to my past periods of activity.  
---
I do wish that CCP would rebalance BS though.  Ever since the warp speed changes they have felt awful to use in a fleet that takes gates.  It seems most often they just get bridged in anyway.  I would love to see BLOPS buffed into a more mainline ship or a new jump capable BS added, especially one that’s good against capitals.
---
I actually think carriers are OK balance wise, they are just too cheap.  A fully fit carrier should cost at least 2 bil.
---
In exchange for supplying access to the game, which presumably should remain as good as or better than it started per month.
---
&gt;Ore belts getting smaller or longer to respawn in heavily farmed systems
---
The opposite is actually true currently. Heavily farmed systems get the ADM level up, which allows you to install more iHub upgrades, which generate more spawns. Both combat and ore anomalies.  
---
Not necessarily.
---
If you want to grow join a small corp fostering you to do more than approach and press F1. Finding such a group isn‘t as easy as joining a big null alliance but it‘s possible to find.
---
I'm the type of person who streams periodically in my off time because I enjoy it.  You seem like the type of person who wants to make a career out of it.
---
Just the retarded ones
---
lol you don't know me very well
---
" Ops succes ! "
---
why is this downvoted? Even though its a Goon, its true. No need to downvote for that. :s
---
“Station games are gone and I don’t like it. Also buff supers more please.”
---
No I meant you would probably have been streaming anyway on &lt;channel x&gt; but instead you are now streaming on &lt;channel y&gt; and CCP are giving you a small incentive to do so.  That's what I meant by &lt;already streaming&gt;.
---
go mine
---
I think it is very clever.  It has enough information that skilled players can do it in under 30s, but enough room for skill that a low-SP, high-skill player (eg, vet on an alt, smart noob) can overcome a bit of the SP deficit with better skill.  Something that a simple %hack chance does not factor.
---
Give 1 example of tangible hindrance to a player/corp from Bot's injecting ISK at a rate players could do without a bot.
---
They made the amount of SKINs balanced across ship types.
---
Oh, right, this makes sense, i agree. I mean i would still go for cutting out half of the space AND decrease the sustainability of the systems. But that just me. 
---
Solid point. Idk...
---
&lt;3
---
My personal favorite is this one:
---
Nothing in high slots 
---
3 Medium Ancillary Shield Booster 
---
Loaded with Fed Navy Cap Boostet 50
---
5mn restrained MWD
---
Faint epsilon scoped  scram
---
T2 nanofiber x2
---
FFR Enduring ADC (I don’t have skills for t2)
---
Operational Solidifier I
---
Anti Explosive Screen Reinforcer II
---
More commonly, I’ve seen fits with the third ancil rep replaced with a point, and a nos added in the high slot. That also buys enough fitting space for a t2 scram. 
---
If you want to do dps, and not be pure tackle, usually I see one ancil rep, a navy shield extender, point, scram, and mwd in mids. 3 rockets in the high slots, and a nano + adc in the lows. Can’t remember what the third low slot should be, but it should be pretty obvious based on how much fitting you have left. 
---
Not to refute you... I would say that 90% of the time you are right! However, Stuka wh fleets are amazingly fun (for INIT, I don’t know what it is like having to fight 100+ bombers) =)
---
This is stupid easy to do, and you can do it in a half-pvp fit ship.
---
All my bug report Reproduction steps include: Play the fucking game

His alt was mining as he typed
---
legit mind boggling - that viewpoint is advocating slave labor
---
think about what u just wrote lol cant make this shit up
---
I’m in a Corp which is that old, with a number of OG members.  Players take breaks and come back.  It’s the people and relationships that make Eve different.
---
Gray essay
---
whew, why so mad? I thought we had a moment back there? 
---
Well you can QQ about constructive criticism and analysis until there is no one left to complain about this garbage fire that we call a video game
---
CCP listens to money
---
No friend. Most people who won eve are hanging around here just to see how the game develops. And most of the time they are happy they quit since it's only going downhill. I get why he made his post and it's a good post. 
---
That's not how this meme is supposed to work
---
I can never tell whether ‘get rid of local’ kids are stupid or intellectually dishonest. That single change won’t come close to fixing things, and for most groups it’d make PvP even more tedious and uneven.
---
I don't even think the AT was really a "mass exposure" event. What I liked about it was that it gave the community something to come together around. I'll never forget sitting in teamspeak watching the AT with my corp mates. 
---
There was 0 constrictive about it.  What did he propose?  It was solid whine, and half of it was about modern internet etiquette where dick jokes and such are not really the style of 2019, thats more a 2003 thing.
---
This is not an eve centric phenomon.  Infact eve is one of the few fucking MMOs not hemorrhaging subs.
---
This fact kinda puts everything in a very different context... Thanks for sharing!
---
Oh man, how much I miss the old ingame launchers. Still used it through the exe file even when the !BUYPLEXNAO¡ launcher existed. Untill they coded it out... 
---
So you expect an actual hourly wage from CCP for streaming their game on the CCP channel?  Is that what you're saying here?
---
They could just add a small bit of scan res and warp speed. 
---
Bs locking speed is painful
---
Credit card fleets.
---
Regarding Monoclegate: 
---
&gt; Eventually CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson issued an apology to the players. But even this short appeasement wasn’t what it seemed; according to Blood, Petursson didn’t actually write it.
---
&gt; “He had members of our storyline team – a group responsible for writing in-game content and fiction – put it together,” he says. “He was either so out of touch, so arrogant, or perhaps both, that he couldn’t find the words to say himself. They bailed him out big time.”
---
that's a big yikes from me..  Also explains a lot.
---
What if I told you that "balances" were in fact artificial demand shifts in the eve economy?
---
Cancelling the AT is a big "fuck you" not even because of theres no tourney to watch its more a sign that ccp does not give a flying fuck about pvp that isnt done in supers or they dont give a shit about you unless you are subbing 20 rorq accounts. Small gang is dead and any hope that those players had of ccp making roaming small gangs a thing a gain died with the AT
---
Alright for AT being canceled out. I still don't understand that. However working on outdated software to propose updates for the players is just putting a guillotine above CCP head. It is incredibly complex and troublesome to get something working properly and yet almost impossible to do once the code is too old. Refactoring and updating the game for later better faster implementation seems like a wise but late move. CCP has to have some balls to call it out like that, and I approve their efforts to keep the game up to date. Even tough most of the player base like to cry like little bitches because they don't have their meal. KUDOS the the dev team working hard. I hope you will make it trough in time. 
---
&gt;First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—  
---
      Because I was not a socialist.   
---
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—  
---
      Because I was not a trade unionist.   
---
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  
---
      Because I was not a Jew.   
---
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.   
---
Also the summer everyone was busy with the war, so we need to make up for all the missed time 
---
Both of your examples are examples of business not adapting to innovation 
---
The closest thing in eve i can think of is eve going free to play which personally i'm not sure if it was even good or not for eve 
---
so no not really good comparisons. 
---
a good comparison would be that sears started opening up furniture stores or something similar, this is what you want ccp to be doing. investing in other types of games. By what you have said sears would have failed anyway 
---
I'm honestly getting a bit tired of listening to all hail corporate people like you on here praising and defending CCP driving eve into the ground like they have been doing and ccp is going with them. CCP dies or lives on eve, Even if they manage to make 1 game not a complete failure then with their current corporate policy i just don't see that game being a long term success like eve
---
ok you goonie goon now im 100% certain ur jebaiting
---
despite that lets make an easy to understand example for u and everyone
---
if u build brick houses as a job and ur really skilled and professional at it
---
then someone wants you to build theirs for meems
---
what would u think of that?
---
Hush hush, quickly back to sucking spod!
---
And remember: always take your medication and never leave your rorqual/umbrella EVER again!
---
I have been playing since 2006 and will have to respectfully disagree with you. Try venturing out this echo chamber and talk to people are actually playing the game, different story. 
---
I mean like a catastrophic reefest
---
Thinking about cutting available space is matter of preference - I'm almost exclusively interested in kicking others' sadcastles, so lots of space is better - more places to logoff stuff, more distance to find and abuse some small mistake of someone moving their belongings across, takes longer for whatever allies or 3rd parties to bring emergency response to stuff that's happening. I'm sure other people will look at it differently.
---
can confirm he used both words and the next thing i know he got an upvote
---
Hilmar failed horribly and probably unconsciously blames the EvE community for his failures. 
---
And I ignored you because it's a stupid point and you're a dumb individual.  
---
I also still don't care if you know it happened, or if you can Google it. I also have some concern about your memory if you can't recall the displacement of a coalition entrenched in the same sovereignty as long as most people can remember but you *can* recall a nonexistent and specifically impossible mechanic that has never and will never exist as justification for your completely idiotic opinions.
---
I swear please don't let this be some blob fight. 🙄
---
Uhhh, idk about tidi dude.
---
I feel like if you have enough pilots In j-space or k-space, it will still tidi.
---
Didn't that hard Knox fort takedown have tidi?
---
&gt; Supers in Esoteria can respond to escalations in Paragon Soul and Feyth with one mid, so SkullU and PL are only going to be able to pick off the occasional stupid ratting super with a dreadbomb before Titans and Supers show up....just like today.
---
One mid is the difference between your dreads dying and moonwalking. It's the difference between "it's ok to drop supers" and "we're literally in range of their staging." 
---
You know why you don't see the 40, 50, 60 dread bombs that people used to drop on response fleets? Because of this: 
---
&gt; A lot of our cap pilots get kinda annoyed at being held in reserve on current drops, so them getting to drop more often would be a bonus.
---
What's the point of dropping dreads on the response fleet when you know that the faxes will just come pouring through? If those faxes had to take a mid first...it's a different story. 
---
I think your analysis is seriously lacking a firm basis in reality. 
---
Change from intermediate/ interval in your settings (can’t remember which) 
---
Also, what's hilarious about this claim is that Hilmar's Twitter feed is full, perfectly worded English so unless someone writes his Tweets for him (lol?) that's a full on lie.
---
Abyssal is bad its just same old boring pve with a steep investment with the added addition of there being less people in space, npc third parties do literally nothing, eve is hemmoraging subs if you consider that consecutive online has plummeted since 5+ years ago and thats with all the bots and 20+ rorq players. Suggestions have been made to make this game not shit and ccp hasnt listened/doesnt care
---
No one wants new content everyone wants them to go back and fix the hilariously broken shit they  did 2 years ago
---
Amsterjam fest is coming closer! Can’t wait!! 
---
It was amongst the first things I tried. No dice.
---
Null **IS** owned by like 5 different big blobs. And if goons had to expand to five regions, they couldn't maintain the security for krabbers they now have. Which is the entire point. And if CCP took out skill injectors and capped the number of caps you can build per system to 1, along with making caps harder to produce, it would drive conflict around territory. And if a coalition can't expand enough to support itself, it will bleed members, keeping the game dynamic.
---
It's an AMA, why not just ask what you want to know instead of trying to deride what you can only speculate on?
---
Fair enough
---
My first real PvP loss in this game was a shield tanked harbinger which I lost to a battle rorqual. Still feel the shame of it today.
---
I think that would be cool but should be a truck ton of lp
---
Fair....I probably should have written capital instead of carrier.  "Akshully" people need to go home though holy shit.
---
Just an add-on to what you said about Brave: Test is seen as pets to Goons because it seems like Test can't do a major operation without calling Goons for support. I disagree, but that's certainly the perception. 
---
Brave has the same kind of relationship with Test. Brave does "ok" as their Voltron alliance without Test but let's face it, we need Test for anything big.   
---
Brave is NOT however Goon pets.  I mean, you could make a case that we are pets of the pets of Goon but really the best way to classify our relationship with Goons is "frienemies".  We fight goons daily with reasonably balanced numbers and are happy that they bring us constant content right to our door. But I can't think of a single time when we teamed up with Goons ourselves. If Goons and Brave are ever in the same fleet together it's because it's a Legacy fleet where Test batphoned Goons.
---
For OP, I think all the newbie-friendly corps offer everything you can want and need. The difference is just culture. I can only speak to Brave Newbies culture in that is to stay classy, fly brave, and have the most fun per hour.
---
To the dude that reported with this:
---
&gt; Why do you let rampant concern trolling go unmoderated? New people come to this sub to research
---
Mods are volunteers and we are not on every second of every day. There's not much benefit in removing a thread with 60 comments that is 8 hours old unless it has something very clear cut (doxxing or whatever). In fact if you do that people start to riot (this is literally what led to that whole 'mod strike' fiasco last year). I would have removed this garbage thread if I caught it sooner, but I did not. The mod team feels the same way. 
---
95% of what we do is literal paper pusher work that is very boring and uninteresting. There's also a lot of things that are unreasonably complicated to deal with that require a lot of 'training' time (Think stuff like B4R's) for new mods which bogs down current mods in the mean time plus burns people out. So we can't just throw unlimited warm bodies at the problem and it's still pretty much a massive time sink full of paperwork (perks being I can do whatever I want with my flair and that's really about it).
---
so tl;dr: volunteer work force with very limited resources, very poor tools (reddit), and a community that is effectively a powder keg that is hyper sensitive to every single removal, ever. Plus you have entire alliances trying to influence opinion here that do not hesitate to get 'their guy' on the team or remove the 'other guy' the moment an opportunity presents itself.
---
Can you imagine quitting during 2010 and coming back to the game right now going "Gee I'm having the best time!"
---
This in particular makes no fucking sense *at all*:
---
&gt;Back in the old days I remember staying camped at stations and couldn't do shit. Now we have some nice fights.  
---
"Dude it was a total bummer during the game's Golden Era when I was getting camped into the station but now I'm in the biggest alliance in the game and we're **totally owning!!!!**"
---
Holy fuck this guy has no self respect.
---
:wheelchair:
---
No, tell me you didnt hear right. Those bastards where the only one undocking.
---
:: it's not broken it's a feature
---
According to the losing side. :)
---
Running with Wolves are the Best bunch good you having fun we are not
---
Username checks out.
---
Yes but that had nearly 2000 people involved. K-space would have tidi just the same.
---
Most fights never get big enough to trigger tidi because of mass limits etc.
---
Ah, yes, shooting citadels in high-sec. The pinnacle of content and intriguing gameplay. You're right, none of the problematic game design that CCP has wrought over the past five years has any effect once you...divorce yourself from most of the game's content, I guess.
---
A thousand bots cry out in terror.
---
Damn. I never realized that. I always do solo PvP but in my channel though. I will change that on Sunday 6am EVE time. PvP bois
---
The fact that it doesn't say anything about anchoring explains a lot.
---
A contract is a meeting of two minds, it can't be value only one way.
---
I have nearly double that on my main, but did I earn it over nearly a decade of playtime (was I even playing a lot during that time or just paying the bill?) or did I make my first character an hour ago and inject it all? 
---
What did you expect. The "QFC" is a joke.
---
I'm not playing the game anymore. Nor do I plan on wasting more time on it so I can't really "talk to the people who are actually playing the game". And maybe part of this subreddit is still playing? Maybe they are even agreeing with everything that has been going on. Maybe not. You don't know that. I don't know that. Nobody knows any of that. 
---
&gt; she walked because they told her they were selling to Pearl Abyss
---
Is that actually the reason? What's she up to now?
---
Some people just like this playstyle, and - at least from my perspective - there was short time when Rorquals online were great. Before supercap umbrellas became unstoppable content denial there was a lot of good fun in either baiting out random supercap response to nuke them with dreads, or just murdering dozens of Rorquals at once because nobody in standing fleet had guts (or saying) to call the jump.
---
Abyssal shit is OP. Luckily it's mitigated by the low drop rates -&gt; High ISK cost.
---
flashbacks to that one retard who died to a newbro fw algos
---
&gt;I've said pieces of it in other threads I'll say it here.
---
Please Stop, just because you feel strongly about it doesn't mean it's a good idea, as evidenced by the people in this thread tearing it to shreds.
---
Yup I bet most people in here don't even play they just want to cry and vent cuz it's  lives are empty with out eve since they quit. 
---
SoaSE "got me through" a quarter of university. It's great.
---
It is a 100% joke but they were the only dudes providing content
---
p much
---
Oi bby dont say that more holes need to be explored ;)
---
Yes, you should not undock &gt;100M in an industrial directly in Jita or Amarr. Make a transport contract to move it 3-4 jumps away, that's cheap. Pick it up from there. Or search in Evemarketer for an opportunity to buy somewhere else. You have much better chances that nobody will notice you, then.
---

lmfao
---
Just remove tidi from your key points. There is tidi in j-space even if it rarely happens, it's still a possibility. 
---
The mass limits do USUALLY keep fights smaller and more interesting, but not always. 
---
pve player? yes
---
wh player? you guys aren't fucked yet,should be worth
---
non-wh pvp player? ccp just cancelled the at which doesn't bode well for you
---
You can go first. Your post heavily implies that the game is fine and healthy, and people shouldn't complain and just 'adapt'. If i am correct in this assumption, what would lead you to this conclusion?
---
And if i am not correct, wouldn't your last point - Whining without solutions - Also be applicable to yourself?
---
The game is not in a good state right now. There's no easy solutions until there's a cultural shift at CCP, back to the way they were before 2009-ish. The problems can't be fixed by tweaking existing mechanics, they're just a symptom, not the cause.
---
Compare the story Hilmar often tells - When he found out about how players used jet cans - To the way the game is being designed since about 2011.
---
&gt; The hardest thing in getting a fight any more outside Sov slogs is tricking the opponent into thinking they have the upper hand so they'll actually engage.
---
It really mystifies me that so many groups have difficulty with this.  Granted I have the resources of Horde at my disposal, but it's not *that* hard to present an engagable target for people.  If someone brings 30 Caracals to my doorstep, I gain **nothing** from forming 80 Caracals myself.  They just run from the fight, and never come back to boot.  All I've done in trying to make it easy mode is blueball myself and my members.  Forming 80 Corms gets me and the 80 dudes I'm leading an actual fight because the Caracals can take that fight and do okay.  I'm not going to get 95% efficiency but who the fuck cares?  That 95% fight **never actually happens**.  A 70% fight might.
---
You are taking my post way too literally.
---
honestly, while i lose respect for test by the day,  i love Brave.  they are always up to something. just a pitty they with test...
---
test keeps claiming "oh but our lone alliance was vs your coalition" and we have to point out they brought brave(or another member of Legacy), so its coalition vs coalition. 
---
&gt; whilst creating a new mmo with eve money just further upset people
---
AFAIK they have not released any information on the financing of the new MMO. You have no idea which financial method they have in place (or even what they plan to do with it when the projects gets furhter alone). It is very common for developers that self publish to find other, bigger, publishers to finance projects.
---
Plus it's a dumb opinion to have. CCP shouldn't use profit to make another product? What are you even saying right now. If you want Eve to live as long as possible then you want CCP to have the best financial health possible. 
---
If they threw every penny directly into Eve and never diversified their nest egg all it would take is one extremely unprofitable event to happen (for example: a lawsuit) and that could permanently endanger the future of the game. If they had multiple income streams especially in products that haven't peaked... they are far more likely to deal with disasters and remain solvent as a company without getting bioware'd or sierra'd.
---
They could also afford to take chances with Eve without endangering the existence of the company. You said it yourself:
---
&gt; ccp priorities have been out of whack for the last 4 years
---
It's almost as if they are making very safe business decisions with Eve rather than taking risks with bigger payoffs. Safe business decisions often result in bad game decisions to the common player (constant new ship skins for example).
---
M'lord!
---
&gt; you want eve to die so you can be proven right
---
It's already dead. I'm speaking to players that are, for whatever reasons, still deluding themselves into thinking that CCP is making a grim-dark, unforgiving, pvp game. 
---
That eve was patched out of existence over the last 4 or so years. 
---
boring dude...nothing is worth loging in.this abundance of resources,plus this shit citadels and rorquals lead to a boring game....also fuck super proliferation(wish they got  servers capable of supporting big fights).those measures they taking in game look like are ordered by some1 that is out of game,far away from whats going on...im thinking of quiting also,anyway i play less and less,no point on logging on a boring pve game
---
It makes me wonder what EA asked Respawn to do, and what we may not have seen yet. 
---
"Small gang is dead and any hope that those players had of ccp making roaming small gangs a thing a gain died with the AT"
---
explain?  The AT is completely different from any small gang roam i've ever been on.  You are either ganking people or running away, neither of which tactic are used in the AT.  In real eve, fights are never fair and never balanced. 
---
Just because the game isn't exactly what you specifically want it to be, doesn't mean other people are not enjoying it.
---
well done sir nicely pointed
---
And why cant they do both? Because they laid of a ton of people!
---
It always about the money.
---
The minmatar event was the only one I really liked, but I’m pretty new. Being all in hisec means it can’t be farmed under a super umbrella, and with all the wardecs it also isn’t too safe for most players. 
---
Also looting people’s loot from under their nose was fun, managed to sell a akin for 159 mil back to a Test guy who killed the battleship I took it from. Unfortunately I vastly underestimated the price the skin, since it has 300 mil buy orders up right now. 
---
Also having to choose between wasting time saving slaves or just ejecting the extras into space was pretty funny 
---
They really hate EVE.
---
Not if you're trying to convince people to move wh space. 
---
I'm not arguing against living in j-space, I love it too, just don't beat around the bush. Its eve, be accurate and cold like:
---
There's tidi in j-space still but it's rare and almost not relevant. 
---
&gt;  Also buff supers more please
---
Excellent reading skills. I say basically the opposite. 
---
well i can't speak for anyone else, but i'm close to doing it too because the one type of pvp i enjoy (solo roaming in faction frigates) is dead as fuck. it began with the assault frig adcu which removed any sort of ability requirement for tackling, spodbrains can now ram and scram from 50km away with no consequence and u either run or die. add to that all the hours of traveling you have to do + all the camps and blobs, it's just too much of a timesink, a lot of the time with nothing to show for it. basically every change ccp is making promotes safety and krabbing because more alts (particularly capital ones) means more subs and more extractors sold and they have too big a target from PA to meet to concern themselves with anything except profit. the game's not gonna die because the vast majority of players are carebears and f1 pushers so this direction suits them perfectly. people are bitter because it used to feel special and challenging. it's becoming another dumbed down farm simulator where you can achieve anything trough grinding
---
Underrated comment.
---
let them play minning online....at one point they gona eat each other....if game dont go off till then
---
I still think /r/eve needs ESI enforced flair. If you aren't active, aren't playing, aren't relevant, aren't in a group, /r/eve should know.

You're a moron. Some of the best memories I have have come from eve. I've developed lasting friendships in this game. I *desperately want eve to succeed.* You've been playing since 07; congrats. I've been playing since early '05. Have we satisfactorily compared dicks? Playing for a long time doesn't make you less of an idiot. Just because you and the people you talk to are happy doesn't mean that eve is in a good place. if you can't even handle someone airing their opinion on an internet forum without getting your panties in a bunch and unironically telling people to step out of the echo chamber maybe just don't fire up the ol' browser next time. Careful; it's scary out there where you aren't protected from other people's opinions.
---
I never said "nobody enjoys eve it sucks." I think it's abundantly clear that the majority of the playerbase in nullsec is extremely pleased with buffs to safety, krabbing, and the removal of effortful reward. 
---
Anyone that wanted to play an unforgiving, hard, game should look elsewhere and quit though. CCP will never, ever, make something difficult or risky ever again. 
---
Hence the oft cited jeer targeted at PL of having "not adapted" to 'new eve.' 
---
Wow you sound mad, how is Impass treating you?
---
&gt;What did he propose?
---
Guessing you didn't bother to read it then?
---
  \&gt;I mean, asset safety ffs. Can you imagine if that was in the game from the beginning? Take that shit out. Remove insurance from all capital ships. 
---
\&gt;CCP don't seem to realise that the playerbase isn't calling out for new things. The playerbase and the game need finished features. It needs a look back at rebalancing existing aspects of the game every now and then after having some time go see how the recent content additions have impacted them. 
---
i dont belive them anymore
---
so two of these end up in the same pocket and they ransom each other... or something?
---
That's exactly right. Sure, there are too many caps and supers. They usually don't prevent you from getting a fun fight, though; that Nyx on grid just ends the fun sooner. Grab some t1 battlecruisers or assault frigs and head out.
---
The odyssey expansion was the last big exploration overhaul iirc, and is often regarded by bittervets as the last "good" patch. Data / relic overhauls, a ton of probing QoL and the introduction of the Astero and Stratios, two of the most popular ships in eve for solo / small gang play.
---
Tell me about it, such a bunch of ego focused drama queens and diva's it's unreal. The funniest part is them all circle jerking about how much they hate CCP, the game isn't perfect but this bunch of tossers should be forcibly biomassed for making a complete drama out of a non-issue for a majority of players.
---
I'd go so far as to say that if CCP put out a general statement that all the cry babies are welcome to unsub and fuck off,  I'd actually respect them a little more.
---
Bring on the downvotes, you elitist bunch of wankers.
---
You're right, but my point was Eve fills a niche that few other games do, and there's definitely demand for more games like Eve so I wish they would just cater to their audience.
---
&gt; It seems that things are constantly going downhill :/
---
If you get all your eve news from reddit it does. People have been unsubbing and biomassing their 80000 toons since the day the game came out. 
---
i welcome to stain the romanian wing....hai la tata la relice :))
---
No one else does either, according to this massive chain of comments
---
&gt; TEST has enough carriers to easily cover Paragon Soul, Esoteria and Feyth in a crush-all-roams umbrella.
---
This kind of crush-all-roams umbrella is what CO2 had back in Impass in 2017, and this size of umbrella - strong enough to crush whatever random roams, not strong enough to be able to deal with well prepared targeted dreadbomb - is exactly what should be maintainable with proper resource density.
---
One mid is insane amount of time when dealing with dreadbombs. Often you don't plan for being able to extract after a drop (at least when using dreads), but you have to plan for how much time you have before umbrella starts jumping on grid - even if you look at videos from dreadbombs in Delve across 2017-2018, there is a lot done by them to buy enough time to get a kill: cyno inhibitor, drag bubbles towards cyno beacon, dropping when defense umbrella is busy dealing with some insignificant roam and there's more talk on comms etc. And that's again general idea behind it - make it physically possible to be able to strike sovnull residents and make meaningful damage that is worth the effort and resources without having to do full deployment war-like thing.
---
&gt; Human nature is to band together into larger groups. The limit is the ability of the group to have a coherent identity, which is a function of communications. We have plenty of communications technology to keep the large alliances feeling like a coherent group, even when they cover lots of space.
---
Yet it's quite likely different standing fleets will end up using different comms just to keep things clear and understandable, which will lead to people - at least for their day-to-day activities - mainly sticking to people they usually play with. It wouldn't change much in terms of alliances and coallitions working together, but as a result you'd have those big alliances be de facto split when it comes to day-to-day activities. And this opens path to new players on the field emerging, just instead of forming from scratch, they could form from already existing and established group that plays together. It's not certain, but it is a possibility to be considered.
---
if he and his corp enjoy it, good for them. 
---
I don't care about the space part. The closest competition that looked to be on the horizon was shaping up to be Pathfinder Online, but that seemed to fizzle out.
---
Just Rorqual mine so you can do the epic empire building!!
---
Excellent. Much better.
---
The Casino War is the reason for Delve. Thanks for that btw
---
You can't really disagree on facts. 
---
WE MISS YOU TO AVAREN. COME BACK TO US, THERE ARE CATS TO HERD AND SHIT.
---
Nothing against 64 bit itself but we'd rather have something working for a while instead of the scheduled regular breakages. And Bob is definitely praised regardless.
---
It's just too bad we all got hyped up about it for the last 3 months or so, and then you placed out leaving us with no AT or The Pit. Sadboi
---
&gt; So, I guess, you could say "it is about money," in as much as CCP leaned themselves via layoffs; however, they are not cancelling the AT because "they don't have the money to hold it." That's actually ridiculous.
---
I'd honestly argue something a lot simpler. Instead of 2 events this year they have 8. They traded Fanfest in their backyard for 7 unique events in different locations across the globe (plus Eve Vegas). Each event has a huge amount of planning and work required so it's likely that the community team is simply overwhelmed this year.
---
There is that cat in the box called hisec, that will always function as å failsafe for effort,  if 0.0 dips beneath å sertain income,  you can be sure players flock there rather than invade for resources.. 
---
Still on stage 1 after so much time. Ah well.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA do you know how much money CCPearl Abyss makes because of them
---
It's still an ass ton of work paying management companies for this, if you can even find one that meets your needs (aka, available, willing and capable). Not to mention insanely expensive. They'd be better off hiring people to do it internally but given how long job postings stay up on their site I doubt that would fix the issue (presuming they decided to hire more community folks).
---
Is that the one or three that got reimbursed because of 'mah overview'?
---
adapt to what mate?soon goons and the bots army gona be the only left in game...u need to recruit moarr babe.have a nice game

just delete local

Hello,
---
We have an entire active subreddit specifically for this question. Please head on over to /r/evejobs
---
It's all on me about that. Never found the time to organize that these days, RL isn't easy. I tried finding a schedule for that, pinged, then backed up because it was going to be too much work for me at the time, and did that multiple times like a scrub. Please, I hope you understand, have my honest excuses for your hopes. 
---
I dunno, the voting on my comments has been highly positive. People are sick and tired of the meta. And I haven't seen a single well formed argument that tore my comment to shreds.
---
But how are people supposed to rat without supercaps?
---
Add to the fact that most of the AT participants are content creators outside of the AT. For at least 5 years now CCP has been catering to the content consumers and are driving the content creators out of the game.
---
This is bad for a game that relies so heavily on content creation by the community.
---
That's why I just cancelled my 3 subs.
---
Ended my "reasons" section with "I may still fly with my corp on occasion in alpha form, but until I see a notable change in the game's direction, I will not be providing further funding to CCP"
---
If they change tack, my assets are there for me if I return... If they don't... Well, it's not like a super is something special these days, let alone my regular caps/subs...
---
It's not a bad thing, just the switch to 64-bit is likely quite a big project for CCP, that mainly benefits client stability in biggest fights that can happen. During both X47 battles last year EVE client running out of 32-bit memory address space and crashing due to lack of memory was a reason of many crashes (including few of my clients crashing). Getting 64-bit will mean that blob vs. blob slugfest will still be laggy and buggy experience, but this time at least without the game crashing in your face when you try to log back in for 17. time.
---
Me too :(
---
down with the proletariat up with friendship friday
---
unhealthy amount of spod and goony brainwash D:
---
I too play RS. 
---
absolutely friend!
---
in fact i'm currently trying to find a stargate related flair icon that pertains eve so all the stargate fans can use it. it recently came to my attention that i'm not the only massive stargate nerd here.
---
its very hard to type with no capitals but the pay off is worth it
---
i'm honestly surprised the man who pve'd in an at frig and died over the overview didn't petition a second time when his travelnag died with it
---
I mean yeah, if they do then I'm happy for them. For me it smacks a bit of "well you're just playing wrong if you think EVE is bad" but maybe I'm just retarded
---
Injectors are the worst thing to happen to Eve.  Not just because they fatally undermine one of Eve’s core mechanics, but because they dramatically amplify every single other problem that pops up.  Supercap profileration, Rorquals, botting, RMT, cloaks camping, etc. have all been made worse by injectors.
---
My point exactly 
---
I don't think Smith &amp; Wesson will introduce lootboxes any time soon so you'll be fine
---
It was like that before. You cant edit reddit posts (to my knowledge), only comments. I put it up preemptively because I know the #1 suggestion is to do it in a carrier
---
It was fun while it lasted. Literally the only QFC entity that was fun to fight. :(
---
They will never be removed.
---
It's okay I just got pretty sad last night watching your stream I had to turn it off. Had my hopes up for your tourney since AT was cancelled. Not only is the tourney not happening, but you were extracting all your SP and riding into the sunset. Enjoy yourself, and I hope to meme it up in your discord in the future.. o7 2 a top man.
---
Don't worry, as soon as they announce one cool thing we'll go back to talking about how great CCP is.
---
Someone should check if we're stuck in a predictable pattern of CCP hating -&gt; CCP Loving -&gt; Content Release -&gt; Repeat
---
J5a init area. I always see twitch and YouTube of people using solo dreads meanwhile we drop a cap or two and always get titans out the ass lol
---
Y'all are right! I knew I didn't need these articles in my life! GJ 
---
I took a 400+ day break from the game. Just returned to find that I cannot multibox anymore?
---
When I run my 3 clients at the same time, The focused client gets 300+ fps and the two side clients (on my other two monitors) go down to 20 fps.
---
Focused client gets all the love and the non focused ones go down into the gutter.
---
Now if I open up chrome, All 3 clients shoot up to 90 fps until I select a client, then the hiatus resumes.
---
Does anyone know how to fix this?
---
Things I have tried already, Interval One and immediate.
---
Made sure my Nvidia card was set to multi desktop performance mode.
---
Tried setting the exe priority to real time on all 3 clients.
---
What ever I do, the non focused clients get 20fps and the focused one gets all the love.
---
Y'all are right! I didn't know I needed these articles in my life! GJ
---
That seems like an obscenely stupid reason, if it is the truth. We killed one of their supers, let 'em stick around - it's not like they're any good at using them.
---
They have completely avoided fighting us lately, but they seem a positive group in Querious as a whole. It will just be another area of space that you can't go to for fights if this happens.
---
All CCP has to do is get Test to fight goons / panfam seriously again and they'll get another 10,000 supercap alts subbed for a few months. The faction forts were a brilliant catalyst. I wonder what it will be this year...
---
Thanks Ashy, very cool!
---
Have a talk with the boy ' DTM135 ', he's creating his own tournament and I gave him a bit of advices. Plus, he's gonna get more support and more people to back him up to manage all of that. 
---
Why? The jag and dramiel should have been able to stay out of range of us and just picked us off. But for whatever reason they came in close with the enyo  . If they had worked as a team with the hype they wouldnt have died. They hype could web, neut, and scram. We were in range of all of that. If they had picked us off with focused fire we all would have died, nit them.  Except maybe the enyo. That probably would have still died. 
---
No
---
[thinking the same thing](https://i.imgur.com/D9xh0vD.png)
---
I get that kinda, living in and using your space should allow you more in the way of upgrades but if people are hammering a colossal belt every 4/5/whatever hours then it should gradually deplete or suffer spawn attrition.
---
I imagine this won't be a popular opinion with the larger alliances, my own included, but unlimited resources in one place is just dumb.
---
Only if you’re running scams in Stormwind
---
u/DTM135

Inb4 World of Darkness reboot.
---
I'll laugh my ass off if they don't. That game would've been amazing.
---
Onion-san, this means a lot to us :3
---
Angel caps. Tiericide. Rebalances. Shield slaves. There's a pretty decent list of things CCP said would happen "in the future", for what it's worth.
---
My love of faction warfare

I've said it before, mostly as a joke, but at least this would put brawlers back in the meta.

In fairness Brutix navies dont have much cap..

In the next clip you're perma-running your mwd orbiting 1000m on an anchor that isn't actually moving. 
---
I’ve been an EVE CEO for years, but only just recently found out that EVE isn’t about complaining about the grand ideas you didn’t conquer—it’s about the friendships you make while building small things.
---
That's not the reason, but it's a better grrgons narrative then the truth I suppose.
---
Agreed and it hurts to think that they might never be removed.
---
just swallow , he'll like that 
---
Give us the real reason then tbh, only reliable sauce says its because they "had supers".
---
I mean, you’re tridot, so it’s needless to say you’re a bottom feeder in favour of relentless super cheese (except when you lose at it.)
---
Ok
---
I get it but I also think if they had to roam around then the would make enemies, they would get stretched out and their lazy/intermittent players would get left behind. You are rich but vulnerable while moving, you are poorer but safer when you stay put.
---
3,2,1........MODZI
---
This is at the heart of a lot of it really. Injectors were a license for the strong to get exponentially stronger. 
---
Injectors &gt; Rorquals &gt; Supers &gt; Supercapital Shields &gt; More Rorquals &gt; Sell ore / ships &gt; Buy injectors.

It was a positive feedback loop that was seen coming from 100 lightyears away.

And make CCP more money for doing absolutely nothing?  Don't they make enough money from our subs to not do anything?
---
To be fair to CCP they have the resources to invest in UX and even have some decent UX people. They just left it suffer with the programmer art when they were pushing it out initially and it has languished ever since.
---
Numerous XL wormholes that only connect between Nullsec systems could be interesting. 
---
Faction capitals with extreme jump range.

I like the new jump gates for subcap content, but subcap battles don't make international news. 
---
Figure out some way to drop caps in delve without a guranteed welp and we're golden. 
---
They never will. Even if they did, the damage has already been done.
---
Its symbolic of where EVE is headed which is a game of no risk and no reward by axeing the biggest pvp event of the year which has been going on every year for years tells us that they dont give a shit about pvp in general which is further understood when you look at the state of raoming 
---
My time. When I got a rewarding job and a family, Eve became impossible to play because of the time sink. I ended up playing solo in high sec, but PVE is boring and still too time consuming in Eve, so I quit.

My most disappointing win.

---
Thank you Mr. Godwin (Godwin's law).  You do realize this is just a game published by a company that is held accountable for its performance by owners/board?  
---
Yes,  I see your point.  And I did say I acknowledged the issues in the game.  It was just out of scope for what I thying to say. 
---
great idea! start with [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ar0oxj/its_time_for_shark_week_im_going_to_destroy_every/)
---
Meh i liked the mod strike better. When are we having that again? 
---
CCP made the reactions for t3 production require round numbers of inputs. They multiplied existing stockpiles by the same amount so people's jobs wouldn't fail and that overnight crashed the price. I think that chabge was 2013ish.
---
I do wish I had picked up playing EVE a lot sooner thin 2014.

Eh, protests in the streets aren't always a bad thing. It means people can complain and expect things to change, or at least blow off a bit of steam. Plus, sperg is a game in and of itself. And Reddit posts are just metagaming.

&gt;Now we've totally lost the first tier

\-Except in Wormhole Space, where every structure is a pinata. This is one of the reasons why people say "move to wormholes" and complain about asset safety: it doesn't exist in holes.

Yeah I remember helping kill one of those precision cruise nano ravens (and losing a bunch of intys!) and the fit being like 2B which probably just about paid for all the murdered tackle lol

Call me a revisionist (lol), but they shut down null entrances etc and had a big impact on logistics etc - Pre jump freighters (and widespread carrier hauling), I remember having the squeaky bum about my tower fuel supplies etc, just praying they would soon move on.

Plenty of people who dont say anything and just leave the game too.

BL is hostile, unless goons are on field. GOTG is hostile, but aren't goon pets so they might shoot goons. TAPI are goon pets. If it's just TAPi on field, BL might still remain hostile. NC. Is no longer hostile and should be treated as friendly. Any other neuts are to be treated as hostile, unless they are shooting goons, just remember to treat them as hostile again after the goons have left grid.

Except after certain point you are not vulnerable. If you look at last 3 well known cases of a group moving supercapitals got hit, it was: XIX, being quite small group, that got heavily outnumbered and outgunned (from what I've seen I'm guessing by at least a factor of 5) by everyone around; Tri moving their supers to lowsec and being hit by much larger force, and TEST having relatively small moveop hit by enough to be unable to react. If you'd look at groups like Goons, TEST, SkillU, NC., PL or even GotG - they have enough raw firepower to be able to deal with any suprise hit, and anything that could be threatening to them would be easily scoutable, given how long it takes to move supercaps across the map.
---
There would just be no stretching out or splitting forces, any reasonable group would in this case opt for keeping the blob together and doing swift moves - make a moveop to the location, set up, harvest all resources as fast as possible, move everything back (or to another location). And the moment any single group gets enough total power by doing that to be able to take even fight against all other groups combined, it's basiacally game over and nothing can stop them from taking virtually all resources for themselves.
---
they spawn randomly, you can just go to highsec really, nobody is running them anymore

Once I was doing L4 on my Rattle. He warped on site suspect. I called it on local, one guy flying a succubus told me he was hunting him, we fleeted and he came too. But I was mefiant, I suspected some trap.
---
So I didn't attacked the Orca, I bumped him while rats were attacking him. He warped 5% hull. 
---
Never saw him again. :)
---
This was announced more than a year ago. That very job listing has been up for about as long. Did we replace the entire population of /r/eve since the last time this was brought up? This seems to be news to literally everyone in this thread.

He's too tired to kick puppies after being kicked awake by his cats.

Looks like you are in denial eve is fucked.

i dont socialize with traitors, harassers, doxxers enablers and irl attack supporters u subhuman trash

I don't know much about it, but I'm rather certain that this is not the reason they have been kicked :-)

I'm making up for it ;)
---
*An alliance of &lt;1000 people would have no choice but to choose a super coalition to join...or die whithering in low sec.*
---
That's already the choice all nullsec alliances face today. You are either part of the blob or you do not own space.
---
If resources were scarcer then there is no way any single entity could be the size they are today and still survive because at the end of the day your super fleet can only be in one place, and you only own what you can reach in 1-2 jumps.
---
It's the typical greedy peice of shit ceo behavior. Get one cash cow and legit do everything in their power to fucking tank the company while cashing out as much as they can.

The decent replies on this post has certainly shown me that cool people play the game. 
---
Nice to see a positive attitude in those grim times for eve, keep it up buddy. The event might be shit, AT might be canceled but the core of EVE universe stays the same, its always been its Players :) 
---
People flock to what's easy. Fighting out numbered and out gunned, or just join goons and declare victory all over Reddit?
---
Not a hard choice for dumbs
---
You want CCP to pull pvper players aside and let them practice / play in an isolated environment that does not affect the regular eve universe?  This is the pvp that you are looking for?  preset arena bullshit?  The AT was always a BS exhibition.  It was interesting, but if that is what you want eve to be (arena / battle royale), then maybe you should try another game.  
---
Personally I would like to see rules against concern trolling personally, and possibly rules against attention seeking "I am biomassing and deleting my account" nerd-rage type posts. Like it or not this subreddit is the face of eve on the internet and we don't have a very good look.

They're supposed to widot into goons when they want to have supers.
---
About the only thing injectors have changed, in my experience, is looking at a character's employment history an noting their birthdate.
---
I'd be impressed by the chars older than mine, and be extra generous to the young ones.
---
I'm from 2009, and my chars are mostly from 2009~2010.  I haven't used any injectors, but I have used extractors to move SP around on an industry alt (who now gets a warning message everytime he tries to undock in an Ibis, because he lacks the small hybrid turret skill).
---
Now, I noted a few-day-old chars attacking my lowsec citadels in carriers.
---
It's something you see in industry (in the US anyway). Lots of stuff is measured in MLbs (1000 pounds) or whatever. M is the roman numeral for 1000. So MM is 1000 1000's, aka a million.
---

---
&gt;No i'd have proffered no asset safety

The CSM doesn't get to proffer anything.  It is not a negotiation.  It is CCP asking for a review of decisions CCP has already made.

The fact that you do not like this does not change it.
---
Anytime enjoy the isk!
---
There should have been a cooldown between the use of an injector of one week. Therefore you can only double your skill-speed and they are getting less effective the more skilled your capsuleer already is. This still would be the best thing to implement as some sort of a damage control.
---
On the flip side, even though EVE has been dying since 2003, I think we are truly in the latter half of its life cycle, and so if I can enjoy the content I want to enjoy that much sooner without time being a limiting factor anymore, then I'm all for it.
---
I own a tiny little corner of wormhole space and I seek to provide cap content for my low class corpmates that  would otherwise not get to enjoy such things, and this very expensive project has only been made possible via injectors.
---
This is accurate 👍
---
I think that is supposed to be \#metoo

&gt;If someone doesn't know who SU is, who control about a quarter of the Galaxy

TIL 223 / 3294 = 0.25
---
Addition: The ones with additional money / ISK could progress faster and have their fun and for all the others it would not hurt that much, because it's only twice the base speed.
---
seems to be doing it less today - i just had it again and i couldn't be bothered to relog and it sorted itself out after a few mins.
---
good idea, ship it

I’ve considered joining a big alliance too, but winning all the time isn’t always fun. But remember even Roman Empire was once on top and then it crumbled. When I played Albion online, I witnessed similar thing, now I don’t know to what degree I can compare it to Eve, but there was an elite alliance owning a huge part of the map with the best resources, dungeons etc. At some point there was a disagreement between a few of the guilds and some of the leaders, the whole structure fell apart, some guilds left the alliance, key leaders left, formed a new alliance with other guilds and turned against the few of the elite guilds left. So it’s all up to the players to decide the outcome out of everything. Honestly if people decided to overthrow the elites in Eve, that would be some great content and constant wars.
---
make this every week tbh
---
&gt;One mid is the difference between your dreads dying and moonwalking.
---
Only if the entire response has to mid.  And that's not the case in this situation.  There'd already be a response on the field from the local fleet, and the mid is for the supers that are going to finish off the attack.  Which is why this can only be a dreadbomb.
---
You bring titans and supers, and you're gonna have a bad day.
---
&gt;What's the point of dropping dreads on the response fleet when you know that the faxes will just come pouring through? If those faxes had to take a mid first...it's a different story.
---
Um....why would all the faxes have to take a mid?  There's the local carrier-based response fleet.  With faxes.
---
&gt;I think your analysis is seriously lacking a firm basis in reality.
---
Says the guy who thinks a capital umbrella doesn't include any faxes....
---
&gt; AT wasn’t what eve about.
---
It's about betting on AT, and behind-the-scenes deals to fix matches for dank rewards.
---
And the way to make it better is to scream like children about it, unleashing your id on the internet like some sort of slavering hyena?
---
Yeah bait is fine just don't do some "ccp did change i dont like this is bullshit remember 2014???"
---
Post *good* bait
---
Brilliant. I support this method of chaos.
---
Also support you toggling it on and off depending on whether you're on reddit.
---
Ok awesome
---
o7 capsular 
---
what
---
Then why haven't you deleted this post yet? :bigthonk:
---
A-hem... excuse me, brother, but are you most irate?
---
"once" lol try systematic instead if u wanna say truth
---
"once" was just the tip of the iceberg when u said in DM it would never happen again, and then your subordinates escalated into various other nasty things too
---
attacking a mans livelihood is so noble and wholesome isn't it
---
to think i was sitting there on voice comms protecting violet from shit griefers lmao how naive could a jebi be lel
---
Will there be enough players left at the point where it gets released for it to matter?
---
You should also go for the account after a the second or third offense.
---
And make it a month.

10/10
---
Not five words -- enjoy censure.
---
I applaud the effort and time that went into this passion project. As a web dev by trade I know how much time can go into even the simplest of things.
---
Hope you take this the right way though,
---
I clicked through a few articles and was really put off, almost all of them are low effort click-bait, but i guess no ads so thats weird. If they are just placeholders so you can make your layout pretty, I get it. But if you want to actually build a community or provide value, focus on (or finding people) who will take the time to write/edit some meaningful content. Without that this will just be a burden on your wallet for hosting this.
---
&gt; probably get replaced by SMA or something..
---
Purple upgrade?
---
For every gold you send me, I'll double it!
---
And also the fact that there is nothing that can be done to fix it, even if ccp removes them today they have already left a permanent mark on the game.
---
wow, on valentine's weekend too. how romantic. have fun :)
---
Down voted for karma mining
---
This is almost as toxic as jita local
---
Nobody cares
---
What bottlesize is best for tears? Do you keep yours cooled?
---
It’s a mason jar
---
&gt;One mid is insane amount of time when dealing with dreadbombs.
---
You appear to be picturing the entire response being a mid away.
---
There's a local fleet that's able to respond without a mid.  Their goal would be to hold the attackers until the supers arrive to finish them off.  Which is why I described a capital attack restricted to a dreadbomb.
---
(Also, I don't know our super numbers, but I suspect we'd be able to have several in the PS and Feyth fleets while still having a hammer in Eso)
---
&gt;Yet it's quite likely different standing fleets will end up using different comms just to keep things clear and understandable
---
Very doubtful.  You need a rapid realignment if the attack is serious (and your spies failed), and 90% of the time you're all just shooting the shit anyway.  So you'd want everyone in the same comms.
---
You'd only use separate comms if you're *frequently* dealing with simultaneous drops.  1) Out-of-the-blue simultaneous drops are almost never going to happen, and 2) you can structure your comms such that you can all chat together while still having a "local key" to handle your feared constant stream of simultaneous drops.
---
You're being awfully defensive. 
---
No, they suck, of course. 
---
No offense intended, but fuck off please. 
---
I thunk their strat is to get 25m players hooked and intorduce increasingly agressive monetization. Season pass coming in march..
---
Good points. I’d imagine there’s some amount of transition involved in having new corporate overlords in another country, even if they’re insisting that management will remain local.  Hard to unroll new directions until this gets clarified at least internally. 
---
My best guess is they’re exploring franchise options (smartphone games / apps, console spinoffs, universe spinoffs) and haven’t developed anything well enough to announce yet. 
---
Not that eve is dead, but what do you add after wormholes, citadels, and extensive capital ships. Currently developed sci-fi lore ends here. Maybe the community can provide some additional direction that would enhance marketability and revenue?
---
My personal suggestion would be to re-attempt a dive into VR. The eve universe seems perfect for this for a variety of reasons, and it could be implemented in a step-wise, affordable fashion (ie social stuff separate from station walking separate from piloting).  Pioneer a new industry with a tech-savvy, intelligent, dedicated player base. 
---
2cents,
---
DrDave
---
&gt;Personally I would like to see rules against concern trolling, and possibly rules against attention seeking
---
Arbitrary rules then? Got it.
---
_more_ than 5 words?
---
Just like how EVE will be after everyone unsubbed amirite? /s
---
Shiet, now that would generate loads of content.
---
I mostly understand sov mechanics, but recently FRAT (or maybe Skillu) built an astrahus in our territory and I think they only owned an iHub.
---
So why would an alliance just attack an iHub? Can you start building things in a station if you capture either the TCU OR the iHub? Can you build a station there without possessing either of those things? Why just go after an iHub?
---
That's the point of it. Its a play on buzzfeed, its meant to be clickbaity. There is banner ads on the right btw, they're all Eve themed though.
---
You can't use a Rorqual without a capital umbrella.
---
Well, you can, it's just really insanely risky to do so.
---
The community originally asked for:
---
* 1 minute industrial core cycle
---
* larger drone bay
---
* larger ore hold (ice was a real problem)
---
Somehow CCP read that as P.A.N.I.C. and excavators.
---
Sometimes you can't find anyone to fight in the game, so you fight them on reddit
---
QFC members are not prohibited from owning supers.  Therefore, your "proper, reliable source" is talking out of their ass.
---
TL;DR [you are here](https://i0.wp.com/www.kathyescobar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/denial-chalkboard.jpg)
---
The game literally takes place on the internet, so what else are you gonna do?
---
They know what they did wrong.  You will never hear them admit to it though.  But it is not "they have supers".
---
&gt; And I never argue with that, not even once. I merely said that you could do something against that, which you try to deny with stupid examples. 
---
Your idea of "something" that I could do is get my own 50k member alliance and hit it with dreads. Not really a solution for small gang groups.
---
&gt; and what do you think drives the population? Does it ring now? :D 
---
Correlation is not causation. Does it ring now? :D
---
&gt; All of them which can be killed and taken away, except local. Even the panic doesn't have a use if it's not backed up by a force helping out to kill the reason the rorq went into panic in the first place. 
---
Yes you can kill and take them away....if you have thousands of people in your alliance. Small gangs don't. The discussion is about the preservation of small gang in an ever increasingly safe nullsec.
---
&gt; Yes, exactly. Without all these things (which you could take away), the advantages are all in the hunters favor. 
---
Nonsense. Even without these I remember as far back as 2011 nullsec alliances actually forming counter fleets to hunt people. But another thing is this, you krabs always say "haha already replaced" when you lose something. So you don't even really lose anything right? I mean you just krab it all right back up. Anyway I digress. The point is krabs have had an increase in advantages that favor them without anything given to the small gang players.
---
&gt; but it was less fun in total across the game, as evident by the numbers on the MER. That is, if you think "destruction equals fun". 
---
No it wasn't. And the appeal of Eve is destroying stuff that is hard to replace. So you flying around with 30 mil Caracals that are insured and welping 300 of them isn't "fun." It's empty noise.
---
&gt; oh yes you are an extreme case of loss aversity. 50 bil on the wallet but still scared to expose a 100 mil isk in ships. That's 500x more isk than you are willing to comit. I for one have no problems putting my nyx at 30bil at risk when I only have 7 bil quid. See the difference? I don't even have enough isk to replace that loss. Granted, I have SRP which will likely replace some of that, but I don't need 500 times the ISK. 500 times you loss averse excuse for an actual eve player. 
---
Where am I afraid to expose 100 mil in ships? Where are you getting these figures from? Put your Nyx in Geminate and see how it goes.
---
&gt; It's a "if you don't have interest in provoking fights then you can't be all to interested in them". So, based on your actions, the problem isn't as drastic as you claim it is. And again, actions speak louder than words. 
---
As the other thread shows and people who have been playing the game a lot longer than you have, clearly it is a problem. Having to have a thousand man alliance to grind citadels isn't exactly small gang. Your suggestion to small gang groups that "well you too have the tools to do X Y and Z" always falls back to "just make a huge blob alliance and do what we do." The point is to preserve intelligent and meaningful small gang hit and run game play. Not to make everyone a low IQ F1 mashing retard krab alliance. So when you say "you have the tools"...well no we don't. Not without completely changing our play style and letting small gang go extinct. I'll give you an example. Prior to citadels we used to lock down the grid of a station with stop bubbles and dictors. The defenders would undock, chase us off and we'd have a back and forth fighting. Now you can't even do that anymore. Citadel insta blaps you with point defense, or tackles you to ungodly ranges. There's no counter play. And "just bring your own 50k alliance lol" is a dumb suggestion. It really shows your limited experience.
---
&gt; and that's exactly why you need MORE PVE'ers in Space and not LESS. Making space less safe will result in less targets in space. That's why your claim of removing local will fix everything is pointless and stupid. 
---
No we don't need more PVEers in space. We need more people period. If I'm in a krabbing ship and I'm watching local, how are you going to catch me? Tell me. Go ahead. Explain it to me.
---
&gt;You have all the tools you need at your disposal. You have the option to assemble 1000 titans and field them against them. You can also bring a couple dozen dreads and feed them in a controllable way without any option for the defender to prevent you killing his Keepstar this way. A couple of dreads are enough to pause the timer and if you can bring enough dreads then you will kill it no matter what the defender does.  
---
&gt;If you would have said "I can't afford that", which you can't or, at the very least, don't want, then that's a legit argument for another problem. It's just not a "I can't because the game doesn't give me the option" because the game clearly allows you to do just that.  
---
&gt;Whether you don't want to or can't afford the tools you need to successfully kill a keepstar this way is irrelevant for this discussion.
---
Once again your clueless idiotic suggestion for small gang "just bring your own 1000 titans" shows how unintelligent you are. The point is we want to preserve small gang pvp. Not become an F1 mashing blob like you. The game changes are limiting this game play style. And since you have ZERO experience with it and you are incapable and too untalented to do anything of the sort, you don't know what you're talking about.
---
&gt; I would say the game gave advantages to actual players that cherish the entirety of eve and not just some half assed players that focus on one thing and one thing alone. You may dislike PvE, others don't and yes, PvE has been pushed and it lead to more desctruction in Eve. Don't argue with me, argue with the numbers - if you can comprehend the MER's to begin with. 
---
I don't hate PVE. I hate Krabs. People who only pve and have limited experience regarding pvp. People like you who play this game as a farmsville simulator and then presume to tell me how pvp is balanced. Do I go tell you how much spod you need to mine to make railguns or whatever you do? MERs don't back your argument up. They simply show that highly populated areas have higher interactions. It's not "pve" that causes that. PVE can be had anywhere in Eve, not just Delve. It's simply the fact that you have a very high concentration in one place.
---
&gt; Giving the defender proper tools to defend themselves against an opressive force has led to good things for EvE. Yes, there are problems, but people doing PvE a lot more than they used to is not inherently a problem. It got slightly out of hand and I would argue for some targeted nerfs myself, but to devolve PvE back into the "eazy free kills" state we had before isn't a good option, according to the numbers (you failed to adress, again btw). 
---
There was never a "free eazy kills" in Eve. It was always hard and worked for. You're clueless.
---
&gt; I certainly don't need them all, I just dislike the idea of removing the one thing that allows you to survive nullsec on your own in the absence of your alliance's capital umbrella. Because you know, all the advantages an alliance grants can be stripped and taken away. 
---
Local is "the one thing" that allows you to survive? Here's a tip. Align to a citadel. Warp off. That's literally all you need to do. 2 clicks.
---
&gt; Local can't be removed like that. The same way I can't remove your inherit advantage of being the agressor which usually has superior numbers and which is prepared to do the job at hand, while I can't be prepared for PvE and PvP equally at the same time. Local is a balance to that and in the absence of local and the alliance, you would have an advantage that is almost impossible to overcome. 
---
You have the inherit advantage of numbers, the fact that you are in your home territory, the fact that you have all your resources in reach to fight. The attacker is at a disadvantage except for what he himself brings that is better: a plan. "in the absence of an alliance." Who is this mythical lone krab out in the depths of 0.0 all by himself without an alliance being kept alive by local? LOL is he with the unicorn and bigfoot?
---
&gt;And that's why I belive you are one of the self proclaimed elite PvP'ers which are caught to in their own little bubble and too dumb to realize that the game is way too complex for them to ever come up with a reasonable change this way. I realized thats true for myself too and that's why I don't go out in "public" and make demands.  
---
&gt;Instead, I focus on providing arguments, with varying degrees of success.
---
Must be the 5th or 6th time I've told you I don't proclaim myself as "elite pvper." And the fact that you have to continue lying shows to what "varying degree of success" your arguments go: none.
---
&gt; A PvE'er is at a disadvantage by default since forever and for aslong as PvE isn't 1:1 the same as PvP. As I said, there are numerous advantages that can be built by labor in the game, but none of them is inherited by deciding to opt in the PvE-Skilltree (that, you know, doesn't exist). 
---
Um dude you have "all the tools" to fight pvpers back. Just fly a PVP ship with a small gang man. You have all the tools right there.
---
&gt; Having the initiative and the option to chose the fights you take is an inherit advantage for the agressor. One the PvE'er minding his business in anoms does not have and will never ever have and in the interest of an enjoyable game for everyone, there needs to be a counter to this. Local is that. Remove it and provide something else is fine. Remove it without compensation is not. 
---
How about a module that provides local we can entosis. 15 minute cycle. Goes offline. Someone has to go to it to entosis it in order to work again. Fair?
---
&gt; If you have so many problems with the other advantages an alliance may or may not offer, burn the alliance down and fight against them. 
---
"If you think citadels, capitals, alliance only gates, toggle cynos from blob alliances limit your small gang...just make your own blob alliance and kill all that stuff....THEN you can small gang dude. haha simple"  
---
Fuck why didn't I think of that. Thanks man. Truly showing the best ideas here.
---
&gt; Don't get me wrong- I even agree that there are problems for all the small gang and lowsec inhabitants, but that's not a problem local produced and it's not a problem the removal of local could fix. 
---
It's not a problem "local produced." It's a problem all those other advantages that have been added in the game in recent years that it produced. And on top of that local is already a huge advantage for defenders.
---
this and the attempt to bring lootboxes into the game and the development of yet another unannounced game.
---
People are seeing how little CCP cares about EVE these days.
---
It's a very real possibility. I'm enjoying the game while it lasts, though. ;)
---
When someone enters my mission and starts looting wrecks, I send them ISK, because they obviously need it more than I do.
---
When did you last time CCPlease'd CCP dev about this.          
---
Let them make your dreams become reality. 
---
I think you may need to seek help bud. You literally claimed to be the 'master shitposter' while talking shit 24/7 and someone changed your nickname, they got chewed out, problem over.  You PM'd me about it for months. It literally was a non issue. You're just mad because I didn't boot half the mod team (which wasn't even an option for me to do btw) to suck your dick because you think you're a big shot streamer dude. Shitty thing is I considered a friend, too.
---
Lesson learned I guess.
---
Well you'll most likely still be stuck in potato mode for performance sake. It's just that the client won't crash on you due to running out of memory. 
---
&gt; Only a carebear would look at the wonder that is Krig Povelli's killboard and then try to work out the ISK/hr.
---
I wouldn't call a no concern trolling rule "arbitrary". Many smaller but successful subreddits expressly forbid concern trolling because it serves no purpose but to undermine and destroy, it's bad for the the game and the community.
---
Yes I'm aware of what denial means I just have no idea how my post about posting has anything to do with the state of Eve.
---
I suppose that's true, I usually do market and industry stuff so I think I'm just not as affected by most of the issues people post here.
---
Not have a histrionic fit? I know this is asking a lot.
---
I FEEL ATTACKED
---
Yeah, sorry. I just cannot get on the bandwagon with "CCP is KILLING EVE." Am I concerned they sold to Pearl Abyss? Yes. Am I concerned the server is going to shut down in the next 5 years and there will be no more good content? No. 
---
I certainly am not going to shit all over myself because CCP canceled AT last minute right after a significant staffing change. You know that thing that probably 97.8673% of the player base doesn't even know exists, or gives to shits about.   
---
Speaking of which, is CCP that's out of touch or a vocal portion of the people who post here? Like seriously just three weeks ago someone *legitimately* posted here about how CCP better get off their ass after this patch and add an Angel Titan to the game. You know, a ship that only 100 people who play this game could realistically afford to fly, or want to fly. 
---
Wait until you get a load of the 64-bit launcher!
---
Your proper reliable sauce is shit. 
---
Just like your alliance.  
---
do demod shelby though
---
&gt;a month
---
not perm?
---
Thanks, it's nice to hear that. Echo'ing what my co-founder, CiX, said though, it really is meant to be a parody of Buzzfeed. We came up with the original draft in about half a day and figured that we might as well continue. Honestly we had a lot of fun with the rest of the site though. Coming from a background in CZ and NER and trying to think about things in this low-effort way was hilarious.
---
When it comes to actually building a proper community, maybe a spiritual successor to CZ... Well, it's something I'd love to do. Right now the state of the game leaves me feeling apathetic and not wanting to pour so much effort into a 'proper' project.
---
BANNED FOR HARRASSMENT ON MY CHRISTIAN REDDIT

Would be awesome, but idk if you can ask that much out of them, sounds like a shit ton of work.
---
discord -- not even once
---
Lota salty goons here being vague and not giving "real" reasons for the kick.
---
Get back to botting or give us a real reason
---
shittest answer here, give us a straight one then :)
---
tbf we have a rule that literally says no low effort garbage posts
---
wrong
---
Thank you. This sub has been pure garbage all week. Repeat posts galore and every day a new “I’m new to eve, isn’t that cute?” Thread is made. 
---
To the people who are extracting and leaving...nothing of value is being lost. Let the cry babies leave. If Eve is too tough for them then fuck em.
---
i'm legit a dumpster tier nobody
---
it's not my fault u have selective memory
---
u keep telling urself that - the more u repeat it the more its truth lol
---
He's grasping onto the bare threads of agency he has left. He thinks that if there are enough contentless posts expressing a particular opinion, that said opinion will start to dye reality in its color. Without this, he will lose what little hope he didn't even know he had.
---
Waaaay more money, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more
---
You want to know the best bit.
---
We all warned people this would happen, But those of us warning were heavily downvoted, Or like in the case of me and someone else, Literally screamed at over discord voice and called retards by members of the CSM at the time.
---
But no... The game is perfectly healthy.
---
Increasingly salty bittervet here... I'd play that. 
---
“Many smaller subreddits”
---
And there you have it. It’s far easier to spot the troll in a smaller community.
---
Regardless r/eve has always had a more laissez faire approach to this kind of posting. Vote arrows are sufficient moderation as proven by the low effort/bad troll posts sitting in /new with 0 posts and the better constructed posts floating near the top.
---
If you want an overtly positive limelight I’m sure the EVE forums are cultivating nice green fields. To stem the flow of valid complaints would not be moderation but censorship.
---
No need to vote brigade when you can just sticky ;)
---
doomsdays have beautiful effects ヽ(^◇^*)/
---
Alliance scum, eh i mean whats an elwyn
---
&gt; appearently the guy was afk cloaked in the standing fleet
---
Ya, that's always a good idea.
---
The 64-bit client will allow more Rorquals by preventing client crashes and more stable botting, for those that choose that disgusting type of game play.
---
Eve was nice, but nothing lasts forever
---
Because safe-log on a blue citadel is too long?
---
Citadels can be dropped without owning ANY sov at all. Taking out the one that houses system upgrades denies the original owner of the sov all the advantages of owning that system as well as being very expensive to replace all the upgrades.
---
Is there any threads out there where you post your recruitment link and ppl sign up to eve through that link?
---
Several other games ive played before had that
---
Could you do this to /r/marvelstudios ?  That place needs a real cleanup.
---
Nothing of value was lost. Eyes forward.
---
Can you remove shitty flairs too while you're at it?
---
This post is on "I miss vanilla WoW" before LFR level. 
---
\&gt; also just literally look at any thread because they are mostly trash.  
---
Harsh. But fair.
---
+1
---
When you need to shiptoast so hard you make a website for it.
---
Didnt help goons had the most bots in their umbrella, not only could they bot ish which we used to farm but now they can bot skills.
---
I havent played in years, whats the issues with Rorquals?
---
See now that is a way better parting gift. You are giving back hope.  Ty sir
---
No, go away.
---
&gt; No offense intended, but fuck off please. 
---
Low-key wish I knew how to fit and flag modern Jags
---
What in the actual fuck.
---
Am I playing it wrong? I don't have a rorqual 
---
In general I think the approach is fine, it could just do with a bit of trimming. That said, you're the boss so do as you see fit.
---
The well constructed posts including the ones I disagree with are not the problem, it's the:
---
"Should I try eve?"
---
"No the game is dead, total shit game and CCP is turning it into a korean pay to win game." that I think are not helpful.
---
lmao great website!
---
Absolutely! Yday was pretty bad for crashes, this night I've only crashed maybe 2 times in 7hrs of gameplay. Then again, the first evning I played, we played for 8 hrs straight with 0 crashes in our squad. 
---
modbias, mostly
---
We’re trying to remove the “should I try eve” posts and redirect them. The “no stupid questions” thread is a better destination for most of those type of posts, and there’s a “should I play eve” guide on the wiki. 
---
Isn‘t mining the new EVE meta though?
---
There's no right or wrong.

---
Yeah dude I'm glad to hear you're having fun and being healthy. There's plenty of fun to be had chasing those small space dreams.
---
actually I fell asleep but whatever makes you feel better idiot 
---
If you mean the vast majority of custom ones, yes. Though I have no way to pull a list of people with custom flairs so it's a 'kill it when I see it' type thing.
---
This is because we had an self editable-flair for awhile and that basically backfired terribly.
---
hi goon leadership here. they were kicked because they insulted querns' ability to use data. also they said TNT were dorks.

wow smh that people over the course of 5 years quit playing a game with a terrible track record of a dev team I’m shocked

It would be very simple to fix it. You should not be able to skill inject certain skills.
---
Skill injectors are meant for new players to catch up. Not for alts to fly capitals on day one.
---
You must have just bought lots of plex. Spod bless you.
---
I can't tell if this a shit post or a bait post. 
---
You need a girlfriend
---
The mod strike ended in like a day because the sub got overrun with swastika's and KKK jokes
---
You will be able to render 3D ads for plex sales
---
i'm honestly not sure why people are saying eve is dying. i'm a station trader in jita, and i'm really hoping it's all just hyperbole because i don't want my customers going off to play another gosh darn diddly dang battle royale game. you guys are awesome, don't go anywhere!
---
Happily married for near 8 years bud.
---
wat
---
I wish reddit had a way to downvote bad posts and upvote good ones. For now all we have is nazi mods. Spod bless you.
---
I'm fairly sure the implied meaning was obvious, but. Would you like some fries with your salt?
---
Imagine it, its the summer of 2013, Odyssey patch just hit, you are roaming around FW lowsec with your mates, scoring kills, getting some cool solo/duo kills. fastforward a few months you have grown your corp and made an alliance, you deploy to NPC null, you're top doctrine is AHAC's you start harrassing nearby sov alliances for GF's and get some great skirmishes and even score a ratting carrier kill and have a small scale dread brawl over a medium control tower where you lose a triage and 2 dreads and they lose 6 dreads, the weather is warm and everyone is complaining about the blue donut. But things were good.

[I think this guy's trying to make a really shitty bait pasta](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azdacha)
---
if it's bait it's pretty shit so either way u/jibrish can we start shark week now
---
So's the majority of Null... 
---
What made us snap is that we've had a handful of exceptionally high effort OP's over the last week or two. Sadly several of them got largely drown out by low effort garbage. 
---
The damage is done but this doesn't mean they can't do something to fix it...
---
For example leave injectors only for toons with less than 5M SP, remove all SP gained through injectors to toons with more than 5M SP and turn them back to injectors.
---
This will cause an immediate drop of injectors price with a huge advantage to new alpha toons and new players, and will leave full SP only to toons who skilled only in the old way.
---
Right, but in Null you can at least purposely travel to locations with more or less activity based on preference, instead of hoping Bob will have mercy on you and send you some 2 week old exploration Heron to hunt and kill after rolling all day lol
---
Wormholes are great, but stacked with content they are certainly not
---
It'll probably be a halfassed attempt, literally break the game, and give CCP an excuse to kill it completely.
---
I disagree, there is something CCP can do
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ar0dzs/i\_really\_miss\_eve\_before\_injectors/egk5snm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ar0dzs/i_really_miss_eve_before_injectors/egk5snm)
---
CCP hasn't shown any logic in the last 5 years.  It would make sense if they do that.
---
Lul
---
&gt; remove all SP gained through injectors to toons with more than 5M SP and turn them back to injectors.
---
That would fuck up so many things. Imagine all the super pilots that were 100% injected that now can't fly they ships they're sitting in. Imagine all the vets who are sitting in ships they trained with injectors that suddenly can't fly them. If there's a way to fix this, that isn't it.
---
Your math is impressive. You are a credit to spodbrains. 
---
At least the quick maff meme used correct math. 
---
Well, if they'd stop pissing money away on half a dozen failed projects and then firing half of their people, maybe they wouldn't have a resource problem?
---
I just jumped in to a system with 7 sites.
---
"company doesn't make the changes that needs to be made and makes ones no one asked for to push MAUs instead of making the game better"
---
Am i talking about CCP or Blizzard?
---
Stellaris is a fabulous game, I have spent many weeks on a single game.  
---
They've got a spy who noticed Revenant pilot to be in standing fleet, knew/realized he went afk and managed to organize a drop to kill the ship. I'd say it's okay to brag about by the guy who set this up, it's well executed opportunity awox (especially if Frat can't find who did it).
---
y'all need to stop bitching about the loot boxes in this event.
---
it's literally the same as randomised npc loot tables - but this shit is just more convenient to sell on the market for isk.
---
you can ignore them and still play 
---
this would objectively screw over a huge percentage of the player base, and make them quit the game.
---
Good luck in the after eve life m8 o7
---
Whatever crank you're smoking, I need some.  Your brain seriously can't work like this and I can only hope you're trolling.
---
Devs are telling us that either next 10 years will be a challenge for CCP or new challanges will be released in 10 years  v0v
---
i'm really out of touch with everything going on since i'm stuck in carebear land. whats the issue with rorquals?
---
Alliance tournamnet 2019
---
I live right by there!😮 So excited to see this . Ill definitely be there. 
---
Awful idea that you put no thought into
---
To be fair, the launcher probably forgot their accounts. 
---
are you saying that for the next week, there's no point in looking to see if r/eve has new content?
---
If only they weren't so short staffed when it comes to certain areas of the company. What possibily could have caused this unforseable shortage in resources.
---
You think so?  That is your personal problem then.  No where in the QFC rules is it stated that they cannot own supers.  So again, your source doesn't know what they are talking about.
---

---
Wew it's starting to get silly lads
---
Sorry, but I don't leak.
---
Perhaps some more cinematic story telling and less tactical overlay but that’s just my taste 
---
That's hilariously similar to our corps history minus the almost dying part. We just stopped playing eve for a few years. But we never stopped being on comms, playing other games together, going on vacations together, etc.
---
Now that we're back, we're alot more light hearted about things, we don't have grand ambitions to conquer the galaxy anymore. We just play the game for what it is, enjoy what the game has to offer and enjoy our friendships and discussions, that's what eve is all about.
---
Lots of people are wearing their sandwich boards saying the end is near but they have been for the last 6 years. 
---
EVE is still EVE. Don't let them put you off.
---
10/10 would click again!
---
Abyssal mods were feared because of the potential for consistency (entire fleets using them, etc). The lack of that consistency has largely alleviated those fears. Solo/small gangs use lots of abyssal mods but the effects are much less damning there.
---
The system is largely okay - decent risk/reward on using the mutas, no major balance impact.
---
Inflation?
---
r/jailbait No longer works, and r/fishing doesn't have great bait, where's a good bait subreddit to steal content from?
---
that is incorrect actually man
---
How do you make a ship as unprobable as possible?
---
The game has a lot to offer and it just seems like a lot of bitter people are stuck in their ways and unwilling to even try new things.
---
Fair
---
Too bad most of the content creators have quit by now!
---
Maybe it’s just a stepping stop for a multithreaded eve in the future.  Now that would be sweet. 
---
I highly doubt that the 64 bit will cause much of a problem for multi boxing.  Yes it will use slightly more overhead of ram then normal as is the nature with 64 bit applications however unless your in a massive TiDi slug fest you probably won’t notice.  It would be interesting to see just how much a single client would use in TiDi and maybe we need to ensure that is part of the testing process
---
Lmao
---
K
---
Who hurted you friend?
---
As others have said, Biomassing doesn't actually delete your character. It just gets moved to the Doomheim corp, but all the data about it is saved (it just doesn't appear anywhere if you try to search for the character normally). So if you contact CCP, they can easily return the character to you.
---
&gt; No i'd have proffered no asset safety, in the end we...
---
&gt; *preferred
---
I'm literally looking at their rules right now lol.
---
This idea is bad, and I just wanted you to know that. Thank you for your time!
---
I like this site:
---
https://imgur.com/a/2l4gUHy
---
its ok my next shitpost will be about how my spreadsheet works now
---
I don't get it. I (and others) propose this solution and get down voted to oblivion a week ago, now CCP fucks up by cancelling the AT and now everybody celebrates this idea to put a cooldown on it.
---
Man, r/eve is weird. 
---
Having thought about it some more, you're right. The average player is not engaged in the wider eve community enough to know (or care) who the people running for CSM are, and there is very little that could be done to change that.
---
I still think the development process for EVE desperately needs to shift from the cathedral model to be more community-driven, but CSM is not answer to that. We should be voting for ideas, not people.
---
Other than that, let's allow devs to play the game on TQ again. "Make sure you play your own game" - I don't know where I heard it, I'm pretty sure it was a talk by John Romero. What has it been now? 12 years since the T20 scandal? No game developer has been allowed to join a nullsec alliance since then. I'm no game designer, but it must be a lot easier to stay in-touch with your target audience, when that target audience is *you*. The art team is still allowed to play the game normally and look at the incredible stuff they've been putting out. Play your own game, CCP. At this point, I think we can all put up with a little blueprint fraud, if that's what it takes to get shit fixed.
---
Maybe for you vets.. Me and my buddies recently got into it and having a blast honestly..
---
I still hope it's Vampires in Space.
---
this is bait, reported for being bad bait. 
---
I think the only salty one here is you.  Our internal decisions are not up for debate.  The decision was made, that is it.  You reeeeeeeing on  Reddit doesn't change a thing.
---
You're misunderstanding. A big trigger for fights was baiting out the response fleet and then dropping that. That's died off in the era of oppressive supercap and fax umbrellas. Yes there's a response fleet, but it's  much smaller.
---
There would be no issue with injectors if multiboxing was outlawed. I know there is not a hope in hell of CCP doing that in a million years however.
---
Garst is redeploying next month right? :-(
---
I will post low quality content on my Mongolian space ship painting forums and there's nothing you can do to stop me
---
That idea is a good way to have a lot of people quit the game in a very short amount of time
---
Fit as many SeBos with ECCM scripts as possible. You can also get implants to increase your sensor strength.
---
Also be in a wolf-rayet for reduced sig radius.
---
It's called SHOW ME THE MONEYYYYY. Tbf ccp need money to develop game.
---
U can play EvE 110% free and do all content. So there must be ways for them to make isk lol. 
---
Remindme 7 days, guess I'm not making any threads for a while 
---
Can't have those on Internet dude 
---
Extracted 124 Large skill extractors giving it away to old friends who still logs on to shipspin
---
RIP omeca and stainguy
---
I don't think that's necessarily true. I've done basically everything except high-class wormhole life and I still have pretty strong opinions about how CCP seems to be either incapable or unwilling to seriously consider balance problems across the board. It's been this way for years upon years, but they seem to be getting worse and worse every year about it.
---
Because we need a thousand threads saying the same thing. 
---
One other question, what kind of clear times should you be aiming for including the drifter battleship?
---
Thanks mate 
---
I liked it better when my ignorance of the facts left me angered and reaching for my pitchfork. Thanks for ruining it for me! 😠
---
Man, show me these TXG supers. I need to kick the pilots.
---
It took a lot of skill points and isk to fly them. Now it only takes a lot of isk to fly them, so isn't a problem to get hundreds of accounts trained up to fly them in a matter of days , and they can mine tons of ore for hours while afk, causing inflation.
---
Good footage, but the "music" makes me want to abort myself.
---
Gold for you
---
Don't tell me you agree with these entitled knuckle draggers.
---
Still you should be proud of what you have achieved: You have connected people together and made friends, even if it's in a spaceship videogame. Even if it's by virtual means, I still think it's part of actual life.
---
Addictions can be a bad thing of course. Everything in moderation.
---
Yeah, probably. I'm still just tilted off the face of the planet that CCP decided to kick me in the teeth one final time this year, so I took this post quite the wrong way. Sorry, /u/darkrisingmitch. You guys have fun.
---
&gt; Injectors are horrible and I want them removed.
---
&gt; EVE is dying because CCP is doing nothing to attract new people to the game.
---
These are the most common complaints I see on the subreddit but you really can't have both opinions at the same time. I understand that injectors feel really unfair, but at the same time it's near impossible to get into this game as a new player without them. EVE has a really high learning curve and even when a new player overcomes that they can't do a whole lot as they're blocked by months of skilling to get some basics.
---
Because the referral rewards for Eve are so good, and the playerbase tending to attract more predatory sorts, such posts are banned on this subreddit with good reasons. 
---
Ah ok thank you!
---
Step 1: fit a cloak
---
Boom, done. If you don't want to actually be cloaked, then do what the other guy suggests because sig radius and sensor strength are the main stats that affect combat probing. 
---
querious rat club
---
smh fucking longposting
---
Nobodys said anything nice about you're idea yet, and I can affirm that is an idea, and I've no doubt it's your own, so, keep it up champ
---
THANK YOU
---
How would they even do this? How would they determine what skills to take the SP from? It's likely that CCP only stores how much SP characters have, not where each individual skill point came from. I really doubt they have a way to even do what you're suggesting unless they manually review every single account in the game and make the change by hand.
---
&gt;Man, r/eve is weird.
---
Understatement of the century.
---
Then again, it can also be applied to the whole of reddit. Last week I was in a different sub (one for excel). There was a thread - two people posted the same thing and got upvoted. I posted saying "the upside of this more complex method is going to be lessened in the next release" to both people. I had two different people coming on and having a go at me and got downvoted because I posted about the update twice... in response to two almost identical comments (it basically boiled down to the same kind of "this way is better" BS that we get here too, and I I dared to say something contrary to it).
---
Whereas I am in the same boat, tried nearly everything in the game over the 12 years I've played. I think the game is in the best state it's ever been in and that the recent changes to sov, citadels, fatigue, stability, 64-bit client, etc are exactly what the game needs.
---
I have come to believe there are just two types of people, some who immediately see the negative in everything, and some who immediately see the positive.
---
Keep having fun buddy, don't let us bitter vets bring you down. There is loads of fun to be had
---
I'd suggest r/surprisespacemarine but a) it's pretty dead b) several posts from here are there already and c) I'm the only one who posts there. 
---
Playing Eve "properly" is a HUGE time sink. Most people deliberatly following this route KNOW beforehand it will mess up their RL. Still they choose to mess it up anyway. Esacpism is an extremely strong force if you don't feel all that happy about yourself to begin with.
---
When the fiction writers write your apology...
---
I had some of the best times I've had in EVE this past year, as part of my small alliance staking out our claim in null-sec. But that was largely in spite of a lot of the recent changes, not because of them. 
---
Spending hours upon hours cleaning up dead citadels, entosising uncontested nodes, having to constantly fend off things like swordfleets and other unengageable garbage - I experienced the absolute worse aegis sov and citadels had to offer FCing and leading during those months, and it essentially ruined my enjoyment of EVE from then on. 
---
Honestly, most of the reason you see all this complaining is from people like me who desperately want to enjoy EVE again, but see all these changes that *don't really effect big groups* but really put the damper on small ones. 
---
I'm curious what makes you think that eve is in a good place right now.
---
The real reason was the ceo of S.R was using a alt he placed in GSF to sell supers to his members which is 100% against gsf policy
---
&gt;the other 200-225 million is only if CCP hits a certain agreed upon bench march regarding revenu and player numbers by a certain date.
---
And this is why the game is getting fucked over at present, gotta pump that bottom line up by any means to get that fat sale bonus. they seem to have forgotten the player count part though.
---
You say CCP. But really it’s pearl abyss.
---
QFC is shit.
---
I went to every single alliance and tried to join because the Fight Club thing sounded tons of fun.
---
Instead, every single recruiter told me how QFC "was dead" and pretty much just discouraged me from joining.
---
Tin-foil hat here, but it feels like the QFC is a fucking front / scam. The only real use that Querious has is for Goons mining.
---
Not a bad place to start.
---
Come to the nor'east!
---
Post killmail, I'll reimburse
---
Injectors only speed up the skills, and the cheapest you can get for omega is \~180m give or take market flucs.  (without counting alphas.)
---
Before injectors existed, ebay characters existed just like all mmorpgs. day 1 characters with 50 million skill points. person A bought the character from person B on ebay/what have you and his/her 1st day of playing eve online. This is no different that injectors. insta skills instantly. 
---
The difference between buying a pre-made char and doing injectors to do that exact same thing is where the money went at the end of the transaction. 
---
Eve made it more accessible however by moving it in game instead of a outside website. you can now buy your ebay character directly from the market place. (skill injects)
---
however the issue still stands, you cannot remove it and supply and demand will dictate the price and supply of skill injectors just like the number of available characters being sold based on how profitable it is. people farmed characters for the characters them selves. now people just farm skills instead of the characters. same thing. 
---
you need a (2nd account pilot?) buy the char or skill inject, both are available even today. there are still isk selling websites and plex selling websites. 
---
the only way it "hurts" eve is if it hurts you feelings and you quit. then eve loses players and then the game feels dead because of empty space and less things to do. 
---
but its no different then a new player coming into eve online today. eve online will die without a influx of new players as old players are always leaving. 
---
to a new people everyone else before them that has been playing eve is already skill injected, either artificially or historically with time. what difference does it make to the new player? all that matters is the final skill imbalance, which already existed in the 1st place from day one before or after skill injectors. 
---
If some dude is willing to spend $28k on skill injectors whats to stop him spending 28k on everything eve related, ships, titans, characters etc etc. 
---
ps the game was always unfair to new players, even back in 2008. you can never catch up to people that started before you, this is eve online as it always was. 
---
(of course you can now with skill injectors, but how is that any different of there's always a bigger fast better out there always. someone is always going to be the highest of the high and there's nothing you can do about it, there will always be an older character than yours that has more skill points, they will beat you unless you are specifically trained for combat and match then 1:1 in skills in the specific ship and weapons and fitting)
---
unless you were the oldest eve character in existence and still active, you cant say shit. and if your mad that now your 1st place skill character was now bumped down to a lower ranking, the playing field is even, buy injectors. 
---

Bubble my wormhole
---
I know I need to hover them into dogfort lol
---
Ahh well that's fair. To be honest my corp has gotten to the point where we are kind of just enjoying eve for what it is and trying not to take it to seriously. We have a rule about not doing stuff we don't want to do. So for us, sov is someone else's problem though we might lead fleets in support of that if we think it will be fun.
---
For groups that are taking the game more seriously then us I can understand why certain things might be frustrating.
---
We even gave them suggestions like removing the 500mn from being mounted to hics, but mass entangler it was... We could have even fit that to another cruiser no problem. either way in the past. 
---
I kind of wish that CCP would sell this kind of stuff as wall posters.
---
I am quoting you to signify my agreement with you sentiment. 
---
Didn’t they do that in sisi at some point with titans?
---
remove wormholes pls
---
It's stable and smooth, the servers rarely crash and handle thousands of players. We get daily PVP content against horde and others. The meta with booshing/high speed/kiting fleets is actually pretty difficult but rewarding to get good at (as an FC and a line member). Fighting outnumbered and still coming out on top is a lot of fun.
---
We experience little to no pressure to try hard or be elite. We have tons of isk making opportunity and infrastructure to do so, and in general we have a ton of fun.
---
In addition, capital proliferation *in my opinion* is not a problem, it's a good thing, capitals are dying left right and center. They're being used constantly in all kinds of ridiculous situations and dying as a result. A couple years ago, capitals were rarely used because if you undocked them you were immediately hot dropped by PL or other roaming super blobs.
---
This is just a short, poorly thought out list, I might come back with an edit later.
---
People keep talking like it is either/or.  They can do both, and should, especially when taking the long view.
---
BUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLSHIIIIIIIIIIIIT ARGUMENT. Criticism of shit business practice is valid, criticism of them neglecting half finished features is valid, criticism of a stale meta in a game on maintenance mode is valid. Yeah, this reddit is WAAAAAAAAAAY too toxic over this, but they're working on the wrong aspects of the game compared to what they actually be working on, and are therefore wasting their own AND MY fucking time. 
---
I'm not unsubbing, because I personally am having a tremendous amount of fun, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that CCP is on a nice garden path of sunshine and rainbows. Their business and project management capacity is fucking embarrassing, and that is directly Hilmar's fault, but that's a whole other thing. I don't blame people one bit for leaving a game that has blatantly ignored flaws  that go for usually years without being addressed, people have a right to feel frustrated. 
---
Have a good fucking day, you can also fucking swear on the fucking internet
---
Your character looks like a dog that ate a bee lmao

while this is true i think its a small subset of users. reddit is only used by what... 15% of the internet (facebook is 2.3 billion with active accounts while reddit is 330 million).? with eve being niche this can be higher or lower. id suspect most eve players are tech savy and read reddit, but this might not be the case, let alone read the eve online subreddit. for example while I play many video games, I only visit a few specific subs for the games, let alone how many times.. forever or just one or twice? I'm kinda agreeing with the op, out of ALL the times I have canceled and reactivated my account... i think today eve online is the best ive seen it.

---
Does Corp history show doomheim? Is there an example of a capsule with this that you can share with us?
---
I have a feeling the AT being cancelled this year would be due to the MASSIVE FUCKING WORKLOAD of organising and running 5-6 mini fanfests around the world at once. The community devs (the few left) have enough on their plate.
---
  But they could have communicated this better. Not "HEY GUYS, NEWS ON THE AT! ALSO PLEX SALE"
---
  Mention why, and what they're working on as compensation in the same update. It could be great. Butt now everyone is frothing at the keyboard, and no amount of free SP or new shit will put that butthurt back I to the bag.
---
Na they didn't Whelp to Darwinism so they obviously suck. Look at all that green they are bad.
---
I see all the spergy hate and I do wonder if everyone else has missed the point. My level of play has always fluctuated, what I'm doing too, of course. This game unlike most is what you make it. You get out what you put in. Anyways, cool story bro, fur eels. :)
---
Ok thank you for your call!
---
Colonel O'Neil what the hell are you doing!?!

---
ok negavity nancy who cares. wanna see how hard it is to make a 64 bit client? using visual studio?
---
 Here are the steps:  
---
1. Go to **Build** menu  
---
2. Select **Configuration Manager**  
---
3. In the **Active** solution platform list, select the 64-bit platform for the solution to target.   
---
4. If you do not see the option, select **New**  
---
5. In the **New Solution Platform** dialog box, select the 64-bit platform for the solution to target.  
---
6. Now the build of the project will be optimized for 64-bit platforms. 
---
boom done. now compile and see how many compile errors they are and work through them. most code written properly can be ported to 64 bit in 1 day, let alone 1 hour for smaller programs. 
---
&gt; We experience little to no pressure to try hard or be elite.
---
You said yourself that your sov is someone else's problem. That's thanks to being pets to someone else. You don't need to be "tryhard" because there's no consequence when you lose. You don't have to concern yourself with fighting over objectives and then feel the hurt when you're not successful.
---
&gt;We have tons of isk making opportunity and infrastructure to do so, and in general we have a ton of fun.
---
Benefits of being on a null blob I guess. If your rorq gets tackled, just hit they cyno and you're golden. If, by some miracle, they manage to bring enough dudes into delve to actually break your tank (assuming you're fitted correctly), you just pop your 7-minute invuln button, and you're good.

&gt;capitals are dying left right and center. They're being used constantly in all kinds of ridiculous situations and dying as a result. A couple years ago, capitals were rarely used because if you undocked them you were immediately hot dropped by PL or other roaming super blobs.

That's true because of capital proliferation, but that also means that subcaps are pushed under the rug. Caps are so dominant right now that if your subcap fleet tries to face off against even a few capitals with proper support, you will only get wrecked. Against massive subcap fleets, it's not as big of a deal, but for small roaming gangs, it's awful.
---
It's good that capitals are dying, but when there's 10x more rabbits than last year, more of them will be roadkill.

&gt;No rorquals

As a rorqual pilot, I disagree with you
---
Was it because of my post titled 'reeee', that had nothing but 'reee'?
---
That was my best Karma post, it should probably be taxed.
---
ok retard

Posts here were always on low-effort spectrum wondering why this one mod starting to care all of a sudden. It's crazy the fact this mod in this very thread dig through someone's posting history to public shame him. And openly admitting modbias just shows you how immature/childish this mod's mentality really is. Hope some mod in higher position take action and remove this mentally unstable ticking timebomb asap before it starts to show signs of destructive behaviors in the future.
---
&gt;If your garbage post must stay because of a particularly good / interesting / important / very high traffic comment chain (and we were asleep) then it is your account that will pay the price.
---
Wait so if I post something low-effort, but it unexpectedly gets lots of attention (not under my control) I get banned from the subreddit or something? That seems really unfair. 
---
glad you are getting back into it
---
thanks and best of luck to you
---
I can't agree more,  honestly.  I too am happily married.  But around 2014 I was struggling personally with my job and life in general. 
---
EVE's best feature is one CCP didn't give to program - the people &amp; community.  We could be worst enemies in-game,  but IRL most of the people I've held experience with would bend over backwards and give you the shirt off their backs to help a fellow EVE player. 
---
The EVE community has been such a cornerstone of my life since 2014, and tbh I think I'd be dead now if it weren't for you guys. 
---
My wife doesn't play EVE,  but she lives to hear the stories I have to tell her,  and she is also grateful to still have her husband. 
---
Nuff said.  :-). o7
---
Sounds like you're new to eve. Because this is what people have complained about since I first tried eve in 2008. Remember boot.ini? Remember 'flying on planets reveal' in fanfest? Remember soul crushing lag? How about POS sov bashing 200 towers all day to claim one system? Or NO TUTORIAL?
---
  If the kids today tried eve back then they wouldn't have even lasted more than a few days.
---
  CCP not following up on promises and fucking shit up is just normal everyday eve.
---
what if you just sticky good threads for a few days 
---
Looks like an improvement to the current vigil. Outstanding work! You're one of the very few people who are capable of drawing something nice : )
---
Except for literally everyone who played before injectors was a new once, and we all dealt with it. Saying you cant play without injectors is frankly fucking stupid - it was like that for years, just shut up.
---
What if I told you that people are leaving because of the exact opposite, CCP making the game *easier*? Or is that just not a concept you're mentally capable of processing?
---
Shut your hole. No one cares what you think.
---
&gt; Dude just do small gang in wormholes if you're so upset about capitals I'm balance.
---
look for his name on zkill.
---
Yeah it was like that for years but you’re ignoring the fact that we’ve reached a point where most people in the game are skilled up. Years ago new players were fine because a majority of the games population wasn’t made up of people who’d been playing for 10 years and that’s it. The lack of a significant amount of new players for a long time changes the balance of skill-less people and the fully-skilled.
---
Lol then they should stop putting holes in that basket.
---
Nice to see a post on eve which isn't basically "screw CCP".
---
And playing around the polarization, perfect for controlling the engagement
---
I'm a corp director and I try to say bro each new member. Don't forget it's a game. Play the game. Have fun. Stop worrying about isk/hour. Enjoy it.
---
It's easy to get lost at EVE trying to optimize every aspect of it.
---
How can I defend against attack coming out of warp while transiting systems? I got utterly destroyed just trying to get back home from Jita. Didn't think they could even see me while still cloaked. For now I'll avoid the lowsec space, but I'd love to know what I could do better.
---
I'm in agreement with ya id say this is the best eve online by far. just wish it was back up at peak 60k players. but I mean 35k peak players is still pretty good. 
---
What do you mean by my "account will pay the price"?
---
honestly fuck this meme of a post, inb4 no real wormholer
---
I've lived in wormholes for almost 4 years, I've rolled every wormhole connection there is, scanned tens of thousands of signatures
---
The days of rolling holes for content are over, and anyone that tries to tell you "just roll idiot lmao" can fuck off
---
What exactly should they be rolling for? Is it: shitty drake/myrm drops in C2s that almost never happen because nobody runs them anymore? Is it capital escalations that almost never happen because they clear an entire stack of sites in under an hour? It is never catching MJD snakes that are in warp the second you pop the exit sig? Is it the Alpha heron pilot running relics that feels more like seal clubbing to kill than an actual fight? Or is it the once in (maybe) a week lucky roll where you get an actual groups home hole, you both form and then proceed to either get turbo dunked or spend 30 minutes staring at gaurdians holding reps before you both go home?
---
Fights do happen, I'm not an idiot, but the real thrust of your response is that there's content, just go find it! Laughable. What content exactly? Even if we do kill counting and say oh well look the raw stats show theres things happening (which isn't the case) the quality of that 'content' is absolute garbage, completely meaningless and unsatisfying
---
mining needs to be sped up. or mini game manually target asteroids with laser beams at the hot spots. also sped up..... 160 cycle time, fml. or follow elite dangerous style, blow up all the asteroids!
---
I have a theory that the EVE "dev team" in general is a rotating pool of interns.  Its the only thing that explains why the seem to learn absolutely nothing from anything they do, and constantly make and re-make the same mistakes.
---
I like EVE
---
sent you a pm
---
Eyes forward capsular
---
Why can't they appease everyone and still cash out simply by adding a hard cap to skill injectors?  Max it out when a toon reaches 10 or 20m SP.  You could still extract whenever you want, which would leave a skill deficit on your toon.  You could then decide to sell off the sp or reinject into different skills on the same char.
---
Pros:  Game is hard again and not p2w.  New players still have the choice to buy into some good base skills if they choose.  CCP still makes money.  Stops devaluing everyone's account time before skill injectors.
---
Cons:   Have to do some work to change the code.  Devalues SI and SE prices.
---
They can't ever change the introduction of Skill inj or what its done to the game.  But they can attempt to fix it moving forward.
---
I'll happily give you the PLEX required to transfer the characters over, toss me a PM and we'll work something out.
---
As long as you get someone to give you enough ISK to buy your first extractor off the market you're set. You can then do that extraction and sell the injector you get for enough to buy your next few extractors, extract twice, and repeat until you're all done paying for the extractors you need with the injectors you've generated.
---
You can buy extractors from other players. So the most efficient way would probably be to buy an extractor, use the isk from selling the filled injector to buy 2 more extractors rinse repeat until you have all the SP extracted. 
---
I'm not aware of if you can give away characters themselves, you might have to open a ticket to CCP since normally characters are sold and it might smack a bit of RMT to give the character away itself.
---
Ill send you some extractors if I can get one or two of them back full... Raul Korpi in game if interested. 
---
I would be for this as long as I got plex spent back, sp returned that was removed as open SP since some skills were trained over and over again.
---
Hi. Thanks for the reply. each extractor is 500K SP last I played. Is that still right? Happy to help someone who needs a couple! Can I log in and extract if I'm not plexed/subbed? 
---
I'm with you on this. I joined 2 months ago and it's been the best video game experience for me. I have tons of fun. I'm in a corp with an awesome group of guys and in an alliance with equally awesome people. I love coming home after a long day at work, hopping on comms and shooting the shit, and shooting shit, with these guys. I can understand the dislike of change, but for me, this game is completely new and I love it. Fly dangerously o7
---
Thanks, appreciate it!
---
Thanks for the advice! I was thinking that if I buy the extractors themselves, then sell the injectors, and repeat, a lot of SP would be wasted (instead of some needy fellow getting them). Maybe I misunderstand math though.
---
I forgot all about the character bazaar. Thanks for reminding me. Will look for some people who might genuinely want to play them there. Thanks!
---
I'll be there this time unless, real life happens again. o7 see you there
---
Will check how much ISK I have left on the account to see if this is feasible. As an RP'er, quitting or not, selling off my babies is not really an option to me. I named all my ships and stuff too x.x
---
Thanks! Having a blast in ESO right now. Happy energy everywhere. 
---
Were you the one who ran dark rising federation fw Corp a few years beck?
---
Or…  something yeah.  It needs to not be boring,  and more interactive.  That will throw the batters for a loop for at least a month or two as well.
