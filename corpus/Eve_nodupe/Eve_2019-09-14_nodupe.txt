Why not both? A blinged out pirate frigate shouldn't go beyond a few hundred million at the top end. (Just make sure when you can afford to keep making isk when it dies.)
---
---
---
Thats the one thing Im good at in this game. Losing shit, seldom gloriously but enough to cause laughter haha:)
---
And if someone wants do drop supers on your head while you try to do it just let them:)
---
I lived in wh for years once you rolled the entrances and watched for sigs your basicly 99% safe unless some one was logged out in the hole
---
It was already blowing up by the time that mail saw the light of day, it was just more fuel for the fire at the worst possible time.
---
&gt;Anything that achieves that should result in the entirety of the eve population rejoicing even if it is hard to accept said changes.
---

---
this is poor thinking, changing the game into something it isn't and alienating the core players at a temporary increase is bad
---
Ah okey. Im kinda hoping for a mail like that again but think CCP has better mail-control these days. Unfortunately.
---
This isn't a meme, theres many stories about betrayal, backstabbing and destruction about eve that draw people in. Ganking freighters doesn't write them. You're just desparately trying to justify it.
---
Worm holes have perfect intel with sigs... I lived in one for years as soon as you see a new dog you know somethings up
---
If they are using supers against those miners then you can drop supers on them.
---
If you can easily kill subcapitals with capitals then there is no reason to use subcapitals. And that is not fun for anyone. Capitals used to be mostly useful against other capitals. Back then if you went to kill miners in subcaps then enemy had to come chase you also with subcaps. A lot more fun for everyone.
---
Things need to be able to happen more quickly. No timer in Eve should be longer than 48 hours. 
---
The training wheels for sovereignty need to come off.
---
I don't think you'll ever see it because he's made it clear over the past few interviews, he doesn't give a fuck what anyone thinks at this point so there is no point telling the staff to ignore the players as he already told the players he is going to ignore them.
---
I made the money in a &lt;2mil imicus (well several, they pop easily), wh/null explo is nuts. I just figure if I'm gonna inject anyway why not buy plex and inject it to whatever makes sense (5M total?). Either way (sub/injector) I'm effectively paying for SP and I can blow myself up in pirate frigs sooner rather than later. The only problem with that then why bother waiting for training or grinding ISK when even $100 in plex will basically set me up until late/endgame.
---
Depends on the hole I could afk with my drake and ff missles just had to make sure to start fire again after reload
---
They are already alienating half of the games population to the adoration and cheers of the vocal minority. I don't see a path forward without massive change the way they are going.
---
Haha this is epic.
---
I actually agree with this 100%. Not a wormholer, by the way.
---
I miss propaganda posts,  those are always interesting
---
"I'm going to pay you $100 to fuck off"
---
you can beat this, but only in a few specific situations (I've learned the hard way) 1) if there's more than 3 neuts; get the fuck out; they neut at 80km, 2) if there are damps, get the fuck out, you can't target anything unless you're in melting range
---
I've beat it twice, but won't attempt it with any neuts or damps on field. Remember you don't have to kill the rats to get the loot and leave. But they will melt a Gila under 60km. Kiting is the only way to live in a Gila.
---
How are people this stupid? like its not hard to notice combat probes scanning you down
---
You know the instant there is a new sig unless your afk when I lived in a wh we just rolled a way out at the end of each day and stuck loot in the first station available contract move it with high collateral and if the hauler gets poped win win
---
Nice to see a new killboard coming together! One bug I noticed is that control clicking (opens in new tab) will open two tabs instead of one on chrome.
---
don't forget about positivity and acceptance here, no matter the grammar (✿◠‿◠)
---
I go through all the time without getting caught.
---
There is not late/endgame, it will all depend on what you want to achieve at a personal level. I've had my main account for almost ten years and it can't even sit on a capital.
---
That being said, I'd recommend you get into PVP flying T1 Frigs or Navy Faction ones, you are gonna die a lot and you want to be able to keep doing it over and over again.
---
Olmeca is literally the Greta Thunberg of EvE Online.
---
&gt; They are already alienating half of the games population to the adoration and cheers of the vocal minority. I don't see a path forward without massive change the way they are going.
---
wrong, local being removed is wholly popular in every forum posted outside of one particular group (the imperium)
---
ganking and scamming and backstabbing go hand in hand buddy, most scams and metagaming stems from ganking.
---
i've scammed/metagamed trillions on my own, almost all of it stemming from ganking.
---
do they take random explo loot scattered across 40 jumps?
---
There still needs to be an incentive to go to war, right now invading sov is aids, killing the hundreds of citadels is aids, so why would anyone spend time invading someone when they already have everything they need and when the game insentivises you to just stay in one place and defend.
---
Not a terrible idea. But there are many other fixes that I think should take priority that have been requested for years.
---
 It has nice shocks for all that extra body weight.
---
This is fantastic!
---
The game design for jump fatigue encouraged players to go afk or stop playing the game for extended periods of time. Trying to catch up with a move operation could effectively prevent you from using a jump drive or jump bridge for weeks. I’ve never seen another game design that so explicitly discouraged people from actually playing the game.
---
The idea was that “players can just take gates in their capitals and Supercapitals if their fatigue gets too high.” Without really considering that meant that only a handful of groups could really do that without dying horribly.
---
I had friends who got fatigue up to the high end of the scale trying to catch up or move that they literally went afk and never game back. Until we kicked them from Corp for inactivity, I could see that they were still sitting in their suitcase Carriers or Supercapitals, somewhere along the trail of tears from Delve to Fountain to Vale to Syndicate (my corporation had to move a lot from 2013-2016).
---
It takes maybe a week or two at most to train for frig pvp. No reason at all to put off doing some.
---
For players who make it past the first week or so the worst part of the game is the first couple of months where you're in that gap of knowing you're an Eve player, knowing what you want to do next but having long skill training to get there. Once you have a good base of skills, the longer skill training is much easier.
---
The best thing skill injectors have done is give new players a way to get over that hump quickly. I have mixed feelings about the fact that it involves spending real money to get past a bad part of the game but that's the game as it exists today. If you can afford to do it and you already feel like you're invested in the game I think it's worthwhile.
---
The problem with the T3 rebalancing is that the Loki's natural habitat is fucking everywhere.
---
When playing your way is avoiding content (blue all the things!) then complaining about lack of content that game it dead ( endless compliaining) the only person you played was yaself.
---
Even I, someone who passionately loves the ever living shit out of Vanilla Wow, agrees with you fully.
---
There are, in fact, several types of rooms like this (3, I believe). The difference is the special reward you get from the cache - (usual stuff + a “lore” item that subscribes you to spooky triglav emails) and your spawn point. Yes, you can spawn far away from leshaks, closer to the gate. However, you can also spawn right inside the blob (4-5 km from each battleship). If you find yourself in that situation the wrong move would be to try and escape. If you burn for the gate, the ships will have perfect tracking and damage. So do your best to kill everything, starting with starving leshaks. If you keep transversal above 0, you should survive.
---
If you spawn far, it’s risky to burn at the blob because of how much damage they put out. It’s like a game of chicken. I’ve never cleared a room like that.. I’m sure if you can get under their guns fast enough you’ll be fine.
---
You can assemble something like that fairly easily using Google Sheets and the Evepraisal Tools add-on.
---
I think you have this backwards. 
---
Per [this](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/207605005-Skill-Extractors-and-Skill-Injectors) Alpha clones can only extract Omega skillpoints.
---
People are too used to local and near2 pings for intel. 
---
Killing DED runners relies a lot on the target being stupid. He could have warped to a cit/safe or cloaked somewhere as soon as he saw the strat or loki on D, or his damn overview lol.
---
A sig doesn't indicate a threat, but a potential threat. Let's say that it is a problem. How do you change it? Delay the spawn on the far side? How do I counter play that? With the blackout I can gatecamp, form defense fleets, rat in groups. How do you have counter play with a delayed sig spawn?
---
I think there are tons of things I would change to make things more risky. Astra farming drifters is dumb. Crit holes should close within 2-5 minutes and respawn. I think C6 holes should have a higher total mass. No reason it's the same total mass as c5s. The lack of sigs spawning in you don't jump through it needs to go.
---
is not that two stabbers have sex with typhoon  then loki is breeding?
---
I love his art.
---
If we had more guys like him here :(
---
My prediction is, Olmeca and Grety will build an Alliance to save the world !
---
You can still use VNIs, they're just not as efficient as they were.
---
looking good so far!
---
If you want to run C2s maybe
---
I killed a Cerberus the other week doing a ded in 0.4, I literally warped on him in it then warped out when I got targeted by the npcs, waited 5 minutes and warped back to wait in the gate, the dude literally warped back to the ded gate I was camping on and there goes his 900m cerb, people seem too lax running these sites, I wish there was blackout in lowsec as well
---
Can confirm. Those are legit texts. I've taught two of those courses.
---
Math Prof btw
---
still having a wank i see, have fun with that
---
Ccp rise already said they think skill injectors are fine.
---
There used to be, but CCP as a company can't even manage to pay its employees to run a 1/year tournament, so it's no longer a thing.
---
In EVE, ships are expendable. Generally end-all that is where most player's isk goes- buying ships and mods to fight with then blow up, and do it again. The total Net Worth isn't really how much isk you have, and take its value with a grain of salt. It can't value blueprint copies, abyssal mods, and several other things
---
If you find yourself needing friends to go blow up stuff with or get blown up with, check out the in-game cat channel "SF Spectre Fleet". They run public (anyone can join) fleets that you can join in on.

I dug up my login credentials from 5 years ago so I can comment and tell you: this is the clearest and most concise summary of the EVE community I have ever read.
---
You can eat pizza without pineapple as well but whats the point?
---
Actually, if played actively VNIs are much better now than before when it comes to ratting. Just shittier afk ships.
---
Thats true.
---
Why's you leave of it was so awesome?
---
I write To: jita 4-4 in the dirt on trailer doors during the winter.
---
buy an injector or two. then 100 frigs and learn to pvp
---
I mean it kinda all depends on what you do.  Heck back when my corpmate would tow my alts around in incursions I'd usually make a few bil a night while sleeping, which was awesome of him by the way.
---
wow fucking rude
---
You're not wrong.
---
Youre not wrong. But back then you didnt have a fleet of stuka bombers shredding through everything. Not even regular caps survive against them and getting a fleet big enough to counter them is impossible in the time it takes them to kill a Rorq. And even then the Rorqs usually die. Plus some caps. The defence is always losing more than the offense.
---
Weve had this discussion before and thats why I said you cant balance small scale with big scale. I understood your point of wanting to fight in NS due to mechanics but I hope you see my concern. If you make something easier for you then it becomes much easier for the bigger groups. And in the end blocs try to defend themselves against bloc level aggression.
---
I dont know of a middle ground.
---
lol
---
How hisec isn’t viable ?
---
I mean CCP would say that since they're making money off them...
---
For dogs!
---
It's an undercover cop just trying to attract the bad element to up that arrest quota.
---
Yes because having no local, no super umbrellas, no asset safety, jump drives and easy logistics makes w-space so much safer than null. 
---
I could wake up tomorrow to my wormhole being sieged with no hope of evacuating any of my assets. I cant just pay a 20% fee for all my stuff to appear in some lowsec station.
---
While you can roll off all your wormholes, that wont protect you from log off traps and roll ins. I will concede that MJD snakes can be pretty safe, id like to see more scrams in wormhole sites. 
---
Pretending w-space is some bastion of safe krabbing compared to null is a dumb myth. In the last month at least 5 larger wormhole groups have been evicted, collectively losing hundreds of billions of isk worth of assets.
---
RvB might run a player-run version if they still exist. There's no true instanced PvP in Eve except sort of the abyssal gauntlet, but don't go there, it's bad.
---
Sounds like you are doing it right. Focus on a ship and skill it well. Also do those nav skills! Everything benefits. 
---
Keep it up new bro
---
Ah great. That shit can be a real headache in the beginning. Another thing that honestly needs to go.
---
Thats unfortunately the biggest downside of LS. Its meant to be this place where people can grow but Ive seen people in frigs with 10b pods. I mean, you really cant wint against that unless that pilot does something really stupid. Or is just plain unlucky. And they have perfect skills to boot with lots of experience which makes it a loss almost every fight. And if you ever stand an actual chance they will most likely not even take the fight.
---
So ye LS needs a lot of work quite frankly, most of the game honestly does. Too many neglected parts and nothing is really optimal. But people are talking about LS changes more and more and it might come soon so stick around for a while and see how it turns out.
---
And if you need help just hit me up ingame and Ill assist in any way I can.
---
That’s 10 billion my dude
---
Look on the receipt image. It says -2b isk then (I assume) the balance of 832,773,460,590
---
I wish there was.
---
&gt;I'm just mad and ranting about how my playstyle was killed in 2015
---
There's a lot of that going around, sadly.  Too many playstyles getting killed off at the moment.
---
I used to be strongly opposed to this because it doesn’t initially sound like part of the sandbox. I was also concerned because I thought it might prove too successful and pull too many players away from other parts of the sandbox. 
---
Then I thought more about it and decided that it would add value to Eve so long as:
---
1. Everything used in it comes from somewhere else in the Eve universe; and
---
2. It still follows the same rules of Eve destruction.
---
Eve is big enough that there is room for many, many play styles. Not everyone wants to play Eve the exact same way. There is no right way to play Eve. So, if it generates a way for even a couple of thousand new players to participate in Eve and blow up space ships, then an arena would be good for Eve.
---
&gt;you know CCP next ~~fix~~ lazy game change, just say it quietly.
---
Ohhhh yeah that’s not a whole lot given how big test is lol
---
Asking to be ganked.
---
What the fuck is this sorcery?
---
So with the new mechanics ccp have introduced and are continuing to introduce you are happy ? If CCP found a way to incentivise smaller groups over large coalitions you would be all for it? Keen to know as I swear I’ve seen you posting about how you dislike the current changes - but not that 100% sure
---
A lot more than I've ever had haha
---
Just a heads up but just ignore jita local lol. You can sell your stuff there on the market just dont bother with local
---
Haha... fuck.
---
Nice Post.
---
I believe the term you are looking for is negligence.  
---
Example: Goons have been a major power block since the great war. CCP makes a huge change to null sec. PCU drops nearly 50% after said changes. Reddit blames goons for drop in numbers.
---
We've done the same shit for nearly a decade. Servers have gone up and down regardless. Yet every major change CCP makes effects those numbers and somehow people are dumb enough to reee at goons. So excuse me for being condescending at those negligent individuals who I like to pick on (in this case  [u/Hustlan\_Jones](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hustlan_Jones/) ).  
---
These people have a misconception with being good at the game as "ruining" the game.  
---
Oh and that isn't including the efforts we put into the CSM, of which we have some pretty intelligent minds that work tirelessly to keep CCP from doing dumb shit like chaos.
---
There's a game called Fractured Space on Steam that was awesome, initially.  Then they made changes, and it became pay to win.  Now it's not good.  But it's 5v5, has DPS, Logi, objective capturing, and matches lasted between 10-20 minutes.  Doesn't answer your question, but you can check it out if you're interested and if you and a few of your buddies want to give it a go.
---
Would be cool if we could actually get a battleclinic ranking system based purely off points.
---
They dumped the alliance tournament and spectacularly failed to support the player run tournaments like promised when they canceled the alliance tournament, at this point you have to make do with 3v3 abyssals IF you can find a time when enough people are online to trigger the PVP gate.
---
Fleet abyssal sites are the closest thing to that (5v5?), but you have to take the pvp gate at the last site.
---
It's not like it would matter, clearly your case of brain rot has reach exponential levels already.
---
Absolutely spot on
---
i don't mind saving miners but i do mind when they are ungrateful for the efforts.
---
Uh.
---
No.  
---
I hate both.
---
I'm aware, it's just like the GE in osrs, big trade hub attracts scams and spam

---
just roll with the pillows imo
---
You don't need to turn up the rewards if you do not first crank the risk to an insane proportion.  I find it funny they felt there wasn't enough risk and then after adding risk decided there wasn't enough reward... its almost like the system was pretty well balanced when it came to risk v reward they were just to stupid to realize the payout amount didn't need to be changed, just the frequency of those payouts.

I love it when a moron cheers on CCP as they drive the EVE clown car right off the cliff. Can;t wait to read all the "Why did you kill muh game CCP threads that will pop up as the l33t pvpers continue to find fewer and fewer targets until in the end they are forced to arrange fights for something to do because everyone else left.
---
Abyssals PvP looks rather dead too. Low activity there, so there's no enough pilots for PvP gate to open.
---
Speaking of him why isn’t he getting in on this?
---
Good catch bro. I remember seeing newbros fitting polarized pulses on coercers for burn jita but then fitting them with DCU's and not knowing what's wrong with that
---
sometimes i'll pyfa a fit i'm flying to the next level of efficiency and suddenly i am uncomfortable in my suboptimal ship which warps 4% slower, has 13 seconds less cap life and costs 5m more isk
---

It already warns you when you fit Polarized weapons. How much extra, extra warning do you need? =)
---
Ok, if it's so easy to protect, do you still have a base in an space?
---
Why would you fit tank on a suicide tanking ship anyway
---
look at the reprocess numbers, plug them into eveprasial
---
lmfao what
---
Dude and that's after he bout nearly 500 injectors and multiple supers and Titans
---
Im the Strat pilot. He was pretty stupid. He was in the second room 70km off the warp in, so he had more than ample time to warp off as my strat only does 2880 heated and i had to burn for 20-30 seconds to get tackle on him lol
---
This is Reddit. What else is it supposed to be?
---
Wands are dumb. Lengthy timers are awful. Every ship class should have a meaningful role in unrestricted space.
---
&gt;After the fact implies the player put all his eggs in one basket (or all his supers in one citadel).
---
But does it though? 
---
I am very sceptical of your claim. I think you need to justify it before I'll accept it. I can distribute my assets among numerous structures (including NPC stations) and *still* petition for asset recovery.
---
When I played EVE back then my daily max was 250m lol and that was playing +12hrs a day
---
You are correct, but I purposefully kept it with "simplified" links to make it less of a barrier to set up for complete noobs, since then you don't have to worry as much about rerouting, overflowing, or upgrading links.
---
Your way is more efficient, but also more complex. Welcome to EVE, where the name of the game is trade-offs :)
---
Well, it depends how far you go with it. I think everyone enjoys coming up with an optimized fit for their favorite ship, or a good skill plan to fly it well, or even coming up with a market or industry setup that will make them some more isk or help them produce stuff to use or sell.
---
The problem for me starts when things have already been min-maxed to death by others already. At that point it sucks all creativity and variety out of the game, because everyone will be using something specific and if you want to be competitive you'll often get sucked into doing the exact same thing.
---
A prime example of this is alliance doctrine fleets where everyone flies the exact same ship and fit. It feels like there's an FC and a few scouts who are the roles that matter and everyone else is their alts, just played by other players to anchor up the ships and press F1 every now and then.
---
Honestly, i miss the time of kitchen sink fleets where the doctrines were more like generalized guidelines instead of specific fits. Leadership would say something like "bring sniping battleships with at least 100km range and buffer tank" and then every pilot would bring what they already had the skills to fly, instead of training into and using the exact same thing. Also, people were responsible for flying their own ship (aligning, warping out when primary and so on) instead of anchoring up all the time. It was more involved, more personal and more engaging.
---
I hope these scumbags get caught. That's absolutely disgusting.
---
I will spend £5 on whatever the fuck I want tyvm
---
I mean only if CCP would do it in the game..  Loot boxes are already a thing in eve.
---
Yeah I don't see what their logic is like what's the profit for them? Must be some next level sick fuck.

eves ambient music is some of my favourite music to play during any sci-fi game :)
---
if you like rock as well eve actually has some really good rock music that is played during missioning. you can find them on youtube! a lot of people i know didnt even know that eve had combat music :)
---
It's completely dead. Mainly 'cause not a lot of people want to risk their 1b+ blingmobile that's also *their current prime income source* on a randomass pvp duel against a guy who might be rolling a much better pvp fit; also, it turns out "instanced pvp" doesn't work great for eve, and it's possible to fit a crusier with so much passive regen another cruiser can't ever break it. Oops. 
---
Personally I'd have a lot of fun with a PvE/PvP combo setup if you could do it in like t1 cruisers. It'd be like facwar plexes except guaranteed no cloaky alt &amp; the other guy can't bitch out and run when you show up in local because you have a decent killboard.
---
This is the second time this bullshit has happened. Word on the street is a couple of rust discords got his today as well.

I wiah you could say the same for people with 3+ supers

&gt;like what's the profit for them?

it's trolling

As others have said, obviously you wouldnt mind no local or asset safety in null if w-space is so safe without either?
---
Brb, currently rolling a small army of alpha accounts just so i can upvote daily until i get tendon damage from smashing that left click. Thanks for the idea.

lots of reasons

1) gate guns

2) faction police while bouncing

3) other people shooting you during the gank
---
Gold Lincoln...  Seems like something that an Amarr would drive.  (I've driven my uncle's Town Car before.  I'm almost positive that thing is armor tanked.)
---
Stuka bombers are the metagame answer to capital proliferation. They don't work against subcapitals as well. They are not really born out of small scale metagame. Nobody really used torpedo bombers in small scale pvp and they work only in huge numbers. 
---
CCP can easily nerf them with few small changes. I'm not too worried about them in the long run.
---
its darklight, he makes sure to put out his opinion on everything, especially things he has no clue about. His comments are like a microcosm of what a standing fleet hero thinks, kinda like dave stark

Yes they are.. always felt like driving a sofa down the road..
---
Oh oh.  What colour was it?
---
1. I could have a cloak and a cyno before the change. 
---
2. I hate to say it, but I really think its what we need right now. They are purging the game world of inflation.
---
3. Many other ways of making isk, and if you're doing it in null and with friends, it sounds like the scouting isnt up to the par that it needs to be for the space youre PVEing in. Unless this is the most fun way that you enjoy to generate isk, than this sucks for you and I can respect that.
---
4. LOL. Fair enough.
---
5. I could hotdrop before the patch.
---
6. We just have to have faith man and need to ride it out. Deep down, I bet you know it's needed too, it's going to make our game better over time.

Ooo cloaky ninja's.. that must be lowswc

been distracted the past few weeks and slowly getting irl issues worked out, unable to play eve at all and had to let my sub be suspended for a while, but when path of exile started it's new league i ended up chatting with a guy about all sorts of eve-related topics and pushed me to get back in the pilot's seat.

I’m thinking of coming back after a few years away, and feeling a bit overwhelmed, are there any good resources to check out regarding the changes in the intervening years? I’m also going to need to find a corporation to basically relearn the game. I’ve got a 90 mil sp combat pilot, a 40 mil sp scout/hauler, and a 32 mil sp tengu/falcon pilot.

Shame. Been enjoying the  aspect of no local for PvP, but really has become more tedious than fun. It is bad enough while I am docked, I still push V for Dscan. Also fun fact, killed many of the smaller/mid sized corps. Mine included
---
Well.  It is a stock black truck and I have been known to frequent that area.
---
You still haven't refuted my points. You just keep trying to confuse the issue.
---
The fact is Null sites are about on the level of C2 wormhole sites, and they pay out accordingly. If they amp the difficulty of null sites up to C5/C6 levels with the equivalent Avenger spawns if using capitals, then there is no issue with adjusting the rewards accordingly. 
---
Try ratting a combat anom that has a 65k Alpha strike, almost 6k DPS per wave, and has more neuting pressure than an all V Neutgeddon with a full rack of  T2 Neuts and tell me it's the same challenge difficulty as spinning Havens. There's a reason they don't pay out the same.
---
It isn't more complex, it just routes to the item next to it and enables you to make a long chain that just have to touch each other. The other way (if you want to be efficient) means squishing them together and the game doesn't snap them to grid or to each other (at least last I did PI).
---
In any case, it saves link resources and removes the headache of placement. Start at the end, route to the final destination, as I don't think you have to make it stop at each node.
---
Sorry, don't really mean to argue, just trying to save people trouble I thought I had to do early on and found to be incorrect in practice.
---
Only for Force Recons and Blops.
---
i lived there last year when they were still there, they did drop people quite a bit, but compared to how it is in nullsec it didn't even come *close*, it's also kinda easy to smell it coming if you're in a fleet and bail. They're really not stopping bs brawls from happening, that's what i'm getting at.
---
Turns out local - or rather knowing the risks you're facing - was actually pretty important. Who knew?
---
Can't wait for The daily #MemeCSM flyby to dispute the obvious
---
At this point, fuck it. Let's roll back to trying to memorize that girls number you met at the skatepark for 5 hours because this shit ain't worth it.
---
yeah because CCP should save you from your moronic self
---
honestly i just couldn't find any good instrumentals that were able to keep the feeling of constant pressure as those. Metal tracks tend to have a lot of ups and downs and variation(there's prob formal ways to say that but meh), those variations would have to match somewhat with the footage and yeah no fuck that
---
also leavy my zunpets alone kthx
---
&gt;(I love the game enough where I'd rather play it 'badly' than not at all)
---
Most people here just hate the game so much that they'd rather not play than play without it catering to making their SovNull playstyle as easy and rewarding as possible.
---
Well yeah, it's not nullsec like Detroit.
---
Ouch.. I was born and raised in Detroit..
---
So I live in Okinawa and have an EVE sticker just like that on my Hilux. Some dude rolled up to me in traffic and was like "I love your eve sticker!" and I just yelled my corp name at him and he joined my pub. We hang out now sometimes and have done some roams together, it was a pretty cool circumstance.
---
What i mean is that if you petition after the fact, a GM will probably deny it because most of the times they decide against duplicating items.
---
For example, if i lose a ship because of a game bug, i can petition to have it replaced and if they find evidence to support buggy behaviour they'll give it back to me.
---
But if another bug causes me to eject, my ship is stolen by another pilot nearby and i petition it, even if they find evidence of the bug they will probably deny my replacement petition because my ship is still part of the game world. Another player has it. So if they were to give me a replacement ship, they would break the "no duplication" policy.
---
Tbh, if we really have to keep asset safety for cases of real life absence or emergency, then it should only be a manual thing (select items -&gt;move to asset safety -&gt; "are you sure?" warning window -&gt; click ok) with a long timer before you can get them out. The current situation where i can just teleport stuff around for a small % of their value and also never lose anything from citadels dying during wartime is absurd.
---
Maybe if we tell the nullsec people that hunters use it to teleport their loot, they will ask for it to be nerfed themselves, lol.
---
Kill some ships, approach citadel of people you just killed, open the "dropbox", drop loot inside, asset safety it away., profit.
---
Cant really say that. Metas change all the time and it doesnt have to be against something else. The first type of booshing fleet I remember were older than supers became common. And they most certainly work well against subs. Ive killed plenty of subs with javelins alone not to mention bombs.
---
I agree, its not small gang. They can but they havent. They can nerf Rorqs as well, but they havent (not scale aspect). They can iterate on the blackout, but they havent. In a perfect world NS defends against dreads with supers/titans and fights off small gang with small gang. I mean Im all for that man. That most def sounds fair and actually quite fun. My alts are skilled for it even.
---
But reality is that many things are unbalanced and the umbrella is built for much stronger attacks than its being used for. So most def, Im all for changes, I just dont like onesided ones that dont get iterated on. Cause I think the current setup is broken as fuck and I honestly dont think alliances will go back to how things were. They will condense and implement new setups that will kill content even more.
---
Its a vicious chain. You nerf, alliances take time to counter and shit gets broken again. And we start again. But we in NS have a responsibility as well. We never should have started dropping caps on everything. That was our mistake.
---
Why should anything persist past death? Risk reward bruh.
---
ITT Null bloc members who clicked the link in Discord like good little sheepys.
---
If sites scram, but everything else stays the same, people will just refit to wcs as soon as they hear a hole fire or see a k162 spawn. The time between the initial scout jumping in and his entire fleet being ready to kill you is enough that you’d almost always have time to refit and warp
---
The reason so many are "enjoying" the post is because it was linked to 30 different null-sec care bear discords. It's just a downvote fiesta for blackout supporters and blind upvotes for former afk VNI pilots.
---
Let me get this straight. You want to strengthen the economy by slowing down production?
---
When you get more isk and into trading and logistics, 2 billions isk essentially becomes a rounding error or a pile of assets that you forgot about somewhere.
---
Also ITT, bitter WHers who spend Friday nights salty about jokes on reddit.

I got hit last time this happened in the r/eve discord. Fortunately it was regular porn so annoying but meh.

HERP ITS JUST BOTS LAWL DERP
---
I don't live in null anymore because of two reasons.
---
One is i don't play consistently, due to real life but also because of reason two.
---
Two is because of the current mechanics of null. I don't see any challenge that will draw me in, it's mostly a bunch of blobs flying doctrine fleets of the same ships around, structure grinding and a lot of mining/ratting.
---
If i was more active, i'd probably try lowsec or wormholes instead, it seems more dynamic and interesting at this point.
---
However, i used to live in null the first time i played. I was smart enough to not keep everything there, making runs to move things i didn't immediately need back to empire space. Still, i had a bunch of stuff lying around across half the map even before i quit, from capturing and losing stations (we moved around a lot).
---
I didn't try to firesale it or make an alt to join the enemies and get it out (and in those days before the API, you didn't even need a "clean" account to do so, it was very easy to join some renter corp of the guys that just kicked you out and get your stuff out).
---
I pretty much just wrote it off as destroyed/lost and kept on playing.
---
I came back more than 10 years later and that stuff is still there, teleported to some lowsec stations and i'm "wtf? they dumbed the game down that much?", lol
---
No.
---
It goes pretty much against the whole way the game is.
---
Too soon lol
---
You should ask ceolmate or whatever his name is to come back and try PFR again was great shooting them.
---
Not the Friendship. If he was, he would be a dirty blobbed.
---
You reply so fast, it's like an AMA for scuffed init. line members who are triggered they can't bot any more. )=
---
You know if your V key is too stuck with cum to activate d-scan you can use alcohol to get it out and it won't hurt your keyboard.
---
&gt; Eve is big enough that there is room for many, many play styles. 
---
I also think about what capsuleers would actually do in real life.
---
And setting up an organization to have competitive combat would absolutely be a thing they would do.
---
 We’re not down here for good fights. And we don’t care about if pgl or vily thinks we’re blobbong. They’ve talked so much shit about PL and how we aren’t committed to our deploys and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we’re here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They’re going to be homeless soon.
---
Hey, what can I say - I get alerts on my screen while I'm not botting.
---
the elbow
---
And you don't even have to D-scan for them! Not like you'd know what that does anyway.
---
I will say that I’ve never played eve for more than a few weeks. But I got in the eve echoes beta after signing up seeing a post about it on a random sub. It has piqued my interest in this game again. Anecdotal maybe, but hopefully Echoes helps your guys player base, because all this “Eve is dead” talk is putting me off from coming back.
---
That's when you press V and it makes a cute noise and then the FC tells you what to do, right?
---
I had not considered some of this... my brain is smoothing as I age.  Thanks m'lady
---
If only cloaks worked like that, "hey is there more astroids here then before or am i seeing things."
---
What would you like to trade for asset safety?
---
What's an FC? I'm new to EVE. Can I join your corp?
---
Dreddit is recruiting.
---
&gt;ncpl hide their krab alts in hard knocks
---
i can't even follow the current reddit thought proccess at this point
---
Yo I didnt make it, love the duder who did! I noticed last time I was on it that he put his ingame name on the page for isk donations.
---
What is wrong with people holy shit
---
Doesn't address the leet pvp bois that use unscannable ships or cloaky T3s to pick the easy ganks. I live in NPC null and I don't have a problem when running around doing combat anoms or just ratting. They avoid that ship because it might be a close fight and they might risk their killboard or heaven forbid their ship. The only ships I have lost on my main since blackout has been either PI or my Astero doing exploration sites and I realize that's part of the game but at the same time they made it to easy for the leet pvp gankers to get kills. My 2 cents and I know it won't change any minds. Personally you could change it to a 5 min delay which would give the leet pvp bois their time needed to get kills but it wouldn't allow them to sit for hours just waiting for an easy gank either.
---
Never heard of them. Link?

This is me right now the first few days of trying to rat and playing cat and mouse (Me the mouse) was kind of fun but when i started going isk negative after a few hrs of ratting it became far less fun. At the moment undocking with a subcap and trying to rat is just a race against the clock to try to break even on your ship.
---
Fitting ships is hard. Ask your mom for help.
---
I'm not an expert on stuka bombing and you should ask more about the subject from players in bombers bar etc. But what I've understood they abuse wormhole mass limit using frigate sized ship that has battleship sized guns and covert ops cloak combined with booshing mechanics. Not to mention they can also bridge using covert cynos. They suddenly became the perfect weapon in blackout era. But that stuff is easy to nerf with just small tweaks. Capital vs subcapital balance is much more harder to deal with.
---
Bombing is a different beast. It is a high skill tool that can be used against big blobs of subcaps. It doesn't scale well because you can only use 9 bombs and anything beyond that will destroy your own bombs. Bombing with several waves of 9 man squads takes a lot of skill and is easy to counter. If you have tried bombing experienced dudes who know how to use bubbles and defence missiles against bombs you would know that it isn't actually that effective against competent fleets. But it's the perfect counter against lazy blobbers who try to win fights using fleet numbers and not skill.
---
I'm not blaming the players for abusing capitals. I'm blaming CCP for making caps too oppressive against subcaps and adding stuff like citadel tether and asset safety which made attacking heavily defended areas extremely hard. All the pvp players I knew in the past quit the game. For example Skillyourself quitting was apparently the biggest sov drop in the history of the game. There are only few full pvp groups left in game. When I started playing there were literally thousands of different 100% pvp groups in the game. That gameplay style was killed. Only stuff left for last few years was coalition level pvp, rorqual mining and super ratting.
---
Eh 99% are scams, then there's the one occasional good contact.
---
I keep trying to dscan the bombers and loki's but its not working

It shows what they're willing to tolerate

I mean, there are a lot of people who seem to think they know what it's like to be a wormholer because they don't have local anymore, so...

Haha. I do this on the inside right door of shipping containers. Hoping to get one back with a reply one day.

Sure, you can log off in space in a Titan and then go alpha and still jump a fleet as an alpha.

Sorry your wrong . I left due to RL issues in 2010 and just came back in 2018. The POS I had stuff in was popped , however that was just every day use stuff and some loot I hadn't moved to a NPC station 8 jumps away. The corp I was in dissolved, but guess what my stuff was still mine. I fire sold some of it at like 10% loss and the rest I contracted out to be hauled by someone I happened to knew in the new SOV alliance. It cost about 15% more than what he charged alliance members but I got my stuff and was able to come back reasonably set up. If that had all been gone I probably wouldn't have returned.

---
I cant disagree with you. WHs are "harder" but they are not invincible. You need the correct setup or youre fucked. Same goes if you sit in a carrier and a dread spawns, you can tank it with the correct setup but if you dont have it will shred you. Not the best example but you get the point.
---
Faucets are faucets dude. If we have an issue with faucets then they should be nerfed all around. Having a couple of percent of a couple of percent make more than a shitton larger percent is much much worse than crying over total faucets.

I havent seen it and Im in a bloc. But maybe youre right. And maybe its just what I said.

But you cant pretend like its masterful work hes done. You cant just pick and choose which regions you belive has or doesnt have umbrellas, disregard that certain regions wont even show up on the MER because of long moon cycles or locust fleets which basically are mobile umbrellas and so forth. He wanted to prove a point so he chose the data that supported his cause, its not new. But its not good.
---
Since when can you dscan cloaked ships? Was there a change I have missed.
---
&gt;What i mean is that if you petition after the fact, a GM will probably deny it because most of the times they decide against duplicating items.
---
This is exactly the point I'm making against /u/Mineus64's earlier comment. Follow his proposal to the logical conclusion, and you see the problem; it's the equivalent of "Your stuff drops, tough luck". But it's hidden inside the well established policy precedent from the GM team, who now have more work in the form of rubber-stamping **no** on every petition. 
---
If CCP decided to change the policy, *to allow item duplication*, then the proposal becomes viable. For the record: I don't think this policy change should occur. 
---
But if the policy change did happen, and let's naively assume that players won't try to exploit it for extra loot (they will *try*, I have no idea if they'd succeed); there's an economic impact on duplicated ships and modules entering the market. Granted common shit like a fitted Ferox won't matter, but rarer stuff very well *could*. Limited edition objects almost certainly *will*.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Tbh, if we really have to keep asset safety for cases of real life  absence or emergency, then it should only be a manual thing (select  items -&gt;move to asset safety -&gt; "are you sure?" warning window  -&gt; click ok) with a long timer before you can get them out. The  current situation where i can just teleport stuff around for a small %  of their value and also never lose anything from citadels dying during  wartime is absurd. '
---
I have the opposite view here, Asset Safety for out-of-game emergencies should be *automatic*. 
---
I'd be totally on board with completely removing the manual Asset Safety button. It provides a tool for hunters to safely extract loot, and it gives people losing a war an option to easily evacuate their stuff ahead of time. 
---
Tying activation to structure removal really slows the process of extracting assets. Losing *access* to assets (even if temporarily for three weeks) you'd use to defend your space does hurt, and is a consequence. 
---
Manually triggered Asset Safety puts too much control in players' hands, and erodes the idea of actions having consequences. 
---
Personally, I think Asset Safety should be a Service Module with a very high fitting cost, and substantial fuel consumption. Having it active in a structure should severely limit what else the structure is able to do. 
---
A tangential thought: what if Asset Safety had an *even longer* lockdown period? Thoughts?
---
Wait, who's the third noob?
---
Everything that is alive is in the process of dying. Nothing has ever nor will ever live forever. Eve is dying you are dying I am dying Earth is dying. Only question is how long. Who the fuck knows. Every time I come back to the game everyone says it's dying but it's still here who knows maybe servers are shut down the next time I try to come back and maybe they aren't shrugs.

You are correct. But they are not being tweaked and havent for a very long time. They are pretty cancerous to deal with.
---
Not really man. FC lines you up and has you in groups and tells which group to press the button. Its F1 as much as everything else. But ye blocs need to work out doctrines specific for subs which I dont think they currently have.
---
Asset safety was always around, just not in the same form. You wont kill citas in heavily defended areas no matter so its not a problem. Tether, I mean sure. I dont find it to be such a big problem honestly. Its shittons better than station games which got abused to shit as well. I mean check LS, still being used as "emergent" gameplay.
---
I dont disagree. It warped the game into something that I personally dislike and have for years. Everything has become a question of defense for blocs and honestly the fun is gone. But that isnt NS fault, its CCPs fault. Because if you in a group dont rorq mine then your neighbour will get a stronger superfleet than you, just like with delve. Rorqs created a cold war and everyone is still stuck in it. That ship needs change and nothing else will work before that.
---
I mean, people argue that the umbrellas are too strong. Because they have to be to defend rorqs. You dont need supers to defend subcaps.
---
North side!!! But I’m at university right now

Fights often happen on grids that have ships flying around hundreds of kilometers away from each other. I'm sorry but it isn't just about perspective. I understand what you are saying but it just won't work. You can already zoom in on your ship if you want.

That worst part of this whole situation for me is: I watched, first hand, this same exact drama play out in SWG. Large, sweeping, game altering changes made for the professed betterment of the game...the same people, making the same arguments, with the same results. Some of us know how that ended. :(

How cool would a casino structure be! Anyone could anchor one but the rules would be that they are all freeported so anyone can dock and play. The house has to put isk in some kind of account that pays out various minigame profits. The structure would be killable with no asset safety and the cash in the gambling account is destroyed with the structure if it ever dies.

It's not about me, I'm already hooked and have been playing for over ten years and will be playing until eve is gone or I am. It's more a change to get some of those other people that are playing the games that you pointed at over that way to come over here. 
---
Showing off graphics in space and during combat I think would bring more people in and keep them around longer. If you don't like my idea, come up with one of your own and put it out there. What the game is now clearly isn't bringing people in. Argue all you want about how shit my idea is until your blue in the face. I don't care. But if there is a chance that this or some other radical idea would help, than you should try to focus more on what may work about it instead of just looking for what you don't like about it and trying to shit on it.

It could also be under “Module not providing buffs”

&gt;But they are not being tweaked

I'm just saying they could be really easily tweaked. Bombers are actually really shitty ships with frigate ehp and big signature. I'm quite sure ccp will nerf them soon. I just hope they don't nerf them too much :D
---
&gt;They are pretty cancerous to deal with.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;blocs need to work out doctrines specific for subs which I dont think they currently have.
---
These 2 might be related? You would need to deal with them in subcaps.
---
&gt;You wont kill citas in heavily defended areas no matter so its not a problem.
---
This is definetely a problem. But one that is really hard to solve.
---
&gt;Its shittons better than station games which got abused to shit as well. I mean check LS, still being used as "emergent" gameplay.
---
Station games don't really work if you can't dock to the station. Idea behind station games is to gank something fast -&gt; deaggro -&gt; wait for 60sec weapon timer and dock. It has never been a problem in nullsec because enemy can't dock into your stations. LS has npc stations and no bubbles so it's totally different thing. And booshing ships kinda stopped that even in LS (and npc null).
---
&gt;I mean, people argue that the umbrellas are too strong. Because they have to be to defend rorqs. You dont need supers to defend subcaps. 
---
This is correct. Problem is that players still used supers to defend even subcaps.
---
And because he'll always be safe he will keep asking for more "Hardcore PvP" changes since they can't affect him anyway.
---
He will also make a graph of PCU always being constant, claiming the game is doing just fine

Nice one Tuz, keep at it. Gonna be interesting to see how many "bots" we lost this week. Sure strange how many bots were in the game though, and that they keep quitting even tho r/eve proclaimed the battle against bots in NS to have been won over 2 months ago. 
---
Its probably the blackout in LS and HS that are causing these new "bot" reductions.
---
Wormholers?
---
As a vaping, vegan, craft beer drinking wormholer that does crossfit, yep you're right.

You can't compare the two. The SWG players cried because they made everything easier, the Eve players are crying because it's being made harder.
---
Its amazing how stupid the average null sec member is it they cant make isk with no local.

This is called ice

Command node killmails would be swell as well

FBI spokesman: We believe the suspect to be single, male, in his mid teens to early 20s. Perpetrator likely devoid of affect, emotional and mental capacity. Likely lacks social skills and may have had traumatic past experiences. Physical appearance is likely unkempt, greasy and unattractive in all senses of the word. Body odor is very likely. 
---
The perpetrator is also likely seeking validation from online personas he believes to be friends. He is likely to be trolling r/eve in search of reactions as well. Whatever the motivation, this is a deeply disturbed individual.

Discord and Reddit are actively working with law enforcement to gather and prosecute to the fullest extent of law.

Analysis: Subpoenaing of Discord records, API tokens and locating IP addresses will be easy. Most VPNs and Tor exit nodes are hosted by government administrations. Not only has the person logged massive forensic evidence in multiple places, but extradition from whatever rathole he lives in will be very easy with international treaties. INTERPOL also notified.

This is like trying to eat icecream on a hot day, you blink and half of it is already on the ground (in wow classic having fun even though its released as something grindy yet it seems to be less grind than current Eve).

Ah yet another "insightful" post from the guy that keeps saying "everything was better before" without ever really giving any answers to how we should proceed. You guys should vote for him to be the next CSM. Last one turned out great!
---
This is great, reminds me of the old EVE Kill. I miss that, and I miss the custom themes corps used to have, it was great. Thanks for doing this :D
---
I think I'll start a craft brewery in our home hole.
---
I haven't seen much in general gaming circles remotely representing that though.
---
Most seem to have gotten it, then remembered how bad it was and quit already.
---
if the station is low power, it honestly should give up asset safety.
---
More often than not when I did that I also had to upgrade links, and that's a little more complex (and a bunch more I would have to write for a "short" guide), but the short version is "yeah, you're right." It would be better objectively speaking to route as you describe, I just didn't feel like dealing with it in what was meant to be a very basic "easy set-up for noobs" guide.
---
*shrug*
---
My man, Im down for any change. But if things dont work I want it gone as quickly as possible and replaced with a new change. If this is truly an age of chaos where CCP is to try out stuff then they should genuinly do it. But this isnt a new CCP.
---
Oh ye I agree. Its as much of a lack of proper doctrine as it is they being broken. 
---
No bloc is gonna allow you to do it. Its always gonna be defended by bigger numbers. And that shouldnt change. 5 people shouldnt be able to kill structures against 500 defenders.
---
Thats true, its a bit different. I just dont like station games at all. And I like the fact that I can sit on a cita and be safe, also repair. I dunno, I think its a good QOL thing in general.
---
Ye but you know its more often than not bait subs people have alts in. But they do exist for sure. But if they arent needed as much then people will be more careful of dropping solo cause the umbrella isnt really as active. Right now it has to be active 24/7.
---
Did you read the post? I don't think I saw it say anywhere that everything was better before.
---
If you refine this it might end up being good copy-pasta but not yet there
---
Ended up getting plex and buying enough injectors to get most of my fitting skills to 5 and tech into covops frigs/astero. Also got my cybernetics up and set up a training clone with +4s. I'm gonna get the hang of pvp in some disposable ships and then (hopefully) start blapping.  At my level the leftovers are still effectively infinite money (outside of plex/injectors), which leaves me feeling like I broke the game somehow (or maybe I'm just struggling with my instinct to grind more ISK when I really don't have to).
---
Honestly exploration does seems a bit unbalanced? I can go exploring with pretty much no skills in my old imicus and come back in a few hours with tens to hundreds of millions. I risk almost nothing (~2mil) on the ship and most of my handful of deaths have been due to stupidity/inexperience. Once I stopped making stupid mistakes I got bored and started making stupid decisions,  I got to the point where I was flying 100mil loot in my cargo hold 30 jumps through null and into Stain just because I wanted to see if I could and also because MORE LOOT, YES MORE! GIVE ME ALL THE INTACT ARMOR PLATES! ( I did make the 30 jumps, I even got some plates! I didn't get to take them home because I was then promptly ambushed and popped.) Honestly the risk of dying with even a hold full of loot isn't that great if you fly smart (safes/dscan/cloak), and a single good can will put you back deep in the black. Maybe I just got lucky?

Ahhhh...what a time to be alive.
---
This just in: more players, more content.
---
Yeah.. OP success, 30bil lost to save 1 rorq. 11/10 would frag again.
---
Alternatively, PA approached CCP and asked what could be done about the dwindling player numbers / ensure the game doesn't die a few years from now since they made an investment for long term benefit.
---
The end fact is that nobody knows what's happening behind closed doors between management and investors and making assumptions is rather useless. Especially if that assumption is to "defend" an opinion on game mechanics.
---
Then go live in lowsec or wormhole space. Highsec isn't the only option, i mentioned both as suggestion and you're still basically ignoring them.
---
&gt;High-sec is WASTE of sp. Cant use bubbles, PDS, caps, DDs, and lets not talk about concord.
---
For a lot of people, those are positives rather than negatives as it is what stops one single entity from controlling everything.
---
&gt;Please tell me you're not saying that high-sec is viable for people with alot of sp and want to achieve some higher goals?
---
It absolutely is, because goals are what you make them. If your end goal is sitting in a blob of supers, that goal isn't possible in many places but you picked avery limiting goal. If your goal is PvP, as you claim, then there's actually a lot of places out there that would fit your goal.
---
Give me 10 bucks and i promise you a posting paradise... It's close to a mining permit, except you can only mine salt...
---
&gt;Alternatively, PA approached CCP and asked what could be done about the dwindling player numbers / ensure the game doesn't die a few years from now since they made an investment for long term benefit.
---
Well in that case they are going to be doubly disappointed given that not only did they NOT stop the dwindling numbers, they accelerated the loss to the point they have lost more in the last 4 months then in the last few years.
---
[I'll have you know it's clearly this when our mining fleets warp in.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM)
---
its like that's that is the only change in the last 2 months you noticed or something, more than just local was fucked with, and the cumulative changes are what are driving the abandonment of the server at this point.
---
the game stated dying as a result of both actions, seems pretty linear.
---
/r/Bossfight material
---
3v3 frigs only.
---
and yet they introduced the ability to do it in abyssals...
---
Eve is a single player game.
---
Whats driving the current abandonment of the server are horribly unmotivated crabs who have had the easy life for so many years. Sorry your capacity for intelligence leaves you unable to problem solve trivial issues. The void will be filled.
---
it'd be cool if people could debate it in good faith, instead it's all meme posts
---
I have read most of his posts since he started spamming his walls of text and they are always the same, it was better before. He keeps repeating what everyone knows the issues are but giving no way forward. Its stagnation or age of chaos and no middleground. Preferably as much regression as possible in the age of chaos as well. 
---
Basically massively long walls of text that state "adapt or die". 
---
But to actually respond. Very few are against change man, in fact I would say most want change. Please, try every solution you can think of, but if it doesnt work revert and try something new. Dont move goalposts as "just bots leaving" or "just bot aspirants" and so on. No politics, just straight focus on improving the game. And dont accept any changes that kills off the playerbase cause we cant afford it.
---
And begin in the right end. Remove excavators, fix citadel timers, fix fozziesov. Give it a month or 2 to evaluate its effects without any login events or chaotic changes to skewer the results.
---
Fix LS, remove cynos from FW, nerf supers/titans ability to properly function there, introduce a shipline which works opposite of the marshal (lower sec status give bonuses) and only let the BPCs drop in LS belts. 
---
Fix HS, including things for newer players bla bla bla.
---
You get me? Its not age of chaos or stagnation, its please for the love of god CCP actually do something with all of the money we are putting in your pockets.
---
when did I say not to live in low or wormhole space? Living in high-sec SOLELY is boring. It's great if you are in other places but high-sec is only good for staging stuff, content wise, its a really dull place.
---
There’s a pun about travel distance waiting to be made here, but my mastery of English fails me on this blessed day.
---
I love this episode, David Attenborough is such a good narrator...!
---
The new changes don't encourage me to log in, no.
---
I don't really care what the optimal way to play is, I just get fed up of people whining about the outcome when people play with the rules that we are given.
---
There's no way to know what happens behind closed doors, between CCP's management and new owners. Keep in mind this sudden complete change in how to go about handling the game, with the goal of fixing the game long term, came *after* pearl abyss purchased CCP so it's just as possible this entire thing is because of pearl abyss as it is for them to come crashing down on CCP.
---
In EvE, you are either hunter or prey. The prey has moved on. They have left the building. EvE is an ex game.  It is deceased. Demised. Snuffed it. The prey are no more.

---
It could very well be. But thing is, their contract was setup as a initial buyout with bonus within a year (finalize the deal). It wouldnt make sense for PA to have any real input on what CCP does until the second part kicks in which is next month. Otherwise PA can crash the game to not pay CCP the extra money right? So im fairly certain creative control is still solely in CCPs hands. 
---
And I think as soon as full control goes over to PA there will be changes from their side. Dunno, they might be worse than CCPs. But I dont think PA are bad at what they do, they are very succesful considering their product is also very niche.

I mean that’s Wai, he is super cool dude plus he gifted me a marshal :p

Try skilling into covert ops frigates if you enjoy exploration. I use the Helios and am able to go deep into Null and back home to High with 100-200 mil in a couple hours + varying BPC’s, some of which are worth another few hundred million profit if you manufacture them yourself. It’s fun with the cloaking device as a safety buffer while you scan, and the 8 AU warp speed isn’t bad either. Oh and my ship build is around 70 million but I’ve made probably a billion in a handful of runs and have only lost 1 ship when I wasn’t paying attention to D scan while watching tv and sitting mid-hack
---
yikes
---
Not sure where you're getting your information from. If you're pvped your ship is lost. Full stop. There's also no insurance so those deaths absolutely hurt. Pve is different story. The game absolutely shamlessly (lazily imo) borrows alot from eve. But the more I play it its becoming clear it's like comparing apples and oranges. This game is just proving that there's a marketshare for a less hardcore eve. There's alot of people who love space games but are understandably intimidated by the learning curve of eve. Not to mention the despair of knowing you'll NEVER catch up with veteran players. Eve is incredible for what it is and I love it. I love this too for what it is. Depending on how eves mobile game turns out I definitely might jump ship (hyuk). But so far I'm absolutely enjoying this shit out of this semi-casual space sim experience. And playing this just demonstrates to me how much CCP has dropped the ball with thier franchise. They should have put this game out years ago. And so what if they include some nods to eves universe? How many games out there emulated Mario and include nods too that? I'm not sure what star conflict is. And if this game fades away so be it. But so far jumping around its not uncommon too see 900+ people in one system.
---
It is gud
---
Imo i fly around in a fucking PvP rocket heron and ppl still run or bring like 3+ factions ships. I stop flying into smalls cuz cloaky bull shit and at ships.
---
Was that a straight-up corp theft - the transaction above that?
---
This is not true.  I ratted in Horde for ages and never got ganked.  It waa before blackout but the same thing applies.  You have to work for safety.  
---
Find a dead end system.  Put an cloaky ecm alt on gate, sound up or on another screen.  Use DScan.  Warp out as soon as you can.  Don't AFK.  Be in defense fleet.  
---
Be smart, don't use capitals to rat.
---
Maybe it was something else? Hmm maybe like they fked over a large portion of their playerbase by giving them changes they dont want over changes they do want? 
---
Hubris kills shit man, as soon as companies start putting value statements/picking sides or start thinking they understand their products better than their customers this shit always happens. Especially an informed and older customer base like ours.
---
You should save your pity for your own lack of intelligence that doesnt allow you to understand that there is something bigger behind this.
---
WH players cope.
---
That's the plan, just fitted a helios after injecting but don't have the time to take it out tonight. As for the BPCs, they're really that valuable? All I was seeing was an option to sell them through contracts for about 1mil each. Manufacturing them myself doesn't seem like it'd work as I have 0 industry skills.
---
A bling drek can run them (assuming theyre similar to minor conduits), or just get a marauder
---
Find what you want to fly in the future and buy the pre-requisite skill books. Need isk to make isk.
---
You can't compress the ships closer to each other without losing huge aspects of the game. There are guns that shoot out to 200km. You just can't show them if you are zoomed close enough to show your own ship.
---
And that isn't even any issue. During the 2010-2014 golden years Eve had over 60k concurrent players logged in. And I can tell you it was nothing to do with graphics.

Hey, new player here too, I dont know what guys are talking about...but I've earned my first bilion in a day after 2 weeks of not really playing acitivly...Now I have no sense what is alot of money and what is not... 
---
In first two weeks I went to null and explored, wich ended me up geting 1bil in 2 or 3 days of few hours a day ( :
---
Easy game
---
Man I used to love me some goatse. those where such innocent times it seems
---
Null sec **KRABS** were too used to relying on instant NEAR2 intel for ratting and now they are crying in mass about it. What /u/cypeth says is true.
---
It didn’t work with nullsec though.
---
The isk you earn via ratting is terrible and I suggest against it.
---
Sorry mate, but care too much to leave head in sand.
---
There might be a reason you dont see alot of other people....
---
https://eve-offline.net/
---
The only people spewing these sort of "bots" comments are people like yourself, probably from a large null entity.
---
Considering how versed he is at loosing ships, we probably made his freighter go *'poof'.*
---
Lol silly boy...
---
let me correct that for you
---
&gt;I figured they wanted to play **good** guys.
---
Yes behind all the screeching are thousands of disillusioned players who believe they deserve easy access to broken capital movements that are not compatible with their current strength and 99.9% crabbing safety from hyper scaling rorquals or even super capitals. This trend in EVE’s  life  is only relatively recent from the past few years. Go back to early null sec crabbing and people were mostly restricted to belt ratting in drakes or battleships and mining the belts. The ability for average players to earn exorbitant wealth is completely unhealthy for a game such as eve.
---
and i will call you retarded for it tyvm
---
I also seemed to have missed how "being deployed" alters the the nature of your formups, especially since I remember the same kinda low skill knuckle dragging shit going on when I was in TAPI, irrespective of our staging. TAPI is shit Soban.  Perhaps it started out as a sperg friendly meme-centric interesting and fun alliance that didn't take itself too seriously, but its evolved into one of the lowest skill, most serious, least fun entities in the game. Welcome back to reality.
---
All of a sudden there are 150 more rocks suddenly around
---
Yes my child only the biggest and bravest can ever hope to kill a mining ship.

nice boomer tier joke
---
Most fun I’ve had in 8 years of playing hands down
---
I got a group in a c2-null with a pvp focus. 
---
Join “the halls of asgard” in game if you want some more information.
---
You would know, spanky.
---
Certain implant BPCs can certainly be worth a chunk of ISK.
---
Yeah, right. Only being jnvolved in like all of them until 2019.
---
Yeah, we live in wormholes. Itsa thing. Not everyone needs stargates.
---
When you have 120m sp on main and 80m sp on alt from afk training but are still measurably a noob in the game.
---
It's me. I'm the noob.
---
Tiny healthbar tho cuz of all the vaping.
---
Another day another retarded shit post by omeca. Anyone want to chip in for a flesh light so he can stop cumming all over himself?
---
blue waffle
---
Eve was vibrant before shit blobbers and micro transactions. CCP and Pearl Abyss are prepared to weather the transition. Don't get too worried. Before Plex, injectors and shitlers Eve had 40k+ averages logged in .
---
The game is setteling about as fast as a meteor.
---
I agree!
---
Good. That's exactly how being in a defenseless ship with no friends to help you in null should be.
---
How? We dont pvp we only krab.
---
On my way to QLPX o7
---
Ow bless the new bro are adorable haha. 
---
"I can make 10s of millions in a few hours."
---
So you want to even out your income, do this by training industry skill to put the items you collect to use. This will make you more money as your removing someones profit from the supply chain.
---
Also make sure you are putting at least some of the cash you earn to fun ships. Always have a goal for fun ships, or you get tunnel  vision on isk making and the game becomes to grindy.
---
Especially since at point Fozzie even nerfed it, reducing its shield resist bonus from 10% to 8
---
You need to change systems, I literally can't fathom going isk negative ratting.
---
&gt; 5 people shouldnt be able to kill structures against 500 defenders.
---
If those 500 defenders are in subcaps then I'm totally fine with that. You can bomb them if they are really bad. If they are in 500 titans then you can't do shit. And that is bad gameplay. Or well if they are defending structures in their own home system then it is ok if they bring 500 titans also. But those titans should require subcap support to do stuff. So you could at least try to go for the subcaps and evade the titans.
---
&gt;the fact that I can sit on a cita and be safe, also repair.
---
There shouldn't be any safe areas in Eve unless you are docked inside a station. That is also bad gameplay and takes away reasons to attack. The original design team of Eve would have never allowed systems like tether or asset safety to be added to the game. CCP forgot their original game design guidelines which made Eve grow into 65k concurrent player universe. Once they started to steer away from that original idea they immediately started losing players.
---
What in the literal satan-worshipping fuck is wrong with some people... Jesus christ that's a depressing headline.
---
honestly, as a new player, spin up an alt and stick the bulk of the money onto an alt, only keep what you need for regular day-to-day usage on your main. 
---
immediately makes you (mostly) immune to common scams since you can't just blindly fall for it, you'd have to hop between characters
---
Safer than null sec atm
---
Actually it benefits NC. Play style, not undocking is the new meta
---
Because before the blackout we had 2 times as many players
---
Enjoy while you can, until the supply chains are all gone and one has to resort to corvette for insta-pvp :)
---
Yes once you start running sleeper caches, common drops are polarized weapon BPC’s, some of which have several runs at 10-20m profit per run. I recently got a 3 run ‘thurifer’ large cap battery BPC that admittedly took 4 days to train into the required skill to manufacture and cost 80m per run, but sells for 300-340m each. That’s over 600m profit. If you have no industry skills I guess you could just sell them by contract for less than the total profit amount. Taking my ‘thurifer’ blueprint as an example, current contracts are going for 600-700m. Being realistic, you’d place your own at a more reasonable 400-500m and just give it time, maybe advertise in local.

Retard. Everybody else is special. I'm the normal one I swear.
---
&gt;why should i loose out from IRL unlucky moments.
---
Frankly, because you went to nullsec. That's part of the rules. Or should be anyway.
---
Ok, let me make your false premise clearer:
---
"The more you expand" You don't.
---
"Add a few systems" You don't.
---
"Try to defend more property" You don't.
---
Clearly you cannot even conceive of a small nullsec group that is not interested in growing into a larger group, but would still like to make use of the great benefits of null.
---
TEST is Brand Newbros and I think Goon is KarmaFleet
---
We. Are. Triglav.
---
\&gt; implying VPN providers or Tor node operators would want to log the traffic routed through them.
---
"Only 400 DPS"
---
| given proper logging
---
Yeah that's a big given. Usually to do proper logging the person in question needs to already be under surveillance. Or else you're just kinda guessing and hoping the information lines up.

Is there a way on either kb to do more specific searches? e.g. Alex Azam Executioner and it will list all the kills or losses by that person with/against that ship?
---
As i have stated, i am wormhole resident. I have never lived in null, well once like a week and ded as noob so, no.
---
Making 100 bil isk in WH is what, for larger group maybe week task if long, I remember how much we made in c5/c4 static, it was horribly huge.
---
You have no gamewide intel, no nothing. Sure evictions are pain but that is about only thing. WH is safer in my opinion than null is, plus earnings are quite extraordinar as well.
---
No asset safety anyplace would be awesome. Affects everybody and gives a motor to shit. Surepy better than trying to appease the kill-meta or too much farming isk.
---
and pay for intel, that would be great. Need hunt, pay for information and go hunting.
---
how many more alt accounts are you going to create hilmar?
---
That doesn’t explain how black out is killing the game.
---
&gt;before shit blobber
---
there was never a time where they didn't exist, the numbers were just lower.
---
LOL  Best line ever:  " They clearly PvE on the side and so this is not a bash against PvE but instead a note that those who now live in null are there and willing to fight for it "
---
ALL My isk says Goons invade anyone and they don't fight.
---
&gt; Go back to early null sec crabbing and people were mostly restricted to belt ratting in drakes or battleships and mining the belts.
---
And there weren't diamond rats there to insta kill them or mechanics to allow cloaky ships to drop a fleet of hundreds in system without them ever knowing it.
---
Yes. That's because it's more dangerous in wormholes.
---
Aww.. was Eve too hard for you before?
---
&gt;nd t
---
Yes, if you look it like that,,,,ooor mayby all the scrubs now come to qlpx to try the same ? One can only hope ;P
---
lol supply chains to lowsec all gone
---
Saw your stream...last part at least. Keep having fun!
---
That is not totally true.
---
Get 10 ships and enter where the enemy lives, and you'll have 10 engages almost instantly.
---
The same doens't happens if you are pirate.
---
Yes CCP please keep up the changes so we can start playing something else.
---
Well that settles that then.
---
No, Corp isnt that rich, SPVG is 99% pvp corp, Our income as a corp isnt that amazing;p

AT&amp;T, Verizon: Don’t worry. We got the logging part covered.
---
People in big null blocks made about 300-500 million per hour ratting in supers or titans before the blackout. Couple that with multiboxing a few rorquals or straight rorqual multiboxing without the ratting part, and you are at 1-2 billion per hour.     
---
And this was the slightly-above-average line member.     
---
Now the industrial or market guys on the other hand.... they can make a 1-2 billion per day without even logging in. If you have a good day (wartime especially) its possible to have 10-15billion in profits in a single day, for 2-3 hours of ship spinning.     
---
And yes, all of this is part of the problem and the reason why blackout &amp; chaos era exists
---
I've had plenty of fights. One out of a hundred won't fight you because they don't get LP - most either want to finish their site or they're ok with the PVP anyway.
---
Well this pritty much. And just like in RL it takes isk to make isk,,the more isk you got,,the easier it gets. At some stage the earning factors stack so much it litterly takes almost no efford to ''double it'' ofc,,,takes a bit of knowledge into the game,,but yea..time to practice
---
For a genuine answer? Probably not that much.
---
If this is a (group of) trolls, then the answer is pretty straight forward: Like most such trolls they just _do not care about their victims_.
---
The only difference between such trolls and trolls that spam (regular) porn/gore is that the latter group is just afraid of the consequences of spamming worse material. The former group seems to either not be afraid or in a jurisdiction where they can evade punishment easily.
---
They just track the entry point, not the exit. And the trackers on websites only get the exit, not the entrance. that's why the person needs to already be under surveillance, so they can match those.
---
He did, Honor still survives in EVE \\o/
---
Ice can be mined in hisec though, so regional topes aren't really a thing because it gets funneled to Jita.
---
someone will be by to take that super off your hands soon enough.
---
&gt; no asset safety
---
&gt; enemy typically knows how to do more than just anchor/f1 and wait for the umbrella to show up
---
"Safer"
---
They wouldn't need to buff the reward for null if they hadn't just cranked up the difficulty...
---
In terms of what runs EVE (isotopes in ships, fuel blocks in citadels) and best comparison to "spice" in Dune, it's really ice.
---
Sure if scam citizen ever comes out and wont cost the equivalent of a car id give it a try
---
Maybe, but as far as controlling a regional good goes, it isn't.
---
cloaky tengu's in chaos era ? wut
---
that makes them safer not more dangerous, what's the chance someone wants to try jump a fleet through a whole that might let 50 or 5 people through with no warning which one it is?
---
Thank you for tuning in. You can always watch the latest past broadcast if you missed the start.
---
because its boring as fuck, I have a super I hate ratting in it, because its repetitive and boring, I'd rather play other games then super rat.
---
dw, m2, my ceo doesnt like it when I unleash myself on a toy or two....the first time I did he send a corp fleet after me to get me back alive...ofc I died to a PL hotdrop ;p
---
The $60 I spent on it years ago is an investment for my grandkids, I hope they'll have fun with it.
---
It was more difficult to get more quality fights as we were getting dropped on daily basis 5-6 times per roam.
---
It's  fraud...
---
yup, Last few years I did alot of trading, selling capital hulls, building them ofc. Bit of freightering from emp/0.0 Half a year ago I think i earned 45B a month just by copying titan/super bpcs and all their parts for packs etc.
---
I mean anyone that plays the game for a while atleast knows this or is capable to do what I do in whatever decree :) Only takes a bit of focus and proper market knowledge

It was just as risky for the person hunting you too. Eve isn't like that. I've been able to fly ships so cowardly since Blackout that 'fights' only occur on my terms. They end on my terms. I can AFK and have a wank while I wait as the defender must be on edge at all times over something he will never see coming. The pendulum has swung in the complete opposite direction that is not a good thing. Cloaky hunting is now one of the safest occupation out there.

Oh yeah, i see that - only missed it because my browser blocked the popup /o\\

I mean teens have been charged over sending nudes to other teens with felony distribution of child pornography.  So it's not outside the realm of possibility for a judge to think you're just trying to get out of it and sentence someone anyway.
---
The theme is blatantly stolen from EDK, the code however isn't EDK - even if it offered itself as creative inspiration for some of the features and code :P

Thank you! :)

Custom theme is one of those things that are a bit out into the future, but it's definitely a possibility - but probably first when the frontend has been rewritten to Vue - which should be sometime before the year 2080 :D

Same story here. Started playing Eve again this July after a break (RL obligations...).

The ridiculous cyno Velator, cyno Sigil, cyno Ibis, cyno Gnosis, cyno Phoenix, cyno Harbinger, cyno Brutix, cyno Megathron, cyno whatever, even the ubiquitous cyno Proteus - are gone. Relieved.

Goatse was mean but still at the level of a prank. Prolapsed asshole porn isn't my thing, but it's also a consenting adult doing it.
---
Well, i did write this to calculate points for a killmail, based off of the EDK point system - so it wouldn't be difficult to put the points front and center, but yeah - just trying to keep it simple and to the point - without too much complication or decision making for the user.
---
&gt;sending nudes
---
sending is TOTALLY different than having a cached image on your PC and you being a normal person in every other regard.
---
Good thing nowadays any smallscale/solo player can ask in response to endless whine "then why do you live in null now?".
---
Cant really say much about a game that does not exist yet
---
No the risk was 0
---
For me star citizen is a scam. Or his devs are more retarded that eve’s ones
---
Then don't super rat? Not sure how this applies to you.
---
How ironic
---
Case and point, I got fuckin sick of it and shut down an alliance about it.
---
Yes and no - it is possible with the API, but it is not exposed in the frontend.

The people bragging about getting heaps more content now don't live in null, they just like easy Hanks and hated being the ones getting ganked before.

if you love this game, dont be a troll.  It matters... just think about your posts before you make them.

That's fucked

Ice is NOT specific to any real region, and you can mine it in Shattered Whs, LS, Ns and HS.

They need to make Spice a thing !

Thank you.  I hope to inspire the next generation of intelligent shitposters.  r/eve needs more of this !

we reached out to the CEO of Netflix and await a response.

thank you!

Both parties should take some responsibility, although what has occurred is I suppose mainly down to human nature

"Immense popularity"

Lmao citation needed
---
A lot of fights in Eve are more like Rock Paper Scissors. The actual interesting bit is formulating your fits then trying to get yourself into a position to gank someone. Adrenaline rush for 30 seconds as you see if you were successful.
---
awesome !  Need more Reddit posts like this
---
Theres been several studies showing that if you control and have logging on even a relatively small number of nodes you can defeat the anonymity. These were by students doing it security research so i have little doubt state actors can do this. If they are actively doing it though its likely they have bigger fish to fry.

Think about enigma, breaking the code was a successful approach because they guarded the knowledge and only acted on very important info or things they could get a secondary info source.

---
I've re read his post after reading yours and I cannot find where he and you disagree. Fundamentally it seems like you both agree that stagnation was bad and killing the game, and that there have been losses due to blackout. While he didn't name these specific changes that you mention, I think he would probably agree with you on several of these points. While I agree that blackout was abrupt, I want CCP to make brave changes because something needs to take us out of this spiral. I don't know for sure if blackout is it, but it certainly showcases their willingness to try something completely new. We will see in the coming months what else they are willing to try.

Or one could argue they didn’t want to live somewhere with no targets - so they chose to have no blues and base out of a place that gives them access to all of eves regions. Seems logical to me

Drones should match the lowest resist of what you're fighting. Use show info on rats to confirm which it is, then get multiples of that drone. 
---
For tank, damage control and reactive hardener should not be fit together IIRC. This may have changed, but I remember they had some special stacking penalty. I think there is a betterarmor repairer, "accommodation", but I could be wroong.

For mids, I would suggest capacitor. Either a booster, battery or recharges. The latter 2 are better suited for pve.

Why are you all complaining about not having local when wormhole space is so safe without local and asset safety? Last time I checked if I got tackled I couldnt cyno in a fax and a bunch of supers to save me either.

---
yep. it's called "fleet up  &amp; undock"
---
It will be great game once it will get to playable state, It MIGHT become the next best space MMO but It seems that by definition it won't have the total and broad spectrum freedom that EVE has. Because you will play it in way way different way than EVE it probably won't be the game that would take over EVE but rather a game that you would play when not playing eve. It will be absolutely insane experience on it's own if they deliver what is planned. It's long term project obviosly. People who say it's a scam should perhaps pull their head out of there Olmeca had(has?) it.
---
[citation needed]
---
Further Suggestion: Warn before undock of absolute shit-fits and recommend alternative modules.

Analysts: commodity investors are short selling Glycerine-based lubricants.

I'm not arguing that I'm saying that everyone saying how great these changes are don't live in null and only enjoy it because it's made it easier to hunt and not get dunked by people defending their space.

Abyssal sites are botted to fuck, there is a corp of 30 passive gilas in jita that run T4s all day and every day. If you want to see for yourself just sit on the jita undock for an hour with combats and watch the gilas with the [PS18] tag.

Meh...

fozziesov is great! the best skirmishes i had yet, were all about the current sov structures.
---
cyno jammers fuck that up a bit, but generally, it forces people to play smaller, faster stuff. and with the last update, insta-warp ships are not really feasible anymore.  
---
just make the entosis ship also immune to burst jammers, then it would be close to perfect
---
A bitter vet reception will be held at the American Legion shortly, but god damn, this brings a tear to my eye
---
Apparently one dumb Russian thought it would be a good idea to just set Eso green. Hint it's the dude who lost 7 rorqs and nearly a nyx.
---
Yep if Goons are not mining as much as everyone else combined nobody would ever mine a million ISK for a T1 hull.
---
This seems so dumb it might just work.
---
[removed]
---
&gt;So at that point, the delta-v to get to perfectly aligned would be 150m/s.  
---
&gt;If that was the start of the alignment, then it would be at zero.  
---
&gt;And as force is applied. is applied in that direction, it would go across the screen to aligned at 100%
---
Thanks :)
---
But this is where I don't think it would work as a status bar in a game like EvE where factors could wildly change from initial conditions.
---
In an example where a freighter begins at speed 0 (breaking gate cloak frex) and initiates warp towards another gate, the "progress bar" would start a 0% and work up towards 100% as the freighter accelerated towards 75% of max speed in line towards the target gate.
---
But, what happens when the progress bar is at 50% and the freighter then gets bumped by a Mach and is suddenly doing 150% of its max speed at a 45' angle to the warp vector? What would the "Progress bar" show?
---
Brave Empire
---
Tread carefully friend, this isn’t a happy sub.
---
Actually funny if it wasn't so true!
---
And these die to one bomb
---
as will, most ships?
---
&gt; happens when the progress bar is at 50% and the freighter then gets bumped by a Mach
---
Recalculate.
---
&gt; What would the "Progress bar" show?
---
The force needed to align it.
---
The force is still a singular number so it can be presented via a bar.
---
Yeah the "sending" part kind of changes the arithmetic.
---
&gt; If this might be an alternative when It is much more playable. Maybe 2025 or somthing
---
lol well played
---
its actully working,especially  pissing people at gates,few long-distance campers and evryone is dead
---
FW  is the best when theres good activity in the plexs. 
---

---
Most ships have some sort of redeeming factor.
---
Why do you think they gave us blackout and vin changes, they want in game risk to be harder so more people buy plex.
---
It's got nothing to do with making null harder and everything to do with $
---
Oh look it's another goonpost complaining about losing local.
---
Make it 100mn and it might be interesting
---
I would join Faction warfare in a heartbeat if:
---
- The war was only valid in lowsec
---
- I wouldnt get fucked by standings
---
- It wouldn't force my whole corp to join
---
I dont like making decisions that lock me out game content or cause inconveniences.
---
yeah ive heard stories from gaming friends from less fortunate countries that makes things like this sound like some harmless joke and its perfectly "legal" as long as you can pay the corrupt people in power
---
Well, there you go. I miss doing gaming journalism.
---
Plex price went down, ship/modules T2 went up, so u probably give them way more euro then before.
---
Most of the russian left the game/ Chinese are growing and both are not paying for the game/plex do to coversion rate or legal reasons.
---
That will work if flown right(dont fucking gang  warp in on the bombers at 30km ffs) 
---
Depending on the bomer diffrent ships will work. Against hounds mass mwd retris will shred them. Keep in mind proper stuka fleets are well rounded with plenty of anti tackle.

---
And they have the ability to crit their entrances.
---
More people buy PLEX with credit card, less ISK needed to buy PLEX from market. Less ISK needed to buy PLEX from market, more people farm the ISK to buy PLEX, unless you lack the time to play even a few hours in a week. So it all balances out.  
---
Once upon a time, even high-sec mining would earn you enough ISK to buy PLEX from market. It was below 800m for a month worth of PLEX. Then rorquals and super ratting became rampart and we reached 2b ISK for a month of PLEX.  
---
In the long run, everything will balance out. Easy and safe ISK earning should have stopped or the game would have died anyway, just like it happened in Serenity.
---
I invested about $1000 so far over a few years, enjoying the state of the Alphas but it's almost more a scientific curiosity for me to see if it can be done.
---
People with time but no money farm ISK to buy plex.
---
People with money to pay for sub but no time to farm ISK and feed the plex market.

Easy.

Can't wait for this game to wash up this bullshit elitism we have here

give us more nullsec and lowsec connections
---
Been saying that for years - it's just a way of plugging yourself into a mentally ill hivemind designed to sell advertising.
---
TOLD YOU
---
People were already doing that lmao
---
Just a bit of a meme friend, don't think to hard into it
---
You don't seem to get the point. Yes, you could cyno and drop a fleet before but I could respond if I could get a cyno up before your inhib. Currently I'm just fucked unless I want to feed a couple of recons to a bomber fleet/small cloaky gang. And esp for a subcap I'm not doing that. So what the other guy mentioned, I don't mind the change but I'd like to be given the opportunity to counter which in it's current form doesn't exist. In regards to your point 6, I think many people were agreeing that something needed to change. But completely killing off a decent chunk of the player base seems like the wrong way to do that. Ride it out? Maybe but many people will just unsub cause why would they give CCP money if they feel like CCP is actively trying to get rid of them?
---
I swear, this wasnt even a Minute

Because the gates I'm wormhole space can be turned to the "use at own risk of not jumping back out" setting, where as null you have no control over what can come through.

Boring as fuck

Retarded as fuck.
---
FC speaking, the standing fleet in no way, shape or form can save a mining/ratting subcap. And if the gang that killed you is equipped with cloaks they'll be off-grid and cloaked so we can't avenge you.
---
You must have never spend 0.1s in a standing fleet actually trying to save people. If you're this ignorant, why post?

"Neuts" spoil the fun though.

And we didn't find good fights yesterday. Just ganged up on someone in cheap Thrashers.
---
I hope eve dies there too...
---
If they're not iterating on it then the direction is still gonna be shit. The PCU was going down long before blackout was an idea.

Haven't you heard, it's actually good for the game that nobody is in space.

---
The universe is big because the game used to be a vibrant sandbox.
---
As it evolves into an arcade style FPS, more space because empty due to the tendency of humans to seek things they enjoy.
---
They came for the sandbox. They leave because their sandbox turns into an arcade machine that accepts credit card.
---
Who?
---
My theory is they want to test the cyno changes and not enough people will be mining/super ratting in blackout.
---
Underrated comment.
---
I mean the game is still stagnating, bigger and bigger blocs every day.
---
I'm sure the player count will rise any day now so people can have friends in null again, just gotta keep strong till we hit zero then everything will be amazing with thousands of people willing to die over and over for literally nothing happily.
---
m8 I'm afraid of counting how much I spend on Eve, I do feel like it's justified though since it's the only thing that really distracts me from the real life when it's needed. right now it's six accounts, all on a monthly basis so full price each... been five accounts for the last several years... could get me a car plus bribe some dudes to get me a license if I would save up for a year and a half. fuck that though, this is more fun.
---
Worst decision ever! BO is amazing, and they even said minutes before announcing that its being removed how it was enabling them to tweak risk vs reward even better.. what the hell. This makes me so sad, I have had A BLAST with BO.
---
I live wherever i want buddy, nullsec included and now it is way more convenient to live in null. As for safety starving krabs, highsec would welcome them with open arms, there is so much space and safety you wouldn't believe.

Null won't be empty for long and sooner carebears leave it the better.

---
Yeah but those facts are wrong, the 12 people left said so.
---
* You can easily fit a large destroyer fleet through a crit wormhole.
---
* People roll wormholes with entire fleets behind them, so at any time a wormhole can open in your system with a fleet behind it. A good player with a prober + sabre can tackle you within 30-40 seconds of opening a wormhole.
---
* If you get tackled you can't bring in reinforcements if you close your wormholes. 
---
* There are also no cynos to bring in a swarm of fax if you are in trouble.
---
* If you get evicted, you lose ALL of your assets in that wormhole.

Maybe, but there'd be more goodwill from the player base if they would tell us if they're testing stuff or not, because right now it just looks like they're responding to the tantrum thrown by goons.
---
Lol who knows.
---
😂
---
thank you. added :)
---
TF you mean worst case scenario? This is the average. Best case scenario they bring a small gang that actually wants to fight. But that happens less often then you might think.
---
And ofc you can save subcaps in a standing fleet but that's more luck than skills, unfortunately.
---
Maybe now they'll feel safe to undock so hunters can jump them when they're alone in local.
---
It’s always been possible.
---
it should now happen in high and low space.. then for one day end of blackout in  thera
---
Heil Satan. Wot u on about
---
Not entirely true, since many FC´s (and fleets) have said how much fun it has been not knowing where the enemy is and making a ton of smaller, unplanned skirmishes. To each their own I guess.
---
Hilmtard is panicking and hopes all of the people that quit are gonna magically come back.  Spoiler:  He's gonna panic harder when it doesn't happen
---
So the strong can sit cloaked alone, hoping someone uncloaks long enough to have an honorbru bomber 1v1, except 5 of you are in delve and the other 7 still playing are in venal.
---
im worried that the turn blackout again on, form 1 day to an other without telling something
---
Either way blackout's cancelled, my point still stands that if you're in a defenseless ship in null and you don't have support you're supposed to die.
---
All those changes will change nothing as long as 2 fat blocks sitting in null jerking each other off and getting fatter. If something needs to change then it is a maxium number of character in an alliance and coaliton that can be blued. Or the Tribute "war" will repeat. The block comes nobody comes to defend because it is pointless and "wow eve is ded nobody fights anymore".
---
Krabs have won Eve
---
Congrats to all the cancer turbo blob alliances and their CSM representatives that made this happen!
---
Plex prices indicate that they don't, but sinking plex prices had to discourage the sellers from buying at CCP sooner or later.
---
Well, that's the end of chaos era. CCP has just shown they don't have it in them to make the hard choices and EVE will continue it's slow death.
---
That's completly retarded, bots are gonna restart botting instantly. If anything, it's those stupid cyno changes that should be reverted.
---
I am so torn on this.
---
On one hand it is fantastic for corporations because the money will flow back in from all the ratters and such. But on the other hand, Blackout forced members to start to actually working as a team because we could get hit at any time. It requires people to be social rather than semi-AFK, and I really don't like the removal of BO for that.
---
More salt with blackout than without. Mild annoyance from the hunters, but massive salt resulting in hourly posts from krabs/goons.
---
Too late ccp the damage has been done I for one won't be returning.
---
This is dumb... its one of the resigns i came back
---
or that the blackout was to cover the fact they fucked up the chat servers and now they think they might have fixed them
---
LOL :D
---
Lmao, listen to the crowd cheering
---
Next step add local to Wormholes GJ CCP
---
Real life still lets anybody take down a dictator. The game has mechanics that prevent dictators from being taken out. 
---
Short of a rogue director, goons aren't going anywhere. (And even then nothing might happen.)
---
Good joke mate.
---
There I was thinking my Titan had being built at a bad time.
---
New players that want to learn will learn without them. This helps a little, but if I person cotinuously shitfits amd dies repeatedly.. well.. I had one of those in my last corp. "Yeah, let's fit frig mods on BS and defend this"
---
Is this the man with the wizard hat?  What are we talking about?
---
Ditto! It is a hobby, not just a game, this is my justification. So, say, instead of buying golf equipment or rare coins, I buy PLEX to fly pixel space ships.
---
we need a massive war again, but i guess it would be hard because of blue donut
---
Eve is gonna be fucking alive, now.
---
^^^^^
---
The most important thing is your in Chicago and made it home alive! Great work. Keep your head on a swivel
---
... they never stopped, they juste moved to highsec.
---
Yes bois! Back on the road straight to Serenity! Full speed ahead! Restore your near near2 folder from recycle bins and off you go!
---
ccp salt generator goes both ways and it's always delicious, just like your dad
---
Trade across eve being down 18% on average over the last month might have been a bit freaky too.
---
best bit of news iv seen all day, blackout was like flying wow, sounds brilliant on paper and for a little while even feels really good, but eventually it starts to sink in just how shit it is .
---
Well, back to cloaky camping for content i guess 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
lol euros, brexit 4 life
---
Or..... The tantrum thrown by pearl Abyss at the disastrous numbers lately. Goons are doing fine, CCP can only hide the player count for so long.  
---
I for one feel like it's a bit quick tho, personally I don't have any problem with blackout, but if I'm being honest its hard to deny the game has gotten quieter/less active.
---
I came back after a 5 year or so break.  
---
played 2003-2007 and 2009-2012.  
---
seems all the nulsec alliances went soft, people want to be "safe" with local chat telling them to dock  
---
people arguing local gives targets.... why should the krabb get a huge warning danger is coming.
---
people should learn to scout, learn to use dscan, not rat/mine and watch netflix.  
---
at the start pf the stream CCP were going on about the elite players that avg 4.4hours a day, played over over 7years and have an average of 13 alts...  
---
13 alts!!!! who can multibox mine or rat in safety!!!! these are the elite?  
---
wtf happened to eve-online, the big alliances were always at war now it's turned in to nulsec is highsec and safe place to make isk with no risk  
---
Back in the day in nulsec 70% of people who lived their thrived on PVP..  
---
blackout just tells me most the pvpers stopped playing
---
Well bringing local back might be the thing that finally helps me 'win Eve.' It was the biggest and best shake up CCP ever did. BOT armies will be back, Near2 will be pinging krabs when roamers are 3 jumps away so they can safely dock up. I give up, krabs won.
---
I once saw a video of an American judge literally get into a fist fight with a defendant because he insulted his family.
---
Just saying.
---
I don't know if by "director" he means "telling someone to kill themselves live at a CCP event on stage" mittani/mittens, but i don't know who else it could be...
---
Ah right, they just see action 10 jumps away in intel and safe up.
---
Love how all those ‘blackout is bad’ propaganda posts barely get any upvotes.
---
Still they were injecting way less isk in the economy. Is it really possible for CCP to make the wrong choice at every turn ?
---
I dont think about star citizen
---
He can't be gone from CCP fast enough. With all the crap they've done with this Chaos Age, only real chaos they've created is to their bottom line. Too many have finally won Eve, and have no intention of returning, like my wife and I. Just can't trust CCP to not screw up and screw over its players.
---
First they get half the pvers to quit the game, now they try to do the same with pvpers. Big brain ccp. Appearently hilmar really wants to go commit sewer side.
---
Booooooooooooooooooooooooo!
---
grr gons hat gons
---
So you can read minds and have access to data only CCP has?
---
Goons threw a massive tantrum, or maybe you haven't seen the daily and hourly posts about the PCU or insulting Hilmar or other disgusting and childish behavior.
---
&gt;I for one feel like it's a bit quick tho, personally I don't have any problem with blackout, but if I'm being honest its hard to deny the game has gotten quieter/less active.
---
They did say it would be an indeterminate length of time, so we all knew it was a test, but the game was getting quiet and less active long before blackout. The release of WoW Classic and other mmo expansions gave people a convenient excuse to take a break when they would otherwise login and afk rat or shoot the shit.
---
Ohhh now some poor HS Care bears can't hunt in safety anymore to feel like real elite pvp guys... All  this salt incoming... But you know what? If you don't like it, quit everything and contract all you stuff to me. Adapt or die!
---
I just hope they learned something from it.
---
Or maybe they're just stupid. - I'm hoping they're just stupid.
---
congrats :P
---
Obviously
---
/u/alphaempire and tricky, I said dictator because in reality one person can make a huge difference in taking down an empire. In EVE an empire isn't gonna go down easily just by removing one person or figurehead. Is Goonswarm Federation going to die if a director disbands the alliance? Probably not.
---
Calmil has been using these for years, can confirm they will work very well against bombers.
---
yes the blackout was, good to see CCP making a positive change by removing the blackout :) glad we can agree
---
That sucks, blackout was really cool for solo, small gang PVP. It felt like old Eve, like you could have random encounters, you could hunt things and not getting blobbed right away.   
---
The RMT'ers and the bots won. Also it's really sad that the leaders of the big NS blocks made it sound like it's a shit mechanic so the people didn't gave it a fair chance and stopped logging in.
---
What if that's support in the sense of information? Like idk seeing people in space.
---
Spineless CCP is spineless. I really had high hopes that 2019 was the year that would make Null dangerous and challenging again. I guess not.
---
Well of course, eve just does not feel right without bot, with all those empty systems on map, the low player count. Welcome back, our machine overlords
---
Thank you,
---
&gt;From the local shutdown
---
This is going to age like milk.
---
i knew they wouldn't stick with it tbh, it was the first step forward CCP made in years
---
The cyno changes are good, it means supers aren't dropped by anything on anything, and it requires some actual thinking before dropping caps beyond "okay light the cyno before the inhib goes up."
---
that anoron guy is hella grr gons mate
---
Apparently CCP’s balls were on a loan
---
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
---
wow. you've gone full circle in like 10 minutes. 
---
Blackout was a good thing, i will miss it but it won't stop me coming and murdering you! 
---
I am the boogie man - deal with it
---
I'll take your stuff :p
---
Whiny?  Coming from the person who is obviously salty about not being able to rat in peace without interacting with others, in a sandbox game?  Lol.  Ok.
---
ahahahaahahahaha what plane of existance are you living on?
---
until a retail version that is somewhere close to the product advertised is for sale as a completed game is hard to compare it to a retail game.
---
Is Discord actually doing something about it now? I know they were pro furry CP (called cub porn) for a while and they only did something after the word got out, so they then banned it. 
---
I remember seeing something about it a while back. Was a few news articles from more gamer oriented websites and such. Apparently a server had a problem with someone posting it, they reported them to the Discord community support or something like that, and got a reply from one of the members basically telling them to fuck off, nothing was wrong. This CS member is, and several other, if not most or all of, the members of the CS team a/o the staff/senior staff are known or suspected furries as well according to some articles and rumors. 
---
On mobile, otherwise I would link. When I get to a computer, I can edit my comment if no one links them before hand.
---
Half happy half sad, while this will help with my crabbing, I will miss the bait we could set with no local XD
---
Anyone have an albion guild i can join?
---
There's been a few kills where I was on dscan for ages trying to dscan a ratter down. If they just paid attention I wouldn't have killed them! Now with local back they just see a neut enter a region and then dock up.
---
Gosh get over yourself and clearly CCP doesn't see the appeal of your narrow minded idea of what null should be as they are reintroducing local on Monday.
---
No it's not. It's just being able to tell when to run away which is shit for gameplay.
---
I'll take your stuff since you're a whiny bitch.
---
Would love it in low sec,we can hit more than one button on keyboard!
---
cyno changes say no
---
After tasting how EVE can be not just theme park pandering to pve oriented carebears, bots and RMT, making all garbage to come back with local is just sad.
---
You will have more bots and other garbage, but actual players who came back with blackout and cyno nerf will be leaving.
---
Nice priorities you have CCP.
---
Thin goon-pet spin about "disastrous numbers" is hilarious. Literally NOTHING about login-numbers indicate that CCP are losing money because of Blackout. Yes, numbers are lower, but than can easily be explained by the thousands of plexing alt-accounts mindlessly farming away. 
---
So what CCP has managed now is changing the VNI bots to Myrmidon, Oracle, Gila or Ishtar bots. Cyno changes won't change that.
---
have you ever carrier ratted for any serious amount of time? I did, exactly once, it was the most boring god damn thing I've ever done in this game. You're completely off base about my dislike for the current shit show hilmar has turned eve into and its why your posts here are a bad joke.
---
I mean, they likely are. Anyone who thinks they can get away with this kind of shit is massively if not irredeemably stupid.
---
Authorities _really_ don't like it when stuff like this happens as it makes prosecuting legitimate cases harder as well.
---
America FUCK YEAH.
---
Don't worry... I will xD
---
It is just so funny that everyone who told us before to adapt is now crying!
---
CCP never said that the blackout will get a permanent thing. Get over it.
---
The most salt came from goons though.
---
It will be ironic given how many times l33t pvpers poke fun at null blocs for arranged fights when that is all there is left for them to do.
---
Or maybe they finally realized that there are two sides to null and risk free easy hunting didn't help how they wanted it to.
---
Weak, catering to the Krabs again. At least ore prices will drop I guess.
---
it may be to late, what if this was the final blow, the coup de' grace, the final nail, all she could take capt'n, etc. 
---
I am kidding but also i am not.
---
Correct, we have plenty of our own. What we don't have is your cookies. And that is a problem that needs a solution.
---
I don't. And most people have stopped, the only thing that even came close to making the boredom worth it was the payout and now that's not worth it.
---
Well the first positive change in null-sec for literally a decade and the daily salt from people who mistakenly think Eve is a game about PvE with PvP elements (if it absolutely has to) has at least to some degree caused a back-peddle.
---
You did it Reddit!
---
There's a mile long list of dead supers, titans and carriers on zkill that are calling you a liar.
---
Netflix responded with legal threats due to their share price drop after BO and cyno changes hit them so badly.
---
Who knows, maybe a 10 years slow death is better than a half a year one... Though I'm afraid the it might be too late and a lot of people won't come back.
---
Yes, it should be botting haven. **/s**
---
It has only been 10 minutes but i've not really seen any tears.
---
Maybe a few F's to pay respects!
---
How unreliable is phone verification?
---
Hopefully there are changes around sov and citadels.
---
Swap the insurance payouts of fax and dreads.
---
  
---
People keep yelling about goons and black out, without knowing that the goons have been loving the black out! We drop caps allot more then we used to, and its so much fun watching the panic people go into as a sup cap fleet drops there loki, or there 200 man bomber fleets XD
---
Or one of the few things you can do in a PvE fit ship.
---
50/50 eh? we'll see when the pcu spikes.
---
rewards to be looked at fyi - from twitch stream today
---
Horrible decision.
---
Damn liberals always tryin to take away our supers. We have the right to defend our homes. From my cold dead frozen corpse.
---
Just because it's your only option without a standing fleet nearby doesn't mean it's good gameplay. It just wastes everyone's time both the hunter and the PVE-er. If EVE incentivised fighting the gankers more we'd all be much happier.
---
there is no 300+ range for Ravens.
---
Initial reaction is to always throw the toys out of the pram. 
---
I too will still hunt in null and BLOPS the people I catch. We got plenty of content before BO and will after
---
I would however like to see a happy medium or somthing to replace blackout, like not appearing in local whilst holding gate cloak. 
---
Be interested to see what CCP does next. Roll on Eve London :)
---
&gt;a maxium number of character in an alliance and coaliton that can be blued.
---
You realise we had this and it did nothing right? Nothing will stop me from not shooting my friends, I don't need the game to help identify friend or foe, its just a bonus if it does.
---
Bunch of "players" that "unsubbed" during blackout won't have adapted to the cyno change yet.
---
I sense some upcoming lolz on zkill.
---
Yeah... Because it won't be missed. It was a nice experience. I get it. But at the end of the day many people quit eve because of this. Enough to make CCP think about their actions and take it back.

You saying people weren't attacking Hilmar? What world do *you* live on?
---
Im a goon and I hate blackout, but yeah its not super cut and dry that we all hate it. I'm just having a giggle  at this anoron fella and his reee goons approach
---
"might do something with wh's later on, idk"
---
CCP has never understood them or their mechanics but you know might just mess with them a little...
---
I bet it wont. I doubt it will return to old numbers.
---
Yet why have goons been posting about the PCU and whining the most?
---
Maybe.. goons hate it.
---
The player base changed, it s about retaining new players and make them inject into ratting capitals. They have to make the game safe and streamlimed for this.
---
Suck mittani dick harder dude
---
I am a wormholer and I find this offensive
---
499 IQ wormholer btw
---
Wormholes are better and the real way to play eve online btw.
---
Just letting you know I am a wormholer.
---
Stop projecting the way you want to play as 'the way it's supposed to be'.
---
Knowing when to get safe can be a valuable skill and gameplay for the PvE-er. They might not enjoy the PvP part at all. Now you can say that's not the way Eve is meant to be played (even if that's only your opinion). But I can just as easily say that due to Eve being that sandbox we love everyone can play the game they want.
---
I assume you own a wrx as well
---
Lol
---
What happened to HTFU?
---
Jackdaw
---
I am hoping that they go belly up, and that CCP buys it out, and uses what they have to make a real game, I do not see them putting one out on their own.
---
more than keyboard has buttons?
---
What would you rather have:
---
- warping off every hour for 30 minutes because of roaming gangs
---
- getting some PVP kills every hour on top of ratting?
---
It's really as simple as that.
---
&gt;Literally NOTHING about login-numbers indicate that CCP are losing money because of Blackout. 
---
&gt;Yes, numbers are lower, but than can easily be explained by the thousands of plexing alt-accounts mindlessly farming away. 
---
You should do some real hard :thonking: about your logic champ.
---
-goon f1 pusher
---
That's literally exactly what my post said, of the payout was worth it, it would balance out.
---
If you find ratting boring don't do it, but plenty of people like it and continue to do it.
---
This post isn't for you.
---
lame
---
Just "resign" gracefully then?
---
Well... what can I say... fuck nullsec.
---
So neither the hull tanked or dual buffer tanked Rorq meta seem to be working out well.
---
Yea attacking bait has led to some of the most fun I’ve had in a long time. I don’t krab so can’t speak to that, sorry to see the end (
---
Absolutely we gave Hilmar shit because he deserved it :) but its hilarious thinking the wormholers arent a bunch of toxic cunts either lmao
---
F, back to near2 and rampant botting.
---
Yeah cause that's the goal lmao
---
Yes personally attack Hilmar because you're a bunch of manchildren. Nice one, keep saying wormholers are the toxic cunts.
---
Best part is when CCP Falcon says it's going to be fun and quietly hating the words he just spoke.
---
24/7 farming bots in null back on Monday Pog
---
Good riddance.
---
Fucking pathetic lack of commitment to an ideal.
---
It's still there but you don't really get fights, just fast ships chasing eachother round the place.
---
Salty goon :)
---
AAR is that we are bad and feel bad because we didn't bring enough inhibs or we'd have gotten a couple more Rorq's and a Nyx too possibly. They are bad and should feel bad because they kept mining while intel told them them we were out and about, they jumped dreads in to kill our bombers (lol) and there were so many that a couple bumped off and we bagged one of them on a return pass. High fives all around, went home to take some AOM sov and dumpster their fleet while we were at it. Origin is recruiting.
---
It's been trending down long before blackout
---
Unsubbing all 25 of my accounts until the blackout returns!  CCP will not have my money!
---
you're so salty dude :)
---
Much of what r/eve calls Salt was  concern over the rapid decline of people in NS. As well as other areas of Space.
---
Goons, TEST, and Panfam literally share the highsec keepstar market. Why go to war except as a circlejerk "hey look we're fighting!!!11"
---
Thank you.
---
Monthly economic report shows that blackout caused total ratting income to drop to \~1/3 of what it was before blackout. Some regions saw even bigger drop. Tenerifis dropped from 1.5T to 0.3T or 1/5 of what it was. With less ISK players buy less ships. With less consumption producers would stop producing goods. With less goods produced less will be mined. Overall there are less things to do in nullsec. With less things to do why play? Why live in null if you make less money than in high sec?
---
Literally everyone in a corp or alliance is there because they want to. I know we don't hold elections for CEOs but calling them dictators is just silly.
---
That is a ship. Yep.
---
Goons bitched too much I guess
---
Good, now they've seen what's good about blackout and what's bad. Hopefully they can now design a system that's workable for krabs and hunters.
---
Yeah, I'm not holding my breath...
---
It's an analogy.
---
Tantrum thrown by goons? Looking at the August MER, goons seem to be the only nullsec entity still mining and ratting in nullsec. Everyone else just moved to hisec to mine/rat... lmao
---
exactly... I see how they make the whole game a "you have to pay for everything" game...
---
Insurances for ships
---
Every service
---
etc... Ships? dont know If you can built them
---
Cool, cheers. No real point in doing it solo then eh?
---
Risk free lmfao until this week every ship you tackled could have lit a cyno, still every ship you tackle can have a scram, a bait tank, and a falcon cloaked next to it. You still have to scout gates for camps etc, it wasn’t risk free you fucking mong.
---
Have you *seen* their posts on the subreddit? And when the forum post went up most of the comments were from goon f1 button pushers.
---
But flipflopping on it will just make even less people log in. They already lost all the krabs, now the hunters will just log off too.
---
It's probably not to bad solo with an alt and frag quick responders
---
even if it does, that is a sad sad thing that the game is full of carebears and players that dont take risks.
---
For me, it was 'lol I've taken this travel loki through endless camps, they can't touch this'
---
*spawns on top of a can*
---
Also the camp isn't always there.
---
Sounds like I was sorta hoping to try. Thanks, my dude.
---
I remember when eve was a niche game not for everyone.  
---
CCP said something like 5k concurrent users was profitable for them.  
---
now it seems the game has to be popular. yea ofcourse to a point you need fresh players to enter the game.
---
but it's not blackout thats making them leave, it's the scams that CCP allowed in the game from the start, noobie goes jita gets scammed, quits the game. or noobie gets ganked for fun, loses his ship quits the game.  
---
also when you make a new char and your 1mil sp see you need like 30days to be able to achieve almost anything in the game unless you buy plex to sell, why stay?  
---
30 days is like a lifetime, new players should start with more like 3-5mil SP and at least get a cruiser.  
---
add gnosis as a starter ship and make them become worthless so people dont make alts just to sell them for profit.   
---
I don't see how blackout is affecting new players since they probably aren't headed to nulsec when they login.  
---
although some of the people I knew way back near the start of eve that came to nulsec and joined an alliance in their first week when all they could fly was a frigate seemed to be the ones that stuck around long term.  
---
but thats probably more to do with being mentored and raised to learn that losing ships is part of the game, alliances will replace their tacklet frig, theres always a fleet they can join for pvp.  
---
now it's like do people even PVP? these people would probably be put out to mine and told to learn mining skills which isn't much fun.
---
&gt; Blackout or not I will still hunt you as i've always done. 
---
Good I look forward to this :)
---
I very much enjoyed the blackout. We got to do a lot of fun things in the beginning!
---
But I'm also very glad it's finally over. It was starting to look very bleak and lonely.
---
Yeah exactly. So what not every ship is gonna have a cyno, they just use Near2 and get pinged when someone shows up in local and go dock up.
---
now if only they could blackout on Jita
---
Rorq miner and paper here I’m fine with blackout, cyno  change more annoying but can deal with it. Blackout is amazing though, no worrying about local anymore! So much additional screen space
---
Lorenzo can you try and be less toxic ?
---
ccp Falcon looks like he wants to die
---
Uhm just warp away? Lmao supers carriers died multiple times a day hunters just had to put effort in, now every tapi noob can take as much time as they need to setup a gank.
---
Concern trolling. As if the game's self professed biggest assholes care.
---
While this does cater to my expectations, I would like to know how you drew that conclusion?
---
Sure, but what would really kill the game is if the people who want to create content end up leaving because of reverting changes like this so quickly.  I'm pretty sure a whole lot of people were looking forward to be able to roam in the blackout with the cyno changes, but krabs wanna krab, and if theres no one bothering to hunt anymore, content dries up and all you have is krabs online... fun fun
---
TWO POWAFOOL
---
we can only hope they dont
---
Can't wait to go back to playing farmville now that people can get back to docking up when they see red.
---
Oh ffs!! Gonna have to redo my overview :( I liked not having Local taking up screen space :(
---
Could quit goons and start killing em.
---
hey I was positive on your other post :)
---
LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!
---
Not appearing in local whilst holding gate cloak was what blackout should have been in the first place tbh. A much more balanced setting than the all or nothing switch CCP seems to enjoy flicking on and off.
---
we will see a increase in number but no because the blackout end but summer end
---
Hilmar couldn't learn from his actions if they brought in a team of PhD's to explain what happened
---
Go back to your wormhole lorenzo
---
Thicc ass boi
---
Salt is good for you :)
---
Re-read what you just wrote
---
&gt; like not appearing in local whilst holding gate cloak.
---
That would be a good middle ground I think hunters would be content with, but it still doesn't solve the problem of being instantly pinged in an intel channel and everybody docking their nice shit up.
---
Woah pump the breaks. I thought the reddit narrative was we hate the black out and all their claims to the contrary where just them trying to manipulate CCP into ending it because we actually hate it...
---
Ccp gave in a crumbled faster than expected on this lol..
---
can't fit back in the wormhole, booty got too much mass
---
Hi, my name is Kaito and I'm a Goon. I don't hate blackout. I've lived in wormholes, I can live with it.
---
There's two side to it. On one hand, I feel more engaged with what I'm doing. You never know what's lurking out there. There could be 100 bombers cloaked waiting. [Ask me how I know that, go ahead](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78884220/). It was over in 5 seconds flat, because they caught me on a perch with my pants down, but it was immensely fun. This would never have happened without blackout.
---
On the other hand, space feels empty. There are [45058 members](http://coalitionsin.space/##coalition_5) in the Imperium, but unless you're on grid with them, you wouldn't know. I travel through space, and everything just feels lonely and empty. And this is in the most densely populated area in Null! It just feels wrong.
---
Delayed local works in W-space because W-space is completely different. Nobody really controls more than a single system, due to the random nature of wh connections. A modicum of teamwork goes a long way towards staying safe in a single system. Players know what they are getting into when they move into a wormhole. Taking local away from Null post-hoc was a mistake.
---
It made it empty.
---
in WH space cyno doesnt work and you have control over wormhole connections plus there is a limit of what can enter your space. In null one ship can bridge almost any amount of ships.
---
I get you're a goon and can't read, so let me clarify. 
---
Blackout meant salt from goons.
---
No blackout means mild annoyance from hunters because they understood it was a test, and at worst it goes back to the status quo.
---
if you can't figure out that the PCU tanking is a sign the game population is not healthy and the blackout is a large part of the people quitting there is no hope for you.
---
Some one should start a salt mine. Obvious to see who lives in nullsec.
---
is "salty" the new "reeee" now for all you goon haters?
---
Yeah... Content... Content was dead. Sorry but I don't care about crabbing (I hate mining for example!) . But most parts of Null were dead. I did way more than one solo run through null. I hardly found anyone to fight. And I am not talking about mining barges and VNIs. I talk about other players with guns. Even Provi was dead. 
---
The idea wasn't bad... But the way they did it was bad.
---
Omegalul
---
Yes it is :) ask GMVA :P
---
That’s the ex-FW guys?
---
I think you drastically misread the MER that showed goons dealing with blackout just fine while the rest of the game pretty much just stopped PVEing, the only issue I had with blackout is the lack of PVErs it created making it really hard to find and kill people who weren't logging in.
---
Blackout worked for what it was intended for hitting bots and testing the water with actual players. In turn what seemed great for PVP wasn't, it took longer to hunt, not as many pve players undocked and people grouped up alot more under the umbrellas. Mix everything with games like WoW Classic coming out people just weren't logging in and some not subbing which as a buisness is bad for CCP. So the idea was good on paper but in practice wasn't problem you have is that eve online is more like ping online people are playing so many games nowadays that they don't have the time to grind isk non-stop and only login for fleets.
---
so...we get brownout instead? where stuff is just about as reliable as it was before?
---
As if the game population was healthy before blackout. Stagnation with no reason to fight, cheap supers and titans with month old noobs injecting to rat in them. Yeah good healthy game, at least blackout was an attempt to shake things up.
---
i guess they probably fuckedup their developement post-blackout and undo it than just wait people quit  
---
they speak about a gamedesign change at the last csm, probably in 3year...
---
It was worth it before, then they added risk, now suddenly its not worth it and they are realizing they have to add reward. This indicates it was balanced right where it was before, Hilmar just decided to fuck with it for no reason because of reddit posters like you.
---
Yet goons whined the most.
---
Indicating they turned up the risk so much its unbalanced now.
---
I can still drop supers on anything, I just need to inject a recon alt. Rorqual saves are harder now, I guess.
---
It also made capitals fights less likely to happen/escalate, which is stupid given the state of capital proliferation. Logistics are also a pain in the ass. Even though we agree that something needed to be done to cynos, these changes are just rushed up band-aid solutions, that most people in NS dislike (unlike blackout).
---
From inside Goons, it doesn't feel like we're throwing a tantrum. We've adapted better than anyone else.
---
Because the population was tanking, who the fuck are we gonna shoot if the server pop keeps falling off a clip you nitwit? That was the source of goons be angry.
---
The small ones couldn't cut it.   The big ones did just fine.
---
&gt; Goons threw a massive tantrum
---
We did no such thing.
---
Legitimate question though, by driving up costs (and now recently, more broker fees) -- do you think EVE wouldn't ban together to fight a common enemy -- CCP's fees?
---
We went from losing a 1,000 people every month or two to losing thousands EACH month, it may not have been real healthy but hilmar went and shot it in the back of the head with this Chaos bullshit.
---
Looking at the bright side we may have another war between the null blocks in the near future. Whaling and krabbing is all well and good but wheres muh us vs them in space gone since blackout? Cant go to bombers bars home and burn it down because they are murder hobos without homes.
---
Waicheun be a wealthy duder.
---
Potentially ccp has more ideas to come.
---
Cyno changes will still be massive for the safety of capitals ratting.
---
No one likes seeing their friends stop logging in. Chat rooms being emptier.  I get that some goon probably bent you over at some time in your eve career. But most of us are sweet lovable fellas.
---
I like you sir.
---
An illiterate fool calling something dumb
---
:thinking:
---
Exactly, the krabs are off, and will stay off to see what happens, now the few people they lured back with blackout will leave again and they'll have an even lower pop with even lower levels of player trust towardsthe company.
---
similar dollar investment here too
---
Thank you for your kind words
---
&gt; the money will flow back in from all the ratters and such
---
But we never stopped ratting and mining. Blackout didn't change much about what we do, it just made the game feel smaller.
---
Adapt or die xd
---
Haha
---
That’s not quite the case. For the first time in forever the generated isk was down enough for them to look at the rewards. They’ve removed blackout and I suspect they want to see the risk factor with the cyno changes. If it returns to the pre blackout days rewards won’t change but I suspect it won’t and they will change at some point
---
You still cant dock up rorqs in time for them not to get tackled.
---
This might stem the massacre of excavators, but more rorqs will die due to the cyno changes than blackout
---
Hey if there's no one left for me to be an asshole too, what's the point of subbing? Can't have a gaming reserve with something to hunt living in it.
---
High sec and "big nullsec alliances" were the only ones surviving (1T isk mined or ratted) in the Blackout.
---
Well to counter this I'm going to subscribe 100 accounts!
---
They still in FW they got the best of both worlds just now but we will keep scratching away :) I have a cunning plan Baldrick!
---
I know friend :D
---
They were under control cause no one was logging in to rat and the bots had just moved to highsec.
---
yep, part of his soul has just died on camera
---
I had a feeling this was the plan from the start. An unexpected purge to get rid of bots and test the concept of delayed local, but ultimately one that would end.
---

&gt; useless rorq miner in null-sec
---
You do realize that Jita prices have been rising for a while because we stopped exporting our "useless rorq miner" ore to highsec, yes?
---
I suck at golf so... EVE
---
you have corp chat and alliance chat for that.
---
you've produced more salt in this one thread than the entirety of reddit during blackout
---
The top dog has been killed more than once, but it took actual balls and ignoring the killboards to get it done, and no one has the taste for that anymore, in this new CCPls nerf my opponents age of eve we see hilmar encouraging.
---
lol, this is so funny and you have no idea why.
---
Everyone in eve is a toxic cunt. It's part of the culture.
---
Same btw
---
Can't blame the guy, there's no soul if he doesn't eat. He still needs a job and CCP still needs subscribers, both are interconnected. :)
---
The problem with blackout is it hurt legitimate players just trying to rat in their subcap more than it hurt the already rich rorq and super pilots and the bots.
---
why the fuck you not on comms I need to smug with you :)
---
Please someone make this happen - Love ravens and seeing a volley of torps/missiles from a raven fleet is pretty sweet!
---
A lot of pvers were driven out with the last two months of haphazard changes, there may not actually be enough people left willing to play to even out those numbers.
---
it will rise in monday
---
Only a goon can worry about the population.
---
Hey, at least we still got the cyno changes right guys?
---
Definately easy gangs is what we strive for every night :D
---
You might give this a try, yourself. If you do a good enough job, blackout might come back.
---
We can all see the PCU, and we can all see the MER data, both fell off a cliff.
---
Explain your weird ass logic about how plexing accounts make CCP money and i will explain to you how wrong you are. 
---
The people who put plex into the game (mostly pvp'ers) are the ones bringing CCP money - not the krabbers buying that plex from afk-activities.
---
&gt; restart botting
---
If you really believe that any bots left, I'm afraid you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Actual bots are businesses run for money from RMT, not John Nullsec Miner who "bots" his 7 rorquals. Unless there was literally no money left to be made, these businesses won't leave. They will adapt until there's no way left to adapt. I mean, would you quit your job and close shop just because things became slightly less convenient? Fuck no, you wouldn't. Neither would anyone else.
---
Did I miss something is blackout gone
---
What about stain-guy resistant?
---
Guess you don't read reddit often or drank too much of that koolaid.
---
I have seen those posts by goons predicting that the blackout will only hurt smaller entities and make the powerblocs even stronger. And that's exactly what happened.
---
Shut up SIOT nerd.
---
They really are wonderful arent they
---
&gt;thousands of plexing alt-accounts mindlessly farming away.
---
how can no one be pveing based on the MER, AND thousands of alt accounts be mindleessly farming away at the same time? Its like you aren't even stopping to think rationally because of how angry you are black out is going away.
---
It's one thing to use a player hub, but when that results in giving isk to the cancer blue donut? There's people that would rather not.
---
only an idiot doesn't look at the player base taking a 30% dive in 4 months and start getting worried about long term viability of the game.
---
Oh so all those Reddit posts didn't happen. Gotcha.
---
Wait. So wormholers = pro blackout, everyone else = anti blackout
---
Is that how it is in your mind?
---
Development of the game began in 2011 let that sink in 8 years. In terms of gaming it will be DOA. If it ever comes out of its development hell.
---
The thing is, most ratting moved to a very strict ROI-based strategy. The kills you got were either morons who still undocked the bling, or irrelevant and already paid for.
---
CCP caved in to the loss of bot account money...
---
What's behind your desire to see other killboards beyond the obvious 'choices' angle? Given everything uses the same data and all?
---
They were fighting over it for a year, I would say and it was a stalemate. Now that they've agreed to protect, it's as safe as Jita and lower cost.
---
*(I actually still use Jita, but just giving you context on why this cancer exists. No one wants to perpetually fight over it.)*
---
Cap fights were already less likely to happen. Instead of fighting PL/NC just let the north get blown up.
---
I literally said in my first post that it's to risky and the reward needs to be bigger to make it worth it.
---
Like what are you even arguing you retard.
---
It wasn't empty before?
---
Bruh there has been a war going on between pandafam and legacy.
---
## bruh 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
---
Obviously it was the **CSM** which is also controlled by **GOONS**. Just how many pies do they have their grubby little **MITTENS** in?
---
**OLMECA GOLD**....you were the **CHOSEN** one! You were supposed to destroy the **GOONS**, not join them. You were supposed to bring balance to the csm, not leave it in darkness.
---
If you look at the corporate wallets for anyone outside the major blocs, it absolutely was a major hit with multiple corps being forced to merge to try and stay financially afloat.
---
It's not like they literally told us it would be temporary, right?
---
We clearly aren't seeing the same things. I've been quite neutral with a touch of "grr gon", but it is funny seeing all the goons showing up to cheer it. 
---
Almost like they're the ones tantruming.
---
Clearly CCP can see that black out wasnt having the affect that they intended.
---
Removing local made the hunters job so much easier and the ratters just a sitting duck waiting to die so why keep playing in that situation.
---
Did they give an ETA?
---
On Monday it's gone. Back to the Near2 and bots everywhere.

I miss being able to turn off station services. Managed to get a couple fights entosising those.

pretty much you cunt :) &lt;3
---
Ohhh Noooo!!!!!! Not higher prices!!!!!!
---
Did this game even exist before rorqs and JF supply chains?
---
No, you're just choosing to interpret them in a way that fits your narrative, Anoron.
---
Best decision CCP has made this summer. Time to resub back in my 30 ratting alts and farm escalations for dayz :)
---
NUUN is recruiting
---
This: "  ever growing sense of isolation and "empty null" feeling ".
---
obviously not but in the same vein as anoron "grr gons" secheh here I'm talking in broad strokes
---
Soon™.
---
Well said...
---
I hope they retain the option to share individual bookmarks. Otherwise selling escalations is going to be a PITA.
---
What panic? We all know your supers will drop as soon as a cyno goes up.   
---
In fact its now become a betting game on ts, how many supers and titans will they drop, and how many of those will be the faction version.
---
Unfortunately I think you are right.  Hopefully this will stem the bleeding.  A truly delayed local - till you break you cloak from entering system would have been such a better solution.
---
Quality flair bait
---
https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/211169-mit-researchers-figure-out-how-to-break-tor-anonymity-without-cracking-encryption           
---
          
---
Out and about but this touches on it, hopefully actually cites the research.
---
Just plex another alt into a falcon.... the only way to deal with inflation and botting was to increase risk. Players just made it clear they wont stand for any risk they can't mitigate by subbing another alt.
---
All involved in the war in the south deserve some props for keeping up the good fight. I was very tempted to getting down there and being a linemember on the frontlines.
---
And that's only the case because they ADDED RISK, had they left it alone it wouldn't need to be re-balanced because it would still b balanced.
---
Very nice, verrry niiice. Always found it strange that digital coordinates were treated like keychains they you have to people with addresses on them.
---
Why would I need reddit to know about what's going on in my own alliance?
---
You people and your logic baffle me.
---
I didn't say "Jita is empty and you can't buy anything any more", you nincompoop. I said prices have been rising.
---
One area of conlfict in the entire game WOAH
---
Most of the devs live in WHs or used to live in WHs..
---
So alliance/coalition bm could become a thing?           
---
ACL for bm folders is what i’m getting from that
---
et tu elkin, et tu
---
Read MER, check Plex prices since blackout and tell me again that bots adapted. Fuck no, they just moved to highsec, where they produce way less isk.
---
god damnit, i just resubbed
---
What are people's thoughts for null regarding a system for region-specific local chats, instead of system by system in null specifically?
---
My logic was ' who cares and what is your point'?

Time to pile up the PLEX again.

siri what is beaten wife syndrome
---
Good question. Only you can answer why you don't know what has been happening.
---
My point is that the trend is bound to continue on the usual curve. The "useless rorqual miners" have a huge impact on the game's economy. So much for being useless, eh?
---
Then again, I'm clearly trying to reason with a 6 year old who's too busy kicking the floor to even listen.
---
this made my day :D
---
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you worked at CCP and had access to data to completely unravel my argument, my bad.
---
I mean I also hear there are conflicts going on in Vale between a bunch of small groups that flooded the area after NC. And goons left. Also some stuff is kicking off in syndicate. Just because a conflict doesn't involve goons doesn't mean that there aren't conflicts...
---
\*back to people in space to shoot at

I guess he want a harsher, crueler space but he got an emptier space instead.
---
Are you slow? Do you think alot of mmos can survive 12k active users?
---
🤣
---
Hell fucking yeah!!!
---
Why are we on the test side of the BR?
---
The cyno changes actually is an interesting change and had good discussion, but the drifter, NPC vs NPC intrigues, and blackout release -- just looks like a mess and failure to recognize the silent majority of the playerbase that pays. *(Obviously the silent majority started speaking up later on.)*
---
Actually not true historically, we know a few do currently but not in the past.
---
Mostly us downvoting him cause it’s Lorenzo and he’ll get too smug and we’ll have to listen to him on comms.
---
Single fights over astras or tcus dont beig new players to the game
---
To little to late,  damage  already done , hij CCP
---
So long as the rewards aren’t at pre blackout levels it’s healthier
---
Maybe he saw the data and did just that.
---
"Monday is when the blackout is out", 2 months from now...
---
It wasn't that balanced before,they were isk printers, at least now with no cynos it's better.
---
Nice
---
Oh I forgot that those were bots
---
I would personally like to see blackout as a thing that happened map wide maby a few hours here and there or a few days here and there maby 3-5 days 1-2 times a month at random times? maby both.
---
 oh well i can wish for all i want, ccp do whatever they feel like anyway.
---
too late, already 3.9m
---
All changes are done with the absolute minimum of dev time. If you want a nuanced change, don’t expect it from cop.
---
After navy battleships rebalance and meta-module tiercide, I guess?
---
lol, given the decreased number of ratters in the game, they are going to have to turn rewards up to a point where fewer ratters can make enough to even out the loss. Meaning the few still PVEing, will now be making much more then they ever could before, and now with local they will be "100% safe" again as r/eve likes to say.
---
 Moving from early alpha to beta test. Only took 1.5 decades. Don't rush things.
---
well according to r/eve local makes nullsec 100% safe, so the isk printing will again commence, only now the payout will be even higher...
---
The silent majority spoke up by just not logging in
---
If you do that you wont have money left for different game projects other than eve
---
The problem isn't bringing new players to the game, it's having them stay after 24 hours.
---
And I just started flying on bombers... Sad
---
its a shame, but they always said it was a test. im guessing they learnt a lot about their playerbase with it... so much for EVE online being super hardcore... but anyway, i hope that this is just the start of what will be a long list of big changes to the game. theres so much about the current eve that doesnt live up to what it could be or how its sees and markets itself...
---
Blackout didn't change how programs like that work, though. They don't require the local channel.
---
Have you seen reddit in the last couple weeks?  :)  They logged in on reddit.
---
PLEX price increased by 300m in last 2hours Pog
---
Plexing accounts makes CCP money because those PLEX came from the CCP store.
---
Plexing an accounts actually costs more IRL money than a sub.
---
So what was the point of blackout?
---
What actually ends? - the no local bit?
---
Did you really just try to guilt people for not playing the game because they didn’t like the changes lol
---
Frat and tapi are having a massive war if you hadn't noticed.
---
good guys win again
---
you make it sound like it's something bad or irrational to hate goons
---
This post aged well
---
holy fuck why is it only the wormhole goons piping up in these discussions. stfu you're not the actual cancer
---
I just find it funny the haters have a flavor of the month term to refer to us.
---
two weeks on, two weeks off.
---
The economy worked before Rorquals could mine, so he kind of has a point in saying you don't have one.  
---
The low prices that were in place aren't a good thing, they were the result of you guys ruining said economy.
---
Pretty sure they always said it was a test, ie: temporary.
---
But leave it to giant reactionary pussies to cry, bitch and moan that they can't Krab in perfect safety.
---
I wouldnt mind delayed local tbh
---
We knew that after Hilmar wanted weekly changes, and there were fuck all changes for about a month or more.
---
I miss those Razor Soviet style propaganda posters from years ago. they were always good for a chuckle
---
Blackout doesn't bother me much either way. Cyno changes on the other hand were an easy fix, but they came up with a stupid solution instead, then had to change it again because of industrials. All that was needed was capitals ships could not fit the module.
---
Nah, hes pretending to be an FC. (One that never leaves delve though)
---
Talk to Malo in Querious, its definitely a thing
---
if anything it made the game feel bigger. could be 30 lokis cloaked up on you at any given time. Now you'll know for sure you're all alone in system.
---
i don't get the use of FOTM here. goons have been crying pretty much non-stop since the introduction of blackout, and the term salty refers to that behavior
---
Luckily I bought a new box last week 👌

Thanks bud!

I know what you mean, the other guys in weebfleet are almost a month ahead now :(
---
There used to be a Constellation channel, they could try that but I doubt it would appease the people that dislike the blackout.
---
The other night I logged into EVE and there were less than 10 people in our standing fleet comms. There were less than 200 people in alliance chat. Normally we would have more than 200 people just in standing fleet. Sometimes a 2nd fleet up. This is an alliance with over 18,000 characters. Risk/reward was so broken that 90% of us said "F this, i'm taking a break."
---
At the end of the day, EVE is a game. If it's not fun, people will quit.
---
completely the opposite really. but okay lol
---
Did you sleep through your economics courses?  A leftward shift of the demand curve lowers price, and the quantity supplied drops.
---
oh look, you're pushing your false narrative that blackout hurt the little guy again lol
---
Yeah I'd concur with this.
---
The lack of local has made my life as a small gang/ solo hunter both easier and harder so it really hasn't changed too much overall. 
---
It's harder to find targets and when I do they've primarily been bots. Equally I don't know if anything is forming up to respond, so my bug out window is substantially smaller.
---
I don't either love nor hate the black out.
---
His weird ass logic is probably just standard economics...
---
Just make a list for all of them and set timer for 24h and recycle empty lists.
---
There is too much reward for the zero risks involved in selling escalations
---
Obviously not?
---
So they are just murdering DED site selling then?
---
Are they just bringing back local or are they rolling back on cyno changes as well?
---
Blackout was intended to test whether it would increase player numbers. Tuzy ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0x07YVe3Ag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0x07YVe3Ag)) put some nice analyses of the actual real results as measured by the independent eve offline website and other sources at peak hours basis up on this reddit every few days. These clearly showed a decline... a very SHARP decline... in real log in results and player engagement. The Blackout was running for some weeks, clearly did not work as hypothesized and now it'll be gone. I just hope the hard data will be useful in avoiding such touchy-feeling based Chaos 'ERoticA' debacles in future.
---
hurr durr, if i cant krab it must be empty
---
Adapt or die?
---
Theres been plenty to shoot at.
---
much like your posting
---
yes, crying because were watching the game we all love go off a cliff.
---
Can't blame people for not stupidly risking 10s or 100s of billions of assets because CCP wanted to make everything like WH space - people will only laugh at you if you get caught.
---
Jesus dude you masturbate to your own smug any harder and you’ll pull it off.
---
didn't really need another rorqual multiboxer tbh, bye
---
This is where we pretend it's not drastically more empty than it was this time last year right?
---
a reduced number
---
Ya blackout will be gone, and cynos back on all ships. Titans can now boson and immediately jump out, through bubbles and points
---
what is vaorware
---
The decrease in pvp ship losses in August says otherwise
---
I haven't mined as much in a very long time. It's not a narrative, just personal experience that when you group up together, you'll have more safety. When you group up capitals/supercap umbrellas together, its easier to Rorq mine in that environment than an environment with no umbrella. How is this "false"?
---
They did. So it was no no longer worth playing there.
---
People seem shocked when an area or space stops being worth living in, that people stop living in it.
---
To be honest it is probably a special agreement so we all stop killing the trade market citadels, which was killing everyone's profit.
---
As a project manager, sc has taught me what not to do
---
Without someone using that plex to pay for a more expensive sub those pvpers have noone to sell to and ccp loses money since demand goes down as do sales.
---
I often forget the people I talk to on the internet could be 12 years old with no understanding of economics.
---
I think it was for a little while when it was new. I still see spikes on [timerboard.net](https://timerboard.net) but it really isn't as prevalent as it was when interceptors were allowed to entosis.
---
To each their own, I suppose. It felt much smaller and empty to me. I've had plenty of experience with the cloaked unknown, from both sides of it. I firmly believe blackout buffed cloaky doctrines and nerfed absolutely everything else.
---
Some people love the constant pressure of danger. Some of us like to choose. Today I want the adrenaline. Maybe tomorrow I just want to chill for a bit. The fact EVE allows me to do both and still play it means a lot to me. But of course, the hunter turbonerds will disagree vehemently, and that's fine. It's still amazing that we can all play and enjoy this game with such varied opinions.
---
I  masturbate  to The Mittani. thankyou for being worried about what i watch when i touch my  self.
---
That's because most people have this defeatist mentality. "everyone is docked so why bother" sort of thing. Might take a little longer but there is plenty to shoot.
---
Most of blackout salt is nullbears crying because the game started to be a bit less easy due to non immediate intel, less afk farming  and adding the cyno change your nice super umbrella can't come as easily as before
---
and the little guy has no ability to "group up"? yeah 1 guy in a procurer really doesn't belong in nullsec, but if he had two friends that pvp nearby, he's relatively safe. Rorqual's are capitals, of course they need backup.. that's how capitals work, pre and post blackout
---
well normal folks learned no local is not a magic fix it pill for Eve. I doubt hilmar learned anything.
---
&gt;Maybe tomorrow I just want to chill for a bit
---
literally why highsec exsists
---
Everything worked before everything else, that's not an argument. Eve has always had an economy, and nothing CCP does short of literally removing the market system will change that.
---
I actually agree that Rorquals should have very limited or no ability to mine on their own, in exchange for being a huge force multiplier when put in a fleet with barges. But the fact that rorquals can mine doesn't make them "useless miners in nullsec". Far from it. They are *too* useful.
---
big woop i wonder what the sub rate is. Did it help stop bots nooooooo
---
Yea I heard about the inty/entosis change, but I think I still have to do a lot of reading up on the mechanics. Cheers for the reply!
---
Well that's kinda what happens when you turn peoples space into the place they choose not to live in.....
---
Blackout was cancer and really wasn't worth the risk for CCP seeing that if you wanted to live without local you already had that option! Oddly enough living in WH space isn't anywhere near as popular as nullsec, so CCP should have seen the sudden drop in numbers coming a mile off as people don't want to be forced to live in a way they don't want to play.
---
it's a bad analogy
---
anyone can just leave their group in eve if they want to with minimal issues, in real life you're leaving your family and friends behind and possibly in danger
---
Ya, who wants more players...
---
Didn't the play count go up after blackout? Heard the Plex prices went down harder than bitcoin
---
Partly because we needed a shakeup and to leave Tribute to start building an industry, and partly because, well, NC plus the remains of PL cannot fight goons plus their pets. Not even Horde was deployed as it was useless.
---
Don't forget the single origin, organic bean, soy latte and gluten free stuff.
---
Good. I will too. Sadly I will miss being able to perv on mining fleets while they don't know I'm there hehe
---
What in the hell are you trying to say
---
Agreed.
---
i'm sure you would know, personally i haven't had any problems finding players in nullsec. But maybe you just don't know anything about hunting
---
So they will gain more ISK from selling their Plex, but into a market that is super inflated because of an endless ISK faucet created by the very same botters. Yes, Plex sold for cheaper since blackout, but so did everything else. Markets will adapt.
---
I have a masters in economics and quite frankly your ignorant perception of how market economy work is hilarious. 😂
---
To be honest it doesn't change a thing, they'll just add more bots to compensate.
---
It just means that you need another alt cloaked up in a recon ready to light up. I suppose that does nerf Rorqual mining (again!) as you'll need to sub another account that isn't contributing to the isk flow.
---
&gt; and the little guy has no ability to "group up"?  
---
This is context of the 1T in mining I spoke about (take July MER as Aug MER seems off on values). 
---
Those that hit 1T during the blackout were:
---
1) TEST/Legacy/AOM
---
2) Goons/Imperium
---
3) PanFam/WinterCo
---
These are the ones with legitimate super umbrellas. What little guy "grouped up"?
---
&gt; yeah 1 guy in a procurer really doesn't belong in nullsec 
---
I disagree.  One procurer in null sec could be your worst nightmare, just depends which alliance it belongs to.
---
This features in the ‘It’s about goddamn time’

AND

‘Jesus fucking christ on a pogo stick almighty that looks fan-fucking-tastic'

category of visuals at the same time.

What a beautiful tribute to our fallen comrades.
---
HELP
---
YEWARRRR HARR HARR HARR
---
let me drop my super on yourrr frigit harrrr harrr harrr why cant i kill this rifter with my superr carRRIRRORR NOWW Ccp  WWAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!
---
Don't you dare talk about my local like that. It is a place to make friends!
---
Stand down to SHITPOST Condition 3, that is all...
---
Thank fuckin God/Hilmar
---
Your head must be shaped like a deflated football i swear
---
Hahaha
---
I'm sad 😒
---
HAAARRR HARRR HARRRRR 
---
WHAT aboUT the knoubmersss for Crabbainggg Got to make da Iskaass!!! 
---
no reals number usealssssss!
---
This, so much this. @CCP PLEASE make it easy for DED runners to share their bookmarks
---
Not really, they are perfectly fine, even a little low numbers wise for a 10B capital.
---
It's the ability to multibox them completely afk that is OP. You can multibox barges, but it's not effective nor afk. (especially in Hulks)
---
OHHHH LETS MAKE A POST ABNOUT IT YEAAAAA
---
get good and kill titans no one care about some mining bardge.
---
Here's to answer your question, it's indicative metrics:
---
*  [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) 
---
* Click on player counts at 6 months.
---
* It's tanking like a rock in the last couple weeks.
---
The black out if it was delivered in limited fashion every month, I think would be excellent. It would give us more prey to kill and more bots to kill. But the way it was released, I think had unintended consequences that simply hurt both the prey and the hunter.
---
Yeah, miners/afkers ratters only had years of playing in complete safety. How dare CCP make it so they have to actively play the game instead of pushing two buttons every 30 minutes. Everyone else should "adapt or die" until it comes to the play style you enjoy, then it's just crying about it and quitting. Null needs to be dangerous, risk with good rewards. I don't think removing local completely was the answer but it was in the right direction
---
Umadbro
---
Cuz I'm salty.
---
I will miss blackout 
---
😔
---
&gt; Theres been several studies showing that if you control and have logging on even a relatively small number of nodes you can defeat the anonymity. 
---
Right, but the real question is, if you had the capability to do this; what issue would be worth admitting that you have the capability for? Use it, you lose it. The classic intelligence conundrum.
---
Unless you are worth blackmailing into service for an intelligence agency, you are probably not worth them risking the discovery of their program to even drop a dime about.
---
I think he is saying 'reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee'
---
Or a words to that effect
---
Don't let this blow your minds, but...  
---
I'm good either way, really.
---
Almost there, 350+ pounds, mobility scooter, bald on top but with back n sides in a pony tail, katana collection, is a male feminist while calling girls who don't like him sluts. Eats hotpockets. That's you're average null guy.
---
I don't find Highsec relaxing. I find it boring and a waste of time. If I'm going to achieve nothing useful, I might as well not log on at all. That is not why Highsec exists, definitely not "literally". Highsec was always meant as a starting area to get people started, although the HS metagame has evolved and mutated a hundred times since its inception. It's not where you go to chill.
---
Hell, in my opinion, you shouldn't ever go there unless you need something from Jita or a seeded blueprint or skillbook or something. Highsec itself is a far bigger problem to the game than anything we could possibly do in Null.
---
Cloakers were a thing long before blackout and they will continue to be a thing after it.
---
Don't worry bro... you wont be able to gank vnis anyways, they are obsolete now
---
IS OKAY
---
not really worth making a video of tbh
---
adapt or die
---
And I'm not gonna change shit! Because I live in highsec!
---
TIL numbers lie due to personal anecdotes.
---
Are you talking to the people that logged off instead of adapting and might log back in now that lazy intel gathering will be restored and risk will go down to nearly "absent" levels?
---
Because of more bots. Yea couldn't agree more, aye!
---
Not sure about that - less people out crabbing/mining = less targets to hunt therefore people unsub and stop plexing.   
---
On top of the fact that less people are plexing their alts for crabbing/mining therefore less plex is sold making plex drop in price so people hold off buying as it's a poor investment.
---
They weren't useless before blackout, they won't be after blackout is reverted.
---
And no, highsec doesn't exist for nullsec player to "chill" when they feel like it. Some are krabs never doing anything, but when you spend days in fleet to have your own space, you cleaned the place, put your infrastructure and your defense network up, you may have earned the right to chill a little in your own space.
---
My question was which little guy grouped up since you claimed what I said was false narrative. Then you agreed that when people create umbrellas, it makes sense and would be safer (which kinda argues FOR my statements, not against). 
---
Large alliances have the isk, the members, and the hardware to do umbrellas easier than smaller groups. In a blackout scenario, there's carebears that won't login, but that impact is more pronounced in a small group. Does this not make sense at all for you? Honest question.
---
&gt;So they will gain more ISK from selling their Plex
---
Jesus christ you're literally retarded.
---
What was your name in game?  A friend and I played and were ranked fairly high for a long stint in the beginning.  Got to play with or against just about everyone.
---
I'm for any change's that help with the health of the game!
---
Whelp, that's a bummer.  Still going to do what I do best, though. :)
---
I don't buy or sell DED sites i only run the ones i got or scanned so this doesn't affect me.
---
This is sad but true reality. God damn they are idiots.
---
Ive already stopped doing logistics for alliance after losing industrials to autistic cyno killers.. I can't justify giving these creetins free killmarks
---
Sick, now that blackout is gone, maybe my alliance mates won't be invited to random fleets and warped off of their keepstar in their titan -\_-
---
I never heard about bumping timers, what is it ?
---
they couldnt so bye
---
Clam down dude. You as mad as the crabs if not more.
---
No local was a fun experement. Probably not a great idea to have everywhere 100% of the time. Im hoping ccp are looking at ways to add in no local in other ways, eg hack a thingy and turn off local in that ststem for an hour.
---
so, the null-krabs will be logging back in?
---
Thera doesn't have local
---
iT's cAlLeD lOcAl CoNtEnT
---
HHARRRR HARRRR HAAARRR THISA IS GOLD! GOLD I TELL YOU!
---
Agree
---
are you ok?
---
Excellent looking model, I do appreciate the cyno between the pillars
---
yes you can see he is pissed what this news
---
null became so dangerous no reward was worth it, and as a result people who used to have their fun flying around killing those players lost their content as well.
---
Hey all, first video since fixing all my settings. Now with 80% more resolution!
---
I think it was v0kan, or vokan, I wasnt ranked very high and mostly played after they made it FTP
---
The adms will rise from the ashes...
---
Great mega alliances will be safe from troll entosis velators
---
I can't wait to see people online again!!
---
players =/= carebears that do nothing else and just inflate value of isk, i want the first and not the latter
---
People buy bookmarks cause they don't want to do it themselves, why kill the market?
---
Nope, just a reddit post.
---
Trying to squeeze through a wormhole but the clap of your cheeks closes it on approach cause you're dummy thicc
---
not sure if sarcastic here but I feel like it was one of those "don't you guys have phones" moments
---
&gt; no local in other ways, eg hack a thingy and turn off local in that ststem for an hour 
---
HARRR HARRRRR YOU THINK Ccp Will do some tHing! that smarrt. nooooooooo
---
but i do like the idea like drop something like the dscan blockeerrrrr
---
Yeah but 99.99% of the time people just report anyone not blue off of their local without doing anything else. Horde recently has just basically got 0 Intel because unless you see them on a gate or anything it most likely won't get reported
---
I think we all know what will happen with limited blackouts from our current experience. It will be break time for many people
---
Like I said, I don't think removing local is the answer but nor is having it up 24/7. With programs such as near2, it's an incredibly powerful tool. I don't know how you get round it and make both sides happy, I don't even know if it's possible.
---
It's probably the best compromise but from what I've read so far, the issue is technical rather than an unwelcome suggestion.
---
Yes, blame NS leaders for CCP fuck ups, and absolutely not the simple fact that its current implementation is retarded.
---
Blackout is a good tool to add danger to nullsec, but currently it is TOO dangerous for anything else than umbrella rorquals compared to the rewards.
---
Yes Nullsec has infinite anomalies and such, but with anything but a capital it takes you 25-40 min to clear one anomaly giving you 35M isk. In wormhole, the same anomaly can be clear in 45 min with 2 MJD rattlesnake for 10 times that value, but they don't respawn as fast, but you're also not forced to krab as much.
---
Why would people even try that ? Apart from losing time and/or money.
---
So yes, currently it's a shit mechanic.
---
I just resubbed 5 accounts for 2 years
---
Sad this won't be a thing anymore. Hunting just turned right back into log in traps and blue toons setting traps. Fuck bots man literally nothing else to do against them at this point
---
You're killing me laughing over here, take your upvote!
---
You can transfer a character between accounts but it costs - I think 15-20 $/EUR. There's a service on the Account Management page.
---
Character transfers don't care about account state.
---
Yes, they increased taxes to try to balance the amount of money supply in game
---
YARRRRR JUst youAVEAage everyy DAY ever shitter poster!!!!
---
**~~Everything's perfectly alright now. We're fine. We are all fine... here... now. Thank you. How're you?~~**
---
cyno that is lit for those who passed the rainbow bridge
---
Don't announce them, random days, random hours. 
---
The data exists from accidental blackouts -- cloud services were messed up so we'd have an issue once in a while. The bots died. Supers died. But the total login count was still high. 
---
People still played.
---
It is sarcasm. For all the reeeeing on here hearing like 2 or 3 people being happy about this on that announcement is fucking hilarious.
---
I think you're assuming way too much - what happened is that for every guy who made the effort to go hunt 10 carebears unsubbed their 5 alts/bots.
---
Could we just say "the big alliances got fucked and the small ones got their wallets fucked"
---
If they wanted a black out just use your gate cloak as a delay timer for local. But that would require ccp to code the game.
---
I mean.  when you’re going against maybe 5% of the playerbase
---
You definitely shouldn’t lose in terms of balance decisions.  It sounds unfair but it’s the fucking truth
---
&gt;Can someone link sauce? 
---
Do a basic search, it has been linked loads of times. You really didn't need to make a new thread about this at all.
---
Click on one of the 10 posts about it.
---
I’m sure you mean vexors good sir. Also, that’s not how I’ve been spending my time but go ahead and write a narrative that suits you’re opinion :)
---
Force recons are pretty cheap, just now you need skills to even touch one. So I won't be participating.
---
I think it's easier to turn off the switch randomly weekly.  A true blackout that made you feel safe 90% of the time, but you never know when 10% will happen -- where local is out.
---
I bet you work for skype
---
You can still cloak and hit things
---
you’ll just have to try
---
So what will happen with "personal" bookmarks?
---
Like a great many others, I have many thousands of them, I understand that they will no longer be an item as such so wondering if the personal stash and access of will remain the same as prior to the change?
---
I hear so much of this near2 thing you would think it's a rampant problem in every null system. 
---
I've been around a long time. Many corps many alliances more than a decade of playing and I've never once seen this thing. Reading about it is pretty silly
---
what's the point of the CSM if CCP can just say fuck all and implement these changes?
---
beautiful piece of work
---
Lmao imma log in and buy before it becomes 2 bil again.
---
New idea:
---
If you activate a cloak, you will vanish from local.
---
Lol at risk when you had a cyno on every ship and hundreds of people in fleet ready to jump.
---
The smaller entities were already dying and the powerblocs getting even strong *long* before blackout.
---
If not feeding ridiculously strong metas of frigates billions in ships with no objective advantage is being a “fucking coward”
---
Then i can only imagine what people who won’t risk 1/100th that cost without all the advantages must be in your eyes ;)
---
remove blackout = local back.. no  local = blackout so technically nullsec was same as wh
---
I've been having loads of fun doing various things during blackout. I'm happy it's done because now activity levels will return
---
I've been in almost all the major null blocks, they all use it and it's actively encouraged in most. You're either talking shite or you're just oblivious to what happens around you.
---
It's a cascading effect and you can see that even before WoW Classic. I actually have never played WoW, but I did start playing Age of Empires again when it was hard to find targets in null. 
---
Yes, it's actually easier to find PVP now in Age of Empires 2 HD than in EVE.
---
So the salting begins early, with denial
---
You're making no sense. WH and thera remain no local. Are you high?
---
LMAO
---
No, what almost went off a cliff was your retarded goon end-gameplay. not the game "we all love"
---
In a properly liquid market, that should be reflected in the price point.
---
Yet you assume all I’m doing is killing vexors? Ok bud. Activity will return sure, I suspect a lot of it will be bots, as for players that quit - a lot of them seem too jaded with the game in general so I guess we’ll see.
---
yes but imagine  suddenly wormholes gain local
---
Maybe that's why. I haven't been part of any newbro centric entities. I've never seen this thing at all so its very foreign and suspicious when people scream and cry about something that at my time spent in this game, I've not once seen.
---
It's silly
---
No
---
TLDR behind ccp decision?
---
Don't Triglavian conduits open with a big ass animation and sound when unlocked?
---
Or does the one in the special pocket behave differently?
---
they will not  rollback cyno changes
---
I had two accounts with only 1 Rorqual so fuck off cunt
---
Amen. Would require u/ccp to get off their fat ass and code the game instead of just turning a switch.
---
I wonder why this got downvotes, this is exactly what's gonna happen. Moreso a lot of people that stayed despite wow classic release because of the blackout will leave now too.
---
Last year TEST kicked me 4 days after re-subbing for exploring. Roughly 5-6 years in TEST with a hiatus. No reason given, just sent me a bunch of "krab" emotes in discord.
---
I think the blackout is great. So many hypocrites that act like they hate krabbing until they personally have problems.
---
Those damn bots touched you somewhere huh?
---
just for one day
---
lol, ok son.
---
sounds like just local.
---
I love the blackout. 
---
Instead make a local corp chat window.
---
So create a game that has glitches built into it. Great idea
---
CCP is clearly making a mistake. It is bots/students/alts/insert excuse not logging in.
---
HARRR HARRRRR HAAARRRRR! 
---
yea I DO to lIKE where this is gooing!!!
---
I want to have your messy abortion!
---
Where he is wrong is saying the fault also lies in the playerbase, which only used what CCP put in tranquility without even listening to any feedback from that same playerbase.
---
In a game where production and mining in rorqual is the most effective and in a game where you have enemies that can hurt you and evict your alliance, you HAVE to adapt and do the same.
---
Great job, guy you killed is obviously a complete dunce. Shame you didn’t get the nyx aswell.
---
That's fair enough but it's a very real problem. Not sure if you understand how it works but you open the program and it pulls information from the intel channels you have open in game. Then alerts you when an enemy has been called out X jumps away (you set how many).
---
Bots never actually stopped, real players did.
---
Because it's too safe of a way of someone acquiring isk in a way that I'm totally unable to come and steal
---
Are you gonna play on an RP server as goon?
---
Market chaos! ITS OUT OF CONTROL! Shut it down!
---
Makes sense. Couldn’t adapt to blackout, RRREEEE’d on reddit about it daily, and can’t do a simple reddit search.
---
These are the people CCP are catering to
---
Sorry but I'm not your son. Thanks.
---
Ok, kid. You do release bots hurt the entire economy right, or did that not cross your brain, ya fanny.
---
:p
---
Corp and alliance chat do as much to make the game feel populated as Jabber and Discord. That is, they don't. People in local *are there around you*.
---
&gt; So create a game that has glitches built into it. Great idea 
---
EVE is already full of glitches, e.g. brain in a box. What game have you been playing? :)
---
Randomizers are part of any game. My idea is to add more risk to null but in a random fashion and makes residents feel safe most of the time. A balanced approach that gives hunters a healthy population. Decimating carebears in one shot makes no sense from a PVP aspect. 
---
Doing it in a "sustainable" fashion allows prey to regrow, buy new ships, so you can kill them again.
---
No, he's just following me around posting garbage because he's mega butt blasted and genuinely believes that CCP only ever listens to /r/eve, which couldn't be further from the truth.
---
&gt;Oddly enough living in WH space isn't anywhere near as popular as nullsec
---
only because people are scared of the logistics, it has almost nothing to do with local blackout
---
or AFK.
---
You mean a mobile scan inhibitor? It already exists dude.
---
But Rote was doing so well against darkness. (In before i get flair baited)
---
Adapt or die
---
A game that is never released, stuck forever in a production cycle until it is shelved forever.
---
That sucks blackout was goood
---
Save this image for the cloaking countermeasures coming in November
---
Interesting piece of software than. However if it depends soley on other players reporting hostiles in intel channel then it doesn't really unsettle me much as anyone is fully able to read their intel channel at any point in time
---
It sounds like it takes lazy to a whole new level
---
Well that sucks blackout was good
---
They had the time to do this but it's sounding like it'll straight up be cancelled. Sad that they couldn't find something in between.
---
Goons just used facts, data, and logic. The Ben Shapiros of EVE won again.
---
JF to covert cynos, that's all we need atm
---
Shame blackout made the game so much more fun
---
I would go as far as to say that the real problem is not with Rorquals, but the fact that skill injectors make it far too easy for any one person to get all of their alts into them.
---
Ah yes.  The teams of bot myrms because aloha accounts were the only way to plex with them in blackout using their teams of alpha pods on gates.  
---
You...want that? 
---
It’s less human players, more “accounts” logged in, less subs... it’s losses all around
---
Well as with enigma they often arranged recon sorties so they could point to the plane having spotted troop movements.            
---
Say you pick up on drug or gun sales, you have the method nailed down so arrange a buy sting operation and you never have to disclose the method that pointed you there.
---
Like farm animals. I like where this is going 😁
---
well at least we got the cyno changes
---
PVPers got gaypwned by themselves, more at 11
---
Several security research groups have developed both theoretical and mathematically sound, and also practical attacks for deanonymizing tor traffic.  There was a Canadian security team that were able to use timing attacks to trace the entry node a user came from.  This one is from 4 years ago when there was a big push for this kind of stuff: https://www.usenix.org/node/190967
---
Here's a more recent overview of several attacks with sound principles:
---
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Speculative_Tor_Attacks
---
Here a new article about Russia developing it's own tor deanonymization tech:
---
https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/07/22/bbc-russia-is-working-on-a-tor-de-anonymization-project/
---
While there are several attacks against tor, the one that get people a lot are server and client misconfigurations. Real IP bleed either from server or client... also when FBI or CIA do huge stings like horrible CP sites they have used actual zero days in the tor browser client bundle (firefox) which makes them go to a beacon under FBI or CIA control, thereby deanonymizing themselves, so tor attacks can be internal: tor or external: the tor browser bundle itself, without ever doing anything with the tor traffic. 
---
Fortunately tor is being actively hardened and overseen by its governing project body.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)
---
Hope this helps lol...love reading this stuff too.
---
Ah yes.  The bots
---
That definitely quit and not the real players yes
---
Think of the bots ... and ignore the ones that stayed of cooourse
---
Unlike the apparent elite Pvpers who were whining daily prior to black out because they were too shit to manage to catch ratters?
---
If you are not in big corp (Goons, test) its almost impossible to make a good living in null. If its not worth lining in null people will leave. If people leave you wont have many targets for your fun. The no local will come to bite you back when you will have no targets to shoot.
---
Eh... what?
---
The enemies don't have scram or warp disruption, so anything that can survive for a bit, like a battlecruiser, will do okay. Worst case, you warp out. Also, land in -after- the enemies have spawned and have targeted the first person into the site. Usually the enemies die before they can run you off. Just my 2 cents. I run it in a Gila and am barely targeted, if ever
---
I mean, fundamentally I have nothing to "prove" to you and I'm not going to get into a pissing contest with you on /r/eve.
---
If you want to believe that we only listen to /r/eve when it comes to community feedback, feel free to do so.
---
On one point we agree - stagnation is bad and we're trying different ways to shake things up. Whether you agree with the changes or not is your prerogative.

#resubbing 2 accounts
---
Thanks! And we could have gotten the nyx and other rorqs if we had more inhibs. The nyx pilot was on point with taking them down.
---
As for my specs:
---
Intel i7 8700K
---
Nvidia GTX 1070 FTW 2
---
16 GB Corsair Vengeance LPX
---
It's been handling perfect in large fights at 1080p res and 60 fps
---
Good. Now roll back cyno changes yah assholes.
---
&gt; If you have a BB fleet in your system, your only option is to dock up and wait them out or die; 
---
That is why they call em Iron Cannons, because they have so much tank you could never destroy them by docking up your blingy anom runner and undocking a cheap destroyer with sebos.
---
Yup, we have access to data related to EVE, believe it or not.
---
They are useless in that they don't contribute to eve other than making the people who own them lots of big toys and inflating the economy.  I'm obviously over generalising. I should be specifying the people who left the game because blackout made their mining/ratting too risky.
---
If you left the game because you don't like risk then IMO the game was better off for you being gone.
---
i  would  like to see it to happen
---
Parallel construction
---
Why the fuck do people think frigates should be untouchable

Yeah exactly, as you can imagine the larger null blocks where everything is reported you have enough time to dock up in the majority of situations. People should have to watch intel channels, not have a program do it for them. It's incredibly lazy. I don't blame them for using it, it's a super powerful tool and you'd be silly not too. I blame CCP for allowing it in the first place.
---
No, I'm not.
---
I'm rolling my eyes at the guy who I replied to who's angry posting on /r/eve.
---
I was literally sat down with Innominate during the summit, chatting and drinking with him - he's an awesome guy with an INCREDIBLE amount of knowledge on EVE who I have huge respect for.
---
Stop now
---
he didnt share me any fits so asking there thinking  about using barghest as i have  rusty one  never used. eventually can buy  rattlesnake if that matters.. im new to these triglavian craps
---
no ragrets
---
What the fuck you guys have no clues talking about. Black out isn't hurting Goons that much, it's the small alliance suffering the most. Ironically Goons is the one benefiting from the current situation since being able to utilize their space wider range and with longer hours they are pulling even further ahead.
---
This post is about a shitshow that arose by those in power pandering to a vocal minority. Please take your entirely unrelated issue elsewhere.
---
is there a source for those?
---
Lol wait until the krabs complain
---
Then lets see how strong their backbone is
---
They specifically looked at the data.
---
Bots didn’t quit... so changing risk vs reward would fuck over human players even more , which (beyond the edgelords screeching) is not the goal.
---
Bots getting more, players earning less... that’s a god awful idea from ANY perspective beyond “REEEE MY FRIGATES SHOULD KILL MORE REEEEEEEEE DONT MAKE ME TRY OR FARM REEEE”
---
Cheers for that
---
They had to be in space ratting to get the escalation, go fly to it to bookmark it, sell it in a limited window. Then escalation runners have to move around in space to run escalations, and combat recon videos vs escalation runners around suggest they're not invulnerable inside their deadapace.
---
;)
---
Remove the beer goggles!
---
NotaGoonbtw
---
The alpha accounts botting en masse aren’t exactly money makers for ccp
---
So... yeah
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Blackout is a good tool to add danger to nullsec, but currently it is TOO dangerous for anything else than umbrella rorquals compared to the rewards.
---
Funny. I made as much mining in barges as I ever had. You see, they had to find me, too. Dscanning every few minutes kept me down to two losses in the entire blackout. Two more than before but well within an acceptable range. Maybe you did it wrong or didn't even try?
---
My informal survey a couple weeks ago suggests the latter. Most people who complained about it being too dangerous had avoided PVE entirely.
---
God forbid your billionmaking activity provides some 1 million isk killmails to people who are desperate to kill anything
---
Just think of it..
---
Signal Cartel Bookmark List with public Wormhole Connections everywhere!
---
You are right,blackout is over in Monday,plex will skyrocket in isk so you can have more fun for euro in EVE
---
If only ccp weren't totally retarded, then we could get things like default skins, station interior skins, citadel skins. This is literally "shut up and take my money" stuff, some of which would require almost no coding or new art to put ingame, and they don't do it.
---
WEST VIRGINIA
---
Upvoted amazing satire
---
&gt; Besides I use T1 frigs nothing fancier than Navy Faction.
---
My man.
---
Welp congrats krabs you won. Can go back to docking as soon as a neutral hits local 9 jumps away.
---
Have a upvote
---
that's an oxymoron
---
AHAHAHAH
---
Certain goon members produced "third world country mines excavated by armies of prisoner of war slaves and forced child labor for an evil warlord serving as the arch-villain in an Indiana Jones film" levels of salt during this time.
---
But no, this thread surpasses that. Get serious, lol.
---
IM HAPPY AS FUCK!!!
---
Incoming posts about the cyno changes being bad for the little guy but neutral for big blocs...
---
"we're goons bitches after all"
---
YAARRR THAT THING But FOR LIKE the local Chat
---
God forbid I have to fill my cargo hold with replacement 20,000m3 ships so I can replace my cynos because some total troll finds entertainment in shooting them with his t1 fit tornado
---
What ridiculous change, you guys need to get your heads checked or lay off the crack cocaine
---
&gt; It was below 800m for a month worth of PLEX
---
For perspective, in 2009, it was 300 million isk for Plex.
---
It's not just the people living in wormholes that farm them. There's a lot of entities in k-space that have alt farming holes they use for making ISK. That's the part that everyone conveniently leaves out. It's more than the few groups people think of when they think of wormholes.
---
they said the same about the blackout so...
---
such a bad call...
---
So any guesses until cyno changes are reversed ?
---
I think Eve is in a critical state with current player numbers. So, no, blackout was bad as it made people to less inclined to play. Any action that makes player numbers bleed is bad at the current state of the game.
---
Eh that was the idea of ccp until every retard flamed them for it so they canceled it. So JF pilots fucked themselfes.
---
Well they are ending it; TFG...
---
Its hard to make it against the rules without finally turning off fucking clientside chatlogging
---
Where?
---
Discord is a free speech (mostly) platform which was originally their defence
---
So the red alert do not crab until we find a solution ping is benefitting them? ok
---
Personally,  i don't really care either way because i only go to nullsec occasionally on NPSI roams,  i've seen it empty before the blackout too and it's not interesting enough anymore to live there full time with the way things have been the last few years (not to mention the kind of culture that has taken root).
---
If you nullsec guys want to fuck your game to the point where you have nothing to do and your activities become worthless from over-farming and market oversupply, it's your choice.
---
It's just too bad this fucks up the rest of the game though by trashing the economy, but i'm not really impacted either because my main income source is trading. As long as there is a margin between buy and sell, it doesn't really matter to me if the stuff you farm ends up selling for 10 million isk instead of 100.
---
It's the new guys that will get shit on the most because they are the ones who will have to do some mining or similar in the beginning, only to find out their income source is worthless because of the crybabies who wanted to multibox rorqs in total safety. This will push the to join these exact groups and become yet another generation that adds to the problem, or quit the game.
---
But apparently that doesn't cut into the player numbers or retention, because it's bad for the bloc narrative, lol.
---
lost count of the amount of posts and comments from people here, when blackout was initially put in, with dudes saying blackouts here to stay and they wont roll back on it, yet here we are.
---

---
Won't anybody think about the poor DED runners ;(
---
Strange that they were the ones whining the most on reddit though.
---
no i will never stop. we should have local in thera
---
Local chat in null is super toxic for PvPers and kills the gameplay.
---
No Local chat in null is toxic because it lets cloaky ships hunt with absolute impunity and zero counterplay.
---
What's the solution, then?
---
supercarrier/titan ratting will be again cancer and eve-kill
---
proof
---
Well CCP can go fuck them selfs.
---
Back in the day /u/grathtelkin made a great argument for this. The idea was simple. Actual delayed local in the sense that you didn’t appear in local for the duration of the session change or until you decloak yourself, giving the hunter time to acquire a target via dscan and warp.
---
no reversal of cyno changes
---
Why do supers apply more dps to a frigate than a polarized daredevil at 0.
---
Which ping? The one send by PH, TEST or goons about no super ratting for a week while you can still mine away?
---
Stationtrading is totally safe (if you're vigilant about your zeroes) and a good trader doesn't let him get undercut needlessly.  Bookmarketing is far from dangerous, but not 100% safe either.
---
This guy gets it
---
How are new people commemorated?
---
I loved the idea that the old memorial was one of few places that had special programming to prevent anchored container cleanup, but this is stunning and I will visit it at some point.
---
Didn’t init do this to A keepstar a year ago?
---
If this happens, maybe pvpers will actually try to win instead of use harassing annoyance as “warfare” and demanding balance around it
---
Temporary and indefinite are two different things.
---
I always figured this is what highsec people were like.
---
All you need to safely krab in a capital is a pilgrim cloaked 30km off your carrier/super/Rorq...
---
But it'll just hurt the little guy, as every nullblob member likes to remind us, even as they never suggest how to actually *help* the little guy they never seem to want to be.
---
It would be experiment if it lasted for 2 weeks...
---
They should have had Below the Asteroids looping in null to cheer people up and encourage them to undock.
---
Ssshhh, we don't need to punch down when CCP is doing our jobs for us.
---
Im on the fence still. It doesn't really feel game breaking, however I could see how it may annoy people. It just seems like a very redundant tool to me when it's fully dependant on available intel already.
---
Lol backbone
---
Hilmar is an absolute mushbrain. He basically stumbled into lightning in a bottle 16 years ago and has been doing everything he can to fuck it up ever since.
---
And you know who else is having a red alert do not crab until we find a solution ping? The fucking rest of the eve. And if there is ever going to be a solution Goons will be the best to implement it simply because of their sheer member counts and their superior supercapital fleet presence .
---
I've been station trading and leveraging item prices for many years...  I know how safe it is 😀
---
Yeah that was my first thought, is there a place to add names or something?  Or do containers stay, and this just replaces the POS as the title says?
---
Lol like you guys are going to do anything about it
---
Uh oh, watch out we got some badass nullbear here
---
Perfect intel letting everyone in the region know when to dock up?  Yeah fuck off dude.
---
This is a claim I haven't really heard before. I was with /u/meha_tar when I got into FW for the fights: I figured if I stayed neutral, I'd have twice as many people I could shoot. I don't need the income, I don't care about the security hits, I just want as many fun frigate fights as possible every time I log in.
---
Would you be willing to elaborate a bit on what you're saying? When I fly through FW space (ustz), it generally is dead. If you see people online outside of main systems where a group lives or a place like amamake or tama, those people are afk and docked up, or they're botters/farmers in an unfit whatever and warp next door and start a new plex the instant you appear on 1 au dscan or overview. Are you telling me if I start flying a militia's colors and fly through contested space, there's suddenly going to be people coming out of the woodwork to fight me? I thought the reward for killing someone in a novice is pretty insignificant. I thought the effect of a single dude trying to oplex was really minimal (and therefore wouldn't stir up the hornet's nest). I assume people wanting to kill me for being in their space as an enemy militia might be less inclined to bring a "good fight" and would be happy just chasing me away with a fucking worm or something. Etc.
---
I'm beginning to suspect that CCP never had any intent on looking for ways to improve the way local works and were just whoring the press and the short term subs that came with it.
---
If they said blackout was ending but now we'd have a short delay that'd be one thing but not making any lasting changes after collecting whatever data they said they were collecting suggests they weren't that interested in changes anyway.
---
So Eve will continue to be made easier and safer.

---
So I was thinking "I wonder if Francis responded" and what is the fastest way to find it on mobile. Turns out scanning for the longest post was both accurate and timely.
---
Maybe the intention was to reduce the amount of isk flowing into the game, which caused the proliferation of capitals, supers, and titans? Maybe you not printing isk daily is the intended result? Perhaps you're not supposed to run sites and make hundreds of millions, if not billions, of isk a day?
---
I don't even live in the affected area. I live in lowsec. I can't imagine being scared to undock just because I don't know the people in system. On the contrary, I generally know very well the people in system, and I know they're hunters, and they're not friendly to me at all. Sometimes, I have to fight for my sites, or I have to watch them get taken from me. It's life. In my 6 years of playing, I've never been in a position where I can simply sit in a system and be 100% sure I was entirely safe. I've never had SRP, and have had to fund my own ships myself, outside of a few perks of being a corp director.
---
I pay monthly (yearly, actually) for my account, but I could just as easily spend a day, maybe two, three if I'm unlucky, in lowsec and earn enough isk to buy the plex I need for another month.
---
Well eve is a game that many people like me pre plan months and even years ahead but with what they did this past few months made it untrusworthy to spend time in it. Even if they restore local my trust in the developers and game health is gone. I am a fairly new player compared to the game history. I started  playing about 2 years ago. I feel uncofortable of trusting them anymore and spending any money in the game. My accounts are about to go to alpha and i dont feel like renewing my subscriptions. Everybody has their way of enjoying the game but i have seen some salty behavior on players being happy on other players not ejoying the game how they bought in it. I hope the game grows strong in time however it will take some before they get my trust back.
---
When you initiate warp there is now a 3min timer after which you will enter warp regardless.         
---
So if you undock and immediately hit warp to a site behind the station and bounce off the structure you can still eventually get into warp.
---
Harassment is one of the few things keeping mega-empires from over-extending, swallowing the entire map and ending with the same result as the chinese server (game dies because of nothing left to do).
---
The reason people don't do standup fights more often is that they get dropped by capitals too much, so the natural choice is "take something with good dps that can run away if they decide to overdo it".
---
Sorry to break this to you, but if cloaks get nerfed people will just use smaller, cheaper and faster ships to get to you instead of their T3Cs. So it will be mostly the same thing, except they'll also lose less money when they die. We didn't always have combat ships with cloaks. We still roamed just fine. Now that not every single thing around can fit a cyno (and the things that do are juicy 200-300mil killmails) this style of roaming could make a comeback.
---
Agree. Don't be so dramatic with change.
---
Delay local by a few seconds.
---
I like cyno changes, makes it a little more difficult to save caps.
---
Remove bosons, they just fry everything using gates.
---
Diminish resources as they farmed. The harder they farmed the thinner they are found by region.
---
That is very true.
---
Me? Not even close.
---
I just like a good shitpost
---
The same day I hear blackout is ending, I needed this.  I... It's just so beautiful!
---
Same here, op.
---
People who pay for Plex enjoy the game more, last longer, are less risk averse and are usually the hunter.
---
&gt; SPVG is 99% pvp corp
---
I'd pay for access to something like that
---
Blue Ridge Mountains
---
* blackout comes: 50% salt 50% happy
---
* blackout ends: 30% happy 50% salt 20% indifferent because they quit
---
They got a buff, they are the only ones bringing in a dread bomb now
---
Hoping with the data they now have they will build a more balanced solution.
---
Apparently the initiative is a refugee camp for dirty old men.
---
Who knew.
---
Yes and after blackout nullsec regions except Delve suddenly vanished from the MER completely. Totally nothing to do with the blackout of course...
---
Mixed feelings about this. When blackout hit, I stopped VNI ratting (I don't own any capitals, and I'm a space poor), and just joined a few alliance fleets for a while. After a while I just kind of stopped logging on. Perhaps I am too risk averse. Then a guy from my corp reached out to check I was ok, and I've got back into the game, focusing on exploration, which has actually been a lot more interesting than doing anoms.
---
Still, if removing blackout brings people back to the game, then I'm happy. The player counts did look quite worrying to me, and I really don't want EVE to die. It's a good thing that CCP are willing to try these experiments, and I'll do my best to HTFU and enjoy the game for as long as I'm able.
---
fam im not trawling through hundreds of posts to find the times people said it, take my word for it or don't its no skin off my nose
---
Unless you flair baiting, wormholers shouldn't open their mouths when talking about risk. Oh, just let me role all the incoming holes and rat in my dread... You cant get more risk adverse than that.
---
grr goons hat goons
---
Well, it will suck to buy them with no possible system for it.
---
Ask them to add that feature and they will think it's a great idea because they can then keep the scam going longer
---
"players" 
---
those hardcore VNI pilots
---
Im unsure if 'they' are official CCP representatives.
---
Discord is such a piece of shit. This enough to convince anyone that the discord admins have no fucking clue and it's time to switch?
---
No? Fuck.
---
Hmm, i can see merit in your points as well. Now i'm confused, lol.
---
Honestly, this is exactly one of the reasons i want to see asset safety gone, it's such a pain to balance properly.
---
You all know deep down this is something that is good for the game, it’s not the perfect solution however it is better than the current implementation of local.
---
Yep. The permanence of standing and security hits is absurd. Not wanting to fuckup standings is one of the main reasons to not want to join a militia. 
---
When a player leaves FW, standings and sec status should be reset to what the player had before joining. Or just don’t mess with standings and security status and restrict highsec system access by militia rank. 
---
Why CCP insists to implement a punitive rule to discourage players to join FW is beyond me. Maybe it’s because they try to justify the notion of lowsec when it should just be: high-sec, militarized zone, null-sec. Period.
---
Maybe you're confusing calling a retarded change a retarded change with whining. And the August MER shows exactly what the blackout was: a retarded change.
---
Can I have you stuff?
---
I would think that Signal Cartel would be a bit careful with that if they don't want to become KOS for wh corps.
---
Out of the three things you listed, blackout didnt affect any of them. There was even more stagnation with no reason to fight. Skill injectors are still broken and should be deleted or heavily restricted. Supers actually got cheaper because people were firesaling. Buybacks stopped buying ore. Hardly anyone was putting caps into build because most people already got their caps in the last three years of CCP's shit mechanics. Blackout was a band aid fix. They need to fix the real problems.
---
Sc is a scam; the last game their ceo worked on crashed and burned because (he admitted on the record) that his constant feature creep outstripped the budget.
---
Now he has scammed millions in to providing him money EVERY FUCKING MONTH without delivering a working game... FOR YEARS..
---
Why? Because again feature creep. Smh

Gonna go out on a limb here and say actual child porn us a bigger issue than weird drawings, so they'd deal with it.

I been liking this fit (the lows switch from drone damage amps to more PDA for more tank and more cap recharge to help keep shield hardeners on.) It tanked roughly 12-14mill dmg in around 80 seconds.

Old fit, OH'ed it tanked like 190k DPS with drugs.
---
Also don't mind the est value in the video, I had tons of excavators in cargo as well as many different fits I was fucking around with. it is more like 6-7 bill for the fit+hull.
---
Noooooooooooo!
---
Yeah I think CCP’s point here is that they didn’t actually intend for the PCU to pick the “die” option.
---
I beg you please dont delete this post again I need the karma for my children
---
No they didn't.
---
The point basically was to try and fix inflation in the economy which was rising due to botting which used local as a way to trigger warp to station.
---
However, like many economies everywhere, eve has learned that it's a tricky beast and fixing one thing can make something else much worse.
---
Fuck knows how many players they have lost to wow since the blackout started and classic launched.
---
No there was plenty of whining.
---
I hope they aren’t
---
Yes. And now 5 min after the end of blackout announced, it increased in 700m. Welcome back to Serenity 2.0
---
Completely agree with this. I did really miss seeing who was actually around. I guess I could have just sat on a gate and waited though :)
---
It takes time to adapt. CCP didn't have the nerve, I guess.
---
Starting on Monday, null will be utterly predictable and perfect intel will yet again be easily attainable for the mighty alliances. Actually, it is so boring.
---
Local cloaking jammer.
---
We're with you, bud
---
So in your first post you care about inflation, in your second post you don't?

---
I stopped playing about 3 years ago after FCing and leading, as well as following. On good terms, the spark of the game was just gone. 
---
Decided to check out this sub yesterday to see how things are going, and I am sad to see the sorry state this sub and game is in. Black out almost enticed me to come back since that brought some of that magic back. 
---
I just don't see things improving regardless of what CCP does until the back bone of eve is addressed, isk making. The mechanics of acquiring it are braindead, only a bot could put up with, or whales with a massive investment of time and/or real money. 
---
This is why Blackout failed. Null is not rewarding enough for the time needed to gain worthwhile isk. The more time you invest undocked in nullsec, the riskier it gets, but the reward is not worth it.
---
God forbid your alliance need to invest time into protecting their supply lines, instead of having near instant access to markets and a practically risk-free highway straight from Jita/wherever to your doorstep. God forbid you can't everything and the kitchen sink into your JF. God forbid you have to make another run.
---
Maybe you get a buddy/alt to protect your cyno ship? No, that'd be too much effort. Better to complain until it gets "fixed". That's easier.
---
I pay real money for yearly subs, nothing else.
---
Why don't you do something about it? Bitch.
---
And see personally even though I'm in a corp I rarely fly with my corp mates, I like doing my own thing and just cool people to chat with.

But as per above they'd rather led a paedophile go free than reveal how in count.
---
You should read the Post Dunk Dinkel made about the CSM before posting about it
---
&gt; Diminish resources as they farmed. The harder they farmed the thinner they are found by region. 
---
Yeah it really doesn't make sense that pirate factions, seeing their forces getting crushed by supers/titans, would keep sending more and more ships to high adm systems. 
---
Anything that can make large alliances have to spread out in more than a single region is good in my book. That's the nerf to super umbrellas we need.
---
Hooray. +1 for more chains and targets
---
Go fuck yourself CCP!
---
Let's just agree that there was plenty of what you perceive as whining. I'll let everyone judge by themselves if that has any value.
---
Cauliflower dick
---
Check the flair
---
Having it so you only appeared in Local after breaking gate/WH cloak would have been ideal but is probably too hard for them to implement so they went full blackout (or not).
---
So, you're saying a ruble isn't real money?
---
CCP doubled transaction tax but the sink for transaction tax increased only by 50%. Second indicator is isk velocity. [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/6PvRxBHrr2xsOqTLXDhLWt/4494ca35cdf85a3e2003eb257415d5e7/9c\_velocity.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/6PvRxBHrr2xsOqTLXDhLWt/4494ca35cdf85a3e2003eb257415d5e7/9c_velocity.png)
---
And it was annoying trying to fight a war in null when you had to clone jump to hisec every other day for timers. Even with deathclones and jump clones, everyone was getting tired of hisec ferox tidi fights.
---
New people are added to the cemetery by simply coming in and making a jetcan around the structure and naming it with the capsuleer's name on it. Nothing has changed or is supposed to change with this as I understand.
---
AFAIK There wasn't any special programming there. The Cemetery is based around an old POS Command tower, and any container within a certain area of it will stay around as long as the tower is still there (it has been attacked in the past and has had to be rebuilt)
---
The monument (incase its not in the clip) is simply replacing the old command tower with the new monument. CCP is looking to completely remove POSs from the game, so this was partially to save the cemetery (as the cans would despawn without it) and to upgrade the POS into a more proper display for the setting.
---
LOL
---
but now panfam are in on it!
---
Was fun while it lasted. I guess it was silly to assume it was going to be permanent. One thing I sincerely hope for is that the people that left because of the blackout don't come back.
---
We're still in FW, and as Wit mentioned, we're enjoying a little bit of both worlds at the moment.  Definitely still active in lowsec though.  :)
---
If you have 12 rorqs, unsub 10.  If you're a botter, wait it out or move to ventures in high sec.
---
Of course player count dropped.
---
I'd be more interested to see paid subscription count.
---
WTS thera bm list.. you totaly will not warp in to random smartbomb fleet /s
---
Anyone supposed to believe this?
---
Looking how that Discord had racist and other awful shit when I joined and CCP devs bailing on it early cause of the awful crap. I say its a feature of the server.
---
they wont show you that, that's why I said indicative above
---
Hey, will you come back to the game just because some internet warriors yelled "coward"? 
---
If anything it further cemented the notion that it was right for me to take a break from this toxic community.
---
System not region. 
---
Anything beyond that is social interaction, and fuck me we can't be social in an mmo now can we?
---
Daily reminder ur posts are shit and u should stop posting
---
You forgot to mention they we're trying "something new" with their Rorquals
---
It was Sarcasm
---
Doesn't really make a difference.  We'd move intel channels to discord and do it there.
---
It'd be a pretty easy software change.
---
Access list controls and expiration for bookmarks are awesome. Hats off to CCP.
---
I'm going to miss being able to make bookmarks into items though.
---
* Leaving cans in space with bookmarks was fun for treasure hunts.  
---
* I typically use bookmarks as jettison fodder when I need to make a can, as they take up 0m3 and can be created on the fly. Admittedly this is pretty niche edge case and solvable by bringing along some cheap ammo, but I've been in numerous fights in the past where I had an empty cargo hold and being able to drop a can for others not in my fleet to have an instant warpin made all the difference. I'll miss them, especially on my more cargo constrained fits.

* Selling escalations will be a bit awkward though. Gonna have to make a bunch of one item lists.

Just for clarity, we will still have the ability to copy paste bookmarks from a list that's been shared with us to our personal list right?

Awesome to hear )
---
Eve dying was inevitable with citadels, injectors, and cap changes. This is just CCP desperately trying to keep their only income stream afloat without actually understanding how they killed it.
---
We could be heroes?
---
I run them in a t2 fit drekavac, no need to warp out and salvage while killing.
---
Added an Ishtar today to speed things up.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Fait in CCP slightly restored. Until next week when they announce another major fuck up!
---
Beautiful. 👌
---
The logistics also make it hard for huge groups to bring in massive fleets quickly. It gives smaller groups a chance to actually exist, especially in C3 and below holes. I think that’s why WH life appeals to smaller groups overall. 
---
I’m never going to be completely convinced blackout didn’t have more to do with CCP fucking up the chat system and making it completely unreliable than it did gameplay. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.

Huge respect to the founder of the Cemetary and her team, Azia Burgi. Amazed she hasn't been mentioned already.

It’s not that it is too hard for them. It is they are choosing to take the easy way out when The easy way in EVE always ends in disaster.
---
daily reminder, players playing the game are killing the game.
---
legit
---
They could have done something more interesting with it. Like an Observatory structure that gives local but can be easily jammed/destroyed. Or an option to show yourself to alliances members/people with a certain standing. 
---
Blackout wasn't the thing that drove me to take a break, but cyno changes and more importantly, this sub's toxicity. I just recongised how much saltier this community is than other gaming communities, even ones like /r/leagueoflegends. That, and the fact that almost all my friends in game are on a break just killed my motivation to even log in.
---
Pepega
---
NO. Shush. Blackout completely fixed botting! Stop ruining it!
---
 *\* R4dio4ct1v3 starts mumbling under his breath: "blackout fixed botting... blackout fixed botting... blackout fixed botting... blackout fixed botting... blackout fixed botting..."*
---
Shhhhh adults are playing
---
The terrifying thing was we knew the black out would cause a drop in the pcu. We saw this when local broke. 
---
Yet ccp went ahead with it anyway. Yet people seemed in denial when the completely predictable happened.
---
Jesus Christ. It was 1.2bil when I quit. It was 400m when I started. Has inflation gotten that bad in a year?
---
Why delete comment wuss
---
It's absolute cancer trash for anybody who does jump freighting
---
An Indy is 20k m3 and they provide a free kill mark to every autistic low sec scrub that ever flew a tornado.
---
You do the math.
---
Well I'm not so sure... afterall it seems that people will only need to cry hard about it and ccp will reverses the changes...
---
You mean jamming the ability to cloak in null or displaying the names of cloaked ships in null?
---
It hit 2.3 bil pretty sure
---
scam citizen you mean
---
Wait, people are playing the game?!?!?! I thought login count was down?!? Stats, bar graphs and but the slope?!?
---
Lol I didnt expect it to.
---
Idk man, for me its just that constantly mashing V and still possibly getting screwed by cloaks made the game tedious enough to not be worth it.
---
CSM shill

Nicely done!
---
One question, why are Porpoise and Orca listed under freighters  [https://evekill.club/freighters/](https://evekill.club/freighters/) ?
---
Ton of alts in the corp. But you have to manually go somewhere to make a copy instead of just linking it like they said today. Good for small groups having alts, not so much for an entire corp operations.
---
Creates an alliance name to taunt all tree groups, gets salty when all three turn up to shit on you?!
---
What would that do? You can't take any actions while cloaked so do you gain anytime?
---
&gt; everyone who just pussied out and logged off  
---
pay my sub, and I will log in
---
Dunno - i might have copied the wrong list of IDs from somewhere :D
---
I'll drop it as an issue and fix it soon :)
---
And skill injectors. With so many people extracting all of their rorqual/super/capital skills from blackout, they had a good opportunity to nerf skill injectors to keep people from injecting back into them again. Main two reasons they wouldn't are because extractors help drive PLEX sales or they still don't realize how many problems skill injecting into caps have caused.
---
By they i dont mean ccp i mean the wormholers here on r/eve
---
&gt;Just look at what the CSM is made out of. Players are complaining about CCP changes but we have a group of elected "individuals" that are supposed to represent the players.
---
The CSM can't force CCP to anything. They provide feedback on ideas CCP show them, nothing more. The CSM cant do anything if CCP dont let them know about an idea they have, and CCP can chose to ignore the feedback from the CSM.
---
&gt;With blackout going away it is VERY interesting that large Bloc alliances told their players that they need to wait a week until going full green.
---
Almost like CCP didnt introduce a major change in game mechanics just a few days ago that the major blocs are still working on how to best adapt to...
---
If this whole thing isnt just a troll ruse cruise im truly worried for your mental health
---
thank you. will try.
---
Yeah I see how this came across now lmao. I meant as in people here saying that it would stay
---
We hate it more when players flee the game.
---
Knew this was going to happen.  Thanks for spoiling me ccp. Guess the care bears win.  Gf.
---
this could actually work

Usually get a fight every 30 minutes or so.

you mean null-bears
---
It cost me 200 dollars to sub my accounts for 3 months
---
you had the choice: adapt or die, you chose the latter...can i have your stuff??
---
Imagine quitting because a chat channel got removed
---
You can assess who is in local. Background check targets. D-Scan anoms that are close to you. Plenty can be done in 60 seconds.
---
You forgot house wives that ran out of allowance. Old men waiting on pensions. Deployed soldiers waiting on computers. Etc
---
Yeah some of Pandos ideas we good. Some I didn’t super agree with.
---
Again? They never stopped dude.
---
Ok jacob
---
Its on the task board as an upcoming feature for an advanced search where you can refine your searching alot more than the default search

It's a scam.
---
Bots were using myrms. To know who was in system they were using empty pods on gates too keep track of everyone entering and leaving.
---
You can Dscan
---
This is actually one of the reasons I love Eve. I don't trust a game where I don't know how they keep the lights on. I want to be customer, not product. They have servers, they have costs, people need to eat, please, take some money.
---
What excites me about Eve is how it melds two fundamental groups: People with disposable income, but limited free time, and people with less disposable income, but lots of free time.
---
Players with less free time or less desire to spend it making in game money, can pay the subscription of someone else who does. However, all that really does is get you items. Items in game are tools, not instant win buttons.
---
Its pay to play, not pay to win. It may even be pay to lose because without the knowledge and player skills to use your new toys, you are just going to lose them like you violated texas law.
---
You had me for a bit but then i realized CCP doesn't implement well thought out changes so it had to be fake.
---
responses like this are the best because the 1 entrance they have some control over isn't what gets them killed XD
---
When PCU goes from peak 30k to barely making 20k active users at the end of summer when it’s supposed to be increasing, there’s a problem. CCP can’t afford to lose 1/3 their player base when they only retain 1-2% of new players. A 15 year old MMO is luckily to even be alive, they can’t be pushing it to hard or they are going to kill themselves. Changes are necessary, but need to be more gradual, not a bunch of shit all at once, and need to be measured not extreme. This midlife crisis wreck everything chaos is bullshit.
---
You can dscan a target and narrow down which anomaly to warp to. That time can make or break whether you can get tackle on them.
---
Depending on your privileges, yes.
---
Ok..
---
A hail Mary isn't an indication they are willing to iterate on fuck all.
---
There are things that have needed iterating in for over a decade that actually would have improved the game
---
Blackout was a failed hail Mary.
---
Both these things are powerful tools for hunting. So this.
---
You can always create a new bookmark folder just for that, to transfer the bookmark to someone else.

You would both need to be on at the same time though

Don't let the dream die friend!
---
Hi, GSF diplomat here. I play without needing to log in. Adapt or die.
---
I'd say that's my average as a neutral. I only fly t1 frigates so far, so I usually don't take fights against anything but other t1s. I fly through amamake and the busier systems near it and if I don't find anything I roam in like a 12-5 jump loop back around to check then again.
---
Sometimes nothing in an hour+, sometime 3-4 in an hour. I guess flying more his could help me get more fights, but I've been resisting the urge until I'm more adept with the fights overall in t1 frigs.
---
Yes we are, a ton of them kept at it, but I reckon the “legitimate” bots (ones ran by line members to supplement their isk) will come back a plenty. 
---
Also yay, more super ratting under umbrellas.
---
 \[tinfoil hat time\] 1. Majority of CSM is null reps. 2. Null alliance leaders all tell their people "no titan/super ratting for a week" 3. CCP  announces an end to blackout on Monday.  It's almost like they KNEW in advance. \[tinfoil removed\]
---
Afraid not. Just folders. So you'll need to create one for each.
---
i was expecting from them (CCP)to introduce some kind of obesravtories easy to get a fight on...do we need conflict drivers?Acording to  CCP looks like no...what a [dummasses.Im](https://dummasses.Im) not salty but minus 3 chars here and u cant haz my stuff
---
Lelob leaving eve would be a victory for everyone.
---
is there a TL;DR version ?
---
Unfortunately, no. Sorry!
---
Adapt or die (though I agree with you, the game needed a shake up and stuff was actually happening and people were learning to adapt quick. Guess we’ll adapt back to regional intel spotting small gang roamers 10 jumps out. Shame. 
---
Time to move back to WHs perhaps.
---
Blackout, and the shift of CCP to a less inclusive relationship with its players has pissed off a lot of people and shifted a lot of real people out of the habit of logging in.   A very bad thing to do. 
---
Think these were only Bots gone from the PCU...well...why the hell is CCP backtracking then?  There were lots and lots of real people that said F this.  I hate your changes and I am out.  This was met with cheers from a vocal group on Reddit and pretty much an official response from CCP of HTFU.  These real people though are actually...well... needed.  Go figure.  
---
I expect most people are waiting for some sign that CCP isn’t going to screw up an entire gameplay again before they even thing about resubing their accounts. 
---
I am worried though that without blackout the Rorqual meta will shift back to excavators (not healthy) and the real Bots will come back to Null.  Time will tell.
---
About the equivalent of a chest x-ray
---
Buttblasted Jones is back with more words.
---
Better hope he doesn’t learn about bullet points, he just might shoot himself in the knee with them.
---
How is your fake patch better than any since I started playing the game. (10-20 minutes might be a bit long but the concept is much better than what we have/had/are getting again.
---
There’s something frankly unclear to me. I left eve a year ago and been following news mainly via reddit, podcasts, etc...
---
Was it harder to find pvp content (I think about small and midsize gang fights and also hunting) during blackout or is content easier to find?
---
This is good.
---
I do not , I subscribe though so ccp gets it’s pound of flesh from me , making money from exploration and pi is more than enough to keep you in shiny ships.
---
Wim/Wim  They went to highsec, they didn't go away, and now all the leet PvPers can hunt bots.
---
Yea sounds good, though the map already provides “in space in the last 30m”, this could be really cool.
---
Honest answer? I let a lot of people read it and the heaviest changes came from suggestions by our ex-wh team and people that have played all styles of content in eve. Then I tried to make it what would be the most extensive changes without breaking any one play style.
---
so?
---
Had me going till I saw the resource scarcity section, then realized it was an opinion piece.
---
 When did i say you had to be a dumbass when you logged in. Instead of trying to adapt your strategy you gave up
---
Will we be able to apply to have new entries to the monument? I lost an EVE friend several months ago, and this is my first time learning of the monument's existence.
---
Pretty much, I remember reading about this thing called Serenity. Think it’s a barren wasteland now..
---
&gt;  the trend is bound to continue on the usual curve.
---
A little bit. I've seen it mostly in Vale in post-blackout conditions.
---
How about undock some jackdaws instead of rorquals and fight
---
Eve can be dangerous and challenging.
---
That’s the way to do it, best dps Of eve (dollar per second)
---
Yea, I should have kept editing to make it look official. But.. well, that section gets into numbers and coding and percentages I don't have access to, to make a truly informed decision.
---
Any nerfs to intel need nerfs to hunter intel
---
If the DED runner is poor, he's doing it wrong :P
---
Almost anything would have been better.  Almost anyone that has actually played the game, could have told them how this was going to go....badly.  They could have also added counterplay to the lack of local.  Upgraded to the system that would need to be added.  
---
Others have come up with better ideas, but that would actually involve coming up with interesting game play and not just flipping the ‘piss off everyone living in Null switch’
---
&gt;tweak
---
Its sledgehammer that affects the wrong players. Goons were almost not affected but some region saw 80% decrease in ratting.
---
This
---
Instead of people adapting they took their ball and went home to throw a tantrum.
---
Bragging about being a "diplomat" in an internet spaceship game. Whelp that is a check for you being retarded.
---
Daily reminder  you're still retarded
---
1 - They do that anyway.
---
2 - Hi.
---
&gt; They already lost all the krabs,
---
Maybe maybe not.  Most probably just logged in their pvp alts and let their crab alts idle while ccp figures out what they can do.
---
2 changes in 8 weeks. We were promised 8 changes in 8 weeks.
---
... null is already one of the most rewarding regions in the game to pve in. 
---
That was the point of null local, to try and balance the massive ISK faucet Null had become under the umbrella mechanics.
---
Can’t post cause at work but: HUD in the middle, with chat channels to the left and mods to the right. Overview on the left of course, local and d-scan docked in one window above the other chat channels, and next to that people and places/fleet/sometimes d-scan. 
---
Probe scanner docked in my chat channels.
---
I think they will take what they’ve learned from blackout and make an informed development decision cycle out of it.
---
I pay the sub because I think if you don't the game kinda forces you to do stuff you're not necessarily interested in. That said, that's a lot of money you guys are spending, nothing wrong with it, glad you dudes seem to be having fun but my question is, how much are you dying that you've gotta spend hundreds of dollars to keep things going?
---
Hunters don't know how many people are sitting cloaked.
---
Why would the capsule detonate, according to the lore there is a system in the capsule that detects a breach then kills the clone with neurotoxin while mapping and transferring the mind
---
I imagine destroying your clone would just be done by manually triggering this system, no explosions involved
---
Maybe it will bring players back but it will also drive off others.
---
Who woulda thunk trying to fight large bomber fleets in capitals would go well. There are dozens of ships in the game that work as an effective counter, try one of them. Its silly making the same mistake over and over and expecting the results to be different.
---
When she says "go faster" it doesn't mean pound her pelvis into dust... it means go faster.  We need iteration, CCP needs to act like they've been there before...
---
Anyone super ratting with current cyno system is crazy. 
---
Please die quietly is my mantra.
---
Don’t appear in local until you break the jump cloak. Game fixed.
---
Man you're sad.
---
what if it tied into some other mechanic like with incursions or invasions or something like that. like local gets blacked out until you fight them out? i’m not in null so i don’t know how that would work for everyone down there though
---
I'll keep reminding you, if you like. Blackout was utter shite for newbies. They couldn't do anything without getting ganked. Personally I'm sad that we go back to perfect intel, but apparently the majority thinks it is no longer worth to live in nullsec without local, so it has to be revised.    
---
I don't know where you get the idea that we are not helping newbies. Must be WH brain. We are helping them in many different ways, with free ships, free skills, classes, mining boosts etc.
---
In context, yes, but that's only delaying the problem by 1, 1.5 years.
---
You know that this goes both ways? Why play when you can't do things as everyone goes and docks up?
---
CCP offered covert cynos, people whined. Lmao, just charge more for jf services.
---
Id die quiet in a carrier but not a 20b super.
---
I resubbed to EVE because I liked what I heard about blackout. Shaking things up and trying to revitalise the game this way seemed reasonable. I am also okay with bringing back local. What disappoints me is that CCP did not deliver any lessons learned or how they plan on going forward, which makes the whole thing seem pointless.
---
Ratting in null during blackout with a subcap was not making anyone millions of isk. I know this because I live In null as a line member and was losing my junk to cloaked gangs it was not fun feeding these tourists. You say you are in low sec and know very well the people in your system congrats you have local. with blackout you had no idea who was with you until they decloak and murder you the counter was to try to run if you could surprise Dscan won’t work on cloaked ships. These people are not locals and have no skin in the SOV game they just want easy kills if you try to fight them they run off. I am ok with risk absolutely ok but blackout was so ridiculously one sided I have no idea how hunters found it fun.
---
I don't have to try it, I'm not ratting nor mining anymore. That's a simple fact that it is too dangerous, dscan cannot help you against cloaky gangs unless you live in a region where they don't go, who knows ?
---
Implying it ever stopped
---
I'd be supportive of local being delayed at least until I break gate cloak. Otherwise people running away can see me enter local before I even load the system.
---
Wow if they implemnt like 1/4 of this in the game I would resub insted of just shit post on eve.
---
You'll realize how much you want the carebears to return when you spend 10 hours roaming null and don't find a single ratter to kill.
---
Lol because having a recon cyno alt is hard.
---
If you want no local and increased rewards, move to a Hole.
---
Nice.
---
Exactly. Ruble isn’t real money, just a paper. I never pay rubles, farm for plex like most of russians.
---
Lolololololololololololololololololol
---
Correct :)
---
Plus at least you can load the system before targets are initiating warp out of their sites back to safety.
---
Yes.  In theory yes.  
---
Sadly, in practice it showed people that not logging on and unsubscribing their accounts was also a good response.  
---
You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink.
---
Get maymay'd.
---
Send me any amount of friendship and I'll double it!
---
If they keep switching it up like this it will probably be hard for the bitters to keep up and reduce some of the game stagnation. Hopefully this is a multi step process
---
You don't get to know or choose what gets routed over a tor node though, like just hosting a node puts you at that risk and you can't really do anything about it personally
---
Our current plan is to convert all existing vouchers into new bookmarks, after the change you can still have personal folders of bookmarks. :)
---
you must be hurting now the blackout is being scrapped, my post aged well!!
---
Empty space is cruel. So maybe it was a win win? Nah, hilmar just not very good at eve meta.
---
I agree with all of this. My Corp is a testament to how you can adapt ti the changes successfully.  We changed fits, tried new tactics to defend our carebears. We did this so when everyone is bitching and crying about how it’s impossible to crab, we’ll let them sit on the side line as our Indy and t2 team reap the rewards of production. That’s how it should be. People banning together to make it work. 
---
It didn’t stop at protecting our crabs. We came up with new fit and doctrines to hunt. We have the most fun over the black out. Our hunters can actually hunt. Instead of being reported by near bots at every turn and chasing VNI bots. 
---
Reading Reddit today is a major let down add in all the goonies and null bears rejoicing and it’s intolerable.
---
Super hardcore ratting is still super hardcore. If you cant afford pvp ships, how are you going to pvp?
---
You do friendship? I run isk doubling services from time to time! Obviously theres an occasional giveaway from the isk I made from doubling. Gila given away last week.
---
Not really true, but the are definitely a few of us that are wormholes for life :)
---
Bookmarks can be set to expire... and Wormhole corps rejoiced.
---
That's because you're mining in a barge, so your income is directly proportional to the time you spend in the belt, down to a single beam cycle.
---
Blackout hurt ratters much more because that's what people hunt. You don't bling a barge, you bling rattles and carriers.
---
Doesnt sound like you did
---
The end of an era.
---
Sorry that you suck at the game so much. Not sorry that your effort post on Reddit is a shitshow. Gives us all tons of entertainment, especially those of us that play the metagame instead of pressing F1 like you.
---
"Should be fun"
---
A few small null groups I know were forced to either leave or join up a big bloc because they couldn't organize a proper defense with the lack of local intel. Many of them quit entirely (mostly for WoW Classic).
---
Care to name any big blocs that were forced out of null?
---
Hilmar: please let this blackout kill eve so I can finally retire to my Costa Rican mansion.
---
My playstyle didn't change, it didn't need to.
---
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/8A2iKKS.png) what mine looks like.  Local on the left, chat windows between that and the capacitor, dscan/inventory stacked above that, and overview/probe UI on the right.
---
Then don't rat in it.
---
Tragic mistake. My tragedy, your mistake.
---
That will die long before help gets cyno'd in.
---
On a single account to single account ratio, it's not. It's the vertical account stacking issue.
---
Looks amazing. Keep it up.
---
So fight them. Instead you are bitching from hisec
---
Yes you can add your friend. If you go to the star system Molea, its found on Moon 1. You can see how other people have done it as well, but as I understand you just go and jettison a jetcan, then rename the can with your friends name on it. You can do this now with the current graveyard, as they only plan to replace the control tower the graveyard is based around. Any cans out there now should remain when the new monument gets put in.
---
What situation would i use a recon? over what? a t3? well i live in lowsec currently and its alot cheaper to cyno in a pilgrim than a proteus if it where to die. EHP is good enouth so vOv
---
I mean, it is no worse than being in Elitist Ops.
---
I am hoping this is being returned with the plan to stabilize account free fall, with the intent to put out observatories soon with the understanding blackout is returning.
---
Weaponized salt
---
So if I read this correctly do I need the player kb (ID) number and not the name in order to search?
---
Is this the same for zkill?
---
BOOOOOOOO YOU GUYS SUCK!

---
Hope he is american so he can say hello to electric chair.
---
Or all cloaks? Or maybe add special structures in space to remove blackout. Lots more that can be done than just on/off.
---
wth, sharn. how long have you been writing that thing?
---
Before the blackout, you could make quite a lot of money. That's what I was referring to. Obviously not during the blackout.
---
The difference between your circumstance and mine, is that you probably have a network of intel, heads up on enemy gangs roaming your territory, SRP, and the ability to simply undock and run sites without having to work for them or taking risks, pre-blackout. Now, you simply do not have local.
---
I don't have an intel network, because there's ALWAYS hostiles in the constellation. I occasionally had a smattering of reports of the odd enemy fleet moving through back when I was in the Militia, but usually you need to take that with a grain of salt. As an FW and lowsec corp, our alliance/corp had no way to really tax our members, and as such offered no SRP. I have to actually look for the DED and relic sites I use to make my isk, it's not something that I can just undock and warp to.
---
On top of that, I've lived in wormholes before. I know exactly what it's like to not have local. I know what it's like to lay into your Dscan like a desperate alcoholic who's been dry for weeks and just got their hands on a bottle. This is not new to me. I still managed to make isk back then, though not a whole lot since I was still pretty new.
---
Don't forget boson through the cyno

Thanks for taking the time to answer questions on a Saturday, Lebowski.
---
detects breach - perhaps there is system that  cause  shell fracture and neurotoxin is released?
---
Gonna try this tonight!
---
Did not need those small groups and people that enjoyed PvE anyway.
---
What he says was backed by the MER, Imperium and Legacy mined magnitudes more than anyone else and we up slightly from pre-blackout numbers. Everyone else dropped by substantial amounts.
---
yeah, it shows in the amount of fun/hr eve delivers in tyool 2019.
---
Good job I didn't waste any money on those anti anxiety meds he said we would need!
---
Not sure if its possible with Zkb but with evekill you need the player ID which is the same on both sites  
---
look a character up and look in the URL for the ID
---
So you're making alliances stronger.
---
Daily Reminder - Your posting is still horrendous.
---
About one week.

Man make me opt out of this shit I had blast with no local I shouldn't have to lose my fun cause of a bunch of delta cucks who cant defend their shit.

The polygraph has determined *opens letter* THAT WAS A LIE

notthing of value was lost

Customers are customers
---
Nobody ratted together the isk for a Titan with subcaps. Ishtars make like 22mil ticks, which is uhh, 60m/hour after alliances taxes, 1000 hours to rat enough for a Titan.
---
I did a system count of a loop of Amarr to Jita dropping the lowest number if counted twice. 15 systems 1323 total 88.2 average with a game player count of 13680 so about 10% of the game was in those 15 systems. SAD.
---
Grrr CCP hat CCP.
---
That rethoric is absolutely wrong. The game is never better off with people leaving. Seriously. Please think it through.
---
Spoiler: it doesn't
---
Better idea. Go full Law Abiding Citizen where he captures that one guy at the start and records it and sends it to the DA's family.

Just warp a sabre to their blops and then bam u have a fight.
---
Overheat activation bar?
---
I think when he said little guy he meant organisations with 100s of people instead of 1,000s and more. Maybe even just 10s.
---
CCP bent the knee.
---
I'll give him credit for not just screeching autistically
---
AGREE
---
So a margurita with salt?
---
 Does it matter who it is, its an account with a subscription and if it doesnt log in any more why does it need a subscription?
---
I would advise against weighing up the game community with r/Eve. This place is far saltier and far more grrr goons than anywhere else.
---
As someone who liked the blackout personally I will also note that we saw the same in Brave. Risk / reward was always tough for new players but this took things to the point where they almost never were able to get their heads above water. I started bringing them to Highsec instead to help build a foundation first because it just wasn't working for many in null.
---
I loved parts of blackout, however turning nullsec into wh space was not a winning idea.  The rewards are not there for the risk involved.  I think blackout could have been implemented in a way that gives safety on a small scale and gives hunters strategic opportunity. 
---
Make it adm based.  No activity systems get current blackout mechanics.  Highest adm system gets delayed local equal the cloak timer.  Varying levels of delay in between.  Makes it worth rolling into hunting grounds and the hunted knows only that one person is in their system, not about the 100 people in that unused system down the pipe waiting to bridge in.
---
There are a lot of people who think they live a high risk, high reward life in NS.  Yet when they describe "risky" behavior they are actually describing in-game behavior that is closer to "crossing a busy street against a red light while reading your phone".
---
Yep I came back for it, Had some fun solo hunting. Would of been nice if they waited like a week or two more so Shadowkeep could be out but oh well.
---
On paper, you are right. But in practice, most people look at a 2 year training plan and just say "fuck it" until other, more immediate returns are trained.
---
My question is what the technical reason was for blackout (surely they cleaned up some code while working on it) and is something else dropping on Monday, too?
---
:parrot:
---
Toxic individuals like you went away and the game became more enjoyable. I played during the same time and the same happened. Except, boosters were completely safe in thier pos. The alliance staging station was indestructible. Pos proliferation was worse than citadel spam, but with ever so slightly more cancerous mechanics behind taking them down. You had warning before someone was in your system. People still had 10 alts. The price of the game hasn't changed. The less toxic players are prevailing. 
---
Thanks for leaving. The game has been better without you.
---
My guess is more was lost then gained, and not all will return. There have been large changes in a relative short time and i think we wont see how it settles out until we get the October mer numbers(ccp will ofc know long before us). That is if ccp is done making changes. And with ccp thinking giving a couple days notice before turning things on/off is a good idea who knows.
---
Jesus just came down from New Eden's heavens to show us all salvation. Hope CCP doesnt crucify this idea and maybe implement ... ALL OF IT.
---
That's right. Exactly so. I like the Zod reference because of the unfortunately canceled Krypton show.
---
Blackout could have worked with a few other changes added. Most notably being not showing NPCs deaths on the map or through the ESI(dotlan).
---
The risk of ratting was too high when within 30 minutes a red come kill me symbol shows up for everyone everywhere to see.
---
Overheat, it lets you get more out of those modules (more speed/damage) but OH accumulates heat damage, which slowly cooks your modules. If heat damage reaches 100% the module goes offline. So ideally you turn off the heat before it gets to 100% :)
---
I suppose you are going to fap to that?  😑 Scrub
---
like I know who any of these reprobates are
---
the cycle activation bar that goes around modules you activate?
---
This. Exactly this. As a corporation director who had recently returned from a RL deployment, Blackout gave me the opportunity to see the true character of some of our members. I got to see who filled Discord with spurge and who embraced the challenge. I got to see who still logged and worked with others. I know, a bit more clearly, exactly who is going to go elsewhere at the first sign of adversity. I just wish the “experiment” had lasted a bit longer. 
---
I hope CCP makes local coming and going a regular thing in the future - time it with major buffs to 0.0 rewards and let the brave reap the profits.
---
Absolutely this.  
---
You could make the argument at least that blackout would push the Rorqual meta away from excavators, add risk to super ratting and mix up kind of a tired Null PvP meta.  But the cyno changes are just content crushing and not very helpful at all.  
---
I fully expect though that you will see more people undock, and that, again, large groups will adapt well to the cyno changes, and less organized ones not.
---
Who the F@#$ we going to hunt if nobody else but us logs in, you nitwit!
---
So did the blackout :p
---
I *knew it*!
---
Blackout was a good thing.
---
&gt; Grath go out and rat in a carrier in null and see how quick you get dropped. If you are going to suggest that your play style is better than everyone else's, you are part of the problem
---
Heres the funny thing, you have no idea how many alts or accounts I run, and the part that makes you like a fucking idiot is I already DO experience every part of EVE, from 0.0 tatting, to starting new alts- one for each race, so I can properly write up my 10k word article on the flaws of the NPE, to faction warfare, all while living in a wormhole.
---
So when I call you a bitch, I mean it, because I literally put my money where my mouth is and try all the different styles eve offers. Thanks.
---
Unsubbing 10000 accounts
---
So that's why you guys keep making retarded game design decisions. It all makes sense now.
---
The real casuality of this change:
---
No more easy way to poop out a can if you don't have any items in your ships.
---
TLDR: RREEEEEEE I'm quitting, i cant adapt, i want everyone else to play the game the way i want to play........
---
cya bro
---
we don't use that as our captcha system, Phone verification mode only affects the ability for staff to modify the server
---
adapt or die, right?
---
The issue is when you get to friends of friends whom you've never heard of. Or your list of blues has more entries than your corp has people in it.
---
I envy the wormholers. They are getting the most solid changes. Acl bookmarks are a huge deal for wormhole organizational.
---
    Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit.
---
     Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock,
---
 for the cyno is not yet lit.
---
     Break free of the station and witness the universe before you,
---
 For the cyno is not yet lit.
---
     Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait,
---
 For the cyno is not yet lit. 
---
    Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them. 
---
    The cyno is now lit.
---
Overheating gives a module increases performance. In terms of a weapon, it cycles faster. In terms of an ewar slot item, longer range. For an MWD or AB, faster speed. The solid green bar on top of the module shows that it is active, meaning it will be in overheat the next cycle. That is also where you click to overheat a single module. When the ring on the module is blinking green, it is in overheat that cycle.
---
No worries, I'm super hyped about this feature :D
---
booshed to keep out of range, but they weren't trying to stack alpha damage
---
I read it, got excited and then realised it's not real and now I am really really sad :(
---
it was initially fun, but then things did die a death.
---
I would like to see a V2.0. No local chat...but local numbers.  
---
Let's see how that affects things.
---
This, screen space is everything
---
Adapt or bye
---
Is it at least chlorinated?
---
Don't confuse difficulty with tedium.
---
The blackout doesn't make Eve any harder; the difficulty of all actions in Eve remains the same, or frankly became easier (less people, less dead exploration sites and the like) in the blackout. It does make it more tedious to be safe.
---
First of all, i dont mind the change to bookmarks in general, makes stuff a tad easier and people will have to come up w/ some 4d chess maneuvers when it comes to selling escalations
---
but lets forget about all of that and focus on the main topic of this post: the urgaypwnd bookmark, a staple of eve memes and used en masse like everyday
---
the change will make those a thing of the past, so here is my "fix"
---
the item "urgaypwnd"
---
can be fitted to anything
---
transferred as alpha pilot anywhere
---
burns everyone who receives it
---
needs no skills
---
but its not put in a list and is an actual item still, maybe a bit smaller and is overall just something for show
---
maybe have the description read something among the lines of "urgaypwnd"
---
[maybe list a few capsuleers who have been pwnd as a nod aswell]
---
I don't play anyone but one of my exCEOs passed last year oOblackOo of Demon-War-Lords, can you drop a can for me.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Demon-War-Lords
---
We managed fine before and could again. Removing helpful features long after introduction is a really shit idea though.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Regular porn bots happen periodically and mix in with the pedo bots as well.
---
I doubt it was technical.  My guess: they're doing some testing of how these thing affect the playerbase, and having both the cyno change and the blackout active simultaneously really doesn't let them see how the changes affect things independently.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Ek4TN35.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ek4TN35.jpg)  
---
That's how i have my UI setup on all my accounts. Makes it easier to tab through and issue commands when I'm using Eve O Preview to multi-box in a fleet.
---
I normally have 1 toon in fleet command and the rest in a squad with them so that I can fleet warp as required.
---
No friend, if we have a cogent and well laid out idea that the majority of EVE could all agree are good changes- it might just be a good approach to let CCP see a wide range of choices and changes people would embrace without the need to stab in the dark!
---
Sounds like a good idea to discuss for sure.
---
They are hardcore..,they just are not flexible.  
---
Seems people play the game they like, and are absolutely not interested in changing around to play the game that CCP wants them to.
---
I tried it when it had a week free trial. Just to see what it's about. It was really fun and landing on planets and exploring them was fun. But it's completely different game than Eve. Eve is a tactical space submarine mmo.
---
There weren’t that many goons out either compared to normal
---
like can you imagine  being that level of a cuck in a game holy shit lmao
---
FWIW Plex is upto 3.7m from 3.3m at the start of the day. 
---
Glad all those unique players with full subscriptions are returning so fast
---
Ok..... the question is have is how is this going to effect the plex I’ve been hoarding.
---
They already are lol
---
They got through phone verification and captcha verification. It added maybe a 15 minute delay when I turned these on.
---
that would take development effort, so its not gonna happen.
---
I was saying that till I was blue in the face. But the salt shakers were having none of it and kept claiming that all those who left were bots and less was better. Didn't really mind the black out other than it made space lonely. Did mind the drop in players. Lost a few friends and am concerned that enough time has gone by that they have found something else to occupy their time and returning is less likely.
---
&gt;all those unique players with full subscriptions  
---
nice meme
---
how do you manage to get bombed in mwd frigates? that takes some effort on the victim's part i tell ya
---
Those people have already left the game, probably for good. No need to antagonize what's left.
---
Blackout kinda neutered excavators. 
---
I think the biggest problem was that they did the blackout in a relative vaccum. If it was coupled with a rebalance to nullsec sov and resource mechanics, then it would be much more meaningfull. 
---
Everyone had already been farming and fat and happy and stagnant. If the blackout had included a shakeup of sov, and motivated everyone to mobilize and generate real conflicts, then the blackout would make sense.
---
Without some reason to empty the larders, and thus have a reason to need to farm up again, the krabs will just dock up and log out. They already have enough money
---
This appears to be the case.
---
&gt;looks like they're responding to the tantrum thrown by goons
---
Yeah, we're doing just fine during blackout. Polling our 100+ person group I'm in, it seems like people are generally split. The main concern with blackout was "space just felt really empty."
---
You never know, could be a silent majority thing. If you listen only to reddit you will probably think Bernie sanders will win the election, and you know that is far from the truth.
---
Wall of text.  The same people telling us to trust CCP as they have the stats are now complaining about blackout ending because... CCP have the stats.
---
That's right. And for some reason when you point out that people are FAR more likely to react badly when you break their toys regardless of what the product is people at least in this subred react VERY badly to the obvious truth!
---
Each and EVERY time CCP reacts to people bitching about how OTHER people play the game or people have put time an effort into designing a supership so nerf it because I don't like it, CCP is more likely to lose people INCLUDING paying customers that they would if they just left well enough alone.
---
Or in other words the bitching bitches are more likely to stay and just keep bitching if you do nothing, while on the other hand if you piss people off by doing what the bitching bitches want you are MUCH likely to lose and not replace the people you have pissed off!
---
I'm going to I'm top killboard as of late with 70 something kills just sad to see the reversal in development in the game
---
Evidently their strategy was the best strategy. Now you're the one who's upset.
---
Austin TAPI bro?
---
People do. The bombers run. The defenders get sick of doing that twenty times a day.
---
Blackout comes: Goons salty, everyone else happy
---
Blackout ends: Goons happy, everyone else "WTF?"
---
5000 people joined at once, some people edge lord trolled. This is a solved problem for years now. But if you think that someone justifies ACTUAL CHILD PORN then you are fucked up in the head, completely. Seriously, seek help.
---
&gt; Slack server has a way more mature crowd.
---
Do 3 active posters count as a crowd? Because tweetfleet slack is dead.
---
U motherfucker, u gave me hope
---
Because bombers choose not to fight Jackdaws and peace out.
---
I doubt they will be.  I wouldn't be surprised if they expand the list of ships that can fit them, but I'd 100% say we're never returning to where we were before.  CCP laid out a design goal with the cyno changes, something they didn't really do with blackout.
---
Yeah, gratz, they metagamed CCP. Blackout was legitimately interesting. Hope your happy to get back to the grind of eve pve
---
Im anti goonie myself, but youre just an idiot
---
Not saying its its justified saying im not surprised
---
Which small groups?
---
Never understood that argument. PVE is content and something to kill. More that people mine the lower the price of stuff goes. PVE'rs do once in a while put on their armor and get out there and fight. If you have a big toy don't you want to practice with it a bit and that is what ratting is meant to do no?
---
True, I misread. The point is basically the same though. The *little guys* get farmed more and the risk vs reward is shit for them.
---
Praise Bob! #wormholerBTW

Those are rookie numbers. You need to be hitting the hundreds every month.
---
So delicious.
---
"I'd say it's a feature of the server" - you
---
Seriously, fuck you.
---
Nice going boys, you're playing yesterday's tape.
---
My corp had 1 person in it that quit because of the blackout. He donated all his stuff to it upon leaving and I seriously doubt he will be back. You have to wonder how many other people did the same thing and now theres nothing to come back for
---
No point defending space of it cant make you fillthy rich
---
All that matters is what is good for the general player base. I don't happen to like the cyno changes as it makes large battles less likely and that is what sells EVE and gets people excited to come play. 
---
All that matters in the long run is getting more people into EVE.
---
Let's see your KB...
---
And we were so close to seeing no more Olmeca shitposts because of the blackout, too. Oh well.
---
Congrats, you won. Go back to mining
---
Youre the one on the server not me.
---
As you should be, this feature is freaking awesome duder
---
Im still waiting for your source on that dave
---
I’m a shit pilot with a severe case of window licker syndrome.   I like my pulse legion... can someone explain to me, as if I was a small mentally handicapped child what’s the joke here?
---
Yes, the people who play the game the most are killing the game.
---
Have your water checked for lead.
---
Bro can you legit just spot me a nyx?
---
PLEX prices were well past 1.3 bil beforr super ratting was popular and way before Rorqual mining was ever a thing. I still remember PLEX being 300 mil when I started.
---
RIP BLACKOUT
---
Embrace the ChAoS Era, adapt or die, yada, yada, yada.
---
Well fucking said, the droves of smooth brained null bears celebrating the end of blackout makes me sick
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
Did not need...well...anyone.
---
I wish.
---
What advantage does it have over Talwars?
---
You're the one praising people getting blasted with child porn. Pedophilia apologia is disgusting. Go back to your hole.
---
Hopefully they will not repeat the mistake that they just announced.
---
niiiice
---
MUH BLOC KILLIN EVE!
---
Less autistic neckbeards screeching at him over a 16 year old videogame maybe
---
I keep pressing space bar but still cant jump. 
---
Whut do FC?
---
I like how detailed this one is :)
---
oof got me good.
---
Sweet, thanks. :D I'm definitely doing that today, but I also want to know if this future memorial will allow the same. I imagine some kind of safeguard will be put in place to prevent defacement.
---
&gt; Logistics are also a pain in the ass.
---
Gross understatement.  They need to reduce the packaged size of industrials to fit in a BR. At least.
---
0.05mm layer height, it took forever lol
---
The funny part is, a lot of these people pretend they’re “hardcore” for playing a “hardcore mmo” but literally can’t function without max intel and asset safety
---
There were more of you.
---
Prime salt...lol
---
Boosying wh spawn rates is good. Mor easilu availablr content with ship size restrictions.
---
I mean pretty much everything other the greens and purples are KOS for wormhole corps.
---
I would have been okay with exploring the possibility of covert ships not appearing in local. Leave the sneaky shit to the sneaky ships.
---
Nice Report, hope you are continuing these reports
---
Nah, sounds boring. Their going to find something new to fuck with instead iterate on old changes or finish something they said they would do.
---
VPN providers that are worth a damn have regular audits by different independent security contractors that confirm they don't log.
---
So lets give some credit to CCP.  They made the change, it was hated by many loved by the rest, it was good for pissing off botters, but in the end (I speculate) the numbers dwindled past what was just: &lt;insert excuse here, aka; summer, kids going back to school, etc.&gt;, and apparently the numbers CCP had reflected it.  So blackout is over and they reversed that part of chaos.  Good on them.  Let's move on.
---
Oh no! A multi-front war!
---
Looks like more content for Legacy.
---
If you haven't noticed, Delve krabs never stopped logging in, but otherwise you are correct,
---
" Don't blame it on those whiney wormhole people. " Fixed it for you.
---
Soooo how do i get customers back after i have pissed them off? asking for a friend btw.
---
dont want risk my big toy to potential sellers that could sell information where this toy was taken
---
the group is called "strawman inc."
---
I liquidated all my shit, gave half the isk to my brother.
---
Hilmar said he didn't give a shit if the changes resulted in player losses, so I'm obliging him.
---
I will not be back while he is still part of CCP in any way.
---
You are correct where I'm concerned.  Like you, I have lots of RL responsibilities, a full time job, family, etc.  I work in RL to play in my virtual life.
---
Maybe CCP should do something to combat bots that *doesn't* also screw over everyone else at the same time...
---
Got a zkill for this group?
---
Nice constructive criticism you have there.  /s
---
Reddit posting is a bigger problem.
---
You had two years of total prosperity did people forget how hard this game was?. Feel fucking cute might inject a nyx for this op isnt how eve shoyld be.
---
that looks sick 
---
still makes me angry ccp hasn't partnered with a model company yet
---
I told you, talking in stations interview. Go watch it.
---
&gt;Sad that they couldn't find something in between.
---
I wouldn't count this out *quite* yet. 
---
Solutions take time to design, implement, test, and deploy. As the PCU was approaching a free-fall, they clearly couldn't continue on the present course, even if they **are** working on some manner of 'happy medium' system.
---
We'll see soon if they were serious about making changes to shake up Eve, but I am cautiously optimistic. They're definitely paying attention now, at the very least.
---
Mining anom sites should respawn at the same rate as asteroid belts. Change my mind
---
Make blackout permanent.
---
c
---
Yeah and that is fine but for me personally that would mean you wouldn't fit in my corporation. Especially in null, where you need to defend your flag on the map
---
maybe a more pve focused game like wow is more for you....oh and can i have your stuff?
---
Pretty.
---
The Blackout made me resub. I understand that if thousands leave because if it, it is not that fun and all, but me personally I loved the feeling of space being big again. And the value of scouts, and the unplanned skirmishes that happened both during a fleet or any other time and the fact that you kind of have to cooperate when mining or doing anything (i e have security ready, scouts ready etc). That is how I imagined Eve would be when I was a teen and still wish it was, thus me loving the blackout. 
---
I absolutely dislike the fact that local exists WITHOUT any countermeasure to it, i e that local is made possible by a structure that can be easily jammed/disabled/destroyed instead of "magic" that always is and will be a constant intel of anyone in local space which is insane to be honest.
---
Bounties are paid by CONCORD right? What if CONCORD saw pirates as less of a threat in a particular system once they've thoroughly had the shit kicked out of them so they pay less. But they offer higher bounties for rats in systems nobody touches. Everything else in the game is affected by supply and demand right? Abundance of mercs and less of a demand for clearing rats means lower payout. Lack of mercs and a high demand for rat clearing equals higher payout. Don't know if it really adds anything to the game but it can work if it did.
---
Any change CCP makes will be brigaded to hell unless it's an original idea by mittens
---
As someone who just started playing about two weeks ago... I imagine this didn't affect me, right? I haven't gotten to see the unsafe parts of space yet, I think.
---
Wait, they ended/are ending blackout?
---
We only play bots online because CCP refuses to put in actual backend programs that would catch and kill, or at least flag for review. 
---
Until CCP stops relying on players to report bots and handles it themselves, we will always have bots.
---
You cheesehead, p.s Its fucking josh urgh
---
Did you take the midnight train
---
going anywhere?
---
blackout had zero effect on bots for the most part they adapted, please stop trying that line it doesn't work.  
---
local is not 100% perfect intel PEBCAK applies here morons will still die regardless of local.  
---
delayed local only works if you don't get local yourself whilst on gate cloak, so you would still need to dscan to see if anyone was either there unless you decloak first.  
---
Either way as a fleet pvp'r who doesn't PVE at all, all I can say is goodbye blackout may you rest in piss.
---
I recommend fishing. Then when you suck at that, you still have eve.
---
Ye... sure....
---
CCP is a business "run" by gamers rather than a business that has a game run by business people and it shows!
---
The only reason it has survived is it's a VERY good game/product, but even the best product in the world can eventually be ruined by foolish management.
---
A lot of people that leave, once they find a new "girl" won't be back no matter what.
---
I left for about 5 years after I got sick of CCP breaking my toys I had put time effort and isk into. This was pre injectors so lost time was LOST TIME.
---
I've heard of lots of people quitting and giving away their stuff. People how have given away their stuff, including isk, are the least likely to come back.
---
Because you are clearly needed to light the cyno while noone is ready.
---
It was dangerous....dangerous to CCPs bottom line.
---
Not sure how the numbers are going to bounce back. I would expect to see a 10%+ exodus from hs to null.
---
go to bed josh
---
Yup.. all the way to San Diego back in '95
---
Thank you for the info. Gave me the push I needed to overhaul my permissions system
---
🦀Blackout is gone🦀
---
That would be skill. Search SniggWaffe.
---
I love ccp Falcon's face... Looks like a slapped arse
---
How long does it take for missiles to arrive?
---
perfect intel is a meme, stop using it
---
I suspect a perhaps dangerously large number of people are permanently feed up with CCP's bullshit.
---
 left for about 5 years after I got sick of CCP breaking my toys I had put time effort and isk into. This was pre injectors so lost time was LOST TIME.
---
Also EVE isn't the sort of game that a the current variety of the teen and early 20 crowd will get into. Too complex and labor intensive.
---
That's the same reason why you won't find, really, any good flight sims anymore. They are all dumbed down because the nain target market isn't going to memorize a 300 page manual like we routinely did back in the day.
---
Sure new games are "prettier" but we had better flight models, better enemy AI, more accurately simmed weapons, and so on and so forth.
---
Sure but then be a renter or stay in HS.
---
I joined during the blackout, I do not want it to go away.  The only reason it is, is because experienced players have nothing better to do but bitch all day on r/Eve while new players are actually learning to play the game as it comes.
---
Look at you, sad sacks whining your way into the developers chair. You could've stopped the Cyno Change but no, blackout is the collective bitching point so here ya go. Old players suck.
---
Nice analysis thanks you
---
&gt;Eras
---
Not praising it.  This is what happens when you attract a crowd worse than /r/eve and use euphenism like edge lords to justify behaviour and you're now surprise by this?  Then ban people from /r/eve from telling you you have a bad server with bad people which CCP wont even touch says more about you than me.  You should honestly just delete the discord.
---
Good post, Thomas. 
---
I’m still going to miss Blackout.
---
Yeah. It's been heartening to see people adapt and grow, despite the threats and the general doom-and-gloom that people were projecting. I personally thought alot of small/mid-sized alliances would be fucked, but I've been pleasantly surprised.
---
&gt;ccp Falcon
---
Personally I'm tired of seeing the fucker on the loader screen...
---
&gt;blackout had zero effect on bots for the most part they adapted
---
That is where I would disagree. The bots that tried to adapt were fairly easy to trick by just cloaking and waiting or "crashing gate" but not leaving system.
---
&gt;local is not 100% perfect intel PEBCAK applies here morons will still die regardless of local.
---
Local itself might not be 100% intel, but when augmented with alliance intel channels that can be used to automatically ping afk members that a hostile is in the area it starts to become problematic.
---
Also, more than just morons died under blackout, the lack of local allowed hunters to gank ships being flown by otherwise capable players who were at the keyboard at the time.
---
&gt;delayed local only works if you don't  get local yourself whilst on gate cloak, so you would still need to  dscan to see if anyone was either there unless you decloak first.
---
100% that was part of many of the original proposals for a delayed local
---
I actually think blackout was a bad solution that doesn't work to address the problems with sov null but sure, whatever helps your narrative, you absolute weirdo
---
&gt;test the concept of delayed local 
---
Wut... delayed local would have been a good compromise I think
---
As soon has they decloak they will be targeted and killed. The cyno will only be up for a few seconds, which in the current age of mouth breathers not knowing how to jump, means you are not going to get proper help and you will die.
---
This post is shit, but some of the abuse people are rightfully heaping on this already steaming hot pile is pretty fucking funny.
---
I suppose.
---
No, it was saltiest salt I've ever seen.  It actually exceeded when League of Legends got rid of solo queue.
---
Guess this is Krabs Online now and forever.
---
I hope my alliance maintains the ban on titan ratters.
---
Adapt, Die or Cry long and hard so you get your toys back
---
It still says corp withdrawal. That makes me wonder and was why I was wondering.
---
Better wait till daddy mittens pings it.
---
best bet is hold off a few days after the fact, to see what kind of funny business goes on, or if they do something small brained like "bring back local with observatories"
---
It means people would have to travel which increases risk and the opportunity for mistakes to be made
---
Some of the BEST PVP pilots live in FW space. They fight constantly and make their isk on the side. When you constantly go through the meatgrinder it becomes a way of life and they can run circles around everyone else pound for pound. And it is not just frigates that is a common misconception. At the apex of the Gal/Cal war there were 250 man battleship fights.
---
"development."
---
"its fine that people got spammed with child porn because i was a volunteer once and edge lords existed"
---
Is this really the hill you wanted to die on?
---
First thing to be thrown out, fozzie sov
---
As opposed to any other day...
---
Cynojammer are a thing, you know
---
In a lore way it makes sense. This seems pretty plain, imo.
---
In a balance way, theoretically, it makes sense, in that fw gives you a way of making isk and access to missions and stuff that you wouldn't otherwise have, so a drawback to balance these perks theoretically makes sense. Whether this balance is well struck these days or considers the reality of alts and whatever is ... well yeah, it just doesn't really work out right.
---
this post was a mistake
---
No wormholes are.
---
This is the greatest loss
---
Would also be a nice way to deal with over-saturation.
---
Monday
---
Krabs Online, now and forever after this.
---
Players: Stop Capital Proliferation!  
---
CCP: *Stops Capital Proliferation*  
---
Players: But I wanted to afk rorqual mine, wtf.  Stop *their* capital proliferation, not mine.
---
wtf are you talking about lol, have you even roamed these 2 months
---
Is there even a difference these days?
---
cmon, everything is not so bad
---
Hey I am not arguing the data or the bots, not even the kills I dont make. Just funny how they 2 minutes before announcing that the blackout where being undone, they said the the BO actually was a good thing for risk vs reward. Which is funny that they said so. Im no dev, but personally I loved the BO regardless of what CCP saw in their data. :)
---
It's almost like the naysayers didn't pull up zkill and see a 25% decrease in dead ships. Christ, it was there for all to see.
---
Alliances could always distribute bookmarks by getting one set to each corp for corp bookmarks. This just removes the inventory items and let's them be shared directly.
---
Removing tedium is good.
---
They blew their chance, there will not be another no-local event for at least another decade assuming the game can survive that long.
---
Yes and pls do the same for player wars.
---
I want to wardec that one specific individual in horde/goons. No, I don't want to get my corp involved.
---
Oh, and pls make the war valid only in nullsec.
---
Im not 100% sure how good the old sov system would really be in the long run but i think it would at least support escalations so you might not be wrong on this.
---
you can do the same thing in a kestrel. and you can get the hookbill beyond 100k range. This is Faction Warfare frigate wisdom lol. Or for the same price use sniper corms and have instant damage application.
---
They should have made it a short event then when it ended listen to feedback. Then decided if to make permanent.
---
I did say all the pvpers fish would dry up on day one.
---
The ultimate ideal for CCP as a business is to make money. If everyone quits the game because of a change then it really isn't that great of an ideal, is it?
---
Its been an unofficial community thing up until now, so there's no idea what CCP is gonna do specifically for stuff like that.
---
In the past since it was based around a POS control tower, there have been a few occasions where Corps have came in and destroyed the tower, which then led the containers to despawn out in space later, but each time the cemetery was repaired. 
---
I doubt it will be possible to destroy the monument, so mass deletion of the cemetery is gonna be hard to do after this is put in game. There might still be the possibility of people being able to come in and destroy individual containers however...
---
The only thing coming back is bots and dudes with a dozen rorquals.
---
it has an MSE, as long as its prop is off, it wont die to 1 bomb. and hopefully wont be anywhere near bomb range.
---
Source: Red and neutral cloaky campers forecast to return to dozens of local Null chat windows on Monday. Analyst: “Crabs will still need to consider the risk that these campers could have a cyno and guess whether they are actually online or a threat. Seeing them in local likely to only slightly change their threat assessment.”
---
In other brighter news, a space van full of special needs children that has been missing for months has been found. The children will be returning safely to their homes in the coming few days. More at 10.
---
What about selling bookmarks? Some of us have found mildly profitable ways to market bookmarks. I love the idea of dealing in information and don't want to see that feature go away.
---
"the game"
---
Krab people won.
---
30% inflation here we go
---
Please tell me, oh all knowing reddit user, how is it you know more about the membership of my wormhole corporation than I do?
---
The idea itself isn't that bad... Make it from time to time in different parts of New eden (not only null!) without informing the players. So you have to be aware of this situation and can't be Afk all the time. You could also let it be part of the drifter lore. The idea of a blackout isn't that bad. But only null and all the time was just stupid. Make it random. At and for random times!
---
Hehehe if it was a meme they wouldn't have tried to nerf it on the first place. Anyways welcome back to the crab era. When eve was also dying but was also boring.
---
Yes the counter to the retarded instant rescue fleet. Cynojammers are weak af, but it is to much to bring a few ships to volley it off.
---
Right?
---
Adapt or die, friend.
---
Just put an alt on the gates, use scouts, friends, your alliance. Just like most have a thousands (yeah hyperbolic) alts, just put some to scout. Cooperation is half of the point with a player run universe, is it not? That´s how I view this "problem" with BO.
---
tldr russian retard sets eso green even tho orders were to be kept red cause he wanted to mine
---
ty elo for culling the herd
---
For very long few seconds depending on the enemy fleet. You just need to fit your ship right. The other solution it just lighting it 200 off and warp. But thats to much effort I guess.
---
So the players who screamed "Adapt or die!" will now have to adapt or die?
---
ye that   exact sentiment to a T. i would need  at least 2 weeks free login time before considering coming back to eve
---
its a meme, as in a joke, not an actual thing.
---
They think rollback will fix 3 months of lost sub time? They are fucking wrong, another low effort change. 
---
Let them burn.
---
Absolutely!
---
This comes back to actually adding new and interesting game play, and not just screwing around with core game mechanics and trying to dismantle NS PvE.  
---
I did not hate the local blackout, but you are right.  It was actually a nice way to turn off 98% of excavators and reduce ore volumes.  But they should have had counter play to it, and added features that would encourage the Null blocks to move around and fight and not hunker down even more and defend space.  
---
So many good things they could have done. SOV changed, structure mechanics changed, modify time zone tanking.  Any one of which would actually add drama and movement to NS. 
---
What did they do instead...pull the rug out from under PvE NS players.  Because people that actually subscribe multiple accounts and enjoy spending hours a day undocked are clearly the biggest problem Eve has. :-). 
---
What happened...exactly what everyone who is even a little familiar with PvE would have guessed.  They all fricking left to play other games not even a little bit interested in feeding endlessly for less and less ISK.  
---
I expect that they are going to have problems reassuring these people that they will not have the rug pulled yet again, because why come back if CCP is going to screw you in a different way next month.
---
while this may be the first ship you built from eve... you are definitely not the first person to build some shit from eve. I used to see these and be like "oh. cool, i guess".  but now I just see a tired old cliche and it pisses off some tiny intangible part of me, which in turn annoys me even further for not having access to why that pisses me off.
---
So now you need a new folder and to add them to the ACL for each DED you want to sell.
---
This is the same "Making cooperation easier" excuse for 10 years.  The blue donut is what ruins Eve.  The older the game gets, the more undeniable it becomes. 
---
Elite pve is what rules the game now.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78938678/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78938678/)
---
Why you mad, yo?
---
Now, how quick before Hilmtard :surprisedpikachus: when all of those lost subs don't magically reappear?
---
Current problems with nullsec are  
---
\*No need for communication, you can just put your ESI in third party website and be accepted
---
\*local chat is simply easy intel, During blackout you could sit in staging systems and pick off ratting subcaps in cloaky because they weren't communicating and warning each other about neutral in system
---
\*no diminishing returns, you can simply grow as big as you can and there's no ingame limits for that other than logistics and out of game "FC burn"
---
\*every region is pretty much same, no higher/lesser value places
---
I think to fix null meta on grand level CCP should look at grand strategy games/4x games and see how they set limit to growing too big
---
Booooooooo. Resubbed for blackout. Was fun. Quitting eve again I guess :/
---
Just think of the potential to murder people.
---
Still watching local though.
---
And it was 2.3b before blackout lowered it. So?
---
Your comment assumes that "bitter vets" make the game stagnant LMAO
---
A delay in local would still make sense to me. Cyno  changes i kinda agree with. Not everyship should be able to fit one. So recons. t1 industrials for cheap cynos cool . Maybe battleships with cynos for a more sturdy cyno  and  one that could be utilised to some effect with restrictions. E.G not on domis . Still Blackout killed eve for me . Have not logged in now in just under 3 weeks. Doubt i will be back anytime soon
---
So POSTS om r/eve of all places are what we should pay attention to, and not statistics?
---
Sell access to your list for a monthly fee?
---
After this release it will no longer be possible to sell bookmarks through formal contracts. There will be ways to transfer bookmarks to a seller through a shared folder however, though this will be slightly less convenient as it would require the buyer and seller to be online at the same time to complete the transaction.
---
IMO also hide people who are cloaked from local. You're cloaked, why is your ship telling everyone you're in system with them?
---
Need permission from mommy to resin using her credit card?
---
I don’t want blackout to end 😢
---
Ikr, 3d printing these are such a PITA. I'd love to have an injection mold version
---
Been adapting on and off since 2003 - the BO was something that really could have changed to way we cooperate in nullsec which I am all for. (:
---
“Are you slow?”, said the autist that thinks the effect is the cause.
---
You are so fucking stupid. It’s amazing.
---
MER says different but, I'm glad you and your folk are doing well
---
Ok, but no local in my WH is a choice. I know the risks of WH space and I *chose* to live in there. It wasn't forced upon me by some arbitrary shithead at CCP
---
Because the game shifted from PvPers to Krabs Online and they tried to shift it back.
---
But they can't because too many krabs whined.
---
I used to spend about the same years ago before I quit.  the only difference between Eve and a hobby like I dont know, machining or wood working, is try telling your boss or literally anyone you respect about eve and how much money you spend on it.  yea, didnt think so.
---
Except it's not. Your existence on the other hand....
---
Unless you went to 0.0 security space, then no
---
Are we still concern trolling about EVE losing a bunch of mining alt subs? Can we at least wait for the next blackout to continue that shit meme.
---
Them reversing one of the bandaids in 2 months after they lose like half of their subs is a far cry from thinking they actually care about bad changes, unless they result in a huge profit loss.
---
Amen brother
---
not sure where your looking at, but its not a corp withdrawal.
---
Did they actually dropped Dreads to fight off bombers? Or is there something I'm not seeing on that BR?
---
There used to be a guy who would do a 1 officer neutron blaster vagabond near Old Man Star and would just cloak/mwd around the system and whore on to every fight he possibly could.
---
You're saying everyone in null are krabs now?
---
I guess that's mostly accurate.
---
I just said i dont know why, which makes me even more mad. life is just like that i guess
---
&gt;as a fleet pvp'r who doesn't PVE at all
---
Lmao you're an NPC. It all makes sense now hahahahaha
---
thanks you for the updates
---
it is sad how people with deep irl pockets can shit on real players who actually work for their ships
---
thats actually a good idea
---
I fear the day this is implemented because it will propably massively fuck up bookmarks and if I lose all my safes I will cry
---
I've been running them in a blingy laser legion with lots of fancy piloting and overheating but still have to bounce out on that last wave sometimes. Oh and don't save the Zorya cruiser for last - she will warp off lol.
---
Nope, many people will no longer return.           
---
I logged first time after like 2 weeks today due to this announcement.         
---
I know about people that biomasses chars they will not come back.
---
&gt;  CCP is committed to changing the environment of EVE which in some ways is good as long as it can still give players a reason to log in.  
---
Um.... what.... they lost their balls and reverted a change that got actual players to log in in favor of getting alts and bots back on the books. CCP just continues to show they are driven by profits and bullbear alts and bots pay their bill so thats who they cater to. Small gang players with 1-3 accounts don't bring in the money to justify their voice being heard
---
Tbh i wish i was so young again.
---
Why is everyone trying to destroy my hopes today?
---
Guess it is time to start botting then.
---
I don't like the idea that t3 abyss gives suspect in hisec. Really makes no sense on why you would get suspect, should just be able to do them or not.
---
Uh this could be fun meta show, thanks for reminding.
---
What about the bad features, like Local Blackout?
---
Unfortunately not easily. I had tickets to Eve North but declined to go because of business. I did not get anything because it usually involves a code on a business card given at registration.
---
However, it might be possible to contact someone on the CCP Community Team (if there is anyone) and tell them what happened.
---
Don't get me wrong. I hated the blackout. Really really bad. But not because of the blackout itself, but because how they did it. Also because they split the player base and made a lot people very mad (Salty.... Including myself). But the idea itself was brilliant. They should stop being pissed and should start adapting to the data they collected.
---
So I would wait a bit honestly if you really arent subbed already. It's an interesting play by ccp since they know a lot of 3 month subs end this month
---
&gt;Erasmus
---
So mod is deleting and editing comments to paint me in bad light.  I never defended child porn.  Just saying when you harbour other vile people and write them off as edge lords what do you expect from your lack of moderation that caused CCP to bail from the server.  Then I am told you have porn channels on the discord.  Like seriously what the fuck do you expect from a community that is a worse more raw than this subreddit.
---
So I would recruit you to sit on a gate and look at it for hours. As for alts with current plex prices you would have to make insane tic numbers to justify them.  
---
As I said before big groups were least affected its the small groups and new players that are the most affected.
---
You're absolutely right bro.
---
I'm almost at 100M SP with my main but I was exactly in your position 4 years ago, all the people around me had the SP I have now and I was struggling doing things.
---
It's hard even with the local working, with blackout it simply mean not playing.
---
VNI for example was the perfect ship for people like you, you can rat and make some isks, not for plexing but at least for your ships, your skill books, for enjoying a bit of everything this game has to offer (which is a lot, if CCP let you try it...).
---
Unfortunately VNI was the perfect ship also for bots, and because CCP don't want (yeah you have read well, they don't want) get rid of them you like every other newbro have been sacrificed.
---
Another example is the constant nerf on DED site, which are exactly the next step for new players. 
---
They require a bit of investment but quite reasonable for the reward (and still accessible to intermediate players), they involve different mechanics and push you to expand with other opportunities (for example to train for a JF hauler to sell your ded rewards). 
---
That's sad imho, they are always complaining about the lack of new players and everything they do goes exactly in their wrong direction.
---
Nah, your mom lets me do what I want
---
I really would have preferred another week of blackout to get PLEX under 2.25 mil before they pulled the plug. Bottoming out at 3.25 is not going to double my ISK damn it.
---
That's because Ushra'Kahn
---
This was always advertised as a test where, if it didnt work, it would be reverted
---
Chinese blitzkreig
---
This, or just show people x minutes after they drop gate cloak.
---
Read the name..
---
Dying is the key word. Alas, I only do solo pvp, and I especially like battleships, I buy T1 hulls, including faction. PvP fitted they cost me between 250 - 1200 mill.
---
Lately I have tried to reduce the cost and fly Praxis' a lot (great tank and great DPS at a relatively low cost). Though Raven is perhaps my favourite bs. I roam all over the place and get killed almost every time due to the fact that I am all alone, I don't even use an alt to scout or scram or rep or anything. Blindly I fly, but I rely on zkill for intel to avoid blobs. 
---
I like it that way. If I am lucky I survive one or two fights, get some kills, but die in the third. Story of my solo PvP life.
---
So, 39.99 euros I get about 4.5 bill ISK. That's gone in one week if I play more than usual. And occasionally I fall prey to CCP propaganda and buy that fancy skin for, say, my Raven, and suddenly I am out of ISK in a couple of days...
---
Why solo PvP? Apart from loving the challenge, my RL obligations (family, kids, work) make my time quite limited, and solo pvp is about what is feasible. If I were to join a corp, I would feel the social mechanics called participation, and I would just disappoint them.
---
CCP's Era of Retardation was the push I needed to look into some older hobbies, and I'm finding I'm enjoying them much more than that shit state EVE is in these days.  Sorry CCP, but fuck you.
---
It just needs tweaks. Occupancy sov good, sov wanding clownshoes is probably bad.
---
"real players" my ass. Dumbest comment I've seen today, and this is saying something
---
Does anyone know if this happened before or after our president called the leader of Egypt “my favorite dictator” and the entire room got real quiet?
---
Mining and ratting in blackout are very different beasts. You can mine for hours and unless someone gets within dscan range of you nobody will ever know you are there. Within 30 minutes of you ratting everyone in the entire universe knows your there. Blackout primarily effected mining by making untenable to use excavators. It effected ratting by making it near impossible in anything but a super or Titan.
---
But that is absolutely not what these people wanted to do.  As much as it bothers a group of people that play Eve, the people that are part of big alliances, that PvE, want to be be where they are.  
---
People that don’t want to be, and PvE, are already renters, in HS, or hiding in WHs.  Each a completely different flavor of gameplay.  In a sandbox people gravitate to the play they enjoy.  
---
This comes back to a difference of opinion about Eve.  You can change NS to be more like WH, but will people actually want to play it in any real number.  People that like that part of the sand box are already there...in WHs.  
---
If you make NS in WH space (no local, no asset safety, no cyno or super capital projection) and you have 60% of NS people (random number but actually a pretty good guess) decide to leave, and absolutely no ability to keep new players, how long will this ‘better’ Eve actually stick around. 
---
As much as it ruffles the feathers of leet PvP type folk, if you can’t replace your players every few months with new ones, you actually have to make a game that your player base wants to play.
---
WHAAAT?!!! You mean I need to actually think to avoid risks? UNACCEPTABLE! DOWNVOTED!
---
They need to reduce the size of industrials to fit in a BR and or add a covert dst.   Maybe add a covert destroyer that can light a regular cyno. The SP barrier for cynos is a bit high IMHO.
---
If you look at hilmar's statements it's pretty clear there was no "instant more members" option on the table at any point.
---
Yeah Honest answer
---
Someone said INIT didn't do this. They flew this fleet for more than just shooting keepstars. I was on a fleet where Pando did something similar. We would boosh through the enemy fleet firing the whole time and damage would accelerate as we got closer. I literally said on coms "you guys should call this Doppler fleet"
---
What can you expect when game design is dictated by Hilmar and what Eve tells him in his dreams.
---
Hey, I just started playing again after years away. Are Test and Goons back to being Freedom Friends, or do they still hate one another?
---
It's your expectations that were broken during blackout not the risk vs reward. You were not entitled to anything more than you already get in null.
---
They actually were under control, we were stopping seeing the skyrocketing isk/ore availability that led to staglfation (isk and ore inflation making everything worthless except AT ships)
---
There's 2 ways to combat that: massive hit on all faucets, and massive increase in destruction. Personally, I'd prefer incentives to get big blocs to actually go to war and blow up like 5000 dreads a month, but hey.
---
I actually think they shouldn't be there, but if you are willing to take the risk- then yea, go ahead.
---
I feel similarly.  Blackout was interesting to me, and I enjoyed it.  Honestly, I was wondering if NS was getting too safe, and blackout helped make it feel like "Yes, you are actually playing eve at a harder mode than if you had never left HS"      Explo for ISK certainly felt more touch and go (Only lost one CovOps during the blackout, and that one for being a nob and not being smart)  Sov fights required a lot more scouting to know where enemy fleets were.  
---
   
---
At the same time, there was no one doing any mining/industry stuff last night.  I dropped into our main mining site, there was only one other person in the belt.  Previously there had been twenty people.  That did not feel right.  And a lot of the fights in defense fleets felt redundant: Bomber fleet after bomber fleet.   I have never really ratted for ISK, but it seemed like that was drying up as well.  Fewer on comms, fewer getting into fleets even for good content.  IT was... saddening.
---
I don't want blackout to go away permanently, and if it is seasonal or structure based or something I would be okay,   Having it back is going to feel odd.
---
Yep we will see how many extractors were used \^\_\^.
---
CCP BURGER said they can always roll back. Huhuahua we will see, we will see ;D
---
5 min delay, so you cant cloaky camp but you still have enough time to catch something. Also increases the importance of scouts as a ship moving at a decent clip will not show up on intel otherwise.
---
Worse. With beacons, goons will bridge in a recon and cyno up for supers. A rorq can insta panic when a neut jumps in and have 50 titans on it by the time it can be shot. 
---
that said delayed local or smth is actually not bad
---
Mumble, man
---
There were effectively more targets because with perfect intel and near2 the vast majority would stop crabbing before you were even in their pocket.
---
It's still a thing, but the responses you get are wildly varied. I've had groups drop a cap on me, come after me in a stream of full-dps Hecates, form 50 drakes, or send a single burst-jamming malediction. I've had people do nothing, too.
---
No...just disproportionately the ones that had their game dismantled over the last few months, and left.  Crazy how that goes.
---
There are many of us that are business oriented that will inherently understand that concept and just as many who will not. You made it very clear in your OP that you were coming from a business perspective. If this fella was going to comprehend he would already done so.
---
Cheers for a great reply on what I can expect.
---
&gt; when did I say not to live in low or wormhole space?
---
When i repeatedly mentioned them as options and you ignored them entirely in any and all of your comments.

---
When I said it was 5:1, perhaps you think I simply meant "slightly outnumbered".  I did not.  
---
It's one thing to ping and get overwhelming interest such that the fleet you flash form outnumbers your foe.  It's another to sit in the keep for 30 minutes just to ensure you outnumber the enemy 5:1.  As you can see from the BR, you even coordinated with a completely different entity just to blob some gilas looking for content. 
---
No, I'm not going to tell you that you should expect any kind of "fun brawl".  I doubt anyone who knows that they're doing really bothers anymore. I haven't bothered trying to fight TAPI since roaming to one of your deployment stagings in BL, where you did exactly the same thing.
---
If you want to just blob the shit out of everyone looking to get in a fun fleet engagement, then that's fine - but when you become famous for it, you should probably be prepared to suck it up and own the reputation.
---
Just remove them tbh, you have belts and moons. Why the fuck else do we have asteroid belts?
---
Would make good truesec systems worth more too
---
60 seconds on jump in
---
We are the future. In 10 years the biggest hobby on Earth will be gaming, maybe even as soon as next year. The old I-have-never-played-a-video-game-in-my-life is not the standard you ought to measure yourself against, or for that matter, judge yourself.
---
Yeah the highsec numbers are are a little lower but the percent of total quite a bit higher.
---
They deserve credit if it lasted for 2 weeks. After those two weeks it was clear that BO does more harm than good.
---
They're using battleship sized missile launchers on a cruiser hull.
---
I'm trying to imagine being so compelled to play Eve rather than innumerable other entertainment options available you'd continue even if you didn't enjoy it anymore.
---
Me too friend on all points friend.
---
Yea, maybe I was being a little conservative ) 
---
5 min is good, maybe a wee bit strong? 3min? Give enough time for a ceptor to burn around systems, or a cruiser to warp around system. 
---
And yea I really like the effect on scouting / intel that this would provide.
---
Sounds good bud.
---
&gt; sets eso green
---
what does that mean?
---
Correct.  What's missing here is the other perspective, which is unsurprising as most wormholers are autistic and lacking the other's perspective is one of the symptoms.
---
I lose my ships all the time. I am not good at PvP, I just like it and do my best in the short amount of time RL grants me. Apparently everyone takes a shit on me, maybe even you.
---
I cannot comment on that shit. 
---
All I know is that my corp died after blackout because we didn't have enough players to provide security for mining ops, so the income dried up and we got fucked.
---
This was kind of my original point. By trying to decrease botting which was leading to isk inflation, they also made it much harder for legitimate players to make isk, which financially, imho, is a cure worse than the disease.
---
I think they would probably have been better just letting the currency inflate, although whether you could get hyperinflation in a virtual currency backed by infinitely reproducable goods is a question I don't have a degree to answer.
---
Consumer price index in a month dropped as much as it has been risen in a year. A year of prosperity is being destroyed in a month. Thats not how CCP should balance the game
---
The game died when they did that super fucked up million SP "give away".   They alienated single, casual player and rewarded the lifeless hoard of reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  
---
Now that the cant keep plexing all their accounts from skill injectors they're dying out, only actual players like my friends and I left and arnt coming back.  
---
inb4  hurhur nothing of value was lost herp derp something something whiny cuck hibidy hobidy hip chip dip or whatever it is you autistic screechers say
---
Or just one week out of the year have blackout like 'the purge'
---
With the exception of a minor portion of the game, everyone's pretty much having a great time. There's literally so much shit to do. Invasions, incursions, wormholes, exploration, plexes, escalations, filaments, and of course PvP. I basically never log in and don't have something going on in Corp discord. And I'm in a small Corp.
---
Honestly, I think eve is old enough that it should broadly stay the same. People like it, they are devoted to it. They might not get alot of new players, but the ones they do have sink alot of effort in.
---
The rest of us are waiting for those first buy-orders to hit the markets so we can dump the downswing goods we collected while nobody else was buying
---
the irony of a tapi flair calling people cowards isnt lost on me
---
Hey if you like old people I won't judge you
---
&gt; 10minute timer delay on appearing in local after gatefire.
---
Alternatively you appear once you decloak after gatejumping.
---
Not going to lie this was my back in 2007
---
Seems like a majority of nullsec live in hisec with alts seeing how empty null is unless they are deployed.
---
So.. yes?
---
Too bad caldari ships and 'adding polygons' in c4d doesn't work. I can print at .1 resolution but the printer would probably Break first 
---
I'm using a hypercube evolution with dual z axis and direct drive and a smoothie board in case you are wondering
---
If I were in charge of "Chaos Era" I would've introduced a local delay of X seconds, then instead of just nuking cynos, introduce a delay, where anything jumping/bridging to a cyno is delayed by a multiplier of the ship's align time. So if your Nyx has an align of 30s, say it'd take 60s for it to come through a cyno. Or something. Then you couldn't just perfectly position your caps where you want them on the field, you'd have to either warp them in from off-grid or protect your cyno ship. Obviously you'd have to give JFs a role bonus that removes the delay.
---
"The people leaving this game and complaining bitterly are the first lot."
---
This statement is incorrect.
---
Wormholes have no local, no asset safety, and no super umbrella.
---
PA strikes Hilmar's blackout doing way over 9000 damage
---
Does that mean less changes of finding data and relic sites?
---
May want to add that "players maximizing risk/reward and avoiding PvP where possible". The mentality of players currently is at least as big a problem as any individual game mechanic, if not more. I've pointed to perimeter many times in recent memory but it's the perfect example: mechanics suggest the big blocs fight over a single resource, big blocs instead make agreements to avoid PvP for the sake of passive ISK that nobody can oppose or interrupt. Players doing that is a *very* bad signal for the state of the game.
---
Wew lad
---
Make d-scan a more nuanced tool with the 64bit changes, and make cloaks an on-grid instrument more than an off-grid instrument.  
---
Cloaks are just space ranger/assassin classes.  That's it.  We can't pretend that no game developer has ever solved the problem of balancing a stealthy unit.  CCP is just moribund, decides everything is an NP-hard problem and that the players will figure it out with sufficient frequency to produce actual gameplay and interaction.  The statistics they compile show, empirically, that is false.  NP-hard problems are "solved" with data clustering, ie cheating.  We all do it everyday.
---
Could it be a blackmail scam?
---
.... Just remove Concord for a day. And do a Burn Jita at this day, too!
---
I quit over the million SP bullshit anniversary event.  Even convinced my corp mates to leave to.  It's probably less than a rounding error in their revenue, but CCP has already lost over $100 from us since the event.  
---
My point being crazies shit has happened.
---
Let the uncontrolled completely unhealthy inflows of ISK resume!
---
How and where do you sell escalations? Every now and then I get one above my pay grade I have to ignore. I'd be down to sell them.
---
And hole control and no hot drops. Wormholes are the safest and best place to make money now. Check the MER.
---
Oooooo I like this '*steeples hands laughing manically*'
---
This will be interesting..  *warms up the popcorn maker*
---
You have spoken wisely! Many thanks!
---
&gt; Has inflation gotten that bad in a year?
---
No.  Eve has seen deflation in every other aspect.  Plex goes up because is seen as a safe investment as everything else has dropped in price and because injectors and skill farms and alts are a thing.
---
Probably very hard to implement with the way they changed local. In a perfect world, maybe? But there should be a fuel requirement for cov ops cloaks to inhibit afk cloaky camping.
---
It wasn't the Reddit posts that changed this back, it was the trend in CCPs income. Less logins means less subscriptions. Less logins means less injectors being purchased. Less injected characters means less Plex purchases. They could care less about Reddit posts and votes but like every company they care about $/euro/etc.
---
it is simple.  CCP didn't really have a plan.  FUCKING CHAOS! yea baby!
---
Baseball learned years ago that it's far easier to lose fan base than to earn it back.
---
\*cough\*Gillette\*cough\*
---
This whole situation is frustrating to me because, after a month of blackout, I spent a huge amount of isk moving to another area and method of making the moneys. I just hope things stay static this time. If it looks like I need to move again, I'm done.
---
I used to have a highsec ganking alt dedicated to bringing pain.
---
So you think they should do?

I was looking to get that mouse mat, do you recommend?
---
Do you have a more detailed guide or video implementing your fit that you could point me to?
---
I know that feeling when your internet dies
---
The reinstatement of local relieves pressure on sub-cap mining/rating while maintaining pressure on capitals. A good thing. Will it regain customers? Maybe if the "Customer Recovery Opportunity" has not expired CCP can regain some.
---
Injection molding ships that match the models of EVE ships would be very difficult. There are a lot of over/underhand features that requires expensive molds to replicate.
---
*bookmarks death star pos, makes it public as a safe spot*
---
I agree on having a structure for local communications would be very good. It would add strategic depth to system holding and would made systems without it more risky places.
---
K.
---
1. Buy the bookmarks
---
2. Sell them yourself
---
3. Blow up the person who buys them
---
i try to make one, but its really easy. Just kill the neuting ships first and on Wave 3 focus the Cruiser &gt; destroyers &gt; neuting
---
Definitely! I've had this one for years, many coffee and water related incidents and it still looks brand new. Also after years of use theres no visible wear near the mouse area which is quite impressive imo
---
I mean i murder people now.
---
"we will also see the return of some legitimate players who left following blackout because they could not manage to play without local"
---
fuck that.  why would you come back to a game where the devs are happy to just throw shit at the wall without a plan?
---
Against stukas with mjd destroyers you are toast. You will be outmaneuvered by a competent fc. You need instant damage. Thwy can just mjd away from your missiles while they fly to you.
---
Okay, I'm going to start by saying that I love everything you're doing with this change. It's consistent with other mechanics and it will make a lot of things in Eve much better. The ability to share all the tactical bookmarks 
---
BUT
---
It also feels like in doing this, you're taking away a lot of options. I'm big on emergent gameplay and seeing people finding creative ways to do unique things in Eve, and this change--at first glance--looks to be sacrificing a fair bit of that in order to improve the mainstream use of bookmarks.
---
If the conversation hasn't been had already at CCP, maybe you guys should discuss the viability of some sort of market scheme to sell places on access lists. Assuming you're using the same system as citadels, that would mean the ability to purchase and/or subscribe to docking rights.
---
No, because the bigger null blocs could just come in and steamroll everyone. Make the blackout permanent in other places but not their own.
---
Problem with instant, perfect intel you cannot avoid is that you can't adapt to it.
---
That's one hell of a defeatist standpoint. No need to "antagonize" what's left, so no making changes to a stale null, focus on the PvE centric players that'll eventually bore themselves out of the game. You're getting upvoted because this is r/eve and the majority here upvote anything bad for the game, but it's impossible to argue the state of null as it was pre-blackout (and will return to now) is bad for the game and *some* change is needed.
---
in 10 years? no, it's already the biggest hobby, no question about it.  it has almost no entry barrier. those people who wont respect you for being a gamer, also just dont care that you are a gamer, and may be gamers themselves.  it's just not going to garner the same sort of curiosity and respect as a more substantial hobby such as, I don't know, building cars. in my experience at least.but then again im not the sort of person to sugar coat things, just try to see things for what they are.  it's like the whole furry situation.  no one can seriously believe that furries will be included as a normal part of society at any point in the future.  it's just, so apparent and obvious.  now does saying that make me a furry hater or just honest?
---
what a shit show
---
Some, not all. Plenty of these players will have had their faith in CCP shaken and may never come back
---
Yeah I printed a Nid before, I actually had to manually edit the entire 3D model to expand the thin walls. Took foreeeeeeeever lol
---
hahahahahahaha
---
Agreed. Random is the way. Chaos for everyone. Everywhere. But not against just one part of New Eden. For everyone!
---
Aaaaaaaand unsubbed.
---
Awesome. Thanks dude.
---
They had to try it and I’m sure they will learn from it. Honestly no local was not too bad for goons but it was killing the areas around us
---
but will they get rid of the infuriating delay when copying bookmarks, though?
---
It took less time to put people on the actual moon than SC has taken so far...
---
Poor guy :(

That will work!

Technically, agreeing or not with changes made to the game IS his prerogative, as it is the one of every player. What he can do if he disagrees is limited, though.

Pretend that flair doesn’t always match the alliance people post from for 30seconds before knee-jerk responding.

Is it safe to resub now? 
---
LOL. You never fail.
---
My last account was to expired on march 2020 (got a 1 year sub) but all others expired already.       
---
Now need to resub them.
---
Im just getting into trig escalations.
---
I really hope it was the internet connection
---
If it means helping out, then yes. Hopefully my mates will do the same for me. Just as some people take the role as a scout in a fleet, or a FC, or logi bros who doesnt even get on killmails. For me it is all about the meaning of what and why I am doing the things I do. "Back in the days" I ran mining ops with a corporation and some mined, others were security. All of us still had a good sense of purpose and a fun role to play. Being a scout is a fun role for some if it is giving something in return, for example your coporation making ISK and hopefully sharing that ISK with everyone involved in helping to get that ISK. :)
---
eso is short for Esoteria, TESTs home region.
---
green and red are the names for the on and off states for when we can do save fleets for tackled rorqs/caps. If you get tackled when eso is red then you can't be saved since the FCs and linemembers are busy with strategic stuff.
---
Why would it
---
lelob is right
---
&gt;Have not logged in now in just under 3 weeks. Doubt i will be back anytime soon
---
Congratulations on winning Eve!
---
People talking mad shit in local when something almost happens and they see someone they don’t like is one of the greatest entertaining pendulum swings in eve.
---
I'm hopeful the non-bots weren't away long enough and will come back.
---
[So immersive.](https://i.imgur.com/wmiz8A8.mp4)
---
Awesome, I laughed!
---
Tbf, I think they needed at least a month of data to see what was happening.  I'm glad they switched it now instead of waiting until November.
---
There is a video too https://youtu.be/LDU_Txk06tM
---
These are the best kills.
---
well I was going to come back...but not now.
---
Easier. The very action of looking for targets is content and no local meant you could actually play hide and seek. Now it's back to everyone knowing exactly where someone is 100% of the time with zero effort or time required. 
---
Guess it's back to afk camping.
---
Those are all horrible ideas.
---
And just so you know, Navy frigs and Cruisers are great for PVP, not sure wtf you are talking about.
---
I don't rat bud, like i stated multiple times.       
---
Simply to say if i wanted to play in "wormholes" i would play there long time ago ^(tbh i had my WH years ago and hated it).       
---
This is quite simple if you don't like product - don't buy it.            
---
I am way to old to care about being 1337 or 'important' in spaceship game.       
---
Game need to be fun and appealing.              
---
Eve Blackout was ... fuck not this shit again.             
---
But hey you know what ?              
---
**WH community proved that even if they sub all those accounts they constantly posted about on r/eve ... they cannot support this game in terms of income needed for maintaining it.**
---
Him saying 'so close' is hardly shittalking.
---
Ah so youre going to make claims without providing the evidence yourself.
---
Got it.
---
Hey did you see that twitch stream where mittani actually revealed he was gobbins all along?
---
It was crazy!
---
That's how CCP will win eve. #elite
---
The whole point of trying things is to stop if it turns out to be a bad idea. It turned out to be a bad idea.
---
If you quit why you use the extractors if you don't intend to RMT stuff out?
---
We need delayed local, a happy medium. The super passive and easy playstyle shouldn't be a thing in nullsec. But  I don't like being at the mercy of hunters as a solo null diver, died to site campers twice.
---
For that dipped Italian beef Yum
---
so introduce isk sinks, some expensive factions for 200b each, thatll balance the MER as the average inflation was around .25 tril a month
---
Then explain the drop in users sperglord. Bots are still there enmasse.
---
Test to see if nullbears would ragequit
---
This trig pve makes me wish I had some characters with a positive sec status so I could give it a whirl. Maybe will try some abyssals in null, though they seem less enticing.
---
Because they materialize out of thin air due to [spod brain excuse that grasps at straws using some obscure sentence in a lore article]
---
I'd rather CCP tried something new like revamping anoms so they're harder to solo and require intelligent input to counter bots rather than do a watered down blackout.
---
That’s what I’m trying to figure out you retard. Yes there is a drop. But why is blackout causing the drop? What about it is causing people to leave,
---
Many people did this.       
---
Like i played SETTLERS 1 again :D       
---
Found Master Of Orion and similar stuff.            
---
**Imagine yourself how small the WH community is**        
---
They subbed all those extra accounts yet didn't manage to generate enough income for CCP to get the $$ to maintain the game.
---
I've literally told you where to find it.
---
Are you too retarded to watch a podcast?
---
EVE down under had sent people their code vial enail after the event.... 
---
But i am at g fleet.... they have given me a card.... 
---
Pm me and i could chase it up for you tonight at the party?
---
CCP explicitly said they were testing things with the blackout. Not sure where your complaint is coming from.
---
That sounds like more than two days of developing time so its probably not gonna happen :(
---
Boost them a bit, migrate big part of the LP to ISK when you get the BPC or hull from LP store.
---
lol, nice one.
---
Only show up if you stay in the same system for more than 3-5 minutes that'd be ok.
---
That just makes no sense. How would lack of local do anything in jita? In highsec, where there's threats everywhere and you're not allowed to act first against possible threats?
---
Will there be any API connections for it? If nothing else, need to be able to track who added what to the shares folders.
---
ExookiZ &gt; nice
---
too many layers
---
Are you too retarded to source your claims?
---
TDBIN strikes again
---
You wouldn’t hear me complaining ))
---
CCP released stats showing a 90% reduction in detected isk from botting activities. At the same time, prices on a wide range of items either went down or stopped going up, indicating an end to inflation.
---
Nobody is forcing him to work for CCP
---
Also a very cool idea!
---
What a poorly reheated take.
---
Man that news from CCP is ruining my enjoyment of WoW Classic :(
---
I want CCP to start at some small number, and then iterate until there is a healthy balance for the hunters and the krabs.
---
No more of this all-or-nothing mentality that seems to apply to their game design on the whole.
---
Exactly, but I guess its always going to be a problem in a sandbox game with no "endgoal". Many players just make owning as much isk as possible their endgoal and do everything to get to it and in some ways that is "correct" way to go, as if you have a lot of money you can have a lot more fun.
---
Another problem concerning mindset of players is mindset of nullsec players who feel entitled to be able to undock and rat safely every day, nowhere else in any other space except highsec can you expect to be safe while doing your "dailies".  DED sites for me are great example of good PVE content, where you have to actively look for it and rewards are usually correspondent to the risk
---
Falcon's facial expression on the launcher isn't accurate anymore.
---
Good shout, test the system and act on the results, rather than just ignoring it )
---
Integrated... Da!
---
Well actually who knows now.        
---
Like CCP tried "the cheap fixes" by shuffling 1/0 in the database and it didn't work.        
---
What more ... it actually costed them probably much more in terms of lost income than a year ^(or years) of development time they need to actually spend now in solving the issues.           
---
What more they will not recover all lost people so 'the bottom line' each month will remind them about this fact.             
---
So who knows maybe this Blackout will actually bring a lot of good to the game in long term.
---
Unlimited isk faucets -&gt; massive inflation for anything that can't be mined. AT ships and plex have been skyrocketing for the last 2 years or so, and only came into line when blackout was introduced. Now they're gonna go back to skyrocketing. Rip. 
---
Blackout Eve was a different game. It was a game with diminished expectations; yeah, you couldn't just go out and 24box rorqmine a titan in 6 hours anymore. You'd have to be content with less. But you could also hop out and get a 1v1 in a t1 cruiser again; you weren't as limited to "ratting or stratop" content.
---
&gt; CCP just continues to show they are driven by profits
---
that is what companies are supposed to do, yes.
---
Hilmar talks a lot about game design and his design theory in this https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/07/ccp-blackout-interview/
---
One of the points is that the way to fight bots is to build deep gameplay system that require intelligent human input, instead of monotonous repetitive tasks. Obviously EVE is very susceptible to botting because of its point and click interface.
---
Hah, I never played wow, in fact eve is the only mmo I have played for longer than a month or so, but I’ve heard the hype surrounding Classic.
---
Resubbing 3 accounts on monday
---
Submit a bug report, going to be your best option I think
---
I too want programmers to do ship balance changes! What could possibly go wrong.
---
I made a way too loud happy cry in voice chat today.
---
I was a little bit ashamed. But when I was told, I was not the first one today, it made me feel better.
---
Even as someone who literally only logs on EVE to shoot PvErs, it blows my mind that they would introduce blackout without also changing up the reward structure of null-sec.
---
In that one interview they literally said "now that the faucet has been turned off, we can start working on adding rewards back in" -- I dunno, retards, maybe you should have done both of those things at the same time?
---
Thanks for the link, bud! I’ll check it out.
---
I was under the impression that it would be a fight between those who wanted the blackout for everyone in null, and those who didn't. Which would be awesome.
---
Woah, almost sounds like CCP needs to do smaller, iterative changes in order to find a healthy balance for the game.
---
Would be stupid to not RMT Your account/assets if u are quiting right? Its like a lot of work you put into your toon. Its only CCP fault to make shitty changes.
---
Pohds is back
---
i just see it that this way people would have to pull resources out of their fortifications that way.  thus opening up themselves to be farmed at home more
---
i wonder how many people switched to whs
---
People biomassed chars with 150mil + sp on them.         
---
You don't have to RMT out ...
---
Absolutely, there were a bunch of tweaks thay could have done other than blackout. However, since I don't work at CCP and i'm not an economist, I can't really say as to their thinking. They may have been concerned that if they didn't make botting harder the bots would earn more money, buy more bot accounts and subsume the entire game which would ultimately destabilise the entire currency or something.
---
Dunno what they are going to do when blackout ends, maybe they have gotten some AI help? It seems like the kind of problem you could let an AI lose on with reasonable results. (Not that I actually know anything about that.. =)
---
Then they should have invested time to change how null-sec PvE works to make it more lucrative. Instead of a slow trickle of constant ISK/hr they should have made null-sec PvE more like "put your ass on the line for two hours and hit an ISK geyser"
---
Did you picked it up?
---
Null entities usually have people who spend all day running escalations for people.
---
&gt;c neckbeards screeching at him over a 16 year old videogame mayb
---
oi, I don't screech, my voice is bloody lovely thank you.
---
Was that you in the rorqs?
---
perhaps delayed local instead
---
You can also not reveal that you're in system before you even load.  
---
It's the difference of the hunter getting a 15 second head start vs the prey getting a 15s head start.
---
Wreck was destroyed
---
You are though?  Escalations still require you being in space.
---
\&gt;goonswarm federation
---
Hoping that's flairbait.
---
hmmmm.  Weird decision making at CCP for sure.
---
No this is way too powerful. It makes the hunters job too easy and it encourages people to stay clumped up which is not what we want.
---
was waiting for that
---
why should I pretend that?  There is a flair.  There is literally no indication I should take it to mean "I am NOT in Brave".
---
remove local
---
Heh, you know you guys love us.
---
ever thought about enlisting with NER? 
---
your reports are great
---
Why should new players immediately start in null sec?
---
Probably make supers and titans easier to build, if I had to guess.
---
Doesn't EVE run on the CPI?
---
Price of carbon going up.
---
what were you waiting for? its been two months.
---
If you're in a group you can easily sell it
---
What you need to do is go to the system your escalation is in, warp to it through the agency, bookmark the acceleration gate and that's the hard part done.
---
You go back to your home, drag out the bookmark from your "people n places" window and make a contract from the item hangar. Sell to alliance/Corp
---
:P
---
That's kinda what I thought.
---
Bad players lost. Better Eve
---
What’s better, universal local with a structure to disable it per system, or universal blackout with a structure to enable it?  I agree that the space owner should control it.
---
Blackout ending has me unsubbing again, it was fun while it lasted.
---
)
---
Only problem I have with FW is the disproportionate emphasis on frig PvP, which I personally don't find very engaging
---
Some other chaos event will take it's place.  Hillmar won't give up on Chaos this easily I'll bet.
---
Make sense please.
---
So maybe in the end CCP did a good change? They let some addicted people go? :D
---
Thanks for making me ugly cry hah...
---
His name is in his Reddit username, corp is Sniggwaffe
---
You built it in real because you know deep inside that you can't do it in-game.
---
I tried to make a translated version but I'm poor in English hope it will help.

How much forever did it took? Really curious
---
How exactly does giving someone so for free alienate them...?
---
fucking retards
---
No Hot Drops: What exactly do you think a hole rolled into ratting ground equates to.
---
Hole Control: Can be done sure, takes a fair amount of effort.
---
Wormholes are great for making ISK, absolutely. They also come with risk. Null is second only to wormholes in reward and carried far less risk before Chaos Era.
---
They're friendly, but you won't hear any of them admit that
---
seems pretty accurate to me
---

So long as you can modify the acl from space, and the changes are applied near instantly this is 1000x better than the current system.  o/

Thank you for like my reports, and what is NER?

When I do it, it’s catching, not fishing.

That being said, you’re not wrong.

I will be very surprised and grateful if they implement so much as a single section of it.

A word of advice: absolutely none of the whining you read in this subreddit will affect you for a very long time, and by the time it does, you won't care about 90% of it.
---
i seriously havent seen any change in botting activity, i have seen lots of bots during the blackout.. maby it's just because i go around WinterCo space but i honestly dont think this hit botting very much.

Nice kill!

So then according to [https://zkillboard.com/character/1524136743/](https://zkillboard.com/character/1524136743/)  the last kills he got were September 7th (6 ships and a mtu) and before that was September 2nd (7 ships). And one kill on August 26th.
---
So the whole "every night we go out and get 5-20 fights in our 10-30 people" sounds like total BS...
---
as a Jesus Fucking Christ?
---
They made a series of big ham handed sloppy moves that anyone that understood even the basic outline of NS and PvE wound have known the results.  People initially docking up, and then when it did not go away, left in droves.  Full stop. 
---
The only question was how completely PvE would shut down (turns out very completely outside of Delve), and how many people will actually come back and how many people will just move on.  Time will tell about the last one. 
---
All that it accomplished was pissing off a good chunk of the paying customers and shift the meta away from excavators and super ratting for a few months.  Not sure if the trade was worth it.   
---
I hope they spend a little time actually fixing the real problems.  SOV, structure mechanics, TZ tanking.  Do that any people will actually have reasons to undock and blow stuff up.
---
Swiggity Swooty...
---
Idk if thoose Bots are automated, but I have my Server setup so that @everyone cannot write, they first have to click a link and do a recaptcha to get a role with that they can write. (Thanks Modulo Bot)
---
what about botting?whatch period basis next week
---
The community who would enjoy blackout didn't get small in a vacuum. It took 5 years of catering to nullsec pve'rs to do so. Nullsec linemember population was once a much smaller percentage of this game.
---
Keep it up
---
It should be delayed...
---
Passive mining income (pos mining), now that was a content generator, at least on the periphery of empires. You wanted to annoy/create a fight/seize guaranteed income, you poked the poses.
---
Explain this crab thing
---
I really wanna join one of your fleets one day, keep up the good work.
---
How many hours in a gas mining tengu to break even?
---
I think many worholers btw and nullsec btw can agree with your tldr. A new middle ground for hunters and PVE guys would be nice.
---
It's 1000km not 100km.
---
I heard issues with Mac users having WINE issues since the patch as well.
---
no
---
just delete them honestly.
---
Its 1000km, and its fine. 
---
Great content generator to see a gang of people camping an abyssal trace, and just be like yo lets nuke this
---
I actually found solo pvp content in null during blackout and managed to sneak up on a few miners, never would have been possible before.
---
Oh right, I was going up eve-Uni for numbers
---
“No Gates, Stations or mobile depots at less than 100 km.
---
No other Abyssal trace at less than 1000 km.”
---
Thanks b
---
&gt; So the whole "every night we go out and get 5-20 fights in our 10-30 people" sounds like total BS..
---
Or just [check the corp killboard](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/116777001/) because some of us get busy? I haven't been able to play for two weeks either because of board exams
---
I dunno. I guess I'm the only person that didn't mind blackout, but really disliked the hamfisted approach to Cyno changes.
---
So hunters get perfect intel while the ones being hunted don't? Seems a little lopsided. Blackout or not, it affected both sides equally. I'm not against your idea, but it should take the same amount of time for local to populate for both the hunters and the hunted. (Local shouldn't appear for you, until you appear in local.)
---
Awesome, cheers. Thought that iron bank Ishtar’s trace was only 200k off the keep yesterday but must have been mistaken )
---
period basis went from 100 bots at any time to 0...wtf u talking about mate?but yeah sov holders didnt liked blackout v much,no renters to pay za iskie
---
Had another redditer comment about being able to out me in contact with someone so hopefully they pull through it'll be awesome this is why I love thic community and am not too upset about not making it because my irl isk was spent helping others get to go :)
---
how did they know that  the titan/super ratting was supposed to be banned for week,who warned them about  blackout-end ?
---
I thought it was a nice improvement and brought some engagement back to my play style, with local coming back, null will be back on my blacklist of places to solo hunt.
---
Since then null has REALLY stagnated. Plus there may or may not be a Corp MC server he keeps crashing....
---
I totally agree with you about that we need a change, actually multiple changes. I was like "heck we need a change, any change at all, YES!" when I first heard the coming of blackout. My PvP encounters while exploring tripled, maybe even more to my enjoyment. But let's agree on this: BO didn't end well at all. Appearantly this was not the change the people has needed. What we, all of us, absolutely need is more players. Nothing is more important than this. And after that, substantial amount of new content. I mean game changing type of content. Not a new type of incursion with a different skin or some another patch here and there.
---
I've told you the source, several times.
---
Go and watch it.
---
+1 unsub but that's mostly because usd/monopoly money conversion rates are all over the place these days, and i won't grind for plex now that local has brought my slow burning project to a halt.
---
i'm looking forward to other changes in this direction though
---
Disappointed. But not surprised.
---
We burn the wreck down immediately. We had no way to exfil with it, and the plan was always to kill it.
---
You able to print Ikitursas? I'd love one of those
---
Universal blackout + structure for local. Only for null ofc.

---
This.  If you compare Trade in each region in July to August and run the delta and a % change, then the totals are 883T in July, 725T in August, and a change of -18%.
---
There are some positive regions too ofc

Pm sent
---
I have the feeling this post is not gonna get the upvotes it deserves
---
So we waited, we saw. How do you feel?
---
Awesome idea! Kill FW even more!
---
A player after my own heart.
---
One could argue that having the unhappy ones leave may be beneficial long term as their negativity drowns out the good things.
---
The fact thats its actually 1000 means that you could not of possibly observed what you said you did. Whats your game mate
---
Local that is neither instant or relies purely on gate activity would be an interesting change to local without having the whiplash effect the blackout did to everything.
---
So things such blopsing becomes an interesting method as they are hidden to everything but Dscan and actually appearing on grid. So hunters can be tracked, but is it 10 lokis or 200 bombers on the back of that hunter...
---
the retard in charge at CCP(aka SEAGUL)turned eve in FARMVILLE...the damage is done.
---
Your shifit caps would probably die less often though, keeping mineral prices down. Lelob is good for eve and Brave.
---
Citadels (tether, low power, timers, interior skins, exterior skins?), general fine-tune hull and weapon balancing, lowsec love, likely more cyno adjustments bounty revamp, npe work... probably in that order of priority.
---
That'd go a really long fucking ways towards "fixing" Eve.
---
&gt;But since the bloc has the ... highest concentration of subs...  
---
&gt; And you wonder why you can't retain players. 
---
Which one is it? Either null-blocs are a thing that bring players to the game, or they're not.
---
Wormholer, btw, but I've lived in null more than enough times, and every part of space for that matter, to know that the whole cry of "null-bloc blue doughnut = bad" is a one-dimensional misread of any grievance you can come up with for the game. The alliance wars and empire building have been some of the largest selling points for people to play eve since eve became a thing. It's cool if you don't care for it, but you'll get a lot farther showing them that with your hardpoints.
---
also lolol:
---
&gt; Meanwhile all those loyal to the game keep the game moving forward until their tedium is too much. 
---
a comment whinging about tedium while complaining about a change designed to specifically remove tedium from the game.
---
Most of reddit swarm mind should be happy today, so it has a chance... I mean, we have to complain about something.
---
Damn, I feel personally attacked right now
---
didnt see any of u little bears forming up a small fleet and eating anoms alive...the mass of eve players are dummie as fuck
---
60 second delay
---
What if Concord charged a monthly isk bill for standings?
---
most of the crybabies about black out need brain dude
---
It's worth discussing some of how Eve's PvE system contributes to the problem here. 
---
Eve ships are heavy specialized. A ratting or mining ship, almost by definition, cannot PvP very good. This means you have two tools to survive in a krab boat: don't get caught, or have backup. You are 100% reliant on not engaging any PvP ship in PvP. You want minimum content. 
---
Since most ships take a long time to make their value back, you're working on fairly thin margins if you ever die; ratters are taught that *any level of risk is unacceptable*, and this is usually correct, especially for bigger ships like supers and rorquals. 
---
**Suggestion: figure out a way to make money that isn't inherently anti-content.** How about a "thunderdome" abyssal site where 10 t1 cruisers can duke it out over 20 cans of loot? 2-3 "exit tickets" spawn in random cans and you have to loot one within 15 minutes to leave. They always drop from wrecks.
---
"setting eso green" is a term used to allow super carrier/carrier ratting/rorqual mining
---
eso = esoteria
---
green = ok to krab
---
red = not ok
---
I don’t care what you think, that was the intention of the fitting warnings
---

im not gona pay any money from now on for a farming game
---
Actually my idea is to make the FW ships much more desired.        
---
Why use drake if you can get navy drake, etc.
---
Overwhelming applause.
---
1-2 min is all it takes for us to be on top of something. I don’t need more than a minute if I’m in a Sabre. I need 2-3 min if I’m in a t3c going after the Ishtar in a belt. Getting on top of ishtars takes time because of the speed difference. A 1 min delayed local means I’m flying an Arazu or rapier for hunting.
---
The ones being hunted have a bunch of advantages to begin with like standing fleet etc.
---
Jesus Christ dude you killed him lol
---
My game? Haha, what does that even mean? My game is I’m trying to fool everyone on the sub !!
---
As I already said, I must have been mistaken when I thought the Ishtar was only 250k, alongside the distances given on the eve-uni website. Please accept my sincere apologies, mate ))
---
Ironically blackout made me resub, so they're loosing my sub putting back in lol. They can't win.
---
Its my birthday i get to call you names you go tell Mike to go to sleep
---
Might wanna post this response somewhere and get the brigade going cause it's outlook isn't good.
---
Eve was recovering from a bad case of crabs. Instead of staying clean and getting better. It decided crabs was its life. 
---
#fairwellhealthyeve
---
They shouldn't. But they have for so long, it's simply unacceptable that things could actually *CHANGE* omg
---
I like the idea of a delayed local because of the potential for a ghost fleet that never shows up in null because it is never in a system long enough to appear. This helps make 3rd parties in fights happen more because they go unscouted. 
---
Ppl dock up when they see your fleet coming and they get scared. Being able to get around this problem and have the element of surprise without the use of a cyno should be something that is encouraged. You’d be using your minds to outsmart ppl.
---
Not a problem, just shit stiring😁
---
It's not polite to make fun of the handicapped
---
I'm guessing he realized it's not 2005 anymore and grids extends far beyond 1000km now.
---
Plenty of us here like you, it’s funny how they stopped playing yet their voices echoed for months for change. Too bad CCP has to bend a knee in such a short timeframe.
---
So just because you're going to lose more isk then you make, it makes you a bitch? You heard it here first folks, better keep losing isk so that you don't get shamed called by Grath. It's good that you have experience in many aspects of eve. I don't give a fuck about how many alts you have, no one really does. Kudos to you for trying to make eve a better place, but don't be surprised if your effort falls short because of CCP or because you can't come up with better words than "bitch" to counter back like a teenager.   
---
Now based on your wording, you're implying that just because you're against these changes, you've never done anything else in eve. I think you're all shit for trying make isk anywhere outside of the afk market but that's just my opinion and not realistic. Don't assume just because you have a plethora of experiences, doesn't mean someone else doesn't.
---
Yes, because its better to have no players than it is to have inflation.
---
&gt; Living in high-sec only is cancer
---
I think you ignored what I said.
---
great, that means you are now -1 scout  
---
next time the fleet jumps you will be promoted to -2 scout   
---
any fc worth their salt knows how indispensable the role of -44 scout is
---
I mean as a hunter I wouldn’t mind this. I pretty much alrdy know you’re in local and what you’re doing before I load local. For lan and in game map tell me this and then most systems have anoms clumped pretty close to the gate. I’m not opposed to this either.
---
Not many due to blackout.  Majority was bots.   
---
People left for Classic because its classic wow and not because of blackout.  Classic is now starting to level off in its popualtion and we should see a steady rise back on eve for those who were pulled away for the initial rush.
---
Story??
---
Oh that makes sense haha
---
All cloaks is ridiculous.
---
Are you the guy that deleted his post?
---
i think you can use plex but need to file a ticket for it
---
&gt;  So, no, blackout was bad as it made people less inclined to play.
---
I keep hearing this but I haven't seen any evidence of it...
---
Yea that sounds fucking awesome.
---
Even if it was 100km would it be a problem? Not as safe as running them in highsec. Rewards are the same. Everyone has access to them.
---
I already have dave.
---
The point is you refusing to provide sufficient evidence to substantiate your claims
---
"Lol go look it up" isnt a way to credit your source in an argument
---
bad bot
---
Well if it was sitting 100k off a keepstar, I probably wouldn’t engage it when the target pops out.
---
Titans for me, but not for thee.
---
I really am going to miss the sense of community and just getting to know so many folks that I previously didn’t know.  The communication between the active folks was honestly amazing.  
---
I’m going to be sad that I won’t be able to put a Loki gang and a cloaked HIC inside of a 10/10 with a bait rattlesnake being the only thing on D-Scan.  
---
Yeah some
---
Friends will return, but I’m somewhat disappointed that they didn’t let themselves go there in the first place.  I feel closer to the folks who stuck around.  
---
Happy/sad if that makes any sense.
---
He probably drinks dew and wears a beanie as well.
---
I here trying to figure out why they are giving back high rewards with low risk. Removing local was the best decision and the economy was finally moving towards a healthier direction. Well, guess this us what happens when you switch your player base to a carebear playstyle trying to mimic a game that you’re not. rest in piece eve.
---
Age of balance.
---
...6/9, that’s probably going to be an inside joke with me as the punchline. Eh, it’s cool.
---
Yes, 60 seconds delay on jump in.
---
Now we're talking :)
---
I spent years building towards the meta that CCP themselves created. Three subs. A super pilot, A general purpose fleet guy, and a Rorqual driver. Listening to Hilmar on TIS along with his obsequious sidekick convinced me that my huge investment in the game, in both time and hard earned cash was being tossed in the gutter because of some book he had read. My role outside of fleet ops, is to be prey. The blackout killed my gameplay stone dead. I have played since 2005. I have ticked every PvP box I ever want to. I play the game to enjoy it, if it is no longer fun, it is time to move on. Risk reward balance was stupidly against me. Outside of a fleet I have no reason to log in. So, I went to vanilla WoW. Packed my bags, and have exited the building, and having a shed loads fun with old friends. I have no trust left in CCP. Hilmar can keep his half baked poorly thought out, on a whim changes that destroy trust and destroy gameplay. Somehow somewhere CCP has forgotten we have a choice. Forgotten we are customers, and forgotten that we pay their wages. The blackout is going. Too late. I have already gone.
---
Cynojammer btw
---
I know, and I can’t get enough of it!
---
I really hope in the future they delay local. I wanted it delayed prior to blackout. Totally was happy with the blackout. Targets did decrease with the blackout. Less targets didn’t really matter though because I could still always find these targets. Bring back local really hurts the pvp game because that perfect intel is really hard to beat. A ratter or a miner has to be very dumb and literally not paying attention and his near2 has to be malfunctioning in order for us to kill it.
---
Imagine resubbing because a chat channel was removed, how fucking asocial are you?
---
Hey look it sounds stupid this way also.
---
:crab: :crab: :crab: :crab: :crab:
---
It will be. Make a folder, toss it in there and share it. No more contracts or nothing
---
yep I have the same problem it’s because of the 64 bits client with the 32 bits you dont have this problem
---
Then the bombers come back, and we go in a circle.
---
rip me
---
I guess im the weird one? I used near2 for a few months but then just resorted to just using alts on gates hearing gate flash. Near2 is annoying and being pinged for something 5 jumps is gay. I've lived in drone lands for well over two years. Not everyone uses it, I know I certainly don't, please don't assume everyone uses it.
---
As cool as they look but fancy new caps are about the last thing the game needs atm
---
Step 1: Burn a 2x4 and hit it repeatedly with something until it resembles a Leviathan.
---
Step 2: ?
---
Step 3: Profit
---
remember if your mad about blackout ending just remember what you all been saying last months...
---
**adapt or die**!!!!
---
for those will be ar-15?
---
What if was a nutral 100k off jita undock? 
---
I think the point of abyssals and the reason why they removed the criminal flag is that the risks are in the site itself.
---
No, the point a customer is being negative is the point you failed to communicate policy. People on the whole are capable of understanding even negative policies when they are explained and practical reasons given. I which case a negative customer becomes at worst a disappointed customer. I'll feelings can be resolved.
---
"I have played since 2005"
---
"the meta that CCP themselves created... a Rorqual driver"
---
If you're really from 2005, you spent 80%+ of your Eve career without Rorq Excavator mining, so...
---
Right here folks is why the MMO genre is dying.
---
Or just set it public, as people can't get to it without a link
---
&gt;\*local chat is simply easy intel, During blackout you could sit in staging systems and pick off ratting subcaps in cloaky because they weren't communicating and warning each other about neutral in system
---
i could go from killing 1 guy in system to just warping to the next guy still doing his site
---
A lot were bots.
---
And with purples it can vary, lmao
---
I know its the internet but no meme tappitss actually has a mental issue :(
---
if you think its remotely difficult to figure out important identifiers in an MMO, you must have really struggled with this game.
---
distance/velocity
---
I think the reeee'd so hard they lost the ability to think.
---
Let the bots come back to null is different to customers being pissed off.   
---
The amount of bots they claimed to have banned was only marginally lower then the amount of people who appear to have left looking at the play count.   
---
Many of those who left will have done for Classic and thats starting to level out and return out of the "hype" period
---
I actually read exactly what you said but you didn't read what i said. You never mentioned null or wh after me suggesting them. Ergo, you're choosing to ignore them in favour of bashing both high and null as if they're all there is.
---
I didn't tell you to look it up. I told you the source, several times, that you have already seen.
---
So, you're just fucking retarded.
---
Yeah in theory but what I saw was 3/4ths my corps stop logging in, and prime time member count of my allianc dropped from having 200 people on down to 30-50 people on. For me personally I couldn't justify buying more Omega time due to the lack of time irl along with blackout killing the activiness of my alliance.
---
The PvE-ers determine the risk level, though. Hunters have no clue whether there is a fleet on the other end of a cyno, or cloaked, or camping a gate 2 jumps out and on comms. Your assumption that it's gonna be low-risk for hunters just shows that you're not interested in creating the risk; you just want PvE without being hunted.
---
Cool! You'll have inflation *and* no players soon.
---
who cares? legacy is a big boi and can handle WC, thats what tapi dinos have been saying.
---
Or the opposite. Highly tatted systems get a special visit from papa Sansha. Incursion.
---
I'm being serious about CCP devs being lost, to be honest. They firt broke null with structure spam and rorq imbalance, and then decided to whack away at the symptoms instead of what broke things in the first place. And as often happens, that is leading to the patient dying rather than reviving.
---
Except it didnt because you could still Dscan if you were legetimately ratting.  Only a handful of ships could sneak up on you and even then most of them have a lock delay and lock time before they can hold you in place.
---
"dedicated to bringing pain" Overweight Boomer confirmed.
---
I don't think you get Eve.
---
That’s a completely different scenario - someone running them in safe space. My post is about those running them in nullsec, where risk is meant to be higher than HS.
---
At least there will be more players for longer ;)
---
Sad but its not like its a ship i could actually obtain. Id prefer new angel subcaps, i can actually afford them. You know you want an angel bc more than an angel dread.
---
Don't assume things then, I purposely said "Living in high-sec only is cancer." for a reason. This implies that ANYWHERE else is better than high-sec.
---
It’s funny because it’s true (
---
AND THE CROWD WENT MILD
---
by healthy you mean with a constantly dwindling playerbase?
---
Hi as someone who runs test it, test does not use, support or encourage using near2. So get your facts straight.
---
Yeah i agree, the space in null where I was went from good groups and good chat to dead maps and dead chats, it makes you not enjoy the game as much if you don't have friends to play with.
---
naw man, the neckbeard weeb scene is Elite: Dangerous.  
---
Null is solidly Boomer MAGA bros and "Ben Shapiro is my favorite (Star Wars) commentator" guys.
---
I've heard of people getting faction spawns in certain missions,  the probability of this happening anywhere near reliably is crap though.
---
The problem is that requires dev time.
---
:cavethonk:
---
Which is to say, we enjoy the great benefits of a *pure*, *healthy*, and *challenging* Eve lifestyle. :)
---
I wanted to hate your comment for defending zero isk, but you are right. It is reflected in the price. You buy the escalation for the minimum it could make. If the minimum drops,(rare) you lost money in ammo alone.
---
&gt; I want to be customer, not product.
---

You should give C3s a second static so they don’t dead-end chains so often :/

---
I'm confident blackout did not affect botting in any way shape or form other than the bots using ingame logging feature to track literally any movement including cloaked ships...
---
It's funny to think some nerds pack up and leave because of some changes to a game they've played for years. It's the equivalent of adult fit-throwing. I played before blackout, I'll play after blackout and I don't have to piss and moan anytime a change comes down the pipeline that I don't agree with. I'll also stand by the notion that every game play style should have a place in EVE.
---
Will the limit be increased? I need more!
---
Its like talking to a puddle of urine
---
I'd like all pirate factions to have Dessies and BCs tbh.
---
Eve's PvE system has always been trash (super boring, super bottable, inherently anti-content because PvE ships can't fight). The real change CCP should implement is a total overhaul of the PvE system.
---
Idk, the blackout made me realise that there are better games out there.
---
what
---
I'd rather see CCP have another go at creating ChAoS by removing standings altogether.
---
As someone who has disagreed with you on almost everything, please god yes do something with these.
---
Local and cyno changes were addressing the symptoms, injectors, citadels, excavators, and fozzie sov are my list of actual problems and those top two are the biggest.
---
#Stop nerfing things into the ground, and breaking entire playstyles in a single patch.
---
​fixed for visibility
---
Yep, talking to puddles is something a retard would do I guess.
---
Local never disappeared, just its use as an intel tool.
---
Odd mashup
---
I have around 30k right now. When someone pisses me off, I go around and deliever it to them, one at every structure. It is a great tool.
---
it’s not a thing in other mmos lmfao. maybe osrs if you’re doing something in wildy, but not really
---
Have you considered playing in Wormholes... they don't have local chat... you could go there...
---
We're still investigating the performance impacts of the new system so no guarantees at this time, but for now the plan is to increase the limit for personal and shared bookmarks pretty significantly.
---
How will you get them to the site?
---
Nah mate. People just want something fair. Not 90/10 or 10/90 in either direction. Finding that compromise and then doing so in a manner people agree with is the hard part.
---
That no longer works, tested it after the CSM summit. Its a bit late but it is fixed
---
\&gt;  Stop nerfing things into the ground, and breaking entire playstyles in a single patch. 
---
Thank you, this cannot be said enough number of times. Idiotic "features" like citadel spam and ridiculously overpowered rorqs (till recently) worsened the massive power dynamics in the game. And what does CCP do? Kick over all the sandcastles with a hammer because thinking through things was too hard.
---
I'm glad someone high enough in CCP looked at the numbers, and came to their senses.
---
LPT: if you want to kill Goon Rorqs without risk, do it directly in 1DQ. [they won't safe them](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78924339/)
---
Indeed. Instead of iterating, they decided to play whack-a-mole. I hope they will be more introspective now.
---
Fantastic.
---
Those were example numbers. I'm not picking what the number should be at, just that there needs to be a rough number to work with when designing a system. Personally, I think that a system should be able to support 10-15 people per time zone. This would let smaller to medium size corporations be able to stay local without spread; but bigger groups would need to spread out.
---
Good one Dave!
---
Citadel jacked NPC rates on trades to 'encourage' pub citadel markets.
---
It feels good when things mostly go right.
---
Short AAR: https://zkillboard.com/kill/78915494/
---
It turned into mostly a gank, but the success was solely due to the anchoring of a cyno inhib early on. This created the opportunity for the cyno pilot to make the mistake of warping in at 20 km instead of 100km.  
---
The most recent cyno changes make cyno inhibs actually useful while also establishing the need for cyno pilots to have a minimum amount of forethought to press the rescue button. This video showcases how good preparation can create situations that allow you to capitalize on your opponents mistakes.
---
20 km is 12.43 miles
---
CCP has no spine
---
dead game = good game = WH logic
---
Then your first post doesn't make any sense either, and your being disingenuous.
---
At least be accurate if you want to try calling people out.
---
You sir are a pussy if you need local. That is all.
---
Sure, that is one version of content, and legitimately so. 
---
Imagine all the other ships passing in the night though (literally) cause .. Marco... !
---
It's going to change the Search and Rescue program completely.
---
Is it safe to resub. This dude probably pees sitting down
---
Was fun. I am suprised they kept it so long. Looking forward for the next black out.
---
Oh no, players that are in ratting ships that know they are not designed for a pvp fight are warping off. How dare they.
---
I’m going to miss having my alt contract bookmarks to me at the station... (sarcasm)
---
No pretty sure CCP is allowing it by catering to the giant blobs
---
mom?
---
At least try to put some effort into creating discussion
---
https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/07/ccp-blackout-interview/ This one that I just found with a Google search, right?
---
The risk for abyssals is meant to be the abyssal itself. The pvp aspect is also inside the sites with those fancy arena rooms. If its in null wormholes or hs rookie system doesnt matter.
---
I wonder if the strategy was to do the blackout, ban a massive wave of bots, and see if post-blackout had any effect on bots returning. I'm assuming bots will return, but I also wonder if they were able to garner any information on bot activity during blackout. Whatever the case, I just hope they've developed some strategies to hurt botting as a result of what they've learned during blackout. (If they've learned anything from blackout)
---
I'd put npe rework above cyno changes but everything else is spot on.
---
Playbase that was catered to since 2014 which majority of the player base didn’t want around. Now that good player base is replaced with the cancer we have today. As the cancer dies off, new and wanted cells are slowly but surely filling in. Monday everything good for the game will be removed and the cancer will return while the numbers will dwindle harder than ever before.
---
It would be awesome to have new pirate subcaps, a mordus legion jackdaw does sound pretty cancerous though
---
Oh ok, sorry I wasn’t aware of that, do you have a source? 
---
It’s interesting because there’s a lot of risk in highsec as well - 3 t1 tornados should do the trick.
---
comment of my heart. CCPLZ
---
another way it could be done is.  nerf them to shit stats wise so most of them die. followed by either buffing them and drastically increasing the build costs or keeping them nerfed
---
just create a inty who dosn't appear on local/dscan can fit a cover (covops bridge) no cyno BUT no interdiction nuli   
---
maybe...combat ceptor ? they are useless anyway make them usefull CCP
---
btw. how is the income from domi/myrm compared to old VNI?
---
your name reminds me of a video I made: (RadioactEVE)[https://youtu.be/dK1XUikmg5U]

dam, only 27. no wonder so many people are bitter here. Go buy the new corvette.

It all ends on Monday, OP local intel will be back.
---
I helped warr akini pioneer freighter ganking, so yeah, it was painful.

if the predator has no posible way to control the prey population we get shit like worthless isk

All those independent free thinkers of goonswarm federation all miraculously arriving at the same exact idea.

Fucked if I know, I'm not wasting mobile data to check. Have a listen and find out, I guess.
---
Scout running OBS to get the exact unanchor time, seed bombers, log in 10-15 mins before unanchor and get bombers into position, as soon as Fort is picked up nuke the freighter.
---
tons of people were skeptical of this but no one wanted to say they confirmed it because we all each have such small sample sizes... and everything anecdotal  with out knowing the real values..
---
Yeah, it was quoted in PC gamer, too. Not hard to find. Hope you're well, Dave.
---
Game was dead with the stagnation, carebearing, risk adverse gameplay. Game became alive again with blackout. Now, back to square 1 on Monday with the same shit that was killing the game in the first place.
---
#Nulllogic
---
please finish tiercide god damn it
---
"I was only pretending to be retarded."
---
Completely reasonable conclusion. I'm glad they're churning the waters a little. I'm glad they're pissing a few people off other than *just* the PvP crowd. I also totally agree with you that rolling blackout back completely just shows their inability to iterate meaningfully once again.  
---
The big thing we can take away is that there isn't a magic button CCP is going to be able to push and bring back the 10,000+ people that have left the game over the past four years. In many ways I think that's sort of what they were halfheartedly expecting. There are so many contributing factors to stagnation, and lack of conflict, that need addressing before the game even begins to have a positive upturn in returning faces. Some people *did* come back for blackout, but it wasn't like entire dead alliances returned to their former glory.
---
what if the most farmed systems get blackout
---
They fucking move somewhere else, bots never left this game. They lost players and their alts
---
Why would they do this when there's already an absurd surplus of minerals flooding basically every single market in the game?
---
That's my boy. Ding ding ding ding
---
I printed a Vedmak, and I found that it's hard to do well. The 3 thin antennas near the middle as well as the thin connection to the 2 "arms" make it a difficult print without alterations. Here's what I got: https://i.imgur.com/FmdlML5.jpg
---
I'm telling you all this so you know that there's a trick to printing them. I don't plan on printing anything for you, for EULA reasons. If you want me to help you print one for yourself however, let me know.
---
There should be more sov holding entities holding more compact sov footprints. The proposed changes do the opposite.  A 100man corp should really only need 1-2systems, not a whole constellation. Alliances should need constellations, not 5 regions.
---
No they just need to buff dreads and give a reason to risk supers.
---
I'd be okay with cloak hiding you from local if:
---
1) dscan capabilities on a cloaked ship are limited to like 1AU or something... blame it on the cloak fucking up all but passive sensors or something. Means that campers will need to warp around a lot if they want to find potential targets, which brings us to
---
2) it costs heavy water or topes or something to warp while cloaked or during cloak recalibration, meaning a camper's ability to harass a system without resupplying or being caught are limited, but still there.
---
While they didn't immediately reveal their intentions, I was under the impression from the beginning that there was a possibility this would be a temporary measure, as they did not clearly announce the full scope of blackout when it was released.
---
If you're not in local while cloaked, what on earth is the point of afk cloaky camping?  You're not scaring anyone, because no one knows you're there at all.
---
Source is reality of the situation. Hs gankers get more consistant isk going for haulers. If you do want to kill abyss runners, run the abyss yourself and fight in the pvp room like bob intended.
---
Do you understand how stupid of a comment you just wrote is?
---
The blackout was initiated because nullsec crabs had instant access to intel via NEAR2 AND this allowed for absurd ratting isk faucets.
---
People rejoined because finally a player could roam through nullsec and be able to not be constantly tracked by 3rd party programs.
---
the final blow to the few dedicated bookmark sellers left in eve
---
I'm good, went with my friend to pick up her new chickens earlier, that was pretty cool.
---
Hope you're well, too.
---
The area around you is full of people you're blue too
---
A more lit pirate destroyer like a bigger garmur would be cool.
---
Blackout was completely pointless. CCP simply rolled back to where we were right before blackout but now with cyno restrictions. Why couldn't they take this opportunity to deploy a small iteration and add slightly delayed local (30seconds, 60 seconds, tied to gate cloak etc) instead of simply rolling it back?
---
It just seems entirely pointless when they could of just tweaked timer lengths and adjusted ship stats to mix up the game instead. I'm just speechless about all this tbh.
---
I hoped the blackout would "end" with the introduction of Upwell Observatories... If we can't have those then a delay would be good. Honestly, both at the same time is probably the best option.
---
Who would have thought that players need to defend their PVE assets if they want to PVE in space.
---
I cannot think of a way to rationalize that. I believe that game mechanics should be supported with lore at where possible.
---
waiting for armor tengu
---
Well then get off of the forum take said system or two from the salty miners from any given null donut system they had and let's see how long you hold on to it. Being that these systems are within their umbrella range. Let's see how this small alliance fairs when any large null  alliance wont allow this.
---
They will either
---
1. Take back the "system or two".
---
2. Highly suggest you join alliance or form coalition.
---
3. Force you to pay rent.
---
Its simple null sec politics.... Please let me know of your ig name and small alliance so I can watch how you fair.
---
EVE Online can be brought back. It just needs some serious dev time and reasons to play the game. not just in null, in all areas of space. My hope is the PA is able to provide that. I currently do not trust the team at CCP to successfully recover EVE.
---
I disagree.
---
A customer will (possibly) be negative even if you follow all "golden rules" and do everything correctly. I deal with hundreds of customers a week that have ranging issues from a billing problem to network issues that need resolving.
---
Even when we do everything right, there are still people that are not capable or willing of understanding. On a daily basis I speak to dozens of customers who refuse to read the contracts they sign and then get surprised that our contracts include a clause that tells you that you're responsible to take care of your payments by yourself if our automated systems fail.
---
People choose not to listen very often and in those cases it really is the question: How much do these people benefit us being a customer. Yes, they pay money but how much money do these types of people chase away from the game by their mass hysteria, their negativity and their constant vitriol. It may just be a lot healthier to cut these people out.
---
I don't disagree. It's a numbers game and finding out where the balance is. Right now, a group like INIT can live in two constellations. With the number of players in each time zone, perhaps it would be better to need 3 or 4. But that's not for me to decide, just the general direction when pointing to a scarcity idea.
---
I liked the "help me" implied in it.  Mention of system + mention of a reason for them to still be at it later instead of just posting / laughing about it.  Looks overly calculated.
---
It looks like a burned stick...
---
Heresy befitting a c4 wr corp, not a true wher
---
The reality of the situation is I can and do kill the runners, through highsec ganks or in low/null, so I’m sorry but that “source” is bullshit. I’ve killed them, and will continue to do so by camping traces. Just because there is an “intended” way of doing it, doesn’t mean it’s the only way. This is eve after all, eh?
---
I'm saying he is stupid for trying to say it was just as chat channel.
---
If he wants to say that then the reverse is also true.
---
Either some people quit and some rejoined because a chat channel was removed or some people quit and some peopled resubbed because an Intel tool was removed.
---
Saying some people quit because a chat channel was removed and people rejoined because an Intel tool was removed pushes bias onto the sentence.
---
&gt; goons have been loving the black out!
---
That's why you have 10 propaganda posts a day bitching about it?
---
You could learn the game and most importantly learn to pvp before trying to live in what’s suppose to be the riskiest and rewarding part of the hardest MMO ever. Just saying 
---
#Logic
---
Right I forgot losing players enmasse is making the game alive again. 
---
Oh and having supers and titans docked up instead of being potential kill mails is just fine and dandy, your logic knows no bounds. If you think that ratting is the issue with the game and not the shit tier sov mechanics that would keep those ratters out fighting then you're truly lost
---
For sure.
---
But there needs to be a better balance. Personally I would love to see two things to be considered:
---
1. You do not show up in local as long as you have gate-cloak. This does two things. It slows down intel gathering by not immediately knowing where someone shows up, keeping some of the panic and fear. It also enables players to load grid before they show in local, which keeps hunting somewhat aggressive.
---
2. A structure that can be deployed in a system to jam out local in an entire constellation. The structure should be relatively easy to kill, but it should be somewhat challenging to scan down (think Ghost Sites) with combat probes.
---
I am curious what you think.
---
sla might do the trick
---
Imagine wanting to stop a fleet from attacking you but they just run away. Pvpers cry and run when someone comes to kill the but celebrate ganking ships that don't fight back.
---
Citadel spam fix is easy, and many of us have said it here. Low-power citadels  (no fuel/active module for xxx days) should = killable on first RF and not offer tether, not be timezone tanked for a final timer.
---
Didn't they literally say a few weeks ago the wormhole spawns were being increased? Am I hallucinating?
---
well, the chat channel as an intel channel got removed, so im half right
---
The cyno changes are not good because they are simply an inconvenience measure which hurts smaller groups much more than the larger ones. I am hoping to see a more detailed cyno module update.
---
But, I am more hoping they remember Faction Warfare exists lmao
---
Losing bad player who want the best rewards with zero risk in a game that only survived due to its hardcore playstyle. Yes, you all leaving = no value loss as this was never your game to begin with.
---
How ironic is WC calling out mangos bots when they in proportion have way more, as anybody seen cache? The locals there speak binary instead of chineese
---
Based and redpilled.
---
In the words of the Arnoce, Based and Redpilled. Have an upvote.
---
lol what?
---
Yikes, didn't even kill a super or titan....
---
So back to free negligible-risk ratting and mining for the nullblobs. So much for an interesting shake-up.
---
added clarity - Short term profits.
---
*Baaaby shark doo doo do do do do*
---
We getting downvoted lol
---
They should bind it to the active defense multiplyer if it's high you get shown after 15 seconds, if it's low you get a full minute until you show up. NPC null gets a 30 second delay. Breaking gate cloak will show you no matter how much time has passed.
---
Not playing a game because it doesn't feel fun for whatever reason is hardly "meta gaming".
---
Constellation and regional chat would definitely solve the psychological perception of emptiness.
---
I seem to remember this already being suggested in some past reddit posts as well.
---
You’re telling me in no other MMO is THE NAME AND LOOK OF YOUR CHARACTER critical in identifying you?  Jesus christ
---
Cancelling all subscriptions on account of CCP revoking the only good change in years.
---
Okay, the logic of "hardcore only" doesn't work in today's world it might have 10 years ago but not now and your biggest wallet warriors leaving the game isn't that good for the longevity of the game..
---
&gt; We're getting
---
nonono, we're promised shared bookmarks(second time)
---
They sold models on the eve store shortly after release in 2003 if my memory serves.
---
Worst, otherwise those would have been used more before the blackout; Gilas and Ishtars are slightly better, as usual.
---
The domi kicks butt and beats the old vni in completion times. You can also warp to zero and face tank the rats. It just warps slower.
---
Then I am also half right and it sounds stupid when it's put that way doesn't it?
---
Please point to what part of AFK farming with rorquals or doneboats is fun
---
Eh, I'd rather see an ISK bill for access rights to citadels. A bill for standings is just a massive low-key nerf to NRDS and KOS-list based gameplay.
---
Upvoting a Seraph post, truly the end is near.
---
Ermagerdh!!!! Im excited
---
All focus is on the Trig line atm i bet.
---
I love this idea
---
Delay local so that you don’t load local until you decloak from gate jump. Gives hunters time to d scan and prevents people from autowarping when local changes.
---
No, cloaking is already way too good in this game.
---
Yea man, this guy doesn't know anything. How could he have any say on this. It's not like he has alts that he uses because then he could be getting kills daily, and we would never know about.
---
This would be interesting, or just an ongoing cost in heavy water to stay cloaked.
---
You will probably have to. It is going to be worth a lot.
---
Cute endless weeks of "Bring blackout back" posting. 
---
Just adapt already.
---
Republic fleet thrasher.
---
You’ve got one more days,  to pull off the bait rattle, that’s enough
---
Thats exactly what the problem is, the fact you think this game needs you when in reality it doesn’t and never did. The biggest mistake this game has ever made was accepting a playerbase full of you people for the pass 5 years. Its core players are gone, the same core that got the game to where it is today. CCP greed in trying to become WoW will be their ultimate downfall. Best thing for the game is to purge you people and get its core players back. It was heading in the right direction, too bad they bent a knee. If i was Hilmar, I would have waited the two years to recover from the 5 year fuckup. Yeah its going to hurt at first, it gets better with time and would have made CCP stronger.
---
Adapt or die begger.
---
Holy shit, that's the first update I'm actually excited for this year!
---
Human nature kills eve.
---
Funny, when you guys were told to adapt you kept screeching and in the end you got what you wanted. Morale of the story: enough reeeeing will get you what you want, so why should people adapt instead of doing that?
---
If it helps you sleep at night
---
How much does it cost to print a ship that size?
---
How often are bookmarks really sold when both parties are not online? Is required both buyer and seller to be online for the sale of the folder really going to change the market that much?
---
Doubt.
---
I'm so terrified of something going wrong and thousands of personal bookmarks being lost. =(
---
Yea, killing that shit fit ratting domi was going to yield you so much isk.
---
This appears to be a silver lined sunshine, i demand clouds r/eve needs clouds to avoid player loss.
---
Because you won't give them access to the bookmark until they give you isk. When you receive the isk, you give them ACL to the bookmark that takes them to the site.
---
hm?
---
See, I am not fully in agreement and I'll be happy to explain to you why.
---
Before I state anything: As a former wormholer and now a null player, I do not find the comparison between wormholes and blackout-null to be fair. A lot of players do not realise the fundamental differences in the playstyle that don't carry over just because you lost local. I'll refuse to follow that comparison so if I ignore that, it's nothing against you :)
---
My problem with the post-blackout state of affairs is that it fosters an environment where risk aversity and botting will be encouraged. It reduces the individual skill required by pilots in space that is supposed to be incredibly risky but unimaginably rewarding. I strongly believe that the risk should increase exponentially when you're deeper into unsafe space. Of course, the income should reflect that which is why people like wormholers are so rabid about keeping their systems the way they are. They are super risky, but super rewarding for those who are bold enough to go for it.
---
And that boldness needs to come back. A player that wants perfect intel should be primarily focused around HS/LS. But a player who wants to get the sick rewards that come with the risk, those should be in null. I believe that we need to reduce the amount of sites per system, raise the reward (and challenge) per site and then delay the appearance of new people in local up until their gate-cloak breaks. That introduces risk, reduces the effectiveness of remotely gathering intel based on local and gives hostiles a mechanism to confuse defenders.
---
Not even Satan would stoop that low dude.
---
It has been a long time coming.
---
Ok you want to know what is causing this? Sure. I have to spell everything out for you because you have no critical thinking skills.
---
Say your an average 0.0 line member
---
You know that atleast once a year your mains are going to be deployed to the other side of the galaxy in a war for atleast 3-6 months where the likelihood of making isk in that time span is drastically reduced.
---
 So you krab the remainder of the year for as much isk as possible so you can have fun and not just fly fucking tackle ships in every fleet, but stuff like faction battleships, hacks, caps and super caps. Because being in a massive 5k person fight sucks when your doing it but is awesome to look back on. You have to deal with some 300 man bomber fleets that can melt you in 4-5 minutes but its its normally fine due to your defense fleet being there and having your back.
---
Now crying hunters are mad that their completely risk adverse bomber fleets can kill people in ABSOLUTE  safty and win every fight so they bitch to ccp to make the game easy for them. Ccp acquiesced to that vocal minority and implemented blackout to make cloaky shitbags happy. 
---
Whatever it's more risky now and talking in local with your friends is a fucking security threat in a mmo, but you adapt.
---
Now the risk adverse bombers are still not happy because some of their targets are getting away and start bitching that caps are "op" not taking into account that forming a subcap fleet to fight them on their terms (spoiler they always run away) takes 5-9 minutes on average. The 300 bombers have already burned through the supercaps tank at that point and disappeared so why would anyone ever not drop caps? People dont krab if they know they are going to lose 30-80bill if they undock. 
---
But ccp once agian listens to the retarded hunters and takes the ability to light cynosure away and call for backup. Now you can tell when someone is in the system, you cant use directional scanners, you cant even call for help when you get droped. Why play the game? Why nerf an activity that is by no means afk, super ratting is damn near starcraft levels of apm. 
---
So now they have made null sec significantly less safe and not increased the reward. However wormhole ratters can control their own stargate and make 1bill a hour running sleeper sights in a haw dread in complete safty.
---
Why would anyone keep playing under circumstances like that?
---
Yes
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
I kinda like blackout.
---
BUT...I have a supercarrier and a rorq and am in a megacoalition with an umbrella.
---
Blackout was terrible for any organisation smaller than a mega-coalition that wanted to actually make decent money in null.
---
Hopefully the cyno changes won't completely kill caps but will limit them enough that smaller groups can actually take space in null again, and with local working can make use of it.
---
and in a rare show of good faith, CCP actually changes something people have been begging to be changed for nearly a decade. will this trend continue?  probably not... but you know we'll all stay tuned anyway!
---
? I am talking about the shit ton of isk influx ratting generates daily from nothing leading to the devaluation of isk.
---
If there is nothing reducing the amount of crabbers the isk in everyone's wallet is worth less and less
---
i think instead of a black out CCP should have done a sort of Rolling Brownout, where like incursions there would be a constellation or even region where local doesn't work. Then after 24-48 hours it rolls to a different part of space. Scope could even do a story about how Drifters or unknown pirates are attempting to hack Concord's network and its causing issues or some jazz like that.

Yeah the problem is the inordinate amount of extra work that can become adding people to the ACL of bookmark folders individually and then checking back to see if they used it and then removing them.

---
Nice one, thanks for doing these
---
I'd say make it a paired deployable structure that operates around both sides of a wormhole. If the wormhole is rolled or despawned naturally then the link is severed and instant local returns.
---
Yay, no more corp bookmark bullshit. Corp bookmarks can now be in an ACL that is only open to that corp.
---
Sure, this could encourage krabbers to spread out as well to keep ADMs high and the provided intel of local.
---
in my opinion low-class wormholes should  have more love,especially dual statics,longer lifetime,bigger mass
---
Just because something doesn't affect you directly doesn't mean you have to not care. Being able to sympathise with the impact it has on others is called empathy.
---
Back to the 'dead as fuck' version of EvE so that Mittani and Hilmar can make more $$.
---
So sad.. EVE was supposed to be *different* :(
---
limiting copy paste makes no sense since you can just you know waro there and make another bm
---
CCP didn't want to do this sure, but there is no sense being stubborn and killing the game. People just move to 'better', less niche games. Blackout had a lot of interesting effects but so much of this game relies on the garbage pve experience unfortunately (including killmails). Too hard and too fast. This economy, game needs a gradual fixes sometimes - slowly moving towards chaos instead of abrupt freefalls. 
---
Moving forward CCP should still test chaos esque and oriented features and slowly transition towards their goals instead of turning off half of the economy in just a short period of massive nerfs coupled with local.
---
People want risk,reward, difficulty the works - but well thought out changes. It was great to unlock that door and see the game in blackout - no gaming company compares with that boldness. Would have been great to have a snapshot of how it looks 3 months from now - but not of the risk of killing the golden goose.
---
Moving forward, gradual changes, gradual removal and implementation of things that effect the two most overpowered aspects of eve, the cyno and the local chat - would be most ideal. I'm glad cynos were addressed, I don't know if the current implementation is the best. Really like restrictions, really hate the fact that content creators or special snowflakes, those of us who FC have a  much tougher time organizing content because the extra pieces/fleet makeup are needed.
---
This just in: A new Jita scam said to be in development. “Bookmark fire sale.”
---
Other news at 9.
---
The cyno changes are more likely to fix nullsec than blackout.
---
Blackout makes it very difficult to make ISK in null unless you fly a super or rorq in a mega-coalition. This was actually a really BAD change for Null. At least the cyno change might make it easier for smaller groups to exist independent of mega-coalitions.
---
3.50
---
he plays on alts you retard
---
I am playing eve for like a week or maybe 10 days... What exactly is meant with blackout or what the hell is happening
---
Well, we did both. You can, too.
---
shut the fuck up powers
---
A bucket of iron bolts and a bucket of water and you have a minmatar shipyard
---
Don't know about you but I want to see this game flourish not die and have the Korean overlords strip the game apart for what is useful within 6 months because that's how these work.
---
Your mentality towards the playerbase is straight toxic, and you make wild assumptions about players and how I'm some filthy casual just based on a reddit tag.
---
Games don't bounce back once they lose critical mass in all time zones which is what we're getting dangerously close to. This mythical world where everything will eventually get better once everything focuses about your play style just doesn't work in a sand box, I'm sorry to tell you the news.
---
Do supers need tank nerfed? -yes
---
Was instant cynos on everything OP? -yes, but the "fix" was way to drastic
---
Was local OP? -sure in a sense, I've actually quite enjoyed the blackout but it also made sub cap rating pointless
---
I know you hate casual players but if we don't tend to them you lose a massive amount of playerbase.
---
but then again, if something doesnt effect me, it could also mean there's also a good chance it doesnt effect that many others... and empathy doesnt need to extend to codify every fringe element of a system that people are supposedly well versed in adaptation within
---
In my opinion, blackout was ok. But restricting cynos to just 4 ships in the game was shit. That’s just my opinion.
---
\*tries to avoid saying yeah and these mechanics are still garbage\* These mechanics are still garbage. Damnit.
---
that would be interesting, could even make it so that if they are entosised then local goes back to blackout.
---
Or it's entirely possible to have a high risk area where there is a place for players of various SP levels - risk doesn't have to be (and shouldn't be imo) tied to SP requirements and smaller ships should have a role even in larger engagements.
---
Fit?
---
I don't think rolling RNG blackout/brownouts would go over well. Would likely see an uptick in posts that CCP is tinkering with random and playing favorites during the middle of wars for instance.
---
About 40k additional range and 1500 m/s
---
Anything is viable if you bring enough real ships along to support it.
---
Downvoted because you didn't cut comms.
---
All that cyno changes will mean is that it will be slightly more difficult to cyno fleets onto fast moving ships. Large fleets will be basically unaffected. Everyone krabbing with caps will just reach into their deep pockets and inject a recon alt to sit cloaked nearby. People lost their shit about the cyno changes but they really don't amount to much... at the end of the day, the problem—that you can jizz an entire coalition onto grid, instantly and wherever you want—is unresolved.
---
Please tell me this is real!!!

Are they really players if they’re just playing wallet simulator online

Good salt, much post.

I think the point being made is that only a moron would host an exit node in the first place. Once the morons are all gone, state agencies and other sinkholes are all that remain. In the entire world there are only ~800 exit nodes. Very easy to pin those down and muscle them. They are either in Western states with massive surveillance and  counterintelligence apparatus or rogue states that have a vested interest in suppressing the free flow of information and dissent. The result ends up being that they are all in the Free World and the data centers that host them are beholden to the law enforcement and military industrial complex of that nation.

Any competent FC at this point is running mid dessys of their own so they con reposition as well.  And you can mid away from their bombs. Check
---
Considering this is sub-reddit is under 200 people I doubt their influence would have much statistical value.
---
I think we both know that CCP doesn't really give a crap about people reeeeeing, specially those reeeing on Reddit. Their fairly general disregard for the CSM is also another example of his. On the other hand, numbers don't lie. Specially when they translate to cold hard cash. And you are no longer your own boss.
---
Thats not an excuse, its still very high. Dude, NS has been eating nerf after nerf. At some point you actually do need to nerf the WHs as well. I would much rather us paying the price of faucets and giving it to LS.
---
I don't get all this "Eve was like the old days" nonsense. I've played since the early days and we always had local and always used report incoming hostiles in alliance chat. The only thing that has changed is that capitals have become so worthless they are used to pve in and losing them is irrelevant. Local isn't this issue - the stupid amount of isk flowing into the system is.
---
Sorry, CCP is currently wasting money on failing to make an action shooter mmo. Your idea can be the next failed project after that.
---
I love you
---
Great job!
---
Hum, wrong.
---
Any smaller group KNOWS that even if the capital ships of any coalition may be less prone to move at each problem, they still exist, they are still there. If required, they will be deployed whatever the 300 M ISK minimum requirement. The only thing it does is to make capital usage a serious cost for... smaller groups.
---
But even if they can still move if needed by any coalitions, chances are that wars between coalitions may be affected. Maybe more subcaps, maybe even less wars because heh, there wasn't any motivation to do wars with this damned fozziesov who slow everything in the first place, so if capital ships are more penible to move, even the "fight for content" reason will go down.
---
The cynonerf only made Rorqual pilots life harder, but may contribute to an ever more stagnant political situation.
---
That's the Caldari aesthetic : P
---
We should do black out for as long as we've had local to balance it out then.
---
I used to have a citadel torp launcher abaddon before they changed how cap weapons were fitted
---
Yeah those both sound like a good idea that might work or at least balance out the disparity between the attacker and defenders access to Intel.
---
Petition ccp to replace any mining laser or drone/fighter sounds with 30 seconds of crab rave
---
How high are you when you make these replies. They are hilarious tho thank you
---
Gamers are older now. If you want them to buy your shit, it's not a good idea to make 'full time play' a requirement.. we don't all have a granny with a free basement.
---
This has been the norm since the first threadnaught. When you have enough reeeee you get your way. Thanks ccp
---
PVE droneland renter pleb here and I agree with this. Having just adapted to BO it feels anticlimatic just getting local back with no payoff.
---
This. It’s all about what kind of game you want. Blackout was super fun. Now it’s gonna return to the same old stagnant bullshit where you only fight over structure timers. Fuck that.
---
What’s a C4 and C2 for 200 dollars Alex
---
I mean, let's where the numbers go when a good chunk of the people that left don't come back and people that stayed because of the blackout aswell as ones that got lured back in leave too now.
---
Krabs don’t buy plex, so I don’t see how blackout was affecting their plex sales
---
If CCP was willing to do it for that long, they wouldn't have reneged on their decision to remove it in the first place.
---
I like the philosophy they're pushing with no local, but the change seems incredibly poorly implemented and thought through. Changes to local should have come with balances to cloaking, the obvious counterpoint to local. Bombers became way overpowered when you had 0 warning, which is honestly probably more of what pushed people out than no local at all.
---
EveCombatNews Editorial Board: We are all high as fuck.
---
You are missing the fact that there are 3 blocs of which 2 are in direct war and the third is thirdpartying. None of those things will matter cause there was an era when it wasnt like that and people just keep track of whos "blue". 
---
Oh and that little war people keep forgetting about is the second most expensive in Eve history so far. I dont really get what more you want us to do. Nobody is gonna exterminate the other because that would be short term thinking. If the other side dies all together then you have less content going forward.
---
They're not able to do it anymore for the reasons stated above. We've got too many krabs with too many accounts that they'll unsub. Only hope is that they'll make "constellation local" and iterate upon the issues outlined. 
---
Otherwise fuck it let's just make it so any pvp requires you to ask permission.
---
reuse dust  assets for  rts or turnbased  pvp/pve combat on planets would be  intresting  for real  (might even be used to add the orbital bombardment into the game.
---
Have you ever lived in a wormhole? They are not less risk than an  umbrella null sec ...
---
We can say that you are a serious case of ideological fanaticism.
---
No one want to play in a game where hunters has all the intel they want (map filters when used by someone with IQ permits to find preys, and sovereignty tab in the show info of any system), and the prey nothing more (map filters don't help for defense, only Local did).
---
If at least CCP nerfed all said intel at the same time, maybe people would stay.
---
And also if they didn't make wormholes more frequent stealthly.
---
4 ships?  I'm missing something here.
---
Were you even around when Aegis dropped?
---
"Fozzie" sov set the map on FIRE as the potential territorial footprint of mega-coalitions shrank much more then they anticipated. Lots of new and small groups came to nullsec and took sov.
---
Citadels brought back the n+1 requirement. If you want to blame anything for stagnation, blame them.
---
i think you can buy it for 200millions in wormhole sales channel,afaik shit holes  are cheap
---
yes
---
It starts with the old leaderships that dont log in. I miss the good old days when alliances came and went so did leaderships but at least fights happened.
---
also happy cake day
---
The kind of hopelessness needed to round the situation up to "let's require permission to PVP" must be *profound.*
---
That’s a fucking stupid idea, you want to remove rolling wormholes? Do you even live in WH space?
---
&gt; it could also mean there's also a good chance it doesnt effect that many others.
---
This os a complete non sequitur. They have absolutely no relation.
---
&gt;and empathy doesnt need to extend to codify every fringe element of a system that people are supposedly well versed in adaptation within
---
Your assumption that because you don't care that no one should care undermines the rest of your argument.
---
I think a delayed local would be enough to circumvent Near2. Perhaps a simple 5 minute delay.
---
How about: Cloaking removes you from local, but is only possible fora limited time (either requires fuel or module cycle with cooldown).
---
I'm fine with local coming back. Cyno changes are the thing that make small gang more viable than local.
---
My first Corp was "Gravis Corp." Joined in 2004. I lied. You think what you want.
---
It's a brave man that makes a post for the sole purpose to display his own salt levels.
---
Did you really need to have the flash on?
---
Exactly true. People are just fucking pussies.
---
Blackout gave smaller groups an edge when punching above their weight.   Hope you have a plan CCP.
---
Good thing I just bout 2000 Plex on the market yesterday.
---
omg, i'm so sorry you have to put in that effort to receiving free isk on top of the bounties you already get from your anoms.
---
[The cyno is now lit, ariatethys](https://i.imgur.com/yNn8plT.png).
---
I've suggested this in the past - I do have a concern however that with many krabbing constellations in many back-end pockets it would actually exacerbate the problem of docking up on red entering chat - simply because there are so many krabbing pockets with a maximum of 1-2 entrances, it's simplified advanced intel. 
---
However on the psychological side it would indeed make space seem more full.
---
wipe your screen off once and a while.
---
I guess? I just disagree that only a moron would host an exit node. Tor does serve a legitimate purpose to a lot of people, and in those Western states, it's not illegal for illegal data to pass through your network, since there really isn't anything you can do about it and you have no idea what it actually is.
---
How bad do you have to be at pvp to require the removal of local to get kills? 
---
Ships died all the time with local enabled. Adapt, you're doing it wrong. Removal of local just removed your targets. Please try again later.
---
Been there, done that. I like using my capital ships and not being required to scan my statics. NPC null is a great place to live and harass nearby sov. But when they see you in local and all dock up until you leave the game gets boring.
---
I am more talking about the things that Ive seen him write in multiple places and I have also discussed with him. But ideas will always converge.
---
I dont really agree that the stagnation was as bad as he and others are saying. Imo the economy needed and still needs tweaking, minerals especially. But otherwise we had a very stable basis to build upon. And I am saying we should have built instead of trying to burn the foundation. 
---
People think its a good idea to just scorch earth, its really not. Its a cool concept but its not a good tactic for a somewhat healthy game.
---
This statement would be true if this game would actually be a proper f2p game, which it is really not. Current alpha clone state is nothing more than just an a limited trial that doesn't expire. While plexing your account is for sure THE fastest way to get a burned out in this game.
---
In short: People that lack disposable income shouldn't play Eve. CCP simply doesn't want you and there are far better value-for-money options out there when it comes to gaming.
---
Wanna see the keyboard?
---
Be careful what you wish for

It would take 37.5 man hours to close a hole that took 900 jumps.

Mobile addon for eve is station and ground combat using materials made in eve proper, all simplified to allow for usage on mobile device. 
---
**Eve: Clone Soldier**
---
Cool, I periodically go through my mains bookmark and share them with my alt and vice versa. Sounds like this will eliminate that for me. Thank you for this QoL improvement. 
---
@CCP Lebowski: 
---
Any plans to do anything similar with fittings for ships?
---
 I’m always amazed I can only have 250 personal saved fits at any given time and I have to export them to Pyfa for long term storage and consolidation.
---
Holy shit hole rolling would look funny after this. Hundreds of PI alts just yoloing in and out :D
---
what do you mean? didnt those bots move to high-sec? Wow the narrative changes so fast.
---
Haha lol nice.
---
Is that a supernova going inside your room?
---
Well querns if you've been paying attention the game has gotten progressively krabified in the past 3 years and any attempt to bring it back in line to be more combat focused has been met with tsunami waves of tears from krabs.
---
Im impressed. Wont flame him on his next post.
---
Face it everyone.  EVE is not going anywhere.  I’m confident this game will outlive me.  Prove me wrong.
---
Way to go Novac you dirty blobbers. Where is your wormhole bushido?
---
Mick I demand you answer for these crimes
---
Only person assuming, is you. I never said everyone does.
---
So?
---
Besides, if tears drive game change, clearly your job is to cry *even harder.*
---
alright dude, go back and reread the comment chain. I have yet to mention bots, hell even the parent didnt mention bots. 
---
But i guess its easier to dissmiss what i am saying by just labeling me as the boy that cried bot.
---
I am not going to bother responding past this, otherwise i might get a stroke
---
&gt; Here's the bottom line. We've had about 3 years of continuous safety net features 
---
The last year was making carriers ratting unsafe and ratting garbage. Artificial wait times between spawns making the bad pve experience worse for people. Making ratting feel even shittier instead of lowering the damn bounties is some of the worst implementation.
---
Safety has been in the crosshairs for over a year and the game is trending towards unsafe.
---
&gt; The krabs might only unsub 7 of their 15 accounts but you'll keep the PvPer
---
The game was dying because 90% of PVPers krab/complete PVE content or utilize local.  
---
There is no middle ground, if you want to be pvp victim you can leave as many others have. The game is developed for the playerbase, not the minority special interest where 20 of them actually have a killboard and the others roleplay pvp pilots. IF pve prospects don't make people undock, eve dies and there is no prey.
---
In short, skip the dramatics, the whining, you'll get what they give you. There is no bargaining.
---
It was a bad idea to do it in a vacuum with no other changes to the risk / reward calculation players make when then undock.
---
I would be interested to hear that argument presented to a judge in any normal country. Eventually the host server will be “strongly encouraged” by officials (ie legally forced) to cease operations or turn on log forwarding to a government collection destination. 
---
Even with the most strict privacy law ever passed (see GDPR in the EU) “Member States can introduce some derogations, for example for the prevention and detection of crime or for national security.” That’s a huge category/exception.
---
So the game's becoming a farmsville pve garbage mmo instead of a combat focused fury road. I don't think actual reddit crying changes the game. I think unsubbing does. But again I just outlined above why that works for some groups and not for others.
---
Piss off asshole.
---
I really love your fit, Thank you for sharing it
---
I’ll agree that map shouldn’t provide intel. You have my vote in that aspect. WH should be stealthy and with all arsenal and wealth null has at its fingertips, i dont see why you though this was a good topic to being up? 
---
It’s not a ideology when that’s what forged the game to begin with. What you want to turn eve into is a ideology that’s supported by a player base which is unhealthy for a game that’s literally designed around pvp. Yet we find more and more way to stop the core mechanics of the game to allow a player base to exist that is against the core design itself. It’s literally like eve is matter and you’re antimatter. The core players are screaming not to mix the two as the only outcome is destruction. Yet, here we are.
---
You really cant do much against 500 subs either but I understand your point. Most of the game is still subcap tho. Like we seldom use big things even though we have more than enough of them. Its just not prudent to use big toys for everything, they are not good enough.
---
And they do need support in offensive drops. I have never seen a offensive capital drop without support. Especially not now cause honestly caps have become really bad. Like carriers which are subcap killers in theory can pretty much only kill regular bombers and thats if they dont warp off fast. 
---
Hey listen let me put it like this. You are perhaps correct, like none of us are omnipotent. Maybe the tiniest change creates a wave of changes we need. So Im good with change, but if it doesnt work I want it gone. CCP just doesnt have a good track record of actually iterating.
---
The last time I tried this, I sent all my friendship and it got stolen :(
---
I thought the same thing.
---
Hey Valk. This is Notatall. I agree totally.
---
Nah. That's just victim complex shit.
---
Bots don't pay subscriptions
---
"I can't rat a bunch so ratting is garbage now."  
---
Heaven forbid you have to risk your prized carrier backed by a supercap umbrella to make isk.  
---
"Game is trending towards unsafe."   
---
Right because citadels making every system safe, supercap and rorq proliferation, ansiblex gates, cyno jam modules, all that must be realllllly hard on your pve activity. And now perfect intel local is back.  
---
"Game is developed for the player base."  
---
Yes that's true. But over the past 3 years the playerbase has become krabified BECAUSE of the krab favoring changes that have occurred. That's my point.
---
they are related. 
---
well pweh, because that wasnt my assumption, so i guess my argument hasnt been undermined, afterall... yay!
---
Inb4 he resigns from CCP
---
Lol, I scrolled up to the time you lost that in discord- We had a stratop running, OUT OF O8-, with Munins.
---
  I also see standup/citadel mods- Were you actually fighting on the grid of a citadel too? Were you poking for a response in our pvp staging as we had an entosis fleet out?...
---
Then: Whom to give access when? After payment? Buyers will be "pleased". Before payment? Suuuure...
---
You know, I don't think many people will be happy to pay $15 a month to be treated like cattle from a game design level...

lmao don't project.

"this place is *defined* by its stark, virulent, rabid opposition to nullsec"
---
The question "Do you view players isolating their PVE activities to alts and into farm holes as a positive or negative influence on the WH space ecosystem?" have an interesting split: 474 positive, 240 Neutral, 617 negative. But you allowed more than one answer so it isn't 1:1. What do you think about farm holes?
---
~~On the question of "What do you view as the top priority to fix/improve for WH Space PVE" the third highest response was "improvements and buffs to Capital Escalations". Why did this not make your suggestion and improvements slide?~~ I noticed you didn't make any PvE recommendations aide from astra farming, adding scrams, and raising the material usage to make t3s. What do you think about the myriad of ideas for PvE in WH space? (better moon goo, adding ice belts, changes to anioms, etc.)
---
I didn't see any comments in the slides about Pyrolancea or mass changes for more battleships. Do you have any thoughts on the results?
---
Are you planning on doing a survey before every summit, or is this a one time deal because you got a presentation in the summit? If so, what questions would you change/remove/add?
---
There were a lot of comments about deleting C4 space. What are you thoughts on deleting C4 space?
---
&gt; but then again, if something doesnt effect me, it could also mean there's also a good chance it doesnt effect that many others.
---
This is the assumption.
---
&gt;empathy doesnt need to extend to codify every fringe element of a system that people are supposedly well versed in adaptation within
---
This is the argument.
---
Well as long as you're having a good time more power to ya. I'd find what you described very frustrating and I'd make the argument that solo doesn't have to mean battleship suicide mission.
---
As far as time obligations forcing you into a solo existence, I kinda understand but at the same time there are multiple public fleet options where you could even learn to FC since you've done lots of solo and get blobbed less. 
---
I guess I sincerely feel a little bad for you  and if you'd like some in game advice just find my character of the same name any time.
---
I hate blackout, but something what can be use for attack or for traps should be nice. And as well defenders can get at least killmail, so both sides can have action.
---
i dont want delete rolling wormholes but make it big problem  there is few reason to roll holes..examples
---
1.to deny eventual content,roll the pvp hole to mine your gas alone
---
2.you roll the hole because this one is empty and no content inside to interact
---
3.you roll the hole because a)  your static sucks becuz u want be near tradehub  b) second static has notthing valuable,you roll it for better one
---
4. you roll the hole  because you can
---
ps. i lived in c4 space for quite long,left due to stagnation.now only nomad wormhole playing c5 c6 ninja mining gas.
---
My stance is, more isk is better. But it needs to spread out. If people have more isk they are more willing to lose said isk. If new players have more isk they can catch up faster and so on.
---
Were there economic issues? For sure, I fking hate the Rorq and I wish they would delete excavators already. But dont blame us for doing what CCP has told us to do. They communicate via changes and we work with what they give us.
---
So Im not on the other side of your argument, I say we dont need scorch earth cause people will just stop logging in. Which happened right? But we do need changes.
---
just do it in shuttles for giggles,would still consume time,but now  you cannot predict when wormhole actually ends,it can be any time.
---
Was a great session. I appreciate all the work you put into it.
---
Very much not wrong, solo gila gets killed when i'm out solo, 4 BS's ratting the same site together don't and i often get chased off by organised groups, sometimes i die in a fire other times i kill something and escape or just get away.          
---
I think post blackout its going to be back to cloaky camping or nano gang for everything
---
what is the assumption and what is the argument? it isnt clear what you are saying, at all
---
What is the advantage of this over just having local?
---
Opinions are like assholes; most everyone has one.
---
Also, they're usually full of shit.
---
No you don't understand that was the assumption. Its 37.5 man hours just in waiting for polarization timers.
---
have a look on dotlan npc kills in 2 weeks monday over period basis...sleepers gona reactivate(aka russian bots)
---
Going by the game wide data CCP gives us, it is.
---
using stuff made with pi
---
&gt;when it was hard to find targets in null.  
---
Uhm, when exactly was that? No srsly i got almost 1T killed on my killboard in the past month while running into targets pretty much every day. have we been playing the same game?
---
bro wash the cumstains off your monitor
---
Just adapt
---
having oportunity to bring a army of titan supers trough a ibis cyno wasnt shit dude?
---
Why Dust514 wasnt connected up to EVE's PI to begin with was always puzzling me.
---
Then his decision to drive out a large number of players in a short period of time looks even worse.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Portillos Spokeswoman: We would like to spend this October in recognition/honor of Chicagoland’s EVE community.
---
A nothing of a pilot thinks they understand how game development should work. Other news, OP is a role player. 
---
I don't rat, I just understand the plight. Imagine if you did.
---
Give it 5 more years. Learn and than tell me your opinion on our game.
---
Everyday, sample:
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78642330/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78642330/) 
---
For two hours - 30 gates jumping around the regions - we got a rookie ship and a gnosis in ustz prime w/ 2nd largest coalition in game.
---
you can repeat that till your ears bleed if you want, but it wasn't just krabs leaving, multiple folks in goons I flew with who did nothing but PVP just gave up trying to play due to the nosedive in the number of targets out in space lately.
---
then even
---
This doesn't deal with the thousands of supers and titans in the game already. The game is effectively ruined until these are nerfed.
---
so lets cut all limits by half.. now better?   it will take less but still risky
---
quite accurate honestly
---
who was that completely unaware and unattractive sounding dread pilot
---
Is that what I said dickwad? Comprehension isn’t one of your strengths is it?
---
The best part was they all read the part of the MER that showed falling rat bounties and mining amounts, but didn't go one page farther down the document to see a dip in the graph showing ships dying in pvp that numbered in the trillions. They pick and choose what data they use because they can;t actually make an argument for what they want any other way.
---
&gt; T3s Ishtars Svipuls Trig ships are overpowered (and remain that way for years? before being made useless)
---
Mate you'd have to be an absolute space hopper to think there's any comparison between Trig ships and the absolute meta dominating power of Ishtars during their era and T3s from basically 2011-2017.
---
Is that what I said dickwad? Comprehension isn’t one of your strong points?
---
If only CCP would first fix anomaly/signature initialization code for wormholes at least. I'm sure that some amount of wormhole connections don't get created, because the wormhole object is not initialized and thus K162 timer is not started. After fixing that, it would be a bit easier to see how much we should grow the spawn rate of wormholes or if we should lower the K162 visibility delay.
---
I hope you guys realize how depressed i am with the blackout
---
How's that "victimhood?" Shit, I wouldn't come here if it was a GSF echo chamber. What would be the fun in that?
---
give em a day or two, they'll go back to their conspiracy theory that will control hilmar like a puppet. And I can't wait for the narrative that Olmeca was flipped at the CSM summit and is now pro-goons, to start making the reddit rounds.
---
Not being able to identify who is in a system will retain the anonymity of the blackout, the live character counter suggested will not, consequently a middle ground. A local which reveals everyone, is worse IMO.
---
That's actually beautiful. Thank you, CCP.
---
claiming that people are defined by their "stark virulent rabid opposition" to you sounds like a paranoid victim complex to me.
---
U/querns_gsf
---
I think what it comes down to is u/ccp has no road map and no idea where to start to adjust eve. What all this chaos era is them scrambling about like a headless chicken.
---
I'm out living the high life.  Dinners in the oven
---
It's not risky. It's just obnoxious. Some people's mains get rolled out every time (because not everyone has a dozen alts) it takes way longer to roll. Oh and it's a massive buff to nullsec invading wh space because now they can bring 900 dreads into your hole.
---
Hell no, if that much nerd splatter made it onto the screen then your keyboard must be some sort of encrusted apocalypse.
---
This is most def an acceptable change. 15-30 sec max or until you break cloak. The only thing I dont really know is how to give an advantage to the hunter in big systems. Might be okey to remove the gate cloak aspect but it needs testing. 
---
No change will work unless everyone is actually in on it.
---
"nothing of a pilot"  
---
Woah we got an elite Eve player here.  
---
The plight is simple. Game's been flooded with krab favoring changes. Krabs make a much higher ratio than pvpers. Designers have to favor majority or their game tanks. Self fulfilling prophecy.
---
You mean they’re pussies for wanting to protect their alliance mates, unlike you wanting to kill a defenceless ship in a gank like a pussy?
---
30% playerbase loss in a 4 month period is pretty much unheard of in an MMO unless its on the way out. But go ahead, keep acting like the server numbers weren't tanking.
---
Thanks! Appreciate it. 
---
I do get frustrated, but then I rise...
---
If u/ccp will code a delay linked to your cloaked timer would be an idea.
---
After wiping my screen to understand what you were talking about I could clearly see the ops screen was dirty, for shame.
---
where the F@&amp;\* did you get your masters degree?  A Cracker Jack box?
---
Hey I'm sure the turbo krabs and bot farms are happy now.
---
  Don't cry to the PvP'ers when you start bitching about stagnation again.
---
  !remindme 6 months
---
Dude 5 minutes is enough to do all the damage you want to do. Its no change from the current cause it wont take a hunter that long to find you.
---
Thanks blackout for 1.65b plexes!
---
Empty systems exist everywhere, near2 doesn't do a damn thing unless you get reported. And plenty of people don't use it, when I came back to the game and found out it existed my first thought was it had to be considered cheating, when I found out it wasn't I still didn't use it because it feels like cheating,

---
&gt; a very SHARP decline...
---
  of krabs, bots and rorq fleets
---
I said a place was defined so, not people.
---
&gt; that the leaders of the big NS blocks made it sound like it's a shit mechanic
---
  Never heard anything negative from the top brass of TEST. They just carried on doing their thing.
---
&gt; Woah we got an elite Eve player here.
---
It's odd you do you, your etc. with all the krab, pve hateful shit and than when faced with this irony you react as such. Goofball.
---
It's simple, you're not ready to have an opinion. Go back to the drawing board and formulate better ideas. All I ask is less dumb, little less shit - little more desirable content. The dumbass leet pvp vs krab shit is your bag, I'm just reminding you you're a nothing of a little shit in EVE.
---
And who defined the place as such?
---
What a pants on head retarded idea you managed to formulate there.  Its actual quite impressive how terrible it is!
---
Read, stop roleplaying
---
I feel like a lot of the more vocal and emotional people here forget EVE is just a video game at the end of the day. On top of that, a video game that is notoriously bad at bringing on new players.
---
If you just change things so much that it isn't fun anymore for some players, they're just gonna stop playing. There's so much other stuff on the market that can hold a player's attention, even if it's not EVE.
---
It's not "adapt or die" anymore, it's "adapt or go play something else"...
---
The problem with reseting the standings, is that people will switch of faction too much easy.
---
Gee, I don't know. Too bad reddit doesn't put usernames on posts.
---
Sure, except a scout will be much more important. There will be less camping in someones space, a well placed scout can warn the entire pocket to dock up when someone jumps the gate. Cloaky campers would probably still be a thing but hey, its another counter to having local.
---
MMOs for people 40+ who works fulltime, have a family and kids, cannot rely on their being logged on for more than a few hours every week. I want to pvp. If I farm, I don't get to pvp much...
---
"hateful" lol  
---
So now because I think certain game designs are poor for the game I am "hateful." Do you feel hated? Should I get you some warm milk and cookies? Missing what the irony is here. Instead of actually addressing the arguments in the OP you cry about someone being hateful.
---
Given your reddit name... and your concern for c1s rolling, im suprised you havent heard of the gnosis roller.
---
u/tuz had a good link of the numbers due to blackout.
---
You're welcome.
---
I will have the courage to wipe mine next sunday
---
what other mmo can you be hunted down and killed in literally any part of the playable game?
---
Looks awesome just please don't try and stick it in your wormhole.
---
And those usernames are....people.  
---
ta-da....
---
biomass and leave the sub then
---
oh fun, more rorqs

---
All 4 engagements on the same day as your Velator there. with and i'm not even sure i did as many jumps as you. Idk man, i think you're doing something wrong.
---
In null security space (0.0), the Local chat channel displayed the names of any characters in the system, like it does in highsec and lowsec. Wormhole space never displays the character names until that character speaks in the channel. "Blackout" enabled this for nullsec space as well, which is where most of the game's big alliances are. Thus, you couldn't tell who was in the system with you simply by looking at Local. You had to be very careful and use more active intel channels. That's being rolled back, and now you'll be able to have perfect information again on Monday.
---
About the war in high sec, most lowsec players use alters for high sec activities, like moving items to lowsec.
---
Standings do not matter to much if you dedicate your char to lowsec. But for casual visitor to lowsec it's a barrier.  Which I think is pointless, punishing people for doing pvp which people that want to do pvp. what ?
---
Incursion gate rats don't spawn in highsec
---
Yeah, I lost what you were trying to talk about.
---
Remember the basics.
---
Like the fucking printscreen button
---
when did we get an oven?
---
M8 no. That would not only change the number of jumps to kill a hole from ~8-16 to several hundred, it would also make it entirely up to chance if it were just numbers of jumps. Also means you can shove a 50 man heavy armor BS fleet through a hole with effectively no risk. I'm sorry but it's just not a good route.
---
&gt; or just an ongoing cost in heavy water to stay cloaked
---
Explorers who cloak as part of normal operations would not like this
---
If your being an idiot like omeca was it deserved to be pointed out.
---
u/bbtb3 had good data to counter the argument that had every area instead of cherrypicked data.
---
Not surprising. You claimed I was posting something about being a victim. I pointed out how literally a few days ago you were whining that "this place is defined by stark and virulent opposition" to you (nullsec.) And I pointed out that claiming people were against you like this sounded like a paranoid victim complex. Then you said "this place not the people." I asked who made it so. You stated usernames to which I pointed out that those are people.  
---
Conversations might go better if you actually remember what you're saying.
---
Ah, okay. No, then. You're wrong. Glad I could help.
---
How exactly were people supposed to adapt their strategy when it became 100x more difficult for sov holders to defend their space than it was for any rando in a wandering bomber gang to blap anything in space? 
---
You're sort of like that Wormholer a couple of weeks ago when people were complaining they weren't making money in null anymore, who said, "you guys have no imagination, why don't you day trip into wormholes?" 
---
The answer is, morons, if the people complaining wanted to day trip in wormholes, they would have already. Why in the fuck should we be paying for a game that forces us to engage in game play we specifically do not want to engage in? Or in other words, its not cowardice, its I pay $45 a month to play an internet spaceship game that I derive fun from, and when it is changed to not be fun, I am not going to keep logging in (and paying $45 a month) so you can have fun while my eyes bleed.
---
Imagine writing "so" before your sentence,
---
Being stupid enough to think anyone could lack the understanding that you're about to disingenuously characterize what someone else said in your words. Play 5 more years and formulate better ideas, stop roleplaying a 'PVPer". The End.
---
that cost money cuz some1 need to work for that shit
---
I loled.  Take my fucking upvote.
---
Maybe try log off button
---
They posted something that could be taken that way, and in retrospect probably was, yes. It wasn't explicit though.
---
I do believe you're retarded.  You'll have nothing to hunt if noone is krabbing.  Krabs = defense fleets around = content for both the krabs, defense fleets, and the hunters.
---
yeah,is a bad taste they bend the knee to carebears...wish they had balls and nerf npc bounty in botting systems so mofos need to move caravan after x npc bounty collected...diminish the bounty payed after some 24/7  ratting
---
this post will be removed just like my post
---
no, sorry. you undocked in null security space, you consented to your own death.
---
Imagine ending your sentence with "The End."  
---
Again you are whining and claiming I am hateful simply because I pointed out the krabification of the game. "Play the game more." I'd suggest the same for you but I think you're using most of your IQ just formulating sentences here.
---
Hmm, for hunters in large systems - maybe bigger systems have a longer delay, for the “local scan system”, or whatever lore, to survey the whole system.
---
97% of high class space is a farm. I actually find that figure if accurate to be kind of depressing, but it explains a lot of the burnout some of my corp felt when scanning endless chains of empty C5's
---
Did you sense any kind of movement or inclination to mix up anything in wormhole space?
---
Oh hey :)  I owe you a beer in exchange for the quality tears +1
---
That is for making Eve great again ♡
---
It's your own words. You claimed the place was "virulent in it's opposition to you." I pointed out that sounds extremely paranoid to assume people are against you. You said "it wasn't the people it's the place." I asked who. You stated usernames (AKA people.) You proved yourself wrong.
---
&gt;but if it doesnt work I want it gone. 
---
Blackout worked amazingly well. Amount of isk grinding across eve dropped to all time low. And now it will continue again and plex prices are going to skyrocket and bots will come back again :/
---
Imagine being a goon krab and being so assblasted that olmeca blew up your rorq mining drones that you're forced to kill your own IQ points enough to agree with any dumb thing querns says.
---
u/ccp and recent number decline would have to disagree
---
I've been a pirate too. I have the feeling I find more engages being in the militia.
---
Always there is people farming that get out of the plex, but when you plex in a defended system, hey that is different.

Low effort post. Negligible additional contribution to current debate. Fits better as a comment on a long thread where you have to go to "more comments" to see the truly unimportant comments.

Probably like $2-5 or something like that depending on how much electricity it cost￼ lol. Materials is quite cheap
---
Approximately 16 hours lol
---
This update will bring botting back in a major way, which is TERRIBLE for the Eve economy. Although, to be fair to CCP you just need to look at server activity to see why they're doing this... Can't really blame them, just wish this wasn't the case.  
---
 [http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) (Set the graph to a year)

---
Nah.
---
&gt; The last year was making carriers ratting unsafe and ratting garbage.
---
Stopped reading after this.
---
OHHHH yeah I forgot about that minmatar ships are a pain in the ass. I also used meshmixer to cut the STL into two files so you can print something huge
---
Woosh! Thats atleast 100x faster then training for it
---
Also they break down a lot
---
Blackout v1 was badly implemented. Internal map, few other non-intel asset and external websites still offered the intel needed for any hunter with a brain able to use them correctly to get interesting locations, while the preys lost everything apart the Dscan who isn't really decent enough as a tool for self-protection.
---
People hate lose, and people aren't all stupid or masochist enough to accept everything and anything. CCP didn't make a correct Blackout, and so players rather left than playing this kind of game... or punishment, because it could have been interpreted like it. Maybe a balanced one would have limited the damage, but who knows ?
---
Maybe CCP can reiterate a new Blackout experiment "v2" with decent balancing as (again) a sort of event, but not before a long time as many still need to digest what happened.
---
No local, nullbears HTFU, and some tweaks to covert cynos so you can't get hot dropped by a whole fleet without seeing them come through gate. And some higher value gated sites to bring the reward up to match the new risk level - step 1 could just be to have more null incursions.
---
But the nullbears have stamped their feet and screamed and CCP have given in so I guess there's no hope for a balance of risk.
---
Very nive
---
These are from 09:00 - 26:00 and this is all you got?
---
my ears....
---
What intel do hunters need from external sites to hunt? What was unbalanced?
---
I'm not going to argue anymore about the scaling of things, i think we both have said what we wanted to say and neither of us is going to change our opinion. I will address the second part of your response though.
---
Graphics are always an issue when it comes to a games popularity. Hell, the timeframe you mentioned is arguably one of the most graphic intense overhauls the game went through in its entire history. That was when Walking in Stations was being hyped and a ton of new ships and content was being added to the game. 
---
In fact, with walking in stations they were actively trying to target the very problem I am talking about in the OP, albeit by making a station environment we could walk around in as opposed to changing how we view our ships in space. They knew, even back at that time, that the graphics just were not very engaging. Since they abandoned that effort you can see that they have tried to focus on other areas to improve what we see, such as celestial's, ship skins and large scale in space effects. IE: Cyno's, jump gate animations, etc. Those things still don't form any connection with us and our ships and make us feel like we are actually flying through space though.
---
your bias is making you look like a moron in front of all these fine people.
---
just an FYI.
---
Pods weren’t doing it for me anymore, that’s why I upgraded to this ￼;)
---
Should have stopped reading when you saw who was posting tbh
---
So why drive out the other side now too then? I think someone didn't quite think this through.
---
hey, just sorted someone out on twitter.. was that you? :D
---
Let’s petition CCP to make building Titian’s as fast as 3d printing them :P￼
---
Says the high sec carebear that wants his rats to be in zkill and give kill marks.

Surprisingly I’ve been printing nonstop on this machine for over a year and I have never had any issues, but I know some of the economy models tend to have issues quite frequently￼

&gt;What in the literal satan-worshipping fuck is wrong with some people
---
You leave my dad out of this.
---
&gt;You can't really multibox 15 PvP accounts.
---
But if you're in a C5 corp, you're expected to try.
---
Blackout was a good thing. Krabs HTFU.
---
&gt;  People who saw Eve as primarily a PvP game with PvE as a supporting function left and people who played Eve for the PvE aspect who saw PvP as a casual F1 occurrence/nuisance multiplied due to the stabilizing/stagnating factors listed above.
---
This is 100% the truth. The drop in players that mattered came in the long years before the blackout. Old PVP EVE was effectively already dead when blackout came and tried to revive it. RIP
---
DASRO
---
Actually it agrees lmao. Once people lost their safety blanket (hi-sec parallel) they quit playing. I get it though, they didn't have time for an emergency fireside chat to tell you what you're narrative needs to be yet.
---
That would be your former lover.
---
At what point is he wrong?
---
Besides olmeca generally steals drones not blow them up. No profit in that.
---
Whoa, TWO buckets?  How rich do you think I am, pal?
---
thats awesome! now you must show us the multiple rorquals you used to krab for it.
---
Rather than the quick death chaos era was bringing
---
Lets be real. Now that CCP has shown they'll cave when Null bears ban together to drop PCU counts nothing will ever be done to upset them again.
---
Delayed local. They'll just unsub their farm toons for 2 months while ccp sweats at the lost revenue until the back down. 
---
any change that appears to increase the risk of living in space that has infinite spawning isk generation will just cause the null bears to protest with their wallets and CCP will cave.
---
the status quo is now set.
---
CCP will no longer be able to act to save their game.
---
At every point. I posted his post. Read it and tell me what is right about it and what evidence he has to back it.
---
I get the 3D printing but how did you extract the model from the game files?
---
Dotlan and zkill are pretty good indicators
---
These were literally 2 small roams in 2 different timezones. One to Brave space (we left right after running into these wh guys) and one to Delve, both roughly an hour. 09:00 - 21:00 = 12 hours, roughly 9 of which i wasn't even online. You got anything else to say?
---
Which work both ways and hardly compare to the perfect intel local gives or citadel spam protection.
---
There's no such thing as a "ratting ship" in EVE they're all PVP ships that have been gimped in every other aspect but in terms of killing NPCs. And yes CCP can fix that by making sites require webs tackle wtc. They're trying to do that with Abyssal sites. I hope that one day all anoms will be at least as complex if not more than Abyssal sites just in normal space.
---
Good luck guys.
---
I'm sorry, does your local tell you different info than mine? Mine just tells me someone is logged in the system. That's hardly perfect intel.
---
I reckon you are correct. It is the biggest. I like your furry analogy, too.
---
People straight up lie about what near2 does. It tracks channel logs and uses those to give alerts if people are near you. The lie comes from people implying the moment you jump into a system it reports you, the reports are done by someone saying into chat that a person is in the system. So at the basics it facilitates communication and creates alerts.
---
TEST has a home brew tool similar to it but it is not near2.
---
Unless you're buying titans to whelp, EVE is down there with bird watching and hiking in terms of cost.
---
yeah... just about time when the blackout is ending, so essentially the bots had like, what? a week or 2 of actual blackout. and god knows what other methods of data scraping they might be using other than the official tools that require zero effort...
---
Thx!
---
It was massively unbalanced mate and you know it. There is a reason why no local works in WHs but not in a place where you can light cynos or places that see a lot of traffic on a regular basis. A compromise would work but not const, local with a small delay. Thats the best youre gonna get without mass exodus.
---
Could other changes be implemented? Sure, but balance.
---
Nothing much to say except I don't know the length of time, we didn't go to Delve nor had a Thera connection. We just roamed in null for two hours and found nothing in the 2nd largest coalition in game at 02:00. Would invite you to play outside your current perspective and live without Thera. That's where most of the paying subs are.
---
Who is in the system, you can look them up, see what they fly, who they are with. At the very least even if you are the typical sub 80 IQ krab you can click one button and warp to the safety of a citadel.
---
To give an idea of how safe C6 is, less isk is killed in C6 combined than C1 combined. C6 holes likely have the highest isk printed/isk lost ratio in the game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/m6WVneF.png
---
at the start of the blackout we had zkill and dotlan blackout too, iirc the hunters started whining and that blackout lasted only a few days...
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Ever think that maybe the model of mining your Corp had was way too heavily fixed on production and no security? Yeah, needing security and not having money for it because all of the assets are in mining is going to be a problem, especially if you didn't have any players in Corp originally for security, which you should have.

Damn sorry I thought you was the step son I just met

---
"it was unbalanced and you know it" isn't really an argument.  
---
Again "mass exodus" is due to the fact that we have so many krabs in the game now. Maybe we just need a gradual exodus while pvpers return to the game.
---
If you use rapid heavy, you can even get half the damage bonuses.
---
They also did it to a guristas sotiyo which hliairiously got deleted when horde turned up in longbow corms to blap the booshers.
---
I hope you’re wrong. You’re not wrong, are you?😓
---
Exooki,
---
Back when I joined your corporation, and got to know you, I knew that as soon as you signed up as a csm it was a great choice for the wh community.
---
Keep being great, it's exactly what my opinion was of you back then, and it still is.
---
As a porp pilot, I applaud this kill and hope I never fall prey to it.
---
Lmao. Adapt or die, idiot.
---
I meant Dotlan, mostly. Ingame map is just a less practical version of it.
---
What was unbalanced, well... That is why I said "with brain".
---
NPC killed in last 24 hours give you where there should be some targets to kill in the next days, as chances that they remains is rather high... Average Players Docked/Space can give you the most populated location of nullsec, and so the one with high probably to find targets. Jumps in the 24 hours can help to find the best area of passage and so to camp, etc.
---
ADM can help too. Show Info on the system name, Sovereignty tab, you wait few minutes and reload the window. If it still go up then chances are there are targets to kill right NOW.
---
On the other side... Kills in last hour ? Not relevant, could be some killed by NPC or stupidly. Dscan ? Please, be serious one second...
---
Maybe Local is too powerful, but no Local with the rest untouched make hunters too powerful. EVE is a special ecosystem where both sides can survive even even if PVE players are on the advantage. But if PVP players get the advantage, then it dies as any other ecosystem.
---
Right? It's like other years are also special like this year, and have summer ending, schools starting, and popular games getting reboots. When will they get that this year is different.
---
Time to buy Netflix stock
---
Yes cuz C6 ratting is very scaleable, like multiboxing 15 rorquals for 3 years risk free
---
I used to be a super builder / uber-crabber multiboxing rorqs but I got bored and gave all my stuff away a year ago. Now I just screw around in an astero and 3D print stuff lol
---
Dammit, just I was really buying into that immortality lore...
---
If you can find it in wspace you sure can. but be warned you want have local so i'm sure you won't enter
---
I am supposed to recognize you?
---
They tricked everyone. Got people to resub and then cancelled the blackout before the other cancelled subs actually cancelled.
---
It really doesn't. People still pved during black out. They just couldn't pve with 99 percent safety like they once did. And now with the cyno changes it means cyno hunters will require to fly more expensive less maneuverable ships like recons.  
---
PvEers still have:  
---
1. supercap umbrella
---
2. citadels in every system
---
3. ansiblex gates (alliance only)
---
4. cyno jamming modules
---
5. etc
---
&gt; Stop nerfing things into the ground, and breaking entire playstyles in a single patch.
---
Blackout would have gone over better if they chose the slow and experienced development route. Game goes back to broken cloud local now. I suspect we'll get where we want, just gradually instead of trying to chase bonus korean bucks.
---
Which still isn't perfect intel. "Here's a name, do research" 
---
And honestly, if you are so easy to read that I can look at your killboard and make a guess at what you're flying now, you need to shake up your ship types and friends.
---
As a (relatively) new player in my opinion it made eve more fun to play eve even as a prey (which I am, 99% of the time), because whatever I'm doing there's a much bigger chance to have that guy trying to hunt me down, or that group of players that i should find my way around, feels more like playing a game where i have to take steps to either succeed (ad avoidance in this case) or fail and die rather than a job doing x,y,z everyday and logging out without anything new coming around.
---
I can't say from a pvp hunter/fleets perspective but I would assume it made it easier to find targets rather than having everyone dock in once they've been seen in local, also one thing I've noticed is the cloak and wait thing, like if you see someone in dscan and then you cloak away, that person won't know if you're still inside that site/warped and waiting or left the system, they also won't know your zkill history (to determine whether you're mostly exploring/mining/etc or pvping so to decide whether to run or stay), both info being available pre-blackout because of local.
---
tl;dr: more things to do as a prey with either success/fail depending on you and your enemy, more mystery to know who's that person in your dscan, and more targets to find as a hunter because they won't run once they see you in local. As a new player, I absolutely love the Blackout.
---
Get a better job
---
This post started off good but then devolved into crying about people not playing the way you do.
---
Basically you correctly identified the problems but then went on to suggest things that don't fix the actual problems. Local was the least problematic of the 5 you listed so why don't we address that last.
---
The only thing we really learned here is that ccp is incapable of iterative changes. All they did was an on/off switch where there is giant middle ground that requires work for them.
---
Amusingly during blackout anyone proposing a compromise was laughed at and called a pathetic krab or worse. Now that ccp has reversed course, pvp players suddenly are OK with a compromise and pve players are looking at those who scorned that idea  less than a week ago and laughing. Why couldn't those who liked blackout have grasped the consequences and helped push ccp for a middle ground. You wanted everything when you had it but it didn't work out.
---
Adding local to wormholes would cause chaos, indeed. CCPlease!!
---
i was doing it all in 500mn stabber.  gnosis name de to Generally Not Only Sitting In Stratios
---
Let me ask you something. If you are ratting and you see some enemy enter local, how hard is it to get to a citadel and be safe?
---
Your comment displays a gross simplification of the relationship between intel given to players and how local instantly displays who is in system. 
---
Please try again later.
---
Not if you don't belong here no.
---
K get fucked, retards like you almost killed the game.
---
You get it!
---
Gilabrain control master tower down
---
And half of them will continue not playing... while we have to deal with it. This has happened with many changes before.
---
It's easier to remove local than it is for CCP to iterate on 5 different things which will take years to fix (or if they ever do.) Removing local allows krabs to have their safety nets, except now they actually have to pay attention to the game rather than just be AFK. There's more of you krabs with more accounts because this game allows pve accounts to scale way better than pvp ones and that's the only reason this is getting reversed. Not because you're correct about the game. Not because you have an actual argument.
---
I have 1 Titan in a station and it dies, how do you do 80%? You just can't start having citadels drop assets.
---
You can have the asset recovery fee go to the alliance with most damage.

My favorite proposal though is a partial revert back to the way stations handled asset safety. You can only transfer assets to a citadel in system, doesn't matter who owns it. This leaves several options, leaving the assets locked up until a friendly citadel anchors, transferring them to a hostile station and fire sale, try to move them out via courier, try to get a spy in.
---
Which one of the low brow comments people like you have spammed for the past couple of months do I quote back at you?

It's not ruining the game, it's ruining your game?

There is a wormhole sales channel? What is it?
---
Where the fuck did you buy a fit hel for 7bil is what I want to know?
---
What I would be cool with is if they took out the blackout and added a system to make anomalies respawn less in heavily farmed systems. 
---
You would have to farm all the different systems you own, no more turtling in 3 systems to fund the entire alliance.
---
Just a pipe dream though.
---
&gt;People who played Eve for the PvE aspect who saw PvP as a casual F1 occurrence/nuisance multiplied due to the stabilizing/stagnating factors listed above ... The PvE'er became entitled to the idea that if danger comes to them they can simply click warp and land safely on a citadel. 
---
This is a point I'm increasingly hammering on in my push for a total PvE system revamp. Eve's PvE system has always been fundamentally anti-content: PvE ships can't fight, relying on either warpout or backup. They take so long to pay for themselves (supers are like, what, 30 hours of ratting? more?) that dying is catastrophic for your efficiency. There's no concept of "acceptable risk" - ***any*** level of risk is unacceptable. You either avoid/mitigate it, or you don't go krabbing. 
---
This means that an optimized PvE setup (in terms of your alliance/umbrella, ship selection, backup, intel, etc) is one where content never happens. There is zero PvP. 
---
This has gotten much worse since the introduction of rorquals because now, having an optimum PvE setup is critical to being a powerful sov alliance, since rorqs are what build you your titans. 
---
This is the fundamental conflict at the heart of Eve's game design: it incentivezes us to remove all the reasons we actually play Eve. We strive for total safety/no content, because that's how we can make the best isk. (Furthermore, making the best isk is critical to having the best titan fleet, which is what makes you the best alliance.)
---
I'm not entirely sure how to manage it, but we need a PvE overhaul that removes this duality. We need it set up so that the best iskmaking either *is content* or encourages content.
---
Lol nice one.
---
Amarr empire wants to know your location
---
All joking aside, this is an awful way of looking at your fellow players, especially when there aren't any new ones coming in. 
---
You can not make an entire play style in a sandbox game utterly random and miserable and expect everyone to just keep playing it.
---
I have lived outside of Thera for 7 years, have been in several large null alliances and quit last year because i was bored to death by how the game was going. And that was in the middle of a "war" with supposedly more than enough content. I resubbed when the blackout hit because i hoped CCP would finally try to stop the visible degeneration of null and the game as a whole. Killed some time with high sec pve new (Invasions) and not so new (FOBs) till i ran into a new and aspiring Theracorp. Since they were also allied to V0LTA which i had much respect for ever since the time when they were the spearhead of TRI i thought "might aswell try" even though wormholes had always been something i couldn't really get into (i tried 5 years ago but living out of a pos really wasn't my thing). I had more fun in the game since i joined them than ever before.
---
Well we just learned removing local was a failure, they could have iterated that now that pvpers lost their toy and ate willing to talk. Amusingly even your much hated krabs still think changing local is a good idea because they see beyond the instant gratification that you want.
---
The point is drastic changes aren't good, and drastic changes to a symptom instead of the actual problem is even worse.
---
So that is a no.
---
Krabs and hunters need each other, some are hybrids.  I don't really see why this is a problem.  Pure krabs will probably never know they are part of the circle of life. But they are.
---
Take my fucking upboat
---
I don't know anything about it but looks sturdy, mine had to be custom built so it breaks, but not too much
---
A PvP ship that goes ratting will still eat shit to a smallgang if it gets caught. There's no real way around it. I dunno what a good way to counter that is; instanced PvP/PvE combos (like the abyssal gauntlet but not shit), or stuff that requires ratting fleets (like incursions but not mandatory 2bil battleships)
---
What makes you the lord of what people are?
---
How about, if you like blackoutyou are no better than people who suicide gank new players.
---
This is a fun game, you go again.
---
Yup it was!
---
I feel less bad about ExookiZ and his pals blowing up my Gila earlier today
---
Thank you!
---
I hope someone picks up that phone...
---
...because I f\*\*king called it!
---
I just hope that he doesn't get off scot-free after that stupid stunt...but the sad reality is that he almost certainly will. People will likely swarm back to the game now (which, in and of itself, is a good thing), while people who resubbed FOR blackout are still subbed, with the net result of making Hilmar look *very* good in the time leading up to his bonus payout. The reality of the matter, that he generated that brief window of "success" by screwing over the playerbase and compromising the health of the game itself, will most likely end up forgotten and swept under the rug.
---
Maybe Hilmar and Falcon at least learned a lesson from this incident, but most likely their only takeaway from this is that there are limits to how far they can push people.
---
Blackout is the bandage. Now it needs to be replaced with actual development. A lot of reasons for blackout still need to be answered somehow through game development - it just wasn't the perfect fit for the time.
---
Oh now the pvpers want a middle ground, but during blackout when a middle ground was suggested everyone screamed adapt or die.
---
Pvpers are a bunch of hypocrites.

Have a standing fleet - there's plenty of ratting T3Cs as it stands.
---
This is the best, an unwanted player who classifies himself as “huntable” target yet  dock when neuts are 4 jumps out. You have a solid foundation for a argument........
---
Back before the game was flooded with your kind. Plenty of people not only ratted, they fought to protect their territory. If a neut entered system, they came out to fight. Not everyone was like this but the majority were. They didn’t need to blob up either. Those were worthy targets that the game needs back. You, you are not a target or anything i want sticking around. You are what i like to call a tumor. 
---
#purgethecancer
---
It's more about the take away. You don't take very much away  from eve and it can easily take up a lot of time. in fact the way the game is structured, taking up a lot of your time seems to be a common practice for the developers to maintain control over certain in-game mechanics. so maybe at face value the costs of those things can be related, but there certainly is a sharp degree change when comparing  the benefits of playing eve vs like you said, bird watching or hiking.
---
Yahhhh but you’re still giving them 30seconds or more easy for them to click 1 button to initiate warp and be untouchable. When my legion decloaks next to a carrier that carrier has 7 seconds to jump out or initiate his warp if he is paying attention before I have him tackled. That’s way more than enough time for someone paying attention to right click ship or capacitor and jump out or right click station and click warp. 
---
Ppl looking for pvp content are at a huge disadvantage due to the pve guys being able to safe up. Most will just go afk and we’re stuck paying for subs and plex to run around looking for that one guy asleep at the keyboard.
---
I actually do not disagree.  
---
I think the trick is doing it in a way that still has people undocking and doings stuff and not taking their toys and going home.  
---
The problem with the current assault on NS PvE was that from the point of view of many, it made it a nonstarter even undocking most PvE in NS.  More so with the cyno changes.  Most reasonable people don’t mind risk, but just feeding expensive things is actually not a good time. 
---
Better ways of course to decreasing ISC/Ore in the economy  (you have to pick what you are trying to do with changes first) would be to changes anom respawn in some fashion.  People would not like it, because they have to work harder, but it would not literally turn off the meta of multibox mining that people like.  
---
Other would be to turn off excavators (like blackout did but more specifically to the problem of mining yield).  People could still undock in their Rorquals if they want, but just being in much less yield.  Again...decreasing the harm of game play but still letting people play in the sandbox.  
---
I just used mining as an example, but you get the idea.  Leave the door open for people to play the game they like, just mitigate the harm to the Eve economy.  
---
I think the real meat of increasing NS destruction is to change SOV, structure mechanics, TZ tanking that gives NS blocks an excuse to move around.  People don’t super rat or multibox Rorqual during a big war....well...must people at least.  Big wars and movement are the things that keep NS dangerous and interesting.
---
Why is it all these middle ground posts are by people who screamed down anyone who wanted a middle ground during the blackout? Why didn't you support this before?
---
What does that have to do with the ratio of isk vs and isk destroyed, which is a measure of safety.
---
Many horrible changes that supported carebearish playstyle. 08 were the glory days not this trash of a player base we have today.
---
Oh very easy. Assuming you are either aligned or are in a fast enough ship. I wasn't arguing that. I said it wasn't "perfect intel". I don't know if you're a in ship capable of killing me or not. If I log in and you're there, I don't know how long you've been there. I don't know if you're in a fleet or solo.
---
Is knowing you're in local a powerful tool? Sure. Is it "perfect intel"? No.
---
Lol...waiting to see him docked in 1DQ and with his multibox army messing with PL. :-)
---
Normally yes it's extremely obvious when they open.
---
I don't run T5s, but from what I understand the gate is unlocked already when you enter this special pocket, so it's likely not as obvious.
---
This. I think this just got easier to manage.
---
There's also no mechanic for trading bookmarks mentioned for this new system, meaning it's "send me isk and I'll give you access to a folder of bookmarks" instead of contracting a single/set of bookmarks. It's going to make trading more difficult as you can't simply set up a contract. Which is why I proposed a method to buy or subscribe to access lists.
---
How did i miss this survey?
---
Great presentation from it though! Some of those numbers surprised me, only 33% of low class peeps farm in low class, wow! And the turbofarming in C6 space is crazy.
---
Also in c1 a big eviction happened lately which nah skewed the numbers ;p
---
All the bots will come back so they can gleefully continue their RMT activities and not pay CCP a single dime to play the game as omega. This will give him the illusion of player activity that EVE had before, and that he wants apparently.
---
its really not that hard to lock down a system.  Watch the gate(the fewer the better), large bubble on gate, some sabres and shit on grid, mine mine mine.
---
&gt; all-or-nothing mentality
---
You won't have to worry about that, the financials went to ruins with that sort of development. Even if devs want to develop in a specific manner they need to answer to stake holders. So whatever CCP does they'll need to take the slow and gradual path of change, actually need to work and design a game instead of the broad strokes.
---
All us hunters need for fairness is 1-2 minutes of not being in local to be able to start a fight. VNIs and afterburning ships take the longest to catch up to. 2 min would make those possible. 1 min would be tough and force us into an arazu or Lachesis or rapier huginn. It’s not a big deal but it helps. Take too long and he can see u. Nbd
---
It's hard to imagine too many ways how local can be more perfect as an intel tool without coming out with completely lunatic examples like "tells me what ship you are in" or "allows me to warp to you."
---
It failed because it didn't revitalize the game. There are 100s of things they could have tried for local besides all or nothing, but the pvpers only wanted nothing once they got it. Just admit you don't actually want a compromise and stop campaigning for it. Pve players seemed to understand the long term implications of all or nothing, and still support a middle ground.
---
This!
---
Doubt forget we are all old pissy people now not kids.  We don’t like what a company is delivering with a product, we will get pissed and buy something else.  70% of us are looking for some excuse, and excuse, to actually stop playing and go to our kids sporting events.  :-)
---
I LOVE LAMP
---
I told CCP Falcon this when the blackout started that if CCP revert it, it's gonna piss off all the players that returned for the blackout, and keep players that left for the blackout from coming back due to trust issues. CCP didn't listen, what a surprise.
---
could just...distribute your assets and use multiple sources of income.  
---
I get the whole "collect all my shit in a single system" thing, but its honestly not worth it.
---
It's funny you say that because in wormholes, people _do_ risk super expensive shit all the time
---
So feelings not facts for you.
---
&gt;Maybe we just need a gradual exodus while pvpers return to the game.
---
Why did they leave in the first place? Possible reasons:  
---
1) Lack of ability to kill PvE players (umbrella to strong)  
---
2) Lack of engaging fights (grinding structures has reached a natural end, even prior to citadels)
---
3) Lack of meta narrative reasons for war (everyone is so well settled relationship wise and wealth wise at this point that the effort for a war seems silly)
---
PvE players do little to the latter two... them leaving isn't going to help the first. Did I miss any?
---
&gt;They are all dumbed down because the nain target market isn't going to memorize a 300 page manual like we routinely did back in the day.
---
You're right, most people play games to have some degree of fun.
---
A single bot account makes 250 mill / hour easily in null. That same bot account can't even make half that in high sec, and you're telling me there's no difference between where they are when literally half of the game pre-blackout was composed of bots?
---
The psychological seems to be the territory we are in now for long term acceptance of balance changes. I wish ccp could figure this out so we can get balance without killing the game.
---
I want StellarisxEVE
---
We've been oppressed for years.
---
Sleepers Rise Up!
---
so ganking a carrier with 8 sub caps is the same as HS ganking.  Your IQ is suspect to me
---
Covert cynos are a thing. It's actually very hard to lock down a system and this is what makes wspace safer.
---
Because as strange as this sounds to some people, you don't actually have to kill anyone to have fun in your own way. On top of that, this is just as valid away to play as the PVPheads who kill anything that moves.
---
You're lumping that "krabs" together and [actually dehumanizing them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization) as some kind of dumb, brainless bots who exist for your kill-mails instead of people who;d just rather enjoy EVE differently.
---
&gt;Constellation based local. That's right. Local is shared by 5-6 systems that make up constellations. 
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Yes and you know all this because of a month and a half of blackout.
---
Fuck off krab
---
Yeah, how dare they want to stay in business :eyeroll:
---
&gt; There weren’t that many ~~goons~~ untouchable bots out either compared to normal 
---
Did null not have local in '08?
---
Yeah outlined in the OP pretty damn well how krabbing is easy and hunting is not.
---
We would've lost the same number of humans anyway. The people who don't unsub are gonna leave their AFK ratters and bots running in the background while they play WoW
---
Hahaha nice, take an upvote
---
 Just go to hell dude. Die, scum!
---
I mean... yes. "How perfect can an intel tool be outside of giving it more intel?" is quite the issue. But no one is asking for more intel in local. 
---
My point is you have framed it now, the current existing system as "perfect" because you dislike the intel it gives and want it scaled back. I'm saying it's not perfect and can actually have more intel to give. It would come as no surprise that you would be against that. You think it's too strong as it is. 
---
However, there is no real way to lower any more. We just tried that and it failed, horribly. This is a place people live in, they own the space, they pay the ihub bills and jb fuel sov bills. Yea they're going to want to be able to do PvE activity in relative safety. So yea if they're basically paying attention in their own home, they would expect not to die.
---
RIP AC Caps....

---
Lmao. Someone who doesn't live in nullsec thinks they get to determine who should be allowed to live in nullsec.
---
Know who actually deserve to live in nullsec? The people who take it. Those groups have a lot more than the 2 types of people you think you have interacted with it.
---
Here's an idea. How about when you log into the game, if you are in your system, it asks you if you want to do any pvp. And if you don't, nobody can attack you. There. You can be safe.
---
There has always been a trust issue when selling BM for escalations. The buyer has no way of knowing if the bookmark is valid until after purchase.
---
Hasn't killed an NPC in 7 years, I'm willing to bet you have killed one more recently than me. Guess that makes you the real krab here.
---
And no it's ccp that knows it and walked it back.
---
I was responding to your comment about losing PvE players as if that's a solution in any way.  
---
More to the point... where are all these bloodthirsty PvP pilots that used to play? Why aren't they logging into shoot each other for the glorious battles while laughing at the carebears?
---
It's additionally hard because some peoples brains let them "grind" tasks such as mining or anomalies, so it needs to be something people are comfortable grinding. So depth and simplicity are at odds, making this design task all the more difficult. It's a shame there can't be minigames in mining or ratting that require unique input and also raise the bar for PVE content. Would be nice if during these games there were "chunks" to complete, rewards after the chunk as opposed to every mining cycle or delayed as with ratters, make it a choice to risk yourself on grid to complete the next chunk - but this is also at odds with how much time people have to play a session of eve.
---
Exploration did ok with mini-game. It would be interesting to see more varied minigames like this to differentiate other PVE whilst answering player written scripts that would automate the activities.
---
ThE nArRaTiVe
---
it was  driven by  wormholesales website.  there is calpf wormhole sales and interrift but not sure if any is still active
---
People would be better suited even making less isk/h if the activity was funner. The game can actually be better despite faucets decreasing instead of made more garbage.
---
10938.4 fathoms is 99.43 furlongs
---
You said all pve players are the same, so I can make stpud statements to. 
---
Thought we were trying to cone up with the dumbest statements and you set the bar high. I had to go all out.
---
Buy some tags :)
---
Since playing the game in 2011 if I combine all my time ratting I might reach 45 minutes. Most of that was just practicing fighter mechanics when they switched them up. So I seriously doubt that.
---
OP already explains WHY CCP did what it did.
---
Bots mining in hisec have such a smaller economic impact than bots ratting in nullsec, thought. I was getting excited that the inflation was actually starting to reverse...
---
It's hardly been two months of Blackout. And again pvpers aren't going to use as many accounts as krabs because multiple accounts don't scale as well.
---
I’ve always supported this, most “delay local” threads you will find a comment from me in support and offering my opinion. 
---
I never screamed down anyone regarding blackout posts, rather I saw the positives (which I loved) and the negatives (which didn’t affect me much). 
---
So what the fuck are you taking about??
---
it shouldn't.
---
There's no compromise, everything goes back to the way it is, CCP cash in on injectors and plex from the bots for another couple of years and then let the game sit idle while they work on another game.
---
Yea I think I better, eh )
---
They fly together too. For now....
---
The problem is that the metrics have been poor for years, with inflation on the rise and PCU ever decreasing. Something needs to change, and I want CCP to have all the support of the player base to try some new stuff.
---
Who are these supposed small groups who have taken big damage? It is true that conventional isk making methods are not available for these small groups anymore but they have adopted and dotlan shows it, there has been more and more smaller alliances emerging in dronelands and tribute for example. They have adopted to the blackout and instead of using T1 ships, they use undscannable rooks to rat
---
cyno change wont kill anything except make it a bit more expensive for defender to shit out a capital response.
---
game is dying because of people like \[this\]([https://youtu.be/NvNyWGjDwBM](https://youtu.be/NvNyWGjDwBM)) who just print isk in fucking supers, and he gets saved too because he could just press a button
---
You could do this with a 3rd party tool via ESI.
---
Now that's what I call salt.
---
Because people will whine if they can't reasonably run their 12 rorquals at a time.
---
I didn't actually read the article but does it mean there are just more spawns or are anomalies more likely to be wormholes?
---
Apologies, you are right. Its ridiculous how many middle ground posts are popping up by people who shouted down anyone who suggested a middle ground during the blackout. Even now with it going back to full local you still see the anti blackout group supporting a middle ground but the majority of pro blackout players were out right hostile to those ideas.
---
I am extremely anti blackout but I do 100% agree that full local is also not correct. I hope ccp finds something but my faith in them is low.
---
Sure, I think he spends most of his time talking about how player action is a product of game mechanics. But he points out simply that at least in the early stages it was a specific type of player that was attracted to this kind of play style, and their advocation for that play style brought us to the pre blackout situation.
---
A lot of channels that manage that have admins that ban confirmed scammers, IIRC.
---
Ohh well fun while it lasted thank you for at least giving it a go CCP.
---
You can actually still login for free as an Alpha account.
---
I've been playing for 14 years do I guess I will have more npc kills, but in the entire time you have been playing I remember running 1 anomaly and didn't enjoy it so I never did more. Don't assume everyone who opposed the blackout is a krab or a bot.
---
As for his explanation, it's full of shit. Nullsec has not been getting buffed for years. The mistake was going to an extreme and that drove players away. The idea to change how local works is wider ly supported but it can't be that drastic.
---
Inflation was within limits. You can check that yourself on the MER. PCU ye was going down but we actually got a large injection from Serenity. Not disagreeing with you tho, but changes done with the bile that these last ones wont get support. CCP lost massive amounts of goodwill because they decided to fk with just one part of the game and their comments were honestly truly shitty.
---
This was simply not proper changes and it wasnt done with good intention imo. It was punitive. CCP shouldnt have opinions on whose playstyles are good or bad. They should just objectively balance.
---
Easier citadel fix, learn to Overview.
---
Agree 90% of ships added to eve should be subcapital. Next year if only one capital came out and a bunch of subs, one would hope the single cap would be a triglavian dreadnought. Would train/inject for this.
---
That would involve downloading it.
---
&gt; So just because you're going to lose more isk then you make, it makes you a bitch?
---
With a single alt watching a gate I was able to rat for hours in a carrier (nid) uninterupted. I've  not lost it.  I'm a big fan of proving all you retards wrong. Across the entire blackout I e made around 7 bil. That doesnt count the money that alt made *before* the blackout. 
---
So this whole "you'll lose more than you make" line is utter garbage.  Contrived bullshit from people who'd rather cry than actually put in the slightest bit of effort and try to operate under these conditions.
---
It reinforces the idea that you and people like you refuse to operate unless your safety is 100% guaranteed
---
They just increased the rate of wandering whs. This doesn't effect datas and relics
---
Awww another wormholer crying about null sec
---
Bout tree fiddy
---
I explained atleast one factor after. But hey listen if you dont wanna think about it yourself then thats fine. 
---
You lost what 30% PCU in 2 months. Thats a mass exodus. You lost 50% over 3 years. If you cant see that one number is bigger than the other then I cant help you.
---
Why do you need an exodus at all? Why is everything black and white?
---
So next nerf WH billions/  hour income?  That would hurt the wormholer crabs and bring some balance.
---
&gt; Despite hindering my own income, 
---
ratting on yourself didn't really add to the post. Sure it answers the question of why multi, but I don't think anyone would question, the premise being CCP fixed an exploit.
---
The thing your missing, is this has nothing to do with blackout. Blackout was a cheap attempt to paper over years of failing to actually develop enticing content people want to engage with. But so many players lapped it up as a jesus moment.   
---
Those players didn't leave because Eve changed, they left because they did the things eve has to offer and eventually the social bonds weren't enough to keep them invested.  They aren't going to return. Anything that doesn't deliver a steady stream of new PvP focused players shouldn't be viewed as a positive by anyone who wants PvP or Eve itself to continue in a positive direction. Citadels and nullblocks aren't the problem, they only expose it.   
---
Eve is lacking direction as a game because the devs have wasted years of good faith that could have been used to develop a vision for something... instead we're getting zero cost flip switches that play well to bittervets who apparently don't actually want to subscribe anyway.
---
-Citadels
---
-Higher spawnrate/numbers of sites per system (Delve supports the entire Imperium)
---
-Ansiblex gates
---
-Supercap umbrella due to rorq proliferation/skill injectors
---
Just to name a few buffs.
---
Luvin it
---
Ok sweet tnx
---
Make it so if you are in a covops ship of any type you don't show up in local. That would help to maintain the risk.
---
SLA printing is beautiful. Xometry is decently priced, provided that you don't go crazy with the size.
---
You didn't explain any factors. Your next sentence is literally " There is a reason why no local works in WHs but not in a place where you can light cynos or places that see a lot of traffic on a regular basis."  
---
30% which were bots and multiboxing krab accounts.  
---
We don't need any exodus but we need features that encourage conflict and war...not farmsville.
---
can you imagine the autistic screeching on reddit that would ensue?
---
there's not much else to do, we're at extreme measures because devs don't want to balance the game because they're lazy just as the playerbase when it comes to pve so.. here we are. I mean, take FW, it could be so much more engaging and risky if, for example, in large plexes there were obstacles you could hit with your ship ruining your optimal range or breaking your point/scram range. But noooooooooooooo, people would need to actually pilot the ship a bit, are you mad? and that's literally a 2 cents coin thrown out of a million good ideas wasted in the last decade trying to suggest ccp what to do...... the devs release 2, max 3 changes every 6 months, not much else to say. Either they start working, and complete their projects (tiercide anybody? where are you?) or the game will eventually die, very slowly, very, very, very slowly
---
I think there were some statistics that 90% of players who tried Captains Quarters disabled the feature after the first try. 
---
It did give us cool avatars and nice character creator though.
---
2 months of black out and it must mean nobody liked it because 15 krab account rorqual guy rage unsubbed because he can't krab in absolute safety. This is the basis you are using to judge this.  
---
Vague "lacking a direction" whatever that means. Eve has always been about the players making the "direction." We make the wars, we make the conflict. But there are too many stagnating safety net factors that suffocate that before it even gets a chance to develop. Blackout was one way to undo some of that. Not a solution but a start.
---
Noooooooooooo
---
If it had worked well they wouldnt have removed it right?
---
Yea, cause your playstyle is bitching on a forum
---
I thought this too lol am I missing something where the actual shit talk happened?
---
For someone touting facts I see a startling lack of data ....
---
But at the same time it would work as an early detection system of neuts entering your region.
---
Greetings friends, enemies, and those who are undecided. I present to you all my latest creation featuring footage driven by CCP's Blackout Era. I hope you all enjoy the content I captured in addition to the music. Thanks for the support! -Jack

I came back because blackout and cyno changes promised to shake things up and move the balance toward risk. I hope CCP has a plan.
---
Yeah
---
Nah, living in the supposedly most hardcore part of the game and being unable to adapt to adversity is.
---
I'm not directly affected in the slightest. But the game on the whole is, which affects everyone indirectly.
---
Still, in a few more years of this, when minerals and pve loot have tanked to half the price, while plex has doubled in price (effectively quadrupling the amount of grinding you have to do to plex or fund your umbrellas), i won't be the one who'll be sad. Not one bit.
---
My income streams are purely based on being a middleman, so i don't care what the price is, as long as there's a healthy margin somewhere in there. If faction warp scramblers are 50 million a pop i'm selling fewer but making making more isk per item. If they become 5 million a pop i'll be making much less per item, but everyone will be fitting one so i'll be selling much more. As far as my personal playstyle is concerned, i'm in the enjoyable position to be able to give zero fucks whatsoever about the value (or lack thereof) of nullsec products.
---
hi enjoy!   
---
Kiting is easy o7
---
Ah ye something like that might work. Im good with trial and error in that context.
---
&gt;  nothings stopping you from going through wh's to find content.
---
Would have been like 4 hours instead of 2 if we didn't use a WH shortcut. Null didn't produce any good kills or fights at 02:00 in that region on that day.  
---
Yes, you can find kills daily in null by simply going near newbie areas (e.g. BRAVE, PH, Karma). But roams outside newbie regions, it's kinda dead out there without local making them feel safe.
---
"no local bad because wormholes! y  u no understand dis!"

---
You mean the ones people like you have been spamming for over a decade before that? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I hate ratting and PvE in every MMORPG I’ve ever played, and so EvE’s PLEX system suits me fine. Like you, I have the disposable income to support my PvP via buying PLEX regularly and selling it on - plus my subscription. 
---
For many players with limited time, it’s a good solution.
---
&gt; Hope you have a plan CCP. 
---
They clearly don't as they're cancelling the ones they made
---
At least a delayed local or immediate anonymous local would be nice.
---
What a sorry excuse for a change
---
So even more safety to crabbers than post BO. Basically an automated Intel channel
---
&gt;but none of this matters with the PCU dropping at its current rate
---
I disagree.  The PCU dropping sucks, but I really don't think eve will die until there is a game that can replace it.  Then you're right, none of this will matter.  But until then.
---
&gt;old tracking titans were an absolute joke compared to current supercapitals
---
Sure, but I do remember hearing/reading a lot of similarly worded complaints from the players and similar "design philosophy" spouted by CCP when doing their balance pass.  And then haw titans came, and we got to hear the same stuff all over again.
---
&gt;Mate you'd have to be an absolute space hopper to think there's any comparison between Trig ships and the meta dominating power of Ishtars during their peak and T3s from basically 2011-2017
---
Not on the bloc level, but look at the zkill usage of these ships (especially compared with other ships in their groups).  And it's not surprising when you look at their capabilities.  They're the superior ship in most cases.  Maybe their place in the broken meta is more similar to the svipul, but either way, they're broken af on a small to mid size gang level, and remain without a even a start of a balance pass.
---
&gt;The problems are all fixable with consistent iteration which the playerbase has been telling CCP for 15 years straight
---
Yeah, I know what I posted isn't novel.  But CCP seemingly listening to those who are the loudest is why I'm posting it.
---
Would make faction war bot farming even worse, if that’s possible.
---
People dont fight in C6 space, only farm alts live there. That is why the data is so skewed.
---
It's a fruitless hope. But a hope none-the-less.
---
It was a nightmare to do pve it needed balance. I didn't mind blackout but the fact hunters could find me easily while i can't find them until they log into system and decloak their loki next to me was a problem.
---
Guess he exaggerated a bit on that side. However i think rigged supers are around 8b in delve.
---
Do you mean spending real money on sub fees or using ISK to buy PLEX to re-sub?
---
Right, so the logic goes that space where people only crab and never fight (even more so than Delve) should be changed.
---
Being able to make a space living without having to assimilate into a nullbloc and understanding basic supply and demand is non-constructive criticism now. Got it.
---
Or maybe it's just a guy explaining how he plays the game and is more qualified to talk about his personal playstyle than, well, anybody else.
---
I've said it before somewhere else, you guys are less than half of the game, don't expect everyone to toe the party line. There will be different opinions and perspectives. If all you want to hear is the approved narrative, stay in your internal alliance forums.
---
Damn. I don't live in delve but the cheapest super I've seen is 12bil, and I can't remember if it was rigged. 
---
I want a hel one day, but I can't afford it yet.
---
I dont disagree but I mean if there is no real change from the current then people wont do it. And 5 minutes is much like the present one since you can die many times over. Imo 15-30 or gatecloak being manually broken. Thats enough to scout in small systems. Im not even a good hunter but I most def find you in that time.
---
Hey its a shitty thing. Thats true afk and imo one of the worst things in Eve.
---
Lol...delicious.
---
Even if a Loki decloaks next to you it takes like 7-10 seconds before it can even lock you. Not enough time to align? Can't fight back? Can't light your own cyno? Can't stay aligned to warp off right away? What was the nightmare? What needed balance?
---
Screwing around in an astero is a better way to play imo.
---
Real money... i have truly never plexed an account
---
Thing you dont understand here and why I wont engage further with you is that our side "won". I dont need to argue with your immature and toxic ass. I dont need to do what you guys did "adapt or die". Im trying to reach a consensus that everyone can agree 2 because I belive the game will gain the most by that approach.
---
You just wanna be a cunt. And thats how you gonna be treated.
---
Players just didn't understand that it was actually needed change. It lowered plex value ALOT. Year from now you would have made shitloads more isk from ratting &amp; pve. It would have been harder to do safely but if you were able to do it you would have made more isk.
---
Now it's back to inflation mode. Isk will lose it's value. Plex prices will rise. Bots will be back. You earn less isk from pve. Enjoy.
---
You consented to be able to be killed, not be a sitting duck for random psycopaths.
---
That's the difference.
---
in a previous post someone mentioned the idea of an "upwell observatory" i think it would be another use for the Entosis modules. You have an obervatory in the constellation, then awesome you get local but if someone entosis's it then it goes to black out and you can remove that intel from your targets arsenal. sure you know where the ship hacking your observatory is but everyone else gets that time its down to make the moves they need to make without someone yelling in intel "local spike!"
---
Yeah thats actually something i noticed while hunting: even small renter corps seem to have adapted better way faster than huge blocs. They have active and quick defense fleets with pvp ships ready if their subcap ratters get attacked. Lost a bunch of strats that way. They also renamed all their ships with a certain symbol to distingush between neutral and corpmate. 
---
I have seen nothing similar in blocs like test or goons. It rather seems like their solution to the blackout is to only go rat/mine in capitals/ supers.
---
Imagine a world where you NEED Local to stave off the "psychological perception of emptiness" when you undoubtedly have 47 different comms tabs open for various Corp/Alliance/SIG/Social/etc. channels...
---
It's a disingenuous af argument, and I suspect the people making it know that.
---
we have lack of offensive and surprise things how to penetrate areas under umbrella...  
---
as well there is nothing to raid, there is only killmail reward during raiding null sec...
---
Local only on even numbered hours.
---
You claim your side won, you want to name call, you want to accuse others if things that started with you. "adapt or die" was a krab thing to say.  
---
You make bad points. Don't be mad at me because of that.
---
7-10 second lock? Are you high? You can't stay aligned in a mining ship so you're looking at atleast 5 seconds before warp at best. Fight the loki? Yea you try fighting autocannon/HAM lokis in a barge and let me know how that goes for you. This is also assuming he's alone which is rare.
---
Why not both?
---
You poor thing. Cry me a river.
---
At this point I will take the death option.   Have fun in mining simulator guys.
---
Goon/TEST solution is to have their CSM representatives cry in the ear of CCP. Or if you go read the Imperium News Network you read quotes/headlines like "Fuck small gang pvp" and "Eve is not a PvP game it's an economics game!"
---
We make the wars because there are reasons to make war. There are few reasons now. CCP creates the game to be played, sure we break it for our entertainment, but that's part of the entertainment.   
---
Without any goal to achieve or even interesting mechanics to break... it's just stagnation. Delve without the goons is a wasteland, same for every area without the null block. If other areas of space interested those players, they'd be there instead. Diminishing null sec doesn't raise up other areas, it just makes another part of the game shitty.  
---
Blackout was a cheap trick to try and cash in some nostalgia returns that didn't materialize. I'm judging it by the blatant lying about the metrics during the login events that Hilmar was so proud of after blackout hit. I'm judging it because it took zero development effort and was basically ripped off reddit and just shoved in because they literally have no clue what they want to do now.
---
Anything aside from a bomber has a lock delay. Why can't you stay aligned mining? You can't fight a lone Loki with your team of miners? Better yet why do you expect just your mining ship should defeat a combat fit T3 Cruiser?
---
Fuck you I prefer using my Large C5-L Emergency Shield Overload I! You're just bad because you don't know the difference between them and Large Neutron Saturation Injector I.
---
&gt;Yes, you can find kills daily in null by simply going near newbie areas  
---
I hope you're not implying we've been a regular guest in the top 10 corps on zkill in the past weeks (not in the last hours because for some reason theres total chaos left and right today for some godforsaken reason, i havent been on all day so idk) with a corp that went from about 1 to over 150 members in 2 months by killing some newbros.   
---
And that theres inactive regions sadly has been the case already before the blackout, the lack of local just make them seem even more dead now because you can't see the 2 random guys that are docked somewhere in a citadel. Yes blackout had some effect, but what you're doing right now is trying to account the stagnation of several years to it.
---
The payouts are the same and now they can't easily cyno in back up.
---
They can't be the silent majority if they are making noise.
---
When are they going to give us back our blue lights on high power??!!
---
It's a trap, stainguy is going to absorb the high-salinity complaints; the hatred bukkake will only empower him. You don't want to fight the shit-covered smug monster he'll evolve into. There is no victory to be found in this thread.
---
" **Constellation based local** " This would be awesome, now you don't even need to have someone in every system for perfect intel, just one in every constellation, and if you're krabbing at one end and someone enters from the other end 3 jumps away you would know and have time to safe up even sooner.
---
Delve without Goons...well before Goons showed up Delve was a mixmatch of smaller alliances that fought each other. Tribute without NCdot and the near north null areas have developed into that as well. So you're wrong about that.  
---
Stagnation is happening because of features that make krabbing/null too safe. Simple as that. And we've lost our PvP numbers and have filled the playerbase with krabs who will quit unless the game is 95 percent safe.
---
No, maybe the hunters just need to adapt to the game having local and try a little harder.
---
It can trash any ship so trashing a capsule would just be splat and then it's gone.
---
Aye, hence the -  *(Obviously the silent majority started speaking up later on.)*
---
Cool. Let's do regional local then. NOW YOU ONLY NEED ONE GUY PER REGION!
---
That doesn't sound like tapi tbh
---
the payouts are the same for now, but CCP has previously indicated they intend to increase the payouts
---
You not knowing the memes and trying to good post is making you look like an idiot.
---
just an FYI
---
Drop rates aside, most spam citadels won't have any loot in them. There won't be any added incentive since they're all going to have empty drops - maybe some indy ships and random liquid ozone.
---
This idea only works for wormholes and staging citadels, and the latter can be evacuated...
---
PLEX can be dropped in value by SP. CCP can do that themselves. 
---
But my man, we didnt have inflation.  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d\_economy.indices.short.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3l9YfZbZQQlH21nt3TkWYM/f1446563554d6d532f2467372fb0a7db/9d_economy.indices.short.png). This is from CCP and its in the MER. Not my numbers, CCPs own. Look at the CPI. You can check the MER faucets as well. There is no real correlation.
---
There is a "maybe" correlation but its not real. I promise if you compare these periods with the PCU you will see that its demand based and not because people farmed more. Rather there were more players which means more demand so prices go up and these people farmed hence the faucet increase. The rest of the year we are seeing inflation due to 2 wars, one very long that started around march/april. You also had several thousand coming over from Serenity in May/June I belive which yet again is raising the demand for products and thus prices.
---
None of this means we had any real inflation. Lifeblood gave us inflation and you can see that on the chart. T2 stuff got more expensive because a lot of moongo is never mined in comparison to before when it was passive. But since then we have had stable numbers outside of wars.
---
This means your purchasing power has remained the same. But PLEX (which is complicated all around) has gone up. This CCP can fix, they can give more SP and they can do more PLEX sales. 
---
You with me? The numbers simply dont back up your theory. But mineral supply is way over the top. Rorqs should have been changed years ago.
---
Blackout wouldn't have stopped that either though.
---
Keep telling yourself that, I'm sure it'll comfort you when the shutdown letter arrives in your email.
---
Probably, but theres a tiny limit on standing slots, and we dont want to set every NPC corp KOS for the actions of some cyno alts.
---
No bots in goons. We have a spread sheet to show that
---
The numbers in that fight were pretty even for a change and look what happens. Honestly i felt like legacy barely tried to help it was mostly AOM and due to lack of support were forced to drop a fair amount of dreads/fax.

Thx for reminding it was funny.
---
&gt;what you're doing right now is trying to account the stagnation of several years to it.
---
No, not years, just seeing drop after July that's not sustainable. 
---
If I'm wrong CCP wouldn't turn it off as ultimately a sustainable change would mean it's healthy for them. I will accept I'm wrong if they keep it off forever, but alas, they announced I was right about it today. Blackout removed null population and the only ones left are in big alliances or coalitions, and even in those big areas, there's big reductions in actives.
---
True, but you could make it cheap enough that it only really affects cloaky campers.
---
Very accurate post. It might be a self-correcting problem though, but with a long and painful path to crawl through that the game may not be able to recover from.
---
CCP will cave in to the pressure, null will keep screwing up their own playstyle by creating an oversupply of their products and not destroying enough by not going to war, mineral and loot prices will tank even more, plex price will climb. 
---
The only people who will keep turning steady profits (and exploiting small ups and downs for even more) will be the guys in the trading and hauling business, because they are middlemen and don't rely on introducing assets into the game for their isk.
---
Also as a result of this, everyone who is contributing to this problem will have to do multiple times the grind they are doing today to maintain the same level of buying power. Replacing a ratting super may take 3x the time with the exact same mechanics in place as we have now. Making the same amount of wealth (adjusted for inflation) may take 10 multiboxing rorqs instead of 5. And so on. Maybe then they'll realize why it was important for people to be able to kill them occasionally and disrupt things a little. Then they can either quit because even with increased safety and their favorite mechanics in place, their preferred income stream has been rendered completely useless by their own selves, or take up another playstyle that is injecting less isk and materials into the game and stop being a part of the vicious cycle.
---
The only problem in all of this? God held newbros having to do some pve to kickstart their eve career.
---
These are the guys who will be chewed up and spit out the worst, because everything they have initially available to them will have been devalued to the n-th degree by an army of multiboxing alts doing easily scalable activities. So their only option becomes to either join the people creating the problem (and contribute to it themselves), or burn out and quit the game.
---
Probably not a very safe bet on your part.
---
Or god forbid ccp not put tools in our hands. Black out would have been fine if they introduced structures that could bring local. You would really have the feel of player empires as you move into their space and see actual infrastructure and abandoned places would be spooky. The more could be structures that are cheaper for regional chat and more expensive ones for system local
---
So you spend real money only to acquire fake money?
---
They aren't, good hunters were killing stuff before blackout they will kill people after as well.
---
Its 8, not 4.
---
The same way entire jackdaw fleets get bombed by stukas.
---
Yeah that's the thing there needs to be a balance between risk and reward but that has been out of balance for along time and with Blackout just flipped it. If my PVE ship costs 100mil isk to buy but it takes me 3 hours of pure PVE to pay for it if it dies in 2 hours then the next one needs to PVE for 4 hours and just gets worse and worse. If you want ships out in space there has to be the ability to make more isk then your ship is worth before it gets destroyed but that number has to be higher then what you can make it High-sec or else again why bother. It's a tricky thing that I don't even think CCP can fix at this point.
---
\+1
---
Your aren't making sense.
---
Sounds to me like you're just shit at time management and making isk.
---
And thus is why blackout is ending. It's sad
---
Yeah they should, I hope ccp have ideas and release them quickly.
---
they moved to other groups or places, they didn't just magically leave like so many claim.
---
Im terrible at krabbing
---
I'm not telling myself that. Anyone who knows what they are talking about will tell you that. Although it's wasted on spodbrain riddled chimps like you.
---
I had zero issue killing miners prior to black out in a stealth bomber, if anything blackout made it harder because to compensate for no local people started parking carriers and faxes in the belts making it damn near impossible to kill even a barge solo before reps landed.
---
So basically you have 6 seconds to react to a Loki uncloaking and locking you, where as the Loki as unlimited time to wait for the right moment and setup the gank. It was so one sided.
---
Hilmar only has two speeds, warp speed and reverse. It's part of why him taking control of the game is so terrifying every time he does it. The guy has no clue, he is not familiar with the entirety of the game and doesn't realize it.
---
No they didn't, they quit the game quietly, that's the point. r/Eve is a fraction of the player base and the opposite of silent.
---
No they haven't, they said they would look at them if they needed to, to balance them with any new risk.
---
It just changed hands since it dropped.
---
Man you really have no clue. Thats like me saying why dont you use your rorqual alts to fight. C6 owners use alts to make isk. Most of their mains live in a c5 and fight every day. C6's give the same isk/hr as C5's all else being equal, there is just a slight anom respawn rate increase
---
imagine it for one second.... then apply it to the region with jita. Now understand you suggestion in both cases is cancer.
---
No they said they ARE (not would, meaning they are actively doing it) looking into because the isk flow has gone negative and needs adjusting.
---
But CCP is forcing us to look at his stupid face every time we boot up the launcher
---
I'll tell you the same as i told other people. It's highly unlikely that the drop will be reversed. Todays announcement has crushed a glimmer of hope for a lot of people and not few of them will propably quit and not all of the ones that left will come back. CCP decided to take the worst possible way out of that horrible implementation of blackout. And yes, admittedly how they introduced it was absolutely stupid, but the intention was right. It's just too late, as Seraph already explained in the post he made. 
---
And how that one goon guy pointed out somewhere in here theres little trust in CCP left on all sides now. They're propably gonna try to put the game back on it's old path except they will have less players and even higher stagnation rate.  
---
I think Jestertrek might have to reverse his 5 years life expectation for the game.
---
Are subfolders for bookmarks a thing?  Or will you have to apply an ACL to every folder?
---
I wish there was a direct line to CCP that was player elected... but represented more than just the majorities. Gotta have those small groups. Think of microbiology that we as humans couldn’t live without. They’re not rly thought of a lot but if they weren’t there we would die. Smaller groups provide content to the game too and help the big null blocs kind of exist. CCP needs to balance the climate for both groups. We are not ever going to agree on blackout yes or no. We need to be forced into a middle ground that is half of what we both want.
---
Why would people who unsubbed over "Chaos" come back because a single part of chaos was rolled back? Until hilmar gives up this stupid notion that the game should randomly change just to fuck with people he won't be getting my money back. Change is good, unless its random, haphazard, uncoordinated change for the sole purpose of making playing the game a pain in the ass.
---
There have been some truly terrible ideas to effect change in WHs but this takes the cake. This is probably the worst idea I have seen.
---
Nah we'd just do it for null. What's the matter bro? You were talking so much good shit just a sec ago. Don't want regional local for nullsec? But you'd only need 1 character to watch the whole region.
---
&gt;You with me? The numbers simply dont back up your theory. But mineral supply is way over the top. 
---
&gt;But PLEX (which is complicated all around) has gone up. 
---
So mineral supply has gone up and plex prices have gone up. And they will continue doing that now when rorquals can use excavators again.
---
&gt;This CCP can fix, they can give more SP and they can do more PLEX sales.
---
Giving more SP to players is just fuel to the fire. Guess if that is used to create even more rorqual alts? And train more bots. Enjoy.
---
Even if we had that Hilmar would just ignore them and tell the devs to do the same, you can't give feedback to a company that doesn't want to listen to it.
---
10 days-ish in incursions. Or barely 2 days in a rorqual. Both single accounts.
---
I miss the nano drake of old with HMLs...
---
So I have a few issues with what youre writing. You found content easier. I can bet you that you can still find content. Nothing was stopping you before. If you all go to one of the places that have newly been inhabited you will run into each other.
---
I can agree to less bots in NS being a good thing. But that doesnt mean there were less bots in the game. I belive it was actually the opposite. PLEX prices falling is always a good thing but CCP can do that by giving out SP and by PLEX sales. Higher PLEX prices also means that the person who buy PLEX from CCP gets more out of it. Its a very delicate thing.
---
Which is why I dont like a complete removal of the blackout. I want a version where you dont show up for 15-30 sec or when you break gate cloak. Thats enough time to scan down ships in smaller systems. Bots cant react that fast and if a player is on the ball they will get away. If not then I mean its fair game. 
---
We didnt have an increase in destruction due to the blackout, we had the opposite  [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/7yfLoZSDPDrojEKuQr2MSF/fdbd23ecb75629f0edde6dd54bd6a242/0\_produced.vs.destroyed.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/7yfLoZSDPDrojEKuQr2MSF/fdbd23ecb75629f0edde6dd54bd6a242/0_produced.vs.destroyed.png). If werent for the southern war I can promise you that the destruction values would have tanked. Less players in the game means less destruction. The production aspect, Hm its been falling for quite some time, well before the BO kicked in. I dont really know if it will pickup in any real sense.
---
Which was pretty much what the ree was about. It was massively heavy handed and it became punitive. And now weve lost 2 months because of this and CCP has lost tons of goodwill. I doubt NS will agree to a delayed local any time soon simply because you need goodwill to implement changes, of which CCP currently has low amounts of. Which is sad cause we need good changes.
---
I feel like you almost got it, but missed the point at the most important part...
---
EVE has been a PvE Haven (heh) for a few years now. Rather than players feeling "entitled" to safety, I think many are just used to it. There doesn't need to be this malicious element to it.
---
Blackout changed things, yes. However, rather than "putting PvE bots in place" and HTFU, you just took the game a few thousand people were enjoying and radically changed it without any particular reason or warning (from their perspective). It's no wonder many people can't be bothered.
---
If CCP would fix things regularly and gradually vs "YOLO Chaos Era" types of patches, you wouldn't get mass alienation of players...
---
Tricked me. I just bought my Loki....XD
---
Same could be said to the thousands of people that unsubbed because they couldn't krab without local. Why didn't they "just adapt"?
---
"They are looking into it" doesn't mean we are increasing payouts especially considering they just made another changed to lower the risk of ratting.
---
Use your brain gosh.
---
You forgot say no support fighters aka Siren/Dromi with 3 bomber squads 😉
---
if you were sansha, would you invade jita with the mass force of capsuleers, concord, and cal navy there?  its suicide.
---
now...rens on the otherhand........
---
The ups and downs of emotion man
---
Yeah and the topend ships have *way* worse risk/reward metrics than low-end ones. Rorqs and supers need to work for, what, 30 hours? 40? More? to pay for themselves. VNIs needed like two hours. 
---
WH PvE offers some ideas in terms of increased risk, increased reward, as a viable content driver. If you could, for example, rat for 300m/hr in a 100mil cruiser, it wouldn't be a big deal if you died on a regular basis. FW plexes have an element of this, they just suck too much on so many other levels, but a major overhaul could offer some options here.
---
Good post. Yeah they are used to it. A gradual shift would have been better.
---
This isn't about hunters being able to kill stuff, this is about how this paints CCP and the future of the game and whether or not people want to put up with it. Them going back on a change that many saw as an attempt to combat the age of stagnation like that is making a lot of people lose faith.
---
&gt; They also renamed all their ships with a certain symbol to distingush between neutral and corpmate. 
---
Old womhole tactic. Also, once you manage to copy it, and use it in your shipman's, it gives you a little more cover in a system without local
---
Literally anything that bypasses the character select screen is unaffected.

when you look at his pilot info on zkill, what he likes to fly. his corp etc that sounds like near perfect intel to me
---
Most def.
---
This fit works, thank you for sharing!  What do you think of using a t2 ammo instead?
---
&gt;   It's highly unlikely that the drop will be reversed. 
---
Yeah, two sides to it. 
---
* There's normal EVE churn, which is normal, I think we can agree there's been a slow progression downwards with the exception of Chinese influx. There was a good article on the main cause of this: people have families, people are getting old. 
---
* Then there's the PVE/carebear drop during Black Out -- that is coming back. Maybe not 100%, but I see people coming back again and waiting for Monday to resub. In some cases, some are resubbing alts and they only kept up their mains to keep up their corp. I'm using alliance data here, but still an adequate sample size.
---
They need to reverse the negative trend in isk generation, which given how many PVErs just bailed is not going to be corrected just by having the remaining ones start ratting again, they will need to adjust somethings up to compensate.
---
But that would be stupid lmao
---
tell me where you rat please, you must be in the back end of no where.
---
Blackout was an experiment they said that from day one. At no point was it a here to stay. CCP saw it wasn't having the effect they were hoping for so they ended it.
---
So your proposition is what? That new players dont play the game? Because thats what youre saying. NS has been keeping retention rates up cause nobody else has. Its easy to cast blame but atleast admit the truth.
---
If retention rates get fixed then by all means make it harder for new players in NS.
---
That pvp-fits-doing-pve was the basis behind (C4+) Sleepers, **Incursions**, Burner missions, but fizzled with instanced Abyss.
---
Many more incursion-style sites, distributed over low &amp; moreso null rather than a few safe ones in highsec, could have solved all this. Roaming ~15-30man fleets able to get isk or kills from 1 setup and not needing hours to get said content was the best next pivot.
---
There are tons of posts that try to help the little guy. Most of which are trying to help them from being overfarmed by guess which ones?
---
It should be. Just not tedious.
---
The salt is real with this one. Go back to WOW.
---
amen dude.
---
&gt;  I'm not ratting nor mining anymore.
---
&gt;That's a simple fact that it is too dangerous
---
As I said, I've lost two ships and kept on mining. I think that's acceptable in terms of risk. If you quit PVE because you THINK it's too dangerous, then you never gave the change a chance.
---
No, it wouldn't have, but instant local makes it virtually impossible to catch anyone except rorqs and week-old newbies that don't know how to align.
---
WTB TDSIN comms when Exo is going down. "Wtf just happened" would spring to mind.
---
scam
---
Get out of here with your narrative ruining logic. He’s trying to spin man, leave him be.
---
Straight up. And only 1 timer on smaller citas and 2 on forts and maybe even KS. It shouldnt burn people out to kill cheaper stuff than their own ships.
---
And the several supers that were dieing every single day.
---
so was the version of blackout they decided to go with... but that sure didn't stop them from tanking the server pop for two months though did it?
---
How much are you making in a rorq these days? I've not used one but I bought a cheap one to sell.
---
Need to own system for more than 30 days to have local
---
If you cyno jam a system you also lose local
---
Ah so you ASSume memorizing said 300 page manual WASN'T fun?
---
You just proved my point. 
---
For one thing we actually liked to read and not just stare a screens or "learn" from videos.
---
By the way, I had immense fun, particularly flying and fighting planes modeled as close as possible to the real thing without being classified.
---
My crowning achievement was toss bombing an 2000 lb UNGUIDED bomb through the commander's turret hatch on an Iraqi T-72 whilst flying nap of the earth prior to the toss at about 500 knots 50 feet AGL.
---
Bet you don't know what half of that means without looking it up do you?
---
Fun Fun Fun!
---
If I tell you where I rat I wont be able to keep ratting. It's actually not too bad as far as depth in 0.0 goes, could be worse, I could be in some shit hole like Omist or Paragon, but again, I tend to look for challenges, otherwise why play a game?
---
Only ansibelex are from the past 3 years. Also nullsec was opposed to basically all those things.
---
I can't tell if you are just trolling or are really dumb
---
I mean, you have to be a complete idiot to die in a ratting super. They can't even be tackled by rats, so just staying aligned to a citadel is virtually 100% safe. You shouldn't have to count on people being brain-dead to get kills.
---
While I agree that there are a shit ton of people that just krab all day every day, I would also like to point out that some of the most active/elite pvpers i know are some of the filthiest crabs in the game that just want that komodo/vanquisher/whatever the fuck to distinguish themselves. In fact, I don't think I know a single pvper who doesn't also qualify as a filthy krab in this day and age.
---
Yes for the love of god. I dont know why balance is so frowned upon, if everyone becomes somewhat happy or atleast equally unhappy then you have yourself a decent balanced change.
---
We blew up the wreck immediately.
---
wormholers don't rat in 100 mil cruisers or they don't make 300 mil an hour. Wormholers are some of the most risk averse crabs i have seen since they can control who gets to enter their hole or whatever hole they find while they crab.
---
Should be better but i havent skilled it yet, thats why i use t1 ammo and faction weapon
---
I can't tell if you haven't been keeping track of CCP's actions for the last two months, or if you just random post words you threw together without thinking.
---
At some point i was wondering why they did not take a page out of submarine warfare and basic sensor use in all fields of warfare (similar stuff applies to air combat as well) as it is in real life, since some similarities are already there?
---
A submarine is "cloaked" unless it makes noise by going fast or attacking (pushing torpedoes out of a metal tube with compressed air makes a lot of noise). Similarly, a cloaker is undetectable but can't go fast (we can't keep prop mods running under cloak), but has to become visible (break cloak) to initiate an attack.
---
Now, you can detect a submarine or a surface ship by passive means (listening in for noise, which is currently quite hard against subs because of how quiet they are when going slow), or by active sensors (sonar pings). But the moment you go active, everyone else in the vicinity knows you're there and in which direction you are (but not the exact distance yet). They can also roughly tell what kind of ship or sensor is pinging them. So, going active is risky for both hunter and prey. If the prey is within the scan cone, the hunter gets a quick firing solution. But if the prey is not within the scan cone, the hunter gets nothing (only echo from the environment) while the prey gets a heads-up they're being hunted and a direction to the hunter (you can actually plot firing solutions in real life simply by tracking an enemy's pinging, without emitting anything yourself).
---
Also, you have sonobuoys, both active and passive, that are basically scan probes in real life and are used to triangulate enemy positions.
---
So, assuming cloak acts like being submerged being uncloaked acts like being surfaced, we could go with a model of detection based on cloaking and sensor emissions from real life:
---
* Anything under cloak (either from a module or from jumping into a new system) does not appear in local unless the pilot talks in local, then disappears from the local list a few minutes later.
---
* Anything that breaks cloak appears on local, regardless of whether the pilot talked or not.
---
* We get active mode on d-scan and probes. Active d-scan will let you know a cloaker is in system so maybe you can gtfo and safe up if you want. Active mode for probes will work similar to what we already have, but also be able to give you a warp-in within 5-20 km of the cloaker (these numbers will need a lot of tweaking to keep it balanced), so you can attempt to decloak them. The amount of inaccuracy depends on the sig radius of the ship being scanned and the sig/probe strength of the ship doing the active scanning.
---
* Passive mode is just how d-scan and probes currently work.
---
The catch?
---
* Active mode is a highly directional, focused pulse of energy. So, you can't set more than a 60 degree cone to scan. You have to manually scan instead of setting 360 degrees and just mashing the button. Similar for probes (the UI will need to be adjusted to portray this).
---
* To detect a cloaked ship, it must be within your active d-scan cone. To get a warp-in on a cloaked ship, you must drop combat probes, set them to active and triangulate by sweeping with their scan cones. Start from wide cones, then zero in gradually as you get a few results, etc.
---
* For every active ping you send out, everyone in the system gets a pointer/notification in the in-game HUD (and/or map) towards the location of your ship (if you used active d-scan) or the location of the active probe within the scan cone of which you are. You also get notified what it is that's pinging you in a broad sense (eg, frigate/cruiser/battleship/dread/supercarrier/combat probe). You don't get an exact range to the pinger, but if he keeps pinging away, you can warp to 2-3 celestials, triangulate his pings and find exactly which anomaly he's sitting in.
---
In other words, you can't just mash the button and expect to detect every cloaker in system, but you can call a friend over if you decide to hunt them down. And they can do the same to you.
---
thats exactly correct
---
I don't think groups like Skillu are gone because their members were getting old. Mainly because i know for a fact that Skillu decided to collectively quit because they had no place in the Meta anymore since one of their directors is active in one of the few discords im on. And im honestly contemplating to get a hold of them in WoW classic because i am one of those people that lost their last bit of hope in eve. i will wait out monday to see whether CCP maybe decided to bring some nuances into the whole thing but that's it.
---
Isn’t this the big risk and problem with having a game be driven almost exclusively on player created content? 
---
No one is going to go and create content just for the sake of it because no one wants to risk their shiny toys for so little reward. 
---
I feel like this is also connected to the issue of new players and retaining said new players. What content is there that really engages new players as they get a feel for the game? To make them feel like they have a story in the universe and can make something happen. 
---
So much of the game is static right now, I don’t know how you sell to someone new that the best thing to do is join the status quo and krab. It doesn’t seem fun. 
---
Just some rambling thoughts.
---
Opposed or not those things favored krabs.
---
Local isn't perfect intel,to be honest. You don't know what ship a pilot is flying, where they are, whether they're even awake - they could be cloaked and asleep.
---
You shouldn't have to rely on the ratter having no clue you are there until he's tackled to get kills, maybe just need to get better at hunting?
---
How about CCP makes it so you can only log into 1 omega account/ip address, that would certainly be chaos. And also show a semi accurate number of actual players playing EVE lmao
---
&gt; Mining and ratting in blackout are very different beasts.
---
You're right, there. I didn't lose a single ratter in that time and did lose a couple porpoises.
---
I don't rat in carriers (pre or post blackout) so that wasn't going to affect me anyway. but I pay attention when ratting and I haven't lost a single ship. So... in my experience, it's safer than mining to rat in subs.
---
I hope you're right. The game needs to be less safe than it was.
---
If the numbers were even close to equal CCP wouldnt have reverted it. But I do agree that I want more players so CCP should honestly implement delayed local quickly.
---
&gt; post words you threw together without thinking.
---
Haha yikes
---
Hi. I've made 99.9 percent of my ISK through media, theft (against enemies), drug trade and flipping firesale capitals.
---
Easily 69%
---
I feel like at some point the developers have to just take a bigger hand in all this away from players. Heavy community input is certainly good, but I think at some point as a developer you need to simply have a plan and implement your vision. 
---
You can’t trust the player base, especially in a game like this, to be advocating for what is best for the game as a whole, and not what’s best for their little slice of the pie. 
---
Why I think they didn’t go far enough with the age of chaos. Band-aids aren’t the answer when the game might really need a cleansing forest fire.
---
Lol. Spending time making isk in-game is vastly inefficient compared to buying Plex with real world money. Assuming you make more than a few dollars per hour, why would you waste dozens of hours farming in a game when you could get the same thing in a fraction of the time? Krabbing in Eve is literally the worst time management strategy I can think of.
---
I stopped way before blackout tho, I don't need money anymore.
---
I totally understand your feelings on the matter. And you are in no way wrong. But dont lose hope just yet. CCP did a massive thing by admitting it didnt work. And hopefully we will soon see an iteration on the cyno change as well.
---
&gt; can only log into 1 omega account/ip address, that would certainly be chaos. 
---
Money. That would 100% lead to massive subscription loss.
---
&gt;Ah so you ASSume memorizing said 300 page manual WASN'T fun? You just proved my point. 
---
I know what fun is and that isn't it.
---
&gt;Bet you don't know what half of that means without looking it up do you?
---
&gt;Fun Fun Fun!
---
I know what roughly half of it is. And while I have played flight simulators, the situation you're lovingly recalling isn't fun for the vast majority of gamers. Also eve isn't a flight simulator.
---
I don't want to play manuals r us.
---
yeah your posts are pretty terrifying.
---
The most telling was a post from a while ago comparing how Eve advertised the game online.  
---
Years ago it was "Come join Eve and be a spooky space pirate with your friends." And more recently it became "SIGN UP NOW AND GET FREE MINING SHIP TO BLAZE THOSE ROCKS AWAY."
---
Accurate
---
same here - 3 accounts
---
You are just reinforcing the fact that c6 holes are pve havens. No one cares if you go out and fight with your isk printing alts, but don't expect them to be safe.
---
Yes, but the results also show that the game is already way too far down the path it has been put on in the past couple of years. This isn't a rough pvp world anymore, this is a farming sim that is bothered by minor inconvencies when someone blows up your farming tool which has become increasingly less likely and doesn't really matter in ivory castles with ever growing walls. Or at least that's what the playerbase reflects anyway.  
---
Do you think people want to roleplay Don Quixote forever?
---
Are you gaming on a 4K 40" TV or something? Because I can read sod-all of your UI on a 27" 1440p.
---
being a newbro is already trash and it doesn't feel like you really get to play the game until you've spent at least a year of training simply to get fitting skills. Even if you are part of an organization that will bring you along you're often so far outskilled that even flying low end hand out ships is a pain unless they expect noobs and it doesn't feel like you contribute anything to fleet fights that are mostly decided by caps.
---
It's part of why retention is so bad. (especially when people wanting to dip their toe into pvp they get told to go into ls and get nerded on by blinged out pirates or gate guns)
---
Yeah it's a hypothetical "new iskmaking method" where you'd intentionally blend PvE and PvP to make isk in a competitive environment, not in a safe one.
---
Thats why I keep saying fix the Rorq.
---
Then have more PLEX sales, will yield good results as well. 
---
You cant get around the fact that Rorqs need fixing. Like these 2 changes have been about changing everything except what really needs change. Its just a roundabout measure. Attack the problem directly, the Rorq. See what happens and decide on the next change.
---
&gt; Eve's PvE system has always been fundamentally anti-content: PvE ships can't fight, relying on either warpout or backup.
---
MVP comment right there.
---
But this is going to be lost on all the swine around here. I remember CCP nerfing the range of scrams as part of tiericide, I was thinking 'do they realize that it will reduce the amount of fights that will happen in the game, why would you do that??'
---
The fact that you can only commit to combat only at ~7.5 or 20 kms is dumb, it makes everything slippery, but the entire game is built on that...
---
EVE isn't a game you win by fighting right now. Fighting became something for people who fuck up, you either over-escalate on your opponent or you bluebell...
---
4K 60" TV :)
---
What we really need is for you (and other people who post at this shit level) to stop posting.
---
I haven’t played in almost ten years, and you just proved to me why that was a good idea.
---
&gt;I don't think groups like Skillu are gone because their members were getting old.
---
The alliance name / skillu / may have disbanded but quite a few stayed on and played, some went to [Frat](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/99007379/corporations), others went to hit off on their own independently. But that's not the normal churn rate I'm talking about (point 1 from earlier) -- I'm talking about how many vets were teenagers playing spaceship games and now they're adults, have jobs, and kids.
---
I have a job too; often times at work I have to think some shit up and produce something within a day or 2...
---
I like my job. Via work + PLEX I could fund a Titan in a day or two.
---
I don't like mining/ratting/trading/etc and if I did I'd be lucky to make 1/10 what I can at work.
---
Are you fucking stupid, or just that delusional about what it means to grind out imaginary things in an MMO. If you enjoy doing it and feel rewarded, good for you. If not, you're probably fucking stupid.
---
rng baby, everything has a 20% to drop. pray to rnjesus
---
Thats true. But I fear things will get even more risky with all the new possibilities besides "the BM is just leading to some mobile depot named "FU"".
---
&gt; you wouldn't get mass alienation of players...
---
I would argue they've been alienating a large group of players for years by slowly making eve easier and safer. They did this because of about retention even though numbers continued to sink. You have a point by saying you've been alienated somewhat by this change but many people who have been with this game for over a decade have felt alienated for years and large numbers of them had already unsubbed.
---
Eve needs krabs but they also need conflict. things like BHSC, Bob's collapse, gigantic battles used to make the news. Today, we rate a short article on kotuku once in a while. If we don't have the ridiculous scams (heh - player owned banks), the backstabbing, and space nation wrecking losses of ships, we're not only going to lose players through attrition but you won't get as many people interested in this crazy environment.
---
How about local delayed more as system population increases?
---
&gt; On top of that, this is just as valid a way to play as people who like PVP. 
---
Yes, thank you for agreeing with me that you can farm all day long and  someone can kill you, and both are correct.
---
&gt; You're lumping that "krabs" together and [actually dehumanizing them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization) as some kind of dumb, 
---
No, I'm saying wildlife prey and a hunter are equal. The game needs to be balanced for both. We can't just wipe out prey instantly, they must feel safe so the hunter can kill them.   
---
"Sustainable hunting" is the catch phrase -- not de-humanize.
---
Well they didnt stop capital proli right? I think people are putting way too much credit into one thing. The BO created more problems than it solved, simple as that. Do we need other changes for fucking sure and I hope they implement them.
---
But BO was not it.
---
It seems safe until you know that there is only \~110 C6 holes and the chance of someone rolling into you is actually a bit larger compared to \~450 C5s. No body really roll these mainly for the reason that there is rarely anyone to fight with (This is one of the main reason we roll holes, to get connections to other PvP corps to get fights or gank someone doing sites but its mostly the 1st one).
---
How will the names be displayed with the new monument? Will the containers show or will it have like some UI that will auto add the names?
---
There is such a depth of love within the EVE dev community that it just pours out of ever orifice.
---
I want slow-mo, I want sparkling eyes, I want a sentimental song, I want flowers, I want a river flowing through a gorgeous valley, I want cows one sheppey in the distance, I want a warm voice over narrating the true nature of the deeper meaning of affection between EVE devs.
---
And it all ends with a kiss.
---
So why send it to it's death faster? Chaos era isn't over just cause the blackout experiment is over.
---

---
I havent actually watched this stream. However, its possible it can become a deployable or some kind of sov gimmic. So many possible reasons, most likely to keep the economy stable. Both have their downsides though and shame on all pilots who are not wormholers btw.
---
Eh no.
---
As a CEO of one of those little groups living in null I honestly smiled when I saw this news.
---
We got real close to winning eve
---
Well that explains that then xD
---
Stop being so sour.
---
Freighters can easily survive roaming trigs, they don’t point. t1 haulers if they fit shield extenders
---
There is a lack of content across the board. I think the Blackout was an attempt to spark content in null with the hopes it would trickle down. It didn’t work as intended as people just unsubbed and complained. 
---
Risk/reward is out of wack. Viable ways to earn ISK and progress in the game are limited. All things that need to be addressed if the goal is for a more active game that has potential to grow.
---
Good fight
---
You guys should come back. We need you. And CCP did a big thing by reverting it. Some credit is due.
---
If you can back that claim up somehow?
---
Yes but can't you exploit the mechanic and roll your hole, than not scan the new hole to prevent it from spawning on the other side? Also,  you know exactly when a new hole appears if you keep an eye on all the signatures in system. Plus you don't have to worry about gangs teleporting on you via cynos. Explain to me again how this isn't hands down the safest and most risk averse form or krabbing?
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
---
It's cute that you think CCP has ever, ever listened to Goons.
---
What, so this super can't use Dscan?

---
Good talk
---
My work is far more interesting than EVE's isk generation activities. And it pays 100x better. And it feeds my kids.
---
If you enjoy doing it your way, good for you. To me it's a waste of precious time (which happens to be a far more concrete commodity than whatever imaginary prestige you get for watching Netflix long enough to make that supercapital ).
---
That was about 2741 years ago though.
---
Not everyone shares the same idea of what is fun, you know. Who are you to tell them?
---
Wouldnt have worked tho. The change was inherently too flawed for it be mitigated in any real manner. They should however have tried out delayed mode (real delayed) and iterated until people all sides were satisfied.
---
Worm hole space lived by Dscan for a long time, it works fine.  There is risk there yes, but proper choices and attention was enough to keep you alive most of the time.
---
To each his own.

Make the ESS enable local :P
---
The core of skillu left the game (their old guard, ex broski / pizza / etc) and some of their former corps went down in activity drastically.  
---
I know what point you wanted to make, but i wanted to point you at the fact that theres more reasons why not few people quit in the past. Remember Phoebe for example?
---
What did falcon say that you are talking about?
---
You can light a cyno with the enforcer which doesn't need any cruiser skill at V and just Recons I so it's pretty low skill barrier tbh. Just a bit more expensive.
---
If majority of playerbase are drooling f1 krabs, botters and RMTers, nothing can be really done then. CCP could make RMT and bots legal, just so space would be slightly lively and that would help with player count for sure and nullsecers would love it.
---

I wish ccp would just adjust citadels and then otherwise leave null alone. People who want pings for 200-man fleets to bash raitarus can go to null to build empires. To hell with them.

how do you all know they're pve ing there within 30 mins?  I use the ingame map for players in space in last 30 min, but that doesn't differentiate between miners, pve, scanners, etc.

True. Thats why I said I liked the things Valk mentioned AND my details on asset safety.

Easier to kill and sometimes more rewarding to kill both = good.
---
Then you are better than ccp.
---
Krabbing isn't fun; that's basically the issue :(
---
Fundamentally, you have "the reasons we play this game" existing *in direct opposition to how we make money*, and making isk is too important to not do it (especially for sov alliances). 
---
If there was a way you could krab effectively while PvPing at the same time (thus being both "sheep and wolf", or at least decreasing the gap between the two groups) we might fully resolve this. 
---
At the very least, we need to reduce the "all or nothing" risk/reward paradigm, where no amount of risk is acceptable to super ratters/rorq miners. I'd suggest dramatically increasing ROI on krabbing while simultaneously nerfing local (constellation local w/5minute delay would be good), or introducing some kind of hybrid krab/pvp setup like the Abyssal Gauntlet of FW plexes but have it not be terrible.

To quote a friend of mine "some guys bomb runned my battleship failled, then stood in system until i came out again to try and fail again." what counter play do you have to not knowing anything? why should one side have every advantage? eve is a game where you can do what you want. so if youre a pve guy then pve, if you pve in null then you better learn enough pvp to survive. and those null citadels, umbrellas, intel, are PLAYER made, if you live in highsec/lowsec then youre not even one to talk with your local chat, station having, concord response fleet safety net. atleast wormholers have the risk of literally being a loot box if they lose a station. what do high/low sec scrubs lose roaming to null in a 50mil ship hoping to pop a 2.5bill plus ship? cant push them out of there cushy stations, cant take there sov, what do the null cats do? they use PLAYER MAN POWER to push youre shit in and send you back to what ever safetly net you came from. people complain about asset safety. i think its funny, you guys have stations, null loses there whole citadel, then has to pay for 30% of w/e they had if they got it back. nulls always a player made life, player made protection.  you have no say if youre undocking from youre npc station, concord protected space   [https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/XQCZ/F11S8ULD/FLJXQCZF11S8ULD.LARGE.jpg](https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/XQCZ/F11S8ULD/FLJXQCZF11S8ULD.LARGE.jpg)
---
Nullsec has always had some type of asset safety. Yes jspace doesn't but it never did and everyone went into it knowing that. What are you going to do about players that aren't around when you make the change? Just tell them sucks to suck don't come back to eve?
---
For this new generation of EVE players; I'd like to share some EVE history... EVE always had local in null...
---
All the safety net shit about citadels/cynos/capitals EVERYWHERE is a separate problem... maybe focus on those KNOWN issues...
---
This all feels like a new iteration of shit posting that got us Blackout in the first place.
---
Cloaked ships don't show up on scan lmao
---
really dont get it. If so many want to fight how come they dont find each other w/o blackout, but seem to do so in blackout? or are pvpers as risk averse as crabbers?
---
 "Legacy have to move a large number of combat resources back from the frontline to support the struggle in Omist"  
---
Or they can just ignore the distraction WC is attempting by opening a second front and go full speed ahead into their space, nothing makes a defender quit on a counter attack like threatening their staging systems.
---
They did at times and did not at other times.
---
I've been around since 2007 and depending on who was in charge at CCP Goons where either totaly ignored even with good and valid feedback or the ones calling the shots.
---
See, if your guys had been a little less douchy it would have been a lot easier to have sympathy for you.
---
So the MER didn't tank? Or did people find ways to build titans without ore?
---
Don't bother posting a reply to an elitistops person. They are just going to mock anyone who doesn't play exactly the way they do. The best way to deal with a bigot is to ignore it.
---
Ya, that's what I didn't understand about all these "the playercount is tanking!" Posts. Literally all that's tanking is the big boys unsubbing their alts.
---
Nah, just bot named alphas in pods...millions of them.
---
Well now you know how the ratters felt when they were just cannon fodder for hunters with no chance of making money in their home region.
---
same
---
How does it provide more safety?
---
sorry they dont stay out for you to get your 1337 kills
---
Yeah well you're just a mittani apologist you big meanie
---
Damn that's good
---
Oh cool, did they come out with covops cloaking hictors last patch? What ship can warp cloak AND tackle a super?
---
The majority disagreed you with you and spoke with their wallets.
---
The bots stayed.  The real players said “lolnah” to leave the hunters to chase the few remaining sheep.
---
The really good thing is, that it shows that CCP is willing to roll back changes fast, if their numbers show it didn't work as intended.
---
Now as they proved they are willing to roll back, they got more trust from the players to actually try out things.
---
It doesnt work man. I think we will see a reversal in the cyno change aswell or atleast iteration. You cant light the cyno right away because the defense fleet isnt ready. And it wont survive long on grid. So cyno inhibs will go up before you can light it and you have to light it from range and you will get bubbled to shit and things will die.
---
k
---
Blackout being gone.
---
The irony of your username is amazing
---
If intel is nerfed for defenders the free intel hunters use needs to get nerfed
---
Yes local has been around. You don't need to "tell the new generation of eve players" as if local has been gone for years. It's just been like 2 months. And the things you listed are an issue just made way way worse by local.
---
Take away zkill api stats and ingame map stats
---
PVErs couldn't PVE with 99 % safety anymore, while at the same time PVPers could kill with very high safety rate any subcap ratting/mining ship, unless few traps. And the cynonerf now make them able to do the same to any capital ship, unless the prey has a Recon alt and until Monday.
---
Fact is, PVPers would have become the new Krabs if not for the Local come-back, and PVErs already left *en masse* as there is no point to renew a subscription with a Blackout+Cynonerf combinaison.
---
Now well, the supercap umbrella exist but it has become so unpractical that it won't be used as much than before. But at least with local back online, it sounds like a fair trade, I will accept that... if we exclude the idea that it will probably stabilize more the nullsec politics, as attacking will be more troublesome. We shall see.
---
Citadels in every system is a problem, but it is the fault of CCP who didn't think of the consequences before-hand. And it is not like they couldn't predict it, it was Station Proliferation before Citadels, nearly each null-sec system had one... 15 B, not expensive, my corp made multiple ones.
---
Cyno Jamming is convenient for war defense, not for a day-to-day usage.
---
Blackout is leaving? Damn I missed something
---
[https://i.imgur.com/9LgOnmJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/9LgOnmJ.png)
---
So have a recon with a cyno. Problem would have been solved.
---
The "pve" guy has 95 percent of the advantages. Citadels in every system they can warp to. Supercap umbrella. Ansiblex gates to avoid camps. And now local to tell you to vanish the moment anyone shows in your system.
---
So if you kill my observatory my alliance is disbanded? Because it's apparently now "mandatory" so if I don't have one I guess my alliance just stops existing?
---
Nice takeaway lol
---
Gf!
---
When you get almost everything you want, the exceptions must seem so crushing.
---
Later dude.  The only constant is change.
---
The production values didnt drop as much as you think. Theres more than enough ore to keep the furnaces going for quite some time.
---
If by move you mean a lot of them got banned. Then yes they did move. And the majority of those that did move had their income, and this impact, dramatically cut.
---
People unsubbed....the 15 man krab accounts unsubbed because those are the people CCP attracted to the game.
---
I'm pretty sure I spelled out that the cost of redeeming asset safety stuff would be drastically reduced or eliminated even as a low percentage of the assets began to drop.
---
It's basically no change for those people.
---
It’s been a great year! Thanks for the support.
---
afk ones not,tanglers will web it to slow it into turtle.  that why  autopiloting freighter is bad
---
Doing crab shit.
---
That's actually something I kind of wonder about. How many reds flew through D-P during blackout but we're unnoticed?
---
Just have it not show you in local until you break gate cloak, zero dev time and works for everyone.
---
&gt;EVE isn't a game you win by fighting right now. Fighting became something for people who fuck up, you either over-escalate on your opponent or you bluebell...
---
This is the heart of a lot of it, &amp; idk if there's any way around it, since in Eve fights are *always* heavily determined by what you brought to the table, not how well you fly it. A lot of the reason we don't get fights in space is because people know the game too well; both gangs look at each other and know immediately who'll win, so one team fucks off. 
---
I'm increasingly thinking we should try instanced PvP in Abyssal sites, just to get around this. If you drop a gang into an Abyss site, by the time you know what the other gang has, it's too late to back out; and you can't over-escalate.
---
just memeing, glad you're still making videos, love most of them
---
Because it tells you when someone enters the constellation, so you rat in a dead end and get told when they're 3 jumps away.
---
And then give combat ceptors increased d-scan range.
---
False advertising. Angel capitals would be 'additional pirate faction capitals' not Minmatar capitals. We already have those.
---
The cyno changes weren't even for a week. 
---
The krabs refused to adapt, they just bitched.
---
You have no guarantee that is what he is flying. Or if he is in a fleet or not. It can give you a guess, but most pilots will fly at the very least a few ships. Is it near perfect? Sure, but again I have to actually, you know, look it up. And when local pops, I don't really have time to bust out my research to see if this guy is a guy I can take, I just dock up.
---
So your normal site fleet is dreads. 3x 3b dreads stuck there in siege. Someone content rolling to your site fleet means death in a way that their entire fleet is quicker killing your site ships than its even possible for you to close it. Just btw you see the sig pop up when someone actually went through from the other side and is already in the system.
---
Then there are other minor things like no asset safety etc.
---
Sometimes we like what they do and sometimes we don't, but you're drinking konspiracy koolaid if you think that what we want has any impact on the changes that CCP makes. Shit, they barely even listen to the CSM anymore. Why would they listen to us?
---
It didn’t have rorq mining, skill injectors, ore sites, 10/10 esculations from anoms, mass production of end game ships, etc. do i need to go on? Back then, the game was fucking amazing. Majority of Eve didn’t know what most t2 ships were. T3 wasnt a thing. So yeah, you wouldn’t understand pleb.
---
There was no "very high safety rate" for the PvPer. The PvPer has to traverse through enemy territory, avoid camps, blobs, local defenses. They have to find the target. Once they find the target they have to ensure they can defeat the target. If krabs actually had fits to defend themselves rather than minmaxing ratting they'd have much more luck. The krab can just as easily tell their friends to warp to them/cyno to them just as the hunter can. Black out made 50/50 parity balance between krab and hunter. You only feel that it was "unfair" because krabs have been living in near perfect safety.
---
I'm not sure if youre making a joke or not, because Serenity.
---
bots making less money is not bots being gone.
---
We don't GET what we want; we TAKE what we want.
---
I'm convinced you're cloaked and just eve posting rather than playing. No wonder his comment triggered you.
---
Nah. It’s usually that as the result is unknown, hunters are less afraid to tackle bait and people are less afraid to respond. Which results in the “unknown” outcomes that are fun. It people are obviously going to lose... they don’t fight. Because duh.
---
But wormholes are wormholes. They don't have permanent gates, entry/exit points can be managed to reduce the risks of the local PVErs. There isn't any external intel telling us that wormhole n°XXXX is more populated than the n°XXXY, you will have to check yourself. So Dscan CAN be not an hassle to use as it is harder for an hunter to find targets there.
---
In nullsec, everything is known and stargates are permanent. So Dscan only transform a player as a human bot. Scan (wait 2 s). Scan (wait 2 s). Scan (wait 2 s). Scan (wait 2 s). Scan (wait 2 s)... Not the same type of oil, but a bot nevertheless.
---
Again, wormhole way of life CAN'T be applied to nullsec, period.
---
lol k
---
Risk adverse people would just log off for the week. Not exactly great for content.
---
Because posting to Reddit and playing Eve both require the same amount of attention and time commitment, right? I guess tbf you guys semi-AFK the game anyways so there really isn't a difference for you. Just PVE until someone else goes and makes content for you
---
Eve will become great again un 2days
---
Nar, i like that each corp has to have a diplo that deals with this and some times that diplo makes mistakes. Because when standing go wrong fights happen. 
---
By all means improve the ui of it, but do not make it so its almost impossible for a diplo to cause a diplo incident.
---
I think both ends of the wormhole spawning sigs at the same would do what you want without causing more issues in wh space.
---
The change is they lose stuff they assumed was safe.
---
Stainguy post more than two sentences long, hard pass
---
Gosh you are daft, if you don't understand how having a cloaked ship watching every move a super makes and everywhere it warps makes tackling it easier you must be a big retard.
---
Well said OP, I agree 100%. I really hope local isn't exactly the same on Monday as it was pre-blackout. I like your idea of a constellation based local. Even that would be better than pre-blackout. Anything would honestly.
---
I don't want your sympathy, i want you and the other injector addicted hyperkrabs to stop rotting the game to death.
---
Nah, there's no discussion here. For there to be a meaningful discussion there would have to be a give and take of ideas. Not too many original ideas have been coming out of Iceland recently.
---
to get thanatos buy lots of copper elements cut them into pieces,corrode them with salt water to get green substance then hammer then and water them again for next green layer then  superglue  them together..  you have our thanatos.
---
tama p2
---
This could actually work.
---
And heres the issue. If you had our sympathy we would perhaps agree to certain changes that were beneficial to all. But keep at it. Being a cunt always fixes everything.
---
Okay... but how does this make me wrong about an aligned super being 100% safe?
---
Ya I have to agree... The Age of CHAOS is still in affect, and without any vision, and cancellation of Eve Vegas the chances of recovery would take a bit of time.  *At this time* recovery doesn't seem possible with the rate of decline I would liken it to Summer of Rage but people voted with their feet. How do you recover when people already chose (even with Alphas) just to simply not log in.
---
I think making the blackout tie into the trig invasions would be a decent idea. Only problem is you'd have to make the content difficult enough. Otherwise players could fight back the triglavions with minimal effort and never have to worry about blackouts. You could do a rehash of the Pirate FOBs and make them blackout local for the region it's located.
---
too late mine got tackled at c6
---
And with local back on thanks to cynochanges subcaps and regular carriers will be the only targets even worth going for. Take care that what you wished for doesn't come back to bite you.
---
&gt; It is a structure
---
&gt; It hat
---
I've always been for adding  hats to structures, you have my support
---
Now with local you don't even have to play the game, just watch near2 and post to reddit.
---
This would also make outlier areas of null that didn't have this infrastructure still in blackout condition.
---
I like it!
---
You linked a thread asking for the removal of asset safety in null.
---
And why does the 'unknown' need to be forced upon you? Dont use intel and scouts and sandbox your own blackout, if thats fun for you.
---
Some of the changes in the past (ancient Eve Online history at this point) have massively benefited your side (or did hurt it in other instances).
---
I was around and fought against Goonswarm when Band of Brothers was in power, so i am talking of about a decade ago.
---
Anyway, denying that Goonswarm has and had an influence on Eve and CCP‘s decisions is also lying to yourself.
---
I was around for the Technetium-Cartel, MAX, BoBs downfall and in the end the failed defense of their holdings in Delve and Querious after the disbanding of Band of Brothers, as well as the (short lived) resurrection in the form of IT Alliance and reconquest of said Regions about a year later.
---
I'll do it for you
---
I have to go that way today anyway
---
Do me a favour a slap a cloaked saber on the next one you see.
---
We tell them time and time again, "use a deep safe, if I can see you then they can see you".
---
They still do it because they rarely get caught out.
---
Read the comment that was linked it explains how much isk wormhole space makes.
---
For the little boys and their gank alts
---
You make so many assumptions. Granny's basement, super capital, you're just an idiot. I rarely ever roam or PvE in anything larger than a cruiser. I actually, you know, play the game. Do the activities that I enjoy to make isk. Exploration, escalations, market trading, gas huffing. If you had a shred of creativity you'd know making isk is more than just orbiting a haven at 30km with your VNI. Sorry you're a washed up dad with no energy, but please god don't make the rest of us suffer for it. It's not our fault you traded your time, energy and money on a crotch goblin.
---
I've been saying this for ages...
---
- Leave Local the way it is for High Sec. The Factions pay for monitoring, so they get it.
---
- Low Sec registers your name ***if you entered through a Gate***. It's still kinda Faction space, so they get registration through checkpoints. But if a ship Jumps in, it goes unregistered until it's noticed somehow.
---
- NPC Null goes without Local completely. Nobody "owns" it, so nobody pays for registration.
---
- Sov Null goes without, unless someone deploys a structure that enables it again. If the Big Boys want to have their safety blanket, they need to pay for it, one system at a time.
---
I've had limited time living in jspace, but these slides echo what I learned about it quite well.
---
Thank you very much. Between you and me, let's forget the last 2 videos ever happened :) o7
---
It seems like you don't understand what an exploit is or how dread farming works.
---
I quit around the time that alliance warfare stopped being about economics and started being just morale.  So many players and alliances have infinitely deep pockets that the economic balance of the fight no longer matters in a lot of cases.
---
Actually even more if you count the different ships &amp; cynos (I think)  
---
Black Ops (4)
---
Blockade Runner (4)
---
DST (4)
---
Industry Haulers (11)
---
It doesn't fucking matter which changes we agree on as CCP doesn't care about that as you might have noticed. Not like i didn't already know you were a smoothbrain after our little debate about supers...  
---
Your kind is a tumor and evidently one that grew too big for a chemo to help. And now go inject another Rorqual or something, i'm done with you.
---
mm, not what I'm doing, but ok
---
Looks awesome!
---
Or the range is such that there is almost always people in local. That way krabs must take some risk or never rat.
---
So dumb to revert this.... Blackout was good for eve.
---
Fucking goon Krabs
---
Actually that's not a bad point. I don't know for sure if there were (m)any small groups in Null before the blackout. But there sure as f\*\*k weren't any smaller than a mega-coalition after Blackout
---
But I do know that (for me) the most fun time to be in Null was right after Aegis dropped. I was not in a small group, I was in one of the three (count 'em) mega-coalitions which formed the original Blue Doughnut at the time. Once Aegis dropped, Null was thrown into a state of kH40s more profound than blackout could have hoped to be. Entire new alliances formed (I always point to Phoebe Freeport Republic even though they are named after an earlier expac) and null was never more active, with line members becoming relevant more than ever.
---
Before Aegis,the mechanics of Dominion sov meant that capital and supercapital blobs were the n+1 I win button which led to all of null being controlled by three groups who all blued each other.
---
Aegis fixed this, then Citadels brought n+1 back, meaning that since May 2016 most if not all the small groups have died or folded into bigger ones. There are about 5 distinct null mega-coalitions now, still better than Dominion, partially IMHO due to Aegis (and the death of the Chinese server) having brought so many 1000s of extra players to nullsec, but a depressingly small number for the whole of nullsec.
---
I love citadels, player made sand castles and the security of asset safety is what makes living in Null a reality for so many 1000s of players, but there is no denying their substantial contribution to the "stagnation" of null in the last couple of years. It's not the "krabs" fault, EvE online needs players, and Nullsec needs population whatever their play-style may be.
---
it would be a river of isk
---
sure. pm me with your in-game name
---
Free Hat!
---
Then also have something to fight over as people would defend this to keep the service up
---
fixed
---
Good thing Supercarriers don’t cost 20b anymore.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
Are you filthy rich?
---
To light a real cyno it is limited to only recons and blops.
---
Instead of keeping stuff but having to pay for the privilege to do so?
---
Lol. Right. Big change.
---
Better than bots raking in ISK hand over fist like before.
---
Upvoting for truth
---
Ah, provibloc is an independent little guy. kk
---
And people thought that the Old Sov 4 System with Constellation Sovereignity and POSes was bad...
---
I remember a time when you could anchor 2 jumpbridges in a system, where Eve was measured in 6 or so carrier jumps across the entire world...
---
Titans where glorified Buses, Supercarriers where glorified carriers that couldn't dock and Sniper-Battleship Fleets where the dominante doctrine.
---
Seems that every step CCP did (and they never where the ones to make small steps) did lead to more and not less stagnation.
---
Because at some point it needs to warp another site where it doesn't matter if he sees you if he gets tackled straight out of warp.
---
Here's my suggestion. 
---
First. Deny capital ratting
---
Exclude all kinds of capital Frome pve
---
Second. Maybe keep rorquals. But remove all capabilities of mining. Only buffet and support for mining fleets. 
---
And we are done.
---
&gt; Introduce a high slot module that can mask you from local  
---
&gt;Introduce another mod that gives dscan immunity  
---
&gt;Introduce links/AoE effect that can cloak a fleet from local  
---
&gt;Covops are cloaked from dscan and local.
---
Yes we need a middle ground, but these ideas are trash.
---
Do you have any idea the iskgasm that the incursion group in goons would have if their most mined systems got incursions more frequently?
---
They farm them as much as they can, and if they appear in critical systems (home systems usually), they'll headshot the incursion in a couple of hours. Turns out that if you dont care about payout, 200 tracking titans and 400 supercarriers will obliterate an incursion in &lt;6 hours.
---
well maby eve will go ahead and turn into a full blown pve mission runing game so i can save 50 $ a month we can only hope that some one else will make a game as good as eve was when i joined
---
To think he was so close to winning eve too...
---
Why would this super warp to an anom he can't dscan?
---
More importantly, why is it accepted that people should rat in supers anyway?
---
Idk if you're so stupid you dont realize local is there as an intel tool not chat tool, or not. You clearly don't get tongue in cheek statements so v0v
---
&gt;  usually don't seriouspost on reddit  
---
Guess you still don't
---
Let combat ceptors d-scan cloaked ships.
---
"worth going for" how would it ever not be 'worth' going for supers and rorqs lmao
---
Truth.
---
What really happened a ~majority~ of the time was: A neut entered system, nobody knew, nothing happened, neut kept flying.
---
The only cancer I've seen laid out in the open lately is the mentality shown by "elite" pvpers that think they are owed free frags or even a "fair" fight because they dared roam into null space. This is eve, nothing is just given for nothing and sure as hell there's no such thing as a fair fight. If you venture onto the turf of a large alliance expect to have the full force of that alliance come down on your head for daring trespass without a force equal to or greater than our own. This is not an area where small groups belong. You want small gang content, stick to LS, FW, or study dotlan and figure out which systems mark the fringes of each null entity where the response times will be the longest.
---
Be it with local or without, people who get caught are caught for taking more risk than they should or making stupid mistakes. Those are and always have been the "proper" targets. Blackout was the failure it was because the only proper move to make for the krabs was to simply not undock, and most people understood that. Those that didn't, you can find their names on zkill. Even when local is back, you'll see those same people up there again due to making incorrect decisions all over again.
---
If CCP want's to fix null they just have to listen to us. We're very honest since we also love this game but don't just look at the game in terms of zkill.  Here's a hint: it's time timers! It's the unending citadel spam since there are no system caps or anchor requirements. It's the week of waiting required because you missed a 15 minute timer. It's the "back to square one" if you mess up a single timer, while the defender must do nothing to repair their own structure after having failed to defend 1-2 previous timers. It's the ihub upgrades which allow even the worst of systems to sustain a small group of players allowing for turtling under the umbrella rather than forcing us to spread out and hold more space to sustain a larger group forcing people to rat outside of "protected" space. I could go on forever, point is. The problems have been pointed out many times, many before they were ever released into the game.
---
Right and the people living there explained some of the things you didn’t take into account.
---
No one is saying that wormholes aren’t good. They do however have a lot of things balancing them.
---
Null remains one of the most profitable areas in the game, none of the mitigating factors of wormholes, and pre-chaos a 99% safety blanket under a super umbrella.
---
If you make regions deplete their ore if they are mined too much, goons and other groups will end up rotating through surrounding regions.
---
They do this right now, with LocustFleet.
---
Every 2 weeks, a set of moons in Querious, Period Basis, and Fountain pop (they are on 6 week cycles, so one set every 2 weeks), deploy the supers near them, and ring the dinner bell, saying "Lots of free moongoo for you all, come and mine it", and 200-400 rorquals go mine out 20-30 moons in 2-3 hours.
---
If regions depleted, there'd be circular deployments to each surrounding region, sucking up the ore, and leaving when it's gone. Hell, i'd expect goons to do this OFFENSIVELY as well. Deploy to a hostile region with overwhelming supercap superiority, and mine/rat as much as you can, to extract all the value possible. Then a month later, leave, and let it recover over 6 months (presuming it runs on a 6 month cycle).
---
Remember when CCP tried to make Eve the harsh, uncaring, difficult game it is circlejerked over being, but the players turned into such monumental fucking pussies they left?
---
I 'member.
---
Serinus - exact phrase only
---
Just make it delayed and/or not give any info abut the person in system other than standings until they speak in chat. There goes your pefect Intel.
---
I'd love games workshop to partner with CCP and make model kits for ships
---
That's one of the few things I think CCP should take a zero-tolerance policy toward. There comes a point where there is no justification for some behaviors, and anyone who tries to vandalize this monument deserves to get smashed for it.
---
Delve
---
So if this fleet is so vulnerable, why aren't they dying on a regular basis to people hunting them? A grand total of 18 dreads died in all C6 in August, 21 in July. Is it fair to say that the large WH groups have blued each other in C6 just like how the Blocs blued each other in Perimeter.
---
Glad you had the chance to put this together. Hopefully it helps.
---
They only went back because of their bottom line, removing injectors has the same effect as driving out players so they won't touch that, hopefully they will do something with citadels though.
---
See, this is the very same reason CCP should never even have tried to listen to certain people. The rest of us "bots" stuck around when shit was bad and still is. You guys only stay if you can be OP. But I wont be missing the weekly "yay keep blackout, love waffles" posts.
---
However, since Im not an idiot (a big enough atleast) I realise we actually need more players which is why I can agree that completely reverting was a bad call. They should implement a short delay which gives some time for hunters to actually scan down stuff.
---
The old idea that has been around for awhile is that cloaks have a "Burnout" duration, where they take 1% of damage every x minutes of being cloaked. If this was a 1% per minute type deal, cloaks would last, on average, 1hr 40min of actively being used.
---
To make this not impact people who move around, give it a 5-10 minute timer before the cloak starts taking any damage. 
---
This punishes cloakycamping, requiring a new cyno module to be fitted (with the mobile depot deployed as well), every 2 hours, but doesnt really impact people who move around while cloaked for short periods (if you deactivate cloak before the 5-10 minute timer is up, no damage).
---
This will also increase the demand for Nanite Paste, which has seen a drop in usage following citadels.
---
Obviouly spoken by someone who has never lived in a wormhole.
---
they still are they are just making less then they were.
---
Sorry i deleted cause just sperging too much... but since u caught it... 
---
I'd just like to see less cloaky/uncatchable kitey bullshit... Nullsec is about fighting, Highsec is for ganking... fights need to have some commitment involved and I think the lack of commitment in favor of being invisible/uncatchable... and spoils of war go to the winner... CCP need to make some incentive for battle (without fucking everyone over)... like a few MASSIVE deposits of Techium (or whatever mega T2 moon ore or clusters of NPC Sotiyos... OR like maybe Alliance based 30 day destroyed value BONUS to TANK/DPS/MINING yield.... i dunno maybe not exactly that... but something like that...
---
Blobs and gate camps could be avoided during the Blackout, you just have to use the map and apply "Average pilote in space in the last 30 minutes". More than 4 people in the usual "checkpoints" is suspicious enough to expect a possible gatecamp, and a big red circle meaned a big conflict somewhere...
---
Or with a nullified strategic cruiser, you can avoid most of the annoyances and reconfigure it after a while using a mobile depot...
---
You know that the vast majority of Krabs won't be PVP fitted and so unable to fight back. Calling a friend is possible if there is one in the same system who is NOT in a PVE ship... The risks to be rekt could have been hardly accepted with Local for you, but definitively too low without.
---
You wanted to become the new Krabs. Killing easy preys during the first week of the Blackout as the hunted ones wouldn't even understand what the heck was going on. It happened, and now we all pay the price with a crashing PCU.
---
Oh ye. Peoples input dont matter on a subject which CCP has said players input will matter on. Sure:)
---
If I had Rorqs then maybe ye. Stop being so butthurt cause others enjoy the game.
---
\^This, sov wanding the way it works completely sucks. But dominion and before that POS sov was just as terrible in different ways. At least occupancy sov makes sense.
---
This is Eve 2019, the krabs have won... apparently the majority of the playerbase wants to only shoot rocks or npcs and despise the idea of shooting actual people
---
RIP
---
MFW people say during a stratop deep in panda land "Intel is saying a carrier is tackled in eso" like we can do anything about it.
---
Congrats Reddit Crybabies!
---
This video reminds me off those facebook videos with the yellow text and the really enthusiastic music
---
When people need ping the guy in discord to tell them to get on comms you know they fucked up
---
The R64 Moons and POS Sov of my time should be mentioned here.
---
I think that those where the better system compared to what followed.
---
Do not get me wrong, they where not without flaws, but i think that itteration instead of complete overhaul would have benefited the game.
---
CCP always seems to opt for the Sledgehammer-Approach instead of trying smaller changes.
---
And in the end i think that they made the problems of old worse instead of fixing them.
---
Sure.
---
Nerf the free hunting intel hunters use first
---
CCP is in the pocket of big goon mining
---
inb4  ccp return into trial account system.
---
Rorquals are just the tip of the iceberg. Instant intel using local chat combined with tools like Near2 is other massive problem. It created an culture of warping your afk vni to anomaly and watching netflix while you make relatively massive income with really low risks. People have done that in highsec belt mining but the income there is less than your computer electricity bill. And you are in higher risk to get suicide ganked.
---
I could continue writing massive wall of text about the dangers of promoting solo isk farming gameplay instead of teamwork heavy pvp gameplay. Forcing players to stop farming and start playing with each other etc. But I think I'm done. Enjoy.
---
And they aren't getting me to come back after leaving due to hilmar's bipolar approach to game changes he is calling "chaos". This is why you don't randomly fuck with your player base like this, it just pisses everyone off in the end.
---
[Complete list of highsec incursion constellations.](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Constellation_layouts_for_Incursions)
---
Well there is not that many sites to do. You wait for week for them to buildup then you close current system and do the sites in few hours. Also capital ratting is only viable in your home system since you cant get back after 3 caps jump hole. Ratting in static is often quite inefficient compared to local site running with dreads since you ether need 2 logi pilots or few 2,5b rattles.
---
Whaaat i thought running and docking was unfun and why we needed blackout
---
Surely you are t defending the other side doing that?  That’d be such hypocrisy
---
It's honestly just effort on CCP part 
---
Cuz that's ideally the next step for them there is a lore reason now with black out for upwell to make one.
---
But honestly there so many things ccp needs to do and balance is the largest concern.. brining back full on local in NS isn't great for balance.. altho now that cynos have been nerfed into Oblivion maybe a full local wouldn't be so bad beyond ratters immediately docking up . But I support a till you drop gate cloak approach.
---
Altho observatories are suprior to both from a gameplay prospective. Something to disrupt, small no docking like the jump bridges, Make it a FLEX structure.
---
But BUTTTT fuck if burger knows what he's doing. NVM hilmar..
---
well I mean NPC null is owned by the NPC faction
---
&gt; Let's see Goons come and destroy it for no good reason this time :)
---
That's one of the few things I think CCP should take a zero-tolerance policy toward. There comes a point where there is no justification for some behaviors, and anyone who tries to vandalize this monument and the people it commemorates deserves to be smashed *hard*.
---
On a related note, [Karttoon was a self-righteous prick](https://www.eveonline.com/article/molea-cemetery-destroyed-by-jihadswarm) and [DaiTengu was an asshole](http://www.eve-search.com/thread/1186978/page/6) for vandalizing the past versions of this monument. Seriously, what a way to prove you don't have any class.
---
Talking about npc kills and stuff per hr via api ? Would be interesting to delay that.. but CCP should really stick to a single change at a time let it settle see how people like it then move on to next thing. But hey what do I know about running a MMO \o/
---
So they course-corrected without touching the ship itself? Sounds like a good strategy.
---
I loved blackout and cyno changes, but that's because im a wormholer and the salty tears of nullbears keep me happy when hunting
---
They don’t need to with the map feeding them pve intel
---
Can confirm: if you're in the chain you're fair game!
---
Because theres much more warning and time to safe up again aswell as to get ready to safe them. Because you can't pull stunts like sneaking in 5 tackle strats unnoticed anymore. And dictors will be reported from miles away again unless you roll right into a ratting system with a wh.  
---
And let's not start about the combination of Cynochanges and dreadbombs.
---
And Rorquals are already the worst targets now since due to the stationary nature of their activity most of them have recons around which will propably just keep their cynos running when someone enters the system when local is back. No sudden appearing and trying to burn them before they can cyno anymore. I could go on but you get the gist.  
---
Blackout was heaven for hunting the big guys. It was great for actually disrupting the ivory castles. Hell, yesterday a ping went out to "try something new" and make all the Rorqs dock because there were groups out hunting.
---
1) Harassment doesn’t do shit to stop big empires 
---
2) they already use smaller and faster unless eve unleashes a “mega frigate”
---
Why do frigates fight carriers without anything that counters this fact?
---
You would cloak up, come back in a few hours and hotdrop someone without them having a chance to counter.
---
No but we didn't have jumping. Running logistics for an alliance involved scouting and escort fleets. And we didn't have caps. Or asset safety. Null was a constant battlefield. Alliances were rising and falling all the time, losing systems, ect.    
---
Current null is just silly.
---
I have against the age of chaos from the start, lots of shit was handle poorly. But I due feel they deserve some credit for backing off. It couldnt have been an easy choice. 
---
I hope they work with the players. Just give out a survey of our biggest concerns and start adressing some with the help of the CSM. And for us on this sub, we dont need to be toxic cunts all the time. Try talking to eachother and we might get somewhere. Its hell of a lot easier to get CCP to try out changes that most can stand behind.
---
^ that last part
---
Never lost a ship due to blackout, never stopped playing or krabbing either. My rorq alt was the only thing to get attacked once, by a bomber and kitchen sink gang, around 20 nerds,  but they had no escalation I guess...
---
Honestly,  I liked having no local, it made hunting interesting, and the heightened risk of krabbing made it more exciting again, even if I was lucky it was quiet.
---
Would mean CCP had to do some work other than changing a 1 to a 0
---
Ive been saying it for the last 3 years eve needs a  arena system with quick match up in 1vs1, 3s3 and 5vs5 modes. Not instanced with real ship loss and also allow 3rd parties to bet on the outcome.
---
Dude. It ain’t me. I roam regardless. It’s the response. I’ll take a fight at a disadvantage and don’t really care. I’m talking about what I’ve observed. The “unknown” allows for people to react without perfect intel. Without the perfect expectation of how an engagement may end. VNI changes already have hunters at somewhat of a disadvantage. Someone solo hunting not has to be within scram range of either domis or myrms in order to tackle them. Because mjds. Then warp core stabs. And I don’t even care for the sake of the ratter themselves... because while killing ratters is alright, the real hope with tackling a ratter when you have a small gang is the response. Yeah, no one wants 20 supers. But subcaps, even outnumbered is the real goal. The real challenge. 🤷‍♂️ also I’m tispy so. Meh. Lol
---
It does mean, in each wormhole there is a higher chance of more sigs that are wormholes to k space spawning. So, you will have to waste a bit of time scanning those down and checking where they lead. But it won’t be a significant change for explorers
---
how long have you been playing cause i can tell you 4-5 times goons CRIED THEIR EYES OUT and things got nerfed
---
I mean the bottom line is fw is  dead tbh , and that’s why you are having a hard time finding targets. Joining a milita might give you options to group up for small-scale pvp but at that point I think you’re better off looking for a good pvp Corp.  Nice to see you aren’t becoming a bitter afg vet like me ,posting “meh” to every post you see but tbh I don’t think there is any easy answer. Fw is cool and all but as you can see kinda dead, if you hunt in null be prepared to spend hours hunting to find nothing/get blueballed or get turbo blobbed escalated on in delve/horde space. As for wh space well don’t even get me started....... ☹️
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrBSbZMISvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrBSbZMISvM)
---
Meh. I doubt we have the player count and interest in something like this to make it work well.
---
Also I probably just answered my own, deeper question about whether I should keep looking for 1v1 frigate PvP in lowsec.
---
Cant deny
---
More than the man who ranked his playerbase by a solid third in less than a half year
---
Pretty impressive tbh
---
Are you admitting the BO was poorly implemented? Thats gotta sting.
---
But ye, citadels most def. Low power should be killed right off. 1 timer on small stuff, 2 timers on medium and perhaps 3 timers and xl.
---
Fozziesov, atleast move it up to a constellation level instead of timers for every fking system. 
---
And for the love of god, either remove excavators or only allow 1 rorq to be sieged in a cluster. They should be boosters and not the premiere mining ship in the game. But give people the ability to resell them to NPC orders for a short while or something. Maybe return some SP or something aswell if people want it.
---
And either revert the cyno change or make it hell of a lot easier to swallow. The current one is really crap.
---
Thank you, come again!
---
A) I didn't say it was an exploit, I said you can exploit the mechanic. If you don't know what the definition of exploit is, here ya go: to make productive use of and/or to make use of meanly or unfairly for one's own advantage. (idiot)
---
B) I know that dread insurance is stupid and unless you are blinging your dreads, replacing an entire fleet on that off chance you do get rolled into is a joke.
---
I don't care if you guys krab, i truly don't, make all your isk while you can. Just don't try to pull the wool over everyone's eyes and claim its dangerous or hard. It's probably going to get nerfed into the ground eventually so krab it up.
---
Rolling your static and keeping an eye on sigs. You really think that thats all you need to do to not die?
---
How about bonus wave log off traps, fax and carrier avenger escalations and reverse scanning?
---
\` gangs teleporting on you via cynos \`
---
you know rolling into someone is like teleporting your staging system right next door to them right?
---
I live in a C5, I've killed many dreads in C5 and C6 space. Any competent group rolling to kill dreads will have a near 100% success rate when they find the ratters. Explain to me again how this is safer then a super umbrella?
---
Eve subreddit will complain anyway so it doesn’t matter what you post here. They will blame ccp for anything.
---
Everyone said "CCP has better numbers" so now I'm curious what those numbers said
---
&gt; too be fair those were completely different ship models then we have today. They were based on the old graphics engine and much simpler.
---
They sold the 2nd version of the Megathron after the major graphics overhaul. The reason they discontinued the models is simply because they were losing money on them IIRC.
---
sorry that you're so smooth brained you think null should be safe.
---
it was killing the areas around you? what do you expect when you blue everyone up lol
---
I mean, Delve largely the same
---
Hah. You posted too soon. I replied with "meh" to a comment only seconds before your comment appeared.
---
I mean... it's hard to be overly bitter, I guess? I'm a bite vet for sure, but I also spent billions of isk subbing through like 2023 earlier this year, so if I find some in then great, but if not I'll just fade away for good. It's not like I don't have other games that I enjoy without the enormous overhead that eve practically requires in order to have a few fun fights.
---
I get your frustration. But I knew this was gonna happen sooner or later. These changes were too harsh and it would just slingshot back. 
---
If those things are issues, which I agree they are, I say lets attack them straight on. Not by nerfing all of NS but by fixing those specific issues.
---
Take a break, catch your breath man. I get the feelings you have atm.
---
Your not saying anything except that nullsec is too productive.  Just bitching by stating the obvious with no other point. Why bother.
---
I'd reply again but your point seems to change with every one.
---
Keep having fun dude. Although TBH you sound bitter rather than fulfilled.
---
btw: you're welcome for keeping the lights on all these years . EvE would be long dead on subscription money only .
---
&gt; This is a point I'm increasingly hammering on in my push for a total PvE system revamp. Eve's PvE system has always been fundamentally anti-content: PvE ships can't fight, relying on either warpout or backup.
---
I'd love to pick your brain on this topic, because ever since the first...month - I think? - of playing EvE I thought that there ought to be little difference between a PvE and PvP fit. Rats should be fitted out like actual ships would be, and they should behave in logical ways for their fleet composition and capabilities.
---
The question is how does CCP accomplish this? Their legacy code is a nightmare, and in all likelihood is *the* major reason their development is so slow.
---
&gt; Just a bit more expensive.
---
o_0 a bit?
---
Oh very much this. We told them how all of this was gonna play out and they told us to fk ourselves, that CCP was finally on their side. 
---
But I do agree with them on the middle ground. Think most of us do.
---
&gt;TFW a goon realizes communist living is a sham
---
That's another part of the problem, true. The more you move pvp towards high SP platforms, the longer it takes for newbros to be useful and (also very important), the harder it is for them to be competent in anything smaller.
---
It's funny newbro life is that hard, because we now have both alpha clones and a much less elitist nullsec. If anything, it's gone too far in the other extreme of the spectrum. It's now a place where complete casuals can easily live and make it alongside the hardcore players, and i don't even mean that in terms of average hours they play, but in terms of mentality and willingness (or lack thereof) to develop their skills. We also have a lot of corps specifically geared to taking in newbies. It should be a piece of cake.
---
And yet, rookies are mostly useless for extended periods of time unless they either inject directly into capitals or a couple of specific doctrines, or become cannon fodder in a big enough fleet so that their lack of SP and experience can be sufficiently diluted, lost and mitigated by the other fleet members.
---
Well, back in 2004-2006 when i first played, it was the exact opposite. Guys who had been playing just a year longer than you (the game launched in 2003), would scream to you in local "go back to hisec, i've been playing since beta". And yet, you could be extra useful in a tech1 frigate and make them eat their words.
---
I still remember the first successful tackle i landed on a sniping geddon (different bonuses back then) who was running logon/logoff traps on our guys near our home station. There was no aggression timer when i started playing, they introduced it a bit before or after this incident.
---
So, i burned straight for him and lost a rifter to his 7 mega pulse IIs and a full rack of heat sink IIs (there was no stacking penalty yet, geddon was the prime gank ship bar none).
---
I used my instadock bookmark to land my pod in docking range, got another rifter from the corp hangar and hurriedly fit it as my buddies were outside trying to land tackle without getting their face melted off. We were in null for less than a week and didn't even have time to sort out our logistics properly due to constant harassment, so there were no pre-fit ships ready to fly, just hulls and modules in the hangar.
---
So i fit a new rifter, undock again and just as he's about to warp out, i land the scram and our FC is yelling on comms "good job dude, scram RIGHT IN THE FAAAAAACE!".
---
That and a lot of other similar situations is what got me to stick around for 2 years, start training into HACs the moment they were announced and even decide on the kind of ships and combat scenarios i wanted to specialize in.
---
It was exciting, it was difficult and it was punishing, because i was routinely flying stuff i couldn't replace in less than a month of full-time ratting in belts (no anoms back then either). And that's why it was challenging and engaging.
---
Now it's just "here, take these ships...here, train these skills to fly them...here take this skill plan that takes two years to complete before you can really be useful to us...congrats you're ready. Now go out there and farm anoms until you have enough isk to inject into it and get 2 years worth of SP while having 6 months of experience".
---
And of course, if people jump ahead so much, they have no clue how things work in the first place and they can't be useful or effective in anything smaller, because they didn't learn to fly smart in the first place. And when CCP even hints at rebalancing the hulls they use, they'll throw a tantrum and unsubscribe because nobody told them that there was a time you could be useful in a cruiser and have tons of fun right out of the gate, without the massive isk and SP investment that is necessary today.
---
How do you solve this? Well, i have a few ideas, but it's a whole different can of worms. Long story short, it revolves around sov mechanics that have objectives for subcap roaming fleets to complete (shoot parts of stations/citadels to disable specific services, no timers, just an opportunity for disruption to force fights), capital ship rebalance (nerf to application so they can't delete subcaps from the field willy-nilly, role changed back to anti-cap and anti-structure) and a rebalance of citadels in general (less structure grind, more rewards).
---
In other words, have meaningful objectives for all sizes and classes of ships, instead of one class dominating everything. Then newbros can be and feel useful again, and maybe stick around.
---
You sound like the kind of asshole who loses at Monopoly and accuses everyone else of cheating. 
---
I've been playing since 06. I've fought BoB before and after joining Goonswarm. I followed the war between them before I joined (in 09). For every instance you can name where CCP made a change that benefited Goons, I can name two where they fucked us. 
---
I know it's hard for you to believe, but the bottom line is that CCP going to play favorites. There's no upside to it and a HUGE downside if they ever got caught. I know because it's already happened once. When the game was new, they DID give certain players (and, by extension, their alliances) special access (mostly just the ability to IM devs with problems and concerns instead of relying on petitions and the Eve-O forums) and it blew up in their fucking faces. They had good intentions, but they let it go too far. It resulted in the t20 scandal and a massive loss of player confidence; which led the formation of the first CSM. CCP knows that they would be sticking their dicks in a public relations meatgrinder if it ever came out that they favored the agendas of any one player group over any other. Nobody's going to risk their career for us and we sure as hell don't need them to.
---
spoken like someone who's never responded to a 100man fleet that's trying to fuck a bro
---
&gt; I would also like to point out that some of the most active/elite pvpers i know are some of the filthiest crabs in the game
---
This is very true. The same guy who was multiboxing miners and slurpes up 2bn in moon goo one morning? he is the same guy I hear spending hours hunting and providing either tackle or logi as needed.
---
Shit, I almost burned out an afterburner on my PVE battleship running to scoop my MTU because a fleet ping went out.
---
But delve is ruining the game.
---
you probably crab in safe pace
---
&gt; If CCP would fix things regularly and gradually vs "YOLO Chaos Era" types of patches, you wouldn't get mass alienation of players...
---
Yeah, I think the best way to get things back into old-style EvE is a more gradual approach to avoid the shock caused by massive, sudden changes, like a beneficial counterpart to the [boiling frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog) metaphor.
---
Umbrella space shall once again be safe for botting and bot-aspirant behavior.
---
I've been playing since 2006 and I joined Goonswarm in 2009. As I said elsewhere, for every time you can name a change that helped us, I can name two that fucked us.
---
It's like 200mil more, I don't consider that a lot in eve 2019
---
Everyone has known for at least 3 years that c6 and c5 was farm city, c4/c1 is a wasteland, and c2 is krab home central, with isk and null teleports.  
---
C3 space seems to remain the only real example of something resembling what the original vision for WH space was.
---
I don't know about goons, but in TEST, krabs hate it wen the nullsec incursions spawn. They tend to avoid them and it's a good opportunity for the PVP crowd to come out and make good isk for a few hours. They interfere with logistics, mining, moons, ratting, and travel.
---
Wait they canceled eve vegas ?  Why
---
chaos era btw
---
Woooow. Too soon:)
---
INIT Boosh Ravens VS NC. Boosh Rokhs happened a lot before EVE became HAC online.
