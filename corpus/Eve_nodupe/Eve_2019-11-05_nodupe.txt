It's always funny to read about people shitting on Rorquals because they can't kill them with 10 destroyers. It's a fucking CAPITAL ship, nerd, not some random battleship. God bless you can't just come in there with 10 shitty 5 mill trashers or catalysts and take a Rorqual down.
---
---
---
The issue is not the umbrella. Let's admit that tomorrow CCP changes Capitals so that they are ineffective against subs (no HAWs, not enough tracking for fighters to track subs), big alliances would just bridge in fleets of subscapitals and the result would be the same.
---

---
The issue here is not people protecting their Rorquals, it's people expecting to kill Rorquals without any resistance nice and easy.
---
drop drone capacity substantially and add "mining fighters" that replace excavs? Interesting idea actually

as far as I can tell, that reflects things correctly (with vindictive joining blue donut)

also Coalition mapmode is quite out of date alliance wize

This poor guy was bashing himself into a refinery for over 45 minutes trying to get to me.
---
We get 3 to 5 daily content and qrf fleets in fountain. It's actually fun. As far as an invasion? No, we've been on the upswing for 3 years.

Perpetuum was eves little brother. wondered at the time how it was so close to eve but yet different enough to draw people.  Most who played eve for the most part . . There was that exodus from eve to perpetuum that one time I forget what it was over. Lasted all but a month but pop exploded .  would have made for a great ground version of eve . Ccp tech and these dudes ideas woulda blown away dust. It did as it was. Community was cool miss it . hopefully ville and group are keeping it going . Played it thoroughly from start till server company close
---
It gets brought up, but is downvoted into oblivion each time it occurs in a more visible location.
---
Hunters won't knowingly engage a target they can lose to or freely escape from, so the only valid defenses for someone engaged in PvE is avoidance or flying bait.
---
Flying bait gets expensive when you have to tank against the rats, tank against your resist holes (since that's what the Hunter will be shooting), and ensure that you've got the ewar/speed to keep them on grid long enough to kill them.
---
Tall order in this era of 1k DPS destroyers.
---
You have the goonswarm problem of having too many stations where you can set your clone
---
Best solution is to right click the station name in the upper left and and use the drop down set home station feature.
---
Use the other direct x variant that is offered in the launcher settings - missing DLL hints that your system is out of date
---
Can’t see why you wouldn’t see at least one, if they got even a decent number of people in PVP ships supporting it you could field one, none of the blocs would care enough when the other blocs will more reliably give them unsupported morons to drop

This is a good attempt at hiding a stealth "come join us" recruitment post... Just not quite good enough.

---
... a child-like giggle of glee.
---
I just start with the probes at 8au and center them on planets, then work down from there, any others that get hit at all from that first pass can start at 4au.
---
Or hit the whole system with a big scan, and start with 4 on each sig.
---
I’m going to watch other people do it on YouTube now to make sure I’m not doing something terribly inefficient.
---
And then what happens if you wait 26 seconds?
---
Yup, I know which it is, I just wasn't very sure that the deviation was the same on a 2 point vs a pinpoint.
---
FIRST, FUCK ALL OF YOU.
---
Goons run Delve better than how CCP runs Eve Online.
---
Light slow. Hm
---
CAN'T HEAR YOUR LOWERCASE ASS
---
You can get the referal retroactively activated if you open a ticket. :]
---
30% of the value if moved to low sec.
---
I do a blanket scan to get as many individual points, then I do 8, 2, 0.5au. If I get spheres then I do 16au, 4 , 1. 
---
Gas sites are the quickest scan and usually resolve at 2au. I then use the ignore function on them to clean. 
---
My K162 are level 1. 
---
The 2 static sigs are usually level 3.
---
Hey, sorry for kinda up-shipping on you guys. When we were forming for round 2, we only had like 5 ships to your 10 so we had to go a little bit blingy.
---
To be fair for a game with a 2sec server tick and so low input requirements (overall) he absolutely sucks at gameplay...
---
He's also oblivious to gamemechanics, I watched him allmost loosing his jumpfreighter to a Nyx on undoch because he warped instead of align.
---
Also his carrier tutorial sucks.
---
As far as I know, CCP did catch some bots but also made a lot of terrible mistake(or deliberate action) against innocent players with so called ban on botting. They did not have big trouble so far because CCP is a company registered in Iceland which is hard for normal players(or consumers) in other countries to sue them. In some stage, players may realize CCP just mix their unspeakable agenda with so called bot catching campaign. Look at Brian Schoeneman's case in which he has been cleared of any wrong doing . What if he is just nobody in real life instead of being an american lobbyist.
---
trying to adapt lol
---
who cares dude
---
I can’t wait for them to silently turn off the Halloween event and start seeing tragic posts of killboard padding gone wrong, lol
---
Only you couldn't anchor death star POSes in asteroid belts and use them to guard your miners...
---
It's very simple. Either the delay is long enough so that PvP'ers significantly increase their chances of ganking PvE'ers, then the latter ones won't be happy and the effect will be similar to the last blackout. Or the delay is not long enough to pose a significantly higher risk to PvE'ers or being caught, then the PvP'ers who want easy ganks will continue bawling about local being unfair and imbalanced.
---
Usual spy ops in EVE.
---
I don't see the problem with dusties being in the same corp/alliance, on the opposite it would strengthen the link between EVE and the FPS game.
---
The Matchmaking game could be separated from the Capture game and have different rewards, metas, etc. And seriously, if you do not have the numbers to field a FPS team, what business do you have owning a Citadel (I don't like this argument as I can see solo players wanting them too, but there is some truth to it).
---
Hell, in the worst case, *just hire some mercenaries that fight that battle*. You can't get more EVE than that!
---
Its been dying since 2004
---
Just make the gameplay hard and deep enough and bots won't be able to bot it *efficiently*.
---
EVE is botted to hell because the gameplay involves clicking on a list and once on some buttons...
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
reached the same milestone a few weeks ago! congratz!
---
its an awesome feeling when you can finally drop onto solo roamers and bash structures with it!
---
the true endgame content!
---
Holy shit, reading this is so disappointing. No wonder the game is void of meaningful content.
---
I believe it's only affecting Eve at the moment, but you never know where GS will pop up next!
---
My very first thought ...
---
Patch note*
---
:p
---
Am I the only idiot who starts at the too and works their way down? Unless I get a few close-by hits in the neighborhood.
---
did ccp intend to release a single patch note instead of the whole lot?
---
cos it kinda slaps of incompetence to release 1 of a set of patch notes for seemingly no reason.
---
reliminary!
---
This is a single change that's happening outside the normal release cadence. Full November release very much still to come :)
---
So there IS a mini-AT now, but only if you're Korean.  Sorry I rolled the wrong fucking race, CCP.
---
Let's be honest. Nullbears don't want to fight roamers, they want to get rid of them so they can continue crabbing ;)
---
I think I lost CCP at "PvP"
---
We could tie it to the Karma gained on r/EVE... Or to the number of bans they received ingame... Yeah, that has a potential...
---
tldr?
---
That might be one way to tackle the issue. To be fair, the ships that are used to run the emerging conduits arent cheap and testing stuff can be rather risky so its not perfect either
---
Dont forget to give folks your SIG-ID, so they know its not that one they needa scan for...
---
Nice! Eyes forward capsuleer, for the cyno is not yet lit!
---
Yes, alphabetic scanning is very inefficient in almost all situations (exceptions being scanning with a buddy or scanning a drifter hole, and even then it's questionable)
---
Testing some newbies getting bonuses
---
Because \~software development\~
---
And there are many ways to do it! I still get bored quick by solo ratting, I prefer multiboxing but it gets quite busy and.. so risky when something pops up
---
AHAHAHAHAHHAH
---
V-3, LXQ, facwar, etc
---
Oh I thought you were talking about low sec! Lol in null, paying attention often means we know you are coming like 5J away. 15 seconds means little. Do you have any idea how often you guys get reported on intel channels?
---
For the guys who don't have a big enough coalition to know you are coming 5+J out, the last thing they need is a nerf to their income; they need to grow, not be driven out of space by making it entirely unprofitable.
---
V-3 ( i'm assuming you mean the GE- border ) really isn't that great of a system to fight, generally you will be massively outnumbered limiting your engage options LXQ has the same problem.
---
Honestly FW i never really found that many fights regardless of fishing or baiting like the average between fights still is still in the hours mark and at that point i logged off to play anything else
---
That's just one of my blood gang boiz doing the b-walk
---
ㅋㅋㅋ
---
Your "hostile space station" is exactly a problem because it outright denies any and all possibilty of content in it's vicinity. Don't you see that that is problematic?  
---
We went from POSs being the only structures with defensive capabilities to every single structure in the game having them. Cool, sounds good... wait we can deploy an unlimited number of them anywhere in space? Major yikes detected.  
---
  
---
Here are some knock-on effects from shit citadel balance:  
---
-Gate traffic is reduced because of fatigue-less Ansiblex travel (anchored on citadel grid btw).  
---
-The amount of engageable miners is reduced because ~half of them are already on grid with a structure (+ rorqs btw).  
---
-There are no good ways to make people undock, outside of shooting a structure (which requires to hit the dps threshhold btw) that can pretty much defend itself against small gangs.  
---
-Deploying stop bubbles on citadels is ass because of how big the grid is, and again, it will shoot and kill you if you hang around (have i mentioned that)
---
You have probably a very limited idea of just how tedious finding content while roaming has become. I urge you to try roaming yourself in hostile space, generating content from the leftover crumbs that the game is giving you. That should give you some perspective.
---
Get banned multiboxer
---
but you don't get a fight started - you just come back on here screeching about supercap umbrellas etc.
---
&gt;that's dank PvP.
---
Pretty sure I specifically said it's not the type of PVP you're talking about.
---
But let's face it, how often do fair fights happen in Eve? How many fights that you brand as "legitimate" do you lose? Or were they all "grr blobbing kiting overpowered imbalanced grr" fights?
---
All good mate. Fly safe
---
Adapt or die does not mean to adapt what you said after you got oofed ... meh politicians ...
---
Oh ye that sounds good. Im all for that change. It will perhaps last a week before they start bitching again but hey at this point Ill take even 1 day.
---
You could also argue that DED escalations are instanced dungeons, even though you can lose exclusive access to them if you aren't careful.
---
Big rework needed for a system that won't be marketable (won't be something new), isn't where the majority of players are, and isn't a big money maker.
---
You could take over some space and let people who want to mine do it and you can get content by trying to defend them. I'm in Goonswarm and I never once mined since I joined. I let whoever want to mine do just that and I do whatever I feel like doing.
---
For the support... Just translat: "It's a feature, not a bug!" into Korean and they're set.
---
And maybe the usual: "Yeah report received. Now fuck off." message as well. That should cover most needs.
---
If you haven't noticed - 20 years old students (butcher apprentices usually lack the brains) that quit EVE after their 1st job - that is literally the 100% matching description for nearly all good alliance level FCs this game has seen since 2003 ....
---
Dunno what you wanna tell me about .noir, met Alekseyev the 1st time in 2008, and be sure that he does not consider this game in a healthy place for content creators, its just us old dudes are very nostalgic ...
---
They aren't instanced though.
---
Because they don't exist in their own instance.
---
Those chars would not be unlimited, and people quit the game at some rate. My understanding is that this is what kept cap balance in check for some time.
---
Ultimately there needs to be balance so things are sustainable given the number of players, but injectors are a big problem.
---
I think Warp Core Stabs have a place in EVE eg for hauling etc but yes the downsides are too little. seeing a stabbed ishtar warping off is painfull. something like -100% on all outgoing damage types / -100% mining yield would be nice
---
well if you measure relevance per member I doubt your point, irrelevant lemming horde member #42356
---
Couldnt resist ey?:)
---
woosh
---
The subtle Brax dagger lol
---
Even worse is that now, especially after the cyno change, NS is safer than ever. Before the age of chaos nobody really took things like safety seriously, they used beacons without scouting, the didnt look at intel all that much and werent in standing fleets in the same way. They thought they were rather safe.
---
Now, most are quite ready most of the time and people are working together in a way they didnt before. So all of this shit has actually backfired.
---
you can go to lowsec and fight over moons there, they'll even be worth more money. 
---
Theres a couple moons that are free now that snuffed disbanded. Good luck!
---
&gt; I have several personal moons in hs 
---
If you moved your structures to lowsec, you could shoot them with your structures?
---
I love solo pvp but what you are describing is not it. you're just hunting people in belts or sites.
---
Solo pvp is 1 v 1 both with the same goal in mind. kill the other guy (or girl or whatever).
---
So I agree with your topic title. Solo PVP needs love. but not at all in the way you describe.
---
This is a big one that I didn't mention. Getting the new guys in a clear purpose/role is something I'd like to focus on. It makes sense.
---
I got the blood raiders to like one of my alts. Get repaired by rats now. Serves no real purpose but gotta have those goals for yourself
---
Bumping could be the best answer here. Gives you something active to do while you mine "your" roids.
---
The mechanic was specifically designed to allow others to mine at moons.
---
Are you sure your flair is accurate?  I'd have thought a proper hyper-capitalist Caldari would understand the benefits of a labor force that doesn't require paychecks / bathroom breaks / ammo / OSHA inspections /etc.
---
spodubrain spotted
---
If you're hurting on tank try looking at the Brutix, Brutix Navy, and Mach.  All have plenty of DPS and tank and can be as agile as you want.  Also provides you a good scale for how much you want to invest.
---
Where is the hyphen?
---
Well post some BRs, run some events, create a new third party application. Be the change you want to see instead of posting yet another low effort complaint post about all the complaints. You're just adding to what you consider to be the problem.
---
THAT'S INTELLIGIBLE
---
Big brain complaining about complaining
---
&gt; It simply doesnt happen.
---
Except when it does, which I have seen multiple times in Genesis. When you operate a ganking fleet in an area long enough, the locals that know how to avoid being ganked eventually get somewhat friendly with you. I've had several requests that I gank specific fleets because they are unwelcome at athanors.
---
&gt;  you can benefit from their mining bursts btw 
---
If they're willing to fleet with you to share bursts. 
---
&gt;  rock will just decay if not mined in time. 
---
If your rocks are decaying, you don't have the mining capacity to justify an athanor. It doesn't take a lot of barges to clear a small moon belt in a few hours.
---
Let me guess, you hunt them in a cloaky/nulli loki with webs that can reach out further than their point, and are surprised when no one bothers trying to bait/gatecamp you or anything. 
---
Especially after the vni nerf, having a pve ship that is capable of fighting back when tackled is nearly impossible, a bait myrmidon could probably do ok against solo/duo frigates, but there's nothing left that could ever catch a loki. Even a old VNI would have had to get really lucky to land a scram on one, and after the nerf there's nothing left capable of doing it. Dominix is tanky enough but too slow. Myrmidon is not tanky enough and is also too slow. Praxis is tanky but too slow. T1 vexor is fast enough, but not tanky enough. VNI won't work because its obvious bait, and will not get attacked except by blobs. Ishtar is actually ok, but is too expensive to use like that.
---
Pretty much this.  Or make it so that the resources from the moon have no practical use.  Only lowsec moons should have goo.
---
I guess we'll have to disagree on that. - It's not as if the entrance to a DED escalation is publicly accessible. People can't just wonder in there willy-nilly. The only way is if you let them scan you down while inside, or share the location with them.
---
If people aren't bitching, they're not happy.
---
delve is usually my go to. horde probably has the most but i don't go there cause it's actually too much traffic for my taste. other than that branch, banderlogs space (mordu npc in pure blind), providence, angel npc (tho there are camps). if you can do china time, you can easily get fights out of the locals in omist and even fade if you annoy them for 10 minutes, granted, not solos.
---
Otherwise known as... Not instanced...
---
Unlike abyssal sites.
---
Is there a market for officer mods?
---
I'm not even going to bother to take apart this "AAR" (doesn't even deserve the AAR title). If anyone is interested, they can read the short post our alliance leader Rixx made on it or ask me. Don't make AARs if you either weren't there or if you aren't going to present both sides? Hell, even non serious, fun AARs are not so full of mistakes and crap as this one.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As a short aside, we only had 3 combat caps active: my Nid, a Thanny and a Rorq. We had 2 other Rorqs there but the fits were incomplete and neither of them had drones. All other caps that died dropped from the dead fortizar and so were unpiloted.
---
So fit two points on your ceptor.  Then those botti bois won't get away.
---
"A portion of..."
---
Hey, let's play Eve together! &lt;a few hours later&gt; what do you mean you're getting bonuses? I'm not getting bonuses? wtf? My game is broken!
---
I know this is a test run to make sure their new NPE is working. I'm just pointing out that it shouldn't be a test for too long, as this WILL be someone's experience. Maybe they'll include a "we're trying a new NPE, give us feedback on any problems" so there's at least some indication that players are seeing something different.
---
Don't fly a loki if you don't know what you're doing. The reason they are so good is that, if you are careful you can basically pick your fights and disengage whenever you like, thanks to the long webs. But if you're new, you won't know when to disengage, and will spend the first hour being super risk averse and not doing anything, and then get bored and take a stupid risk because its better than being bored, and lose your ship
---
I'm just here to complain about the people complaining about complaining.
---
grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
From an immersion perspective, this would be ridiculous.  High sec belongs to the empires.  Rare moon materials would be appropriated by them.
---
The scenario you're describing, more incentive to "defend those systems", is false, because you can't effectively fight someone in high sec if they don't have any structures.  The simple act of NOT deploying any structures shoots holes on in this scenario.
---
No one currently maintains control over moons in hisec.  That's the whole point of this post.  If you pop a moon, and I come in with an Orca (exactly like described above), there's nothing effective or "legal" you could do to stop me from mining all your moon rocks if I have no structures in space.
---
If you're saying the entire system should be overhauled, beyond moon rarity and occurrence, you're describing a game that will never exist.  Mainly, because you're describing hisec as nullsec.
---
People don't claim space in null just to claim space in null.  Moons, belts, rats -&gt; money.
---
If you equalize the money in the game by making hisec payout as much as null, you've just ended null.  We saw this quite a bit when Incursions launched.  Individuals could make more isk in hisec than null all of a sudden.  So, anyone who didn't want to PvP really had no reason to leave hisec.
---
I believe you've missed the point of the game.  The rare things are in the hard places.  Hisec is for people who want to play Eve, but they think J-space, Null, and even lowsec are too much pressure.  People in hisec already have it insanely easy to make isk, the difference is the volume of isk they can make (on average in all aspects of hisec).  Making isk is easy there.  Making buttloads of isk in hisec is not as easy, and often times not worth the effort when you could go elsewhere and it's exponentially easier.
---
What you're describing is increasing the ability to make higher volumes of isk in hisec.  You're describing a scenario where people who can already make isk more easily than anywhere else will then be making volumes of isk on par with null (in the moon mining aspect), without the same amount of effort required.
---
Why would you think that's a good idea?  "Realism" as an argument for people hardwired to pods inserted into ships requiring no crew, wormholes, precursor races existing between "dimensions"...realism as an argument seems kinda trite.
---
Last I checked anything ratting below a battleship has to orbit so the rats don’t delete it
---
Hurray for micro transactions ruining the game
---
F
---
I failed no nut november
---
Tell us how you really feel buddy.
---
&gt;I listed you 7 ways off the top of my head that I could counter gankers with basically the most minimal effort possible, yet it's an "unwinnable fight".
---
You think "avoid problem" is a counter. It is not. Neither is a BB or a scout.
---
&gt;This is also the mechanic that makes ganking rarely worth it unless the person being ganked is a complete idiot. There is no justification for hauling 400mil in a T1 hauler, 5bil in a DST, 750mil in an inty, etc...
---
So now its back to the victim being an "idiot" and that's the only reason.
---
You think known criminals should have more protection in HS than LS?
---
&gt;Just to sate my own curiosity, what is your main character's name?
---
Not happening.
---
You don't like POS, go kill them.
---
They cannot be built anymore, so the number of total POS in EvE will never be higher than now.
---
TBH, I'd just expand moon mining to all of Hisec, But only make it drop the main materials that would show in those systems anyway, Then delete the main Belts and Maybe Anoms, Let people just use those, If you can't get ore, Then you need to look elsewhere.
---
ACTUALLY in star citizen you can buy ships with ingame money..

“Higher priority things” -ccp
---
Gotta love people contradicting themselves in 2 paragraphs.
---
If you think virgin 20 year olds are the people leading eve, you need to experience more than 20 man frigate fleets.
---
Imagine thinking BBTB2 is in Horde.
---
&gt;CCP said this, not me. I was merely reiterating their point.
---
In support of your other incorrect claims. This claim was also false.
---
&gt;Yes but that is not what was said in the minutes, you're extrapolating to fit what you're trying to say.
---
-
---
&gt;The CSM in general were surprised at how stark the numbers were and noted it was clear **this mechanic** was having a **significant impact on player recruitment and retention**.
---
How dare you
---
I get caught by that one every time.
---
There are also several 'trick' ones with what I'll call 'shears', a sudden low drop followed by a sudden high rise.
---
I spend a lot of time closing and re-opening the window to avoid the risky ones.
---
Rr
---
m8 so many new skins coming.
---
I stick to frigate FW pvp and most of my builds are under 30m (frigate pvp mostly). I fund my pvp with a mixture of cashing in the LP I get from Faction Warfare and exploration on the side. 5-6 hours of exploration often gets me 300-500M Isk and then I’m good for a little while. The guys using 1b fits though I have no idea how they fund it. Could be a combination of many years of building up isk via market trading/industry/PI/ratting all at once. Dunno, I’m only a year into the game
---
Yay I'm a boomer. It's great to everything so easy I'm life. Go me.
---
I do them by looking at the entire curve detrending it if needed. Sometimes it is not completely obvious but still recognizable. for planets with many transits (often within those curve you described) you can take a high frequency grid and drag in 25 defrag to find the valley where the luminositiy drops :D Whats your precision rating? Mine is at 95% atm
---
Awesome! Make sure to come up and say hi and say you're the dude from Reddit. 😁
---
&gt;I have several personal moons in hs
---
i hope each of your stations is under different corp and they are named differently from each other, otherwise wrecking machine. and pirat are already on the way with a ransom note
---
It was always a pleasure to fly with Cryo in BGH as well as in Eagles. We will miss you Cryo, we will miss you.. o7
---
Bwahahahaah, I almost pissed myself laughing when I read this.
---
All I see is a twat complaining because there's a way to evade a PvP encounter, and is now looking for an easier way to force a fight without flying the correct ship or using the right fittings. There is a counter they're called Interdictors. Or are you too scared to fly in expensive ships solo, because you might lose them? And yes, there are counters to Interdictors as well, so you'll be complaining about that too!!!
---
Happened to me again last night.. Seems to be just Fortizars that do it.
---
Pretty sure it depends on who created the corp, not current CEO
---
Do you own the ihub?
---
I see you carbon, I see you
---
Oh okay, I didn't get that impression from what your responding to but I could definitely see people saying that. If it was limited to inside the site itself I guess it could be okay, but it would just make them more lucrative targets for ganking (not that I think it would push them over any thresholds).
---
so you telling me maybe one of biggest rmt corps in the game that has been even failed the pity standards of frat and ranger regiment, is now working with RA and taking sov from winter co's ashes?
