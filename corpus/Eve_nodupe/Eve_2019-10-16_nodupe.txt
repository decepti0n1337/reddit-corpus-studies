Sometimes it evaluates wrong, counting good negatives as bad, e.g. cycle time of a rep or even misreading ESI at all.

---
If drifter wormholes did not exist, nobody would be complaining about the command destroyers in the stuka/goku fleets. The frustration with them relies entirely on the fact that you can't prepare to deal with the fleet in a meaningful way. 
---
Not many people complain about boosh Rohks/Ravens because they are an extremely difficult fleet to fly and come from a clear nearby staging that can be scouted. You see them, you get your 15-30 man tackle wing and force them to burn through booshers until they get out of position. You prep some long-range dreads or something.
---
Booshers in small gangs, as pick-off tools in large fights, all of those are interesting mechanics for pvp. 
---
The problem comes with the fact that the booshers aid with making a fleet that can't be reliably scouted and prepared for an incredibly low-risk doctrine. Against 150 bombers, kikis, and retris you have to flash-form 70-80 dudes to reliably beat them because raw capitals and smaller gangs of hard counters that don't work. And once you go through all this effort to flash form the 80 dudes, the enemy FC just has his CDs boosh off and they go home, a destination that is 5-10 minutes away tops and your tackle caught maybe a few ships worth 70-90m each. That's incredibly frustrating.
---
If Goku/Stuka fleets had to actually form from a staging a reasonable distance away or could only use the rare wormhole chain that is far easier to scout or roll than a drifter hole, they would be rare enough that nobody would seriously complain, or you would be able to form a counter.
---
Disenchant...need the mats!
---
Where do you move up from if you run C6s with dreads though?
---
I have 11 plexed accounts, 10 of these support 3 characters with multi training SP farms. The 10 accounts generate essentially isk flat (-50m) prior to me doing anything (anything besides injectors) on the accounts.  So if I spend about 20 minutes playing on any of the accounts I'm isk positive for maintaining them all. 
---
On my 10 alt accounts all have 1 character rorqual perfect (or near it), 1 character either dread (3 are also titans) or fax perfect and 1 character that is a useless sp farm.
---
My non alt account has my my subcap pilot (not quite perfect) also is a perfect JF pilot, a rorqual (mediocre also not active skill queue), and my industry alt.
---
So essentially before I play the game each month, I lose 50m to have 11 accounts with 32 training queues. I usually bring in about between 30 and 40b profit a month.
---
Nice kill! Was so waiting for the super blob after the marshal came in :D

Factually incorrect  
---
Gotg and pamfam were aligned together after WWB from PB to Tribute, with NC Renters having malpais and a long standing NIP with Drones (who only cared about krabing and never went on offensive anywhere, except for internal conflict between themselves/other rus) #'s wise they were numerically inferior 
---
here's a map at the time this happened (IIRC I think it was this time) with most entitys being blue to neighbour but thats it
---
 [https://www.verite.space/maps/influence/20170305.png](https://www.verite.space/maps/influence/20170305.png)   
---
Compare that to current politics, Red being Taperium Guardians of the PBIC, Green being Pandafam (also that WC is just TCU with tapi ihubs)
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/Kkgtrto.png](https://i.imgur.com/Kkgtrto.png)   
---
so to recap  
---
in the past it was Pamfam (3 alliances) with gotg, with a long standing NIP with Drones   
---
pamfam was numerically inferior to most others in the south  
---
now the red is the sphere of influence of the rest of the games coallitions together, even though most coallitions have more numbers than pamfam on their own  
---

Thank you for the positive comment.

I've watched you doing nothing but watching him for 6 hours now and I'm pretty sure you're a bot

Kool bye have a good one
---
The thing is noone makes a video where He gets handed his arse when He encounters an experient pilot.
---
Except that a Marshall is a cyno ship now, he just didn't have one fitted xd
---
50gj neut would've taken awhile :p
---
You can hear it on our comms to yeah, we were all expecting it haha
---
Extra layer means, we have. 2 factor authentication when using cards. In person and online.
---
Who OP gets his “arse handed to him”? An experienced pilot would just warp down cyno and jump supers in hardly have to be skilful at all to do that.
---
Emerging conduits might be fun for you.
---
They are trig sites even in high sec that you can do solo in a well enough ship.
---
The damage is insane 600dps+ or so, so be carefull. There are some fits on eveworkbench, see what you like, and be carefull. Salvaging + loot is very lucrative.
---
Can someone explain to me (a noob) what happened?
---
Can you talk to CCP and ask them to make Trig ships 0.5 AU slower than other ships in their class.              
---
Trig ships are very unbalanced at the moment - they are fun to play and all things consider they excel on everything.          
---
**Making them warp bit slower could be a very interesting downside in using those ships**          
---
After all Triglavians don't need fast warp speeds in their ships.
---
We are the SISI now!
---
Well someone finally opened this suggestion (mail)box
---
Start using cruisers.
---
I know it, you know it, damn even CCP know it - but it does not mean that whole reddit have to hear it.
---
I'm actually not a player who looks for reasons for salt.
---
I love eve. I've been playing since 2004.
---
Blackout was good yes because it really mixed things up where it needed mixing. It caused chaos.
---
This is not doing that. This is bringing convenience to everyone. Making warp speeds faster and autopilots more effective. Yeah that's for sure aimed at mobilising and not auto thru high sec easier.
---
If it caused chaos. I'd be behind it. If it made things more interesting or changed a mechanic in an interesting way. Sure.
---
Let's all rejoice for the chaos this has brought us.... Please.
---
Is this just a goon thing or do other alliances do that?
---
 When I played a few years ago nobody would care that much about PVE fits, beyond laughing at killmails if they got ganked.
---
https://zkillboard.com/system/30004764
---
Thats true!
---
the only one not max rolled is the only one your really want lol
---
That is what is destroying the game for aspiring pilots like you
---
How I pictured it happened:
---
Monday hilmar transmitted to the team that the PA review is coming up and positivity among the player base wouldn't hurt at all. 
---
Tuesday this change made it to tranq.
---
Didn't this Corp got shit a few years ago for publicly selling dreads in npc delve?
---
To leave you must only answer one question. Why did you unsub?
---
The only one I know of I think is coalition hispanica or something like that, their in Providence. all spanish I think, maybe one of them will pop into the thread for you.
---
Please institute a rule for Thursday that you aren't getting the taco anom to respawn before you eat all the chips and salsa and so those must be finished first.
---
More importantly you gotta keep PVP content away from other people that visit your space, otherwise they might come back.
---
Hmmm, that doesn't SOUND like something we'd do... I'll look into it, see if we can get it resolved.
---
No, sorry. You must not remember Killah wanting a new PC.
---
With fully vertically integrated t2 production + skillgooing some each account easily pays for itself.
---
You mean by making a cruiser warp faster than an Assault Frigate?
---
This wins the thread
---
Do energy neutralizers work on NPC ships?
---
Seriously you're not going to sub for 250kk SP.  Do you think people unsubbed  because of SP?
---
No, there are bigger wider problems that need to be fixed.  Solve those and make the game much better that will make people sub.
---
Might have? Coincided? And why did we need deflation?
---
Heres what happened, CCP almost killed the game. People dont really realise how bad this actually was because they are only using anecdotal evidence to support their viewpoints.
---
Look at the market, its slow as fk atm, just look at velocity of isk. I have never seen the wheels moving so slowly which tells me that we have lost a shitton of players and/or people have just gone into lockdown mode refusing to do anything. Jita has never been this bad and sometimes I get the feeling that the game genuinly died during the blackout. Im hoping this is not the case and people will come back but this was the dumbest thing CCP has ever pulled.
---
And fyi, deflation is pretty much always bad. It means something really bad happened. As long as you have inflation its a signal that there is hope for the future and a belief in the system. Its can failscade quite quickly from there.
---
In the US that security is for the bank, not for yourself. You aren't liable for purchases you didn't make, no matter how negligent you were with your payment details.
---
That's part of the difference. From what I've heard, most of the rest of the world has highly inconvenient security, and way worse protections in the event of fraud.
---
I'm not really sure what the point of this post was people leave and return all the time.
---
You should really try to expand your play experience by trying something new if you only did the same thing the entire time. Otherwise you're really only seeing a small niche of the game.
---
Goons are so bored they have to kill their own ships for fun
---
Veterans with hundred of millions of SP? They dont give a damn.
---
But lets remember that CCP wants to focus on newplayer retention and 500k SP is alot if you are new and dont have many SP. Like finally getting the covert ops cloaking, that you couldnt fit into your training list before or finishing the dirty fitting skills. 3 years ago, i would have killed for an event like that.
---
ou CCP, they must be totally desperate. not only is daily sp there but now bonus week lol

point still stands...

Dude it's not even meant to work like that.   
---
Plexing with isk is for people that have a lot of time on their hands and want to play the game for that time. That usually includes oligarchs, lottery winners and more commonly neets and students. It also includes a very limited number of people that have built enough infrastructure/stockpile over the years that they cruise on that - alliance higher-ups, people with high sp characters etc. These things need time though so they kinda all fall under the same category, tbh.   
---
The next stage is when you pay subscription and use your in-game time to fund your habits - profit is less of a life-and-death issue and more of a challenge.   
---
Last one is where you pay the subscription and also pay for plex so you can sell it to the stage 1 people. This is of course more costly but allegedly you use all that time not playing eve to make more plex-value than you would do playing eve. Minimum us wage afaik gives you like 1 plex/hour so idk, that's a pretty good tick.
---
How is a new character going to fly a ceptor is my point? It's at least frigate V and evasive manouvers V. That's like 20+ days, I had better things to train when I was new

Yeah I'm thinking about max dps for my own sake so I don't get surprised because my tank does not hold long enough.

I'm sitting at 64mil ehp with my Hel and pushing. Normal Goon doctrin not even that much blinged, just Command Bursts and skills at 5.

Thank you CCP!! I am loving all this free sp
---
You can send your stuff to Jason OPhee
---
honestly, even with more SP (I just crossed the 100M SP mark), event like this one are nice. mainly because Skill Injectors are useless after 50M or 80M SP
---
There's... there's no shit in this post?  There's no shit in this post.
---
Blackout-
---
What people wanted: Local blackout and changes to the game that would allow for CCP to introduce new gameplay mechanics, structures and mods to place intel as a ttoe of gameplay mechanic.
---
What we got: CCP cancelled the AWS chat server contract for null sec. Did nothing else. Playerbase realises that Blackout on its own without any other gameplay changes was purely unfun to play in unless you were a pvp hunter.
---
Cyno Changes:
---
What people wanted: A balanced approach to nerfing the ability of Alliances to drop 100 caps on a 5 man corvette roam. Sonething that would give restrictions on how a cyno could be used but would also ensure that cynos were not made into another unusable module.
---
What we got: A 400 million+ loss mail per cyno.
---
3 minute warp off timer:
---
What we wanted: Only High sec Freighter pilots wanted this.
---
What we got: Exactly what the High Sec freighter pilots wanted. A way to evade Burn Jita gate bumpers.
---
Finally, Crusier to Battleship warp speed increases.
---
What we wanted: An increase to cruiser, battlecruiser and battleship hull warp speeds.
---
What we got: An increase to cruiser, battlecruiser and battleship hull warp speeds. Finally the most common complaint from Eve 2008 has been fixed. Cant wait for the fix for issues from the Quantum Rise update to hit SiSi next month.
---
Urgh... again... Alright you win CCP. I'll login tonight.
---
bruh
---
Well I wouldn't say that releasing the change live, with no patch notes, no announcements ahead of time, no pre-testing on sisi, and no player feedback before releasing the change is the correct way to do anything.
---
yes
---
I see lots of great advice but I don't see anyone explaining mechanics on why to use said advice. So let me explain.
---
When you warp to station (or anywhere) the game draws a vector from you to the station. The point where it hits the station model at 0 it centers a 5km diameter sphere. You will land somewhere on that sphere. That's why when you warp in fleet you 'ball up'. Docking range is &lt;500m so there's a significant chance you land outside of docking range even warping to 0. Gankers can fit to instalock you to exploit this window of vulnerability. 
---
Remove the window by using bookmarks as others have suggested. Use ships with more ehp to make it harder for banks to occur. There's many avenues to protect yourself but knowing mechanics is step 1 so kudos to you for asking!
---
By "pushing", I meant more as in making wars more interesting. Introducing resource depletion, changing citadel timers, etc.
---
Weekly reminder that the vast majority of gankers are extremely terrible at the game.
---
I agree with you.
---
Got it, thanks, just read about that "retroactively" thingie...
---
Fountain is the Wild Wild West of EVE.
---
Wow you’re a wonderful person. You’re like a cup of sunshine. An exemplary example of what we should all strive to be. 
---
Go fuck yourself!
---
I might give it a go, depends what the transatlantic WiFi costs are
---
I think the magic 14 should be much faster to train up. Waiting that long sucks for new players and most of those skills don’t necessarily directly open you up to new shiny ships is a big turn off for new players.
---
Yeah. sometimes you just outgrow the rebellious phase.
---
Can confirm, he's done it to us at least twice
---
So an expensive platform that is now boring as all fuck to play.
---
No drugs kids please.
---
Not necessary. Just use the 'D' key (hold it down) and click on the 4-4 station multiple times while still in warp.
---
I'm not sure about it.
---
that influx of SP into the game will crash the price of skill injectors but there is a conexion between plex and injectors price
---
Well same here, but still better than most of the changes so far.
---
Ship maintenance bay could/should be used that way. Literally, as it is right now.
---
NCdot PLUS PL at NO point in EVE History even closely matched just Goonswarms numbers. And it is not PanFams fault that some people in Goon Lead had to secure their living as they have learned from their old teachers/sponsors in old NC instead of doing what PanFam did, donate the moons to members so they get big toys. It was nothing rooted in game meta or something like that that Goons "lost" at that time.
---
+ 1.25x tracking on gleam, but to be fair you could go for Dark Blood Multi and get a bit more dps i think
---
Is there a wowhead.com equivalent in Eve? I've been reading through the UniWiki but most every article has a note that it's out of date and no longer maintained.
---
In-game studying modules with a combination of the Info window and the Market window just doesn't get me far enough.
---
As a group of very casual players, we greatly appreciate the skill injectors. Most of us have sub 15 mil so even after ten ish years of on again off again. Just recently we learned what the fuck we were doing so most of our skills are a complete mess. The free skill points make it very nice getting back into the game without having to wait months to get some essential skills we didn't care/know about. (Like shield manipulation oops)
---
Interestingly, this comes JUUUSST as the 3-months of MPTC with 3-month subscription promotion they ran 3 months ago ran out.
---
I feel like they could have some EVE-clients setup at Vegas just for this event.
---
I guess I always played it with a different mindset back then. We usually liked having reds rolling through our systems because it meant people didn't need to go 15 jumps for PvP. 
---
It makes sense from that perspective. I guess the culture of Eve has changed so much from when I was really active that I don't recognise it anymore. Several years ago people would be laughed out of an alliance for going around scanning their own miners and ratters.
---
DE THAT BITCH
---
it's the 1337 smolscale deadwood, he never makes sense
---
For PVE?  You're talking to the wrong guy!  But for pure alpha look for damage bonus to the hull, iirc this gets  ROF which only influences DPS.
---
They devalue ingame ISK earning that is not multibox-minmaxxed. The fact that you even consider buying a titan with cash just shows how worthless ISK are versus PLEX/Cash.
---
&gt; An account that has omega status for a short amount of time, obviously.
---
People who resub their 100m+ sp characters will be happy, then.
---
Did i stutter? Every person who could fly a cap but doesn't because of this change is a good thing. They just need to keep up the assault on caps until they are brought in line with the balance of the rest of the game not orders of magnitude stronger.
---
Cost is not a good balancing factor but will work as a stopgap while they finish a real solution.
---
Okay this is honestly laughable. There's no helping you at this point. I'm not going to waste more of my time in this thread. 😂
---
We had to save that dumbass like 3 times in 2 weeks, and all his rorqs are shitfit.

---
I wonder what parts of fleet-up were the most popular? Anyone gave something they are really going to miss?
---
retarded idea, remove the stupid attribute system instead
---
Skill farms aren't really a thing anymore. You will barely break even with them.
---
You need to train Reading Comprehension I....
---
\&gt;   or the extract limit on one of the character on the account 
---
100m SP account have 1 or more characters above the extract limit.

I don't really understand programmers who feel their project needs to die with them.
---
UniWiki is 95% accurate
---
I would like that a lot, maybe remove faxes and have carriers become a repair/support platform again so that they can have something to do after jumping in.  This would remind me of Homeworld carriers.

go spend years of your life creating something from scratch and then have a bunch of losers on reddit tell you that you should just give it away because the other guy did
---
A marshal neuted out by frigs eh
---
Pearl Abyss is sold to EA.
---
Back when Supercarriers were Motherships they used to be able to fit a Clone Vat Bay.   You could install a jumpclone in the Mothership and drop your ships in the ship hanger.   The Mothership would jump to a cyno and you could jump clone to the Mothership.  Eject your ship, than board it.    
---
They were also pretty decent remote rep platforms so played the fleet support role pretty well.  
---
Granted the whole jump-clone -&gt; eject -&gt; board bit wasn't really plausible in combat, but it was a thing.
---
If you're already subbed at the start can you claim both from the get go?
---
He means alpha clone.
---
Check the abaddon,  dont know if its alpha or not. When I hi-sec carebeared and before marauders it was in the abaddon.
---
Timer board and fleet tracking tools were helpful for small orgs.
---
Any chance this is a DigitalOcean droplet? If you want to transfer ownership to me, I'm happy to keep it running and cover the costs. I still think Fleet-Up provides an indispensable service and I'd love to contribute to keeping it running.
---
Structure timers are changed to 24 hour vulnerability / 12 hour / 6 hour and the timers are instant / next day / random 1-3 days.
---
Asset safety drops to 50 % and the other 50 % is loot fairied.
---
If they removed that and F1 monkey fleets still operated well.. how would the wormholers be able to smug post on reddit?
---
Thanks for all you did --  this was an invaluable tool and will be deeply missed.
---
So stop asking for donations and flat out charge a fee to use it if people want it.
---
Yes.
---
Sure, facts are laughable.

Yet, here you are, somehow being smarter than the banks of the worlds second largest economy.

Ya.. if your getting 1500 before heat lol... Please tell me how.  Mine are 900-1100 depending on covops lvl 4-5 think even with drugs and and your not quite 1500, maybe with bling and implants... Idk
---
I don't disagree that free SP is great for newbro's, I am arguing that this event isn't AIMED at newbros. If it were vets would get a diminished rate of SP, or the drops would be super accelerators that only pilots under a certain SP could activate.
---
In actuallity raw SP is fantastic for vets and those that are highly skilled, it is these people they are targeting with these """""events"""" imo for quaterly login metrics. Going for a carrier/super on supcap main and dont want to remap for JDC5? Free SP and insta inject (aslong as you login). Links skills and dont want to remap? Free SP and insta inject (aslong as you login). Want to get into whatever broken ship CCP releases in the future ASAP? Save the SP and get into them minute 1 *(aslong as you login) etc.
---
I wholeheartedly agree that things that decrease the initial SP grind for new players is probably a good thing. But multiple millions at this point of SP are being given no strings to vets aswell the "its for the newbros" argument rings hollow for me.
---
StainGuy banned from posting on /r/eve
---
Than everyone must have a bookmark or has to wait for a warp in on a combat probed target for example.
---
There are 3(?) different levels of incursions.  The highest is headquarters, second highest is Vanguard sites and can be completed with as few as 10 bling pirate faction battleships (it would be interesting how a vedmak fleet would do in them).  Payouts are lower but the isk is not bad for smaller groups and they are available in highsec.
---
&gt; He means alpha clone
---
Ah, read it the other way.  But yeah, pulse 'baddon.
---
We improvise and adapt. We can ALWAYS smug post.
---
go spend years of your life on a project only to execute it because your ego won't let you relinquish control so it doesn't have to die with your interest in it.
---
Well, for first, it was just something that came up with corpies last night, and after giving it some thought, kinda seemed rational. This is a discussion forum, full of rage and qutting vets, sure, but still open.
---
And after all, if you are playing the game, wouldnt it be nice if you have to be there and interact to play it? Not just being taken from A to B by someone else? That was my opinion. I see you don't agree. You'd rather have a herd of npc bots shooting for you, then i would recommend any rts out there that you can micromanage your units.
---
Ps: next time, just answer the right way and we can avoid this whole thing.

EVE: Vegas stays in Vegas and not San Diego...
---
The fleetup discord bot was handy
---
Itd be worse, so much worse
---
Did you forget everything else that a sub comes with, my guy?
---
The fact that you just want someone to hand you a fit, including being too lazy to even look at the market to figure out what a tachyon could possibly mean.
---
Roll back the citadel expansion and bring back passive moon mining.  Bring POSes back, but with good code.
---
Aha. Sounds like it's all for the number of people login daily. Pearl Abyss will be pleased.
---
Sounds good. Any fit available?
---
Make probe results broadcastable so people can warp to it manually.
---
Brawling T2 Anticapital Guns get up to that level. usually you have T1s because you expect the Dread to die (not be extracted) to the umbrella.
---
Naglfar have about 10-11k dps if you're really low skilled, those Dreads are your usual hotdropper because you can fit max dps without ditching tank. Application is a non issue vs Supercapitals.
---
Super blinged Naglfars can get up to 15k dps with implants and drugs etc. Its not feasable to field them tho but you sometimes still see killmails like those kreeping this reddit / zkillboard etc.
---
If you fly Armor Dreads and don't intent to hotdrop / "suicidegank" you can't reach those numbers.
---
But shit like those (at least) 12k dps+ Dreads are stationed around Delve in NPC null space and lowsec ready to undock. Its a problem but you need to take it into consideration if you plan on ratting close to NPC null.
---
Your Revelation won't ofc deal as much damage as a Naglfar because you most likely don't fit 4x (5x?) dps application mods into lows.
---
64mil ehp Hel is heated with most 5 skills, 6% imps, phenomenon and mindlink booster +25% implant, you can get up to 80mil if you refit DDA for caldari navy power diagnostic and even more if you get officer modules. Use pyfa and sim for yourself! =)
---
As someone who dual boxes tackle and dps, no. It's fun to sling a stiletto to combat probe results.
---
Tbh go full chaos and remove the ability to approach, orbit or keep range all ships. Now everyone everywhere has to manually pilot :D
---
But he created it. He can do as he pleases. Don't be bitter because someone won't give their hard work to you for free.
---
Fly away, high, fast and safe Wack!
---
Definitely joining a Corp helps.
---
And if it isn’t because of money, I think Omega is great because of double speed training. You can train a long list while you’re busy with the baby and the few times you get free you’ll be trained up on a bunch of stuff.
---
I also agree that Trig is very annoying for new people.
---
can
---
Thats why its currently a sport in delve to blast retards before our enemies are able to, sadly we cant get everyone ourself.
---
Didnt they already nerf trig loot?
---
At this point, EVE 2 or transition to EVE 2 is probably what I'd like the most
---
Hilmar is evil. What he did to the guy who actually programmed the original eve code is horrible. The fact that he wasted so much money on walking in stations
---
 Never released the vampire game. Spent way too much money on games like dust and the vr game. Honestly i dont know how any other incompetent moron could still be running the show.
---
Oh I understand.  Vanguard sites are very approachable by small groups of lower SP pilots.  I would argue that is who they are intended for.
---
I could see a limited reinforcement mechanic just so structures can't be sniped over an oversight in fueling. Maybe just like give them a 24 hour reinforcement timer so the owner can go "oh shit" and do something about it. But they definitely shouldn't have tether.
---
I agree with most points but the ship for 
---
&gt;1/3 or more of Null sec is removed or null sec systems dry up the more they are farmed to force larger nullblocks to fight for resources.
---
has kind of sailed. It wouldn't really be a fight, would it? It would just be everyone running from goons in a circular motion around the map. God protect the logistics guys that have to organise that lmao
---
Better yet, to Activision-Blizzard
---
This was the only time I actually bought Omega membership. I'm a new bro for sure. I don't know what I'm doing but after spending hours upon hours of researching guides and whatever all I know is that the skills are one of the most important things I could do for myself. As a new player I spend most of my time doing small missions and chatting with people in the client. But most of the time I'm usually docked. The beginner missions are underwhelming and not really engaging. I don't know how ccp is going to make this game appealing for new players but I'd love to see it happen.
---
Would be cool if i could change mods on ship while tethered
---
To get rejected from horde is quite an accomplishment.
---
Ya, I'm not seeing anything like that. With the T2 Command Bursts, highest-level Officer Invulns, CONCORD extenders (2), CONCORD plates (2), Officer EANM (2), officer DC, T2 CDFE, and all the implants on the planet...all overheated the Hel sits at 31.3m EHP.
---
no
---
Eve Vegas 2020 is still happening it just means that CCP wont be putting it together
---
A roadmap.
---
I don't really care about what CCP does or want to do because people agreeing or not isn't going to change anything. What I want is a roadmap to the game. One of the biggest problem currently is the lack of forward vision to what the game will be or might become. 
---
Currently we don't know what CCP wants with the game (except selling more skins I think that by now we all understood that). The thing is, people that have long training queues don't really know what is to come, I currently have a 6 month skill queue, and maybe until I reach the end it will be obsolete depending on Hilmar's latest brainfart.
---
Never said otherwise
---
I would like to know what happens to the people who have paid for the service in advance. Because now this is like "Bye!" and after some days, the service will be gone.
---
The second and third timers have a vunerabililty period if the structure has a fueled service, referred to as "full power".  If the structure has no online, fueled service, which is called "low power", there is just one timer and that is one week from when the shields are successfully attacked (low power structures skip the armor timer).
---
Could be sold to Blizzard tbh.
---
For me it's the fact that it's the only convenient way store fits online, such that they can be grouped into doctrines and browsed easily. The only alternatives are forums or google docs I guess, and I don't want to have to keep a forum hosted just to store fits on it.
---
„So we heard the eve account of Reddit User monol0g can‘t afford playtime...so we give it to him for free for a year “ and everyone will celebrate and I’ll be happy

---
I guess we can't all be as amazing as you :)
---
oh yeah, those are pure cancer.
---
it's bad enough you can only get it with irl money, then it's an undisclosed amount of irl money because it's random if you'll get it or not on each payment is just beyond predatory.
---
That would be a fifth of that 30k concurrent peak previously mentioned. That's a big chunk.
---
Yes, by pure membership. Only a fraction of those are actually online at the same time
---
Walking in Stations.
---
I agree
---
But I don't CCP will ever have the balls to remove titan and super docking.
---
And holy shit can you imagine all the whining and complaining from everyone who bought a super after 2016 lmao
---
Yeah, granted. I was just working within the terms of your hypothetical statement.
---
Sold to Tencent.

---
Shitty calculator but wanted to provide proof.
---
People who say “I was kicked/banned for no reason” have a reason 99% of the time...
---
Also, trying to contact an alliance CEO over a recruitment issue never goes anywhere.
---
Lol, I have a Hel, Nyx and Avatar amigo. I believe you.
---
As a new player I think the most important thing to look for in a corp is activity. You can check zkill to see how many players a corp has and generally how active they are. There’s a little graph on the right side of the page that also shows what time they’re active so you can see if that matches up with when you play. You can check r/evejobs to see who’s recruiting, or post an ad for yourself and see who wants to recruit you. 
---
I don’t necessarily agree with pushing all newbros straight out into nullsec and into the large alliances, but there’s something to be said for Horde, Goons, Brave, TEST, etc. They’re very newbro friendly, do a little bit of everything, always have people on comms in standing fleet that can help, and have regular fleets that you can participate in.
---
Like everything in Eve, don’t let not knowing how to do something stop you from trying it. If you try something out and it backfires, it was still better than not trying at all. Even joining and leaving corps because they ended up not being a good fit for you.
---
I hope its bigger than CCP's show at the same time to illustrate how dumb of an idea that was
---
Well, as I said, since only a few of them are ever online at the same time, it wouldn't even make a noticable dent in concurrent player count
---
I'd pay full price for a good EVExStellaris mod
---
&gt;What he did to the guy who actually programmed the original eve code is horrible
---
story time?
---
Even setting up with all of the highest officer mods I could find I couldn't get higher than like 49.5m, and my resists are nowhere close to yours. My Kinetic and Explosive are the same, but I'm nowhere close in EM and Therm.
---
This is with 2xInvuln, 2xExtender, EM+Therm Amps, and a Cap booster in the mid.
---
Shield slave
---
Also buff Wyvern
---
I guess. You'd probably know better than me, bro.
---
Ish, in that the company doesn't owe the player anything for the 20$. That's the thing with digital game currency. You are buying essentially othing, you are owed nothing and you don't really have a lot of rights about what you got, as long as it was what they advertised.
---
Now obviously if you're a shit game company about the whole thing and treat the paying customers poorly, they'll stop coming. 
---
But whether or not PLEX is bought off the market doesn't make any difference to CCP's obligations, only insofar as I'm sure that a stagnating or hyperinflated market isn't good for the health of the game itself.
---
Spagheti code
---
Ccp hire this guy
---
random roaming trig npcs are the worst addition to highsec. we need a safe spot for carebears to get developed in EVE.
---
Do you find that your buy orders are still priced low enough with other players lowering their buy order prices?
---
oh ffs - I chose a shitty time to go away on a 3 day weekend with no laptop...
---
idk from that article it sounds like the guy had a breakdown.  You can't exactly have a person disconnected from reality running a company in it's infancy.  As most things are it probably could have been handled better but without knowing the full details it's hard to say.
---
&gt;It was and remains the reason why so much core code is bonked as there were and still are notes that say if this is broken ask him.
---
That's also a sign of a really shit developer
---
Hope Yas like :)
---
Both times?
---
Go drink a whiteclaw you crazy 😜
---
I welcome this Bulshevic on Bulshevic crime wave.  Trash cleaning up trash.
---
i would take to the other station at 4 and move it in tanker ships if it was real value
---
I don't expect anything meaningful so I won't be disappointed.
---
Eve gate opens back up
---
This was like the most stable seddows comms have ever been lol
---
Dual web breachers are absolute beasts! Probably the strongest t1 frig in the novice meta. As you demonstrate in the video, range control is just so very important, and the breacher can fit good dps and tank along with essentially perfect range control.
---
The number one reason people give up trading is because they try to turn a passive activity into an active one. 
---
Trading is a passive activity. 10 mins every 4-5 hours is just slightly less ISK/Hr than 10 mins every hour. 
---
It prints ISK and, most importantly, frees up your time to do whatever else you want.
---
That Eve Echoes was just a cover story for a legit mobile game client and that they are going to market the shit out of it to fill the game up with new players.
---
Note that I'm currently an alpha clone. Haven't really decided on the omega yet.
---
Rough translation: Nerf everyone other than my l33t small gang.
---
That’s fine for the purpose of getting some information and figuring out your options. 
---
But I highly recommend if you want to play Eve, and specifically trade, just pay $15 a month and get a subscription.
---
Oh my, forgot about those stuff. Also finally someone that knows the secret of Bay Loading Accelerators :3
---
Thanks for the advice. I had no idea.
---
Would that be the case if I knew right away I was being attacked? I would have the screen up and audio on so I would know if I was being webbed or attacked. Is it too late by then?
---
What is "Delve"?
---
Sorry can’t find both of them. Was back in march with guri BCU’s.
---
Project Nova!!!!

Tiericide

You need to have enough tank to survive what might gank you, and recognize if you will be a target. If you are in a small ship with no tank, and carrying more then 10-15m then a thrasher might pop you as their killboard will be ISK positive. Same thing goes for small-med ships. Say you are in an Iteron IV, you are carrying 120m worth of stuff. An arty tornado gank setup costs about 75m ish. You will be a target. so at this point you need to be able to survive a volley from one tornado. But wait there is more, if you tank out your Iteron IV, and your carrying more then 150m worth then two tornado gankers might consider you a target. You start realizing that if someone wants to get you they can, you could get smart bombed at the gate. Insta dock, and insta undock bookmarks and having a good tank are crucial. I highly suggest you make a gank alt and play around on the test server to see what can get caught and popped easily and what doesn't.
---
Check out the mew Triglavian ships for LS!! They're awesome for small gang and LS generally.
---
Maybe something for your free SP... 😄
---
Nah.
---
Imo carriers should be the best subcap Vs small targets. Hell the purpose of their siege module is to be able to lock things before their fighters are all dead.
---
Carriers being able to be defanged easier makes them pointless. You'd just bring dreads instead.
---
That was a great video to watch. Simple, well-commentated, and fun. Thanks for the share man!
---
How much did sort pay you for that?
---
The security blog would like to show you some numbers of botters removed... 😉
---
Someone needs to volunteer to show this guy the game.  This question makes no sense and you guys know better.  He's just a curious noob
---
I mean it did also give us rorqs which was kind of terrible
---
Connection from the laptop to the display (usually in one of the hinges, it's a veeery thin and feeble cable).
---
Might also be a cold start to the laptop, try warming it up a bit before entering EVE.
---
I haven’t had the problem on anything except EVE and I’ll try that thabks
---
Peasants trained and rolling into town with Abrams battle tanks
---
Where the largest group in the game lives. They make it incredibly safe by bringing overwhelming, unstoppable force and then complain noone wants to fight.
---
Inability to avoid getting farmed if he does.
---
99/100, yeah you are just dead.
---
You're incorrectly assuming everyone injects everything.
---
As a player who doesn't inject like a maniac to get where he is, I got my first carrier around the start of this year. It took me fucking years to get there, and ages to get to the point when I had a couple of bil isk to spare to drop on it after plexing and buying the carrier skill etc.
---
Maybe you've reached the point where a bil is nothing, but I haven't, and nor have many players. The 20bil for a fitted super is a long way away from me.
---
CCP reveal themselves to have been the other CCP all along.
