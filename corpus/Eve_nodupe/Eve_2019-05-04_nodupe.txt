There are a few main "break points" that'll happen. One is that the skill injector market will tank (relatively) as lots of people start extracting their chars every month to cover plex costs. (This won't have a huge impact on plex prices other than driving out farmers; since extractors cost plex too, the only reduction in plex consumption is from dedicated farm accounts shutting down. You already see this to a significant degree, as extractors are now 50% of the cost of plex, and many farms are shut down; but it could get a lot worse. Imagine a 1.5b extractor for a 1.8b injector.) 
---

---
Following a crash in the value of extracted SP (leaving it still very expensive to run an account even if you're farming it for sp every month; like if you could only make back 1.5b on extraction, but 500 plex is 4b) you'll see a lot of PvE chars and alts get mothballed, because spending &gt;2b a month in order to keep them running-but-not-training-skills isn't worth it. There'll also be a spike in alpha clone usage for things like eyes chars that don't really need to be omega. 
---
Even if plex moves to 4b and titans to 35b, it may not have a huge impact on adoption. The reason for this is because the main cost of a new titan is still in the character, and with plex at 4b, new chars will be incredibly expensive (injected or bought from the char bazaar). In fact, the price of chars more or less directly tracks the price of plex, so there's a good chance the dollar-price of a new titan pilot won't go down significantly; it'll still cost you "about 2 years of plex, since that's how long it takes to train." 
---
Throughout all of this, some people will fully unsub (instead of just ditching ratting alts). There'll also be pressure on small-time content creators who rely on things like a 3-account fc/scout/cyno setup to generate content. **It's hard to tell how many people will actually unsub,** since a lot of plex users can switch out to paying 1-2 account subs, or just rat a bit more. But some people can't make more isk in-game (especially not 2 or 3 times as much isk, when things get really bad) and can't pay a sub because they live in a country where $20 is a huge amount of money. The squeeze will get worse and worse on people who can't adjust their playstyle to compensate, and a lot will be squeezed out. 
---
CCP might go out of their way to mitigate this by, say, bringing back regional pricing (so a sub costs less if you buy it in Venezuela) or beefing up one-character iskmaking options (nerf rorqs, nerf VNIs, buff abyssal sites). They also might exacerbate it by ramrodding plex prices over and over to help their profit margins.

overall i just don't get what value there is to a booshing triglavian ship

if they are going to mirror all ship types eventually, they could come around to it later

Did you just pay or did you find out what was in there first?

or just remove local and actually make pve meaningful

What do you mean by "flushing the capacitor" ?
---
Don't fall for the trap of VNI hunting. Fly a small ship that people will underestimate. Everyone goes for a kill they think they can win.
---
WTB Erebus 4b
---
Titans for 1k plex is probably gonna be a very vacant server, implies low demand as well as 10b/month plex prices. 
---
A *lot* of people will be run out, or run down to 1 account, on 10b/month pricing. But 20b titans also means either vast resource exploitation (think unmitigated turbo botting for years, the other half of the Serenity equation), or titans just not mattering very much anymore (no strategic sovwars ever, permanent blue donut).
---
That bonus is what makes those AT ships strong. You cant just go and start throwing AT ship bonuses on normal ships and expect balance cause you want "something cool" that they have.
---
The bonus they gave it is fair. Its a stalemate breaker and also a cruiser that can punch well above its class given enough time. It would fill a niche. We dont need it to ramp up to 1200 dps is 60s. It should have an obvious downside to the high potential damage.
---
draining the capacitor
---
I like Starks idea, googling everything is no fun
---
&gt; Following a crash in the value of extracted SP
---
There won't be a crash in the extracted SP value. SP price will slowly increase to keep up with PLEX. At some point the demand will decrease, so SP price won't be able to keep up with PLEX. First single-account SP farmers will go out of business. Then once PLEX prices soar high enough the MCT farmers will go out of business. At that point the demand will be supplied by people wanting to maintain alts (like myself). At that point the value of SP will hit a market equilibrium and won't be pushed up anymore by farmers, but it won't tank as the supply is much lower.

How to ruin EvE Online's persistant universe and all remaining faith in CCP in one easy step:  Wipe the server and start fresh!
---
&gt;Plexing is an **alternate** form of account subscription. CCP want more people to pay with money.
---
Technically when you PLEX you indirectly spend $20 for a subscription. Someone spent the $20 or so for that PLEX to sell it on the market, so CCP actually makes more money when people buy subscriptions with PLEX than when they do so with real money.
---
yes lets reset them from neutral to neutral, oh wait
---
So legion is looking like the winner. I still have some time before I decide so plz clear up any misconceptions I may have if I'm screwing up here.
---
Well I expect it to hit an equilibrium while PLEX keeps soaring. So maintaining alts will be more and more expensive but the SP price won't reduce. Either way is the same for these people with alts as it increases costs. Then perhaps some of them will go alpha, less demand on PLEX again, so for a while it's stable again, and so on. Lots of back and forth.
---
This is the most low effort, trash tier propaganda I have ever seen.
---
Thx for the info it will be usefull ;)

Yes they are! You can rent bot in Jita which are get runned by some own servers ... and you even get ad-mails in Jita...

And once you roam 0.00 space you know what you hit most of the time VNI-Bots 29 days old ratting hubs ...
---
I don't think a reset would be interesting. They would be better designing an entirely new universe. I played in 2003 and the appeal of the game was something that the advertisements played into themselves. Pioneering, exploring and carving a name for yourself in, at the time, a massive universe of emergent gameplay while competing or befriending fellow players. The original game was thought out and calculated in terms of development where the minerals required to manufacture ships, acquire skills and such gave the game and universe a progressive evolution with the titan being the end-game that CCP thought wouldn't be feasible to construct until jet can mining was discovered. An emergent game feature that wasn't intended but CCP left in as it required player co-operation to operate while opening up opportunities for harassment from can flippers introducing PVP to high sec.
---
If EVE reset in its current state, there would be massive amounts of power gaming and min-maxing over exploring. In my opinion, it wouldn't be interesting. I would absolutely play EVE 2, but I wouldn't play a server reset.

Because even dumb people if not afk (recall drone so not afk) will try to kill the attacker with the drone.

This is one of the nicest posts I've read here.
---
Apologies, your initial reply way a bit vague. You're right, and that is absolutely correct, but you never know. It's highly unlikely but hostilities might still erupt from other sources.
---
I always thought AT ships were strong because they combined more existing bonuses together than a normal ship would have.
---
&gt;I feel like I'm wasting time if anything doesn't make 100mil an hour.
---
Speaking as a pro trader type, this is adorable
---
Margin trading makes me want to gouge my fucking eyes out. I understand the idea, and that it's probably exceptionally lucrative, I've probably made 100mil doing it for the 2 days I tried it, but it makes me want to die.
---
Sort's history shows he swears undying loyalty to whoever threatens him. 
---
Why would that change?
---
VNIs in themselves are not the main problem, but have the potential of becoming it. If for example measures were taken to make all sorts of omega botting too expensive and it would not yield enough profits, then VNIs will become the next in line because they are perfectly effective as alpha bots.
---
So, I would start they are the main alpha botting problem in the game, not the main overall problem.
---
I only would resort to VNI hunting to provoke a response fleet. What small ship is easy to underestimate?
---
In some cases yes. Its normally combining an EWAR bonus with a powerful dps bonus. Like merging a combat recon with a HAC (or even a BC).
---
Trig ships dont have race specific EWAR or recons. So instead CCP tuned their ramp up mechanic with a unique bonus. That is a bonus to those AT ships to make them unique since they dont have a corresponding EWAR.
---
I’ve heard that the mining bonuses are a mistake/bug, take that with a grain of salt though
---
I don't know what the resist profile or the slot layout is, but I wonder if it could be fleet shield tanked, and the lows get overdrives. That would bump it up to maybe Goku speed with 5mn.
---
You'll have to forgive me, i haven't looked at cigarettes in about a decade because i don't smoke and find the habit disgusting.
---
Hmmm I'm lost now. I was believing that instead of draining the capacitor they used the cap boosters, as the description says :
---
&gt; Description
---
&gt; Provides a quick boost in  shield strength. The module takes Cap Booster charges and will start  consuming the ship's capacitor upon the charges running out.  Deactivating the module while it has no cap boosters loaded starts  reloading, if there are cap boosters available in cargo hold.
---
Stop posting, please

i think even the bads that loose billions of isk to sinners trajectory would benifit from the ease and use of cheap, readily avaliable bhaalgorns. :)

Yeah with how grrr goons /r/EVE is you can never be too sure really.

I'm sure that eventually goons will get taken on and I fully believe it'll be PIBC that does it.  However I don't think that's going to happen for years to come.

Tbh I think "multitrillionaire investors" is one of the special interest groups CCP cares about the least. With the possible exception of the goon isk cabal, the super-rich rarely do anything to generate content for normal players (since most don't solo fund alliance srp or start wars over moons), we just extract value from the rest of the economy. Most good investors are constantly market PvPing the entire game and winning, which is cool in theory but not necessarily great for Eve as a whole.

just don't be an idiot with your NSA usage and set auto-repeat off haven't changed my fit one bit since the patch and I haven't been caught or had my ticks affected.
---
They've been pretty consistent at making retarded decisions for like 5 years at least.
---
my guess is that when the gate is in the 'low-power' mode, supers and/or caps can't take it, similar to the way the abyssal sites are ship-restricted.
---
Uhh... why does the hac have 3 rig slots?
---
Sadly Abyssmals seem to be CCP's only real design priority over the last year.
---
Wow, you haven't really improved much since Brick Squad have you?
---
Thanks for the anonymous downvotes and complete lack of constructive criticism. I'll take them to be from the Tornado gankers who are upset I suggested they go hunting for targets rather than sit on their asses at the undock. =)

Have you joined a corporation? It sounds like you are doing a lot of stuff alone, and Eve doesn't really lend itself well to solo play for the most part.

Bhaals should have a module called "bigg succ" that gives a 5000% percent boner to neuts applied to capitals

Don't margin trade. It's not exceptionally lucrative. 
---
There's two main strategies for trading. One is to become a station trader, .01 like mad, train tycoon 5 across 5 chars to manage your thousand market orders, spend 12 hours a day fighting bots/autists, go batshit crazy, and either uninstall or turn to market botting yourself. 
---
The other is to get inventive/go asymmetric. Leave the beaten path and find something else to do. As a starting hint, a lot of good trading opportunities happen outside jita, where you aren't competing against 5000 other people for every penny you get.
---
Heavy bombers (cruiser-sized, can fit covops cloaks, covert cynos, and special anti-capital weapons, also able to take blogs bridges)? Slippery enough that ships bigger than cruisers can't effectively engage? Maybe also with interdiction nullification so that you have to point them in order to kill?
---
You had an stupid idea, and on top of that you start bitching because people aren't upvoting it minutes after posting.
---
Deal with it.
---
Is that a retarded shitpost on r/eve?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It could be! 
---
Just think… u/marcus_gideon has their fancy pants computer on, just done jerking off to midget porn, wanting to make eve a better place. Makes a post about something he really knows deep inside is a bad idea. 
---
But what if he didn't post? Imagine a world without shitposts, imagine a world where CCP didn't get all these retarded ideas to further fuck up eve.
---
Bhaalgorn BPC's are so abundant you got people trying to find buyers, and undercut each other to death.
---
Nullsec trading is something that's interesting but I don't have the skills to do anything without insane risks, and I'm stuck with a single contract.
---
And how exactly does this improve PvP and maintain a healthy economy?

Can confirm, Evanova is very good.

I found the dude that does do manufacturing. 10 slots per character so fill those useless slots with manufacturing chars.

in the "heavy water" perhaps?

Nope, I'll consider a corp once I find something I feel like sticking with that I can't do myself. I don't really enjoy the social aspect of games.
---
Tested Station Containers, the option to anchor them is there but it gives me an error when I try.
---
Proliferate the bpc.. theyre in delve they dont get more proloferated than that.
---
If you wanna break into a null market, get someone else to run your logistics. (The typical way to do this is to run everything through your alliance JF service, if you're part of a null alliance.) An altcorp for corp contracting spam is good if you wanna list doctrine ships or something.
---
You do know dreads have a utility high for neut right?

Good shit

I bet $5 it's a phone keyboard doing it for him.

Did you try to jettison them? It won't actually say anchor for freight containers, you just jettison them and it works

As much as I complain about Caps to corp/alliance mates, I'm secretly jealous because I'm pretty confident I wont even be sitting in one by the end of the year.

If I didn't have a wife and three kids I would reinstall EVE right now and play all weekend, in one sitting. That site is amazing.

Well... there is always the possibility for BlOps hotdrops. And you can still go kill the JFs full of loot, you just have to stop dry humping the Jita undock, and go find them.

Because the cruiser in the screenshot is the AT reward from last year, not the new hac.

This weekend I'm coming back from being away for a bit, and I'm looking forward to internet spaceships with all of you. (◕‿◕✿)

This post smells like avocados
---
You're comparing a Cruiser hull to a Battlecruiser hull. How do existing HACs line up against their BC equivalents?
---
I can't imagine they're superior in tank, speed, and DPS on all counts.
---
Who said safe? I just said, it would make it possible for someone to hotdrop BlOps and Recons and stuff on top of war targets or whatever.
---
The only place that would be "safer" is the Jita undock, b/c all the Tornadoes would have to hunt down the JFs that got away. But that would be the same result if they moved the hub to one of the Citadels next door. Then tethering would prevent any of the undock ganks we see today.
---
So I'm not sure what you think would be unbalanced?
---
Correct. Gold-backed-currency has tangible value. All of the money we use today (aside from crypto) is fiat, fake, not backed by anything other than the owning nations' promise to exist in the future. If a government falls, so does all of the wealth within it's country. Fiat currency is the RUG that is pulled from under the people by the rich while they extort and exfiltrate real value.

They made faction caps for 0.001% of the game population.

Also will make it especially easy to hunt explorers, go to a system with lots of sigs knowing it will be a juicy target for an explorer. Bookmark all the sigs and wait.
---
If you don't have cap charges loaded they use more than 3 times the capacitor of the same sized T2 shield booster to run. Sending it down the toilet as the other guy said. However, they still rep just as much shields as before.
---
Shield: reps the same amount, loaded/unloaded changes capacitor use    
---
Armor: uses the same capacitor, loaded/unloaded changes rep amount
---
Within the scope of CCP altering plex prices to eliminate "free subs", whether or not the sub is "free" to the player buying plex is irrelevant. They don't care if someone got something free. They care that they get their pound of flesh for every sub.

I don't necessarily disagree with what you're saying here, but it's not relevant to the topic.

I'm saying how did he get the ISK...most-likely he bought it, which means he still spent $30k of real life money.
---
Bhaalgorns with a drone bonus would have 7.
---
no, you need a pair of speed rigs and 2 overdrives just to reach kiki speed, then your ship is then useless as a booshing booster since others do the job better, faster, more tank and with a second or third link.
---
Are you trolling...? JFs get ganked on gates, not on the station undock. If JFs could take cynos in highsec, they would never die.

How much to ship from Jita to Atlanta?
---
It's mostly just glass, because its application and DPS is going to be worse than ACs.
---
I did patent a really cool optimization algorithm but distribution centers have been existing since maritimate travel became a thing.
---
I'm pretty sure I can ship a Eve compatible machine to Atlanta for cheap :P.
---
You Sir rock.

3 Adaptive invulnerabilities for 7.5b here. Still hurts sometimes.

Thanks for your support kind sir.

Explain this algorithm! I'd love to hear how the thinking goes.
---
FedEx just batphoned they need you in Malaysia pronto.
---
Look the patent up its a lovely read if you are into that.
---
Wow, that's such a pity, way too much fitting effort to get it up to a decent speed. It seems like it'd have been so good as a fleet ship with its bonuses too.
---
they dont need the same value of bonus
---
Planes fall out of the sky there NOPE!
---
How do we find the patent?
---
Not really. That’s actually the opposite of what you’d do. 
---
Think about it, if a system is full of relic sites, how often do explorers fly through there? And if you’re hunting explorers, why would you pick a system that they, for whatever reason, usually avoid?
---
You just fly through a decently traveled area, which you’ll really only be able to recognize after flying there yourself and seeing the explorers, or the lack of them. 
---
Also, you have to consider why they avoid it. I can give you a few systems in catch that, at any given time, have a relic site in them. But that’s because they also have w cloaky camper there 24/7. So even finding a well trafficked system isn’t enough if you actually want to camp, and not get counter ganked. 
---
There’s only one thing I see this changing, and that is for explorers who’ve gone in a loop around a region, or a part of it, and written down every sig they’ve already scanned. 
---
But that makes exploring easier, not harder. 
---
I mean, I agree that this is a bad idea, but you’ve got the reason why it’s bad completely wrong
---
"Stop anonymously downvoting &gt;:("

Yup, if it was same base speed as the kiki it would be in a really good spot, but CCP decided to cut off half its legs for no reason and send it to the races.

Isnt there a implant that kinda does that?

Which only goes to show that EVE, as they say, is real.

This doesn't make sense. Algorithm is the word we use precisely because we can't explain what it does.
---
You should ship merchandise for CCP. Their shipping prices are insane.
---
naw
---
Hahahahaha 100m an hour
---
For someone trying to operate a small business that can only fill up a small amount of a shipping container, what would you recommend for first steps in reducing the costs? Either in finding people who would pay for the use of the remaining or with finding others who want to sell off some space.
---
Go with 'heuristic' for even more ambiguity...
---
("A heuristic is an algorithm in a clown suit")
---
Please tell me that you're getting shot at less.
---
I know the 'slippery slope' is at times  considered a logical fallacy in an argument. but I feel it does apply here. a 'reset' may act as a great equalizer in the short term. but anyone who has invested a great amnt of time and money into the game would likely instantly feel invalidated and cheated.
---
   
---
(here is the slippery slope part) Further once you do this and set that precsident - you'll have to do this periodically again and again from then on. because there will always be newer players who aren't capable of catching up to the oldbois simply because they signed up after others have already established themselves. it would kill motivation to try to excel in this game both skill (pilot talent) wise and SPwise. 
---
    
---
however, an idea just occurred to me: and yes I do realize doing anything close to this would Req a huge developer investment that most players would prefer be used on fixing existing issues, etc...
---
BUT, humoring the reset concept for a minute, might be interesting to have people opt into creating a new character  every few months (bear with me here) to participate in some kind of 'seasonal' League wherein the newly created toons worked to get ahead and meet certain goals based on some kind of theme. and at the end of the season said progress/rankings would be reset completely but maybe based on seasonal ranking for that league, some kind of temporary perk could be given to 1 toon on that same account (I'm assuming the non-league main for that accnt) that lasts until the next league season starts. then a new seasonal league would start and the perks on the main would be removed. wash, rinse, repeat.
---
again,I know it's a silly idea, and will never be done (most likely). but I found it a somewhat amusing thought experiment.
---
and for those of you to whom this sounds really familiar, it's because the game Path of Exile basically does this exact thing (more or less)
---
it would also provide CCP an opportunity to test/tweak new game mechanics in a somewhat 'live envieonment' for an extended period of time - meaning not only could things be tested - but the impact of any changes could be tracked over time and allow CCP to tweak or scrap those ideas as necc.
---
Yes I know, it's a silly idea, so please be gentle. It was just something that I thought of since it was brought up - I kinda just ran with it for 5min. I am now ready for my downvotes.

As an ingame ganker who irl works in bulk freight I find this hilarious.
---
Summary anywhere what are the new ships and the it's bill of production?
---
Pretty much if they'd implement it
---
Just got a new job cause I'm good with spreadsheets.
---
LOL, something something JB Hunt's lunchbox
---
I heard botting is a thing look into that..
---
congrats
---
No man, that's exactly what an algorithm is not.
---
An algorithm is a way something is done, like a recipe. In fact, it's a weird way to use the word, but the exact way you make chocolate chip cookies is an algorithm; it's something that you can do, and follow unambiguously. If you have a problem, and an answer, an algorithm is the way you get from point A to B.
---
Like, here is a list. \[5, 2, 3, 1, 4\]. How do you sort it? It's not some mysterious process, we can explain to children how to sort lists of numbers. That's an algorithm, and there are lots of algorithms dedicated to a particular way of sorting a list of numbers. [https://brilliant.org/wiki/sorting-algorithms/](https://brilliant.org/wiki/sorting-algorithms/)
---
Moreover, you don't get a patent for fuzzy bullshit. You gotta write down exactly what happens, what it is. No handwaving, no secrets.
---
Algorithm has that sort of mystery because we associate it with stuff like Google's PageRank algorithm, which are quite complex and not a whole lot of people bother to learn it and are content to call it something akin to magic. But algorithms are really cool and fascinating! At least to me as a computer science student.
---
Only 36km point range, ez
---
Except that they have a point fit?
---
Could you give me the URL of the report you're trying to manipulate please?
---
awe shucks
---
I... I know. I'm a software developer. I was just trying to be funny.
---
With your mwd heated you should be able to burn out of point range.
---
Oh I meant pvp sorry.
---
Hey I feel you, but I really would suggest trying to find a corporation/alliance that you enjoy interacting with. I used to think that I liked playing without socializing, and in fact I still usually do, but I found a great group in my alliance that I talk with kn the regular, just in a jabber chat room. It really does work wonders, and really changed my eve experience! Tha that being said, if you like going flying solo, I would still reccomend joining a Corp that aligns with your eve interests :)
---
I am, and always have been, american wally.  I just make it a point to not live with my head up my ass.
---
Ah  
---
I'm sorry \^\^
---
Where there's a will there's a whine :P
---
It's true.
---
Thats pretty slick
---
This will make explo bots so much more effective

I don't think you get the joke.

tl;dr he claims to be a black market avocado smuggler in mexico.
---
I thought he was talking about how hard avocados are to move.
---
came here to shittalk. read reasonable arguments about missing adjustments in blueloot due to fucked up Inflation because of rorqs and titan ratting. no more hate towards OP. now i hate ccp again.
---
To be honest they aren't that special. They can be interesting in larger fights, but all of my favorites ships wind up subs. The initial training time is suck, but once done once it's done forever.
---
Something will take us on all right, but I'd be shocked if it was PIBC and not a larger and more experienced group.
---
Other way around mate.
---
can always extract sp and play for 300-400m a month or what it is nowadays
---
I mean yeah. Dude is clearly doing it wrong. Skill farms aside, isk isn't all that hard to make.
---
I agree, wormhole ISK staying static is a pretty silly mechanic as the game currency inflates
---
If anything blue loot is more valuable due to cheaper minerals.
---
The argument falls apart the moment you stop talking about plex.
---
Yup
---
Got a few days left to train DD operations up, then I'll go test out the "fuck you in particular" button.
---
Seasonal pilots having a timed lifespan reminds me of two things: abyssal space and Blade Runner replicants. Clearly, the answer is let me roll a triglavian replicant, give it 90 days to live. Make leader boards for isk, kills both npc and not,  and make them live in a dynamic section of space that resets quarterly. 
---
Reroll everything about that space. Put no connections to New Eden in any way other than abyssal pvp. Just add Triglavian to the racial select menu at pilot creation, pilot spawns in abyssal space and never leaves.
---
Somewhat, but it is also a lot more involved. Besides, you can fit a rattlesnake for less, make more ISK, and you won't need to do things like target or press F1.
---
Yeah, "logistics algorithm" brings up a ton of patents.
---
Got a number for us to look up? I'd love to see it!
---
Not like someone is gonna steal your idea, because that's what patents do...
---
Well, I guess it gives the agency window more of a purpose. I'm not going to say I like this change, but I also don't hate it if it gets in either.
---
What's the company, unless it is just a one man show and you are basically a contractor.
---
Wormholes are great, 100m/h is easy if you are engaged and ok with getting yanked every now and then.
---
I came back to eve after trying it f2p and then I found a WH and am hooked.
---
Yeah. Unless It’s like the SOE/Soct thing.
---
By bots and rmt
---
Sagittarius region, Cassiopeia constellation.
---
It's more I want one as a "just incase" scenario... I like my medium ships too much right now.
---
v v v v v v v v, man my finger hurts.
---
It certainly looks like a bug based on the quote from the dev blog, on the flip side, warping from system to system just to find them empty soon loses its appeal once the "Yay, signatures!" effect has wore off after the first week or two. 
---
Warping is about the most boring thing you can do in game, so travelling with an objective in mind is at least something. 
---
Having signatures visible in agency, would mean more of them get run rather than sitting in abandoned systems until they despawn. Obviously, more people converging on them means more competition and potentially reduced payouts when selling to market per-site.
---
I kinda like the idea of them being easier to find. I'd have probably done something to the hacking minigame; emit a pulse scan and it tells you how many jumps away the nearest signatures are, but not necessarily what system, you have to work that out by moving about and, for want of a better word, triangulating it.
---
Good thing your job doesn't involve writing.
---
Go for it, man!
---
Smoke yourself a carrier :-).
---
That's fair, I sometimes don't feel like being "connected" either. I have interacted with lots of people in this game that I have never spoken to, and lots more that just keep to themselves. Luckily, minimal communication is easily possible even when affiliated with a group of any size. The social aspects of the game (corp/alliance) are part of what makes possible the most lucrative aspects of Eve's various professions. You can make money doing anything. You'll never make *the most* money without at least *some* connections, and the first place to score solid connections is at the corporation level.
---
&gt; Don't forget to report those assholes after you destroyed their ships and raped their corpses.
---
FYI, reporting every single maybe-botter you see means less bots will get banned. Hundreds of low quality reports means CCP GMs waste time reading petitions they can't take action on. A few reports with a better standard than "he warped back to the same anom after 5 minutes" might actually make it to security. Too many bad reports will drown out the good ones.

Low power structures should not be able to have tether functionality.
---
sure. as long as we're rolling with the concept, it seems like a p. cool idea. I wonder how many ppl have wanted to fly as a Drifter or Trig pilot.
---
I'm by no means suggesting a tengu for ratting, mostly emphasizing the overkill part, like you say RS is probably an even better option.

Because pay-to-win I suppose? /s

Small propaganda piece made for a campaign against United Federation of Conifers in retribution for a broken NIP, and retribution for their reluctance to have an actual fight at any scale without cynos and batphones. Unfortunately this campaign never came to fruit, as it seems SLYCE and Darkness leadership continuously bend and renew treaty against linebro consensus, and at this point I've been gone from the alliance for a while too.
---
So here is the art prematurely! I hope it is appreciated, and that my comrades Deklein are still flying dangerous.
---
Dirk MacGirk is a the biggest Shit faced Cuntbag EVe has ever produced!
---
He is a nobody and that has to be hard. I almost feel bad for the guy.
---
Awesome post.  I think many "jobs" in eve can be applied to IRL.  Hence some posts is "I stated I play EveOnline" and they get the job.  Congrats.   Economics is hard unless you play with it daily then you are an asset to IRL corps.   Change x into b and y into z and you now have an IRL model.
---
My mother told me don't trust horsefaces
---
He seems mildly annoyed
---
Here he rain terror upon space rocks
---
Who?
---
I only ever saw ways to apply my RL job to EVE but it was either against CCP's ToS, someone had already done it or I was too lazy to bother.
---
(I am a programmer).
---
There are a few things. You can use a 20 foot container instead of a 40 foot one or you can poll local businesses, form a sort of shipping consortium to fill up containers with multiple small batches.

Beautiful. The art team never ceases to impress.

It does I just pay people with better grammar and spelling to write stuff all those English Majors need jobs you know.

I'm expecting it to be the trig boss of the invasions

Dude that's an awful thing to say.

Imagine how Grath would feel if he heard you say that about someone else.

---
&gt;Average player income (...) When I play eve, I run 3 accounts. (Sometimes 4)
---
Even though this one was a joke, keep up the good fight, wilful ignorance must be purged!
---
I tried it a bit on the lower tiers but I heard the isk isn't great.  How much do you make typically?
---
And if you show info ...  
---
  
---
"It's full of stars!"
---
Now just imagine how much better it would be if you had a moral high horse to ride upon instead of being a Goon. ;P
---
It isn't difficult to fly a capital on the test server.
---
See what happens when you say my name...
---
This isn't the first time Dirk has been a cunt.
---
But he drinks and he thinks he knows stuff.
---
All the other people on the show go along with it for the "meme".
---
There was some restrictions to that if I remember correctly. Like people could put up an MTU next to beacon which prevents new filament from working.
---
Yeah..... 
---
No.
---
To me, theres no point in test server.
---
I think he was talking about the general mechanics when it is not pertaining to unfueled citadel's.

Hopefully it is not another 10 million ehp to chew through

Why are your leaders morale-posting, talking about fc's getting burnt out and talking about getting invaded when its actually an offensive war trying to wear the enemys out?
---
pls, you have to be a giant fucking smoothbrain if you actually believe what you wrote...
---
So who is this guy? Besides a typical INN dude?
---
Dirk is a cretin, full-stop
---
Last year, [he tried to take issue with CCP Falcon organizing a LGBT player meetup and got hammered by everyone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8ahd2n/what_happened_lastnight_on_the_opencoms_show/dwyqe1u/) Pretty epic meltdown on Open Comms overall. Somehow, he managed to argue both sides of the argument *he started* which is really talented ngl.
---
I thought you had to say it 3 times in a mirror...
---
What was this in reference too? Dude seems really torqued up.
---
I mean, he's not wrong, y'all are a bunch of Alabama shit fucks.
---
The tier this is at hasn't been invented yet.
---
You only now realised? :D
---
Lol... This isn't even close the worst I've seen on Open Comms, this is actually pretty mild.
---
He seems mildly aggravated.
---
First;
---
Those are pine cones duder.
---
&gt; But I feel expecting not to pay more than 30$ a month for a game is beyond reasonable. 
---
You don't have to pay more. Just accept you have less accounts running. Problem solved.
---
I guess he is just another goon right?
---
&gt; This post isnt about money
---
Yes, it is actually.
---
Alpha accounts are not allowed to be multi boxed or used by the same person at one time.
---
reminds me of the matrix, abit
---
&gt; does everyone here want high plex prices
---
I do because I buy plex with money and sell them for ISK that I can waste.
---
I think they were referencing bots not ratters in general.
---
&gt; So it's literally impossible for my "arguement" to be wrong
---
Right. You do know you're also wrong about that, don't you?
---
Are you and independent broker? Or do you work for a 3PL as a logistics coordinator?
---
&gt;Im unsubbing from /r/eve.
---
Good riddance.
---
because there are like 10 other guys that cry on r/Eve daily about the same story.
---
Dirk makes *Open Comms* REALLY unbearable to watch. He's an insufferable shitebag.
---
How do you know what statics his hole has? Not all wormholes are ultra leet pvper gods who get all that dank blue loot and evict lower class wh corps.
---
I'll give that second one a try (already aware of the first), thanks for the reply =)
---
You could try regional trading? Use low volume items which have larger margins because that’s easier to haul and means less updating sell orders
---
Oh god, I remember this. As a gay player it really hurt me to hear Dirk spout such senseless drivel. I'm glad he got the hammering he needed.

Practise is pointless?

CCP/Pearl Abyss is never going to reset Tranquility. It would be a massive middle finger to anyone who has ever spent time and/or money on this game. 
---
However, what I could see happen is the launch of a new server. EVE has a very low new player retention and a big advertising campaign could provide a chunk of new players who stay attached to the game. (Although I think new player retention needs more attention/solutions than just a new server)
---
&gt; I'm glad he got the hammering he needed.
---
Showing results for "I'm glad he got the pounding in the rear that he needed."
---
&gt;;]
---
yeah! lol for everyone who has purchased skill injectors they would have spent hundreds on nothing
---
Probably not. IT is dev space, and there is no reason for CCP to open it to players outside of the AT.
---
the thing in eve i am most thankful for is its native support of capital letters
---
You know when you drink and think you are the funniest person? The center of attention? Then after hearing the night repeated back to you from the perspective of someone less drunk or even sober you realize you were kind of a dick and childish? Dirk never makes this connection.
---
Talk about missed opportunities 😩

You give us too much credit

I don't get the culture of these Imperium/goon streams

---
Once I have the ability to cloak I'll probably get into nullsec trafficking and contracts.
---
Sounds like he's not. If what he says is true then thats less than the last fc i want to fly under.
---
Cocksucking piece of shit whorecock reporting in!
---
Honestly tho and I haven't listened to this episode yet, but open  comms  while I find it entertaining,  is usually a drunken clusterfuck, I certainly wouldn't take it too seriously
---
There's an 80ms/s difference between the two at base speeds. It seriously needs a buff.
---
Please, it's  also slow as shit.
---
Just log onto the test server.
---
Why would that be a problem ? It's a boss of something plaguing a whole constellation. Where is the fun if it goes down as fast as a T1 frigate ?
---
A representative of a portion of the game player base.
---
And IMPI was born !
---
What kind of return are you getting in your T3s?  
---
It's been pretty lame for me.  
---
About 12-20M per fila in loot, minus the cost of the Fierce Gamma Filaments I need to purchase per run.  At about 7M each on the market.  
---
So real profit of 5-13M, or 15-39M per hour.
---
Well strangely... I’ve been doing pretty great in T3 so far. I generally don’t bother to measure my ISK/h in activities, but I often stop my abyssal sessions with about 300 millions ISK in my cargo, when I get lucky with the drops. And a single specialization books generally double that &gt;.&lt;
---
Plexing your account isn't a great way to have fun. It's 15 dollars, just like...mow someone's lawn or something.
---
I wouldnt be against more spice at home but you are right. It wont happen
---
Personal theory is that it will be the big bad boss for these invasions and at the end of the story arc we get to destroy it and one BPC will drop for it and only one.
---
love ya guys, because of all of u making new eden lively we can play eve  &lt;3 fly safe and be nice to newbros \o/
---
I think he means mango army who have extremely experienced FCs. But they are just building up.
---
&gt; the old model has sort of balance
---
Hoohoohoo, no?
---
The answer is no.
---
/sad
---
I’m going to get some flak, but he has a drinking problem. I dislike these types of ‘talking head’ shows that are as much about getting hammered as they are about other content. I hope he has some friends that can help him ease off the sauce. You don’t need alcohol to have a successful show.
---
This oversimplification and misunderstanding of basic economic principles is so gross it'd make a garbageman dry heave.
---
Prices for non-plex related items are fairly constant. Prices for plex related stuff has more to do with the amount of people buying plex irl and the amount of skillfarms than anything else
---
It looks cool k?
---
This will happen when eve actually does die... someone will reverse engineer the game like all other dead mmo's
---
he's fine for the first 10 mins, before he just gets drunk and starts shouting over everyone.
---
after that he ruins what could otherwise be a good show. i have no idea how the other hosts put up with it.
---
I'll be the devil's advocate here: you dont NEED a corp, as others would suggest. Whilst a social group greatly enriches the eve experience, you absolutely can play as a solo - you'll just be playing a different game, sorta.
---
I play solo and have a lot of fun, and one can definitely pay for plex with isk as a solo easily, especially as an omega. Good luck, fly smart :)
---
who?
---
No you didn't
---
You can still talk dirty to it though.
---
Most nullsec trading works buy buying in Jita, contracting to a courier for a small fee, and reselling the items in staging after they arrive. 
---
Actually hauling them yourself is a completely different business
---
Use indentations / spaces and use periods Jesus
---
Congrats. One of my corpmates just surpassed 300million lp. The only thing about it is that his character is born 2015. (I dont want to know how much money that guy spent)
---
Hello fellow fountain pen person. What ink and pen were you using?
---
Too bad :(
---
If you want to use more accounts, some people triple box frigs in abysil sites. Run t5 sites. Sadly I don't know what you get from them now days. My Corp mates did them when they came out, safely in a c2 wh.

Does your scout **need** to learn new skills?
---
I await the follow up to this with URL of the news site detailing your millions $ scam and which country you fled to.
---
I am not going to hate on you, however I think that excessive multi-boxing play is one of the reasons why Eve has issues even though the most devoted players have over ten accounts subbed in some manner.    That is why I want the plex price to keep going up, though for me you are acceptable with four accounts.    It is all about balance.   Personally I will not play without two accounts, but I sub them with RL so I can chill play.
---
Fraternity is no longer a menace.  Anyone who beats test like a red headed step child is good in my books.  😜.   Maybe when there done with Dino's they'll start busting up the hornet's nest in delve.
---
What class wh are you even operating in to have this problem? With this many accounts you could set up in a small c5, roll all your connections and make over a billion with just 2 sites per hour, provided you kill the drifter, which is doable with 2 rattlesnakes. Wormhole income was and is insane considering you can lock down your system, your setup is just suboptimal, whatever it may be.
---
You live in a BLOODY C4 and complain about income being shit? Well no shit, Sherlock! C4 have always been horseshit for making money, so my suspicion that you're just doing it wrong was right. You said it yourself, you live there for PvP purposes. So, be smart, use the 2 accounts you can easily sustain and do what you supposedly went there to do. If you want to krab go somewhere else.
---
Öööhm... Have you ever reported a bot? I don't think so? You can't enter a Message for CCP. It is Basicly Report as a Bot --&gt; Yes / No
---
Skill extracting should nearly pay for an alt.
---
Combine that with PI on 3 chars per account in a wh, and you are looking at a large sum of isk.  
---
Lets assume you only extract on 2 accounts.  That is 4b isk + 12 chars x 600m/each in PI.  that is 11.2b in static income to pay for plex each month.
---
I would be a nice feature if it come with some kind of cost.
---
For instance, a new type of structure or a new rig on stations will constantly report the signal/anomaly count in it's deployed system to all corp members. It would not be continuous update, every scan report will consume fuel and owner can set the reporting frequency.
---
I'm all for a new universe , new systems, new types of stars, new types of moons and spacial anomalies, new types of NPC's possibly aliens?, new types of gameplay a new Universe could potentially open up vast amounts of content for the game.
---
plex prices are shitty.  The main thing i recognize is the value of SP has gone up.  so either I extract or pay 2.2m per month.
---
ok.
---
Normally I'd agree but if trig logi AI is as good as diamond rats and they are in trig ships you will never break that tank.
---
And Drifter / Trig Events
---
Even I, a nullsec carebear have heard about "farmholes"
---
Would you even be able to fit an assembled one in a ship? What would you need all that space for just floating in space? Asking for a friend.
---
Well tbh in lowsec running 4/10, 5/10, and especially 6/10 can be worth. For Guristas for ex those sites drop Pithum C-type, B-type, and A-type invulns respectively along with a lot of other valuable mods. Of-course this will vary depending on what region you’re in.
---
Probably still is if it's in the US...
---
China is coming.
---
It would be *more* if OP opened the business at ~~PUBG IRL~~ Baltimore
---
&gt; Hence some posts is "I stated I play EveOnline" and they get the job.
---
Sounds stupid, but I mentioned that in my interview and the hiring manager said, "If you're nuts enough to play Eve, you have the right work ethic."
---
Got the job.
---
With the 3 of the worm fits in dark sites i think its 1-2 bill per hour but it depends on your luck
---
Mm, pimecones.
---
/me reminisces about Homestar Runner
---
Lovely art, friendo.
---
This is a problem, every single game has.
---
However, Eve suffers from a far more extreme loss of retention than other players. This comes from the sandbox perspective that does not give new players a clear mission to persue, and with the huge possibilities players face, they are overwhelmed.
---
And unfortunately most of the time take the most boring stuff to progress.
---
This can be solved with one fundamental change: bring new players actively into player run organizations. They will receive a mission there and the support they need to progress.
---
more likely you'll see people jumping covert haulers about haha
---
But were you there though?
---
Well if it's a bug on the test server they'll ignore you and let it go live then patch it out somewhere between a few weeks and several years later.
---
Well yea part of CONCORD added some time ago
---
And this need to be made into a background too. The art team needs bonuses. And bring back logibro.
---
Do you get ganked often ?
---
You are not even close. 
---
If the TAPI had a little bit 'Big Picture' view, their management should keep their members’ mouth cleaner long time ago.  It is impossible to ask me to fight with them now, after what they did. GSF and other alliances are far more wise about that. 
---
As for your wise man ‘Mantou’. There is not many PIBC members will Join TQ with him, and survive at last. 
---
He knows that, and his best chance is calling back his former members in RR/WinCo. and acquire new members.
---
Sound like a goog plan, but most chinese players feel disgusting stay with TAPI. So Mantou claim he will deal with that.  But his partner seems unwilling to cooperate with his big show. 
---
Now his background, his new partner and what he propagated make him looks like a fool.
---
what is this BS 0.3% broker's fee? T.T
---
Dont go to tama
---
Only 3 of us will probably ever know (not counting CCP). Maybe when Briscs and/or Killahs NDA runs out, they can say more.
---
&gt; I’ve got a alpha VNI alt on my laptop
---
Isn't that against the EULA?
---
I would resub for this.
---
Plate prices have gone up about 40%, they used to be ~5m and they're 7m today.
---
The income in nullsec has definitely increased, with rorqual multiboxing through injectors, and the extra safety of Upwell structures in all ratting systems. Injecting into VNI/carrier/whatever ratting alts is also a thing now.
---
Care to explain what your day looks like in a wh? If explored through them but never moved into one ....
---
&gt; I have my main omega on my main computer and my alt in a Nestor on the laptop.
---
This is against the EULA
---
Good for you! How did you find your customers?
---
No get fucked. Your opinion can absolutely be wrong. 
---
My opinion is that the sky is fucking red. 
---
My opinion is fucking wrong.
---
Your argument is that blue loot price has stayed static and hasnt kept up with inflation. 
---
There hasn't been any inflation in anything gameplay related, therefore your argument is wrong. 
---
And really dumb, also, you posted this on a form for all to see, no shit you got some pushback you basically posted 500 words of 
---
&gt; I cant afford to run 4 accounts for half price, fuck this game.
---
CCP really need to look at this. If it becomes impossible to maintain PVP accounts while still having fun and not spending silly amounts of RL£, they're going to end up with a game entirely populated by nullsec krabs and no content.
---
VNI alts do not add to the community or the enjoyment of the game. Wormhole content generators do.
---
did you read wat he said? he keeps his toons in a seperate farmhole
---
AFAIK its against the EULA if it’s on the same pc, but even if it is, somebody else could be playing on that account for all they know..
---
What if each station had a fixed number of mooring points.
---
Are you suggesting that a player could for example Moore a titan outside an astrahus and logoff and have the titan stay safe moored in bumpable ? I'd be all for that just as safe as docking but with the draw back of there only being a few slots and it off being visible to the world..
---
Would also be a nice visual.
---
Yeah, this is exactly what CCP want you to do. "Ooh shiny, I want that stuff" *buys omega*
---
EULA applies to users, not computers.
---
That said I can't actually find where it says that, so either they changed it or it's in another document.
---
I've read about many people becoming Excel specialists thanks to EVE, but this is new! Congrats!
---
I downvoted.
---
Not anonymous anymore
---
Fite me
---
Yeah that's a really bad idea.
---
F
---
Ha now we agree.
---
Your playstyle seems reasonable to me and it's not the usual whining post.
---
Still you seem to be a senior player and shouldn’t really have problems. I checked your name but the character with the same name as your reddit account seems inactive.
---
Anyways, you describe yourself as a long-term player and as such I assume the three to four accounts you run have nearly all the skills you need trained on the different chars. Sure, you’ll always want more skills, but I can’t believe that you really need them. Thus, you can finance the third account which you’re not paying with RL money with skillfarming. Yes, you won’t be able to turn this into a profit every month, but it will be very low cost to stay omega.
---
The buy price for large skill injectors is 1,001,255,000.00, sell price for extractors is 497,000,000.00. This means currently you make about one thousand isk per SP. With perfect mapping and +5 implants you train 1944000 SP per 30 days. (You would do the skill farming on a character which you don’t use in space like a Jita trading alt.) So, you make about 1.944b a month but have to pay about 2.22b to be omega. This means you must pay about 276m to stay omega if you don’t want to train new skills. This is rather reasonable to obtain for an experienced player. Also note that this month PLEX is extra expensive because of the login rewards. Using the login reward SP gives you extra isk if you extract it. You even come up on top.
---
Is it worthwhile for me to start playing now or will I be insta destroyed by someone playing this game since 2010 like when I played GTA V online in 2017. Also I read that the game is Linda pay2win and you have to sink hundreds of dollars to play it competitively, is that true/exaggerated?
---
Also look up xtrasquishy
---
On youtube, best 1 minute tutorials for the hecate ever.
---
I don't understand why are you getting downvotes.. it's a normal question, considering Revenant is player attainable
---
If you can't already make 10 or 100 times what a new player makes then well, what the fuck are you doing?
---
Eve just needs to die.  Old, boring and broken.
---
It is, yeah. But the point is, if there can be a threat in system that doesn't show up on your free intel channel, why can't players do that?
---
Good job... Hope you beat out DHL one day
---
The game itself is very complex and hard to get into, but even when you are a new player there is a role for you. The start is rough, but once you are established in a Corp and have a general idea of what you are doing EVE can be really rewarding in a way :).
---
I myself don't consider EVE P2W, even though there is a Premium status, allowing you to fly more ships and train your skills onto a higher level. However, this Premium status is achievable through playing the game and earning enough regular ingame currency. 
---
EVE has been my go-to game for more than a year now, and even though I never spend a penny on it, I really enjoy it. THere is many awesome people playing the game and just a matter of time until you find your place!
---
I'd say just give it a shot and see if you like it!
---
\[Eve has sound?\]
---
Awesome story! Congratulations and keep up the great work!!
---
Well done man, keep going!
---
Returning player.  
---
Since the API XML retirement and change to ESI in 2018 there's seems to be a hole left in terms of useful fitting and theory crafting tools.  
---
Loading my pilot info into EVE HQ or EFT and theorizing what I could fly next was one of my favorite parts about EVE as it gave me a quick idea of what to aim for and what skills to train to get to where I wanted to be.
---
Is there any tool being used to do that today, how are players going about this?
---
PFYA is the only tool on UniWiki, but step 1 in the setup guide is telling me to generate an API key which of course no longer works.
---
Can pilot info be loaded into PYFA manually?  
---
Sounds painful but would save me time theorizing fitting for my character in the long run.
---
Thanks, will do. I was getting bored of csgo so was looking for a new game I can play daily and looks like I might have found it
---
Thanks fren (✿◠‿◠)
---
What a horrible ordeal for you
---
I am the perfect case in point. I joined eve in 2009. My corp was resolutely "carebear", but they got me the basics sorted. After about 9 months I wanted to branch out, so I left the corp and spent some time baiting mission runners back when that could be done, and did a lot of solo pvp. They found this distasteful so i was not allowed to return.
---
I then fell in with an aspiring hisec wardec group, which eventually split into two factions. Me leading one and the fabled Commander Starscream leading the other. We ended up having a hisec war. It included espionage, betrayal, neutral alts keeping eyes and providing warpins and it was this war that formed the pvp experience of the now well known pvper Brainstraw. We won...resoundingly.
---
We then reformed once again into a corp and this led to us playing a part in many nullsec alliances including White Noise and Intrepid Crossing and Nulli Secunda and finally Drone Walkers. (Among others) I led large fleets, fought against famous FC's and sometimes won, sometimes lost.
---
It's now 10 years later and I don't have the time to manage fleets and corps any more (joys of a career and being a Dad). But I found my spot in a capable pvp corp in PL, I can be the mentor now and take more of a back end role as line member and corp clown.
---
I think I may stick around for a while yet.
---
Delve got the Most income because it is Not failcascading like everyone else. Please dont hide your "we need to nerf goons" behind a Pseudo intellectual Wall of Text.
---
You're by far the largest and most powerful block around, and you're blue to the second-largest. Nobody will take you on.  
---
WWB was about *the Imperium* trying to take on more than it could chew, not the other way around, as an alternative to dying of boredom as they had already won the game at the time (a bit like now). It's unlikely to happen again. Also, AoM needs at least a year to build up, and has blued the blue donut, so no threat coming from that quarter.
---
If you look at the killboards, test alliance please feedmore are the ones being farmed lol
---
If you really pimp it out, you can comfortably run level 4's, and even t5 exotics and electricals without too much issue. Have to be wary of your drones since the nerf however
---
No, players don't quit because they have huge possibilities and are overwhelmed. That is good and keeps players in the game.
---
Players quit because eve is a very simple game with very little to do and the reason they started playing isn't reasonable when it takes 5 hours of roaming to get a single decent fight after six months of trading and skill training.
---
The ratio of rl time spent watching your ship warp compared to quality content is fucking abysmal.
---
It is one of the things you deal with as you go through EVE.
---
Oh yes, there and back.
---
Amazing story!
---
Congrats op
---
I'm sorry, but I just have to point out that middle link..... just....
---
probably because they can go soft and spoil easily
---
You had video of a Damage Control from when it was an active module! 
---
Hardly recent.
---
Incursions used to be hugely unbalanced - and therefore popular - because you could make more ISK than in nullsec with next to no risk whatsoever.  
---
Now, you can make more ISK in nullsec AND it has become no more risky than incursions.  
---
In either case, the risk vs reward balance was way off, but the difference is you can grind way more ISK in null than you ever could in incursions.  
---
That, and the fact that CCP has gone full "grind is good" whereas it didn't use to be that way. Oh well.
---
Thrasher totally doable for new players. 
---
Search "Samuele KLSM" in zkill - only started playing ciuple of months ago, 3 mil sp and is having great times in a Thrasher.
---
Has killed comets, worms, daredevils - usually runs AB dual web setups or AB web scram.
---
Thrasher is actually a great destroyer choice for a newbie. Especially the MSE autocannon version.
---
&gt;Most people, and particularly people who pay dollars to CCP, spend their playtime either in null empires or around them.
---
How do you know that more people who sub their accounts live in nullsec than elsewhere? While I'm a big supporter of your doomed effort to cull Delve excavators, I'm pretty sure you pulled that statement right out of your backside.
---
Also why is turned off not already a feature... CCPlease!
---
Is there ships restrictions in Abyssal space? Can I use Confessor?
---
Login and undock in a Astero or Covop.
---
Check if corpmates have everything bookmarked, If not then scan down and bookmark everything.
---
Then grab any data or relic sites unless we got newbros online.
---
Then depending on how many other holes are open I’ll run the easy sleeper sites in a Gila.
---
Then I’ll make a PI run, I have to drop mats at 6 plants every 48hrs, the other 24 planets only need to be collected once a week.
---
If we have a null hole to a quiet pocket I’ll go out and do the combat sites in a or jump around looking for relics.
---
Then I’ll go through any holes we have and scan them down, again, I’ll snatch any data/relic, look for gas in the c4/c5/shattered. If so I’ll grab huffing frig and ninja mine, I’ll kill the sleepers if I can, and get all the gas and loot. I just skilled into expedition frigs, I’m guessing I can grab ice now as well.
---
Well do this stuff as a group to, we got the mining folks that stick to the refineries mining moon chucks, the exploration folks will camp the holes, got DSTs doing import/export for the manufacturing.
---
If you are in the hole with our corp you have to jump in a combat ship if we need to camp a hostel hole, have everyone jump in battlecruisers while someone gets alts out to pop the hole. Hole pops and everyone can get back to what they where doing.
---
The time I’m on is a bit out of sync with the rest of my corp, I’m totally good with being alone some of the time.
---
That’s kinda it, lots of carefull pve, lots of scanning and going through holes, lot of stuff is situational, some times holes open to interesting places, sometimes what comes through is going to halt everything we are doing. 
---
Gotta go with the flow and bookmark the hole you came in through.
---
That's great  you Found something where you are good at
---
Nice, I run the sites so will just hoard the stuff until the changes.
---
Systems to go to:
---
Amamake, Siseide, Aset, Oyonata, Sosala, Kamela, Huola, Auga
---
If you se waypoints kind of in that order you will come back full circle to Amamake, it's the Amarr-Minmatar fw area and its less camped than Tama Caldari area.
---
Avoid coming in through Otelen-Huola if you are coming from Amarr. The Otelen gate in Huola as you jump in is often instalock camped. Your frig will die.
---
Google dotlan and bottom of main page i think you can open the map for the fw area. 
---
Much less blobby down south.
---
wtb eyebleach
---
Pull your head out of your ass. People don't like the plex prices that's why there are daily posts whinging about it, but unlike these people the majority will change the way they play. You're not willing to do either, cut back how many accounts you sub or change your play style. Ill let you get back to throwing your little pity party.
---
Listen to this guy! He knows and is producing results!
---
I agree with the fact that frig fights finish so quickly you dont even know what happend. Destroyers like Thrasher, Corax can be great fun to fly and last long enough to at least learn a lesson even if you die!
---
 For Corax fits search Blights Wretch in zkill, for that matter for great t1 lowsec ship fits his kb has a lot of different ships, just go through his losses list.
---
If you dont what that is... Its a ship worth 500 bil :)
---
Man some of you mother fuckers are talented.
---
expensive tank does that for ya. love his vids
---
Different computer so it doesn’t matter. Prove it’s not his brother playing.
---
Wasn’t that already mentioned on the official website?
---
There's nothing on the eve updates page about that
---
PIRAT
---
I must of seen that picture somewhere else then, mb..
---
This image was released here recently. Apparently it says chapter 1 in trig
---
Did blueloot inflate? no, so thats not wrong.
---
Did plex inflate? yes, also not wrong.
---
Did the cost of plexing toons compared to earlier rise? yes, also not wrong.
---
So with all the factual stuff out of the way that we can actually say true or untrue about, lets look at the opinion part.
---
He wants the Plex prices to go down so he can sustain his accounts within a given time he has.
---
How is that remotely something that can be considered "wrong"? You can disagree all day, hell i disagree with that, but it's not wrong in any way, shape or form. Please Stop blatently bashing people on a broken bias
---
One day is not good enough. 
---
Dont wait. Do it now. 
---
I know a new bro with 3 mil sp and in game for 2 months and he is smashing it.
---
Started losing 20 ships a day. Now loses 10 and kills 10.
---
Skillpoints are not a barrier to pvp enjoyment!
---
Experience and practice are key...
---
You're racist
---
I want a triglavian command ship....
---
why? if blueloot stays the same but the amount of isk for plex increases, why does this not work on plex?
---
bc my easy mind rn sees how many sotes in q c5 i need to run to maintain a toon with plex and i can confirm it was a shitload less a few years ago v0v
---
with a direct connection between shiptype and inc in every other space, this is not the case in wormhole. cant step up my crabbing with flying a super or a titan. more isk =/= more isk in reward.
---
lol @ those edits, what
---
We don't need to prove it, he did. lol
---
Wormholer here. I noticed the trend but can still keep up with my 2 accounts of which i plex one. That said more plexing accounts would probably require c5-c6 ratting.
---
as I understood it,   the WH and sig appears on the static side, but the K162 side doesnt even show up as a sig until someone travels through from the static side OR 4 hours passes from when static side spawns.
---
but I may be wrong.
---
Are you fucking retarded? an INGAME CASINO, not a RL CASINO.
---
You can't. You can either use a single cruiser (excluding T3 cruisers), or up to three frigates, but no other ship types are allowed, and you can't combine cruisers and frigates.
---
There's not a definite (i.e. CCP) answer on this. All we have are some older texts that have been somewhat confirmed in practice but due to the nature of the w-space it's pretty impossible to experiment properly. 
---
Anyways - what we (or at least I)  know so far is 
---
* you just scan and don't warp, it never spawns. 
---
* you (initiate) warp to it but don't jump it - it doesn't spawn for the next 4 hours and then has an increased chance to open on the other side 
---
* you jump it - it opens
---
Go PvP in Null you Mong.
---
hey i just wanna say thanks for giving us a million sp, even though to some people it might seem cheap it opens up a lot of opportunities for me and im sure our new chinese brethren will appreciate this as they aim to gain a foothold in tranquility :^)
---
That is really cool! Congratulations!
---
"I already have 2 exploration frigs, but the closest one is a 17 jump trip away. Looks like I'm going ratting instead" is a thought process I've gone through numerous times with Eve.
---
I'd just like to add to the P2W/premium question: even though you can technically pay for a subscription with in-game money, it takes an unreasonable amount of effort for a new player to do so - you'd need to grind for hours every day to afford it, and at that point it just isn't worth it, so I recommend heavily against it. 
---
I'd describe the alpha status (playing without subscription) as an extended free trial - there's tons of stuff you can do without needing to pay a cent, but eventually you start running into some barriers you just can't get through without a sub. But hopefully, at that point you'll have a good idea whether committing money is worth it to you or not. Also, 
---
&gt;will I be insta destroyed by someone playing this game since 2010
---
Yes, you will. But so will someone else who's also been playing since 2010. What I mean is, most of the fighting in this game doesn't happen on even ground - you aren't given the same ship as the other guy and the opportunity to fight in your own little 1v1 bubble. People will hunt you down with bigger ships or direct counters, they will bring their friends, and if you seem dangerous enough they will summon capital ships to help them. There's a saying in this game that goes something like, "if you ever find yourself in a fair fight, you've already messed up". 
---
Most fighting is about preparation, and doing whatever you can to give yourself an unfair advantage. If you do that, and the other guy doesn't, then it matters very little how long either of you have been playing.
---
mom get the camera i'm famous!
---
thanks mate, though i gotta say that's already kind of what i am doing (re: going out there losing ships), maybe not too intensively but as much as i can handle
---
what i appreciate most in the video is the hunter instinct- the guy sees a naga 150 km off gate but doesn't think "shit i'll get sniped" or "well he's going to warp anyway", he sees the opportunity for a kill. another comes in, oh is he 10 km off, thanks for the second free kill lmao. this is what i try to emulate when going into null, but often my confidence isn't well placed or the lack thereof costs me kills. i don't doubt he feeds any less than me (repairing scram while slingshotting is 400 iq plays imo) but i'm still yet to achieve this kind of perspective.
---
this updog mentality is what i'm all about
---
&gt; I know a new bro with 3 mil sp and in game for 2 months and he is smashing it.
---
does he fly thrashers
---
Thanks,  
---
I downloaded and loaded my character in. Works great!
---
No it doesn't
---
They rot real fast unless they are properly stored and can't last more than a couple hours en transit. Donald McDimwitts decided to make all avocado trucks be inspected manually by customs agents who shutdown the refrigerated container because and I quote "Keeping the engine on while parked is against the law". Normally we would just move them in uncovered pickups which is now imposible as a manual inspection of a pickup warranties all of them rot. Refrigerated ensures about 75% survive.
---
Plex inflation has gone up yeh, but thats different from normal inflation. 
---
The fact that he doesnt see it worth it to play without 3-4 accounts thats his opinion which isn't really based in any facts. So i didn't argue against that.
---
Ships *are* cheaper than they were 2 years ago, its why I don't bother building them any more. I've never been bothered trying to plex my account but as I only have one, I don't have any issues with paying real money for it.
---
Haha you know him to the... The bow infamous "always asking a question in bsb chat" Samuele KLSM
---
Link ur kb - some of us here might be able to advise.
---
Incursion rats are too op. Try belt ratting bestowers.
---
I also want plex to go up as I'm sitting on a stack of them I sunk my spare isk into recently. Once I've offloaded them the price can fall off a cliff so I can buy more and repeat the process.
---
Absolutely. The AC thrasher is a beast. I just wouldn't go arty thrasher.
---
You can scan it and warp to it buy I believe until you Crack it it isn't open which is why you roll your home hole when you are planning to clear it so you just have to watch for new incoming sigs
---
Dude we ain't buying that shit
---
Samuelle right?
---
He only flies thrashers lmao.
---
exactly, and when there are more accounts that want to be plexed and less account willing to buy plex, prices increase.
---
I literally 0.1 ISK people IRL now and handle goods movement between warehouses. Its just like having my 50 POS moon goo empire back, except I actually get paid.
---
Multi boxing was a mistake.
---
New triglavian Capital ship under construction? Can be found in some T5 abyssal sites i think.
---
Gonna have to wait for CCP to announce it.
---
To be honest we don't know yet. But what we do know is that we are going to be getting triglavian incursions in the future, and normal incursions feature a supercarrier as the final boss. It looks like this new ship we've seen being built is the final fight of the new invasion content.
---
Wooo cool. No cares
---
Hello dear CEOs and Directors.
---
Our alliance is currently recruiting corporations to join us in our shenanigans. Dont turn away and see who we are and what we bring to the table:
---
We are a freshly formed alliance that consists out of mainly two larger groups of people that come from multiple alliances. Since our leadership has bonds that reach multiple years back, we decided to now merge together under a new name to fullfill the plans that either of us had: To build a strong and independent SOV-alliance that provides home and stability for all members and that delivers good content and a rich environment for members and corporations within our alliance.
---
As full patch of the so called Winter Coalition, we are currently sitting in detorid with full access to all of the coalition space, moons, etc… Keepstars, Sotiyos, capital and supercap production are available and we are looking for people to want to get involved.
---
The focus of our more than 100 active heartbeats in alliance that are spread out between EU and US timezone is currently PvP although we do have a dedicated group of miners and industrialists. For people and corps that are aiming to build something that they can call ‘their home’ and to have an impact on direct alliance business, this is a great place to be. We do give the chance for everyone to have an impact and to be part of this alliance, while it is establishing their name withing the coalition and the regions around detorid.
---
Of course we can also come along with the regular offers in NS: There is SRP, yes. Up to Titans. Even rorquals, if fitted correctly. Alliance fleets, Coalition fleets, content around the clock. Good ISK-making possibilities because of the high valuable NS access we do have and also relatively low taxation.
---
Beside all the freedom and opportunities we offer, we also do have expectiations to fellow CEOs and directors:
---
We are aiming for healthy and growing corporations. The focus is not that important since we are improving all kinds of stuff we do. Of course we do need combat pilots, everyone does. But we also need someone who takes care of the production, someone who goes mining. A healthy alliance needs healthy members and healthy members means rich members. :wink:
---
The activity tho is the important part. Participation is the key. On the one hand, we do have a very short chain of command: Alliance Exec -&gt; CEOs. That’s it. This means you guys need to run your corporation. We do not want to disrespect CEOs as leadership position by starting to run their corp for them. You are the boss, you decide what happens in your corporation as long as you guys do stuff within our alliance reglementations and your actions do not have direct impact on our alliance. As soon as alliance business is involved, involve the alliance leadership as well and everything is fine.
---
We also made the experience in the past, that very small corps will have a very hard time reaching the level of independance that we are looking for in a strong corporation. This is why we are aiming for corporations with around 20+ active heartbeats.
---
If you are smaller, dont worry. We usually find solutions for this. Either we find a good fit for you and your friends within one of our existing corporations, or maybe you have some friends that you can convince to join your corp before you apply to us? Possibilities might be there, dont hesitate to contact us.
---
If you guys have any questions or want to have more details on how we are running things, what the situation within our group is or if you want to hear some of our leadership dudes to convince yourself that we are not just delivering promises but also action, reach out to me.
---
To be honest, i am not reading forums every day so i
---
Darvo Thellere 1 (EU)
---
or
---
Justin Starr (US)
---
Best regards and i hope we will have a good place for your corporation to call home. o7
---
&gt; My opinion is that the sky is fucking red.
---
Well that likely means you are color blind. Does it mean your "opinion" is wrong ? No, you see it red, so if means for you it's red.
---
Or maybe it's sunset.
---
Or maybe you just realized that "blue" is the color of solar light diffracted by atmosphere and thus, you believe the sky should be red for whichever reason (rust from satellites ?)
---
This, stop saying people are wrong when they just have a different opinion.
---
I don't like being rubbed the ear, so you tell me I am wrong ? Fuck you ! I won't let anyone close to my ear.
---
Also, that's the retardness that makes people feel obliged to conform to average social behavior and make them live a sad life.
---
ohhh man, you have no fucking idea...
---
Yes, the reason why players stay is because they have huge possibilities. HOWEVER, if you start, you don't need, no you don't WANT to be able to do everything. Because you simply can't. You cannot fit a ship properly that you can do anything useful. You have 100 possibilities to earn isk, but you have no idea what fits to you and how it's done. Etc. 
---
Eve is overwhelming, and I wonder if you simply forgot how it was when you started. But apparently you don't...
---
Also, you may have not realized, Eve is a PVP heavy game but it's NOT a PVP shooter that is delivering you what you want at every moment, it's a world. And eve is obviously not what you were looking for. but many ppl (like me) eve is exactly what they are looking for. But to get to the point that you can actually utilize these enormous possibilities many already left again.
---
Just a little thought for you, IF what mean is correct. Why do most new players stop play after 1-5 days? (Info from CCP) They are for sure not at the level of content you describe.
---
Thanks for the free advertisement 👍🏻
---
AFAIK the loot of frigate abyssal  is exactly the loot of cruiser abyssal, times 3.
---
&gt; Technically when you PLEX you indirectly spend $20 for a subscription.
---
NO.
---
Technically, "someone" spent $20 for the sub, not you.
---
People who only plex their account don't spend any money to CCP.
---
Because plex is not a core part of game play. It is not an expectation that you should be able to purchase plex as an alternative to paying a sub. It is a bonus.
---
The day ships and modules become difficult to purchase while using sleeper blue loot (and static isk returns in general) as income, then we have a problem.
---
They still are not allowed to do it. 
---
People usually are okay with respecting rules, even if they can't be caught breaking them. That's because they know that not doing so participates in the fall of the game.
---
&gt; to fullfill the plans that either of us had: To build a strong and independent SOV-alliance
---
&gt;instantly joins a coalition.
---
not quite sure that independent means what you think it means.
---
you can easily do over average 100M/h in HS too.
---
If only this was true for the most common ratting ship in the game.
---
Don’t remember if this is from the most “current” notes on the matter, but wormholes have a chance of of opening every few minutes once they have 15 hours remaining.  For 24 hour holes, you can safely leave them rolled for up to 9 hours, but 16 hour holes can only be safely left for an hour. Always believed you could warp to it, just couldn’t jump through it (which would cause the K162 to populate).
---
lol such a sad, toxic, butthurt person..   
---
Good bye my dude, I hope we never meet in any game we play and sure as hell not in RL (although I meet the archetype more often than I'd like tbh).   
---
For what it's worth - at least your post (and potentially your entire existence) can be used as an example of how you should not be as a person: entitled, whiny, rigid, etc.
---
For me its red but in reality its not, its blue.
---
All leadership in the game morale posts during long wars. Morale wins wars. Its human nature to make excuses and complain. Here's a few question for you. Why do the Chinese alliances feel they need to bot so hard? Who actually believes Black Legion wydotted for good fights? Theres a load of kool aid for you.
---
I played eve for around half a year. I liked this game and i was buying game time for 2 accounts. But after this time i left this game because to have fun in this game you have to have huge wallet. If you can't earn money, you better stop playing and i did it. Play in a way that you only fight for money all the time is borring, i change game and i'm happy😊
---
how do you know the reality besides what you can observe of it ?
---
Pretty interesting change, feel there’s good and bad with it.

T2 ships seem more expensive though
---
Since the existence of plex, they were an alternative. This is the reason why oeople calc stuff in plex in their head, it is this core value in eve that helps you calc RL worth of ingame items. I do disagree with the thesis that plex doesnt matter. I do understand tho what you say but living in a wh space is more than just having one toon that can afford a megathron. This is the space where i relied most on my alts in my eve time. I do not know longterm wh citizens that only have one alt.
---
Beside that i do agree that WH incame is still enough to buy ships. So is HighSec eben if income in HS is generally apeshit. I do say that in space where caps and supercapa equal higher income, i see how wh peeps might feel punished. because there is simply no way to increase income except more toons on grid that cost plex in return.
---
The hac looks p nice. Vedmak is already great so I’ve got p high hopes for the t2 badboy.
---
By others telling me im wrong, as colour is something scientifically verifiable. 
---
You could look at the light spectrum and see its not in the red range and in the blue range.
---
Loki doesn't have a point range bonus. He has a lock time. You overheat, you burn away from his ass, then you let him web you into warp before he can point. Barring odd circumstances this works.
---
It's real simple. If you aren't having fun in something that should be fun, then don't do it. Probably sunk cost fallacy doing its thing.
---
I don't mind paying actual money for my accounts, but then I grew up in a time where paying for your subscriptions was kinda the norm.

---
Thanks for sharing your experience.
---
I tried this game back in 2007, I bought the 3 months subscription, I used one and wasted the other two, I was in hi-sec playing alone... It was boring as hell... but the seed was planted in my mind... 
---
When this is Eve trailer was released that seed grown immediately, that trailer was so powerful, so beautiful I can't resist, I started the game again but this time I promised myself I will not play the game alone, I will enter a nullsec corp and I did it as soon as I finished the starting tutorial: it was the best choice I ever made in the game and I strongly recommend it to any new player.
---
Since them many things happened, so many deployments with some of the biggest alliances, WWB, evictions, entire regions conquered, judgment day, then back in the CFC family again.
---
I made two accounts and always played in the old way, trying to do anything the game has to offer.
---
No injectors, many multi character trainings to reach all the objectives I wanna to achieve, patience and careful planning.
---
And that's the most beautiful thing of the game, set ambitious objectives and reach them after so long. 
---
That's a thing that injectors cannot buy, something that you will never feel if you use injectors.
---
PS: just a note for CCP.
---
This is Eve trailer was so powerful and pushed so many people to join the game because was focused on the Eve community, not Plex, stupid skins or new ships.
---
That should ring a bell...
---
I've never seen this guy before, but he has [skill](https://youtu.be/8V9SZeTBlEU?t=1288)
---
I think you might be replying to a different thread than you think you're replying to.
---
I’m scared to complain, because they won’t make the new ones better. They’ll just nerf the old ones into the ground. CCP has major issues with keeping players happy right now, I feel like not screwing this up would be a really good thing for them.
---
You said strong, independent, and winter co. Congrats on joining the 2nd largest botting coalition.
---
Thanks for stepping up! Now how about some discussion, or constructive criticism? =)
---
upvultured
---
&gt; By others telling me im wrong, as colour is something scientifically verifiable. 
---
and we get there again : how do the other know they are right and you are wrong ? You are making a circular reasoning.
---
&gt; you (initiate) warp to it but don't jump it - it doesn't spawn for the next 4 hours and then has an increased chance to open on the other side
---
From my understanding, if you initiate warp, it begins it's "random chance of opening" sequence.  Our understanding of this is if the hole has more than 12 hours left on it, don't open.  If it has 12 hours or less on it, there is a random chance that it opens that increases as time increases.  So, for a O477, it's a 16 hour hole.  The random chance won't start until 4 hours after it's spawned, while a B274 is a 24 hour hole, and that won't start until 12 hours after it spawns.
---
Honestly I think it's anticipation of stepping over the edge.  I primarily do small gang roams, which means fewer decisions for one person as you have different people scouting, scanning, protecting the rear,etc.  Going out to kill solo concentrates the split second decisions on one person.  So yes, as you said the only way to start is going in head first but taking that initial step makes me nervous.
---
I keep smiling while watching this but I am really curious why that guy was so surprised and didn't believe anything.
---
&gt;Skill extracting should nearly pay for an alt.
---
This is actually a very large part of the problem. The gigantic amount of plex consumed by skill farming is largely responsible for the incredibly high price of plex.
---
Grtz man. When i joined my main goal was to be on those big battles. I bought my bus two years ago and it almost got destroyed in X47. I think it received more than 35 dds. From that day on my bus is mu favorite ship!!! Hope you can be part of big battles with your avatar!!!!
---
Now that is awesome. Who said games were useless? ;)
---
All battlereports. I am unable to move any corp/alliance
---
It's gonna show you who's the boss of this constellation
---
What I think should happen is that in high sec, lowsec and nullsec asset safety should work in a way where you have to manually put items in asset safety in order to have them saved. This gives smaller groups the chance to safely extract assets from their citadels if they get steamrolled by
---
Bigger groups whilst this mechanic is more rewarding for groups attacking big groups because they have more assets in their structures which will most certainly mean some stuff will drop.
---
it would be pretty sick if the trigs came out of abyssal traces
---
This. I just stole the clip because it’s one of our dudes he‘s fighting.
---
Yes.
---
Small and med spec are actually a pretty short train.
---
Can you fit a covert cloak and fly an Astero or stealth bomber? Ganking exploration frigates is the easiest and least-risk way to pirate IMO. Probe wormholes for relic sites, and camp it with your stealthy Astero / stealth bomber. The stealth bomber can only engage t1 frigates and cov ops, but the Astero can engage other Asteros as well. It's boring but profitable.
---
Attacking other combat ships in low sec isn't really "piracy". It's just normal pvp. In my mind, piracy is about attacking and looting helpless, high-value ships.
---
More incursions.
---
Yawn
---
Colour is determined by the wavelengths of light.
---
But whatever, you are getting caught up on the fucking hypothetical. 
---
Opinions can still be wrong. 
---
Flat Earthers, Anti-Vaxxers, Climate deniers etc etc.
---
I want to give you silverz but poor Student here 😢
---
If you're a newbie and try to solo pvp, you will be slaughtered in 95% of engagements. But there is no limit in fleet sizes, so if you join a fleet or large corporation, you'll find safety in numbers. You can grind ISK and buy skill points that'll eventually put you on par with veteran pilots when do you do want to solo.
---
So are there anyone who went from a pirate/robber/scammer on eve to real life equivalents? :)
---
Plot twist: logistics in South Africa
---
Amen
---
When I'm well over a year from flying one? Yeah, I'd rather be making ISK on the normal server.
---
And even then, if I'm gonna get one, I'll practice on the regular server...
---
It's hard to be sure about anything regarding wormholes. But with pretty much everything else related to warping to sites (ghost site timers, gas site rat timers etc) initiating warp counts, even if you cancel it. So I would certainly expect that to be the same as landing on grid in this case too.
---
&gt; And even then, if I'm gonna get one, I'll practice on the regular server...
---
You are going to make your enemies very happy. :D
---
Except for this whole thing called afk rorquals online.
---
You're implying I wouldnt know if enemies were close when I did so.
---
You're wrong.
---
I waited around 12 years to do it... Wish I hadn't waited so long!
---
The only thing that god more expensive is plex (and hulk, but that’s for a good reason). That’s not inflation, that’s deflation. Prices have dropped significantly, ships are available for less then ever, deadspace modules are aplenty at competitive prices, etc etc.
---
Which means that for the same one billion ISK people can welp more ships. Which means that people can spend less time farming and more time welping. Which is fucking good.
---
Spend ISK on losing ships in stupid and fun fights. Sub with IRL money and what you can’t afford IRL, group with other people to compensate for.
---
PLEX price rising is not an issue, it only affects one aspect of the game that people burn out over - farming for game time. Good riddance.
---
I know you're treating the goal to plex your account as a challenge, but I'd strongly suggest just paying for a sub. It changes the whole game, at least for me. Just bring your own lunch to work a few times a month, or don't order pizza one night and that's your whole sub for the month.
---
EVE is an awesome game, spend your in-game time farming isk for a nice shiny ship or 400 frigates to lose
---
sounds good i hope it isnt botched up like a few of the past things like drifters, and resource wars.
---
PvE incursions? Havent played in while and im out of the news cycle, did i miss something?
---
 Hi!
---
Triglavs are invading. Or are they just moving in the system next door to be your friendly neighbor? What is their goal? Important questions I’m sure, but the main one sounds like this: when are we going to drive that ARK?

---
Never thought that, but interesting that you think that but it's not always about goons, this was more a post because of all the VNIs-bot-posts, and propaganda against VNIs.
---
As long as you have characters with the skill points you need to do the activities you want to do with them in the game, you can just skill extract and the account(s) willl then basically pay for themselves.
---
Also... C5-C6 WHs give you up to 1 bil/hour if you rat effectively.  
---
There is a valid concern of PLEX prices reaching a point where it will just become too expensive for a lot of players. But that rarely applies to veteran players, nor WHs or high end NS.
---
I believe this is internal agency UI and not something that will be reflected to everyone. Yes I know that this is how agency works at the moment. 
---
But I believe CCP devs won’t kill exploration gameplay by making it meaningless and devaluing it. I believe that this is another thought from the devs on their effort to bring in house some of the third party applications that exist there. For example pathfinder has this feature where you see everything that you have scanned. Potentially this could be brought in house in the agency, where your analysis probing is getting automatically saved and stored in your agency. So say you log out for x,y,z reason and then you come back and the game itself keeps those data for you instead of going to third party apps.

---
Yes, it's worthwhile if the game is for you - what I mean is if you're ready to play it for the long run. It's not an instant gratification game. I've spent at least half a year trying to pvp before I actually got my first kills. Like others said - this game is complex and you need time and experience to be good at it. You will get destroyed but only in the very beginning when you don't understand jack shit about anything in the game. There's a good post made a couple days ago by a 2-3month old newbro that is now the 1st or 2nd (don't remember) in pvp statistics with a certain type of ship, which means that you won't get wrecked as much as you think. 
---
As for the pay2win - it depends on how you think about it. Yes, you can swipe your credit card and fly the most expensive ships from day one, but that just means that someone else, who knows how to actually play the game, is going to have a fun time killing you and your expensive ship. You can't buy experience in this game which is a very important thing in eve. Some people use $ to convert them into the in-game money so that they don't need to farm and grind the game in order to do what they like and I don't mind that at all. While others like to farm and grind to make money in-game. At the end of the day, eve is a sandbox mmo, which means you can do whatever you want and no, you literally don't need to sink in any money whatsoever. It all depends on what you want from the game and what are your expectations.
---
At least Detroit's benefiting from gentrification. Baltimore, not so much.
---
l wonder if thats why they couldn't stream it

&gt; Is &lt;a trig ship&gt; going to be too expensive for what it does?
---
The answer is almost always yes. Trig ships are for when you have money to burn.
---
Honestly a dozen is not enough.
---
2 months ago I bought 100 ships mostly Atrons, Merlins, Tormentors, Kestrels and some Destroyers from the Amarr market hub. I contracted it to Red Frog Freight. Google them. And I paid them 22mil isk(great value for money) to haul it to Gammel, 0.5 system on border of Bleak Lands fw area, 2 jumps from the frig pvp hotspot of Kamela.
---
You dont want any barrier to pvp, you dont want to travel with your pod back to market hub for 10 minutes, you dont want to fit a ship after each death, you dont want to travel 10 jumps from market hub to pvp area just to jump in and die in 5 minutes. Instead of 1 fight every 30 minutes if your ships are nearby you can have 3 fights.
---
Once hauled to destination you multi fit all your ships, insure them, ready for pvp. Set your home station to the station where you got it hauled. Dont have any implants in.
---
Undock a ship, roam, go in fw plexes, die, let them pod you. Back in Gammel, reship and go straight back out again.
---
I'd recommend you buy 30-40 destroyers also (armor plate Corax, shield buffer Thrasher). They have more firepower and can survive longer on the grid, giving you a chance to take a lesson from each fight.
---
Only after those 100 ships are lost you will finally start feeling like you can understand what happens during a fight.
---
To lose the pvp shakes you need to do this kind of thing. Lose a lot of ships so you dont care about the loss. Know the moment you undocked that ship is already lost. Be reckless in the engagements to start off. Be aggressive.
---
The more fights you take the more things you will notice during fight, little details that matter. You will be able to make decisions like when its a good time
---
It will also help you understand which targets you should and should not engage.
---
To begin with for the first 20-30 fights engage all T1 &amp; navy faction frigs and all T1 destroyers. You will learn a lot. After each death search on zkill for the pilot's name and see his losses. What fit does he use on that particular ship. Convo the pilot and ask him where you fucked up.
---
Also for the time you do this dont give a crap about your sec status. Just dont shoot pods and it wont drop down too much, and if you need to get it back up clone tags are cheap enough.
---
All in, the above adventure might cost you 1bil - 1.5bil but it will be the best thing you've ever done.
---
If after you lose those 100 ships you still feel like you have not improved in pvp, pm me here and I will reimburse you! lol
---
This. Sure there are supers, especially in the southeast of Branch where the big RR/SARD. home is. But there are hundreds of bot VNIs all over Branch.
---
if Rise is to be believed, then the AF is gonna get its optimal range bonus, and it should make it competitive BUT very expensive. The resist bonus &amp; ADCU give it some good staying power, but you're going to have to tank 200+ DPS for over 2 minutes to win the fight so yeah.
---
lmfao
---
i do. a lot.
---
Yes please, the qol would be amazing.
---
Are they confirmed getting an ADCU? I had heard they wouldn't be allowed to fit one and would have *different* base resists to compensate.

If I gave you a 50 mil sp pilot which would maybe take 4 years to train you would still lose each and every fight.

Yeah you will get shit on by older players, you will lose 95% of your fights in the first month or so but if you persevere that will quickly change.

Because it's just wrong. Those people are not responsible for other people to pay. You cannot give them the credit of paying when they are not. The intent they give is not "indirectly spending" money.

If that's the case then New Eden will fall. You know for a fact that nobody is ever willing to lose supers.

vv
---
I wanted to get to the bottom of the matter.
---
&gt;  living in delve 
---
why not take a leaf out of Omelca gold or whattere that guys name is, live in delve, and steal their excavators. last report he was making a decent living farming the herd.
---
This mixed with EVE players are quick to optimize and find a best solution. Unless it is truly randomized, the players will always find the most cost effective way to do anything.
---
we got EVE UNI.  both in game chat channel plus a website.
---
we used to have an in game browser.
---
and still, it didnt do it.
---
the only advice i can give to new players, is dont go at it alone.  EVE is NOT a solo friendly game. 
---
its a game where connections means everything! reaching out to E-UNI to ask questions is the best way,   and reaching out to players will usually get you good advice.  or new bro corps.
---
if you try to go solo without talking to others,  i wont say you can't....as thats how i started...but its going to be really difficult and taxing on you
---
I think you're expecting too much from this game. CCP is trying to maintain balance for a game full of min maxers. Because Eve players will always prefer to do what will make them the most money for the least effort, there will ALWAYS be an issue like vni ratting. If they need vni ratting to the point where it's no longer the preferred method, something else will take over and in time, people will complain about that method. 
---
So asking for the vni ratting issue to go away doesn't solve the problem. The REAL problem is the behaviors of the players and there's no solution for that. 
---
All you can do about vni ratting is make it easier to kill them.
---
I would always get them for Certain games, but it was more to be able to flip through monsters and artwork from the games.
---
&gt; skill farming is largely responsible
---
that and speculation. 
---
speculation is easy because CCP never allows deflation by design. if there was a long period of time where isk sinks outnumbered isk faucets (by even a small amount) then speculation on PLEX would have at least some risk. 
---
as it is now you can just buy as much PLEX as you can afford, log off for a couple of years and if you come back to the game you'll always be in a better position than if you had left all your assets in liquid ISK.
---
Covert Ops IRL lmao
---
Additionally, there are MANY ways to make good idk ratting, you only need to ask around. The appeal of the vni is the relatively low skill requirement. If you want some alternative methods of making as much or more idk than a vni, you will have to understand that you will need to be actively ratting, or earn enough skill points to get into a money making ship.
---
What is this?
---
it largely depends what you doing
---
VNI is the best income for the cost,  but its not the best income for the time spent.
---
Highsec Incursions are alot more profitable for time spent, but require more skills and expensive ships.
---
carrier ratting,  arguably lv4 security missions, and abyssal runs are all more profitable for time spent, but again, require more initial investment for ship and skill.
---
if you like ratting like VNI but your not ready to upgrade to a carrier,   Rattlesnake is an option.  again needs more skills, and is expensive.   does much the same as VNI, but with more dmg due to the addition of missiles on top of the insane drone.
---
VNI's appeal is its got alot of dps for a cruiser,  isnt expensive,  is a cruiser and so good warp and align times.   but its not the end game.   its just the mid game, where its hard to beat profit vs initial cost.
---
I love how you and I had the same exact answer.
---
Dont take away my vni ratting... I need beautiful targets for my blops
---
T R I F O R C E   P O W E R
---
Eve is like some supernatural monster every time you think its killed it rise up again.
---
I don't know what "truly" stands for, but relic site are  already randomized yet people know that sansha are better than blood.
---
No, I'm suggesting an easier way to load and unload your fleet maintenance hangar in capital ships.
---
C-J6MT fight is like Stalingrad during [Great Patriotic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War_(term)) for every russian player.
---
if you the type of player that uses a wiki you know to fucking use google
---
its so fucking beautiful ugh
---
There is potential and only providing negativity is not a good way to build a positive player developer community, something players and ccp have had troubles with in the past.
---
If you can now see what sigs are in every system, you are going to make a beeline right to the systems that have the most sigs. That is what you are looking for as an explorer. It doesn't show you what the sig type is, just the quantity in the system.
---
there will be three ores
---
[Here](https://gyazo.com/66fb05002a4a4bb96dc6184d7ad86c2f) is a link to a page in the book, it’s hilarious flipping through this
---
Yep, a friend of mine that worked with me some years earlyer was making some game with friends, so why not try it out for them and see if its worth playing, i am still here.
---
"for every russian player"
---
those who do not fall into line with communist party manifesto shall be sent to gulаg )))
---
Seeing as we have no solid details on what the Trig Invasion is like, at the moment it's rather difficult to show differences.
---
A rattlesnake or a dominix both work too!
---
Also the gila is quite servicable, and better for pvp of you get caught!
---
Exactly that, the type of individual that plays Eve will always look for the "loopholes", the most efficient way to play the game.
---
Incursions are fleet based PvE. The Sansha take over a constellation, and each system has varying strength encounters that spawn. After you defeat enough of them, the Mothership spawns. If you kill that, they are defeated and go away.
---
Trig Invasions look to be the exact same thing, only with Trigs instead of Sanshas. Except now they're making it look fancier, b/c the Gates have graphics and stuff, where the Sansha did not.
---
There is something about some Gates turning off, but I haven't heard about how or why. I suspect that will be something for LS/NS invasions, so you'd have to Cyno in instead. Or maybe they just shut down one gate, and you have to detour around to another. Although I think it would be really neat if they shut down the gate for the HQ system, and you have to clear out the others to free it up for the final boss fight.
---
So I will be able to use tech 2 crystals for faction lasers then?
---
that sounds cool, would be mental if they work toward shutting down all the gates and then the only way in is to fight your way through a A5 in one of the connected system to have it exit you in in the now cut off system, where you could then cyno in a fleet to retake the system ?
---
Wishful thinking probably but that sounds cool
---
I'm surprised you've never done an incursion since it seems all of them are spawning in test space these days.
---
How does the video prove that he is botting though? Could just as easily be a guy who foolishly made the assumption he is safe/distracted by doing something else
---
Depends how much your AWOXer in waiting likes you or not.
---
Haven't seen any trig invasion so don't know how ai would behave differently
---
Sasha incursion is basically regular complex with very very strong rats and ewar, they orbit, they switch focus once a few minutes so logi don't fall asleep. Running incursion could be interesting for the first few hours but deteriorates very quickly, at least for me
---
just never got around to it, I think im gona make the effort and look into it more tho this new trig thing has peeked my interest.
---
Some of the clips in here looked a lot like ones from This Is Eve. Was one a source for the other?
---
I'm guessing the pilot still needs the required skills to use the ammo correct? This is just for people who want to use faction guns but could already use T2 guns.
---
Seems like he had another technical issue!
---
Even if I krab autistically with only negative impact on isk faucet?
---
 Found (this)\[[https://imgur.com/a/QwbT554](https://imgur.com/a/QwbT554)\] for you. Courtesy to  [u/ZuluBaller](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZuluBaller) for uploading it

I only bought these for the final fantasy games. Wow, what an archaic book.
---
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one that dumb
---
Right, because you are my boss. 
---
The analogy was bad because you are a moron, care to go against my other points?
---
Or are you just stuck on the analogy that you cant grasp the overarching point. Probably because you lack education, or a brain, one of the two.
---
Sooo, dont give them permissions and Intel they dont need, while providing content to keep them engaged and happy.

Got it.

HEY LOOK SOMETHING THAT KINDA RESEMBLES A T-REX BETTER POST IT TO REDDIT SLASH R SLASH EVE FOR THEM DANK UPVOTES

---
please fuck off
---
lol :D
---
worked fine for me
---
Returning player here. While I only played for less than 6 months in late 2014, I just downloaded the game again and got extremely giddy reminiscing over everything and what I wanted to do before putting the game down. As it stands, I have 15.5 million skill points, 5,660 "unallocated" skill points, 760 million ISK, and a Leopard (woo!).
---
**1)** I had more ships than the Leopard before. I take it those are all gone? Starting from scratch sounds like a colossal pain (e.g. using mining to get back into the game).
---
**2)** Apparently, the Alpha clone skill point limit is 5 million and I'm over that by a factor of 3. Should I get a month of Omega now so I have access to everything right off the bat? Or do you think it best to slowly reacclimate to the environment of *Eve*?
---
**3)** Is Eve University up-to-date? I remember CCP switching to a patch model of 2/year and that's... a lot of changes (and frequently). Sifting through old/outdated information was a major pain, even back in 2014.
---
Thanks for any assistance!
---
Does anybody even do incursions tho? I’ve heard of highsec groups doing it, but not even once seen anybody trying to form up a group or anything..
---
You better invest that isk into space coke and hookers.. Ahem, I mean exotic dancers and crystalline isogen...
---
The price of plex is balanced only by other players. If CCP made the Nazori Special PVE pay out a ton more, you'd be happy for a few months and then find that everyone else was doing that thing and plex has gone up again.
---
The price of plex tends toward what an established vet player can earn in a month of grinding. Paying for two to plex the third is way less grinding than than the guys who plex all three accounts. But you're still in a rat race and if you want to play more casually you're going to have to play a lot smarter to earn more.
---
I think the thing I don't like is that out of the many many ships in EVE people tend to rat in only a few of them. It's also super disappointing that it's not just that the VNI etc... are the most optimal. It's that the many other ships just flat out suck in comparison.
---
Fortizars and cheap dreads also make dread ratting in w space easier and safer. 
---
Do that if you live in wormholes and want more isk
---
I assume it would use the drifter invasion ai. Unless they chose another one for abyss npcs but I assume those are just regular suped up rats.
---
With the dps ramps the trig ships will be terrifying in an incursion setting tho..
---
Baltimore was rapidly gentrifying when I was in school there around 2005. Did that stop?
---
again
---
blah-blah-blah, great legacy, so who's C-J6 owner nowadays?
---
In reply to your deleted message:
---
&gt; You can only keep the majority happy most of the time. There is always a minority that will harbour a need for revenge based on some small, perceived insult or just getting you blown up for the "lulz".
---
&gt; ... but hey, who needs a test server, where the ships are basically free and you can throw them away over and over again trying out different fits and tactics against humans that want to blow you up in various cunning ways?
---
The game has to make an effort to keep us playing too, something it hasn't been very successful in lately.
---
&gt; Right, because you are my boss.
---
I would not employ someone who can't accept to be corrected when he is wrong.
---
&gt; The analogy was bad because you are a moron, care to go against my other points?
---
So you made a bad analogy but then I m the one being a moron ? I guess it's a good thing coming from you.
---
But now you relying on insults tells me that it's a sensible subject for you. "don't tell me I'm wrong" . Suddenly you are allowed to not agree with someone, though they are not allowed to have different opinion. Goes into my "moron" definition pretty perfectly.
---
Dammit, Sasha
---
You are masterful at sidestepping the point. 
---
I never said someone couldnt have a different opinion, if you could point to where i said that. 
---
So yeh, are you going to argue against the multiple other points i made or again, are you just stuck on the analogy.
---
Getting caught in a ratting fit subcap is basically death, no matter what you are flying. (Unless your attackers screw it up off course. )
---
Fitting a ratting ship to do well in PVP makes it both an inefficient PVP and PVE ship. It's far more sensible to just do pure PVP or PVE fits and use them for their intended purpose.
---
Ratting is boring enough as it is. No need to force more of it on yourself just in case you do something dumb and get caught.
---
Okay I’ll be over here! But if you ever need to talk I’m here for ya! Fly Safe!
---
There are a couple of established groups, 9ne of them being Warp to Me who run incursions in highsec. Not sure on the ways they coordinate though.
---
Can we get some incursion guys in here to drop they current info?
---
It says Bee Rex under it so yeah def a dino and Bee... that was interesting... and considering I was on the side of some losses...the bandages etc... Sure, Feel free to dankly upvote.  👍
---
I wonder what would happen to ratting if you removed all these drone boats. It's funny how every single ship you mentioned has drone bonuses. Is it drones that are messing up EVE ratting?
---
You are masterful at concealing you being wrong behind personal aggression. 
---
Why are you even talking about people having a different opinion ? This is another sidestep from you.
---
We didn't break the nip bro. Stop spreading rumors. Get over your tears.
---
Because you said so?
---
So now you are either trolling or can't remember what you literally just said so yeh. 
---
Well done, mate.
---
wormholer btw
---
I like this idea.
---
Eve-uni's wiki was/is the only wiki for eve that I know of and helped me out a lot when I started playing.
---
Having a wiki that was up to date and able to be updated by a wider group than the eve-uni folks could only be a blessing.
---
Oh god. We're getting triglavian dreads and titans before angel dreads and titans? REEEEEEE
---
Your posts don't even make may sense, it's just you being insulting and uninteresting again.
---
Feel free to remain an idiot, if that's what you enjoy.
---

---

---
Says the moron who can't remember what he said five minutes ago.
---
Especially then
---
T2 ammo has it's own requirements as well.
---
Then you are potentially someone else's content. There is always a bigger krab.  
---
You make the world better by being in it.
---
lets assume they are like the drifter incursions:
---
they will be broken, and removed within a week, and we'll never hear from them again and ccp will pretend it didn't happen.
---
[As a non Russian! Party on dudes!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/39/86/f339866908ec9bb83556b39117718e32.jpg)
---
Well hopefully they're paying attention to players feedbacks.
---
Right now none of the new triglavians are good enough.
---
Let's start with what is working:
---
- New Resistance Profile: it's pretty solid with a huge hole on kinetic. 
---
What is not working:
---
- maximum damage multiplier spool mechanics: AF and HAC can reach an insane amount of DPS. True... but what's the need of that insane DPS when you need to spool up for 2 mins and half for the AF and 3 mins and half for the HAC. A frigate fight won't last 2 mins... Let's add a cruiser fight won't last more than 3 mins. So basicaly this mechanics is not going to work.
---
The right mechanics should be like the tiamat: 0.5% additional bonus to damage multiplier bonus per cycle.
---
So basicaly they should just spool up faster like 50s without that insane retard amount of DPS.
---
- the bonus to pwd should swap to an optimal range bonus like CCP Rise said.
---
- speed is pretty low compared to their t1 version
---
In details: 
---
1) NERGAL
---
The nergal is likely the worst right now. It can't shoot at more than 12km with Mystics (long range ammo). It is ridicolous. The other AFs in the game with short range ammo can apply at 20-30km. Just saying. Nergal needs at least a 20% bonus to optimal range per level to become playable.
---
Speed isn't that bad but a little boost could help.
---
It definetly needs a 3rd high slot. 3-3-4 should be the correct layout. 
---
5% bonus to damage per level couldn't be enough changing the AF/HAC bonus to spool up speed so likely 7.5% would be better.
---
Damavik is 3-3-3 so why the nergal should lost an high slot. Definetely no reason.
---
Right now:
---
Every kiting frig &gt; Nergal
---
2) DRAUGUR
---
The draugur is just bad, not bad as the nergal but definetely needs improvements. Let's start with the range. The 15% optimal range bonus is not enough. Like the nergal it should be at least 20%. It lacks the 4% bonus to armor resistances like the other command dessies. Perhaps it needs a 4th medium slot like the magus.
---
The Speed instead is really really bad. I get it should be a bit slower than a Kiki (the skirmish link will compensate) but not that much. A draugur that can't reach 2k m/s speed is just sad. It should be fast as the other command dessies.
---
Bifrost/Magus &gt; Draugur
---
3) IKITURSA
---
The Ikitursa, instead, isn't that bad. It's a bit slow but really needs more agility. 5s align is really bad.
---
Like the Nergal a 7.5% bonus to damage will be needed changing the bonus to spool up speed.
---
Like the Nergal it needs a 10% bonus to optimal range per level to be better than a drekavac (to justify at least the cost).
---
Drekavac &gt; Ikitursa
---
they literally said the ancil mutas would not be available outside of that one event where they were introduced
---
fuck you ccp
---
Been gone for a few years....  did they do away with mutual watch list add requirement yet? Aka, did  they put it back to how it always was?
---
What for all 10 players that actually were there? Russian alliances are a joke in EVE now, though that might explain why they have to take pride in events 10 years ago.
---
it's not me dipshit. i just think nullsec losers are cancer.
---
Yes, initiating and cancelling starts the timer.
---
Okay, out of the loop here, appearantly---Where is this found?
---

I’ve just decided to close my corporation after 2 years of steady success due to going back to school and making music IRL. After struggling with it for a while I’ve been feeling a lot of the same things and love this post, cheers man.

Probably missile ships with damage bonuses would become the meta since you can afk with auto targeting missiles...

prima strategy guide for starcraft &gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Honestly, from what I got to see on SISI and the hoboleaks files, it looks like it may be an interesting new twist on the basic idea of incursions that could turn out pretty awesome.
---
Yes and once again dipshit... 2 people have pointed out the people making the kill in the video are WORMHOLE PILOTS.
---
Drones don't use ammo. And they don't have the serious tracking problems many battleship size turrets have shooting the smallest targets.
---
This guy has been practically stalking me on Reddit, I think he has issues
---
All I want is 1v1 fights, but all everyone else wants is (X+1)v1 fights. :&lt;
---
All of you got it wrong; it is NOT an incursion/trig boss, but the new arena where eve players will be able to PVP in the upcoming "battle royale" expansion. You thought Dust514 was dead? Nop.
---
Gotta love that Dark Cloud 2 Guide... Maps for randomly generated dungeons, lol.

Yep.  Also carry a depot if you are hunting Abyss runners.
---
"It's easy when you know how" is the epitome of eve. And people forget that once they have known how for a long time.
---
The Imperium wants to know your location
---
One this to add, if you initiate warp to a hole, the Drifter battleship spawned from C5/6 sites can warp to the sig still invisible to players on the other side. This drifter can be combat probed in deadspace and the wh will actually be visible there.
---
There is no longer a watch list outside of fleets

Then you will be upset when you get evicted for being carebears. forgot that part.

---
Thanks, will have a look since I tried Eve and just got very confused lol, but I think I'll watch some guides on YouTube and see if I can figure it out.
---
My elections got hacked just watching this video
---
Certainly doesn't help that there are multiple wikis, which are in large parts outdated or lacking information.
---
I'm perplexed by the fact that after 15 years many sites/DED plexes still don't have guides. And many that do don't even tell you what loot drops.
---
EVE desperately needs a wowhead equivalent. A user submitted news/guide site with an attached wiki that largely depends on user comments.
---
yup
---
I'm referring to contact list and seeing if your contacts are online or not.... not fleet windows
---
Make sure you go through the entire tutorial. That will teach many basics like ship control and what the menus do, how to target, how to travel etc.
---
That really does look cool. Amazing lighting too.
---
CCP said a lot of things, you expect a company that included all members (except falcon) of their community team in a layoff to do silly things like keep promises?
---
The best part about this is that eve players have garages.... most of these post are like “found this cleaning my moms basement” or “found this while moving to college”
---
Never. Playing casually with consolidated assets, skills, and isk is magical. My character can do everything I need it to, it's trained for all subcap and capital doctrines we fly other than FAXs, as well as all isk making I need. Best of all I save a supercarriers worth of isk every year I don't PLEX an alt. (I pay for my main with money, but don't have enough to do two). With the way secondary skills boost background traits, flying a rifter or a Titan I get the same bonuses. My frig has some of the best damage, EHP, cap, agility, and fitting availability of the entire fleet because it's a maxed character. I also have a skin collection addiction, about 500ish atm, and having one character makes it possible to do. 
---
And as for in-game stuff, playing with one account let's me multibox other games. I often play EVE and stellaris at the same time, for example. And if I die blind jumping to beacons unscouted and with no cyno alt, I'll die as I lived. Having fun doing stupid shit! 
---
Playing altless has disadvantages, but with clever clone usage and training you can really push one character to the limit. My account has two other characters, one is my jita market browser, and the other a burn jita coercer pilot. That's enough for me.
---
Thanks for the new expansion release on my birthday, CCP. I was going to spend the day by the pool, but now...
---
It’s the nature of a game with a player driven economy. Why help other players make ISK when that will hurt your bottom line? Preventing other players from running DEDs helps them stay profitable for the people currently running them.
---
I mean, that still happens but any competent battleship pilot will fit neuts and webs and have small drones in the cargo. Only stupid bs pilots will actually die to frigs
---
That was an intentional change made to encourage people to rat more years ago, I don't remember exactly when. It should probably be re-locked at, but it feature, not a bug.
---
&gt; The MER is not going up in proportion to how quickly PLEX prices are going up. That means that whether it's turbo crabs in Rorquals, bots, else, it's not responsible for the big PLEX price inflation.
---
Rorquals
---
Do 
---
Not
---
Create Isk
---
But how do you know that he utilizes a farm hole?
---
he literally says alts are in separate krab hole
---
Are you kidding? There are strong career options for experts in spreadsheets online.
---
Yes devs please spend your time to integrate a wiki into the game because I lack the braincells to understand what a "google search" is. You do realise EVE was never designed as a game that holds your hand, right? From the beginning you were supposed to have some level of intelligence, good luck getting even 2019 CCP to waste time making cookies for people who can't understand the internet.
---
Lol, I don't think so, we have carebear members sure, but everyone has to jump in a combat ship if it gets hot,  we are equipped to defend ourselves, and have.
---
We have roams every now and then, strats and t3c, but just because PVP isn't the sole focus of our corp does't mean we don't want to. 
---
I think operateing across all types of space, and the fact I do shoot targets of opportunity disqualifies me as a carebear, I'm not a pirate by any means, but if I see something I want, I'll try to take it, and roll the hole behind me.
---
But I dgaf about labels, we are having FUN, going what we WANT, are you? If so I'm happy for you.
---
No sorry you miss read my intention. I mean eve is a game that people with jobs and lives actually play. I lent it as a complement to the mature playerbase
---
"benefiting"
---
Probably, that'd only make sense
---
&gt; burner missions are insane...and hold alot of risk.
---
Just no. To run burners all you need are 2 kirins and 3 daredevils. Can run it with friends to get those numbers, or multibox with eve-o preview hotkey window switcher. It’s is so fucking easy, literally pull agent/team burners in Venal, you warp in, shoot the rat, and do the site in literally a minute.
---
Venal burners are so fucking broken it’s stupid. A kirin is 3 injectors and a daredevil is 2 injectors, ships are like 100-150m. In a fleet of 5, 3 dds and 2 kirins, with a total ship cost of 750m and a total injector cost of ~13 bil, just 14 hours of mission running and I’ve made my investment back.
---
Assuming 18 bil for a super and 600m an hour (not sure what ticks are like after nerf), you’re looking at 30 hours to replace it.
---
Burners are the best kept secret in the game. Horde runs them side by side with goons. Init has some shitty little corp deployed there rn, but literally they lose ships to out of sight so they’re nothing.
---
It means there's a Triglavian invasion coming and we need to build a southern space-wall.
---
The largest sov holding alliance in the game ofc
---
I did that with my first super!
---
Im just teasing man. Im actually camping a carebear c1 corp right now... having quite a bit of fun killing them every few days. If i dont have targets i just run their relic sites and farm their static. Even got my first ghost site.... to bad i didnt know it was a ghost site and my ship blew up. Thankfully the 500 mill or so i picked up from the cans dropped and I still came out 250 mill ahead. 
---
I also have a sweet ass t1 frig a probe launcher as i bought the first ship i could find to get my loot but forgot to bm the exit. MAD DASH to go get my loot. 
---
so yes im having fun :P
---
You are wrong
---
No, you cannot see if someone is online unless they want you to be able to, except by running a locator on them and flying to their system to see if they’re in local.
---
You'll never take me alive!
---
TRI conquered the system in mid 2018, but then something happened (wasn't playing EVE at the time, but severe problems in TRI alliance leadership I think) and skill urself took over towards the end of 2018. They still hold it.
---
Never balance around isk
---
Station containers? No. But if you jettison a packaged container it's the equivalent of anchoring it. You won't ever be able to pick it back up again though. 
---
I use them in my pos for storing ammo and stront for my dreads then another with spare pos fuel. I doubt you'd need to use a station container.
---
1. Have you checked your asset window for stuff you have in other stations? Even if all you have is the leopard and 750m, that is more then enough to fund a decent ISK making venture. The leopard is worth around 100m, and the ISK you have is enough to do anything from T3 abyssal sites, to C3 WHs, to a budget incursion ship. Exploration and VNI ratting are also options to make ISK that are incredible inexpensive, the VNI costing about 60m, and an exploration ship can be as cheep as 1m. You have more then enough to make SIK outside of mining in a venture
---
2. Alphas can only train up to 5m SP, but has access to about 20m SP. Some of your skills are probably locked to omega, but that is mostly things like caps, cloaking, T2 ship, and barges. You can definitely fly around and have fun as an alpha pilot. You will also be locked out of LVL 4 missions, so you won't making ISK that way.
---
3. There is definitely out of date info in the EVE-Uni wiki, but it is 90-95% accurate. The faster release schedule also means less per release on average, so that isn't a major issue for the wiki. Also, its now a  patch model of 1/month, not 2/year.
---
No they didnt add back OP free intel
---
no
---
I’m not very blinged but I’m hoping as I upgrade I can fit the drone augmenter. (Don’t have the CPU) I’m running a small NOS right now to fill the slot but also because when being neuted anything helps to get the power back..
---
but if i open up google i have to look away from my 20 rorqual alts and 5 supercarriers, making this addition would keep to the spirit of the game!
---
Its not a bad idea, but your drone control range will suffer as a result. Some sites the Trig battleship is quite a bit off the last gate - and without the drone link you'll have to burn towards him (mitigate transversal), kill him, and then burn back to the gate - which all takes time. 
---
The nos will help in a holy shit situation like a really bad neuting spawn that you don't play right and burn straight into all the neuting ships. Might save your whole setup in a situation like that. If you play the spawn right and kite out the webbing ships and kill them, then keep your distance from the neuting ships - you might be able to compensate for the lack of a nos by flying right. This is usually the highest chance you're going to die is get neuted out (assuming you have the right fit and high-grade implants)
---
I highly recommend getting some mindflood and keeping it in your cargo (don't roll the dice unless you need to). In a bad cap scenario take the mindflood - also might save your whole set up, but has a chance to affect your booster amount and your explosion radius - which is why I wouldn't take it unless I had to. 
---
My gila loss was because I didn't play the room right, burnt into a bunch of webbing ships and neuting ships (killed them all) but then didn't have enough cap to cycle my booster constantly and died to the trig battleship. If I had mindflood I might've lived. If I cycled the afterbooster and got transversal instead of focused on the shield repper I might have been able to sig tank him. Either way, hindsight is 20/20 I died and lost the pod : )
---
I found the isk to be very underwhelming anyway, and the risk too high.
---
I dont have experience with any of the other groups, but warp to me is great. This guide has all the information you need to get started. There are also a few youtube videos of people running the sites if you want to see what it's like. https://forums.warptome.net/topic/301-rookie-guide/
---
Cool, happy hunting, if you live in a wormhole you get got every once in a while, loss and profit, it's nature.
---
Careful for ghost sites, the cans will kill you and then the NPC response fleet comes in, I think you can tank the can blowing np in a Strat if you have Amarr cruiser IV.
---
And so, what if there is an optimized way?  Its a game, do what you want, try something out.  When I ran L4 missions and got bored with it, I tried to run it in Tengus, then in a Jackdaw or whatever I had lying around. Sure, it wasn't perfect (and sometimes quite scary) but it was a challenge and fun to try a new method.
---
It should be "jitra tradel"
---
This is far larger than any Titan or Dreadnought lol - if anything, I'm thinking it's more of a Mothership type thing than a combat cap.
---
And then cry as your machine no longer boots.
---
I almost want to stop everything else to help this person, this is something else.
---
You havent replied to their follow up post. Is it cause you concede defeat or are you typing up a masterpiece? 
---
I hope its a masterpiece
---
Honestly just adding a combat section to the tutorial videos that covers things like explosive velocity, optimal range, tracking, ect. Would go a long way.
---
Also you know actually integrating these videos into the tutorial would be nice to. Since I just spun up a fresh alpha and was never directed to them at all.
---
Its all demand for plex atm alot more people are plexing than were before im sure. so rather becoming the plex buyer become the seller easiest way to get rich quick
---
Protip: EVE is really picky about disconnections.
---
Set your device to use only one network type (3g/4g). The device swapping between 3g and 4g can be enough to cause EVE to disconnect.
---
More often than not those google results will return wrong/outdated/incomplete information.
---
?
---
Nothing is more chill than hisec missions / ratting in an auto jackdaw
---
**1)** Didn't even register to check that as I was combing through some old mail and trying to readjust to the "Wow" factor, lol. But it's all there! I would never sell the Leopard, anyway. Pretty sure it's still the fastest ship in the game. I just hope that doesn't make me a target still, lol.
---
**2)** Yeah, I think I'll stick to Alpha until I can get back into the swing of things. I believe the only things I really miss out on are training level 4/5 skills while I get back on the horse.
---
**3)** Holy shit. 1/month now? And how often do they release the big "expansion packs" (or whatever they're called), then? I'm assuming not once per month.
---
Our pleasure, friend. Thank you for flying!
---
That's why the playerbase cannot be expected to do everything. Stuff like DED guides, wormhole site guides, etc won't gain you any significant following and will more than likely get lost in the mess of russians and their FUCKING 10 YEAR OLD TENGUS AND HARDBASS AND ANIME GIRLS AND 10X SPEED AND OH MY GOD FUCK THOSE VIDEOS
---
True for ratting I spose, but not for any production or loot. Prices can still rise with the market for any other object sold by players, but if the only way to sell is to NPC's then the item essentially has no demand and will never rise, or fall for that matter.
---
Yeah the skull and cross bones on the site shoulda been a give away that i needed to research ahead of time.
---
It would be cool if the Triglavian ship is equipped with a star buster weapon. A little editing of New Eden's geography might change things up a bit.
---
I really like using a tractor beam in the Gila high slot honestly, you can pop the can and make minimal deviation from your normal route and not have to burn back to the can before heading back to the gate. Saves a ton of time if you have drone range to at least 40km. Overheat the AB if you feel you need to catch a kiting/damping ship.
---
This is eyebleach, Got two types of hot going on.
---
Can you post this fit, plz?
---
I've never heard of such a thing.
---
I can just spend my money on a game that doesn't obfuscate the most basic of information instead if that's what CCP would prefer.
---
Ok but if a PvE video is in Russian you know it is going to be the best way to do the given site lol
---
There is no set schedule for "big" patches, but we do have one coming on the 28th. There is a ship, the Pacifier, that can get a faster warp speed then a leopard, but it needs to be fit specifically for it. Also, the leopard is a gank target for thrashers, so be very careful with it near trade hubs.
---
So true.
---
Looks like a true *Mother Ship* class vessel
---
That’s what I’m calling it from now on, you’ve spawned a new name
---
&gt;More often than not those google results will return wrong/outdated/incomplete information.
---
wholly incorrect
---
I wonder if anything like this has been thought of before?
---
Look up delonewolf on youtube, hes got some vids about it
---
Yeah I'm sure every suggestion every player gives needs to be reviewed through archives to make sure no one ever had the same idea. What a pedantic and petulant way of thinking.
---
I'll support it as long as the Triglavians pay for it
---
This one
---
And after DT, when the systems are not ready/loaded.
---
Maybe CCP will start the servers with inactive stargates in the future \*g\*
---
That would be the install step
---
I worked in freight forwarding for a bit. I mentioned I played Eve.
---
The two events are unrelated.
---
Had to be sure r/Eve didn't just have a pleasant thread huh?
---
Then do. The internet exists, other people can (and by the game's design, should) be spoken to. EVE was never intended to feed you everything you need, sweetie.
---
Ignoring the afk ability of drone boats as a whole cuz thats the real problem.. But then as another mentioned we would move to auto targeting missiles then..
---
The VNI doea a superb amount of dps with heavy and sentry drones. Like max is a standard ratting fit is 700ish before you need to bling. Max skills n such. 
---
The issues is really that the VNI just out classes everything else.. It needs a hard nerf.  Like remove a heavy drone kinda nerf. Why does the myrm get less drones than VNI?
---
We as players will always find the lazyest way to rat as possible. Making content un afkable is really the solution but thats not CCPs way.
---
Ahh, the good old days when every character looked like the result of millennia of inbreeding.
---
I assume care about every device blog since it's an opportunity to ask about the lowsec gate to Stain...
---
1 video of 1 encounter like you posted is not definive proof.  If you had several encounter's of different pilot's or this one all doing the same thing then I will give your evidence more weight.
---
bur are they worth it? I've always wanted to exclusively fly an AF for everything even if its impractical but I havent landed on one yet.
---
1 video of 1 encounter is not proof. It's evidence. Multiple videos can be combined into proof. You have not done that here.
---
:)
---
Goons build one in a day. Jump it across New Eden. Deploy in NC staging. BOOM! NC deaded... goon ark deadeder. Eve servers smoking. Reddit on fire. Mittens smug posting on twitch.
---
hmm mgood ppoint
---
Aww man &lt;3
---
Send me your Love and I'll double it.
---
Thrashers? Also, damn. I was hoping that, after 5 years, I'd be relatively safe flying in the thing. lol
---
Any tips, in that regard? I think I'm closer to Dodixie than Jita, for some reason (and I'm Caldari). Not sure I want to run into that many people after not having played for so long, anyway.
---
I mean, one doesn't really benefit from gentrification. I mean, I guess the city in the abstract becomes wealthier, but the residents move out so they don't see it.
---
I generally balance by flinging my arm around another drunk person and singing all the way home.
---
Thanks for the advice though, one to avoid.
---
you too can make 5bil/hour in one of our wormholes! choose from a wide selection of over 100 C6 holes for just under 10bil a month! contact any hard knocks member (but not leadership or diplomats - they will scam you) in game for more info!
---
That's awesome, kestrel (cargo) XD
---
Those pages are gold!
---
Yeah I'm sure every suggestion every player gives is high quality and not retarded shit because they're a miniature dumpster fire that needs everything handed to them.
---
Bots are a larger issue then krabs
---
I am allergic to spring, sunshine and happiness. /s
---
I know where op is coming from and I share the sentiment to an extent. After all, the only reason I keep returning is because I find a place where I matter. But you have to acknowledge that there's fewer and fewer of us left, and sadly it's not just a big coincidence. I want to relive the glory days of EVE as much as you do.
---
Correction, there's always an octopus preying on the krabs.
---
bots are content too
---
The funny thing about those glory days is without nostalgia glasses they sucked. Eve has been dying forever based on what I'm always told in my time playing it but it's still trucking along. Maybe if a portion of us tried to spread some cheer in the community instead of waiting for the world to end it would spread and we'd all be having a great time!
---
Seems bulky and unnecessary. But if you want to hold hands and put a big yellow questionmark on quest items and objectives, then yes this is the way to go.
---
Strat with Amar 4 is a way to tank it, the way I am set up for ghost sites is a shield Loki, it tanks them ok
---
Preach ✊🏻
---
But auto targeting missiles pay a massive damage per second penalty, so there is a trade off. The drone boats within EVE not only allow you to pay less attention, but they also out damage ships within and above their class. Like you said, 700dps maxed out from a VNI is just insane, its not even Navy Issue or T2. Whats even more shocking is the Ishtar isn't really that much of a step up, you're talking marginal DPS increases when you account for the VNI not having any survivability issues in the first place. 
---
As much as I like how easy it is to multibox VNI's and make ISK I really want to mix my game up more. I feel EVE gets boring if you continue to do the same things, but 50% of your drive has to be influenced from ISK/hour to sustain income for operations and more risky content. Its really just about leveling the playing field on drone boats in general. 
---
I feel drone boats, like auto targeting missiles should pay massive damage per second penalties when compared to ships that require more active attention. This principle is true in many aspects of EVE it just feels like drone boats have slipped through the cracks for to long.
---
Still bitter?
---
I strongly agree. Bots will be the death of the game, at least for me when we see coalitions fielding entire Titan fleets out of no where.
---
They have the same cap recharge time as their t1 counterparts while all the other hacs have 187.5
---
Can confirm, am only in a corp for the voice comms, most of the time I am lost in another wormhole or running missions. Solo is fun until it isn't.
---
Honestly give it one to two years and we will be at that point
---
They have only become more valuable since you left. If you want to be safe just don't take it into the trade hub station, and avoid Niarja, Perimiter, and Udama, as that is mostly where you will see thrashers on gates. You can still get ganked else where, but leopards are mostly a target of opportunity that only some people gank. You may get ganked elsewhere, but it is unlikely.
---
You literally cite action taken against bots in a post asking if CCP is doing anything about botting. :bigthink:
---
The reason botting is rampant is because the PVE content is bland and repetetive. Its boring and robots don't get bored. CCP would only be able to stop it by 1) making PVE more engaging by completely changing it or 2) making most PVE gated to Omega accounts only.
---
Neither of these things would happen.
---
&gt; Current State of EVE Online
---
this gonna be good
---
I don't kill supers, so that nerf didn't really affect me in the intended way... but thank you
---
Behavior of players is driven by balance, I don't expect a perfect situation with perfect balance. But similar MMO's have had these issues before, as an example if you're playing another MMO and a class is 4x quicker to level. Then I can almost guarantee you will see a higher percentage of that class in the game which then makes it more difficult to match make content. 
---
If EVE finds that 95% of all EVE players are using the same 2-4 ships for Ratting I feel they should do something to encourage a more diverse playing field. It makes it more boring for PVE players, it makes PVP more predictable and markets become less diverse for Industry demand.
---
\*for the 80 Russian player
---
Banning a couple bots literally solves nothing they can just buy new accounts and do the same
---
Judgment Day is already reserved...
---
so with one hand you complain ccp do nothing, with the other you recognise they're actively combat botting.
---
are you retarded? because you're literally complaining about them not doing the thing you acknowledge that they are doing.
---
Banning a couple bots literally solves nothing they can just buy new accounts and do the same faster then they get banned *big think*
---
I think you missed his point entirely. There needs to be an anti botting system or feature in place. Otherwise people will continue to roll out new botting accounts once their old ones have been banned.
---
what do you want them to do, then?
---
ccp are actively removing bots, what more do you want them to do? seriously.
---
Ehh, Planetside2's NPE is worse.
---
Eve just compounds the issue with the bredth of content
---
I have not been running sites higher than level 3 yet, since I am using a budget fit Gila. I have found using an MTU is extremely effective for pretty much the same purpose.
---
Developed an actual strategy and implementing it to counter bots instead of banning a few accounts every months and making a big deal of it
---
Then they probably didn't take the time to read it eh? It took me many years to get to the point I am in terms of knowledge of the game.
---
counter them by removing them from the game?
---
the very thing they're already doing.
---
If I'm not mistaken, I think you can check the contents of the asset safety wrap if you go to Personal Assets &gt;&gt; Search.
---
I've *still* got my guides for the Elder Scrolls games on the shelf all the way up through *Skyrim*
---
Sooo... do we actually know what it is? Not just copypasted incursions i hope - something that actually changes the rules
---
Oh boy, FOB's?
---
I don’t think you understand banning them isn’t solving anything
---
Oh I completely agree. But they need to watch it cuz they will just nerf drone dps again thinking its the problem lol. Its the ones that have 50% dmg or more on them. The whole gurista line is retarded.  Entirely plays into afk gameplay.
---
To be clear DRONES are fine Drone BOATS are the problem. Cuz drones dont really do shit unless bonused. Like a VNI or so on.. Even the ishtar isnt a super big problem when you compare like you said to the vni its a marginal increase in dps. A major one in tank and fitting if I recall tho but it should have 5 heavies not the VNI.. Its silly that a cruiser can wield 5 Heavies.. I wanna say its the only one in the game sub T2. I think the closest is the standard vni ffs.. Take away 25mbit already ccplease.
---
Triglavian sotiyos?
---
I usually smack a faction medium nos. A medium nos can support Shield hardeners infinitely 
---
I used this for a long time. Unless I did some stupid shit with arranging the tank there was no room which just outright killed me. Only problem is when you get 3 Battleships in a row. Then skills and overheating is needed due to a bit lower dmg and thus time out.
---

---
Well, for a normal AF the cost of the t1 frigate that's part of the build is basically zero. Taking a Wolf as an example, the rifter costs 300k, the rest of the materials about 30mil. The rest of the price comes in the invention cost of the blueprint (less than a mil afaik) and the seller's profit. All of that is very rough, but you get the idea.
---
For the trig AF, the cost of the base ship is *not* negligible - it's about 60 mil right now. The gun is another 60 mil, if it's got the same t2 component costs that's another 30 mil, and then the blueprint is probably *not* going to be under a mil per unit. It depends, I guess, if a 200 mil AF is 'worth it' for you. Personally, I'll buy 4 wolves instead.
---
reskinned sansha incursions. yay.
---
Lore wise its a ship but how it will function in game it will prob act like a structure
---
Dont fly a passive gila, you will lose it sooner or later. Or if you have to take it to T3 max
---
It is a ship, But will be acting as the Mother ship equivalent of the Trig incursions whilst also being unkillable and sitting in one spot in the main incursion system, Thus has been put into the files as a station (Static object) instead of a ship (Movable object)
---
THis is bait, this must be bait. 
---
That was a cap roam and after noone came to fight us we did a thunderdome. After most things were dead, we saw a frat fleet incomming so we SD, only a few got even shot by frat if you check killmails.
---
please ignore
---
Funny how Nancy dock runs to the forums since they can't do anything in game
---
Image a Trig titan that can open a portal to stain, from ANYWHERE in eve

Imagine having so many blues that the only people you can fight are your own alliance

I'd love to see it say "The best mining ship is the Rokh."  Ahhhh good times.
---
Slappin' bitches like it's going out of style.
---
None came to fight us = sd as frt fleet is 3 jumps out LOL.
---
After we killed all Faxes, most of our carriers and subcaps, weird huh?
---
Googled how to roll a wormhole, this is what I got. Very useful and accurate information!
---
```Show info is your friend. Assuming your hole can put a hot rolling bs through it, (and the exact specifics depend on the type of hole) you generally do hot-hot passes until it goes stage 2. After that go cold-hot until it goes VOC. If it goes VOC when you jump cold, good! When you jump back hot it should collapse.```
---
The next result involved Orcas.
---
When looking up on EVE-Uni wiki it only had information on rolling a 2b hole, which while accurate missed out 3b and 1b holes, which are both extremely common. It also randomly discussed things in terms of eggs for some reason?
---
The correct information is this, could not find it anywhere within the first few google results: https://puu.sh/lmgOg/7b81b2d566.jpg
---
AAR or riot
---
So, last time i played wass early 2012. I remember wormholing but other than that i barely remember other aspects of the game.
---
I havent redownloaded yet and work 60+ hours a week. Any suggestions where to start reimmersing in the game?
---
If I recall, I have an Abaddon, Damnation and Absolution among other small ships (assuming I can get all my stuff still from so long ago) and my training was fairly focused on those ship classes / tanking methods etc. 
---
If anyone has a link to a decent video to give a run down, very much appreciated. I am still looking into the game and researching just at a loss on how much has changed
---
Shoot the tower. This is your 2-3min bio break.
---
We were still taking quite some time to break the carriers that got caught out, but okay buddy whatever you say
---
Detroit isn’t really benefiting. It’s just pushing poor people out.
---
So what you are saying is you dropped 100 caps in some backwater lowsec before tackling anything and were surprised you got no kills?
---
ratting in eve is mostly about ROI. Yes a supercarrier can get much better ticks than a VNI. The VNI pays for itself and you start making money on it after like 1 hour of ratting. The supercarrier does not. Same concept for Marauders, Rattles, etc
---
Nuffsaid
---
TAPI spinning harder than the earth.
---
was a good fight. GE fc here. we werent expecting the blob of lokis and munnins. we still dont know who ref'd it. just found the timers while scanning chains and decided to third party. cost us 8 bil but vOv. good fight volta and hole control.
---
even lowsec????????
---
We were roaming for literally hours, our fleet was no secret. Yet FRT magically shows up right after we decide to thunderdome?
---
&gt;OP's Flair: Fraternity.

Funny how you guys just lost 2:1 caps to muninns lol !!!
---
Yikes.
---
uhm... hrm
---
even TAPI is kicking TAPI's ass now?
---
Eve has one of the worst information databases in any game imo.
---
No one single, comprehensive wiki, most Google searches bring in year old information, very little information in game for a lot of things.
---
It is pretty awful relative to pretty much any other game.
---
Self Destructing 100B in caps to Blueball a fight TAPI could of won.... just wow

Did you miss the part where this was a cap roam meant for welping

Ugh, could only whore on a couple of those because ccp kept randomly offlining  my modules, and my drones just vanished.

????????????????????????????????????????????

Elo wasn't kidding when he said all you needed to get into origin these days was a pulse.

Trig leviathans run amok across New Eden rendering star systems useless in its wake. Once the new geography is established, brave capsuleer forces destroy the alien threat in a show of solidarity and ISK sinkage. Star buster blueprints fail to drop entirely. Insert hand wavy Lore reasons to fill any plot holes. Players now have to link star systems with player built gates and life continues in the wreckage left behind.

Hahahahaha test alliance is so scared of some chinese idiots that they'd rather kill themselves than fight back LOL !
---
The video just uses a lot of random clips from trailers and other eve videos while the voiceover happens, quite a few of them are taken from the This is Eve trailer but there is so significance to that
---
That's interesting. I have spare Power and CPU, but it hadn't occurred to me that I might have enough spare to fit a Medium Nos. I'll check once I'm back home.
---
A medium one might actually turn out to be useful, but I find it hard to justify using a small one when you compare it's 10 units per 2.5 sec cycle to the 40 points activation cost of a typical Hardener.
---
It'd have to be an absolute life-saver though to justify losing out on drone control at long distance.
---
If it fits I'll give it a spin for a site or two.
---
Zkill gives no fucks about your context.

AAR: About 4-5 various wormhole groups (Foxholers, it really is us, the grey eagles, chain smoking and a few randos) decided to try to evict the top tier LS PVP C2 wormhole that has been mothballed for some time with a low power Fortizar and Azbel. Each group safelogged in our hole with various fleets consisting of, Lokis, Sleipnir and Drakes.  of about 15-20 strong per group (total numbers from wormhole eviction voltron about 60-70). For some reason the eviction voltron did not have staging POS or citadel in the system.   
---
Hole Control had eyes on hole and offered to team up to even the odds for dank frags, they brought Muninns+Scimitars of about 30\~ total and V0lta brought a 40\~ man Loki fleet from Thera a little later. Since hostiles had no staging POS or citadel, Hole Control was able to camp their safe log position and keep voltron from logging in. Meanwhile Fortizar had repaired quite a lot, Hole Control decided to stop camping and shoot the fortizar to allow WH voltron to login and fight, meanwhile, Imperium came into the hole with Jackdaws and started pausing the Fortizar, Jackdaws fed hard to the Fort + HC Muninns, but during this distraction WH voltron logged in. HC took a few losses but killed many Drakes, following them to the Sun and finishing most of them. Sleipnirs+Lokis followed as V0lta came in and brawl ensured.

This was an already planned roam, it’s not a secret. There were gonna self destruct or get doomsday at the end of the roam.
---
How old is that?
---
Zkill doesn't try to weave a bs story either. More than can be said for the try hard oregon posters in here.
---
I mean, the battle report shows the last FAX dying at 20:48, and the main self destruct wave when FRT warped in was at 20:57. If you were having trouble breaking the remaining carriers, you all might be worse at pressing F1 properly than us.
---
Imagine outnumbering 2:1 and outshipping but still feeding 100b to people you believe `only have a pulse` LOL!
---
Damn even PIBC in Serenity never do this
---
You can also roll the mindflood  and clear the pod in a citadel if it's a bad roll before you enter a site.
---
well against normal neuters, so drones and drifters, I do not have to kite them as you can time the nos with the Hardener, Trig neuters are a bit trick due to the dmg AMP which cant be endured for ever. Neuting is the worst enemy even in a passive gila as the hardener is extremely important-
---
By break i meant finish them off, sorry. As in, we had no issues killing them other then them being huge damage sinks
---
Splitting hairs but whatever.
---
Dinobrain at peak performance
---
Also need more blues
---
Imagine being so dumb to believe that's what actually happened.
---
Spin harder, I'm almost there.
---
RA come back in PB,im bored
---
13 cap kills for just me. I can't speak for the others in my corp/alliance.  
---
"Only a few even got shot" is laughable. Spin harder kiddo.
---
Once I got used to the lower tier sites, I started carrying a deployable 'Packrat' Tractor. It's range can grab even the furthest cans, and it's extra 25% speed makes it easy to decide how many extra to snatch before bailing out. The only downside is that it also grabs empty ones, but if you clear a room quickly enough then all's well - and having the drone mod in the spare high means I can send them out to roughly 70k away to pop the nodes for me.
---
Sometimes of course, time is running tight and I know better than to bother.
---
Funny the recorded comms suggest differently. Nice spin.
---
isn't what any wormholer is suppose to do ?
---
What is an icavian?
---
yo even your boss agrees this is a shit post: 
---
https://imgur.com/a/jmxOyvv
---
also with nearly 100 caps 13 is laughable, and given most were killed by us it is even more laughable :)
---
idk it sure looks like you lost 100b of dreads without killing anything
---
you forgot to mention the part where you asked us to log in and help you with goons. also we didn't ref it ourselves. GE at least was there to third party nothing more.
---
You're totally right cause my spy doesn't have the logs or the comms recorded. Nice try.
---
TEST is blue to who ? Other member of Legacy hum, then bluetral to the Imperium hum, that leave us with more than half of the galaxy free to kill nah ?
---
FRT arnt even on most of the killmails how is this a feed?
---
See, it was a genius move from CCP to allow extended queue of skills. Now we can pay them subscription for not playing EVE for months. 
---
Guilty of this on multiple accounts.
---
Pls don't spin, they killed each other.
---
1. Your apparently don't know who is who in EvE if you thinks that's my boss.
---
2. Few: 3-5 not 13. Get your facts straight before you post kiddo.

Short AAR: Final Weekend Warrior Azbel timer. Triumvirate formed around 65 pilot Loki fleet, Pandemic Legion had a similar sized Eagle fleet with command destroyers to defend the structure. Snuffed Out formed a 55 pilot Nightmare fleet to contest it supported by 170 pilot The Initiative Stuka fleet.
---
Snuffed Out and The Initiative were first in the system, shooting the structure. Triumvirate bridged in on a structure on the grid and Pandemic Legion joined it. The Loki fleet then warped to the Nightmares and started fighting at close range, getting under the battleships' guns and breaking them. The Initiative came in with a bombing run to soften the strategic cruisers, allowing Snuffed Out to snag a few kills in return. Snuffed Out tried to light a cyno and bring in a Minokawa to help soak the Lokis' damage but the pilot disconnected and the beacon blapped. It took another nerve wrecking minute to get replacements, which allowed the Loki fleet to take down another battleship.
---
The Eagle fleet joined the fray, warping at long range of the fray and sniping at the battleships. The Initiative Stuka fleet decided to engage it, leaving Snuffed Out and Triumvirate to duke it out. What proceeded was a game of cat and mouse as the Eagle and Stuka fleets used command destroyers to teleport around the grid. The Stuka fleet lost a few command destroyers in the process but finally managed to catch Pandemic Legion's anchor. Without their anchor, the heavy assault cruisers slowed for a moment, allowing the Stuka fleet to gun down several mainline ships before the rest of the Eagle fleet warped off.
---
In the meantime, Snuffed Out was having issues hitting the Triumvirate strategic cruisers, though it stabilized a bit with the replacement Minokawa. However the fleet drifted out of optimal shield transfer range, losing another Nightmare. Triumvirate was starting to lose ground as well, the battleships taking down a few more strategic cruisers. Mounting losses and Pandemic Legion breaking led the Triumvirate fleet to cease fire, clear aggression and warp to a structure on the grid and dock up.
---
With Triumvirate and Pandemic Legion out of the picture, Snuffed Out and The Initiative blew the Azbel and went home.
---
I wonder if there are any new probing bonuses.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Ah so just sansha incursions with new textures
---
I think the t1 or t2 cruiser range was my goal for training.
---
We don't know who was part of the eviction attempt, the hole was fairly unoccupied with just a few scanning alts inside it. We logged in about 3 hours before the final timer and saw 4 different wormhole groups with shield doctrines all safe logging in system (2 of which at the same spot) so thought you were all together in the eviction attempt. We didn't have much intel about who was actually evicting us other than 60-70 dudes logged off in our wormhole.
---
and remember goon swarm doesn't want to ruin the game just your game!
---
A Triglavian keepstar would be neat haha, but wait are keepstars considered as a “station”?
---
Remember when goons laughed at horde for saying they were only "bluetral" to gotg
---
Yeah, I'm definitely new to T4's so I don't have a full grasp of how tough they'll end up being; so it could well happen.
---
I guess it's not fully passive, as the Hardeners are active, but it's definitely not a shield boosted build.
---
If I do lose it it'll be a kick in the gut, but a deserved kick in the gut; so that's fine by me. I just appreciate all the advice, as it helps me think through the options.
---
so its like a triglavian kundalini?
---
We need to go back

i had planned on shooting everything until i was approached by one of the groups planning on hitting the structure. i knew my comp was too light to take on the munnins so that is when we decided to work together. volta was completely unexpected.
---
Don't forget when the invasion goes live doesn't mean your overview will be set to show the things that are killing you.
---
And ? Thanks for proving my point, we are blue only for important ops otherwise it's free content for whoever want to roam and have content next door, ask to NCPL they are the one who invented this way of playing eve
---
It's almost like all major null alliances are dangerously lacking in brain cells.
---
What was all that about lol, what a waste of dreads... Btw, On my way! To salvage 👹😂🤣, inb4 “flair checks out”
---
If I remember correctly Mittani and his crew were mocking NCPL &amp; PH for always setup neutral alliance, saying all over the place "we are not blue" but then whenever The Imperium or Legacy show on their space they were all friendly together and working all together to shoot their enemy, what they were laughing at was not what they used to do, but they way they used to doing it, pretending they were only enemies. After a while The Imperium and Legacy start to call each other "bluetral" because they don't want to look dumb like their enemy used to do
---
Most of the people on that show are not goons though.
---
took frt 3 hours to form-&gt; bored to death
---
Why aren't we pushing CCP to do as much as possible to throw people together in the NPE to get them used to this being a PvP game even if you are PvEing?
---
We rolled into the hole earlier this morning , we had planned to just kill everything and leave. Killed some goons and had a gf with Hc and holesale. Was fun man
---
Still this might change in the future, we have plenty of examples of structures that look identical to ships in Eve like all the large collidable objects in pve sites. We could still get it as a ship in the future
---
C4s have trash rewards for how painfully long the sites take to finish. And with 3 characters, having 2 in one wh and the 3rd in another is just not efficient. That third alt could be helping with hole control, defense, scouting etc, but instead it's sitting somewhere being useless. If the problem is isk making, which is what op is complaining about in both the original and this post, then he could just consolidate all characters into one profitable system(read c5) and just deal with the minor inconvenience of taking a couple more jumps to find content. Instead he's whining on reddit about how his isk making isn't what he dreamed of.
---
kk thanks!
---
“Eviction attempt” you should really look at whoever hit the structures first. The groups in there found a structure timer fort and azbel with 6 hours to go and zero hole control. Eviction....no. Potential content.  Yes. Gg

So ok when we do it, not ok when others do it. Right.
---
grey eagles isn’t a wormhole corp tho
---
Works now...
---
The Imperium have their own squad who run incursion near or in delve, during good spawn, you can farm incursion with almost only supers/carriers which allow us to bring naked alpha pilot in T1 cruiser so they "whore" on dank tick and allow them to get rich pretty fast
---
Yo i swear i heard most of this before with drifters lmao

Are the triangle lads actually going to do something?

Now who wants fight a 50k ppl coalition please? Thanks Tapirium for doing worst

Kundalini is a rat that behaves like a rat and not a structure (i.e. can bump it pretty hilariously far).

No problem! And sorry I borked it... I'm more surprised that you were the first person to say something about it not working. Seriously. So, thank YOU for that :)
---
I see, is the isk actually that good? Approx how much is each incursion? I’ve never really looked into this part of the game as I mentioned, I haven’t seen that many people interested in incursions..
---
Heya, CEO of Foxholers here. This wasn't an eviction on our part and it was honestly completely unplanned. My fiancé found the Fort and Azbel in final timer so we came together like "waheyyy lets throw Drakes at this and see what happens".
---
Having so much show up on grid was totally unexpected. I must have spent 25 minutes on comms saying "right, how do we kill that entire fleet with Drakes and four Basis :D" gf Suitonia &lt;3
---
You aren’t supposed to shoot those rats.
---
Ah ok, we thought it was weird you guys didn't have a staging POS or anything. We just logged in 3 hours before the final timer, saw 60-70 dudes in our wormhole (Sleipnirs + Lokis + Drakes) and assumed you were all evicting us.
---
we live in a c2 with a c3 and hs static. we are very much a wh corp :)
---
All just good fun ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah, I'm not running a shield booster so I mostly get by on passive regen - and manual flying gets me out of most problem scenarios, but the Drifter battleship on the edge of the 'arena' can be a nightmare for me in T4s without that extra drone control.
---
So, having come really close to a time's-up loss because of that, and the two target range dampeners kiting me, I'm struggling to justify fitting a Nos.
---
Someone here suggested a Medium Nos would be worthwhile, so I'll give it a spin, but unless it really  impresses me I'll be going back to the drone mod.
---
As for boosters, I just started using a cheap 3% damage boost one (can't remember the name, as I'm not at home right now, but it's slot 11...). Not sure which others would be useful to a non-shield-boosted build.
---
The Isk isn't wildly crazy, but pretty cool if you weigh-up how many cans you can risk salvaging per room. In T3s I can grab them all, using a Packrat Tractor, but since moving into T4s I find myself taking 1 in the 1st, 2 in the 2nd, and all or 1 in the 3rd, depending on how hard the last fight was.
---
looks amazing
---
very thorough response. I appreciate it.
---
excellent, we need more structures and more timers to bash!
---
Good point there about overheating the AB. In PvP I wouldn't have thought twice, I'd be overheating everything - but for some reason in the frustration of the moment, it didn't even occur to me...! That's embarrassing. Ah well, lesson learned.
---

---
I'm not claiming EVE ever used to be flawless, I know it never was. It's gotten better in many ways, but god I miss the days when you actually saw people flying around. In 2012 we had twice the player count and nowhere near as many alts, nobody can dispute that. And CCP have completely changed their attitude over the years. Remember when we had an actual bloody economist working on the game? Remember when we weren't buying into CCP's bollocks and the Jita riots happened? Sure, I don't miss living out of a pos and buying skill books wherever I am is nice, but when the "mother of all balance patches" is 5 subcaps and some cap changes I can't help but feel that CCP are running the game on maintenance mode.
---
You can do things differently but the reality is most people have run the numbers already. Vni takes 5 ticks to break even and is 90% afk. Rattlesnake is better isk/hr as are carriers and supers but they take more attention action and are harder to replace.
---
You show up at the tail end of a thunderdome and then take credit for it? Jesus that's pathetic.

congratulations, you managed to post something totally irrelevant and missing the point of the discussion at hand

This, just this.  We complain sometimes about toxic behavior in this community but truth be told I love this game, and I love the people that play it, even that shitlord from ChODE. that ganked my JF.
---
Imagine being on the same killmail as Blades of Grass
---
It still has engines, and it's explicitly described as a vessel ingame and from the trig intercepts. 
---
The model is placed under "station", but that has no effect on its ingame implementation in the end.
---
The nos is what lets you run t4/5 in a passive gila with an empty pod. With a small nos you can keep either your 2 dead space invulns or your AB running under neuts, which is basically the only way to stay alive. Drone control range is nowhere near as important, ignore the people who say otherwise.
---
Some very generous alliance mate gave caps away for this welp fleet. We gated carriers to lowsec, with the hope of finding resistance, and at some point we went for a brawl with ourselves instead. We did not have a goal besides losing the ships in a fun way. We were surprised we actually got a few kills on the way there, actually.
---
Salt level 100%

We streamed it man.. there's no need for spin. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/420366051 You can watch from the very beginning.. us fighting CVA.. getting doomsday's on the keepstar. We thunderdome'd for 30 minutes before we even heard you guys were coming.

To add, this happens, in varying speeds, in all games.

In other multiplayer games, you quickly see metas emerge. This includes other MMOs, and includes both PvP and PvE.

You also it in singleplayer games, as seen in speedrunning.

Cheers o7

Hey man. I just wanted to say that this is the very first clip of mine that I've ever seen out in the wild. I'm new to streaming, so thanks for clipping this dude.
---
Funnily enough, this was the original intention back when citadels were still being planned. Then CCP got lazy and instead made tethering the way it is.
---
This exactly. It is a ship in setting but it's just going to jump in to wherever it ends up and jump out when it's leaving. It has engines, it is a ship. But it's not going to be flying around in space and you won't be able to bump it.
---
Hey dude. Looks like you're about to SP cap... Better upgrade your clone... You have a spare 300 million isk on hand in 2004 right?

What they really need to do is team up with eve uni and their newbie helper ISDs to make an NPE/tutorial that isn't afuckingtrocious rather than blindly slap shit together like they have been doing

ssssh! he can hear us!
---
Just think.. those are all replies to Black Legion freaking out about something they weren't involved in.
---
When I left on 2015, there wasn't much progress. Sure, Inner Harbor got cleaned up but the PD decided not to give a fuck anymore after the riots over Freddie Gray.
---
Honestly it´s the coolest looking ship to come out of eve i´ve seen so far and i´ve been fangirling over the Minokawa for years now.

What are you looking to do in EVE? That will influence what you train more then anything else. If you are looking for ways to keep track of what is going on while in-game while you aren't playing, then the [New Eden Report](https://newedenreport.com/) is a great source of in-game news. If you are looking for a way to get back into the game, then I'd highly recommend joining a newbro corp such as [EVE University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University). It is a great way to both re-learn the game and meet friends.
---
I don't know who you are ingame, but I clearly said in the shared convo that we will fuck on goons together, then we killed them without you guys and I clearly said we "reset".
---
I have been exploring for a long time and only just discovered that I can put normal scanner probes into the expanded launcher. Up until the discovery I had been swapping launchers for the different probes.
---
There is just so much to know/learn people sometimes miss stuff. You're not an idiot.
---
hey ron, i heard you streamed it live and was sponsored by a single dude to have fun. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/420366051

Only those who don't understand economics bitch about gentrification. Yeah, you may cry about the lack of investment in historically non-white neighborhoods, white flight from city centers and economic segregation. Gentrification is a straightforward reversal of those trends in spite of redlining, yet it gets bitched about.
---
I believe mining frigates weren’t a thing until 2013 or so.
---
We had already killed all the fax, and the majority of the subs.
---
I know you meant this ironically, but thank you. PS coolkay streamed it on youtube as well! https://youtu.be/XB89X58IMqA?t=1194
---
Yes they are.
---
Those invasions you listed are TEST making offensive plays while the rest of the universe sits on their asses. Complain all you want, my bitter friend.
---
Oh yeah. That takes me back years. I probably have one or two somewhere in storage too, but my beach chairs are blue and black.
---
yes
---
Did Test really Nip Fraternity?
---
Are you still needing help because i can help in game if need
---
Draw? that looks like it was outlined in pencil and then watercolor painted over.. and damn I'd love to have a print of it. Well done. o7
---
That's what I'm trying to get my head around. Up 'til now, drone control range has been overwhelmingly useful but now that I'm in T4s I need to assess whether that single mod is the crux to survival or not.
---
If 3 of 4 cruisers or battleships suddenly break out their neuts unsynchronised, I can't fathom that a single Small Nos will manage to pull off the (4?) uninterrupted cycles it needs in order to power even one Hardener... I could be completely wrong, but in T3 sites, without the Nos I just had to rely on the buffer and passive regen long enough to kill all the Neut ships, after which, it didn't really matter whether I had 2% cap or 20%...
---
Don't get me wrong, I'll probably keep it on there until I get more experience running T4s, but my brain's telling me it's benefit is all in my head.
---
This exactly. 2x faction sebos instead of the NSA means that you're always at jump cap. It is still possible to make 120m ticks like this. So the combination of ratting while aligned and being at jump cap 100% of the time means you're safer than even before the nerfs.
---
AAR please?
---
No they aren't.
---
Salty boi
---
or maybe it's the equivalent of the battle towers from sansha incursions?
---
227 v 121 :thonking:
---
Void Gleam Quake make the tower shake!
---
Yeah that was a fun fight in 9UY!
---
You might be the only person in this thread who is properly meming at TEST for this
---
That is somewhat true, although the lack of asset safety means an Upwell structure isn't the kind of instant upgrade over a large POS in J space that it is in K space.

About x47 fight, Imperium bring literally more titan than all the north and Imperium have won. GF.
---
But now the north lose his power: GOTG is on Imperium side, a lot of members &amp; corporations leaved NC and PL, CO2 + MOA + KOS are dead etc... 
---
Aaaaand Imperium and Legacy are blue together for fight Panfam...
---
Please check this [http://coalitionsin.space/](http://coalitionsin.space/)

Tapirium (with affiliates) = 55.56% of eve, so it doesn't exist bigger than Tapirium in Eve my dude. 
---
Good luck to find an opponent and have fun.
---
Haha fuck tapi what a bunch of nerds I bet they get pushed into lockers. They make  -A- look good.
---
Outgayed at your own game NC.
---
yea, I was wondering if ewar ships dedicated to break the spool up would be required.
---
Well I've definitely been capped-out a bucket-load of times, but killing all the Neuters while my buffer still held got me back on track every time. Now that I'm new to T4s, I'm back at square one experience-wise.
---
So far, 4 or 5 sites in, I've yet to encounter a large pack of Neuters, so I don't know if my old truths still stand. The most I've been capped-out by so far is two large Neuts and I got through that well enough without a Nos.
---
Once I've been ganged-up on, I'll be in a better position to judge it, but I came here for advice because up until now, my thoughts are pretty much the same as yours... Nos is meh. I'll be happy to be proven wrong, I'm just not convinced yet that I will be.
---
Not one picture of my old Minmatar face-crab :( I miss it. Can't believe they haven't made it as a cosmetic yet.
---
Hello "serious retard" (that's how your boss called you).
---
I'd like to inform you that Origin. is just a corp in Frat now so yeah, Noraus is your alliance leader aka your boss.
---
economy isant broken, its the pussy fcs that wont use the available resources for titan roams
---
Why set auto reload off? I would think you would want to reload asap
---
Because everyone who wears a jersey plays for the same team and/or attends the school right?  
---
The logic here is amazing.
---
If only the CVA keepstar had a reddit account, https://i.imgur.com/KnFxUns.png

Gf
---
Sansha mothership that spawns in incursions in low and null sec I believe
---
you have nip'd 'the rest of the universe' and bring goons to help you with all your 'offensive plays', which still fail. you're doing fuck-all and badly at that
---
Bruh come on you guys are literally a corp in fraternity
---
As a Canadian I felt inclined to purchase patriotic beach chairs that will never see a beach in their lifetime!
---
That’s exactly what null bears larping as Wormholers would say.
---
Exactly thank you.
---
Do you have to log in each day to build up the rewards?  Or will I get the rewards frn data 1-5 when I log in on Day 6?
---
Fun roam paid for by a single person. Caps were handed out to get blowed up. We went to provi, lost a few, had some good fights.. then we proceeded north. No one wanted to fight, so we thunderdome'd. 20 minutes into it after all the fax and subs were dead we hear FRT are coming for easy kills. We self destruct to avoid the freakout fest. Then "tapi_feeds_to_chinese_overloards" ..... just Black Legion things. CVA actually fought and did great.. and they don't post.
---
It was a combination of that caused by it being poorly designed.
---
I fly with them. My shits in their WH, they hold no null structures or Sov.
---
So what does that make us?
---
\^ This is your brain on bad posting... Not even once, kids.
---
Thanks a ton, comms were a blast!
---
Ahaha that's hot. That's hot
---
I see you prefer a universe where no one invades anyone where you're only allowed to batphone panfam.  
---
Don't blame TEST for not partaking in that shit.
---

this number is correct, otherwise Snuffed out wouldn't engage
