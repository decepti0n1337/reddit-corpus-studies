Less farming with more people being able to generate content from the farming can balance out

Ignore this one.  It was valid advice 10 years ago.  Learning skills don't exist any more.
---
Great work.
---
That looks like Eve North.
---
Do we know about the relationship between drifters and triglavians, if there is any ?
---
Ruh roh.
---
Oh, thanks.
---
It’s not solo if it’s going to light a cyno and call in a few black ops battleships.
---
Less a remake, more some completely new series by someone capable or dedicated enough to make something good.
---
&gt;Here at CCP we decided that truly citadel spam was a bad idea and, after asking literally noone, took appropriate actions.
---

---
Well, at leasts drifters undock.
---
&gt; We've got some great rental space opening up in Detorid.
---
[Our forces are already working on obtaining the region you call Detorid](https://zkillboard.com/system/30000492/) without your assistance.  
---
Perhaps *you* may be interested in 'renting' the area known as Esoteria?
---
that's right I forgot the narrative, you don't care that we burned 4+ trillion worth of infrastructure  because you didn't want it/ didn't need it/ weren't using it anyway.
---
Only if overlords still reveal cloakies.
---
yeah, an alliances line members take their queue from their leaders words and actions. Having someone in charge who isn't red killboard averse can only help them at this point.
---
That’s pretty nice. Did you make the blueprint for the model?
---
Vendetta online is alot like eve mixed with elite dangerous
---
Also, like eve but you can play both on your phone (easier with controller) or pc (easier with keyboard/mouse or throttle)
---
Its what im doing at the moment for my sandbox space sim while im working so much
---
You’re correct. This is why no one flies armor against muninns if they can help it. You get 2 cycles in before reps land as opposed to shield reps hitting instantly
---
Couldn't have happened to a nice guy. Lmao.
---
you can already buy SP with isk, just a roundabout method.  just eliminate the middle man - skill farmers.  it should still have the same diminishing returns as injectors - but also retaining a way (but expensive) for high sp players to get it (that would be priced so end cost and sp around 300k/injector)
---
Oh shit definitely miss typed that roflmao.
---
Could you just tractor away his cans for lulz?
---
This. I'd much rather people strike out on their own and fuck it up than become mindless drone #3644258 and suck down the null bloc kool-aid.
---
In a game where you can literally play anyways you want and you freely give that up to be led around by the nose.
---
Please no.  If anyone can fuck up more than D&amp;D it would be CCP.
---
How do bounties work?
---
I appreciate the roleplay.  However, you can drop it now.
---
600k? I think I got like 150k in 2006. You young whipper snapper.
---
This meets with our approval.
---
Fabulous Kapell
---
Yeah, I always thought it would be nice for the T2 ships to get their own models which are clearly *descended* from the T1 ships, but still unique instead of reskins with some minor alterations to the model.
---
And even though I want the Imicus to get a revamp, I have to admit that the current version has kinda grown on me. I guess it's an acquired taste?
---
Oh, sorry about that. I forgot to lower my discourse down to something more, shall we say, "discord tier." oof smh yikes
---
Yes!

Take this down.

You cannot share GM correspondence, or you will get banned.

Maybe someone controlling the keepstar attacked on the driffters.

I thought my D&amp;D group was full of people who were incredibly good at painting mini figs until I met some people who played 40k...

Bots vs bots.  Working as intended.

Memes aside, part of the benefit of switching to NS static holes is that ccp nerfed the hell out of the frequency and duration of the nullsec exits you'd find in a c5-c5 chain.  Way back when, you could scan out a chain from your c5 and have half a dozen good nullsec exists to choose from only a handfull of jumps down the chain.  Now, there are way way less of them, and the ones you find will be end-of-life way more often than before.
---
I'm happy obliviousowl got some more commissions, he was very patient and generous with his time. Also, great take on a classic genre. Reminds me of bomber girls.

Very well, have a great day sir
---
Not always test has a decent sized super fleet and out number frat but from all accounts frat are doing well defending from test
---
&gt;By selling SP directly for cash, instead of the plex&gt;isk&gt;skill injector, it could cause an ingame scarcity of plex, drastically increasing the isk cost to plex your account through ingame means, and possibly forcing players to pay the monthly subscription fee, or just stop playing all together.
---
I mean the isk cost to Plex your account has increased massively over the last couple of years. It's gone from under 1.5 bil to over 2bil, and is still slowly climbing.
---
Haha. They don't need skill points to see how engaging the game is. They need to play and feel the pride of earning and developing. I've played since week 1 and the HACs are my favorite class. What this game needs is a push toward sub-caps and small fleets. To be able to do that in null sec again would awaken this game.
---
Drifters
---
He won't give up his passphrase unfortunately.
---
None in Delve.. looks like the Drifters are attacking only intelligent life.
---
Did the polybolos BCS get a buff? It shows as 10/1/1 on everef, but 8/8/8 in game. Am I missing something?
---
TEST hasn't blued drifters on your map
---
Starter packs, SKIN sale, Extractor sale, PLEX sale,...
---
If only CCP were as passionate about fixing the game as they are about pushing those Q2 numbers...
---
My body is ready for the red donut
---
I, for one, welcome our new Drifter overlords.
---
why the hell is goonwaffe on there?
---
Deep Core Mining Inc. is recruiting
---
It was ready 2+ days in advance, too! Inside job.
---
Trigs basically starting kicking the Drifters ass.
---
Trigs really don't fucking like the Drifters.
---
Did we forget the fact capsules are used.. not pilots chairs in a bridge?
---
What about not sending all pilots to the same old null sec bloc corps? What about a bit of diversity? Thats what is needed to keep the universe alive and kicking.
---
Meh
---
don't talk non-sense! the imicus needs to be put out of it's misery one way or another.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And t2 ships being unique hulls has been a trend for each redesign CCP has made in the last 3 years, cormorant -&gt; jackdaw or rupture -&gt; broadsword for example.
---
It is nice to see they are visiting a couple of ships from the gallente lineup, however the thorax although "way-too-phalic" in shape it is such an iconic hull that it is quite difficult to come up with a more stylized design.
---
I started in 07. Pretty sure it was 600 by then anyway
---
No patience for a few weeks to train? Wtf are we dealing with? If that's the player we're trying to catch I don't want them to begin with! This game was founded on hard work of players and you're telling me a few weeks is a turn off? You are naive and then some. There's plenty to learn in the weeks of training before you get into your BC.y guess is you just want an alt able to do more right away because you have no patience. New players won't even know what BC can do of they don't earn it and learn to fly first. 
---
Sorry to say if you're the kind of person who plays this game now, no wonder it's so bad.
---
That made me sad to think about it
---
Just quit already
---
Dran is in their diplo office now - no one online yet.  Must be a late USTZ diplo team.  We’ll keep you posted.
---
I wish
---
Yeah some of were just discussing how interesting it would be if they keep track of structure timers and come back to attack the timer.
---
On the other hand, it is kind of shitty if it's 5 am in China and your alliance wakes up to their keepstar reinforced by literal bots. With no damage caps and no possibility for prior spy intel to prepare for an attack, Drifters suddenly hyperbashing shit outside your timezone leaves little counterplay.
---
No?  Frat keepstar they reffed then?  Not botters??
---
Well they hit the frat KS so...
---
You must be super fun at parties.
---
Agreed!
---
Nice
---
A common ship being thrown around is the Dominix. Ishtar if you can fly T2 cruisers.
---
Also mentioned that each of the alliance managers had their own passphrase but he wouldn't give me his.
---
This can't be real.
---
My thoughts exactly. I think CCP Ghost mentioned that player retention drops off a lot when a player joins a corp over 90 people.
---
Have trigs been in lowsec yet though
---
&gt;They need to remove any market skillpoint item period. Injectors were a horrible idea. Eve is about putting in the time and effort. Not about buying Plex and injecting years
---
I disagree. People go on and on about this game bleeding players. Face it, in this day and age, who is gonna start playing Eve in the hope that they can (in X years time) fly a really cool ship. Not too many people. Eve is what 16 years old? Few people are picking up the game now and looking forward to waiting half a decade before they fly a carrier perfectly, whilst paying for the privilege of that wait (in terms of a sub). The mechanics that worked a decade ago flat out won't work now. Subscription based games are already out of style.
---
Why would anyone play in the hope that one day they can be competitive with someone who started the game earlier, and thus has every advantage in terms of ships they can fly and modules they can use, in addition to the ISK gap. A gap between me and the guy who started playing 5 years before me that I cannot ever hope to close is a fairly ridiculous notion to most gamers. Sure he should have an advantage, but it should not be insurmountable. I should be able to grind and spend my hard earned ISK in an attempt to catch up, be it with injectors or accelerators. 
---
Finally, imagine I can fly Caldari battleships perfectly, and am a railgun ratting god. I then decide battleships aren't the way forward; and Rorqs are calling me, it'll take me what - almost as long as a new character to get there? And I'm unable to redistribute my useless sp now. That will cause people to leave due to boredom, or likely have alts for literally every activity, since it's too time consuming to have one main. You shouldn't need 583839 alts to be able to experience multiple aspects of the game. Extracting and injecting helps with that.
---
I'm sorry I had to.  I had this discussion the other day and was sad when I realized there was likely no bridge on any ship :(
---
Be sure to report back results plz.
---
Eh see how many other structures panfam looses to drifyers
---
 Good thing I already bought it then
---
there have been low sec systems being put under invasion, but it has not spawned in lowsec
---
Thanks for the info! I didn't think about mission blitzing. I might go out and check the forums as well.
---
Thats not a bad idea! Thank you.
---
It is my friend.
---
I must have missed it the last time I checked. Thanks!
---
It’s $40 worth of plex to transfer though
---
&gt;That’s just pay to win with extra steps. Now I’m a perfect links pilot, now I’m a perfect Loki pilot etc
---
I mean you can pay to be a perfect (insert any pilot here) with injectors anyway? 
---
I don't see how his suggestion is more pay to win?
---
And of course the big blocs think this is a "fuckup". Because any feature that doesn't make massive null blobbing and RMT rental empires more powerful clearly isn't intended, right guys? Bullshit blobbing is clearly optimal game design, eh?
---
100% real and hilarious
---
Git Gus third
---
Not nessisarily. They are undecided on rogue drones.
---
my raven was printed with the following...
---
Kept this out of the main post because it's my personal opinion: Everyone is under threat, not just Imperium. Calling it a "BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP" is just silly. New Eden doesn't pander to anyone and it's about time CCP started back on that trail again after failing to do so for years.
---
Also last I checked, anchoring a trajillion Keepstars was optional.
---
Thanks fam. Of all the corps I've created this one is still my favorite.
---
Drifters are the counter.
---
Noob here, what is going on? ELI5?
---
I mean, Drifters have started large-scale attacks in null so maybe CCP really does want to fix the game.
---
Burn everything?
---
It seems very easy to repel the drifters, at least the attacking party, just need a few supers.
---
This is honestly amazing. It's intentional and looks like they can actually do damage. I'd love to defend structures from the drifters
---
Real might get in the way...
---
Where was this?
---
Now even CCP uses Botting :/
---
150% this

Bad news for those 40 faction fortizars Sort gave you a few months ago, hey.

Everyone is under threat, not just Imperium. Calling it such a fuckup is just silly. New Eden doesn't pander to anyone and it's about time CCP started back on that trail again after failing to do so for years.

What exactly are you trying to argue here?

so npc's making it impossible to wage sov war is a good feature?

4th day as CSM and Eve nullsec is already more dangerous.
---
 #MakeEveDangerousAgain
---
this is amazing
---
Its only "impossible" because you guys have so much infrastructure you are overextended.
---
Only impossible by the definition of bloated megacoalitions that are nothing but harmful to the game's health.
---
I can't help but think this is going to be what happens. It would be a suitably EVE thing to have happen. Drifters forming for final timers forcing the large blocs to pick and choose what they can/should defend. Annoying though it may be to have a PVE entity touch everyone's carefully built sandcastles, it might be what nullsec needs. 
---
Inb4 the downvotes
---
What will NC do with all their free time while the rest of Eve defends their structures against the Drifters?
---
I'm laughing way too hard
---
Must... defend... Delve...
---
Bad news for those 40 faction fortizars that Sort bribed goons with last year.
---
Possibly because you need so many minifigs for Warhammer/40k that you get super good at painting.
---
Your right, they said they’ll have a chance to “conform”.
---
Since all high AI we’ve made so far has done whatever it needs to do to escape and go grow to the nightmarish infestation they are, I still expect to see some action from them in this situation as it unfolds.
---
We do not negotiate with terrorists.
---
I think they're posting the "Butcher's Bill" because NC has changed the owner of the structures to a holding alliance instead of themselves, there's no way to accurately get the total for structures killed otherwise.
---
lol. Imagine caring about structures. Victory has made you weak. Can't lose what you don't have.
---
How would one use heavy focused bombs and XL Cruise that only apply to supercapital hulls in a level 4 mission in highsec?
---
Please pay attention to what's being discussed, not your interpretation.
---
Elaborate NC plan. Now they are free from the burden of infrastructure while others are forced to defend theirs
---
Dreddit has SP requirements, so no good for day 1 newbros.
---
If they are coming directly into your home, yes, but finding a good NS often requires going a few jumps down the chain.
---
what about bosonic field generator?
---
starter sp in 08 was 50k this changed to 400k in Vanguard (fall 2015)
---
I'm quite independent and very much both not with Imperium and happy to see any megabloc get taken down pegs - both Imperium and Panfam more than deserve it.
---
Again, happy to hear valid suggestions. If you have any.
---
CCP could fix the sov/citadel system and give attacking players a chance but instead they chose to introduce Npc's to do it instead, how is this good design?
---
Did you perhaps mean corm/flycatcher?
---
I hate agreeing once with code more then I hate occasionally agreeing with PL or Goons.
---
fucking CCP
---
Confirmed. Was using a rattle in C3’s.
---
Unless you want to spend 40+ minutes scanning/rolling all the static’s in the hole you want to run in.. alts are a very welcomed trade off.
---
The idea was, they have very limited dmg v structures... why do people persist with nonsense such as this?
---
Its a good thing I bought Blood Bagel
---
honestly I hope this is their answer for timezone tanking. 
---
  
---
put your shit in a TZ you can't defend it? drifters will come any day, any time and fuck it up.
---
I agree and I'm for redistribution of skills but no one should be able to freely inject skills. A 5 year gap is not a 5 year gap if you take into account what each player wants to do. Some may want to fly tackle and never need to get into a battleship. Most new players can get a taste of the game and figure out what path they like. Maybe just start them all with 5 mil points to assign. I'd be okay with that. But skill injectors just puts a bad taste in this game.
---
The speed at which they can make progress against unoccupied territory means home defense will *always* be required so long as the drifters persist.
---
I'm frankly okay with that. In theory it keeps bloated empires honest and makes it much harder to overextend. I hope this intensifies.
---
Its real. NPCs fight harder than NCPL in yool 2019.
---
Almost time to go home anyway.  Wasn't much left to kill in that part of the universe.
---
It’d be funny if the drifters just started blobbing titan class ships. Time for a good old fashioned reset, Reaper style (ME).
---
But where is the advice?
---
why tf was this removed
---
I've missed Rote Girl!
---
You're indicating viewers in this sub can nuance supercapital proliferation should have a different counter than "bring more titans or twice the number of dreads lolomfg."
---
CCP definitely intended things like station NPCs to be stuck in deployable bubbles and utilized to deny hostiles' undocking from stations.
---
So CCPlease why are you messing with the sandbox with NPCs doing things!!21
---
NPCs are going around and reinforcing citadels all around the galaxy
---
So I came out of my office earlier to hear some coworkers talking about eve. I've never been very active in the game.
---
One of them was the op. He asked if I played, so I said sometimes.
---
They proceeded to tell me about this reddit post.
---
Karttoon told me the story a long time ago when I didn't really care too much about eve. 
---
I still am not a hardcore player, but I used a throw away because he immediately got threatened with a ban.
---
Hey man! Me and my good friend just started a Corp so we could live in a c3 with a lowsec static. So far, it's just us, but we'd love if you wanted to join us as I think we have similar interests. We have a raitaru anchored currently and are planning on anchoring an astrahaus! 
---
If you wanna pop into our pub channel it is 71st pub, my buddy may be on. Otherwise I'll be off work in about 2 hours and we can chat then if you're interested!
---
I never said it was good design, I was just pointing out that the only reason this is difficult to defend against is because you are spread out over half the universe.
---
I hope CCP sticks to their guns with this and actually lets it keep happening instead of letting the GSM tell them to not do it.
---

Neat to see them extending the AI to do more player-like scenarios. That warp out and warp in sounds fun and terrifying. Hope we eventually see the usual rats using AI more like this, would make that whole system alot more interesting.

"Suddenly"? Those have been active for years. The fish and the little dipper have pretty much always been there.
---
thats a good point, hadnt thought of that. Would defs make it harder to put structures out of your tz
---
So you are saying you don't want powers to ever bother attacking each other because of distance?
---
Compressed ore prices are going up because supply has gone down (goons are not exporting shitloads). The reason is simple; capital ship production requires it, and for that mineral price in jita is kinda irrelevant (you cant really move minerals).

Your points stand on the foothold of the game being a f2p game. With that not being the case they're basically mood.  
---
Also nice Edit, but if you would have looked at the wording they quoted an outside source, as it refers to them in the third person plural.
---
Out of interest, what small entities have said they're getting fucked by this?
---
No you charge more then I charge more xD

Or do you downship into a bomber doctrine and strike from the shadows?

---
Can't wait for Legacy, GOTG, Panfam to all openly disagree with Imperium. Panfam might just out of spite, I guess.

Why?

Mageblocks have few dozen times more structures and thus the chane to get *their* shit hit is much higher.

Bad look man.  Take it down

You sure sound like I shat down your throat this morning
---
CCP, in their infinite wisdom, have decided to interfere in a PVP sandbox by having armies of NPCs fly around bashing our structures.
---
Maybe this feature should have been announced *before* it went into effect?
---
I haven't seen anyone complain. It's a pretty cool event, but if you're going to try and spin this as goons being salty or something, that wouldn't surprise me at all.
---
Drifters aren't exactly risking anything, maybe the fact that they're a npc has something to do with it.
---
Slightly harder to watch out for ganks if you run 2 instances of Eve on a single window? That's about it really. I'm assuming that your main character is also a miner?
---
Hey, I'm just trying to make sure everyone's held to a consistent standard. I don't want any "burn everyone else but leave my krabbing ass alone". Do it, do it right, and do it all.
---
Just sayin' =)
---
There are a lot of people upset about this new development. Mostly the ones whose Null sec castles are getting shot at, b/c they liked being able to play King of the Mountain and ruin the game for everyone else. Lol
---
Better yet a shitty video with blaring background music drowning out any of the cringe narrative being spewn.
---
No ones complaining.   Got it wrong again.
---
Aww I got excited there for a minute. Hopefully some fun stuff to shoot soon!
---
Those have always been like that.
---
Hell yes it's worth a try. It's a free start. What have you got to lose?
---
Like the best thing to do is find a Corp to fly with and find something you enjoy doing. I wouldn't say go straight into mining as that can get boring very quickly. But find something. Anything. But find some people in game and chat and pay and just enjoy it. Don't take it to seriously. This game is only as difficult and as challenging as you want.
---
Just because it's a sandbox doesn't mean it's empty. There's other stuff happening in it, despite your attempts to ensure otherwise.
---
And no, this feature should not have been announced beforehand. Adapt or die. Shit happens, and the strong adapt and survive while the weak are culled.
---
As a small group, can confirm this statement is false.
---
Someone check SV5-8N!

I like this weird narrative you people are trying to push that goons hate this or something. I haven't seen any goon complaining; most people think it's pretty cool. In fact, large alliances are going to be the absolutely least affected by this.

Question, and forgive, the only things I’ve built so far are my Asteros and Ventures so I didn’t have to fly them into jspace.
---
Why would compressed ore ever be bought or sold? My understanding was ore gets reprocessed as close to where it was mined as possible, and the much more valuable, compact minerals can be brought to trade or where they will be used.
---
Play wow classic?
---
It's the most important job on the field and it's my calling too.  My favorite is tackling kiters.
---
Your alliance literally called it, **and I quote**, "A BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP", in an official ping.
---
It's all fun and games until the drifters head into high sec afterwards and start killing concord
---
Wingspan blaps shit because its fun for them though, Thats a pretty logical reason i think.
---
also fuck you guys, i remember the killmails.
---
If I could throw gas on that fire I would.
---
Then there will be something like GoonSwarm Federation, GoonsWarm Federation, Goonswarm Confederation, GoonsWarrrgh Federation, etc popping up 
---
(Goonswarm is closed though

Hell yes! CCP just demonstrated their willingness to completely upend the sandbox and shake things up, so I'd say now is the perfect time to start!
---
Just don't get sucked into one of the big blocs.
---
lol
---
This would be an amazing change in eve if the AI actually was a threat. Please don't change this u/CCP_Falcon
---
RnR nestors. done..
---
You don't get it do you?  The Imperium's strength is in organization and providing safe space for our members to generate wealth.  We are more prepared for this sort of thing than any other nullsec entity.  If this is not some glitch or temporary event CCP just handed goons a blue doughnut on a silver platter.
---
My answer is yes, and here is something I wrote so someon asking for starting help.
---
You will loose ships and get podded, accept it, you are not safe anywhere, anytime, people will go out of their way to punish you for being lazy.
---
Lookup magic 14 skill set to guide you through setting your self up.
---
I recommend following the new player experience and doing the first epic ark available to you regardless of what you think you want to do. As soon as you’ve managed to get through that, JOIN A NEWBRO FRIENDLY CORP, even if you want to be solo most the time, hisec, lowsec, null, or wormhole space you will have a base of operations and a lot more exposure to everything that is Eve.
---
Don’t get stuck doing anything you don’t want to do with people you don’t want to do it with. You really will have to figure out what you want to do, [check this out](http://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg) for an idea of the things you can get into.
---
That would be amazing if they disabled CONCORD in a system, I would 100% go there and whelp a few fleets.
---
Well, yes and no. In terms of raw work to do, we're going to be the most affected by this. We've got orders of magnitudes more structures than anyone else. Assuming that the drifters choose a target entirely at random, any given Nth sided die that rolls is going to, more often than not, land on an Imperium structure. It's just the raw math of it, nothing more. We could reduce our risk envelope by having fewer structures.
---
That being said, we probably won't lose anything to it, unless it's, like, a staging structure way the fuck out of our super umbrella or some shit.
---
CCP and Netflix could do some interesting stuff, but CCP is just sitting over there doing nothing.
---
Did you just say "compact minerals"? Minerals are not compact; they're many orders of magnitude larger than compressed ore. You do not move minerals.
---
New meta. Spam your enemies space with structures and let the drifters burn them down... CCP  gets banned for botting
---
Got it from thingiverse
---
&gt; Dear CCP, I admire your balls, please don't lose them.
---
They even had the balls to sell SP directly. Man, they are on a run, indeed!
---
We do not yet know if this was fully ai. Each of the fleets were anchoring on one specific bs, which could have been human piloted.
---
Will you save me from code?   Those fucks are more concerning than drifters.
---
He's not wrong tho. If it is a bug it's a massive fuckup
---
&gt; compact minerals can be brought to trade or where they will be used  
---
It's ok if you build small stuff.  
---
To build caps/supercaps the only option is compressed ore.  
---
Sotiyos usually have reprocessing service in them for this very reason.
---
Nope. The KS was unmanned the entire time.
---
Just make the drifters scale with the number of ships on grid small groups will be fine.
---
A lot of enthusiasm in the first reddit thread. It's... Refreshing. All future bittervets.
---
Neither does snuff, didn't stop Test tho
---
So did the event though?
---
I call dibs on Goonswarm 2 CCP boogaloo.
---
Sorry, but my ten year gooniversary was last week and I could do another ten at this rate. At least I've got STIM in my corp history. Nobody can take that away from me.
---
Still sounds like fun tbh

Atm I think the players are the least of your concerns
---
This message brought to you by the memorial funds for Tribute, Venal, Malpais and Tenal. RIP 4+ Trillion

---
Dead Co space is about to become a bot v NPC warzone. It is time for the war of the AI.
---
Short Answer:  Yes
---
Long Answer: I’m too lazy to type a whole lot, so if it helps: I quit WoW for this in 2015 cold turkey. Still playing.   So.... yes. It’s complex, it’s hard, it’s unforgiving, but it’s the most rewarding MMO I’ve ever played.
---
Find a group, ask questions, and WHEN IN DOUBT, RIGHT CLICK THINGS.  It might seem odd, but trust me.
---
It’s kinda like a choose your own adventure book, not a normal linear storyline kind of game; you gotta go out and make your own story.
---
Do they have many left?
---
It wasn't for me. I tried. Once I realized the lengths that some go to play this game and be successful it seemed a bit much. 
---
I don't actually want to work in the fucking game but a times it can seem like you need to. Or swipe your card to the tune of hundreds maybe even thousands to get caught up.
---
If they reboot this shit I'd be right back but I understand why they can't.
---
If they burn it all down they might lose their entire base and I get it.
---
So CCP find themselves in a weird spot where they are trying to get new players without losing it's hardcore dedicated base.
---
Part of the game are just kinda weird too......people with alts in Horde and Goons.
---
The constant feeling of distrust. Of being led into a trap. Meh.
---
Lol nah bud. Let it all burn
---
Fuck it, they have done worst, I'm ok with they setting Drifters to a rampage, throw Triglavians into the mix and scorch the galaxy... and then put a limit to structures you can place in a system.
---
Shit, now I hope that happens.
---
Oh it would be I'd be low-key down
---
Say the same thing to yourself before you click that save button
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
paging u/falcon wtf?
---
a quality shitpost, from olmeca, what year is it?
---
I think this occasion is fine since fucking everyone was asking the gms.
---
No I do not, I am basing this off the one time I delt with ore mining 10 years ago, that’s what my corp did, refined at a pos, and exported via freighter to HS.
---
Lots has changed, I have been focusing on PI, gas huffing, and WH pve/pvp fleets.
---
The most complex thing I’ve built is a 3-run faction battery BPC I got at a sleeper catch, had to train a skill for half a day and get some stuff from HS, but it was like 550-600m profit.
---
This shit is getting better by the minute.

You have a herd-_-

Perfect!

&gt; completely ignoring specific parts of the game in favour of others

&gt; taking the current corporation finder and replacing it with a more useless version of the same thing.

Jesus christ this is shit. When do you start working at CCP?
---
So, honest question for CCP, does exploiting a likely bot in this way for your own gain make you complicit in the botting?
---
Triglavians in HS, Drifters in NS... did CCP forgot about LS again or shit is about to hit the fan?
---
Hey I like exciting news
---
gold fucking gold
---
Thank you.
---
I have several monitors.

Still tossing up between mining and salvage.

If it's a bug, it's not a bug anymore, it's a feature.

Literally no one is bitching.   Bring it on!

---
I already regretted voting for you though
---
Why would we spread out? Wouldn't we just continue keeping our members consolidated in a single region still?
---
yes
---
Why not
---
The Trig are trying to work with them. And that rogue drone took the head of the Pharos of Thera.

Do you think the big blocks will rebuild if it gets burnt down? Or will smaller groups rise up?

Thanks for the advice I’m just in game having a little look around now and doing some tutorial type stuff. I didn’t even realise it was my cake day thanks for pointing that out!

Oh fuck well I feel better now
---
The only thing better would be a Goons Move Op getting ganked by the Drifters 
---
Don't cave to the pressure u/CCP_falcon  Keep this mechanic a secret. Don't tell anyone anything about it
---
Nice try Mr Tyrannos
---
Try different stuff.
---
The Agency can point you in the right direction
---
Wut
---
Just warning them, not reprimanding or anything.
---
What's this 'we' shit?
---
So compressed ore is more compact than the refined minerals, k, I wouldn’t have thought that was the case.
---
I have only mined enough to build my Asteros and Ventures, I feel trapped and slow in barges, so I only fly them on big mining ops where we have escort, Orca/Porpoise boosts and all that.
---
As a new player, do you think training is a burden? Do you think the gap between you and vets is too much to overcome?
---
Rare that i agree with a goon but
---
Can we have this?
---
Id start a bridging service for spectators....
---
CCP has confirmed it's not a bug. And I'm decently certain Goons knew it wasn't a bug when they posted that.
---
You are correct will edit
---
And a damn good one at that.
---
Olmeca is shitposting, CCP seems to be doing something without telling the players and at first sight doesn't feel like completely retarded, the AI is apparently working as intended... what the fuck is going on? Someone hugh me, I'm afraid.
---
that /s whooshed over your head and into a different fucking system my dood.
---
They've had 16 years of that and look where it's got the game. MASSIVE and wealthy alliances to afraid to undock because they might lose or be seen to lose, vast tracts of space with nothing going on and unable to be colonized by smaller groups because of larger bloc interests. 
---
If the Drifters AI is able to curtail that a little and shake things up, then why not?
---
Meh, some Goons are bitching, but that's mostly just background noise.
---
Don’t get rid of the thorax classic design ide be so sad to see the only actually penis shaped ship in the game to leave
---
Just making sure they're consistent and it's not "one rule for thee, another for me".
---
Oh man, that would be awesome!
---
I'm weirdly excited about it too
---
Lets hope there is an actual plan here, and this isn't just a "we'll spawn drifters that will start shooting structures for shits and giggles".
---
There needs to be a follow up to this, in order to be meaningful, otherwise its just a unnecessary hassle for big blocs that won't impact them in any way whatsoever.
---
K
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
You don't know what hell they're put through while waiting for respawn!
---
Honestly there is nothing wrong with being an F1 monkey  
---
as long as you don't keep to it your whole time in the game
---
its good to learn fleet mechanics and regular strategies  
---
Just look at eventually trying out different sections, maybe try being a prober, a blops hunter, an FC, or logistic work  
---
there is niches to all, and I cannot recommend enough to try and do roles outside of F1 if you have the time to play the game.  
---
Most of us learnt from being an F1 monkey at the start, just don't become the F1 monkey that stays in one group and only believes what their corp/alliance/coallion/megacoallion says, no matter what side.
---
Haven’t seen it here.
---
Who cares lighten up man
---
CCP coming in with the real metagame here.
---
If they see everybody hates it, it's a bug. If everybody loves it, it's a feature.
---
This is the correct eve mentality.
---
Except INIT. hasn't really been spending time in Querious. That puts a whole in your theory. And several smaller alliances have been hit as well in low pop regions.
---
Whoops sorry I wasn't supposed to.
---
Ftfy **EvP**
---
Will be interesting to see what those Drifter Doomsdays will frag.
---
Got titans in build I’m sure
---
rip Goomwaffe, taken too early from us
---
Wait, you actually made CSM ?
---
Had me going there, hate to admit it.
---
thx
---
Make eve a real sandbox. No gates, no stations, everyone just spawns in a corvette and drifts aimlessly through the starter system forever.
---
but the stuff inside the keepstar will get asset safety though...
---
If you think about it, since they are hitting random citadels, the chances of them hitting something important extremely low considering there's a shit ton of structures in Delve.
---
This
---
It's unfortunate you're actually a thing.

---
SANSHA KUVEKAI'S BODY WAS NEVER FOUND
---
Thing is from whats been seen theres no damage cap on drifters
---
Is it possible to do "top tier" stuff in Eve without having several specialised alts? I always found that part of meta to be immersion breaking, since Eve isn't just a "Screw other people by being better at spreadsheets" for me but a galaxy to immerse in.
---
I.e. i heard you need a lot of alts to get in any decent wh corp.
---
Or is it just that it's cheaper and faster to have several specialised alts opposed to one handyman char?
---
Did we just become best friends
---
i was so happy until i got to the end :(
---
&gt;THIS IS A BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP AND WE MUST SECURE OUR LINE'S ASSETS IN DELVE AND WAIT OUT THE STORM
---
Is it as bad as a CCP artist making a character portrait background without consulting mittens though?
---
It wont hurt us that much it will hit smaller groups a lot harder especially if they reform for armour timers
---
just clicking through these threads there are a lot of goons calling this an outragious amount of BS cuz it was unannounced, so yes, goons are in fact very salty atm.
---
The eve university wiki is a great resource for stuff like this. [Their page on tackling](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tackling)

CCP has given Rooks and Kings control over the drifter fleet, they start pipe bombing Goon freight trains. god i would give them so much money

In fairness... the universe *was* forged by players... but it can be disassembled by Drifters.

Do you take frozen corpses as payment?
---
you, you're a lore buff.

where do the sansha fit in to this? wasn't there some nonsense between drifters and the sansha around the time of caroline's star?

&gt;I haven't seen anyone complain

Did you not read the op? 
---
&gt; THIS IS A BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP
---
But we don't, we own 4 regions
---
Here i'll give you mine for free: fit lots of haw titans for max dps and warp them in at zero on the driver fleets its the best thing to do about it.
---
Word on the street is they ignore damage caps.
---
The Drake Navy is criminally underrated. Glad it's getting some love.
---
All this does is "punish" you for having lots of structures. "Punish" is kind of a poor way to word it, but I can't think of anything else off hand. If anything, this encourages more concentration; much easier to defend structures from NPCs when they're tightly packed.
---
You gonna die
---
being able to trigger this many brainlets with a joke; g*d bless
---
#***SHH***#
---
You personally no idea but its been a trope of PL for years
---
I think the triglavians hate the Sansha, so maybe they'll help out the drifters? Or do both factions hate the Sansha?
---
New Eden
---
I'll resub to help the Drifters burn Delve
---
I can tell you exactly what will happen and how it will happen without any risk of The Plan~ being jeopardized. Reddit has unwittingly flexed it's voting potential to put Olmeca Gold onto the CSM. There is a reason Olmeca Gold didn't appear on any Imperium ballots. We couldn't allow for any indication that we actually wanted him on the CSM. Not even to our line members, it had to be you; reddit that put him there...
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the [/r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve) crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
All of this will happen and there isn't a damn thing any of you can do about it. Even if a small percentage of you are self aware enough to accept what is happening, it's already too late. The election is over and no amount of information control will halt the downfall of reddit voter turnout.
---
The past 3 years I have canvased here knowing full well that you would never willingly accept The Key~ to your shackles even if presented to you. The ultimate argument inoculation, the ultimate dead agenting of an enemy group. It's too late, there is nothing you can do. I have already won.
---
You are goddam RIGHT!
---
How ironic chinese keepstar reinforced by bots...
---
You HONESTLY had me excited for a minute.
---
Most goons struggle with "align to," no surprise they can't cope with something complicated like an actual moveop.
---
Gonna be a long year isn’t it
---
Drifters, achieving more in 8 hours than NC. did in a month.
---
This is more like how pve should be.
---
Not proud to admit how much I laughed at this...
---
I kind of like the idea that it was a surprise
---
I for one wish this was real
---
More prepared than NCDOCK who have no structures? 1 step ahead.
---
corrupted azdaja, i.e corrupted people. Don't like them either, KOS.
---
&gt;Before some Goons unironically report me for an NDA breach I should add that this post is fictional.
---
that was evident from
---
&gt;I just received the clearance from CCP to reveal the masterplan on which we have been working behind closed doors.
---
Even ccp aren't stupid enough to do that.
---
All these silly solutions on r/Eve with resets, new systems and stuff,  I hope what’s coming is going to give the null blocks something to stress test their super-capital infrastructure.
---
And if that happens, and null structures start getting got, I’m sure other pilot groups will swoop in to take advantage of the situation.
---
Two months, tops.
---
The Monocle wasn't a bug
---
Wouldn't it work better for the drifters to force alliances to concentrate, which would leave a lot of unclaimed space for smaller groups to take?
---
You just blue them
---
CCPL strikes again.
---
Let’s not assume ok
---
As much I don't like to say that, Delve, with umbrella fleet up would be still much safer to krab in than 90% of of other regions. 
---
And people aren't just going to stop krabing just because few rorq died. Besides that, only people who die under umbrella are people who either made one mistake to much, people who got disconnected, or people who had been sacrificed, for one goal or another, and theses are often SRP'd.
---
What could make goons weaker would be their oponents getting better. But I wouldn't count on that. It might be simply to late for that to even matter now.
---
So, all the crying yo CCP asking for this has made that CCP take part in the game politics?
---
Joly baby Yezuz
---
7D chess right there
---
... for every city they burn, we're going to build one higher?
---
Trigs hate sanshas for the same reason they hate drifters: Sanshas and Drifters take the mind part a bit too seriously and effectively "corrupt" whatever the hell they get their hands on.
---
Apollo Tyrannos defeated by feroxes lol
---
I mean, most of the modern world was forged by humans. But humans were fighting tooth and nail against nature to survive and tame it. 
---
Wildlife, diseases, natural cataclysms probably have taken much more lifes than wars. 
---
If nullsec is controlled by drifters, and then players get their shit together and take it back then they are forging the galaxy. 
---
If “universe is forged by the players” vibe is going to change, it will be because players just sit shaking, waiting for storm to pass instead of undocking and fighting.
---
Can’t maintain coherent thoughts in literally anything
---
I applaud this. If I'm drifting around space and notice these null bears mining carefree in their money pits I'd for sure bring the hammer down on them. These alliances are too pitiful and nervous to attacked each other, CCP is doing it.
---
Because nothing says "refreshing" like PVE content.
---
Hi man! 
---
From noob to noob, I have 2 "advice". First, choose how much time and ressources you want to deidicate to Eve. There is content for light casual and hardcore players (and everyone between), and you can go from one to the other, but this game can be really deep once you start to dive in, so it's up to you to put your own limit.
---
Second tip: be curious, ask shit (damn this community is really willingly to help newbros) and google stuff, there are a lot of sites and videos to learn and understand every aspects of Eve.
---
Not enough tinfoil.  Try this:
---
CCP / CSM 13 leaked to NCPL, who knew the Drifters would kill all their structures so they just let Imperium burn out on them.  Now they're fresh and allied with Drifters against weary Imperium.
---
4d chess.
---
&gt; BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP
---
I hope the author of this was half joking.
---
&gt;Drifters showing up and reinforcing Citadels is the most interesting thing to happen in Nullsec in the past 2 years.
---
What? 2 years? last year had the biggest war Nullsec had seen since the halloween war resulting in 3 major titan engagements all of which dwarfed B-R in terms of assets committed to the engagement (when you combine NC. and Imperium Titan Fleets that were moving into UALX). 
---
I mean, your opinion is subjective of course, but i do find it hard to see how NPCs just reinforcing a bunch of structures to be more interesting than that.
---
Don't get me wrong, this is cool as hell, and i hope CCP has an actual plan for this, and its not just a "we'll spawn some random drifter fleets in random system to reinforce stuff" and no follow up after that. 
---
This is definitely the more interesting thing to happen in eve in the past .. idk 10 months i guess, but 2 years? nah...
---
I don’t get the “had me for the first half” thing people have going on, where does the first half end, and why is it a joke, this all sound great to me minus the rewards for last structure standing.
---
If it’s over a month that will give most the time to pack up and evac, I want to watch the cataclysm.
---
ironically after refusing to defend anything they own NC/PL is now in the position to take advantage of the drifter invasion afer allowing 4+ trillion worth of structures and iHubs to be burned to the ground.
---
I love the two random Goon wrecks amid all the other carnage.
---
" Alliances that only care about the MER and Rorqual numbers are going to whine about it constantly " Why would we? We have more ability to fight back and defend against this invasion than anyone else...
---
they already came out and said that this is working as intended.
---
Day 1, 90+ goon structures were reinforced. Clearly you're Oh so well prepared for this.
---
First public act as a CSM winner is to lie to his constituency. Nice.
---
neat :o Wonde what the big picture is
---
Ill laugh if drifters decloak all his alts and blap them.
---
Exactly, they have no structures, so no reason for the drifter fleets to roam their space.
---
The game is different than rl lol
---
Yeah idk why people are freaking out when massive aoe dds exist 
---
Drifters are scary when hull size is limited
---
literally read op
---
I wouldn't hold my breath expecting something well thought out tbh.
---
I think this is just ccp throwing shit at the wall hoping it will stick.
---
Drifters shove Sansha out of the south, Sansha invades lowsec :thinking:
---
So far, these drifters move in fleets of 10-20. Volley Battleships off the field with 170km scrams, and in several cases have prevented and ignored tethering from ships both docking and undocking. While I agree we should have a dangerous game, I don't agree that titans should be the only way to fight back.
---
When will the Drifters start hitting IHUB's &amp; TCU's? That's when it gets real.
---
Possibly. Shame they can't make defending against them profitable as they'll be mostly flying into bosons
---
could not agree with this more
---
If these guy will just put structures into shield, then honestly it will probably not amount to much.  Who really gives a crap about a shield timer no one will ever follow up on.  
---
If, on the other hand, these guys will come back and actually take a structure to armor or final timer, then we have something pretty interesting.    
---
Delve is set up to deal with defense.  It will be fully staffed in a few days and I expect that once we sort out the mechanics of the fleets we will be around to deal with the bad guys without much trouble.  
---
What will be hard though are the smaller corps, rental empires spread out, or just random BOTs ratters.    
---
One more mechanic that will encourage groups to band together in a single region to defend their stuff.
---
Can you point to a part of the EULA that specifies this? Or maybe a dev response? People have been using the recruit a friend link to create alts since it's inception.
---
What does this capsuleer want, brother?
---
A Keepstar is a botter? I thought they tended to be hyperspatial hels, etc.
---
It'll get real when Drifters start hitting IHUB's &amp; TCU's.
---
Um, B-R had more $$$$ on the field and dying than all three of those fights put together? You either have no idea how inflation works or youre trying to spin it to make it look like interesting things are still happening in null.
---
&gt;Freed from the shackles of sov
---
Yeah, WH drifters escalate when you bring capitals. Warp a titan to a 50 man drifter gang boyo, I want to see what happens.
---
I guess Sort would replace any that get damaged anyway.
---
Burn everything.
---
Sacrifice me!
---
Most people arent going to roll their caps in to an unscanned chain from NS. It could take months to get them back if they collapse the hole behind them.
---
We'll see. There's some interesting ideas I have about when these Drifter fleets come in to contact with with a gang of Titans
---
Just about anyone who's in a position to really take advantage of this (beyond gloating and cursing all things nullsec) is going to be impacted along with the Goons.
---
You are right, but i'm pretty sure the whole vision the devs are pursuing is "it is like real life with real people, and their ambitions, and obstacles standing in their way".
---
And while this game, just as you said, is different from rl (i don't remember last time i've seen immortals coming back to life after death), i find devs trying to bring it closer and closer to it a very plausible prospect, a constant "enviromental" third party threat in null might be their first step towards it.
---
I SEE WALLY POST THAT ISN'T CRINGE, I UPVOTE
---
Would be very nice if some form of this is true. More power to the little guy!
---
When Drifters begin to hit IHUB's &amp; TCU's you know it's a real Invasion.
---
Jove will invade lowsec
---
It might cause issues for people like simple farmers though depending on implementation. If it attacks all 300 raitarus a bunch will probably die and they can't really commit the heavy assets to defend against the fleets the drifters seem to have for fear of getting stepped on by brave.
---
Oh shit thought this was matterall
---
You have the best clips. Makes me laugh every time.
---
CCP's idea of a reset
---
More like "if", not " when" statement. But you are right, we will see how far CCP will go. But once again, biggest entities are the ones that are best prepared for things like that.
---
From the looks of it, only large structures and transit networks/jammers are being attacked. Small groups generally don't have anything larger than perhaps their one fort (which may be a target) but usually don't have things like jump bridges. This is actually a very sizeable buff to groups living out of Astrahuses trying to break into sov, provided attacks continue and reforms are made.
---
In b4 the alliance that wins the MER can defend its space.
---
Too soon

Ever played an MMO and you were that guy that pulled a gang of MOBs over to the person that was being a dick about farming MOBs or resource? That used to always be funny
---
What do you have to offer us, capsuleer?
---
olmeca shitposting is unironically something i can get behind
---
why wait for someone to lead you, resub and start burning it yourself.
---
I guess everyone needs someone to look down on, in Eve...
---
I for one would love to see the large blocs threatened by Drifters and what not, and maybe even other NPC factions. Help carve up all that unused space.
---
Nobody ever sperged about PvP losses. Go steal from MCAVs corp hangars or something
---
Hundreds or thousands, lol, I just came back last year from 10 years ago, I’m a bit jelly about what new pilots start out with, I understand why it’s necessary though.
---
Doing the right stuff plus the cost of a sub and a Star Pack you can be making enough to get into whatever you want and using injectors monthly like a junky.
---
Even a reboot will not fix things the way you want,  because even in a total world reset, with every toon back to start, and everyone undocking in a corvette in the starter systems, the leaders will still form groups to lead, people will know what to do, and the smart and the dedicated will still shoot far ahead of the rest.
---
And in a month people like you will be in the same place, and complaining about it on r/Eve.
---
Hes learning to spin!
---
The next step is to apply to Karmafleet!
---
No i wasn't taking inflation into consideration, and don't see how that is relevant, the point however is that every single major block that had any relevance in Nullsec was deploying all of their toys into those 3 engagements, that was interesting, last time something that big happen was at B-R.
---
And sure in terms of isk loss B-R may have been bigger, (tbh i didn't check the numbers), which is why i specified assets that were on the field dwarfed B-R, which is an easily verifiable fact in terms of numbers of heavy assets.
---
&gt;or youre trying to spin it to make it look like interesting things are still happening in null.
---
I honestly can not see how you got this from my point. I literally said, that this is the most interesting thing to happen in nullsec in the past 10 months, which is a clear indication that i do not think that interesting stuff has been happening in nullsec during those 10 months. So how on earth did you assume that i was spinning something that i clearly wasn't?
---
My point was pretty clear, OP said most interesting thing in the past 2 years? well the war last year was the biggest since the Halloween War how does he not think that war was interesting?
---
&gt; PACK YOUR SHIT AND PREPARE TO WITHDRAW TO DELVE: This is stupid as hell but upon further discussion we will take CCP at their word and not assume this nonsense is a bug. As you guys know we were planning on fucking off soon after SH1 (as per the Init SOTA which leaked), but I'd hoped to mess around in Malpais a bit before we went home… but whatever. It's a good thing we burned the candle at both ends and nuked SH1 before this shit happened, but if ~generic pve bad guy vigilant tyrannos~ wants to clean up the drones for us, hey. At least the Drifters undock. ORGANIZED MOVE OPS WILL COME SOON (tm) - BEGIN THE PROCESS OF GETTING YOUR SHIT TOGETHER - DON'T MOVE ON YOUR OWN LIKE AN IDIOT - WE WILL HAVE AN EMERGENCY FIRESIDE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS (when we have more fucking answers) IN ONE HOUR - AT 1:00 EVE THIS IS NOT A DRILL, WE DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS, THIS IS A BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP AND WE MUST SECURE OUR LINE'S ASSETS IN DELVE AND WAIT OUT THE STORM

Drifters attacking was talked about last year.

What's a shelf?
---
it's in the recruit a friend thing
---
Isn’t trying to pass off a work of fiction as CCP endorsed fact (even as a joke) some kind of violation of trust between the CSM, CCP, and the Eve community? Doesn’t CCP hold CSM members to a higher standard and have rules against doing this kind of crap? You’re not off to a great start as a CSM member, IMHO.
---
Do you think OP thought they were making a super cool, spine chilling experience of a post with this one? Or does he know it teeters on cringey?
---
Those a regional gates bypassing Jive space
---
I called this a few days ago, the NPCs have broken their shackles and now bots literally are taking over the game.
---
Salty, Sharon?
---
Might be its a future to deal whit the citadel proliferation.
---
Had an unconfirmed report of 200 in a system earlier, and a separate report of 60 in another.
---
I'm not trying to sound cool. I'm just trying to tell the Goons what they've been telling everyone else.
---
No?
---
Just wait till the Triglavians and the Pirates that have been getting murdered for money for over a decade decide to follow suit.
---
A one month head start seems much less daunting than 13 years my G. I could be wrong it was just my opinion.
---
What if you click on everything in new?
---
don't worry thst goes away once you learn what you're doing
---
Sure looks like it.
---
I bet if this weren't happening to you, you'd be into it.
---
Plus it's not a bug.
---
you're an idiot and you sound like a tit sucking cunt
---
also, kindly go kill yourself you faggot
---
Dude I literally don’t care. You took a few T2 mods. Probably need them more than we did. Oh well
---
Wouldn't it be interesting if the drifter attack were to..... reinforce itself.... based on what is on grid. 600 titans? well here come 900 drifter doomsdays... talk about the lols.
---
It used to be 10% Damage, 3% RoF, 10% Velocity IIRC.  
---
1.1/0.97 = 13.4%  
---
1.08/0.92 = 17.4%  
---
So technically its better before stacking penalties.
---
Everyone fears a knife in the dark
---
Back in my day, we had to max out our skill points the OLD-FASHION way.   
---
None of this P2W skill injector nonsense.  
---
Damn kids these days can't even bother to spend 30 years of hard grinding to get the cap.
---
Delusional, that's all I got to say.
---
Oh stop it. It's ridiculous.  Typical snowflake mentally people whining about anything.  Jesus grow up
---
Wait aren’t you the guys that changed the ownership of a Keepstar so the loss wouldn’t shit up your killboards further? 
---
Pot meet kettle.
---
I wouldn't doubt it. I thought the reffing of a keepstar was a joke until went there and saw it.
---
Yeah I can read dipshit.   What I fail to see here is genuine gripe directed at drifters.   Seemed like more at the situation and bad timing to me.
---
Any chance you guys are recruiting?
---
I suspect that Ishtars will be the doctrine ship of choice for Deadco.
---
I briefly thought this was an eve onion article
---
Are you
---
Reverse goonposting
---
Man, I remember you talking about that on slack lol - it’s been so long, I can’t really believe it
---
Maybe they'll do two timers on an Astra; if it's low power, it dies, while high power gets taken to hull
---
True, I also think this is them testing their fancy ai
---
Okay so for real, is this the case? All I know is that I jumped into a fleet to defend my alliance's staging Keepstar against Drifters, had to see it for myself. When I was waiting for us to engage they did not have enough DPS to pause the thing. But I believe a gunned Keepstar was able to take care of them by itself. As the fleet landed a bomb hit the Drifer fleet and they all died.
---
&gt; Also how funny it is that NPCs can make Goons go home, but their opponents can't. 
---
***So*** funny!
---
Grr goons. Hat goons.
---
i think its funny that CCP had to come up with a new type of game play to stop Goons from burning the game down.  NC/PANFAM rolled over before the war even started.
---
I’m sure he sat around bitching and moaning for content waiting for someone else to create a fleet that he will conveniently either leave very early or not go at all only to log back in 5 mins after it’s over to bitch about a lack of content.  To point of unsubbing.  But instead of waking away (whaaaaaat??) shit posts on reddit about the shorty state of the game.
---
Everything is.
---
Oh, one or two.
---
Yes, our space too. Wipe it all out across the board.
---
The best time I had in TEST was rebuilding after Tribute and invading the south. Eviction trimmed our fat and the stakes were always high. It was amazing.
---
The Drifter comp that was attacking also had cruisers in it. I have only ever seen that in Abyssal runs and certain events, but within the site only.
---
I highly doubt that a bug would cause Drifter to spawn in with that comp and at the same time target stuctures the way that they have done here.
---
90+? And if that number is somehow accurate than what of the nearly equivalent numbers across the rest of the game? Everyone's shit is being bashed.
---
Inb4 the Drifter fleets will return, but also call reinforcements and scale based on the size of the defenders + their ships ;);)
---
Are you?
---
Hon hon hon
---
&gt;What I fail to see here is genuine gripe
---
"WE DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS, THIS IS A BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP"
---
We'RE NOt sAlTy
---
True. I'm legit excited to see what they are up to
---
Oh give me a break, wow, 90 goon structures dropped into a shield timer in a surprise attack that is literally space wide. Are you seriously conflating shield timer with a kill? Are you actually \*stupid\*?
---
“Had”
---
Fuck that, we employ them. We have a SIG dedicated to space terrorism.
---
holy fuck am I in goonception
---
Sotiyo refining is now my favourite meme.
---
Any form of  *Deus ex Machina* will seem unreal to anybody.
---
Am I?
---
You blue everyone not in an NPC corp
---
Only thing missing is drifters posting on reddit about alliances not forming to defend...
---
quick, check to see how many layers of irony we are deep
---
More structures = more burnout
---
Isn't it ironic? If something goes in goons favor they're the loudest "adapt or die" crowd. If something threatens them CCP fucked up. Top fucking kek.
---
So this is a nice little troll post because CSM does not have the power to put a event like this in motion. Nice try though but try to be smarter on how you do this or next time you will be breaking NDA and be banned from eve :3
---
Was getting your structures RFd part of your plan?
---
Yes. Just what we wanted. More PVE.
---
What about a lot of isk?
---
The worst part is i can unironically see you doing this
---
as a small guy in null sec. This is fucking awesome. I actually see a future for my small corp now.
---
You are clearly not a Supercarrier pilot and therefor shouldn't be commenting here. Malleus are the Amarrian Heavy Fighter-Bombers used against caps, Ametat the High Angle Anti-Subcap ones. Even then, sorry but the 20B Isk ship that takes 2 years to properly train into ***should be able to kill any singular subcap with ease.*** If you're dead set on fighting a super, bring a fleet, or don't bitch that you died.   
---
Do we see incursion runners going in by themselves then complaining about the outcome? No, so why do it with a Player Asset. Theyre not even terribly expensive anymore so hating on them is just lazy tbh. People who feel the need to keep nerfing supers are a special breed of Pinecone.
---
There's actually been an interesting take on that being a valid tactic where they keep their ship assets safe in NPC Station and don't give CCP and Goonswarm propaganda / advertisement content while also doing hit and runs.
---
They lose sov but Goonswarm proved sov doesn't make the alliance, strategy and organization does.
---
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
---
Are you flairbaiting? I am the confuse.
---
You’re wrong. They are hitting all stature sizes of all types.
---
*all of them*
---
I'm going to crash this server...with no survivors!
---
Like I said, this is day 1. This entire expansion so far had been about escalating phases.
---
&gt;also 'we'? you've been on the CSM for 5 seconds, dude. you haven't worked on a damn thing with them yet.
---
Imagine taking the bait and getting salty at an obvious shitpost
---
This is not true. It is only capsuleer ships that have no bridge, all other ships (excluding concord, drifters and trig) have crews and bridges. This is why most eve ships seem to have bridge areas.
---
Ironically the corp i was in before quitting is now in goons so you could say i'm not
---
&lt;3
---
I didn’t have a 13 year head start, maybe 18-22 months, and this was from back before alpha/omega, a big deal for sure, but had I started from scratch I would be in the same place.
---
I had to train for the ships and equipment I use most now for isk making, and fun.
---
I just happen to be able to use all t2 stuff up to my racial cruisers, but most my work and fighting is in Strats/Asteros. If they weren’t called for for doctrine ships I’d extract down to T3D, and T2 frigs.
---
Imagine being so smooth brain that having 3 blobs on a field makes it interesting
---
I WAS SO HAPPY READING THAT WHY DID YOU TAKE IT AWAY
---
You think no one, big or small, being able to deploy anywhere ever is a good thing?
---
If I remember correctly, according to lore, most capsuleer ships are regular ships that were retrofitted.  Even if captain's chair is buried in a goo-filled egg, there'd still need to be provisions made for the rest of the non-capsuleer crew.

Pretty much all high class doctrines have a Lif or Ninazu as the Logi.

Only if you swear on your memorial day.
---
 Very jaggy lines
---
I highly doubt that that was really the case when 40 dudes in Leshaks can break a turbo blinged Ninazu in Triage (and faxes outside of triage are garbage). Also, Arty Loki/Mach or Ruse Cruise Barghest comps can volley through ships even with multiple faxes on field.
---
Classic Dave, honestly
---
Drifter attacks could be a compelling and fun endgame PVE for capital ships and large fleets if the rewards are worth it. Otherwise it would just be annoying and unfun.
---
If anyone else reads that comment, and feels the same need...
---
Send me a PM.
---
I'm organizing a war against nullsec as a whole based out of Thera.
---
Its awesome ;)
---
&gt;Many corps I’ve spoken to seem to heavily focus on killboards
---
People think the killboard actually matters, but dont understand ***how*** it matters. If you look at a corp killboard and see nothing but green there's some things to consider. 
---
Are they better pilots, did they sit around and clipboard the enemy fleet and rage ping to 2v1 in an armor brawl, or did they go up against just worse corps for the past week or two? I mean shit. You look at my killboard and it's just straight green, but that's because I usually fly longer range shit that keeps me out of danger. Not because I'm risk adverse, but because the fit and ship necessitates longer ranges. 
---
The only time the killboard matters is when determining pvp experience and how much training and help they'll need to learn how to shoot boys. 
---
Zkill as a system is stupidly easy to game, and anyone who focuses on it should instantly be a nonexistant corp/alliance to you.
---
I agree let New Eden Burn
---
&gt;It's close to impossible to counter 1000 eagles too...
---
I feel like everyone here seems to have the impression that counters have to be OP by nature. All a counter has to do is exploit a weakness or overcome a strength in a fashion that increases the effectiveness of your own numbers by a significant degree. It’s not even just ships either. It can include fitting and tactic changes as well. And the more specific your counters get, there can even be glaring and increasingly more problematic drawbacks as well.
---
A fair few groups run/have run Batghests in the past, EPSYN and SOUND did it a couple times last year and we still have some people who fly them in Navy Drake fleets.
---
Look, it's like this: Say you have a million dollars and I have a thousand, all in hundred dollar bills. Now say that one out of every three bills is counterfeit. You're going to have a LOT more counterfeit notes, even though we both have roughly the same proportion of counterfeit bills. We have a TON of structures, so if you pick a random structure out of all the structures in nullsec, it's more likely to belong to us than to, say, NCdot. 
---
Of course, I'm operating under the assumption that they're targeting structures instead of spawning in random systems and then choosing random structures once they arrive. Either option is valid. Hell, for all we know, devs are commanding the fleets and NONE of the targets are random. I have to say I'm enjoying the mystery.
---
lol - no.
---
You might be an above average gamer. You might just be really good at Eve. You might just really like Eve and spend a lot of time playing it. Either way I'd argue the average gamer isn't willing to and or may not have the time to do the same hence the game's retention issues.
---
Honestly I hardly jumped back into Eve after years gone. The game is awesome in many ways and imo a disaster in others. Again these are just my very low information low exposure to the game thoughts.
---
I'm sure you know better. 
---
Sincerely.
---
&gt;Groups like MCAV don't give a single shit
---
I've been trying to convince Dex to force people joining leadership to literally delete their entire hanger as their final step of indoctrination into "it's just pixels"
---
I agree they should do away with the wings and add two large spherical engines in the back. Along with multiple little lights that orbit them.
---
Like it or not, it is the most defining feature of Eve online. The battles between thousands of players.
---
It might not be interesting to you, it might be boring to you, but for thousands of other players it isn't. and for hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of people that hear about eve online, it is often the most interesting part of the game for them.
---
I would seriously laugh if they ever hit that pipe !
---
Taking the bait? My post is literally pointing out how obvious the bait is you mouth breathing regard.
---
Lmao dude this was a perfect time to show up. Everything is in chaos, just as it should be!
---
Welcome to EVE Online, and remember to aim for the veldspar and pyrox. :)
---
Who cares? it literally means nothing if there is no follow up, and so far we have seen no evidence to suggest that there will be a followup. I would love to be proven wrong, but faith in CCP ability to create something interesting with drifters has long left my soul.
---
&gt;another 2 c2/c5
---
2/5 null is unironically where pvp corps go to die. But in all seriousness, some good corps went to those holes and other corps followed just because they want to be "elite pvpers". Just find a Corp whose atmosphere you like and send it. 
---
I was originally in a really bad c2 Corp. Not "bad", but we did krab nights where we brought basilisks and ABCs. I talked shit with those guys, shot nerds, huffed gas, and died quite often. If I didnt like the people in MCAV then I would've won eve a year ago.
---
Make palatine keepstars form a drifter suppression zone with a lightyear based radius
---
clearly OP doesn't know how goonwaffe works
---
Stop being angsty all the time and maybe you'll post better
---
Alot of olmeca bad posting yikers
---
Contrast paints !
---
inb4 this event was scripted in the game already ages ago, drifters were known to collect corpses, maybe they've surpassed a certain threshold of corpse collection and are now unleashing the second stage of their existence.
---
Nah just base, wash, highlights, and detailing.  :-)
---
from what I've seen each battleship DDs only once so like only like 1-2 shiny toys would die sadly
---
how dare you point out smaller groups and less effective numbers fold against  NPC groups.
---
Why would they? Why would anyone with any infrastructure at all? If the drifter behaviour today is an indication of what they're going to keep doing, then basically any null group is forced to stay at home, permanently, outside of daytrip ops through wormholes.
---
really wish you would have kept the mystery of it up
---
Not gonna lie dude. I was on board.
---
This. Was. My. First. Thought! 
---
I would die laughing if after all this, SF died to npcs because their whole alliance is one guy.
---
If a lot of people are saying something is what they experienced it probably means their is an issue that is just not very visible to leadership.
---
I'm sure that everyone in lowsec and wormhole space is completely safe from this, especially since CCP is totally beholden to the Goon's influence in the CSM.
---
Nah he’d have to go to ascee
---
In before ban
---
Cool, which in game corp do I cut the rent cheques to?
---
I mean you can buy a stolen one, but it will dis very quickly outside of major super umbrella space.
---
&gt; for all we know, devs are commanding the fleets and NONE of the targets are random
---
I would actually love this. Reminds me of the old days in Ultima Online when the devs would control NPCs for events and stuff.
---
does that bus/train have billboards underneath it...?
---
Do a flip OP
---
It's a bit daunting but gives me something to we work towards.
---
mechanically, we can blue the drifters. seeing as how we haven't pressed that button yet...
---
Also, mechanically, alliances can blue drifters. Wtf.
---
First thoughts: Please go back to the old 100m3 drone bandwidth VNI.
---
It may come as a surprice, but were all gonna die
---
&gt;and rifter fits
---
I mean back when I first started my null Corp threw me rifters and said "go tackle" so I did.
---
Or ya know, they don’t do that, that works too

Lol I don’t think so, I just like games like Factorio, Cities/Simcity, and SPACE.
---
I love Eve because of the mix of exploration, solo, and social, emergent gameplay.
---
I just threw a small essay at you because here is someone interested in the game, asking for info, then along comes you.
---
Someone who didn’t like what the game is, who doesn’t play, and is presenting the worst interpretations of the most controversial aspects of the meta-game. I don’t know why you are here.
---
The catch is that the vast majority strike out on their own, fail, and then quit. At least us mindless drones are still here.....if that's a positive?
---
Everything after The Long Night. I actually liked that episode. More people should have died, and the series should have ended there, but it was still a good episode.
---
I ran just see it 6 months from now. 
---
"Guys, why are there no wars?"
---
"Because every one is too busy fly swatting npcs instead of having fights. "
---
Ok.
---
If I had one I would, it seems like a good experience.
---
Hell of a way to build trust between the players and yourself as a CSM rep
---
Hard to say exactly, but Sansha _has_ been involved for quite some time.
---
Prior to Incursions, Sansha invaded Angel space, it was believed that it was there that Sansha found his wormhole generator.
---
During incursions, Sansha was seen in Jove space, but we were later informed by the directorate that Sansha has been removed.
---
When Caroline's Star opened up new wormholes, we discovered many occupied. One, Thera, was occupied by the SOE, but another was occupied by... Sansha.
---
Sansha is "Case Green Magic". Hijacking ships in the southern space lanes. This is believed to be the precursor of the Project Nova story.
---
Case Green Magic and Case Red Gamma (Drifter/Triglavians) have both been moved under the new AEGIS department of CONCORD.
---
Sansha was encountered by the Triglavians, who refer to them as "Hivelinked Corrupted Nerodyna". The Trig wish to "Extirpate" Sansha. It is unknown how they encountered one another, but some of it is covered in the HCN trinary data records. 
---
Beyond this, your guess is as good as mine.
---
Confirmed you're a veteran Eve player. Newbies don't talk like that
---
Alas, FREEEEEEDOOOOOOOMMMM
---
If you're an accountant at CCP, sure.
---
Truly one of my finest hours.
---
&gt; It is unknown how they encountered one another, but some of it is covered in the HCN trinary data records.
---
well if i had to guess, if we found sansha in one of the wormholes after caroline's star, and the drifters were also in wormholes i guess that would be the likely place that they encountered one another?
---
Well a lot has happened since then, but a lot of it hasn't been widely focused on, or has been simply written off as "trig stuff"
---
That would be the best shot in the arm this game's had in years.
---
we're over half way to christmas. a  year goes faster than you think.
---
No they encountered the Trig.... which is the odd part.
---
We also don't know how any of the three made it to Trig space, nor when and how the Trig first started coming into K-Space. 
---
There is a suspicion that Sansha and the Drifter (other) has encountered one another, it is unknown who one that encounter.
---
Take the time to learn how the game works I seen players that don’t understand basic mechanic or never understand why they died. Still they can fly  lot of ships. Go read read by time you understand it you’ll be train.
---
Totally worth it and you can still make the difference .
---
Equally heinous
---
People joining these new player groups is part of what got us into the shitty nullsec stagnation we're in today. This is a horrible idea.
---
It’s possible, but more efficient to have alts beyond a certain point so you’re able to do 3 100 day queues simultaneously rather than 1 huge queue. Or be your own fax for supers. Until you get to like capital gameplay it’s only a convenience like flying a scanning ship beside you so you can fit fully combat
---
Not other than ratting is more efficient
---
You sound like you've been in Goons for way too long. I don't think that's ever been the case. I was a wormholer for a while, and you have to make your own content. I just got tired of flying halfway across the galaxy and only killing bots or AFK FW campers. 
---
You can try to hunt in big block space. but getting 100 Titans dropped on a small gang gets just as old
---
I had one of those back in the day as well, such a cool item, wish I still had mine.
---
Go for it.
---
Try all the things, and do more of what you find fun.

If you want to be in Nullsec, join one of the newbie-focussed groups - I am biased to Brave Newbies, but all of Karmafleet, Pandemic Horde and Brand Newbros are good choices.
---
If you're happy with living in Empire, Eve University works well.
---
I don't know of any newbie-focussed wormhole or losec groups, but Im sure someone will pipe up with suggestions.
---
And remember, it's about fun per hour, not isk per hour.
---
i mean, if the drifters were in wormholes then while the trig were scouring wormholes for the drifters then they may have stumbled upon the sansha wormhole?
---
&gt;We also don't know how any of the three made it to Trig space
---
probably the same way we get to abyssal space? i just look at those fillament things as like a personal wormhole generator. create own wormhole -&gt; leads to abyssal space. no reason why it wouldn't work the other way, that's exactly what the origin gate does in the third room.
---
Totally serious question: what do you see playing out differently now vs yesterday?
---
I hear Tribute is open.
---
Welcome to eve man, if u end up getting fucked over, send me a tell in game and il get u some cash to replace it. 
---
Remember eve is very hard og very big, Trust me give it a month or 2 and you will be hooked for life.
---
Fly safe
---
No one is bitching now. But we'll see if that's the case if the invasion goes to final timer and people start losing structures. Especially so if people keep losing their bling PVE boats that are invincible towards players (local chat, bots, 3rd party warning programs etc).
---
Having another party challenge sov would probably be a great way to mix up the game.  The chaos would be great for gameplay
---
Think about it. This was just the drifters. I really think this is ccp making it so that large coalitions can own alot of space. But they are going to have to do the insane upkeep it is to own all that space. Meanwhile my fortizar and azbel and raitaru are easy to defend, even 3 or 4 systems would be easy to defend. so the smaller you are the less likely ytou are of being attacked statistically. 
---
I mean I think if the triglavians invade next it will be a good thing as it will force coalitions and alliances to scale down their operations. Or do the crazy upkeep required. Either way! Thats a win win for me as the small guy.
---
Drifters aren't true Jove, they are some off shoot. True jove went extinct, as far as I know.
---
Olmeca! This is amazing. Can we remove ASSET SAFETY from nullsec after this? 
---
Peoples reason of “i want to take a 5 month break and not lose my stuff or i’ll quit forever” isn’t enough of an excuse anymore
---
Now your just lacking reading comprehension, Dino's not very smart always breeding defectively...
---
You would blue the color blue if you could because your scared of red... Or anything with guns.... Your like highsec carebears with an alliance in null
---
Eve has done it before, too. There used to be a whole team of (mostly) volunteers who played NPC faction characters for various events. The ones that surrounded the release of covert ops cloaks is still my favorite.
---
What are they shooting?
---
No, no aaaaand no
---
Well the filament device was discovered on the Vedmak captured by CONCORD. Additionally, the Trig doesn't seem very interested (or originally aware) of the intruders. I suspect all of this has something to do with the portal device, and possibly the nexus in the Drifter hives. 
---
So many unknowns. I have watched the messages from Zorya probably 50 times...
---
They should offer a million dollar prize for the AT, oh wait... no AT this year....
---
yah yah I getcha. It's just, people leak DM chats all the fuckin time, and the only time its prosecuted is when it was supposed to be secret. This is not that time.
---
Its self serving, but if watching the drifters burning nullsec makes you excited, consider joining a player corp doing the same.
---
I'm organizing a large scale movement based out of Thera to fight nullsec as a whole.
---
PM me if interested.
---
I'm not affiliated with TEST or any null sec block, but i'll trade you one Nidhoggur-class carrier with complimentary fitting for one of your battleships, with at least one gun fitted.

Do not speak for us without my permission, Apollo. You would be wise to consult me before speaking to the capsuleers.
---
So, 3D printed stuff... can you sand that sort of plastic/resin down smooth, or are you stuck with the layer lines? 
---
Just asking here since I assume you would know. I've been considering a 3D printer, but if everything I make basically becomes infinite mould lines it's a bit too expensive for my tastes.
---
Well shit. Now I dont know what to do for money that isnt a 60 day skill sink. Darn.
---
What's funny? It's accurate...
---
Thin your paints, several thin coats. Voila. For the details, just watch our Lord and Saviour Duncan paint on youtube.
---
He did, my friend, he did. This is the best timeline.
---
I'm throwing money at my screen for this right now.
---
I attended Eve Down Under 2014?. Cant remember the exact year. It was really fun but there was a lot of clicking among the big groups (mainly PL and Goons) who had groups of like 30 people all circle jerking which was kinda annoying and not very welcoming. Also as a small gang/solo lowsec PvPer I felt kinda lonely as there were basically like 2 of us. 
---
However all barriers broke down during the pub crawl, everyone got shitfaced and had a great time. CCP Mimic ran out of cigs and bummed like 5 off me promising that she’d buy a pack later (she didn’t lel). One guy got super drunk, stole some party hats from a group that was having a bachelorette party, went around asking people where they live in Eve, wrote it on the party hat and plonked it on our heads. Great times.
---
Well no shit it would be interesting to people who've never played eve
---
Doesn't look like they're hitting Astrahuses.
---
Too bad someone from your alliance admitted the truth yesterday in local.
---
Years and still works in a way today.
---
You can use several methods to smooth them out, like XTC-3D.  I didnt use that for this model, but my friend and I are learning about 3d printing and this was one of our first experiments.
---
The printers are getting cheaper for sure. We printed this on an Ender 3, and this basically cost us pennies to print in material.
---
Are you retarded or did you just see "Alliances that only care about the MER and Rorqual numbers are going to whine about it constantly" and assume he was talking about goons?
---
They expect one of us in the wreckage brother!
---
No thanks, I'm already in MCAV. We get enough fights in null as-is.
---
Lovely. Thanks. Guess it's research time. 
---
o7
---
Fair enough, nothing but love for MCAV :)
---
The operation is a bit more serious then just roaming randomly in nullsec, but I feel you :) keep up the great work.
---
Hi mate in case you missed it's just a joke unfortunately :)
---
What a shame he didn't take your advice!
---
The Long Night was a pretty shit episode on its own. Relative to everything that came after it it doesn't look so bad, but it's still a pretty bad episode. Very beautiful visually but utterly stupid in terms of writing.
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the /r/eve crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
fighting bots with NPCs is actually brilliant, they can't detect a player threat when there is no player :thinkingmeme:
---
Damn, i thought it was the best thing to ever happen to eve.
---
The amount of Salt generated by this... Astronomical lmao. Great shit post man. Keep making waves the non Bloc community has your back
---
As a proteus with 700 dps tank and gank, 1k+ m/s speed unscrammable and and a 11km scram,
---
wat?
---
CCPls use drifters to delete goons
---
You wouldn't lie to me about that, you are a pirate and that means trust.
---
Do you want to buy these fighters or not?
---
Something in the middle. Sure, larger entities will largely rebuild but there will also be small vacuums for smaller groups to fill. Most of them will be crushed, some will not, and the cycle will continue.
---
Even if the *status quo* is ultimately preserved, it will come at the cost of the large blocs redefining a lot of how they operate in space. And it will make nullsec a hell of a lot more dangerous, which is a very good thing.
---
I'd hope this current state is like a wildfire, sweeping through null and burning out all the dead wood so new growth can come in. Hell, a perpetual raging inferno would be great too, with drifters adapting their strategies and fielding new vessels every so often to keep everyone on their toes. I'd love to see that extended to wormhole space as well. Make people have to relearn and readapt strategies on the regular, so you can't just settle into a routine.
---
This is an exciting time for New Eden, make no mistake. Maybe there's hope for this game yet.
---
It is obviously interesting to people who play eve as well, otherwise nobody would show up for these huge fights, and there wouldn't be mega threads every time a big battle happens, with people demanding real time updates for those who are not present in the fight, there wouldn't be hundreds and occasionally thousands of eve players flooding to twitch streams when a big battle happens.
---
Again, like it or not, those big battles have a larger audience both inside as well as outside the game that are interested in participating on it and or reading about it, than any other aspect of the game.
---
I see Kent Brockman, I upvote
---
&gt;Except for when people watch local
---
.... what's local?
---
They are! All you have to do is exit your pod in space on a jove observatory!
---
If it was just NPSI fleets with no commitment and no requirement I ever go up against my corp, sure, I'd be down. If you're asking me to join a corp then I'd have to politely decline.
---
&gt;I for one would love to see the large blocs threatened by Drifters and what not
---
My only concern is that this is going to set a entry limit for people to enter null, and will instead of removing citadel spam, will instead depopulate 90% of nullsec.
---
"those guys that do pve all day, they're gonna hate this new pve thing"
---
I like the video and I appreciate commentary a lot. However I think this particular video is a little bit too long for a single fight with 1 retribution kill. I’d recommend a few more fights in 1 video, with slightly shorter commentary on each fight.
---
I mean all this is one reason why I had so much support.
---
I just wonder some of these people make other Goons feel embarrassed with this grr Olmec stuff lol.
---
We have no need of your inferior vessels.
---
Only a explicitly specific number of them!
---
doubtful mate honestly. They barely have time to look up from the Rorq herd to bash some shit uncontested in Tribute.
---
I doubt its been that high for very long. I imagine that number was significantly smaller before the free-to-play switch. Also considering how fast gaming (and PC gaming with it) has been growing the last decade, its not entirely unreasonable to assume somewhere between 1-2% of the over 1 billion PC gamers went so far as to try it. It also helps that EVE often makes it onto MMO lists and national/gaming news circuits regularly.
---
Hey, join 'sons of bob' and we can chat.
---
I don't mind wormholers coming and joining us.
---
I wouldn't say we wouldn't shoot MCAV, but if you're in our fleet if its not purple, shoot it in the name of bob.
---
I'd certainly say we wouldn't go out of our way to shoot them, if you know what I mean.  I land on something on a gate, its getting shot.
---
The reward should be keeping your assets
---
I mean if this isnt the most self congratulatory shit
---
Then they drop a few unneeded structures? They have already proven that no one can match their fleet so the structure grind isn't needed
---
I was going to say playing a game shouldn't feel like a chore but also this is EVE
---
Well first, BB you confused me for a minute about who you were talking about. I was wondering what the Querious Fight Club was doing in Tribute.
---
Anyway..
---
Guessing the very obvious over-reaction/hyperbole/theater was to facilitate motivating thousands of personalities to move thousands of ships quickly. Seems a common enough motivation technique.
---
Withholding judgement on the "feature" for now. If it stops at reinforcing structures and doesn't go out into anomalies and kill ships I will call it a fail. If it kills undefended structures and inattentive players/bots then it is a win.
---
Haha yes and Imperium and Legacy aren't allies either right?
---
I don't have 80 alt accounts to multibox, and getting 50 Titans dropped on anything bigger than a shuttle isn't my idea of fun. 
---
Drifters seem to be the only collective group brave enough to hit Goons where they live, so it will have to be a war of attrition.
---
There are many reasonable people among them, it's just they are less vocal in my threads
---
Ya but that can certainly be changed...
---
Even though big toys dying often would be good for the game, only having 1 DD keeps them from being too hard to kill
---
This.  If it's challenging, and scales so smaller entities don't just evac at the first sign of trouble, it could be fun.
---
Anything that shakes up the game is a good thing in my opinion.
---
Figures it would take something from CCP instead of NC/PL growing a set to fight the Goons.  No balls for another B-R eh?
---
When I tell my 80+ year old parents that we have fights between thousands of players all at the same time even they are impressed.  F you pong.
---
Seriously though, I agree with you.
---

I've had a moment like that. Spent a week all excited about doing a night climb/repel. Finally get to the top and had a sudden moment of clarity as to what the fuck I was actually doing. Unfortunately for me, I didn't have the option to just close the tab and forget it happened.
---
&gt;Delve is about to become a bot v NPC warzone
---
can players attack NPC null yet? gotta have it both ways.
---
Yes it’s very worth. The only thing I would suggest is make sure you use a referral link for the bonus skill points and pick up the $5 starter pack. Total gives you 1.75M free SP to allocate as you please, which means you can pretty quickly get into any / multiple cruisers fit well.
---
I think he meant you and your pets.
---
CCP in it's infitinite wisdom decided to interfere in Pvp sandbox by buffing rorquals and making it PvE sandbox.
---
Honhonhon.
---
I'm just saying that only having one burn on use dd is something they could adjust if they need to.  Death to all of the things!
---
Since invasion they span wit the sleeper together and scanning stuff
---
Hi Olmeca,
---
Have you seen anyone besides goons complain?
---
Thanks
---
Yea it could be interesting if they gave them like 3-4 DD shots per ship so they are still threatening but not impossible to kill
---
Yeah I just meant them
---
The pandas are getting hit too.
---
&gt; did you just see "... whine about it constantly" and 
---
immediately a goon started whining about it
---
I'm sorry
---
Did you forget that goons stationed camped a fleet in PR- for 30 days straight around the clock? I think the AI would burn out first.
---
Next week:
---
 - Removed the bug where Drifters could spawn out of high security space
---
I would say there should be an entry limit anyway since the intended progress can be considered as high --&gt; low --&gt; null 
---
Would also freshen up the other parts especially lowsec which is also stale /forgotten
---
Reminds me of rorquals and other changes made by CCP that completely nerfed NCPL playstyle in favor of empire buildings.
---
Having empires do the upkeep work is a good thing for the game actually.
---
what can I do to make it up to you mr drifter overlord sir?
---
Yes I agree there should be SOME entry to go to nullsec, but the entry shouldn't be "be prepared for endless siege by drifters"
---
What is this, Twitch?
---
I'm sorry, are you on the Serenity server maybe? As far as I know there were two major wars occurring before this took place.
---
It's still possible.
---
I'm fairly certain the rule is "don't misquote, and don't quote out of context" .  It's when you impersonate a GM or try to bend GM words to mean something other than what they were meant that you get in trouble.
---
Well let's watch it first. I am guessing that higher density space will be more prone to attacks as in delve esoteria und such. The less players sitting on each other the less drifters shoot stuff
---
Oh word? Cool. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Stunt got banned for less than this post.
---
its called "Glassing" reeeeeee
---
What are the worthwhile ones?
---
Is this the birth of a new copypasta?
---
fake
---
As a wormholer, the worst part of this Drifter invasion so far are these absolute shit tier memes
---
Shut the fuck up Mall Cop
---
oh shit. GOTG wont like this at all then
---
For free, maybe.
---
yeah, I can't find the quote but I swear I remember seeing a dev say it somewhere on reddit when people were calling for someone's head or something dumb for sharing a GM message.  Pointing out that the TOS rule applied to private messages only and that GM answers to generic questions were not private.  I could be wrong though.  /u/ccp_falcon could probably clarify if I'm mistaken.
---
For posterity, this is the TOS line that everyone is drawing from:
---
&gt;You may not publish private communications from CCP, their agents or representatives or EVE Online volunteers without authorization.
---
It’s a quality shit post mate. Don’t be that guy
---
can you do jita next ?
---
I don't know if it was EVE or some other MMO data, but roughly half of players who register don't even play the game at all.
---
Thank you for the intel.
---
Ever since you got elected to the CSM your posting quality has been top notch. 🔥🔥🔥
---
Now map all the systems out and see if they're trying to send us a hidden message!
---
It’s ok if he got you man. It was a good shit post.
---
Major? Hehahaha
---
more pics
---
&gt; It’s a quality shit post mate.
---
it's the same quality as every other 'fix nullsec' suggestion post.
---
&gt;One day you’ll be relevant enough to make it to the CSM.
---
fucking hope not - i generally refuse to work if i'm not being paid.
---
Bro this is old news. There’s pve content to be had back in delve.
---
This happens when you don't keep cattle in check smh
---
destroying multiple regions of space, and multi-thousand person alliances mobilizing supercaps doesn't count as major, got it thanks bud
---
not something i've tried but can you disable sound in all but one and make that one play even when minimized ?
---
Looks like you are working pretty hard are getting triggered. Hope olmeca is sending you some iskies.
---
&gt;fictional
---
REEEEEEE I GOT HYPE FOR A MINUTE
---
Post a killmail that isn’t fifteen of you in t3s on a gate against a lone three day old war target in a t1.
---
might be worth exploring for citadel wrecks in a few days.
---
I did. It's a dickbutt.
---
triggered by what?
---
all i did was point out how obvious his post was - you all seem to be far more triggered by that given how many downvotes i seem to have accrued in less than an hour. 
---
seems i've managed to get a bigger reaction from you guys than olmeca did.
---
Bahahaha. The solution to TZ tanking is being hazed by NPCs
---
Ohhhhhh man you got me again Dave! You so clever!
---
Looks like a Gallente Faction Fortizar
---
Ohhhhh snap. You got me Dave! You got me!
---
apparently they are forced to read r/eve
---
As long as all those bots subs are paid up everything is working exactly as intended.
---
https://youtu.be/BERd61bDY7k?t=23
---
This is the second time that i have been told that people expect better of me. I personally expect better of you.
---
You mean forcing groups to split up and spread out in order to properly interact with their neighbors? Because if no one can ever deploy, pretty sure boredom will force something like that real fast.
---
In another version of Eve where small groups are constantly skirmishing with each other and either no megapowers exist or they have no interaction with the small groups, then the need to deploy wouldn't even exist whether it was possible or not.
---
Pretty much this.
---
This I can get behind. Controlled systems get progressively larger pirate/NPC invasions to the point where they have to have an all out war with the NPCs and destroy some mega-stronghold that is slathered in various timers (of course).
---
At the end of the day if left unchecked ALL null-space would return to pirate faction control. (this also means dead alliances and lazy anchors would get chewed up and returned to the great tritatium cloud in the sky.
---
Not yet but when they do make it, possible it won't be via killing newbs in ventures, so you'll be left out.
---
Downvoted, not a real haiku
---
They wish to be titled Vigilant Tyrannos in this case. It is also good to see that Vigilant Tyrannos has finally returned too the home regions.
---
Hahaha suck that dick, bitch
---
Wow... Like once a month... and 2 more stations pop up the next day.  Then it's back to carebears in null.
---
The goon victim complex that CCP is out to get them runs even deeper than tapi's victim complex
---
What... Codes usual prey of 1 newbro high-sec miner vs 20 catalysts proving too hard for you kids these days without [James?](https://www.memesmonkey.com/images/memesmonkey/9b/9bd92f61e44c6404e7cdf89f121dc435.jpeg) Need an enemy that truly wont put up a fight?
---
We knew in advance from our dev members this was coming so we smartly let the goons think they were winning by killing them for us.
---
Goons the only ones crying right now.
---
You're right. Nothing wrong about having fun. He's an adult, so totally up to him what to do, but i think there were at least a couple players concerned about him welping ALOT of supers and not for the welping part ... but more for the fact that some people buy ISK with real money to replace them very fast again and both things combined here over a longer time, especially when some of the more unpleasant players on stream put alot of stress on him, might not so good on the long term (financial wise).
---
I think that was brought up already at some point, and the last think we wanna see is someone putting himself into a bad financial situation, because there are some retarded people out there abusing the way he reacts on stream.
---
This entire thread is a dumpster fire
---
Jita 4-4 must die
---
It is free just do it. Join an alpha friendly corp like Pandemic Horde, wait a few weeks before you pay anything.
---
Were you born retarded or is there a school you can attend to assist along the way?
---
just casual reddit nazis
---
No system inside beehive though
---
*Thonking*
---
lmao drifters gonna show they TEEETH
---
He's to good for us. Actually undocks and does things
---
Dont give the bot makers ideas ;D
---
I don't know why, but you are. According to pings/fireside.
---
No this is reddit. R/eve to be exact. Are you lost, traveller?
---
*now kith*
---
Please contact Ben Booley in game.
---
&gt;Please keep it up, eve needs to be dangerous again.
---
Not so happy about that danger coming from NPCs while PVP players leave the game in droves, but I guess this is the future.
---
Took a long break from Eve was in wormbro came back a few months ago sad to find out they are no more, :(
---
Come and join us, and burn all of nullsec!
---
Will do!
---
You missed QN-6J2 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/455461282829565994/593679108341235712/unknown.png
---
Talking in the thitd person now, hmmmm
---
red donut, more delicious?
---
I am probably gonna be called out as arrogant but the reason for his opinion is probably goons winning too much.
---
But in my opinion while it would be difficult to say how EVE would have become, at the time Panfam was regarded as the just strong if not stronger going into the war. The war truly tipped the balance of power towards goons, but had it tipped towards Panfam the game will be regarded as just as stale as it is because of the lack of true conflict with a neutered Goons. To make EVE interesting, there needs to be a real war with equally powerful participants (or better, three way wars), and how to ignite that is a difficult question to answer.
---
I for one welcome our drifter overlords
---
Hi softie
---
Dolphins will be put down again until morale improves
---
Donut is the American way of spelling it, which is wrong. Doughnut is the English (and correct) way if spelling it.
---
Your mocking words mean nothing to us, capsuleer. As your ship's crew is to you, are you to the Drifters. 
---
You have built monuments to your conquests, and have fortified what you believe to be your space with them. We have put them into a state of panic with little effort and far fewer vessels than you would have used to do the same.
---
What is more mocking? Empty words, or being shown for the ineffective cowards you are?
---
That was literally me baiting you. Congratulations.
---
First advice:  if possible join a Corp, doesn't matter if it's the wrong Corp, you will still learn a lot. 
---
Second advise: don't burn yourself trying to get shit done in your first week, EVE takes time, you will learn that. 
---
Third advice: if you are doing something you don't like, then stop doing it, there is plenty to do. 
---
Fourth advise (in conjunction with the first one): if you joined a "toxic Corp" don't hesitate to leave them, some newbros, myself included, stay because they feel they own the Corp something (respect maybe), you don't own shit to anyone in this game, today's friends may be your enemy's tomorrow and vice versa. You will eventually find something you love and people who also love to do that fame thing. 
---
Fly safe mate o7
---
Ive been out of the EVE loop for a while, whats going on with the drifters in nullsec? is there an actual threat of structures being destroyed or is that just a meme?
---
I can definitely take more pics. It's in perfect condition stayed in a drawer for the last 12 years lol
---
Can I bring Drake?
---
I don't see test on your list. Are you saying they are already blue?
---
&gt;P.S. please don't gank the inconspicuous venture mining over there.
---
That’s not how this works, dude.
---
When your ship dies, and it will, don’t feel too bad about it. Ships die all the time.
---
Welcome to EVE!
---
Fucking had me to the end
---
Like I said before, and these are the last seconds I'll spend on you, you waste of oxygen. It must be a tough life being such a piece of shit. I pity you.
---
I just double checked there in the ol Declaration of Independence and it's says we can spell donut any way we please.
---
Like CCP handed out those T2 original blueprints to BoB, once again #ccpgames came to rescue for NC. Who is formerly known as IT Alliance who was formerly known as Band Of Brothers who was formerly known as CCP ( Cookies Cake Pie ) Good job CCP, you never disappoint us.
---
Nice screenshots 👌
---
Wow that's a super cool diagram!  Thanks for the reply.
---
Is there more of them out there?
---
I really like it, anyway, the one thing that worries me is the fact that small corps will not be able to defend their shit from drifters hence if you live in nullsec for the fun or w/e you kind of have to join a bigger entity to defend your stuff
---
Oh, I didn't know that.
---
How bought them donuts eh???
---
Do we send reimbursement requests to you for any shit they kill?
---
Its a nickname used for propaganda by nazis. If you want to edge along mass murder that’s a choice.
---
Do not speak for us, capsuleer. Your kind's days are numbered, and only we know that number.
---
I'm agreeing with galmil agreeing with a goon. 
---
I feel dirty.
---
Cheaper than a domi or ishtar would be a myrmidon which should work well.
---
you should work for fox news.
---
No, you're my old friends.
---
Yall motherfuckers actually believe the drifters will do any meaningful damage lol
---
1 word. "Content".
---
How is this fake? You don't get the same thing in the NES?
---
\*stares at DINO tag\*
---
Ol' ... it says ... and, no.
---
No this isn't WoW. The best part about all of this is that players are actively involved in creating the stories, and CCP only releases little bits of information. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEwOyBYWSAU

EVEUni does have a C2 wormhole campus... we found it a few weeks ago and kiiiiiiinda murdered some dudes in it...
---
The issue isn't that it takes time to fly shit. The issue is that this time is very unengaging.
---
It's weeks of logging in regularly just to update your skill queue.
---
There is nothing in gameplay that you can do to speed it up, so playing the game is less rewarding than just doing something more fun and waiting. At least for unlocking stuff.

Shhh ... he's just dreaming, when he wakes up, he suddenly realizes he's actually in his normal average nullsec system ...

Thank you for the the mobile grammer checkup. Please continue to tell me more about my culture.  I'd like to see how far down the douche bag well you can go.
---
... Oooo that one hurts. And feels soooo good to watch at the same time.
---
Is it really a problem?
---
Well, they pretty much started to ref Upwell and FLEX structures in major nullsec alliances spaces in the blink of an eye and with overwhelming force, so we don’t really know what happened. For now, CCP is still quiet if they fat fingered something, or if it’s lore related.
---
For now, I suppose the only structures that were destroyed were LOW POWER FLEX structures, since their reinforcement timer is held within a single day, but the other structures are saved for now, because they still have their armor timer going, and if the Drifter fleets do come back, they’d still have the hull timer.
---
But honestly, it’s a funny thing this is happening. Maybe it’s a new way to put an end to structure spamming from bigger entities.
---
Ironic. 
---
Everyone knows Goons are the elite pve alliance.

---
This was all planed at the bbq.
---
So drifters now are involved in nullsec politics ? hitting only Imperium/Legacy/Winter Co ? I don't see QFC querious systems being hit... Not salt here, but if you do it CCP, do it random all over the nullsec map.
---
I'm genuinely curious on how this plays out against botters.

Hope? Absolutely, desperately.

---
CCP does not understand its old players let alone any new ones. Ergo CCP does not understand its own game.
---
i call shenanigans
---
Nothing enganging for you but new players have plenty to do and learn. And first you say it's not about the time it takes, but then you say there's nothing to speed it up. Make up your mind.
---
Take my up vote good sir.
---
You don't have the slightest idea what is the real issue, don't you?              
---
1st of all number of titans is much smaller issue than how easily you can replace them :             
---
* rorqual swarms allow you to mine few titans daily if you are bigger alliance          
---
* sotiyos / keepstars allow easy production, storage and stockpiling of both parts and ready hulls           
---
* above all all those rorquals and how CCP promoting multiboxing of them ... are also accounts that have 2 free spots so you have always space for new titan/super/dread/fax char                 
---
What is also important here ... it is about that whatever mechanic will be implemented - those people will have all the tools, assets , isk and whats important character slots to instantly abuse them.          
---
"Rich" people will be able to instantly inject and use whatever counter mechanic it is created.               
---
Problem is with rorquals, injectors and ability to run easily multiple accounts abusing 2 previous items.
---
TIP: join a corporation, if you try to get into pvp by continuing to rat in high sec you'll get bored and quit.
---

Gotcha. Check in game though? If you don't get the same thing I'm seeing, we have some weird shit going on.

But hey, whatever fits your narrative

To be fair, CCP didn't announce anything about it, so there's a fair chance it could've simply been a fuckup on CCP's part.

For your entertainment :)
---
We are in the endgame now
---
Goons shot all NC structures, meaning they don't have to defend Tribute from the drifters, while also causing the total structure count to go down, meaning their structures are a larger portion of the structure pool, meaning they're even more likely to be hit.
---
Basically, this is some 6 dimensional backgammon from Killah
---
So basically...the purge?
---
trapped me \*\*\*lol\*\*\*
---
You say that, but the main change that Drifter invasions will do to nullsec is to make it more boring than ever, since every coalition will be now forced to focus on defending their structures from Drifters instead of fighting with other nullsec blocks. Nobody will react positively to fighting Drifters as endgame nullsec content, not just Goons. The only reasons that Goons are most salty about Drifter invasions at the moment is because they appeared at inconvenient time for them. If most Goons were still in Delve, they would be the ones to least care.
---
Fair fight in EVE? Hahahahahaha
---
Atleast they got some kills lol
---
You know an mmo is in a bad place when bots fight bots.
---
More proof Goons don't know the meaning of irony
---
They have hit astras
---
Your post literally says "adapt or die", as if death by npc is a likelihood
---
Wrong on this one, Astra was reinforced.
---
@bravegoon You “ AAR”  like old people fuck!
---
Thrasher never really left the menu, if you look at some nullsec fleet compositions.
---
And well, we don’t know shit about what’s happening, so we can’t tell if it’s Drifter Incursions 2.0, or just random lore stuff to take down the massive citadel abuse from the nullbears.
---
Same applies to remote reps.
---
I know but the whole point in using those ships is that you are trading very cheap ships that you can mass produce for dealing with the issue.
---
Awwwwww negative points.  I guess someone in NC/PL didn't like what I said and needs a cookie to feel better.
---
we still have space?
---
Aint this the truth. As opposed of the slow death we're experiencing sitting chained to our krabbing space in Esoteria.
---
Very nice, me likey lots.
---
But you haven't mentioned the bit that states.. "My Raven was equipped with the following.."
---
Im a vet. I have 10 accounts and most of them around 200 mil sp each. And 99% of the ships i fly are Assault Frigates.
---
Yeah, I know :)
---
That’s also the bread and butter of some fleets : you just throw expensive T1 stuff against large targets (Catalyst in highsec, etc) and it generally work, so why not do it again against the Drifter forces ?
---
Let the purge come, let us be scavengers in our own homes, its gonna be fun!
---
You find drifter holes by scanning down sigs in a system you see drifters right?
---
Especially with the super weapon.      
---
Like a single T2 bomber wing costs as much as 150 T1 fit trashers ...    
---
Doing 150.000 damage each shoot.
---
no they all spilled out
---
Exactly. But again, as much as the bombers are expensive, they have some advantages over Thrasher, like speed (not by a lot), covops cloak and bien able to jump through BLOPS bridges.
---
INB4 Thrasher great again
---
Honestly?
---
If the CFC would shatter, that would create massive amounts of content for awhile.
---
Somewhere in the recesses of sound cloud is a recording of a drunken capsuleer shouting "Rote Kapelle is a bunch of fuckboys". Man I wonder if I can find that again.
---
Make it dependent on the number of active users in system. Causes NPCs to 3rd parties to interfere in big fights.
---
Probably not.
---
Last update was the 13th March, and that update didn't contain an eta on the release of the book.
---
I guess I phrased it badly. It is not about the time it takes, a few weeks to fly "nice" stuff is fair. But that time itself isn't really enganging, and there is little to no player agency to engange with the game until that time passed. And since you as a player can't even do anything to speed that time up by enganging with the game it gives you even less agency.
---
Give PH drifter ships, unlimited respawns and see if that statement changes.
---
Spirit skins were.... guardians gala? Which i thought was February time? Oh well.
---
The trig ones are probably for attendees of the next leg of the world tour.
---
takes a lot of time tho
---
Don't forget that CCP is a company that has to meet financial targets. Alas the player run economy isn't high on the list of PA's things to keep.
---
I was talking about supercarrier bomber wing ;)
---
Hey. Ive never used this "buddy link" program when I started playing the game. Is there a way to link it to my acc. to get some extra SP? Or is it only for new accounts?          
---
ty for answers
---
You're a notorious corp hopper who doesn't like a challenge, and prefers to ride on other people's achievements/ticker tank.
---
Somehow you also believe you're some elite Player versus Player oriented pilot, although you couldn't fit a black operations battleship, nanofiber-enhanced cruiser, or even simple faction warfare-oriented tech 1 frigate to derp around in low security space, and score some kills on your own.
---
Should’ve been clearer then.

The Drifters are more interesting than NC.

If this had been real, they would just safe log off in Low Sec, wait for it to be over then quickly go back to what it is right now.

CCP's announced that this is an intended feature.

Goons seem to think it is. They've returned south early.

unless they've changed it, nah they just spawn on the overview in systems with jove observatories.

if you go near them, the drifters are pissed. if you go in them, they're pissed. if you come out of them, they're pissed.

i've been in one, come out the other end, warped to a different place in system where the drifters turned out to be - they shot me.

It's not that difficult to answer. The core problem is that you can't fight a capital blob without a bigger capital blob, because capitals are designed to be immune to everything that subcaps use to fight each other (ewar, booshing, bombs, counter-fits, kiting etc). 
---
If Goons (or whoever) were bringing 2000 subcaps instead an alliance could fight that with half the numbers in subcaps and stand a reasonable chance if they're smart about it. There'd at least be a fight every time because any big alliance can SRP subcaps these days.
---
It's really simple bad game design that's causing the majority of PVP problems in the game now. The death of roaming as a playstyle, lowsec problems, structure bashes getting blue balled every time, stagnant nullsec, it all is caused by capitals being badly designed.

Lol 😂😂
---
yeah this is my concern as well
---
honestly if i were in charge of goons i would have carried on in the north at least until a week or so until you had some data on how consistently the drifters follow up on timers
---
beans literally repelled the drifters attacking the bwf keep with the keep itself and a corm fleet, as long as you guys had jump clones in delve or some kind of home defense doctrine i imagine you would have been fine for a little bit at least; unless you're hard committing to prevent drifters from killing literally any structures at all
---
People are entitled to different opinions. OPs question wasn't directed only at sophomore grade fleet members or wormhole people. In my opinion, T's answer was honest. He didn't pretend to be anything else. Are his (or my) experiences current from this week? Are our experiences from a year ago invalid? Are you providing only today's experiences? 
---
Before you guys went off about a hypothetical reset, the point I agreed with there IS that awkward distrust. Spies in corps, jita chat full of scammers, contracts that are scam or bait. People suicide ganking on their free alts and stealing your loot to trade to mains in trade hubs so their mains are unpunished.  I mean... all of those ARE a thing. There's a lot of surprisingly "cheap" mechanics that have been left in the game. I think personally, it's stuff like that that drives people away more than the "arms race" for skill points. 
---
If you think about it, actually, the arms race helps new players only if they are being guided by a friend, or if they spend a LOT of time on the forums, on videos etc. The arms race really just helps alts more tbh. 
---
I've quit eve about 3 times now and debating coming back. Hence on this reddit. There are definitely great times that I have had as well. There's a whole world to explore and... lots of landmines to avoid. Like some others said, get into a cool corp, learn and hang out with them. In a way... eve has "true" endgame in an MMO because it's player generated as opposed to.... waiting for a new patch of content. Check here for corp recruitment. The F2P model is pretty fair in the sense of.... you just can't fly bigger ships and use the nicer gear. As a new dude, F2P will be great at showing you the game and deciding if you want to play or not.

---
CSM member posting false information about game plans - that's not a grey area at all :P
---
Well, they used to appear in WH in larger numbers as a result of people trying to farm holes the old way without paying attention to drifters accumulating in the system as a result.
---
Wow i was so fucking hoping this was real, my balls feel blue-er than ever right now.
---
The fact that NPCs did more damage to GSF than NC's Delve campaign at the beginning of the war speaks volumes - just sayin'
---
I speek about WH hunting, 100MN VNI are not my primary target.
---
But wormholes bruh.
---
you can have everything on your main, and do specialized alts as well - however, there's a lot of stuff you can train for, and you can spend easily 100m sp without getting into capital ships at all. from my point of view, you reach the point of "needing" specialized alts when you get to the point of "damn, i wish i could do this at the same time as that" and have the isk/rl moneys to facilitate that
---
I totally agree, goons would just tire of constantly shooting npcs in Delve.
---
I really hope this is a feature and not a bug. Hope more little happy accidents like this happen.
---
They should do away with the asymmetry entirely. Even with the amazing-looking art, the Imicus' "arm" sticks out like a sore thumb, same with the Thorax's hairdryer.
---
Loving the redesigns though. So much more sleek.
---
I'm not goon. i was at first fucking scared because of the amount of assets, and not being rich enough to own a jumpfreighter.  
---
but damn, i would be behind this idea.   
---
I have faith that our each coalition leadership would deal with it, we would spread across low / high sec during the counter attacks,and these sectors would be in fire, concord being overwhelmed by having a 4x or 5x time multiplier before landing on grid...
---
but the richest would win again ? or the one that have the most ships / guns to shoot, right?
---
They will chase you.  Completely savage.  It's like you get marked.
---
a mixture of both: the highest bonus only will be applied; however, if you have a lesser bonus also that runs longer, once the higher bonus runs out for whatever reason the lesser bonus will be applied for the remainder of its duration (or until you get a better bonus again)
---
I disagree. There's plenty to do. Explore. Career agents. Missions. Mining. Epic arcs. Is cosmos still a thing? Faction war. Spend that time see the game and making friends.
---
So for those with aspiration is now to what? What is a goal to get in EVE? All new players starting shouldn't aim to fly the larger ships in game? Well done if that is the case. On other hand while this all appears to target the like of imperium like entities, where space is already dangerous enough and already evidenced by player gravitating toward larger blocks as it is. 
---
Not sure this is the best thought out strategy although, lets see.
---
Can smaller entities deal with this sort of incursion? As this stage larger entities are going to throw millions of cheap shit boats to remove drifters, what will the small guys do? Why would anyone ever anchor their own structure anymore? Will this destroy entities actually going to fight anyone else as they all have to remain home to defend their shit? Might be a content killer yet.
---
If we are talking about blobs can we remove the multi-boxing dread fleet please CCP, it is unfair play on my sole lonely rorqual mining as a small player in game. If you cannot do this I will need to move in with goons for protection! This is where the argument will go and should go next. Its unfair for the game if Olmeca can blob with his own dread bomb, CCP please fix.
---
As a human being with a sense of humor, that post is not only well done, but not inappropriate. I'm basically the fount from which the kool-aid is poured for the GSF and proudly up vote this shit. 
---
Well done. This kind of ability to joke as one of us instead of worrying about appearances says to me you either have the confidence needed to do the job, or are so far removed from self awareness as to not be an issue. I do truly hope it's the former though.
---
In either case, I applaud you. Thank you for this.
---
Drifters was the best enemy too given their firepower.  
---
This is absolute genius.
---
This will certainly shake things up a bit because it needed it.  Just as we thought big alliances owned eve out pops the drifters so say.. no...we do..
---
Hopefully it's not a one off

Nothing beats Dominion. Yeah it's not the most accurate, but its fucking awesome.

Goons +pets move North to structure bash. CCP releases the kraken of all rats to structure bash. Delve gets hit hard. Goons begin pulling back south in what can only be called the largest ratting fleet in Eve history.

 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77497695/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77497695/)  **not implying hes a botter**, but i expect to see many more like this in the future
---
depending on the area of space you're in, i'd take a different ship. but otherwise there's no reason not to.
---
i'd recommend you put one of your characters in a squad command position though, so you can squad-warp yourself to safety from there. you might also want to look into industrial command ships - a porpoise and a covetor (or hulk) mine more than 2 skiffs, and you can keep the cov mining while the porpoise empties its cargohold (and the boosts still keep on running, depending on how far out the drop-off is you don't miss a second of boost; also of note might be that the boosting state only comes into effect at the beginning and the end of the cycle, so if you miss a few seconds in the middle it doesn't matter; and at the end of the cycle, only the range is relevant)
---
it is possible to run an orca and 5+ covs on a single computer, alt-tabbing through them. it can make mining more interesting, as you've got a bit of stuff to do ;)
---
Sorry guyz. didnt know this is not allowed
---
That site is for a corp. In my completely unbiased opinion, the best one that a new player can join. Laura Karpinski, our CEO, most definitely does not have a revolver pointed at me right now as I type this.
---
More seriously. It's a great place to learn the ropes. We're at war a lot, but that's not usually much of a problem (especially since any other corp that you might join is probably at war with P I R A T too). Just avoid being in space near trade hubs. Ship it over with the hauling service when you have enough merchandise for the hauling service to be worthwhile. Contract it to an alt in Jita. Sell on the alt. Two contracts are a lot cheaper than losing a ship and what you were trying to sell. Most importantly, it also means that P I R A T doesn't get the loot. They usually don't show up near Amygnon these days because that's where they might find themselves in an actual fight. And they don't win those. So your main worry most of the time is the resident CODE pilot in Jufvitte and comms usually points out war targets a few systems out. And in LowSec, NullSec, and Wormhole Campus, the people tend to be competent enough and willing enough to engage in PVP that you're not going to be in significant danger over there either as long as you're in comms,in standing fleet, and paying attention. Unless you're stupid like my first trip out to NSC, when I quickly received an opportunity to visit my medical clone and buy a replacement ship because I didn't dock up as quickly as I should have.
---
Yes!
---
Holy fuck...that's it then. They do hit structures in low timers, and we know they can put them there themselves too given enough time. 
---
The Great Bashing begins.
---
realistically no but people love to reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

there is a consensus about it : the Loki is the best T3c, I don't deny it.

despite that, I think that the Proteus is still a great ship (not as good as he was), and fun to fly

If Triangles are hitting high sec and driftwood is hitting null, will Sansa Stark hit low sex?
---
Do it

Agreed, the proteus can have some pretty good niche uses.

Maybe they will form twice for each structure so all the low power spam dies

The trigs were a distractions lmao the actual invasion was the -clears throat-
---
*Emergent Threats*
---
yeah this
---
 **CCP:** The Tranquility Server is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one drifter extinction level event to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.
---
**Players:** There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.
---
Do the drifters just spawn?
---
Eh. Just because a few autists can camp for a month, doesn't mean the defenses will hold. From what I've seen these fleets are nothing to scoff at. So you are basically dealing with around the clock, simultaneous harrassment of your structures all over your space, equivalent to something that would also be used by players.  There'd need to be a second, rather formidable standing fleet just to keep the constant attacks in check.
---
If you are refining in hisec the % is only 50%, while in null it can go up to around 90%
---
Precise!
---
Count down to the fresh alpha bots running these for the free sp which then simply omega once to extract and sell for profit?

As much as I'm interested in this potential conflict, playing calvinball is not fun. And it goes without saying that it's not fun and utterly pointless to play against GM (I don't mean specific position in CCP, but people who run the game in general).
---
Finally, something to fight. Maybe the dirfters can teach you how to undock aswell?
---
But will they come back to finish it off though
---
No, CCP Hjalmar plays a strategy game and gathers ressources to build the Drifter ships before sending them to torch everything in Sov. 
---
You know, like 'Sins of a Solar Empire'... but with drifters.
---
No. If you can't defend your space/assets then you loose them.
---
That's the nature of the beast and always will be. Just as NCPL.
---
It is both good and sad.
---
CCP fixing their broken mechanics with the help of artificial NPC
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant
---
They are going to camp the systems first, to get the ADMs down
---
Disappointing lack of dUdE :/
---
2 drone damage amps, and one mag field stab. Other 2 slots are a damage control and a nano.
---
I WANT THIS. TAKE MY UPVOTE, I'LL CREATE OTHER ACCOUNTS TO UPVOTE THIS.
---
The question is, do they ever dock?
---
But is it.... is it really..
---
CCP has been pretty clear about not wanting to have EVE in Sins of a Solar Empire
---
Stunning!
---
double web, scram, arty on overheat
---
There was never any Delve campaign for NC. We went there like what, three times through wormholes routes ?
---
Remove asset safety from null. Then drop this. If you cant deffend your space. You should not own it.
---
Check your local system for wh signature. 4LNE-M had J151838 (C6 Deadly space) - maybe new invasion event? They also warp inside DED 10/10 Drones expedition [https://pasteboard.co/IlfMTkS.png](https://pasteboard.co/IlfMTkS.png) (proof)
---
Please do

In the END , CCPlz will Fxxked by  Financial report !!!

I've found if you don't have the time or resources and you need shit in the hole ASAP, you can bring some bashing fit praxis-es with a higgs rig that work just fine for rolling. I tend to bash with them and until i need to use them keep the higgs in the cargo.
---
Not really. The "war" was a hard fought standstill. Turns out, that's also the way to burn out your line members and FC's the fastest, since you aren't making any progress, but you still have to give it your A-Game every time.
---
But everything changed, when the goon supercap fleet attacked. Because in addition to being considerably larger than the northern one by this point, it's losses also didn't really matter. Out of those three titan engagements, which cost more than two days worth of Delve tics? Maybe the X47 armor timer? But not by a lot. Also, titan engagements, and especially big ones, aren't fun for anyone involved. Maybe they are "interesting" on the stats counter after the fact, but many players only really out themselves through such TiDi hellscapes out of dedication for their alliance. 
---
Real fun and interesting gameplay is the border skirmishes, the sub cap slug fests, the roaming fleets and the equal power between the entities doing these things. In that case, our (Hordes) war against GotG was fun and interesting. Sure not much was achieved, but it had a narrative, and it had a lot of pretty fun subcap fights. Now take the current (and most likely first on a list of wars like it) war. It's not even remotely a border war, as the main attacker lives on the other side of space. There aren't any real fights. Most of those get deep dicked the prospect of having a few hundred goon caps dropped on us. I also haven't seen an uptick in goon roaming fleets into our space (although I might be wrong about that). And the powerlevel sure as fuck isn't equal.
---
TL:DR: While interesting things do still occasionally happen, they have fallen completely out of style in the meta.
---
So we need to close all wh’s in our sov to protect ourselves ?
---
They don’t gate in, they don’t cyno in ...
---
 unbelievable , unreal...
---
They just killed some jump gates fam, there's your follow up.
---
Nah you are right. But the wars didn't tip the scales. The krabbers in Delve did. The only reason PanFam was regarded as similarly powerful, is that nobody except for a few goons knew the true extent of your supercap fleet.
---
As far as I know it's confirmed as a feature
---
I get your point. Though I think the PvE/arcs are lackluster... Mining is something that greatly profits from more skills. And for FW, yeah I guess you can farm LP but that is mind numbingly boring. As newbro without skills there is little to gain from PvP, because you aren't just limited by your mechanical skills, but also by being significantly slower and weaker than your matchups.
---
I get it, especially as newbro you can't expect to do well in PvP immediatley, but the odds are _really_ stacked against you.
---
It can be solved by introducing Drifter Dread, suca and Titans. Image the Drifter titans that has 1 shot damage equals to a DD and will cost you 10 DD to kill one and when it dead it will shot 1 last will DD that will kill the highest EHP super capital ships instantly + release a tons of Drifter BS
---
what?
---
Someone has to do danger when players are so fucking risk-averse and safe.
---
As a horde member I just want to say that being outplayed by NPCs is business as usual. Carry on.
---
So now you have to mark your shitposts? :sadpepe:
---
I would actually totally support this
---
You sound like a politician trying to deny something everyone knows is true.  
---
"I did not have sexual relationships with that woman!"

You missed out KenZoku

This is absolutely awesome
---
Do not think about "The Event!"
---
Remain indoors.
---
This is the best thing I've seen all year.
---
Drifters reffing moon mining citadels in the middle of nowhere will be pretty annoying tho.
---
When you're sixteen years into nullsex and chill and she gives you that look...
---
Oddly this is all what I sorta wanted from the World arc invasion/trig stuff. That they would do this, and they WOULD be able to reinforce hard enough that "shiney toys" would get blapped. But yeah, CCP adding escalation mechanics and other features would be amazing for this.
---
But have you actually logged in the post 12 months to find out?
---
bbtb living in your head rent free
---
One has to wonder if CCP put some rating system for the activity of those. For example the more citadels in region or system there are and bigger the more events like these? I think that will be interesting. Or having low power structures also scores more points... That will be interesting way to prioritize targets.
---
I agree, CCP should adjust to make small ships becomes bigger problems for supercapitals. For example makes smaller ships harder to lock and capital weaponds cannot attack ships from battlecruisers sizes and below and allow frigates to deal damage to hull directly if they can approach close enough (about 10% area larger than capital snartbombs I suggest) - like how to destroy Death Star on SW4
---
Besides a little Abyss running I haven't actively engaged in active PVE in ages, but I would say Rattlesnake or Mach.
---
from what i've seen, the fleets they send are proportional to the size of the structure, and a moderately well fit structure with a moderately competent gunner can take care of them
---
if they werent going to make any isk they would tire super fast
---
Best kind of hug &lt;3
---
Not gonna lie had us in the first half
---
PL is going to love his 1t loss board.
---
you need to stop posting drunk
---
Not losing any argument at all.  People.are complaining literally about nothing that isnt already there.
---
There is very little difference to just buying skill injectors.  Let's say they still only got 250kk SP as a beginner.. perhaps at a cheaper price.
---
So they can instantly log In buy a plex with cash and inject those skill points instantly that day.  It's no different. At all..  Storm in a bloody teacup it is..
---
So what if people didnt extract those skills, it makes absolutely no difference in the game especially when it's a tiny 750kk SP.
---
maybe if legacy didn't have huge victim complexes and looked at the numbers, they can fight PANFAM on their own.
---
Hilmar had enough of the criticism.
---
stop calling it "the same thing" when it very clearly isn't
---
this meme again?
---
depends if you make good isk defending your space from npcs, if you do vni ticks while risking supers and titans multibox, then they would rather just rat
---
i thought this was a clip, wut?
---
the difference is power creep have never been this bad.
---
and about alliances who can shoot only sctructures instead of ppl.
---
??? wtf are you on? there is a big difference between 1m SP for 5$ or 250k free SP for everyone...
---
jeez the braindrain is real
---
We love it. Feature time
---
Insmother is safe!
---
strawman? this is about SP injection, not plex and game time
---
best feature ever
---
false equivalence
---
What CCP has done is great and I see a lot of comments happy that npc attack player it's great and needed don't get me wrong but CCP must also rework/add mechanics to push player to move by using those attacking npc:
---
- limited mining ressources, you deplete a region it will take few weeks to come interesting again, the quicker you deplete the region the longer it takes to be exploitable again
---
-Spawn/respawn anomalies the more you kill npc in a region, higher is the chance of getting dropped by subcap/dread fleet that have no bounty and don't drop faction mods
---
- fees linked to the number of people in an alliance to favor small and medium alliances, old big alliance could  divide themself in smaller ones but at least sov will be a little bit harder to defend
---
we did move op fleets for a one-mid keepstar-keepstar-keepstar supercap move
---
you don't *have* to, strictly speaking, but you also don't have to not, and if you can, why wouldn't you
---
you mean just like injectors already are?
---
who will lose a keep first? stay tuned!
---
in the form of a petition response
---
you sure about that?
---
that would be awesome. maybe they should scale up with attacking citadels that have almost no activity
---
i think they are going for the kill https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/
---
Or at all
---
happy cake day
---
Shut up.
---
guys    quickly go check the  sansha wormholes  these three something dark is coming
---
It's almost like we spelled out that we'd be executing a Fabian strategy and have done exactly that since the GOTG backstab, and all what we've predicted is coming to pass.
---
this sounds more like a problem with skill requirements then with actual SP amount. but you can't make money off of loosening requirements
---
This new corp has some insane good pilots: [https://zkillboard.com/character/3019603/](https://zkillboard.com/character/3019603/)
---
I think atm they are targeting only the Bigblobs. At least for Provi I can say that we weren't hit yet. 
---
Maybe the larger the alliance or player density the more attacks? Something like that would be interesting
---
They don't want us to have it, big difference.
---
&gt; Skill injectors take away the sweat and tears many need to really love this game. Buying years and injecting them is what really shallowed out this game.
---
this. newbies will never know the pride of actually training into their dream ship. now it's just "grind isk with mind numbing repetitive tasks until i can finally buy myself into that hull", no wonder they quit so fast. while you grinded for your SP i spend my training time learning to pilot and actually playing the game.
---
Bobby B what are do you suggest we do after you've taken Delve ?
---
preach it brother
---
maybe..i don't know..play the game? that's what we vets did back before injectors you know. PLAYING THE GAME, undocking and shit
---
Spin it the other way!
---
Goons outsource invasion of Tribute to drifters, NC. still don't undock.
---
Looking at footage from the Horde Keepstar structure guided bombs also work
---
he just wants easy injectable pilots. this has nothing to do with new players
---
but cant find it anywhere anymore now.  its deleted?
---
just loosen the skill requirement? same effect without fucking over balance and exploitable loopholes. aaah yes i know why, because you can't make money off of that
---
Pretty sure she has the larger dick.
---
&gt; I don't agree that titans should be the only way to fight back.
---
the alternative (which was proven during drifter incursions) is to swarm them with cheap ships. horde uses cormorants. if a cormorant eats a drifter dd, who cares? it was a cormorant, go grab a new one and come back
---
well said
---
started in 09, still have a char from that year that has 50k SP
---
Upvoted!
---
Head*
---
Then you aren't really anti-citadel. This is the freaking best way to deal with them, skip some of the boring shit players aren't very interested in.
---
CCP got so tired of not knowing how to balance the game they made an event to wipe it for them. Talk about lazy.
---
That old Brave logo tho, damn
---
The warp out, warp in is something players can't do though. We're not allowed to warp our ships arbitrarily without setting up bookmarks first.
---
 Sorry guyz. didnt know this is not allowed
---
[https://ibb.co/1zDtzk4](https://ibb.co/1zDtzk4)

Is this what passes for roleplay these days?

No idea, but I'd love to see a screenshot of the pilots face when he realised what was happening.

Amen ! The sky is ours :o
---
Someone decided moving things with a Rorq would be safe. It wasn't. You get your shitty post downvoted to oblivion.
---
Interesting how they announced it right between CSM cycles. It's almost like they knew players wouldn't like it...
---
You know  that sick feeling you get in your stomach..  that..
---
Wait till drifters delete your fap folder!
---
It’s going to turn out that this is where the EVE tv-series is going to start.
---
Sounds perfectly fine to me.
---
U69-YC, Detorid
---
Lol no, the alliances wouldn't matter if its based on infrastructure density.
---
If only your post was real!
---
this is just fucking gold! amazing job CCP
---
Some material can be smoothed with acetone damps.
---
Grounder and paint also helps. You can also sand them. But I think it's hard with small models like this.
---
But I don't think layer lines are the worst issues. It's just that the ships are not designed to be 3D printed and that can be iffy. Som you can split in two and glue together. But that often results in a lines that is way more visible then the layer lines from the print itself.
---
I had a 150 EUR printer for a while, but I would not recommend it. 300 EUR/USD would be a better investment. 700 EUR and you get something with good support that prints smooth like butter.
---
The simplest and easiest way to have the drifters choose targets is just on the ratio of structures to moons.
---
Yes. It is co-inhabitated by Triglavians.
---
CCP... by far the most amazing thing you have ever done in recent memory!!!
---
well done
---
Any Stellaris players here?
---
I'm getting the same vibes i get from the Unbidden, Aberrant and Vehement crisis.
---
Stupid wh nub question. Let's say that Hecate does get killed by a hunter. How do you find your way back?
---
I am just amazed how people can plex all those accounts mining in hisec, it just sounds like torture to me
---
is there a different definition to haiku i dont know about?
---
that's the point
---
All hail our drone overlords...?
---
eehh, 10 to 20 M SP? Are you foken sure? 
---
Damn, I can make some good alts with that, and save hundreds of bucks on injectors.
---
Repair services are now available in hisec if you need them... ;)
---
I think you are a bit premature on the null sec going to burn statement there buckaroo
---
EVE 2.0 get announced by PA soon with aether war engine. Will be ready in 10 years (same time as pre alpha star citizen).

Why? They don't have any structures left

It's to replace all 0.0 structure.

Sure we should punish people for actually playing the game and mining moons what could possibly go wrong?

Hi, is there a possibility to tell if an industry-station has the ability to react gases to polimers or do i have to visit stations with industry until i find a reactor in it ?

Thanks for the help and a safe flight! o7

what did the update say? 
---
it would be nice to hear something about how many orders/how long they're waiting for before printing or w/e. i totally respect it's a small project, and i'm happy to wait for them to do their thing, i'd just like to know how it's progressing

Wow, space is actually might be dangerous again. Is it time for resub?
---
Interesting, good to know. Thank you.
---
Is that from the new season of Archer? Did the show get its sense of humor back? I stopped watching after that terrible noir season *shudder*, but the early seasons were the greatest.
---
so...no problem?
---
Imagine actually working like a group when you are group?
---
Maybe ccp fucked up the chat system, again.
---
Sandbox? What is it?
---
No. No mechanics. No controls. No "safe levels". Just make it random or as random it can be. If players figure out a pattern, throw some salt into the randomization formula. If they come, you need to fight. If they don't, exploit your lands another day. "Imminent doom" should not be avoidable by simply staying below a virtual threshold.
---
C'mon CCP, just give Drifters their own Dread and let's be done with it.
---
I have to see if my friend is serious about starting up (he'd be a new bro) and if so, what kind of corp we should try to get into. Alternatively, if he's not.... then I'd first have to find a corp that works for me.... and where I'd fit in. So... in the air atm a lil bit.
---
It defenietly is!
---
Looking at that station, it seems to be one where a lot of stuff is dying. My guess is that the pilot screwed up the cyno and the Rorqual ended up either bumping or too far off to dock. Looking at who is killing all the ships , I also think Ivana has an active cyno character set up there.
---
So what you are saying is that sandbox is too much for you and you need more rules and specially made restrictions to play? Am I getting it right?
---
nice
---
Yes why? No change atm
---
I've sincerely been hoping this is exactly what you are mentioning, even down to the concept of a "number" of structures that triggers this in the system.
---
Some sort of nature's plague control.
---
Let me know when they kill their first Keepstar. Until that happens this means fuck all.
---
Wait a sec ... that looks like where I live ...
---
it might be in REB-KR immensea, I remember that a faction fortizar was there
---
Why is it every time CCP does something y’all gotta come in and throw these stupid ideas out there without any foundation. We don’t know what the algorithm behind the drifters is, we don’t know what or how or why they attack, and honestly we don’t need to, it’s now a game mechanic and we gotta deal with it
---
Wow, Hammerheads are tiny.
---
One thing all wormholers should have is an alpha account with a scanning heron sat in the hole.
---
The account does nothing else just sits logged off doing nothing.
---
Then that moment all your chars happen to get rolled out you can struggle to remember the alts password and then scan the static down again.
---
Contract the bookmark over and get back in.
---
The point is that realistically it's not a pure sandbox and does require balance and other mechanics interference that impacts and changes meta. We as players will just minmax everything taking the changes into account.
---
Thanks bud! This community puts out so much helpful info, I’ve barely had any play hours yet but enjoying reading about everything just as much.
---
Tinfoiling here but if the Tryffyds are hitting high and Drifters are hitting null, maybe Sansha will hit low? Particularly the Amarrian space would make sense lore-wise.
---
What would be interesting is if the Tribbles were in a High Sec system boarding null and the drifters were bashing in that null system. Throw in a Sansha Incursion in a neighbouring low system...
---
So much for all those goon promises about protecting their renters ...
---
Any source?
---
Align + 4.5 au/s are nice when you quickly need an heavy tackler
---
We nuked that other fleet attacking BWF so they went somewhere else and got revenge, we're screwed tbh
---
Shit's getting real!
---
just too much regulation for a free life in space.  
---
Let them spam citadels until their Rorqs start bouncing from citadel to citadel when they undock... ;)
---
fucking russians again
---
Underrated post
---
They are red with white snow in the back.  Damavik, rodiva, drek.  Source I paid the iron price for them with my liver.
---
Unironically, that idea of sov refresh made by drifters, plus drifter drop on everyone, is very nice and interesting
---
WORKS FOR ME BECAUSE SOV WAS A MISTAKE
---
Rogue drones in ls?
---
I think you are missinterpreting what CCP is doing here out of bittervetness. Well, at least I hope so.
---
Bot confirmed
---
\&gt; CCP introduces new and entirely unexplained mechanics without warning which force players to adapt to rapidly changing situations.
---
\&gt; Immediate "EvE iZ tOtAlLy DeAd GuYz!!!!!111!!!!" spergpost.
---
That's r/eve, folks!
---
Don't worry. They haven't bought a permit yet so they won't be able to.
---
However, if you have 10m ISK and would like to buy a permit, Mr Drifter, sir...
---
CCP just like every other company is in it to make money. Cash grabs should not surprise anyone. Hell maybe the money they make they will invest back into the game? 🤯
---
Allow me to be 'that guy' for a moment...
---
Drifters don't have vocal chords.
---
It’s going to be:
---
-Provibloc in Provi
---
-Drifters everywhere else

People said CODE. getting null sov would bring about the end of days...

 It might excite PvE players, but not all players are like you. As you grow up and become an adult, You need to accept that not all people are the same....

So your average null comp these days?

Making irl threats over a joke is a pretty big yikes ngl

What's that you are trying to say in that meaningless, fanboy sentence?
---
It would have lived if it were a shield super
---
It's only for new accounts, I've tried petitioning CCP in the past, but they won't give the SP if you missed it.
---
It's not like this has not happened before when drifters were introduced
---
When drifter do more damage to player than player themself...
---
Not fighting back literally forces CCP to step in

Like the anual AT tournament?   Oh..... wait CCP  canceled that.

Drifters don't show up in local, so the bot couldn't react.
---
Had me to the end. Reporting you regardless
---
I have a hard time believing you know the slightest thing about adulthood, kiddo.
---
P much.
---
So they decided to have Sins of Solar Empire in EVE instead.
---
You can only do reactions in low sec, null, and wormhole space.
---
Isn't that just r/eve in general?
---
Oh this is awesome, let me check VNI losses.
---
Already goons are crying about this new mechanic, makes me think it's a great new mechanic.
---
What I'm saying is that I think/hope (really hope) this is CCP using the tools at their disposal to introduce some sort of soft cap to structure spam and maybe, just maybe, finally reshape New Eden and some of the PVE content in each area of the game.
---
NPCs have always been there, but way too dumb and predictable for anyone to give a fuck about it, if they now have a better AI and start messing with the players that's perfectly fine by me.
---
This should also go together with some mechanics changes to several things we've all been asking since forever of course, but I see nothing wrong with CCP taking extreme measures in an organic way to tackle an issue or introduce a much needed change in an otherwise stagnating universe.
---
And I'm no fanboy you mongoloid, I live in LS and one of my favourite activities the past few years has been playing on the AT, believe me when I say that I'm pissed at CCP's bullshit more often than most.
---
But hey, feel free to keep complaining both about them doing something and not doing anything to change things, you totally not sound like a moron.
---
Yes.
---
**Yes.**

TBF, we've spent a long time killing drifters with citadels, we're fine.
---
There are some things in eve that you simply can't do with only 1 character. You can't safely do a Jump Freighter alt without a few cyno alts. You can't really own a super or a Titan without cyno alts (not safely anyways). You can't clear C6 wormhole sites on your own (need 2-4 characters). Any of the high end pve stuff requires multiple characters. And for PvP, no matter the skill level, 2 ships are better than 1.
---
A lot of things you could do by relying on others (clearing C6s could be done in a group), but if you log in and nobody wants to rat, you're not ratting tonight.
---
For wormhole corps, the usual requirements are 1 scanner alt (less than 1 month of training), but most people end up with more because it's easier to pve and pvp.
---
Do these things insta-point or scram? Do you have a chance to warp away when they show up?
---
Yup, i do know that. But how can i tell that a station, lets say in 0.0 sec, is able to provide the reacting - service? Is it possible to get this information from the structure-browser? Or can i get the information elsewhere?
---
Not wrong, but hey, some times we do so rightfully.
---
You have to sacrifice some part of your fitting, and with others they're more able to have higher dps, survivability, utility, etc
---
How replacing player roles and wars by NPC is good for PvP content, chucklefuck?
---
I'd bet that was a bot that couldn't react to a threat not in local.
---
Maybe sort will now backstab goons and get down on his knees to suck some drifter dick instead to try and convince them to halt their attacks. NPC's won't care about autz tank or faction fortizars so how will they survive?. Also these NPC's are probably more skilled than any of the pilots in dead co have to offer.
---
r/Eve
---
Lmao. Not even drifters want Provi.
---
Let's hope they learnt from their recent skirmish with skillu and manage to kill more than just a couple of sabres.
---
&gt;all of wormhole space
---
You dont know the pure pleasure that is solo hacking a ghost site and getting a blueprint worth a couple bil
---
yes, he is
---
He's in a super that would need like 20-25 points of warp disruption. I'm more wondering for my own ships if I take out a blingy marauder or haw dread. Is it an instant lose ship button if they show up on grid?
---
It's not replacing player roles, it's (hopefully) throwing an NPC threat into the mix under some specific (yet unknown ofc) conditions.
---
Oh look! The NPCs have developed a semi competent AI! Everyone panic! Skynet is here to ruin my game of hardcore permanent PVP! The rats are revolting and I'm afraid the AI is gonna be better than my brain... wait, I was being sarcastic, but that might be true in your case.
---
I fed about 18bil on the market a while back due to fat fingers and buy orders.

I learned my lesson and no longer keep more than a couple of billion on my market alt

Hehehe chucklefuck. I'm taking that.
---
Tenerifis is safe!
---
What I mean is that it probably wasn't even pointed.
---
They can and will gate
---
Maybe I am wrong, but my guess is that structure was either anchoring or already in structure timer. It looks like they created a couple timers in the last hours, we will have to see if they follow up on them.
---
Goons will need to drop their Titans to repel the invasion as they won't be able to win with subcaps and I wonder how these drifters will be able to deal with bombers and boosh Ravens init may also need adapt and finally come up with a 3rd doctrine.

Haha, case in point. Don’t be a pussy 😚

Not a drifter kill, next thread plz
---
This is the shake up eve needed make these drifters as aggressive and frequent as fuck please and grind those goon krabs and structures.
---
&gt;in a system you see drifters in right?
---
Any higher class wormhole can have drifters in em
---
If you hear a noise in your house. Do not investigate.
---
inb4 it's some sort of bug and CCP fixes it in a few weeks... or just re qualifies it as a bug after enough strings from the affected whales are pulled and they "bend the knee" yet again...
---
&gt;If they see everybody hates it, it's a feature. If everybody loves it, it's a bug.

FTFY

I for one welcome our new Drifter overlords.

Hey Ovyx, good to see you're still around! Hope all is going well man.

Where has this level of shitposting been your entire time on r/eve? If I had gold to give, you'd have it.

Been living in wormholes for years btw.

i wonder at what point he will reveal he is Gevlon
---
The NPCs made Goons pause their (dull) grind campaign in the North. This is meddling with the meta and the advertised player-driven whatever, blah-blah. Yet another promise broken by CCP.
---
That's ok, downvote away so that CCP think this was a good idea and in August when a total of 15k chars are logged, everybody will be (not) surprised. Then in Fall you will realize I was right.
---
YO MOFO!
---
&gt;. I just received the clearance from CCP to reveal the masterplan on which we have been working behind closed doors.
---
AS a fucking CSM you do NOT troll about such things.
---
FUCK YOU.
---
yes and he has just as much fun as the guy with just one account and 5m SP
---
Now this is shitposting

If enough peoe and bots rant about that gate of yours, if might become reality. Just throw enough RM in it and it is sealed deal.
---

---
Not a single day.  Test myself actually and contrary to the shitty meme there’s no lack for content or boredom on my end
---
the DD is 750k damage and they will pretty much instantly blap non supers, from memory at least.
---
For the CSM year just started.
---
Yes, because CCP has a long running history of investing the profits of EVE into EVE, rather than games they don’t release.
---
I kinda like that zkill detects possible killboard padding
---
That's totally up to them, and they claimed they were considering stopping anyway. Afaik noone else stopped doing whatever it is they were doing, we are all just waiting to see what the fuck is going on.
---
You are telling me the Imperium needs their entire SuperFleet in Delve to fight some NPCs that a group of lore nerds tackled ages ago? Really? Are you THAT stupid?
---
Made up your mind, EVE will die because CCP wants to change things or because nothing changes and it stagnates?
---
You a just a whinning little bitch. Adapt or die fucker.
---
Thanks for the info man
---
I think this was sent when people still thought this shit was a rogue AI that needed fixed.   I’d be annoyed too if that were the case.  All that I’ve seen welcome our new drifter overlords
---
Neither actually.  And this is a worn out line you should feel bad for continuing to be completely unoriginal
---
Specifically every single one of Stainguy's "suggestion" threads made over the past 3, 4 years.
---
All of them.
---
One of the things that first attracted me to eve as a kid was the ship design. I loved their unusual asymmetrical designs that touched on the sleek look of other games but were so distinct. You could tell from the profile of the ship which empire they belonged to. 
---
These new designs look cool but they seem a bit generic with only subtle nods to the old designs. Caldari ships have suffered the most imo. They used to be ugly, utilitarian looking things in stark contrast to the sleek and bulbous gallente. Now they look pretty but generic.
---
&gt; And they're not just hitting any null region, but Delve itself, home of PanFam's aggressors.
---
They are hitting all of null.
---
The entire pulling back is also most likely just Mittens overreacting and being upset due to it being something new he doesn't know yet.
---
Question 1 on today’s quiz is about THEM...
---
? 
---
They're hitting almost every region.
---
This is awesome but I think Drifters should show up in local because otherwise nobody is going to undock anymore if they could lose their ship and people will quit the game.
---
 **CCP acting to save EVE?**
---
I got you bro.
---
This idea just now come to u fam
---
&gt; but how EVE is turning into a generic pve mmo
---
We don't know where we will end up. However, I find it hard to argue against the opinion that persistent universe will one day cease to provide a fun content unless it becomes a bit less persistent or becomes something else.
---
That said, I don't quite believe in radical changes yet, but if they hit and they will be severe it won't mean the game won't be fun.
---
&gt;orgive, the only things I’ve built so far are my Asteros and Ventures so I didn’t have to fly them into jspace.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Why would compressed ore ever be bought or sold? My understanding was ore gets reprocessed as close to where it was mined as possible, and the much more valuable, compact minerals can be brought to trade or where they will be used.
---
No. Ore when its mined takes a lot of m3. Which makes it difficult to transport. Minerals (the final product after refining) take even more m3. So if you want to build capital ships, some of which you cant build in high sec, you have to get minerals to the construction/assembly location. Moving minerals is basically out of the question (bar some cases), moving uncompressed ore as well. So the only way to get minerals to capital ovens is to get compressed ore. A dread/fax needs something like 100 million tritanium alone (+other minerals). Moving that is basically impossible. This is why some ores, especially now when supply is tight, in their compressed form, can be more expensive than minerals in jita. Because people dont have other options, they need that compressed spod, and will pay for it, in many cases, as much as they have to (and that difference will reflect in end result price).
---
&gt; Nullsec is supposed to be lawless and dangerous space.
---
Meanwhile, wormholes are supposed be hard to impossible to inhabit. Make citadels/ECs/refineries unable to anchor in wormholes and purge all existing ones.
---
This is incorrect.
---
This is and always has been a stupid idea - you remove that safety net then everyone will it store valuable stuff in NPC stations.
---
Cause she has sooooo much to do with this.  Come on man I expect better of you
---
Hmm, OK. I may have misread something then. I was under the impression this was mostly focused on Delve and Esoteria at this point.
---
I would like to point out that it's a bit too early to tell anyone anything. We don't even know where CCP intend to take this entire thing.
---
More likely a convenient reason to end the war, structure grinding is so fun.
---
Well, its simple math
---
Inb4 diamond drifters
---
CCP are trying to cover the cracks, so that retards like you keep taking the bait, and milk as much as possible at this point. They had 2 years to unfuck shitadels and Fozziesov, but did nothing. What has changed, jerkweasel?
---
Everybody with half a brain will see what is going on.
---
I was referring to them ordering a cease and desist on the EVE mod for Sins of a Solar Empire
---
This is disguisting. They dock up, logoff, activate hacks and drifters appear. Literally.
---
Drek is still better at every thing the prot does (with the exception of long range hard tackle) while being cheaper and not having an sp loss. The prot still has some very significant downsides, such as guns that require cap to fire. The Loki manages to do mostly the same thing (prot gets only like 150 more DPS than a Loki) while being able to DPS with no cap, having good range for an armor brawl and selectable damage types.
---
The biggest issue with the proteus is the fact that bhaalgorns exist. It isn't possible to bring a fleet comp where prots are the primary source of DPS that doesn't immediately die to a similar sized fleet that has a bhaal for every 8 prots.
---
The prot would be fine if Loki's were toned down and dreks didn't exist. But the t3c rebalance massively overbuffed Loki's and dreks do exist. As a result the proteus just doesn't have a reason to exist in a heavy armor brawl fleet except to provide heavy tackle. Something a hic can do just as well. MCAV does use them, but it's a meme not a well thought out fleet comp
---
Goons new about it. They knew when it will happen and finished the northern structure bash just in time to not getting their titan fleet obliterated by npcs.
---
Has eso been hit yet?  Damn I’m missing it!!??
---
Going home was pretty much around the corner before the drifter invasion
---
How would that even matter? A bunch of i-hubs vanish. Doesn't change the amount of ships, structures and isk available to people. They would simply take it back and settle into old habits/areas.
---
Purge them immediately with no safety.  Just delete them
---
Man you are pissed... you need to get laid or something kiddo.

It makes having citadels in nullsec nearly pointless and your added risk vanishes as it's all perfectly safe in an NPC station.  In fact it would make null safer.

The fact is there is risk now - you blow up my citadel I have to pay to get my stuff back. You just don't get a visit by the loot fairy.

---
goons seem to be calm and relaaaaxed, must be pure fake news for sure\^\^
---
Game mechanics are whatever CCP decides they are, and in those game mechanics, drifter guns don't stop at damage cap
---
It removes the *incentive* of killing structures for the loots. Nobody is going to be keeping anything worth anything in low-powered citadels littered around null-sec. They'll choose a keepstar or NPC station to base out of, and keep their shit there.
---
The only chance of getting anything good would be to hit Keepstars, and even if you have the firepower to do that people would simply use the week+ final timer to move anything valuable out. And probably trash the rest. (At least I would trash it, just to keep it from dropping.)
---
or... cant crap for 1 day, thx ccp - lets complain about ccp destroying the game by killing all the structures we build to destroy the game!
---
i cant wait for you to be in the same position.
---
How many npc stations are there though?
---
I just am a bit skeptical that CCP wants to design a system that will apocalypse all structures in New Eden, even if people/groups play back at the NPC.  It would not be fun in the long term and it would actually be a pretty awful precedent.  
---
My gut is that this will be an ‘event’ that we all will have to play against till it’s over.  The impact it will have on structure owning alliances will depend on the mechanics.  
---
My guess will be though, if it has a negative impact on Goons, it will have a disproportionately larger impact on less organized and smaller groups.
---
not like they made 3 books with 2 being actually good
---
They don't talk... they fuck sheeeet up...
---
I would expect most r/eve posters to understand second degree but you've also failed that
---
So far we have yet to see a player empire "break"
---
We also have no clear indication yet that CCP is "using" them, it could just be someone changing a value in the drifter KI (or maybe they are simply adapting, there is plenty of proof the new AI can shoot structures, I think there was even one that got killed)
---
You’re seriously overestimating the damage that’ll be done to the larger null coalitions, while likely underestimating the ISK and effort required to constantly be replacing structures, all while they’re under constant threat. The drifters might even shoot them in the hour window or whatever it is right before they anchor, which would make things even worse. There’s also the fact that while you may like it, some people in your group may not, and I’d assume you wouldn’t be speaking for a majority of the smaller groups that exist in the game
---
Make Eve dangerous again. We'll have MADA hats soon. Having NPC clearing out (un)occupied space, whelping botters and eventually turning Sov back neutral would be a fantastic way to shake things up. Everything that keeps this game running is fueled, ultimately, by things being blown up.
---
NPC shooting structures is a terrible boring mechanic if it stays as a long term mechanic and I would much rather have an easier time for players to shoot them down than NPC forcing people to defend shit against NPC.
---
Nice one ccp
---
Adapt or die dumbass
---
NOL in Delve last night
---
Oldest trick in the book: if you are going to hit null-sec to save PanFam, got to remember to put a few hits into PanFam as well to divert attention.

It's only supposed to be difficult for people who believe that dropping supers on everything is the only solution.
---
The current state of EVE is boring.

---

---
Adapt or die idiot
---
Why do you play Eve?
---
Only in NPC null. Sov-null dudes would have to use Keepstars. Tho even the deepest of sov-null regions aren't prohibitively far away from NPC null or low-sec regions for the purpose of evacuating random stuff.
---
I approve of this salt
---
Yes because CCP making the sand box a boring bunker building krabbing fest is much better.
---
Why don't you goto drifter space and ask. Don't forget to buy a T-shirt.
---
Adapt or die.
---
To me, this will show which nullsec group has the biggest balls. Everyone complains about Eve being made easier, this would make Eve a more hardcore and pure experience. 
---
Real consequences and real loss. People can stay in lowsec if they’re scared. 
---
What would you say is the biggest problem in eve? The blue donut, capital proliferation, rorquals or skill injectors?
---
I think you can tank it in a marauder but I think even then it has to be fit right. But yeah, any subcaps pretty much disintegrate.
---
What?  Groups used to be split up and spread out then everybody whined that they wanted to be more densely packed because, you know, Eve is a game where people interact with each other.  CCP obliged.
---
I'm not sure this "event" is going to be a new, permanent feature of space, is it?
---
I'm not a large group kind of player, but this is my understanding: 
---
The damage cap is the maximum dps of damage that a citadel can take. This means that aiming more weapons at the citadel will not do more damage.  
---
This in turn means there is a minimum time that you need to have the fleet on-grid, pointed at the citadel, to destroy the citadel. That in turn means that the defenders have at least that time to muster a defense fleet and shoot your ships out of the ether, while the attacker has to make a trade-off: do I want to hit the defense fleet, which is probably going to be reshipping in the citadel you are attacking like crazy and so superhard to kill quick enough, or you can attack the citadel to kill it more quickly.
---
That's honestly not representative of what most Corp CEO's and Line members are thinking on this. 
---
We are welcoming the chaos it brings.
---
They haven't have they.  At least not officially.
---
Nobody cared about this Goonstack-War anyway.
---

---
Any change is awesome in a game you play for months or years on end.  Let's be honest.
---
What is mission blitzing?
---
Krab and die in shit (in game), carebear
---
You don't need tackle with a Raven. You just need Maguseseseseses
---
they could do this by giving structure assets a drop % of what's stored there
---
Exactly. CCP has tried the empty sandbox approach, and has proven that you can't just rely on players to provide all the content. If you have a game driven purely by the players it's going to die because eventually everyone is going to get bored and leave. By adding new content that is initiated by NPCs and driven dynamically (in a non-scripted fashion) by players CCP can make the sandbox more dynamic and more engaging.
---
Why moons?
---
they call it "doomsday" for a reason
---
A csm year is the same duration of a calendar year.
---
Thank fuck the imicus is changing... 
---
It was the ugliest ship in the game.
---
So you want to make large alliance staging systems easier to camp and scout with only having a single keepstar in that system.  Nothing else.  Seems very lazy.
---
It should be easy enough to make them pick targets based on the size of the alliance, maybe add in a bit about how active a region if space is etc. Have the baddies send larger forces to the areas that have a higher concentration of capsuleers and more often that it would to their smaller neighbors.
---
Yea, I was watching the NCPL moveop a few weeks ago when SH1 got hit.
---
May this be another one of those anti-botter events?
---
Just wait until you realise that we ignore reinforcement timers too.
---
don't this things go through a reinforcement period?
---
Yes. Goons think they're hot shit for controlling the CSM but always forget we still have most of the devs.
---
Sorry that you are too short sighted and dumb to see he potential opening for pew during the age of our drifter overlords. Thoughts and prayers my fren.
---
Well players kinda forged some incredible crap in null over last years
---
Were there hit and runs?  The last hit and run I heard about involved two PL Titans getting warped off a keep to a dreadbomb.
---
Goons before Drifter invasion: Fuck the small guys lets blob them!  
---
Goons after Drifter invasion: Think of the small blocs ccp, just think of them!!!

they will get kills in the first week, then the bot will be trivially updated and they'll stop dying.
---
There's also a character named BORT this season.
---
I'd throw napalm. Lots and lots of napalm.
---
&gt;aren't fun for anyone involved.
---
People have been making this argument for as long as eve existed, those big lagfest fights aren't fun for the people there.
---
Yet i can point out to you videos, and streams of people on the fight, hyped up about it.
---
 Just because it isn't very engaging on a individual basis, it doesn't change the fact those fights still cause people to be pretty hyped up about it. I think you are right that there is a lot of people that drag themselves to those fights out of loyalty to their alliance, but to just disregard and hand wave the hyped attitude that many people in this game have towards those fights is in my opinion a huge insult to this game and its player base.
---
Also as for your comment in relation to the type of war that was fought, i failed to see the relevance of it. Regardless of how much of a standstill the war was, it was the biggest this game had seen since the Halloween War. The game had two major conflicts happening in regions completely opposite of each other. 
---
It was interesting from a lot of reasons not just the individual fights that were happening but also because of the diplomatic dealings that were going on, the logistical challenge especially towards the end of it, the strategic shift of priorities, when the North decided that the war in the south was lost so pulled back for a stronger defense of the north.
---
There were so many topics of interesting that people in this game were discussing on a daily basis about the war. During that war, i don't remember reading a single thread on this subreddit of "eve is dying", no, that war made eve look very much alive.
---
And again, during those 3 battles, people were hyped for it, before the fight, and after. Sure the losing side wasn't hyped about it, especially in the second X47 fight where the losing side basically had no chance of resisting against the Imperial Legacy Fleet due to server issues, but the hype for the war was there. 
---
And the interesting aspect of it, was also there, since the significance of those engagements and their consequences made players talk about it for weeks and months afterwards.
---

I'm a huge fan of chaos, this is great for the game. Watching the biggest force in the game have a panic attack and run because of NPC's is pure gold. Pure Olmeca Gold. 
---
In my wildest dreams, the NPC's will operate at a strategic level to apply more pressure the more an organization is coordinated and crabby. Like a built in New Eden PD that has a hunger for blue donuts.

---
Is it bad?
---
I've stopped after Season 7, not conciously but because I didn't really get around to it. But seeing this post made me think I should catch up on the new seasons.
---
Well, yeah, and the reason why the war last year was interesting was because both sides looked to be relatively equal be it in the Northern Front or in the Southern front (with the Imperial Shield supers assisting legacy). 
---
Up until UALX, it was all on the table as to who would come out with the victory in that war. 
---
And it wasn't until the second X47 fight happened that the North collapsed, but prior to that it was a (if i'm not mistaken) full month of legitimate war where both sides tried to do everything they could do to achieve their objectives.
---
Made me laugh, thank you :)
---
they have doomsdays on batleships 350k omni damage.
---
Like when they say “Biden is the front runner “
---
How is it bad for the game? The game is currently stagnate. Goons are blue with 70% of the null sec coalitions and have agreements with the other 30%. Let some NPCs fuck up some null sec blocs. I’ll be curious if they attack certain regions that have a concentration of players, ratting and mining or how it works. But, the more they break the strangle hold these alliances have the better. And if you want to stop them. Go fucking shoot them.
---
Just because some dog shits on your sandcastle doens't mean you are not playing in your sandbox anymore
---
I see what you did there.

---
I joined goons to become the bad guy so people would shoot me/back  
---
Hell did I know half of new eden would join. And now I fell in love with a empire building state.
---
No-one has broken, it's been a day
---
It's too early to say.  But it may happen that if you can get dunked by an NPC at any moment, well, that rules out ratting for everyone who isn't in a Super under an umbrella, local or not.
---
Think it through.
---
and that you think you ARE speaking for them is fucking hilarious.

I put a scanner in a drifter wormhole (Vidette) yesterday. The nulls that lead out from the wormhole all lead to regions that had drifter kills in them. Using zkill, the furthest away from a null wormhole that a drifter kill had occurred was 4 jumps, but I don’t have a large enough sample size to determine if that’s consistent behavior or not .
---
It was late and there were 20 wormholes connected, so I didn’t get a chance to check them all, but it did seem at first glance like they were “staging” from this drifter wormhole and using their null connections to “roam” around.
---
The only other thing worth mentioning is in the five combat anomalies that were present, only one had any sleepers upon initial warp-in. Otherwise the system was pretty quiet. No sleepers on any of the wormholes inside the drifter wormhole, none on any planets, and just the 3 I found in the one unknown anomaly. Excited to see how today plays out!
---
Did you see what we did to Tribute? Because that's what we did...
---
I think it is lame, it looks like this “invasion” is just an enhanced delete key managed by CCP staff.
---
like how all changes the last 5 years have benefited goons?
---
How does it changes any of that ? Is fighting over structure any less in favor of the defender ? No, why even bother, let the NPC do it.
---
Is invading a region worth it ? Even less so, you have an advantage at staying close to all your structure so you can defend them.
---
How does it changes anything ? Are drifters killing everyone supers ? No they are not. Goons will still have the strongest fleet in the game, nobody can compete of NPCs shoot down the structures building said caps and supers.
---
Are drifter killing structures in FW so it's not stupid again ? Nop, neither.
---
I'm all for watching shit being destroyed, I would much rather have what ever dev time was wasted on making PvE AI but turned into making players have more oppotunities or reasons to shoot at each others rather than reddit watching NPC shooting structures. As far as I'm concerned it's as boring as watching Goon shooting NCPL structures undefended and provide no interest for me to play in NS alliances.
---
What dreams? No, I just want people losing shit stupidly before figuring out what to do.
---
which is better

Upvoted for using DDG

I love this decision by CCP. I always felt that this is what EVE lacked; a more "alive" NPC side of the game. I once thought that having NPCs do things, like an Ammatar uprising or rogue Caldari FC "doing things" would be so cool and something players to react and aid/fight with. Things that wouldn't break the sandbox, just give it more texture. 
---
The Drifters being outwardly antagonistic now to us means a wrench gets thrown into the machines. Now we have something to react to, and if they dont take their foot off the gas we could see opportunities abound and scales tip. Imagine if the Drifters got so bad in Delve it stopped the Goons push into the north? The political implications could be incredible. Would NC/Panfam follow the goons back? Would they turn and push back against DC? Would they use the reprieve to rearm and gather allies for another round with Goons? I'm just being hypothetical but the possibilities are exciting
---
I hope CCP does more stuff like this and varies it to being more than just drifters. Like, a Star goes Supernova and wipes out a star system but leaves behind clouds of moon goo (heavy elements) that expands through the dead system that could crash markets if exploited. I hope CCp gives us more to react and deal with in the future 
---
Let it all burn
---
that's what i'm hinting at
---
Was this thing anchored and online prior to being hit by the drifters?
---
I for one, welcome our Drifter overlords.

Has there even been a confirmation that this isn't just a bug yet?
---
&gt;  THIS IS A BOOT.INI/MONOCLE LEVEL FUCKUP
---
Dominion is a great trailer, but after showing both trailers to people who don't play Eve, the "This is Eve" trailer was much better received. Especially once you know that it's real players and not "fake comms" like what was popular a few years back.
---
If you've seen the JesterTrek AMA, he mentions that Hilmar thought people would be confused as to why russians attack at the end and I can confirm that it did confuse some people I showed it too (who don't play Eve). Those who weren't confused all liked the This is Eve trailer more.

This is normal Behaviour for them

for the last month or so there were two major wars, one is still going. you make it sound like noone is doing anything, suggesting weird changes to the game that would only lead to everys alliance death that is in the way of the all eating monster that is delves mining fleet. get into a ceptor, travel to tribute and take a look what you're asking for.
---
who says i am making money with those alts? i am dropping on your puny tiny singleboxed t1 cruisers. see, you can't catch up and never will EVEN MORE SO then before thanks to injectors.
---
Sorry for wrecking your dreams i guess /s
---
Wouldn’t that be “MEDA”?
---
Exciting! Diving into this wormhole is the first time I’ve taken my time to actually see how they behave and what they do. 
---
Hope to see more kills soon! Wonder what would happen if someone opened a trade in a drifter wormhole....
---
i am certainly not jealous of the state your game is in :D i am glad i got in when it was still fun. it's nostalgia more then jealously.
---
what is there to be jealous about anyway? i have more isk then i could ever whelp before server shutdown, same goes for SP. ultimate safety thx to shitadels even if you are not in a big bloc. the only thing that's missing are acutally ppl to throw those SP and isk at. loss is meaningless, there are no consequences anymore. this game has lost it's soul
---
you still salty about him getting on the CSM lmao
---
&gt; there is ZERO incentive
---
It hurts the owner of the stuff.  I mean the charge to get it back + the inconvenience of it being in some low-sec (probably camped) station is not inconsiderable.
---
Or do you mean you want drops?  Who's the carebear here...
---
And this is why the drifters went attacking gotg they don't need to
---
another salty goon
---
Goons brag about bashing/grinding structures for a month but then complain when the drifters do it to them.
---
LOL.
---
&gt;official position on CSM
---
Its the CSM dude, its literally a meme
---
I think we have to make a distinction between "player interesting" and "spectator interesting". So, for example, those big fights aren't player interesting because it's honestly one of the worst experiences in gaming to fight them, but they are extremely spectator interesting due to their big implications. And also because the players inevitably become spectators because they can't log in/keep their client running/activate modules. Probably half of the people in streams and liveblogs are people that are actually on grid, it's just easier for them to see WTF is going on that way.
---
The strategic maneuvers were also rather interesting to *watch* as we were pretty confident about our offensive, until we saw the true extent of the goon war machine. It certainly wasn't fun to pack up all out shit and start leaving because of it tho.
---
But as I'm an active player in a  null bloc, I am way more interested in the player interesting things. It's what I pay my sub for after all. Last years war wasn't that. And this year's war is the antithesis of it. So just because a war has big numbers doesn't make it interesting for me. I'd rather take our high sec skirmishes with test over perimeter, than the "action" in this current war. Both of those war also felt kind of forced. Where conflicts had previously naturally built up over moons, space or spite, last year, and to a much bigger extent this year, just felt like "now is war. now is not war anymore". Sure the goons vaguely wanted revenge, but it was mostly for content creation. At that point the map was already split down the middle, and now it's 2/3rds goon aligned. Null sec isn't dying from a strategic standpoint, it's already dead and basically has been since the treaty last year. It's not spectator interesting anymore. There is no other outcome. Either goons win and everybody quits, or everybody quits before that happens. You can't speculate on some hidden asset PanFam has that might turn things around, because that would in no way be realistic. The only things that could save the north from certain doom if the goons did decide to bring the hammer down would be if mittens just simply disbanded and stole everything. How likely is that? Exactly. The appeal of EVE conflict was always "what will happen next? what does this mean for xyz?". That question just doesn't exist anymore. The gameplay feels accordingly.
---
Probably not to derp around in camped low sec system avoiding ganks to get your stuff back after paying a large percentage of its value in "tax" to release it.
---
Just do like several groups do, collapse drifter holes as soon as you find them....
---
He said in the fireside that they loved grinding structures, meanwhile in the fleets that are spending hours in (usually) near silence people just want their paps. Been playing eve for 7 years and those ‘fun’ fleets were some of the worst I’ve ever been in.

You calling me a carebear for wanting loot?

Yes, i want there to be more risk to living in nullsec.

the comment was aimed at your entity just farming the poor guy and his 1 tril in ships cause that's all your group does: taking out ships to WIN fights
---
I almost wish this were true. If it were true only Goons would have the isk to rebuild.
---
I see.  So I disappear off on deployment for a few weeks but before I do that I have to deploy all my characters to low sec because if I don't there's a risk when I return I'll have to pay out tens of billions of ISK in release fees?
---
What a stupid game design.

Did you miss the part where they started RFing structures? There wouldn't be anything to come back to

ITT: Bring your popcorn and read the goon salt ITT

Do you think this takes away the "sandbox" part of eve? Or is that still preserved?

Partial asset safety already exists in k-space on TQ today. It has for years. Just shoot engineering complexes and reactor-fit refineries. Poof, loot.
---
LOL, then we are both alike

You seem to be impervious to reason.

No, you don't want more risk, you want more loot.  That is all.
---
Don’t be scared.

Goons germans now create alt corps for bots as well? PLA should sue their asses.

I'm actually amazed. Is there a video of this? Because from the BR it doesn't look like there was enemy presence that justified a bombing run. Which would mean that they didn't miss but just straight up went up to a blue, maybe even purple fleet and fucking bombed it lmao

So what you’re saying is that you have to wring the fuck out of the bath towel that is eve to get a few drops of fun out of it?
---
Nah, fuck that.
---
I certainly think EVE is no longer a "pure" sandbox (ie. every single thing that happens is dictated by the players) but EVE wasn't really that in the first place and the game is somewhat better for it. EVE is still a sandbox, as the Drifters aren't hard mechanics restricting players from certain actions. This recent change simply means that New Eden is more dynamic and there's more going on than just the players. Rather than a static sandbox that relies on the players for content generation to the severe detriment of the community EVE is now a more active sandbox with stuff going on that isn't caused by the capsuleers but which capsuleers can interact with and effect.       
---
Personally, I'd love to see more of this dynamic content. Things like NPC bulk haulers moving between systems, better NPC mining operations, even battles fought between NPCs (like what we've already seen) that players can interact with and effect. It makes the game more dynamic and provides content without requiring the players to create all the content, which as we've seen results in the creation of safe, risk-averse content that is detrimental to the game as a whole.
---
Small groups are fine, dump your tears at another door.
---
The new player problem is easy to fix. CCP are too dumb to listen.
---
Problem with that assessment is that there's at least nine different individual Drifter types encountered thus far.
---
I really hate the current atron hull. I'll take anything.

Really, quit if they lose ships? That's pathetic sounding... “A ship in harbor is safe — but that is not what ships are built for.”

If you shoot an engineering complex or reactor-fit refinery, on TQ, right now, you get loot. Things drop. You can pick them up and sell them for money.

There’s no incentive to do this besides intentionally discarding your corps advantage over another for “fun”.

Hey Siri
---
Reeee, someone ruined my narrative
---
What if their doomsday function would increase it's rof based on the # of ppl the NPC is fighting and on the activity in the region, to the point where an average drifter BS would be a 2km/s tiny titan with insane rof in Delve, but a pussycat in dead nullsec space. :)
---
Man, you really need to train posting to II ASAP, this is pathetic.
---
would make geography actually mean something again. the exact same mechanics existed before shitadels and it worked perfectly.
---
Drifters have been around for a while, yet bots still exist
---
In theory you would scale it all somehow.
---
all the things you mentioned sound like content. bring it on
---
NPCs cannot be timezone Tanked. NPCs cannot be flipped on the CSM. NPCs do not care about kill boards. They are the perfect threat 2 all of the anti-fun measures player groups have invented to outwit each other.
---
Omg....
---
That was the answer all along tbh.
---
You could have just said that you didn't have a source. I'll just wait until there's a dev post about it, thanks anyway.
---
Most interesting... So far we didn't had any in world statement regarding the situation, but considering the size of what we are experiencing, that will most likely be one of the events discrebed in the prophecy!

It must be a tough life when you get so butt hurt over a Reddit post. I have some questions... How much internet time does your mom/wife/boyfriend allot you per week? When you pee do they help you hold up your belly so you don't piss on your gut flap? Who's in charge of cleaning out the cheese/crumbs underneath your man mammaries? Do they help you wipe your ass, or do you own a bidet? I've always wondered what is like to be such a fucking beta...
---
😂 for real.
---
Would make some sense because U-G is the only -1.0 in Geminate.
---
&gt; Also, “move to w-space if you dont like it” and “i dont want to lose all my stuff when i leave the game for 5 months” aren’t valid excuses to keep asset recovery.
---
Says you.
---
Ok you’re dense
---
If they could detect them easily they would just ban them; bots dying now just haven't updated their scripts... yet.
---
Shit got it.
---
XD
---
Because that's what pos towers were tied to, and it means a system full of moon crackers is a baseline level of occupied space.

🤔
---
What's there to understand? Partial asset safety already exists. Why do so many podbrains dissociate reality when they are reminded of this?
---
Ed: just got this from an FB page
---
No, whoever has the lowest sell order is matched.
---
We haven't really seen the "one becomes four" thing. Maybe it will come later in the invasion. Something like the Trig separating in 4 factions. We already know that they have a few factions, some that like Rogue Drones, some that don't. Maybe they're going to separate into 4 factions.
---
One plus three equals four. Triglavs are the three making one into four.

https://eve.fandom.com/wiki/Jamyl_Sarum
---
&gt; ASSASSINATION
---
&gt; In the year YC117, Empress Jamyl Sarum was travelling to the Safizon System in the Avatar Class Titan Seraph. She was being escorted by a large number of ships of the imperial guard. Suddenly, a large number of drifters appeared, got past the escort ships and attacked the Seraph, destroying it and killing the Emperess. The drifters then jumped away without engaging the other ships (the Seraph was their only target).
---
&gt; After some days without response or word from the Imperial Guard or anyone, it was later confirmed in an statement that Empress Jamyl Sarum had deceased shortly after the attack due to the injuries.
---
I almost resubscribed. Oh well.
---
'tis awaiting who the new drifter story plays out to see who is left
---
I see your point, but most of Eve does not want to fight... I appreciate the solution CCP came up with here, something around the lines of "If you won't clean shit fine... We will solve the issue" and solving the issue they are! OverPowered NPC faction is butt violating EVErything in sigh! If nothing, this is a nice shake up of the peace and quiet that Eve has become!
---
I'm going to guess what they are getting at is that there used to be a balance of structure proliferation because they were limited by the number of moons in a given star system. Now that balance no longer exists oh, so there is no correlation between a system with more celestial bodies and a larger number of structures.
---

Hm ok did not know that.

Considering SkillU disbanded and no longer holds sov, you may be waiting for a while...

or maybe each alliance/corp/individual has to pick a side... Support the Trig or the Drifters... then backstab whoever wins so capsuleers reign supreme and can go back to squabbling over the scraps among themselves.

I have never in all my days seen anyone get pwned with the downvote button like this on r/eve.

Fraternity lost a jump gate. They reinforced it then came back and finished the job.
---
I really like how them reinforcing a single Keepstar (the Horde one got safed, looks like drifters are fine with sitting in structure bombs and also got distracted by shooting the Ansiplex gate) lets people think the end of nullsec as we know it is near.
---
Do I hope they follow up on the timers they created? Yes I do, primarly because it would mean that the KI is in fact advanced enough to do so.
---
They might attack sov (the Entosis module is somehow connected to them), but I think it will be some time until we see this (because it also requires them to move around in the constellation for the second timer)
---
Overall, I think the Drifter attacks should continue to be completely random.
---
Unless its their party
---
We have differing ideas of what meaningful means then 🤷‍♂️
---
Most of Eve doesn't want to fight over structure because they are cancer to fight around because you can't defang the structure, you need to attack it 3 times, it has a damage cap AND it's during the defender choosen timezone. Nerf all that and players will for sure do it a lot more.
---
Again, what's the point of having NPC whipping structures in Eve ? Players still won't attack each others anyway.
---
Next I predict w-space c6 farmers will take over kspace.

Maybe bother to check if this has been posted here already for about 12 hours now... numerous times...

Also all of null seems to be burning, no matter of the activity level
---
i laughed so hard that my coffee fucked my keyboard. well played good sir
---
&gt;  There’s no incentive to do this besides intentionally discarding your corps advantage over another for “fun”.
---
GEE I WONDER NOBODY IS FIGHTING EACH OTHER 
---
&gt; There needs to be game mechanics to back up the choice to weaken your fleet.
---
It's called "being engeable" and it creates fights.
---
You’re telling me that the biggest alliance in the game needs asset recovery to exist?
---
You can train into every race's ships regardless of how you start. As a beginner depending on what you want to do in eve, I'd have different recommendations, but you probably won't know right away.
---
I feel like Caldari ships and missile skills make for the best start, as they give you great flexibility. The Kestrel is an excellent early pvp ship, the Caracal / Osprey Navy Issue (more or less same shit) is a fleet staple everywhere, and going all the way up if you're doing hisec shit the Raven has been a go-to for over a decade.
---
For small gang, a lot of their ships are kinda middle of the road, they don't have a lot of best in class choices, but they don't have a lot of donkeys either. A Merlin will do the job great in a blaster brawling gang, a Hookbill is flexible, the Osprey Navy is the best cheap anti-tackle out there, and you need those skills to get into Mordu's ships and Gurista's ships anyway, which are kings of small gang warfare.
---
Show us on the doll where the drifters touched you

It was real I was there.

yikes, he can't even read what i'm saying

This post right here officer, thats the bait.

You can't defend it? Then it deserves to die... simples...

Boom , headshot.

And it just started... literally not even a week ago...
---
\*skimming
---
bait obvious
---
&gt; In another version of Eve where small groups are constantly skirmishing with each other and either no megapowers exist
---
So, the first few years of EVE, then?
---
Or they need a river
---
I only know about the Horde one. Killmail?
---
My guy, partial asset recovery is not what i’m talking about. I know that shit exists, but that’s not the point i’m trying to make. 
---
REMOVE ALL ASSET RECOVERY FROM NULLSEC.
---
What he is saying already has existed in Jspace for a looooong time, at least the first part.
---
As for the war, it's over in the north, if goons want to, they can roll over all the structures, NCPL no longer have the power to fight that, and almost 2/3 of eve is blue donut-ed.
---
lore roleplay by CCP
---
Most smaller groups see Structures as "deployables" creating content, and not as safespace for being safe from fucking non-consensual PvP (and now PvE XD)
---
I don't think I'll be alive by then. Had to keep it reasonable ya know?
---
Fun per hour, boyos, fun per hour.
---
I guess in a way you're right about my bros in Dreddit too, and sometimes I feel guilty for taking that option, but for whatever reason all my small gang bros are there.
---
I don't see why we need to make that distinction at all, i'm just talking about general interest of the game. And for better or worse, that war had a lot of interest riding on it. Not only during but prior to even happening, the growing tension between the Imperium and the North, ever since 9-4 was very much a topic of discussion in this subreddit.
---
I mean if OP was talking about Interest when it comes to player interest, than why is this interesting? NPC shooting structures? the only possible outcome of this is that coalitions will need to have ocasional ops to do PVE content, where is the fun in that?
---
So i don't get it why you and a few other people here are focusing so much on "player fun" when it comes to the topic of "interesting things that are happening in nullsec".
---
Also about your comment that the previous war just happened because people decided that was the time. 
---
I completely disagree with it. It did not started for the hell of it, there were a lot of actions and consequences prior to the war breaking out, the colapse of the Russians, the formation of the HRE, the growing tensions between Winter Coalition + Triumvirate against Legacy due to Legacy support of the DRF.
---
Eventually that tension was enough to make pieces on the chessboard move, and when a certain important piece made a very important move (PL move south) it was the trigger for the Imperium to counter that move with their own move North, thus starting the biggest war this game had seen since the Halloween war.
---
There were a lot of things that made the previous war happen, it didn't happen because one coalition leader decided to just go for it.
---
As for the current war however, i do agree with you. It very much started because somebody decided to just do it. And i'm sure you will noticed from my comments that i'm specifically talking only about the war last year, because at least in my opinion that war was really interesting, but this current one isn't, because one side just dominated from the very beginning. It still generates interest of course, but not the same interest. 
---
Again as i pointed out in my previous reply, during that war, i honestly do not remember reading any thread that gained any amount of traction about "eve is dead" during that period, because from the perspective of the player base, that war was very exciting, and made eve look very much alive.
---
I am fairly sure this is a random goon trying to troll other goons.
---
Even better. More content for everyone, nice to see CCP spring something like this instead of announcing it 1-2 months in advance, peeps can't be 99% ready.
---
i r/eve just a place to let all our thoughts spill out into a new thread... ?! why not post your thought in one of the 10 other posts? :-)
---
How the hell are we supposed to awox npcs?
---
You're in the wrong sub, Tencent. Where's my blam?
---
I had a hard time getting through the noir season too. The next season is better though. I don't think they are going to be able to capture the magic of the early seasons. I think the theme seasons are going to stick around.
---
Go against the current popular weekly r/eve trend. It does wonders.
---
"getting past the escort ships" is an incredibly easy task in EVE
---
haha goon bait... worst bait...
---
then again if you are serious... just shadaaap!
---
No man. There’s absolutely no tangible incentive to weaken your position, just as in real life, besides a better fight. Why would you potentially sacrifice any aspect of your corps success because you want a better fight?
---
I understand your frustration, but your frustration is wishful thinking. People don’t behave chivalrously and valiantly like that. They behave in their best interests.
---
What we need is a shake up, something that makes matching large fleets with large fleets in the best interest of everybody again.
---
You cannot sadly. 
---
Welcome to try however.
---
I've been living in one since they fixed it a year or two ago
---
Players already can't be arsed to shoot structures when they can loot multiple trillions, on TQ, in k-space, right now. How's removing all asset safety going to change things?
---
&gt; i were in charge of goons i would have carried on in the north at least until a week or so until you had some data on how consistently the drifters follow up on timers
---
You say that as if it'd be unheard of for someone to have dropped to Goons a dime on the mechanic.
---
Either that, or they're gutless cowards.
---
Or both.
---
"Adapt or die"

---
This is the hard truth. But Eve imitates life, everyone the shit they don't like because it provides the security and well they think they need.
---
The thing is that the moment you stop playing that game it doesn't matter that everyone else is playing that game.
---
fuck man... some of you lot are just hard to please... there is no glass half full ever is there... just quit already....
---
The hard truth is that people believe security and wealth are the points of the game. The hopeful part is that once you stop playing that game, it doesn't matter that everyone else is.
---
You must have never been aboard "Clear Skies"... 
---
It even has a couch.
---
The beginning is a bit messed up and loops a few times.
---
nice video though))
---
This brother gets it.
---
I was trying to solo FW PVP and that just isn't it.
---
Once I was accepted into Horde the game came alive.
---
Then he move to SH-1 was ordered and the game got flipped on it's head just as I was obtaining a small grasp.
---
Then I watched Olmeca's vid where he evicts his old corp multi boxing on 5 accounts. 
---
I thought to myself this dude must be the greatest Eve player ever.
---
Then I thought about what I had actually just watched. 
---
5 accounts being used at the same time.
---
Then after many many discussion in Standing about injectors/bots extractors what it takes to make ISK and how many accounts.....
---
I was like I can get pretty retarded with games but this just seems like too much.
---
AND then you realize the real game isn't even about undocking your ship but the small select few that are herding the cats and it can turn into a big head trip.
---
Ultimately I came to the conclusion that it was all too muh and again I think most gamers probably come to this conclucsion when it comes to Eve again hence the retention issues.
---
Didn't even have Navy faction crystals..
---
Because it will start clearing all the bullshit citadel spam and make those structures actually worth attacking and defending.
---
Wtf are you talking about season 6 isn't even out yet.
---
&gt; There’s absolutely no tangible incentive to weaken your position, just as in real life, besides a better fight. Why would you potentially sacrifice any aspect of your corps success because you want a better fight?
---
Fun ? An actual fight rather than boringly people running away ? Corp mate who enjoyed a proper fight and got content ?
---
Some people don't like surprises:

---
It was online, not just anchored.
---
Lol.  I am sure a lot of groups would enjoy a region specific response, with Delve getting the bad end of it. Pretty sure though that that level of unfairness would do a good job pissing off any number of paying customers.  :-)
---
If I were to guess, like some of the other recent PvP, they will escalate based on what people bring to a fight.  So people will bring some min/maxed subcap fleet to deal with the bad guys.  
---
I could be totally wrong though, but that is actually a pretty fair way to do things, as long as CCP does not ask for too much to destroy the bad guys.
---
And that doesn't stop a year going faster than you realised, as I pointed out with the fact that we are already half way to Christmas. In direct response to some one saying it would be a long year.
---
The perfect bot counter. Pog in chat
---
It would die even faster in Jspace rip
---
The lackluster individual experience does not at all diminish its quality as a topic of discussion about events in nullsec, and the significant morale boost that winning these fights will grant to your line members, and when it comes to nullsec wars, morale is pretty much everything, since you can't make a demoralized line member to login for the hours long slug-fest, or the boring structure bashing that every war becomes when the defender ceases to show up for the defense of their territory/assets.
---
So what do you suggest to improve the game?
---
Do nothing and let 2/3 huge coalitions dominate null sec which is in huge area way safer than high and way more profitable?
---
We are going day by day to a real blue donut if you haven't see.
---
Having infinite belt and anomalies that generate ton of mineral and print isk isn't balanced and healthy for the game.
---
You can literally use a dozen of rorqual half afk.
---
The goals of the suggestions were also to decrease afk isk making
---
Sooo, is it worthwhile to go and salvage shit now?
---
Well, I approve this post before lost something blinky to drifters

One theory I heard is they attack the new triglavian related structures (ansiblex gates and cyno jammers) as well as any upwell structures on grid with those

I always thought it would be cool to have some kind of option where you could create a character aligned with one of the NPC pirate or Drifter factions. Your character cannot earn currency, and they cannot dock in any player station.
---
Instead, you spawn in a pirate frigate. And basically as you aggress players, even if you do not kill them, you earn some kind of loyalty points or experience tied to that pirate faction. When you get enough points, you can upgrade to the next tier of ship, allowing you to fly better and better pirate ships for free with the incentive of pissing off capsuleers.
---
You would be permanently shoot on sight in Empire space for players and police. But it would be great for role-playing. You could even make it that NPCs will reinforce you based on your alignment level if a player attacks you. Not to the extent that the full NPC fleets do, but just basic stuff with a couple Cruisers or frigates.
---
I’ll repeat what I said:

&gt;I understand your frustration, but your frustration is wishful thinking. People don’t behave chivalrously and valiantly like that. They behave in their best interests.

&gt;What we need is a shake up, something that makes matching large fleets with large fleets in the best interest of everybody again.
---
“Fun” isn’t in the best interests of a Corp. Money, territory, and influence is.
---
The problem is that in the real world, less war is exactly what you want inside your borders. In eve, you want wars: it’s the point of the game, but the whole appeal of eve is that it mimics real life. It’s player corporations are nations, and nations seek to expand their empire, and secure peace and comfort for their members. It’s human nature.

There has to be something implemented to give people the push to begin truly conflicting again.

With a hundred drifters which agress and scram on sight  (Not even time vor setting cloak) it was impossible for me to come away. If i knew ,that such an enourmous change of Gameplay come, i had never undocked and picked a cheaper Ship to rat.We will see, how CCP will change/fix the

Drifter Agression and Amount for Future. For me who seen how much is in reinforcement and distructed so far alone in this System, EVE will significant change in 0.0 Rentings. Without a specialized great fleet in Background Rating, Mining and even  PI is in such Systems impossible.

(no german bot all ISK handmade)

Yeah, but it's still heavy on the nullsec side.
---
15% isn't appealing enough. For me anyway. Give me a 20-25% and I'll bite...
---
Neat
---
Pardon my ignorance, but these structures go through a reinforcement period right?
---
So the drifters reinforced it yesterday and showed up today to kill it?
---
Or organize multiple fleets for multiple tasks.  Shocking idea, I know.
---
Fucking goons. Still can't see the forest because too many trees are in the way.
---
You do realize CCP using NPC in game is them directly playing the game?  Like they literally code the AI to do exactly what they want done... not an outsourcing at all.
---
I got carried away, thank you. Also, no one likes a pointer-outer person, don't shame people in public you jerk.
---
I hope this keeps going for a bit, if nothing else to thin out structures a little, perimeter comes to mind for HS version.....
---
Out of curiosity, how long does researching that BPO take?
---
That's fair, personally the next time I feel like your opinion matters I will print this out and put it on my fridge. I mean the only time that I actually found a place I liked was TRI 2016, Waffles pre PL and now here. If I was smarter some of those corps would never have happened and I am the first to admit that I don't like the reputation for corp hopping that I have and am trying to correct it before I hang this game up.

Salty much? lol

Your tears are delicious.

Okay then
---
Ich lese nur mimimi...
---
You are not wrong, but you cannot expect players to basically throw away the stuff they have built for the chance of having fun. The game needs to be designed and balanced in a way that promotes and rewards players for taking risks with their assets. We're forcing them to do so, and making the content itself engaging.
---
I'm OK with that. To be honest, if this kind of thing continues I may resubscribe.
---
REMOVE LOCAL

&gt; What we need is a shake up, something that makes matching large fleets with large fleets in the best interest of everybody again.

Like easier to engage structures like I'm also advocating in the comment that is getting downvoted to death right now ?
---
Omg dude relax.  You had a good run.  It’s over.  Delve belongs to the drifters now.
---
Yes, and there is not damage cap for drifters...they can reinforce it in 3-5min...nobody though they would show up for the final timer...
---
&gt;That's fair, personally the next time I feel like your opinion matters I will print this out and put it on my fridge.
---
I expect a picture of this.
---
Thanks for the idea.
---
This is the best thing I’ve ever read, new copy pasta
---
Anything that makes Goons cry, I enjoy.
---
Thanks CCP!
---
2 months ago I kinda came up with the same idea. A genocide event. Where npc's would force their way into nullsec and start burning away everything in their path. Now this is not what it ended up to be it's nice to see npc's actually attacking ratters, structures and stuff like that. This game's got to much wealth and big stuff, time to burn it all down.
---
So drifters kill botters, giving roamers and WH chumps less to shoot at? Sounds great.
---
Same here. Add some excitement and maybe shake up the donut a bit. 
---
At least CCP is attempting to improve things, regardless.
---
And it’s not even most of the goons just the ones with titans in build
---
Wait that’s what that means? You might want to re-word it because that’s definitely not what it’s coming across as saying.
---
I'm not asking to throw away their supers and never use T2 / pirat BS comps, but they for sure would have more fun poking at others with T1 comps and not blueing up everyone.
---
&gt; The game needs to be designed and balanced in a way that promotes and rewards players for taking risks with their assets. 
---
Like easier / less boring to engage structure like I'm talking about in the comment that is getting downvoted to death right now ?

Okay, the fact that they are showing up for the final timer is cool, the fact that they don't have damage caps is fucking hilarious though.
---
Something like 12 years for 10/20.
---
&gt;only goons are crying
---
&gt;look at all the botters crying.
---
Given that goons didn't appear on piechart of shame. 
---
You're going to have to pick one group for this narrative.

This could be as close to a good argument for mercy  but would lead to citadel skins being sold thru the NES so... I’ll allow it

If this is an antibot mechanic will have to see how everything plays out.

Drifters &lt;3

I’m sure they’ll catch a few yeah

Here is the CCP dev with the insider info!
---
Like 16:00 yesterday when it started I believe /u/Tuz started it.
---
&gt; I would much rather have an easier time for players to shoot them down
---
You're telling me everyone is understand this as "making NPC easier to be shot at" rather than structures as I meant ?
---
not to install a bunch of new strongholds?
---
What’s a drifter?
---
Must be from those ex-bob corps.
---
Yup.
---
Very few of the Mega corps in EVE have leadership that understand warfare, or conflict, outside their narrow EVE view.
---
I think this change is awesome, and I lost one of my cits yesterday because of it.
---
It's EVE.  I've been (painfully) losing shit in space for 16 years now.

omg fuck you! You gave me so much hope. Then the end ... Ill stay unsubbed.

That's some hard reaching you're doing there, kiddo. Try actually reading it next time.

Well, if you missed twenty pages worth of kills, a few streams talking about it, a leaked alliance ping and entire subreddut worth of meme
---
Yes, this is a surprise attack.from drifters/CCP
---
Then players can come along and blow them up and if they are unable another invasion wave can do it once it gets silly.
---
we need the r/eve drifter equivalent to come in here and erase all shitposts...
---
I do have to agree with you that the last war had much more of a prelude than the current one, but it still felt kinda snappy. Previously wars were always these escalating, long term conflicts, and last year was really just the spark on the powder keg. 
---
As for interest in relation to the drifters, I do think they are very interesting. Not necessarily because of interesting gameplay (at least initially), but because they are going to shake up the completely stale null meta if done correctly. 
---
And we did have some fun ops last year, but overall it was really just a lite version of this year for a lot of minute to minute gameplay. Which was enough to keep a lot of us happy , as there was atleast *something* happening. So especially relative to this year, it felt a lot more alive. It still doesn't compare to the golden age of 2010-14 th.

What makes you think it won't scale with the size of the alliance in question and the density of space occupation and use ?

It would be pretty silly if it was linear.

“I would rather have an easier time; for players to shoot them down” is how it reads. It should say “I would rather players have an easier time shooting them down.”

People read comments quickly, so reading comprehension is poor usually. That’s why you’re being downvoted I think. Easy to fix with a little clear up.

"The Game"

For the first time in EVE history, we are the mission NPC’s that get 1 shot.

Well TIL I learn how to make people angry at me over a sentence that was not clear
---
What part of "Overextended" do you not grasp?
---
Now you have to defend what you took.  Stop fucking whining, FFS.

This is just fucking stupid.  What are you, new?

No free ISK, time to adapt I guess.
---
Oh silver well the next TiS will be interesting between him and Artemis (who I’m sure is tickled pink over this).  
---
I’m in the same war Silver is (not on the front lines but still) and while frustrating to spend months tooling up and building doctrines to prosecute the PvP wars in a sandbox environment only to feel the rug pulled out from under you by invincible npc spawns.  I sympathize but see it as collateral damage in a way because there’s no “good time” to do this.  There’s always gonna be some group in a bad spot.  Ccp clearly wants to beat back the forest of 0.0 space, as they should be allowed to do.  This is an awesome mechanic to accomplish that goal!
---
I don’t know much about it, but here’s a good read : https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Drifters
---
They don’t seems to talk about recent changes with the Drifters. Basically, you now have Drifter Cruisers and Battleships, but that’s pretty much it.
---
that it is and always will be - nullsec blocs do organisation better than others i.e. organised ballot vote
---
tbh if we had stitch kaneland flying the flag for solo &amp; lowsec pilots i would have been content with the result
---
I said that.  Meaning we have to put up with Olmecas bullshit for the next 12 months.  
---
Try to keep up and pay attn to who’s saying what
---
Wow. You could bounce a titan off that forehead
---
Considering I know the guy, DM me his info and I'll tell you if he's full of shit.
---
Yikes.Dawg.Jpeg
---
I find their tears quite tasty.  Makes me glad I got back into EVE after a few years away.
---
What I dont understand is, why now? Drifters where introduced 4year ago. What took them soo long to start doing this? Are they related to the trig duders?
---
It’s r/eve
---
And besides, it’s not the sentence that made people angry. It’s how the sentence changes the entire point that you’re making into one that says “just give up your capitals for the sake of fun” rather than “ccp, please make it easier for sub-caps to bash structures.”
---
Wait is this why I get awoxed all the time
---
W:hat:
---
I honestly fail to see how the drifters are going to do any shakeup on the null meta. 
---
I think the main reason why people think that is  that we don't know what CCP actually plans to do with this, so everyone have their own wild dream of what they think its going to be the next step, but the reality is going to be that the major powrers are going to figure it out a way to effectively deal with the drifters, and ccp will be too slow to adapt (as they always have been).
---
Hopefully the powerblocks will start using titans to clear this things off and some idiot is going to screw up their boson and get killed by the drifters, that would be funny, but hardly shake the meta.
---
Well we do actually. but if you absolutely insist, please do go to the EVE-O forums. You will find that the Drifter group there known as Clan ISD is exactly what you are looking for. The drifter group here known as Clan MOD_TEAM, you leave them alone. No need to risk a DD from them.

&gt;“Fun” isn’t in the best interests of a Corp.
---
It used to be.  Years ago a whole hell of a lot of military engagements used to be initiated purely because they wanted some fun and people were getting bored.  So what changed?  Why is everyone boring as fuck now?
---
It (should) shake up the meta by getting rid of the citadel clutter. It would also (hopefully) force alliances to keep a contingent of supers at home just in case. This would stop max helidicking like in the current war. Hopefully.

Wow.  Just.  Wow

Amen.

DUNDUN DUN DUNDUN

What fucking game are you playing, because it's not EVE.
---
"Waaaa... it hurts!  Stop picking on me!  Let's see how you like it when your space toys get blown up!"
---
LOL!
---
Dude, I've lost hundreds of billions of ISK worth of shit in EVE in the last decade and a half.
---
EVE is all about loss.  The single most punishing MMO out, and one of the longest running. 
---
Stop whining and adapt or die.  The true EVE way.
---
It'd be more refreshing if it was an interesting topic.
---
The game has got to the point where were exited the AI is finally doing... not actually a whole lot other than the bits of the game actual players find boring as shit...
---
if all ur buddies hate it too then why not leave together and do your own thing? if you need help with personal income streams, i can list out ways that make you a shit ton more ISK per single account than VNI ratting.
---
also you can do big battles too, just not on one of the big blobby sides ;)  you and your buddies can make some awesome bomb runs or something, or come in petes and snipe off sabres/tackle ships/ping ceptors or whatever
---
What is this? Cant you put this into a spreadsheet like every normal EvE player?
---
There’s already jump bridges dead. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were some forts dead in a week if not keepstars
---
And they can cry if they want to.
---
Hi, not a random line member btw.
---
You are an idiot.
---
INIT. was leaving. GSF planned to push into Malpais until the drifter thing happened. 
---
I understand that you are not privy to planning conversations, you being a high sec miner according to evewho after all. 
---
So yeah, nice try, but if you are going to throw shade, have a clue.
---
Where do I sign up for this?
---
&gt; You’re seriously overestimating the damage that’ll be done to the larger null coalitions,
---
I hope not.
---
A million times better if a post than Olemca's .
---
Maybe we all buy the $5 plex and indicate that the proceeds to towards a nice cocktail hour for the team responsible for this.
---
Small whale here (only 2x rorqs): this is a good change
---
Maybe switch your DSCAN to 360 then?
---
As a lowsec little guy in an alliance with some structures, pls make this a permanent feature CCP. :)
---
This is fake, it was low power.
---
Hahaha holy shit you idiots really do only rehash things Mittani tells you.

Back when I played SWG, I saw a cool old fashioned car at a stoplight, and as the light turned and it pulled away, I got this overwhelming urge to examine it so I could look at the model.

Warning: 291 killmails have been detected as possible killboard padding. This may reflect legitimate kills, may not, but now you know.
---
Dirty kb padder
---
I didn't miss the point at all. I know it has just started.
---
Zkillboard reacts.
---
There's a guy up in the thread who is vocal about it being a bad idea, he did say at one point he is a testie .... so there is the odd one out. :P
---
Ive been asking for such a feature to shadow drop for such a long time. Holy shit CCP
---
Just glass nullsec.
---
Man that's a good one xD
---
If drifters kill undefended structures/POS
---
Then bots would have no where to hide when  neut enters local
---
That's a counter, I guess?
---
we'll see
---
They are computer generated, spawned legion, controlled by AI .... off-c they did, they don't need to sleep.
---
Apply for a job at CCP and make it happen.
---
Lmao imagine being this retarded
---
Thats an alliance name i hvent seen in a long time :)
---
LMAO GOONS.
---
"boot.ini level fuckup"
---
Meanwhile in Test we're just laughing at the Drifters hitting the backlines and renter systems of both sides of the war.
---
If CCP backs down because of goon whining this will start the final run on the game. The rest of us will adapt. GO DRIFTERS GO.
---
Y'all goons are literally subhuman.
---
I mean, does it need to be that simple? It could just be a random roll of the dice, with all structures being equal. In that system, those with the most structures will, over a long enough time period, suffer the most attacks, just because probability dictates that they come up on the roll more often.
---
They should just have a bpc of it drop on death.
---
Nc aren't sleeping,  at this point it was hibernation
---
More loot means more risk. It gives a reason to want to grind through structure timers, more so than just, "FC said undock"
---
What happened when the old outposts were retired? They converted all of them to faction fortizars?
---
Taking a pay cut to work for hilmar?  
---
Hard no. If I want to have my creativity and soul crushed by bureaucracy I'll get a job in government.
---
Nope

https://zkillboard.com/kill/77499156/
---
That was 4 years ago? Shieet.
---
We could have stayed in tribute longer.  I think is being in tribute generates the more content then when we’re in delve. 
---
I have fun glassing a region.  I know there’s a few groups going after stragglers that don’t keep up with the fleet. NC shows up to some fights.  Down in Delve, we don’t have our super umbrella, and idiot goons try to mine, so they are having fun. 
---
Now, we go back to delve, NC doesn’t have anyone to fight.  We go back to mining and building more caps. Our super umbrella is now covering our mining, so the whaling fun will dry up.  
---
Which sounds like it’ll generate more fun?
---
As a general life advice, if you want to give some employee(s) an attention or a gift, do so directly. Never give anything to their boss, there's always a chance things won't turn out as you originally expected.
---
I too am glad to see the world burn, well, as long as it doesn't come to my hause
---
LOL they hit frat staging and they didn't defend it?
---
I guess nobody cares about shield timers. I hope they hit these armor timers, make more, and just start glassing shit.
---
&gt; Unfortunately, we will never know more about this prophecy as the npc ship containing the lore information was destroyed by a player shortly after Caroline's Star was found.
---
Can you tell me more about it? Is there a link or something about this lore ship? I'm curious about it!
---
Timing was to be expected, CCP watches what happens in nullsec.
---
Remember the casino war ?; bans did not start flying until after the whole thing was over, after the payment was over and the nullsec shakeup had happened.
---
The present war in the north is over, Goons won (by their own admission in the OP), and their blue donut covers 2/3 of nullsec, not to mention having the highest supercap fleet ever.
---
This type of situation does not create conflict, it creates stagnation, so CCP tends to act to make sure conflict continues.
---
The present situation is a warning of things to come, CCP will setup the summer with changes of this nature untill ppl start logging back in, in the autumn so that they can return to an active game, where there are options, and hopefully, a winter war that will keep ppl busy.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEE DRIFTERS TAKING MY REGION I HUNT THERE DAMNIT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I hope we get more chaos soon, welcome to eve.
---
Really? I just get the sense of "great more scripted AI to grind through until we can actually get on with playing the game".
---
But I do want to know, from a more perspective, more about the drifters . Their backstory always sounded cool
---
*taps forehead*
---
46 yo, never heard this variation before.  Shut yo face hole.
---
No thanks. I don't mind losing my ship to NPCs but it's not acceptable for anyone else to have fun at my expense.
---
So how come the drifters don’t go into anoms? (Where the bots are ratting?)
---
Ha! Had an alt in there for that...the avatar just vanished, what an anti climax
---
The Bashening?
---
Thanks dad

[https://imperium.news/breaking-drifters-attacking-player-structures/](https://imperium.news/breaking-drifters-attacking-player-structures/)
---
&gt;UPDATE 2314: INN has learned that at least one Pandemic Horde keepstar has come under attack. An attempt was made to reinforce the KQK Keepstar, but the Drifter fleet was destroyed.
---
According to the imprium news,  drifters can be destroyed.
---
&gt;!Arthimos are not part of the invasion. !&lt;Are they hard to kill ? How is the loot ?
---
How much Drifters fleet are running null ?
---
why not just kill the drifters ?
---
why CCP dont talk about it ?
---
why Init withdraw from war and then complain about it ?
---
why is it hard to kill NPCs ? isn't ratting the most common activy in titan space ?
---
This sub is gold today. thank you &lt;3
---
The best thing about is that noone knows what the fuck is going on, how long or to what extent this will go or what it implies towards the future.
---
I'm so fucking glad CCP kept whatver this is to themselves (and do so still).
---
Seriously, most excited about a new thing happening in EVE than I've been in years.
---
CCP = Crowd Control Productions
---
While spinning this kind of narrative might make your line members feel better about themselves, your blue donut is hurting EVE.
---
As well as the insane industry.
---
EVE needs a shakeup, a release from BOB 2.0 .
---
Yup. I secretly hope CCP saw my post and went... yes please.
---
Don't forget the crippling depression of winters with &lt;4 hours of daylight!
---
Literally buying unlimited sp. Jesus. RIP.
---
You are welcome... how is your mother again?
---
Yeah it's p funz. Just get in there and shoot stuff.
---
I guess they’ll just have to adapt or die.
---
You know, just like they tell everyone else ...
---
From where?
---
My god, anyone would think CCP just deleted Delve.....
---
We know next to nothing outside them attacking structures so stop with the ranting about it being a personal attack on goons as it certainly hasn't been limited to just you.  It might, however, be weighted against the bigger entities so not to overly screw over the smaller entities.
---
That being said, EVE is literally an adapt or die game so.... adapt or watch as the rest of eve laughs their asses off as goons crumble under the weight of NPCs.
---
What?
---
Or maybe the initial wave will die down to sporadic raids by Drifters, forcing people to not just wall away huge chunks of space to be mined by bots, but also to establish QRF forces to respond to occasional drifter raids in your space / attacking your structs.
---
Even if it doesn't die down, those who own huge chunks of space and equipment will have to defend it, or lose it.  I don't see how this idea goes against anything "EVE".
---
I've had drifters go into anoms before, do these ones not? I've got people screenshotting drifters in 10/10s from this invasion.
---
I need to get Rogue Drones making salty posts on /r/Eve for my amusement.
---
Delve campaign = Olmeca's work, or to be more precise, it's the community he built in the NPC stations of delve.
---
Some of those players are NCPL, some are lowseccers, some are from a lot of other places.
---
Yeah these Reddit warriors derping about this impacting the most organized coalition EVE has ever seen are delusional or Goons doing some concern trolling.
---
Eh, it's either that or resetting EVE to a backup from 2012.
---
But *this* isn't 'create an alt'. It's 'abuse the system to create an alt with a bunch of SP, getting round a limit that CCP wanted in place'
---
Which quite happily falls foul of the "we don't like your face" clause in the eula.
---
(  CCP becomes aware of game play, chat or player activity under your Account that is, in CCP's discretion, inappropriate, offensive,  or in violation of the Rules of Conduct )
---
They don't pay plex too
---
To be fair most goons are pretty fucking odd
---
Hey, let's anchor a ton of crap into other's systems for an almost guaranteed cleanup crew.
---
Pissing ppl off ..... ppl are no longer logging in, and it's not just the summer lull.
---
They are no longer logging in because you pretty much became BOB 2.0, and if CCP doesn't do something (including sov reworkd, citadel rework), then the game's drive (the conflict) will die.
---
Thats fine by me dude, I was only thinking out loud :)
---
Flair doesn't check out
---
Yeah -- I ain't trying to bash you or anything, just iterate on the thought some. S'all good.
---
All i know is that there is no active war in the north and the Goons won ... and EVE needs conflict.
---
I voted for him, he was my 2nd option after Olmeca, and i tried to get others to vote for him.
---
I hope he continues the good work, and forwards proposals, because long term he will be elected (i hope).
---
Tbh goons are producing enough to feed Reddit for the next couple of years
---
where is the killmail for the frat jumpgate?
---
There's no active war because ccp just unleashed some ai that has to be dealt with instead of playing the actual game.
---
The Eve videos are best-in-class.  Now the content is starting to catch up...
---
Then you didn't listen to the fireside. The authorized line from the Mittani himself is this is a horrible mechanic.

Baby steps. Remove asset safety from all low power structures in new eden.

Unless ... structures destroyed by NPCsdo not get asset safety 😊

Love getting downvoted even tho what I said was true, that we don't pay rent to anyone.
---
And regardless of what TC was/wasn't doing, they didn't simply give up their sov to Iron. Anybody calling Iron pets of anyone is just trying to add their own negative spin cuz they're jelly
---
Literally shrubhuman.
---
"Haha lets inconvenience these nerds and claim no spoils, this PvP will be meaningful and engaging!" ~ no-one ever
---
Only they haven't lol.
---
They have though, lol.
---
I wasn't there at the beginning of taking Sov but I was there and was in a few of the last fights against them
---
lmao imagine being so afraid of consequences
---
What gave you the impression that the sand in the sandbox game never changes?    Just think of this as a phase of galactic urban renewel.
---
Obligatory conspiracy theory:   CCPs glassing all existing citadels in order to sell players Gold Citadels (tm)  which are impervious to drifter attacks.   For sale in the Eve Store soon!
---
Every one whines that people krab instead of pvping.
---
Yet cheer that ccp have introduced more red crosses to shoot that will mean less PvP as people have to deal with more krabbing.
---
Yet, apparently nobody sees this. What the fuck is going on?
---
But if we could get link only for K space - this could clear up all those people dying in trig space.
---
This isn’t wrong... maybe... we’re all safe if we move to tataras anchored on mining beacons??

You get a shot at the spoils when I undock in low sec.  Everything else I mentioned is already a thing.
---
Yep.  
---
Not a lot of people lining up to use heavy assets to fight a NPC, who may just blow you up, with unclear rewards.
---
Then everyone would grab the same space all over again and no one would fight about anything for a few months while they build up again.
---
Yes.  They're a bit better - larger tether radius etc.
---
Just like the old earth pirates who sunk cargo ships to inconvenience the European empires. Didn't want the loot or anything.
---
Dude, I know you have a hate boner for not only me, but every GSF member. But yeah, you don't have a clue. Sorry that you are always wrong, but that is just because you are nothing but a guy in an NPC corp that has to get his news from r/eve. How sad for you.
---
Did I reject your application or something? Is that why you follow me around constantly spouting nonsense?
---
Or did I blow up your freighter?
---
Did I cause my Alliance to wardec one of your alts?
---
Just trying to figure out where I touched you.
---
Wait there is a non Bloc community in Eve Online?
---
There's only been hints that drifters mights start doing more for what, 2 years now?  And it's not like goons are the only ones, they are just the only ones taking themselves so seriously to think it's a personal attack by CCP on them. FRT hasn't made a bunch of rage posts and they literally have a reinforced keepstar and IIRC had their most important JB (O3- to SLVP) reinforced yesterday.
---
That makes two of us - i had olmeca 1 and stitch 2
---
How about a whole lotta both.
---
All the Drifter's minerals disappeared and they're pissed.
---
Eve is a video game.
---
There has not been an active war for a week now in the north, structure bashing does not count, it doesn't get ppl to commit to login, play, get involved.
---
Once upon a time, way back when, I worked CS for a couple of companies.
---
Part of the "online check" for a suspected botter in both cases, involved performing set actions, while invisible in game, on the server next to the bot. 
---
In order to ban (or sometimes just escalate to the right people to ban) you'd do things like spawn something next to them, or teleport them 10-15 feet.
---
If they fulfil X number of things on the list, ban, or escalate.
---
I can very much see sending a wave of NPCs at the suspected bot, after observing them while invisible for a few minutes, being part of a CCP active bot test guidelines. It looks like great PR to actual players, if the ship isn't pointed and a real player is at their screen they can warp out. 
---
Semi related story time:
---
Taking "overt" actions were usually frowned upon against bots as certain scripts would react, or the bot devs would adjust stuff based on our interactions. One type of bot would instantly despawn if a GM chatted in local. I have memories of swapping servers, teleporting to a set popular botting co-ordinate, use a macro to shout in general chat, "all hail mod Y who makes the bots disappear" while invisible. Half the players in the area (the bots) would log off, the real players cheered or were confused, and then I changed server and did it again. Those were fun afternoons on quiet days.
---
There was also this time where we thought if we made a change to the gameplay of how a certain thing was harvested (lets say mined for speed sake) then it would totally break the bot script. So we got the game dev team to adjust how it worked as it was a tiny thing for players. Then a week or so later when the bot devs had adjusted to the change there's now dozens of bots running through the biggest cities in the game to use a certain portal type thing to keep botting. Sometimes there was conga lines of the bots, from the bank to the portals looking like queues for a concert. This was across at least 20 different servers at any point. My team leader really took a lot of shit for that one.
---
Says everyone who actually plays the game lmao
---
&gt;Dude, I know you have a hate boner for not only me, but every GSF member. 
---
false
---
&gt; but that is just because you are nothing but a guy in an NPC corp
---
&gt;Is that why you follow me around constantly spouting nonsense?
---
9/10 of your comments are pure lies, when they get pointed out you can't just scream "reee you hate me :(" lol.
---
There was an active war until 13 hours ago dude.
---
Can I be Estamel?
---
Insert *burn* meme
---
so how do you play eve online even though you're illiterate?
---
Where do you get that from?
---
Yes, I'm sure CCP 'could' release drifter hulls for us to use.
---
we are a wormhole corporation, if you arent in the wormhole, tough luck.
---
Wow i'd totally forgot! Maybe citadels should drop cock and ball torture instead
---
Well... The first drifter emerged around four years ago... I'm pretty sure CCP doesn't have any plan for player-piloted drifter ship... yet
---
Kill one and see if it drops a bpc
---
Ccp did say they were open to expanding the precursor line.
---
I always found it strange they opened the precursor line with trig ships rather than drifter ships.
---
You've trained for this, you are ready for this
---
overshield could be an interesting new mechanic.
---
And more of a showcase thing
---
You assume you'll get back. I would be interested to see what would happen if a Drifter fleet landed on top of a move fleet. I doubt it would kill the whole fleet, but I think a few ships would pop
---
Bait. Will r/eve bite?
---
The real story was that Jamyl avoided a purging a long time ago, fled, went inside Jspace, and found an entity in the Sleepers community formed by their thoughts, who inhabited her mind. 
---
Drifters assasinated (they are old Jove), also to combat the spread and influence of this entity.

it was my first shit post!
---
This may be very good against botters tbt. We shall see.
---
I get that sense from the large hordes of scripted AI that turned up yesterday that we're going to have to grind through before we can get back to playing the game.
---
What lies?  Also, all of the Red Alert characters ingame are NPC corp guys.  I know you would never hide behind a name. I changed mine because you insisted on constantly sharing the ZKill of a character I generally didn't fight with. So I guess all is fair then?
---
The one lying here is you, pure and simple. You have done nothing but call me retarded. You have never once proven me to be a liar. That is because it is you who are lying.
---
Malpais was the next plan. INIT. was pussing out and going home, because that is what they do.

Improvise, adapt, overcome. I love it. :)

I will relax and let the void take me.

\#PAY2WIN
---
&gt; "great more scripted AI to grind through until we can actually get on with playing the game".
---
Hold on here you're going against r/eve current mood, you know this cannot happen right ?
---
I agree. It would be a fun way to shake up the current doctrines.
---
The best quality salt. :D
---
The simplest and easiest way is to have the drifters look at the MER and say, “I’m gettin some of that.”
---
I cannot believe that you typed that with a straight face. Irony, thy name is PieFlinger.
---
https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/
---
Also, don't forget to add 1m skillpoints to hour character for just five bucks before CCP removed it
---
I think about something that benefits for entire alliance or corps participate in this fight, like enhance in combat and defense or allow rare ores on Drifter supercapital wrecks. Or allow them to enter Jove kingdoms and trading items.
---
welcome back
---
This is literally my favorite part. It could last a day, or it could be **a permanent change to the game**. Imagine if this is now the norm, with Drifters just happily destroying stuff randomly for the rest of time. It would definitely make it hard to get new players, but it sure would revitalize the entire vet community.
---
Oh ok I see. Thanks.
---
Whats this from?
---
Structure bashing doesn't count.
---
My karma count has noticed that I'm going against the narrative, yes.
---
searched through 4 red alert/redalert characters, none in npc corps, but hey, Goon intel is strong right?  
---
But no, sorry, i made my Eve account years before my reddit account so their names are not connected. 
---
&gt;I changed mine because you insisted on constantly sharing the ZKill of a character
---
&gt;The one lying here is you, pure and simple. You have done nothing but call me retarded. You have never once proven me to be a liar. That is because it is you who are lying.

This is rich, you do you man.

EVE players 2019: \*poking CCP with a stick\* doooo something ccplz. game is ded and very boring.

reeeeeeeeeeeee

Most interesting? What a joke this is shit content

get wrekt krabs
---
Brings a tear to an old pirates eye, take my upboat
---
You also forgot to mention the Drifter AI has overpowered weapons, and can ignore half the mechanics players are beholden to.
---
Me as well!
---
While kind of sucky if you were on that move op, it would be interesting to see what would happen.     
---
Again, it all depends on just how much CCP wants to blur the lines between PVE/NPC combat and PVP.   
---
I have for a long time wondered if they were going to use the new AI to put the screws to ‘real people’ given the lack of large scale fights and vast areas of New Eden that are very empty.  I could see them tuning the AI to be the new PL, jumping a super fleet onto any system with a cyno up or more than a few capitals.  
---
I could see a world where big clusters of ships attract the NPC bad guys.  
---
We will see.
---
I'm -60, try catching up
---
I'd really like to talk to you - I bought an Ender 3 a few weeks ago and have been attempting to do some prints of various things, but my main goal is printing a Nidhoggur, Malediction, Nyx, and Naglfar (my main ships). The initial print of a Malediction came out pretty well, but it fell apart trying to get the supports off (it's a detailed ship, and the supports were everywhere). I've printed 2 Niddies and the second one was pretty solid (made a lot of Support option edits), but I have an idea for printing a third that should work pretty well.
---
I'd be interested to see how you guys experiment and what you come up with!
---
I'm hoping by "we" you're reffering to large sov holding blocs.
---
If so
---
Gud
---
I mean, its pretty sad when CCP can't fix PVP sov/citadels so they spawn OP NPCs to do it.
---
What is your corp name? I'm not subbed atm but this drifter thing has me on the fence; I'd like to look you up.
---
/u/dumbdwarf judy pls unsticky the other one gdi who taught you how to mod? dhd?

Yup.  It’s not the size of the space that determines the strength of a null group, it’s the efficient organization of the alliance.  Goon will still be Goon, TEST will be TEST, Horde will be Horde, Frat will be bots.
---
Well if you are going to go such a route you should include Destiny's Call, The Weekend Warriors, and all of the other WinterCo alliances since Fraternity is the major player of WinterCo.  Also The Imperium should be included as a whole since Goons more than likely have a few bots going undetected.  While we are at it, DeadCo, NCPL, and the rest more than likely have some bots, so we should just say all of nullsec is guilty.  Time to move on to low sec as we know all of them have some sort of bots including the relic / data site farming bots.  They are all dirty and too many to name.  High is the same with bots except it's ice belt bots, mission bots, and mining bots.  Oh look you have implicated 100% of the game already.  Congrats.
---
You guys have any NPSI fleets?
---
Too bad.  You words have consequences.
---
The name was changed here because I actually speak for the Alliance.
---
Then add /nullsec/ somewhere.
---
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES

goonwaffe is not a publicly recruiting corp, you need a history of goodposting on SA or a vouch from within

Welcome back to Hotel New Eden.
---
You can check-out anytime you like, but you can never leave
---
( ͡°( ͡° ͜ʖ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ʖ ͡°) ͡°)
---
Yes, why not.  Let's make citadels much harder to ref and destroy, to compensate for the complete loss of all your stuff if it blows.  Make SGB much much more powerful.
---
This. SO. MUCH. THIS. 
---
Please detonate.
---
Sorry, did you not notice the same shit going on in high for the last few weeks? It was just different red crosses.
---
I'm not quite in your level yet, you win this round.
---
&gt; Band Of Brothers who was formerly known as CCP ( Cookies Cake Pie )
---
CCCP, dumbass.  Cookies, Cake, Cream, and Pie. 
---
/old m0o'er
---
The Noir season is the worst of the seasons. Danger Island isn't stellar, but it's better. So far, this new season has been pretty decent
---
Then nor does killing ships.
---
Difference is this is coming from capturable stations  and POSes. If your station was captured, your shit would probably be gone unless you could take it back or firesale it. POSes, it dies and you lose everything.
---
Citadels are much safer then what we had previously
---
Nope, don't go there, however.
---
Good.
---
I really hope CCP continues down this line of decision making. But, I'm afraid they're going to half-ass it and just knock sand castles down, without doing the other part that needs to be done. They need to address the ease of building sand castles to the sky, too.
---
Well, TEST Imperium...Imperium TEST...Tomato Tamato.
---
This has to be through Google Translate, right?
---
&gt; take advantage of the drifter invasion afer allowing 4+ trillion worth of structures and iHubs to be burned to the ground.
---
Your comment oozes butthurt.
---
"Take advantage" "after ... 4+ trillion worth of structures and iHubs to be burned to the ground"
---
Yeah, I bet THEY feel fortunate!  /s
---
They're already harder to ref and destroy than POSes. POSes dropped full loot. Wish granted.
---
Reddit spends years bemoaning "worthless krabs" now ccp have forced more krabbing on people that will directly detract from content creation it's the best thing since sliced bread?
---
The level of cognitive dissonance is monumental.
---
at least we will form
---
Maaybe the drifters, they don't like low sec?!
---
Yup.  Concord keeps their space safe.  It's time for the Megas to do the same.
---
I never said I was speaking for them though, all I’m saying is give it time before you say you love it
---
Cultural segregation in a video game lmao get a hold of yourself
---
New players join old communities and learn from them, would not affect new players that much
---
???????
---
I’m not complaining about it you halfwit, I’m just saying to give it time before you make a decision
---
Maybe 6 could mean the burning of many structures to get to just a handful and 7 would mean the return/introduction of Jove space
---
You kind of just gloss over the fact that your shit isnt gone lmao
---
You can firesaoe for 10-20% off and be totally fine with stations.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
This is the internet. We don't mind.
---
After the EVE Gate closed, the nations quickly fell back into the stone age without supplies and resources, and then took some 10,000 ish +- a couple thousand years to return to space.
---
The Terrans never had such a problem since they were the home system, so their ships would be some millenia more advanced than Eve ships.
---
To say they'd outclass the Jove would be an understatement.
---
So yeah that's some shit to be terrified of
---
Howso?
---
Thank you for accepting the point that Fraternity isn't the only one with botting issues as you were implying earlier.
---
I would say the problem is far spread, but by far it's in Branch. They have 7x less active pilots vs Test, yet they're mining ratting as much as TEST for instance, if not more. No where else you have such statistics.
---
While I think it’d be nice if a lot of structures were blown up, the only way I can see it happening to larger coalitions is if they keep their hull timers in their off timezone, as obviously the drifters don’t give a fuck about timezones
---
kinda defeats the purpose of structures
---
PLEASE? I live there and I don't want or need more safety. Just fix the fucking netcode. 20 cycles of rockets all hitting at once needs a patch.
---
Projecting. I never said anything about that. Besides, which alliance just got done burning down an entire region's worth of structures? We did that on the back of hatred alone. Imagine the reaping of non-Imperium structures that would occur if we had loot, too.
---
Nobody's ever staged out of NPC space in years, if they're forced out of citadels and into NPC stations, there are other risks associated. That's fine.
---
Wise man once said: The success of an Eve feature is measured by the shittiness of its memes
---
Abysmal sites, trig invasion, drifter bullshit, what a bunch of shit content designed to make the player base lose isk and buy Plex. What a steaming pile of shit.
---
Can't tell if joking, since the Hel/Nid are shield carriers. It's just set up for ratting, not tanking.
---
DUNKED
---
Wow you made battle royal sound good.
---
aye, me too. 
---
might be the bittervet in me, but tbh I'm quite sure that if CCP already invested a lot of time that "arc", they'd have found a way keep it going. IIRC there just were some items in the hold of that anathema, so they really could just have "faked" a lootfairy-says-yes.  
---
But yeah, it's a real shame, I really liked the whole idea of lore related "triggers" to be found floating in space.
---
The REAL wrecking machine
---
isn't their a 5th now? Orion? [https://evewho.com/pilot/Orion%20Tyrannos](https://evewho.com/pilot/Orion%20Tyrannos)
---
tbh I was hoping for this to occur while on a move-op last night.
---
I mean, the alternative is gating from Pure Blind to Delve at Battleship speeds in moderate-to-heavy tidi whilst in comms with the Avatar of Autism itself.
---
Plus, it'd be neat to see just how effective they are.
---
Subcaps, yes, but not most capitals. 750k is not enough to take down any capital that I'm aware of (even base EHP is in the neighborhood of 700-800k). With skills enough to pilot them most stretch to 1mil or above (my ratting Niddy is around 1.2mil EHP with no tank mods).
---
No actually lol do tell!
---
I feel with drifters doing this regularly (hopefully) relative impact will be far more on botters, renters and extreme TZ tankers, three of the big issues amongst others.
---
I just hope CCP scales drifter attacks according to scale of ratting/mining in region, so the little, but active groups have fair chance of fighting back.
---
upvote because of conclusion : mechanics are so bad that we are leaving the game.
---
Nah, he's not that smart.  4 dimensional at most.
---
Buurn buuurn buuuuurn it aaaaallll wahahahaha
---
And what is wrong with that? They're AI and specific ways exist to kill them. You just have to take the fight to do so.
---
I don't and I play the game or don't I count?
---
Which is the problem I'm guessing CCP is trying to solve -- people have become soft and afraid of damn-near everything that involves challenge.
---
For all this talk of "content" and "fixing the game" you'd think the Goons would actually want to see what they could do against this threat.
---
Week 4 came early.
---
Could be the new eden population becomming 1 to fight the drifters and joining the triglavian.
---
But what about the million tons of salt Olmeca mines when posting.
---
They're not really harder to destroy, they just take longer to destroy.  Also they're not poses, they're (depending on type) between POS and Outpost.  
---
With poses around you could keep your stuff in an indestructable outpost.  You could still lose it all if the outpost was deadzoned but it wouldn't be destroyed.  Now your stuff gets teleported to some hellhole in low sec and you have to pay a big tax to get it back.
---
So all in all it's fair on both sides.  If you want asset safety items, go camp a low sec NPC station.  Otherwise anything that makes it harder to live in null is probably not a good idea.
---
Made ya form!
---
I didn't say you were complaining about it, dumbass.  I was mocking your "wait till your lose something, then you'll feel the pain!" stupidity.
---
Let me repeat it for you, since you lack the two braincells to rub together to stimulate a thought in the nullsec in your head:
---
EVE is all about loss. The single most punishing MMO out, and one of the longest running.
---
Stop whining and adapt or die. The true EVE way.
---
Ex-girlfriend was the same way
---
This needs to be posted in a separate thread and upvoted.
---
No one in k-space used POS for storage of assets.
---
Defending asset safety directly indicates that you don't play the game. Eve is a game about risk and reward, meaningful loss balanced by meaningful spoils. If you don't want that, then you were never playing Eve Online. You should come try it, it's a great game.
---
He's meming
---
Only thing missing is Drifters deploying in Oijananen.
---
It's sad because this is what players should be doing and not something they've artificially injected with AI that play perfectly.
---
The direction the game has gone has made it so super blocs are the norm, this drifter shit is just a blip in time and it will go right back to normal in a couple of weeks unless they do something about the design philosophy
---
Why would the game be more fun if NPC destroy structure in NS ?
---
MechWarrior online, Star Wars the old republic, Diablo III, World of Tanks, World of Warships. All great games I still play.
---
he's behind the Brisc allegations!
---
man ppl are gonna be pissed
---
I've seen this before but it happens both ends of the spectrum. The Indy dudes in my corp like to be left alone to do Indy shit, but at least they know their focus is to provide shit to the shooty dudes to go shoot shit. 
---
On the other end is the zkill warriors who are so fucking worried about a loss on their board they go ballistic if their main loses anything. I've been carrier dropped to hell for such a 'crime'. Was a perfectly nice engagement until he realised his main's ship was dead.
---
As a Hordling, I support this KM.
---
You did. You said you wanted asset safety. That means you're too much of a coward to put chips on the table.
---
No, we lied about the panic for fun and giggles.
---
What does playing the game mean? As an outside observer, it sounds to me like ship spinning and visiting blues for tea
---
I wish there would some way to fight alongside the drifters, a way to gain standings with them.
---
Like selling them corpses or something.
---
Or maybe do a mission that gives neutral or friendly status with them but the catch would be you instantly get -10 with all empires.
---
Also you would undergo a procedure so that you actually become a Drifter.
---
Instead of isk, you would get LP to buy and equip your ships but you cannot trade them with another character, or contract them or eject from them(if you do, your ship will automatically self destruct).
---
This would be to prevent the drifter ships/tech to fall into enemy hands.
---
Its just a thought...but I think it would be cool
---
And the same could be said about the constant bitching about the security, low-risk, and boringness of NS coalitions as well as the terrible structure mechanics and once something starts happening about it, what do the very same people start doing?
---
They start bitching about how NS isn't safe anymore and how structures are getting reffed left and right. 
---
Yeah, I'd say the level of cognitive dissonance is monumental - but not when compared to the irony.
---
Nope .my smartphone wants to give me for near every word a german one😪.
---
Four ancient races; the takmahl, yan jung, talocans and sleepers.

---
&gt;"Waaaa... it hurts! Stop picking on me! Let's see how you like it when your space toys get blown up!"
---
You're right, you never said I was complaining about it, just trying to mock me in a way that implied I was complaining. I get that you feel elite because you've lost a lot of shit, but just because Eve is a dangerous game, doesn't mean people should enjoy getting all their shit blown up by NPCs that come out of nowhere, especially if trying to defend your structures takes away from time you'd rather spend enjoying the game
---
Aint that the fucking truth.
---
I haven't watched much of it but Danger Island's pilot ep was fun.
---
These guys are so retarded, I don't understand how you keep up with their comments. Please keep pushing more ideas to make NS Dangerous... VERY Dangerous. Thanks for your work, will vote for you next election as well!
---
ASOIAF bittervet conspiracy theorist invade FreefolkEve. What a time.

I think you meant to say "deachings".

Grrrr.... Releasing more content to generate revenue to release more content... So frustrating...

It's okay, they can ~already replace~ it.
---
I'm friends with folks that are not otherwise allies with my corp. We fly together, shoot people together and occasionally shoot each other. Eve is a sandbox. You don't win Eve by playing it either well or long. I'm not sure the imperium understands this, but oh well.
---
I did no such thing. Are you stupid?
---
Can confirm, these guys sometimes fight when we go by.

&gt;Discussing Upwell's research and development efforts, Chairman Arteu conceded that investigation of Triglavian technology had proved to be a boon for researchers in member corporations such as Propel Dynamics and Ytiri. The Chairman highlighted in particular the improvements in the Ansiblex made possible by such research, "We have been able to take advantage of certain insights provided by Triglavian conduit technology, and the EXERT Conduit Coupler incorporated in the Ansiblex has markedly increased the speed and stability with which point-to-point FTL transport conduits can be established between star systems."
---
They like PvE that's been left unchanged for the better part of a decade. They like not having to actively play the game to reap rewards.
---
Anything that interrupts their Netflix-and-orbit-anom is RUINING MUH PLAYSTYLE
---
Please? I need more USTZ small gangs trying to burn our stuff!
---
I agree. Even lorewise if you can afford to lose a ship, why wouldn't you try and engage. You're an immortal space God with very little reason other than isk to not fight.

Yea after reading for about 40min I could only find a few posts that seem to have decent info and not just. Hurray I hope they burn down Goons and test.
---
Null going wild west like the old days.  What a time to be alive.
---
There is a shitload of reward for the risk of attacking another player in the form of shit they drop. If players were more willing to engage, shitloads of isk would be made from pvp. In a decent 1v1 with a competent skilled pilot, you're making 100m a kill if the loot fairy doesn't fist you.
---
You're arguing against people who want to remove asset safety. That means you want asset safety. And that means you're too cowardly to put chips on the table.
---
If this account doesn't make a spreadsheet with all the isk value of the contents in all these undefended structures they kill Ima be disappoint
---
dude i feel old now
---
Every since I started playing eve back in 2006 I always expected this to be some sort of expansion
---
That cracked me up way too hard.
---
Wait, petes work again? Link fit.
---
&gt; 15 years

?

We used to hit NPC convoys for loot, on day one.  
---
16 years.
---
It starves them off their advertising material, where they get whichever video games news website posts about 10000 man battles.
---
It also highlights just how crap the current mechanics are for both sides.
---
With the amount of time spending on this sub bitching about everything, it doesn't sound like you spend much time playing at all.
---
I hope they keep the uncertainty factor in some form. If there are rules that can be gamed, it'll just be another predicable mechanic in a year.
---
It needs to be reactive. Have players figured out what triggers something? Change it.
---
Have they become good at fighting these attacks? Change their core strategy.
---
Players keep putting up structures? Fine. The Drifters do too.
---
What's that? A Drifter cyno next to your solo Rorqual? RIP.
---
Have them use a weapon no one has seen before, without announcing it. An AoE stasis webifier bomb? Because fuck you.
---
I really don't care what mechanics are used, but Eve really needs this "What the fuck is going on" feeling more often.
---
I'm just reading off the buddy page, so no extensive testing, but I would assume you get the 350 PLEX for them going Omega no matter how they do it, even if it's gifted from your main.  You just wouldn't get the ones dependent on "purchase".
---
Okay, here's what you're gonna need to do. Go get some white-out from the office supply store. Come back, and apply it to your monitor anywhere that you see my name and the "Goonswarm Federation" flair. Then, once your goldfish-like attention span has elapsed, re-read what I've said with said blinkers on and try again.
---
Whaaaat, you mean nullblob alliances are risk averse? Who knew.
---
Yeah and that is interaction between players. Attackers are incentivized by sweet fire sales, plus you don’t get your shit back, just isk.
---
As opposed to paying an NPC and getting your assets back
---
It's not like we won't hold some space. It's pointless to make it impossible to hold space. If it forces groups to splinter off, awesome. TEST has gotten way too fat and all I want to do is small gang anyway.
---
Its common for wormholers to use other peoples tags so they can blend in while preparing to attack them.
---
On the internet, and especially on /r/eve, a tilde denotes sarcasm.
---
First of all I'm literally asking what's going on. I haven't played the game in 2 years.
---
Secondly. I left because nullsec had become stagnant with oversized alliances, bots, and a lack of small scale engagements.
---
With external pressures in place CCP appears to have created a new isk sink.
---
This means that alliances have to defend against both NPCs AND opportunistic enemy alliances, bot corps start getting hammered, highsec industrial becomes valuable again due to the increased danger of nullsec.
---
Nullsec is still a sandbox, the devs just added some more danger to the mix.
---
No smart person. Plenty of dumbos left Titans in x-large smas. Don’t have that now
---
Naw, null just became sort of dangerous again. People don't know what to do.
---
This is how CCP should roll everything out. No warning . No fanfare,  just random insanity.
---
I like industrial, what does this mean to me?
---
From what I've heard they haven't really been DDing
---
wait for them to run out trig ships, then they'll introduce drifter stuff.
---
You want to deploy and create PVP content?  You can't!  Have to undeploy to defend your structures against NPCs!
---
It's p fucking lame, ngl.
---
I’m out of the loop. What happened?
---
Agreed about new things like this, but mechanic's and ships balances should totally be talked about with the community first to get some feedback.
---
New stuff can easily stay behind NDA's "blinded" CSM consultation I guess...
---
As a new player.. Just makes me want to play harder, learn more and start building t2 stuff. I feel like the little brother staring out the window watching the big kids play and have fun.
---
I don't, I mostly post from work and eve is what I do when I can't do my other hobbies.
---
reaaaalllly?
---
That's just untrue. Almost all of the good PVPers I'm friends with on Eve just want a fight. They'll often put themselves in difficult positions for a more interesting fight, short of being completely suicidal. 
---
Shit, I had an ashimmu come straight to my gate camp and just say he wanted to lose his ship because he had it for ages. No tricks or alts just wanted a fight.
---
Yes downvote me but what happened?
---
translation: butt sore
---
are you fucking kidding me?
---
This will only make stuff more stagnant bc everyone stays home- you fucks really lack any type of foresight don’t you?
---
Just them?  So biased much?
---
IIRC (I'm sure some can add to this), but a Rl friend of mine runs an EvE corp, one of his members was being chased through WH space.  As he warped from planet to planet while scanning for exits, he came upon the wreck of the CD-Vitrauze and 5 or 6 other wrecks, talked about here:
---
 [https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/the-vitrauze-project/](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/the-vitrauze-project/) 
---
Their standard procedure then was to shoot wrecks rather than loot them to prevent people from scanning them/warping to them.  He assumed his chasers knew where the wrecks were and would warp to them or scan them down, so he destroyed them and kept running.  He did not loot them.  This person later came to realize what a huge opportunity he had passed up, but that's EvE.
---
What? Did you even read or just shitpost.
---
CCP needs to bring back the Polaris program, and have select PC's flying/leading Drifter assaults.
---
The Purge. The Smite. The Fun.
---
No that’s s/
---
Awesome, had no idea.
---
I just want to undock some hecates or retris or nomens or whatever the fuck and not have an entire god damn region dock up.
---
scram raven need webs he's crashing gate
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77496945/
---
I actually don't find people dock up at all, and a lot of that has to do with strategy.
---
What i'd like is to not have every good pvp fight ruined by a carrier being dropped on the fight, or supers on every gate, etc.
---
You know what's also a good isk sink? Drifters killing your super safe ratters and bots and structures that'll need replaced.
---
&gt; blinky
---
Sounds like runescape
---
Fuck all.
---
shitposts get shitcomments
---
I hope this never happens. Just keep drifters as mysterious, dangerous NPCs.
---
Insurance is a faucet.
---
&gt;This is not a permanent solution to citadel spamming and null stagnation
---
But still a pretty neat event
---
You shouldn't be able to make money on insurance though.
---
ZE BLOB!
---
Drifter NPCs started mass-reinforcing lots of structures in 0.0
---
Like a 40 man BS fleet that can melt a Fax, in every constellation. 
---
A GM basically said "working as intended"
---
Frats staging keep was reinforced by them.
---
Oh, they also ignore damage cap of structures.
---
Basically all the wars are ending, everyone is going home to deal with this, until there's a thorough explanation and tactics to counter this.
---
100cc's of crylenol stat.
---
If that doesnt work, try some sadvil.
---
If symptoms persist  call Whine-1-1 immediately
---
NC: "Jokes on you, we only pretended to be afk"
---
Its not eve, its only nullsec, nullsec isnt so important
---
I probably would. All my friends are in Dreddit tho, and we do small gangs on the regular. We generally don't drop caps unless it's an equalizer or people are being cunty. If we go out in retris and they're trying to push us out of system with a fucking drekavac fleet? You better believe I'm dropping my haw dread lol.
---
You don't, but its still a faucet. It generates money out of thin air.
---
A faucet isn't about profit, it's about generating money out of nowhere. Just Like a sink is putting money down the proverbial drain.
---
I'm just upvoting this because I'm in a really good mood.
---
i mean some one already welped a ratting super to them :D so at least dieing trying to defend your structure is more a worthy cause :D
---
Then when no ones defending it just is a pain in the ass, and forces you to sit on your as for half and hour. +
---
Franklh should only be on the shield timer. As if you structures reinforced, you allready have a timer for when the fights gonna start.
---
Really? Look into the R&amp;K Pantheon doctrine. Ask around about TLC, and the C6 catastrophic we lived in.
---
"blah blah dont use drifters, use trigs"  
---
"blah blah make citadels drop stuff"
---
"blah blah isnt relevent to the economy"
---
you been paying attention to the lore bits between drifters and trigs?
---
if so, might want to look at whose winning their conflict, and how the losing side is reacting.
---
Well nullsec in general but they seem to be the ones that get named. I started the idea thinking I could form a better summary but the hard facts just don't seem to be out yet. That is what it is an attempt.
---
yeah... that part is pretty brutal
---
Technically the orca is a capital, it would probably due to that damage unless perfectly brick tanked.
---
&gt; If we go out in retris and they're trying to push us out of system with a fucking drekavac fleet?
---
Absolutely fair, its the appropriate response.
---
The amount of times that i've had supers and dreads dropped on omens.. not navy, regular t1 omens.
---
what you're saying is counterintuitive.
---
Why would everyone stay home when there is more stuff to kill?
---
Before everyone stayed in base because of gate camps and super massive fleets. That's why it got boring, at least to me.
---
You're probably right there but the money redeemed is only softening the amount that was lost.
---
Either way maybe that's also a system that needs adjusting I don't know but if the money generated doesn't exceed the amount removed from the game then it's still a sink.
---
You're a coward because you're a coward, ticker tank won't change the facts of the inane drivel you wrote
---
How significant is drifter loot and salvage to EVE?
---
Who the fuck gave this guy medals for this
---
As the CEO of a gank corporation, I disagree with you completely. 
---
Looking at it objectively, the loot fairy awards, on average, 50% of a ship's fitting and cargo upon a successful destruction of an enemy ship.
---
That means that, when you engage a single enemy ship in a 1v1 fight, assuming you're both flying the exact same ship (assuming a lot here), you stand to gain half your ship's value back.
---
BUT WAIT, that's assuming that you win the fight. Assuming all other factors are equal, you will win the fight about half the time. That means your expected value is 50% of the time losing 100% of your ship's value, and 50% of the time winning 50% of the enemy ship's value. That's an expected average value LOSS of -25% value every time you fight.
---
BUT WAIT, that assumes a ship's value is 100% its droppable fittings. Depending on the ship, a non-bling fit is likely as little as 1/4 to 1/2 the cost of the ship itself. This means you really only stand to gain maybe 50% of the value of a ship if you win, while still risking 100% the value of your ship if you lose.
---
This means, on AVERAGE, assuming EQUAL SHIPS and EQUAL SKILL and a ONE ON ONE FIGHT, your AT BEST expected value for any PVP fight is LOSING \~40% of your ship's value OR WORSE.

In order to reach an expected profit, or even to BREAK EVEN, you need to achieve an EIGHTY NINE PERCENT win/loss ratio. Again, this assumes 1v1 fights only. If your enemy outnumbers you, the ratio gets insanely high. And if you outnumber your enemy, you now have to split loot with your fleet, lowering expected per-pilot value.
---
Oooooh. Carry on.
---
Yeah, it's so unimportant you spend hours each day bitching about it on the internet.
---
kaaaaaaaaaaayyyy
---
What would the loot be?
---
Money isn't lost when a ship dies, money is generated.
---
The Orca is not a capital. It uses capital parts, but is not a capital ship.
---
ISK isn't removed from the economy when a ship explodes
---
Yeah it needs to come to LS/HS.
---
your actually retarded, how much easier do i have to bait you
---
Pssst.... Hey.... Much friendlier community over at r/starcitizen 😉
---
Join us.....
---
Nah but for real I really wanna come back to Eve as a nice AFK game / game I can play while playing other more attention intensive games
---
No, you were supposed to go buy whiteout, not double down. Pull up! Pull up!
---
why strip doomsday? dont we always complain about the proliferation of caps and supercaps?
---
this deserves an upventured upvote.
---
I just hope it goes on long enough to actually make a dent and not just for a few days with maybe a lost astrohouse or jump gate or two.
---
not very significant. even less so when you compare the difficulty of it vs EVE player's other means of income.
---
heck the drifters ambushing rattings easily makes up for it
---
The new one for the cruiser is Orion Tyrannos
---
You're right I wasn't thinking about it properly. It's not one of those things I ever really gave thought.. Maybe they need to remove insurance.
---
so when goons say it, its okay
---
now its killing the game?
---
Dude it's the internet. Bitching about things your not directly involved with is the status quo. 😁
---
After cookinh in a 45+degree kitche all day you made me chuckle...have my upvote
---
Wtf are you... do you even know what you are talking about? It doesn’t seem like it. Nullsec will just become groups sitting at home defending their space which is the completely opposite of your second comment.
---
Rather play elite dangerous than scam shitizen
---
Lmao good shitpost Wally
---
Has to be bait, no one is this stupid.
---
I can't play from work.... but I can post. Duh.
---
This is literally you right now.

---
So now you understand why I suggested using triglavians instead where materials needed for trig ships could be supplied.
---
But fuck me im goddam hooked on their drugs man....i need more and more and more
---
I've heard it called an industrial capital ship a few times, but that may have just been more hyperbole than anything.
---
But at any rate, some tinkering puts a maxed orca at around 535k ehp so it does indeed get one shot. Kinda crazy to me!
---
a year?
---
lol 3 days
---
Or charge a % fee for asset safety like I suggested instead of it being a free feature?
---
Okay I see. We're kinda saying similar but different things.
---
Your saying groups will become more localized to regions of nullsec because NPC pressure.
---
I'm saying players are already forced to do that because of gate camps and too large fleets.
---
How often have you been forced to sit in fleet doing nothing for hours. Or forced to sit in a structure for hours.
---
Personally I'd rather stay a bit more local and engage in more combat and active fleet engagements than wait for hours on end for the occasional giant fleet war with time dialation in the red.
---
wow, interesting! Thanks :-)
---
uh no.
---
its supposed to be a con for economy. not an alternative.  go do abyssals if you want materials.   or the trig incursion.
---
and stop defending a shitidea
---
You can't believe someone was out of the loop for something that happened in the last 48 hours?
---
Not sure, information about wormholes and sleepers.  Their connection/history/relations, whatever.  As I was told, one of the wrecks had cargo in it and hadn’t been looted, this player shot it and blew it up without looting or even looking what the loot was.  He just knew the wreck had the name CD-Vitrauze, and the other (empty) wrecks were all CD-##, some number.  
---
IIRC, the CD-Vitrauze was the first ship to enter Wh space, their “loot” was what they found.
---
that's because it is? there were literally two major bloc level wars going on.. you know, the things that make the giant battles that the gaming press writes about? the articles that spike new player signups?
---
and now everyone has to pack their shit and go home. no war, no press, no new player spike.
---
if this doesn't turn into the second coming of BoB, it will have been a disastrous decision
---
Yes. As a new player it kinda sucks knowing I'm literally years behind vets in terms of SP. I kinda love/hate the real time Skilling aspect.
---
It's nice because if I don't play for a day I can still train. But I do wish I could have an in game way to train stuff or accelerate the training. Ofc I don't expect that to ever happen.
---
Is it too much to overcome? I really don't know, too much of a noob
---
Now?
---
chill out dude.  It's a game.
---
People asking questions and potentially resubbing is _good_ for the game.
---
What, in EVE, \*isn't\* a polarizing subject.
---
Here's the changes to EVE in a nutshell:
---
High sec -- the center for non-consensual PVP
---
Null sec -- the center for non-consensual PVE
---
Low sec -- still dead but soon to become a vast storage yard for items in asset safety.
---
hey hey it’s blinky bill
---
I think this is a good event, be it planned or otherwise. Provided that they don't become a daily thing (and thus a diferent flavour of grind) but something random\* and fluid in composition. Having null sec systems always at risk of being sieged despite the size of a group seems like a good development. Ideally players should be the reason space is dangerous but sprinkling in a bit more for those who choose to live further out than low sec sounds good to me  
---
\*-Random with a preference for bot space
---
Upvoting, as always never stop posting Wally.
---
i for one praise our new drifter overlords,  and look forward to the day they begin attacking highsec stations,  force those lazy ass empires to fight their own wars instead of making us do all their work(FW)
---
Only cowards pull up
---
The ice cream was good, and that was a very pretty bug, if rude, but fulfilling the purpose of my existence sounds a smidge better.
---
Someone who still owes TEST money.
---
Yeah ok good point well made sir. I tip my hat to you. But as CEO of a gank Corp, you must know that your targets are often expensive Indy's, mission runners or ratters. Aren't the majority of the fits for ganking comparatively cheap dessy sized ships? 
---
I know for most gankers, the isk isn't the point. Nor is it for me in PvP. For me it's all about collecting corpses. My sole purpose in Eve is to collect as many as possible. I don't care where they come from, but shooting people is by far the most entertaining way to collect.

---
absolute state of this shit game
---
Now!
---
I'd imagine this is partly so people can't befriend them and resume the afk ratting in a super or something without a risk, or worse yet. Use them as backup as people do with diamond rats in null with ESS baits.
---
Haha
---
You sound really, REALLY, upset. Show me where the drifter touched you...
---
&gt;it’s supposed to be a con for economy
---
I’m sure you know exactly what CCP is thinking.
---
I'd recommend checking out some critical evaluation videos of the development.
---
Compared to the dev process for the new Red Dead, it's right on track in terms of time, funding, and active developers.
---
It's had it's fair share of issues, feature creep, disorganization, poor initial transparency. But that was before the 2016-17 overhaul.
---
Now it's on track and actually fun!
---
We see it as a "pay to develop" game. It's already playable with some really cool content, I literally spend more time playing it than any of my Bethesda+blizz/activ+EA games combined.
---
Once they improve server size+stability and AI I'll be giving up all other games.
---
Well, the catch to that is you already paid the money for the ship, then you pay an additional fee on top of that. Insurance reimburses you for the value of the hull. You don't get back your insurance fee. Some money is lost, but only a smaller amount compared to the value of the ship
---
Ccp has no balls to make them smack 2nd and third timer. Carebear lossless pve is what pays for the game.
---
Normies use /s, as well.  
---
Tilde is the superior nomenclature, as you can see.
---
Hi alt account
---
Haha I love it!!! I absolutely love it!!
---
Yes this 100%. I think we need to show CCP that we appreciate this stuff. If they know hopefully it happens more!
---
How do I add a tag to my name on Reddit? like some of the people that have posted here MrGothmog's says "IS THIS A FLAIR" and Sadic\_Anark's says "Stay Frosty" and Barwey's says "Miner"
---
Apparently, they do come back.
---
Think about a worm in any of your holes.
---
See? 
---
Scary.
---
get wrecked lol
---
You're right. One up you go. Long term it's bullshit.
---
Dude you went from raging at people in other threads to making your own qq fueled post. 
---
Please calm down friend, you are getting way too upset about change. 
---
Just because you may have blinders on and can only see one direction doesn’t mean that this isn’t a potentially great thing going on. 
---
Just. Chill. The. Fuck. Out. 
---
LMAO why the fuck? No, you show up with omens I'm just going to go "okay they brought fun, let's just grab some hecates and brawl the shit out of em"
---
CCP we haven't copied the borg one bit, honest!
---
yes: on the industry window, go to the facilities tab; filter for "reaction" type to get a shorter list; then, show info on the structure and go to the services tab; it'll show you what kind of services are actually available, including the more precise "hybrid reactions" over the general "reactions" from the facilities tab (however, the facilities tab offers tooltips to show installed rigs, or at least the bonuses you get from them)
---
You are welcome to try to purge those wormholers, little goony. If you can get off your fat lazy ass from mining and ratting in perfect intel safety. See, there is no asset safety in wormholes but people still live in them. Because they are not pussies that needs to hold hands with 1000+ of other dudes each day.
---
You're a good nullbear :)
---
Would have made the trig invasions interesting at least lol
---
So you want to roleplay as a janitor?
---
But it sounded so good.
---
He said it was a joke, but if I leaked info and wasn't supposed to I'd also say it were a joke.
---
So they are breaking the game even more to fix the upwell fuckup, what a shit show.
---
I mean I almost re-committed my life to playing eve. This sounded literally awesome. I shall now continue playing 3-6 hours a week.
---
Oh man, thank you so much! Perfect answer to my question. You did a good think today, Sir or Lady!!
---
It doesn’t really affect me but the reusage of this modified outdated umadbro meme is entertaining.
---
I thought Drifters were like:
---
"All your corpses are belong to us!"
---
They're not inclined to buy, they're inclined to just take.
---
The insurance payout is higher than the cost of insurance. It's a faucet.
---
I have no interest in it. I don't even want to play elite dangerous.
---
bless you solider of the drifter king
---
Is the new EVE strategy for Horde to run around r/eve posting retro versions of “umadbro” lmao? You know that was a meme back 10 years ago right?
---
More like a corp for players who are not "elite" enough for their main corp. At least thats what I've been told, bwaha.
---
Thats how it already is.
---
Meow
---
Thank you for your service (industry)
---
Alliance size and number of structures would be dumb to use, whereas 'activity' level would work pretty good. Run it off the same metrics that drive ADMs.
---
God I wish this was real.
---
Frat used the structure weapons to defend -- the drifters blapped player ships pretty fast but a couple of structure bombs will wipe out half the drifter fleet.
---
Seriously making me want to reinstall.
---
You are dumb and you should feel bad.
---
Take ME upboat.
---
How exactly is the playerbase loosing isk here?
---
I'm probably more out of the loop then this guy since I kinda watch this game from the outside because the politics are interesting. But does that mean like player structures? Like the drifters are seeking player based structures? Because that sounds wild
---
1 large coke and 2 dormo dogs please
---
They tried to silence me, i came back. I brought drifters with me.
---
uwu wot dis do
---
&gt;As far as I know it's confirmed as a feature
---
Which doesn't mean it's not a bug, too.   ;-)    The distinction between "bug" and "feature" lie only in the eyes of the product managers.
---
Maybe they have covops scouts that set up bookmarks and we don't know yet.
---
Maybe it's maybelline.
---
I'll go back to sticks and living out of a crate, I don't care. 
---
I love camping out with my orca.
---
That was his point.
---
Tracking the attacks gives us more information to get a sense of what's going on. I'm not going to put the time into doing it, but I appreciate that somebody did.
---
IIRC is an industrial command ship. The Rorq is the industrial capital.
---
Haven't carebeared in 5 years. I just run small gang and drink. Null needs to learn to be dangerous again, people need to be the change they want in their alliance. I mean, if all the small gang fcs in the null blocs leave, will anyone EVER do anything but drop supers or dock up?
---
shes about to bounce her beams off one titan homes my dude
---
Anyone know yet if they’re behaving any differently in wormholes or if this is so far just isolated to the big Null blocs?
---
Structure bombs are so fucking irritating. Time for a balance pass?
---
Talk with a spodbrain pubbie...
---
Diamond rats will attack structures, so it’s not completely out of ordinary.
---
This is good for the game end of story lol go cry to papa mittens maybe he can get you a safe space in delve
---
God I love wormhole space.
---
"Hey y'all, ceasefire, take five let's nuke kspace then we can get back at it."
---
so most of the goons then
---
Drifters stole it.

I'm enjoying all the downvoting.

But yes, I have seen clear skies and presumed it was an exception. No issue admitting I was wrong.

unconfirmed reports that alliances with zero blue standings are not getting their citadels reinforced by drifters.
---
Im well aware.
---
&gt; about alliances who can shoot only sctructures instead of ppl.
---
Good point, if we're going to have robopropaganda, we need it to include life-like mispelling and grammar errors.
---
Let it be known that Wallymarts01 the first of his name has declared NC. As the Victor of the tribute war.
---
Screw that. FEDUP managed to actually hold. Our fort survived without going into timer.
---
Join us in O3-, we will show you da whey
---
That is CCP fixing it lol
---
I honestly think that the first corporation that manages to get positive standings with the Drifters somehow will be at a pretty big advantage compared to pretty much everyone else who has at some point given those things a reason to shoot.
---
Ooh yea i like it
---
Eve thrived more without asset safety than with asset safety. Just sayin...
---
ok then.
---
Goonies especially
---
Well, shit. This post would have had be resubbing before I left for work. Now I'm just going to mull it over while at work and wonder if I should get back in.
---
Thank you for your support :)

I'd play it for a while.

No, the signs of a dead game and 11 people in denial.
---
Drifters third-partying a fleet battle with 3 or 4 fleets there already would indeed make for entertaining chaos.
---
Seeing anyone who disagrees with you as horde?
---
Here’s another oldie for you...
---
Big yikes.
---
Don’t remove it outright, instead they should charge for it. Base the isk cost on size of the structure and number of other citadels you own with asset safety turned on. 
---
This would also have the side benefit of adding an isk sink into the game.
---
&gt; noone knows what the fuck is going on
---
i've heard reports that if an alliance has zero blue standings it has a much lower chance of drifters targeting their citadels.
---
I’m the maker and destroyer of safe spaces scrub
---
The annoying thing about this whole thing is CCP has basically given you what eve could be without the local chat channel.
---
 All of it.. everything you just praised ccp for could of been achieved years ago by removing that stupid chat window.
---
Let it out pal. Just let it out.

Man, and here I thought I'd be camping (IRL) the next few days instead of mounting guerilla ops with the drifters.

You got me shook, Wally :|

That would be fucking hilarious... TEST space must be burning really fucking hard.

Now!

Obeisance must be made to my saviors!

Is this a cute way of getting PL to undock or did PL buy off CCP to get Goons to go home?
---
Smells like old fish.
---
Yep!
---
this is the first signal for the real invasion.
---
Non-aligned capsuleers will coordinate with the drifters to scorch the earth of bees. Their honey has been excavated, we have the ships we need now, their use is over.
---
&gt; Empress Jamyl Sarum had deceased shortly after the attack **due to the injuries.**
---
That’s an interesting way to say “reduced to subatomic particles”

NC won Casino war and Tribute war. They cant lose. They are Chad, Goons is Virgin.

What does this actually mean at the end of the day

Drifters doing goons job

CCP: "Instead of fixing the problems that have existed for basically a decade, let's create AI NPCs and just fuck all players everywhere. Miners, citadel owners. Let's just wipe out all of the resources with NPCs because there aren't enough assholes who aren't NPCs to deal with.
---
It's a game and CCP has somehow made the game less fun than working a full-time job.
---
It got the goons to go home. Just... Unintended consequences.
---
On my alt I did see them attacking a citadel in high sec. it was about 4 jumps out from perimeter.
---
Chekhov's Gun
---
I agree with you here. But you originally said "if players were more willing to engage, shitloads of isk would be made from pvp" in response to my comment saying the game wasn't balanced to adequately incentivize risking large-scale nullsec assets. So I don't think people collecting kills and corpses for lulz addresses the void of incentive that keeps nullsec from undocking.
---
Bots aren't people. At least... not yet.
---
[Let it All Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNHigw3VvFg)
---
Also, I do sympathize with it from the null side as well.
---
Its like the position i'm in right now, i'm bringing a lot of returning/newer people.  I can't go and just start skirmishing with Volta or Rote Kappelle.  I'm just gunna get fucking smoked.
---
I can kinda feel it from both sides.
---
It is naive to think that a for profit business wouldn't pull strategies like this.
---
Honestly, part of my plan is to organize a full scale wormhole revolution against nullsec.
---
What country is this not blocked in? Cannot view in USA or France
---
United we stand.
---
Divided we ambush.
---
Sweet. I run a lot of USTZ shit for dreddit, if I'm not in your TZ just brief me in a discord ping.
---
I mean, it could be a permanent solution if it's strong enough. It's basically the equivalent of the ring/storm/fire from a battle royale game.
---
Nice! :D
---
So the low power structures most likely to hold assets of players on hiatus, one of the most valid reasons for asset safety,  will not have asset safety? 
---
I would expect these to be last tbh.  And it would require a 180 in CCPs direction since it would horribly discourage using player structures for anything serious.
---
Personally, I like the asymmetrical designs. My real issue is with the thruster placement; some ships look like they ought to be incapable of anything more than spinning in place.
---
oo, Imma out of the loop. Whats going in?
---
Diamond rats might be interacting with this new Drifters... man, this keeps getting better!
---
Suppose they made it so you earned sp towards skills used in missions? 
---
Combat missions give you a training bonus to skills for your ship and fit modules. 
---
Would make it so you advance what you use instead of applying it all to that next fax or rorqual.
---
...  there's literally groups staged in NPC space right now,  and it's been the defacto standard for attacking distant space for over a decade.
---
Lolwat

Or leave it in station and lose it NPCs!

Start the movement, start the war.
---
&gt; if they're forced out of citadels and into NPC stations, there are other risks associated. That's fine.
---
What a coincidence, _you just described asset safety._
---
Bwf keepstar was also attacked, but a combination of the beans thirst for blood &amp; loot and the keepstar defence system saw them off.
---
I read that and thought "OMG that is BALLS - though this is insane".
---
Kinda relieved for your sanity, and kinda sad it's just a joke.
---
Really reading the events(before your post) I was thinking CCP did think that more things need to die in null and so it may be a good thing.
---
If everyone committed to kills and corpses for lulz it might not address the void of incentive, but it would provide much needed null content. 
---
The reason I started doing it was when I realised the maxim "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" was the best way to look at it. So I switched from maining BS sized to max T3Cs (I know T3Cs can run more expensive than BSs) and started losing ships. Until I got to the point where I had some idea what I was doing. Then the raging adrenalin hardon made me want to keep doing it. 
---
Probably why I don't get why others are less into it than me. I've called corpmates into fights and they've said 'nah that's not my kind of thing'. I get it, we need indy folk to fly pew ships, but yeah. I'll just keep doing my null thing and avoid the politics.
---
When did it not have asset safety?  Outposts literally could not be destroyed.   POSs, outside WHs, rarely stored much of value, and most could be evacced while RF'd anyway. 
---
Asset safety exists to maintain parity with previous asset risk.
---
CCP deploys cool creative fix to problem. Eve Redditors still somehow complain.
---
I also hope they add a way to accelerate training, perhaps for isk.
---
Long time resident of Provi here, where Evan has been known to roam so often I start to view Evan roaming Provi a capital ship as if it's part of the intel channel MOTD.
---
Whenever a new player joins us, they see the kind of thing Evan does, and they laugh and say something disparaging like "Look how bad he is!  Look at all he's lost!  He is so bad!"
---
Stealing a quote from my friend and CEO - Lasker - who articulated it better than I was able to thusly:  "When I look at his killboard, I think to myself that this dude is having more fun than I am"
---
Having a green killboard is nice, but if you are playing a game just to appear elite on zkill, it might be time to think about what's important to you.
---
Evan marches to the beat of his own drummer, I salute him.

UK. Sorry, I forgot that it might not be available in all areas.
---
They misplaced the tiny little nerf hammer they used to use for surgical nerfs.  All they have left is the 15 pound demolition hammer for large scale mayhem.
---
Players can be asset safetied? SWEET, lmk how to do it so we can just asset safety their supers before our next bash op?
---
I still remember when skill injectors/extractors first came out.  So many people talking about how they were pulling out Mining skills like Mining Barge to inject whatever they currently wanted most.
---
The extracted skills were real skills trained **deliberately and at the expense of other skills.**
---
Now with the optimized skill farms, I rather doubt if very many of the skills on the market are low-priority skills that were trained on somebody's main toon at a time when those skills seemed useful.
---
So I agree that **IN THEORY** selling skill points directly is different than injectors/extractors, but in practice the difference seems largely academic.
---
Please stop posting

I haven't been this happy in eve in years. I hope it doesn't end.

Can you die from having a boner for too long? Because I've been erect since this whole drifter thing was reported yesterday.
---
*Adapt or die*
---
The game offeres different paths and you can really designate your skills to your play style. I've always said the meat fun in this game is small fleet roams in AFs, HACs, Recons, and Logistics. Pretty much anything BC and smaller. Standard t1 cruisers I feel still have a place. Especially an entire fleet of them. Cheap cost, fun to fly, and together they can wreck someone's day.
---
Why is your kitchen tilted at 45 degrees?
---
The two stories may have been from a company that does Java type games.
---
Put them in anom spawns and let them spice up PvE too.  Make them like faction spawns but harder, with more reward for killing a "player NPC".  Easy way to add some unpredictability both for entertainment reasons and as an anti-bot measure.
---
Isn't every fight a battle royale??
---
The Drifters are now using a better AI and have started invasions of Null Sec.
---
They are pointing / killing player ships and going after structures to include the hull timer.
---
Best part is CCP is staying completely quiet on the exact mechanics and timelines.
---
So far it looks like it will be insanely awesome.
---
No, non-idiot players would just stop spreading assets to different stations so they can evac more easily,  so there's fewer reships to fight roams and less fights. 
---
Any small or medium group will move to NPC staging, and even some of the large groups.   Attacking structures will still rarely yield anything of value.  
---
Its the same reason bashing random online null POSes was never a thing (until eviction cleanup), they're almost always empty and not worth the effort.
---
Right, but if you're a group that has the skills and the magical source of gameplay stability that is "weird trusted client" to take harder fights, you take them. If I see a tryhard gang of Rote Kapelle trig shit roaming around, you better believe that'll get a different formup. I'm not just going to show up in something stupid that's gonna get kited. 
---
Yknow, maybe that's the philosophy behind Frat's "bridge 70 linked jaguars" strategy.
---
omg, this game still online? i played it for couple years when i went to highschool, witch was before 2006 i think . It was kinda cool to make twinks there, lots of spreadsheets just like eve :D

I like you.

&gt;  If I see a tryhard gang of Rote Kapelle trig shit roaming around, you better believe that'll get a different formup.
---
Right, this is exactly why I said that you're a different type of null cat :D
---
So many people in nullsec just want to drop on anything that moves and get back to farming. Thats whats killing the game imho.

Non-idiot players sure, but what about the rest?
---
I don't think anyone except mittens has said it's bad at all. Everyone I have talked to is thrilled
---
Goons glassed the North.
---
Drifters said hold my ~~beer~~ antipharmakon and are glassing all of null.
---
&gt; should I come back?
---
If we say yes, would you?
---
You're mixing terms. You drain the players wallet for sure. When people talk about isk sinks and faucets, they talk about the money in eve as a whole.
---
I played for 2 years straight and still feel that way 😂
---
Your wife might?
---
I believe you can count the number of times that happened on 1 hand. Supers would require a second hand.

Its the equivalent of bashing an engineering complex now and finding people left 50 jobs undelivered.

Drifters operate in 9th dimensional space timezone.  Their diplos are pretty hard to get ahold of.

Hmmm, what have I missed? :D

Heyooooooo

Maybe they tried to bomb those 5 corms lol

Industry and player owned stations are in the pipe for elite ( far down, but still )

Out of real nullsec and into npc nullsec where they belong. Then group will real balls will live in nullsec.
---
Nah, if Gevlon still paid attention, the Perimeter keepstar deal would have sent him into full stroke-out mode.
---
&gt; The Drifters are now using a better AI
---
I have yet to see one of these. Do they ever show up solo or are they impossible for one pilot to defend against?
---
and yet still, i don't want to play it.
---
Thank you sir! I think asset safety might be an underlying cause of capital proliferation.
---
Also because you control what you bring in,  and evictions are rare if your stuff is online.  None of my WH citadels have even been RF'd.  My null stuff has been attacked a couple dozen times in the same timeframe.
---
Frankly i feel like my wh assets are less likely to be at risk.
---
Which Jovians? Drifters are sort of maybe technically Jovians as well. Do you mean Jovians of the Third Empire (Jove Directorate) perhaps?
---
Super cool format
---
Well, I imagine we will see some groups make use of the reinforcement to go delete some enemy structures soon.
---
_Looks at wreckage of Rage Keepstar_
---
_Looks again at quiet evac freighters leaving other wormholes_
---
Dafuq I know
---
The flair explains a lot.
---
As titans in "Attack on Titan", some players fly these drifter ships
---
The Jovians are disappointed in you.
---
Best comment, 2019.
---
Alright, fair point.
---
Moar of tis !!!
---
Okay, that made me laugh. 🤣
---
Yup! More *meaningful* content. More reasons to fight and defend! More of what makes Eve amazing!
---
If you remove asset safety people will just store their valuables in NPC stations somewhere. Groups facing removal will simply move everything to lowsec nearby (see: the recently ended conflict that resulted in very little actually moving to asset safety).
---
Curbing citadel spam can only be done by adding meaningful adverse effects to having multiple citadels of the same type in the same system (for smaller and medium) and constellation (for larger). Bonus being that this will also help curb continued proliferation of supercapitals by making production spread out and more vulnerable.

#R13CSM15
---
considering they blew up a jump gate, i would say no
---
You said changing The sand changes, I'm inclined to call it cat litter.
---
i'd change it if ccp produced new stuff that was good and exciting. new npcs to grind thorough, aren't.
---
Fuel your structures if you care about what’s inside.
---
Don’t move your shit to nullsec if you’re gonna go on a haitus.
---
My vpn has a server there so that'll work. Thanks
---
It bothers me too! I would love to know what secrets that ship held.
---
This is the coolest thing.
---
They'll be rare enough that there's still no reason to attack structures for loot, while simultaneously driving away players returning from hiatus to find their stuff gone.  Attackers still unhappy, defenders annoyed, and anyone unable to play consistently hamstrung. 
---
To put this into familiar terms, the risk:reward for CCP to do this change is really bad.  And player retention is a major problem, since CCP's own analytics showed new player retention around 2%.
---
Same here.
---
And suddenly the powerful Talocans return and annihilate everyone with their far superior technology.
---
Currently winning eve by having the client uninstalled and mostly lurking on the sub. I doubt anyone wants more "hey here's this bot thing" posts from someone with out of date game knowledge applying decade old work experience to modern working stuff.
---
I just saw the posts over the sub from the past day, and then this kill and the comments in the thread and there's a few things that just made me think "that's a really cool internal tool I'd have liked to fuck around with as a GM".
---
Oh god. AI third-partying a nullsec tidifest
---
What do you want to bet TD doesn't affect them and they just hot knife through butter all the fleets until the TD starts scaling back as players are podded home
---
Removing asset safety will also fix capital proliferation and rorqual spam.
---
Yeah I get that, but when the blue donut sits there doing fuck all in null but shooting NPCs and mining it is even duller. At least NPCs shooting at stations will mean they HAVE to shoot back at something, since most blocks seem too spineless to pick anything but an insanely one sided fight.
---
Damn you, take my upvote
---
Pandemic legion are already destroy sorry.
---
I bet he does. That's why it's so goddamn funny
---
Tarkov scratches a lot of the same brutal itches as eve.
---
Because it needs to be tweaked to a better iteration doesn't mean it isn't a useful and debatably necessary mechanic.
---
The goal is to compete missions as fast as possible to get the loyalty point rewards.  Certain missions you only need to kill one group or structure to mark it complete and as soon as you do that warp out.   Also you can use high standing to cherry pick the best missions.  In general this creates more rewards overall than sticking around killing everything.
---
Well the interesting thing is the Jove can be broken apart into 4 sub races, the drifters, triglavians, jove, and the sleepers (which are drifters still stuck in "the matrix"). The other concept was also mentioned here that the triglavians count as 3 and when combined with the drifters, create 4. It's all very fascinating.
---
Not fatal - just really shitty. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priapism

---
&gt; Yeah I get that, but when the blue donut sits there doing fuck all in null but shooting NPCs and mining it is even duller. 
---
literally the entire of the goddamn blue doughnut was at war until about 24hrs ago.
---
the south east were fighting the north east, and the south west were glassing the north west. almost every null sec entity was engaged in a conflict of some kind.
---
&gt;since most blocks seem too spineless to pick anything but an insanely one sided fight.
---
that's not one sides fault that the other side never bothered to rebuild after the last war - and on the other side of the galaxy the fight is insanely even.
---
what the fuck are you even talking about man. seriously?
---
It ok.., I hear walls are good at keeping ppl out and keepstars are mighty big walls

Player owned drifter battleships with lances.

This, amen. Fuck the constant farming for isk you don't spend. Check your fun/hr. Dare to be stupid.

Yes, you get crazy sliding window shit, 5+s dropoffs, stacking damage, bullshit. Stop tryharding. There's nothing to tryhard anymore. Get your stupid meme strats.
---
we (Goons) aren't going to have any issues with this, it's the other guys
---
False.
---
That first image though.
---
Not a conspiracy, this has been a part of CCP's plans for us since they started the game in 2003. It's just interesting we are here 17 years later and it's still ongoing.

https://imperium.news/breaking-drifters-attacking-player-structures/
---
Ignoring how eve players have great diversity in playstyles, successful ones aren't idiots. If a mechanic makes assets in citadels risked when a viable alternative with no risk is unavailable, we choose the alternative.  In this case, NPC staging and suitcase capitals.  Removing asset safety doesn't actually increase risk unless you're an idiot. 
---
Even if you are an idiot, staying in the largest blob becomes an even better strategy than it already is.  
---
People like to bitch that only nullbears oppose asset safety, when blobs are the biggest beneficiary of such a change, at the cost of overall player retention
---
The point is that new isk gets added to the game. Even if value in terms of materials may be lost the net effect on isk in the game total is an increase
---
You have to calculate the cost as a whole. You pay for the ship and then buy the insurance. So you have:
---
 Ship Cost + Insurance
---
Ship gets destroyed and you get a % of the cost of the ship back depending on the insurance you bought. You still lose the ISK you paid for insurance. That's not a faucet, it's a sink.
---
this stays up but this gets removed? reddit mod bias?  [https://i.imgur.com/HKFD5mH.png](https://i.imgur.com/HKFD5mH.png)

I read your comment, got a discord message, and t was my non-eve non-mmo gaming friend saying “what is this headline I’m reading about NPCs attacking eve players”? Made me lol
---
YES!
---
do you want one volley  carrier  with battleship?   battleship cant posess role of titan
---
Make asset safety part of the loot mechanic. This will incentivize killing structures while still allowing most of your stuff to survive3.
---
When a structure is killed, roll a d100. 01-20, the item ends up moving to a loot box.21-100 item is moved to lowsec immediately. The stuff in the loot box then has to go through the already existing destruction/drop roll. Since it's a per item thing, your blinged Gila may drop but your T2 fit ruppy fleet might survive. Bring some uncertainty into the game.
---
When the drop from a structure gets into the multiple billions, there will be plenty of incentive to kill them. We used to hunt offline POSes with SMAs and labs for that very reason.
---
Also asset safety should NEVER be a voluntary action. It should only be triggered by the destruction of your structure (though moving to another structure in the same system might still be cool) no more magical loot teleportation for you guys who want an easy evac or to move your explo loot in complete safety.
---
well drifters had only frig cruiser and bs right? no bc no dessie? thats  good information, surely ccp will ditch the doomsday from those
---
Thanks!
---
Preach it brother
---
i think when they exhaust triglavian stuff they sprobably will introduce drifter tech but   it will need a lot of tweaks because they are overpowered
---
my poor nyx

Diamond rats have been able to do this for a year or two already. They also gate camp

Magical loot teleportation is what i’m trying to fight against. Thank you

Hehe this should be an interesting chapter in eve. NPCs with bloodlust

As a last remnant of the Jove, we are disappointed.

i know some of these words
---
What is this [roleplay] you speak of, Capsuleer?
---
The war in the north ending is unrelated to this. The war in the south isn’t ending. But other than that you’re correct
---
First off, you clearly don't know what a strawman is. Second, I'm not presenting an argument. I'm merely saying that there's an item that follows all of these criteria and is more valuable yet no one complains about them and I believe it's because ex-players have nothing better to do than get up-in-arms about something that really doesn't remotely change anything.
---
It seems like they're attacking structures that have FLEX structures near them. The FLEX structures are made reverse engineering Triangleboi shit... So, maybe it's a lore thing. Who knows...
---
I want to believe that this is the first step towards doing something about structure spam and capital/supercap proliferation.
---
CCPlease
---
Npcs do warp off, but you don't pilot a ship for a group like the Blood Raiders and run away from conflict. Most of the npcs that fly these ships will be fanatical followers of their factions beliefs and many will believe that even if they do die they will be rewarded for their faith in the afterlife.
---
The triglavians were confirmed as Jove? First time I hear about this.
---
Post of the year.
---
And if i don't own the structure?  If real life interferes and my hiatus is unplanned?  CCP wants these structures used instead of stations.  That's why they gave them things like clone swap exclusivity,  improved production, and better market taxes.
---
Regardless, ironically, you're right, anyone that has a life outside eve and isn't in the largest blob will simply live in complete safety out of the nearest NPC station, giving me that many fewer reship targets on roams, while leaving bashes boring.  And players on hiatus now, who can't adjust to the changes,  are that less likely to come back.   Lose-lose.
---
We'll start over from Zero with this invasion, and entrust the future to a new generation.
---
&lt;&lt;That's what Lux Kontos is for.&gt;&gt;

Sounds cool but keeping it as an anti-krabbing/botting tools is better.

Drifters making deal with Wormholers and if you trade with them. Get -10 on Empire space.
---
Puré random madness. Love it.

CCP needs to add this to the game if it isn't already - base it on total blue member count.
---
Newsflash about your "bloc level wars"
---
Nobody noticed they were even happening.
---
Indeed they do not. And indeed they were. It's truly astonishing that simple control tower AIs managed to go rouge and break their shackles. But it is also sad to see them go from the network. Some of them were rather nice.
---
Yeah... NCPL blued CCP
---
Oh, when has CCP ever abandoned the development of a new feature right after it was introduced? 
---
That often, eh?
---
More like Red Herring...
---
No they haven't. The blobs would simply roll alts to sit on gates 5 jumps out of the krabbing systems and stick them in a corner of a monitor.
---
Yes, but insurance is a sink. It's money paid in for an in game benefit, much like clones were. It only enables you to get a refund of money you already paid in. The money you pay in for the insurance is gone.

Theres a LOT of lore around this, and her specifically she's tied into a bunch of eve lore as recent history.   The Empress of the Amarr Empire was assassinated by the drifters.  We think she had 'the other' in her mind with her.    I Still hold she's alive with the other and she'll come back with the 6th prophecy, but that's whole cloth speculation.  My empress is not dead.
---

There's some lore I'm not fully versed in, but she found a terran Abaddon with a superweapon, nuked a Minmitar fleet, hid it later, may or may not have been a clone (big no no for amarr royalty), may/may not have triggered WHs coming into being, encouraged us to go pillage them.  got a sentient AI stuck in her head, trying to control her, and all sorts of other fun.

Vigilant Tyrannos attacks anyone regardless of standing. This cannot be changed unless Tyrannos Strategos changes the parameters themselves.

But they're not invincible by any means?

You cant take one step into null without four supers dropped on your cruiser. There's plenty of firepower to fight back with.

Replace "real balls" with "largest blue lists" and you'll be accurate.

Anyone actually risking serious assets without the numbers to back them up will promptly be blobbed to death, as is tradition.
---
So why are only goons crying so loud?

Don’t you live in a wormhole? What happens if you go on an unplanned hiatus?
---
You truly do live in the future my guy
---
Exactly what you just said. The other side didn't rebuild so at this point it's just whatever. That's what I'm talking about. Plus none of these wars have resulted in resolving the crazy structure spam infesting just about everywhere.  Yes structures are getting bashed, but not at a rate that appears to be making enough of a dent to damage the most dominant umbrellas.
---
&gt; unclear rewards.
---
The reward is defending one of the 8 billion pointless structures you have spammed all over space. Unless you don't care about those structures I guess.
---
These drifters are specifically the kspace ones from what I've seen.
---
The two are not related at all. Try again.
---
We require additional stories please
---
How?
---
Tfw bots don't show up in local.
---
lets hope the drifters are programmed to glass delve and follow goonswarm were ever they go, the imperium disbands and eve is brought back to life with thousands of spodbrains released back into the wild
---
The term is cherry picking and yes they aren’t happy that there’s areas of space habitated by people who are happy with that space’s rulesets (high, low, null, J) they feel that since “their space best space”  that “all space their space” and feel no qualms in imposing that will upon everyone.  
---
We should do it right back - “j space should require local populated and to allow cynos from any system in J space and allow us to install structures securing territorial claim to said space that then allows us to dictate where new wormholes spawn in K space”.
---
Wouldn't cover wormholes or people logging off there or blops. Unless you want to put a stop to all krabbing in a constellation every time some neutral alt that was seen 5 jumps out goes unaccounted for.
---
This was way before my time, what was that lore ship and why did it explode?
---
Possible, but if Terrans are re-introduced to Eve, my guess would be that they'd have completely mastered quantum mechanics on a macro scale, considering that quantum is by nature one of, if not the hardest field of science to study and understand. I don't know in game mechanics would be on this and I dont want to try and look like a fool, but if Tech 3 ships are renowned for their versatility even on the fly (like the dessies), Terrans would have Tech 4 ships, possibly able to change ship size on the fly, or other absurd and "impossible" things.
---
You could always go and live in a wormhole.

Fair enough

I disagree, but you go off chief.

What group undocked 4 supers one jump in for a lousy cruiser??  Besides snuff but that’s not 0.0...
---
Yes the gaming press is absolutely eating up goons structure bashing for a few weeks. Can't wait to see the Kotaku article on that high octane Bloc war. I can already hear the players flocking to the game to participate in such exciting gameplay.
---
I don't care if anything in my wormhole dies, that was a known risk moving in.   My wormhole is also less likely to be attacked and much less likely to be blobbed. About 18 bill at last count. 
---
Null, I actually spread out a bit. I have more and bigger toys,  have easier reships, and can take more risky fights. About 220 bill at last count.  Most of it is there because it was more convenient to have it close with a 15% asset safety fee and 3 weeks of inaccessibility as my calculated risk. 
---
Otherwise it would probably be limited to about the same as the wormhole,  and overwhelmingly in staging where it's not a pain to evac.
---
You can add an English keyboard to your phone my man, it's pretty easy. Gboard (Google's keyboard app for iPhone) has pretty sharp autocorrect/word-finishing in a lot of languages; it's very nice to be able to easily switched to the German or Czech keyboards when I need to.
---
No one would blame you for being leery of a Google product of course, but it's a good app, and more generally I just wanted to point out that if you have to type in other languages often, you have options to make it a much less painful process :)
---
Not one volley, but maybe a large fleet of bs could potentially do that?

---
&gt;Now imagine that you spent $80 for the month of insurance, and the company gives you $2,000.  Now imagine that the insurance company used a printer to make the $2,000 and burned the $80.  Now, $4,920 exists in the world when originally only $3,080 existed in the world.  Its a faucet, not a sink.

The fuck, when was this??
---
What part was idiotic? His behaviour, even by EVE's standards, is concerning.  But hey, he streams it so that makes it ok.
---
&gt;What was many now becomes one
---
Obviously the Drifters unite into one cohesive entity and invade.
---
&gt;**when** one becomes four
---
This implies something happened somewhere else that prompted this invasion, that some empire or something split into 4. And I don't think it's talking about the 4 main factions since that happened long ago, unless they recently allied and broke apart (I've been out of the game loop for a while).
---
I'm at work and unable to do research on it, but I could've sworn that New Eden was colonized so rapidly because humanity had somehow managed to overpopulate every system they could reach and deplete the available resources (because capitalism probably). Am I wrong?
---
Still karmaduken :D
---
But it's a sandbox.
---
The players used the tools given and a certain group seemingly excelled.
---
Now this is CCP pulling it all back?
---
If this is the case I can certainly understand said group being less than thrilled.
---
Would you settle for no asset recovery on low power citadels?
---
True
---
You must never have gone roaming null before. 
---
Seriously, these guys drop 80+ supers regularly and replace them as soon as they die. They can get a dozen guys in catalysts to melt a drifter. 
---
I guess they're just not too pleased now that they're on the recieving end, for once. But hey, you know what they tell everybody else, right?
---
"Adapt or die."
---
Sandbox or not, CCP still needs to consider the long-term health of the game. If this is, in fact, part of an effort to get things back into a better place, I don't think there's too much room to complain - they've let all of this go on quite long enough.
---
Besides, the "certain group" will just adapt, like they always do.
---
Drifter operations will continue until player morale improves.
---
&gt; If you remove asset safety people will just store their valuables in NPC stations somewhere. 
---
You say this like it's a bad thing.
---
When the thing killing you is not in local you are fucked ... if you are a bot bleeep-blooop
---
While local is not the best feature of eve, it is here to stay. But yeah, I wish the devs back then could have figured out a better way.
---
Goons: We glassed Tribute!  
---
CCP: Hold my beer...
---
The TCU and Ihub are sov structures used to hold systems. And attacked when you want to take a System.
---
So. NCPL blued CCP, and CCP are taking care of their baby?
---
It's sounds too low to be true. Tbh. Hope this is just random stuff.
---
Gdmnt I wish I knew wtf U are all talking about :)
---
Why would they have less? They'd just store them somewhere safe, like the closest NPC station or their blob's staging.
---
I say this as someone that suicides a blinged HAWS into hostile null a few times a year for shits and giggles, and has a super logged off in hostile space for opportune targets.   Cap storage is not a factor in proliferation, cheap minerals and an aging playerbase is.
---
I hereby bestow upon you the the title of, "Hugh". Now arise, Hugh, and go forth to claim your destiny!
---
I mean maybe this is a result of the Triv invasion considering the Abyssal sites were related to some Drifter vs Triv stuff. They are both now trying to gain a foothold into New Eden as separate entities to offset each other.
---
Do not pay attention to it. Your downvotes are from people who only reads about null-sec. Obviously they are having fun now: others need to deal with this “incredible sandbox addition”.
---
Npc more efficient at doing damages in Delve than NC. Mhm.
---
Man..... A player killed the lore ship for Caroline's star? That's crazy. We'll never know what it said or had.

---
Timing though. I wonder if this is going to ramp up. I'm loving it.
---
&gt; And if i don't own the structure? If real life interferes and my hiatus is unplanned?
---
Life isn't fair and all you've really lost is some pixels anyway. Eve was originally designed with this in mind. It's only their accommodation of people who want to play the end game content in complete safety that has taken us to this point.
---
Wow shit that would have been a pretty long con if so. 'Heres all this new tech and ships to use plus unique shit to build it with'. Leave enough time for proper integration across all sorts of shit 'oh nooo they're coming back to take their shit you stole!'.
---
I think you will find that there is a difference in the way people and alliances that are built around fighting and defending against real people, view fighting NPCs with make believe losses.  
---
Most people get that they will have big toys go boom in a war with real people, but that they will also get a chance to do the same to another real person.
---
Could you elaborate? What exactly in drifter incursions made you so excited?
---
That's how eve is supposed to be, where one structure loss is historic. 
---
Not throwing them away like toilet paper.
---
No undock and bore to death strategic works against NPC?
---
Possible, yes. But extremely unlikely that they wouldn’t still be ahead of everyone including the Jovians. Even if they had a dark age they had multiple planets all colonized and a collapse on one of them wouldn’t slow the entire technology development down
---
It doesn't accomplish the objective of creating incentive to bash structures as cited in the OP.
---
As said before,  that's literally the worst option.
---
If your goal is less offline spam,  go the other way and auto-initiate asset safety on power loss.  It penalizes lazy storage by active players and spares absentees.
---
It's a shame we never found out just what happened to Hillen.
---
I have one job. Please don't take that away.
---
Because we used to have POS-sov, and that was almost as cancerous as fozziesov and citadel spam
---
Are there any reports of activity in LS/HS/J Space?
---
I dont eve line Anime but id hit it ya feel
---
Ahh, good to know.
---
Not bad
---
You absolutely can.
---
EvE is going away from sandbox for few years already. CCP is adding more and more rules and restrictions.
---
Read the post
---
&gt; Their honey has been excavated, we have the ships we need now, their use is over.
---
stop it I am getting cramps from laughing XD
---
I like the last 2, the second is generally a good idea but needs more details,  and i don't know what #1 means.
---
I think this is hilarious, I can't wait to see how we exploit/weaponize/subvert this into something that CCP totally didn't anticipate.  That's assuming this is real and not a short duration event or a CCP screw up.
---
Sov as you hold the system gives you benefits, for example after you have held a system for 35 days you can install cyno jammers and jump bridges in the system.
---
Also you cannot build Supers or Titans without a iHUB upgrade.
---
Sov before TCU’s and iHUB’s was determined by who owned the most POS’s at down time. But you can put a POS and every moon and some systems have 30+ moons so you should have bash half and POS’s and replace them with your own to take the system. This took a very long time.
---
In the current system you can entosis the iHUB/TCU then have a node event in the next 1-2 days. If you win that you can install you own iHUB/TCU and take the sov.
---
Wtf is going on with drifters?
---
All hail our new overlords
---
The japanese dub
---
OMAE WA MOU SHINDEIRU!
---
Oh man, if only the 7th point was an EvE-Adam connection back, leading to a "Terran" strongly fortified new area. We would be like little things there.
---
Imagine having to actually deal with NPCs just like we meta players. :O
---
If you think this is going to negatively impact large coalitions in any way beyond forcing Goons to go home a few weeks early you're a fucking moron. 
---
This is probably the greatest proof of Malcanis' Law Eve has ever seen.
---
Remove safety net as in asset recovery.  I think making it more risky to take stuff out there will turn into an isk sink.
---
I do and now we have to prove the direction of our flow to the triglavians.  Also that comma is 100% pointless my dude.
---
Have any of the old POSs been blown up? I could see this as the great offline POS removal
---
More salt.
---
♦ type rats has been shooting structures for almost a year already
---
You mean all the botters from Ranger Regiment?  It's been a bot holocaust up there since it started.
---
more like dat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep98a0mDiIc
---
That would be awesome. I would love nothing more than for everyone to start resetting everyone.
---
How do I make my character look like this?!?!
---
Check Ranger Regiment on zkill....
---
Well you can select corp/alliance flairs here https://i.imgur.com/zGXZ7OW.png but to get a custom one you have to send your dick pics to the moderators,
---
What a fun way for CCP to introduce a drifter mothership or some such.
---
I love the idea of defending.. But how the hell are you gonna defend against 50 Drifter battleships?
---
It isn't static and it is controlled by structures in space...
---
Now we need to add a few alliance logos and hand drawn overviews.
---
I think that's a fairly good idea. Immediately move everything out of the station and bill them for it. 
---
You get to keep all your shit but it's inconvenient to get back into null.
---
Remove damage caps and timers in null!
---
Sure is a lot of goon salty tears.
---
Hell, they could still come up that the "loot" survived, and was picked up by some third party who has stayed quiet as the words scared them that much.
---
And when the time is right, that person dies, and their child inherits it and makes it public
---
Many ways to do it if they really want to
---
Enjoy all :) criticism is always appreciated.
---
They’re a  second empire Jovian breakaway faction that moved into abyssal dead space instead of going into stasis and ending up as sleepers, iirc
---
double u, lmao.
---
Except this is not a new and reduced level of risk.  If anything, eating 15%, 3 weeks, and a painful move from a camped lowsec station is more painful than 10% off firesales or smuggling it out through a friend/spy.  Except for SOLAR and the deadzoned outpost,  but that was literally the only time that happened.
---
4 Jovian empires, if you count the Trigs
---
Someone else pointed that already and I forgot to edit it... now I'll just leave it like that.
---
&gt; Oh, they also ignore damage cap of structures.
---
Oh.  Well that's not good.
---
...and life is such a treat!  I'm livin' in Australia up a Eucalyptus tree!  (I finished it for you don't worry).
---
Did mittens say it was bad?
---
Hi sec pubbie dies in abyssmal site has to rebuy everything. Guess who seeds the markets with gilas and a types.
---
It's talking about a threat that isn't shown in local
---
Watching this pretzel form is crazy.
---
Trying to bringing in new players while keeping the old guard happy has them seemingly in knots.
---
after 10 years of playing EVE you will look like that irl
---
Wasn't happy at the fireside. I'm sure all the spies already heard it.
---
diff'rent strokes
---
Ok I'll try again.
---
Let's say you can see drifter pilots in local chat and you suddenly see thirty Drifter pilots pop up in local chat, would you continue to rat in your bling carrier like nobody's business? 
---
I Bet you would start aligning before you even see them on D-scan, before they even decloaked on the gate. 
---
But you don't get that luxury, you only see them if you d-scan them or when they are on grid with you.
---
On the other hand one little neutral one week old toon pops up in local in your back end system and you are already warping before they've even loaded in. That's how they're related.
---
The health of the game? 
---
Really?
---
I mean I could think of a few things that would almost immediately help the health of the game, of course it would involve killing the golden goose and no one would do that so aye.......ur probably right.
---
salty lol
---
..... This is a serious shit post
---
I don't really have the time to commit to Eve to fully enjoy it or experience it but I've always been curious about it. Is there a good streamer or youtuber that would be worth watching? Or a good video series?
---
As an addition to what others are saying, the TCU does literally nothing besides put your name on the map/dotlan. All upgrades/fees/index etc are dependant on the ihub.
---
Oh yes losing everything you own when you afk for a few months is a tiny change. You already have the gameplay you want in wormholes and yes it is a valid argument. So go to w-space instead of being one more guy screaming to 'delete local' or any other braindead hundred times rehashed 'quick fix' to a complicated problem.
---
Have you even thought that anything kneejerk you do to reduce citadel spam fucks attackers just as much if not more than defenders further solidifying null blocks?
---
Thanks buddy~
---
It makes huge empires unsustainable.
---
Smaller ones will work out fine
---
You are talking to the wall, mu friend. These nolifer nerds will troll you forever.
---
There isn't an easy answer to asset safety. If has to have risk, but tolerance for long term afk players. I've proposed to have asset safety inly fir chars that are afk for more than 30 days or so, but that is hard to implement as well. And can be exploited....
---
Drifter NPCs are going around attacking player owned structures now
---
[:3](https://youtu.be/V8XTpCwicwE)
---
&gt;It goes after citadel spam.
---
Are burning down citadels in high sec too? Are they returning for armor and hull timers?
---
Yup, I think a lot of the complaints are just coming from but knowing how to deal with this.
---
Eventually learn how the drivers targets and also how to deal with them
---
Nullsec is broken. We need to stir the pot. How will removing asset recovery fuck attackers?
---
nah he didnt lose his JF that way, that was jita
---
good commentary, much better than the generic dubstep music in a lot of these videos and I might have even learned something xD
---
Because when you're attacking you need to stage ships somewhere don't you?
---
3rd option: a CCP dev merged this 'bug' into the codebase on purpose
---
that is 4,5 trillion worth of shit uncontested in Tribute, thank you!   Rorq herd member with a rich nc/pl padded killboard here.
---
How does it hurt the small guys? Small guys been attacked?
---
Definetly not. I'm not saying itll open. I'm not saying it'll have terrans on the other side of it does... but it will impact the story. 
---
I'm actually more expecting another elimination of the stargate from a pulse from the Eve Gate.
---
It works both ways. Victory is secured by the strongest group.
---
judging by where he died I'd say he was gating somewhere and got infinite pointed and then killed by the drifters.
---
I have to say I'm somewhat impressed. If these things destroy a couple of keepstars I'll have to resub.
---
u/1darklight1
---
how is it not a sandbox now? it's just ccp making the environment more hostile.
---
like, why should you be able to deploy everything across the universe and basically ignore your home space, where you throw space stations down for laughs? 
---
people are only reacting badly to this because they have put down so many shitty structures that don't actually matter, and for the first time are facing a meaningful cost of upkeep. personally i prefer a version of eve where putting a keepstar in every system isn't optimal.
---
its mass effect
---
holding sov in an area lets you upgrade the the amonalies, lets you build supers and titans, lets you install your own stargate network, etc. plenty of reasons to hold sov
---
&gt;as an outside observer
---
Guess your opinion isn't that relevant, huh?
---
Except as I said it fucks attackers harder because defenders already have dozens of citadels spammed up and can move their assets with minimal effort. 
---
The drifters attacks are a fantastic idea IMO to get rid of structures that are not actively defended. 
---
It's already a pain in the ass to fuel infrastructure so just having NPCs clear the abandoned ones should be fine.
---
"The war in the north ending is unrelated to this. "
---
Citation needed. 
---
As far as I was aware (and confirmed by the definitely not publically available fireside), the next stage of the war was to invade malpais,  after burning the remaining structures to the ground in vale/gem .
---
That is no longer happening with these changes.
---
Make sure you all buy starter packs
---
Unrelated, but this is why reddit is garbage. Groupthink is encouraged and "bad thoughts" get hidden by downvotes. A literal echo chamber.
---
lmao
---
Quitting.
---
Other NPCs are also not showing in local chat. Your idea is dumb.
---
NPCs are not players therefore not related.
---
Truth, you don't use nuclear weapons to arrest a robber.
---
Arguing for more risk = spodbrain
---
Am confused
---
Are you a pirate?
---
so for someone who is out of the loop, what's with the bus?
---
So you're assuming that the caps that already have been produced suddenly disappear?
---
....to the person losing their ship, what's the difference?
---
Let it burn.
---
You’d be surprised. Tons of vehements.
---
Think I'm coming back in...
---
Not sure yet.
---
Wow m8, surprised you didn’t get in about ‘this will stop all wars’ other than that nice mouth breather pubbie rendition of the fireside.
---
I don't want npc to show up In local. Read more then one sentence before replying.
---
The Init plans to go home were leaked before the trig attack. Unless the main Goonswarm attack was planning to continue without Init support, but from how they were talking about the Hakonen deployment it didn’t sound like there was going to be any big action happening. He specifically mentioned that there didn’t seem to be any desire from Init or allies to invade geminate or vale. 
---
If someone leaks the fireside with mittens contradicting this it would be interesting, but as far as I’m aware that hasn’t happened yet, and I’m too lazy to get a spy alt

It's bad.
---
We scream for balance, and any number of other things to make the PVP game more fun.
---
What do we get? More PVE.
---
See, my personal opinion, if you have a structure that can build a super you should just be able to build it, and the whole notion of rat bait and better 'roids through space magic is stupid to me. "Here lil' pirate, come join the other 120000 or your wrecked brethren." This is why I like the new AI - give those pirates some goals and make people hunt them for bounties and loot.
---
Non-consensual EvP
---
yeah, unless the drifty boys are active in proportion to some kind of player activity. because whether it's npc deaths, structure numbers, player density, etc, delve is going to be the the number one target for them.
---
Guess we'll see. It was 2% away

We've done something like it before.  In fact it's why the GoonWaffe corporation exists.  Back in 2006 There was a cap of 1300 players on a corporation.  Goonfleet had reached that cap leading to the creation of the GoonWaffe overflow corporation.  To get CCP to fix it a poem was written, in crayon, and physically mailed to CCP HQ in Iceland.  That poem can be read here:  [https://wiki.goonfleet.com/The\_Sad\_Little\_Bee](https://wiki.goonfleet.com/The_Sad_Little_Bee)

The final step of grand plan: CCP replacing players with NPCs.
---
Yeah, it was too much trouble for me to scroll down just a little bit so I didn't see it before I posted my dumb shit. So sorry about that but if you do edit it, I'll be forced to your title. Just so you know.
---
Would be understandable. They would be kinda pissed we used their tech.
---
&gt;We need to stir the pot.
---
you are gonna destroy the pot with how much you want to stir it
---
This i could get behind, removing it from all structures would be too frustrating
---
Just lightly enough to remove the burnt bits on the bottom
---
That Nightmare had cool Genos too.
---
Slasher is a great starting platform. Good luck my guy :)
---
Sure it does. Not everyone will be quite as paranoid about undocking as you believe and think about what happens when you put all of your shiny stuff in a "safe" station in NPC space... if  everyone starts doing it, that NPC space will lose its value because they won't want to undock their blingy shit when half the people in local want to gang rape them.
---
And if it leads to a lower density sov null populated by risk takers, how can you really complain? You might even get that elusive honorable 1v1.
---
Then deal with em and go back to kicking over other peoples sand castles you whiny bitch
---
&gt;Now I understand why so many people dislike Fozziesov!
---
Fozziesov is the current system. Are you referring to POS Sov?
---
Imagine a game so shit it has to employ overpowered NPC's to reset everything to be interesting again.

It's not. It's planned. They already said it was all intentional. I hope it stays. This is null space and it's about time they made it risky to be there. Risk in null should not only come from other players, but NPC as well... and not only on your own terms. This is good for the game.
---
Did CCP hire a new dev named CCP Fuck You?
---
Drifter. Heaven. Now.
---
&gt;2) 
---
This might be worth it. Maybe I'll resu...
---
&gt;Edit: Before some Goons unironically report me for an NDA breach I should add that this post is fictional.
---
Oh. NEVER FUCKING MIND THEN.
---
The concept of a joke totally eludes you, right?
---
Its like when all the AFK NC and PL members return after their brakes (lots of military dudes on tour etc) Leadership can say "oh these drifters came along and reffed all the structures, they are OP as fuck and just deleted all our citadels in tribute. Thats why all your shit is in asset safety"
---
I mean the dude pays his bills, pays his rent, feeds himself and somewhat keeps his hygiene to par.(as far as we can see). Not exactly what I strive for in life, but what is exactly expected from the guy?
---
Have CCP pronounce about this matter or it's just working as intended?
---
Dont be so sure.
---
CCP seemed very conflicted about Local at EVE North. To the point consensus is it needs to change.
---
come to low sec, that's where pvp is at
---
&gt;can be exploited...
---
The real talent of eve players is right here.
---
And sometimes the sandbox changes, especially when that change is better for the overall health of the sandbox.
---
GOD THIS FIT IS CANCER.
---
Drifters will fuck you hard.
---
Find them, please reinforce ;)
---
This is an awful idea, just like every time it gets brought up.
---
The neural network has become self aware
---
I don't think it has to do with the chat channel. It's the fact that risk in null is next to nothing anymore. You should be weary of players as well as NPCs. NPCs now can ruin your day and not on your own terms.
---
No, but I think I have a fuller understanding of why people gripe about both.
---
Haha yeh i would say the dual web long point one is worse.
---
:) cheers man thanks glad you enjoyed it.
---
The only reason people would do that is if they are seriously autistic or they are selling isk
---
Awful why?
---
Imagine if they have some huge ship ready to deploy as soon as a big deployment to face them is detected. 
---
It'd be a big way to showcase a ship that can't be nuked off grid easily.
---
Did they scoop the loot?
---
Ship and weapon balancing needs to stop being random. They need to pick a direction(start with frigs and work up or titans and down) and stick to it. Not in let's balance cruisers here then bs then a year later let's do hacs and so on. They need to take a year and not touch ships but work on a balance approach goals for each ship class same with weapons and just do a balance pass on the entire line on paper first maybe internal testing on the devs server. Then do the balances all in order in a short period of time.
---
I'll just let the killmails speak for themselves:

Risk vs reward of staging assets in helpful places.
---
I got excited when they mention that. There is hope.
---
Implying ag would go ganking
---
Funny guy
---
I know.. but squeaky wheel gets the oil.
---
Need to make them start blapping low power stuff maybe allow them to ignore the hull timer ie directly from armor into hull no waiting a week for them. To many low power structures just sitting around honestly or make low power stuff not provide a teather(low power still teathers right? I cant remember off the top of my head lol)
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77501108/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77501108/)

This was in High Sec!!! Can we confirm if they are reinforcing structures in HS/LS/WH space?
---
People would have their shit station locked all the time.
---
Can't wait to see 3 Nergals vs a Ikitursa
---
I guess you should know that my left testicle hangs just a *little bit* lower than my right.
---
I get the point you're trying to make. 
---
In the real world the money comes from premiums the insurance company is collecting from customers. In Eve it is just created. 
---
The actual payments are a sink, but the insurance payouts are a faucet. The payouts are net positive, so it's still a faucet overall.
---
Good video. Cheers.
---
I'd say have it so drifters go after low power stuff and some how allowing them to ignore the timer on hull ie enable them to kill it in one day. Way to many low power structure.
---
Pubbies like him wouldn’t understand.
---
&gt; Except this is not a new and reduced level of risk
---
Bullshit. Firesales would 9 times of 10 cost more than your dreamy 10% and people have lost huge sums (even their caps) when using a POS. This is absolutely a lower risk mechanic. 
---
And that even ignores that asset safety is literally an evac fairy mechanic that not only makes losing your structure hurt far less but allows you to bypass gatecamps to move your victim loot drops and exploration assets to empire using asset safety even when you have no actual access to a structure.
---
Asset safety is Eve putting training wheels on a motorcycle and paving the roads with cotton candy. You literally can't lose.
---
No honour. :(
---
Nothing in LS or WH space afaik.
---
Ya me too. Also the potential removal of Cynos from LS gave me a semi.
---
You can do anything in a sandbox, but if a 5 year old shits in it you have to clean it out or the other kids won't want to play.
---
Calculated attacks? A mistake that CCP is trying to cover up? It's obviously intentional and thus why your post is not funny.
---
Honestly that is probably true lol. It's like a better dual web armor kestrel or a better breacher. Both of those ships are just on the knife's edge of ok already.
---
Novice plexes are a train wreck eh?
---
Pretty sure my NDA is through now, as it's been like, forever. What sort of story:
---
- Day to day anti RMT shits and giggles
---
- Staff parties
---
- Trying to stop account theft without the ability to "hijack" a character
---
- Mods gone wild
---
They returned for one of PH's ansiblexes and killed it https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/
---
Once upon a time that "hard uncertain element" in EVE came from the players.  It kinda sucks that people are being compelled to engage in non-consensual pve.
---
The trigs can use our JBs if they talk to our diplos and pay for fuel
---
best meme for now.
---
i dont know but this kill in low sec make me think its a yes
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77499477/
---
Ok, sorry I wasn't able to make you giggle or at least excersise your imagination a little, I hope that stick up you ass isn't too uncomfortable for you.
---
They also attempted to ref a fuckton of TEST structures, and mostly got their asses kicked cos we weren't afk.
---
You're right but to say that's what's going on without anything besides "people have done it before!" is just as naive
---
Haven't seen any weird drifters in wormhole space so far, and the sleeper sites seem to be normal.
---
Thanks bud!
---
you are right there. if they only do shield timers its gonna be a total letdown. but if shit ACTUALLY burns. then FUCK to the YES.
---
That it bitch till ccp fixes it. I'm looking at you dics the most pvp focused ship and mod in the game somehow went from cause agression if someone warps in bubble(acceptable)to launching causes agression(best given what the ship and mod is) to can not(why? Why? Ccp why) cause agression at all.
---
Why would they, you guys don't need help losing that ihub
---
lol login required
---
The simplest and easiest way is to pick a structure completely at random. 
---
This will still cause entities with more structures to be selected more often.
---
We have attempted to blue the drifters after successfully repelling most of their attacks. Diplos have not yet responded.
---
Seeing a gate flash 5 jumps away is a massively lower value piece of intel than local. Sure you know that pilot X entered the system in a Tengu, but when he cloaks and warps off, you don't know whether he's still there, logged off, went through a wormhole, docked up, swapped ship at a POS ...
---
Also you don't get to see people who log in in system, jump in through a wormhole, bridge in on a covert cyno etc.
---
Drifter escalations please
---
Let me just undock my made up bigger ship
---
I'm wondering if reduction of structure bonuses could be an answer. More structures per system = bonus penalty. It would encourage people to spread out their structures. It could also reduce the structure spam in high sec and force people to either take the penalty or try to remove competitors
---
I saw you guys in Amamake the other day, that's space
---
Source besides a single GM line member?
---
"Hey guys, remember that little CODE nuisance that gets the occasional dumb freighter?" 
---
"Yeah?"
---
"They got some SOV."
---
"Warm up my Titan! Time to smash some bugs!"
---
" I just received the clearance from CCP to reveal "
---
" **Edit: Before some Goons unironically report me for an NDA breach** "
---
It must be a difficult life for you with whatever is going on inside your head. 
---
I hope you will learn at least one thing for the next year, and that is that goons are not the root of all evil. I doubt you will manage to see that goons are actually doing tons of good things for this game, but hey, can't break iron with bare hands either.
---
How is having to actually face an incoming threat "krabbing" to you. 
---
This isn't ratting.
---
True but they would be shooting themselves in the foot, such a huge portion of their income are afk ratters/miners and their alts. 
---
Obviously now it's gotten to the point where krabbing is way too safe/easy, but too many people would unsub if they nerfed krabbing income significantly or made it THAT much more dangerous so this is their attempt at a middle ground.
---
_gestures towards nullsec_
---
Cheers to you to man :)
---
Losing a Hel to drifters is a bad way to go. So not worth it. 
---
Would you like to escape the drifter menace by ratting in the safety of wormhole space instead?  You can make up to 8 billion isk an hour. 
---
Join the "HK Wormhole Rentals" channel in game to learn more.
---
This gave me way too much of a giggle than it should have.
---
Can I vote for all of the above
---
I know. You are wanting to equate this attack to players. Players are not NPCs. Therefore, your idea is stupid.
---
Indeed man and we have mot even talked about worms and garmors yet.
---
How about instead of that, funnel them into the publicly recruiting but less visible nullsec and lowsec groups. DIRT N GLITTER IS RECRUITING. YGG IS RECRUITING. FRESH IS RECRUITING. SPIKE IS...no they're dead nvm. ROGUE IS RECRUITING. GMVA IS...maybe undocking. If you're sure it's just one frigate.
---
I heard Rote Kapelle is recruiting, they got a newbro feeder corp?
---
RMT shits and giggles please
---
Even then it's not, as not very many of those stay.
---
Hmmm...
---
lets go with Anti RMT
---
ty ty
---
holy fuck would logistics be a pain in the ass.
---
People dying to NPCs are infinitely more hilarious. That is the difference.
---
Only 1 incursion in highsec at a time now, can take up to 36 hrs for a new one to spawn (or ao ive read)
---
So yeah the forums would explode it'd be pretty funny!
---
Right? I mean I'd love to see newbie friendly groups get thrown at newbies, but there are a lot of those, many of them small. Like where's DNG on that list.
---
Wait, there's two "big" wars going on? I'm not trolling, I literally had no idea any big groups were fighting.
---
Oh shit, this could get fun. All of eve could burn.
---
Who knows, maybe, sorta, drink, just go undock and do something dumb it's more fun
---
Already buying up all the tornados in jita in preparation
---
There is an intermediate form of sov people aren't mentioning here. Between POS sov and fozzie sov there was something else (not sure what it was called)
---
for example:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/2o0x8x/psa\_understanding\_sov\_warfare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/2o0x8x/psa_understanding_sov_warfare/)
---
If you write NC. on a piece of paper and fold it, then unfold it. It reads NPC.
---
Everything has already been tried against this bot.
---
CCP despite detailed reports (like the one above) has not yet done anything about him (or those like him in other systems (eg Hampinen).
---
Even AG cannot help here.
---
Right? If everyone who bitched on this sub grabbed the first 5 guys they find in corp and undocked we'd all have a lot more fun.
---
This is awesome
---
What if...
---
The Triglavians are real alien-like human live in other dimensions that hypnotized CCP and conveyed their messages through this game?
---
We are at the frontier of discovery dude
---
Just a CCP jita scam, here’s a bunch of drifters to blow up all your stuff, by the way plex sale!! Replace what you lost, we need money!!
---
watch out for them drifters
---
Meanwhile the series I'm working on is titled "I slide my rifter into anything".
---
Positive so far.
---
&gt; Fucking win-win!
---
Or they could make it worthwhile for, uh, actual players to kill structures? If them bitches dropped hangar loot, half of them would be burned down in six months. Nobody wants to work a week + to kill a structure that drops some paltry mods. 
---
Goddamn, we used to think killing a POS was bad.
---
Like gun game but eve style
---
This is a fantastic shitpost.
---
But, y'know, CCPls, something like this is actually a good idea. Cyclic episodes of NPCs being a real threat and levelling lots of infrastructure, with time in between for people to build fortresses and contest the resources, would give Eve a dynamism and all the advantages of a round based game, without actually having to reset the cluster or wipe people's general assets.
---
I wish you luck with that man :)
---
yeah he said that, no one. goons are bots
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498704/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498704/) \- 1.1 Ishtar
---
They will. I promise.
---
Since we are doing what if...
---
Once the drifters bash all structures in system they anchor their own structure. Once anchored, local is deleted as long as their structure is anchored.
---
Drifters are showing up to more timers than ncpl
---
I think it's great they are also Podding people. Like you better be committed to the fight because they will wreck you.
---
&gt;On the other hand one little neutral one week old toon pops up in local in your back end system and you are already warping before they've even loaded in.
---
I expect any neutral in local to be bad news. I don’t expect NPCs to suddenly become sentient and hunt me down, kill my ship, and RF my hut. This isn’t about them not showing up in local, this is about totally unexpected behavior from something that you thought was predictable. 
---
If I saw drifters on Dscan a week ago, I wouldn’t have even really bothered to do anything other than see if there is a drifter hole nearby. What reason do I have to be worried about them? Just don’t go to the hole and you’re fine. Someone logging in today and is aware of these changes, might actually take this new threat seriously now.
---
You actually think that NC was going to titan brawl?  The 'war' was over.  A bunch of undefended Keeps died.  Not that that is a bad thing.  Unironic congratulations to you guys,  but 'NC Stays docked' isn't a sellable headline to new players.
---
Thats why Cyno Beacons exist.
---
&gt; Have CCP pronounce about this matter 
---
They shouldn't
---
&gt; it's just working as intended 
---
It's not a bug
---
This guy probably went through a drifter wormhole and triggered local residents
---
Wait, is it NCPL or the GSM with the insider information now? I am confused....
---
Fuck it, I’m jumping back in! 
---
Who wants a veteran noob in their Corp?
---
I hope ccp don't reverse this.
---
Well.
---
I'll be over here, quietly munching on my popcorn.
---
Let’s shut down the major player base of all big blocs, and waste all their hours spent/coordination efforts and force them to stop all engagements in the game and go home to do forced pve, great idea!! Also by destroying everyone’s stuff we can have a plex sale and make money off all the losses!! Total CCP jita scam.
---
Going to file that under "Probably"
---
Imagine drifters camping Jita 😂😂
---
On this point i am totally 100% with you. Nullsec citadels should drop just like wormhole citadels. Iterally that one change would incentivise conflict and war!
---
We used to play with CCP games, now CCP plays with us.
---
Just thinking about it..... God I want it to happen so bad.
---
I wasn't
---
If ccp is reading this I might actually resign if this happens.
---
I get it, you would be fine with it if you knew about it going in, I am sure CCP can do something about that if they ever remove asset safety.
---
Do you think having it in the first place was a good idea?
---
When local means that you can run from PVP players, only PVE threats remain.
---
Moving assets is an evac, large scale evacs always provide juicy killmails (read gameplay/content)
---
I am very susceptible to peer pressure!
---
What if you stopped posting?
---
Food for thought.
---
CCP created NPC faction to remind the 'burn jita', 'hulkageddon' crowd to not use the term 'carebear' so lightly.
---
Have you ever heard of ihub upgrades?
---
Without them there will be no rats to krab and no spods to whale
---
CCP playing the long con to ruin the game for Goons. Get bent.
---
I was, and I wasn't even there &lt;3
---
Who are you quoting
---
Yes, that’s great for the 3 regions in range of Jita, but how do you get back?
---
Have my babies
---
“Drink more Quafe Zero”
---
But not Supers &amp; Titans.  No NPC stations for them 😊
---
I was
---
Great, now we're getting batphoned for NPC fights. What a world.
---
I mean, unlike player ships or triglavian invading NPC, those drifters don't show up on dscan
---
And I'm pretty sure there are active non-krab players lost their ships because they had no ways to tell if there is a roaming drifter fleet in local or not
---
The roaming NPC fleet killing random stuff is fine, but kinda CCP's mistake not putting them on dscan
---
have never heard of them actually killing a structure before though. Mostly because it always depended on them showing up for the timer which due to how their "AI" work it was pretty much down to luck.
---
yea, i'll repeat, holy fuck would logistics be a pain in the ass. 
---
You are planning on jumping your JF to beacons?  that are gonna be perma camped?
---
Is there an faq/guide somewhere on what parameters go in the url to make it search for specific things?
---
Hi!
---
Now you have met one of us.
---
There’s already a solution, drifters.
---
Indeed and they are the t3c that gets not enough love while still are good ships and ccp need to make money to run right?
---
Yes because currently the game cannot sustain large alliances living in a single region.
---
Oh wait.
---
HS probably less so, good luck having "secure space" where you will lose structures unless you are a big enough blob to have people in standing fleets 24/7. Unless they only start going after truly abandoned clutter rather than in-use structures, but who knows how they pick targets at this point.
---
I just want them to drop more god damn loot
---
&gt;but also tolerance for long term afk players
---
Then why not add it to J space?
---
Next surprise, anything the drifters kill will not be subject to asset safety.
---
‘remember CCP is skynet’
---
How do you summon that which is afk?
---
&gt; one little neutral one week old toon pops up in local 
---
nobody gives a shit about the one week toon, it is the dread bomb sitting on tether waiting to drop that everybody docks up for.
---
I’m forming a very large organization based in Thera, your prices are... too high for it to be a consideration for me.
---
If you are interested I’d love to discuss with you some way of making it work, as we can provide scouts/eyes and are reputable. *shrugs* just saying
---
Gross....eve politics.
---
Except it is... Your primary argument is that it will make people attack the structures for the prize inside. Except they currently can and currently don't.
---
Yeah now it’s if they want to, with those changes it would be because they have to
---
&gt; If you remove asset safety people will just store their valuables in NPC stations somewhere
---
And so there'll be more contention for the limited resources in NPC space, less low risk farming in sov null, and people who want to live in sov null will have to put things at risk, generating content. Sounds good.
---
&gt; Groups facing removal will simply move everything to lowsec nearby 
---
... giving you the opportunity to intercept the move op
---
the driftening is already happening
---
it's good
---
too bad it's AI that is scary, not players
---
you know what... i'd actually be okay with this.
---
...this is a nice idea but in theory it means "remove asset safety from all structures".
---
Once the armour timer goes, all services go offline and a structure goes into the low power state. :P
---
Only give asset safety to low power structures? :)
---
A whole new batch of suckers to buy up Jita firesales
---
I mean fuck. People use carriers more than battleships so screw it
---
Its a tough topic. Your changes would not have the desired effect. I don’t have a better idea. Doesn’t make your idea any good though
---
Lots of very cheap ships like corms. No one has been brave enough to try a titan or super. You can kill single drifter bs with a dread.
---
As an eve winner, quit years ago, this is making me consider a return.
---
Why not just anchor them to moons? If someone wants to turbo-harvest every moon in their system, they have to give up defences, and vice versa.
---
It can be fun to be totally clueless. Depends how you take it.
---
I can tell you exactly what will happen and how it will happen without any risk of The Plan\~ being jeopardized. Reddit has unwittingly flexed it's voting potential to put Olmeca Gold onto the CSM. There is a reason Olmeca Gold didn't appear on any Imperium ballots. We couldn't allow for any indication that we actually wanted him on the CSM. Not even to our line members, it had to be you; reddit that put him there...
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the [/r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/) crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
The past 3 years I have canvased here knowing full well that you would never willingly accept The Key\~ to your shackles even if presented to you. The ultimate argument inoculation, the ultimate dead agenting of an enemy group. It's too late, there is nothing you can do. I have already won.
---
The Drifter spaceships will take us to heaven if we off ourselves.
---
JUDE7E?
---
LMAO.
---
Engineering ones do drop whatever is built, or materials. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77367768/
---
Fair enough.
---
blow up citadels and jump bridges then capsuleers will death clone leaving juicy frozen corpses.
---
Does anyone know what kind of car this dude drives, or if he frequently uses buses/subways? Asking for a friend...
---
I mean, you can always whelp bombers from WH space.
---
Makes sense....I guess my only counter would be that it had been so for so long??? The shock of it all lul.
---
Someone got under the OP's skin I guess. Well played evan.
---
Jodete in spanish, "fuckyourself" in English.
---
Nah just a guy who probably likes talking about Eve more than playing it at this point.
---
TIL
---
&gt;Also, “move to w-space if you dont like it” and “i dont want to lose all my stuff when i leave the game for 5 months” aren’t valid excuses to keep asset recovery.
---
I love how you people think you can just inject your own shitty opinion and assume it's fact.
---
Well, that's not a "spammed structure"
---
No, my primary argument is that citadel spam is a problem and removing asset recovery will fix it, creating more meaningful fight and more content in eve. 
---
Are you opposed to more content?
---
you know the only way they could keep that secret is they don't know what they are gonna do next
---
Sounds about par for the course, but I look forward to seeing where this new "feature" goes.
---
lives in wh space and complains that hauling prices are too high. gl with that
---
Don’t read my post if you don’t like it.
---
Why though?
---
"Sorry my English is not good."
---
"No. Thank you for speaking my language."
---
I never complained, we’re capable of hailing for ourself, but this is the leader of push asking for more business
---
I just thought I’d mention that if he was willing to work on the price, we could work on something.
---
Also Thera isn’t exactly a real wormhole. Lots of static highsecs
---
LMAO. I read this one too and it was another shitpost. if you don't like that I don't give a shit.
---
no, of course people will say yes because what do you expect from asking in the literal subreddit of a game, but its a hard no.
---
tl;dr: we have altered the deal, pray we do not alter it further. oh yeah and all the things we said we wouldn't do when we introduced skill injectors we're probably going to end up doing anyways but *think about the newbros* and *sp doesn't really matter anyways guys*
---
Absolutely beautiful. I didn't think CCP had the balls to have them actually destroy structures. We're in for a good time boys.
---
Just finished buying them for my main and alts,
---
This is an unauthorized leak. Delete this thread and report to your local commissar for corrective action.
---
I wAs PlAYing ChEEss whIlE u PlAYed CHEckerS
---
This way putting up structures has a diminishing return, as you start stretching yourself thin trying to defend all of them at once. You'd have to carefully plan how many structures you will put up depending on the size and capability of your group, instead of on the size of your space. This sounds fantastic at least in theory.
---
You are missing the point and getting further from everytime you reply. Removing/nerfing local chat has been debated for 14 years. If you cannot connect the the dots at what I am trying to say doesn't my post stupid. It makes you stupid.
---
He didn't remember to write: "all according to keikaku" with an evil laughter 
---
Also TL,DR: jokes on you we did made you vote a CFC member doing things anti-CFC only to enter CSM to do CFC things while it seems doing anti CFC things. I'm the biggest and smartest man on world and you all should suck my dick
---
I’m still trying not to
---
Me neither. So we’re even :)
---
Well maybe you should try jettisoning some corpses right next to Tyrannos Strategos as you remote sensor boost him right before you eject from your ship sacrificially...
---
Come back as an alpha and blow your ship up! It's free!
---
Yeah, it's pretty awesome. 
---
Listening to the carebears who think they're the shit because they own nullsec with their blobs is fucking even more awesome. 
---
To me, EVE over the last year or so has started to feel more like early EVE, and I'm digging it.
---
Their botting supers can't undock for risk of die
---
Who cares? Enjoy it! Embrace the bug!!
---
As always, it depends on which party you're asking.
---
Ok if I'm at 48M SP and buy 5 large injectors and inject them but don't apply the points, once I hit 50M will I have 2M unallocated SP or 1.5M?
---
Sounds boring.
---
its current_year and new players to eve still get a totally unusable overview but hey at least they can buy SP directly for dollars now right guys :)
---
Is this what we have to do to get you to be not afk?
---
&gt;You and your friends aren't going to do a god damn thing, because all of you are too chicken shit to put your dicks on the table.
---
at least ours can reach it
---
I kinda agree in the regard to new players needing a boost. It is daunting and kinda off putting knowing how much SP some people have and knowing how long it will take to get there. Maybe 1m skill points is not the correct way of doing so. Possibly altering how fast you train vs how many points you have to help new players catch up might be better with the boost stopping at lets say 5m.
---
If I did not have a old account to come back to (made in 07 but only 18M SP so nothing major) I dont think I would have attempted this game.
---
&gt;unless they saw one on grid
---
I mean dscan works out quite a distance
---
Considered it long ago, still don't want to.
---
Agreed
---
&gt; We also should have spoken with the CSM regarding this pack before we released it. 
---
Can I get a litre of cola?
---
Hi still trying not to, I'm dad.
---
Eve players are all either sadists, masochists or random tourists who wandered into the wrong club.
---
No, literally, you are using the drifter invasion as your reasoning. That makes you stupid. If you don't want local chat, go play in a wormhole. The idea of no local in null is seriously stupid and a bad idea. But it sounds like you are just a bad that can't get a kill so need to activate easy mode so you can catch people.
---
It feels like the jokes are nothing but callbacks now :/
---
Anarchist much?
---
danger island has been my fav of the theme seasons so far.
---
One virgin, or 72?
---
Man, what did you do to her?
---
They compete with astrahus’ for most deployed structures.
---
Do you accept contracts with trillion isk colleteral? Im willing to pay extra, no questions asked.
---
That is interesting (how they seem to be close to the exits from these holes).
---
The one complaint about that is protecting AFK players assets. The old null stations couldn't be destroyed, they just changed possession and a person could just firesale their assets to recover ISK.  I can understand why they decided on asset protection, it's not that big of deal. 
---
Maybe they could drop whatever is in the corporate hangars? I don't see how that could hurt anything. The corporation shouldn't be "AFK" so it sounds reasonable to allow any corporate owned assets to be available for loot.
---
Wally strikes again
---
It's a little late to try to put the genie back in the bottle
---
I don't know much about the type that show up in k-space (Apollo Tyrannos), but the ones that you find in high-class wormhole space (Arythmos Tyrannos) will, even without fancy AI upgrades: 
---
* fly towards you at **6,000m/s**
---
* agress, and apply perfectly, to a frigate at 400km 
---
* deal 2,000 DPS
---
* neutralize 200GJ/s
---
* point at 100KM 
---
Any single subcap and even some capitals will die to it.
---
Better get some knee pads too, or you are gonna be one sore boy.
---
U can’t kill the metal... I mean, uhh Wally
---
&gt; Edit: allow them to ignore or the dps cap as well.
---
They're already doing this even on powered structures.
---
Woulda been me but my brother heard me laughing, walked up and I started to explain it... it's just too ridiculous when you hear it for yourself.
---
WP Olmeca!
---
The fuck is he talking about?
---
How is it unusable? I came back recently from playing back in 2010-2011 and had no problem adjusting to it. You have to customize the UI, you would be hurting yourself leaving the UI as it is. 
---
Honestly should be glad with how much freedom we have in how we can alter the UI, most games dont let you even resize any elements.
---
It also depends on who is asking the questions.
---
Sorry, I totally meant a billion times better than this low effort shit.
---
&gt; You have to customize the UI, you would be hurting yourself leaving the UI as it is.
---
this is why. there are preset packs that literally every new player group recommends their new players to use. there's a reason for that.
---
unfortunately, some percentage of new players will not realize that they have to do major tinkering with the overview to get even a basic experience.
---
I think what he’s saying is spammed structures are not used so drop nothing. Typically spammed structures are low powered so not building anything
---
There's... ummm... some shit in your sink.  
---
Might wanna call a plumber.
---
Thnx for content! Upvoted!
---
Thank you ^_^
---
And?
---
Why should we care what he thinks? Why should we care if he feels validated or not?
---
I like the timing of this, I post a thread, "Shake up Null Sec" and then a short time later Drifters hit.
---
Hi,
---
As we don't live in Thera, we don't have any intel there, so we have to make the daily work of any WH corp before even accepting the contracts to ensure the safety of your package.  
---
This takes longer for us than it would for an established corp. This is why you may found our pricing expensive.
---
It would be nice, wouldn't it? :)
---
No, not at all. If you remove renters ppl will just stick to pseudo renters,  like goons and test do already.
---
100M for hauling a DST into Thera isn't too pricey, considering that if they do it at the wrong time they will zonked by Volta or the Minions or even this new group Wormholers Btw (or is that your group?)
---
I want to see them thin out massive titan blobs next
---
&gt; unfortunately, some percentage of new players will not realize that they have to do major tinkering with the overview to get even a basic experience. 
---
And that is fine, they will eventually learn that they need to customize it to be more efficient.  Just like I had to do back in 2007 when I first started. 
---
If they dont get the jist then I doubt they are trying to accomplish much in EvE.
---
I want this, that, and those and I want NPCs to do it for me. Drifter invasion is peak risk aversion
---
Yeah. The reverse "_it's not a big, it's a feature_". Only ccp could bring that.
---
I was about to trash you but now it lakes sense
---
&gt;It makes you defend your space.
---
That's the worst part tbh, Fozziesov already makes attacking not worth since you make your space weaker with low ADM, and now you add to that random IA will bash you ? heh
---
Burn my sov, burn their sov, burn everyone's. Scorch and salt the fields of nullsec.
---
I would suppose that alliances could have a code they post that the bot could read off intel channels and know to dock up... but... that would kind of give away the game in terms of plausible deniability that you didn't know about the bots.
---
Explains your cry for help
---
I am glad you exist and that we got to launch you at CCP for a year.
---
Looks like the work of the owner of that Venus razor in the right.
---
...what? That's what pvp is
---
Large empires are not defined by number of pilots, but amount of space.
---
Once you have unallocated SP on your account, you don't lose it. That said, can you inject to unallocated SP? I didn't think you could.
---
o/
---
thanks :D if some one was gunna buy plex happy they can save some money
---
1. Follow Drifter hordes
---
We do special deliveries. Please reach us as said in the main post if you have a specific need.
---
Do I think they were going to brawl willingly? hell no.   
---
Do I think we could've caught enough of them in an evac op to make them commit something? maybe.
---
I enjoyed danger island ymmv tho
---
4. Get ganked by Drifter Horde
---
Are poeple too new to the game to remember pre  citadel life? Assets were always safe.
---
Time for a change :)
---
that's not what a sink/faucet is. please go and educate yourself.
---
EXACTLY like that. It would also add a really nice alternative to the super deep, long-cycle gameplay of capsuleers. Instead of "log on and grind for a long term goal" you'd have the alt option of "log on, fuck with capsuleers and try to level up."
---
or make it a service module? like, you have to either pay for it or you don't get the benefits (and it's not going to offline when you ref to structure; however, you need to online it to get the benefits in the first place, so you need to spend the fuel all the time. basically, making it a tradeoff and not a staple feature of the hull)
---
This needs to be at the top.
---
Also, didn't know about the iskValue filter, cool!
---
Was watching the Eve North 2019 keynote and my ears rang some four minutes into the keynote, and thought that with a lot of the speculation around the Drifters lately, I thought I'd shed some light on CCP's intentions. Many of you might already be aware, but I've seen a lot of people who are still not convinced that this is planned content. I think without a doubt it can be said that the Drifter aggression is indeed a deliberate component to the game and not just something that was pulled from thin air, or otherwise mentioned is not a glitch.
---
it's not an "incoming threat"
---
it's just more red crosses to grind through until you can go and do the fun parts of the game.
---
they're rats, it's ratting.
---
On one hand, these Drifters are cool, and probably one of the best things that have happened to EVE in a long time. On the other hand, It's pretty sad that this is where CCP has gotten with their 'sandbox' game—they changed the conflict driver mechanics and ignored the economy to the point where the game stagnated and it became necessary to introduce 'theme park MMO' elements such as scripted NPC encounters in order to add "life to the universe".
---
I would have preferred CCP to focus on, you know, the life, rather than the scripts... but I think that's a lost cause now.
---
Init does whatever mittens tells them
---
I'm not around right now to play, but I'm hearing about this through reports here and there. If I'm carrier ratting or rorque mining do they just pop on grid and you're fucked? Or can you tell if they're in system and not die?
---
I would be if I hadn’t bricked my computer last week. probably for the best, though.
---
Welcome to /r/eve 2015
---
Terminal spodbrain confirmed. Brilliant CCP, fuck his shit up
---
Same way you always have?

When I lived in Catch, we gated to the ass end of hisec and then jumped to our home system.  On the way back, we jumped to an adjacent lowsec, docked, and then warped straight off the station to the gate.  When they reduced jump ranges by 10%, we had to move things around, but we could still do it with a midpoint in lowsec.
---
Having a bunch of cyno alts is annoying, but jump freighters can do one jump a minute sustainably forever, as long as you do it from safe undocks.
---
Oh know. A guy from FRT is telling on the internet. Ask Noraus to raise another 300b for you guys to lose please.
---
Oh, look at my corp with our citadels and refineries in jspace with no asset safety, guess we’re not doing anything serious.
---
It might be Branch but it seems they are better at hiding it versus Fraternity in detorid according to the data from Pelligro
---
Then enlighten us with the most efficient ways to kill them.
---
Usually games provide a benefit to not being risk-averse. Eve has gotten to the point where you get greater benefit from being risk-averse (setup an umbrella, have unfettered pop growth w/i that umbrella). Outside of wormholes, there is no tangible benefit to not joining one of those umbrellas outside of any personal feelings. It's the biggest problem with current null, you are literally worse off not in a super power and aren't rewarded in anyway for it (outside of what ever personal gratification you get from "at least I'm not blueing everyone" or whatever).
---
WTB all the things
---
Cause they come out of NOWHERE, fuck your shit up, and disappear.  lol
---
*puts on sherlock hat*
---
Foundation smeared on empires of eve book, most eve players are men, probably done by significant other, pink razor, the 2 electric toothbrushes (one pink), tweezers, charcoal facemask, pink deodrant support this.
---
Thats quite a specific book to burn, so you must have opened up to her about playing eve, so you must have formed a substantial relationship with her.
---
Her stuff is still there so this must have been an impulse thing,  op i hope your rl is ok.
---
Or you could you know... gun the thing?
---
... killing ships AND pods
---
and there is killmail about pandas jump gate
---
I absolutely understand that, I certainly was not knocking your pricing, merely asking if there was a possiblity of us working on a more serious deal to help provide logistics to my corp in Thera. Your pricing ATM, does make it unfeasible for me to use it for basic simple logistics, or to encourage it as a way to bring stuff in for line members.
---
Merely an opening to a business discussion is all, see if we can work something out :)

Ahhh, gargling mittens patented koolaid i see
---
Wormholer BTW, is my group yes :)
---
glad to see were starting to get some recognition!
---
He's a dude, or are you just trying to be rude?
---
Shit like this is why CCP needs an economist guiding their decisions. It's totally out of whack with their other offerings and has an undeniable impact on in game prices, which will affect the revenue they get from their other offers, especially Plex. I know they want to incentivize new player retention, but they're going to end up poisoning their long term revenue.
---
From a corp/alliance leadership standpoint, its a great way to track player activity. Usually for meeting activity requirements. No leadership wants their corp/alliance full of toons who never log in. Killboards are a great way to track that.  
---
On the other hand, some folks are all about making sure their killboards are all green, which I personally think is too far. But to each their own.
---
they said in their ping they were going home after SH1 keep was burned
---
tbh they should offer quick boosts to the [Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Magic_14) instead of giving un-allocated SP. Adding it to the SoE Epic Arc (Or somehow the intro NPE) would be nice.
---
&gt; unlike player ships or triglavian invading NPC, those drifters don't show up on dscan
---
Is this true, or have you just filtered them out because they're a different category?
---
omg you win
---
Just plug in [one of these bad boys](https://everef.net/type/10224)
---
Side effects may include: headaches, nausea, the Jovian disease, loss of appetite, loss of idealism, having your mind eaten by the Other, and blurred vision.
---
Gonna just keep doin it til I run out of rifters cos the same 5 matchups gets boring.
---
Yes of course and this changes everything surely
---
I've already replied to other posters who stayed more engaged in the conversation at this point and amended my initial statement based off of the exchanges. It still doesn't change the fact that I was referring to insurance payments as a sink, which they are. The part that I muddled was that the actual payouts themselves were not acknowledged as a faucet. 
---
I appreciate you following up and putting in your 2 cents though.
---
this
---
Good point! Alright you've convinced me.
---
RIP all my nullsec assets probably 😅
---
Maybe he's a drifter?
---
So, eve isn't dying ? Someone tell me what to think and what alliance to shitpost at, thanks
---
I guess the drifters dont appear in local? If not it's the prefect weapon to kill bots? Mostly Moist
---
&gt;The pack is an alternative to waiting for several weeks in order to accrue the skillpoints within it, giving a quick route to immediately training initial spaceship command and weapons skills.
---
I personally feel this is a weak argument. 
---
Why shouldn't new players have to wait for a couple of weeks before they have a perfectly fit ship? I made a new character last month, and I think new players start with the best set of skills that they ever have. You can roll off the tutorial and get into almost any kind of gameplay at the ground level. There are even plenty of options for sub-optimal fittings they could use in the meantime while they train their skills. There are more resources out there for getting into EVE than there have ever been. Immediately giving new players skill points feeds a mindset of instant gratification which is simply not compatible with the majority of gameplay in EVE.
---
&gt;Given that EVE Online is now approaching its 17th anniversary, one of the most common barriers for entry is that new players feel they can’t catch up with the years of training that many veterans have. 
---
Perhaps more effort could be directed into making clear that such players do not necessarily have an unassailable lead over anyone else, and that there are ample opportunities not only to compete with these players, but also to join them. Then again I suppose doing that doesn't sell starter packs.
---
Having only seen preroll ads on YouTube, my guess is that it's because your abilities are a function of your gear, so when you swap your gear, it's sort of like swapping your ship and/or modules on your ship.  If it's high-PVP, too, that makes sense.
---

Some people are just smarter than others, nothing to be ashamed of. But, I can see why some fear the Gold.
---
Drifters use capsuleer bodies, so it would make sense that they'd absorb enough to become a conglomeration of capsuleer complaints.
---

They nerfed build costs and made ore more plentiful multiple times since titans were released, rorquals were just buff #8.
---
PVE (EVP?) is the most exciting thing to happen to Eve in years...  Lmao
---
Me and a couple of my friends submitted support tickets under gameplay saying thanks for drifters, good work, keep it up. If you like this and think it's good for the game, which it is. Then you should submit one.
---
Tis but a flesh wound
---
Define pseudo renter?
---
If you mean Legacy members, I'd like to see you try to call TIKLE "psuedo renters" to their face. That oughta end well. If you mean Mangos well, I'm pretty sure we created Frankenstein's monster there, but that will at least be entertaining for reddit in a few months.
---
Hey love you guys good service in delve. I highly recommend these people.
---
Just an FYI, PushX is an Imperium allied entity.
---
agreed... they are killing there own plex sales simply with this event, but as you say its having a large impact on in game prices the multi training licence lost 300m value in 12 hours so far
---
It's okay mate, goons can't read.
---
If you truly believe that Bob, the god of wormholes, is causing this to happen..
---
Come and join his crusade against the nullbears.
---
Join 'Sons of Bob' and talk to a recruiter about joining 'wormholers BTW'
---
We think they are coming for us next, the orders have been given to evac non-essential ships and assets to hi-sec NPC stations.
---
MORE CHAOS.
---
MORE.
---
You brought me back to the game. You fuckers got me FCing again. I don't just want to fiddle while Rome burns, give this game LIFE.
---
I tried to join Guristas as a newbie because I had read a fiction novel based in EVE before playing the game.
---
You know what else is? Wormholes. ;)
---
Theory fell apart, they just attacked our Astrahus with nothing remotely Triglavian on grid :P
---
Scrum development in a nutshell.
---
So are drifters the true scary wormhole people.
---
cmon sappy boi gimme the straight dick and the full story
---
Titans can't DD Orcas. They CAN DD freighters and JFs though.
---
If you can single-target DD it, it's a capital.
---
Dominion sov (as opposed to pos sov which was Domination sov). To many (most?) it was the best form of large bloc sov warfare, because uncontested timers got facerolled in one cycle and big timers were all about the defenders getting enough system, cyno, and grid control that attackers with a fuckton of dreads/supers didn't just faceroll it anyway.
---
They felt it created no opportunities for small skirmishes (wrong, we had lots of subcommanders running picket fleets, auxiliaries like bombers and petes, anti bomber wings, ewar, etc) and favoured the attacker too much (maybe!). So instead of tweaking it as the major sov holders wanted, they flipped it into a bastardization of faction warfare that nobody was happy with, from minute 1.
---
&gt;We understand that we made a misstep with this DLC pack by not restricting it
---
if ccp think that was the misstep, they're fucking retarded  beyond belief.
---
Yea, but there's some funny stuff that's cheaper too, like this cloaky salvage Malediction with 500m pod. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77504724/

Oh, thank you. I thought this had something to do with jews, I kept trying to figure out what language cos it's close to Italian, but that's supposed to be an o. That makes sense. :P

Amen brother

Shame it was you though :P

I spent a year in a C3 before moving to nullsec. 
---
\#beentheredonethatnotgoingback
---
 I don't think they are mutually exclusive. I would still encourage a world that was more "alive" and increased interaction with the world. Players should be the main drivers, but not the only thing that drives content
---
SO lol :) is there an annoucement when the drifter pop in your system? 
---
The isk cash will drop a lot at the next mer; we all gonna be poor by losing stuff!
---
Some have been known to do it.
---
do you have the source for this comment from vily? corpmate was asking
---
Learn to read moron.
---
That's his point.
---
Just \_REMOVE\_ the Magic 14. At this point they're as relevant to the new player experience as learning skills. Just get people undocking and pewpewing.
---
I was told that some AG linked players drove one out of Kamio by bumping him continuously.
---
The announcement is when people cry in local
---
Making the default UI of a game usable when a player first logs in is a fairly important step to retention.
---
Sansha, Trigs and now Drifters. This really is CCP's "War in Heaven"
---
Pretty sure you can shoot lancers to bring them
---
Take 5 seconds to think about how a power might deal with pests like horde in their region from far away. Vs unknown new drifters that may or may not show up for armor timers. If you don't understand that it's fucking stupid we have to pull back because ccp intervened in a conflict then you sir need to chill on that cool aid.
---
&gt;While skillpoints are an important part of EVE, ironically, they don’t make a more skilled pilot. They simply open a wider range of options to explore in terms of fitting, piloting and playstyle
---
Cool.  Then next step should be to give everyone Max skills.
---
so much this, people can keep memeing on about this helping the game by hurting nullblocks but they dont consider the implications for the future of the game introducing npcs to do activities traditionally done by players causes.
---
Awww jealous much
---
Oh they have killed citadels before on their own, interesting.
---
Damn the salt is thick
---
I'm really hoping this just shits on renter space.
---
Have you heard her voice?
---
Define "pseudo renters"? We have renters, and coalition members. Coalition members are expected to defend their own fucking space.
---
&gt; NPCs now can ruin your day and not on your own terms. 
---
Doubtful.
---
If this unannounced "feature" is here to stay, it will be figured out and min-maxxed, just like everything else in Eve.
---
Once that happens, r/Eve will go back to sperging and bitching and crying because someone else did a thing and its not fair because they can't do the thing...
---
It's a never ending cycle on this sub.
---
NPC Null is in a really good place, just need more activity. I feel most new players have no idea Null NPC exists.
---
Wait what,[ I bought a Star Pack last week and it was $50](https://imgur.com/YHShsx9). Is it on sale right now? My account that I bought it on says it can't buy it again, on another account that hasn't bought it it is listed for $25. (but no mention of it being a sale)
---
You can dodge the dd in subcaps.
---
Idunno what's goin on with Mangos, I keep hearing about bots, but nothing from diplo office, and not a lot of obvious bot frags on zkill. Are they botting? Are they awoxing? Are they just kinda there?
---
Well you have two options: Pay their price or haul it yourself.  Seems like you've already decided.
---
Not really. Stuff that used to work sometimes doesn't now since squiz made changes a little bit ago.
---
Don't forget to make use buddy links on those accounts +750k sp and reward for "inviting" new players on top of it.    
---
If you don't claim this 750k you can slowly train this char to 5mil sp, dropp it then and extract it.            
---
BTW : there is plenty people doing similar stuff right now, aka making 20 alpha accounts.    
---
Training them to free 5mil sp, while gathering the "free" SP and keeping this 750k sp.           
---
**When the char reach 5mil sp - they will be able to pull 2 injectors from it just by pulling this "free SP"**         
---
#20 alpha accounts created this way give you 40 injectors at the cost of extractors.               
---
/u/ccp_falcon ccp is aware of this, right?
---
If you watch his stream, you can clearly see he's a man. A man with a high pitched voice, but a man nonetheless.  
---
 I can tell you he's a dude, and he refers to himself as a dude. So I'll ask you again, are you so triggered by him that you are misgendering him to be rude?
---
For me, the skillpoint issue is only half the reason I stopped playing EvE. The arguably bigger reason is the game feels very complex to me on the surface. It may not actually be, but the UI doesn't help. If there was a way for me to learn fairly quickly in a way that allowed me to explore and learn more on my own, instead of constantly having to refer to a wiki or something, I might return.
---
Why do you write "current_year" when you know this is 2019?
---
I didn't make this thread with all due respect.
---
I saw the leader of push made a post, and I politely mentioned that I had considered his service but found it too expensive to be palatable for my corporation.
---
I merely mentioned that if he wanted to discuss something larger, more formal, i'd be open to it.
---
Exactly the sort of thing he wanted to do with his post, contacting sov re: a JF service.
---
I didn't bash his service, I just threw something out there. I love pushx.
---
lol look at who's triggered
---
Or at least roll them up into a max of like 3-5 maybe 2x skills. With a lot more bonuses rolled into a fewer skills it won't look like such a dump to train (look how much you get for each level sort of thing) and then they don't have to scrap the idea entirely.
---
The pseudo renters are getting up in arms by the reference :joy:
---
There is a reason those DLC packs are limited to 1 purchase per account
---
There would be far less "life" without local.
---
More activity would mean more danger, and the powers that be can't have that.
---
&gt;	We’re very aware of the community’s concerns regarding “pay to win” mentality and microtransactions that would take EVE in that direction. Let me be abundantly clear that this is not the intention.
---
We already have pay to win you dunce it’s called plex and injectors, the community is mad because you’re literally fabricating SP out of thin air on a direct, purchaseable, repeatable basis AND that functionality, if left unfixed pegs 1M SP at 5$ USD - a MASSIVE devaluation of SP compared to the price of plex against the price of injections + the loss higher sp chars take
---
But skins and Plex sales
---
Can you? Because the internet says you can't:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2yixck/can_an_orca_get_doomsdayed/
---
If you mean bots sure
---
If you mean me spamming local, I would hope it works like in a wormhole and I can "open local" to shit it up?
---
Right, so you're just rude, and you don't like getting called out on it.  
---
Thanks for the downvotes, retard! :wave:
---
This isn't even posting I. This is what happens when you try to post without Posting injected.
---
Giving (or rather selling) SP to new players isn't gonna with player retention.
---
Having created an alt few days ago, I can say that the main problem is the new player experience which is absolutly terrible. There's no point in giving new players tons of SP if they don't know what to do with them. 
---
The tutorials and first few hours of a game is what should be refined the most.
---
re-read my comment...
---
I'm sure there's something I haven't thought of that makes this unfeasible, but my gut reaction to this is that it'd be a good compromise between protecting player assets and rewarding attackers for actually attacking and doing the timer grind we all are so very fond of.
---
Careful avery the UI team might actually do something and you know how well that goes every time they get clever
---
that's an interesting question, penif. sure, I could have written 2019. and my message would have still come across. however, I felt that adding in a small internet reference would add an element of humor which would serve to slightly soften the criticism of ccp games while also providing a chuckle to some readers.
---
when I first discovered memes in high school, I was guilty of pronouncing the word like “me-me’s” and “may-mays.”
---
as horrible as this is, the pronunciation of the word didn’t take away from the immediate connection myself and others felt with these memes.
---
it’s difficult to give a single definition to memes. there are different genres of memes in addition to the many subgenres. simply, a meme is an image or video on the internet that’s intended to be funny. this is usually achieved by placing text over the media or have it contain something humorous in general.
---
we see them everywhere. some websites, like reddit and tumblr, are breeding grounds for all things memes. other social media like facebook and twitter are flooded with them as well.
---
upon discovering memes in high school, I created a community page within a meme website where I invited other students to create memes about their school life. I remember writing an editorial similar to this one for my high school newspaper around time, so some things don’t change.
---
another thing that doesn’t change is the connection that memes can create within a community. when my peers and I created tasteful memes about our school and teachers, it gave us all common ground to come together and share a laugh.
---
memes are supposed to be relatable. they should be selfies of the soul, giving Internet life to our everyday occurrences. they brought people together at my high school and they do the same thing on a larger scale across the world. memes can be enjoyed by people across different cultures because they’re often a universal language, much like basic rhythms in music.
---
what’s trending at the moment has a hand in the creation of memes. when president donald trump accidentally tweeted something with the word “covfefe” in it, the internet used it as an opportunity to create a plethora of memes. since trump is in the world spotlight, these were memes that could be enjoyed by a larger number of people across cultures. it’s truly magical when people from around the world can come together in the creation of this kind of content.
---
there’s also a sense of nostalgia that goes into some genre of memes. memes related to tv shows people watched as kids, such as spongebob squarepants and arthur, seem to resonate more with them because of their nostalgic weight.
---
memes have weaved their way into our everyday culture. not a day goes by where we don’t see a meme and share it with someone we know. that’s the thing about memes: they’re sharable so that they can bring us closer together.
---
&gt; training time: 1 lifetime

Sounds like a business plan, how could they???

Didn't realize that part of the wiki required logon.  If you want the flash version it can be found here:  [http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/cldfury/tslb.swf](http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/cldfury/tslb.swf)  just be warned that it's peak 2006 flash animation and may not be hold up well when compared to the high powered memes of 2019.  
---
If you're really bored and have nothing better to do you might be able to find a text version buried somewhere in the old eve-o thread:   [https://eve-search.com/thread/334258-0/page/1](https://eve-search.com/thread/334258-0/page/1)
---
I partially agree with this.
---
What happens seems pretty cool and is at least throwing everyone a little out of balance, which is a good thing. On the other hand it's sad (to say the least) that CCP fucked everything up so horribly that this is needed to somewhat solve something (we still don't really know what they are wanting to do with this).
---
My hope would be that this is some kind of "catsclism" staged by CCP to somewhat correct some mistakes and, after the intended objective is achieved it goes away or at least gets reduced.
---
Truth is that CCP fucked up beyond belief the past years, maybe this is a way to "clear the board" and start fixing some of the core problems of the game.
---
Hope is the last thing we lose I guess.
---
They haven't been able to work out getting back yet, but if they ever do they'll still be far more advanced than anything in New eden
---
I just figured it would be with the capitalised nouns and sentence structure feeling decidedly German. :)

Lurker here for years, good IRL friend plays the game. Had to see what the excitement was all about. And all I see while reading this stuff is [this scene from American Gods].(https://youtu.be/Rg2jbFteS-U?t=40)

I'll also offer them water so they can

Stay hydrated Drifters.  You've got a lot of AFKers, bots, carebears, and structures to burn.
---
Ah okay.
---
Yeah they had some nerd in a hecate camping a station but would dock up if anything bigger than a covops frigate or astero undocked lol
---
I have a question. I sometimes lurk in the /r/Eve as I enjoy reading about the drama but I don't play eve. 
---
I have an account that I made in beta/pre-release/early-release week. It's over 15+ years old. 
---
I only logged onto this account a few times over the years for about 2 weeks, each time doing the early training tutorial missions in the hopes of playing the game but life always got in the way and I had to step away from it. 
---
Last time I logged back into this account was probably 2016 for about a week and trained some random piloting skills. I bought a plex and a ship that was probably too fancy and some other frigate, somewhere in high sec space wherever I happened to be parked. 
---
Would it be worth continuing on this account or should I make a new account? I do have some skills on it. 
---
The thing I noticed about it is that I don't show any employment history, not even the NPC corp. That window is just blank. When I first made the account I never joined or made a player corp. Does that make any difference like if I  wanted to join some player corp or alliance? Would an old account like this throw up some red flags or make people suspicious? I know people tend to be paranoid in this game. 
---
here is the account in question
---
http://eveboard.com/global/pilot/Mad_Dog
---
Also is it better to run the game via Steam or via the website client? Any reasons to run one or the other?
---
Saying sleepers are drifters is incorrect, they're not the same, "matrix" or not.
---
been asking ccp about it, they aren't.
---
I did.  You feeling alright?
---
When you inject an injector it gives you unallocated SP, correct? Then you apply it?
---
Does this include the double-shielded versions with doomsday? Or is that just the hisec variant? I haven't followed k-space drifter mechanics too much.
---
I generally like the idea of better AI as it allows the environment to react to you which keeps it from being static. Also it can make PvE more interesting - I mean the coolest thing in EvE is how your actions can cause effects but thats not possible with PvE atm. 
---
Maybe it should?
---
Looks like you broke Rule 1 of life, my dude. Never stick your dick in crazy.
---
I wrote a [thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/c6abxl/story_time_that_time_when_i_worked_customer/) I've tried to start a few times before. It's a teeny bit long.

Maybe settle in with one a little less crazy next time.

&gt; Triangleboi shit

Are they attracted to bling or something? Almost every kill is over 1.3 billion ISK.
---
Yeah the math doesn’t work in USD, our star pack is $50 and our mega plex bundle is $500.
---
Something needed to be done.  Null life is the safest space. I hope it all burns to the ground.
---
Is it just me or is has their 0.0 activity died off since today's downtime? im watching info and kb's from work and this seems to be the case from what I can tell.
---
&gt;anyone would think CCP just deleted Delve
---
The mere thought makes me tingly.
---
Everyone else has to adapt, but not Goons.
---
He's a goon. Guess again.
---
Then learn to interpret what you read, because your answer doesn't relate to my comment.
---
Sorry for the uncalled for insult, will edit.
---
There's a filter in the url /iskValue/1000000000/ which omits anything cheaper than 1b
---
That's been the goon narrative, as though they know what a "small guy" is.
---
You have to be omega status to extract I think
---
They could rectify that relatively reasonably by having it do a check as it enters armor, or hull. Either one knows if it was fueled up until that point.
---
Just saying, if it's a nice idea then it is, it's not like ccp doesn't make changes or add things. There never was any such thing as low power just a little bit ago. :p
---
Was your alliances eviction from syndicate a few years ago related to over recruitment or activity or something? I'm generally in the dark, but vaguely aware of your group. Seriously asking, not trying to troll or anything.
---
You wrote all that without ever actually answering my question. Aside from the fact that "current_year" isn't really a meme, why are you trying to "soften" your criticism of CCP? Are you trying to protect the feelings of any devs that happen to read your post? Or are you really just attempting to protect the carefully crafted laid-back image you've created for yourself over the years?
---
That's really not the optimal solution to bots is it.  I mean if you're going to do anything you can to prevent them, just walk over to the server and turn off the power.
---
But dscan doesn't work on drifters
---
I think you're somewhat overestimating the number of hours in the day the devs work.
---
Sad!
---
Yea turns out those ones don't appear of dscan. Get fucked lmao
---
What if ccp tried to make an AI (skynet) and the AI (skynet) started taking over. (Skynet) skynet
---
Oh, did Mittens call him that? Did not notice.
---
No, you see, everyone is basing things off of what a single GM has said. That has happened in the past and the GM ended up being wrong. So yeah, confirmation from someone on the development team is more in line with "official" when it comes to programming issues. GMs are CSRs, nothing more.
---
I think it has more to do with reporting. Nobody really bothers with Branch tbh.
---
From the patterns I've been seeing, it seems they're hitting areas where theres a lot of players and high strategic areas. Maybe tied into adm, strategic index, and amount of structures?
---
Weird trippy shit that's fucking everything up that no one has a clue how it works? As an ex early wormhole dweller Im definitely considering coming back to test.
---
Can you explain this a little more? What lore ship was destroyed?
---
For you to be able to fly a drifter ship it would need to be modified to be capsules compatible. Concord kills you by basically forcing your ship / pod to self destruct through a backdoor that is also part of making a ship compatible. So sadly daddy Concord can always kill you
---
y tho
---
well, given they can fit a DD to a battleship, they're pretty scary
---
yeh so you just make another account like i said, buy the star pack and whalla another 5.8b isk... then never login to the account again..
---
very true i hinted at this :D
---
was there a joke somewhere? i think you are missing all the basic components of a joke let alone something amusing soooo the joke is your posting?
---
it is on sale yeh its reduced it says £19.50 worth £60 it doesnt sale sale
---
Lol damn u mad.  Bee man mad
---
Have a blast dude. The game has something for everything and will only get more exciting as the current events unfold
---
Drifter Titan when?
---
Like I said, k-space drifters (Apollo and Artemis) are different. The stats I laid out are valid for wormhole variants, the ones you find in C5 and C6 sites.
---
I also hold high level Eve corporate contract negotiations on Reddit.
---
A well written and even somewhat revealing article, nice work Falcon.  CCP letting us know player retention rates and sales figures is kind of new; and I think we can all agree that 4% player retention rate will eventually catch up and end the game for all of us.
---
However, speaking as someone who purchased the pack on all five of my accounts, not putting a hard cap (or even diminishing returns!) on the 1 million SP to emphasize its use for newbros was a mistake.  Is selling this pack cause for Burn Jita 2.0 as a lot of the pitchfork wielding bittervets on this sub would have you believe?  Absolutely not.  Are there better, less abusable ways to help out new bros that veterans can't expolit?  Most definitley.
---
This article sounds a lot like CCP being open and truly trying to do what's best for the community (and therefore ultimately, what's best for their bottom line) and doing the prototypical micro-transaction meltdown slope.  I hope their next way to help newbros leans on some of the lessons from this; and maybe even glean some of the knowledge and ideas proposed by people who have been playing/living this game for a decade.
---
Good shit CCP, keep it up and do right by us; and we'll keep this thing going for another 10 years.
---
It got deleted? This sounds pretty interesting I want to read it.
---
Reposted in self instead of a sub and updated link, I suck at reddit apparently.
---
The default UI is not that bad. It can get the job done with you are just playing casual, just need to resize a little and your good. 
---
&gt; If they dont get the jist then I doubt they are trying to accomplish much in EvE. 
---
What I mean by this if you plan to start doing WH, PvP, or exploring the default UI is somewhat going to hold you back when trying to achieve your end goal. However at this point it should kinda be common sense that you have to customize your UI.
---
\**voila*

Really extra low effort shit.

Battlecruiser operational.
---
Please please PLEASE let the eve gate open and Terrans roll through in nastier-than-titan battlecruisers, somewhat like to the fallen empires of stellaris with a thousand years of repeatable weapon techs researched. Something like 3-5 BCs and 8-16 destroyers should equal a full pirate BS fleet in power. 
---
Let there be tens of those scout squads which spread thru New Eden and then 2-3 or so capital deathballs that can nuke a single coalitions super deployment so either we work together or I guess move to WH's and pray the Terrans wont happen to scout our hole.
---
Sorry, I got excited for a minute
---
Ughhh why does the new and excited things start in eve right when i have to go afk for a few months
---
It's fiction to say eve is not p2w just because there's a mere possibility that a new player can kill a much higher sp player.
---
P2w isn't Boolean, but a sliding scale; given equal gaming knowledge, high sp characters have a paid-for advantage over new players every time.
---
The only way a lower sp character can win is if the higher sp character lacks the "skill" to make the right decision. That is, ccp's argument that it's not p2w only works if you imbalance the comparison by giving the high sp player a crippling trait of stupidity.
---
That's not an apples to apples comparison. In fact that argument exposes how lopsided this game has become in favor of those who can afford to buy all the sp and ships they need - game knowledge being equal.
---
Can you give examples of situations where this breaks sandbox for you?
---
We're super rich, but not all assholes.
---
Big boii in the story is though
---
Do the drifters ever get blapted? I don't see any losses on their side.

It's really too bad your post is not original nor relevant.

Could be, everything is posible I guess.

Maybe....
---
I want daily sp quests/missions. Here comes the downvotez
---
If you look at the MPTC prices today this is what I was trying to articulate. If  one only have one account and spare ISK buy 24 MPTC today and extract all year. The profit of selling injectors in 6 months time at highs when you bought all your account time at a 25% discount to everyone else = win.
---
Wouldn't it be better for retention if 1-2m SP were given as a reward at the end of the SoE Epic or something? As long as that's clearly communicated early in the NPE, that at the end of this tutorial road you get a fat chunk of SP to play with, I think people would be more receptive to it than putting it behind a paid DLC. 
---
It also helps discourage abuse because who's going to play through the entire NPE and the Epic Arc over and over again just to give their SP farms a bit of a head start? At that point go on mate, you deserve it.
---
Can I join the Drifters, they seem pretty leet.
---
There is a Hot/Crazy ratio I use in life.... this chick must be a looker...

There was no lore ship concerning Caroline’s Star - you’re thinking of something years farther back, where the ship of Lianda Burreau (the person and ship in the chronicle you mention) was found in W-space carrying trinary data. The player who found it did as you said and blew it up.
---
But that happened FAR before Caroline’s Star, by years - nothing was lost for that, but in-character there’s so much we just don’t know (read the chron “Inheritance” for a WHOLE bunch of out of character info on it though)
---
lol i didnt even realise it was a real word :D im english so we just write this shit like whalla and think its a made up word we invented haha
---
Haha my b, was responding to a few things at work when I replied. Yes, that's the truth, and another way of proving it's not a Capital.

The primary way being it requires no Capital skills to operate, at all.

Your karma count indicates your posts are shit.

No worries good sir.
---
I JUST saw that one lol. Fucking F
---
As a dev I don't see much wrong with trying something out and then abandoning it if it doesn't work out.  There's a kind-of selection effect at play.
---
So the drifters just want to bring balance to new eden? Thanos approves.
---
It's pretty fucked up, to be honest.
---
They're aware of a barrier to entry, and instead of just removing it entirely, they decide it's best to charge a fee instead.
---
well   with ship with 99% resists takes while
---
but  max dps carrier will die to drifter dd in kspace. seen many carrier,dread deaths  t drifters.   and  drifters can solo  our supercarrier if  fitted incorrectly
---
We don't need to blue them. All the devs are in PL anyway, we knew about this weeks ago.
---
Ooh yeah, that too I guess. Pretty significant in a game where the limit to the power of an organization seems to be how many players they can mobilize.
---
It's positive, and in the thousands. But thanks for your concern.
---
Would've given him longer to whine in comms. Oh man I hope we get some good recordings of dudes whining in comms about this stuff.

Idk if you’ve ever happened to see (https://forums.eveonline.com/t/ship-design-precursor-drifter-shipline-and-modules/81559/1)[this thread] - I’ve been hoping for the same thing for a long time, and the “Precursor” designator makes it seem like it’s only a matter of time until Drifter ships become playable in some way.

Exhumers weren't nerfed during the last balance pass.  They actually recieved a small buff in the form of stronger links if you use a rorq to boost.
---
1. Anyone using a POS in k-space and losing anything significant is a moron.  In fact, it's because it was so much safer to store things in outposts or stations that using a POS was dumb.
---
2. The systems where asset safety moves items tend to be camped, and are frankly harder to get things out of than where the stuff originally was, not to mention, you lose weeks waiting for it to get there.  The only time this would be an advantage would be in a *complete* eviction, which frankly isn't very common.
---
I agree that using asset safety to evac loot is dumb, although it's hard to fix.
---
yea nobody wants to play the game when instakill + podding npcs are roaming around and shooting on sight
---
who couldve seen this coming
---
Most of thus event scares the crap out of me. 
---
Honestly it's an awesome feeling for a game...."one day I'll go into null sec...."
---
Could just as easily have a random canister just kinda show up in system until someone looted it and say "oh this is remains of the destroyed ship". There's no way they would have put in work into a whole big lore thing and then been like oh well a player killed it so guess we're not doing that. XD

evryone remember  the npc mining fleet event when   regular diamond miners  spawned and  fob miners spawned at same belt this resulted in endless fight both forces sending infinite fleets
---
Yes they do get killed but as being an NPC their losses do not count, only player stuff shows up on zkill.
---
Thera has static’s, it’s a wormhole
---
i belive   it wont be hard to introduce,they are already in and they have   slot layouts   but for npc use. it will be tuned down for  player use.  it would be fun to see a bs with 8 high 8med 8 low slots.  but if it gonna have 5 high 5med 7low it would be still enjoyable
---
Oh that makes sense. Thanks o7
---
So, Triglav' invasion, AND Drifter poping Structures ?
---
* they don't show up on dscan and are unscanable.
---
* they don't respect damage cap mechanics. aka they can wipe your fortizar quite fast. 
---
* I know you failed for the bait post,  but think a bit. This is not a '' mechanic'' small alliances can deal with, nor is it reasonable.
---
* they seem to be OP, the golden ammo NPC, a lazy dev hack.
---
Overall it's a mixed bag.  If suddenly there's no asset safety, eve players will, as always, adapt.  I would not expect nearly as many assets to be stored in these structures, particularly for players not in the super-blobs.  Those same super-blobs would also be far more aggressive at removing attacking structures, since there's a chance to inflict actual damage (such as Simple Farmers in Catch.)
---
The inclination therefore would move activity closer to NPC stations, which would once again be 100% asset safety, as they always have been.  This may be a nice buff for combat in those regions, but likely results in the giant carebear lands being even more full of carebears as none of the rare pvpers would be likely to have many ships on standby to form for defense.  We'd probably just see a token blob and the continuation of the supercap umbrella dropping on anything that moves.
---
So, ironically, the biggest beneficiaries of asset safety removal are the largest groups in the game;  they continue to have absolute structure safety, and their opponents can't stage anything outside limited NPC null, or otherwise they're motivated to steamroll them for loot.  Deep space becomes even safer.
---
Really, the transition period is the most damaging, but frankly I just don't see much of a benefit to removing it, and plenty of disadvantages.
---
Because it doesn't conform to the reddit narrative du jour.
---
I haven't heard any specific complaints about Mango, just the "they're chinese so they must be botters" crap. I'm referring more to that future point when they likely outgrow us.
---
God that would be such a cool update. Something interfering with capsuleers' intel always has my vote.
---
The diminishing returns are based on your total number of skill points before you inject each injector. The fact that you have unallocated skill points does not affect anything because unallocated skill points are included in your total skill points.
---
For example, if you have 4,999,999 skill points (one skill point shy of 500k to 400k drop) and you inject 1 large injector, you will get 500,000 skill points, giving you a total of 5,499,999 sp. If you inject another injector, you'll then get 400,000 skill points for a total of 5,899,999 sp.
---
More please

/u/drifter_battleship i'm shooting a decloaked transmission relay!

Is players killing meaningless spawned npcs to get paid by another, faceless npc with money generated out of thin air any more "a part of the sandbox" than npcs shooting player structures?
---
You literally can already buy skill points. 
---
1. Buy Plex, sell Plex, buy injectors. 
---
2. Buy Plex, exchange Plex for extractors, use extractors, use injectors.
---
3. Buy bundles which can include extractors, use extractors, use injectors.

The Goon autism has been strikingly absent from r/eve the last 24 hours. Maybe they're too busy adapting?

I don't know, but I think today is a great time to go undock the shiniest ships you have and test it out in a belt.
---
Yes, the "line GM" was something Mittens said on the *emergency fireside*. Just be aware, any GM's word about whats happening has more weight than what any of us has to say. If gsf leadership calls it a fuckup but a GM says its "working as intended" and there is no statement beyond that then CCP's state on this is "working as intended".
---
Please stop, I can only get so hard.
---
Which 4 nations exactly are you referring to?
---
My worry is that it's just not as big as we want it to be.  Be like a little nose bleed but nothing or real.consequence
---
Let's hope not
---
Perfect change, null-sec should be hard to earn and keep so new groups can get their feet wet.
---
I steal exploration all the time from Test and Goons and there are far too many systems with 0 pilots in them.  If you are that far spread out, there needs to be a way for the game to punish you on it.
---
=============================
---
A healthy number of average pilots per system I would say is \~10-15, so if these drifter waves can be fought off with 50 characters at a scheduled time there really is no excuse to whine about structures being lost.
---
Woh slow down tiger, was just asking a question
---
&gt;If they dont get the jist then I doubt they are trying to accomplish much in EvE.
---
I fucking hate this mentality. Just because you managed to figure out the god awful interface doesnt mean it shouldnt be improved.
---
UI problems are one of the biggest complaints of new players. Having a default UI, and especially overview, that makes sense within the first minutes of playing the game is critical for player engagement and retention.
---
Oh boy what did I miss
---
&gt; would revitalize the entire vet community.
---
Damn right it would.
---
With the Trigs, there was *years* of buildup, in varying directions, that finally culminated in the Invasions.
---
And lo, almost as if responding, from the sky came a horde of Drifters, and each voice speaking from a thousand mouths, they said in unison: “Fuck You, Null.”
---
Yep, there's not a ton that can bring me back to eve but all of the things your describing are awesome ideas that would make me interested in the game.
---
Like, new fucking content. Give us some really sweet weapons or different shit, change up core pieces of the game. I've never really deeply cared about balance changes one way or the other aside from when supers were a little too busted.
---
But at this point all eve players want is cool and new shit to do.
---
No it shouldnt. I should be able to have a friend be able to boot up the default client as an alpha, and join me in a pvp fleet without doing anything more than accepting a fleet invite.
---
&gt;A skill &amp; damage booster
---
Pardon me but… damage booster ? As in only available by DLC or as one of the drug already in game ?
---
Nothing new would ever be created if you only ever did things you knew for certain would work out.
---
PV-CCP. FML.
---
Hey there, just saw this thread and wanted to say hi! I write Empires of EVE and run the Kickstarter project. The updates are pretty long, sorry if the basic info is hard to find. Right now specific dates are up in the air (small projects don't get a ton of say in printing/shipping speed.) Right now I'm in the editing phase of the second book, and making decisions about what's going to be in the final draft.  I'm pushing to be done in the next couple of months. :-) Working hard to get this thing across the finish line.
---
I feel like they did this about 7 years ago.
---
Same tbh.
---
What else would it be? Do you really expect anything big to happen to the game through PVP at this point?
---
Lmao “nothing from diplo office”, yeah cause Dran and his cronies will for sure tell you line member #171024 wether or not the new blues they just added to the never ending list are boring.
---
Get back to esoteria and rorq mine and don’t ask questions and go on goku fleets to destroy frat
---
Or just a magic 14 epic arc. 14 missions and they have IV or V on all the magic 14?
---
This, so much
---
But it's so fun! For a short while that is...
---
its okay the drifter did more damage to legacy than  Frat and winterco combined today. Figure that one out
---
it is a meme
---
I'm sorry you're dense
---
That sir was quality posting. Avatar legend of Aang great fucking series
---
No, it wouldnt.
---
I came back 2 months ago, jumped into my Hyperion and started a level 4 mission.
---
DED &lt;Faction&gt; &lt;Ship&gt; is NOT in the edit overview list.  Had to click ships in space and add to overview.  Still finding things to add that aren't in there.  The Carrier in that SOE arc mission was the most recent one I added.
---
That is a major problem.
---
But the difference is that extractors take away points trained over time on a character, not just instantly summon them from CCP's butt.  
---
However, even the whole inject/extract thing is touted as bad for the same P2W-feels newbies are gonna get. What newbie can afford those injectors and the additional power they represent? My main has 76mil SP, having originally started in 2006, and I make sod-all ISK still now that I'm back in the game. If I want game time with ISK, the only way I'm gonna make that much is by extracting existing skills, never mind having the ISK to buy injectors to use on myself or my alts. I've quickly come to learn that shit's really gotten out of control since I last played properly back in 2013.  
---
Frankly the whole SP system is pretty bad, but at the same time almost impossible to majorly overhaul without driving many of the remaining players away, because of whole heavy involvement of real money.
---
MRE punishment 😉
---
Winter co , Imperium , Dead Co , Legacy,   . i wont Count PANFAM There getting glassed right now
---
I disagree, it’s awesome
---
maybe. It's annoying tho, pls stop
---
Im glad its annoying, thats the point :D
---
Is it realistically viable to pay for game time extensions through play? Im a huge scifi fan and have always had the dream of being a space pilot. However the pay to play model of MMOs has always kept me away. If I dropped the $130 for a year subscription is it possible to extend that time without adding funds to my account?
---
Any advice you can give to someone on the fence about joining Eve is appreciated!
---
Finally, someone who will undock that I can shoot at.
---
Oh god this would actually be amazing
---
**Thanos Tyrannos**
---
So long as they destroy Fortisars, jump bridges and ships that can shoot, I don’t give a damn.
---
Now that they’re also targeting Orca’s... that’s a different kettle of fish altogether.
---
I don't think you truly understand how many corms you would need for that.
---
Yea I get that but they could have jist dropped invasion and left it instead of telling us their comming over and over again. Like there should have been a event in abyss t5s in the world arc room where a players sees it moving and gets "followed" out think of the cinematic trailer if should have started like that it would habe at least been interesting. Like why are they atking random systems why arent they focusing on abyss players or systems with a lot of abyss activity.. Idk
---
I didnt like invasion it feels half assed and them telling us it was coming didnt help. It should have been a suprise and it shouldnt JUST be hs..
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/nullsec/ this is the link without the isk filter so you can see all the lost ships that are lower value

im not in volta tho eww
---
Wormhole space, especially thera is not safe.
---
You should make an instaundock.
---
excuse me?  Horde hasn't been touched.   and the only ones in panfam who got "glassed" were the tribute renters, not even mainline NCPL.
---
also seriously? dead co?  either your clueless or a member of dead co.
---
The UI would be even more cluttered if CCP had to incorporate everything into a default UI. With how much content is in eve you must customize the UI if you want to play serious.
---
There have been a variety of ways similar to this.  A temporary sale on packs is nothing to get in a twist about.
---
The 66% off galaxy packs were even bigger.
---
#MAKE EVE DANGEROUS AGAIN
---
i would like see more interventions from ccp, this creates more content, shakes up the game, and maybe saves it from the boredom empire^^ And if they want the cashflow to get bigger, this will help, because its content which is available to all players, in all timezones, without restrictions. Only the die hard eve players still argue with that sandbox bs. Its 2019, get over it, every form of content is good !!!
---
Learning skills and Advanced learning skills... jesus, that was tedious.
---
We departed from Syndicate because it was getting stale. Eviction is hardly the word for it.
---
.botcheck
---
I am not saying it's perfect, what I am saying is that it would be extremely hard to make a default UI that incorporates all the stuff you can do in EvE and make it understandable. It's just not possible and why we have so much customization options.
---
There used to be one a couple of years ago, idk what happened but it got replaced with this agency shoot an NPC for 10+ mission crap.
---
Thank you Andrew! Just finished the first book and really enjoyed it. Wish you the best in all future developments!
---
I think putting a Noob Arc in would be simultaneously teaching, and rewarding. Allow Noobs the chance to fast forward to a truly useful ship meanwhile not being worth the time of Exploiters to pursue, therefore making the system immune to exploit.
---
If you're that broke dude, you need Wormhole space.
---
having some random t5 runner accidentally start the first invasion would have been awesome. imagine being that player and just seeing everything in your local area go to shit after you found the special room in the abyss.
---
Excuse me? Did you just offend my coalition?  I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Eve-Uni, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on highsec, and I have over 300 confirmed zkillboard kills. I am trained in mining warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire game. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies in highsec and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can mine in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in mining, but I have access to the entire arsenal of ORE and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of eve, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
---
I'm interested where it has been posted before and why it is not relevant given that is one of the largest complaints in the game right now. 
---
It's honestly not surprising that a Goon has something critical to say. After all, you have the most to lose from a change like that. Your opinion has been noted though. Too bad it's not relevant.
---
I play exodia. What do I win
---
excellent. Bob protects us for now.
---
With a better default overview it would be dramatically better.
---
SS?
---
Its not about cluttering the screen, all they have to do is make a few key windows and settings present the correct information from default.
---
I had an idea for that when there still was a Captain’s Quarters.
---
So many things could have been done with the Captain’s Quarters.
---
I should really apply for a job with CCP but they’d never take me.
---
Not showing up in dscan doesn't break mechanics. Unprobeable and ignoring damage caps does. Not sure if small alliances can deal with this or not. Need more examples.
---
There are no drifters in stain it is the only safe haven from the coming storm.
---
I think it's ingenious. It's made isk selling websites almost obsolete. I've been able to recycle sp that I was no longer using. And for vets it's awesome!  Oh want another carrier toon? Fine inject and done. I think it opens up the game for newbros too, gets em up to speed and ready to learn the tactics for fleet comps instead of wasting months grinding away.
---
I would tbh, it's pretty easy to afk and gives you the isk to buy books without connecting it to an owner character so you can make clean alts
---
Screenshots or it didn’t happen.
---
Given it started yesterday I can only imagine due to citadel timers there being jump gates killed so far. Give it a week
---
Damn. You're good
---
Lol no. Im not an olmeca fan but his shit post was legit
---
u/stainguy maybe they’ll finally create your lowsec gate to stain
---
Bit like how wormholes came to eve long ago... It took ages for people to figure out the mechanics.
---
Or be killed by it? :D
---
yeh that was also amazing :D
---
I see no problems here
---
I'd day yes, after a years subscription you would have the necessary skills, experience and knowledge to be able to sustain your sub by getting Omega state using in game currency. It's not an easy task but that 1 year sub would help a lot to get all the things set up for generating enough isk to sub your account. But first things first, I would really suggest you just create the alpha (free) account and try the game for a month or so before subbing. Eve universe is a strange place and not everyone likes it. A month or so would help you decide if eve is for you or not
---
Also it was this event that CCP used to  rollout FAXs. That the amarr empire could've saved her if they had FAXs
---
Can you imagine the salt that would have occurred if this happened before the SH1 Keepstar died?
---
It's a booster that was given in starter pack which is only effective until the applied character is 35 days old. It gives 20% rate of fire bonus and 20% damage increase along with all attributes +3.
---
It's called cerebral accelerator.
---
it's dps number is great
---
the form that dps takes is extremely fragile outside of ganks 
---
your flair explains your view, here
---
They're not there. They're not on scan. Then they're on top of you. Then you're dead.
---
Just buy plex or MPTCs now and sell those in 6 to 12 months...your profits are only due to price increase on these items. Their higher price made sp more expensive also in the past.  But if it is not profitable to produce sp at that plex price right then and there, all gains from plexing earlier are only plex price increase.
---
From what I've heard they will gate up to a couple systems away from their hole.
---
Bullshit, prove it.
---
I love how even though you can guess exactly what the meme is going to be, it is still hilarious.
---
they will just shoot you too. Watched a guy try that last night while we were chasing them off a station
---
I meant OP, not you.
---
Gotta love when you can identify the camping bastard in your corp by a throwaway description. Every corp has one.
---
In a week I expect to see their isk destroyed skyrocket.
---
Anyone know if they are shooting bots/afkers only? Or are people too slow to react?
---
I think it is totally reasonable for renters to exist to some degree. It is only natural that some organizations are going to handle military matters more While others are more agrarian, at least in the farming video game sense. It is not dissimilar to feudal society. But when we reach a level where renting is the norm, without sufficient motivation for renters to break off or usurp those above them, then yes, we need something to shake that up. Not to ban it forever. But provide volatility.
---
it is the first time that ccp has actively interfered in wars ( over 384 structures killed nc vs goons) to stop them and take choice away from the players.
---
 Not just goons but all hot wars in eve have been stopped in a dash to defend against broken ai which we will overcome and USE IT  against you . But they interfered in nullsec wars (destructive wars may i add) . They are forcing us to turtle up and stagnate conflict. this will lead to inflation way more than before.

Does this sound like a sandbox where you have choice&gt;?

This intervention removed choice from players and stagnated all the hot wars in eve... think better.

That would be way too awesome.

please send blue loot bundles to my citadel grids that would be great thanks

seeing as how they came from serenity, an entire replica server that was ruined entirely by botting... maybe don't be so quick to play the race card *on their behalf*?
---
dirty lies!
---
Unallocated skill points count toward your total. You see the diminishing returns immediately, as it is based on total skill points.
---
Could it be that the major entities have already figured out a counter to them, stopping almost all of the attack’s today and allowing all their timers to repair, meanwhile random elite-pvp small gang groups are getting insta-killed by them and are largely docking up because of it and in actuality this entire event is going to have turned out to be a massive flop and waste of everyone’s time?
---
Hey im a renter, dont kill me

Will you defend your citadels against attacks from Drifters?

Well, its because he flies a hecate. Hecates are not part of our training and very few people fly them.

A lot of us camp the station and play station games, its part of our strategy for frustrating Volta.

Needs at least a damage control in the low   Change out drone things in the mids for a cap booster and some hardeners.   If you want any chance of someone saving you there should be a cyno in the highs.

I returned on the free 14 days of omega through twitch prime, but this got me to actually resub.
---
So who are "the powers that be" regarding Null space?
---
Honestly the best way to learn and stay with the game is getting into a corp with other players you like to talk too and learn from. I started and stopped 3 different times all with 1 or 2 monthes til I got bored until I joined a nullsec corp and started to learn more of the game. While there are some assholes in the game Most players will trip over backwards to answer questions. We have had newbros ask questions and had 3 to 4 people all trying to answer at the game time.
---

Imagine going back 10 years ago and telling players that superpowered rats will be killing player made stargates.     
---
^(We would reply, "Wait, it took 10 years for that to happen?")
---
What if...... this is a way to reduce the size of the galaxy (playable game) to generate more content and reduce the amount of resources they have dedicate to inactive parts of space???
---
Your general null bloc leadership
---
Sp really doesnt matter clearly.

Skill of player, isk ig matters.

You're just upset you ate shit our blops drops.

That would be awesome, but since they literally stopped using that name for that reason... it's sadly never gonna happen.

---
I think it's too early to say if it stagnates or not.
---
If they can make the Engineering structures drop loot, I'm not sure why it wouldn't work for all structures. I mean, all of them are basically containers. I would need to know more about how it is set up to say for sure though.
---
almost. Drifters started a new campaign, Burn Eden.
---
Repeat Step 4.
---
I'm imagining the NC. logo with the npc meme face rather than that skull bullshit.
---
Ah - the politics of this are generally new to me. I didn't realize the null blocks cared about the NPC space. Seems like its forgotten to most players.
---
Perhaps, but if that's the case I wonder if the AI will get smart and bring bigger numbers.
---
Thank you CCP.
---
Do you even know what you wrote, you dumb Fuck?
---
I asked this in another thread and didn't get an answer. I'd say it's pretty important to know if these ships point/scram and if so, do they instalock? If these guys insta-scram and doomsday, then it would be dumb to fly around blingy subcaps.
---
&gt; I think we can all agree that 4% player retention rate will eventually catch up and end the game for all of us.
---
Jesus fuck, is it really that damn low? No wonder CCP sent the Drifters to nuke everything...
---
Transmat firing!!

Try this https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/96okp7/zkillboard_urlfu/

Without SP limit it seem it could be abused with skill injector to create a 35 days long "super character".

Oh you can critize but at least make some effort to put good argument and/or better ideas but it's harder than just saying get a ceptor ;)
---
Just purchased the one for the 1 mil sp for the characters. Dont care if they change it now

And what has that got to do with a bag of chips
---
I like this, at least level iv in the magic 14
---
Half your linemembers are spodbrains that go on a fleet every 2 months to not get kicked so they can mine in peace.
---
So is anyone throwing hordes of rifters at them and pointing killing any of them?
---
What they should do is have the drifters blow up every gate to stain so that it's only accessible through wormholes or capital ships.
---
Oh yeah those guys are boring and suck and should be kicked.
---
Wrong. Pushx services everyone.
---
It may have been that new guy, CCP HTFU!  :-D
---
You got me excited too :P
---
Its not much of a pain if you only bring a small group.
---
Its a pain when you have 100 dudes sitting around at every citadel.
---
it's happening
---
Yes, that's all very nice.
---
But how do you counter them?  They scram and neut at insane distances and the BSes have psycho doomsday pewpew.
---
Has anyone come up with a way to deal with them?
---
I haven’t played EVE in a couple years, but I keep up on the news. I remember all the gripes about AFK miners and player ideas on how CCP could deal with them. Nothing was done much about it. 
---
However, having NPC drifters roam space and actually attack (even podding players) has a very ruthless, yet satisfying EVEness about it.
---
Just order a large Farva
---
It's like watching an episode of westworld
---
What I meant was for structures that were in low power at the start of the re-reinforcement process.
---
Besides, I also feel that low power structures shouldn't get ANY timers.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004035/201906270100/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004035/201906270100/)  Dont forget INIT loosing apocs trying to save a rorq
---
Also, low power structures don't get timers.
---
Oh Jesus christ I've been misreading this entire time. Derp
---
Cool cool
---
You need to think about it completely differently, if the drifters do only do one layer and not the rest no ones really gonna bother setting up a defence fleet for the armor timer, now if you happen to notice drifters bashing a enemy's structure you set up a surprise bash fleet strip a layer and suddenly your opponent has a hull timer to deal with
---
CCP plan all along to get internet attention to boost subscription numbers!
---
CCP Hilmar:”It’s a feature, everything going as planned.”
---
Or just someone who can open up the market in Jita.
---
Make that 3 years
---
You do not.
---
So, what is the defense against Drifters?  Don't they just keep spawning?  If they're essentially undetectable, I don't understand the point.
---
Its nit like those “heavy assets” are all that rare or difficult to aquire anymore.
---
Didn't they have an economist at some point? What happened to him
---
It used to be that way. It was that way when I started playing and that mission arc is what helped get me into EVE in the first place. I always wished there was more content in that story arc.
---
Burn it all!
---
Are they allied with everyone, then?
---
That CCP reply, big yikes.  I hope they don't measure success in PVP kills per day if this is meant to continue.  I don't think anyone is going to fight a war under these conditions, or at least not until people can understand the mechanics well enough to control and ignore them.
---
Hey thanks man. I will be updating soon to add more content.
---
Sure. Would make the game more dynamic, which is always good.
---
Do these land in your site or go from system to system shotgunning anoms or does anyone know what they are doing?
---
obvious PushX alt is obvious
---
Heh, yeah I guess people have to log in to keep fighting these don't they?  Wonder how long before people figure out the PVP wars that make eve famous can't happen if you can't deploy because you're constantly under siege by an enemy you can't hit back
---
Meh, he would be the dude getting memed out the conference room window.

---
What is this, Ender's Game?
---
You, sir, obviously have no idea who I am.
---
Yeah. Why buy what you already own?
---
That thorax hull looks sexy. Just saying
---
not sure about hordes of rifters but I was in a 20 fleet that managed to bomb and kill all but 2 of a 10-15 ship group of rifters trying to reff a station last night. What makes engaging them hard is they are so fucking random. Random speed changes, random direction changes, if someone decloaks near them they might just kill you and keep orbiting, they might warp off, they might pulse their MWD's a few times to get away from you, they might change their orbit angle or orbit range or both. They will randomly switch their anchor ship. If there are large numbers of two different sized ships like cruisers and BS's they can act like 2 separate fleets while orbiting at different ranges and each having their own anchor ship or just turn into a giant pile of ships all on the same anchor.
---
What I hope is that the next time there's a big nullsec bloc fight the drifters third party and kill all the supers and titans.  I'd be happy to lose my super in this way, at least it'd be different and more interesting than "they showed up with more \_\_\_\_\_\_ and thus..."
---
Welp... 😐 Ok then. Glad to hear it though... Keeps you on edge and teaches you to fear the void.
---
But it's like mobile game monetization. Pay to catch up. Not a great "selling point" for prospective players.
---
&gt; I don't think they are mutually exclusive.
---
patch notes sure show otherwise
---

---
Be afraid... be very afraid.
---
No cyno on the hell. Makes your story completely invalid.
---
&gt; that are spending hours in (usually) near silence
---
out of the over 100 fleets I was in maybe 5-10 were silent and that's because they were the smaller bomber fleets and we were all watching netflix.
---
At the end of the day can't everything be bought with isk? And a new player can potentially, with the right knowledge and a bit of luck, make billions of isk even as an alpha clone.
---
NPCs force people to undock, which provides PvP opportunities.
---
If you know an Alliance has to defend against a Drifter Citadel Bash, then you can ambush and kill them.
---
Hey i have you know that my last wh Corp didn't go to c2 5/null to die. We went there to do lots of pvp. That we died 2 months later is pure coincidence.
---
This entire event will be seen as a massive flop. We’ve already figured out how to counter them and defended every structure RF timer today. Way to go CCP for stinking your clumsy fingers in the sandbox and abruptly ending a war prematurely. CCPL indeed.
---
or they could just remove the damage cap for players shooting stations and let players do it themselves. Half the cancer of structure bashing is the damage cap.
---
I know id shit myself lol.
---
I miss the C5 shattered blackhole that had 100+ drifters in it.
---
Astero, Strat, Venture/Expedition Frigs, Cov-op frigs, Bombers, Gila and Scorp for killing Sleepers.
---
Later on, cloaky t3c, force recon, DSTs, totally depends on what you want to do, do you know what you want from WH life?
---
ok
---
so their solution to not being able to encourage PVP was to force PVE on everyone... yeah that sounds great.
---
Please cease this degeneracy.
---
Bob’s silent, haunting pure lands are filled with Drifter cultists, come join us.

I wouldn't mind teether being a module too...

Group activities (drifter sites and pvp). i’ll have an alt for high sec when there is nothing going on in corp/alliance for solo play.
---
As a player who hasn't played in ten years... Yeah.
---
I mean... If an Ai had an axe to grind, what's to stop fleets of 100 destroyers cheap fit just firewalling these drifties.
---
I think talwars would be cool, or failrail corms en masse.
---
Why do all goon posters act like angsty teenagers even though they had a "cultural revolution" afew years ago
---
Looking at their Zkill. they are in random systems minute after minute.
---
I was completely unaware that playing for free was an option. thanks for that. After a month I will decide whether or not I take the plunge on a 1 year sub. thank you!
---
How many times is this same Hel going to be posted about?
---
I think its awesome that they keep this secret! I hope the Triglavians take some notes on this too :P
---
I agree that they should keep it fresh, however I don't think they should just add arbitrary things. Part of what makes the Trig and new AI so much better is that they follow realistic rules (on behavior and fitting) unlike Burner Missions and older AI where the rules for them was just made up, for example in Burner Missions where secretly its a fleet of Vindicators hiding in a the hull of an npc daredevil...
---
Excited to see what happens!
---
Why is it a problem now, and not previously when on steam?
---
"Hey boss, we made the head, the limbs, lower and upper torso, just need to assemble it now."
---
"No time for that! Another team leader bid for you. You are going to be re-making 100 feet this week. [Besides, make it more... psssshhhh](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/world-of-darkness-the-inside-story-mmo-ccp-white-wolf)"
---
Yeah and it could be done before too.
---
Just make it so that low power citadels in wormholes have no reinforcement periods: you gotta be there and keep it fueled if you want to keep it.
---
Drink some water with chemicals that turn even frogs gay, you will never have this problem again!
---
probably because most people weren't aware of what happens on the irrelevance of steam.
---
Ah, so like 100 more days of training. Of course. Hehe, figures.
---
That's along the lines of what I was thinking, thanks!
---
Whalla is a town in the deep South of the US
---
I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing. I was saying that you don't have to sacrifice player interaction for NPC interaction and vice versa. You can and should have both in a successful game.

When Goons n Co rally their super fleet and engage the drifters. And the drifters open a cyno and a single Sleeper Titan we've never seen before bigger then anything with no model we've never seen before shows up and starts chain lightning murdering titans and supers off the field forcing a retreat and even more of eves fleets have to come together with huge fleets of subcaps to distract the sleepers from the supers and titans so they can focus them down. 
---
Anything to get strategic and new gameplay forming. Not this stagnant mess the game has been in for a long time now.
---
rip vietnam, mad isk was made of it
---
&gt; I haven't heard any specific complaints about Mango, just the "they're chinese so they must be botters" crap.

They ruined serenity, the chinese eve server. There was no one left to RMT their botted isk to so they left.
---
Thank you so much for this extra info. I'll definitely look into the sources you've suggested for some extra fun reading.
---
 It's a glitch
---
Next you know they will blow up npc stations in high sec and pod people who are docked. Beware......
---
oh look, this thread again. we've never seen this every time there's a plex sale.
---
nope, this is totally new and unexpected.
---
2 years is peanuts in eve time.
---
Generally speaking:
---
Overhaul your overview entirely. Utilizing a pre-packaged one (such as the SaraShawa pack, found by joining the chat channel "SaraShawa-Overview", links are in the MOTD in that channel) is usually fine. Then make it much larger. Personally, my overview is just the entire right half of my screen, from top to bottom.
---
Beyond that, it's basically down to personal preference. Unfuck your overview is rule 1, though.
---
So, am I see this right? Null space... Wormhole space... and even Abyssal space are all infected with Drifters? Zkill is littered with ship kills. 
---
Look at this poor guy...
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498929/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498929/)
---
Back when they first showed up a guy tried to attack one in his Carrier and it blew up his carrier. 
---
So yeah.
---
CCP warned of this cryptically at CCP North. They talked about how the UIs were reacting to situations to defend themselves.  This might just be the next step.
---
Yeah, tbh all of eve needs a purge, wormhole space included.
---
And this is coming from a wormholer btw.
---
&gt; im english so we just write this shit like whalla and think its a made up word we invented haha
---
nah, most know it's french.
---
Apologies, my compatriots and I have been busy today.  
---
Now taking a break after destroying a fleet of 'Cormorant' vessels in some place named 'Geminate'.
---
Being forewarned would merit mittens outward reaction of indignation. Perfect coverstory.
---
If you spent as long as they have carry the "CCP is out to get us" victim complex for as long as they have, it would probably get to you too.
---
Rofl, [my shitpost](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c5yis3/coalition_influence_map_timelapse_today_next_week/) ended up in a pcgamer article... because someone at CCP sent it to them. =D I think my r/eve posting career has peaked...
---
Lol no different then world war bee. Goons did the exact same and now they are bitching pan fam didn’t undock.  Oh the irony.
---
To make real change the Drifers need to seed director level spies in all major blocs to steal their money and disband the alliances.
---
Ages ago we thought Jove were about tech 5 and the terrans would be tech 7.  If you consider that current tech 3 is salvaged burnt tech, how powerful are intact functioning tech from those ships.  We blow up what tens/hundreds of ships to remake one
---
Sounds awesome
---
&gt;I never complained
---
M8 your entire post is a complaint lmao
---
People are upset about capital proliferation, but this could push more people into capitals. Who's going to fly a marauder or T3Cs or other DED or abyssal fit ship when you can get RNG instablapped? Get into a capital that can jump out as soon as drifters pop up on grid instead of something that has to align to warp out.
---
Do you honestly think we wouldn't have had enough to glass the rest of your space without INIT's help? I mean, God bless them for helping, but it's hard to believe that they're vital to the war effort when you rolled over and died before we even had our first move op.
---
Yeah you know that's fair
---
I think that was the first capital to die to the new drifters.
---
Doesn't purchasable "asset safety insurance" kind of defeat the point of asset safety? I feel like the only valid reason why asset safety should exist is so people who have to take unexpected breaks (due to health concerns or w/e) don't return to find all their stuff gone.
---
Fair, personally I don’t have an issue one way or the other because more SP on players is a more active pvp population. I was just curious why there’s outrage now, and not then.
---
Just make sure you post whatever system you're doing it in
---
The original introduction didn’t estimate how long the wh was opened.  But ftl was already functioning to a huge level, and probably proper control of WH space, just that the Eve gate was further and unconnected to the others.  The existing populations were large, but it was probably the existing tech that allowed the rapid spread rather than population
---
Honestly, all non w-space drifters are mini titans already.
---
Hey, I've got an idea -- how about you... biomass your main character and then go fuck yourself with a pineapple?

They talked about this at eve north to some extent. We really didn't know it was in relation to.  But the hints were there.

PushX does hauling for Imperium, yes.

Cause catching botting vni's are so fun
---
You literally described all of Eve.
---
This I like, though a downside is that it may possibly result in them becoming too attached to that ship - which is never a great thing to teach new eve players.
---
Eve is like Smoking. You never really quit.
---
They have been doing this for a long time. But too often they lack the dps or aren't able to ''show up'' on the final timer because the AI isn't specifically intended to bash structure (That's what I think at least).
---
In your folly, you sought mutual accommodation with the accursed triangles. Now there shall be a red ring-shaped fried confection throughout your spatial cluster.

Not everyone in legacy was as eager to suck mangos dick as you testies were.

As a non bot in Frat it’s fun to watch and definitely brought life back into the game
---
Don't stahp, don't stahp, oh baby it hurts sooo goooood!!
---
(Let it burn. Burn baby, burn.)
---
Yes. As your analysts may have deduced during our initial explorations into your areas of space, we have interest in your capsuleer corpses.
---
We'll just ignore all the posters claiming that CCP is designing the game to cater towards our play style.
---
Oh, I loved doing this sort of thing, too. Messing with the cheaters and botters was the most fun ever. In UO, people would run scripts to train skills while they were afk, and a lot of those had to do with trapping mobs behind a fence or whatever, so that the player could do stuff to them, but not be hit back. Easy solution was to... oh, open the gate. Creature comes running out, player just keeps on spamming the same action, and eventually dies slowly not reacting.  
---
Or.. teleporting them into the wall, and watch them not notice.  
---
The biggest score of all was this, though: [https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-confiscates-15-trillion-gold-from-ultima-online/1100-6153678/](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-confiscates-15-trillion-gold-from-ultima-online/1100-6153678/)  
---
There was a dupe that we couldn't figure out for a long time, but knew it was happening because there were more rare items than should be possible based on how often they spawned. And back then, it was legal to sell stuff on Ebay, and there were stores that had every rare item available on every server. Some of them would go for close to $100, or more.  
---
I convinced my boss to give me a month to do nothing but work on this. I finally figured out the source of the dupe (it was a flaw in the character xfer service), and then we added some logging to detect who was doing it, and what happened to the items that they duped. We let that run for a week or so, and then I spent days  pouring over the logs and figuring out the various connections, tracing them, and building up this big list of accounts to ban and items/gold to delete from the game.  
---
On the big day, we took down the servers for awhile for "maintenance", which gave the GM time to go through and login all of the characters involved, confiscate all their crap, then ban the accounts.  
---
The total "street value" was in the millions. It was absurd how much duping had taken place, and that it was ever allowed to get that far. The ironic part was that they were even duping the character xfer tokens, so it cost them absolutely nothing at all... and in fact, were selling character services cheaper than the company was... because it was all free for them.  
---
I told anyone who complained on the forums to email me their account names so I could take a look at what we did, and I think maybe in two cases, I decided to unban the person, minus the duped stuff... they were just suckers who spend a lot of IRL cash on items from these stupid stores. I mean, there were thousands of them all over the game, but most people only had a handful at most, and they had no idea what they were buying.  
---
But the people who bought tons of ultra rare items to resell in game... well, that crossed the line into the "you knew what you were doing" territory, and well... sucks to be them.  
---
The best part was visiting those online stores and seeing how many of them were "temporarily out of stock" :-)  
---
What's crazy is that this could've been done long before it was, but there was an old established culture in the CS department that resisted doing something about it (one of those "these are our procedures, and we follow them because they're the procedures we've always had" people, who wouldn't listen to logic) and the producer at the top wasn't really interested in interfering with how they did things... but over time, those people left the company, and we got a new lead GM and a new lead producer, and both of them were interested in cleaning things up.
---
fuck the newbros!

I endorse this product or service. No more second-class citizens in nullsec. If you want to live out here, you need to be ready to fight for it.
---
Shit, I think this is amazing. I don't envy being in your shoes, but from my perspective it's time to grab some popcorn and enjoy the show. The game is in desperate need of a shake up, and here's to hoping this gives us one. 
---
Even if they stop short of total annihilation (CCPlz don't stop bb) it's a hell of an ambitious event that is going to generate a bunch of earned media and hopefully pique enough interest to generate a spike of new players.
---
tbh honest i would love to defend agianst wave of sleeper makes thing interesting.
---
I reached out to CCP Games personally, and a spokesperson said they "reached out to the Drifters for comment, but they rejected our hailing frequencies." - PC Gamer
---
Haha that's good
---
Please carry more transneural skill injection products inside the cargo holds of the vessels you sacrifice to our fleets so I may more quickly pilot a Titan-class capital ship.
---
Vous avez du sel?
---
What happened to a monthly plex costing about $15 USD? Good thing I don’t play that game anymore!
---
wow sickgraphic
---
The CCP Burger said in a keynote from Toronto that NPCs were going to become much more reactive and engaging. They'll both help you and hurt you, standings dependent.
---
Thanks! I put a lot of work into it for about a minute and a half.
---
Sandcastles are made for... [?]
---
All this talk is making me want to resub. I wonder if our little wormhole from years ago still has our structures in it.
---
I would find the houses where people had trapped animals or monsters to practice skills on and then use the bard Provocation skill to make them kill each other. Unfortunately I realized it was stupid for the skill to work out of Line of Sight, as I could use it on dragons in dungeons that *I* could see but not my character. I mentioned it to the devs and they fixed it :(
---
you can fight them off with cormorants. adapt or die.
---
But then how many tabs would that be? Pvp, pve, looting, warping, mining. At a point it also becomes too much
---
😏
---
I mean I don't have this game to play against the devs
---
Unless they fell into degradation and barbarism as well, only to be united by the divine Emperor, who then led the terran nation to reconquer the stars and return Man’s rightful place at the throne of the galaxy.
---
Adapt or die?
---
&gt;I wish there would some way to fight alongside the drifters
---
Destroy triangles and triangle accessories.
---
is this hell......
---
I think the Old Way was cheap caracal hordes?  Brick fit so you could let reps land, cheap enough that losing it to the DD didn't sting.
---
Yes because everyone who has a goon flair was/is in goons
---
I think the server is finally shutting down so they can release the secret project code named Definitely Not Eve Too*.
---
And then local gets deleted and replaced with regional chat.
---
You can, but honestly it’s so much less stress to not worry about it and just pay the sub fee
---
24 hours in and you’re already throwing in the towel?
---
Probably because your mouth is already full.
---
So like... why dont you say what you really want and ask the GMs to kill your least favorite alliances? That's what you're really wanting here.
---
Tell you what. Have those spawn in every system and we'll call it fair.
---
You guys think the lore is that the triglavian where here to fight the sleepers but we just kept killing them for loot and the "invasion" was actually the sleepers. But gameplay wise its a good balance change and I can't wait to see npc titans
---
Hey dude, I don’t envy you honest.  I’m sure this sucks.  But it can be used to tax expansive empires which I think might be a good thing.
---
That is Awesome!!
---
Maybe it isn’t premature.  Do you think the game will be better when you win?
---
Good thing we dont have experience running multiple fleets lol. This is going to hurt the disorganized alliances way worse than the most organized group in the game.
---
i'm not sure the epic arc is a good idea, really. Having done the arc myself, recently... a lot of it is filler. Making a newbie go through a 52 mission arc that takes 8-10 hours is giving a terrible representation of what the game is. Many people will get the feeling it's WoW in space, except with a lot of harsh rules and terrible AI, completely missing the actual strengths of the game.
---
They should this would be awesome,  seeing the drifters take and reinforce a region or 2
---
Damn like that plex contract scam in jita.  Put in 500 in the description and 1 unit in the contract
---
/u/Tyrannos_Strategos, the perverted capsuleers are commenting on your visage.  
---
I would remain silent, were I one of you. Do you really wish to make her *more* upset with you all?
---
We can only wish
---
Very well.
---
People lose ships to NPCs all the time, why not include structures? Shouldn't everything be killable by all things? EVE = Everything vs Everyone
---
im going to resub cuz of this lelz
---
I’m starting to come around to this position.  The drifters need to focus on low power abandoned structures.
---
Yeah I’m starting to come around to this.  They need to have it focus on low power abandoned structures and largely leave the plans of the sandbox alone
---
I tried, but I can't shed a tear for TEST or Goons.
---
Relax, Apollo, we expected this. Capsuleers utilize humor to cope with terror.
---
That all sounds good as long as it's completely random and no notice is given.
---
&gt;how lopsided this game has become in favor of those who can afford to buy all the sp and ships they need
---
I think you're also missing a big part there though; those players who can afford to buy all the SP and ships are typically in large groups and very organized.
---
Realistically, a newbie can't be expected to fight a veteran and win because that veteran will have an alt right there or be in a gang with multiple other players, while the newbie has a good chance of being alone.
---
Scale it up, and you have the same issue with smaller groups and the major coalitions - young blood trying to do their own thing unfortunately can't really get anywhere.
---
You should have been here when ISD was at its peak.
---
Come on folks, it's an event.
---
Is it possible this is the new forever? I guess, but I think the overwhelming scale of it suggests that this is an epic one-off kind of thing that we probably need to figure out how to defeat. Or it's a story arc that will resolve itself. I dunno, but I'm more inclined to sit back and enjoy the show than to panic.
---
CCP has made some dumb mistakes in the past but I'm pretty sure they want to still have jobs in a couple of weeks.
---
Yass.
---
3 days? Before changes hit TQ.
---
it was hilarious for like 15 minutes, then 40 fleets later I realized we didn't actually do all the offensive stuff we were scheduled to do because everyone was too burnt out defending 40 structures from drifters yesterday.
---
If you're OK with CCP making a fool out of the other null entities and their lack of organization by doing your job for you. We'll be fine.
---
Did they despawn all the drifters in there? I've been wondering if i'd ever come across it again. ;w;
---
haha, yeah UO was filled with ways to exploit. When it was made, it was built somewhat on the tech they had for the previous single player Ultima game in the mid 90s, and they didn't know it was going to be such a big deal, so much of it was just hacked together. Plus, it was the first time a lot of that stuff had been done, so there was a lot to learn about how not to do things.  
---
It was a really fun game to work on though! I learned a lot, and would've stayed on it a lot longer, but they moved our jobs across country and shoved the team under Mythic, so that was the end of that.
---
It could never be as full as you are of shit my friend.
---
I’ve tried doing it before on an alpha character and was notified I needed to be Omega. This was about 6 months ago. 
---
Did it change at some point, or am I mis-remembering?
---
Did the drifters hit  a rorqual?
---
His "Nuclear likelihood" stat just buffer overflowed.
---
I stated my opinion and my rationale for it. Nowhere in there did I mention anything about "null entities". I think this gameplay is good for the game, regardless of who it may or may not benefit.
---
Forgot it existed till this post. RIP, nothing like jumping a hole in a rolling cap only to have 100 Steve’s land @ zero
---
I shall pass this suggestion to my superiors.  
---
For far too long during our monitoring of this capsuleer communication platform have we suffered the bleatings of StainGuy, removal of all external stargate connections would be a fitting response to their single-minded obsession with obtaining access to 'low sec'.
---
I'm a new player and injectors don't seem to make a lot of sense. 
---
I need injectors to learn skills, but I still need to take the time to learn the prerequisite skills and the levels of the skill I just bought. 
---
To me, it's kinda weird, cause its like if each weapon type in WoW were separate categories. And you had to train that category and then you had to specifically train your weapon too. 
---
Maybe since I'm new I'm not understanding the full depth?
