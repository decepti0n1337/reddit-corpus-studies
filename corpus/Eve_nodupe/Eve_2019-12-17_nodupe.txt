Do you also deploy at 5 PM on a Friday and then wander off into the wilderness with no WiFi/phone connection? I hope you do...

hahahahaha thanks for the laugh! XD
---
I'll do it and put it in The Whaler 2. Just need some time off other stuff.
---
And in the screenshot I say it's still possible you dingus. Its not "easily done stealing" anymore. That was the point of the change. It yields way more hilarious content. Makes you kill titans in Sabres instead of merely getting rich.
---
Another thing to be mindful of; Eve's servers operate in whole-second increments. 
---
Flying. Shooting. Modules. 
---
All aligned in some way to the seconds hand on the clock. This makes manually aimed/timed actions rather janky.

&gt;letting it get to that point

Of all the open tabs... "EVE rule 34" - like what?

Not gonna lie, going to google that (after work today, not sure if rule 34 will sit well with the corporate network and IT troglodytes).
---
Don't read into the name unstable to much it literally just means it's a wh. There's only two types unstable and the ones that drifters open which are marked as unidentified wormhole.
---
Basically unstable doesn't mean anything. If you want to know how long it will last show info on it it will give you a rough idea.
---
For more info Google it's name such as u210. k162 is the exit of all holes so you won't find anything under that name you'll have to jump through to get the actual type.
---
lol nothing that would warrant seeing this ad that's for sure.
---
Oh happy cake day

I'm convinced that anyone that chooses to fly/ally with Sort has severe brain damage and is probably bad for the game....or maybe even human species.  It's not like the guy has been the same for like 10 years or anything...

Considering coming back to EVE after about a 1.5 year hiatus. I spent most of my time mining before, but was interested in some PVP stuff. I'm considering speccing into either stealth bombers or carriers (forgot the ship names). Which would be better long term to train up for? Furthermore, are there any other playstyles that would mesh well with that of mining?

Well we actually had a wh for fun brawl, but since you peaked with 6x our size we understandably stood down, also no point for batphones agains a fort that is not used anymore.
---
Tbh always outnumbered, never outgunned is more of our alley.

TRI takes and wins fights outnumbered, everyone knows that.

Right i forgot that lower player counts means that when you are found that it's harder to kill your undefended shit. Wait that doesn't make any sense.
---
&gt; CCP removed piracy on a bigger scale - just compare freighter kills before and after the change.
---
You focus too much on zkb.
---
Forget those idiots who claim "freighter gankers do all post their kills". They don't.
---
There is no link between "being in fleet with other people" and "being lazy".
---
I don't know what's your experience ; but I watched freighter being ganked in Jita and co enough to tell you, freighter ganking is not dead.
---
Does this mean TEST arenâ€™t coming to help us with PI5-39?
---
it means it's much less likely for people to find you in the first place dumbass

how you can't understand that is shocking

Are we calling init little here? As in the Imperium member?

Did Goonswarm really drop a titan on some battleships? Guess somebody has to compensate for a serious lack of content eh?
---
Did you think they would have any interest in being specific so you could argue it doesn't apply?
---
Why would they care about that?
---
Keep them at bay... have you not seen what the small PL sig in there staging has been doing for the last few weeks???
---
Goons dont have the ability to use subcaps, although this can probably be said to A LOT of null groups.

See you guys killed TW. Wasn't TW not in one way your cheerleader group? I expected them to join you lads to leave Legacy.

We had 60 dudes ready to through the wormhole chain and see what content would bring, you think it would be wise to go up again 300+ people with what we had?

Honestly I don't know what to tell you except that I am sorry for what you are mate.
---
They only mine to produce caps and above.
---
if you have a rule that says "don't modify the game"
---
but there are many instances where it's allowed
---
can you see how interpretation of that rule is irrelevant?
---
Sounds like what you are after is Faction Warfare.
---
You can read about it here: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction\_warfare](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction_warfare)
---
You join an NPC Corp for the faction you want to fight for (Amarr, Gallente, Caldari or Minmatar).
---
You'll fight other players for control over systems in a designated warfare area.
---
You get Loyalty Point rewards which you can use to buy "Navy Issue" versions of the regular frigates, cruisers and so forth.
---
Faction Warfare is a great first place to start for PvP, and being oriented around faction vs faction gameplay it sounds like it would be right up your alley.
---
Apparently you edited your post.
---
&gt;it's a rule that applies to everything so they can make whatever arbitrary decision they want- the rule itself has no credibility 
---
To some extent, yes, it's their game. They would be looking at the result of your "actions" and would determine that you are gathering resources at an accelerated rate.
---
&gt;that doesn't imply that what i've said is allowed though, don't get the wrong idea- it's just that it's arguable on whether it's allowed or not
---
It's very clear a that using a script is covered by article 6.
---
Yes newbie.. faction warfare is where you belong... to start your "military" career...
---
The optimist in me hopes that with the recent changes to *how* the devs are allowed to play their game, they can now be afforded the opportunity to test these things out more thoroughly, or at least get a good feel for how the playerbase feels about features from a "boots on the ground" perspective.
---
Afaik goons are not directly involved atm are they?
---
Eagles all like:
---
Aight chief, Imma head out
---
Mate, WH's are fucking desolate, you can do what the fuck you want in them.
---
I understand you think that this is some great idea compared to just rolling your static. Go ahead and set it up then if it's so easy.
---
I have no problems with eradicating botting alliances. Even if the other alliance has bots too, still less bots to bot with.

Just in case y'all get confused or something, Rote, C0ne, Fweddit, and Unspoken are there to shoot both retarded sides and are not on one specific side or another.

there isn't really any decent detection in the actual game, nevermind the login screen lol

Sure you are not just stop plexxing? Thats something different mkay?

More locust dunks coming soon
---
Still there are systems in delve that have 3-4 times more npcs killed. Just that its done by 30 actual people in supers instead of a guy who either uses 2-5 subcaps or 1 super per system
---
Be careful where you set up your PI. In highsec most planetary customs offices (short: poco) are owned by Player corps and often have very high taxes for getting your stuff off the planet. That makes it often not worth at all to even do it. (you can check taxes in the info-panel of the poco)
---
There are youtube videos explaining how to set PI up properly.
---
Also they usually miss any knowledge on what this does to the games economy and health ....
---
Well, that was interesting...
---
No idea. I've never been shy to mention my corp or alliance.
---
We're seeing the same thing in the Dronelands. If this is true they better get to reversing it...we've gone through 4 Colossal anoms and not one of them has rocks bigger than like 1500m. Seriously, when they see hundreds of accounts start to unsub it's not going to be a good situation for them.
---
I'm coming back to play Eve recently. I have an exploration-based character with not many PVP skills apart from Gallente ship tree and drones. I joined a C4 wormhole corp and I'd like to enjoy some PVPing with them. Do you guys know which ships should I aim for in this situation? I know very little about PVPing in WHs. Thanks!
---
I think that'll would be left to someone on Team Talos. I've pinged them with this thread.
---
lol. Yeah, I can't speak for IA, but I think they'd get nervous about releasing any kind of stats about all of us. Even if it's not identifying information, there's the question of optics. No matter what numbers you put up there, you could always read something into it that's almost definitely not true.  
---
But, yes. I also don't want to be K/D shamed. :P I get that enough when I play FPS
---
Yep this.. it's not a nerf for goons its nerf for everyone else.  But lets be honest no one was ever gonna a compete with goons regardless.
---
I would still instantly warp to safety if one guy enters local or 5-10-15-20 guys enter local. I do want to see some dread/carrier/fax roams tho
---
This makes totally no difference from the staus before ... the only thing that can destroy the abomination that Imperium became through the "FarmVille patches" (they were crucial and current state of Goons depends totally on this patches and not on own achievements, except the achievement to abuse the broken mechanics to the max)
---
Join Horde, they will feed you to goons daily
---
Send 10bil to TDSIN Fax Pilot ingame and you will be unbanned

---
Null-Sec has so much potential yet even a small destroyer fleet gets blob'd by an unproportionate response. I remember that I tackled a Gila or something of similar size in a Confessor and the first thing that lands on grid is a darn Hel.
---
Thanks!
---
You're a god!
---
What ccp have to do is reiterate things that work and engage player.
---
If you're a baller then yes, but usually Caldari Navy rockets are good enough.
---
Is there ever a good use for rage or javelins? Because I have all 3 types of rockets on it rn and could switch them or should i just stay with the caldari navy?
---
Tried one sunday, teleported a ceptor (crusaders with a token ranis and a stiletto + sabre) fleet to 6NJ-8, roamed around, kill a few ratters and a response gila. Lost the sabre, a couple crusaders and a newbro hyper punisher. Probed a WH chain back home. Op success and we got to roam somewhere random (Venal, Tenal, Stain via WH).
---
They \*are\* fun.
---
&gt;instant gratification type of player
---
What, like someone who actually wants to log in and enjoy themselves without hours of busywork just to get dunked by scaps?
---
Good for you, you killee a bunch of newbros, want a medal?
---
Rage when you shoot something big and slow like a Battleship, or have a lot of target painters, and Javelin when something kites you.
---
I disagree, saying quite literally is laughable even. Living in a WH with a NSS provides infinitely more butterfly effect and content than somebody rolling filaments. You become a target in that space, your structures, your ships your everything has infinitely more possibility of game play. Wormholes also create counter play. 
---
Additionally, I don't view the requirement of a capital investment of time or effort as a bad thing or counterproductive. Not only do these these provide balance, they also have a way of penalizing the lazy and complacent and rewarding the content creators and those who learn and take advantage of said mechanics. 
---
I have no sympathy for those who use the "I have a RL" excuse to destroy game balance or introduce game breaking mechanics in the name in instant gratification or lazy game play. I have A RL too and I make do without filaments.
---
Have you heard of locust fleets?
---
I think your idea for the best ideas are all bad. POS bashing was better than citadel bashing, Passive moon goo was great for funding non-krab alliances. Fozzie sov is fun on small scale, when it is contested(All sov grind is boring when uncontested).

Its like you understand that people have different opinions and play styles at the beginning of your post, then forget instantly after saying it.

Thank you good friend
---
Industry in this game is inflated and overfilled to fuck. Less minerals is better.
---
ok but for destroyers, cruisers, and brawling frigates the navy is the way to go?
---
No
---
No one thinks ganking rorqs is elite pvp. it's done purely to fuck with krabs with a guaranteed shiny KM and a chance of a fun escalation. Less krabs means less supers blobbing fucking everything.
---
Everything equalizes. If trit hits 20isk you bet your ass i'll be skilling into a rorq. 
---
Also, wtf happened to isk prices? I remember it was at like 2isk before rorqs were introduced.
---
It is ok, Stainguy is five years outdated
---
Try to start cheap, or even just stay cheap. A t2 scram and meta cap booster are fine, and you might not even need the cap booster - dual ancillary rocket Jackdaws fit fine and are not cap-stressed. (Cap boosters are more common with, say, a pith c-type medium booster, so you can avoid the ancil reload.)  
---
Good luck! A rocket jackdaw is a really fun solo hunter.
---
Yep.
---
Not sure how it will be that different than swapping to 10 exhumers, aside from them warping off grid rather than be sieged.
---
You are correct. To run T4s &amp; T5s I need expensive and specialized ships. If those were thrown in random nullsec after each run then I'd simply stop running T4s and T5s because: a) I need a station to repair, ressupply and drop the loot between runs and b) what am I supposed to do after I'm dropped in null? Scan my way back home? Run more filaments, why?
---
Ships fit to run abyss, specially deep ones, are expensive loot pinnatas that usually won't do well in pvp. Wanting them to be served in a plate for you to kill is just asking for people to stop running abyssal filaments.
---
If you want to pvp against abyssal fit ships you can already do so in the abyssal proving grounds. Come by, I'll be waiting.
---
Or, instead of exploding instantly upon timing out of a site, get yeeted in to random nullsec.  Still have a chance of escaping with the loot, but have to go through the player gauntlet to do it.  Finishing it and gating takes you back to your starting point.
---
Great info thank you!

content is content. and it's more like a 5-6 way gang bang invasion rather than just content deployments.
---
It lowers the overall amount *rorqual* pilots can mine. Barges will be just as strong as they were before. 
---
Rorquals functioned as boost ships in the past. With the recent buff to boost strength they are incredibly powerful in conjunction with subcap miners. Being able to mine on their own is a cool bonus.
---
Mining has always had very diminished returns for increased investment. A hulk costs 10x as much as an covetor mines, at best, 15% more. So if we take our 350m hulk and compare it to a reasonably priced rorq (6B, not your laughably blinged 9B trash), that's a roughly 20x increase in price. So a rorq should be able to, at best, get around 30% more ore over a hulk, if we considered it only as a mining ship. Of course, it's really designed to be a boost + fleet protection boat, so you need to pull those features out of the price to reach what it's true mining potential should be for it's cost. This of course, doesn't include the massive jump in survivability.
---
Compared to the 100%+ more than a hulk a rorqual currently mines, I'd say they're a fair bit overpowered.
---
"you want to fly a super? start training an alpha alt to pilot the thing one day" is realistic, is directly in line with their goal, and isn't hurting anyone or anything.
---
Yes, worm-holers need to know their fucking place on the food chain.

---
nullblocks are better than the game tutorials.
---
God forbid it require months of training and high investment to fly a Rorq for it to be useless because an ex-goon is butt hurt.
---
That's my whole point. You should be punished for making the choice to blue everyone within 30 jumps. You get less content.
---
Whereas a group like mine, with very few blues, can find content within 6 jumps in 3 different directions.  Our ratting is less safe, we don't have a keepstar, but those are choices we made in order to access more and better content. 
---
You get absolute safety, or you get near-instant access to content. You don't get both. Stop trying to have your cake and eat it too.
---
If you have access to helldump still.. there is a lovely story written there about you and Jay..
---
Like people have said, faction warfare is a great place to start and the closest to a military profession you can get. Another option is mercenary work, if youâ€™re interested we have an academy specifically for teaching new players how to fly in small gang PvP. Weâ€™re currently running it for USTZ but will rotate through the time zones.

Are you saying you knew you knew you got stuff back in error, and sold it off, and tried to move stuff around to different account to hide it?

If thats what you're saying I hope you held on to the isk you made doing it, cause when they follow it all back and you dont have the isk you're gonna get a nice neg wallet.

This is great! Lots of useful info, appreciate it.
---
Nice constructive comment lmao
---
Not sure how it's a strawman when we're talking about a travel mechanic
---
Let me rephrase my question a bit.
---
What happened to make rorqs so good at isk making? Is it still mining? Ratting? What changed to make this happen?
---
So you think ships and equipment magically appear out of thin air?
---
Pretty sure they'll just roll that back. Cool that you came on here admitting to trying to hide it haha.

Bro, that is so fucked up. Glad to see you returning the favor.

So not true, every time I get rolled out of wormholes I usually go through null and end up fine through 10-20+ jumps. Sometimes in higgs battleships.

---
It's getting to be like a game of RISK where you can hit any territory from any other. The map is becoming meaningless.
---
Yes, their 15-man assault frigate gang  should sit still and let you form up 42 feroxes with basilisk support instead.
---
I wanna feel you from the inside.
---
It mines at an insane rate, but on top of that, it is incredibly hard to kill. They get a massive local shield tank, so you need a sizeable fleet to even break one on its own, but also they get the 'PANIC' module, which makes them completely invulnerable for 5-7 minutes or so, giving their friends plenty of time to form up a response fleet. Before they cyno changes, all you needed to save most rorqs was to drop a couple of FAXes and a handful of supers, onto a cyno lit by the rorq itself, so they were nigh unkillable, except for the rare rorq mining outside a super umbrella or too spodbrained to press some of its god-mode buttons. 
---
On the plus side, their mining income stems from special 'excavator drones', which are pretty expensive at ~500M apiece, so killing a rorq usually nets a little bit of profit at least.
---
If you fly small ships you want to train frigs and dessies to V as well as the guns you plan on using. Get all the secondary gun skills (rapid launch etc for missiles, rapid fire for guns) and your capacitor skills high as well. As alpha you can only have 5M sp I think so you wonâ€™t be able to train all of these until you upgrade to a full account.

This still means the large ochre in the enormous will have nearly 35k units of garbage.

FYI, The people that WERE willing to create content have left already because of all the changes to EVE over the years. Eve started being developed for the content *consumers* instead of the content *creators*. 
---
Filaments are the answer to everybody who doesn't want to create content and would rather just have content spoon fed to them via a mechanic that takes zero effort. CCP is still catering to the content *consumers* instead of the content *creators*. Most changes to make things "easier" or "faster" or less effort or "think of the noobs" has had a short term boost in revenue and profitability met with a long term drain in satisfaction which has led to what we have now where nobody actually wants to work for their content in a SANDBOX and everybody think's their entitled to pvp or kills. 
---
Filaments aren't going to revitalize nullsec or "sock it goons". In reality this will harm other forms of PVP and lead to the next design cyclet for *content consumers* that will just perpetuate the cycle and satisfy no one.

&gt;Cracked.com back in the day had some good articles

They did. They don't have those anymore. Haven't for many years now.

Faction warfare is where you have the greatest chance to become an solid contributor quickest (barring dropping a ton of cash on to buy skill injectors.) T1 frigates and destroyers are popular and not just things to give newbros. You can skill into them really fast (for eve).

Compared to Mittani, I'd have to say that his style of alliance leadership is very hands-off.
---
Actually yes and no, i did join a alli. Lorde which took almost of my savings due to war, too expensive
---
&gt;planned to blob them with 150
---
Nobody cares if you blob during your holy war against bots
---
Joining a smaller yet competent group would be more advisable, joining a large corp for the sake of member count would just make you another line member and kills the camaraderie.
---
You do know what full disclosure means, right? You already got that...
---
I do :P I just keep some baseline pve shit going in delve, all the fun is elsewhere; though I did get a fun brawl by chance the other day.
---
The Career Agents are designed to be done with frigates, so yep, you're good with the Atron.

Don't join Goons. They'll take everything that you enjoy, break you down, and rebuild you as a miner who shows up to the monthly mandatory fleet, and does no other PVP until you get bored and quit.
---
If you want to be in Null, Pandemic Horde and Brave Newbies are the two groups which do the most actual PVP rather than having everyone hide until some large fleet of really big ships which you're years away from flying shows up to clear out any non-friendly players who appear in their space. The other groups which actually try to do PVP instead of making it as inconvenient as possible so that people avoid doing it generally have requirements pretty far beyond what a new player can provide.
---
Here's what it's like from an outsider perspective: If you go into Goon space, you'll likely get at least a couple of carriers dropped on you. If you go into Brave space, they'll stay docked until they can form up a fleet and fight you. If you go into Horde space, there will be a bunch of nerds waiting at the front door (currently right inside the gate from Paala into LXQ2-T) looking to shoot whoever walks in with a variety of ships and absolutely no attempt to form a coherent doctrine for an effective fleet and only escalate if an actual fleet comes in (and only escalate to capital ships if capital ships or a fleet from an actual enemy like Goons comes in). Because they put the least effort into making it un-fun to roam their space, they're the ones with the most PVP opportunites just from sitting around in your home area.

Low-Sec (can be a better option than Null for small-scale PVP), I'd suggest going with Faction Warfare if you do that. The corporations affiliated with the Gallente militia tend to be the best-organized, with Aideron Robotics frequently advertising itself as new player-friendly. RvB, a group which is aligned with the Caldari militia (so far as I can tell, that's mainly a source of funding) while the Red half of RvB mainly fights the blue half, is also known for being a good place to develop PVP skills. It's just that they don't really do large-scale operations like you hear about in big gaming media not focused on one particular game.
---
Wormholes have good PVP options as well as plenty of other considerations (exploration-type stuff is essential there). There are a few C2 and C4 corporations which are good for new players.
---
I mean why else would you buy nodes? 
---
Easier make isk this way and just buy whatever you want in market with all the free isk you can make. People who buy other nodes hoping to win something are just feeding my wallets because I am almost always going to win with the most nodes to myself when my net has caught enough ISK to "cash out" on the remaining nodes to "salvage" back my carrot and stick.

You want to avoid having your extractors connect directly to a factory or there will be wasted mass. Have your extractors connect to a storage or launch facility. From there you can either connect industrial facilities, or just launch the raw to the customs office, pick it up, and take it to a planet that has no extractors, only factories and launchpads. Once you start building and playing with it you'll see how the thing works and can refine it as needed depending on how much time you want to be spending on it.

Until Jan 13th I believe, it's in the announcement
---
it is, dont let people fool you.

I just have mobile depot and a proto cloak, then call them idiots in local while I play Dota or something
---
Theres 2 English Incursion communities: Warp To Me (WTM) and TDF. 
---
WTM is a shield fleet that's very new bro friendly and flies more often throughout the day. 
---
TDF is an armor fleet and will expect and..."encourage" you to upgrade within a week 
---
I fly with WTM and recommend them personally, but I have zero experience with TDF.
