Incursions and PI
---
---
---
Nah, Providence is still better looking ship... but Cane, or Minmatar caps (apart from God-awful-fugly Rag) do look awesome indeed.
---
You should never put LMLs on a cruiser. RLML is the cruiser size weapon and is much better. Caracals also work with HAMs and HMs but those aren't great.
---
Exploration, gas huffing, killing sleepers, PI, and T3 research. I can PLEX if I want, but I’m just paying my sub, I need the isk expanding into a new place, then I’ll PLEX my alt in another month or so, and PI and gas collection will double, and I’ll be in full swing again.
---

---
As someone who has done enough to PLEX two accounts, it’s not fun blowing 4B at the end of the month though.
---
Mike PLEASE
---
Join a group of people that are willing to assist you in making isk in null. I reccomend Brave Newbies.
---
I really think if CCP had release Hypernet right after banning IWI no one would have cried
---
I could really use some isk right  now
---
Yeah. Not just the spawn either. 
---
I got two game crashes right after patches, when the ONLY thing different about computer WAS the patch, causing losses in Abysses I was owning easily. So logically the patches HAD to be the cause.
---
CCP's response? Fuck off.
---
This is true, but: we have seen a lot of really high-quality war posters here in the past.
---
Start one already!
---
Xup alliance in caldari fw has no mandatory fleet ops and no sov to defend. Content is all around and some isk to be made while doing pvp. We will take you on bro. Low sec is very alive and cheap fun.
---
I was going to type out something similar, but you explained it perfectly.
---
&gt; But, as someone who knows a thing or two about addiction, you cant stop it. Addicts will get their fixes from somewhere and there are tons of easier places for people to do just that.
---
As someone who studies addiction psychology, this is a bullshit cop-out. Everyone who is an addict -- whether with gambling or substances -- at one point was not an addict. They had a propensity to become an addict, but they were originally naive to whatever it is they are addicted to.
---
In the case of gambling specifically, I think it's really inappropriate to use the argument that "addicts will be addicts." With gambling addiction in particular, a large proportion of the population (who may be prone to gambling addiction) never have the opportunity conveniently planted in front of them. I guarantee you there are people reading this thread who have zero experience with gambling, think they would never be addicted to gambling, but will become tied up in these shitty raffles.
---
For that reason I think it's pretty irresponsible for CCP to randomly reintroduce gambling to line their own pockets in an established video game that has never been about or had blatant embedded gambling systems.
---
I'll admit I have little / no experience with drug addiction, or helping those with drug addictions. So I'll bow to your superior knowledge. I just hope it isn't Eve that sends people down the gambling path.
---
dood was paying attention, warped out as you warped in.  
---
Won't do sites when hostiles are in system  
---
has dscan up spamming V  
---
Clearly a bot because no player would ever do this!  
---
\*face palm\*
---
And then I was playing Fallen Order the new game that came out. 
---
In a description of a plant on Kashyyk it says the plant is lightsaber resistant.....
---
.......how is anything lightsaber resistant?
---
Provi is just a discount Rebel troop transport.
---
Wars are an arse ache to fight so people just don't even bother.
---
Null bois rather sit on a titan for 3 hours ive done the null sec game already a few times few different  power blocks and still fw is where the trolling and content is still real and fights are close.
---
Hah, nice try dude but I found the message. Better luck next time!
---
&gt;regardless, again, what are you going to kill with a combat interceptor?
---
Crusader or dual prop taranis have like 250-300 dps with ok tank. You can kill a lot of stuff with that damage. Crusader is classic anti-garmur ship for example. And garmurs can be really expensive kills that are loot piñatas. It used to be an low effort form of null solo roaming and definetely was a thing.
---
And if he doesn't know that combat ceptors lost bubble immunity he most likely also doesn't know that assault frigates are really powerful now.
---
&gt;It's a low iq suggestion for solo pvp regardless of the nerf.
---
It is not. You are the one with low iq. And even now there might be small niche use for them because you can buy combat ceptors really cheap and they can be used to surprise enemy. For example claw can be nasty ship with the right fit in some situations and not many know that because it's not that used hull anymore. Sometimes using those hulls nobody else is using might be good trick to get fights.
---
1) So your first point depends on what structure you are talking about. If we are talking about an astra, you have to cycle 2 of a phoenix torp bays so that they fire halfway through the other's reload otherwise you waste a ton of damage and don't keep the cap. The 3rd torp is overkill. 
---
2) So the tracking of this dread is higher then that of others. Which is kinda dangerous if you form your fleet to play that role of webs. But, its cap dps is actually higher then that of a nag, which is the standard go to in wormholes. With the ramp and increased tracking, you can start to do serious damage to subcaps and if you ramp up on caps, you can put out more damage then them. 
---
3) I have no idea... would have to look at C5/C6 pvp wormhole triglav fleet fights on zkill to figure out if they consistently have multiplasmids on the lows.... But that's not what is slowly breaking the game... its the basic mechanic of the ships and how they work that are forcing themselves as the meta for wormhole space...
---
I garuntee you, as soon as I can get my grubby fingers on one, I will have one in wormhole space.... for ratting at least.... Maybe... it comes down to if I can kill a drifter in one cycle like I can with a phoenix... But I'll probably get at least one even if I don't use it cause it's a sexy ship... and I am looking forward to skins for it.
---
well its hard to see if its a bot or not      
---
but a NPC corp toon thats a few days old loosing a perfetly T2 fitted astero is kinda suspicius,     
---
what genuine newer player would fit it like that and be able to fly it that fast

Horde AAR:
---
TISHU's been camping the gates around our staging system of R1O-GN for the past few weeks and griefing the beans, so we were pretty keen to get revenge when an opportunity presented itself.  
---
We caught wind of TISHU and Volta moving dreads around Venal this past week and thought they might be for us. We set up a quick response cyno chain and a Sabre cache if they decided to come into drones in order to ambush them.
---
We missed them coming in because our Sabre was AFK getting a White Claw, but noticed they had a lot of mains in caps, so we figured it was quite likely they'd try and go home tonight. We managed to catch them as they were leaving. They cynoed to a ping off the HD-JVQ gate , Sabres tackled them, then brought in the hammer and unleashed the bug zappers.
---
I mostly used whatever I could get at Ace/Joanns.
---
Caldari base gray is much lighter than the Gallente base gray.
---
For the Gallente green, it was mostly forest green with a drop or two of blue.
---
Windows were white mixed with a drop or two of blue.
---
Then there's an assortment of red, orange, metallic silver, etc for small details (Need to get better at this).
---
The drake? ;)
---
Well, I do print with ABS, I haven't yet tried this.
---
Some of those "bots with inhumane reflexes" have also lost pods to regular hunters, which tells me they got the shakes and failed to click warp.
---
wow haha nice

GOTG used to be pretty fun to be in. Its sad so see what they have become
---
This and:
---
* Asteros can fight back
---
* Asteros aren't paperplanes
---
* Asteros can instawarp
---
* Asteros are faster subwarp (cleaning sites faster, easy escape from bubbles)
---
* Asteros can launch 5 ECM drones alowing you to escape from dicey situations
---
* Asteros make more ISK/h because you supplement your income with other explorers
---
&gt; most of null is blue.
---
It’s not a fucking compliment.
---
Uh, incorrect lol
---
That’s fucking lazy, man. Come on.
---
I’m not against it, I’ve never really managed to find the right crew to fly with. My EVE experience would have been so much better for it.
---
I mean, the odds of a CCP employee actually knowing anything about the game is pretty low.
---
&gt; Asteros can fight back
---
if someone jumps on your astero, they are probably in a combat fit as opposed to your own astero gimped by an analyzer, so gg
---
&gt; Asteros aren't paperplanes
---
depends on your perspective i guess
---
&gt; Asteros can instawarp (harder to catch)
---
they are slow and can get decloaked in a bubble, but sure the agility helps (also you can't have both instawarp and fight other asteros reliably)
---
&gt; Asteros make more ISK/h because you supplement your income with other explorers
---
i guess if you stumble upon a five day old explorer while looking for sites you can take their lunch money, but to make a serious attempt at others means you need to use relic sites as bait and spend time to set up bookmarks and wait for explorers, which is time you spend not doing other relic sites.
---
I’m just one guy. I’m not going to start a regional war.
---
I’d like to, but I’ve never started wars before.
---
There is some real cool stuff in the Creative Eve Discord : [https://discord.gg/4CVVjYr](https://discord.gg/4CVVjYr)
---
I talked to devs about it in Vegas and by that I mean I said, “hey love the game and basically every one hates sov mechacanics. Are there any sort of changes being looked at?” And got a resounding 
---
No.
---
They are aware of the issue but honestly have no clue how to fix it.
---
Had a great chat with one dev who thought that they could make wars...shall I say “viable”? Again by placing some resources in unique locations. Like you can only get mexilon in the south or something. Not mexilon but you get my point I hope. And each sort of area in eve would have its own unique thingy. 
---
I said cool. I’m gonna harvest a bunch of that shit and stuff it in my jump freighter sell it in jita....along with everyone else in eve. Nothing will change. 
---
So he said “hmm we need a way to sever that logistics chain”
---
I said that’s impossible in the current meta. Wet targets? I have a neutral JF pilot like most competent jf pilots. Camps along the route? Instant dock and (after instant docking) tethering mechanics make camps almost pointless. The only jf I have ever lost was empty and in highsec to suicide gankers. But that’s not gonna stop the “unique” regional stuff from getting to jita. Never has. 
---
I suggested that the major power blocs might form a OTEC thing again and he said ya that needs to be avoided. 
---
Anyway. Tldr dude had no clue how to “fix” the lack of need for war. Hand in had with the no idea
---
How to make wars in eve not suck in a painful way. 
---
 I don’t know how either.
---
please clap
---
That may have been true before the Koreans came.  I've noticed recently (at least for me) that when I find a wh with more than a couple of relic sites it's something with a ls or null static that's hardly ever visited.
---
Man, only 300? I feel like I saw a movie about 300 dudes fighting...something something, jackdaws in the shade?

There are plenty of wormhole corps recruiting. 0.0 beardtards get old after a while. Dont quit eve because you are part of a bureaucracy

Wrong : if this very car had spent one year outside under the rain getting the right amount of rust, then and only then it would look like one of our proud ships.
---
Bonus if the owner had tried to fix the car by adding some random pieces of metal scraps. Also the engine should be oversized.

We do have a Korean incursion fleet and it is true that many youtubers and old members encouraged incursion as a good high-sec income source. But all those newbies going to WTM was out of our expectation and I feel sorry for the WTM FC and fleet members. If you see any newbie Korean pilot trying to fly incursion, it would be very thankful if you suggest a Korean fleet since we run newbie fleets.

I am a simple man. I see shit gettin dunked, I upvote.

Luckily I spent those three hours mining with my horde rorqs

Ah, nope, that would be a Naga! (Battlecruiser).

Unfortunately the new wave of bots have the ability to react to local and scan sigs.
---
Very observant players can often get a sense for bot behavior by their scripted like actions.
---
He was right in the past 40+ times, so he's definatly in tune to the scripts. The fact we have people defending bots as "these might be players" is bad news for players and good news for bots.
---
Oh sure the point was provide something that’s #worth to fight over. There nothing. Like delve is a great location geographically....or what would it be....spacographically? I dunno either. Anyway. 
---
There are regions with Garbo tru sec and therefore shitty sites and not so good ore. But for the MOST part space is space and my system
---
Is very much like yours. There no reason for you to leave your nice belts and come invade mine...and the invading is just going to be miserable for everyone involved even if I blue balled every timer. That’s simply not healthy.

You want titans on the Jita undock? Cause that is how you get titans on the undock.

Solo stuff is very fun, imo it’s more fun sometimes to be solo! In terms of newbie friendly, I would recommend joining an active Corp. There is so much to this game, that interacting with other players unlocks a lot of knowledge, you are always learning something new. If your dedicated to play this game solo, then I support you all the way! If you ever have any questions, please mail Dustey Chinguatles in-game, and I’ll do my best to answer any questions you may have.
---
Incursions need people anyway. Please keep learning how to follow fc orders
---
several caps, a bunch and of bling fit ratters, and misc retards that think the gate is safe despite that fact that it has been camped  for 4 weeks straight.
---
Yea see I just don't believe they could hack all the billboards like that, I bet CCP is behind this.
---
New player here, just started today. Surprised this game is already over 16 years old, I mean how could a game last that long and still looks like a new game? Anyways the graphics looks stunning. Really impressed with the trailer too.
---
&gt;when goons set standings their underlings need to adjust or leave.
---
Nah.  Whatever the reason is, it's not "goons have GotG +10, so we need to too".

Every roll of all 5 would be around 10-20% typically.

Even if they did, where are they going to use it to keep themselves proficient?

Same thing here in the US, we learn Spanish in school but unless you live in certain areas it's probably going to atrophy pretty quickly.

The game currently has some balance issues with things like citadels and capitals, and lots of bots came in from the Chinese server which have contributed to a sense of stagnation in the game. However the game is still plenty enjoyable in many ways imo. Ccp has neglected things for a while but they seem to be catching up recently with their balance updates.

Newbro question- what is a locust fleet? Google came up empty for me. My guess is just a shit ton of ships, similar to a cloud of locusts?
---
Those rorqs weren't allowed to be staged in that system.

i highly doubt every dread is cleared.  my bet is at least one medium sized cache remains if not more.

There were Supercarriers and Carriers involved in the "killing the Dreads" part of the equation.

Nope

This.
---
An additional perspective is looking at booshing post-nerf.  A random group of 25 ships doesn't make a lot of sense on grid.  It was not like CCP provided a way to link ships to a specific boosher except if multiple boosher groups were at least 12km apart.
---
Mar5hy mentioned a mass-based approach in an above comment (a good idea).  Perhaps having some sort of list like an ACL could help large groups to coordinate and setup squads and wings (which is obviously complicated enough to question the need for the nerf in the first place).
---
It was just such an arbitrary decision to choose 25 random ships.  A nerf to the very enjoyable playstyle could've had a bit more logic to it (eg  mass) or increased the cost to the hunting side (eg fuel) without killing the playstyle  #ccplox
---
true, sucks when content creators are constantly hamstrung by worthless individuals tbh
---
Titans.
---
That doesn't save your idea. The fundamental premise is completely retarded, no amount of adjusting will fix that.
