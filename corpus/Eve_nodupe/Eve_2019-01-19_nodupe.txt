---
CCP allows botting only to inflate their player count. 
---

---
Prove me wrong. 
---
Never not whore on snuff
---
I heard you teamed up with INIT so The Imperium wouldn't drop on you. What say you?
---
Other way around, more supers/caps need modules that prevents them from being repped.
---
&gt;Basically, if I want a tanking carrier I should aim for an Archon or an  Aeon. And for krabbing, Nyx and Hel (with their younger brothers)
---
Well a Hel is more tanky than a Nyx, almost as tanky as a Aeon  -  as long as you don't get neuted.  
---
Also Hel dps in PvP is insane tho since lowslots are filled with Drone Damage instead of tank.  
---
Nyx and Aeon got better tracking tho and superior fighter speed, oddly - because in Midslots you fit Navigation Computer etc.  
---
PvP Nyx got Propulsion Module, 2x Tracking Computer, 2x Navigation Computers in Mids and with its Hullbonus to Fighter HP + Neutresist Tank its the best Supercarrier out there if you consider fielding it.  
---
Also full warpspeed *Jew* Nyx with Hyperspartial Rigs and Damage instead of Tank is best carrier to crab with, Midslots stay the same as in PvP but you go for 4x DDAs and 3x Warpspeed in lowslots.
---
If you're not retarded tho you rat in a Hel like any sane person.
---
So with Supers its like Gallente &gt; Minmatar &gt; Amarr &gt; *Garbage Can* \&gt; Caldari, Gallente being the most versetile.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;Concerning the Leviathan, why can't it use Rapid Torpedo Launcher like  the Phoenix ? Even more, won't the Caldari titan have "better damage" if  this can be called like that with RTL, since the bonuses per ship skill  level are higher when compared to a Phoenix, even with the Siege module 
---
Yeah it better should use Rapid Torpedos, and for sure it deals more damage than a Dreadnought.  
---
Its just still absolute crap damage tho, you won't alpha someone of the field with your Missiles like Turrets can do.  
---
But Missiles deal damage in situations where Turrets can't track for sure so there are areas of application.  
---
Its just the Pricetag man, the fcking Pricetag on a Leviathan compared to its performance.  
---
Get a better Titan man!   
---
&gt;I still have a long road ahead of me before even having the hull of a  capital ship in my hands. Still have to train for Paladin, then  Interdictors... And with what you said, I will certainly not spend an  entire year (and more) training for something that will cost me as much  as a fitted Leviathan for rocks
---
A Paladin is a less usefull Revelation, Marauders need a design reword much like Assault Frigates before they got their Damage Control.  
---
If you use a Marauder in Null you might as well just Siege with a Dread. In Highsec while Missionrunning you're better of with less costly / less skillintensive Battleships like Rattlesnake or Machariel.  
---
Machariels also made a name "blitzing" lvl 4 Missions for Empires since the're pretty effective warping around and minimizing downtime.  
---
But Maraudersare not rally worth the investment and are totaly overpriced anyways.
---
Interdictors, Command Destroyers, Assault Frigates, T3Ds and Interceptors are really cool for PvP and also cheap and disposable!  
---
I can fly every empire Frigate and Destroyer with T2 guns its damn fun.  
---
Wolf, Hecate, Malediction and Jackdaws get fielded a lot in different Alliance Doktrins.

Repeated 4’s like that are a trademark of aryth, some people have since copied it, but usually it’s him

How does one get banned from the AT?
---
Not unlike all my experiences in supers since WWB...
---
Sorry dudes.
---
I actually like the idea. Would be useful as a counter against pipebombs too.
---
First time FCing, first time as logi in pvp, and first solo kill are the bests for me. These three things also still manage to get the adrenaline going after many years. 
---
Oh yeah...that's all they do. They are trying to catch the things that "can not be caught". That the stuff with all the good loot. 
---
Yes. The Eve Portal will send you a push message to your phone when a skill finishes training. The problem with that is that it's about 50/50 if clicking the push message will take you to the character that finished training. If not, you'll have to figure it out yourself.
---
You know, I think they should just cut off Dronelands from the rest of New Eden and banish the botters there.
---
Horde Renters*
---
should have gone for an honor tank
---
You just dd'd the CEO of sash...twice...
---
yet the goat fuckers in CODE will kill my non-botting high sec mining orca and let all these robots skate. 
---
argh, you messed up the punchline.  the meme is:  "Change my mind."
---
Back when I was really into starting a third account for a research alt, I was planning to start with a Drake blueprint. I don't know if its still the case, but it was a super popular ship at the time.
---
Now that I'm back, if I end up making another account I'll probably try for a bowhead or something. They seem to get blown up a lot.
---
Nope.
---
Move along.
---
I've never booshed or launched bubbles in combat.  I should do something about that..
---
Drakes were king of PVE back when I first started then they took out a launcher. Bowheads are def a good move as are orcas 
---
Just a classic ccp inconsistency. I still remember the first time we discovered it : « hey guys, I’m just gonna pop the adc and tackle this smartbombing mach! » didn’t go as expected. It’s also really dumb because you used to be able to cycle the dcu in warp back when it was an active module.
---
we've asked the people that seem to be doing it but they never want to respond. 
---
Killmails and battlereports are cultural.
---
Having fun, shooting whatever and not givinc a shit about silly empire-building fellow nerds is perfectly fine.
---
TL;DR: Go hug a tower Asher.
---
You need X units of hydrogen isotopes...
---
I play with an incursion community a lot, and most of them move their ships around with bowheads. So there's always grumbling in the chat channel when the next incursion area has you traveling through Niarja.
---
Few weeks ago one guy lost like 20 bil worth I think, we still tease him about it.

I paid Ozzy to do it.... he'll deny everything, but THERE WAS COLLUSION ;)

HI SASH &lt;3

lots of people use 4s
---
Yes, I am riding, so you know.
---
The day I see an alliance leader start collecting a paycheck for CCP I'll agree with you, until then CCP needs to stop being cheap bastards and not spending money on solving an issue that has existed for years and only gotten worse as time went on.

Hello,

Please take this to r/evejobs or tests subreddit /r/dreddit

I paid Ozzy to do it.... he'll deny everything, but THERE WAS COLLUSION ;)
---
It’s all lies
---
I think it's around 4-5 now from what I was told
---
My Spanish is super rusty, but I think the corp name he gave was "sure I'll tell you, asshole"
---
Thats a lot of carriers. What are they even supposed to be doing
---
I'm fairly sure none of the captains are quite as... Vertically challenged as me.
---
Exploration would also be a million times more dangerous, since you wouldn’t know if someone was a camper unless you’d personally been killed by them
---
There we go. Undeniable evidence.
---
Moved from horde to brave actually ;)

---
True but I was talking camps in general when they burn back to gate they feel they have a chance or have some control. I'm genuinely surprised by the low levels of salt I get from people when I SB.

---
I think that style of play is only supported in FW and really shouldn't be expected anywhere outside of plexes.
---
That was my impression, yeah, after watching a long presentation by CCP Masterplan about it at one of the player gatherings, then having a chance to ask he, Veritas, and a couple of the early members of Team Gridlock questions about it one-on-one while on the CSM. But I should note that I'm not a programmer at all. I *think* I was following them but I may be wrong in some details.
---
Some of EVE's problems are ones of fundamental architecture that simply cannot meet the demands that players are trying to place on them. I'm quite certain this is where CCP's attempted strategy to force conflicts to be more local that led up to Aegis sovereignty came from.
---
But it turns out you can't force a sandbox to do anything if the players don't agree.
---
Train up the 8m skill points until you're at 49m, buy the injectors and use them all at once. They will all be 400k instead of 300k.
---
i'll see you in supcom nerd
---
You couldn't be more wrong.  
---
I would’ve vomited on my keyboard holy shit
---
XIX is Test pets, right? And red alliance has -10 standing with horde, so I doubt they are friendly with the rest of Panfam 
---
No, I meant local markets far away from the trade centers. IIRC I read about some guy who built and seeded a well stocked market somewhere in Solitude. The former keepstar in Maila is another example.
---
The low tax markets around Jita are out of reach for single players/small corps, that's obvious.
---
In a .6, how many cats would it take to pop one of them?
---
Oh that would probably work. The way you said it made me think somewhere in lowsec or some other dead-end but still in the region of the hubs you listed.
---
I thought u can only fit mining ships inside rorq sma
---
You don't need to create a new group for that. Spectre or BB would welcome anyone to FC bot hunting fleets if people show interest.
---
Depending on the Apoc's tank setup, it might be pretty hard because the ton of CONCORD response you generate can push the system into TiDi slowing your smartbombs but not CONCORD killing you. Of course, if you are willing to throw enough ship at it, then you will manage to do it but it's likely a rather high number sadly. 
---
An Adaptive Invulnerability Field II BPO :)
---
Please for the love of god don't use raitarus when you're moving unsupported.
---
Best way is 1000% s/d cyno, deep safe + very close ping/safe with a istabbed/max hyper super. On the s/d cyno fit 3 webs and web the super as soon as you can, should get you near instantly into warp.
---
A naked all 0 skill Apoc has about 29k EHP so something like 3 meta fit cats IIRC.
---
There is a chat for people who speak the same language as me.A guy there admitted in chat that he does RMT often he buys and sells characters for real money, and that he does not fucking care about it.Screenshots and ofc logs were submitted.He happily flies to this day
---
I've been winning for a bit to long, what's the profit margin on that then? Obviously there's a 15min reset timer between, but what's the per hour rate?
---
yOu DoNt KnOw ThAt
---
why hunt bots when you can hunt fallible people?
---
And ofc he is in Pirat.The dude who made a post some days ago claiming that he made bots for himself and KWGA said that Pirat was funded with bot money.I guess no suprise there
---
Believe it or not I think killboards are too much, but in a pvp game statistics mean everything. If killboards and killmails went away, *something* would fill that vacuum, or the game would disappear for another game that provided an ability to collect statistics.
---
Could you imagine sports without scorekeeping? Nobody would care and nobody would play. The same would happen to Eve.
---
Looking forward to watching this
---
Yea you can be more easily bumped when using raits than say an astra for moving however as long as you have a decent bookmark you can warp to them just fine. If you are staying afk on one for a while and get bumped/killed its not as if a astra would have kept you alive much better. 
---
So how does this work? Form in jita, go to random dead ls/NS system and ffa kill each other 
---
If that helps you sleep at night 
---
Pretending TNT does anything relevant lol 
---
you forgot to delete the post
---
It was a combination of two things, one right after the other, and I forget the exact order because they happened so close to one another. The day after small and medium rigs were introduced, I bought two full sets of all of them (and four or five sets of the key ones) and immediately started researching/inventing T2 medium rigs for things like Trimarks, CDFEs, resist rigs, astro rigs, and Salvage Tackle, plus small T2 of the same things.
---
More or less simultaneous to this, people started suddenly training Leadership skills hard and there was a huge demand for T2 ganglinks. I did the same thing there: bought several sets of the BPOs and researched/invented the hell out of them. Then I started building them in lots of 60 and carrying them to every market I could reach with a Viator. By the time I was done, I had built more than 10,000 lots of 60 ganglinks.
---
For about the next four years until 2013 or so, that was my income. In particular, if you bought a T2 Trimark, T2 CDFE, or a T2 gang link in 2011, you almost certainly bought it from me. I had the markets for those things pretty ruthlessly cornered. That period represents about 80% of the ISK I ever made in EVE.
---
There's a heavily injected Omega account with that Orca. The trail to a user should be rather quick and easy as it is.
---
Horde still have a lot to do before they can contest NC. as strongest in panfam.
---
Who is he?
---
A deep safe is 100% safe though, whereas a raitaru you can still be bumped pretty easily.
---
true, but bit by bit we slowly catching up.  taking more of the power
---
I love killmails, it’s the thrill after the kill as everyone gets to see how much Isk they just exploded and if someone had implants. It’s such an important part of the fight that It would completely change my experience of pvp.
---
krabbing rock havens
---
I wasn't attempting the meme, unfortunately. 
---
I'd rather people provide proof rather than just arbitrary talking points about how Bots are good for the game.
---
Don't really think Horde will ever get to the point where it could take on NC. Lack of supercaps are just too big, but Horde have definitely become more competent, adding blessed beans and taking in new corps were a good move  
---
It's not like there is a need to measure the balance between them anyways, panfam isn't controlled by one alliance, its three alliances that are friends
---
the kikimora is the slicer your girl tells you to not worry about, i love the model.
---
I did that twice actually. There is also a Miasmos that warps from the NPC station to an Azbel over and over. He has been doing it for at least 4 hours now with the exact same timing.
---
I can't imagine the autism it would take to do that as a human.
---
Pretty sure this doesn't work. The SP is applied until the limit and then any SP remaining that would have suffered the penalty is removed. Otherwise you could inject a character to absurd levels of SP orders of magnitude cheaper.
---
Must be Mar5hy
---
Im torn, on one hand, cheap arks, on the other, Im really keen on not losing mine again.
---
The MER would fill that vacuum. Asteroid killboards! 
---
Caracal. Then did research and made cerbs!
---
You don’t remember the ships with pilots that suddenly didn’t have the skills to jump, or that ended up with 0 capacitor for no apparent reason?
---
Be there on the day, what you got to loose?!
---
Be less bad
---
How would one go about getting a deep safe?
---
A couple frigates apparently 
---
Smartbombing gatecamps
---
only the covert ops cloak lets you warp cloaked, that hasn't changed.
---
No, you still can. Check and make sure you aren’t within 2,000m of anything (like a station undock) when you hit activate.
---
Nothing changed. Use a cov ops cloak and don't be an alpha.
---
I guess he couldn’t feather his way out of this one.
---
You either use an incursion, buy one, or use one of the various tricks to spawn outside the system.

---
thanks for the post
---
theres other ships where its useful too 
---
active tanked stuff with cap boosters and fits that run drugs for example
---
it would also help with ammo and drones 
---
nobody say anything this is natural selection at work

There have always been low sec gate camps.  NOW it's killing lowsec?

Join CODE. and hunt bots in hisec.
---
He’s our mastermind market guru in the Imperium. If he makes a move in Jita, unless you’re Rita Jita you ain’t gonna win if you’re up against him.
---
The idea that CCP is going to do something to alliance leaders who have bots in their alliance, when all the evidence so far is that CCP can barely do anything to the actual botters - now that's a pipe dream.  If I ran an alliance, I would probably laugh at this, if I even bothered to give it a second thought. 
---
1) Does all the TEST members have access to all TEST space and can participate in moon mining ops etc?  
---
Yes on the access to the space, no on the moon mining ops. Each corp owns their moons and only their members get to mine their moons based on the rules set out by  the corp. Some do mining fleets and donate the ore to the corp, others have more loose mining rules and let people know whats available and let them sort out the mining on their own.
---
But you are welcome to generally rat, explo, or mine w/e you please.
---
2) And do TEST do alliance wide activities such as fleet roams or are those limited to the corps? 
---
We do both, and on varied level of seriousness. We have Strategic ops which are alliance wide if you can participate you should type fleets and are quite serious unless circumstances allow more levity. Skirmish ops are less serious and less mandatory, but people alliance wide are still encouraged to participate. Roams are both alliance level and corp level, depending on how the FC wants to run it. There are usually more corp level ones than alliance level ones on average, but both exist.  
---

---
Hmm how much dps do I need to gank an apoc?
---
At least they aren't low sec furries
---
I think nearly every official Imperium channel said HK eviction was an initiative thing. So stop trying to spread falsehoods.
---
PL vs NC.? Someone needs to fix his br's or I'm just missing something here.
---
Can confirm, "I'm dying" is a valid for of broadcast for reps.
---
Move the minerals of hotness to low sec so people will actually be in areas accessible instead of in accessible perpetual wealth.
---
Is there something you disagree with?
---
And then most will laugh at you for getting sour over "gf"... 
---
I don’t think much has changed. Imperium has always sent fleets into Germinate to hit it. We haven’t really stopped. Nothing unusual is happening. Horde and NC. Docked continue to skirmish with us if they think they can win otherwise stay docked. We’ve had to deliberately make smaller fleets just to get a fight out of them which tells as to how their morale is at this time.
---
5k actual players, everyone else alts and bots 
---
"part of the reason" suddenly became "exclusive reason". good to know you lack basic logic skills.
---
I don't know about you but something sounds oddly familiar there... Ah guess I'm just going crazy lol.
---
That was awesome! Shame you didnt get the kill
---
Unfortunately it’s those big battles that are your big capital fights. So if you’re a capital pilot that isn’t a carrier to do is part of that gameplay. In the last big battle us carriers weren’t even allowed into system because our fighters may have killed the server.
---
It was the right strategic choice by our side but it sucked if you were a carrier pilot looking for an air to air dogfight with the enemy.
---
Disappointed. Came expecting rage and only got slightly salty.

Did steal the comp from you guys ngl

Back with another Abyssal question. Sorry about all these questions I just cant seem to find good answers online. Anyways, many people say passive tank is good against curses. Say I run 2 pith a type hardners and some rigs and all my resists are at say 80% how much passive Regen do I need to counter a typical blingy Abyssal pvp ship?
---
Modules of various kinds. It wasn’t important at the time it was just what I could make money from at the time. It wasn’t until later before I became more strategic in my thinking.

At Eve Vegas CCP brought up the thought of fights with no tidi a few times. Might want to try walking before running. Like fixing chat.

The year 2018 must have been the worst year in PL's history. Where in 2017 they reigned supreme all over the Eve meta, in 2018 they basically just dissapeared, I have no other words for it. Nowadays, they're literally living just in the deep shadows of Horde now. How the heck could this ever happen?
---
I really hope PL find its spirit in 2019 again because goons (and pets) roflstomping eveything is just boring af for this game.
---
 
---
Fun cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred between individuals
---
4am on a monday tho, so probs not, have fun but!
---
Yes, people would actually undock and take chances not worrying about their killboard.. 
---
I’m a history major, and know a bunch of bullshit about Western Civilizations already, as it’s a pastime I enjoy. 
---
Capital pilots seeing an easy kill will take the drop. It’s just the way it is. Otherwise carrier pilots would never see much content. They’re a big anti subcap platform for a reason.
---
Many things are defective, out of nanite paste.  Station manager... seems to be seeking new occupation.  
---
Vexor BPO. Was never going to have to pay those outrageous prices ever again to run missions.

---
Stupid question I know. But to clarify as I don’t pay as much attention as I should. Multi boxing and botting are different correct?
---
Killboards are extraneous to the game and for good reason. They add nothing to the economic or territorial system. Fighting is only a part of the game and not that important to overall gameplay. Killboards are like "money shot" video collections, and even less interesting. The only usefulness they offer is insight into theorycrafting builds.
---
LOL I would love to see your logs where you are awoxing blues, arguing with them in local that they're bots and them responding saying wtf...
---
Hi CODE, do me a solid and go away please. Thank you.
---
Depends on your major, how many classes you take, how much you care about your grades, and your intelligence to the subject. 
---
I like your thinking. \^\^
---
yes gate camps have always reduced content in lowsec, they reduce the number of small scale fights that can happen and if anyone brings a large fleet to break up the gatecamp they 99% of the time run away, because the type of people that gatecamp are not looking for anything that fights back. 
---
Another dino egg hatches.
---
Killmails themselves are fine because they don't tell you anything you don't already know, but they should not be accessible by api.
---
It's borked. Just accept.
---
Stay calm miners.
---
You should be ashamed of that language.
---
I just want the cruor and ashimmu to not suck so bad.

Thank you, We have a few streamers lined up and im sure it will be recorded. Make sure to check back after and ill link the video.
---
You know, it's really funny... this is literally the thing I said when injectors came out and noone gave a shit because 1 million idiots wanted to train to the flavor of the month and didn't care about this game becoming shit.
---
Can this be the new passive income for alliances so people stop quitting this game because CCP made autistic crabbing the most competitive tactic.
---
Oh this isn't some backdoor way for me to advocate for them. If anyone in Goons benefits from KB elitism more I don't know them, my whole shtick is beating up much bigger fleets with very low losses on my side. I was just curious how people thought it would effect them.

This is amazing

Lol PL ran out of isk? Why they only in bombers?

Yes. Very.

So I gotta ask, is any corp out there running ops to find and destroy mining bot Alphas/Omegas?

Because that's the corp I want to join.

Having the skills to fly something doesn't mean you have the skill to fly something. You should be happy about all the easy targets.

Some bs like accelerated reactions
---
The general consensus about capital ships is that you should know what you're doing before getting in to one. A guide for supercarriers is like a guide for fighting a UFC match. You don't just hop in.
---
Considering how awesome this could look, tbh I'd like to see this as a replacement for TCUs :)
---
No need to shake up the meta needlessly, but it'd be amazing new artwork and lore-wise harvesting the energy of the star to power your society in a remote system works really well :)
---
alpha clones were such a good idea
---
I mean killboards are a complete overpowered way for any hunter to get free and super valuable intel. That being gone it would change the game slot yea.
---
Goes to show the state of PH. Can't even stop irrelevant alliances from taking their sov.
---
Soon to be goon renters by the look of sov
---
The talocan did it, then it blew up and made Caroline’s star 
---
&gt;I would say they should try and open source some of the code base and let players help.
---
CCP is never gonna do this because people will run pirated eve servers at that point plus they would not own the copyright of contributions ( something investors tend to fear ). 
---
Apparently! Not that I have any idea what its for.
---
Any advice on how to kill botters? Were having trouble catching them in frt space. Too fast for me lol
---
Everyone's going to have their first time using one though, and being told how to move it, how each fighter type works and the general fitting archetypes is pretty useful.
---
I'm like 95% sure I did this about a year ago, the amount in the info box might have been incorrect and it applied the SP with the penalty, I can't remember.
---
Please refrain from bringing your facts to this sub!
---
So in your mind how does a future super pilot actually go about learning these things? Magic? 
---
U mean skilll injectors?!
---
This is very lit. More sketches please.
---
this is really the only valid reason to hate Snuff
---
Truly an artist.
---
Playing with and watching other cap pilots.
---
It can be hard. The miasmos is the key target, since it fucks up the entire operation if they die, so that one goes first. Unfortunately, that's the hardest one to catch. If you can use non-flashy alts, have them in catalysts sitting on top of the Apoc, and wait for the miasmos to land near it, then blap it. Usually, the bots won't respond until one of them dies, so that's the quickest/easiest way to do it. If it's a shitty program, and they don't react, shit like this happens lol.

fyi it makes my day to hear that other people do (much of) the same inexplicably dumb shit that I do
---
Watching other cap pilots? Possibly via a YouTube video demonstrating capital mechanics? 
---
Real life carriers are "carrying" fighters. That's what they do in Eve.
---
If a "carrier" in real life doesn't "carry" frigates, why should it in eve?
---
If you care so little can I get one, I am a poor goon man and have no super :(
---
Apparently, you're not well versed in the New Halaima Code; botters are certainly not mining with their necessary permits. 
---
It would be great for Habit because then no one would know when we lost a ship ratting and the tax rate would be forever low
---
[:(](https://media1.tenor.com/images/7ce7f8a3c0c1f0240dd73e085ae3b0fa/tenor.gif)
---
i worked on a carrier for 3 years and i'm a lover not a fighter, where's your precious logic now?
---
people too busy harvesting salt
---
I've played this game for 20 years and I'm a sinner, I'm a saint. I do not feel ashamed.
---
Sadly, some of the botting programs are designed to have them all mining in separate belts, so that doesn't always work. Also, tank is a thing, so you'd need a lot of geddon/rokh's. The slow and sure way is the trusty catalyst. 
---
Something that big would be more cosmetic than anything else. I guess they could make one that acts sort of like a wormhole system? I dunno.
---
"Hound is friendly! Hound is friendly" ... interesting. U can see the name of the hound pilot in the OV.
---
I watched this while I had 3 clients open and I freaked out when I heard your shield/armor alarms going off in the background. Never mashed alt-tab so hard in my life.  
---
No, by actually fighting with them in game, seeing how to handle different situations, and talking to people you trust instead of a random guy on reddit.
---
No one joins Templis unless it’s for Rocket League
---
This is the way I think about it. I'm not sure current technology is actually able to handle these huge battles the way a lot of people think it should, regardless of how old or new the code.
---
I know, crazy! Right?
---
I mean, I tried to stage out of Nennemalia, but the costs of transporting hulls is too prohibitive for me. 
---
I mean I'm not the one making the claim. Literally no other game gives identifying information when they inform you a report has had an action tied to it.
---
Because putting energy collecting megastructures into scifi destroys the fantasy element that allows humans to interact *in space!*.
---
With even a fraction of the energy output of a single star we could build and launch trillions of orbital habitats containing a meat-based population numbered in the quadrillions. Or build a Matrioshka Brain capable of simulating so many human minds that you would need scientific notation to quantify them, while simultaneously sending out quadrillions of Vonn Neumann probes, loaded with the machinery to convert locally available planets into additional Matrioshka Brains, to every star in every galaxy that has yet to cross the cosmological horizon. Within 70,000 years the Milky Way would be home to an unquantifiable number of human minds. Additionally, this can be done *today* with our current technology since all it would take to start is a single exponentially replicating robot being sent to totally *disassemble* Mercury and turn it into billions of solar reflectors. The reflectors launched into orbit will provide enough energy to fuel the process, requiring little to no support from Earth.
---
This is not good news if you want to see people who may as well be early 21st century Americans fight each other *in space!* over the minuscule amount of resources they can extract without using the vast amount of power offered by an energy collecting megastructure.
---
So you shouldn't fly a cap until you know what you're doing with them, but the only way to learn what to do with them is by flying one?

Didn't say that. Have to assume you're just a troll at this point, nobody is this stupid.
---
/r/ithimktheydidthemath 
---
see this more information is kind of crucial vs just saying someone is multiboxing mining apocs, which while aids, isn't really obvious botting. And not doing anything to defend an mtu isn't really botting either as either a) he didn't care about it or b) he was afk at the time (because mining apocs).
---
Otherwise it just sounds like a bad witch hunt like every other "THIS IS A BOT" post on reddit just because they have more than 3 characters.
---
Lol Kim peek is this really you? 
---
Are you all planning on staying in J165157?
---
Okay no battleships.
---
You don't learn much being a subcap pilot watching caps cyno in and kill stuff.
---
Caught this shot of my cyclopes yeeting on some poor blood dread
---
&gt;Implying it's shit
---
Much appreciated. My friend and I both multi box when mining, worried that to a casual observer it might look like botting. 
---
&gt; The general consensus about capital ships is that you should know what you're doing before getting in to one.
---
You *literally* said that. 
---
It'll give something for dreads to shoot at that's for sure. *Flicks down sunnies*
---
I guessed it before I clicked it.
---
You mean 20 faction citadels?
---
You need 4 t2 cats working with about 600 OH dps each, for the kind this guy was using. 
---
Not possible with current tech? Explain to me then why battle royale games are pushing past 100 players on a single server at over 30 ticks per second without crashing half the guns and "modules"? If those games could slow shit down to 1/10 of a second...that would be the equivalent of 30,000 people on their server.
---
Seriously...what "tech" are you comparing it to?
---
Yeah d-scan immune pirate frigs and cruisers would be neat and balanced. Maybe the Cynabal would finally not be totally overshadowed by a navy cruiser less than half it's price anymore.
---
because no one in EVE is a type 2 civilization yet.
---
I don't know why, I can't bring myself to turn off the avatars from the channels.  
---
Why use Apocs for mining?  So the rats ignore them?
---
Courier bots?  I had no idea that was a thing, for courier missions I'm assuming?
---
They were fighting my alts the whole time? lol... I warped the vindi off so I could six box the support ships to try and save some of my scattered fleet.
---
Alpha accounts. Best "mining" ship for them
---
Arks are the only viable jump freighter so people are def going to try and cash in on it.
---
Free Alphas can fly em - I believe Battleships offer the highest yield/minute for Alphas
---
We can harvest planets in mass but the sun is 2 stronk?

Oooh, a Dyson sphere around each soon in place of a TCU.... Not THAT is an interesting idea. 
---
&gt;  someone is multiboxing mining apocs, which while aids, isn't really obvious botting.
---
its still against the EULA though. as multiboxing Alpha accounts is not allowed.
---
I missed the ping by 40mins =( 
---
His mom probably.
---
To add to that, if/when a Dyson Sphere TCU is attacked after ref timer is drops a random debuff on the grid, no shields, no ecm, no MWD's, something like that. 
---
That was only well after the talocan abandoned it. 
---
Yes, and the majority of calculations in those games are run client-side, not server side. Big difference from ours, where the server does the heavy lifting, and our local machines just handle the visuals.
---
Try open up the diagnostic tool in-game, and see how many server calls are involved next time you get into a fight...

Good times. :-)

This is build v665 of EVE's beta, most likely between the "Emerald" phase, and the near-launch "Gemini" phase, dated 16/11/2002.    
---
    
---
This build was recovered from a patch archived by archive.org, with missing files added from the launch CD build.    
---
Excluding internal CCP reference servers, no servers exist for builds this old. The earliest open source server only works with a build from 2006.
---
Sam hyde is one of the great minds of today. He's ahead of his time.
---
I want this just so we can dim how fucking bright stars are.
---
So i know the general thread is about the tech behind Tidi,but doesnt TiDi also slow everything down so that people can multibox enough characters to get those numbers in the first place?
---
Well see, the Jove decided to take this extra cool battery they found and hook all their systems up to it. 
---
Oh then some dead Empress blew up all the Isogen-5...

Talocan are (were)
---
Arguably the Trig are wielding fantastic amounts of power as well.

I suspect this has to do with the fact that our PEGs give us access to unlimited energy through Subspace. (it has to be converted over time)

aaaayyyy it's me

Too bad a Dyson Sphere would cost more in materials and isk than 100 or so Palatine Keepstars.

Goons will be first! :P 
---
Tbh there aren't very many things cooler than punching the universe itself in the face.
---
Have you been living under a tectonic plate?
---
He was not afk. He put the MTU out and I attacked it immediately, becoming suspect. It was obvious what was happening. You are free to go investigate yourself if you don't believe there are bots in Eve.
---
Eh, would there really that much difference between a self-aware bot and some of the players of this game by now?
---
They did.
---
They fucked that up too 
---
Passive income is cancer. The game needs to reward undocking. 
---
Third time's the charm amirite?
---
You could land, get out of your pod, ND walk around in them with you $70 monocle. 
---
Very cool
---
This just makes it more hilarious to me since at least for players, the last time battleships were a somewhat viable choice for "nooby" mining was about a decade or more ago!
---
I owe you nothing miner.
---
Wait, wha?
---
This BR has to be borked
---
I don't even know what the incident was.  
---
What even?  
---
I'm just confused right now.
---
A Titan is 14 Km long and think of the resources.  How long would a ring orbiting a star need to be?
---
I want them to succ harder
---
I don't really build stuff as my thing, but as with everything I've learned it helps to have multiple ways to make isk - and so I research blueprints mostly as a defensive ploy so if I need something later but can't buy it for cheap, I can build it. Most of my bpos come along those lines - things that are cheap, easily researched, common.
---
But that's not what you're interested in, is it?
---
The first one I made a long term calculated investment on buying? Porpoise. Stupid things are tough for me to haul around after they're built (I can hold a total of 1 in my dst, so usually need a freighter friend to move any quantity of them) but my miner friends like them, and being able to build them where they live means they'll happily snap them up.
---
Not to mention, they sell me minerals, I sell them ships. Win win, everyone makes isk.
---
Sometimes I've found if you can find a way to scratch the itch your friends have, both of you can profit from it.
---
Can someone explain the Apocs? What are they doing with them? I wasn't aware they were good for anything since 2009, **especially** PVE. 
---
1 for point, 2 for guns, 3 for prop mod, 4 for reps,

depending on ship of course

Cool, another untouchable fleet concept to toss around.

What tools to alliances have to investigate with definitive proof that a member is bottling? None. Who's job is it to manage the game, CCP or a random corp leader? Ccp.

It's as if you think it's a good ask to call the dog catchers to put out your house fire. Alliance leaders and game developers are not even in the same realm of responsibility.

I played in the first (and I think only) dust514 tournament as a shield tanked heavy machine gunner.

It was a great concept actualized in the absolute worst possible way.

As others have rightly said, the entire project was hobbled by end of life cycle hardware restrictions.

For the life of me..

 Ccp could have just copy pasted the old game onto pc and I would have been happy with that.
---
Really.
---
It gals me to know we were on the precipice of a first to market multi genre universe at war.
---
Imagine one login and fighting on foot across an alliance held p.i colony, pushing the enemy back then boarding fighters to clear a path to launch  (ala valkyrie) into space where you jump out of your fighter aboard a titan, run to the clone vat bays as a squad and launch into cruisers to chase out the security escorts that are guarding the hauler load of clones docked at the  that was feeding the ground assault in the first place.
---
I mean....
---
Where the fuck did my dream gaming experience go?

You are the same guy who probably fills out a form in Pen when it says on the first like to use a pencil.

I suggested this a few years ago.  Also, sun-orbiting platforms growing gardens and what not, the harvest of which could be sold for food, materials, etc.  Plus, 'hanging gardens in space' would look cool.
---
You harvest the star’s energy, you have it charge a weapon that, when it fires, melts a titan like a lollipop falling into a pool of liquid steel.

I’m for it.

There is a video somewhere of a bot having a fully coherent end to end conversation with a CODE nerd right on down to buying a license (what does a bot care right). 
---
Now that's a clever bot. 
---
I'd be too tbh
---
/u/Auraus what was with your behavior there? 
---
support fighter only carrier would be too op tbh, 3 scarabs, 3 cenobites or 3 dromis
---
Not enough dead Goon supers and titans.
---
I think even in terms of Eve's scale, it's an incredible amount of material for even one star. 
---
We are busy buffing Rorquals and nerfing pVP ships ...
---
I'm not sure if you've run the numbers but Snuff's extended batphone is more than half the active playerbase. Assuming snuff doesn't call their extended batphone list, their immediate batphone list is also around half the game's active playerbase. 
---

I really liked the concept of the game but it floundered pretty badly. What would be cool is if CCP was able to take the concept of the game and co-develop it with an additional company that can make a good FPS.

How so? When I open my map it just shows our JBs.

Instead of a sphere or ring it could be just a massive structure that sits alongside the star, similar to The Almighty in Destiny 2's original campaign. However instead of trying to destroy it it would just siphon the star's energy.

Look up the Space Pope's video about Pegs and how ships warp and make energy. Maybe that's why.

Yeah, you missed Clay Hakaari's video making spree from (almost) 3 years ago. Most of us didn't.

Considering manY Botters regularly extract old toons to make new ones, the metric doesn't even really Matter. How many of those were extracted now inactive Bots with 0 ISK in their Wallet? How much in ACTUAL ISK got banned?

We should have an r/eve award for the best copypasta of the year. There was a few great one's in 2018, but that from UALX (the original) was gold.

It's not bad when you have to undock and fight to seize the passive income. OPs idea =/= VNI ratting in terms of passivity.

Because the Paradox Corporation already has the patent on Megastructures and refuses to release it.

What was the conclusion of that discussion?

1. No. Just no.

2. Aren't there already ways to suppress your signature radius? That's an actual question, but I think there are already mods or rigs that do something like that though.
---
3. No. Just no.
---
Improve the speed of all manufacturing in the system.
---
EVE doesn't have subspace. Energy comes from generators (four different kinds if you check the ship building components).

I kept thinking people were talking in my coms while I was watching this.  "God damn people, shut up I am trying to watch something \*click pause\*  oh... wait..."

I actually really enjoy Abyssal mechanics the way they are. I would like to see more spawns of pvp gates but other than that, I really enjoy it. Guess I'm a minority though.

---
Miss your blogg, mate :)
---
Very cool! 
---
it would be annoying but barely will fix "rorq mining". Also don't you understand that fixing "rorq" will his everyone equally and could lead to the situation when the gap between organized entities like TAPI/ GSF and the rest will only increase?
---
Low estimate. 
---
I agree. +1 also for all those neck bearded carrier pilots I see crying all over r/Eve about abyssal pvp. Seems like a lot of people dont want folks to have the opportunity for guaranteed solo pvp. Like they want all of eve to be nothing but massive fleet comp fights.  Thanks CCP for making content for us who dont care for that way of life. 
---
And then no items would ever get lost unless you trash them?
---
Rubbish
---
suicide ganking would be beyond broken then, they'd have to rework either freighters or gank ships (which is practically impossible)
---
you make isk by ganking ratter noobs w/ bling fits
---
Well, to be fair, she wasn't really her self.
---
Thank you for single handedly breaking industry. 
---
Risk averse? If by that you mean fleets of 20 pilots and caps on standby just to kill a cruiser, then yeah. 
---
I literally had my Tristan hot dropped a few weeks ago. The carrier pilot spent more isk in fuel than what my ship was worth. That's when I thought to myself, "Dang, I wish these pilots weren't so risk averse." 
---
Sun mining for citadel fuel, so they dont burn normal fuel blocks. Can do it in all space and it works like an athanor except passive.
---
Big if true
---
So is local for anyone.
---
&gt; both sides would be more likely to think they "won".
---
I think this is why it would be a good thing.  The reddit propaganda war would be even more insane than it already is during wartime.
---
I wonder how many Keepstars it would take to totally enclose a star. I'd enjoy seeing the math.
---
I would guess that you need a LOT, if not ALL, of the mass in the solar system to build it.

Are you ustz or was it in august that you were in ?
---
Understood. Concerning the Paladin, I certainly won’t be dumb enough to field it outside of alliance space, or when hostiles are spotted nearby. But I also won’t use it to rat in anomalies, but to run DED sites and combat signatures (those Blood Raider 10/10 looks quite damn great). Of course, when I’ll need a more steady ISK income, I will certainly train for a Revelation and run anomalies
---
I know that I’d could do better if I simply picked a super carrier. However, I hate with all my soul how drones works, and Fighters are basically oversized drones ! And since I already have T2 large energy turrets, the train for the XL ones is already reduced. Plus, if I remember well, a Dreadnought is amongst the cheapest capital around :)
---
Finally, I would like to know if the Giga guns are any good in PVE situation. I know they have an awful tracking, but could this be fixed by using skills and Tracking Computers, since Revelation is armor tanked anyway, I should have some spare midslots ? If not, I’ll be better off using HAW guns.
---
Thank you man, you’re really helping me out !

No one said you owed me anything, I asked you to "do me a solid" aka a favor. Also my one and only pilot has never mined a single rock ever so jokes on you kiddo. When I did play, which was quite some time ago, I spent the majority of my time hunting CODE scum like you.
---
We are being spoiled.

It would took one tenth of a trillion isk to build a 200km tall space station, how much investment would you think it needs so that a lazy director could run an automatic ice belt harvesting fleet

While PvP can be lucrative if you hit upon someone in faction fittings, it's not really a way to make money. It's more of a money sink, actually.

Yes. Ships should drop a BPC and all the materials too. No seriously.

---
I don’t get the appeal of managing all the alts to do that, seems like a group of destroyers could shake up more stuff in low/null, but I don’t use autopilot any more.

Holy shit I never knew this existed. I feel I've been cheated.

It is.
---
Doesn't take much skill to light a cyno.
---
Very few bots operate on activities that have ever been passive.
---
I hope Tri can survive and regain some semblance of independency instead of living as NC pets. The game needs more independent alliances / small blocs instead of the current situation of goons, tapi and the north.
---
Great video, YouTube needs more of this, much better than the typical "If you have to ask, then you shouldn't fly a capital/super" answer that most "gate keepers" would give you. In fact, I learned how to fly mine pretty much from YouTube tutorials and messing around on SiSi. 
---
Apparently those are actually heat sinks, which makes sense seeing how hard it is to actually get rid of waste energy in space.

It's called star citizen.../s
---
The best counter I have found so far (other than ganking) is to kill the MTU that the Orca drops, then bump the Orca out of tractor beam range (max of 84km). He took all the Apocs to Jita and docked.
---
He finally talked in local so I convoed him. He had me as a contact. I accused him of botting and he didn't deny it. Just left the chat.
---
The Apocs are hardly tanked. Less than 32k EHP.

Those Russian guys who login immediately after downtime with Gilas and a mega-sebo hyperspatial mach and you will never be able to get the data chip from them. Super frustrating. The building respawns 1h after it was first killed.

Zero integration with Eve, this was just a mediocre FPS set in the Eve universe, which it turns out no one really wants.

I think we should tell the Powerblocs. Everyone is saying „We need to have more smaller Alliances“. 
---
But then proceeds to drop 60x Titans on a 10 man cruiser gang or shows up with 3 times there numbers in a similar Doctrine. 
---
Depends if you are in a null blob or elite small gang that kills all the baddies.
---
My advice? If you want to Proving Ground in a Gila, accept the fact that you'll get countered sometimes and just go in with a cheap T2 fit. Everyone gets countered sometimes! These 3 blingy deaths came up in sequence today and I laughed as it seems to be the circle of life.

Check me out on the killboards (Kibbler) and look at my losses; it's a standard T2 passive Gila and I take Proving Ground every chance I get. 40% of the time, it's a clueless misfit Gila that clicks the wrong gate or feels lucky. 30% of the time, it's someone ready for a fight, but with reasonable skills you have a fair shot. 30% of the time, nobody shows up and you get a free loot can that may cover most of the cost of your ship. :)  
---
Watching all these blingy ships go up in smoke has me realizing that it probably isn't worth it and you'll just get countered eventually anyway. Don't overpimp and enjoy the fights, and if you happen to lose to a HG Crystal Gist-X Boosted Gila... it is what it is. ;)
---
Something about asic miners
---
Thanks! 
---
Can't say they did not try.....
---
who do i sent my super loss mail too?
---
Ah, capital proliferation 
---
wow talk about reading and replying to super old posts. 
---
i mean ive had nyx drop on my drake before, two of them, at once.

Too many does not mean all, that one carrier pilot is put one of tens of thousands of cap alts.

what is it they call this, anecdotal evidence?

Yeah, but as they say : rules are made to be broken :3

Good luck in the Abyss mate :)

got a link to this br
---
dyson spheres are a bit more complex than what we have atm.
---
The killmail for stays is one thing but imho they should not display what the loot fairy keeps and fits of ships.. basically only show what was left on the field .. as that over time will give folks a layer of mystic .. especially in battle reports .. total loss vs kills would shit more into outcomes / objectives instead of “we lost blah but won isk” as in large fights zero fucks given if you win/lose isk tally’s .. it’s more than that imho  
---
And that changes the meta
---
YEah
---
Can a small gang (10-15 ships) survive attacking a Fortizar in J-space if it has a Point Defense Battery fitted? Would logi be able to mitigate it's damage?
---
Comon, give a guy break. He spends 300 billion minimum a month to get his vengeance on Grrrr Goons. Don’t ban him, the virgin blood what he sacrifices to Grrr Goons is essential vitamin to Delve pilots. 
---
Yes, and now that we are at it the next step would be that CONCORD holds your hand while you take out the V in PVP in the 1.0 starter systems
---
The main method through which ISK, dropped modules, and mined materials exit the economy is through the destruction of ships. This is a core function of EVE's economy and it would not function without it.
---
TLDR : we did some bans but it’s important we bait n switch back to skins ... everyone stay focus skins.. no feature atm .. skins ... 
---
Op success 
---
Yep, armor supers are superior in every way, please build them exclusively.
---
These could be added to the game as a lore thingy with some cool backstory, and have them produce strategic resources. I would not allow them to be built by players and only have 3 or so operational which can be claimed by players.
---
Hopefully this would cause conflict which we all love.
---
No stupid timers you slug it out in 24hrs and the winner gets control (mechanics to be worked out) No cyno jammers due to gravity produced by the artifact as this would be a natural cyno jammer, however there would be areas towards the edge of the system that can hold a stable cyno.
---
All systems that have an artifact have multiple gates into said system, due to gravitational anamolies cloaks will only work on the edges of the system.

I slowly undock my T2 Dyson Sphere...

Honestly I don’t know if it would actually be better if they ran at normal speed with all those ships. It’s extremely difficult to get everything coordinated on large scales like that and sometimes the tidi gives you extra time to think and prepare. Full speed would be crazy
---
Idk just my thoughts after being in dozens of these kinds of fights. I don’t mind the tidi, but the disconnecting is the bad part. 
---
Meh, it only killed 500 million people or so didn’t it?
---
As Uncle Benny said: ‘prenty more where dey come from!’.

Far more than that I would think

No one(human) is a type 1 civilization (maybe in lore). We extract resources from planets but nowhere have I seen any indication of technology that can utilize the entire planet's energy.

IDK. I still love that Rag that survived 2 waves of DD's.

Before I won EvE I would occasionally make a troll T1 hauler using an alt, set it on a long route through as many 0.5 and 0.6 systems as I could and then go to work.
---
What was troll about it? I’d put a bunch of double wrapped packages in it to entice someone to suicide tank it - the contents of said packages? 1 tritanium.
---
I only got a few responses, most were of the ‘well played’ kind but there were a couple of ‘wtf dude?’ ones as well, I guess I’m easily amused.
---
Music really took me back there, thanks!

Don't push them, TRI in 2019 found the undock button.

It won't until it can spur smaller corporation growth.

Such blasphemous abuse of the glorious TTS series! HERESY!

I never awoxed a blue. There's a difference between testing and killing. Unlike you I don't need a petty Dominix awox kill to link everytime people talk about bot justice. Especially with half a dozen of rmt botting supers on the payroll. 
---
I guy can dream can't he?
---
yeah but your better off getting a rhea prob comes out more cost effective with the extra cargo space.
---
I think killmails are fine but sites like Zkill are insanely OP, I mean in like a few minutes you can find out what someone flies, its strength and weaknesses and where. I think killmails should change in a way that they werent ALL revealing like, hide system/constellation and only keep region for example.
---
Should it be NCdock
---
I am no expert but I thought the idea of Dyson spheres were already redundant by doing a similar thing with black holes. Black holes are much, much smaller than stars on average &amp; thus need much less material to encapsulate &amp; harness their energy.

Arguing with people in local saying they are bots and doing offensive attacks against a blue is awox. Great comedy when I saw the screenshots, but you can't do that. 
---
There's an entire jr diplo team that investigates reports using a fairly reliable test, can ping for a public execution, file CCP reports, and threaten a CEO to kick the pilot in 48 hrs. Pretty sure I invited anyone passionate about bots to go join the team.
---
Very true, I was just curious if it was possible
---
Hey, that's rude!
---
hi this isn't tumblr and you aren't entitled to know how to use a supercap, gatekeeping doesn't mean anything
---
I think it would just require a different game plan and better coordination. Guess the only way to truly know would be to give it ago but in one way or another, it's not possible. I can imagine the disconnects are very infuriating :)
---
Came for salt, was not dissapointed 10/10.
---
Looks like a spirit bomb.
---
Never said it was, but if you’re going to join a discussion about supercaps, and your entire comment revolves around how everyone is wrong  without you actually adding anything to the conversation, you might as well keep your mouth shut. 
---
I dunno, if like my large arties to reload more than once in 90 minutes

So a one use bridge that can be parked in any station or fortizar. This won't be abused at all.

You mean ad screen.
---
the point of "if you don't know how to use a supercap you shouldn't get one" isn't gatekeeping, the point is that it's a succinct way of saying that using a supercap requires an immense amount of game knowledge that you really only develop by playing the game and using caps, like muscle memory
---
in addition a large part of using supercaps is confidence, and if you're not confident enough to just buy it and use it without asking reddit how to caps, you're clearly not particularly confident
---
it's a bit of a generalization but it's not wrong, and the fact that you're out here angrily shouting down people saying "you probably shouldn't be dicking around in a supercap if your first stop for knowledge on piloting supercaps is reddit" is not a good sign tbqh
---
Please put in oxygen isotopes again - thank you.

My favourite thing to do in this game is small gang/manual piloted PvP. The free flying in 3D space with the huge variety of ships creates new and different situations to adapt to every single week, even after 7 years of playing the game.
---
My most memorable moment was probably back when I was a real noob, fresh in nullsec in nulli secunda. At the time we were blue to the nearby stagings of NC. and PL, so I joined their roaming fleets. One evening I saw someone ("Spotless blade"?) opened a Cynabal fleet, I quickly flew over, bought one off contracts and fitted 4 differend T1 artys I was able to find. During the roam our 20 cynas found a huge Russian 10mn Tengu Fleet moving to an objective, somewhere between 100-150. We skirmished around them, outplayed their tacklers on and off grid, took different routes to get infront of them, this full fleet chased us off gates multiple times, hundreds of kilometers. 
---
Until we had killed every single Interceptor and Interdictor in their fleet, and 2 bad basilisks out of their huge Logi wing. I couldn't believe my eyes when this gigantic fleet warped away from us to go back home, not having killed any of us and never reaching their objective. I never thought something like this was possible and in this very moment I knew what gameplay I would pursue, I wanted to be this FC. I wanted to know how he did it!
---
Nice 3 minutes !

Amazing! It really takes me back to see the old login title animation from when I first tested EVE. 16 years later I'm still here. :)
---
From your comment history you just seem to be a perpetual whiner.
---
It's a mix of three factors, the servers aren't exactly the best and the game code isn't as efficient as it should be. In a lot of places CCP just added code in some sections until it somehow worked.
---
The players do the rest with their operations by inventory management, cycling modules, reloading ammo, commanding fighters, moving into a certain direction. This multiplies the amount of work the server has to make significantly.
---
Does it not? I have a corpie who goes out ratting in null to regain his sec status he loses, just to burn it all with suicide ganking burner mission runner Garmurs. He's actually making a profit with this.
---

There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking for help on here regardless of what it is. It’s pretty much the most active EVE Online related discussion site. You can also tell someone they’re in over their head, but that needs to be accompanied by some actual guidance of some sort, not just some standard generic quote to make yourself feel E L I T E for flying a big boi ship, because that’s what all these non-helpful one-liners are, they’re ego boosts.

Standup L-Set Ore Grading Processor. Never had the chance to build one, but it's max researched. I'll probably peddle it on contracts with a 500 mil starting bid...

yeah but if your needing to tank your fucked anyways

Not really.

The CCP conundrum, let's allow botting while moaning our asses off that RMT'rs are stealing income from our creative content.
---
and here I was expecting a 690 plex price tag, GG CPP. NOW im obligated to buy 2.
---
Currently, it would still be the same North vs. South.  But I guess stuff is also evolving, and as soon as the North get's significantly weaker, the coalition of the south will start to fade, since it's mainly built around the common enemy panfam, not actual big friendship
---
Yeah, Goons only had twice the number of pilots in the hole so clearly a INIT thing

If you never undock someone will take your passive income.

Offensive attacks? A super vs a Heron. Very threatening. Before that I was bumping the supers for over half an hour in a t1 frigate and nothing. After a couple of days I tried bubbling while the bot started spamming local chat. All of a sudden I'm the bad guy when they are clearly blatantly fucking botting and you are allowing it. 
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a3rwfn/a_comprehensive_guide_to_botting_in_vale_of_the/) another reddit post with chat logs from over a month ago with some of the people you deal with and shelter.

* Skywarker Xe also known as Skywalker Ke. One of his toons went to Fraternity who you have been friends with for a long time and were full of botters even since 2016-2017. The other one is in your renting space. Moving and cycling botters from one corp to another and when you deem them bots and awox and kick them they just join Ranger Regiment. Sky having ties to Ranger Regiment talking about one of his supers [dying](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003614/201811200500/) to an npc sotiyo. Chat logs of Sky telling one of his supers to stop working for the night because I shit talked him in local. Ha. These botters showing how time and time again Sky has authority over them. 
---
* banana Muutaras - thanatos bot who gets caught over and over again. Nine Nine machine - nyx bot. permanent life jiangzeming - nyx bot. GEGE DA - hel bot. Honey ISK - hel bot. [He Ku](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73778543/) who got killed and cycled via Fraternity after leaving Sky's rmt botting farm and got killed multiple times in capitals and supers. (chat logs) 
---
* SylvanasWindrunner who had multiple VNI and Ishtar bots that have been reported, killed and kicked multiple times by your "jr. diplos" and still came back. Only reason you kicked that corp out was because of late payment or no payment after months of reports. Some of the bots got cycled via Ranger Regiment in Sylvanas Windrunner United Fleet and continued to bot in the systems that you control. 
---
* Bankruptcy liquidation Team and A Fire in the Wiinter (+ probably some more) made-up corps by Sky to cycle his bots around. Thera Traltor corp that eventually got kicked or left probably due to no payment or whatever.

Don't get me wrong, I love laughing my ass off at every rager too, but this guy's actually placed in an Alliance Tournament which is quite a lot more than I'd be willing to be literally every single poster in this reddit thread as well as the entire killboard and general chat ever has. Just wanna point that out, sure he got defensive, but he's obviously done a fuckload more than a lot of us.

I hope you're not actually in PL, if you are go read the JF guide in our forums and stop spewing stupidity thanks.

D-Scan immunity would make fw plexes absolute cancer

Its better to jump out back to lowsec from HS, rather than wait and see if im "tanked" enough

Then you're self destructing too early, I find it much safer to have the Cyno up for an extra 5 seconds and warp the super in less than 3 seconds.

PVP Produces nothing and destroys things. It's the exact opposite.
---
CCP security is a joke. It's astounding they have no automated detection after 16 years.
---
The situation is so fucking bad it has to be deliberate.
---
This is the use case i had in mind... Not the overreacting comment about how this would be broken /OP etc. But for arguments sake let's say that the carrier can't dock once the other pods are on board / right after a jump... That would increase the risk / reward 
---
Unfortunately, the botter gives no fucks.
---
Except you don't need to know how to fly it now. Just press F1, light the cyno and sit back as 50 fax and 30 more supers come save you instantly
---
There is pretty much a bot for everything in the game except pvp (then they use broadcasting instead).
---
That is accurate.
---
Fine! Fine guys, I'll just spend all morning reading lore. I didn't want to do anything else. That's just fine
---
Then why sd in the first place? 
---
That’s what he does.
---
The problem is they have allegedly been doing just that for years. The result is what you see today. Why would you like to continue on that path?
---
you won't be able to jump, because you'll be perma-pointed. you get scanned at the previous gate. a couple of ships will point you as soon as you decloak, then the gank BCs will warp in from just off-grid, so you won't know you're being ganked until you are pointed. then you evaporate before concord arrive. you're kidding yourself if you think the out-cyno will save you. 
---
tank dissuades gank. it doesn't prevent it, but like a good bicycle lock it makes you less attractive than the next target. slaved arks with a-type plating have over a million ehp (and don't lose cargo space like you do with bulkheads). gankers will generally skip you unless you're carrying a silly load.
---
jfs going into jita without tank are victims in-waiting, and the only reason you haven't died is because the BC multiboxers weren't active when you went through. please consider your life choices. 
---
Would be very good for the game. It's difficult to accurately measure the "damage" to content a KB does when it allows players to pick fights because of free intel.
---
All the autists that have a problem with local should also have a problem with zkb.
---
No words about supercapital punishment though.
---
I'm disturbed that they we're all put on the market at the same time according to the timers.
---
\+1
---
multi sell. give it a try.
---
So that a cyno doesn't sit on the map for 10 minutes, so that randoms don't spot it passing through, screaming at all the locals that you're moving a super.
---
I will quit eve if there is no zkill.
---
Really hope ccp shows logi on km.
---
&gt; Prove me wrong.
---
&gt; Edit: Or change my mind.
---
&gt; Edit: Kill me.
---
well, that was fast
---
This. Logistics ships often being able to rep 2 to 4 times a comparable dps ship has to be one of the worst parts of eve.
---
And then people wonder why others don't fight them in cheap fleets. 
---
/r/gatekeeping at its finest.
---
As supers and caps become more and more affordable (skill- and isk-wise) by new players, I am so glad to see the end days of this approach.

Sun mining stations when?

I'm sitting at work wondering when I'm gonna get time to read it all. Sounds rather fascinating.

Dyson spheres are overrated. They work OK, but they're needlessly complex and over-engineered making them prone to fail. They have a really good marketing team though so people keep building them.
---
The stated framework work is in the post, you goof.
---
*en masse
---
Giga structure mod or bust
---
One of the reasons I love being in Init is the amount of boosh fleets we do. It's so much fun!
---
Yeah Co2 was the only one doing it outside gsf membercorps. Because co2 was doing it, a framework/troll was laid out to distract from just their assets. I mentioned that in another reply. Their failure to coordinate caused a lot of friction and butthurt, so when lowsec focused on them and they didn’t communicate, they blamed gsf for not sending bloc fc’s, but they wouldn’t turn up for any of the other timers.
---
Then everyone started hitting M-o.
---
They call NC
---
No one is paying them to show up and they cant coordinate for shit without that.
---
Not true. Only games like call of duty where one client computer acts as the host is this the case. Mass multi-player games need servers even beefier than CCP's to handle the massive load
---
Covers part of the mineral cost of the hull. And doesn't cover any of the fittings. Except in a few circumstances which are not outweighed by how much is generally lost from ship destruction.
---
Same
---
You can oplex for your allied faction.
---
Splitting playerbase would be the death of EVE.
---
And not in the "EVE is dying" way.
---
Fire ball touchy burn, no like fire ball
---
Rat spawns will increase your capturing time significantly. Even with high dps for your plex size, you're looking at 20-30% added time.
---
Public killboards provide a lot of intel and, for most operations where kills are published there, an objective record of what the 'score' of an engagement is. So without them, you'd have a lot more of a propaganda war about who 'won' a fight, and it would be harder to work out what your enemy might be flying or whether a character you saw was dangerous or not.
---
Fuckin Shadow Cartel, every time.
---
Yeah, well you are paying for the tech with a Dyson Sphere.
---
They have a good warranty service though.
---
Mind you some people who use em say it starts to smell a bit on the inside after a while.
---
The Brain in a Box update was one of such updates. The skill and other modifiers were moved off to their own system. And that took years to finish.
---
Well sure because CODE has nothing to do with botting, it's about farming salt from high sec players.
---
Eh. No point in arguing with someone like you who takes stuff out of context and twists words. You allow botters in your space and get paid by them. Simple as that. Lying, giving fake names, account sharing, kicking people out because they bring serious concerns to the table at an alliance level and they don't agree with your own made up "rules". Dodging the game EULA for years and doing shady shit.
---
Have a nice life. :) 
---
Yeah, it's a niche thing (only really useful for smartbombs or bosons on landing) but it would be nice if you could.
---
We're a nullsec Pvp corp, but recently we went with a small fleet into lowsec, since we had a nice wh. We found a drekavac sitting at a npc station, and one of our tacklers (playing for years now) proceeds to tackle it, just to get podded by the station guns. First laughing fit of the evening. He flys to jita to reship, just to get killed before docking because of suspect timer. Sure, that were 'stupid' mistakes, but he laughed so hard and saw the fun in it. (Also he didnt have to fly 30 jumps home with a drake) 
---
There would be no split
---
Everyone would go back
---
That's... not what profit is? Lmfao
---
Geezus you're making me a Reddit moviestar. 
---
You fucked everything up 
---
&gt; made up "rules"
---
Yes, not bullying and awoxing blues, and properly collecting evidence against botters so CCP can permanently ban them is a rule I made. 
---
Feel free to join other alliances that likes killing allies and randomly killing pilots based on your emotions, Foxy Bushy.
---
o7
---
Stay outside of PDS range?
---
And how does one go about knowing what they are doing the first time? Chosen's carrier video that precedes this specifically tells you to practice all the mechanics he teaches in sisi.
---
As a bitter vet who only recently made the leap to caps, Chosen's carrier guide was hugely helpful in getting me up to speed quickly. As I'm currently building a super pilot, this is timely.
---
delet this
---
I would make one constructible only in the same system that already has a Palatine Keepstar... 
---
I'd just like to point this comment out: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9whowm/weekly_reminder_that_marauders_cost_way_too_much/e9kuj1g/
---
I really like the Paladin, its the tankiest of all Marauders and looks amazing, I can't pilot one but if I were to train into them I guess I'd go for Vargur or Paladin.
---
About clearing 10/10s, a Rattlesnake does the Job just fine and deals about ~1400dps with sentrys and cruisemissiles. You don't need dreadnought-sized Paladintank in there because they neut you out.
---
Said Rattlesnake only needs 3-4er Skills, Drones and Cruise should be T2 tho, in 10/10 you bling your dps not the tank since you MJD in the last pocket and want to get out as fast as possible, so rooting youself with active Bastion Module is kinda contraproductive.
---
Also if you loose a sneksneksnek you can replace them easily, fitting + hull is about 900mil.
---
If you can't fly them yet you should consider ships that perform similar with less skillinvestment and costs, Pirate faction battleships come to mind.
---
As for Dreadnought ratting, since you hinted at Delve (bloodraider space) I guess youre also in the Imperium.
---
To rat with Dreads needs higher turret skills (or implants) and personal experience.
---
You want to clear anomalies within 5min - so only one siege cycle per site, how to achieve that is tricky: You need sites with triggers for the next wave. So warpin at 70-100km, siege green and blapp said Triggers to spawn the second wave, you will recieve damage but nothing a dread can't outsustain.
---
You need 2 Capital sized guns (I guess that answers your last question) to snipe at those battleships wich have really low transversal if you're shooting from 70-100km out and one set HAWs to deal with Frigates.
---
You allways want to shoot ships while locking up new ships to shoot to clear that site in one siege, so combatsites like Haven and Sanctum are far from optimal since they have no triggers and second wave spawns only if first one is completely cleared. Dreads have low sensor strengh and no networking sensor array to help them, you need 30sec to lock a frig and better allways keep targetlocking while shooting.Your best bet would be a Forlorn Hub, but you might want to read wikis on that topic too and test yourself. If Frigs get near you, you're fucked tho - might want to get a smartbomb too but I don't know if that helps much.
---
If you need to siege a second time your ticks diminish so better bring turretdamage, tracking and falloff implants.
---
If you get Dreadspawns in Forlorn Hubs you can kill them yourself within a second siege, thats a huge upgrade compared to normal carriers who need to ask for help and share their bounty.
---
This way you can clear about 3 sites per tick and get 60-75mil ISK before taxes.
---
Marauder Bastion (1min) and Dreadnought Siege(5min) are not too great tho since you need to sit there for the entire duration.
---
If neuts come through a WH or roam around and catch you you can't escape, since youre using mostly capitalguns you can't really track or damage them either.
---
Carrier can prealign to a Fortizar, not necessarily the Keepstar and warp of if hostiles warp to your site, you can select all fighters and press [Q]+[F2] to microwarpdrive them away so they might not get tackled and you might not loose them. Since warping out of site is still considered "on grid" your fighters might travel out of hostile range since they speed up to 11-15km/s for 20sec, once you're off grid they stop tho.
---
Carrierratting is way better since you can Track ships close to you, don't need high skills or ammunition, apply better and can clear sites with more battleships and therefore higher bountys like Haven and Sanctums.
---
If you currently have no capital I'd suggest salvaging, since its more profitable than ratting in subcaps and way more safer too.
---
While salvaging you get about 100mil/h+ with additional Boni if you can salvage a dread or factionspawns.
---
Open dotlan, look at delve and filter for NPC kills in last hour. Visit those highlighted systems and ask there in local to salvage!
---
You need a Salvage Destroyer and Industrial Transporter, fuck off with Noctis this ship is too slow to keep up while Supers and Titans are ratting.
---
Running 10/10s in Delve is not as rewarding as other 10/10s in other faction space. Goons overfarm their Regions and blueprints for bhaalgorn are at like 30-50mil now.
---
Better salvage - you need less investment, are safer and get paid just as much.
---
Also you need no skills to fly those ships..
---
ok so measuring it in delve years.
---
how long would it take, once finished, to pay for itself in energy gathered.
---
assuming no one blows it up
---
Is that Carpenter Brut? Few videos make me want to get back in the saddle and play EvE again, but unicorn moments like this really give me the push. You must have been fudging your pants for a bit there. 
---
My favourite experience in Eve is when I first watched Chessur’s slicer videos and learnt to manual pilot and fight outnumbered, and me and my friend went and disbanded a hostile Gatecamp after killing 4 ceptors and some light dps destroyers with just 2 slicers. This led me to quit my nullsec f1 lifestyle and eventually moved to a wh with a few friends who have similar play styles.
---
hey there buddy, you check the front page of reddit today?
---
Don't you go bringing facts into this.
---
EvE 2014 I went from hauler bro to region trader in my first 2 months playing the game. Bought a 80mil sp pilot off the bazaar and was flying carriers and stuff having a good old drunken ball in null sec getting those things blown up. It has nothing to do with the patch my dude, the players have always been there.
---
This looks like a Sansha variant tho
---
Hahahaha, no

Just don't do anything that Tri would, that's how you break into nullsec.
---
Everyone that matters\* would go back, leaving only bots and retarded goon/horde/test f1 monkeys
---
Fuck you're right
---
I've highly suspected these guys were bots. I'm currently based in that system and just got back into EvE. I have an Alt that can catch the Miamos, I've seen it quite a few times and tracked it, along with that Orca too.  Yes it does drop the MTU. Peek, I saw you and 2 others come through the system last night and was wondering why you all were there, now I know. Good info! Looks like its time to have some fun
---
im sorry im not getting any reference you may be putting out.
---
A thorax bpo so we could build more of them for mining instead of having to buy bpos for them. 5 mining lasers and 15 mining drones fuck yeah.
---
"Just another worthless sig of 100 dudes killing the north" that better title for you you salty fuck?
---
Because we're not sure what resource a star would make and what to use it on. Bottled sunlight energy to make a cap ship jump? That supplants the isotope market.  Fuel a citadel? Ice blocks. Ammo? Minerals.  
---
It's ok nobody believes me anyway
---
You're just rock fuck stupid. 
---
It's called eve o multi client preview. 
---
I love that music
---
"properly collecting evidence" You mean sitting on your ass and getting paid by botters while someone else helps ban 1 dominix bot and a few vnis while the super bots are running free with even more vnis than before?
---
"feel free to join other alliances that likes killing allies and randomly killing pilots based on your emotions" You mean like how you kick people from all alliance and "coalition" communication based on your emotion because they don't agree with you? Making fun of them to show everyone how much of a dickhead you are? Good diplomacy. [LOL](https://imgur.com/a/mjnOkz3) And how most of the times Slyce leadership makes fun and mocks people with mental disabilities or just simply awox people "to have fun" based on rash emotions?
---
Thanks.
---
I'm surprised EVE isn't pushing type 3 civilization.
---
Didnt the original human settlers come from a galaxy they basically used up all the resources of?
---
Unlimited energy, yes. Starlifting gives is resources.
---
This game sucks now. 
---
Beat me to it.
---
What has ElitistOps been up to these days? Has the independent thing been working out for you guys? No sarcasm or hate here. Im just curious
---
Could just be a Dyson swarm that is measured in just fractions of a fraction of a degree wide around a sun sized star or smaller, I would be more interested in theoretically easier to build but also future tech like a Penrose generator or it's derivatives around a black hole.
---
Fuck the triglavians are already using the Penrose process or something similar for their ships as it is so the tech is even canon
---
You called it. 
---
I’ve said it so many times. EVE is missing a lot. Binary systems, megastuctures, cosmic phenomena...
---
Civs don’t just XP lvl into being K1 or K2. If they have the tech, they have to apply it. It can be argued that humanity could be a K1 now if it really wanted to be.

I had way too much fun watching that. Command destroyers can be so much fun.

Blackholes certainly radiate energy. What do you think Hawkings Radiation is? Its not super comparable to the aberage stat but its still there
---
Ok this is epic
---
I was in the battle of 4-CM8I just after BIAB was launched. There was no TIDI, but our hull bonuses would be double-applied one minute, then not applied at all the next. It was pretty strange.
---
Im glad all the sub money went to pay for Hilmars Costa Rican mansion instead of dev costs.
---
Bots would still rule current server. Humans would play the rollback.
---
Hilmar has a house on Costa Rica?
---
Open source server? Do tell
---
Maybe like giant wandering (biweekly/monthly) warp gates that could be Von Neumonn probes sent out by the 2nd or even the 3rd Jove empires as a backup plan to reseed the new Eden open cluster after some disaster.

hell CCP could actually make straight up aliens instead of just some flavor of posthuman for once.
---
WTF you smoking brav? Me and my buddies in VAPE SQUAD are united by our common interest of huffing the phatest clouds, sure we may be IMPERIUM but we sexually identify as Vapists. Respect our identity or pay the price of offending The Mittanl (pbuh).

Nice, I haven't heard about this guy he seems a little bit like a different flavor of kurzgesagt?

The Minmatar epic arc already has much less valuable rewards than the other epic arcs. Lets not devalue it even further.
---
Realy cool login screen !
---
I gave it to you as payment for making me space famous. You're welcome.
---
Minmatar epic arc reward is already less valuable than the Amarr/Gallente arcs (Caldari is so much faster to bliz that you can't even compare that).
---
You are also forced to take only half the standing boost if you want to get the valuable probes. All other empire epic arcs give full 10% standing regardless of your choices.
---
This game does not need any more income sources. The new meta of “check my wallet” is so fucking boring. 
---
Again loose 4 min of my time for watch goon make shit... \^\^
---
You have to ignore all the goldfish brains on this sub if you want an accurate picture of the current landscape. The whole narrative of TEST being Goon pets is the example of this. Is TEST less powerful than Goons? Yes. If Goons decided to invade TEST would TEST likely lose? Yes. Does that make TEST a pet of Goons? No. You could make both those statements about any other alliance in Eve and all of the statements would be true.
---
The relationship between Goons and TEST has been acrimonious since before the fountain war. We were hard red.
---
It's the reason why TEST was one of the founding members of World War Bee. We hated Goons.
---
But after we were evicted from the north by Panfam we conquered a bunch of regions in the south. Some of which bordered with Goon space. And there was a definite fear of Goon retribution. But nothing happened.
---
And nothing happened. Both sides realized that we were natural allies. So long as we don't fuck with important things then we can shoot each other quite amicably. We were quite happy to be frenemyies.
---
After CCP announced that all outposts would be converted to one time only fortizars PL spend a month capturing all of Providence. TEST decides that this is not acceptable and takes the region is a week and hold it until the change over.
---
The victorious forces that have driven XIX out of the drone lands decide that their next target is TEST. At this point Goons and TEST are not blue.
---
Doom gives his iconic post adding the PL super fleet to the effort. At this point TEST and Goons (having realised that having the rest of null sec being enemies is a really bad idea) blue each other.
---
TEST drops a keepstar and PL and co respond by hitting their "I win button".  Legacy dropped our shiny new titan fleet (that we had been building while pan fam were chasing Bave around null sec for nearly two years) and PL got spanked. You would have had worst losses if the node hadn't crashed. Legacy held the field and camped your titans for the best part of a week. TEST drops a second keepstar and successfully anchored it the next day.
---
TEST was quite happy to be frenemies with Goons but PL hubris basically forced us to become bffs again and that you are now bitching about it is truly glorious
---
I learned a lot from your blog posts! 
---
If you're still pulling in a decent amount, just reset the timer and move onto the next one. Takes about five seconds. Otherwise move the heads around, or worst case, move the extractor and run a new link.
---
Could you suggest any viable fitting for a t1 explo frigate to hunt down asteros?
---
Step 1. Make a ringworld specifically for gathering energy. 
---
Step 2. Use all that energy to power a single Laster
---
step 3. ??????
---
well if you play with more than 10 accounts its hard to pay attention to what happends on each individual client. and when you are mining, you have to check each client like every few minutes. even while solo mining, people are hardly looking at the rock the entire time.
---
I guess define *ups and downs*?  
---
We got plenty of people with downs on this sub, stick around and see...
---
[Total EVE](https://totaleve.com) 
---
It's too bad they dropped the "Second Genesis" subtitle; I first learned of the game in beta and it's the title I always remember. 
---
Rhea has the best cargo space but the worst fuel economy.
---
Nomad has the worst cargo space and the best fuel economy.
---
Ark has the second best of both cargo space and fuel economy making it the best all around.
---
Meanwhile we can... no wait... could warp into the sun. CCP send us back into the space stone age!
---
Capitals are the new frigates. 
---
CODE only goes for expensive kills, also you can't extract salt from a bot.

Well given that his explination is published in Physics of EVE and is endorced by CCP, it isn't much of a joke.

Oh god if only it could manufacture fuel blocks with no input; just the material from the star.

just make thme more useful. minnie arc needs more love
---
Eve24 used to be the go to source but is a shell of itself now. Still worth the read when they publish though.
---
More people would fly logi
---
Not far from the truth though, see dreads and carrier fleets  more often than BS fleets (dreads are the new BS I guess, similar cost, more damage application, easier to move, just better in general :(...) 
---
Man.. didn’t think I’d get so much hate for stating an opinion. Instead of actual intelligent, thought out responses on why this wouldn’t work, all I got was a bunch of 1 and 2 sentence answers about how stupid the idea is. I’m a new player and I have to say this playerbase is probably among the most toxic of any MMO I’ve ever played.
---
That’s my point. I love pvp but I’m discouraged to do it because where’s the incentive for me? Besides getting my killboard up.. there’s not much.
---
I pay 79m for a hull, insurance costs 6 Mil, I get 22mil or whatever it is in insurance, yep this is a faucet 
---
Engine out? More like fun practice.

Jetcan Mining:
---
Was planning on putting a cloaked Miasmos \~ 15km off my Procurer and using a Type 1 Cloaking Device when I'm not actively tractoring a can to me.  Is this a normal way of doing it?  I figure I'll have to collect the empty cans into my cargo hold so I will be able to recloak.
---
Or is the cloak totally unnecessary, will High Sec Gankers usually go after the mining barge?
---
Thanks
---
Do they publish alot?:)
---
Oh wow thanks alot!
---
It's generally helpful to have an understanding of the law before commenting on it.
---
Rather than slander or libel, it's far more likely to be privacy rights and data protection related breach. While this would not happen for 99% of banned characters, it may occasionally catch the one off person with a ban whose real life identity is linked with their character, and could thereby become a data breach.
---
this issue was resolved with citadels iirc
---
Yes. Because all of those supers are out in the wild and not just dropped all at once in a mega-blobs.... /s
---
Just set Code to bad standings, dock up if they enter system.  No need to worry about cloaking and all that.  
---
Did I say otherwise?
---
It's time to let go of your hate ag.
---
I've explained it like 3 times. This also is not some kind of brand new opinion I just made up.
---
Did you just start playing the game this week or something?
---
It’s also an EHP thing. The discrepancy between supers: titans and regular cap EHP is staggering.
---
Okay....that’s still 22m that is being put into the game, your 79m just goes to another player...gg
---
Because we can't even build a Palatine let alone a structure millions of km in circumference.
---
Beautiful login screen.
---
fuck i knew i was forgetting something. \*runs to go get JF full of Tea\* 
---
So your saying its cheaper than the paletine keepstar????
---
Dysonsphere faction forts
---
&gt; using a supercap requires an immense amount of game knowledge
---
fighters are hard? lul. 
---
Eve as a game is all about balance. Its also a sandbox, a lot is possible. If you would make pvp morr profitable, it would kill industry, hauling and other jobs. Its not a only pvp game, lots of people just love to grind and build things.
---
If you want to pvp and also make this your source of income, find the right groups/people to play with. It is possible, easy. Just go out there, learn how to FC, find some nice buddies, you’ll get there.
---
That makes them the opposite or easy targets, so yes kinda lol
---
Been in a few of em. It's not bad in a carrier/super if you kind of preplanned your fighters path. I dont think I'd do one in a sub tho
---
The mere fact that less than 100% items drop will make sure this is true.
---
Not a joke to CCP, but definitely to Max. It's all just fun and games to make a disgusting mess of conflicting backstory, game mechanics and absurd additions.
---
He is probably referring to the EVEmu project: https://github.com/evemuproject/evemu_server
---
It's written in a (imo) outdated style of c++. but actually works surprisingly well. Although, it only supports the Crucible expansion.
---
Better news: EVEmu was forked by a single developer. It many more implemented features compared to EVEmu. But the developer is keeping the fork entirely closed source. You can read more here:
---
http://evemu.alasiya.net/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=1&amp;sid=fb4cf5c480d51733fa7d78ea71e6b634
---
Good information.
---
But it's a fucking game quit sounding like a virgin.
---
Max spent over a year developing this physics model, and had to negotiate with CCP and NASA JPL to be allowed to have it published. I assure you it is no joke to him.
---
I mean when there is a structure generating the passive income and it's permanently in space, it's far easier to attack where as a mining or ratting ship can simply be docked. The structures would generate fights imo
---
got 4 for the same reason
---
Where the fuck is Toroto!?!?
---
Wilmore is not a virgin. I will not reveal how i know this ;-) :kisses:
---
Add to that INIT 4k members,TNT 4k members,The Bastion 4k members and add dont know how many NPC corp members like you xd
---
It's an item sink but an ISK faucet because of the insurance payment.
---
"Sink" and "faucet" refer to the economy as a whole not your individual wallet. It's about the total amount of ISK which exists in the universe, and maintaining a balance between the total amount of things and the total amount of ISK. When you get blown up *things* are removed from the universe (an item sink). The ISK *you* lose as an individual paying to replace those things though lost to you still exists... it was just transferred to another player. BUT, the insurance you got payed is brand new  ISK which never existed before being added to the economy (a faucet). 
---
and there was no launcher that broke the client from time to time too
---
He just goes around saying "no"?
---
Okay wiseguy, I was wondering what the brake even was on cats vs the apocs, and if you would be spending more to gank them then they would be to replace. 
---
Skill injectors massively increased the rate at which they can grow though
---
Hisec mining is actually not that bad lol, it has lower isk/hour obviously, but the benefit is that you can do it 24/7 and afk heavy (with correct setup, not a hulk 4 jumps from jita in a 0.5 system ofcourse). Unless you're a delve bot, krabbing in nullsec requires some attention and roams can shut you down. Lower but 100% stable isk vs higher but more sporadic isk.
---
Basically this.  Find a spot to build that allows you to move extractor heads every couple of days and maintain the same yield.   After a while you need to destroy and rebuild your extractor, once one area goes dry. As you move extractors around the planet will slowly regenerate resources, allowing you to move back to your original spot.  Ideally you want to rebuild as little as possible.  After a few builds and some trial and error you’ll get the feel of it.  
---
well, I sort of remember having to download the complete client quite a few times as the patching sort of broke ;)
---
Exactly! The 79m you pay for the hull goes to the other player who manufactured the hull... It still exists in the economy even though it's in the hands of someone else  other than you. That's neither a sink nor a faucet it's just ISK moving around.
---
Meanwhile the 22M you got via the insurance payout is brand new ISK which has never before existed being *added* to the economy: a faucet.
---
you more or less need an alt to make you money, and a main to spend you money.
---
I mean. At least they get srp? Idk I got nothing here. It's fun to whelp 
---
Sure, but they also serves to normalize the field of battle allowing younger pilots and alliances to catch up.   Building in a decade long skill que tank for older alliances seems less than ideal game mechanic wise. 
---
Without killboards, everyone would give up and go krab.
---
&gt; where’s the incentive for me
---
Meanwhile there's people suffering from blueballs all around the galaxy because they cannot get fights and this chungus wasn't more incentive than getting a fight in the first place.
---
botting obviously, nobody can post/edit so many in the same second
---
It would need at least 10 exotic dancers. 
---
well this comment chain aged well
---
Your idea would quite literally break the entire game, that's the reason why you got the response you did.
---
I keep thinking I'm on the cusp of winning Eve. Selling all assets, moving things to Jita etc. But its all a sham. It's housekeeping. As an aside, have you totally won if you're in this subreddit? 
---
Id say by eyeballing an untanked Apoc would need about 4K DPS to be killed before Concord showed up, using Kin/Therm. A bit less if you could choose EM shield/Explosive Armour. Less if you bait Concord around with throwaways shooting other shit. Much more if they have any hardeners plugging holes.

We have an IP that was established in 2002, the first scientific articles were written even before the beta came out. Sure, there are cracks between the lore and game mechanics, like only systems with binary stars supporting stargates or the gates being able to connect multiple systems, which clearly isn't the case ingame. Still, no sci-fi IP is flawless and EVE has managed to keep a mostly coherent unit for a very long time.
---
Then, Max singularity apparently thought "what if... we break EVERYTHING". For no adequate reason (warp drives creating drag in realspace is not a sufficiently good explanation and thus everything must go?), a very large chunk of established backstory is flipped on its head, creating humongous conflicts between lore that was written and ingame mechanics. Why do ships have different racial reactor components if all they need is a small magic ball? What is this wondrous "energy" that needs "converting"? Why is subspace necessary when no such thing was mentioned anywhere and has no place, other than to be a cliche sci-fi trope.
---
No matter how close to reality or accepted theory the new additions are, they break EVE into jagged chunks and don't put it back together. It's nothing but change for personal enjoyment and that's what I mean by it all being a joke to Max.
---
Rebuilding and moving only the extractor control units should suffice, unless you plan on doing 10 extractor head P1 extractions. In which case you'll have to rebuild, yes.
---
Keep in mind that the resources on a planet don't move, but extracting too much in a single spot will make it go dry, since you'll be extracting faster than the spot repletes.
---
Yeah, I derped that. I'll repost. 
---
That's fine for subcaps where the EHP buffer is smaller and catching reps is not guaranteed. Not fine for supers where the EHP buffer is that large, espically when combined with officer resist mods.
---
Black holes also emit a lot of energy this side of the event horizon, they also amplify energy not entering them.

Last time CODE got me, they must have had a Warp In on me.  Their were a few Neutrals in system.  Combat Probes were out for a few minutes, I assumed somebody was looking for abandoned drones.  CODE entered local and before I could enter warp, they scrammed me.   Granted, I was in a Retriever, so slooowww, but they knew exactly which belt I was in (there must have been 13 or more belts but they came straight to mine).   Is there a way to share a Warp In, other than just saying "he's in Celestial 4 Belt 2"?

Worth mentioning that DARK did save two of the Rorqs on field.  We originally tackled four but for an assortment of reasons they weren't dying as quickly as they could have and in the engagements with the Muninn fleet we bled dictors and tackle and eventually two got out.

Does your entire JR diplo team still work with bot by inviting them in your alliance to really check if they are bot or not ? 
---
Welcome to r/eve, literally the worst. It’s not representative of the entire game. Most people pvp for the simple thrill of it with no expectation of lots of loot, the loot is usually just the bonus. There is quite a bit of skill/knowlege that goes into pvping proficiently. There are already tons of ways to make isk. There are however people that hunt others for profit, and can be very time consuming, but it’s obviously not guaranteed or stable income. Some people do solo pvp for income, they just get good at pvp and after killing enough stuff with minimal losses they will eventually get worthwhile loot, it’s actually easier than you would think. The issue you would run into with all modules dropping all the time would come with industry and the more expensive lootable modules. It would put a huge dent in the industry market as the demand for modules would greatly decrease, and the lootable modules - which are higher end, more expensive, and overall have better stats - would also crash and become more readily available to everyone as they would never leave the game unless trashed.  Not only would prices drop but it would also hurt other people’s play styles and ways that they have fun as eve has an almost entirely player based economy aside from a few small things ccp seeds.
---
Hope this helps.
---
They could've cloaked next to you and had the fleet warp to them, or they could've allowed the prober to fleet-warp them to you from the gate (you can initiate warp for other people in your fleet). 
---
I saw pings, rushed home, missed fleet, was disappointed.  
---
Saw battle report, wasn't disappointed any more.
---
LIke the Starforge in KOTOR.
---
Sorry about that. People are just responding to the fact that your idea would really break the economy of Eve. If nothing (or very little) is lost in PvP there's hardly any need to mine and to build things. And, from a lore perspective modelling a somewhat believable world... You're shooting at a ship until it blows up. It makes sense that a lot of the stuff on the ship at the time it explodes will be damaged beyond repair.
---
PvP *can* be profitable... but even if everything dropped as loot  as suggested you'd still only be profitable if you are reliably killing much more often than getting killed yourself. OR, killing things far more valuable than what you yourself lose. So PvP as a profit making business in-and-of itself means killing relatively helpless victims especially those with blinged out fittings or lots of cargo. Which brings you back to PvP activities which are *already* profitable even now: ganking haulers, miners, ratters, mission runners etc. who can't fight back effectively.
---
Meanwhile there's already plenty of incentives to fight for reasons other than pure profit of the PvP itself. For alliances to gain or defend territory for example, or just because it's competitive and fun and why you play the game in the first place.
---
If you want to do solo or small gang PvP while *simultaneously* making ISK I'd suggest Faction Warfare. Most of the fights in lowsec are found in and around Faction Warfare complexes. You'll be earning ISK (well, LP which you can convert to ISK through buying and selling) while sitting in those complexes. Spend 10 minutes conquering an enemy novice plex by yourself will earn you enough to replace the T1 frigate you did it in. Meanwhile PvPers will be coming to you looking for fights. The gate mechanics help too because you can see what's coming so you can decide whether it's worth staying to fight or if you should run because the odds are stacked too much against you... which tends to encourage somewhat even fights so long as you're paying attention. 
---
To be fair we also fly spaceships who’s physics work more like airplanes.

I didn't even know about that comment of his. This is pure gold. Also Thera Traitor is still in RMT. Sky with his own rmt bots moved to slyce renters from which he started making up random corps to cycle the bots around. They are still in slyce renters even with the fake Thera Traltor corp getting kicked for no payment or leaving.

I get incompatible build errors every update, I have to reboot my computer and restart the launcher, fixes it for me but still a pain in the ass.
---
As far as socket closed usually server side, but try lowering your graphics settings in the game menu.  I get this a lot when I play four accounts on high quality settings, I find that lowering them on at least a couple accounts fixes things. For me I think its more of a computer memory issue.
---
Admitedly, mostly I do not, only alpha toons I use sometimes are the ones that used to be omega at some point or another, so they are basically like alpahs with maxxed alpha injected skills, not sure if the T1 cloak is or is not an omega exclusive item, so I might have been off on that.

Yup. like I said, too problematic.

Ok, if I have to move extractor head I will also have to remove and rebuild storage and manufacturing facilities due to trying to keep link as close possible correct? BTW I have 10 heads running now with 2 storage 8 manufacturing facility and one launch pad. Don't know if that is most efficient or not. 
---
Also when scanning am I looking just for red spots or white as well? Keeping the slider in the middle?

&gt; "properly collecting evidence" You mean sitting

And yet the only evidence I have seen is you yelling at someone in local calling them a bot and they are saying stop tackling me, I'm blue.

Feel free to provide me and CCP evidence of proof, otherwise there's only two choices left. You are a liar, or delusional.

What if it can't dock at all. It can enter a siege mode where it's invulnerable and doesn't need a player in it, at the cost of significant resources. Something in the order of a bil per day. That way the toon piloting the 'base'  can happily join the roam. Idk just thinking out loud. Point is I'd love to have tools that enables truly being nomadic without over reliance on one titan pilot logging in.

I think we really really need a T2 version of the Leshak, unlike a regular marauder and its single mode, the Leshak should be able to equip XL weapon that spooles up much like some BCs can equip large weapons. This would turn it into a much bigger threat vs capitals.

The problems I see are that the current sov mechanic (and citadels) are just shit and annoying. The other problem is that ccp missed the point where they could have stepped in to prevent mega coalitions and alliances, so it is allways a sort of cold war rather then actual wars.

If you would like to ask for srp for this loss please send Kiloalpha a mail explaining the situation of your death and with the time and date of your loss along with a 200mill administration fee and we will aim to srp your loss within 1 hour

&gt; Dude, don't quote just the part 
---
You are a repeating loop; hence, I don't need to quote your whole post. So I shall repeat: Send evidence and let's get them killed in-game and banned with CCP. Anything less than this is a waste of time. 
---
which, fwiw, is the reason the bounty system will always be shit.
---
payouts will be too low to be relevant, because as soon as they aren't you'll just shoot your own alt for free isk.
---
Bounties are pointless anyway. They used to pay out the entire balance after a kill, and then people started getting friends to pop their shuttle so they could split the paycheck. Then CCP changed it to be 20% of the ship loss, meaning you'll only get a decent pay out if you kill a decent ship. But it's probably pennies compared to the loot you got from the kill.
---
Targeting the ship is a waste of time b/c they can just build another one. Or they can sell that one to somebody and then buy another. Plus, you don't send a gun to jail for murdering people, you send the person who did the shooting. You are putting a bounty out on that person, not on their car.
---
Having their position advertised is dumb. That's what Locator Agents are for.
---
Overall, this is a bad idea. Bounties in general are a bad idea. Unless they function more like Killrights, allowing you to flag somebody, they're pointless.
---
You misunderstand. By money sink, I mean a way for CCP to remove money from the economy, combating inflation.
---
You cannot look at PvP as just another activity to earn money. PvP is where you go to spend your money to have fun. It's not meant to be an entirely sustainable activity, unless you're that good.
---
I'm impressed that the 'Ranis got top damage there. That's hilarious.
---
So I repeat. Stop exploiting botters for your own income. You are have no authority over evidence involving bots. Especially when you help them.
---
Under your proposal.
---
Enter system. See person in local. Put bounty on them until their location pops up. Warp to them and kill them. Get your money back. Repeat.
---
Possibly the worst "fix" for the bounty system I've seen so far.
---
assuming his alt doesn't kill him first and get your money.

Thank you good sir!
---
That is not how it works sorry... The bottleneck is, that all these calculations (actions) made in an eve battlefield have to be communicated to each participating client. That makes the whole serverload not linear but exponential. Additionally, also AOE etc scales exponential, not just the communication, which adds another exponential dimension. 
---
If I now repeat your calculation with battle royale: 
---
a battle in eve has 40 times as much players as your example battle royale, for every 100 players, the load doubles--&gt; 2\^40 is the load factor eve has to calculate, so about 1 000 000 000 000 or 1 TRILLION times the load of a 100 player battle. Your 300 more ticks per second look quite irrelevant now, don't they?!  
---
And nearly every calculation has to be cross referenced, otherwise players would start to die and then still get repped up again etc. So every little action has to be calculated, timestamped and then rechecked for further calculations many times, this rechecking is exactly the exponential part, and you cannot minimize this that much without decreasing the features.
---
Well to begin the idea of subspace is canon, as the concept of it is integral to understanding Abyssal subspace.
---
Secondly, the issue wasn't just drag. The primary issue was the notion of "anchoring" in space. Additionally, there are other problems such as how do we warp and recharge our capacitor without consuming any fuel. 
---
I also disagree with this breaks "everything". We do have to reconceptualize Afterburners, but there is nothing to preclude conventional thrust on top of the PEGs gravitational movement. 
---
The physics is sound, immense amounts of energy will warp spacetime, and theoretically could create holes in it. This is ALSO reinforced by the fact that the Talocan used the Dyson swarm to create Anoikis. 
---
Best case scenario.

If you're using the "fancy pants editor" there's also a "..." button that gives the option to codeblock text that you highlight. I use this all the time when sharing fits on r/EVE or r/fittings.

Right. I guess I need to be on pills like the day you kicked Kast and only made cocky comments about him and his real life. Btw, while I still have you here. How many times did you exploit the support ticket system that CCP implemented sending fake stories to get SRP for your afk rorq miners? And you were even encouraging people to abuse it as well on open comms because it's free so why not.

The Phoenix is however the *best* HAW dread, due to vastly improved application compared to even a Moros (which sports the best tracking of the turret dreads... but is otherwise kinda shit).

You only need to restart the launcher to download new builds. Go into your launcher settings, and make sure that ['minimise to tray on close'](https://i.imgur.com/NgvnFQ8.png)is not checked. Otherwise it will keep running in the background unless you manually kill the process in task manager, and this will prevent it from updating to the new build.

---
Thukker burners are the only good minmatar missioning strat 
---
Agreed. That still gives me shivers when I hear it. 
---
I agree but I personally think it would be more fun until everyone leaves. Killboards combined with local give people so much intel.
---
Good call. Now fix all those other issues by making good calls. Seems like you’re already good at making calls. 
---
It would probably kill the game because a large part of the playerbase just plays for killboard stats.
---
On the flip side, if you platinum insure a dreadnought and don't lose it for 90 days and let the insurance run out, you've participated in an isk sink since that 335m you put in to insurance is gone forever

Sure.. but we're talking about when a ship *does* blow up.

---
Dyson swarms themselves already exist as well in canon, one surrounded the W477-P Star that became Caroline’s Star - read the Inheritance chronicle for details on that~
---
I'm not disputing how each additional person compounds complexity...but your throwing arbitrary numbers out there. Also, it is not an exponential increase in server load whatsoever because not every facet and action in the game has to be sent to every client. Only the ones that affect them. It's an exponential increase in network traffic that's for sure. But eve is built on an interpreted language (pypy) instead of a compiled one. That means it's iterative. Each additional influencing factor (every additional player) doubles the load...non exponentially. Eve slows time down by a factor of 300-600 times slower than your average game...not because it's under exponentially higher pressure, but rather because it's written in a coding language that is 15-400 times slower at calculations compare to other languages. 
---
Even using the low end of those numbers for comparison is emberassing. Think about it this way, with your assumption that eve has billions upon trillions more capability to handle load than a game with 200 players...why is it that they stick to one tick per second for "simple" 200 men battles? Or when you're flying around in a 10 man system? Surely they could handle it right? Make it so I actually enter warp in 1.3 seconds...instead of 2? 
---
Eve craps out to 0.1 ticks/second after 2000 people hit local. That means they are physically incapable of calculating a 100 person battle at 30-40 ticks per second. Every game has dozens if not hundreds of factors and positional calculations between every player each second. There's nothing extra special about eve that makes it more complex from a architecture load standpoint...other than they chose the shitiest cheapest language to build it on.

I have mine on a four day cycle and move the extraction heads about once a month or so.
---
Key is scouting the planets, look for planets in the lowest true-sec that is available to you and really spend some time looking for the best placement in conjuction with the hot spots.
---
It can take a while and a lot of planning but doing so will pay itself back. 
---
Use pyfa and check for yourself how much a carrier can apply. Subtract that from your Targets resistances and active tank.
---
Hint: Its not that much!
---
Allways keep in mind that a carrier can't tackle you and you're free to warp of. If you choose to kite fighters they can only follow you for 20sec until you outrun them.
---
Even Cruiser-sized Vessels can simply slowboat away from Siren Pointrange. 
---
Smaller ships can even dodge dps fighters and tank them.
---
Not to say its easy, you necessarily need to know what you're doing but Siren and Dromi only travel with 1100-1500m/s after their MWD shuts off.
---
So just warp out.
---
Cerberus speed is about 1750m/s so you don't even need to overheat your MWD to burn away.
---
Shown Magnus and Pontifex are way faster than Fighters.
---
If you choose to fight against several carriers like in the Video above and choose not to bail but to stay and fight you are shit out of luck.
---
Know your engagement profile and bail if you see several cynos + carrier on grid, you had all time to do so!
---
Well, what is on the image is not strictly speaking a type 2 civilization, more like type 1.3-ish
---
You seem to miss that this is a private contact ;)
---
Pardon my ignorance, but what is a type 3 civ?
---
I’m not familiar with those, does that mean he got a Titian for 60mil?

The real annoyance is that the Epic Arc gives you 10 of them.

Not 16.

10.

CCP cannot be bothered to pay attention to detail and update the reward to match the new scanning mechanics.

TBH I'm fucking amazed they managed to update the Caldari reward to a Citadel module.

The default white background for pyfa sucks at night... Especially since pyfa is something you can have open for a long time messing around with fits.
---
Yeah it's been a pretty wonderful transition tbh.
---
Yeah, he killed me with that fit when flying my passive T2 Gila, so when I saw he was running something that expensive with his pod I was fine with it. ;)
---
I do want to try and pimp one out and active tank it properly, but need to get some skills up first.

Seed some merchandise in lowsec or nullsec, come back after three months and collect money

Hi Im 3 weeks in and have no clue about how the economy works but heres the drastic changes I would make.....people dont agree how toxic....wow lmao

GAHHH I LOVE THIS SHOW

Awesome read, thanks for sharing. I haven’t played in years but still enjoy the theory.

It's on Amazon now :P

Hello guys! I'm a newbean. 5 mil sp and 2 month playing. I just spent some money on the dlc packs and now I have 8 bil. How do I invest this money in something that will give me a stable souce of income for a long time?
---
Yeah its only a friendly comparison by any means we love our nc bro's &lt;3
---
I'm at 5 mil sp and my gila is pretty much maxed skilled. :P at least when I do all skills maxed on eve droid it shows no significant changes in DPS and tanking
---
So you posted something to the internet with no context and are then telling people that they don't get it because they don't know the context?
---
what a cute picture you've painted. Believe it though, you're still a pet little one.

Exactly. So they were likely running the exact scam that guy described. You set up the first two as private and the third expensive one as public

Only if they share it.

Ship fuel! Actually have a limit to how long you can fly before everything drops to low power mode and makes you crawl back to a station with no weapons or shields. 
---
Some seriously beautiful explosions when they inevitably blow up!
---
Congratulations, you were an exception.
---
It has *everything* to do with skill injected rorquals and you're objectively retarded if you think otherwise.
---
Command centers 5 is absolutely critical for PI to p2 production on a single planet, extractors take your power grid to99% every time
---
So tell me fake spaced, which "young alliances" have caught up to the big ones over the past 3 years?
---
Thanks, updated it.
---
Newbro here, what's RMT?
---
Make space tinted in your alliance colors, maybe make all ships in a system warpable as though you had already scanned them down. 
---
Make them the only way to manufacture XL structures. 
---
It's a low sec gank
---
not that I know how much they are out here, but how much are they in Delve? hull isn't cheaper than 50b... right?
---
Your statement is true for comparing a casual game session to a casual sport session, however, beyond that your analogy falls apart.
---
Don't forget, spaceships are serious business.
---
Like Pocos?
---
I'm referring to EVEmu's very first incarnation - from 2008 :p It's still up on Sourceforge, and supports Red Moon Rising v3913a.
---
Passive moon income *did* reward undocking.
---
If you didn't undock to defend it, you lost it. Is this really such a hard concept for you retards to understand?
---
Well, that's funny cause I didn't see that "socket closed" error for ages. I think that this problem is about your connection/DNS setup.

Someone would just get a rorq fleet going and then the stars would be mined out by DT. Entire constellations would go dark as planets fly off into space!

Remember, this game is capitalism run amok. The question is how much can you cover up or spin in a positive light! "Star explodes! Clears system for new developments! Planetary real estate cheap!"

Here’s a thing I’ve been thinking about: humanity is at a point where they can harness faster-than-light travel. I’ve done some calculations [*very unsophisticated calculations!*] on the Iteron MarkV, back when it still did 6 au/sec. I you think about that, that’s very many times c.

Don't know if he has a second leg in this, I think he's doing this just to be an asshole to mission runners at this point. He's having a good supply of polarized rocket launchers and Caldari Navy Ballistic Controls, though.
---
This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think the Breacher is way too strong for what it is. I would personally like to see it get a damage lock to explosive.
---
I don’t get that. If they’re making 1.6b/day, or even half that, wouldn’t it be worth it to use procurers on omegas? Surely you could make enough extra to cover the 1.6b/month.

This is 100% true.

RMT empires are a revenue stream for CCP and have been for over a decade, they do the 6 month cat and mouse sham for the real players but both we and CCP know how this works from a business perspective.
---
We left Earth a long time ago, and are never able to return due to the Eve gate. 
---
The Flat Earth Society accept that all other planets visible are globes, and the Earth is the only flat planet, so another flat planet in Eve would be unrealistic.
---
That's of course assuming that space isn't fake, as many other flat earther's believe. 
---
And this is why I will never join any northern alliance and will always fight them, so fucking bunch of hypocrite, trolling the imperium because Mittani said he don't give a fuck about botters it's not his job to deal with them but people should not randomly report goons because sometimes legit bee would be randomly ban, edit a video from it, only keep the part where he yell at the random guy and spend weeks "oh looks guy's don't join the Imperium they let botter free" Yeah look your own shit first please
---
Look at all these new wormholes to mine!

Just ignore the Drifters, Trig, and Sleepers ;-)

This is a regular tolerated thing now?!?!

Although for the convenience it brought for some things, the EVE launcher has been pretty shit since the beginning compared to just having a standalone client executable.

This. 2 battleships, 4-5 cruisers, is not a bringing "a bunch" of stuff to the fight. If they buffed the Ship Bay I could see that actually becoming useful. I mean it IS a carrier.

Ship fuel! Force those camping fleets to dock up or face a low power mode without weapons or shields.

Who blings a proteus lmao
---
Why do you go p2 on a planet? 
---
All my planets have one ECU(10 heads) 8 factories a silo and launch pad. Extractors extract, all factories P0-&gt;P1, pick up from launchpad. 48hr cycles keep ECU over 45.000 m3/cycle avg to keep all the factories fed, have to move the whole factory every two weeks.
---
I pick that up and take it and all the other P1s to factory planets that make P3.
---
I am new to this and want to know if I'm doing it wrong, goal is to make max isk selling to market.
---
Alien invasion that starts by literally destroying gates system-by-system would be entertaining. Have shifting links as players fight to replace them and keep the market hubs open.

What's to do in WH space? Genuinely asking not for a friend

Yup, good food/drink and bullshitting... always fun.

90% of people that gatecamp lack the basic motor skills to pvp anything that locks back. true fact.

Good video, the beat drop when the Bhaal died was a nice touch.

Me too, I spent a month in a lowsec corp trying a lot of stuff, one week after moving to a WH corp and I had so much more exposure to everything.

Drone/shield questions from a Gila pilot!
---
1. Let's say I'm fighting a Vedmak in Abyssal PVP, which has a pretty big Explosive hole with 0% resist on Armor, and it's next-lowest resist is Kinetic at 25%. Valkyrie II's deal pure explosive damage, while 'Augmented' Valkyrie's have a higher damage mod but split the damage between Kinetic and Explosive. Assuming the Vedmak is fit like [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74683700/) and only tanking Reactive/Adaptive, is it better to go Valkyrie II for the pure Explosive damage?
---
2. The Gila ship ability increases Medium drone damage by 500%. If I increase racial specialization which adds 2% damage per level, is that bonus affected by stacking penalties of any kind or does it get a 500% bonus as well (so more of a 10% increase in damage)? I'm considering skilling up some specializations to 5 with the assumption it'll all stack together nicely, but if there are heavy diminishing returns it might not be worth it. Any links to articles on how drone damage is calculated would be appreciated!
---
3. Is there a 'best practice' for active tanking a Gila? I see a range of fits in Abyssal PVP lossmails and as someone who typically passive tanks, it's hard to decipher which is optimal if doing an extended brawl against higher DPS targets like Deimos and Ishtar.
---
I wonder how many m3 of raw materials has been mined in game since launch... Like the grand total from every Ibis and Bantam of the past to the Orcas and Rorquals of today...
---
There a timer on the extractor that shows how long the current cycle will run.
---
Raid systems that you open to, explore, dank moon goo, PI, gas, relic/data, join a medium corp, content comes to you.
---
Get used to WH navagation and you can go wherever in the Galaxy you want real quick.
---
Mortons called, they want to know if they can buy salt in bulk. You seem to have acquired a surplus. 
---
Alcoholocaust is recruiting very selectively
---
Make it semi-illegal due to it being dangerous in large amounts. Like nullsec gets a free pass, but lowsec will flag you for picking up the materials or something and highsec just gets you concorded for trying. 
---
I typically have 5-9 logged in when I'm online
---
Some people have ships that are quite valuable, and worth a great deal more [at least to them] than the ISK they'd sell for,
---
WH life is full-on, for better or worse. From isk-making to intel, pvp and knowing where the fuck you are and how the fuck do you get out. Let alone the random access to all sorts of places and people. Everything else feels stagnant to me, by comparison.
---
W-space &gt; provi :)
---
Who did you join?
---
It's provi...what did you expect?
---
No need for sarcasm. If a fleet of carriers (specializing in long range attack against subcaps) couldn't fend off a couple of command destroyers *then* it would be imbalanced.
---
Naw  CCP despises RMT, spoke to several devs in regards to them. My face when I explained the players feel the same way about botting &amp; both should be punished equally and I was told that it was completely different, well not to fucking me.
---
genuinely a good idea 
---
Bold of you to assume CCP would actually get around to it now that the publicity is gone. 
---
Good ganks, good isk, good (and small scale) fleet pvp, access to all the cluster. It's high-stakes gameplay, in every aspect. Makes you care about the game like nothing else.
---
Wh space is the best.
---
* Best PvE and isk/hr in the game. No competition.
---
* K space is static. Same people, same system, same game play every day. WH space give you a dynamic region. New people, new systems, new adventures every day.
---
* Because the WH chain is new every day, you could connect 10 different null/low/high regions within 5 jumps of each other. In K space they are dozens, if not hundreds of jumps away from each other. #MOARCONTENT
---
* No local. Spooky, but honestly makes for a better Eve.
---
* No supers. No titans. No blob. Super rare to see 30 people in a fleet. 50 man fleets are unheard of. Mass limits on WHs means you can't bring too many big ships either.
---
* PvP is expected. You make so much isk losses (even 10+ bil isk across a fleet) don't really hurt. So why not fly blingy expensive ships? Why not bring the fight? What else are you going to do with the isk?
---
*WHs frequently spawn close to Jita. We probably get a WH 5 or less jumps from Jita 2-3 times a week. 
---
Honestly, WH space is how Eve was meant to be played. Once you go WHs you won't want to go anywhere else.
---
Also, MCAV is recruiting. mcav-public in game.
---
Damn. That battle was a good one.
---
Heres my perspective of it (I fly some Nestors): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8Y1o5X81IE
---
No one found the skillbooks yet
---
First problem is that sub is upfront. Bans for botting means the entire plex cost is wasted and not recovered.
---
Also I'm not sure, but I don't think a low skill HS Procurer actually recovers its cost vs a low skill Apoc enough to make plex. But I could be mistaken.
---
Any space is better than Provi space, unless you're hunting Provi.
---
and i'm sure all 3 of those people will be irate about this.
---
Everybody worth knowing is a Goon, a Goon ally, or on good terms with Goons. The rest are lacking in character and sophistication; wannabes, noobs and botters.
---
Welcome! Stay awhile ;)
---
I didn't know I wanted this until you mentioned it.
---
P0-p2 on a heavy planet can leave enough for 2-3 more advanced facilities therefore it takes 2 planets to pull a p3, across 18 planets on 3 char on one account you can pull 3.5 b of p4 PI per month. Got to keep everything balanced but you can do it eventually.
---
Praise Bob, bro, Jspace best space.
---
&gt; Naw CCP despises RMT, spoke to several devs in regards to them.
---
Hilmars opinion and demands over metrics is the only one that matters, not the peanut gallery that's said the same thing for over a decade yet still fails to ban super botters that have been active and reported that whole time. I'll bet they even threw in the old 'RMT is super bad for us, it costs us X in lost revenue every quarter' spiel inbetween pints.
---
Actions speak louder than words, especially when the words have never matched the action.
---
Geez - you people got warp to zero, what more do you want?!?  
---
I just check the pi window every time I log on, but you could add it to your calendar?
---
Killing them generally is time consuming, but relatively easy once you know how they work.   
---
Step 1: Get a cloaky alt to act as eyes (Even better if it's blue eyes), idle cloaked in system, eventually after a day or so the botters will normally add your alt to their whitelist and continue, if you have a blue alt you don't have to wait to do this.   
---
Step 2: watch them run a haven/forsaken hub or whatever the bot is doing. Jump your main in as they warp to new anom and warp to anom at the same time. Alternatively, set up bubble/trap in line with most anoms at the POS or citadel they use.  
---
Step 3: Kill the bot  
---
Step 4: [https://zkillboard.com/related/30003182/201901081700/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003182/201901081700/)

Not completely true, shadows would depend on what type of light source, what objects are casting the shadow and the diffusion ratio of surrounding material.

pls no boosh ravens mr rubal they are only middle-class
---
Apocs and Procs have similar yield.  The ore hold is what is the difference (that and the cost of the apoc).  Since they have automated the emptying of the ore hold, the botter doesn't give a shit about how small it is.  So alpha apoc &gt;&gt; omega proc.

That's what you do to instawarp, you initiate fleet warp and then web it as soon as you can.

I was there, I was the carrier

Well said. If you like to pvp roam, wormhole space is the shit.

as if flying anything sub-AT level in this game was even *remotely* hard
---
https://youtu.be/zSR7o5mMlEE
---
Yeah do not inject sp farms, massive waste. I'd say just enjoy it, you can buy ships and enjoy the game a bit without worrying about isk for a while. Outside of some market trading there isn't much you can do with that in terms of investing. 
---
To setup things like rorquals or a carrier etc you need a lot more isk. 
---
CCP can't even get a functioning XMPP server and you want them to code switch statements?

This was my problem with the batman speech about night being darkest just before dawn.  Like, go outside just before dawn and compare that to 1 AM.

So two extractors(4-5 heads each), and enough basics to feed 2-3 advanced to P2? Then bring the P2 to factory planets?

I'll have to run the numbers later, 3+B a account seems a lot, what I just set up makes 1.8-2.4 as I get used to running it, this is all in one WH system.

The character is just some trash belter who breaks speed records by “slingshotting”
---
4-5 heads on a planet with 170-220 per head at 2 days will over produce for 3 basic for each leg and 3 advanced. So you pick your p3 planet by which one has the highest yield the goal is to balance the whole tree less extractor heads required for better planets and maximize the number of times you can bring the whole production tree with the number of planets you have , organic mortar applicators are easier then self harmonizing power cores which are easier than the computer one, 
---
The main idea is to keep the whole thing constantly in operation, you will end up with two or three things you over produce and two or three things you under produce just stock them for when you rebalance every few weeks.

Well. I'd venture to say that the peacefulness and/or excitingness of your WH life has everything to do with the alliances you make while you're there. Otherwise, the wrong group gets a hair up their ass, and next thing you know, you've got 5 dreads and 25 T-3's hanging off of your astrahaus, beating it to snot...and nobody to come in and back you up when you get podded out.
---
It's crazy strong, it sort of just depends on what CCPS design goals are, all of the frigates are on a spectrum, and for a given use case they are absolutely not equal to eachother. The Atron is way better in FW than the Condor is, and while the Breacher is quite dangerous, the Rifter is much less so. Likewise RFF and Comet, and Curor and Worm.
---
In solo it's a bit self balancing, since you get to pick what you get to engage. If I was going to nerf one frigate I would nerf the FNC a bit, but as long as you understand your engagement profile you can fly whatever the state of balance.
---
The other 30k people are unable to log in for the same reason. 
---
Honestly, if you aren't terrible and bring PvP most groups won't evict you. We like content. If you are active and bring content to WH space then you are good in 99% of WH space's book.
---
As an ARMA player, this hits too close to home.
---
That's fair. I mostly just stayed in the general region around where I was basing myself out of; always was too scared to wander far from home, there were more than a few occasions where I'd have 500mil+ in loot from a day's trip just to get caught in a gatecamp.
---
What you say makes ZERO sense... It is exponential, of course it's not doubling for each player, but still the calculation load multiplies by a factor for each player. (this is btw also exactly what CCP says about the bottleneck of the system)
---
Why only 1/sec tick... well because it works, and it doesn't really gives a QoL benefit if it was lowered. It fucks over the guys with worse ping, it forces a fast reaction time more than a intelligent play, which most games have, etc. Simply put, it started as a necessity, and now, it's not needed but there is ZERO need to change it either...
---
Not every, actually most games have very few factors about positional stuff to be compared to each other. But ye, many games have these permanent calculation of vectors, single module calculation that has to be taken into account, but no game puts that all together and makes large battles with more than 400 players. And in eve, you can easily play with 1000 player on a reinforced node and it won't stutter a bit. Maybe, just maybe you get some Tidi, but only at a very limited degree..
---
Put it in summary: You may claim that Eve coding sucks, but every single other game that tried to make massive battles failed hard. So until now, there is absolutely no evidence that supports your claims... And alot of companies tried to take on these massive battles...
---
You die quietly

Get an Orca. It'll do all the jobs you want.

Find a public athanor with a reprocessing service, compress the ore and move to market, buy what you need. Honestly you lose a lot of minerals by reprocessing in high sec that you'll never actually make profit unless you are selling in non hub systems. The only ore i reprocess is the moon ore, I use those minerals for my production in a mission hub and sell the compressed ore in jita.

Man good thing he missed them off he was over charging you by 20 bil 😂
---
The thing is it's also more skill intensive... You typically run 2-3 weapons systems, and maybe 2 tanks as well.
---
So for a vet, yes it's powerful, but most people don't have the skills to max-pilot a Breacher. 
---
Ok, I'll look into that, thank you for sharing your process, I want to do this over two accounts soon.

We already have a way to alpha supercaps, and its DD volleys. I don't think buffing dread alpha to the point where dreads are alphaing Supers is a good idea. However, I do like the idea of increasing dread ACAP DPS, nerfing fax reps and possibly lowering super EHP to force a new balance point where dreads aren't so useless. Of course, I'm not a supercap FC and I'm 100% open to being changed on this...

Outstanding video was certainly worth the wait
---
awkward
---
If you could only find data sites, you were probably looking in a crowded area.  Use sites like Dotlan to find systems that are pretty empty
---
I'd be game for increasing the SMA to 2mil m3 and reducing SMA on Faxes and dreads to same as an orca
---
Hey some of the lave skins were only $10

Read the first paragraph dumbass: https://improbable.io/games

In a few months we are gonna have single shard MMOs that pit thousands of players against each other without so much as a hiccup from the server.
---
If CCP wanted to invest some effort into modernizing the backbone of this game...they could. You seriously sound like you're living in 2003
---
It's a tough sell to my casual guys, a lot of them will sign on by themselves and want to pvp, i have to say I'm afraid to take us into the plunge of a WH because of how time consuming it is to find content. 
---
It is a lot of work but you can make exponentially more depending on the number of accounts you use and the amount of your life you are willing to burn away, 20 min a day with coffee is the most I am willing to do and once a week for pickup 1h. gl

Something most people don't seem to understand is that I don't have omega. I'm using a faction warfare account to get omega, and I'm doing something else while training up mastery 2 or 3 for my Tristan.
---
fucking accurate
---
Negative
---
I've been in that position. If I really wanted to play it safe I'd scan a wormhole chain back to Highsec.
---
this one is by far the best imo.
---
You don't, you die and CCP laughs as more people buy PLEX to replace the shit they lost.
---
Not related to the frieghter.....
---
There are likely better ways (or at least more efficient ways) to skill into a ship than the masteries.
---
Generally build your support skills (https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14) and mix in other ship and weapon skills.
---
There are plenty of relic sites in w-space :)
---
No moon goo in holes, just upgraded nullsec ores
---
Zkill and other intel sites create as much content as they kill. Good luck roaming for content without any idea where people rat/mine or how active an area is. 
---
Sure, veteran groups with alts and spies would adapt, but it would significantly raise the barrier to entry
---
You have a cap battery, heat your propmod and everything else to get in drone range, then you build transversal and pray
---
The lie told often enough becomes the truth.
---
I was an elite nanogang pvper but Hard Knocks evicted me.

You could try Piracy Preferred or Ilethian Industries, we have a small wormhole alliance going on between like 7 corps and are looking for new people to join, we currently have a C2 for newer players and a C4 for moving into when ready =)
---
The only pilot in the citadel is the gunner. The rest arent in a ship.
---
Thats the way to go. :)
---
You, good sir/ma'am/attack helicopter, are a fucking genius!
---
Autz is a time zone

Good bot

If you were flying a ship with an ADC and realized you were about to warp through a boson or into a pipebomb, it would be really nice to be able to activate your adc while in warp, because odds are you’re dead before you land 
---
I don't think you can use freighters as alpha
---
Usually dislike you, but dude. You even mention this to CCP and I'll do (just about) anything you ask!
---
It's not a lie... you bring fights and people won't evict you... cuz fights are cool... unless you're a bunch of douschbags and piss someone off and make it personal.
---
Ahhh low sec. Never stop being you I guess.
---
awoxing a goon
---
Industrials, that's what I meant. Sorry bout that.
