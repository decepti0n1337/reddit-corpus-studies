Skip the mining.  It's boring.  Go for some missions.  Even trade missions.  It's a little more active

The nyx refits to plates and his armor jumps up. They dont understand how he 'repped' so much armor. They lock up the nestor but dont shoot it too :S

Even more greedy Chinese mouths to feed money into begin to surface...

Is CCP still even developing their game, or are they just following orders?
---
now i gotta ask. are you really that retarded?

Retri is still fairly sluggish for a frigate even with HG Snakes.

Yes. That’s kind of what growth is in a nutshell. Learning from your mistakes and not repeating it. Or do you just succeed the first time, every time, without fail? If that’s the case, how much do you limit the actual opportunities you take?
---
Say what you want bro, but this guy here is actually sharing content to /r/eve, *doing something*,  even if it was a fail to begin with, while you’re out here not contributing at all, even discouraging people from contributing.
---
Now, dont throw a temper tantrim, just because you are a nc fc material.  Dock your faction titan, forget the undock button and if you see a goon fleet turn tail and dock your ships in the nearest hisec.
---
:) good work, you posting that is very nice
---
Yikes
---
well hey at least now you can at least join an alliance with your favorite ccp employee as a mascot
---
Yeah main thing I'm worried about is getting back the isk to plex the accounts again.  1billion/hr is great for me as of now I only make isk on my high skilled exploration toon at around 250mil/hr
---
You must have a big phone screen
---
Wait, wut?
---
Where did you hear that they run off of moongoo?
---
CCP doesn't have a legal department anymore nor do they have the time or money to go to court for selling one model. Hell someone can set up a website and sell models on demand and they'd still get away with it. There's nothing ccp can do honestly
---
You have wasted this great opportunity to STFU... as usual.
---
None, the all must feed our corpse holding pens.
---
It's highsec, so no booshing happening anyway (apart from one fit mjd). Depending on Raven and Missile skills, Cruise Ravens can sit outside of range of the web and scram from the Fortizar, the Standup fighters have to travel a longer distance and since the only other weapon an Upwell structure has is also missile based, it gives you a lot of time from "Fortizar redboxing" to "incoming damage", making logi work easier.

You have a voice that is easy to listen too.
---
I mostly began eve with the alpha patch and started watching a lot of ccps presentations about eve topics.
---
Like 80% of Wormhole videos are presentations done by you and it was enjoyable.
---
If your voice would be really this annoying, you would not be the main wh talking-head for many years.
---
I see what you are saying, i too learned the game in lowsec if i am to really thing about. But i think when we say null blocks we are referring more to corporations within that null block. Sure small corporations 70 ish real players are more nurturing to their new players but that is not necessarily the case. As in everything it depends, although we can generally say hisec corps suck ass.
---
If only that instruction was followed, [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/80511666/) was the pod.

Definitely the actions of The Judge. It's hard to recall any event by any single player that has been anywhere near as impactful.

The true fact is Panfam called Test and ask them to make up a false excuse to go North !

I did some googling and found a reddit pist from 2017,which said that they could be reprocesses in the past, and that it was a good way to earn isk, but ccp removed that function and now is just junk. As far as i can tell, its useless. At least for now. Who knows, maybe it will have some purpose in the future, since it hasnt been removed? Keep it just in case
---
Why are you so salty about truth ?Still thinking your yesterday loss ? Were you the FC ? Is that you StarDesu ?

Cannot wait to invade *cough* i mean visit poland this year.

Joke aside. Looks good as long as they dont Start to go minmatar Style.

Oh damn so I can assume it's pretty rare? Even though it's useless :p

Maybe. Cant confirm nor deny that part. But even if its rare, unless you can sell it to a collector, its still worthless

Go in to character editor when you are docked.
---
Yes
---
but you haven't changed the travel time, the amount of ore in a rock doesn't influence their travel speed.
---
It will if they adjust it the way i outlined in the original comment as well. Which was me originally theorizing a direction this could take.
---
You're getting downvoted because you are a piece of human filth, not because I called anyone you dumbfuck.
---
Yield from a single anomaly. It's not like they are even limited. Oh no, krabbies' ISK\\hr will suffer, boo fucking hoo.
---
ITT - lots of people who don't mine, with strong opinions about mining.
---
RL doxxing is a thing that in history of EVE in 9 out of 10 cases was done by Sov-Nullsec-Nolifers.
---
I cannot see what stalking a super pilot ingame has to do with a license plat out of game. 
---
Does your tinfoil hat have holes ?
---
In part nerfing the ore anoms makes them more worth mining. But sensibly speaking you need to mine them with subcaps and CCP would need to prioritize their respawn mechanism change away from the "no more downtime" aspirational queue and over to the "try and fix things" important queue.
---
Doing that would need the redone belts to justify the time spent on them which probably means they become buffed by too much.
---
I still think the root cause that should be tackled is the excessive multi-box-ability of Rorquals. It shouldn't make sense to have more than 1 in an anom. Make Panic require indy core, make more than 1 indy core active in anom either impossible or start to cause an escalating amount of smart-bomb like damage across 100km. Or make it give each moon rock mercoxit like risks of damage clouds. All of it seems nice chaos-like unpredictables you could still do some vague modelling of to do a profit/risk analysis.
---
Yes those ideas are silly. Eve could do with a bit more unpredictable sillyness again.
---
Eve uni. Rvb. And some other grOulston have no idea how to run and are largely inactive.

It's actually fun to watch you be this uninformed.

---
Can I have mine with sprinkles please?
---
The Shopify coding interview was pretty challenging so they're probably not hiring tech illiterate idiots.
---
Or maybe I'm uber tech illiterate
---
Been running them a lot myself lately. You can get Triglavian Surveys, Mutaplasmid Modules, Trig Datacores, Filaments, Skills books and finally salvage if you can be bothered doing that. I originally thought they dropped BPCs &amp; other trig materials but found out real fast that's true. Have you had a go at any Minor/Major Conduits? Id imagine they have better drops but require a team
---
Oh man I remember how poor I was when I started playing, I asked if I have to load the SAAR with all 8 charges, because Nanite paste is so expensive. My space guildmates were so amused they threw me some monies and ships.
---
What you mean, horrible? So far I've never had any problems with it.
---
Speak English.
---
Fascinating! Here in the US basically everyone has a credit card, or a debit card they can use online as if it were a credit card.
---
CCP has a tradition of making PVE tweaks without announcing any details and letting players figure it all out. It's been like this for over ten years. HTFU.
---
You can always have someone 3d print one for you and paint that. It'll be way cheaper.
---
Oh, I see what you're saying. My first read on that was that you were saying they use moongoo as charges/fuel, and that sounded pretty unlikely.
---
This.
---
Station guns will shoot any ship using interdiction bubbles within 250km, so to stop bubble camps on stations.
---
Haulers did complain a lot about the original note describing the cyno change, which would have had JFs jump to covert ops cynos.  They felt the additional training burden was too large (they would have had to train all their cyno alts into covops and into Cyno V).  That's a big part of why the "industrial cyno" was added. (that and they felt a low-skill cyno option should be added so things like John Bellicose Day wouldn't be lost)

Isn't it about time this all becomes a war between the non-botting vs the bot condoning entities. I don't care if who blues who as long as it's to combat the botting pest.

Hello, newbie here:
---
\- Is there an indepth guide to how standings work? I'm Gallente, and I've noticed my Caldari State standing decreasing, so I thought I'd pop on over to Caldari space and work for them for a while. I've done a whole bunch of missions for the Caldari Navy and Hyasyoda Mining, and yet my Caldari State standing is not going up... I thought they were linked? Is there a more efficient way to bring it up?
---
\- Is it better to invest hard into one or two factions (which I assume means you're KOS with the opposing factions and are locked out of a bunch of systems), or is it better to play the middle? Is it even possible to build standing with all four factions equally?
---
\- I've done the three career schools for Gallente (3 schools x 5 agents = 15 quest lines). Can I do the same for the other three factions on the same character, or am I racially locked into Gallente?
---
Ok Boomer
---
To me, a game where ships were cheaper would be more fun. Since i could spend less time making isk and more time doing pvp. I don't really see the issue with cheap minerals.   
---
IMHO whats killing the game is that its just not fun to wage war, bashing structures is cancer especially when whomever you are fighting can just keep dropping structures, that you then have to bash.   
---
On top of that, there's not allot of reason to actually try to take other peoples space there's no incentive other than just shitting in someones oatmeal.
---
Ahh, merging KWGs main corp with 90% of the alliance mebers into TEST directly but putting them to "dead" also FI.RE is technically a Legacy Member/Pet ... i see no reason for any TEST guy to ride the high horse concerning botting/RMT
---
stupid nags,  why doesnt he sell his own t-shirts :D
---
The People who became the jove were the jove, There were existing factions that had come through the gate at the time, The jove were one, I believe the Tahk-Mal and possibly the Talocans were others.
---
The jove came through in their Outdated Colony Ships, Which took forever to get anywhere, They were safely in cryosleep on their way to Curse when the gate collapsed.
---
u/Ashterothi
---
Can you please explain this to them, You'll probably nail it better than me.
---
no u!   
---
there i'm playing on your level now, happy?
---
I'm pretty sure we clarified that you had retreated. You accept that that was the case then? That some troll toasting back home scared you that resolutely?
---
There is no way to be certain, however buying from a trusted party or using a trusted third party are decent assurances.
---
&gt; i see no reason for any TEST guy to ride the high horse concerning botting/RMT
---
I'm not. I was making a self deprecating joke about welping dreads.
---
You're the one bringing bitting into shit like anyone's hands are clean.  I was merely point out that they are not.
---
Interesting!
---
Don't forget the fact that a manned, defensively fit athanor forces you to bring at least 4 ceptors just to point a single rorqual. Even more if they utilize neuts, both on the rorqual and the citadel effectively. You're probably responding to some TAPI retard who never has to deal with tackling/making content - but rorquals on manned athanors are some of the biggest headaches to deal with if you can't instantly cyno a blob to it.
---
Yup, I use it myself. Still kinda humorous that a thread starts "the ads are too big, it covers the search bar" with a mobile screenshot and a reply follows "I don't see the problem" with a capture of a screen about an acre wide.
---
So that was the end of all the tutorial stuff? I'm on my own now? (scary!)
---
Would still make the terrans the oldest and most advanced, as they (probably) didn´t collapse. Even the Jove hat a setback after the eve gate collapsed
---

Maybe you should see if you have important bonds with anyone in Trigger Happy.
---
It's a real shame the site doesn't seem to provide any images of the final product. Really puts me off spending that much money on one if I can't see the end result.
---
with your logic, CCP creating eve created all playstyles so you can't consider anything buffs or nerfs holy shit.
---
Looks like I'm gonna have to start watching eBay for the old Eve merch.
---
I didn't know either of those ever existed!
---
&gt;just fighting to the last man every time no matter what.
---
I like them just from that.
---
ISDs are not CCP employees, so that's pretty retarded.
---
They have a lot of heart as a developing group, we speak with their FCs from time to time and suggest training doctrines etc. They've moved over with a lot of their players so collectively have a lot of players training up the slow way. Think TEST 2010-2011 era? I wouldn't be surprised if they graduate to welpcanes next.
---
You know... it would.
---
They just started playing their own game a couple days ago..give them time..
---
Also krab tears best tears
---
Don't
---
Well if everyone gets into ships to fight them and then ends up not getting a fight because the bad guys run away and then filament out after there timer is gone.   It a waste of time.   
---
now no cloak  and a log off timer of a few hours and your point is pretty valid.
---
There are also some strange, minimal changes to some attribute values. I wonder what those are for.
---
no, what i am seeing is individuals with no respect to privacy that prefer to shift the blame on the victim.
---
Falloff mechanics mean modules apply to up to triple the optimal range. Keep in mind autocannons have an optimal of ~3km yet you see people kiting at 50km with the things.
---
A T1 ecm stops having a guarenteed jam on a stiletto at 189km, almost triple the optimal range, which is way beyond the moon rocks.
---
The neuts are similarly overtuned, where they'll cap out tackle way beyond the moon rocks.
---
This is fantastic info, thanks!
---
I already ran the Sisters arc, and I believe I chose my home faction (Gallente), which probably explains why I'm so much higher in their standing.
---
Do people use a separate character for Faction Warfare then? Because I imagine it would quickly make half of the space hostile to you?
---
Yeah.. I’ve tried roaming in battleships before.. always ends up horribly.
---
Gonna try the high end filaments tonight.. hopefully better systems.
---
So...
---
Soon?
---
&gt;"hunters" were making threads crying they couldn't find anything
---
Yes salty nullbears were astroturfing the subreddit. It had to have been them because most hunters were out pvping. Krabs were the only ones with free time to shitpost on the subreddit since they were docked up so much
---
Probably not then
---
why do you think its called "precurser" ships and not triglavian ships in the market group.
---
I mean, yeah?  He says it right there, "remove his voter base".  This is a war on the people who put people like Sort into CSM.
---
Also - water is wet and poon tastes like pennies.
---
You're right, I won't. And I don't need to discuss my finances with some random person on the internet.
---
Yeah, I actually think this is a good change, but it should be in the patch notes at a minimum.
---
They used to to drop Faction POS and POS module bpcs. Would be nice is something similar would drop.

I never had the pleasure of flying with him, but my heart goes out to you and his other loved ones. Dealing with a loss like this is never easy. Just treasure the memories you built together.

In either case. I’ll lift a drink to his memory tonight. Fly eternal, Clinko. o7

This was beautiful. Thank you for posting that.

&gt; krabs remain. if they nerf safe and infinite
---
Dude, who is crying here? The blackout would have been fine if wormholes didn't allow easy circumventing of choke points and bombers/covert cynos are unbalanced/not balanced for total lack of intel. 
---
And we have been over this a million times, the only people crying were null sec hunters who wanted the fact that alliances have thousands of players working in concert to claim and hold the space completely disadvantaged in said space. 
---
In other words, the only people crying for easier less effort gameplay was you.
---
But by having RR in his coalition Sort is CLEARLY siding with the Chinese government /s
---
I much prefer it this way, not gonna lie.
---
The BPCs from relic sites should be moved to data sites. And I would like something to take the place of the old faction POS tower BPCs, which were the 'jackpot' drop.
---
But actually, how 'bad' data sites are is hugely exaggerated these days. Those decryptors are actually worth quite a bit. And there are occasional high value (50-80m) drops in data cans, too.
---
I have evaluated your option and I believe you are wrong.  Let's fight.
---
Do you think I'm wrong?
---
He complains that the server isn't even 1/3 paid for via patreon but hides how much is being pledged, the minimum he gets is $93 and I would bet 1/10th of the patreons he has is $5 or more, I would guess he gets $150-$200 from patreon alone
---
The server zkill is hosted on doesn't cost more than that.
---
So not only is he lying to us, he's also making a profit, there's nothing wrong with making a profit and he should go for it, that's not my complaint
---
My complaint is simply: Squizz is begging for the servers to be paid for by the community, but they already are, yet he's saying they're not and begging for more money for himself
---
that is the shady part.
---
I don't know, I think it says a lot about EVE culture generally given what EVE Uni was a decade ago, or even half of a decade ago. A lot of good players went their to actually help people learn EVE and stick around. 
---
The fact the culture has turned to 'just what I would expect from any old shitty corp' with terrible leadership only interested in blaming other people and silencing people who actually give a shit about the purpose of EVE uni in the first place says a lot to me.
---
ssh they are busy with skins ...
---
&gt;small ganksters.
---
I've heard of gankers, and gangsters, but whatever that is, i want to be called that thing.  Damn it feels good to be a gankster.
---
Hey were tits at?
---
simple : delete bpos and make all kinds of bpcs appear in data sites
---
Why?
---
I think I'd rather have that over PLEX sales as well.
---
Thanks Fuzz :)
---
Isn't CCP european?
---
I'm assuming the character is in FW, that's the only thing I can think of.

I want a nightmare...

I've got plenty of slaves on the ship to take first hit when the immaterium rips and demons erupt from the great darkness.

HELLO I OCCATOR AND I FAILURE TOO UNDERSTAND BASIC TENANTS OF GAMEPLAY EVE ALSO. BEST PLAY ALONE  OR MEAN MEN BEND MY KNEES.
---
Good info here.  I believe u/suitonia did a video on this where 2.5 standing gets you neutral and 5.0 gets you friendly (blue); I'm not quite there yet so can't confirm.
---
Also note that **the above standing has to be with the main faction, Guristas Pirates,** even though the rats will usually be from the Guristas Production corp.  I'm well over 3.0 with both Guristas corps but the rats still aggress me.
---
Thanks for the plug

nah man explo bots are a real thing and effort doesn't factor into botting, the effort is starting the script

The economy is too delicate to have bigger discounts, I thought everyone knew that?

his account is a few days old and you are recommending a 200 million ship, that hes going to fit with T1 mods?
---
Will do my best to participate. I'm rusty af to PvP and need to brush it off 😁
---
Double the size, double the price. According to the guy whos an intern in there, they are already selling them at minimum price.
---
They use hilariously expensive printing and seeing the rest of their selection, it's not very likely to change.
---
And who cares what they might do in the future, we're talking about now.
---
Yup.
---
Maybe throw some relic site hunting in there
---
Dont like things where i have to give mah email
---
As much as I hate PL, yeah, this scenario really would be awesome. It's about the only way there'd be a huge war between the superpowers without it being a one-sided curb stomp. Both sides need to feel like there's a decent chance of victory before they fully commit. 
---
(And if we get really lucky all 4 mega coalitions will collapse in the fallout and we can finally drop this endless arms race / empire building bullshit. Bring on the next dark age baby!)
---
Well, you're probably not that far out of the loop since you've only been gone a few months but they did slow assault frigates down a bit across the board so you may lose them even faster if you come back.

We need more of these meetings. In ALL Alliances.
---
I have a CCP-Branded Monocle. It's freaking amazing.
---
I like data sites, especially scanning them for BPCs and high-tech materials. As far as i know they're the only source of ligature and zeugma faction analyser BPCs - couple them with high-tech regional buy orders and you can make a tidy profit on their manufacture.
---
The value of decrytors vary considerably on buy and sell orders meaning you get a little market play out of them, whereas relic site salvage is *more or less* flat value because the markets are saturated with orders. The same is true for datacores, to a lesser extent.
---
It seems like data sites are more about long term t2 invention - an industry known for it's potential high value, while relic sites are the rinse and repeat ISK/stockpile generators. Relics go hand in hand with rig manufacture, sure, but datasites let you multiply profits by upgrading those BPOs to t2 BPCs. Plus data sites often drop those highervalue precursor arifacts required in storyline manufacture :)
---
&gt; finding a fit that anyone can agree on

That's because everyone has their own favourite fit to go for. Who cares if it's a shitfit it it's your shit fit :P If it works it's ok.

&gt; works for me as it just doesn't seem to give out enough damage, or survive long enough.

That's rather strange. A domi shouldn't have trouble to run lvl 4s. The usual approach is to fit an MJD and snipe with sentries. Maybe share the fit you tried and say in which mission you had troubles. Sharing fits is usually better for you to learn about fitting than just get a fit spoonfed to you.

btw consider to place such questions in the "noquestionisstupid" thread in the future.

No one does group Pve in this game

Enemy of my enemy is my friend

There used to be shit like terran small arms and such.

There are a lot of larger new player friendly corps and alliances.  I recommend Googling each one you are interested in and seeing for yourself where you think you fit in best.  That being said check out Karmafleet.  We offer lots of free skill books and plans to get you going.  Free ships to fly around and loose, go back and get more!!!  Free ships to learn how to rat and make money.  Watch some of our videos, if interested apply as told on the website, do NOT do it through the  game itself.
