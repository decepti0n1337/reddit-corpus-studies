The intentional destruction of PLEX on a massive scale has to be some CCP accountant's wet dream
---
---
---
So we need a EVE night mode with dimmable suns. CCPlease?
---
Yeah hes wrong. Its 6 hrs now, just checked. 
---
That has got to be the most savage burn I have yet seen on /r/eve, "you can keep your stuff."
---
Press releases always seemed lame to me. "Please clap."
---
I'd edit this so that you're not admitting to selling accounts and signed with your main character's name. 
---
Ehh... maybe? I don't know. 
---
It has always been amusing to me that most Escalations below 10/10 are actually harder and significantly less value. Unless we're talking 6/10s but lets face it, you're not getting that sweet sweet A-type every time. 
---
Reminds me of the goon dude that kept posting Horde discord pings while calling himself a spy.
---
If you get it to swap agro it should stop repairing 
---
&gt;  I decided that breaking ToS, selling accounts on black market, using gained money for family.

How many of these ships are based on already existing designs though? I understand they came out with other ships that serve different roles but it seems like they just used existing models instead of making something new. 
---
Well, shit, had some writing idea, on one point admiring mistake sounds good, from other - not.
---
or at like 3am
---
What the fuck do you even do with that plex.
---
In case you don't decide to come back... Can I have your stuff? =)
---
Just pay out of pocket for time it cheaper then buying isk.
---
Likely just different people moving into your farming areas. Highsec sigs are generally hit and miss because there's so many people running them and it's all random. 
---
Mining drops the price of primary materials, everything goes down in price while plex rises. That means you get more value of isk per plex you buy. 
---
For ccp, its best to keep it *down* not up
---
I drank it all. There is no more beer left. :)
---
(Tbh i havent had a drink since we went to the RSL over a year ago)
---
Just when I though I was out, they pull me back in
---
That because they had a cherry picked data and I can’t remeber the amount
---
you say it has nothing to do with organisation.... but isn't an "umbrella"  nothing but organized players working together?
---
Oh I know. I tried doing multiple things but it just seems like the game is set up in an attempt to funnel players into the null alliances. I decided not to renew because it felt like it was either some null blob or nothing. I chose not to do that. The alliances sound terrible and seemed like something I never wanted to be a part of.
---
As for your original point looking at new players and supers, I never found those interesting at all. I certainly didn't make a character because I thought the supers or null alliances sounded cool. I thought there would be more exploration and stuff. There's very little of that tbh. That's a bummer since there's so many awesome looking systems but they're fairly repetitive when it comes to content.
---
No! 
---
You can't catch me, i'm the Drekavac man!
---
I hate to burst your bubble, but most injectors are not being bought by those of us with a 90% reduction in SP.  It's being put towards our alts.  This would have a negligible effect on demand.
---
There is literally no way to separate injector prices from PLEX, besides removing the need for extractors, which will result in massive backlash, since that promotes even worse SP inflation.
---
See this is why we need booshing in highsec.
---
This is beautiful.
---
I miss Eve, it took up too much of my time as a parent, so i had to stop.
---
This picture reminds me of good times had.
---
Thank you.
---
If you think thiss makes much difference for me, you are wrong. Well, typical goonie.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Another one in the dumpster, great job.
---
The trade off is with expense.
---
Maybe one day we'll be able to do daytrips into the abyss.
---
2 very simple systems that would address pretty much every potential issue with name changes.  
---
1) add a "name history" tab to the character sheet, similar to corp history. list their previous names, and when they changed them (could help weed out REALLY stupid spies as well, since if they are changing names every couple months, something is probably up)  
---
2) when you biomass a character, the name doesn't become available again immediately, afaik they sit in doomheim for x amount of time locking down the name. (not sure if its a set period, or they just do periodic name releases). have something similar, when a name change happens, the previous name remains locked for x amount of time and remains "tied" to the character, so if you search for that name it will pull up the character under the new name.   
---
That way people who want to change their names can do so, without going through the hellish extract/inject process (with massive SP loss to go along with it) like I did. and it prevents people from using it to escape a bad reputation or try and hide, since their old name will still show on their info sheet, and anyone looking for them would still be able to find them using that old name.
---
This is incredible lmao

---
New band name btw
---
Got this idea and ran a level 3 in a Kestrel. Took five forevers to complete, but it was fun.
---
I really appreciate the giant casing being ejected and the loading assembly. It really reminds me of Clear Skies and the towering 1400mm shell that they forklift into the feed mechanisms. 
---
You only did a first order analysis, and you came up with an incorrect conclusion as a result.
---
Thing is, the more people trying to use PLEX to fund their sub, the more demand for the product, because that's more PLEX entirely leaving the economy.  CCP charges more for a sub's worth of PLEX than they do for a sub, so every sub funded via PLEX is more money in CCP's pocket versus that person just subbing normally.
---
Net effect is that the best thing to maximize PLEX revenue is to increase the velocity of it.  The larger the proportion of the player base wanting to fund their accounts via PLEX, the more demand, and therefore the higher the price, and therefore the more lucrative buying PLEX for $$$ becomes.  And the more other sinks they add for PLEX (like skins), the more leaves the economy, with the same effect (except that PLEX isn't offset by a "free" subscription").
---
So ya, they definitely care about the demand side of that equation.  They definitely care how many people are trying to fund their subs with PLEX, or buy skins with PLEX, because those are the only two significant sinks of PLEX in the game, and the stronger those sinks are, the lower the supply and therefore the higher reward for purchasing PLEX with $$$.
---
They dont have the apis that feed zkill? 
---
Sitrep, the day ended without a correct guess. I’ll ask him any names suggested here overnight and post the results tomorrow. 
---
Try WH’s. Ez isk, great pvp, some lore, always something new, few caps and no supers, exploration. And dropping on clueless nullseccers.

It always reminds me of the rebel transport from Empire Strikes Back. Loved it since day 1.

Right, the brits also didn’t announce to the whole world that they cracked the code either. Hit me up in game if you want to join one of my fleets!

I am a new player and I was training into flying carriers but now not so much after this nerf.

They don't have the tools. The data is all there, but sorting it is difficult.

as a new player, when I start mining in HS 4 years ago, my only main goal was to fly the biggest ship in eve, I recently get a Titan, I feel like my goal is achieve and now I must admit, I'm more looking for medium scale shit like blingy cruiser/bs or solo carriers/super

Imagine bragging about "mining salt" and then crying like a bitch because someone said words that hurt your feelings. Lmao. 
---
Almost as pathetic as dropping titans on SiSi because you're too much of a bitch to do it on TQ. Mega oof
---
I’ll give my input as a new player. 
---
When I first started playing at the beginning of this year, there was a lot of negativity around this reddit which didn’t bother me at all as I was having a blast, past few weeks things have calmed down as CCP has announced balances and changes that people seem to be happy with.
---
When I first started playing, I was in high sec for some time until I got a decent understanding of the game and jumped straight into Nullsec, joined a random Corp at first, which turned out to to be exploiting newbies BIG TIME, I know a lot of corps are “slave farms” as some might call them, but that one was selling 20mil ventures. Then I joined goons and it was way too massive for my liking. 
---
I did a research on corps and finally found a place I can call home and I’m happy with, now from my research majority of the corps/alliances usually don’t FORCE you to attend any fleets but mostly it’s preferred that you attend at least 1 stratop a month, so I think you should be fine with your busy life.
---
Nullsec is loads of fun, loads of content. Usually rather quiet on week days, at least around my area but occasionally people come by for a bit of and on weekends there’s always something to blow up. Pretty sure in Horde and Goons area there’s always people harassing each other, me personally I had quite a bad experience in delve as people would always roam around looking for something to kill specially when ratting.
---
This game gave me that feeling of my firs mmo, feel like a kid again and I love it. I really hope I don’t get bored/burned out from this.
---
Let me guess, you lost a lot of untanked retrievers in highsec and complained about "griefing"?
---
I had kinda a weird thing happen in a t3 electrical earlier today. first room looked normal, except to rats anywhere and the gate was locked. flew around a bit, shot the caches, structure, anything to try and get the gate to unlock (while filling out a bug report and taking screenshots... hell i've got 20 minutes before I die, may as well do something useful while i'm at it.)  
---
anyway, I approached the gate again to get a screenshot of the "there are hostile entities you must kill to unlock" notice thingy. but as soon as I got close i got warped into a room that looked rather similar to this, but no rats, no cans, just the wreck of a retribution and a floating corpse... kinda freaky. (I had just enough time to SS it for the bug report before blowing up, despite having 5 minutes left on my timer)
---
I was with you til you claimed tuzy as a random goon line member... that does say you don’t pay attention to null... even those of us outside the imperium know he runs the full gamut of logistics for the largest alliance in the game.
---
The greatest strength of the triage carrier was that it could receive remote reps while sending them out at the same time, just like subcap logi can. So battles would sometimes be stalemates with neither side able to alpha through the reps, and each side would batphone for reinforcements to try to get over the hump. In the current meta of capital battles, faxes are sacrificial pawns.
---
I have never seen a ganker get salty over anything. I've also never seen a carebear successfully do anything to a ganker's ship except whore on a CONCORD killmail.
---
I have seen a lot of gank victims get dunked and irrationally call the ganker "salty", though. Absolute projection my man
---
&gt; We all want more fights. Wouldn’t nerfing the almost impenetrable SOV mechanics achieve the same result?
---
No. (The current sov mechanics are by far the most understandable out of all 3 systems.)
---
To get fights you have to make people want to fight. And the way you do that is not by holding them hostage. You have to push up on the guys who feel at a disadvantage, so that they have something positive to gain.
---
Elitepvp advocated for destructible stations for years because they thought having more at stake would make the weaker groups fight. It worked out the opposite: the little guys won't even bother throwing ships at the sunk cost. They just fold and go join the mega-alliances.

well i did se wardecer loose to a mining fleet. 
---
Are you unironically calling words you don't like a "civil liberties violation"? The irony is almost beyond belief. In fact, you are the one arguing in favor of violating civil liberties by asking for censorship. 
---
Inb4 "hate speech is not free speech" lmao
---
I know it's anecdotal for sure, but I might have been considered a whale at one point based on how much plex I bought and sold for isk just because I hate the pve in this game.
---
That being said, I still play and even with plex prices the way they are, I'm not even really tempted to buy in, I just don't see the need to turn my real money into fake money for a game I don't really enjoy enough anymore. 
---
OK you did good work with no warp core stabs

With one dread, maybe.
---
**I use bold to make myself seem smart!!!**
---
Seriously though, your whole argument fails considering CCP would want you to PLEX rather than a sub. Why? Because Plex is $5 more. The only way for PLEX to get into the game is for someone to buy it. They made their money before it even got into your hands. Take an Econ class.
---
&gt; Observation.
---
Got it. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be outraged. ;)
---
I get what your saying but I think people who pay for subs probably do the three month deal which is a discount on all of their "PLEX" so they don't require a sale. I pay for six or 12 months, so even when they do run PLEX sales, I think I usually come out ahead. Don't hold me to it, though; I've never done the math.
---
Let's say I buy the 2860 PLEX deal. that's 5.72 months of subs for one acct. I know we can't buy in fractions, so forgive me for using fractional PLEX for this. So the non sale price if PLEX is 99.99 dollars. If you divide the cash you spend by the months you get, it comes out to 17 dollars a month. However, it I buy a one month sub, it's discounted from PLEX prices to 15. Multi month subs can get me as low as eleven bucks. Buying 500 PLEX is even worse. You pay 20 dollars to sub your character rather than 15; You pay a third more.
---
Given all that, I suspect CCP would actually prefer me to buy PLEX over subs.
---
as for PLEX sales, the beauty of having long term subs doesn't preclude me buying during sales and reaping the benefits. Let's say they do a 50% sale and I can pick up a month for a dollar cheaper. I don't lose by having a sub. I can add time to my account and still get in on the sale without affecting my sub cost. I'm cost averaging my sub down. That said, I don't think I've seen a 50% off sale.
---
Shit, see what you did? I did math. FUCK YOU FOR MAKING DO MATH. I SUCK AT MATH! :-)
---
&gt;If EVE was real
---
If it was just turn your providence into a carrier. It's big enough and has larger internal volume than a nidhoggur. 
---
I'm in TEST these days and I haven't been given that impression.
---
For the freedom ahhhh
---
Usually the scam buy orders are on characters without enough isk to complete the sale, so that even if you get there in time, the sale doesn't go through. 
---
Id be more interested whether there is anything that gives *less*....
---
Are we violating NIP or TEST intentionally creating friction?Neutral players know that
---
Pretty much everything gives more that Project Discovery.
---
Do what the other guy said about joining one of the newbro friendly Corps.
---
Also check this out, it’s pretty fun to look at and find some new things you might like.
---
Small note, you shouldn’t need a hauler to love your exploration stuff you get.  Maybe don’t autopilot is the reason your getting ganked in a exploration frigate in bisects?
---
It is important to find what you like and do that...  You pay for your game time so you need to enjoy doing whatever you find fun in the game.  Never let someone tell you your playing eve wrong cause you like X activity.
---
Cheers!!
---
Anything in highsec that isn't missions
---
We think that's just a possible crime. But we will respond positively.

Enjoy your time off!!!

(If you end up not being permabanned then see ya next year!!)
---
There must be war, but no one is right or wrong about it. But noble excuses, which I can't admit, are not evil pandas.
---
Current thinking among lore nerds is less of it being part of a new event, because it's hard to get to and CCP likes making event areas reasonably easy to access, but more a tease of developing Triglavian stuff.
---
If anyone who reads this before the big reveals come wants to know more, try to find footage of someone's stream. There is a very big thing in the background of these mega rooms. Try to get a closer look of it to figure out what's coming before CCP officially announces it. :)
---
Lol @all these stonk wannabes 
---
I bought it last month at 3.7m a piece thinking the price was overly low and would rise.  
---
You Falcon...  You....  /hug
---
But Naz is the only good poster goon
---
The problem is there is nothing worth fighting over except pride in kicking somebody's ass. I don't mind that but if you want a great war you need something to fight for. New space was why b-r happened. Isk faucets are available to everyone now. You don't have to have moons to make money anymore. Just go buy a rorq and mine to your hearts content. No something that gives people a reason to risk their shit is what's needed. 
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Can I have your stuff? =)
---
Hmmm. I thought on buy orders the isk was taken out of the account and held.
---
buhu. you know instat of grinding you can be omega by buying a sub. the game is much more fun if you dont have to  mind your isk all the time.
---
Thank you for that insight. 
---
&gt; Let's say for example, I can't afford to PLEX and I refuse to use $$$ to sub. You are worthless to CCP, you are not increasing revenue.
---
I get the point, but sad if true.
---
An organic player who PLEX'es and can't afford $$$ should be more important to CCP than an inorganic PLEX'ed alt just for other purposes (e.g. a multiboxed Rorqual). The game's health directly depends on how many real people is playing it.
---
You ask and you shall receive. 
---
Next time I am drunk (most likely tomorrow) I will finish part one of this epic tale. 
---
THAT DOES SUCK!!
---
Do you believe him better than your glasses?
---
LMAO!
---
THANKS I like your words very much, except that I don't like your AFK very much in our galaxy.
---
I’m not saying it invalidates your arguments... but no, not everyone runs logistics like him. He’s literally in charge of all gsf making it’s fueling, fitting options, etc. 
---
How the flying fuck is kek offensive?
---
I think the bold makes you look pretty smart too! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. :)
---
Not in a game where 15-boxed Rorquals can move under hisec level safety and never ever die.
---
Then your doing LVL 4 missions wrong or your to lazy and still in empire doing them.
---
I understand, of course, that there are such people among us. But some people regard him as the second world, and exercise their diplomatic, political, command, overall planning and other abilities. So brothers, I'm not talking about fighters like you. Of course, I want fighters to know what they are fighting for and whether it's worth fighting for.
---

more photos of the structure? :o

maybe there are more things hidden in the smoke?
---
Unfortunatly those arricles are... well uninteresting.
---
To tell the truth, it's very boring. What has goons done to Chinese players recently? Have you consulted them? Does goons violate the wishes of Chinese players?
---
As for your question, I'm answering it head-on. Which newspaper did you read it in? Is your country's mouthpiece? It's also what some non-Chinese people on the Internet say. If you don't like this country, of course you think it's evil, such as the war between FRT and TEST. If you stand on either side, you think it's right. This is your brother on the stand.
---
If you were grinding omega status with L4 missions, no one, and I mean no one, will miss you.
---
I would say 1900 news is the only thing worth reading on their page, the rest is just generic and boring.
---
Talk about saturation in the market place. GG zarvox

Tenerifis I often walk by, and I don't see any of our buildings.We have always believed that weak countries have no diplomacy, so we have been preparing to fight back in self-defence against you. Even NNN has been telling us not to create friction

Maybe you should see what dirty words they said to us.以其人之道还治其人之身
---
If you paint it grey you could probably use it to evacuate troops from the Rebel base at Hoth. 
---
I actually trained up a Tengu and already flew 2 exploration ships with WH space in mind. However, by the time I was done training the Tengu and training for the modules to fit it I was already rarely undocking and no longer logging very much.
---
That's the other thing. I can't be expected to be logged in for hours on end every day. Real life keeps me a bit busy and I wouldn't be available every day.
---
Also, I let my subscription expire this morning so I'm out.
---
Greed is one of the 7 deadly sins and The Imperium, as a chiristian organization, should always strive against it.
---
Because in my world view, it's out of respect for the people of this country.

Sounds like a teenage pubbie rant.  The game is better off without him.  He can now go back to WoW and hang out in local adding "anal" before linking an item.

Maybe I don't know about other religious organizations. What was Christianity like in the Middle Ages? It's too late. Of course, I have never heard the news you said, and there is no bad sign of the ethnic minorities in front of me, so I can't judge whether the information you said is farting or not.

Noone tell this guy Niggri is an actual last name lmao
---
This is where the margin trading skill comes into play. It reduces your down payment when you put up the order. 
---
Because this is the internal affairs of other countries. As foreigners, we should not interfere. This is respect.
---
Is your country as innocent as a little white dove?Please don't make me laugh.
---
Maybe I'm just blind, and your heart is invisible.
---
So it's just a different position. It's not bullshit that destroys NIP.
---
PLEX sales make more $$$ for CCP than paid subscriptions, so yes, CCP should definitely be worried that fewer people are spending $$$ on buying PLEX. 
---
Man it literally takes a heron with 25k isk in modules to venture in wh. Or a venture. 
---
Also, basically any cruiser hull can take you there. Just bring probes and depot. Stratios, perhaps?
---
Play how you want to play but if how you want to play is by breaking agreements when it suits your interests to do so then don't be surprised when people view you as untrustworthy
---
It's not destroying nip, it's just that you want to fight against us. In my opinion, you just lost in the Northern War. You need a victory. You can't beat goons in the west, and that's your backing, so you can only attack pandas.
---
I am in no hurry to get into capitals
---
CCP releasing content like these on test server first and players optimizing it before it even hits Tq is a retarded meta.
---
Props to CCP to release it straight to Tq.
---
What's a crime? What do you mean?
---
Get a dread, they're gonna be even more awesome now

Is PLEX the new bitcoin?
---
Don’t bother 
---
I mean, it's just TEST wishful thinking.
---
&gt; it seems that the end game seems to be little more than becoming a cog in a null sec alliance and doing nothing but "press f1".
---
This is the easiest "endgame". You can definitely do other stuff, it just takes more work/effort to play in a small corp or hunting group. 
---
that's a nice font
---
I understand that it is a probably a bad translation, but I never claimed to have a heart. I definitely do not have one for botters.
---
Too much overhead for your operation? That's the intended effect. Wild how your whole reddit history is just selling video game shit yet you don't have $15. I think you need to stop living on the internet and get a job as the entitled bit isn't going to get you far when that game wasn't free for 15 years.
---
A few years back a Gorgon Empire FC flew a brick tanked Nestor. 
---
I'm not sure we ever killed that thing.
---
I'm pretty sure I made more begging for isk
---
If you don't have a heart, then when I didn't say that.
---
*must be in a null sec Corp for all of these activities.  
---
Yeah I agree I’m sorta thinking focusing on going up the ship tree and less on going across the ship tree
---
Same with me and rorquals
---
I never autopilot; I just get ambushed at gates and stuff by insta-lockers
---
Agreed. I've yet to make a spreadsheet for this game, and graphics are always on high. Shit I play with sound as well.
---
You can exempt from your own fleet warp? Huh?
---
Ah, and now we are judging his lifestyle as well. Carry on then.
---
They totally weren't mad for nerfing carrier's pvp ability to fix isk farming.
---
Plenty of people play without spreadsheeta
---
pretty sure you can do fw not in a nullsec corp...just saying :)
---
Please, just go away and don't post ever again.
---
Noone will miss you, noone will notice your absence from our lovely game.
---
I don't think hoping that someone has gainful employment as an independent adult is "judging", but you just keep being you. Carry on indeed.
---
And you didn't post est. Value?
---
&gt; gettin OMEGA next month, but after this new ransom, no way Jose.
---
Too bad the way they get money is via subscriptions. So you're sad that your trial account can't do some missions?
---
&gt; NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE OF AAA GAMES WHICH YOU KEEP FOREVER
---
​Honestly not sure if you disagree with the price of AAA games or not. But the last time I checked many games come out with a newer one a year after, which means that in most cases the previous one is dead anyways.
---

---
You are threatening to leave with a 3 year old's piggy bank.  Plus maybe, *maybe,* a hot wheels car.
---
Also, you just noticed the plex price but you're posting here?  Do you ever read this sub?  I'm new here, but this is not new news.
---
&gt;Is it worth coming back?

Honestly?  No -- you've got a good thing going -- focus on that.  Grats!

Like what? Even high sec mining will net you more than fucking project discovery...
---
So something similar to a cluster in EVE then perhaps?

Alphas can’t do level 4 mission, this game is literally unplayable :(.

Glad that you’re leaving, this community doesn’t need people like you anyway...

Also on a side note, if you can’t afford $15 a month and it’s such a big deal for you, in that case my friend I’m pretty sure you shouldn’t be playing games and you should focus more on getting your life together, find a job, maybe finish off your education..

First I'm ever hearing of it.

because in 2016, Kek was a popular meme, from pepe.
---
and the nation of kekistan was born.  we had alot of fun with it. but because its not being used by the "progressive democrats",  pepe ended up being declare a "hate symbol" by the totally-not-bought-out-and-biased-southern poverty law center (declare anyone you want an extremist for $50).
---
so now kek is seen as "offensive" by these "progressives"  (along with everything else that thye choose to use to act like victims.   subscribe ot pewdiepie)
---
seriously....its idiotic.  but when you have a bunch of people looking for stuff to be offended by....they pick anything.

still, heres a fun video for Kekistan =)

I feel that there is something wrong with the translation and I can't understand you. I'm defending FRT, not HK Alliance. They are third parties and have attacked FRT, so the attack on test is not what we did.

I wouldn't be opposed to inties losing nullified if shuttles got insta align and nullified.

Organized players use whatever the game gives them to use. Suppose 100 players were able to "teleport" a tackled friendly rorqual to home keepstar, thus saving them. Wouldn't that be op? The point is, just because 100 people come together to save a friend, it doesn't necessarily mean that the means they use to save their friend are not op.
---
This guy gets it.
---
First of all I'm not fighting you, I'm not in test. I'm just an interested onlooker
---
Test has been losing wars for years, they've been evicted just about every time they've tried to take space. They're not shy about fighting losing battles, I don't think test leadership 'needs a win', I think they don't trust frt because they've shown themselves to be untrustworthy
---
Frt has literally been involved in wars where the goal was to evict test from their space, test has never tried to evict frt. If test wanted frt gone they wouldn't have signed a nip, they would have just evicted you after the North started collapsing and frt was left to fight alone in the South
---
But more than that frt has continuously shown that they're willing to break their agreements. There's going to be tension between test and frt for a long time while frt repairs their reputation
---
Nope, corpse collection is still a pointless activity. Everyone has suggested they be used for something like Implants, but I don't think there's ever been an official comment in that direction.

My co-pilot (introduced here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9kn841/one_of_my_copilots_cpt_prettypants/ ) is at the vet, my wife noticed some blood in his urine while I am working nights tonight and had to take him to the vet.    
---
Waiting to hear what the diagnosis is :(
---
People have fought for no reason other than pride and hate for all of eve's history. Some of the biggest wars in eve history are mostly about "fuck those guys".
---
The problem is this: take a cruiser gang to delve and get bosoned. Do you feel like ever doing that again? No. Most fights have stunningly unequal results. Even when you aren't getting buttfucked by a titan, there are a lot of 100-0 scores in eve these days. That wasn't always the case.
---
It turns out people are more ok with losing fights if they have something to feel good about. The entire early history of goonfleet is about losing a whole fleet of frigates and cruisers, but killing some expensive HACs and claiming it was a win.
---
There are lessons people all over the world that can be learned by other countries affairs 
---
For instance, you mentioned the refugee situation in Europe. European countries are putting real solutions to the test, other countries can see what works and what doesn't work

I think the disrespectful thing is to suppress that knowledge and the sacrifices of the people involved, not to talk about and learn from those events
---
CCP never spoke about it, players did

That's the only way I'd support removing nullification on the last four.

Frt may not have attacked directly, but they helped an attacker anchor structures

I can't drop those rorquals. Just supers.
---
Stealing is something else. It creates a risk factor. But it becomes worth your time only after you invest 200 b into it (and less and less by excavators prices dropping)
---
If 200b per person is the entry level to pose some risk factor to a rorqual 15boxer, then they are still as safe as hisec.
---
Serpentis loot? Prob like 90 mil total for all the sites. 
---
I agree with this. Also, CCP might not give a crap about alphas that simply intend to play as alphas forever. But for those alphas that earn enough isk and buy plex that goes into CCPs pocket just like paying real $$$ to CCP. In fact more so because CCP actually earns more per month from players who purchase their omega status in game than they do from players that simply pay the cash directly. Paying a year at a time you can get monthly cost as low as $10.95/month. But a standard 30 day subscription is $14.95, worth in effect 500 plex at a cost of 2.99 cents a plex. For the plex purchased for in game trading it cost $39.99 per 1100 plex, or 3.64 cents per plex. 2.99*x = 3.64. That's at worst nearly a 22% gain in revenue for CCP when people purchase their plex in game with isk rather than purchase it directly from CCP with $$$. And an even higher markup if subscribers go for the 3, 6, or 12 month option.
---
If CCP is really undermining alphas seeking to earn their omega status in game they are cutting their own throats in straight up $$$ revenue. And cutting it again when omega players drop out because they are that much more bereft of in game targets for their own enjoyment. Alpha players are like the runners in a game of Hard Target. And a game of Hard Target needs runners or the game is moot.
---
ur friends full of shit
---
honestly what did people expect was going to happen, the value of ISK is dropping every month. you have 10-20% inflation of ISK *monthly* because of how easy it is to make ISK now.
---
PLEX is catching up to the fucked economy, CCP and CSM still have no full plan to fix it (HAW nerf and carrier nerf will slightly reduce the issue, but insurance faucet for the huge amount of minerals being mined is not being addressed)
---
wow only one mod was online for a week??? 
---
&gt; PLEX or ISK is not a real world currency and you can't really apply real world economics to it.
---
This is where we disagree.  Economics doesn't magically stop working when humans are behind keyboards.  Humans are human.
---
&gt; More likely is that you want to buy a capital, so you buy enough PLEX to turn into the ISK for it - and in that case, the higher the value of PLEX the less you need to buy.
---
You do realize that people will inject and buy a carrier more often when they can do that with less real hours worked right?  This is common sense to me.  More people will inject carrier pilots when it costs less.  You can pretty much get a fully fit carrier for $20 US right now.  Not long ago, that would be close to $30.  Are more people or less people buying carriers at $20 compared to $30?
---
Outdated? Sure. The flashy UIs and excessive buttonsost other MMOs have are trash. Give me an outdated, perfectly functional UI over that crap, any day.
---
as someone who has about that much plex... you just hold it, since it's the easiest way to fight the horrible ISK inflation without effort. you can make billions a day without doing anything!

EVE needs risk again. PANIC should increase drone damage by all affected ships for a percentage, and increase resists by say 70%. That way you still become a formidable fighting force, but there's still PVP to be had (the mining ships can fight back and tank more, but there's actual gameplay to be had rather than just sitting jerking off waiting for the cyno)
---

---
You're right. Deimos too. The problem I ran into while using it is that blaster deimos just lacks the range and tracking when compared with other ships I use. And if I fit it for more tracking / range then its too fucked in other areas. The rail Deimos just lacks DPS for me so badly that I stopped flying it altogether.

They have the data in some sort of database(s) but they can't properly parse/sort it into meaningful information? Not sure I follow

That's pretty nice, so this particular spawn may be more about survival and GTFO then actually killing them. I'm pretty sure they can make some other gate trigger stuff too then just killing NPCs.

You're right, I'm sure there are people who take care of the logistics needs by themselves, get the materials themselves, without a large team to delegate it too, without hundreds of people to tax and get donations from.

His admirable qualities started with his opening statement "who cares. "
---
Obviously fw players care about the state of fw. and obviously I care having brought up ideas to the csm before the meeting and finally hearing sweet words "I will bring it up at the next csm meeting" then searching for it in the minutes only to see it was pushed aside for more nullsec love.
---
Don't get me wrong there was stuff in the minutes I loved, but the fact that lowsec and fw are low low in numbers is something that needs to be addressed and solved and "who cares" is why it hasn't. 
---
Truthfully if you need convincing to come back you don't really want to come back. I play eve for the social aspect. I hang out with the people on comms do my little share of fleets and rat. That's it. If the wife wants to do something I do it. Don't try to get people to convince you of something do what you enjoy. If its hanging out playing eve with a bunch of nerds do that if not oh well.

I would stick to requesting a gate to your shit region at this point you are becoming another Gevlon.

Wow I really love that idea, surprised I haven't seen it before. Still buys time for the rorq but can still be killed against a great enough force

No one mentioned triglavian HAC

Because capital faction guns require t2 cpa guns to build.

This has and always has been a problem. It was a problem in PoS sov and it was a problem in Dominion. You can’t ever really make Sov ‘fun’ enough to fight over, as alliances have a vested interest in making you not want to do it.
---
should be for life since that's the policy these days...

Wow butthurt thy name is ta1648878... Keep trying
---
Hella sci-fi. I love it.
---
Not really, no. It’s my perception that Sov is mostly an afterthought in invasions with the obvious exception of Cyno jammers, with the major battles being fought over structures. I don’t think that’s the worst state that Sov could be in either, it means we get the objective driven centralised fights most line members want.
---
&gt;Fun times and I am glad CSM members recognize how 'fun' those are.
---
I have taken Sov multiple times over the past year, and used it to generate fights on my alt alliance (which will remain unnamed). At the highest, strategic level, it’s not a massively emphasised system as fighting tends to centralise around power projection points in EVE - which citadels have taken over the role of now.

Never heard of them. I'm there because Im bored

Get well soon, Cpt!

Hey BB
---
Finding a group is certainly a challenge in EVE. I actually only had one convo outside of my NPC corp. That as with a CODE pilot who blew up my pod. I didn't lose a ship, just the pod. I was actually moving my stuff to another system at the time. I had to laugh about it since it actually got me to my destination faster.
---
Other than that, EVE is a game where you can trust no-one. That makes it hard to meet people.Had a few in game emails but that wasn't very rewarding.
---
I gave up on that after a while.
---
I have a Stratios, Astros and can fly a Tengu. I did go int wormhole space a couple of times. 
---
the idea was to be useful if I joined a group. I should at least be able to defend something.
---
No point in it now though. I stopped logging in and now I'm unsubbed. I just commented on the post since it seemed people were under the impression that new people all (or most) want to fly capital ships. I didn't agree with that.
---
Kmart.
---
OR
---
CCP is trying wean us off the incessant PLEX sales of last year so that they're rare and people don't constantly wait for sales to get their isk
---
Better than the 0 ISK it used to be when your station got blown up.
---
Nah, just remove insurance entirely. I mean, srsly. Imagine you d be running an insurance-company in the EVE-universe. Would you give a guy an insurance who is known to have lost hundreds or thousands of ships? I wouldnt, at least not without a mark-up to make it worth my day :D
---
&gt; If the highest buy order and lowest sell order were created less than a minute apart, it is suspicious.
---
On that note, slightly crafty scammers might use orders of different lengths (say, three months vs seven days) to try to obscure this a bit.
---
sound like a panic buy up maybe by gscsm
---
I really liked the lack of local in WH to be honest. However, I don't find ganking to be very fun. A war sounds interesting, but ganking for the sake of ganking just seems unappealing. I know EVE players love it but it's not my thing. A successful ambush of a foe is a different thing altogether. That's fine. I prefer intel gathering tbh.
---
I'm now unsubbed so it really makes little difference at this point. I was just commenting on the OP that I didn't think the idea that new players are flocking to get into capital ships was entirely true. Not everybody joins for that.
---
You are the worst type of person, looking for things to be offended about, probably not on your own behalf.
---
The saddest thing about this post is that it's obvious bait, and this person isn't actually going to leave the game
---
It is not being addressed. The changes are kinda PR thing to say "o look we're doing it", they're a drop in an ocean. They needed to bring them in proportions down to much lower then T2 and T3 ships since those actually require materials other then minerals to produce. What is being done is just a bullshit token gesture.
---
Weeeee weeeee weeeeeeeee i want everything for freee!!!!! Give me everything for freeeeeee!!!! Im a special entitled snowflaaaaakeeee!!!!! Weeeeeee weeeeeee!!!
---
Literally hundreds of corps are constantly in 24/7 deathmatch over recruits, they just don't know you exist, so they aren't reaching out to you. 
---
You sometimes need to take initiative on your own to get in touch with people, though, since very few good corps recruit like email spammers (it's a bad look and an easy way to get spies). Try posting once in the recruitment channel with some general info on who you are &amp; what you think you wanna do in Eve, you'll get like 5-10 convos. Hell, this reddit post might get you 5 recruit offers. 
---
The other thing you can do is look at what you actually do in Eve and look for corps that do similar stuff. For example, I like blopsing. If I were on my own, I'd go blops in a region, and eventually meet other people blopsing there and end up joining their corp so we could blops together. 
---
&gt; Citadel farming is the best isk in the game
---
No it's incredibly slow, like 20 minutes per site, then 5 minutes per drifter. Maybe 20 minutes total if you use like 4 accounts. 
---
I love ccp now. 
---
You can get more than that on Project Discovery 1mill+ 5 minute ticks are pretty easy to do so that's 12+ mill an hour and I've gone over 2 mill for a 5 minute tick too.
---
15-18 mill an hour is very achievable but exploration and abyssal sites make much more than that as an alpha. An alpha Gila can do t3 Abyssal sites fairly easily and make 10x as much as doing Project Discovery.
---
You cannot sentence someone after the fact.  I think its called Ex post facto laws, but don't quote me on that.

Change PANIC to "boosts all affected ships' resists by 50% and converts mining lasers to ship-scrapping lasers with dps equal to 1500% of their mining yield per second"

---
PLEX is basically bitcoin atm esp since many alliances/people are hoarding for various reasons. eventually someone drops a load on the market for w/e reason. people then start panic selling and itll normalize to like 3.5-4mil per
---
First, welcome to like a week ago. and 2nd that isn't an announcement its a hint. We may or may not be getting something like that or it might be otherwise part of some event.
---
&gt;First a high plex price makes your plex even more valuable, if you buy plex with real money and sell it for is your happy right now.
---
not relevant to what i said.
---
in order for the price to go up, supply needs to go down (less people putting $$ in the game) OR demand needs to go up (fewer people playing, or fewer people willing to spend $$$ and only paying with ISK)
---
You don't need to wardec for lowsec (you get suspect status, but no concordoken). High sec, yes, you would need an existing structure to wardec the owner of the poco you want to take over. 
---
It’s all serpentis, the loot will be terrible and 2/3rds of those sites had probably been cherrypicked already.

Mate T2 guns do more damage with T2 ammo. With faction ammo though faction guns do more damage than T2 guns using faction ammo. Spend ten minutes in pyfer it will confirm this.  
---
That's true about goonfleet. The problem is back in those days people had something to fight over. Remember BOB? Yeah fuck those guys...an enemy/villan to defeat because they were being dicks to everyone and people hated them. B-R? New space opened up...quick let's go claim it even if all our titans die! Nowadays? Capital proliferation and super umbrellas. Yeah people are protecting their krabbing space. Beyond that there is nothing to fight for. People have no cause to rally behind and want that space for themselves because it's just easier to join up and krab. The question is really how are we going to make eve great again? What is their to fight for?
---
I think step 1 would be you asking yourself: What advantage would an astrahus give me over a station?
---
If you can come up with a legit reason, and you dont piss off the locals, you'd probably be fine. Especially if you dont contest a moon.
---
Made a good decision buying plex for all my isk when I quit
---
I believe you are referring to [this](https://www.eveonline.com/article/introducing-the-upwell-organic-mass-granulator). Something I wish we could one day see if for no other reason then it would allow me to justify my corps collecting to decent company.
---
Oh I did a couple of times but I was trying for smaller groups that seemed to be more of what I was looking for instead of first come first serve. At the time I had too few SPs for what they needed and twice there was a language barrier. In each of those cases I appreciated their honesty in their recruiting practices. I would rather not get in than become a burden.
---
The main thing is I absolutely do not want to join a big alliance. I don't think very highly of null sec corps as it is so WH space seemed more appropriate. I just wasn't in a good place to be a good member at that time. However, by the time I had the training needed I no longer cared all that much.
---
There's a list in your account tab on the eve site. It's on the recruit a friend page.

Well, logistics as far as supply running is very fun. Running a gate came in a blockade runner is petty sweet. I just didn't have a reason to do that more than a few times.
---
I goofed around in low sec a little  :)
---
Small to medium groups were destroyed more by Jump Fatigue and Boost changes than people mining to plex accounts.  
---
It was the replacement of good game mechanics with one sided ones that kicked off the problem.
---
Maybe CCP figured we would all join large groups who would have more huge battles to put in the news and get them more customers. In reality small fw corps couldn't move new corp members to home systems or redeploy without wasting days on timers. Not fun at all. Who ever let that dev implement jump fatigue when he was leaving the day after the changes/patch is a fucking retard.
---
So large groups built more capitals, spread them out and trained up more accounts to circumvent Jump Fatigue. Small groups could not afford to do that because they generally played eve for fun and not to watch a number for imaginary money go up in their wallet. 
---
Also - CCP were told repeatedly that removing off grid boosts would mean only large groups with spare pilots would have access to boosts due to them needing to be flown in the battle. 
---
Try flying a boost ship and an Alphabill or similar effectively at the same time. It is easy in an f1 monkey style of ship (faction bs/capital) because you can be a dopey slow prick and still keep up with what is happening in those fights. 
---
The lack of having to think already makes it easier for large groups just following orders. Small gangs have to have all pilots thinking 100% of the time.
---
My corp lost it's place in eve - CCP removed the niches until there was no niche left to fill so most unsubbed. 
---
If plex is too expensive - don't buy them. Then demand will drop and so will the price. Eve has much bigger problems than plex prices.
---
Not saying this next part to be a dick - But unsubbing from Eve and doing more productive things with my time is the best move I ever made. 
---
Everyone here should try it for a month. Don't just swap to another game. Do something useful with your time and you will never waste another cent on this once great game.

Good luck out there Zarvox! :)

idk. From when I posted I went go eat some dank food &amp; logged in one of my 30 farms to run 25 sites and just finished hauling https://imgur.com/a/PWdUF1u. Time to go play apex and inflate plex price.
---
As I said earlier in the thread I have let my subscription expire (ended this morning) so I won't be doing anything in EVE. I just noticed this post when I logged in and I commented that I don't agree with the idea that capital ships are necessarily a new player's goal. It was never one of mine nor was I ever interested in capital ship fleets. So yeah. I won't be looking to join anything.
---
This sounds like reflection to me.  I think I'm actually quite likable.  I don't expect any roles soon.
---
If this isn't a bug doesn't it defeat the entire rationale for these sites?
---
So true. The game lacks horizons to reach for. 
---
The current wars actually seem like arranged events than any kind of war. They seem like the CEOs get worried that the line members will start shooting too many blues out of boredom so they put wars together periodically. At least to an outsider they look that way. 
---
To be fair though honestly the archon makes more sense as a holler since most of its hull is open deck. It would be really funny if CCP for April's fool joke turn all archons into freighters and I'll providence's into carriers.

Its called HACmack good sir, and if you look closely at 1:22 you'll see a Damavik with 2-3 disintergraters on it too.

Yes its a nice screenshot. But if you look closely at the background nebula, you can see that its really low-res. All background nebula are in dire need of a resolution bump to get them into the 4K-age. Some years back there was talk about a "high-res-background-texture-pack" to sepeately download, but it never got released. Please CCP!

Wow how amazing 14b in blueloot idk how I can ever compete gee wizz that's pretty amazing

30 sites at 10 minutes a site is 5 hours, not including warping. 10 minutes a site is 2 dreads, or 3 in a c6. Add on 5 minutes per drifter and you're already up to 7.5 of site running so like 2b an hour
---
2b an hour isn't bad, but that's 10 minute sites; are you doing that with subs? Cause that's a lot of subs, and speaking from experience, fucking aids. 
---

Did the last mirror mess up SiSi? I and someone else I've checked through local can't redeem items from Eden store. After buying something with what Plex I had,  I checked the redeem items folder and it was empty. Re-opening Eden store, and Plex shows to be 0. Even though checking inventory shows the original amount of Plex I had.

Very true. Space needs to be juicy and worth it
---
I am not sure if that would help. I play on 1080p and i don’t think that reddit did compress it much.
---
I will have a look at it later to see if there is any difference between the original file and this one.
---
I mean, there's no shortage of people who think "fuck those guys" about goons. just look around.
---
&gt; Capital proliferation and super umbrellas.
---
Yup. The thing is, caps and supers could take massive nerfs and people would still use them. A carrier or dread should be in line with the same progression of cruiser - BC - BS, where 10x the cost gets you way less than 10x the stats. Caps are actually cost efficient, a carrier has more than 10 times the EHP of a battleship. They should have like 500k - 750k ehp not 2 million.
---
My mans eve is full of intresting things get out of nullsec entities like that join a small alliance out there go into wormholes lowsec you name it go out and see the rest of it before you dip
---
I am confused about some things as well. The mirror affected my account on SiSi side to copy my Tranquility character. But I've been on SiSi for a while now. It shouldn't have mirrored. In doing so it removed quite a bit. This might be what removed your bookmarks/overview settings. You might have to re-add them.
---
To add to this, you can also clear the isk you pay into escrow by making other buy orders and filling them with an alt (or even sell to your own buy order).
---
That way you don't have to have any isk tied up in the scam while you wait.
---
I don’t get it
---
I think you can just leave that room. 
---
Should have trained into a Gila, if you want to PVE an alpha Gila can make a lot more ISK doing Abyssal sites sites than you'll ever get doing L4 missions.
---
Who cares?
---
For parties at my house, I’ll set my Providence to autopilot between a few gank safe(ish) systems, set the cam to a nice cinematic offset, and leave it up on my screens with good music in the background.  It’s fun to catch people later in the night gathered around talking while watching this beautiful ship fly around. 
---
1&amp;2 yeah, farmers and caps ruined FW space, this much is known.
---
3.,NO!  Missiles are the only things Caldari have that are worth a damn.  The Caracal Navy blows dick and the Navy Osprey is marginal, we have to get ISK for our LP for something.

Cheap, fast and versatile; the dualprop nano-brawl style is unique and really good for solo roaming. It lets you BRAWL LIKE A MAN without completely sacrificing range control or ability to disengage, compared to traditional brawling ships. This lets you choose &amp; control your fights without making you play like a massive coward.

Same. Looks even more like that with the Purity of the Throne SKIN on it

Nope, solely by doing it right you can have 20 mil isk ticks and then you can also include rewards like marshal for 3b, it was better (8b) but still ok

Trade it for AT ships after CCP confirms they're uncancelling the AT

Unless you run your own null alliance there's no way or reason to translate that much isk into tangible goods like ships &amp; modules.

So yeah, i shit on botters. I hate it. They dock to fast. Not much killmails.

I read an article a long time ago about people that were professional streamers. In some cases it is *a lot* of work and IMO underappreciated. Some people were streaming 16 hours a day, swollen feet, other health issues etc. Not quite the case here but this is a full time job just as anything else and as such can get boring/stressful/too much etc. Like acting, professional sports, politics, other things, you're usually a bottom-feeding grub until you become a multimillionaire, with less in-between than other professions.
---
This game seriously is so beautiful! I want a freighter!
---
Your budget is 250m but I'll contract the same ship and fit to you so you can fly what you can afford to lose.
---
If they didnt play with vpn
---
Snowballs and fireworks
---
And high class wormhole ratting wins the day, thanks citadels!
---
Nothing to do with shitadels. If you're Astra drifter farming you're doing it because you can't do dreads. Isk/hr from an optimal dread setup in a 6 can be upwards of 6b, but the risk is significantly higher than anywhere else
---
Looks more like a structure to me
---
that's purdy. I'm guessing they are moving into deadspace after losing their original space, building new stations?
---
Thanks for the pics!
---
Check your overview settings and make sure customs offices are enabled on the appropriate presets/brackets.
---
But you can do both at the same time.

This is all completely unrelated to the question as far as I understand. SiSi does indeed completely mirror tranquillity every once in a while, resetting  things to where you are in tq.
---
Don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you as you exit stage left.

This is what I posted about a bit ago btw- it’s definitely a ship, I’d assume a dread, it’s got boosters and hardpoints, and it’s the banner image for the EVE world tour events :)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aydrl9/sisi_triglavian_capital_ship_under_construction/
---
You are wrong. https://i.imgur.com/8rAOeQC.png
---
The skill gives 2% to the T2 gun, not the ammo
---
&gt;2% bonus per skill level to the damage of large turrets requiring Large Artillery Specialization.
---
Haha the unnamed alliance is so good. Better keep it unnamed so people believe in your generated content.
---
They presented it live at GDC, that´s probably the reason for the timeslot
---
Out of all the pictures ive seen of this site, these are currently the best. 
---
Props to you for clearing the site and showing us this.
---
Also i would contact the ARC and share your experience, you might get into one of their vids.
---
In C5s you get sub 17-18m sites with 3 nestors and an eos, all property fit. 2m drifters if you use a fort. Haven't tested 2 dreads in earnest. The isk/hr is staggering considering the other pve options. Yes, it's four accounts but any self respecting wormholer has at least two. Two more subs can eventually equal up to a considerable cap force as needed by your respective Corp/alliance.
---
You are where I am in terms of the impact, good post
---
So like I said, faction turret has a 4.5% higher base modifier, T2 spec skills gives 2% per level which applies to the T2 gun but not the faction gun so, at spec skill III and above, T2 does more damage. With any ammo.
---
That is insane.
---
Strange, I never had problems in my old Hellcat times
---
Long term, no, both will probably keep rising unless you lay off the eggs. Short term, PLEX will drop quite a bit within the next month. What's happening right now is pretty heavy market manipulation.
---
Poland is fine overall, think serbia, FYROM, romania, bulgaria, south americas etc. Russia will be fine, they got regional pricing
---
Happened to me today, oddly. As well as my alts.
---
I did this to make a huge profit. I'm cashing out.
---
Ofc c6s are much better. I only snarkily brought up citadels as a partial reason for making the consistent farming of jspace 100x easier than previous systems of hole occupation.
---
Well, I often battles Gilas in 1v1, and attacking Navy Vespas was simply a waste of time because of their extreme HP and therefor Shieldreg increase. So this is a welcome change. Maybe now you will actually be able to kill enemy drones
---
So 4 ships for 18 minutes, 2 minutes with a fort (who uses a fort? Use an astra, or use a dread..?) so 20 minutes, you're looking at 3 sites an hour, so 1.5b an hour
---
That's ignoring time waiting for drifters to get on astra grid, ignoring the times you're roached by someones phoenix appearing, etc. 
---
2 dreads is 10 minutes for a site, with drifter; double the isk, and you can't lose your drifters to others. 
---
Night night SJW's, you just got Falconed!
---
dear Bob, i do hope the event will be Triglavian capitals attacking  Citadels in the whole Galaxy.

in 2012 i definitely recall him fcing regular-ship fleets, although before the fountain war he was mostly a skirmish/home defense fc iirc
---
I would rather be able to fly difter ships then new caps I probably not be able to fly.

I use what I have in system, sometimes it's my fort, other times it's my astra's. I'm not logging out cap alts in space like in the olden days.

For the chat box you can easily place your webcame over it. However I dont hide anything while streaming. If you are doing PVP it actualy helps people to come and fight you.

No, nobody willingly interacts with the sov system. The most common interaction by far is cloaky camping the sov for several weeks so it’s less aids to take it. Other than that sov is only a war objective if you need to disable the possibility to cynojam (often less cancer now by just reinforcing the jammers themselves) or if you want to put up an offensive citadel with a short anchoring delay. Nobody does wars over sov timers, you gain sov by demoralising your ennemy so hard that he stops loging in and defending it and even then the amount of manhours it takes to grind completely uncontested sov is completely insane. When you see regions orange on dotlan it’s mostly either grinding after victory or worthless reinforcing of adm one systems that nobody cares about and that won’t get any follow up.

After like 100 jumps through 00 one pilot fall asleep on a gate we warped him of to a safe .... one day later he came back still in his ship.... i thought man this is luck! But than several days later we went to a HED-GB .... our scimitar pilot had one or two drinks more than he should have had for his position inside my gang! After some fights arround Keberez-gate we were holding the gate chilled there and looted field. And our scimitar pro pilot fell asleep (it was not the same pilot but still ...i was thinking wtf!) ... we warped him of to a safe...
---
Next day while we were rally up to go out again .... he jumped onto comms telling us ... he just came back inside his ship...and he is up to join! .... now i really knew what luck is!
---
If u post this here, deep inside u want to come back. So, stop lying to yourself and welcome back. Just keep strong connection to ur RL.
---
Sorry, but Project Discovery doesn't load properly fast enough to get 20 mil ticks and still maintain accuracy. But I'm seeing that Fraternity tag so assuming your script was better than me doing it manually.
---
I have two suggestions for you
---
1. Stop flying capitals you fucking mongrel
---
2. Put smart bombs on all your high slots
---
Wuz my very point. I guess I misunderstood the intention of your comment about 'who uses a fort to kill drifters' like it was so uncommon.
---
Fucking lold so hard I almost shit out my nose
---
Its ammo for the 720mm artillery
---
It lowers shield resistances!
---
It *is* uncommon.
---
Either you have a fort, thus dreads, or your bear hole is just subs and astras. 
---
Unless you live in a pvp corps home, and just do home sites...?
---
Shoots wrong target with dread, doesn't have point refit, fleet doesn't bubble nids while they are off the triage so most warp. lel I love watching goons pvp. I think you guys better recruit a couple thousand more people just to be sure you don't lose the next war

---
Torn between upvoting so more ppl can laugh and downvoting it because its shit
---
And goons lost +-80% of t3 fleet so looks like SibSqd do really not bad work in this fight.
---
Lol, there are less swarms, because you lobbied CCP to remove nullification from combat ceptors. You want more risk for PvP? Sure, because this reduces risk for you friends’ PvE! I love politicians like you twisting the facts into lies.
---
But he said "**invuanic module",** not a word abour PANIC O.o
---
#LOUD NOISES
---
Hah, naw. I suppose my observational experience has differed from yours. In most c5 farmholes I run across there's a fort. Albeit proportionally less than the number of astra's in that same system, but I don't think the option being available is anything to scoff at like it's such a rare occurrence.
---
I was just adding my own thoughts and some granular details about a listed pve option to those interested.
---
Yeah if you're trying to build a narrative then Im all for that. That is what separates eve from others in that there is something for me to lose. And yeah the sinophobic players are something else. They used to blame Russians before Chinese. After t they will probably blame someone else.

And while they were doing this, their pets in Pure Blind got evicted

Sick of your shit. Why would you name him pretty pants?  
---
Apologize.
---
I don't know why but this post made me think about the Tulip mania in the Netherlands in 1636-1637
---
Sure, but if there's a fort there's dreads. You don't anchor 12b to save 2 minutes on killing a drifter. 
---
I'm not sure if you use "waifu" correctly there...
---
not bad
---
Nice one, that one looks really sweet. My personal favourite (despite being a PvP pilot) is still one I took around 1.5 years ago when a friend of mine and me were out mining with a hand full of barges and an orca (yes, an orca in null, it was the last time ever I mined in that thing I think) that looks really beautiful and reminds me of the times when we were both playing this beautiful game (he doesn't anymore due to time problems)
---
That looked very poorly handled.
---
The failure of CCP to execute on having rights to the WoD franchise, while a whole generation went lala over True Blood and Twilight must still be their biggest failure. And the one who convinced investors that CCP could never branch out.
---
Shut the fuck up you stupid weeb cunt
---
 It's very hard to make out what it is maybe because of the background.It looks more like a broken ship building yard to me
---
Lol, it used to load in less than 0.5 second. So max clicking for 0.5 seconds and there it was - next page. Now it's shitty. I maintained real (it said 99%) accuracy at probably 90%+ while having 20 mil ticks (Not the actual ticks - I'm multiplying by 4 the 5 minute tick so its 20 mins and easier to understand) More realistically if you're not as good as I am - 15 mil ticks not countong bpcs. Skill U, in rl
---
It's there already and it's called Dramiel, tyvm.

I refuse to think be's new. Who splits modules like that to save on heat?

Oh absolutely, given Australia is clearly an American state and how I'm a fan of universal health care and the descendant of immigrants. But sure, whatever floats your boat mate 
---
 0 hours because I don't play anymore
---
We all know CCP like to give NPC ships different weapon loadout comparing with capsuleer version
---
We have NPC Ravens/Scorpion/Barghest using railguns, Tempest with 8 turrets, and etc
---
Ah, finally the crux of your argument.
---
Baited on a moot point.
---
Lol what the fuck! What type of logical conclusion is that?
---
I literally compared the inhumane treatment of someone with a mental illness  to that of someone who would have experienced similar inequalities in a earlier generation.
---
Because both, historically, have recieved unfair attention. 
---
You're conclusion...idk. **You either seriously lack intelligenc**,  or are to quick to parrot the words of those you follow

Weird flex but ok

you are so very wrong. New players who own 1 account and want to upgrade from alpha to omega will have a hard time doing so with these plex prices. So it will affect dragging new players into the game. And this will affect you to.

That depends entirely on your isk source. For a single VNI ratting, sure. But how about a super ratting, which has an alt sitting in hisec skill farming - that's easily less than 5hrs. Hell even a VNI with a +3 skill farmer breaks even before 5 hrs.

IMO the Providence is the most beautiful ship in the game

Shuttles would need a mega buff to their EHP since they have no slots and would die to a sneeze. 
---
Or you fix how smartbombing/bosoning works such that it's more intuitive (you can't be hit whilst in warp, but you can be hit before you jump) which I know has been suggested by CCP Larrikin before at a roundtable.
---
1. Give people the ability to play for free as alpha's
---
2. Vastly increase what alpha's can fly

3. Slightly tone down what they can do.

Does your region have lowsec systems? If so, all your anoms moved there and nobody bothers to farm them in low.
---
&gt;Nobody does wars over sov timers, you gain sov by demoralising your ennemy so hard that he stops loging in and defending it
---
I do love seeing the same things repeat over time. This is a pretty fundamental rule of EVE warfare and no matter what system we go to, I suspect this will be a fundamental rule unless EVE becomes a casualised game.
---
Why not both? 🤔
---
Youll be able to see a full archon by all the containers on its deck
---
I don't think Drifter ships use pods or anything similiar, aren't they "piloted" by the Drifter from some AI Complex somewhere else?
---
Straight DPS race. Outranging them is barely possible even with max kite frigates or cruisers. 
---
Had my three frigs inside and just focused on renewing or starving Leshaks first because they come pre-damaged as usual but rep up insanely fast due to remote reps of &gt;10 BS on the field.
---
This plus high-transversal piloting fuelled by sick 90s tuned made it easy and took me 10-15 minutes. 
---
Yup. That's about 20k $ worth of PLEX. And some entities should have 20/30 times more of that ISK value at their disposal. Imagine they bought off all the PLEX in the market. How long would it take for people to buy 500k$ worth PLEX from CCP to replenish the market? 
---
PLEX market is basically at the mercy of a few people, who are able to making more ISK with their ISK manipulating the market. IRL markets have precautions and regulations against this kind of stuff. Eve markets don't.
---
Can I just say, congratulations on having the first market related post on this subreddit this week that wasn't something retarded about PLEX prices?
---
Oh and sorry you got scammed btw.
---
Sounds like a skirmish FC - the 36 hour part sounds like a bomber POS/TCU bash (though they've said it's not Lyris Nairn) or Domi undock camp kind of FC.
---
Equally he could just be one of the dozen or so hanger-ons that used to sit in command in every fleet whilst adding nothing to the proceedings.
---
The people who hold the high volumes are also smart enough to not dump those on the market and crash prices though. Not going to happen
---
That is exactly what im trying to imply here. So how do we protect players who plex against very influential market traders. Plex market should be regulated. This affect everyone except the traders. And if you pay for your account and think it does not affect you, well it is. New players who want to get in the game will not plex their accounts and leave the game because it very very hard to make 2.2 bil / month as an alpha account and little experience. 
---
i fear its not a bubble. also dont ever sell plex in spring if you dont have to ;) toward summer less people play so plex goes up, then possibly in october goes down.
---
i mean it can go either way but i would stick to it. had friend who left and turned everything to plex at 950. then it went to 1300 when he returned but he still stayed in it. if you dont need the isk, dont sell your plex if you dont have to
---
Adding on to what has been said, your biggest risk is when the structure is anchoring. During this time it is  completely defenseless and is easy to kill, so why not. Once anchored it is a lot more effort than it is really worth for most people (but hey, some people get bored and will shoot your structures for lolz).
---
But have you ever flown a Gila in an isolation tank while high on DMT?
---
o7
---
No, I'm not, but don't let that stop you putting words in my mouth because you don't like others disagreeing with you.
---
The point was the whole "just buy it it's better isk per hour" is only true for those in a privileged position, and it's quite reasonable for a lot of people to use isk.
---
So it’s supposed to be great that game mechanics literally force people out of the game ?
---
If fewer people are playing the demand drops. This is because there are less accounts consuming PLEX with ISK.
---
The reason why price is rising is because more accounts are consuming PLEX in addition to less consumers selling PLEX, which creates a squeeze because one currency is predictably injected and consumed, but not removed (ISK is ratted, but when exchanged for PLEX is not removed from the economy)
---
On the other hand, PLEX is removed from the economy when consumed, meaning it does exit circulation. This leads to an imbalance between both currencies.
---
The rise is from the massive amount of farms and super/rorq alts, which output minerals/ISK and consume PLEX.
---
Plex hunting ....
---
Seeing this there is some frustration building up inside me.
---
I go roaming some uninhabitated 0.0 constellations for 3 hours and find nothing, neither data nor relic sites.
---
I go roaming some wh chains for 3 hours and find nothing but sleeper sites which i cannot do in a frigate.
---
You can't he was banned. 
---
Awesome video 
---
If you care to open pinned up topic about PLEX you will know who put this sell order for 2.7t in plex. 
---
And what is it going to show me about using entosis mechanics for good content? You are parading around like you’ve demonstrated somehow that entosis warfare is great gameplay but you won’t tell us these secret alt alliances lol. because all you do is feeding trash into renters over adm 1 systems for a couple of weeks before you get rolled over. And yes you can have content over entosis just like everything in eve provided you’re ready to waste countless amounts of hours on it, the problem with entosis mechanics is that it will be eventually more effective to cheese it than to fight over it, for both parties. And that’s because the design has been failed.
---
Hey, when you go ratting the NPCs in game are also targets, that doesn't mean they make the game feel alive. Double this that at least an NPC shoots back at you, and AFK VNI doesn't, it just kinda sits there til it dies. Talk about making the game feeling dead ... Its a sad fucking day when rats in anoms give more actions then the supposed players.
---
1) Plex is a privilege. It is not an entitlement. An alpha should not be expected to PLEX with their current means. If they do, good, but the market should not cater to them.
---
2) You don’t protect the market. At most you can implement a PLEX lock after purchase, but regulating the pricing goes against the principles of a capitalistic free market.
---
3) You gut the amount of ISK entering the market. This brings on a time of scarcity, but as the price begins collapsing due to a reduction of demand the hoarders will choose between offloading and making a minor loss or holding and risking a major loss.
---
4) The new players have nothing to shield them. They will either ride out the storm as alpha or sub. This is only if your goal is ‘I want every alpha to PLEX’, which is a ridiculous premise I won’t even begin to touch, 
---
So, what was the result?
---
Currently sitting on [this](http://prntscr.com/n1dplu) considering doing a pvp Marauder or selling it
---
Serpentis sites are good, Drone Transceiver is a high value item and the Contaminated Lorentz Fluid is worth a lot in the volumes you get T1 salvage drops.
---
You clearly aren’t getting it. The fact that it’s economic to plex for many people (this is the crux of your case in case you didn’t realize) means there will continue to be upward price pressure save a positive supply shock. 
---
I’m not putting words in your mouth. I’m connecting the dots for your poorly thought out argument and presenting a case for the eventual economic effects of a phenomenon you claim to exist. 
---
&gt; If fewer people are playing the demand drops.
---
and so does the supply
---
[Get some help brah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l60MnDJklnM)
---
So do you have 2.7 tril of PLEX to throw on the market every day for a month or 2 straight ? Maybe longer the way things are going right now.
---
Makes me feel bad for always playing in potato mode
---
Or maybe give that as a task to locator agents? They can track the new identity of a character based on an old name, or vice versa. Would save load bloat for those of us that don't care, but leave it as an option for those that need to keep tabs on folk.
---
I'd definitely say it should be limited, even as a one-off. That'd allow forgiveness for a mistake but not make career criminals able to just re-identity themselves after every corp theft/awox/whatever.
---
What was the total dps you used ?  
---
They can do a lot to reduce it by putting a minimum NPC broker's fee on orders, even if they're placed at a 0.0% citadel. Even something like 0.3% would be a disincentive to speculative orders. (It would also be an ISK sink - with a Jita volume of around 1.5m units a day, worth 6000bn at current prices, you'd be sinking 20bn ISK a day. But that is small beer in comparison with the existing fountains and sinks.)
---
dudes, ... regulatory of IRL markets are not done by restricting how much of anything you can have, but it's restricted MOSTLY around information warfare when somebody uses his informations to manipulate markets (usually insider info which is not yet public)
---
this so called "manipulation" is purely based on how much isks people have and there is no reason to restrict anybody. If I would like to crash prices with my stash, am free to do it as well as am free to fire up prices upvards if i want to.
---
This is market, stop bitching about it. This is caused MAINLY by CCP and their stupid idea of skillinjectors and fozzie sov, that's the fucking baseline. Those two things. nothing else.
---
&gt; 2) You don’t protect the market. At most you can implement a PLEX lock after purchase, 
---
If you read my proposal, CCP can implement a PLEX stash upper limit which rejects more PLEX if the purchase is made by ISK (but admits more if it is made by cash from CCP).
---
&gt; but regulating the pricing goes against the principles of a capitalistic free market.
---
You'd be surprised how much regulation there is for typical capitalist free markets.
---
&gt; 3) You gut the amount of ISK entering the market. This brings on a time of scarcity, but as the price begins collapsing due to a reduction of demand the hoarders will choose between
---
Nah. The prices steadily increased last 5 years. Manipulation wasn't the root cause for the PLEX inflation, but amplified it greatly.
---
Just keep it and plex your account so you don't have to worry about game time for the next 96 years 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/71850612/
---
most likely the one you saw
---
I wouldn't say something like that, so no, that's not my argument. Objectively speaking, the phenomenon I described has existed since GTCs existed, and we've never had Plex spike like this before. Yes, it contributes to Plex price increasing, but it's a stable influence, nothing like what we're seeing here with a significant spike and far lower of Plex volumes on the market.
---
My point was that just because something was true for one person in a position of privilege, doesn't mean it is for others who are less fortunate. That's it. So saying "my argument is X" is by definition putting words in my mouth.
---
Why go defensive plexing, just grab a frigate/destroyer and do noice/small offensive plexes.
---
The Providence should have been the carrier hull for Amarr 
---
Totally balanced that a response fleet (and an escalation) can cyno in within application range despite there being an anchored cyno inhib ...
---
&gt; on accident
---
nah man, it was by purpose
---
Horde is pretty ideal if you want null-sec benefits without actually having to be active.
---
most complaints about sibs and hanzo focus on how he's reckless and kind of a dick, not on them being bad at eve online
---
Some guys who dicked around with input broadcasted titans (mostly rags) who killed every super or titan that showed up and pretty much only lived on sisi. 
---
If you can change gender irl but not ingame, then why not change gender irl again? Not CCPs fault you changed gender lol
---
Have a +1 XD
---
Wouldn't cause any possible problems with character reputation/identity like a name change might do and seems lore compatible, so if it is possible coding-wise: Sure, why not.
---
Best of luck to you irl.
---
&gt; Okay, no, we're talking about trading markets here. You're coming at this from a consumer perspective which is entirely, one hundred percent irrelevant
---
No it isn't, Eve's market also functions as a consumer market, for ships, modules etc. And he's right, game mechanics give you a guarantee about the quality of those items.
---
I do see your point that those regulations are somewhat different to trading regulations though.
---
I said I can't change gender irl. :p 
---
Think it's about right. One thing to mention is that they are concerned about ISK faucets in the game, and if they let the market rise high enough, then seed the market with Plex at that value to 'stabilise' the market, that's a nice chunk of ISK black-holed in the process. So the higher it goes before they do that, the more ISK they can draw into a sink if/when they do this. Now that's a bit more tinfoil-hatty, saying they're in favour of rising prices  as an investment against a future isk sink; simply saying they don't care because it makes a zero-to-positive change to their revenue is completely logical.
---
For me kek will allways be a WoW meme (It's what an alliance member sees when a Horde member types "lol")
---
no one cares
---
Just make a new char ffs
---
Yes, but not always feasible. I am currently signed off on long-term sickness for a back injury, and sick pay is barely enough to cover bills: not really an option to spend money on a game subscription, but I have infinite time and a very fancy gaming chair that I can sit in without mind-blowing pain. So I can play more than normal and earn isk to plex an account if I want, or I can go Alpha, but there's no option to work IRL more and earn the cash to pay.
---
Anyone else getting Ori mothership vibes? 
---
widzisz chlopie, a mnie kurwy z CCP wymyslily taki scenariusz na gre, ze mi podsunely mezatke i prowokowaly mnie do zdrady. Pewnie jakbym to pchnal do przodu  to dostalbym wpierdol bo jakas parowa deweloperska ustawila takie zalozenie w swoim systemie. Oczywiscie cala odpowiedzialnosc, u deweloperskiej niekompetentnej kurwy powszechnie znanej jako CCP, sie zawsze rozmywa, a reka reke myje, dlatego bez oporow produkuja tego typu kwiatki, a mi zarzucaja ze jestem zbyt wulgarny a jednoczesnie maja ubaw ze czlowiek sie wkurwia kiedy staje w obliczu takie typu kurestwa. No... a takich kwiatuszkow znalazloby sie jeszcze kilka
---
https://youtu.be/08A3xMbobeU
---
After 12 years invested in this one? I'd really rather not.
---
There are a lot of players who cannot afford to pay eve with real money. Tbh id really like to see some stats into how many players pay their subscription with PLEX. And you will see that the number is higher then you can imagine. Also im not saying every alpha should plex. That is stupid. But the ones who cannot pay RL money what is their chance into upgrading their account to omega from a single alpha account. This has to be taken into consideration by CCP as it is vital for the overall game health to attract new blood into the game. 
---
Because eve is future
---
Two very different thematic universes though - VTM is an actual horror setting.
---
Because faction capitals are only flown by 1-5% of the player base, and are barely seen as well. Were as adding drifter subcaps will effect much more and will be a hell of alot cooler than caps that only tje richest of players will ever own/fly
---
The triglavians in consort with the Sansha are stabalising the conduit technology, in preparation for an invasion of new Eden.
---
Who is that was trying to buy Jita out of Plex? Or more to the point, whose alliance was it?
---
I was so sad to discover this. I love the vertical ship visual, and really wanted that deformed seahorse of a ship. But it just made no sense because it's meh at its best: by the time I'd gotten half the SP to fit and fly it, I could side-train into Caldari and fly a Ferox in less time for way more efficient results, or just hop in a VNI with zero further training. It's just sad, I do think it's a pretty ship, just drastically unimpressive.
---
&gt;Fact that PLEX is over speculated is obvious
---
There is probably some, but how would you tell the difference between that and running out?
---
Well, if you live in a country that supresses trans people, i can only imagine having a gendermatching irl/online presence can only be a good thing. 
---
I know it might sound silly to suggest you get called out by having a other-gendered char in a video game, but if you are already suspected, having other-gendered char online propably wouldn't help. Unless you never talk with anyone irl about eve online and your corpmates are all not inside your country. Does this make sense?
---
What better than making money? Preventing your enemy from making money.
---
The triglavians in consort with the Sansha are stabalising the conduit technology, in preparation for an invasion of new Eden. One could assume that these permanently open conduits leading to a large force, is a staging for the coming invasion. 
---
Again, why not both?
---
Is it possible they got intel of the coming invasion and are ready to tank triglavians.
---
It's quite easy to create a custom search to find the answer you're looking for:
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/293960077/ship/29990/losses
---
/character/293960077 is Romantic Exorcism
---
/ship/29990 is Loki
---
/losses/ only shows losses
---
&gt;you have 10-20% inflation of ISK monthly because of how easy it is to make ISK now.
---
Not really. Ships/modules cost about the same. Plex and related items seem to be the only things going up.
---
/losses only shows losses
---
Then you go through that to find the one that fits, which Masquenada linked above
---
Nah, it's more I can't because of real life issues, only really have friends online and they know I'm trans. Having a character online that matches me is just a nice thing to have, and feels more comfortable to use. Don't really have anyone I talk about eve with anymore, not since I got started. 
---
Roaming NPC null constellations in the past, and same mileage. I've pretty much stopped doing this because this feels like what many many explorers attempt when they want to do riskier stuff than hs or ls exploration, but still safer than inhabited null. I've noticed quite a few exploration ships when looking for sites in GW and Curse back then, it feels there's just too many people doing that.
---
a healthy competition, a win for consumers :D and good fights for the competitors :D
---
We could do that with EVE. anal [Punisher]
---
no
---
If you see a square, run for your life. Those maniacs are often pissed beyond reason. 
---
Thats how the real world works too. 
---
Ah yes, that looks like it, I did scroll through the losses, but just couldn't find it. thanks :)
---
thanks for that, I just couldnt see the wood for the trees as it were.  appreciate your time for replying :)
---
Poor thing. I hope he is ok. He is very pretty. 
---
can u make a sidebar that displays jita market plex price per piece?
---
Yes and no, v:tm is, or at least was, often highly political, the whole original focus on the Camarilla, with Ventrue (Caldari’ish), Toreador (Gallente’ish) and Brujah (Minmatar’ish) vs. the Sabbat and their Lasombra leaders (Amarr’ish).
---
Some extra figures OP:  
---
Hours working at minimum wage (USA) to plex account - 2.1 hrs
---
Hours working at average national salary (USA) to plex account - 0.5 hrs
---
Hours worked at minimum wage (UK) to plex account - 1.5 hrs
---
Hours worked at average national salary (UK) to plex account - 0.5 hrs
---
Hours worked at minimum wage (EU - low to highend) to plex account - 0.4 hrs to 1.5 hrs, depending on how shit your country is.
---
Woukda survived if it was a shield super.
---
&gt;people getting emotionally invested in their pixel character  
---
Sigh
---
&gt;Wouldn't cause any possible problems with character reputation/identity like a name change might do
---
Injectors already made it possible to wipe everything from name to corp history. Name change would weight nothing in there.
---
Unfortunately, GDPR is intentionally vague in wording to allow for prosecution where folk tried to circumvent on a technicality. Anything classed as "personally identifying information" can be considered protected, so things like account or character names are technically covered. Thus, they cannot tell you the details created by the referee, so would need to list is as the email address or real name submitted by you. But wait! Right to removal clause means they cannot store someone else's email, name, etc. on a third party (referer) account because the referee would need complete control over what is stored where and gave access to delete this if they want. 
---
So yeah, whilst the Alpha or Omega status may or may not (probably not) be covered, there's no way for them to assign "Referal#1" and "Referal#2" more intuitive names, given they cannot use the data you submitted about the other person and cannot give you the data that other person submitted via their own account/account creation.
---
Maybe giving an option to name the referrals yourself after the fact, with an instruction to not use real names and a validation rule disallowing emails (easy to say no "@" or ".") so if you know who took your link you can name it yourself using whatever info you have and they're absolved of accusations of sharing/storing data belonging to the referee on an account not in the view/control of that individual.
---
Why would you use your PLEX Vault to store them then in that scenario?  
---
Limiting the PLEX vault doesn't stop hoarding. It just stops how much you have in the PLEX vault.
---
I’m super excited to see what happens with this. My predictions, this is a new rare spawn where you get the chance to claim capital skill books/BPCs if you successfully complete this room. It also seems to only appear for T5s! 
---
In case anyone wasn’t aware - EVEsterdam this weekend, so we will find out!! 
---
What? The friends you've made, the times you've spent doing stupid shit, hanging around with people. Means nothing to ya? You can start again on a new character, but it feels weird, lie you're not quite the same person. 
---
I didn't know something like a gender change wasn't possible in game... I am surprised actually! O.o
---
Well, in any case you would probably have more luck appealing directly to CCP at the forums for this particular request!
---
Doubt it would be such a complicated think to code... Just make it an added feature for the face Sculpture consumable they had in store...
---
In any case, best of luck to you o7
---
Just look at the volumes sold they are not dropping but raising. People speculate up and sell stocks that they have.     
---
it is like "180k plex left in jita" while daily volume around ~1.5kk units and on constant raise due to people panicking :D        
---
They have been doing just that for years! lol
---
Whatever does plex vault have to do with this?..
---
Emphasis on "might". It depends how CCP would implement it.
---
A re-injected character is obvious in what it is, costs a lot of money and wastes a lot of skillpoint. Unlike changing the character avatar there are some valid concers with a name change that would have to be adressed(I would be in favour of allowing it if properly implemented, but that is another topic).
---
It is just few big players.       
---
You can find 20 people in EVE that using isk can buy up like a 2 month supply of plex driving the price to insane prices.           
---
Why are they not doing it ... when i asked this question i got simple answer  ... this could lead to CCP regulation of the market and quite possibly few bans ... why risk it.  
---
Not that I'm against both, but as much as I like CCP they are notorious for not delivering. And getting both would be a far fetch dream. 
---
So why not both? Because i dont believe CCP will release 2 lines of ships and if i had to pick which line to release; i would pick the one that more people would have access to instead of 1-5% of players.
---
Aka. Angel capitals and sansha capital
---
These are all the things you did. The character is just a medium, it's not weird at all to just swap out a medium if it doesn't fit your needs. Friends will allways be friends no matter which character you play on. If not they're not friends. 
---
&gt;You can start again on a new character, but it feels weird, lie you're not quite the same person.  
---
Speak for yourself lol
---
This, dear sir, is a mighty shitpost I approve of. 
---
There are still four interceptors with plenty of combat capability for swarms. Again, this is philosophical issue - if anything, it was primarily trying to deal with fozzie sov mechanics, not krabbing. 
---
So you are the cookie looking for chocolate chips?
---
They have raw data, sure. But without a way to sort and analyze the data, it's just data. 
---
PLEX manipulators need to store large quantities of PLEX somewhere. Take away their storage and they can't do what they do anymore.
---
Please delete your reddit account, you don't deserve to carry that name. 
---
I agree its only really plex and pilot services that are inflating, the rest of the market remains stable.
---
If this was blanket inflation everything would be rising in price we would see stuff like veldspar as well as modules and ammo all inflate at the same rate of inflation, but were not seeing that, or not since the last time I checked anyway, its only PLEX.
---
/tinfoil hat : Personally I think this is CCP manipulating the price up because they want more money for their new owners.
---
Your assuming they would be faction cost, the trig battleships arnt a huge amount more than t1 and less than t2 so double the cost of a normal dread is easily achievable
---
That seems quite short sighted? Do they not employ data analysts on staff? SQL experts? Power BI Report developers? There's literally 100 different ways they could attack this problem.....if they wished to try.
---
&gt; Why would you use your PLEX Vault to store them then in that scenario?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Limiting the PLEX vault doesn't stop hoarding. It just stops how much you have in the PLEX vault.
---
Forgot adding another detail in the post. In this system you can't take PLEX from vault to your inventory. You buy it from CCP and it appears there, you sell it or trade it to other characters from there. There is no taking it in the inventory or in a ship.
---
&gt; And if you mean stopping how much PLEX you can have in general, thats a dumb idea. Most people I know that PLEX tend to store on one character and then gift their accounts subs, rather than dealing with the idiocy of transactions per account.
---
I PLEX 36 accounts myself do tell me more. In this system you'd have to buy 1000, gift 2 characters, buy 1000 more. You have to buy it live, there is no "storing" PLEX. 
---
The idea is regulating the PLEX price vs manipulation is more important than this slight hassle people with many accounts will be introduced.
---
Never said it was being addressed.
---
What could go wrong of living under the biggest hostile super cap fleet in game?
---
Should get some decent rents there ape boy.
---
Oh yeah, this is going to end well. 
---
The Primate Wars must continue. 
---
So rorquals become dreadnoughts?
---
Fair enough.  It’s good that the option is there in that case.
---
Large damage resist bonus = fine
---
invulnerability = bad
---
Sul if you’re reading this I had shit to do with this one
---
&gt; The problem with your "focus on pvp between FW pilots" mentality is that it goes against the fundamental sandbox nature of EVE.
---
Not the first time that the "EVE is a sandbox" has been used and and won't be the last.
---
Yes, EVE is a sandbox, but there is a difference between a patch of mud where you get to do everything you want and a well-organized sandbox with tools, different spaces, and rules. EVE is not a patch of mud because things like CONCORD exist for example.
---
&gt; CCP will *always* be chasing multiple hares all the time, changes to one system will always have butterfly effects to other systems
---
Yeah, and maybe you should wonder if this is not the very cause of why the game is in such a state?! Such the butterfly effect exists, but things like Jump Fatigue exist specifically to mitigate and make that effect controllable, you may not like it but even CCP has realized that they *can't* just go after multiple hares at the same time.
---
&gt; FW will always exist concurrently with non-FW pilots. Feature suggestions should embrace that, because CCP will always have a wider focus beyond FW.
---
As long as the ability to build sandcastles and knock them off exists, it is a sandbox. Having different parts of it allowing Caps or not doesn't change that. Having different part that cater to different people doesn't change that, so I see no problem designing a space that favors FW pilots, as long as they get to play on the same server and they are dependent on other areas of space (for T3 stuffs or high-end minerals for example).
---
I have no problem with non-FW pilots living alongside FW pilots. But for the space to be designed around them? This is the very thing that is blocking the potential of FW space.
---
The silver lining is we won't have to do any bloody entosising any more. 
---
thta's russians for you
---
Just run a t1 abyssal. Any t1 cruiser can do it.
---
I like it!
---
&gt; What happened to make this Plex crisis? Is it a crisis?
---
More and more people having lots of isk through super ratting (total isk in the game is rising stupidly), skill injector farm consuming a lot of PLEX to buy omega, MCTs and extractors to make injectors, which are used to inject more supers / rorquals, which increase the isk in the game, etc etc. If the amount of people selling PLEX doesn't increase, price is always going to go up pretty damn fast.
---
Imperium is gonna to have to evict you guys from lowsec again

Except unlike bitcoin, PLEX is used and consumed, and isk quantity in the game is rising fast. So basically there is always going to be a pressure price of PLEX, even if the price crash after a dump or a PLEX sales.
---
Leshaks cost about 365mil now, and the only faction BB near 2t BB are bargest. (Around 830mil)
---
Even if trig cap bpcs are common, the material cost alone will keep prices high. Assuming that they will need iso-10 and zero point cons.
---
I got one and also an Ark. 
---
Lost 1 Provi, but still got my Ark from 2 years back. 
---
Ark is life! 
---
I mean..people that don't have to steal tend to pay for goods and services rendered.
---
Keep in mind Triglavian's are not a "Pirate" faction. They are their own race with completely separate skills/weapons.
---
So if a trig capital is released, it would be treated the same as a normal capital, with the only limiting factor being abyssal materials (which very well may still make these very expensive depending on how much is needed).
---
Its bound to cause another abyssal boon so people can make isk on mats to prepare building these things.
---
Hi new neighbors!

It doesn't ruin the game or even affect it in anyway to grant op's request. So why are you opposed to it?

What?! Entosising is thrilling and engaging gameplay!

I don’t really think ccp can do anything to make phoons viable in large scale fleet fights. The main problem with it is missiles in large scale fights with tidi are almost useless, the delay in damage makes them much worse off even if they look good on paper.
---
YOU DON'T ENJOY THOSE ENGAGING GAMEPLAY MECHANICS? HERESY.
---
In words of our enlightened leadership: "We'll just have to run back to the hills and fling poo at them."
---
Or at the very least  makes it riskier to move a huge quantity of it if needed
---
tbh it looks like a structure to me. maybe something that will appear as part of the 'invasion', could even be ccp's first foray into the 'forward base' structures intended to replace some POS use cases. 
---
No, it doesn't. Again, even if you buy consumer goods, it's not a consumer market, it's a trading market.
---
If I can walk into a grocery store and _sell_ a banana for the price that I want to sell the banana at, it's not a consumer marketplace, it's a trading market.
---
If I can walk into a stock exchange, but instead of a trading floor there's a person behind a desk who sets the prices on various stocks and I'm only able to buy at those prices, even though it's a tradeable security and not a consumer good, that's a consumer market, not a trading marketplace.
---
And again, regarding guarantees -- if you ever buy something and receive something else, then that's not a failure of regulation, that's an act of fraud. You've been done a crime, and should go get a police to achieve great good. That's regardless of how heavily regulated the market is.
---
Just because people go to Jita and buy things that they then use doesn't make it an appropriate modelling of a consumer market. That's simply not accurate, especially given the context of the discussion relating to that this somehow demonstrates some effects of low regulation.
---
EVE simply does not demonstrate the results of an unregulated consumer market, not because you know what you're buying, but because it doesn't model a consumer market.
---
Jump? Jump Jump Jump!

Good ol SMA. Born trash, was trash, still trash.

Hi!

---
lol bye
---
&gt; Someone actually lost fights to Darwinism.
---
wtf
---
&gt; SMA
---
Oh...
---
Okay lets look at this from a different angle since for some reason you've made yourself used to a higher level of autism required to PLEX yourself than necessary.
---
How would you handle gifting more than 2 month subscription to an alt? Most dudes I know will buy a few months worth of PLEX during a sale dip and then coast to the next price correct. In your system you would need to gift 2 months, activate 2 months, gift 2 months, activate 2 months, over and over.
---
Crucially, you have achieved absolutely nothing except inconvenience the majority of players, to try to place restrictions on the 0.01% of players who horde PLEX to manipulate the market.
---
The next workaround to your suggestion would be to use corp hangar to store, and then you're basically talking about massive restrictions to achieve something stupid.
---
You want to talk about market control? You can peg the exchange rate of the PLEX to ISK like they do in some games, and have that changed at the server level. But that defies the entire objective of an unrestricted capitalist market like you have in EVE, so again, your idea makes no sense.
---
I remember Entosis in the last SMA structure in Fade back in the Big One. Didn’t know they survived. 
---
confirmed, shocked us as well
---
Sorta like that Clint Eastwood movie where the old gunfighter keeps getting doxed. 
---
WtB person who ejects from rorq I have tackled.
---
Can you be more specific? I'm curious.   
---
Apparently everyone who isn't at direct war with goons is a goonpet so it's a pretty large category
---
because the next step is Namechange since they now call themselfes 'Stephan' instead of 'stephanie' and i also rather have CCP spend Dev time on more important issues than Character profiles.
---
You've also got standings, assets, docking rights, and the big one, SP, which are either a pain or impossible to transfer to a new character.
---
as if people haven't always specifically greifed streamers dude lmao
---
Cheers! I do straight DPS race in Leshak rooms normally for the same reason, it's possible to outrange them in a drone-focused Gila but you will eventually get trapped between the boundary and a world of hurt.
---
I imagine dps race will still work with a Gila in this pocket, but transversal doesnt help the gila much against Leshaks even with minimised sig so it could be squeaky. Looking forward to trying it!
---
It's clearly intentional that the basic 'genetics' of your medclone have to stay the same. We can't change anything except the superficials after character creation. Changing what you look like so you aren't recognisable shouldn't be too easy.
---
That said I don't really see why there can't be an item like the body resculpt cert that lets you switch gender. Obviously none of your clothes would fit any more so you'd have to be reset to default clothing, but we can already have clothes of the wrong sex on our inventory so that shouldn't be a problem.

---
Although VNI isn't even that expensive, you should probably start by buying that. If you run high sec scannable combat sites (watch/lookout/DED 3/4) your risk is essentially zero while you learn how to fly it.
---
The only thing it could have been said to have failed at is that it *didn't* melt.

Not true since they added that 'you're going too fast' thing.

undock, come up with a plan, or dont, who cares as long as you have fun. repeat.
---
its a game btw.
---
It wasn't me guys, honest
---
No. The idea here is that you can't obtain more than 1000. Not in inventory, not in vault. Nowhere to store.
---
SMA is in QFC now? lol I knew they'd go running back to goons.
---
I mean, https://zkillboard.com/ship/49711/kills has Drekavac kills - the stats page lets you filter by groups (so you can see all dreads killed by Dreks, and so on): https://zkillboard.com/ship/49711/stats/

I don't think you can do /ship/x/reset/ship/y/losses, that seems to break things

Sma are shit. Water is wet. 
---
You can see he has zero ignored, and the filtered ones will be anomalies, not cosmic sigs 
---
This is what you get show in the marketwindow as long as you dont' click on a specific item. 
---
For industrials the window to show all Sell-orders is really important.
---
Furthermore, the Diabloshop is in one location only, in Eve Items are sold everywhere, often enough buying stuff outside of jita is cheaper than jita itself. Limiting the View to one spot only is just limiting your options.
---
&gt; small gang/nano is such in a bad spot atm i just have more fun with others games then.

When I'm logged I'm mostly having fun. But it's hard to get motivated to log in atm.

I think I just have more fun with my other hobbies. I kinda want to build by own Keyboard, SmartHome stuff like LED strips controlled by phone, 3D printing.
---
Correct.
---
CCP needs to act like a central bank, not a communist dictatorship. They have two tools, essentially, to impact the plex market - running sales, and confiscated plex from botters/RMTers. 
---
That should be enough. 
---
I just put an image source in OBS over the area where I keep corp/alliance and local chats and one over my overview. Tbh I would only cover the chats but its corp and alliance policy to cover overview as well. Not like people arent gonna find me anyway.

the new ship will most likely be a Triglavian dread. You can see it on world tour splash screen and encounter it in tier 5 sites since march 20

i just physically shit my pants
---
&gt; How would you handle gifting more than 2 month subscription to an alt? Most dudes I know will buy a few months worth of PLEX for all accounts during a sale dip and then coast to the next price correction (aka sale). In your system you would need to buy 1000, gift 2 months, activate 2 months, buy 1000, gift 2 months, activate 2 months, over and over.
---
In my system you can do that "over and over" part in 10 minutes, thereby subbing your account for however long you want during a market low point if you care about those. You can buy infinitely many PLEX as long as you are converting them to sub directly after buying.
---
&gt; Crucially, you have achieved absolutely nothing except 
---
Except protecting PLEX vs manipulation
---
&gt;  inconvenience the majority of players,
---
If you ever tried to PLEX 36 accs, you already have to do it one at a time and it takes a good 10 minutes (the purchase is slow af as well). I just added 5 more minutes, to protect PLEX from manipulation. How inconvenient for people with 100 characters.
---
&gt; The next workaround to your suggestion would be to use corp hangar to store
---
Ban storage of PLEX in corp hangars.
---
&gt; achieve something stupid.
---
Protecting of PLEX vs manipulation is not stupid.
---
&gt; But that defies the entire objective of an unrestricted capitalist market
---
Abstract political goals you think Eve has are not more important than protecting PLEX against manipulation. 
---
&gt; You can peg the exchange rate of the PLEX to ISK like they do in some games
---
A non-manipulated market is good for PLEX to adjust vs inflation or devaluation of stuff such as minerals. All they'd need to achieve that is inconvenience someone with 35 accs like me to spend 5 more minutes for each month of PLEXing. Cry me a river.
---
At any rate, you sound like you have some skin in the PLEX manipulation game lol.
---
Downvoted for pointing out where battleships are actually used. &lt;3 r/eve

Remember how the Diablo 3 market was run straight into the ground by RMT bots? I don't think that's something to aspire to.
---
And this changes exactly what????
---
You sir, are correct on all points. Some flavor of a tracking and / or bonus buff would defiantly help but, I think CCP hates Gallente 😂
---
When was it not?
---
I still get a chuckle every time I visit that site. I get a visualization of some hobo under a bridge with a trolly of shit under a blanket. That stuff covered up is all the new and shiny stuff we have to play and break. Good times. Oh...and he is obviously pantsless
---
&gt; CCP needs to act like a central bank, not a communist dictatorship.
---
Market regulation is not communism. It is everywhere in capitalist markets. 
---
He proposed fixed exchange rate. That's closer to communism.
---
Sales do next to nothing wrt PLEX manipulation.
---
Gosh you are so uneducated.
---
The payout for plexing isn't the problem, the tiers are. You certainly don't get 1 bil isk a day fighting for the faction in tier 1! The tier system promotes flip-flop farming and makes it almost impossible for the losing faction to make any headway. Just remove all the tiers.
---
And yes missions are only used for farming, in meme snipe fits that don't actually clear the sites. Remove them all or vastly nerf their LP payout, or require the site to actually be cleared to complete the mission.
---
3 days ago I have beaten Big Ape. Fuck Big Ape, you filthy Miniknogs.
---
New players should just spend the 15 bucks and spend their isk on things that are fun.  
---
IMO they can remove PLEX for subs, because players plexing 50-75+ accounts are a much bigger problem for dragging new players into the game then alphas not being able to upgrade
---
what a wonderful thread
---
Sure but the limitations to hisec and certain wormholes whatnot still make caps limiting.
---
Besides, aren't we waiting for those sweet Angel caps? 
---
So why the stay out of derelik? 
---
THE PROBLEM IS THE SUPE THE RAT THE CARRIER THE SUPERCARRIER NERF THE RAT THE NERF SUPER NERF THE CARRIER APPLICATION!!!!!!!44!4

THEY RUIN THE ISK THE MARKET TOO MANY RUIN ISK CAN'T KILL WITH SOLO CARACAL!!!44!!
---
THE GOONS THE DELVE NO GOON NO DELVE LOT OF CARRIER GOD BLESS OLMECA!
---
&gt; That should be enough.
---
That's what everyone says who's got no fucking clue what he's talking about.
---
I was kinda asking for it. Just needed to vent a bit, neither /r/eve or the eve forums are exactly friendly to this. 
---
Very sad to hear. Loved being able to just hop in a ship and roam with him at any given time. Will definately look out for my next notification about you going live!

---
thank your for explaining why it's a waste of time :)
---
Oh noooooo
---
You’re being dense so this is the last moment of my life I’ll waste. You are clearly saying that it’s economic for some people to grind for plex. If it weren’t then they would pay. Stop trying to muddy the waters here.
---
This is the last conversation I would ever like to have with you. Thanks for your time. 
---
Someday they'll also have flycatchers and then we'll have problems
---
There's a megathread for this stuff now. Just post it there.  
---
And ofcourse they can, if you think the market in eve is controlled by supply demand only you really have no idea how rich people really are in Eve.   
---
People have multiple trillions and with so much ISK you can do whatever you want really. This whole PLEX thing is just because some rich people thought it was a good idea to buy a fuckton of PLEX knowing that restocking the market would take alot of time which means the PLEX price is alot higher at this moment.  
---
Luckily for non trillionairs a fellow trillionaire dumped a big amount of his stashed PLEX on the market so we can finally stop bitching on reddit.
---
Cheers!
---
Why is entosising not fun? I understand that it can take a long time and kind of terrible if the opposition doesn't show up, but I would have thought it's pretty good for chasing after toasters and having fights.
---
can i have your stuff?
---
one kidney, one lung, and either the heart or liver!
---
incursions
---
That was pretty cool.
---
I know cap kills &gt; subcaps (the only thing better than killing caps is killing supers!), but its still kinda nice that they responded and killed a good number of T3's.
---
The blood of the youth will not make this game last longer or look younger.
---
What about the cro magnon assault on the apes?
---
"ayy guys, I rolled a new one because I wanted tits/beard on my avatar"
---
"Aight, cool brah. You game for a roam tonight btw?"
---
Ofc, not hyping capitals. Just saying that people treat trig stuff like pirate stuff. Its not, its technically the t1 offerings of a whole new faction (outside the zarm, which is t2 logi).
---
Id rather see them rebalance navy cruisers/battleships, but im biased. 
---
On the other hand, if these dreads can fit through a large WH (matching the low mass attribute of their other ships), could be interesting popping out in a ratting pocket to melt a carrier/rorq and then retreat before the blobberino happens. Probably OP though, and would make it easy to do the opposite, plopping a bunch of dreads in WH easily.
---
Agreed, coincidentally enough CCP listing confiscated PLEX for sale on the market is an identical tool to money supply increase by a central bank.
---
It's a crude example but I think sales could be comparable to an interest rate drop, since it incentivises more entrants to the consumer market (arguably its not a perfect analogy but for the purpose of continuing this bank theme, I'm happy to
---
yeah I'd love for the devs to allow this just to see parts of the playerbase inevitably lose their shit
---
I was just memeing
---
What's with this game? Every time I see it mentioned someone is spamming about how great it is (while taking hundreds of dollars for beta places and claiming to be a universe-scale game while launching with one solar system?)
---
thanks 
---
You're entirely wrong but I won't try to convince you further. I'll take comfort in the fact that CCP would probably take a more reasoned approach than read this drivel and have a lightbulb moment.
---
Think they disbanded, came back from the dead
---
They did attempt to move back into fade a few months ago, can't of went well if they've ended up in querious
---
Tie PANIC to a RNG self destruct timer, with a mini-game to disarm it.  Successfully disarming it causes PLEX prices to increase in jita and increments the cyno spool up timer.
---
Also, PANIC provides a bonus to ship velocity, agility and sig radius for any ship on grid.
---
YOLO swagtastic.
---
Friday on r/eve and a Darwin shitpost is near the top of the list? Ima go buy a lottery ticket.   I got a good feeling about this!  Also hail to Capton Hammer the hero FC we need and his trainee FC Crystalline Entity.  You've done a stirling job leading fleets away from the Arzanni gate.  Who knows how many yolo Tayras have escaped the clutches of Darwinsm to yolo another day.

lmao dude that video is awesome. deffo submit it on its own.

Idk I think most serious industrialists/players in the region long term are in lo sec so vulnerable anyway. It’s more a resistance to expanding a mechanic that has issues rather than trying to fix/resolve it first.
---
I'm having what this guy's having 
---
It doesn't matter if HK was dropping structures in your space.
---
They dropped one in our space, we tried to kill it, and FRT stopped us from doing so.
---
That was the NIP violation.  FRT prevented us from defending our space.
---
it already works :)
---
This is a great shitpost!
---
Also, I thought you guys were dead already, so congratz on still being around I guess?
---
nope
---
Grow up.
---
15$ saved thanks and God bless
---
Yeah. I agree that throwing ungrounded shit to this proposal is the best approach for someone like you who defends PLEX manipulation out of self interest.
---
Bob bless 
---
It could be loads of fun if it weren't ran against an alliance who runs from a fight even when the odds are in their favor. SMA don't give gfs, they peek in and run home everytime. QFC is a cover for their Querious carebear club. 
---
This is not the case, I don't play as much as someone plexing their accounts so I don't have as much isk. The only advantage I have over someone who plexes is that I can spend more time in game blowing up spaceships that I like and less time collecting isk with activities that I dont like.
---
I use my second account for isk generation to fund my internet spaceships addiction so I can fly 1bil+ strats and blingy faction battleships when I go to pew pew
---
Nope, also an 800mil still has 3 timers that you have to shop up for, each one with a damage cap, up to 10 days of RF and once you have finally killed it, all the assets inside will be automagically teleported to safety.
---
God bless.
---
CCP is not responsible of PLEX prices, and they rightfully don't give a fuck about it.
---
Please stop bitching.
---
Short answer being: they can upgrade. Eventually.
---
Longer answer being: What’s your timeframe for these Alphas upgrading? The very same month they come in?
---
Long answer being: If you compare the time taken between an alpha getting to the point of comfortably PLEXing they will need skill injectors and at least carrier ratting, from a single account only. Then, all factors point towards just working that many hours more in a month and simply not having their game lifespan tied to a resource like PLEX. Because then even at minimum wage, they’ll earn more than enough to pay for a yearly sub for one account if they are willing to spend THAT MANY HOURS grinding for PLEX.
---
The cost benefits just aren’t there dude.
---
And if we are going to shift income downwards, eventually we get to the point where they have bigger things to worry about than shooting space pixels in a spaceship game.
---
Should've been the Amarr super... Aeon looks like garbage... 
---
Asset safety is only a thing in k(rab) space but otherwise correct
---
I disagree here. Aeon has Charackter and Spaceships do not need to be made symetrical.
---
Also, there are plenty of other options for people who want a symetrical design (Nyx comes to mind).
---
remember to Keep Yourself Safe, gamers
---
Yet still I am haunted by the ghost of a long-lost post.
---
Perhaps Lyris Nairn. Ask him if he led lots of Siege Fleets.
---
Ccpls triglavian rorquals!
---
They're preparing for the Plexageddon. Soon there won't be anymore plex
---
It's palpable.
---
Hel is my ship of choice but the provi is so gorgeous it just seems like a design that would be for the top tier ships, end game ships (super and titans) 
---
Technically you can shoot the fighters but there are other defenses you can’t destroy
---
probably as that is what I was looking at from my RL job, at nearly $30/hr before tax I was able to pay for about 3 accounts for yearly subs in a day of work.
---
not doing that anymore... need money for other fun things than managing 3-6 accounts. Ill stick to a max of 2 for now
---
Yes, i think it is one of the tragedies of Eve that this beautiful design is so underutilized.
---
Would be nice if they made something out of it. One frequently requested idea was the one of some sort of Q-ship as a ganker/attacker-trap.
---
Yes you were just pretending to be retarded. Joke's on us.
---
Personally, I’d prefer CCP continue working on the game proper and not a “feature” no one really cares about 15 minutes after they start actually playing.
---
Not really. All iterations of popular multiplayer games such as Battlefield and Call of Duty have a large enough player base to be played just fine (except maybe the reaaaallly old ones). In fact you can just buy the previous game in the series with tons of extra dlc for a fraction of what it cost new.
---
No, that you don't.
---
i'd be careful with such requests.
---
BUT THE CARRIER!
---
Never buy something expensive off the market to fulfill a sell order somewhere else.  General rule.
---
absolute autism 
---
possible? sure
---
worth the amount of effort and lackluster rewards of doing it(even if just to sustain it)? that's the question
---
Yeah I think OP is focusing too much on PLEX as a way for players to pay for their accounts for free, and forgetting its usefulness to the opposite set of players, who use it as a way to leverage their $$$ into getting ISK-rich without having to work for it.
---
It was IChooseYou-

Eve Online's broken attempt to introduce the ability to walk around with your Charackter outside of the Capsule.

It brought us the so called *Captains Quarters* which since have been removed again from the game. The Charackter Creator and ability to see the full body of the Charackter are the only things still left AFAIK.

while msot ships can utilize all their bonuses at once.   nestor can't.  its bonuses are so random that you typically use only a few.   and the ones for large energy weapons might as well be replaced with something else as its essentially a trap due to the powergrid.
---
in short, it needs bonuses that compliment eachother.   not that either gimp it, or can't be used with other bonuses.
---
erm how can you not do both?... seriously, that's what i have been doing NS from 2010-2013....
---
Probably a bit of both. But yeah, how much loss of content does CCP need to see before it does something about capital umbrellas and the unrewarding nature of trying to roam?
---
That guy is a hero. Hands off my libertarian space paradise 
---
yeah why not, this game will only have dumbed down casual mechanics anyway in a few years at the rate they going 
---
if they wouldn't have ACTIVELY ignored those glaring issue for MORE THEN HALF A DECADE it is entirely their fault for not being able to catch up
---
Please don't remind me q.q
---
Yeah, so, not that.
---
I'm picturing something more like incursions, but as an ai police force that carry bounties for the opposing militia only.
---
This is basically how I do it. 64 p0-p1 worlds just sucking it up. This supports 8 p1 to p2 worlds and then 2 more p2 to p3 worlds. This puts out around 1400 robotics per day. The rest of the set ups are p0 to p1 and then p1 to p2 worlds (coolant, enriched, mechanical parts) and one spare oxygen world. I do fuel blocks. Also with leftovers because of planet combinations I do extra miniature electronics. I found long about that 4 and 4 p0 to p1 makes for enough permanent resources for the p1 to p2 world to run nonstop. This is at 4 day cycles. If you do 1 day cycles, cut the number in half give or take.
---
&gt; can't of went well
---
I'm sorry, exactly what are you trying to say? That sentence doesn't make any sense. Like, grammar-wise.
---
I blame Aryth. 
---
If someone is playing for 12 years and cant afford injectors he has been doing something wrong. Assets are transferable and docking rights are usually pretty easy to fix if you join the same group with the new character which isn't particularly hard.
---
And that's beyond stupid from a gameplay perspective. And database prolly too.
---
So now strings: A-BCDE; AB-CDE and ABC-DE are essentially the same in search terms, requiring ABC as input.* And all of them will pop when you use the search system. With additional results such as the infamous ABCD-E and Abcylus lowsec system. And most likely Eabcylus too.
---
Note that with the current search system typing in AB-C still returns all those results.
---
But when you want to name those systems ingame, using actual words, in order to identify them so that the other person can use that as a search query you need to both include the "tac" and three alphanumerics.
---
Again, stupid.
---
* Test that for 0P-U0Q  0PU2-R systems, both show up when you type 0-PU; 0P-U or 0PU as search input.
---
You can kill the fighters, and citadel weapons are considerably weaker than their POS equivalents. Cant defang the missile launchers though
---
HELICOPTER AVATARS WHEN? 
---
Well i am also working right now but i will when i went home 
---
Would appreciate the possibility to donate another kind of corporal fluid 
---
Admittedly, it would be pretty cool if CCP offered some kind of rewards for charitable activities like that.
---
They do have to pay staff salaries, server maintenance etc though, so while cool if you could go to your local red cross and donate some blood, it wouldn't be too financilly viable.
---
This is an interesting killmail totally deserving of its own reddit post.
---
I need you to hodl this bag. 
---
what does "defang" mean? Can you shoot the guns off old stations?
---
1 isk
---
Plot twist, those items are components for the trig capitals
---
Still not defangable, still bumpable, still damage capped, still 15 days to kill an 800m structure, still everything inside completely safe. 
---
What needs to be cleaned up? And how?
---
(Not saying high plex prices are good. but I want to see if you're doing anything but whining)
---
There’s a lot of people ending up in unusual Abyss pockets recently, possibly something to do with the billboard / new event. 
---
I mean I can sell it to you, you can always use some implants if you dont already.
---
Yea he died to an NPC, it says on the killmail you linked. 
---
if only captital ships looked like this when built.. but no all we get is a bar and a timer 
---
I wasn't around for the pos sov system, but I remember Dominion sov being "demoralize enemy first, grind sov second." I also remember the hideous tedium of taking a constellation uncontested in Aegis. I guess the point I was driving at was if players avoid interacting with a system as much as possible, why keep it? And if players have come up with their own system (twice, at least), why not just formalize it? I've usually found CCP's arguments for having sov mechanics to be reasonable, but it seems their goals for those mechanics are never realized. So again: why keep the layer that players hate?
---
You could shoot the guns to offline them on POSes.
---
I wish all propaganda posts were this clever. Nice write-up.
---
Perfect then! Maybe think about snapping some more, it’s gorgeous.
---
hasn't been always like. in a time before moon mining changes, rorq buff and supcap proliferation a rag tag group of elite pilots could hold themselves against a multitude of enemies.
---
but now the best way is to drop recruitment standards to "must have a pulse" to fill those anoms/belts with spodbrains
---
How do we mail the blood to iceland? Is a ziplock fine? 
---
oh. are any of them left? I just finished training for a stealth bomber and this sounds like a fun way to go behind enemy lines and harass a big null alliance
---
But didn't you hear, a multi-billion isk ship that has components worth over a billion each (which will not be safe next patch) should die to five or six retributions worth less than 100 million each.
---
i hope ccp actually decides to implement a lot of the fixes they're promising this time, they might be able to get the game back to a playable state by the end of the year!

I'm actually thinking of using one of those empty 10l wine bags i kept from last year. 
---
The same thing happened to me when I started trading, think of it as a rite of passage.
---
The one thing I will say is if the quantity of the buy and sell are the same. (For example 1 Khanid something or other for sale here, and only 1 buyer elsewhere, at a good margin, dont do it.)
---
Something new. There have been a few posts here about it already.  
---
I expect a big announcement this weekend.

It was actually me, but who's counting...

Wh space, all the assets drop, and you can do a full power astra in 3 days, a low power one in a day and a half.

I agree. Getting to 8-10mil per is taking too long. I'd like to cash out sometime.

i think this structure looks more like a station than a ship. The thrusters you've seen could be docking bays. Maybe trig space is coming?

We had a system in Querious and they were going to join the alliance war in Fountain. I told them not to give up the space, that others were going to move in and take it from us. Of course, none of that mattered.
---
We went to the war, someone took our space and we never went back there.
---
I’ve got ships in Querious that I’ll never be able to get out of there anymore :-)
---
It's not a random station, it's an offshoring citadel market.
---
1k plex is nothing, thats 2 months stash. if people cant stash at least 1 year worth of plex.
---
also during crisis nyse banned shorting certain stocks. result was that liquidity in those stocks dissappeared. you forbid people to buy more plex. the demand side for plex will plummet and price itself will crater as well
---
Yea it's a totally new room, has to do with the new Triglavian arc that we'll probably hear more about during Evesterdam.  The site is basically impossible to finish, but the origin gate isn't locked so you can sneak the loot and get out.
---
You know, I thought this was real up until I saw the April 1st thing. 
---
On a serious note, you *can* pay for EVE with plasma donations. The plasma center near me has a normal rate of $25 per donation (up to 2x a week), and they also give bonuses the more times you give in a month. 
---
It takes 1-2 hours to donate, and not only do you get some dosh, you're also helping create life-saving medicines. 
---
Trig are somewhat in between a "normal" and pirate faction. On one hand they have their own skills and weapons as you said but they also need recources/blueprints that are only available in specific sites (kinda like the blueprints for pirate factions) and vary both in powerlevel and cost from "normal" T1 ships. 
---
&gt; Really hard to say HOW HE DYES. Does someone have any idea?

Honestly it comes down to what colour you are trying to dye the material. You should simmer the dye and boil the clothes in it till you get a nice consistent colour, then permit it to dry.

For very deep colours you may want to dye a second time.

Heela like the poisonous lizard that lives in the Sonoran desert and vomits it's shite through it's mouth because it has no anus.  Just like the ship will do after the April changes.

2: High sec is a good return for your plan. High sec is the place for you and your plan.

Never checked the gate, because, why would it be open...

You die and you learn I suppose.
---
Omfg why do people have such a hard time with this: If someone buys a month of plex from someone SOMEONE ELSE HAD TO GIVE CCP $$$.  NO ONE (except alphas, and who cares about them) IS PLAYING FOR FREE.  IN FACT, PLEX FOR TIME IS MORE PROFITABLE THAN SUBBED ACCOUNTS.  Jesus christ you guys are dense.
---
I didn't say that would solve the problem. I said those two tools should be sufficient to regulate this market without needing price controls. It may not be, but so far it has been sufficient. 
---
In rust we trust, fam.

ca 720 DPS in total over three Hawks
---
I think its too early to tell, and people cant really choose not to buy.
---
Did you play TDZK?
---
Looks like part of a puzzle, get them all and I think it will show the wireframe of the new ship
---
I mean no, they're t1 ships of a new faction. That's objectively what CCP made them. Just because integrating them the way they did makes them a little harder to get than things that have been in the game for over a decade doesn't mean they're technically faction... They have a power increase that compensates for the acquisition issues, and considering the fact that for example the leshak puts out the most dps of a subcapital, and can easily be fit for under a bil... Sure when you release something new, it's going to be expensive... But they have dropped in price significantly.
---
The guy who is basically saying "hey guise, just don't let people put more than $100 in there wallet at a time, that will SURE fix inflashun!" is calling me uneducated? 
---
LOL
---
Sales stimulate the purchasing of plex and get more plex on the market faster. When the issue we are seeing is based at least partially on a lack of supply, this will drive prices down in the short term. When folks start seeing prices drop, they'll dump the plex they've been hoarding in order to cash out while they're still close to the top (assuming this is just regular speculation). 
---
Zeroniss's analogy that this is like a drop in interest rates is pretty good. 
---
A couple of other things I've noticed in low level sites:
---
\- they've fixed the camera so you can zoom out properly yay
---
\- the bioadaptive caches no longer let you combine Triglavian Survey Databases into the previous round of lore items. For the next person to go into this room, can you find if the biocombinative cache in here has a lore item dispense action on it?
---
Your question is flawed at the outset.
---
There is no "safe" afk play in Eve
---
Already dipped, but WH space is probably best space. Take care out there!
---
you cant remove the guns on citadels like you could on poses, but the citadel guns eat cap for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they will stop shooting and have to recharge cap slowly. 
---
this makes citadels much more pleasant to bash than the old dick-star posses
---
also you can kill the citadel's fighters and remove that source of damage from them.
---
It's not harassment if it's a legit game mechanic.  Praise James!
---
It wasnt market bots. It was a glitch that occurred and allowed people to duplicate gold. All the relatively good items became so expensive only those that did the glitch were able to play the market anymore.
---
Looks like a wireframe walkaround of the structure or ship in the uber pocket
---
I aint clicking that link
---
this is the same video as the other thread 
---
For now, but i suspect thats due to CCP wanting them to be strong/popular to generate activity and a new carrot for people to chase and login. See kiki and drek.
---
Even in the minutes, Rise mentioned them being "monsters" in all categories and all need to be looked into [for balance]. The Damavik and Vedmak both feel close to t1 to me, or T1+ if you want. Both are tight on fitting and their tanks arent anything spectacular. Their dps is better than other offerings but thats their niche with the ramp up mechanics.
---
Id imagine over time we will see tweaks as they settle into their niche as the HAC and other T2 variants will continue to live on providing higher dps variants.
---
i found last time i did it, which admittedly was a long time ago, defensive was more consistent income. the best hour doing offensive was about 100m , four novices iirc. but often you would travel long distances to find ones to run.

Looks like it, yeah. Also can someone transliterate the message please.

What? No it doesn't? You establish a consistent data model, you map your data to the model, and you build reports over the data. It's really -not- that hard at all, especially considering platforms like Power BI and Tableu that make report building/analysis so much easier.
---
Fake news, only guided tours in the red light district are banned.

No since they don't' have any mining laser.

Yeah, my last begal had a couple bouts of crystals in his urine, both times were pretty serious and required sedation and catheterization to clear the blockage.  Was pricey as fuck and he had to be on special (expensive) food forever.   He lived to be 14 and was pretty much the best catte ever.

I'm hoping we caught this early enough to handle it with meds and special food.

So the first pocket on some T5s is now also the only pocket, and has a extremely hard wave that you aren’t required to kill to escape? And CCP just dropped this without announcing anything. Interesting 
---

---
I would think acting on analysis that's backed by **actual player data** would be a **top priority** in terms of making a game that benefits ALL Eve players, no? But I guess who needs that sort of data when you have a CSM to tell you how things are/should be, based on anecdotal evidence, instead of practicing actual business intelligence over real data, right?
---
I just find it kind of dumb that CCP seemingly warehouses all this data, but don't actually analyze/use it for the benefit of further development.
---
CCP getting really viral in their marketing now.
---
Watch this be like a Gates of Ahn'qiraj event where we all have to work together against this rising menace.
---
Despite me asking daily, none of my pets are yet to get a job or start paying rent.  :(
---
If CCP needs an employee who will contribute nothing, rarely show up when you want, knock objects off counters and desks, and randomly decide to try to climb the walls they can contact me and I'm sure we could come to an arrangement.   
---
As someone whos been there:

You’d just make everyone make a dozen alpha alts to store their plex

A - how much can you mine an hour?

B - how many hours can you mine a month?

C - how many mining ships will be destroyed a month?  
---
D - how much does it cost to PLEX the mining account?

does D = (A * B) - C ?

Come on man couldn't you have kept this quiet. We don't care what happens to SMA but now I might actually have to go do sov war :(

Old-school triage was amazing and it was a crime that it was removed.
---
That's a station, not a ship.
---
You should censor yourself from posting. Forever and always.  
---
Personally I'm not sure but pinpointed it on cap after brief discussion with some people before sending the post. But I do love the speculation in all the comments, makes it more interesting to see what CCP is going to unveil.
---
So far as an alpha the most lucrative thing for me has been exploration. It's riskier sure, but I've consistently made 15-20 mil an hour, with plenty of spikes from lucky finds. And I'm not even playing particularly efficiently. 
---
It is confirmed it's a capital shipyard

Uggh, I hate math.

why would you publish being so bad, and blatantly not listening to your f1monkey fc, that puts you below the monkeys, like, a snail or something :)

i was at gdc and found a ccp dev (don't know if he would or wouldn't want to be named). i gave him a horde pin and chatted with him for hours! we walked and talked about old ships, dev bugs, graphics settings, just about everything under the sun. i showed him some of my eve photography. it was so genuinely nice. 😊

Ur in for a rough ride then my dude!

Was he goons or just a cfc FC? Seraphim  something(foad maybe?)from widot led some bomber fleets during the fountain eviction, could have been him?

Its in their interest to though. If some people quit because they can't afford to PLEX their account that hurts CCP in the long run.

I mean, isn't that just a bit pedantic? Yeah,  technically I could get blown up while orbiting a starter station in an empty shuttle at 500m, but that doesn't mean it's likely to happen. I could just as easily get shot while walking half a block to the grocery store, but that doesn't necessarily mean I would call it an unsafe activity. I think it's important to distinguish between a possible risk and a likely risk. There are most definitely places in hi-sec that are relatively safe for semi-afk mining. Setting up a venture to orbit and mine a rock with 2 drones deployed can be completely safe from rats with the right fit in hi-sec, and there are plenty of systems where gankers are so uncommon that you can be fairly confident that any encounters with them will be rare enough to consider losses from them negligible.
---
that is how you win eve IRL lol
---
Set and setting is everything, brother.
---
It’s pretty good when people come expecting easy kills and fall for obvious bait Nereuses or let themselves get tackled by a ceptor/assfrig, and then everyone comes in to kill them before they can kill the tackler
---
I don't know how to feel about the sotiyos being utter garbage. On one hand sure its nice to run them when they spawn once in a bluemoon but on the other hand after they were TQ and made to spawn anywhere nothing has been done with them. There is no counter to using carriers 1000km away, no counter for using 2-3 titans to run them and if they aren't run by the renters that live in the system they spawn in they will sit there for 3-4 weeks doing nothing.
---
This is another case of CCP adding a shiny new feature of something that looks cool but is broken and then moving on to the next shiny new feature.
---
No, it doesn't, as that PLEX was already bought by someone so they already have pocketed that money.
---
If you are arguing that it's in their interest to keep or increase their playerbase so they keep having a profitable company, that argument can be used to sustain basically anything related to EVE Online and thus is essentially an empty argument, since it can be used in any circunstance and is so evident that shouldn't even be mentioned.

More players= better for eve. Activity breeds activity. 
---
Thats not even counting that people who plex their accounts might also sub an account or decide that its not worth it and quit entirely. 
---
Is this the pve event that drops a blueprint worth dozens of billions of isk called the Komodo that anybody in a tiny ship can steal from the people doing the site? 
---
I think all this attention is going to mean someone is showered with praise when they steal the drop and become rich as an important eveguy. At least the target of one or two magazine articles and the talk of the town. 
---
Good detective work stainguy, surely this has some people scared out of their wits.
---
&gt;because the next step is Namechange since they now call themselfes 'Stephan' instead of 'stephanie' and i also rather have CCP spend Dev time on more important issues than Character profiles.
---
So you don't have a problem with the gender change itself. Glad you're not a narrow minded idiot.
---
This one is the best though. I wonder who's gonna be brave enough to claim sov in the A2 constellation now...
---
Yeah that played out really well lol.
---
But no I think this capital thing will have a greater effect in the game; some kind of PVE diamond rat level combat with against it.
---
I'm sure we'll see a trailer or something drop this weekend for the next big event.
---
i really hope these triglavian guys can be my friend, they seem really nice in their promo video and not at all like theyre gonna be genocidal

Games are all just pixels and we’re just blobs of water and carbon, nothing matters so why even do anything?
---
&gt; The population that buys plex for RL $ is shrinking
---
https://i.imgur.com/2RWYLfi.png
---
Volume(Supply) is very steady. Demand from the ease of ability to make crazy amounts of isk is high.
---
More CC warriors or lowering isk/hour would solve the problem and lower plex cost. But the problem isn't less plex being sold than before.
---
In the red light district. Y'know that Amsterdam has more than weed and hookers right. 
---
On the contrary, you are viewing it from a far to wide angle. What you are saying is true, but it is such a basic logic that it doesn't bring anything to the specific debate about PLEX prices... or to any debate about changes in the game for that matter, either from the playerbase (like this one) or from the devs (like patch changes).
---
Look at them on zkill and see which one starts dying while in cloaky/t2 ships 
---
Yep this is why i intend to kill all dumb spawns - as something will need to be done if bigger part of those structures will just despawn.      
---
My approach to it is simple. Those meant to be PVEvP ... and those are not 3 sov mid deep constant spawns.        
---
This is dumb - why i ignored the ORE spawn? It was in NPC space and any one had access to it.         
---
you arent looking at killmails that often eh?
---
Ah, so it was less about compensating for the problem and more of a "here's some free shit, now please stfu"?
---
grr deep sov spawns
---
[i found this pic of you](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dq81rDPtR4A/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
More NPC nullsec around the galaxy is needed then make the sites spawn only in those NPC pockets could be a solution
---
So question is simple - who will create script that will start to scan this directory for random strings ending with .mp4 ... first. 
---
Just kidding. If I had that much Plex it would be turned into IRL isk.
---
Yep, any one contest any one have access and not bigger part of spawns going to deep northern&amp;drone areas ...
---
Yes I do
---
I wouldn't say its pedantic, if we want to move the goalposts and start talking about "mostly safe" as opposed to "safe" then fine, yeah, there is a risk/reward calculus at all times. That's not generally what people are asking for though when they inexplicably want to stay in high sec and mine veldspar for fun.

Sounds like you need to upgrade to ns/ wh explo
---
Maybe you should spend less time being offended by words (thus giving them power over you) and more time focusing on actual problems. Words only have power if you give it to them. Actions are the real problem. No one in this game seems to be actually "acting" on racist notions (as you pretty much can't). Words are words. Let them be dumb. I don't "like" it personally, but it certainly isn't CCP's fault that some people like to get a rise out of people like yourself who cannot let words roll off them. In the end, its all about self reflection, but hey, "do you, boo boo".

That more depends on who is involved. It’s very situational. It was only about a year or two ago that the last “impenetrable” sovereignty holding coalition packed up their stuff when the coyotes circled.

Besides, it may not be sweeping changes and massive drama but sov changes hands in areas fairly often. Just don’t be trying to judge it based on anything really short of weeks.

That's why I tagged it with plex market. I figured people may want to scroll right past it.

 I just found it interesting that someone has 2 trillion worth of plex and is now selling it at the marked up price.

Plex market is up around 500 mill for 500 plex at least. Jita stock was actually running under 100k units on sell orders. People spammed woth posts about how it's game ending. Then today a corp mate of mine saw this sell order for 577k plex. I thought it was interesting enough to post. People are exhausted of the plex posts though it seems.

---
It's a natural market balance.  As the ISK price of PLEX rises, people are more likely to buy them for $$$ (increases supply) and less likely to buy them for ISK (reduced demand).  The inverse occurs as the price falls.  The price will continue to rise (or fall) until the supply meets the demand.  The fact that the price has continued to rise for a long time says that demand has continually out-scaled supply.
---
To be fair, CCP is partially to blame for that, since they've progressively increased demand by ramping up the number and quality of skins released.  But then, they have a vested interest in increasing the demand for PLEX, since higher demand drives higher prices which drives a higher purchase rate using $$$, meaning more money in their pockets.  And consuming PLEX for skins is particularly lucrative for them, since they don't have to offset that income by granting a "free" subscription.

A WH corp might be worth a try, PH and I'm sure other nullsec groups also do bomber groups for hunting Rorquals.
---
You keep insulting me without reason, is that because you can't argue like an adult, because you are angry about something else or because you are simply that stupid?
---
Typically results from:  
---
1. (player A) shooting (player B) with (ship 1)  
---
2. (player A) leaves by death or warp, and changes to (ship 2)
---
3. (player A) returns to grid with (player B), where (player B) ultimately dies.
---
4. The change in (player A) ship types and items that applied damage to (player B) get mildly jumbled up when the KM is generated.  
---
This is why you'll see things like...

\- Confessors "shooting" Munnin's

\- Frigates "shooting" with oversized guns

The amount of minerals mined has nothing to do with inflation. If anything the buying and selling of minerals and ships is an isk sink. The only impact is newly created isk by insurance, ratting, etc.

But, I love flying them, they’re already super strong, some people just haven’t caught on yet. The rod is gets beat by t2 logi and zarmazd is not worth the price for some unless you fly full trig fleets.

I actually explained why I didn't consider your argument like a valid one on this situation, you didn't seem to like it and you are entitled to do so... after that I'm not really sure why you kept pushing, but at this point I'm just answering you because I notice you are getting angry and it's slightly ammusing.
---
First Entry: **CANDY CRUSH**

Wormhole space uses the Zarmazd a fair bit. And they're great for smaller gang stuff.

i hope we make a lot of isk, explode a lot of things, and all have the best weekend. nice

since they added battleships to alpha accounts you can run incursions.  do that for most isk/h on an alpha.

T2 modules aren't made with predominantly minerals from ore, you'd need an uptick in people doing PI for that. T1 hulls and modules are down in price a bit. For instance Procurers are now around 14mill in Amarr compared to around 17mill (I think) while Dominix hulls have dropped about 50mill. 
---
Quick reply there chief. Keep up the good work
---
I’ve tried that. I got 100million of loot in one of the unguarded sites. But I ran out of probes and had to self destruct(didn’t know about eve scout). I don’t know how common those sites are in W-space. Is it worth looking for more of them. Are they in specific types of wormholes?
---
Link system
---
Nice try. But nope;)
---
The price makes them kinda unattractive for most fleets. The zarmazd is very tanky, but a good fit costs around a bil. Meanwhile, a similar guardian fit costs, at most, 600mil.
---
dunno, thats what im asking , would it work, would it be better or worse, and why. also known as a discussion..
---
Ehen the zarmazd spools up, it can outrep a 5/1 guardian. The ships are unique because of the spool up time, but i would argue that they are already in a good place. They can fit ridiculous tank as wrll. Unique ships fill unique roles.

&gt; The guy who is basically saying "hey guise, just don't let people put more than $100 in there wallet at a time, that will SURE fix inflashun!" is calling me uneducated?
---
Lol give me a break. I am basically offering a way to ban market manipulation of PLEX prices. Market manipulation is banned in real economies. States deal with that by long legal processes and persecution. Since CCP can't do those, the next best thing is limiting how much PLEX people can buy off the ingame market.
---
Some commodities are too important. You can't buy all the oil supply, wheat supply, insulin supply, to sell for twice the money. PLEX is equally important for Eve economy. Meanwhile, the entire inconvenience of doing this is giving up thinking of PLEX as money or an investment tool. Fuck those people making money off this thing anyway. Their activity has no value for Eve's ecosystem.
---
If you can construe that as communism or analogize it by limiting the amount of money you can have, uneducated is the kindest, most respectful adjective you can have. It's more like idiotic, really. 
---
&gt; Sales stimulate the purchasing of plex
---
You don't say? PLEX has risen from 800m to 2.5b in recent years. Market manipulation is far from being the only factor in that increase, but perhaps can account for at least the half of it. Some people have many times of the money that it takes to buy the entire supply of PLEX for an extended period of time. You think they aren't doing that to take advantage of people who can afford 500 PLEX each month?
---
It's also extra funny when I argued CSM is a shit mechanism you imagined me as this democracy hater, and now when I argue PLEX shouldn't be allowed to be manipulated you construe this as communism. I like how I am becoming this boogieman to you lmao. You are a victim of Goon way of rubbing shit all over your ingame enemies and eventually believing all that. Spend so much time on that jabber and this is what happens.

Why? If you stop thinking about PLEX as an investment tool, nothing of value was lost. In my system you can PLEX your acc for however long you want. So you can do that instead of stashing, if you will eventually use your stash for subs.

I think they need more ways to remove ISK from the game, not artificially intervene in PLEX price. The more ISK there is, more inflation. PLEX creates ISK out of nothing and it creates a lot, so they need to control the inflation. The new buy skill mechanic does this f.e.

I got blapped when I tried to PVP, then had a nice conversation with the pilot who got me.  Learned a lot of valuable lessons, then sparred with him through a few more ships.  Learned a lot.  Then he handed me 200m to cover my shitfits.  All around it was lit.

you can still cheese it.

It does matter, because you might as well call every loot drop in the game a loot box if you aren’t talking about direct sales.

Probably because the AI trying to use drones would be like dividing by zero.

I cannot. I already have a full high grade crystal set omega included and then missile application and some other implants that remove any possibility of me using fitting implants

As to the removed video, it's of a player sitting cloaked on grid as PL kills the sotiyo. He uncloaks and steals the blueprint worth 200B+ isk and warps off in his deep space transport.
---
This thread talks about that building, one exists and stainguy was nice enough to provide a roadmap. So if you want to steal 200B isk from someone while they do all the work - this thread is relevant to you.
---
Watch out as the pilots who farm these things (and subsequently lose them to robbery) guard this information and take offense when stainguy brings attention to it as they're really easy to steal.
---
If you fancy yourself an item worth a hundred months of gametime you might want to familiarize yourself and try and rob it. There will be competition as the guy who made that video seemingly took it down when linked so I imagine he'll be on scene trying for another comeuppance.

Hull reps arent meant for active tanking hull HP. Theyre best use is repairing hull damage after a fight using a mobile depot.

Do they need some tweaks? Hell yea. But in no way should they be viable for active tanking hull. We dont really need faction or deadspace versions. Just viable meta/t2 for repping up hull in a relatively short period of time.

If you’re going to be pvping in it and not using to krab, or krabbing in a WH, train for dreads.  
---
Also, train JDC 5. If you ever plan to actually use a cap in pvp, it’s a must have. A lot of people skimp on this to start but don’t, just get it over with and you’ll never have to do it again.

So? Started drinking early, donk?

Wtf is wrong with you? The zaza is an absolute beast, better than t2 and t3 logi on most traits and the rody isn’t even bad. They aren’t even expensive and don’t need bling for fitting, just if you want better performance.

What do you want to happen, npc null is still under the influence of sov null groups, its not like it makes it a free for all.

CCP had to do this by the way because botting level 4 missions was getting to be a bit of a problem. But if you're at that level of Eve then your trial is over and you should omega up anyway.

By looking at the NPCs' killboard on zkill.

I once lost a tengu and a pod full of good implants due to some kinda error when jumping or warping around in losec or something, I dont recall what exactly. I didn't think much of the loss, but some corp-mates said that i should file a ticket because it was a legit game problem. So,I went ahead and filed the ticket.  
---
A week later, I received a message from 'CONCORD RESCUE SERVICE', saying the recovery team had my ship, implants, the whole works "but unfortunately they were unable to recover items stolen by local inhabitants.  
---
CCP went full role-play in their response to my ticket and it was amazing!
---
Well if that stings your butts then he may have a point

How is this eve related? The eve Facebook page is already spammed with ‘rip my dog’ and ‘rip my cat’ every other day. Can we please not turn this subreddit into that? I genuinely hope your cat is okay, however just tired of seeing these.
---
&gt; Any self respecting wormholer has at least two ? 
---
Could you expand on why ? (I'm a new player, I like wormholes, and would have preferred to avoid having two subs)
---
Projecting much?
---
Well thats it rly. The Vedmak is on the powerlevel of a pirate cruiser (maybe a bit higher maybe a bit lower depending on what pirate cruiser you compare it to) the Kiki and Drek well they are beyond the powerlevel of any "normal" destroyer/bc no matter if T1 T2 or T3 (in the Kikis case). And lets not talk about the Damavik. I just don't think putting them in line with the other "normal" factions is quite fitting. I also don't think they will ever be on a similar level as the normal factions but allways a step or two above them (unless CCP nerfs them into the ground and one has no reason to use them anymore).
---
I remember when a shield tanked Arty Myrm was viable in PvE.

What if local hull reps were an out-of-combat passive regen. Like an armor plate but doesn't offer any bonus other than the slow repair of hull over time while not taking fire?

Oh, shit. That's awesome!

Forgot this subreddit was infested with pvp drones, my bad. I'll just link dank killmails and lackluster memes, that way I don't get downvoted by the hivemind of drooling nanogang hunters.

---
Whats with you and metal gear love life?
---
Is this the real translation? Forgive me, but this IS reddit, and the EvE subreddit at that.
---
I guess I'm sort of a remnant from the old times at this point, but I still only have one super per super character, and my super accounts only fly that super 95% of the time. 
---
The real problem in my opinion is that the price for supers is absolutely through the floor. Titans were "cheap" at 100bn for the hull in 2011, back when plexes were 500-600m. Now they're 50bn (or less) and plexes are 2.2bn. So essentially a titan is 8-10 times cheaper right now than they were back in the day. That and with injectors to instantly get your titan pilot instead of spending two years of focused training and it's no wonder they've proliferated they way they have.
---
Monthly reminder:
---
PVP players, these ships are the ones that get the minerals your ships are made from. Blow them up and take the minerals from their smouldering wrecks, cut the middlemen out of the production chain.
---
Miners are very profitable "food"
---
The players could have found a way. When we had the "in stations" bit I know a load of people had their in station TV screen play youtube vids.
---
its not me its him tyvm
---
It's important to remind NSers how safe they got it.
---
Most POSes I see nowdays are just an empty stick with maybe some mods around. There's not much a point of having them anymore other than super storage in space. Even for wormhole evictions etc the upwell structures have very much taken over.
---
Injectors are the biggest problem in the game tbh. Id have no real issue with restricting them to be not usable beyond say 10-15mil SP. 
---
Actually got something for this thread! Shutout to Heaven's Angels, you guys have had such a phenomenal attitude through this op, always staying positive, continuously fighting day after day, and the cap fight last night was epic. You guys are awesome, been a lot of fun playing with/against you!

Can I?
---
Me too. r/modeltrains is recruiting.

Did i say model trains?

I still have an arty shield buffer fit saved named "Better Than a Drake" for shield BC roams which has 75m3 of drones in its bay. I think I owned one beside my Maelstrom which was for Northern Coalition ops fleets.

OMG the A2 pocket was my first home in null when I started playing.
---
How this happened?!? When we lived there we were less than 40 players with a lot of noobs and we were able to beat Darwinism every time with a few ishtars and take almost all their moons in the near lowsec space?!? 
---
It is indeed the real translation :) You can find some more info in the posts after mine in [this thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/arc-semiosis/147507/29?u=kalaratiri). Be aware this is an in-character section of the forums, for roleplaying.  
---
why make a alt reddit account when Stainguy already is your shitpost account? 
---
Skill point farms are fine, as plex prices go up, they become less profitable
---
Hopefully it might be an attempt at reducing some of the caps/supers numbers, something like a supercap/cap wise incursion (thus the cap shipyard in that site). Well, I guess time will tell.
---
True
---
Sabre alt/scout. Aside from ensuring a pod kill, when you're cloaky hunting, and you decloak, there's a targeting delay, so having a sabre for initial tackle is ideal.
---
Having a cloaked pair of eyes to monitor the chain is great as well.
---
 It's not essential but having multiple accounts in jspace increases opportunities for content for you and your corpmates.
---
But the Rodiva?
---
What about the Rodiva?
---
Evidense seems to point otherwise :S
---
In the rooks and kings videos, they mention having two carriers alternating triage cycles so one can push the other to 100% armor and then come out of triage in order for the other to repair it. 
---
Was it just changed from being like subcaps before they added faxes, or am I missing something 
---
Sure
---
are you saying you post here and haven't seen the edgelording shitfest that is xenuria's twitter
---
What do you do in the twelve hours between when your super dies and when it is fully reimbursed if not hop into the backup super in your garage?
---
Also you need to stop paying more than 42.5B for your titans, you don't need super producers getting a big head.
---
Thanks.

Thanks, I was looking for a new wallpaper.

After doomchimps twitter, I decided to steer away from crazy peoples twitters.

Coming from the guys who dropped 3 keepstars in a circle jerk
---
Is it worth now after the balance of haw to get a titan?.
---
I will have a nyx "soon" and i m thinking about the future.  It s a pain in the ass to build a super so it will be 4 times more pain to build a titan.  I dont participate so much in extra big fight (i hated 9-4 for example) with big tidi, lag bug and so on. 
---
For the moment i m happy to drop carrier / dread haw to help a mate (rorqual) that is tackled by a gang and i thought it should be fun to drop the hammer too. But with the change haw will be very nerf.. so is it worth it in consideratio of this gameplay. For me it s looks that with my gameplay it still not be worth the work to have one.

---
don't use an ancillary rep, use a regular one
---
you need armor resists. Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane or Reactive Armor Hardener will help a lot
---
fit a large cap battery instead of 2 mediums, it will save you a mid slot that can be a cap recharger. you may then be able to take off a cap power relay, which saves you a low, which can be a second rep or resist 
---
using Aux Nano Pumps instead of Nanobots will help your cap efficiency a ton
---
use a meta afterburner. Enduring will be cheaper on cap
---
drop the tracking enhancer for another rep or resist mod. tracking enhancers are both 1) not very effective and 2) stack with the tracking computer, making them even less effective. 
---
tldr fix your lows
---
Macharial, favorite ship and a beauty!

You buy them on contracts. Or make your own copies from BPO's. For faction stuff, you get them by killing faction rats.

It got turned into an "Ironic" white supremacist thing on 8chan, that's why "progressive democrats" (read: anyone you don't like who isn't a racist shitheel) have a problem with it.
---
There were people waving around kekistan flags at the white supremacist rally that killed a woman back in 2017 for fucks sake.
---
I see no resistance mods.... no Damage control, nano membrane, or plating. You are trying to tank the full damage of the site, if you have a 50% or 60% resist you take that much less.
---
Also, if you are using it run sites I would not run an ancillary repper, waste money with paste, long reload, or crap rep amount if not loaded. 
---
Try dumping a cap relay and tracking enhancer for a adaptive nano membrane and damage control at least. 
---
Thrasher!

I'm planning to make a bunch of wallpapers over the next month or so, and I'm looking for suggestions on what you'd like to see. But I'm not doing it out of the kindness of my heart. I'm trying out a fancy new Eve art business model ([https://gph.is/2q09JJz](https://gph.is/2q09JJz))

So, for now, enjoy the above wallpaper. Make your requests and I'll post the shiz.

It's actually a part of the AEA5 datasteam:
---
&gt;Advancing-time discourse-element (indecipherable)
---
*reinforce request for countervailing measures to be undertaken*
---
(indecipherable)
---
*continue with surveillance and proceed to next stage within predicted time horizon for effective action*
---
(indecipherable) submit to cladeflow.
---
with the final line being a part of the AFN5 datastream. So while it may look closer to our sentence structure when taken individually, it's actually still a part of their more common dialect. 
---
Heh i was actually laughing that CCP can get ddos due to this kind of approach :D
---
Depends a bit, I usually take my time but can finish a Level 1 or 2 in under 10 mins.
---
Most time it takes to travel to all the resource extraction nodes and i make 8+ mill per site with the occasional spike if something good drops.
---
Only if you have like 10+ of those. It's terrible as a single logistics in gang because of single rep and 6s cycle time on it.
---
Would love to see rep cycle and spool up times halved.
---
Except they don't. The profitability is already 0 on them. The issue is at 5 million SP, you can have a 'free' omega account by simply extracting, and selling off SP. So you have tons and tons of people buying plex to maintain these 'free' accounts, driving up demand.
---
For my first cap o have gone phoenix because caldari lover, mino because caldari lover and for carrier thanny because his bonuses are really good ;p and the chim is so so ugly
---
That's why it looked more normal, it wasn't the whole thing. Thanks for the clarifcation.
---
No more half measures, Tukoss.
---
I was wrong, it's a part of [thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b465qo/svarog_clade_sent_me_a_message_ingame_with_a/ej52yah/).
---
Yes, but you can prepare a whole fleet in the NPC station and use it contest or just to kill people doing them.  
---
If not today then next spawn that will show up in the area ... now have fun doing the same 2-3+ mids into sov space.        
---
Assuming that you just want to dread bomb ... well before you will be able to make 3rd jump due to timers - they will be long gone.       
---
While they are human, they do have a very particular dialect of their own which can be really quite hard to read. An example: 
---
&gt;Paramount Technical Troika of Gromovi Subclade reports outcome of reverse-time studious communion with records drawn through the cladeflow from many cladepylons of the multibody tracking variant. The sense of metaxy from records was resolved without corruption apparent by the noema that vessels under guidance of augmented foreign narodnya accept the aura-field of the cladepylon.
---
Be yourself no matter what others say!
---
Thanks I have been a little confused on the resists things. I have been under the impression that a active armor tank should just heal through but that makes sense. if I take less damage I will heal faster. 
---
contact me in game Shanna Alabel, ill send you some shit. 
---
Yep,
---
Variety Magazine reported that "the $425 million sale is a combination of a $225 million upfront payment and up to $200 million in a deferred performance-based payout."
---
What the target for that payout was and whether it was ever met as never been disclosed as far as I'm aware.
---
Even before that, however, increased revenue = better price, so even without that it was a good incentive.
---
Nothing wrong about it. It’s just a t1 ship with t1 resists though so you can’t get the insane resists of the zaza which is tankwise a better guardian. The rodiva is still point per point better than a solo exeq (which is an extremely strong ship already). Most people will fly the zaza not because the rodiva is bad but because they’d rather maximise what they can get and pay more. When I choose between the zaza and Loki logi before undocking I don’t care about the price but about the links I have or not in the gang. The zaza for example is actually more survivable than the loki and has better range but the loki gives you additional links. I won’t fly a rodiva because I wouldn’t be able to get as much out of it without adding another pilot to the gang. Nevertheless if you buy a rodiva and fly it with your gang it will perform very nicely, close to the performance you would get out of an oneiros.

The truly annoying thing is that the only way you can tell this is really a Pacifier and not a Council Diplomatic Shuttle is that it has a couple of launchers mounted.
---
Contracts in jita are usually best... good competition on them so the price is cheap. Believe my first cap bpc set was like 35-40 mil with 10/20 research. 
---
Sotiyos. 
---
You can build them more easily and more safely - and you don't have issue in storing the hulls. 
---
Imperial Navy Slicer and Sabre PLEASE. By the way that is amazing !
---
Nothing should be able to fit one tank mod (DCU) and have 60% omni resist across the board and rep the same as shield or armor, which usually takes a few mods/rigs to get that on a t1 hull. 
---
R/wallstreetbets
---
Lol. I'll just buy plex from CCP and sell to the people. PLEXTOTHEPEOPLE!
---
Outstanding as always!
---
Sell the hype, buy the fear
---
Look at the juicy prices, I bought a few thousand plex today and sold it just Incase (with irl money) if it goes up more, good, I’ll buy some more. 
---
I got no time for running 10 rorqs or 20 vnis, I get on and blow shit up, or get blown up like in most cases and get off, I play for fun. Really don’t need a second job lol
---
Damn, is this how the economy works
---
I was there today it was totally desert lol
---
It is okayish to have supply in Sotiyos, since once undocked you cannot dock them back or move them and your stash is at risk, if something happens to your Sotiyo.
---
meh we have a megathread for this nonsense already.......
---
ewww, it that veldspar
---
if it gets to high ccp will most likely intervene, so please do buy all the plex, so i can sell mine for good isk
---
rly ccp, give my my 6 turret merlin
---
Just pick a number that is about the base needed for a capital/rorq or something. No idea what that is though :D 
---
Then have it drop off to shit. (tbh not working would make sense too) 
---
Agreed, most of these hardcore Omega vets you typically see on the forums have little understanding of the whole Alpha concept and why it is so important for this game. They think it's just another trial account.
---
I hope whoever wrote Overmind put in a backdoor. Once enough players are using it, activate the backdoor and win. If nobody likes that idea, the developers could just randomly shuffle mechanics to throw the boots off every so often.
---
I think that was the point, to get them to admit that there is a problem?
---
Ask for a hint: which squads/SIGs he was a part of.
---
Nah, I buy subs. An hour of overtime &gt; endless hours of grinding.

ccp wouldnt just seed plex and lose money, most they would do is a sale. They cant force people to sell their stockpiles of plex

It’s almost impossible to cover the entire field of view that reveals where you’re headed/are without obscuring/ruining your stream for others. I say this from experience and viewer feedback about my stream overlay.

Are you the guy who drained the BWF market? Can't build no rifters when pyerite is 6.5 isk per unit.
---
God bless you, sir. Nobody ever requests industrial ships.
---
The problem there is that ccp wants you to use them as they generate revenue, the increased cost of boosters demonstrated that
---
Guess that would be the equivalent of everyone's VNI bots suddenly grouping up and awoxing everything 
---
Contracts on a Wednesday.  At the weekend they tend to dry up so cost goes up Wednesday has been the sweet spot in my experience

Is this the kind of mental damage that getting dropped by endless supply of titans causes?
---
What class Wh sites are you doing. A Harbinger should be able ot do C1 and C2 sites. C2 sites might be a bit more difficult but doable with some warp outs. 
---
Personally, this is the fit i would use 366dps from turrets with Scorch and 313dps peak tank but only 147dps sustained. 
---
This means on harder sites that can do up to 450 dps you will have to warp out but yeh, the harbinger isnt ideal for doing these solo but is a great ship to have as a pair. 
---
As always with Eve, bringing a friend makes it much easier. If you copy and paste this into Pyfa or In game you should just be able to have it up. 
---
Also, check what triggers the next wave and how much tank you need with 
---
https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=WormholeSpaceClass2

Every site will be doable in a Harby but the harder ones you will die if you hit the trigger for the next waves.

---
maybe remove damage caps but instead the more dps on the structure each individual damage gets less effective? example: 5000 dps 100% goes through but at 10000 only 75-80% goes through, so that increasing the dps will kill it faster but you can't just instablap stuff

There's nothing wrong with a player owning as many space ships as he can afford. Only problem is those ships getting too cheap.

This is super fucking cool and I really want to see more of this. I want to see news outlets reporting this and people being immortalized by their contributions to this developing story.

I have yet to see an elaborate, well grounded argument. Your argument is literally to regulate wallet sizes so they can hold less money. And when people note that this argument not only won’t work, it is functionally retarded, you revert to grr goons.
---
Ok. 
---
Quite likely. I know I was one of the 10-15 active skirmish FCs at that time but i wasnt goons. Lyris had another guy that worked with him on some of those marathon siege fleets but I cant remember the guys name because frankly he didnt contribute much.      
---
Actually once it became nothing but siege fleets I stopped being as active FCing for it as it was no longer "fighting" it was just grinding work.

In the comments under the video, there is the script version of the message:
---
*We are Zorya Triglav. We speak for the Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle. We are an emanation of the clades of Perun, Veles, and Svarog. Hear the words of our prayer, and heed them.*
---
*The Ancient Domains beyond the Flow of Vyraj were lost to us. Intruders from the Ancient Domains corrupted the Flow. Intruders seek to corrupt  the Flow of Vyraj and the Domain of Bujan.*
---
*The Ancient Enemy, Azdaja, must be extirpated. The Deviant Automata must confirm or be extirpated. The Corrupted Narodnya must be extirpated. Human-Augmented Narodnya must prove the direction of their Flow. Narodnya moving through the Flow may be fit to enter. Narodnya without fitness will be expelled from the Flow.*
---
*The Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle invoke Cladistic Proving. Glorification of the fit and the mortification of the unfit will unfold in the Flow. Triglav Outside the Struggle will be glorified anew. Nothing can halt the Flow of Vyraj.*
---
*We speak for the Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle.*
---
*We are Zorya Triglav.*
---
I think I have found an alternative, meta meaning of some of these lines, especially in the third paragraph. And speculating is fun anyway, so here I go:
---
"The Flow of Viraj" is basically the playing of the game.
---
The "Deviant Automata" are the bots. There will be some form of test to "confirm" them, if they fail, they will be banned/deleted.
---
"Narodn**a**ya" means people in Russian, and the 2 versions mentioned are "corrupted" and "human-augmented" that must prove something. I think this can be interpreted as actually played accounts (augmented **with** humans), and accounts corrupted by either using some form of input broadcasting or other illegal actions.

"The Ancient Enemy" is actually the 32 bit system CCP is planning to get rid of right now which could be able to detect botting and cheating much more efficiently. Combine this with the last 2 sentences: if you are able to run on 64 bit, you may play, but if you're "not fit" you will be expelled. Notice the word here, it's different than the previously used "extirpate", because there won't be any forced actions against the "unfit". They may return, when they will be able to do it.

Am I overthinking this? Probably, but I had fun putting this together.

Yea, throw in the Proteus to that too, taht's another one that needs a serious buff

I mainly did it because of power grid issue ls but yeh scorch is so good its hard to not use it. Especially if you are doing it solo as you can switch to multifrequency for tracking on frigs.

Exactly what it was. First time using trading websites to find margins.

Looking at current margins you can still turn a profit with +5s

Recall probes before they expire, or when you jump systems mate

Also, for explo, WH is good, NS is good. I haven't tried NS so i can't say.

The WH relic sites you want are in Class 1-3 wormholes. They're pirate sites. Sleeper ones have rats in them.

Problem is, that it's good for you to make it as boring and unengaging as possible for your enemy. More entosis fights are won by burnout than by outmaneuvering the other side.

Saying downvote to prove me right is like having a kick me sign with a note saying if you kick me, I win. You may mentally note that you won in the end, but the kicker doesnt really give a shit.

Citadels were never meant to be a replacement structure for the POS. The fighters can be de-fanged, but not the guns. 
---
However what you're talking about is feature parity that was meant to come for the structures that will eventually replace the POS - those \*STILL\* have no been released, we are still working with POSes for most things. 
---
Yep it s totally dump to say that it is from range
---
That would be hillarious. Over one night all botting space has all citadells and sov reinforced 100s of botting supers dead to the VNI menace. Too bad it will never happen.
---
i hope i can make other capsuleers smile, preferably with happiness as my friends and I delivery a copious amount of dire needed munitions to their hulls as they try and fight off those pesky sleepers  floating through wormhole space under the guise of 'guarding' a relic site, or a combat site.  customers are always in need of torpedo delivery and drone bot party's and nothing will make this delivery agent more happy than to provide the much needed support.  happy friday team!
---
fuck off with your shitty brigade
---
1. Why is this in EVE sub.
---
2. Good choice getting wife to take it, that face says poop in a shoe.
---
3. Why is this not deleted.
---
Can we also talk about why they would change their timers back to EU time zone after losing sov to wormholers in US time?

They also have large stocks of plex from banned RMT &amp; bot accounts. In the past they've used that to intervene in the plex market when it looked like it was spiking too hard. (With the general reasoning that sold plex should be used by players and not just deleted like everything else on banned accounts.)
---
However, that was years ago when they still had an economist on staff.
---
Yet, you posted. Sorry friend.

/tinfoil hat: i think ccp buys out most the plex buy orders, so the $ isk buyers actually get their in-game isk. i can see it now "ccp plexbuyer, do your thing and buy out all those current sale orders please! , keep the money train going"
---
My Nyx has like, 62m.
---
They're at all-5s in anything I could possibly ever use, even links despite not having a links pod, but it's definitely possible to go over 50m if you wanna go all-in.
---
Im looking for a ratting ship that is more active ratting then AFK. I have most t1 ships unlocked and to level 3 except minmatar BC and BS, but I can train into them quickly. Im high level in drone skills, and prefer armor but can use shields too. Im just sick of using the VNI, I want to play eve instead of tab-out of it.
---
are you forgetting Mr Rooks and Kings?
---
I'm going to say the Kikimora
---
&gt; Thanks I have been a little confused on the resists things.
---
50% explosive resistance = you take 50% less damage from explosive
---
Resists are the most powerful defense in the game, they multiply your HP buffer and make reps more effective. If you have 66% resists across the board that means that every 1 HP you repair the enemy has to deal 3.
---
Jesus fuck my eyes. Learn to post.
---
I literally argue you shouldn't think of Plex as money and that's what you take from my argument lol.
---
A worm/Merlin/hawk/harpy would be sweet 
---
It's fine that they own multiple. They will find out how much of a mistake that is when  that keepstar goes pop.
---
I can sort of understand why running an Eve bot would be fun, but here it seems to entirely miss the point doesn't it?
---
And they have gotten too cheap because:  
---
* Producing them has become very easy
---
* Minerals are abundant and easy to obtain
---
* There is fucking room where you can pile them up and sell or provision them
---
* All of the above also causes great demand, which drives prices down.
---
Simple as that
---
The mistake was asset safety.
---
So they go in safety.
---
that's a far stretch.
---
i don't buy an item that's specifically meant to give me a chance to get a item whenever i go ratting. i interact with the game mechanics to make it drop loot to scoop up.
---
with multaplasmids i can go buy 500 plex, sell them, buy the multawhatev and the item i want to enchant. the multawhatev gives me a certain chance to get a specific item. it's like a lootbox but with extra steps.
---
Off the top of my head 
---
* Orca
---
* Machariel
---
* The 3 exhumers
---
* the Amarr Shuttle 
---
* Stratios
---
* Sleipnir
---
* Providence
---
* Sigil
---
* Confessor
---
* (TBH, pretty much anything Amarr, their ships are right on the money for me, aesthetically speaking)
---
increasing the demand for an item does not drive prices down, it in fact does the opposite 
---
as mentioned, active tanking still requires resist mods.  the point is to take less damage for anything, also you're trying to aim for cap stability, so make sure you engineering skills are maxed as well as helping with all your fittings.  your armor skills will need to be trained, to at least lvl 4, 5's of course optimal, 9days ish trng time for each of the resists.  Lastly, please tell me the wormhole you are in, and what highsec you use to get in there.  i can bring in a team of highly dedicated professionals to deliver loads of ammunition to you if needed, we have express delivery directly to your hull! so make sure you have some launchers in your cargo, because you'll probably get lots of missiles instead of lasers crystals. o7 o/
---
The author obfuscated part of the bot code, so there could potentially be all sorts of stuff hidden in it!
---
Nope. Mass quantities. All thought I l did lose 880mil after that. Bought several thousand of items worth that. Undocked from jita, was locked on and killed before I could warp off. Other ships kept colliding against me. I believe it was due to faction warfare. I since have left the caldari navy. Just tryna trade and hang.
---
OK how would fw affect your life in khanid? 
---
Hel
---
Well said, people need to stop being pansies. 
---
You won't manage thousands of alpha alts to store 1000 Plex each so you can have your 5 trillion in plex
---
That is a the most secure way to counter our datamining and I welcome it.
---
Oops, drifters
---
It's more that the true 'players' are building the bots, not just running them.
---
CCP once upon employed a real world economist to monitor the economy in EVE. However in 2014 he left and CCP neglected to fill that void....instead they got some dude to make some pretty looking graphs and show them to us every month...so we can watch month over month and year over year just how fucking terrible the economy has become.  
---
Lol thanks for the advise. Your warning proves that no place is safe 
---
If the total isk in game is growing by 10% or more a month then CCP need to take an urgent sledgehammer nerf to the primary casues.
---
but you have to also consider it has become very easy to store all those items. So suppliers can produce a bigger amount with out fear of having no where to put it if it doesnt sell fast enough
---
Easily one of the best looking ships

Thanks! That's some beautiful art you got there

Is the background on this inspired by the [Star Trek Discovery opening](http://b.cdnv2.artofthetitle.com/assets/sm/upload/ta/te/mi/1r/std_c.jpg)?
---
There isn't really much, epsecially that is going to be more effective then a VNI. A gila or rattlesnake will get slightly better ticks but they are still mostly drone based and you fire off some missiles here and there.
---
At the end of the day ratting is just boring. If you find it boring there isn't likely a ship that's going to make it less boring to you.
---
Instead you could look at running escalation sites, much more active than ratting. Depending where you are in null sec an ishtar can even run the 10/10 maze site so that can be extremely profitable.
---
thank you goons for an awesome fight in Uemon earlier (✿◠‿◠)
---
I said nearly the same thing when I first saw the meta show.
---
Why do we even need to fix this unless they are botting?
---
We still say that to DBRB and nothing improves.
---
‘Inspired by’/‘stolen from’, whatever. Yes, it’s very much riffing on that. But also on this artist called Waseem Marzouki, who I think might have even been an influence on the Discovery titles.
---
Also! I made this like... a week before the Discovery titles were first shown, so there’s *some* originality in there http://corrinmor.com/?p=55459
---
which would increase the supply, which put upward pressure on the price. The point is increasing demand doesn't cause the price to go down
---
OK, so as i don't think I've seen anyone mention it -   
---
the subject "RElSRUNUSVZFIDQ" is a base64 encoded string, and decodes to "DIRECTIVE 4".

are the other mails received by others the same? can they be pieced together if they're different?

It's a nice design, and it looks good.

oh of course not

Yeah nothing like giving the eve client access to more system resources.  What could go wrong?

Hell yeah we did. I joined late but still got 40+ kills including your FC svipul.

It is by far my favorite ship and most flown in Eve.  I don't have trillions of isk to my name, but if you did an orca print I would happily send you a few billion isk

Hordeling detected?
---
I never said I didnt give a shit, I did feel pointing out how dumb that spoiler in your post was after all
---
I like the Typhoon and the Hurricane.  They're the sleekest of the rust bucke...  I mean Minnie ships.
---
I love how horde brings the meat and bones and then nc is there in daws like "we are relevant"
---
Wall of text you have down. Title relevance is one to work on. 
---
Im not sure if i captured the whole essence of what i wanted to say. it is harder for me to explain myself in a foreign language. 
---
The 'profit' you are seeing there is the buy/sell order differences. You would make just as much isk playing the market.
---
Rats use that ship all the time.
---
I could see that opinion, especially if you're used to seeing ships like the Megathron or the Obelisk. Squat, snub-nosed, flying bricks. Stubby bulldogs drifting along. But most ships in the game don't look like that. Even the rest of the Trig line doesn't look like that. They're all elongated, with actual hull geometry. Leshak is about as geometric as the wooden shapes infants used to try and fit into the holes (before we started giving infants iPads to play on).
---
Why are you using gyazo when the images you’ve linked are already publicly hosted by the original creator
---
This is beautiful thanks 
---
Citadels were a mistake
---
Yeah props to you. 
---
That's a good point :) i'm going to include the original link in thread. 
---
I don't see the map changing significantly for a while, NPC null has brought me back to the game, seriously under-rated and appreciated for small to mid groups, just takes some adjusting.
---
There were two bots like this released for Team Fortress Classic back in the day. Both logged their use and sent the WONID (may have been Steam ID, i forget exactly when this happened) and IP back to some central server. A lot of very famous players got banned from competition and any server that chose to enforce the ban list. 
---
It was great. So much drama.
---
100% agree that tack (-) should be included with alphanumeric when it comes to the first 3 identifying tags of a system.... how frustrating is that?  (A recent unnecessary change to the search bar.)
---
you're wrong, for the simple reason that it can fit a scram and smartbombs. Means your logi wing doesn't need to be babysat as much
---
A well thought out post with decent points made, I hope this leads to a reasonable discussion and debate instead of the usual reeee you get on here.
---
I think the main issue with Ansiblex gates is that they are yet another advantage to being a large alliance that can utilise them correctly. The only groups it benefits are the super-alliances like goons, test, PH that really don't need any more help; they already have safe access to ratting and moon mining.
---
I feel like there should be a balance between safe space and content; if you want content then your space has to be less safe, if you want safe space then you should have to endure the "pain" of having to take a few more gates to get to content.
---
I think i flew t1 logi once like two years ago. I am the wrong person to ask about that. 
---
We are so deep into shit that a little change like this won't matter. it was a way to make new players adapt faster to EVE and catch up with other high skilled players. But instead it created something else. In my opinion a downfall in EVE quality.
---
To be honest it will not change too much. Instead of 4-5 super coalitions you will have 6-7 super coalitions.
---
Alliances are grouping becouse it is easier to defend their space. Eve sov is like chess, it's all about strategy. 
---
Weaker alliances after some time will start to merge to others. Then bigger alliances will start forming coalitions. Finally we will achieve same situation, but with 1-2 coalitions more.
---
Jspace is solution for weaker alliances, they can easly control it and it's having relatively good content and isk making opportunities.
---
What's a good way to get into the business track? Is there some automation I could deploy or market principles that I could study to best optimize my chances of making some bank?
---
You have no idea how quickly the jump gates drain ozone even pushing a hand full of Capra through. 
---
Jumpgates are a godsend
---
Make friends if you want sov
---
Actually i do. i use them daily. 
---
all of them? 
---
Wouldn't having more coalitions still be a benefit? More conflict is always a good thing in Eve.
---
Hey man, 
---
For me the Abaddon is a thing of beauty even though it's not that useful these days. Something epic with that ship would be awesome.
---
Remember that Volume traded does not equal volume purchased from CCP. As seen in the comment below, some guy just put 577,000 plex onto the market himself, which is 1/3 of the daily volume. In fact, as the price is fluctuating and rising so much lately the volume that is traded increases as more people reach their offload price and more people buy to invest in the quick price rise.
---
it's a lot for one day. Idk who else could tbh besides the folks who own perimeter. Yeah I am in subs I could do dreads but I rather mjd when i see a sig since every1 else can. 
---
Exactly my point. if you want to be an independent entity there is not place for you in sov nullsec. 
---
It’s not so much about expense as it is the logistics behind refueling far flung networks. 
---
Even before CCP changed them at release to not allow super capitals the sheer logistics requirement for fueling them to allow a supercap fleet through was in the hundreds of freighter loads IIRC from discussions with people that crunched the numbers. 
---
Wild, there are guys who play on the test server like a regular game?
---
Npc nullsec or lowsec
---
No structures needed
---
Nor assets in space at risk
---
Able to grow until you can carve out space
---
This is how banderlogs in pure blind have done it
---
They lived out of npc for a long time and when the opportunity came about they leveraged their influence and capabilities to take sov.
---
With the resource abundance today it will considerably out weight the benefits of moving fleets with ease trough Ansiblex and cut corners then consider some LO cost. I understand refueling them might be a struggle inside the space of alliance that have thousands of players but tbh it should be.  
---
i would remove DED sites from NULL sov and make them npc only...infinite anoms are enough for f1 monkeys
---
This is straight up just not true.
---
While im also thinking about some isk advantages to buff NPC nullsec im not sure if its enough. Pirate lvl 4 missions and explorations are a decent source of income. But still it makes it deserted. But yeah i would love your suggestion. Anything like this to see from CCP that they care about small groups and NPC space would be great.
---
Done an Apoc yet?
---
When I first started I thought that after every 5m sp, injectors would give 100k sp less. 
---
I feel that would be a decent change for the better as well. It lets new players inject and let alts somewhat train into caps. 
---
That would be nice, shoot out the offensive modules on a citadel, two timers like a POS tower, maybe 3 for keepstars because "they're special"
---
Pure blind is the only medium scale alliance lvl conflict in EVE atm. And it is only so because none of the big alliances care about it. But even that conflict has been altered multiple times by bigger groups because of the slow limitations of movement across eve. 
---
The clarification I want is when we stop allowing Nullsec Carebears who only care about endless botting and ratting to shape the conversations with CCP.
---
The one change that would instantly change the dynamics of nullsec is delayed local
---
1.0 - Instant show up in Local Chat
---
0.7 - 0.9 = 10 second delay
---
0.4 - 0.6 = 20 second delay
---
0.1 - 0.3 = 30 second delay
---
0.0 - =  45 second delay
---
All the way down to 1.5 minute delay
---
Goodbye botters,  goodbye align-out miners with no risk,  hello fun. 
---
Ask ccp for abyssal sovspace if you want instanced sov
---
vOv
---
I think I like the ring of "anal interdictor" better than anal Sabre, but otherwise spot on.
---
I'm so glad we headshot their FC. If we hadn't, their fleet would've still been out doing things instead of just standing down. No one wanted that.
---
Developing an Eve bot would be fun. I don't see how anyone gets enjoyment from sitting there and watching a bot do its thing. Surely just playing the game is more entertaining?
---
That's what people do on reddit though eh?  Sort of like eve, don't fly what you can't afford to lose, and on reddit don't post what you don't want people to see.
---
[Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8q8PXoJwVk)

when was the last npc-null related update?

y
---
No idea tbh.

Do you guys think this game is going to die soon? According to SteamDB there's around 4k people online right now - considering how big this game is, I'd consider that pretty damn dead. Thoughts?
---
1.  Clearly stated, he is my co-captain.  First officer for all ships.
---
2.   I would rather have done it but I am shift-worker and was stuck at work.  Glad she did and it seemed to go well.
---
3. Please stop posting.
---
It is Eve related because he is the first officer of all my ships, and spokesmodel for my crews.
---
Injectors are a necessary evil if this game ever wants to continue to attract new players.
---
nice but all we care about am the new Triglavian supers, l'm err  were counting on you to find out all the info
---
Plus you have have my vote on you taking over CCP Guard ;P
---
Oh, but it is. Sorry if your bubble has been burst. On the test ones that effect accuracy they are stupid easy, and many there are no transits.
---
Pretty sure it’s tagged as ‘Video Games’
---
&gt; you should have to endure the "pain" of having to take a few more gates to get to content.
---
I'm glad you're not in charge of balancing this space game.
---
You sick gimp fuck you, what with those spiked heels stabbed into your junk and red ball gag muffling your shouts. Not to kink shame but I don't want to have pain and shitty ordeals be any more of a balancing game factor.
---
Without gates you're killing subcapital content; like those supergroups traveling to eachother to feed/play/create battle reports and good times, as well as the opportunity for others to third party. All because you think it's unfair to have a content super-highway being a reason to hold sov, in a game where historically having less reason to hold sov is bad.
---
Those fights can cause escalations, can cause articles and can promote advertisement. Making it harder to get into fights for large swaths of the game is not an improvement. The idea that it's unfair because not EVERYONE gets it handed to them is a little alarming.
---
You're talking about adding 15-30 potential minutes to a game session under the guise that it's unfair pandemic, the busy bees dinos etc. have you found success in sovereignty and alliance building. Are you part of a sleeper cell trying to terrorize eve?
---
Agreed
---
It literally doesn't though.   
---
\- is negotiable but having a floor on the number of characters permitted is a major performance thing.
---
Something CCP should consider is making it so that if you enter fewer than 3 characters, it should perform a system search ONLY, and not the far more useless character/corp searches, etc
---
Wouldnt trust steam numbers. Most people avoid playing EVE through steam and people on this sub advise to not to link steam at all
---
Oh - is there an actual player count then? I guess it's much more than 4k?
---
some if it is just russian too
---
narodnya is russian for "people" according to google translate, so i'd guess augmented foreign narodnya are just capsuleers
---
The EVE launcher displays current online players. Its around 40k usually.
---
He’s in catch 
---
Oh damn, far from dead then - thanks!

You know we don't care about your cat right?

Youre welcome

Wow, nice!

"Banderlogs".... "influence and capabilities"... does not compute.

Lol. 
---
Doesn't matter what fucking system is in place. Null doesn't change because players in Null don't want it to....and I don't mean your average F1 Reddit shit heel. I mean the guys running the Null blocs.  
---
They are in cahoots to keep rental ticks running, and the ISK for the RMT machines flowing. Be they legit Cashout functions (INN and its affiliated shit for example) or illegitimate outs (Like UAxDeaths historical association with Moolah for ISK shenanigans.)  
---
Its not the system...its the people. Always has been, always will be.  
---
You realize the same people running Null Powerblocs today, are the same ones who were back in like 2005 right....nothing has changed except the colour on the map, and maybe some of the big bold names.
---
I'm looking forward to flying new triglavian ships with all of you space friends! :)
---
Cool hat. 
---
I will be entirely dissapointed if your Brutix is not called Brutus... 
---
Well, I appreciate the passion behind your post.
---
In response I'd suggest that "pain" has always been a balance factor in Eve in one form or another. More expensive ships are often better, but you have the pain of grinding more isk for them. Structures are painful to bash. Wormholes are painful to scan down and track, and yes, travelling and hauling cargo around Eve takes painful amounts of time.
---
This doesn't make it a bad thing. There has to be limits in some cases, and making things annoying unless there's a good reason for doing them is sometimes the best way to balance things. 
---
Otherwise we might as well make all ships free, all systems one jump away from each other and all wormholes not need scanning down, eh?
---
But j would also say that (and this is slightly off-topic but tangentially related) alliances need an incentive to spread out their players more, and use the space they hold. This in itself will cause more conflict to arise, and perhaps you wouldn't have to travel through 15 dead systems under your own control to get to somewhere with content.
---
Lol autocorrect
---
I will name it Brutus the Brutix
---
Right ?!?
---
Good! You can't take the Brutic into Abyssals though. Cruisers only unless the Frigate Abyssals. Not including T3s. 
---
Okay so that's pretty awesome but we're gonna need a banana for scale or something...
---
How many "real" conflicts do you see in EVE sov nullsec today? I will answer that for you. None. You can sit in your corners with your titans and supers for years to come while game has no meaningful essence for so many that don't want to be part of big clusterfuck coalitions. The game has 3000 titans that can bridge you already you don't need Ansiblex Gates to reach 5 regions away to third party 50 vs 50 fight with 200 man fleet. You are the terrorist. And i am also happy you are not in charge of balancing this space game. 
---
if youd make me a dramiel one with the sariels flames skin id love you forever
---
Where do you live that you refer to GE- as GE. or TVN as TV. MSHD as MS, DK0 as DK, etc?
---
All the t3ds and triglavian ships are new models (and even new weapons for trig stuff), plus the force auxiliaries. Depending on if you were around for the new t1 destroyers those are new hulls too, along with the attack bcs.  Mordus legion ships are new models, as well as the soct ships and soe ships. 
---
too bad cormack only undocks to shoot at dreads that are in hull :|

Anything’s a dildo if you’re brave enough. 
---
lot of it is just ccp borrowing bots to throw in some russian words, fits with most of the lore being pulled from slavic religion
---
Rogue automata must conform or be extirpated.
---
You can't range tank Sleepers. They're fast, long-ranged, and pack a lot of webs. You need a damage control, at least 60-70% resists, and two reppers or you'll get gob-smacked in thirty seconds. Get rid of the tracking mods, you'll be able to hit everything just fine without them. Use a large cap battery instead of two mediums, add cap rechargers if you have space, and use aux nano pumps instead of nanobot accelerators. Also use pulse lasers, they have better tracking and still have decent range when loaded with radio.
---
I agree with the npc null local idea. NPC null not having local would be amazing.
---
I think the role of them has to change to reflect their ubiquity in today's Eve.
---
There's no issue with there being millions of frigates in the game as their have their niche and place in the meta. They can be effective, but they have counters. The issue with supers and titans is that they are still apex ship classes in a game that should be asymmetrically balanced. They need updating to have a better natural predator of them.
---
Fraternity is independent, and showed up just a few years ago. GalMil got bored of FW and took space in cloud ring. Both of them were *talking* to other alliances, but not subservient.
---
Cherry-picking the times just after massive turnovers, when large alliances or blocs got removed from null, is a shit argument. The map always looks diverse when that happens, including in the days before jump fatigue when we had two bridges in every system.
---
Have you actually *tried* to do anything, or are you just sitting on your ass complaining because it looks hard?
---
We finally found it; a game that is more neckbeard than eve
---
&gt; Otherwise we might as well make all ships free, all systems one jump away
---
 Might as well just all be gay, that way we don't need chicks anymore. Seems like sounds reasoning.
---
ansiblex replaced jump bridges; the op failed to mention that during that entire time and for every sov update he posted - jump bridges were in game helping to facilitate engagements. The removal of these structures would hurt the game. You'd still have jump capable ships to be a reason to truce/blue up and ally and batphone, you would just end many would-be subcapital engagements. 
---
They are stupid easy, but if all you do is hit no transit, you don't hit max level. You actually have to CLICK the "easy" ones. So your statement "folks are hitting max level just hitting no transit" is false. Sorry if your bubble has been burst.
---
Make sure it has a dagger 
---
FRT is not independant. It has agreement all over eve. And yes i'm very active in playing EVE. I created an alliance and been FC'ing for last 5-6 years at least couple of times a week. I create content for people and do my best to be quality. In last 3 years i have been part of bigger alliance, CO2, TRI, but my heart will always be in small or medium size warfare. And here i am bringing discussions about it on this forum that i know is mostly populated by people who will hate it and criticize it. So yes, i'm trying and will try in the future and i don't sit on my ass complaining because it look hard. 
---
Thanks. Turns out we were in a c3 so going to start with a c1 thanks for the tips it’s nice that you took the time to help me out. 
---
Honestly getting to smart bomb ecm drones is a godsend
---
I'd love to see a golem in bastion. I know it's not a super popular ship nowadays but goddamn if it isn't badass looking especially when it goes beast mode. 
---
Edit, btw great work. Love this kind of stuff. 
---
Realistically, the only principle you need to know is "buy low, sell high". 
---
The rest of it comes from getting familiar with individual markets: item X sells for higher in Region1 than Region2, but less frequently, so is it worth investing there, or even transporting from 2 to 1 for resale? item Y sells for a great profit margin and is always in high demand, but how many other players are there competing for sales, and are you going to be on enough to keep your orders from being undercut too much? item Z is great, but it's mostly used with a fit that's getting needed next patch, so do you dump stock or bank on it still being competitive? etc.
---
Pick something you're familiar with from your own playstyle - mining ships, ammo, blueprints, whatever - and monitor the market for these things for a bit before selecting a handful of items to invest in. Don't overcommit until you're getting a reliable return in your investment, and once you've got yourself a market cornered, you can extend your scope using the same tactics.
---
You may have caught me talking out of my ass. I didn't finish training caps until after the fax conversion.
---
&gt; Might as well just all be gay, that way we don't need chicks anymore. Seems like sound reasoning.
---
Not really sure what this means in relation to what were discussing.
---
I'm not convinced that removal of jump bridges would hurt the game, and iirc jump bridges at least gave jump fatigue, and were much easier to camp. If small alliances can do without them currently, I'd imagine that the ultra large alliances should be fine as well.
---
Asset safety... 
---
Have an upvote for the typo. 
---
Once drank a little too much and called a bustard a bustadon (totally serious) on comms (trying to combine bustard and mastadon for some reason). It was a meme for weeks to come and this reminded me of it. 
---
Are there large corporations that act as a place for players new to J-space to get on their feet, in the same way that the null blocs do so for brand new players coming to null-sec?
---
Just a basic idea:
---
Increase jump timer, change jump calibration to reduce fatigue by 10 percent per level up to 50 percent at jump Cal 5 making it less of an absolute critical skill For fleets and useful for subcaps. Make ansiblex gates have fatigue but give a 50 percent reduction that stacks with other reductions (jump Cal 5 being 50 percent reduction of that 50 percent reduction for 75 percent)
---
Make a new skill if not using jump calibration.
---
Allow ansiblex gates to be hacked allowing a successful hacker the ability to temporarily change access status to allow all or allow none. Have it reset to normal after a time limit of say 2-5 minutes and under allow all have it reset after both max number of uses (say 20) or a max fuel usage (enough for about 3 BS). This should be one of the harder hacks in the game. It would only effect the gate you are currently hacking it would not change permissions for the connected gate.
---
This would allow hacking to slow fleets, set traps, or move a small fleet into enemy space. It would also feel more like what I imagined hacking to be before I started Eve. Currently hacking is just salvaging by a different name.
---
Nice shoe!
---
This portion of the talk from Eve Vegas might help in terms of DPS vs tank:
---
https://youtu.be/Au4rMBjVSZ0?t=2202
---
Main thing is, bad luck might mean you die even with the best fit, so go into it expecting to lose the ship (and your pod, so jump clone out of those swanky implants!), and be ready to just fit up another and dive back in. Don't be shy of starting at T1 and moving up, there's no rule that says you need to jump right into T5. And always remember you can give it a shot on SiSi first to test your fit without risking losing anything too blingy.
---
&gt; Otherwise we might as well make all ships free, all systems one jump away from each other and all wormholes not need scanning down, eh?
---
How do I make this my signature, reddit is so devoid of features.
---
They need to nerf injectors so that they don't work on certain skills. Capital skills to be specific. 
---
I get shat by the nullbear half of this subreddit whenever I voice that [the imbalance of the supercap umbrella](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b31zcn/some_issues_discussed_in_csm_minutes/) is a bigger problem than any capital attributes you might fix. Until you fix the umbrella, every nerf to capitals is another reason for someone to move under a big one.
---
Those who can actually read the ecosystem without their nullbear interests in mind should keep voicing this issue. And maybe in 3 years we can get CCP to fix it.
---
No problem! I recommend checking out [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#) guide. It's the ultimate source of information on Sleepers.
---
I have no idea I'm afraid, I guess Google it or something? 
---
Imagine over 100 golden beams tearing the ore out of the belt, such that lit up the sky in a blaze of mining :-).
---
&gt;unless it's a three letter system then the tack. 
---
I don't know about you but if it's a well enough known system in the space we like in I'll also only use the first two letters. For instance A1-AUH is just A1 
---
I would really love to see a SARO 'Black Troop' skinned Marshal wallpaper. :)
---
Hel, Providence
---
You aren't paying much attention to what is going on in Eve do you?
---
That looks amazing dude! Make sure to show it off tomorrow! :D
---
Asset safety shouldn't exist outside of highsec, if at all. There's no point in bashing a structure to get zero/near-zero loot.
---
Not to be a smart-ass, but whatever fit works best for what you are doing.  Do you want max runaway potential? Do you want pvp capability? Are you in HS, LS, NS, Jspace? What are your skills? 
---
it's no longer friday here, but i'll be going to evesterdam when i wake up, i'm so excited (✿◠‿◠)
---
I suck at PvP so not that. I usually go to Null for Exploration, so I guess max runaway potential?
---
Drink coasters are holding up the back.  Pretty standard size the world over, roughly 3 to 3.5 inches a side. Model is likely 12-15 inches then
---
Ok good point.
---
Acknowledged. Who is to say that D-scan isn't based off some (insert Syfy made-up stuff) tech that gathers data FTL?
---
Lol. Ideally D-scan could be based off RADAR principals with strength falling off proportional to 1/r^2, each ship having a radar cross section, each ship transmitting at specific frequency, ships with low Doppler hiding in the clutter of asteroid belts, ships hiding their transmissions by using the noise of spatial anomalies, etc.
---
But ya know that would require a lot of work ;-)
---
No. Next question please 
---
There are exactly no meaningful conflict in eve right now. Geminate area is very busy yes but it's only fleet action. South has nothing real yet. Pure blind has some action and thats about it. Feels dead to me mate.
---
I absolutely agree here - I'm surprised this is so overlooked. Previously you could only build one super at a time in a POS, so if you want to do a bunch of builds - you need a bunch of POS. POS could be destroyed pretty easily so it was all hush hush secrecy when people were doing builds.
---
Now you can throw a few Sotiyos around and build as many supers/titans as you want - only having to worry about the index cost. This greatly accelerated peoples abilities to build supers, tack on massive mineral gathering via Rorquals and it's a recipe for supercapital proliferation.
---
Gates inning out of LO is a minor inconvenience only. No significant alliance finds LO costs any real impediment to ansiblex use.
---
They used to have way less ehp and also faxes use to not exist. Also no haw guns. Hopefully something is changed.
---
Feature thats been asked for since before a number of EVE players were born
---
Answer: no
---
Indeed, I wrote a post last week on my thoughts on capital balance which was heavily downvoted but I think most people can agree that a change of some type is required.
---
Hot. Fucking. Damn
---
We were told flat-out in CSM8 five years ago that this is *way* harder than it sounds, and given that it was *Veritas* who said it, I believed him.
---
Not NDA. I made sure that exchange made it into the Summit Minutes.
---
I dunno how to format it properly, but take your factions T1 exploration frigate (Magnate, Heron, Immicus, Probe):
---
High slots
---
-Probe Scanner with probes (INCLUDING SPARE PROBES for the love of god, remember spare probes)
---
Mid slots
---
Relic Scanner I
---
Data Scanner I
---
Scan Rangefinding Array I
---
5MN Microwarpdrive I
---
Low slots:
---
Nanofibre internal structure I
---
Inertial Stabilisers I
---
You could also swap one of the inertial stabilisers for a warp core stabiliser to help with scrams
---
Rigs:
---
Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I
---
TLDR:
---
If your starting out, keep it cheap and keep it fast
---
357 games on steam. Not 1 like eve. You wont be missed.
---
&gt; DBRB
---
&gt;
---
&gt; nothing improves.
---
checks out
---
I’m not necessarily starting out- I’ve played for 6 months to a year before I took a break, and I some of the best stuff I have is a ratting Myrmidon and an Astero in storage, so... yeah... I have maybe 200 million liquid ISK. I just wanted to ft up the Astero I guess since iirc I hear it’s the best
---
There's a major problem with your argument here. 
---
[Here's your picture not the size of a post it note because you used a shit image host.](https://i.imgur.com/IgL9s2R.png)
---
[And here's the map from the 12th of november, the day before Onslaught was released.](https://i.imgur.com/OzyZnVj.png)
---
[And for good measure here's a map from early may before the Ansiblex was even datamined.](https://i.imgur.com/5lGQAs9.png)
---
If Ansiblex jump gates were really the cancer killing eve and the thing that enabled these super empires to exist, should the map not look different from before they were even announced? 
---
Or are you just buttmad because someone used an ansiblex in their space to get in front of your gang and spank you for roaming in their space?
---
Damn 4d chess.
---
Ah okay, I mean, the same style of fit will work for an astero. Except you NEED a Covert-ops cloaking device in a high slot.
---
I generally run with the mantra of "If I am scrammed I am dead" so I don't bother fitting any tank, just stuff to make me speedier and harder to tackle
---
Well fuck I can’t fit a cloak :/
---
Ansiblex are fairly recent. Only few months. I am not saying they are cancer. But they will give alliances an extra tool to travel all over the place with no restrictions. And future of nullsec will be stagnant because of it. I think you missed my point in this post.
---
Yeah, your main tool to not die a horrible death is the use of a cloaking device. You can still carry out the exploration but it will be more dangerous.
---
For example, if you see someone warping into your site you are doing, you can just cloak up and burn away from the site. If you can't use a cloak it might be better off sticking with the T1 faction frigates until you can fit one, then move up to the astero
