I don't really understand why we have to pay you for PvP, did the new patch mention that?
---
GR CCPEE
---
wat
---
Plex sales aren't microtransactions.
---
  Selling gold ammo/ships for $$$$ is. Which isn't a thing.
---
Null is intended for anyone with the balls to be out here, That's the whole point of having a sandbox game that isn't level locked like a typical MMO.
---
no one said it was designed to cater to them, you said " Nullseccers are not newbros " That statement by you is FALSE, because there are in fact new players in nullsec.
---
don't give 'em ideas...
---
I mean, if you want an honest answer, and not to just meme around or whatever: CCP can do a fine, honest job of collecting data and presenting the results.  I don't doubt their ability to collect some metric and present it.
---
They have, however, in the past, chosen some wildly inappropriate metrics to serve the point they were trying to make (i.e., battleship balance).
---
Like, CCP may in fact be seeing info here that is super good news.  Cool + good.
---
But I'm gonna keep the same attitude I had about the Brisc situation for now.
---
&gt; Yes, make the game completely unpredictable and remove all continuity
---
  That was eve when it was brand new- people had to figure out their own ship fittings, how to run missions, what hulls to use for what purpose, there weren't even dedicated comms or logi wings at the time- It was chaotic. 
---
  17 years later people have Math-Fu'd their way into perfection, which has led to stagnation and the same 2 fleets clashing day after day (munins and eagles).
---
Im? how do you know? ohh   forgot that this is internet and we all know everything =P
---
DING
---
Privateer was as bad as PIRAT- All they did was hug the 4-4 undock and hide whenever someone with teeth fired back.
---
They can mine, just not as effectively as a vet. mission running in highsec is where a large number of new players in this game wind up quitting because they never see anything more to the game and give up because its poorly designed and boring as fuck. Getting these people into null and lowsec and maybe eventually WH space is the best way to keep them playing, because there is actually something to do there.
---
Smh
---
Well nullsec is in a blackout, so there is that already.
---
More like oh no we're switching from soccer to baseball halfway through the game.
---
Nice
---
I'm a simple man, I see provibloc machs eat shit and I upvote.
---
No gate'ing. The hunter just logs of/logs in in a system and looks for a krabs there. 
---
Subcaps don't have ehp to survive long enough for cavalry to come. Domis and Rattlesnakes sometimes fit a cyno because they aren't that much speed reliant as VNIs. But they don't have survive long in fights vs bombers.
---
And yes, jackdaws are very efficient at killing frigate sized ship. Problem is; how do you get the jackdaw fleet to the tackled krab in less than 30s? Because that could be time between lighting a cyno and krab dying. It's not enough to respond to a it, simply because subcaps don't have them buffer that caps have.
---
Pot, kettle.
---
Yes, nullseccers are not newbros.
---
Again. Carebears. No-one should care.
---
What like anom rat?
---
Right!? OP is retarded or something
---
it just help real ppl to less click and preventing carpal tunnel. bots do not care about numbers of click or so...
---
Also no reload
---
is that legal?
---
My brother tried to play and even with a seasoned bittervet like me teaching him everything he became overwhelmed and quit. I think it's extremely detailed and trying to learn too much at once can be a bit much, just take it slow
---
Thats the thing xD I. Not even sure what to commit to. I like blowing things up I guess.
---
They excluded the people who only logged in for the skill ponints. I'm assuming they have a metric of time logged in and activities done. Like if you log in for the 20 minutes to do skills and then logged off, including the shooting of snow npc, you get excluded.
---
Wh space for the win
---
Yeah just bear in mind it takes years to fully even understand the game. Just take it slow
---
I'll try. Thanks for the hint
---
Thanks I'll take a look
---
i heard inflatable titans :)
---
well what do you propose they do in highsec that's so much more engaging then joining a nullsec group and learning to PVP? Get ganked by PIRAT or CODE? Run missions till they quit cause its boring? Mine in a venture till they do the math and realize they are spending hours a day to mine 2$ worth of ISK? At least in nullsec they can undock and find a fight within minutes without needing to duck the overly complicated rules of highsec pvp, the exploration is much better in null, there's plenty of people for them to salvage behind. Why are you arguing that new players should live in the shittiest most boring area of the game?
---
Nope, lots of groups take in day-1 newbros, you can shop around on /r/evejobs
---
Question: Now that we have the blackout, why not remove clocking devices to? that will make it more dangerous for all isnt?
---
Why do all these keyboard warriors want to see everything burn in null since the blackout and are demanding every 5 minutes a new super structure that will kill the banance in this game...
---
False.
---
Lol just watch videos on it tbh man. There's a reason why the meme "CCP: here's a ship fuck you" exists
---
Are you new?
---
Well it is CCP after all:)
---
Loki #1
---
I'm not going to argue that we've abused the changes to give us the most advantage or anything. I'm just pointing out that CCP basically blaming the players for the state of the game is massively ironic. There original idea for citadel reinforcement was to entosis it. Luckily they were forced to walk that back.  
---
&gt; Rorquals. But Rorquals are really a complicated thing as they also provide content. What should have been done here was nerfing the umbrella.
---
This seems odd to me, was there even a supercap umbrella when rorquals came out? I thought their ability to mine so much was what led to everyone having a super and the invention of the umbrella itself.
---
Legion brings a full rack of HAMs, full flight of medium drones, three medium neuts, and a respectable tank that can be done for T2 cheap. If you're going to bling, Loki or Tengu.
---
Regarding the usefulness of newbros, this is what they actually said - and your last dot point is absolutely right.
---
"So now it's the individual new player that has to, uh, try to get into the big organizations instead of the other way around. Back in the day, we used to compete for new players because they had such a high value. And I'm just thinking back when we were struggle, but when the game was really growing because new players had an actual value. "
---
My god. It's like they didn't notice what led up to UALX and everything that happened after it. We are in an era where Pandemic Horde is the dominant force in the Northern Coalition, and where the Goons stopped recruitment scamming because it was interfering with their ability to recruit new members.
---
If you are a new player you can literally walk into any of the nullblocs. Before Brave and Catch 1.0, that was an impossibility.
---
So that's why you at up bait and get lots of fun and easy kills
---
that's dumb, he's in lowsec, the bottleneck is gonna be pilots not cost and actually needs to survive on field. Will most likely be slaved armor revs
---
Keep telling yourself that as the sandbox is crumbling down
---
Yes, jackdaws can get there and kill the stealth bombers. Use a bait.
---
Hmm in all honesty, I dont know. I have been wondering about it and came to the conclusion that since its called a daily login campaign that some form of login actually occurs when you click that play thingy. But I mean, its yet another thing we cant say for certain.
---
I would love for some real data from CCP on this event in general so we dont have to guess as much.
---
They have plenty of supers and caps, they just refuse to use them.
---
Which fucking balance lmao
---
Less bots and more logins.
---
Look into abyssals, they are alot of fun and profitable.
---
You can perform UAT in Production. Not every environment has Test or Dev
---
At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this sub is now dumber for reading it. I award you no points.
---
Eve is stagnating and hit its prime years ago. If anything, it needs to go backwards.
---
Nice contradiction 0.0 with local is safer than highsec if you know what you are doing
---
Dang you beat me to it. And this apparently “wooshed” by OP.
---
Lol that isnt the mob mentality on this sub. You cant say the spike that happens with this change will stick. It's new and a change, but you wont know if it actually fixed anything until at least 3 months
---
lemme guess how many rorquals this pussy has
---
&gt;Falcon  
---
&gt; \- the map needs a huge shakeup, we need to create conflict, people have built their sandcastles, now they need to fight for them.
---
Yep, that should be the main objective. Shake up is good, now give the reason for all null sec alliances to fight.
---
Yyyeeeeeesssss
---
future shit
---
https://i.imgur.com/5Rskr11.png
---
Only if the structure is dead.
---
Its almost like deadzones never happened lol. Right now you can fucking store stuff in enemy citadels and asset safety them to lowsec, and you compare that to losing a station and all access to it unless u had a jc
---
I'm trying to say if you spend all your time in your umbrella because PVP outside of your 100 man fleet is silly you're a fucking retard, and if you can't see that you're probably a fucking retard.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
He is and you are his mom
---
If high sec systems randomly shift to null sec with no warning, I'd fucking buy that for a dollar.
---
If that is the case it is because of player action, not game mechanics.
---
There is no proof of that, otherwise you are saying CCP has allowed those bots to play.
---
We don't tell people why they were rejected specifically so they can't game the system and try to hide the thing they got rejected for.
---
It's design intent: Imagine if I told you how to defeat our checks and you were a spy, you could tell all your spy friends and everyone would know how to defeat the check.
---
This should all go without saying, but here I am, saying it.
---
Yah
---
Honestly they claim this doesnt taint the data but wait until the bullshit 2 week event is over. I'm already watching daily numbers decrease.
---
Bridge what gap?
---
Honestly, the bullet points will suffice, but it's worth the listen.
---
You on a crusade to comment on everyone's response? Seems spammy
---
The blackout was one of the experiments we get to see. I really want to know what they've been doing in the Asian beta
---
There is one minor issue with all this. The bots are back. EVE is about learning to adapt and that goes for the makers of botting software.   
---
It seems to have takein them little over two weeks to figure out how to get around it. Been running into large automated fleets up in the northern regions that warp off and back with uber speed. Now just takes more time to figure out where they are warping to.   
---
Price of PLEX is not a simple thing to figure out. Many have large stockpiles working on the concept of PLEX only goes up, but when it doesn't I figure the "investors" get scared and try to take profit.   
---
New subscriber  numbers are down. Average players per week is down (US Tz seems to have lost the most [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) Look at 2 months). If many players leave so demand for PLEX fell? 
---
CCP want to shake up EVE and seem to be doing a good job. Hope they don't shake away to many more players.
---
I don't even think it's just going to be resource depletion, it sounds like systems may be shook.
---
In may they were giving out 1m250k sp, considering how they offer much less now and during blackout they have those activity stats that makes your argument obsolete.
---
Until they go to dotlan and see that rats are dying in that system.
---
He isn't edgy, he likes EVE the way it was originally intended as opposed to the Empire building simulator it has become. Go play Stellaris or something v0v
---
Comments TLDR: high sec poors who don't have a super thinking CCP will nerf supers.
---
You're not a new player you aint fooling anyone. You are nothing more than part of the r/eve special interest group promoting this snowflake generation illness that's running rampant. You are one of the old poor's that never made it to richs when many others siezed the moment and sour as shit about it. You want the successful ones brought down to your level so you don't have to work hard to get where we are.
---
They clearly stated they are anti alt. They want alts to be less valuable than an equal number of real people playing making the game harder to multi box
---
&gt;limit structure capacity, if it blows up its gone, no more asset safety...  
---
&gt;Fantastic, it'll never happen.
---
I would add to this to also do something different in the game. Change up the path you're on. With a new toon for a fresh start, and try not to fall into the habits you have with your current character.
---
&gt; This seems odd to me, was there even a supercap umbrella when rorquals came out? I thought their ability to mine so much was what led to everyone having a super and the invention of the umbrella itself.
---
Yes there were umbrellas before Rorquals. But Rorquals interacted with them. Rorquals were dying at sufficient rates until people proliferated enough FAXes. So you are right in that sense.
---
Basically, umbrella mechanics always existed, but they didn't become as severe problems until proliferation and injectors. After that, they needed adjustments. Adjustments never came.
---
Do you also love the idea of having artificially imposed limits and fuel cost on items you own? What happens when you want to take a break from this game? All your shit is gone?
---
Thanks I'll take a look tomorrow. I'm off for the night.
---
I see a lot of comments where people are mentioning that CCP can simply sift through the data to determine who is logging on just to claim SP and log off / shoot a rat and log off / or actually playing...  
---
CCP can't even tell who is ratting 23/7 at an inhuman level and we expect them to actually figure this out?
---
Loki also gets the option to fit HAMs with three means of addressing their weak points: an application bonus, drones, and bonused webs.
---
This means that while the Tengu and Legion can use HAMs, they have to put themselves at risk in brawl range to apply them well, or use them long range with poor application and range control.
---
Meanwhile a Loki can fire HAMs at near max DPS while webbing and pointing targets at full range, and using drones to kill anything too small for HAMs to meaningfully hurt.
---
The Loki also has a better base resist profile and is generally easier to fit cheaply.
---
So what you're saying is that the players should just take the evidence that we have access to and discard it for non-provable data that the Devs are pushing?  If there really is outstanding numbers then CCP would publish them.
---
You are asking me, why arent we making krabbing less dangerous, because we just made it more dangerous.
---
Hahahaha
---
REEEEEEE
---
Yes so there is a need to hinder the ways that players have found to have perfect intel like local blackout
---
... Don’t be sorry for me if you honestly think that.  Poor thing
---
It's made up bullshit. They are working in the open now to push vets away from the game to solve their cancerous super capital problem they let get so big.
---
Their only solution is force the vets to fuck off outta here and start with a fresh set of noobies.
---
Do they have any history of granting the "lost" rewards from these things?
---
I have one of my 6 characters I'm doing this on locked up.
---
worse, he's a renter
---
Cry to ccp for nerfs before you quit again
---
A juggernaut in the 4x strategy games, especially paradox ones.
---
When winterco and panfam will both have completly moved to the dronelands, it's almost certain that the imperium will attack legacy, if only for content.
---
Lowsec pvp.
---
Lots and lots of things are more engaging than sitting in comms for 4 hours waiting for a fight, having nothing happen, then blobbing a vexor and pressing f1.
---
True.
---
oh shit they know
---
Look at the graphs. They tell a story opposite of the line they are feeding us
---
Exactly.
---
And part of my disturbance is how selective recruiting and that kind of pride became completely obsolete. 
---
A "newbro" can credit card warrior into a ratting super and become part of the problem in a single day. We are dealing with these people who never align, who dont join comms, who are afk, who dont know how to dscan, in titans, in supers, even streaming their PvE, yet getting saved. If you ask most of them are 2-year players or less.
---
The proof is common sense and CCP's claim that the data shows more daily active users. A bot may be logged in for 12+ hours a day, but a player may typically be logged in at 3 or 4 hours at a time. Assuming those numbers, 1 bot logged off = 4 players logged in if the online player count stays the same as it has been.
---
Adapt or quit fellow eve null players. Your words the past 3 years. So Adapt or biomass Bro.
---
Find a better corp.
---
Join NPSI groups.
---
Go into lowsec, get killed, and talk to your killer.
---
Your corp.
---
Get them to give you corporate hangar and wallet access.
---
Take everything.
---
Twirl your mustache and laugh all the way to Jita.
---
I wish I could show you how stupid you are lol
---
Havent you been reading this reddit? These CCP boys have special glasses that let them see the through the tainted data to get to directly to the real deal.
---
I mean, I'm not [totally new](https://i.imgur.com/Qu0j7IU.png) -- it's just that I don't pretend to know all the things.  Plus it makes the whole thing sound more relaxed and approachable.
---
I love the Tengu, i always have. But i would not ever describe it as looking sexy. lol.  
---
loki - is meta for almost every use case.   
---
legion -  is less mediocre than the remaining t3c.  
---
Tengu - once a pve and pvp god, i am sad how far it has fallen. Slightly worse than legion. Also RIP Jamgu (i would rather have a blackbird).  
---
Proteus - is basically non existent outside WHs, because WH people are weird. Something something shitty arazu.
---
If its even 1% then the major players will straight up destroy everything with roaming superfleets. Thats one of the main reasons why asset safety is what it is. And CCP wants o make the game easier for newer players, lool.
---
just did the math today. Depending on how you look at how the plex/extractors/mptc is coming into the game, i consume between $1,757.82 and $2,517.40 usd \*per month\* with my farms, we're talking less than 2 dozen accounts.  
---
imagine how much money people like Olmeca Gold and Mar5hy bring in, subsidizing via farming to have hundreds of accounts.  
---
Farms are going nowhere, we're the steady income
---
This isnt about pvp bait, this is about the economic viability of anyone that can't afford a super shield. You can't out drop, or out spend people like us.  We can escalate farther and worse the you ever can. If you fight back we will obliterate you. And you know what. I am the person saying this is a shit mechanic.  Doesnt that shake you at all. 
---
Are seriously not following this conversation or did you take a goverment class on how to debate without understanding the facts.
---
Not every T1 explo frigate can have the dashing good looks of the Imicus.
---
In the past no, it was just fixed and you dealt with it. But it wasn't like you lost anything you were guaranteed to get like this one. You just couldn't complete certain tasks.
---
If you want to pvp that bad don’t fit fast paper thin shops supers oneshot instead of crying on reddit
---
~~the Imicus is ugly tho~~
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In terms of beauty I'd say Magnate&gt;Heron&gt;Imicus&gt;Probe :P
---
Your Corp had to turn off their bots and play the game lol
---
This genius gives away a bunch of skill points with daily log-ins, and thinks it's the blackout that did it.  haha
---
You are lacking precision to explain your problem, but as a general advice: if you get bored go do something else. NS, LS and WHs are really different from one another, just go play some place else.
---
So there's a big conspiracy to misrepresent it for...what exactly? 
---
I'm just trying to understand what this weird as flat-earther, they're lying to us, they're coverning up the real truth, here's who shot JFK conspiracy is all about. I mean, you guys are way out in left field claiming so weird ass shit about how this evil corporation is just lying to its players to try to cover up some super secret hurf blurf top secret stuff it doesn't want anyone to know. 
---
I thought the flat-earther movie was funny...but really.
---
yup good point :-)  and they even do not realize how some things are overpowered...
---
That is what happened with most corps.
---
Now, most of them might be re-thinking their places, and maybe, joinining another big massive block?
---
Meanwhile, EVERY problem still there...
---
nice, its good to see bigger youtube channels pick up eve and hand hold people past the first few hours, i remember following scott manley's tutorial series back when i started.
---
You're gonna have to read my reply to the other person. 
---
Btw, Don't do drugs kids
---
Seeing how new he is, i assume he is alpha. Doesn't make sense to go omega from the beginning. At least in my opinion
---
This is what most makes me sad. I am always thinking on the small/smaller corps/allainces. The struggle is insane :(
---
Hilmar, please, for the health of the game, step down.  
---
It shouldn't take 40% of the playerbase downloading the 64 bit client for you to realize that we are 'innovators' as you say.  
---
We were told that the 64-bit client would fix the majority of the issues with lag, desync and log in info being lost. Is it true? who knows, but we did it anyways.  
---
if you really wanted to see what kind of innovators eve players were, look no further than:  
---
* average alliance's IT infrastructure rivaling large real-world companies
---
* Zkill
---
* Eve ISk/hr
---
* dotlan
---
* near2
---
* taco
---
* fuzzworks
---
* pyfa
---
* evemon
---
* evedroid
---
* podsaver auto evemails
---
* literally every other player made site/app/program designed to facilitate the gameplay experience (whether for better or worse)
---
It's an absolute insult that you would think your launcher, years overdue, is so amazing that it lead to an epiphany.

In the context of this thread, the reward is asset denial. Like I said in that link, take it elsewhere.

Can soundcloud even handle 2hr files?
---
It's a t2 fit, sure it has asklepians but in lowsec you're alot less likely to lose your pod.
---
To clarify: I've been playing on and off for some time.  I streamed learning the game for a bit a little over a year ago.  It's just that I've stayed on the fairly casual side of things.
---
I've always felt that despite the intimidating stories about Eve Online that it is actually a perfectly fine game to play semi solo/casually and still be fun for plenty of people (though some of those people might graduate to the more hardcore side over time).
---
The series is going to mostly stay away from serious PVP encounters, but it will cover the basics of survival -- Episode 4 has me doing exploration in a Wormhole and demonstrates the basics of safe spots and DSCAN and whatnot (and a nice ~10mil haul from a Relic site...a heck of a windfall for a day-old Alpha account.)
---
Lololol SaNdBox DiEiNg CcPeE BaD CoZ PlEx
---
First things first. The game is supercaps on line, and it always has been. Winning the subcap fight just lets you position your super fleet a bit better, but it doesn't help if they can out-escalate you.
---
To pick a random "selective recruiting" alliance, Pandemic Legion always supported masses of terribad people in PVE ratting supers. It's just they paid rent in BOT.
---
Goons and Legacy weaponized those krabs into both the main fleet and the supercap umbrella.
---
They made it work. And once Pandemic Legion lost supercap superiority, they proved to be not very scary, because "attack smaller groups until the loot pinata opens and you can recruit their FCs and super pilots" only works when you're winning.
---
Don't believe me about terribad PVE super pilots being the core of the super defense fleet ? Play some defense sometime, and see how many ratting supers jump in to a save.
---
You poor greasy bastard.
---
It's time to move out of your mothers basement, get a fucking job, and afford to PAY to play this game. Get an alt or two, or three, or 5 like i have, and quit being a freeloading mommy tit milking mouthbreather
---
It's not an eve tutorial until your ship blows up. Like Concord yourself by shooting Concord or something.
---
I don't know why someone suggested him AFK. In my experience, returning after leaving usually takes more time to adjust. do not give up，man.If you don't have a cleanliness habit of hiring records, I recommend that you change your lifestyle. Maybe wh is low space, maybe a new legion, and most importantly, find your desire.
---
This is what happens when you deny Vikings any darkness for six months at a time.  
---
They have to make their own darkness.
---
well why not more  removing all the clocking devices?
---
I don't understand the Developer logic... You're correctly identifying the problems, I tend to agree with your assessment.   
---
but then you Devs go on to mention that the fix for these problems is to blindly try random stuff to 'shake-up' the player behavioral meta, rather than.. i dunno... FIXING THE PROBLEMS YOU JUST IDENTIFIED. deleting local (while good) does not fix even a fraction of the problems with the game!  
---
We players screamed on Reddit and Forums about rorquals, injectors, timezone tanking structures, structure spam, titan build time buff by rigged sotiyos, jump gates, fatigue, etc and even went so far as to agree with us, then promptly decided to stop babysitting these changes once implemented. Now suddenly, after creating this mess, you decide it was the player's fault all along so the solution is now to buttfuck the players out of their comfort zone rather than directly addressing these problems?
---
We lived with these shit changes for how many years now? (and of course min/maxed them, we're eve players after all; can't beat them, join them while it lasts).
---
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed

R5: So on one of my most succesful Byz runs the AI is doing bettter then I've ever seen them do. Theyll soon own most of Europe and they already are en route to own all the Americas. Do I still keep going for forming Rome or will mid-late game Spain be unbeatable.
---
Since the initial tutorial that players see in the game basically covers basically just combat, I did want to cover the Industry Career Agent track to demo other sections of gameplay (since in just a few short steps you quickly see mining/refining/crafting). But that's just one episode.
---
Don't get hooked on Eve now, it has just entered the death throws of the last 1/3 of its life. It's a bad time to get hooked, trust me.

depends.... do you have Asset Safety in that game?

&gt; \- The more tools you give to players, the more large scale impersonal groups you can create. A small startup is more engaging and endearing than a huge conglomerate. We should make you have to trust players more so you get stabbed in the back more, make trusting people more important. Trust should be the fundamental currency in eve. We want eve to be the game where you always win in the most trusted, tight knit group.
---
Goons have been playing together for a very long time. We have a huge trust network. The idea that groups like Goons won't be possible due to the high bar of trust, well that ship has already sailed. 
---
I hope they account for this when designing new systems.

Amount doesn't matter much in how much SP I think since generally SP rewards increase logins regardless because people will login their characters regularly to obtain the reward so yes it does in fact increase logins and this is observable. And as of my point I'm not sure how it invalidates my argument without addressing the rest of it in addition to what I just added, but I have not seen more than 20,000 players today, it's looking between 15k to 20k when it was I think about 30k+ not long ago and seems to have dropped between those two numbers since blackout.
---
This could also be people unsubbing their mining alts(every ror pilot I know who isn't in goons seems to be doing this). I lived in Cobalt Edge before and activity has gone down to virtually no miners except the balsy ones that have died in exhumers, they are being hit hard without a capital umbrella which is still the best solution that big power blocks use against the blackout. So PVP's been active from what I have seen up there but money's running out quickly for many, they may adapt though it hasn't really been too long. One thing's certain is that the demands to live in nullsec have been raised significantly and a lot of space might open up.
---
sadly :-( instead of making new thing supporting gameplay a skirmished, they did this sh*t
---
Yeah, but that took hilmar a year from when he mentioned it first.
---
They have made changes every week, they changed the skill point reward mechanism, they changed the drifters.
---
Managed expectations.
---
Is this real???
---
Is this a dream?
---
Are they actually saying this???
---
Time will tell....
---
Have they showed the data? Because they also think the Drifters were a success for logins.
---
Very good points all around. People take for granted that obviously null ratting is lucrative and was fairly risk free, as well as infinitely scalable. That needs to be pulled back. I'd be curious to see how many people are paying with ISK vs cash for subs, since it isn't just bots out there driving PLEX up, despite them being by far the likely largest factor. 
---
Would be interesting to see a city vs. farm argument to the way players can operate with limitless density without any sort of prioritization necessary for structure purpose. There's no reason, if you're wealthy enough, not to drop a keepstar in every single system where you have activity.

Looking at your stupid fucking post history I'd guess between 0-1 you little loser lmao

This interview has made me really positive about Eve.
---
Eve's biggest problem isn't local, super proliferation, cynos, rorquals, or whatever is the popular punching bag. *Eve's biggest problem is that the players have mastered the game*. It needs to be shaken up. I'm glad CCP is willing to take risks and find our what works. I hope they never stop.
---
Can't, I'm docked :D
---
They do that because people would just train up a bunch of account for a specific purpose and then go alpha with them.
---
Haven't looked inside of the folder but a more reliable solution would probably be to set the .gitignore to something like !(FILE\_I\_WANNA\_ROLLBACK|FILE\_2|...|ETC) that way you wont accidentally affect something else down the road.
---
Your quote indicates you are aware how badly this would sound.  
---
&gt; I should ask what do you think but honestly I really don't care and just figured I'd post it no matter what.

Hilmar and Falcon's message to the player base - if you don't like the changes don't worry you're #alreadyreplaced
---
Well, the first thing i go by is the title of the post and something that is labeled as "tutorial by a new player" simply doesn't seem appealing to me. When i want a tutorial i usually want something explained by a person that has experience with it. New players aren't exactly what anyone would expect as experienced (which is perfectly fine, i just don't see why anyone would get attracted by that kind of description).  
---
  
---
But i don't really see why you need to explain yourself. Making such a video is a cool thing, the title of this post is just picked rather poorly. that's on OP tho, not on you.
---
thanks!
---
Considering peak EU time was 32k average two weeks ago and now peak EU average barely break 26k, your assumption is off. Bots are still active. It's mostly indi players that have logged off.
---
And we see your education level, nuff said.
---
There *are* structural obstacles to new players.  
---
As one example, it is significantly easier to supply a regional market minihub with a wide complement of competitively priced T2 modules than it is to supply one with modules that new players can use.  
---
Ergo, not only do veteran players have more stockpiles of handy components around, but they can also restock and reship more easily, even without a stack of fitted ships on hand.
---
This could be ameliorated by having a simple, low-sp, low-investment system for inventing tech 1 goods into meta goods.  Then it would be a simple matter of letting more newly minted players stock their own markets with tech one goods, and then inventing what they needed using some npc drop as an output limiter.  Probably something such as changing scrap to -faction- scrap and then reprocessing it into [place holder item ID] would be adequate.  
---
Timesinks for specializations are reasonable, but general timesinks that inhibit fresh players from participating in non-specific areas are undesirable.  
---
Source of information:  Managing &gt;1000 market slots to supply BNI hubs with minimally profitable gear accessible to low-SP recruits.  It was boring and tedious, and frankly should have been an area of content that they could have had fun filling themselves as novice producers, but didn't because of shitty game fundamentals.
---
As an investor myself I’m constantly evaluating my real word risk tolerance and can relate to this article completely. Awesome write up.
---
Remove asset recovery from nullsec!
---
Players turned it into trash a loooooong time ago.
---
Name one time in the last 16 years that CCP got their math right.
---
Yeah, and also curse all these brand new fresh resubbing vets. Your 10 rorqual alts are worth much more than them.
---
I will make it legal.
---
That sounds awfully complicated, unintuitive and, to be honest, almost like a scam (or at least very easily rigged)... I usually love either participating or watching tournaments, but this doesn't even look like one.
---
What benefit does CCP gain about lying about their data and keeping the blackout going?
---
Even if they did- Some people will just murmer "FAKE"
---
Trying to maintain confidence that numbers aren't dropping for both the players and investors.
---
They already attack each other for content, almost daily. They just don't hit structures or sov by diplomatic agreement. Legacy is the Imperium's eastern buffer region.

The fuck is with people thinking Legacy and Goons are blue?

RvB had to really scale out their alliance fights

God forbid their numbers might refer to active individuals rather than active accounts

Killing explorers isn't exactly a goodfight. Why are there no pve activities that can be efficiently done in a pvp capable ship? Group pve that requires moving about a bunch in pvp-capable ships would be ideal.
---
Im hard right now. Ccp, make it happen end the age of turtle.
---
It's a lot easier in a good newbros corp. Join E-Uni. I have stuff to teach you, other people have stuff to teach me.
---
There is more than just that in nullsec and there always has been.
---
I recommend to most people that they go omega in the beginning. Get the full experience. There's too much free to play stuff going around, what happened to paying for games?

So i just came back, after almost 2 years. I fly caldari, i like missles. Iv never delved into pretty much anything other than solo mission running and mining. What the french toast do i do. I like the idea of these Invasions. Id also like to try exploration. Please help for the love of god. I want to love this game.
---
One point: Making it a lot easier to backstab people isn't conducive to building trusting environments. I have a feeling they are going to kill groups that rely on opsec by severely limiting what ESI can show you about a char.
---
I don't think you are the target audience even if that was going on
---
Inb4 jump gate to stain

tbh that is probably too extreme
---
Flashbacks to the good old Darwin Torpedo propoganda

&gt;That is a near constant stream of activity in case you're missing it.
---
there is in A&amp;E, too. Doesn't mean I wanna be a patient.
---
But the active player count is up, so fuck em.
---
I don't think they would have a 16 yr old MMO if they had an issue with math.
---
I guess you have not noticed, how easy it is to kill a Jump Bridge, far easier than in the days of old.  I also surmise the extreme cost and risk slipped past your consideration ***for the chance*** to slip a fleet, or fleets behind enemy lines.  I believe it to be well balanced, risk versus reward, to stir things up between the major power blocks that currently believe themselves safe and well entrenched with their meatshields and pets surround their fortresses.
---
Give every nullsec system and every highsecsystem a gate to stain. Also make all wormholes have a stain static.

Im to lazy for look in the post history of and idiot  that clearly noneone cares  haha

Nice video!  I really enjoy your HoI and Stellaris series, glad to see that you're doing some EVE content!
---
Oh and mandatory: "Join Horde"
---
Read it again.
---
&gt;CCP can't even tell who is ratting 23/7 at an inhuman level and we expect them to actually figure this out?
---
they can, that's why most bots don't do what you say above.
---
hmmmmmmmmm, nope you're crazy
---
&gt;Are you SURE that doesn't have anything to do with the copious amounts of free SP giveaways immediately after the blackout to artificially increase player logins?
---
said initiatives have come nowhere even close to the numbers this one has, it's pretty easy to understand
---
This is such horse s**t. First, why does everything need to be a dystopian hellscape??? Also, mining has never been balanced.  If Eve were real, mining ships would be able to protect themselves.  It makes no economic or actual sense for a ship the size of a Rorq to be able to be taken down by a bunch of frigates. Titans should not be able to locked down by an damn  Atron. Noone would design ships like that. Also, to have to have a fleet just to protect some miners also makes no economic sense. If you want to make Eve better how about you make it easier to survive when 15 guys warp in on a skiff. That's not PVP, that's just a slaughter. Rant complete.
---
Or is de-anchored
---
if u dont wanna play with the tricycle then don't leave it in the yard(null), put it away into the shed where it is safe(low/high/npc), or grow up and give it away to goodwill (can I have your stuff?)
---
God yes.  This.  
---
A few of these statements are a bit questionable on the data they're using to back up these claims.  Like, if you just remove EVE from the authorized billing on paypal, they won't know you've unsubbed until the time runs out and they try to bill.    If you run SP events, how can you call the data on logins accurate?    
---
As an aside, from a personal perspective, the blackout has hit the smaller groups disproportionately in null.  If you want tight-knit groups and an end to the umbrella then that's kiiiinda not the direction things have been going.  I lived in an area with some renter alliances; one swallowed the two next door and the one I was in pretty much had to straight-up move.  I know there's a fair bit of hate for renters but it's an avenue of newer players and people trying to get a fresh foothold in null.
---
So you're dumb is what you're saying, got it.
---
Anything to destroy the peace of those huge null blocs ,because null should be dangerous and not safe heavens for a group of bullies .

Nah, you sound pretty dumb.
---
As a newer player that’s fallen in love with the game, I only hope Eve can pull off a huge second wind, and gain an influx of new players. I genuinely regret not being there for the golden ages. Here’s hoping.
---
The game is literally unplayable with just the basic skins

back in my day plex was 230mil

I pity the poor fools that are showing up to these ops.

If you were ever in Null without a HS JC you deserve to die. Hahaha. If you been kicked, you cab reset your death clone station yo your newbcorp location then death clone there.

&gt; Curious to see what EVE will look like Winter 2019.
---
eve-offline data.
---
period averages.
---
5y: 38k players.
---
1y: 32k players.
---
6mo: 29k players.
---
3mo: 24k players.
---
1mo: 21k players.
---
2wk: 20k players.
---
1wk: 20k players.
---
fwiw, as they are rounded - the 1wk's 20k line is lower on the graph than the 2 wk's 20k line.
---
so i guess if we're doing some fag packet extrapolation - game's gonna have sub 20k players when you look at anything 3mo or more recent.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Not really, you think I'm actually trying hard while shitposting on reddit?
---
You dont lose omega skills, they just turn off until you resub. If you activate omega again itll all still be there.
---
care to chime in falcon?
---
As a newer player myself I can’t recommend exploration enough. It get’s you out into every corner of the world, it gets you learning how to probe scan and d-scan effectively, and it’s pretty lucrative isk-wise for a new player. Just fit up a cheap heron explorer, maybe train up a few scanning skills, and you’re away. If you enjoy it, you can eventually train for covops ships for better scanning, or an astero which you can fit out for an exploring/hunting hybrid deal.
---
we know they can.
---
they did it last time they added 10k/sp for the first kill of the day.
---
rise told us that the whole thing was a flop - so i have no idea why they think it's going to be any different this time.
---
is any alliance the same they were years ago?
---
I mean tapi is still being a worse version of goons with no self awareness, soooo...
---
I have yet to see mentionned that Snuff brought 40 carriers along with their mach fleet, with probably boson titans on standby, knowing them. If you're wondering why we didn't fight, here's why.
---
It's quite funny that Volta, usually complaining about cap blobs and carriers being op, anchored their azbel in lowsec so they can rely on Snuff and their caps to defend it.
---
I know I'll get downvoted anyway, but I'll just say that as a random line member I regret we blued Horde in HS, I actually enjoyed fighting them, we had many gudfites, even though the fun was a bit ruined by citadel spam bs.
---
Yeah, but mining sucks, so keep it short please.
---
Don't bait people in with this "it's relaxing" and "easy isk" nonsense.
---
As a newbro?
---
Not really.
---
istabs...? You have 1. Don't have shit agility skills.
---
3 hyper lows, 1 istab, 2 hyper rigs, large shield extender, 50mn, adaptives

100k-ish heated tank (or maybe that's 3 hyper+dcu?), 50mn/cloaky trick, and 6au warp speed
---
Comment made by someone who’s scared of the Eve future in Null.
---
So is wingspan recruiting delivery agents?  The idea of Express delivery of the highest quality ordinance straight to ships intrigues me.
---
Lol, I don’t think Newton’s laws of physics are applied in the game. Also the comment on small ships in numbers being able to take down a massive ship, how would that not seem ok? It’s totally plausible, it’s like many ants eating something many times their size. Could one lone ant do it? Hell no, can many? Fuck yes!
---
We're blue with the Imperium for major fights, that's it. But the fights we have are mostly with roaming gangs. What I mean is that, at one point, they won't know what to do with their titans and just invade Esoteria, because who else would they attack.

T1 tackle frigates have a place in any gate camp or fleet, if you don't think so I have to start wondering if you have ever even been to nullsec.

Ah yes the infamous lowsec bosons.

You should probably fire whoever is giving you your intel.

they're never going to list skins for cash directly - it'd be too easy to see how disproportionately expensive they are vs cosmetics in every other game.

T2 or T3 ABC's (mode switch like T3D's) for big damage on large targets, but easily countered by other subcaps in the same class or smaller. Naga hull with missiles plz

Asset safety your stuff. Leave your ship - undock - die, right click the station in your assets list and hit "Move into asset safety", this will move the assets to the closest station that anyone can dock in(npc not player) and then you can hire Blackfrog Freight or Push X to move your stuff out. You'll have to repackage your ships though, unless you plan to fly them out.
---
thank you

Rejoin goons because it's the easiest shit ever and just hire ITL to move your stuff.

i have always said it, eve lives and dies by the decisions of the creators, and they have proven for so long that they really dont give a shit about this game anymore.  its only now, that they are on the verge of retirement, that they have to at least pretend to care, in order to fulfill the obligations of their IP sale contract. unfortunately I think hilmar is just too out of touch, along with other members of ccp... and it's really a crap shoot whether the changes they make will have any long lasting effect, and there's still the uncertainty of what's going to happen when pearl abyss takes full control?
---
yeh, Ive never roamed with groups that shippost like that in local before flying into a staging system while trying to get welped, Sorry Brave but we sat at 0 on the sun in our own bubble for 30 minutes. For the most part, shitposting is great when it is just that: shitposting, when it gets to insults, then it breaks down.
---
Let the VNI keep its new buffs, but give it enough bandwidth for 5 geckos, and a new mode called “auto-Fight”.
---
Auto-fight will have the ship warp to anoms  and belts killing everything, warp back to a safe citadel if anyone enters (just a built in feature, doesn’t need local or D-Scan). 
---
If it gets tackled it has a built in cyno that cannot be blocked by a cyno inhib. It is invulnerable for an hour (invulnerability timer has a cool down of 1 minute).
---
I might finally move a toon back to K-space and start paying attention to the politics.

Log in data to prove this Blackout is working... "MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years". What they don’t seem to mention with that comment is that they eschewed the log in data by throwing a “Skilling Spree”.  Making players log in for free stuff is not the same. 
---
I don’t know where they're pulling the data from anyway. From what we see, players are not logging in and playing. They're logging in for free stuff, jumping on coms, and ship spinning... Content is down for PVP and PVE alike in my region. They say that “Capital umbrella’s” were a problem... now their an epidemic. We had a full cap fleet jump in within seconds to defend a couple Orca’s because they had nothing else to do. My entire alliance followed this fleet for over an hour just looking for something to kill. Ultimately they docked up and that was it.... FOR HOURS..... Don’t believe me, watch the last META SHOW with those fancy umbrellas in it. They pull the raw numbers right on the webcast.... Entire fleets begging for content. No Krab fleets for as far as the eye can see. Hours of jump, scan, probe, find a target, warp to it, see it tethered, move to the next system. Rinse and repeat.
---
This Blackout decision was a cop-out. What they did to Null is just like my internet provider increasing the price for the same services, but reminding me it still the best out there !! I don’t care what they say... I still feel screwed every time.
---
They need to come up with innovative ways to make Eve more engaging. This local thing is garbage for both PVE and PVP players alike in my bubble. Some people love it and good for them. But the people who love it, don’t play the way we play. So although some folks like to throw poop at posts like this, we’re all entitled to our own opinions. 
---
These Observatories I hear rumors about would be an option, but they should have been released around the same time as this Blackout. Even though they just want us spending more isk/plex/RL Money to buy these structures and help the bottom line, at least there would be an option for all the players. 
---
CCP  like any other business is in it for the money. We will give you money.... Just un-F our game.

---
Its more people logging in is more people. If you think there are simply more people logging in but not undocking or if this has somehow increased the amount of bots you are being willfully ignorant or trolling.

I'm back to playing, for whatever that is worth.  I've got 3 months omega, and i'm looking forward to seeing what come of all this.
---
I was \*definitely\* expecting a different pastebin here.
---
Actually, here's a wild thought: open up shit-tonnes of K-space wormholes to Jove space and make it NPC null: basically Thera spread across a region, with gate travel and cynos. All going you'd end up with a region that was nothing special resources wise, but a great strategic asset for NS raiding groups like BL or old PL. NPC null would also allow hostile groups to coexist in the same space and skirmish locally.

I was 90% PvE in a section of space that has a lot of red roamers. It's a non-starter now, as the changes screw NRDS and work solely in favor of alliances that can out-escalate us.  But, I've logged 14 different accounts in every day the past week to get the SP in case CCP looked at the numbers this week and realized where this road leads.  I guess there's no use holding the breath on that one.
---
We're a null corp with a few dozen active members that has held the same space for over 4 years.  My CEO and several of our 5+ year corp-mates "won Eve" this week.  I'm quickly realizing that I only played this game to hang out with them.
---
I'm just waiting for all our shit to get blown up by the deep-pocket gangs, and go into asset safety.  Our indexes have hit zero and we can't mine to replace ships.  Even though my accounts are paid up for many months, I predict I'm out of steam in a matter of weeks too.  At a bare minimum I'm not renewing 3 paid accounts and just coasting along for as long as I can on the isk I've saved over the last four years.  Yeah, I could join one of the giant NBSI alliances and do their bidding just fine, but it doesn't appeal to me.  I have no ill will towards anyone that decides to go that route.
---
Long story short - I doubt the numbers have even really begun to tell the total impact Blackout is going to have on the game - next months totals will be *interesting*.  I've lost confidence in CCP, since their solution to the older entities being unbalanced was to up the defense difficulty in a manner disproportionately effective to the little guys that were not overpowered and needed no correction.  Even if you're in love with the changes, think twice before buying yearly subs, lest the next "chaos" screw over your style of gameplay and run off the friends you hung out with for the past four years.

ahahaha XD

Thanks for posting this. As someone who quit in 2016 and recently came back, I can say many within the small gang community that I've been a part of are returning and extremely happy with the tone from CCP in this video. While I suspect nullbloc people won't be very happy, I think overall this will be a good shift for the game.
---
Probably about the same as a year ago though.
---
Haven't you heard? The MAU is AMAZING and Eve is saved. As a result, everyone and their mother has resubbed to witness this midlife crisis first hand.
---
Communist wages or the lack thereof
---
Always negative, is it truly eve you have a problem with or is it due to real life stuff? Broadcast for reps bro. I took a 6 year break. I needed it and when I came back it felt like I was playing for the first time all over again. Except I had general knowledge ect. Maybe take a 6month break or if it’s truly a irl issue seek some help.
---
TIL you can Boson in LowSec.
---
Allow the purchase of a war pass for an entire system that turns a high sec or low sec into null sec with no gate guns and no concord.. and zero warning.
---
Because it was an absolutely _insane_ murderboat. Like twice the DPS of a Talos insane boat.
---
&gt;trapped
---
The accidental widsom of neophytes
---
They are set up to either be run in Cruisers solo, or in 3 Frigates (three people presumably). 
---
That said, you can run the three-person T1 and T2 sites in a Frigate. T2 requires a pretty expensive fit Frigate (typically a bling Retribution). 
---
T1s can be flown in a lot of things assuming you tailor the ship to the type of sites you are running. 
---
There is an active discord group for Abyssal sites (solo cruiser, solo frigate and frigate trios) call Abyssal Lurkers:  [https://discord.gg/ppk7B7Y](https://discord.gg/ppk7B7Y). I'd recommend joining it and asking questions and getting fit recommendations there.
---
welcome back to eve, now go fuck yourself
---
too lazy for english too lmao
---
delete your 10-day old account you BITCH
---
This isn't even close to true. It's a debasement of a russian word "раб" which means like "slaving away". It became popular after Putin used it in a sentence and the Russian bot community started using it.
---
Now, as a newbro, go do that on your own or make it happen.
---
Vets came up in a dangerous game. The only people leaving the game are people that want a risk free existence and Bots.
---
Dayum.  Excitement intensifying.
---
As others have said... plexing accounts is more money for CCP than subbing with irl cash.
---
Irl cash = 15/month
---
Plex = 20/month 
---
1 person with 15 accounts is worth at least quite literally, 15 real players. 
---
Is it healthy for the game? No.
---
Does it make CCP a boat load of money? Yes.
---
How long till they start a patreon to continue funding development because 'lol the money ran out' ?
---
Ohh i fell so bad now becuse a stupid nab want me out  buu buu!  hahaha
---
Sorry, today, you are not gay pwnd.
---
I would prefer a permanent break from life atm
---
Here you go sir. Read the last part
---
 Listening to it and I'll type interesting quotes (paraphrased) with timestamps.
---
02:25 - Hilmar: "We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years" - (DAU/MAU = Daily/Monthly active users).
---
04:50 - Hilmar: "Blackout is accomplishing their goals for this year, one of those goals is to make the game easier for new players and more challenging for veteran players, eve nullsec gameplay has been completely figured out and thus causing stagnancy"
---
06:30 - Hilmar: "It's now much easier for them to track data and make hypothesis
---
 from that data, and thus they are going to do more experiments. previously they overthink everything and thus move way too slow, CCP going to do more changes like blackout in the future"
---
08:00 - Hilmar: "overtime the chaos of eve online has been drained into order, the sand in the sandbox has turned into cement, eve online will enter into a new chaos era"
---
10:40 - Responding to Carneros asking about if more experiments will take place soon. Hilmar: "We want you on your toes, we want you to feel like the blanket is being pulled from under you every single week, your heart rate is going up, you need to take stress medicine to keep focused, that is the chaos era, and it is on".
---
Chaos Era repeated a bunch.
---
12:20 - Falcon: The Pendulum has swung too far to the safety side and then stopped. I see Nullsec as a wasteland of people who've embedded in, who are happy in their little bubbles, making shit tons of ISK, under conditions safer than empire space. Capital umbrellas mean they can do whatever they want all day, I think we need to be in a position where a lot more unpredictably is throw in, rattle the cage, see who survives and who doesn't. This goes for lowsec too.
---
14:15 - Falcon: Eve if up to me, would be a very harsh dark dystopian place where bad stuff happens, eve should be an absolute hellscape of terribleness.
---
15:20 - Hilmar: "The world as we built it was static, because we never thought we'd be running eve for decades, we're 16 years in and we're limited by the initial conditions of the game. We need to empower eve-online with natural chaos built into the system. procedural regeneration should be built into eve and ideally it should freak we (CCP) out as to what is going on.
---
19:40 - Hilmar: (On Resource depletion) - We need procedural regeneration, in nature when you strip mine you destroy the environment, we should have offensive mining where you destroy your opponents environments like in real life wars. Right now the system is too static. Players have become too self-sufficient, originally we had asymmetric resource distribution, then we changed it to symmetric distribution.
---
24:45 - 28:00 - When asked about transitioning more risk averse players who are resistant to change over to the new chaos era of eve Hilmar: When we launched the new 64bit client I was surprised by how many players immediately started using it, over 40%. There was not many real immediate benefits and it was an opt-in beta that didn't directly affect the gameplay of most people adopting it. Because of that, we believe we have far more innovators playing eve than we original thought. That gave me a different way to think about it, based on the influx and based on the response to the relatively crazy things over the summer, the response and data has been very positive. We have much less risk averse people than you might think. Eve is designed as a difficulty mountain, but the mountain is broken. It doesn't go high enough, and it also doesn't go low enough.
---
30:20 - CCP Goodfella - The stagnation makes people more risk averse than they actually are in their natural habitat, eve players in general are hardcore and they will adapt to the chaos. We are seeing players coming back to the game because we're shaking things up.
---
34:35 - CCP Falcon - the MER for July and August will look very bizarre due to the Blackout. Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data, it's incredible to see activity is still there. ISK generated from bounties is down massively, but that player activity is still there it has just shifted to other activities as players have adapted. We believe blackout has a been a enormous success.
---
37:30 - Hilmar - There is going to be a lot of different things coming in the coming weeks that will destabilise the system further, so people will constantly have new things to deal with.
---
41:20 - Hilmar - Much more rapid fire action from CCP than you're used to, ideally something should be changing every week, some sweeping changes some will be widely unpopular, some will be wildly popular behind the scenes, we will be bringing about a different state which I strongly believe eve needs right now. Over the next 18 months we will be a wildly different position than we were at the beginning of the year.
---
42:40 - Falcon - the map needs a huge shakeup, we need to create conflict, people have built their sandcastles, now they need to fight for them.
---
44:30 - Falcon - We don't need an eve classic or an eve 2. We have a great game and community, we just need to make the right changes.
---
51:30+ - Falcon - Want to make gathering intel more of a player skill rather than something that the game automatically gives you through ESI/ingame data. The hardcore element of the game is still here and he has hope.
---
1:06:00 - Hilmar - The more tools you give to players, the more large scale impersonal groups you can create. A small startup is more engaging and endearing than a huge conglomerate. We should make you have to trust players more so you get stabbed in the back more, make trusting people more important. Trust should be the fundamental currency in eve. We want eve to be the game where you always win in the most trusted, tight knit group.
---
1:13:30 - Hilmar: - A lot of designers in CCP are interested in FW tweaks/changes, he personally joined the factional warfare discord and sees a lot potential in a few quick changes
---
Discussion about first 30 days and bad UX design etc.
---
1:25:00 - Hilmar: - Future of agency drugs and events asked, Hilmar talks about FW, Roams, and 'Seasons'. CCP have been doing experiments in the closed beta in China, because it's a beta it can be wiped, so have been doing crazy events and collecting data. Agency events may come back in force.
---
Technical Improvements asked about, Hilmar mentions 64 Bit eve client was a big project that's finished, now they're working towards Direct 12 client, Combat improvements in Dogma, Upgrading a lot of backend network stuff/middlewear etc. Upgrading visual studio etc which will help development things faster.
---
1:29:18 - Hilmar: ISK faucets and sinks out of whack, too much ISK in the system, there are a lot of fundamental economy problems that they will address. PLEX prices are rising and out of whack because of the value of ISK is falling, because work in eve is not valuable enough. We need to put risk up to make ISK more valuable. The richest 1% in eve is way too powerful, it's worse than reality. Cruel but Fair. The next 6 months will focus a lot on the economy.
---
New fleet finder, social discovery tools mentioned. ISK is too easy to come by.
---
1:32:20 - when asked about how to make ISK making harder - Hilmar Take away the comfort players have when making ISK, players sense of security (blackout). Bots were affected massively by the blackout, although they are changing tactics, CCP will keep focusing on botters and making life uncomfortable for them.
---
1:35:20 - Falcon And if you're not willing to go out into nullsec and take a risk then you don't belong in nullsec. you should move back to empire if you want to mine in safety. Lawless space should have risk.
---
1:36:30 - Falcon People who said they were unsubbing their 50 accounts didn't actually unsub and things actually stabilised after awhile they were just taken out of their comfort zone temporarily and needed that push. (Shocked pikachu face)
---
A lot of older players returned because of blackout confirmed in the data.
---
Hilmar is not a big fan of making an eve classic. He feels like it's a cop-out for building a proper ecosystem to keep players engaged, difficulty mountain mentioned again. Eve should be a single sharded persistent universe experience. People who want Eve Classic should be able to get the gameplay they want in their current eve online.
---
Questions asked about if CCP should delay ESI/API information.
---
1:44:30 - Falcon We spoon feed too much information. Living in nullsec is currently safer than living in highsec in the right area.
---
1:46:50 - Falcon We should kill asset safety, I believe if you put something down into space, if it gets destroyed it's gone. A lot of people will disagree and risks will be too high. Hilmar The fact that we have NPC stations with infinite amounts of storage space is a huge cop out. We had something earlier on that we had to remove that limited how much you got store in NPC stations. Now with asset safety and citadels you can have billions of ISK in capitals with no limit no upkeep and all safe. You can accumulate too many things. To have such much weapons of war you need fuel to power them, the fact that you can just have titans lying around is not natural and not good gameplay. Something needs to be done, it's not natural, it's not eve.
---
All short range weapons replaced by replica chuck norris fist which deals melee damage with a chance to combo.
---
&gt;  Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data, it's incredible to see activity is still there
---
Mobile cyno inhibs don't show on the overview :|
---
Nah, they have other tricks now, like selling motorbikes as concept art that would be in the game god knows when lmao.
---
when a single kill is worth between ~17.4-58m depending on your level of current SP. i'm sure nobody is bothering to do what's probably the highest isk/effort/time activity right now on as many characters they can endure it.
---
I have 5 characters working, one is frozen with the skill points added, but no mission getting refreshed.
---
Please. Just stop.
---
Wormholer btw
---
Lol really?
---
I delete $1,700-$2,300 worth of plex from the game every month because I multibox. 
---
You think CCP is going to bite the hand that feeds?
---
(59,094 plex per month)
---
Remember armour hacs?
---
collision damage
---
Why not just undock and actually go fight stuff? Get out there and go roam, use wormholes to move around the universe quicker, thera connections or whatever. Let go of your mindset and get out there a shoot stuff.
---
Are you just trying to avoid admitting you said something stupid, or do you actually not understand what working on a game means?
---
This is all pretty great, though I can't help but feel as though there's way too much handwashing going on.  It would be nice if the tone was a little more remorseful - after all, you guys (CCP) are the ones responsible for creating the mess you've finally coming around to noticing.  This isn't as simple as the game becoming 'solved' or slipping out of your control in ways you didn't intend; you've actively catered to null empires, patch after patch, for **years** now.
---
Hell, where do we even begin?
---
You made it so enormous alliances can live in small spaces thanks to infinitely spawning high-quality anomalies.  You even made it hardly matter what region of space they live in, significantly reducing the need or want for these alliances to come into conflict over areas of space. 
---
You overhauled capital ships - allowing them to not only apply well to subcaps but to almost entirely obsolete them - with the end result of making the small areas large alliances live in even safer.
---
You added Rorquals and skill injectors to the game, making it far easier for empires and established players to accumulate wealth and get into those broken (super)capital hulls they use to defend themselves.
---
You transitioned null-life from stations and POSes to the plague of citadels we're forced to deal with everywhere today.  In doing so, you not only changed assets from being locked away for long periods of time and/or outright lost to the enemy to *always* being preserved, but you also created fortresses that protect everything in a large radius around them and require an insane commitment from attackers to take down.
---
And even just recently, you made it substantially easier for empires to move safely around their own space with the new cyno beacons and jump gates.  *(Jump gates you can take if you're fucking tackled! Talk about warp core stabs, Hilmar...)*
---
And all those years, what did you do to make life in null more difficult for empires?  What did you do to incite conflict?  What did you do to help groups be effective in smaller numbers?  Can you even name a single thing?
---
The end result of this very focused game balanced has been to create the nullsec you're only now railing upon: an incredibly safe space occupied almost solely by groups that sit in one place and accumulate wealth, refusing to fight unless the odds are overwhelmingly in their favor.   And you know what?   Every one of these changes was fought by intelligent, experienced members of the community, of whom you continually ignored.
---
This is the bed you made, and even though us pvp-focused players are ecstatic to finally see some real changes on the horizon, you're still going to have to lie in it.
---
You've coddled a very specific kind of player, and now that most of them have given you their initial buy-in and now are more likely to buy plex with isk (something that no doubt has played a part in willing you guys back to reality), you deserve every ounce of their wrath over this.
---
It depends. There's a lot of reasons to go with gallente - but lets use myself as an example. I went with caldari industrials, because I wanted to fly the caldari deep space transport and blockade runner.
---
I wanted to do *that* because when I'd started playing I'd initially thought I would be a heavy duty miner, so specialized into shield tanking skills heavily.
---
That turned out to not happen - but anyway, I already had all of these basic skills trained. Gallente and amarr ships are armor tanked, and although they slightly benefit from shield skills, you shouldn't really tank them that way.
---
Of the two shield tanked dsts - that is, minmatar mastodon and caldari bustard, the bustard is easier to get higher ehp with, and since I wanted to fly it in highsec to do highsec hauling, that was the ship I chose.
---
Now however if I had to go back and do things over again, I probably would have gone with the minmatar mastodon - it's quite a bit more flexible despite having less ehp, and that flexibility matters in lowsec and nullsec where the extra low slot will let you fit more stabs, and the ehp matters much less.
---
... I mean, sure, ehp is important to a degree - if you're *vaporized* before you can run away, more stabs won't save you.
---
Not to mention, the mastodon's a bit faster to align with which makes it easier to do the cloak+mwd trick with without using implants.
---
If I was starting over all the way from the beginning though, on day 1, I might have gone with gallente. Of all of the dsts, the occator is possibly the most bend over backwards flexible one that exists - so if you're starting from nothing, with nothing, gallente's a sure bet.
---
And even I have gallente industrials trained to 1 - the T1 industrials are pretty useful, even with just that level of skilll.
---
It's pretty annoying indeed. I've got 3 accounts stuck since the first day
---
Ive killed so many asteros in my pvp/explo fitted astero ;)
---
&gt; First things first. The game is supercaps on line, and it always has been. Winning the subcap fight just lets you position your super fleet a bit better, but it doesn't help if they can out-escalate you.
---
Didn't make any claim about this.
---
&gt; To pick a random "selective recruiting" alliance, Pandemic Legion always supported masses of terribad people in PVE ratting supers. It's just they paid rent in BOT.
---
&gt; Goons and Legacy weaponized those krabs into both the main fleet and the supercap umbrella.
---
I am not talking about making money off terribad players, or providing infrastructure (aka timer) safety to them. Those players are part of this game, and Eve is better with them. But the moment you make their ships as safe as everyone else, or even safer, that breaks the game. Afterall, if bad players don't die in null, who will? Joining an alliance cannot entitle you to 99% safety.
---
&gt; Don't believe me about terribad PVE super pilots being the core of the super defense fleet ? Play some defense sometime, and see how many ratting supers jump in to a save.
---
I absolutely believe you and I know for a fact myself that this is true. But it doesn't change the problem. The way I look at it is that the core of non-selectivity comes from infinite anoms. The moment people have to spread their 50k accounts to 4 regions instead of one, you'd see better players bunching up in one region, and worse players bunching up in the other. That was pretty much the old Deklein CFC. You were getting supercapfucked in Goon Deklein, but you would go there once every 10 fleets, and Branch was still nice with all the FCON targets and worse response. The ecosystem was more balanced back then. If infiniteanoms were a thing back then, then that old CFC too could condense in a single region and use a single umbrella.
---
This.   I play in NPC null and Blackout didn't force me to leave yet. I know how to dscan and be careful. I do not know how to deal with dscan immune ships that wait until  after I have been out in a ship they can't kill easy for hours and then all of the sudden jump on my PI hauler for giggles. That's all the "leet" PVP I have seen so far. Currenty down like Epithal #6 and fortunately none of the P3 or P4 has dropped as loot just P1 and P2. So while I like blackout as an Idea there is no way I can defend from that type of player
---

---
Nah, it's in the rig slot
---
Lmao cant wait till a year from now when this game is dead
---
Save Eve, skill yourselves
---
Smell. I want to smell space for more immersion.
---
They do when the option is checked
---
Can confirm was ludicrous.
---
You can tell that it's in Jita because there are a bunch of mobile depots stacked up next to the gate.
---
the dua/mua is skewed due to skillpoint login though so that info is largely irrelevant.
---
You use way to many commas in the wrong places
---
have your upvote
---
Get rid of SP.  Everybody can fly a venture to a Titan at max skill proficiency.  Isk is their limit.
---
if i can shitpost 'remove local' for 2 years and it happens he can get a lowsec stain gate
---
Remove the ability to dock tackled ships in carriers, rorquals etc
---
Acceptable!
---
What region are you in, and which alliance were you in before? You might be able to rejoin and either play or get your stuff out.  
---
Asset Safety is a good option, like /u/ExterminatusIllexis says. It basically wraps up all of your assets from a station (you can do it by right-clicking on a station's line in your Personal Assets window) and delivers it to the nearest Lowsec NPC system. You'll have to pay ISK to get the stuff out of the Asset Safety wrap, a percentage of the value. 
---
While you can certainly go to High Sec, I think Nullsec is as interesting as it's been in years. (That's a controversial opinion)
---
The mechanics of system Sovereignty have changed, like they do every few years, but it's not a big deal. Lots of ships have been buffed or rebalanced, but that's to be expected. The biggest change is the newest one, where you only show up in Local chat after you say something. (Like in wormholes)
---
If you're sure you want to play in highsec, I'm sure you can find fun there too. I'd still recommend you join a corp, as space is really lonely and aimless without friends. As they say, the best ship is friendship. 
---
If you want to give nullsec life a try again, [Dreddit is recruiting](www.DredditIsRecruiting.com). We are the founding members of TEST Alliance, that is part of the Legacy Bloc. Together we own the bottom-right corner of the map. I'm sure we'd be happy to have you. 
---
I recently came back after 8 years out in the real world, and Dreddit helped me get back into the swing of things. They have Mentors to get you back into the fun and answer your questions. In-game and Discord help channels for newbs and the newb-at-heart to answer even the simplest questions. I've asked some real doozies. The acronyms, especially, are a pain.  
---
We've got SRP (Ship Replacement Program) to help pay for your ship losses in fleets, which you probably had in your last corp too. We have a wiki, forums, voice comms, and a ton of apps and sites made by our nerds. 
---
There is a SIG (Special Interest Group) and or discord channel for everyone, and I am in several. Black Ops, Capitol pilots, ratters, industrialists, etc. You'll find your niche. 
---
Whether you join us or not, I really recommend you join a corp. It's too easy to get frustrated when alone. 
---
Fly safe!

Best part was, you could fit two painters on them and still have enough room for a modest shield tank.
---
Well I can assure you life can get better. I had a couple year rough patch myself. Life can be a bit of a bitch, we all struggle with our own demons. Don’t give up cause you have a rough patch.  Don’t choose a permanent solution to a temporary problem. If I ended it I wouldn’t of met my wife or met my son. You and I can’t see the future.  You’re future is brighter then you can imagine. We have to give life enough time to reach the points where it’s blissful and beautiful. Join the Broadcast for reps channel.   I hope for the best for you bro.  Please don’t give in or give up! Plus we all gotta be around to see eve actually die. You are worth it.
---
He is saying to make them so they don't show up
---
&gt; so .... skill points for logging in from here on out?
---
as long as i don't have to do the tedious "warp to tutorial anomaly, kill 1 rat, dock up again" dance - yes please. they are better when i can just mass launch the clients and hit redeem + exit.
---
Tbh they should make a light and heavy variant of cyno ship, and nothing else should be able to fit cynos, especially not capitals
---
Would do a lot to hurt the blue umbrellas of having dozens of supers out ratting with an instant backup button
---
Fuck yesssssss, bring those changes and my five accounts are subbed!
---
Lmao okay retard
---
I want to use bombers to blow up other people's PI.
---
No longer content with being a Donut, the powers that be in nullsec formed...The Hamburger.
---
Opposing sides of red and blue formed the soft and moist bread wrap that keeps your stomach full.
---
In-between them the greasy, cow meat of empire space that was butchered, chopped, grinded and formed into and easy to devour patty of content.
---
Only $4.99 at Spacey's as a combo meal with an Very Large Wormhole Soda.
---
Spacey's, it's good food.... in space.
---
&gt; Farms are going nowhere, we're the steady income
---
and even at jita prices they are profitable, BEFORE you even consider using their 5m base SP for passive income like research/reactions/etc
---
if you can source your plex below jita and sell injectors above jita then that cash cow just gets more plump
---
Dont goons have a very flat structure to prevent backstabbing? As in very little delegation of responsibility? I wouldn't call that trust. I'd call it no line goon being able to do fuck all to influence corp.
---
Thats older than old at this point :D
---
Pretty sure he was referencing fuel usage thought.
---
I need more of this in my Eve!
---
Cat ears for Drifters
---
When the clone bay is active your titan is immobile. Immobile titans tend to not last very long in deep areas of hostile space if people know about it. 
---
The reason that clone vat bays don't have any place on titans when it comes to sneaking stuff around is that bridges do the same thing. And you can bring a lot more in via the bridge. If you really want to be sneaky you use wormholes. 
---
There was something about a year or more ago where someone jumped their Rorqual into a hostile space, kicked on the clone bay, people jumped to it, boarded mining ships out of the SMB and started mining. Locals responded, everything died, but it was fun for them. Those kinds of things are very rare.
---
Yeah, but there's always somebody ratting. It doesn't mean a whole corp lives there. Hek, I think a few systems in Geminate are still owned by a small Corp that nobody has bothered to evict.
---
Osrs features a polling system where players can vote on certain changes to the game so the devs get insight on whether the community would like it or not. 
---
Why doesn’t eve have any feature like this? Ofcourse some changes need to be made by the dev team and the dev team alone but not every single one of them
---
I suppose?
---
"The Jita sec status shift of 2020 was a sight to behold. Endless JF deaths and enough salt for a million chipperies."  
---
I for one would love it.
---
Make trig ships start super weak and ramp up extremely slowly, like 0.01% per 15 seconds or something, but have literally no damage cap for anything in the game. ez clap.
---
Lots of people say to record your pvp fights to watch later. How?
---
Do you have a screenshot or a bug tracker number?
---
I've already joined them and asked questions. But nobody has given me a fit yet...
---
Goons used to be the salt mining trolls of Eve. Now they're boring twats. I blame mittens.
---
Stop! I can only get so erect!!
---
We've had a few roaming gangs visit delve today. We need more to come though.  And they need to bring dreads, battle rorqs, and ss carriers. Bring all of those...especially dreads. We fear them and will just let whomever you drop them on die. We promise. Remember..... goons are afraid of your dread bombs. So bring them to delve. Lots more of them please.
---
Oh sorry the sarcasm wasn't apparent in my post
---
That or the next round of NPC AI is about to be unleashed. Sounds like empire NPCs are converting into capsuleers (Diamond NPCs)
---
Like food
---
Good, escalate! People losing ships is what we want. A stale economy isn't, which goons have contributed to massively.
---
&gt; probably-wont-break-your-shit-character-copierator
---
still better chances of it actually **not** breaking your shit compared to CCP solutions...
---
Pax Sex, he’s way more deadly.
---
severely limit jump drives and portals, including ansiblex gates. In both distance travelled as frequency of use.
---
Ships with jump drives or portals can only jumps to an adjacent system, once a jump drive, portal or gate is used there's a cool down of 1 hour to use a next one.
---
This is the shit I'm interested in. 
---
These Chorus nerds might wind up being the antagonist in Nova. Could it be The Other just relocating in the wake of Jamil's death? Maybe a failed integration of Sleeper/Drifter implants?
---
Eh I don't entirely agree. I've had some of the best fights in my eve  career since the blackout began. Now it just tends to be folk willing to shoot back rather than ratters or explorers trying to run away. Now I have to actually effectively use a scout alt to dscan and see what is in system, rather than just looking in local for targets. I dont mind that.
---
Make the blackout permanent.
---
for real, can ccp disallow mobile structure anchoring in jita like citadels? shit is fucking disgusting
---
Viator has the smallest decloak shere out of the Blockade Runners.
---
Amarr has probably the best looking freighter, especially the JF with the original gold/red skin
---
An afk Myrmidon takes 3 forsaken hubs to pay itself off. If it takes 1 hour to run 3 Forsaken Hubs then you've risked losing 45mil ISK for an hour. After that those first 3 sites there is no risk in losing any ISK value. How is that not worth the risk?
---
XD I think its more that you are the only guys that are fighting back. Had some nice roams the last few days around D-PN. The last roams to the north just resulted in some afk kills and getting dropped by supers while we fielded just a few frigates ;)
---
because 45m isk/hour is piss poor and can be eclipsed by doing activities that don't require you to put anything at risk for an hour or longer?
---
Hurting aryth is probably a bad idea.
---
Give me all your shit first
---
There's a few ways to record but it isn't within the game client itself. You'll have to Google that one.
---
Also those scanning skills do somewhat help later on down the track if you move on from explo to explo hunting. Or if you're just wandering around null looking for people/ things to shoot. Combat probes help a lot in that regard.
---
Triglavian colussus ship that is warpable sturcture which can only shoot other structures
---
Have drones fit in high slots like normal weapons, but instead of destroyed they redock and go through a repair process.
---
Make these drones work on the rules of guns, but instead of optimal and falloff, have control range and attack speed be a factor.
---
Further out they attack slower because of signal noise, close in they attack like normal.
---
Get them to train into missile boats. That's prob best if you're trying to take on sites. Draw aggro with the vets and have the newer guys come in to take out frigs.
---
T3D not C. Jackdaw is the caldari T3 Destroyer and yeah it's pretty damned good for FW. I think there's good fits on Eve Uni, but they might be outdated.
---
Someone already answered as you can see, but I hope to see you around! Zam Slam in game, I’ll keep an eye out for your application!
---
This would be great.
---
It only took 3 different skillpoint events to solidify their agenda!!
---
imagine crying about making 45mil fully afk.
---
but forreals a mixup of gates is in order
---
They've been well known to pull metrics out of their ass to push an agenda, they could be totally fabricated because again, they're not above pushing fake shit even when \*the proof is widely available\*.  I've lost count the number of times CCP employees have been caught in a lie that can be debunked by publicly available information.
---
Yes, the game can be confusing, yes, there is a lot to learn, there are a lot of things that relate to a lot of other things, yes, you should "man up" and get going. If you play the game as a free to play character and you don't enjoy it, at least you gave it a try, if you do enjoy it, you've found an awesome game with great depth. Try enjoy the game and learn a little bit at a time, even experienced players usually specialize in a few activities, and they do it well, and often don't have the how to knowledge to do other things.  
---
A nullsec carrier pve player might make amazing isk in game and be far along, but may not know how to mine in a rorqual efficiently and do industry on a large scale. There are many examples I could use.  
---
press f12 in game, and do the starter agents, it will give you a taste of a few activities to do in game, and you can find more information on youtube for any activity you like, or just browse it to see what you might like.   
---
Here is a chart of things you can do in game, don't be daunted at the size of it, just look through at your leisure at anything that you think you may be interested in, and then investigate.

---
Good luck, and have fun.
---
imagine making 45m when there are easier and more profitable options.
---
&gt;go do that on your own or make it happen.
---
what the fuck are you even trying to say here? There are 4 major alliance bloc corps that do exactly that EVERY DAY.
---
Try upgrading to a heavy interdictor? They have a lot of EHP and might work.
---
Make a script for hictor bubbles that jams cynos
---
I had kind of a similar thought... every region has local pirates that roam the area... my thought was that CCP could replace the regular rat AI with the "diamond" rat AI, and they would behave based on the standings of the pilots, corps, alliances attempting to live in the area.  Sigs and anomalies would spawn in 3 flavours:  local pirate rats, neutral rogue drone rats and enemies of the local pirate rats.  If you have good enough standings with the local rats, they don't shoot you and possibly will aid you as the current diamond rats do.  If you have "not good enough" standings (negative, neutral or below a certain threshold) the local rats will shoot you, the way they do now.
---
This would make standings matter for something, and make ratting more involved than "stack appropriate resists to tank, deal appropriate damage to kill" as rats would behave more like the diamond rats with some level of logi etc.  Rats will always respond to the lowest standing level (personal, corp or alliance) so the rats will attack a player who has low standings but is in a corp with high standings (or a player with good standings in a corp with low standings) making your actions and how you decide to PvE in your home space.  If your corp and alliance keep good standings with the local rats, they will assist you.  If you don't, they will randomly form fleets and shoot at structures etc similar to what the drifters did (but less extreme because fuck what the drifters were doing) with a higher likelyhood of low-power stuff being shot first, but any structure is fair game.  On the other side of the coin, if you have good standings with the local rats, you will have to deal with the enemies of the local rats attacking, but with less frequency and they would target low-power structures more often. This would help deal with structure spam and afk corps/alliances.  You will have to live in the space you own, to a certain extent.
---
I'm not trying to advocate for an increase in nulsec anomalies or anything like that, keep it as it currently is, but make anomalies and ratting in general more dangerous and give a greater variety of rats to hunt.  If you want to be enemies with the locals, you will have more stuff to shoot but with more dangerous consequences.  If you make friends with the locals it will be more safe but you have somewhat less opportunity to generate income in your own backyard.
---
This would be a huge change but it would shake things up and make some consequences for what you do.
---
Probably a shit idea for reasons I haven't thought of yet.
---
Considering Falcon has been caught in a lie more times than I can count, acting like his word debunks anything is lol.
---
Not true!  Why would having 3 seperate "LOGIN PLZ" events taint login numbers?!   Everyone wants to get their 360M ticks without help!!!111!1one
---
Yes, and be at the whim of other people not really doing much to teach you. Just string you along on their plans.
---
Be cannon fodder.
---
make fireworks 0 fitting reqs so everything with a useless highslot can have fireworks
---
You don't have to work there to look at their fucking track record and history.  They CONSTANTLY misrepresent metrics, and now people magically think "oh but they're telling the truth this time!"  Hi 360m ticks.
---
I mean, it's been working out for them over the last 5 years, right?  They only had to fire most of their staff and sell out to a Korean company...they know business!
---
Having the perspective of having done this for a decade, I can tell you that this is one of the moments where we look at what our devs do and less of what they say
---
More active users after blackout, as expected.
---
People whining blackout making less online user = bad change, the statistic suggest otherwise: All the long log-in time (presumably bots) are kicked and game is again filled with fresh humans. It has matched my experience as skirmish happen much more often after blackout, funs are had.
---
YES
---
Make npc nullsec great again. Make stain, syndicate, venal, maybe even outer ring places worth the time. Also that thunkkar or whatever region.
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; Dont goons have a very flat structure to prevent backstabbing? As in very little delegation of responsibility? 
---
We have just the opposite. It takes a lot of people to keep Goonswarm running. Without delegation we couldn't scale.
---
Give one to venal too
---
Cat ears for structures
---
I cannot confirm not deny the details of that statement
---
Just saying, ALL the carriers were WE FORM V0LTA, + 5 friends who joined for funsies, Snuff was in a mach fleet indeed, but had 0 capitals on grid.
---
Please less narrative &amp; more facts.
---
This is a whinge about cyno-based defense fleets from 2014.
---
https://www.eveproguides.com/force-projection-killing-eve/
---
What happened is that first Goons, then Legacy, and now the Northern Coalition got good at cyno-based home defense.
---
The response from "elite PvP" has been to whine, and then to copy.
---
Notice how the 2014 whine was about "triage carriers" ? Those are the actual key to effective home defense - that and having ratting ships with enough buffer to survive long enough for the reps to land (which, with power creep on the offensive side has now means anything less tanked than a rorq or a super does not qualify).
---
Yes. I get it. You want kills. Defense fleets stopped you getting them, so you went after Excavator drones instead.
---
And now people are responding to the blackout by pulling excavators and using t2 drones.
---
BTW, have a look at these stats from 2014 - scroll down to the very bottom and you'll see PVE kills per system. 
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats/2014-07
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats/2019-05
---
Interesting, huh. Despite the issues with 24/7 botting, supercap ratting and so on, the systems with the highest numbers of NPC kills are only up by about double.
---
Add a constellation of NPC sov (with stations) to every conquerable nullsec region.
---
Someone has to herd the cats in a social online game. Got it? ;)
---
Get rid of asset safety. Get rid of NPC null stations so people can't just store there stuff there. When you blow up a station, 50% of assets randomly drop. That will give people reasons to go to war, and defend their space.
---
Have NPC factions in nullsec anchor destructible citadels. If you blow them up then after some time they'll attempt to anchor another one.
---
Ability to set default skin for capsules.
---
Did the mods hide this thread? Can't view it anymore from /r/eve's front page.

Good bot
---
There still has to be *some* safe way to take breaks. If they remove that, they’ve got to realize that they’ll *permanently* lose people who intermittently play, and often even keep paying while they don’t play.

Remove the ability to warp at 0 from all gates like the old days.

1. Rorq Mining
---
You have described 3 things you can do in null sec to provide yourself with an income, 3 things with all of the other options available and you state that "they" have basically taken away everything for you to do as a relatively new pilot in nullsec. I don't know whether I should laugh at the ridiculousness of that statement or cry.
---
Not just that but you choose to do the 3 things that require as little actual playing on your part as possible. Rorq mining with excavators should not be considered something a relatively new pilot in nullsec should do.
---
&gt; I (enjoyed) playing eve
---
No my friend you enjoyed not playing Eve.
---
The world moves on. If you can't enjoy it how it is now or can't find something out of all the different options available to you in this game to enjoy than I suppose that's the end for you. Pack you bags and move off and from those of us that actually play the game I promise, we won't miss you.

*Rapid Acceleration Mission Module and Engine Reconfiguration* (RAMMER):
---
- Low Slot Module
---
- Briefly accelerates your ship to 500% of its normal speed, aimed in the direction of travel at start.
---
- Reduces all shield and armor resistances to 0.
---
- If your ship drops below 50% of its normal speed at any point, you promptly explode dealing massive AoE damage.
---
- Damage dealt is calculated based on the combined EHP of your vessel
---
- At the end of your "attack run", if you haven't exploded yet your ship self-destructs due to the massive power core and engine overloading required.
---
- Maybe can further boost damage dealt by filling your cargo hold with explosives (Missiles, ammo, hydrogen, enriched uranium, etc).
---
Ok thats once, if they constantly do it can you give me 10 examples?  That's less than one a year.
---
Use links to actual data to disprove what you think they're exaggerating.
---
They broadcast logged in users.  Not *active* users.
---
I don't think there are many pilots in this game that looks at a ship and say, "there is zero way I can win this fight, I'm going to fight it a huge disadvantage with no hope of killing it unless it self destructs."
---
I mean in all honesty I think most pvp in this game is about taking fights you can win rather than fights you can lose. If you look at most pvp help threads and even the LS frigate google doc (which is an awesome resource) they all speak about learning your engagement profile and knowing what to fight and when to leave or not engage at all.
---
Lmao
---
I award you no points.
---
Or just grab a combat recon and contribute to the chaos.
---
Lots of vets have absolutely terrible, no fun, min-max oriented advice to give. "X is literally worthless as an activity because Y is 13.5% more efficient isk/hour, don't bother with it" "just join a null empire, you'll be safe" (which is exactly what hisec mining corps once did to funnel the new players to them, and goons partially rebelled against that with hulkageddon, BTW), "don't bother with X space, there's no content there" (I've found that everywhere and everything has some community to get involved with however small, and someone is always doing something the "right way" even in more or less broken areas like FW for instance), etc.
---
In general, many vets portray EVE as a game with much more limited possibilities than it really is, because lots of activities don't make as much isk/lp/whatever as what they do or it doesn't suit their play style. Everyone wants to tell you what's "actually worth doing" and say shit like "pve is aids, mining is aids, pvpers are really just pussies who gank and grief" depending on what particular axe they're grinding.
---
Honestly an experienced gamer who is new to eve is exactly the non-jaded, fresh perspective that reflects the sense of awe and wonderment EVE is meant to convey better than a bittervet explaining the golden 14 for the thousandth time. There is plenty of time to look up technical videos about specific subjects, but I've always believed that many vets in this game are the absolute worse for inspiring new players, unless they're the type to gift out a stack of frigs and take someone roaming, or something similar. 
---
I personally can't stand pve, but after the economy achieves a healthy balance again, we're still gonna need pve people and those potential players don't need to be told mining is aids, they need to see a fellow noob ninja mining in lowsec with some risk and engagement so we can start setting expectations for what the games is about other than "b-line straight to the most efficient build and start multiboxing within 6 months" type content. The eve base optimizes the fun out of fucking everything, why would we want new players being herded into stale play styles and soulless megablocs, which is what many vets do.
---
Successful companies like Gaijin Entertainment prove that just because you have data doesn't mean shit.
---
Or are suspicious of CCP carefully selecting what data to share in the interview, rather than giving a full overview of what's happening.
---

---
I'm infinitely more in favour of that, then attackers getting paid for setting up a few AFK Oracles. If you want a pay-day, go evict a wormhole. I'm sure you won't because that's *effort*, and wormholers are likely to actually fight back. 
---
&gt; Now with asset safety and citadels you can have billions of ISK in  capitals with no limit no upkeep and all safe. You can accumulate too  many things. To have such much weapons of war you need fuel to power  them, the fact that you can just have titans lying around is not natural  and not good gameplay. Something needs to be done, it's not natural,  it's not eve. 
---
I agree with Falcon here. I don't like the fact that every structure gets it for free, regardless how how many people are there or how much stuff is there. I want an upkeep cost for Asset Safety, a way to differentiate between structures with AS and those without. It adds choices and consequences for the structure owner.
---
You think CCP would admit problems/failures asap and initiate a subscriber failcascade willingly?
---
Pilots in this game generally don't engage ships they know they can't kill. That isn't a new fact.
---
Lol Hilmar said there was 16,000 new players every week yet never mentioned the retention rate.
---
Couple of ideas that lean heavily on AOE
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Idea 1 ( Repair heat damage within AOE ):
---
- High slot ( same logic as Interdictors )
---
- Takes large amounts of paste per cycle ( 128 or more whatever is a good balance )
---
- Deploys a nanite repair cloud with X KM radius ( let's say 10Km , again to be balanced )
---
- While ships remain in the cloud their modules repair at a rate congruent with their nanite repair skills.
---
- Modules can still run / overheat while in the repair cloud. The assumption here is that heat damage is always greater than the ability to repair it ( I believe this to be the case ).
---
- Basically if done correctly, fleets can overheat for longer ... potentially giving them an advantage if they leverage this ability better than opposing fleet.
---
Idea 2 ( Triglavian filament dispersion):
---
- Takes filaments as ammo ( all tiers .. the higher the tier the stronger the effect ).
---
- Deploys "filament clouds" with the same effects as found in the abyssal space. i.e. load up a firestorm filament ... and deploy a cloud that reduces thermal resistance but increases armor ... the strength proportionate to the tier.
---
Honestly this is the most likely suggestion for them to run with
---
rebalance the ship classes so BS are actually capital ships and EHP scaling isn't so absolutely crazy
---
&gt;You can't out drop, or out spend people like us.  We can escalate farther and worse the you ever can. If you fight back we will obliterate you. 
---
You're talking about goons / n+1. *Shrug*most people are having fun and the game is thriving because of it. Nullbears will adapt or go back to hs.
---
The economy will adjust itself as supply and demand changes. The less supply, the more valuable it will become to risk null more.
---
It all works out. Enjoy it!
---
Goodbye carebear! Ccp has made eve great again! MEGA!!!
---
Tbf shield active resists are already great, being able to heat an Adaptive invuln field is dope. You'd then have to add active eanms and lol that's a bad idea
---
Just like in Sins of a Solar Empire lmao.
---
Make battleships fleet again... how? rework bombers remove the bombs we have now and give them more ewar type bombs a bit like the projected superweapons or have an EM bomb lower the EM resist of the target for a small time etc. We cant brawl in battleships because we get bombed and the fight is over. The bombers should be auxiliary to a fleet not the main dps and they will still have their spot as cloaky torp bombers which are awesome in a blackout.

It is hilarious how much faith the average tard on this forum puts into CCP when they've been consistently demonstrating for the last 5+ years that such faith is unfounded.
---
Now I want this just to see aryth abuse it.
---
Chill out. Most people are happy with their lives.
---
I mean, it doesn't help that basically every Null change in the last few years has been top retard level and basically did break null a little more than it was previously.
---
It's been pretty damn fun and active all over null
---
This except for real, hic inhibitor or a ship that does this.

Yeah the indi players have stopped and the bots remain active mostly.

Ah yes, ~~suspicious player~~ conspiracy theorists

Just blow up the structure and get all the loo-

Yeah maybe noobs shouldn't be in null, which is supposed to be very dangerous. Ya ever think about that? Cause you sound like a nullbear

Or they could be full of shit trying hype up the game.

You actually have to play a match of WWF No Mercy from the N64 when this occurs.

---
Are you sure you know how many conflicts are taking place in null right now? Cause it's a fucking lot!
---
Gatecamps are just horrid design, so I feel ya man.
---
Bring local to wormholes.

The drifters stole it from null and placed it there

I mean, that's what happens when you have a history as a company of faking data...

If you have Nvidia shadowplay the instant replay feature on that is really good.

&gt; People who said they were unsubbing their 50 accounts didn't actually unsub and things actually stabilised after awhile they were just taken out of their comfort zone temporarily and needed that push. (Shocked pikachu face)
---
Actually - I have cancelled my sub - admittedly it is not 50 accounts. Had I known about the changes before I paid for a year, I would have stopped it there and then... I have the time to see what happens, but if I have to - I will either stop playing, or go alpha

Investigate joining Signal Cartel. They’re focused on explo and PvE and might be your cup of tea, at least for now

shut the fuck up faggot

Why has PLEX not dropped in price since the blackout?
---
Lots of ganks here, friend.
---
Legit went in a bomber fleet after i linked that.
---
I dont think I will ever be able to play again, but thank god for this mentality. Eve was a desert in the sense of Antarctica, the scarcity is content because it is locked up and frozen, not because it is unavailable.
---
This reads like a fever dream.
---
Is it 1 bil ISK though?
---
t2s.   
---
Your industrial skills directly effect which t2 industrial ships (blockade runners and deep space transports) you can use later in the game. The Bustard, as an example, has a drastically different setup than the Impel, and one is very good at one style of play while the other is not. This is important for the shipping goods if you go into that field.   
---
Occator and Viator (Gallente t2 industrial ships) aren't the best of the group. That's not to say they're bad, they have their strengths, but  I prefer the To use the Impel for my DST and the Crane for my BR. Once you get access to DST's, the faction t1 industrial transports become, essentially, moot.   
---
All of the DST's carry just over 62,500 m\^3 with max skills, regardless of fitting, with wildly higher tank than the t1 version.
---
It's just a strange reward, when arguably the new player would benefit far more having a booster than an older player. VoV
---
the fourth is the :eyeroll: i just did and life suddenly isn't so simple anymore
---
If this does not give you hope for EVE the you are a lost cause!
---
table*
---
“Our poll numbers are the best”
---
“We are winning big”
---
“This is a HUGE success”
---
I have enough of this in real life. Can we just be honest with eveoffline numbers for once in game?
---
Make defender missiles cost as much fitting as a large turret, so people can choose, protect themselves against bombers or being optimal against others BS?
---
And make this launcher really easy to see on a hull, so “look at” intel taked can be more important.
---
And give fitting bonus for destroyers for them.
---
All of those places are worth their time though (Except maybe outer ring, wtf is there aside from good moons?) :thinking:
---
Its like they dont understand their own game, but what do you expect from a guy that spent a year in Wormholes and another guy who played in Low Sec, but of course the problem is NullSec.  You can't nerf good leadership and organization.
---
Coz just like with VNI gives ng cruisers 5 heavy drones is a good idea. Dont think any cruiser should field the same drones as a bs.
---
Yeah, I find it hilariously ironic that CCP just now realized that they fucked up their own game with all these changes over the years.
---
If you have friends who already play the game you are in a great situation. Eve is a game where you need other players to teach you the basics and a fun group to play with. It sucks if you try to grind it alone.
---
Are you a prince in some west african country by chance?:)
---
Jk, it sounds fun if its legit. And one cant know until they actually give it a chance.
---
if multiboxing gets you ahead in some way then anyone not multiboxing is at a disadvantage. If you then decide to restrict multiboxing then the players who have reaped advantages will have a lead over everyone else who didn't cash in while they had the chance. This usually boils down to veterans maintaining the long term effects of a bygone benefit while newer players lose out.

---
How likely is past membership in one SovNull entity to get you blacklisted from another?
---
Take Jin'taan, for example. He first became well-known in Provi. But since then, he's been in TEST and INIT. Would someone who isn't a famous YouTuber be able to jump around between coalitions as easily?
---
Turn Jita into a FFA for 24 hours, say CONCORD have gone on strike over lack of exotic dancers on the market or something ... Would be so much fun!
---
Make the dockable and the way to control them is have dust bunnies fight over them. Just have them roam system to system and be indestructable. I mean ffs the lore has been hinting at a Thukker one since forever.
---
I believe because thematically they all have 8 slots, and a ship with 8 BS-missiles would be really strong since most BS have 5-6 launchers
---
Armor gets a rig for this, whereas shields do not, fwiw
---
bring back mobile siphon units
---
Jackdaws are destroyers, not cruisers. They're great for FW mission blitzing, though. Every time I see one on a LowSec roam, I don't assume it's a threat. I am rarely wrong.
---
And make it have higher chance of officer spawns in belts to incentivise actually living there (and being in belts)
---
That is not a bug it's a feature.
---
Remind them that the mining fleet is what enables the PVP fleets?
---
Security missions.
---
Yeah you're right actually, I'm being dumb. I'll blame the long gap since I was last active... :)
---
&gt;I need to see the data.
---
No, you don't need to see the data. 
---
There is no reason for anyone to see the data.
---
WTF is wrong with people?
---
Awesome mate, now I need to replicate that for my every character and push online to make available for my other PCs
---
So you kinda missed that one time they nerfed fighter damage because of what was it 260m ticks? Which was in fact a guy who got back to back dread spawns, a phenomena which is so rare its not even worth mentioning. Yet that became the basis for the entire nerf.
---
CCP has proven themselves to not be all that trustworthy and willing to use outliners as proof. And you are now shocked that people arent really buying into what they are saying?
---
Im not saying that they 100% have done it in this case but the timing of the login event was really shitty since it messed with the only number we could see. And since they havent realised any other data its hard to just sit there and accept what theyre saying. It cant be verified.
---
Your assumption is completely bonkers.
---
CCP doesn't have investors anymore, they have a single owner.
---
I just want to name my drones. That way I know which one is screwing up on "focus fire" and needs to be put in timeout. (I always seem to have one drone whose AI should have ridden the short bus for some reason.)
---
Yep, this also, that way, Bjorn bee can always have his Steve
---
HTFU
---
Really? Because Pearl Abyss still has a big chunck of CCP. That is not an assumption. That is fact.
---
Which one? There were two. I don't live full-time in Null, so I can't say anything about Drifters. But Triglavians (not the thing that made news not specific to the game, that was the Drifters because the big NullBlocs were complaining about how it ruined their krabbing and made them call off a war) are definitely still going. There was an invasion from them in my area a few days ago. I haven't seen any Drifters on the Null roams that I've done since Blackout, though.
---
Yes, it is. 
---
That's why your assumption is nuts.
---
&gt;Something needs to be done, it's not natural, it's not eve.
---
Hilmar, on heterosexuality

And now think about how skill yourself just disbanded and some biomassed their everything. Lul.

260m ticks.
---
It is a storage hold illegally modified to be a pleasure dome.

I'll give you hardcore hell game! Divide total char sp pool into a "stable", trained one, and a "volatile" injected one. Make volatile sp have a chance to poof on podding.

Armour hacs. ARMOUR HACS!
---
Can it fit CovOps cloak?
---
Who has shitloads of asstets? Bitter vets.
---
Who has limited assets? Newbros.
---
Remove asset safety.
---
You dont know how businesses work. Pearl Abyss has invested several hundred million into CCP. 80% of the company is being used as leverage. If PA doesn't get their money back and then some, they kick Hilimar out and put someone in who will make them money.
---
Triglavian T3C
---
What are those?
---
Yaen boring
---
Remove jump bridges and replace them with wormhole generators, that generates a connection to a random wormhole and a connection to the wanted system inside the wormhole.
---
i.e Start -&gt; Random wormhole system -&gt; Destination
---
New "glass cannon" ship class.  Large area effect/spash damage like bombs.  1x use and they self destruct AND the pilot loses skill points like with t3 cruisers.  Maybe also make the ship specific skill "un-injectible" somehow in a similar way to PI skills not being "extract-able".
---
I love this game.
---
&gt; 80% of the company is being used as leverage.
---
That part is over. 
---
&gt; If PA doesn't get their money back and then some, they kick Hilimar out and put someone in who will make them money.
---
Well, obviously.

Lol crawl out of Falcons ass for a bit and take a breath.

CCP\_Falcon do you have a update? since its not in here yet :( [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQvKSs1k6DLNVABOZO-cFlDWwMnKIgcoN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQvKSs1k6DLNVABOZO-cFlDWwMnKIgcoN)

Being called captain retard by grath, the irony is palpable, why don't you go crying abck to wormholes because you aren't good enough for null.
---
time to undo anom ihub upgrades
---
strike the earth. me too. thanks for that quill....yeeez
---
And they are so smug about it. And talking about retention numbers like theyve done shit to fix that, like ever. They only have those numbers because NS groups started recruiting new players.
---
Hearing the actual soundclip is like hearing a sketch.
---
thank you very much!
---
CONCORD strikes for a couple days/weeks randomly!
---
Love to see this sort of thing from a newer/casual player. Keep it up bud.
---
I've dreamed of a light dreadnought for a while.
---
a ship that is built around a maincannon and it has to "siege" to be able to use it.
---
Something like destroyer sized but with a ridiculous, slow firing long range cannon.
---
You're doing a good job at portraying the other extreme here, and i very much agree thats your case is arguably even worse. But you make it sound like theres nothing in the middle. Are there only newbros and minmaxing bittervets in this game?
---
The whole standings mechanic is a relic from 2005.
---
How was it?
---
Mate all you do is complain about this game. Maybe you should go find something that makes you happy, since it's clearly not this.
---
Soo if they make Null sec more dangerous than WH can we at last get the same isk/hour ?   
---
No more asset safety in null sec , ressource depletion, API dalayed (ennemy can bash your structures like a ninja) no local , drifters roam/bash/gatecamp   
---
i'm ok with that but what the point be in null sec then ? moon ? lel they are boring AF / take too much time, ratting ? don't worth anything abyss/FW pay much more and with ressource depletion super farm under an umbrella aren't gonna exist anymore   
---
i don't even farm in NS but in FW ratting in NS is boring mining is boring but i love war and pvp structure bash probably gonna be a thing for the first month but then ? what gonna force anyone to fight ?
---
they should just remove the anchoring option when in jita
---
I was in TEST is 2011 and 2012. This version of them is nothing like they were back then under Montolio.
---
I want a 5-pylon Hulk.
---
Honestly I think a lot of people are starting to not give a shit about what goes on in delve. You're all playing a different game out there. If you want to play eve, go to 90% of space, if you want to play a minmax pve game there's reservation space for nulblocs who think they're top dogs because they've optimized themselves out of the game. I've never cared less about what the blocs are up to in the ten+ years I've played on and off. All your big wars are basically pathetic "content generation" playfights and don't make gaming news anymore, so what are you but your own player created hisec factions? I don't care about your salt with the hunters, even. Just not my ecosystem, it's just a bland grindfest. It'd be great if we could weaken you guys so your play style doesn't allow you to dictate political conditions for the rest of the playerbase though.
---
That one died.   now they have a set of rapidly rotating ones, and some of those have gotten there by breaking tradition in big ways.
---
DST also known as Jita Space Transport because elsewhere you're a sitting duck or a prime target, like any other hauler really.
---
So this is what you do while you're cloaked
---
In April, the first month OMEGA gets 50% off, and if you invite 20 accounts by yourself, which is legal, you can get approx. 9000 PLEX + \~6B isk items. That's only 150 dollar. That's crazy. I think this is why they adjust that.
---
Mashallah
---
If you can scan wrecks you can camp the escalation with a recon and wait for them to come back.  Bad idea.
---
Less targets for you, check!
---
And then we get Adversity or other clowns launching a bunch of "Fat Man"'s and "Little Boy"'s, no thank you.
---
again, if you think free sp is a factor, then may that gave out a woopin 1.25m sp should have been the best in the history of the game, considering that in june you get less than half, and more than half of it on your first day login, no, sp is not the reason people log in, also pve may be down, but there are other activities like pvp or explo that are up, and ofc bot infested regions like cobalt or other drone regions are down in activity cause there is no local, renters would be the first that would bail in case of a blackout
---
\+1 for comment, would give another +1 if possible just for Earth and Beyond. 
---
Big. Strong. Wow. TADA-O.

But who doesn't like little boys 😂😏😂😉

Yup.
---
I love every single instructional video you make. Literally use them to go to sleep. Please don't stop making these videos. Hell, make a corp, many will fight for you.
---
You'd definitely split up goons that way, the nerdsweat aroma has to be overwhelming in 1DQ keep.
---
The old north coalition.. Those were good days
---
I am honestly awaiting with glee for the Loki to be nerfed into the ground. Also buff the Proteus so it is viable again!
---
Also, please for the love of God remove the kinetic damage lock on caldari ships in general.
---
As a fellow explorer I got started with this video
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g88u9dMDZ7Y&amp;t=13s
---
This video goes through all the basics of eve online hacking and the rule of 6's to make hacking easier.
---
 For doing the sites it all depends on where you are in eve online. Each sector of space has it's own loot tables for both data and relic sites. Sasha's nation for instance has amazing relic sites and not so good data sites.
---
Add the vni rep bonus to all navy cruisers. Make the wolf able to fit its slots.
---
Create a module to swap a low slot for a medium one.
---
Balance the navy bs, now are worthless.
---
Nerf the gallente hull ships, too op with hulk and armor tanks.
---
Buff med missiles and projectile weapons.
---
False reports. Would be hilarious!
---
Make cloak and cyno use the same fuel type. Thus  you cannot stay cloaked forever, and less so if you have a cyno fitted.
---
But make it fair-ish, like 60 fuel per hour, that should give roughly 4 hours of continuous cloak.
---
You can't get the site pinpointed if the runner leaves before the scan is complete.  Allowing wrecks to be scanned would make it possible to pinpoint and steal/camp any escalation.
---
Have an hour of Jita and Perimeter being NPC Null. if you want to cyno in carriers to hit anyone on the undock, go ahead. If you want to bring an Avatar to put into the Keepstar for some entertainment at the next time it happens, go ahead.
---
I'm not in goons, but escalating just causes daily rage filled "a cap killed me and I didn't like it" threads begging the devs to nerf anything above cruisers.
---
People seem to think blob killing supers/Rorqs/ventures/a lone ibis is great dank PvP, but when capitals show up in greater numbers than 1, and they lose their OP cloaky Loki, something is wrong with the game.
---
It's such hypocrisy. 
---
And then the credit card warriors buy ISK to afford a few more T3C's, and act like anyone who grinds to replace losses/make ISK is playing the game wrong.
---
Because bot numbers plummeted
---
lets just say i have since a 100mil sp toon cause i came from SC here to scratch the space itch :P
---
Ccp already monitors if your multiboxing. The launcher is setup to help you multibox, they let you start your character accounts in groups and link them. Ccp is pro-multi boxing so long as you pay for omega, not against.
---
 You are suggesting they do the opposite of what they have been doing.
---
Whats the counter play to everybody running and hiding until they have an overwhelming response force?
---
Cause i gotta tell you pretty much everybody thinks that was not fun.
---
I think the Proteus has its place in the wardec gate and station camp meta too.
---
I think that'd be overkill, we'd have non-stop Boson Titans on the 4-4 undock.
---
That brings the income closer together, you still need the incentive to put a 12 billion Ship in a Belt. If it’s going to be the same income putting two hulks in a belt over a rorqual and standby FAX then that’s a lose for the Whalers
---
Would certainly be interesting to see how the market responds.
---
Skill injectors add their sp value gradually over 30 days, max  5 injectors active at once
---
Wh moons get high end moon goo but detonating a  rock acts as a heavy magnet for possible connections

The salt in local from the WoW immigrants would be beautiful!
---
What a stupid statement,  replaced with who?
---
I've been thinking about asking for help in Jita local because I've looked all over New Eden and can't find Mankrik's wife.
---
Warp core stabilized to +9. It's totally possible to scram, but I haven't been caught by a low sec gate camp actually ready to do that.
---
 Yet....
---
The two Hels were actually off grid for the majority of the subcap fight. They were brought in to Panic the Rorqs, and left grid during the hold down, and later returned to break the FAX on grid, that would have tanked both fleets indefinitely. As a result both supers only got on the a [pair](https://i.imgur.com/SyM7fRJ.png) of FAX kills, ^(the ones they were brought in to counter), and were used exactly as they should be.
---
Provi's mach losses were down to poor target selection, instead of chewing through the DPS Brutix fleet to let their FAX stabilise them, they instead went after sig-tanking Loki's at 0
---
Provi actually had a wild time trying to probe down the pair of Hels whist off-grid and were considering abandoning their Rorqs if an opportunity arose to combat a single caught super
---
^(I'd not usually throw something like this together, but OP's lack of any AAR really didn't do anything justice, It was a fun engagement, rather than anything reddit worthy! OP is braver than I!)
---
i think they did, the retention rate is 10%.
---
And to help counter structure spam, every time your alliance anchors a new structure in a system every other structure of that alliance in the system has a 10% chance to unanchor. This unanchor cannot be cancelled and loot drops as per structure destruction. 
---
This will be checked retroactively on implementation.
---
im alpha for now, training the skills and stuff needed, so when i decide to go omega, i wont have to start from 0 and waste omega time for free content. in all games, that offer p2p stuff, i first go f2p, to see if the game is actually something i plan to get into.   
---
as for your question, well... the same thing happened to paying for games, as paying for porn, the internet.  
---
also, making Eve free to some extent was a choice made by the developers, so if u wanna point fingers and blame someone for people getting something for free, well...  
---
also, if it wasnt for the f2p aspects of the game, a lot of the people you see in the game now, wouldnt be there. me included
---
Lmao you’re wrong with good agility skills you need 3-4 on an occator to do the mwd cloak trick properly
---
That’s fine if you like making multiple trips
---
They're talking out of their ass, the pointers are double width, some instructions are longer and thus some branches might require a far jump, but 64 bit has extra registers so you don't need to load/unload to stack as often, so even if every datatype the software uses is pointer sized (hint: it's unlikely) it won't be nearly double the size
---
All the talk about how 32 bit is magically better is from people that seen some 32 vs 64 bit benchmark from athlon 64 days and can't let go
---
You are bad at eve if that is the case. And I'm talking about a mastodon
---
Good thing I don't fly a mastodon or anything
---
btw i was asking for lowsec gates to stain and venal btw
---
Then what roles do capitals even fill?
---
Stop, I can only get so erect.
---
Inshallah
---
We can gatecamp again, we can pipebomb with the blackout, we do it as a corp and it's a great experience.
---
Also give Interdictors cyno inhibition probes as well as bubble probes.
---
How to make people risk averse 101.
---
I am down for everything except an asset safety change. I don't like the idea of losing all my stuff while i take a break and i don't think people with little to no assets do understand this, nor people who are super wealthy do care about it. But there is an in between group who actually played (hard) to get their stuff and i would 100% uninstall if i lose my assets while i am on an eve-vacation. Just my 2 cents.
---
At that point you can just have my ship.
---
Will chaos extend beyond Null?
---
They even made the display launcher with this intention, but decided it needed to take 1 CPU/pwg
---
T2 faction ships. Angels interceptor. Basically Dramiel on meth. Guristas Marauder.
---
It can't be exploited so it's just going to be swept under the rug unless you can get enough publicity around it.
---
It was, don't you worry.
---
No shit.
---
If you can't think of a reason to have a fax on standby for a Rorqual then you've probably never saved one before. But yeah keep explaining home defense escalations to me if you want, I guess I'm just inexperienced at it.

---
This is very refreshing to read. As a fellow nullseccer in a bosom of blue-donut safety, I say "BRING IT ON!" - maybe it'll get the players who win EVE back into the game rather than them doing the same thing day in, day out muttering "Meh!". 
---
Content is what retains players. No surprise that after a war, a lot of people go AFK.
---
I would pity myself if I would attend. However, I missed the whole thing. Till, the last one I did attend - the goon fight a few days ago - was awesome.
---
If someone escalates and manages to off me before I fuck off, good on them. It's how it is. I'm not going to grind to pay for my ships because I don't like that aspect of the game but I'm sure as shit not going to complain about losing ships to a carrier drop. Shit, I bait and do it to other people too...

Did you guys actually fight and there was local?

Unless their daily users is counting logins by unique individuals. At which point the bot adds 1 and the 5 players add 5.
---
And if one of those 5 players logged in 12 rorqs but the accounts are all linked together at the CCP end then that 1 player adds 1.
---
Numbers from eu and us timezones might be lower then 2014/15 but I am sure numbers in the china timezones has gone up dramatically in the past 2 years. There may be more people playing now then back then, but spread out more over the day.
---
You should add more rewards for retention. For instance if the recruitee subscribed for 3 months or even a year, the payout to the recruiter should be better. 
---
Put real rewards in the game for the recruiter and empower the recruiter so he is motivated to ensure this new recruitee will stay playing the game and have enough tools to work with.

k, so you just drop a couple of astrahuses in enemy staging to win a war in 10 minutes? sounds awesome to me

Go on CCP, you want chaos, change the Stargate map.

Maybe the eve gate does something funky again, I don't care, but imagine if suddenly all the established knowledge and intel tools were useless overnight, and things needed to be discovered again.
---
Not claiming that any of these ideas are good, original or even all mine...  and many/most won't be easy to implement/code/develop.  
---
Combat/Ore Anoms:
---
* Make Pirate Detection Array/Ore Prospecting Array upgrades work as "well" as the Entrapment\\Survey Networks iHub upgrades
---
* \^ That alone should crippled anom spawn rate and randomize it - but be sure it does.
---
* Reverse decision to make all ORE anoms automatically appear in anom list.  Nullsec anoms generated by iHub upgrade need to be scanned down.   Highsec anoms for noobies that automatically populate in scan windows are shitty ore.  Low spawn chance ore anoms in highsec have lowsec ore but need scanning.
---
* Make ore anoms require scanning down again for the hunter and the prospector
---
* Make ore anoms have random content no more predictable layout/quantity/types. If you want "known" repeatable content to the astroid belts with you
---
* Static asteroid belts should also not fully replenish magically at downtime.  You mine it out - it comes back at downtime at 10% strength, next day 30%, day after that 75, 4th day 100%
---
* The better the ore, harder it is to scan.  Combat scanning mining barges/rorq's is still very easy however.
---
* Make all combat anoms above a certain level(ie: if it generates greater then a 7/10 escalation) need to be scanned down.
---
* Apply same grid rules as a large faction warefare plex on combat anoms above a certain size - can't warp around on grid within an anom - harder to defend/rescue - harder to hunt.
---
* Faction rats that have a chance to spawn are diamond level and infinipoint drifter style :)
---
* Diamond rat fleets patrol/guard ore anoms larger then a medium.
---
* Diamond rats are the NPC waves in combat anoms that can escalate to an 8/10
---
* Diamond rats HIC scram in the above mentioned instances

* Make all ICE anoms shattered comets - you have to move as fast as the comet to mine it.  Comets move 10% slower then the slowest barge but 40% faster than an orca, and 90% faster then a freighter.  No mining bots in orcas or sitting idle filling a freighter.  subcaps, and porpoises..   Delete ice mining excavators, convert them to normal.
---
* Moon rocks shouldn't stop moving when you frak the chunk, that's not how physics works...  same deal as shattered ice comets.  If the rocks pass 10k from center of fraking location without being mined - they despawn/fall off grid.
---
Citadels:
---
* Unfueled citadels with no service modules online have their high/mid slots offline and have no timer, just armor and hull but can be fueled while under attack but not refitted.
---
* Make self/automated-defense service module, see below.
---
* Remove asset safety - replace with asset insurance - for the low low price of 5% of the value of your hangar monthly you can have the opportunity to receive up to 50% of your loot should the citadel become exploded, the other half drops.  You can't insure after a citadel is under attack - thanks Interbus
---
* Safely unanchored citadels get old style asset safety because the owner could be a dickhead and lock people out of their assets...  Still have a chance to kill it for the attacker, still costs person in the middle a % to get their stuff back for making a bad decision?  Same goes for manually triggered asset safety.
---
* Corporate hangar rent has an option for asset insurance as well.  
---
Hangars:
---
* Individuals can rent divisioned hangars, that have ACLs you can control to share space with your friends/alts without having to be in same corp.
---
* Divisional hangars also work for starting industrial jobs and can be insured by owner.  
---
Citadel strength:
---
* Make citadels able to actually defend themselves when powered and loaded with ammo, even in highsec.  You used to be able to build a dickstar POS no matter where you were without having to have it cost as much as a keepstar and it could do a pretty OK job defending itself, better if you manned the guns.
---
* Raitaru's and Athanors should be able to actually kill hostile small gangs even if they bring some logi by themselves and not barely scratch the tank of a scythe.
---
* Racial weapons for citadels - something better then badly applying missile damage.
---
* Azbel's/Soitiyo's/Fortizars should fuck up medium sized fleets and not have their damaged laughed off if you bring 4 ospreys and orbit it.
---
* Keepstar doomsdays should cost as much as a fit dreadnaught(or more) to fire the gun but when you do, all the things you have targeted should be murderzoned by chain fraking lightning if they are smaller then a titan and aren't already cycling their cap emergency hull energizer, but the chain lightning should wiff past subcaps.
---
* Titans hit by a keepstar doomsday should take 50% heat damage on all modules the first time and be immobilized for as long as the doomsday recharge is -60 seconds, if you're dumb enough to still be there and un-repped before 2nd volley - nice knowing you.
---
Add considerably more risk to PI. Allow players to bombard an individual players planetary setup but give it  an HP pool and a 1,000 dps damage cap to favor the little guy.
---
It's silly to think how PI is such an easy isk faucet, it's not normal and it's not eve.
---
Lower the amount of isk a player is allowed to invest in the market by adding huge exponentially increasing penalties in the form of taxes when you go passed a certain level. 
---
Market trading by veterans who have lots of isk and skill points is completely unfair to the people who just started, and there is no risk involved to them at all.
---
That is not normal and its not eve. Balance the playing field in line with new players
---
All the salt in the official thread
---
the change must be really bad for PLEX/ISK farmers
---
Says the fucking glorified Init renter lmao
---
Ships should have damage caps and a shield timer controllable by the player flying it
---
This thread is making me upvote the weirdest people.
---
which makes the cycles faster, draining more cap overall, not increasing specific shield boost.
---
Armor has an identical rig (nanobot accelerator, i think?).
---
If you're actually TAPI then you're in no place to talk shit, and if you aren't in TAPI than lmao your flair has as much value as mine you inbred 
---
You do realize how the mwd trick works, right? And that it doesn't require you have have sub 10sec align? 
---
Here's a secret, it even works on a cap, if you use a capital mwd. Even tho a cap has an align time longer than a cap prop mod
---
Yes it is the case, which is what makes these videos relatable to new players. Most people who play eve didn't jump in straight from wii sports, but being experienced in core gaming concepts is not the same as having a very specific eve skill set, which is necessary at a point (a fairly early point for a new and dedicated player) for more elaborate videos explaining things, but sometimes more experienced people over explain minutia and skip over critical elements that don't even occur to them that may need explaining, but someone fresh to the game (but not making game guides) can provide explanations for those things as they themselves figure it out. And you're right, there is a middle ground, and lots of good eve content creators, I just think there's room for this, too.
---
I've killed Melkanfdgxcv a few times too.
---
 I watched their behaviour for bit so they're now very easy to catch and kill (or just keep them scrambled for ages to stop them doing anything). Seems to go something like this:
---
* Select system of interest, travel to
---
* Arrive and go to sun at 0km. Sit there for about 30s to a min as they presumably scan any Novice sites within range for ships.
---
* If novice is empty, go to novice, still takes a few seconds for them to warp in once they land on the gate.
---
* Once inside novice they orbit the structure and kill the rats. 
---
* If you disturb them, they warp out (often before you've landed as they spam dscan) then leave system for another system of choice rather than waiting for you to leave OR go to any additional Novice sites first that are in the same system.
---
* Rinse/Repeat
---
* If you do kill them, they will return to Hek to get a new ship.
---
All you need do is simply follow them until they end up in their system of choice then they will usually warp to the sun and you can grab them.
---
Add a button for poor players where they can go to dangerous nullsec in a blockade runner, park next to a citadel and choose other players modules they want to steal from it. But add a skin that must be used to activate it, a Bonnie and Clyde skin would be great and make a lot more sense than the current safety the bitter veterans EXPLOIT
---
Invert the map so hisec is the outside border and nullsec is all in the middle. Every factions corner of hisec is an island. 
---
One of the reasons nullsec is so safe is that the regions that are realistt in cap range are few, while if you fuck up in lowsec it's possible to get dogpiled on from 8 directions
---
why share vid now when its 1yr old

Yes. I had 2 chars stuck and it was fixed yesterday. I was reimbursed double rewards for 2 days I missed and also received 50k challenge as compensation for trouble.
---
Make a support ticket, list your chars with the problem, don't be lazy.
---
Make all ships - actually make *everything* **asymmetrical**, as it once was.
---
I don't give a fuck about the game mechanics, I'm so into this game that I'll play whatever CCP does, but my pet peeve is the symmetry of the ships. Yes, I know it's easier to design them that way, but I still hate it.
---
^(And also add furries as a 5th playable race (coudn't help myself trolling).)
---
Due to obvious results of changes they kept making, despite all feedback.  It's still on them.
---
Rework of the corporation window so it opens on the corp bulletin page and is pretty.
---
Expansion of contract system to allow partial deliveries (think of corp buybacks) or stuff like refine contracts.
---
Structure spam and returning players insta quitting when half their shit is gone? :P

It's kind of embarrassing that this has so many upvotes.
---
&lt;necropost ahead - because OP linked me this thread&gt;
---
It actually runs better on linux than it does on windows...
---
I made support ticket and got it fixed and I even got reimbursed. And according to the ticket itself it has been fixed already.
---
So if you still see it broken make a support ticket yourself and list all your characters that are still stuck.
---
You know, instead of whining on unrelated forum and being drama queen you should go to CCP support team to get it dealt with like a reasonable person would.
---
What is wrong with you all saying this is bad? If this happened then there would be no need to sub all our extra accounts. CCP would lose so much money they would go out of business and we'd all be FREE!!!!!
---
A little too much ethanol this morning?

Infinite ratting anoms were a thing back then and mining was generally a despised occupation by most of PvP'ing nul-sec. Even the CFC wasn't very pro-miner in that timescale, the focus was on reactions.
---
Infinite mining anoms help accelerate the arms race but I don't think that removing them would cause expansion.
---
Would´ve died if it was a shield super...
---
What kills games like this is your belief that you are entitled to your safe zone.
---
I'll share a couple of anti blob mechanics from Perpetuum that worked very well.
---
Interference - there is a degradation to sensor strength depending upon the number and size of ships within range of you. ECM strength, locking range and locking speed are all reduced
---
Explosion damage - a ship dying does AOE damage in a small area around it. The larger the ship, the more damage. Smart use of this mechanic by attackers can cause the daisy chaining of a fleet.
---
Yeah like the thousands of bots that left the game when they did the jump changes. Those stupid botters
---
Great to see you play Eve, brother
---
I still remember your old EU4 stuff with Northernlion, mathas and friends
---
That´s not an ISK sink...
---
A way to get positive drifter standings and doing some more stuff with drifter wh's and jove observatories
---
Maybe it refers to extraterrestrials living in the hollow moon that are subbing new accounts
---
Long story short, no.
---
But I wouldn't listen to the other guy, evejobs is pretty trash tbh, its ok if you have experience to tell what corps are good and which ones are lying, but I wouldn't really recommend going there at the start.
---
The general advice is to join one of the big new player friendly alliances: Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, and Karmafleet. I did, and I had a lot of fun in horde, but its definitely not the only option. 
---
There's also lowsec, I don't know any groups in the amamake area, but if you fly there in game and go to the novice plexes in a t1 frigate, you will get a fight, and you can ask whoever kills you for a recommendation. In the gallente/caldari warzone, there is Aideron Robotics that was apparently pretty good. They did go through some major changes recently, so I can't say how they are now. Outside of the faction warfare stuff, there's Red vs blue, which is two different groups, the red federation and blue republic, that are always fighting each other except when they are working together to fight someone else. Except I've heard they're pretty dead now, so idk. 
---
There's also smaller corps in nullsec you can join, but the only one I know by name that will accept brand new players is The Rogue University, which is pretty good from what I've seen fighting them. 
---
Lastly, there is wormhole space, and I know two new player friendly groups here, Spoopy Newbies (Part of the Brave Newbies alliance I mentioned earlier, but they mostly do their own thing), and Pos Party. Again, haven't personally interacted much with either of these, but I've heard good things. 
---
So yeah, just look up what all the different areas of space are, and figure out what area of space you want to live in, null, wormholes, or lowsec, and then that narrows your options a lot. My list if far from exhaustive, so if you figure out the type of space, and maybe the general size of the group you want to join, you can ask again with those paramters and you'll get a lot better answers than this.
---
Honestly a great idea in concept, but so much has to be changed before this is a possibility. 
---
Judging from the recent talking in stations I feel like it’s kind of the direction they want the game to be. So here’s hoping to the smaller steps in this direction of gameplay. Dangerous risky emergent and engaging.
---
You can, you just don't have the battlefield control that bubbles give you.

Redo Blops as T3's. Give them both T3D Stances and T3C Subsystems
---
Also T3 Orca plz.
---
People are awfully optimistic here. My experience with ccp makes me think that they will try some stuff and all it will really do is make the strong and rich stronger and richer and make the weak and poor weaker and poorer.
---
The worst part was Hillary talkong about making it harder fpr veteran players and easier for new players.  That means he learned NOTHING from the past, like when Jon Lander was in charge and they wanted to fame to be "easy to learn, hard to master".
---
It doesnt work. Anything you do to help "new players" will just get farmed by veteran players. And it has to be remembered that.eve was better when ccp did nothing for new players but give is a ship and tell us to go fuck ourselves.
---
Its a noble idea, but making things easier doesnt help.people stay, its basically lying to them about what eve is. 
---
Eve is a Darwinian experiment, smash new players in the mouth and knock them on their assets (lile what happened. To us who started 10-15 years ago). The ones that get up off the ground, spit out a tooth and smile at you while plotting your death are the eve players.

---
Loved the Podcast, thank you! Looking forward to the "Chaos Era"
---
I like that they have more sp, every scrap of free sp is vital. The npe is a joke because of how restrictive a 2 mill sp character is. Working around the lack of sp is a real pain. Its like new players have to train "first impessions" to 4 and that takes 8 days.
---
The problem is that this system basically shafts people who don't know to use a recruiting link when they sign up, and this increase in the SP provided only makes it worse. 1Mn SP is pretty close to two weeks worth of training, which can get a new pilot into a fair amount. CCP basically acknowledges that new pilots need more SP, which is why they provide so much with the recruiting link, so why don't they just give more SP to new pilots?
---
I don't say theres no room for it, i just am not entirely sure it can be called a tutorial (- tutor, teaching) if the player is completely new (you dont let a second grader teach a first grade either) because i doubt new players will get a full grasp on the things they're doing and what sorounds these things.   
---
(Now i'm not saying the guy that made the video is a complete newbro, but that was the information i was given initially. - On a side note 168 hours in this game really isn't a lot, but it should suffice to discover some interesting aspects)
---
And so new players too can and will miss important parts but not because they forget about them but simply because they don't occur to them yet. 
---
You said it yourself, the scope of things you can do and what these things include is much higher than many people see. Some don't see them because they don't want to, but some because they can't (yet).  
---
 
---
All im saying is pretty pointless for this particular case though because as mentioned my initial argument came from a wrong point of view that came from the post title.
---
i dunno iv always thought eves biggest problem is the devs that design and make changes dont actually play the fucking game.
---
I'd like the ability to extract implants from corpses. It'll give an extra meta to pod-killing, and a reason to scoop corpses.
---
I have a pod if you want it $$$ not sure how I got it but I legitimately have a pod
---
Same way you are here and not making any sense. My alliance has not seen many bots around our space. However I have seen a ton in Fraternity space and it seems that the blackout is helping there.
---
k, so you cant read? Sounds awesome to me
---
Haha I can't possibly do that! I'm too nice to do things like that.
---
does it reallocate skillpoints without losing most of them?
---
I love you too
---
So here is the thing I roam without using tools to tell me where the indexes have changed. So I play the game with minimal intel and expect to get content but that ain’t happening people can only achieve high reward by using dotlan and zkilboard. And while I am a fan of optimization it kinda looses the unpredictability of the space and CCP is apparently trying to bring that back... we’ll switch off the tools that make it predictable
---
Proteus is good for insta-blapping someone before reinforcements arrive.
---
You can have "an absolute hellscape of terribleness" or you can have a feature literally called "asset safety", you can't have both.
---
And was the final nail in the coffin for me. CCP invented EVE as a sandbox. Now they're changing that to "let's fuck shit up all the time". Their words. 
---
Bye. My stuff has been trashed already.
---
Easy way to justify the blackout is a success argument ... Railroading in silly changes. I guess the COD people will buy the pr they're selling.
---
depends on skillpoints of pilot. look at skill injector in game and it says how much you'd get. for me at 20mil sp i get 400k per in jector so i wuld loose 100k sp doing it.
---
How much fucking coolaid do you consume, that right there is not fun.
---
Tis for the info.

---
If you are smart about the combat scan you can 1pass them and once you got a hit on the complex and got it bookmarked you can do the same thing as right now. Good idea.
---
Then why don't you just say fuck it and go do some other site?
---
&gt; Idea 1 
---
at this point you might as well make a fleet booster that decreases heat damage and heat accrued per cycle.
---
the only cosmetic i would buy
---
aside from the monocle if i wasnt a poor
---
Shield Boost Amplifier. It makes shield the go to ratting doctrine and makes armor significantly weaker because you must have nano pumps and dual rep to get a similar effect to having one oversized repper for shield.
---
Well if thats your impression then it must be right, right?
---
imagine ganking with this
---
Rumor has it no
---
Let's be honest. Niden and a very select few others would be the only ones to benefit from that.
---
Please tell me that kind of bling fit?

Using a lot of astero but I'm kinda scared to go to those places

Don't you have half the map blue at this point? Also did Wrik come back or is he still in the superior alliance - PH ?
---
well done
---
You need to accept the idea that ccp is company trying to make profits. So in its best interest is to have max people paying for sub in real money rather isc. What's the point to have 50k online when good ‰ off em is afk mining/boting. Thay only produce extra loud on servers, with no real benefit to ccp. And in my case what's the point for me to see 30+k chars online but really active, producing content so to say is roughly about 60%.
---
While we're at it. Stop making new ships and fix all the broken old ones.
---
I’m I getting it right? Are they finally leaving behind the idea that players are content? It sounds like they want to make players fight with environmental changes provided by CCP instead of fighting each other.
---

So happy that you're going down this road. Your tutorial series on EU4 for beginners as Castlle is what finally got me over the hump for that game after multiple attempts on my own. If you're taking a similar approach for EVE then you're going to create a terrific resource for other gamers to pierce the veil which will help for years to come.
---
Is it a "spend 2 years of development time and 30 million on to abandon it" idea, a "work on it quietly and implement it broken with no advertising and then never return to it" idea, or one that would work?
---
Weapons timers work both ways on all ships plz. No more instant teather while we're at it.
---
Hmm.. do I wana be horde or alliance...
---
then just give the missile abc 6 slots.
---
The guy calling targets was sorting by transversal so he was BCing targets outside of Multi range and forcing the fleet to use lower DPS Scorch ammo.
---
This is what confused me when I was tinkering with T3C support fits for the hell of it the other day. For one reason or another the Loki just has so much more PG to play with when you don't actually use artillery...
---
To use the support example, you could slap a 100mn, (faction) large battery, the required mods as well as a decent level of tank onto the Loki for, at most, 2 fitting mods/rigs. Throw a 100mn onto the Tengu and you're already at 99% PG. It's absurd!
---
Oh thank you Jintaan &lt;3
---
You'll want 2 T2 nano pumps in the rigs, A-type 1mn ab. Corpii/Centii A-type small armor repairer. And 2 faction or better enams (like imperial navy, not shadow serpentis.)
---
With a Faction cap battery in the mid that all should be cap stable and you can throw a DDA in the final slot and probably a low friction nozzle joins in the final rig slot and as long as you can avoid getting webbed to shit you should be able to handle it.
---
Thank you for the constructive criticism, I will ponder the various value points you brought up.
---
&gt;Don't you have half the map blue at this point?
---
whether or not we do, is that actually relevant or are you just being a shitter?
---
&gt;Also did Wrik come back or is he still in the superior alliance - PH ?
---
not sure who you're talking about. never heard of anyone called wrik
---
I mean it would still generate more heat than an empty slot ((

Come to wormhole space budd. I quit eve for awhile after growing tired of nullsec. Now i cant stop playing and have 3 new accounts lmao. Not saying you need more accounts but that im fully invested in this game again lmao

Just no. TiDi is already fucking miserable. You can fuck right off back to lala land

What is enams, never seen this word before?

you absolutely cannot boson in lowsec

I would be for that.

I prefer the idea of having a timer when you put something in a structure where you lose access to it while roamers can come up to the structure like a yard sale, and go through the list to see if there is anything they want.
---
It will really hurt botters and help the little guy.
---
They are seeing more users because everyone is letting their alts drop and yeah ofc its brung a few people back who are subbing just 1 account to check out the patch, the test will really be if they are still around next month if this continues.
---
Hell just listening to that interview I am stunned that talking in stations didnt ask more pointed and direct questions about the effect these changes might have.
---
You can
---
Well this is the best thread i read in a long time.
---
Nice.
---
This. I suggest command destroyer and command ships be the only ships allowed to light cynos.
---
Let black OPs battleships jump without a cyno
---
Huh, really? My bad then, figured allowing DD's in lowsec included bosons, thanks for correcting me!
---
Exactly. There's a reason skill lose went away. We shouldnt bring it back.
---
New chars start at neutral remapping. This gives 30 sp/min with no boosters or implants. If they stay alpha that means they get 15 sp/min. That makes 1mil sp 6.6 weeks of training time (and still 3.3 weeks if you go omega right away.)
---
is there any specific group that does just big mining fleets?

All gates will just receive an 0km bookmark then

It is relevant because I was actually considering applying at one point and I like shooting people. Wrik = Wrik Hoover = the guy who created your corp.

I also roam just using the in-game map. Out of game tools, while helpful, are not necessary by any means.

Dude has half a million YT subscribers and focuses mainly on showcasing complex games to an audience that is hungry for a challenge.  Yeah, totally can't see how this will work out.
---
In game map or dotlan is the same thing they give you intel that you did not acquire trough exploration or friends you just click a button
---
I'll test that fitting once at home, what drone type would you recommend? Gekko, or faction l, m, h?
---
CCP gilmar or he'll ar as in the news?
---
No. Stop making new ships and fix the olds one.
---
Is it hard to play? Not particularly.
---
Is it hard to play well? Perhaps.
---
Just remember Eve is half shit posting/memes and half dicking around in space and hopefully enjoying it.
---
&gt; If you expect someone to hold your hand and play the game for you, you're going to have a bad time regardless of where you go and who you join
---
Unless it´s a large nullsec newbie corp. 
---
&gt; what the fuck are you even trying to say here?
---
This.
---
On the flip side it would make fights for key locations extremely meaningful like it used to. I think fair mid ground would be 50% drop and 50% to asset safety and you could choose your asset safety location. For example low sec station like you choose your home station currently.
---
You do know Corp hangers are a thing right?
---
So you're not using the map to look for content?
---
Special probes that lets you warp to people inside deadspace (could also include cloaked ships but that's been suggested to many times already).
---
Make warp stabs reduce warp speed if they're not outright removed.
---
A new sort of ship that doesn't get great agility but amazing top speed, like 30% faster than any current interceptor but takes like 10s to get to that speed.
---
Webbing, scramming, painting etc bubbles.
---
Corp/alliance logos on ships.
---
Formalize coalitions, give them some significant upsides (like being able to sov wand each other's stuff properly) but also significant downsides (like Iunno, double the sov cost of the collective for every alliance in the coalition, so 2x for 2 alliances, 4x for 3, 8x for 4, and so on). Further, put a hard cap on the number of people in an alliance like corps are limited to skills.
---
Destroyers with fewer highslots (like 4? make it effectively 6-10 with bonuses) but more mid- and lowslots.
---
Mild facelift to the blackout: show fleetmates in local and keep the rest as is. It's difficult af to keep track of my 5 man fleet when fleeing from the blob.
---
Grapplers for smaller ships than just battleships.
---
coo coo coo, what are some shit tier corps that do that?
---
i dont hate the idea of bombs that basically create fleet booster pulses when they detonate. a well timed bomb right before your fleet warps in could reduce shield resistances or targeting range and win a fight.
---
Nobody said you can't be nice about it. I'm very nice to all the people I steal imaginary video game stuff from.
---
sounds like youre trying to install communism in my rampant capitalism in space game
---
The thing in WHs is that if your pod gets killed when your home gets attacked the chances of getting back is really small and at that point your chances to save even few assets drop to 0. So WHs would still be more dangerous. If you calculate all the work that goes into running WH sites the isk/h is not that great. Also i would like to mention that the amount of people one WH can hold is significantly smaller compared to null.
---
some changes are just no brainers
---
Don't get me wrong, i like the idea of harsh space and more risk, i just do not support the idea of losing my stuff while not actively playing. After all it is a game and it should be fun. I just can't see the fun part in losing my supercaps while i was on a working trip for some time and not able to actively defending my stuff. As i said, a lot of people don't even invest their ISK in those kind of ships, which is fine, and i also get that they like to destroy them and all the salt that may be involved, but i myself at least want to lose my shiny big toys in active combat and not in a keepstar fight i may not be able to attend at that certain time.
---
T2 hobgoblins should be fine. you could use augmented hobgoblins but you dps isn't super critical for this being able to tank hits is.
---
you had me at comic sans
---
It's not communism it's equality and fairness for all the world
---
Assuming every person can only have a single account/char...
---
Khanid gate to Stain
---
30 mil in 5 hours? I've made 200 mil in that time so idk what kinda moons you've been popping (just using a proc)
---
Because you're awesome &lt;3
---
let me loot the implants of pods
---
No seriously... any reason you can think of for this? I'm really confused. Am I rarted? Did I miss some sort of event where everyone got plex or some shit?
---
I agree, I’m pretty sure it’s just because you’re awesome
---
Okay I'm clearly missing something. I guess I'm rarted. Did they turn it into a currency or something?
---
Based on your comments, you have too much stuff to properly enjoy EVE. You've maxed out on your personal sandcastle building and have nothing left to aspire to. This game is most fun when played from the child-like zen perspective of a newbie who has no assets, no isk, knows nothing about anything.
---
It isn't too late to get back to that place though. The first step would be to unburden yourself by giving me all your stuff.
---
I really like the blackout, and I love PvP in this game by heart, but I also need a kinda guaranteed way to plex my account each month and I did that by ratting and trading. 
---
I get that they are happy to see ratting going down but activity staying the same, but give people like me another month or two and our reserves are depleted and we will need to quit the game until we find another good way of making 2bn+ per month.
---
Last time you were in was probably with a different currency. I had a couple of hundred plex because I had “aur”? Or what ever it was called when I last played
---
You don’t understand: it’s only bots and risk averse bears!!! Every with a pulse is fighting in 0.0 like there is no tomorrow!
---
Go to any 0.5 system and look for athanors that have open moon belts, look for brilliant gneiss and mine it, see anyone else on grid strike on convo and you might find yourself some friends that can show you some of the ropes
---
did you have some AURUM left?
---
Yeah I figured it out. Turns out I'm just dumb. Thanks.
---
Your life is unfulfilling. I mean, just look at your post history -- you are unable to engage in any meaningful conversation and ultimately end up being derogatory - especially when cornered. It eats you up inside knowing you can't speak your mind in real life because no one cares what you say - or likely doesn't even want to be in the same room with you. You bottle all that anger up because - *obviously* -  it's the world who is wrong and you are right...it has nothing to do with the way you present yourself. Cheer up kiddo, just remember:
---
&gt; You will die alone, and unloved. 
---
Have a great day! o7
---
My take was they want to players to fight *each other* because of the environmental changes meaning there's not enough stuff to go around.
---
Because in RS people usually don't have hundreds of accounts.
---
give goons BPO'd for pirate ships.
---
downvoted for lack of memes.  even my abys ship has fireworks JIC
---
[Haha, that sucker couldn't login fast enough. He got destroyed. lol](https://i.imgur.com/BFyMpYe.png)
---
So the recruiting bonus is even worse for new players who don't know about it, then.
---
And we bring ourselfs back directly to the point i was making in the first place, thank you. Yet I am guessing you dont even realize how you just proved my arguement.
---
Login rewards. Enough said.
---
&gt;there was a list of ONLY 1-5 people that could actually take control of the structure
---
Alts exist.
---
&gt;And Each individual character is limited to being able to control 1-5 structures
---
&gt;But larger groups would have to “trust” more people, giving chances for betrayal, or no one taking control of them.
---
Oh, IT'S ON BABY, IT'S FREAKIN' ONNNNNNNNN!
---
Eve-offline doesn't provide player counts, only the number of logged in characters. Only CCP knows how many real nerds are sitting behind the keyboard.
---
Yup, i don't think that merits a downvote for working that out and posting it but whatever.
---
I agree.
---
You go girl!
---
If you think Snuff wasn't prepared to drop hammer you are dumber than you already sound.
---
It means that players are actually willing to change things up even if it only brings a small improvement. Yeah, it's a big stretch but I think it was more of an inspiration than a "if A then B" moment for him.
---
Yes
---
Change sp loss from t3s to supers.
---
A doomsday that costs 1 trit to build, requires 0 cap to fire, 1 cpu and 1 pg, can be fit in any slot, with a 1rps rate of fire. And it's stackable. When fired, it deletes a random suggestion post from r/eve.
---
I'll bet everyone who returned after a long time had a reaction like this. I remember when i came back and saw the price of plex and was like "***WHAT!?***"
---
if people stopped upvoting my posts, i'd end up negative and unable to post. 
---
blame the people that keep upvoting my shit.
---
I hope you never need any JF deliveries.
---
so again, who replaced them?
---
doesn't matter what plummeted, having less of anything means any kind of replacement is less likely not more likely.
---
Init agreed years ago to work with GSF, even put it in writing.
---
complain? pointing out how valuable the current login rewards are isn't a complaint.
---
BREATHE HARDER BASB
---
So you're saying your corporations shouldn't need to be careful about who they hand out roles to?
---
So how is ccp not getting money from the people that buy Plex with isk? Someone bought the Plex for money?
---
&gt; crazy to think people want to play like that
---
We don't.  People generally didn't like the highsec fights, and we want to go fight in null.  Thus the highsec donut.
---
We can literally fight all day and never hit isk totals that matter.  It's like frigate 100v100s at the sun... except they go on all day in max tidi. It's just drudgery.
---
&gt; that can be efficiently done in a pvp capable ship?
---
Anomalies and DEDs can be done efficiently in PvP capable ships with minimal tickrate cuts or increased runtimes. Not afk though.
---
I dont, like ever. But in conjunction with Falcons "jumpfreighters can use covert shit" this wouldn't effect jumpfreighters. Giving normal cynos to only command ships is a good idea then give coverts to only convert ships is also a good idea. You gotta read the context my friend.
---
&gt;what could possibly go wrong?
---
(lol)
---
&gt; it deletes a random suggestion post from r/eve.
---
yes please
---
I've been playing a month and it's going to depend on your definition of hard.
---
4 of the 5 career tutorials are excellent, and the  Rookie chat channel is excellent at helping with the other one (Exploration. It's quite simply a shit tutorial). Understanding stuff takes time, and google, but those things exist.
---
I have no found the game hard to pick up, although I have put in a lot of reading and viewing hours of various things to make sure I understand things. There's also about 99% of the game left to learn, but that will come with time.
---
When you hit enter and posted this response, did you feel satisfied like you won Reddit?  Like you just won the Internet? 
---
How about coming up with something creative ? I know you have it in you
---
Suitonia the man we dont deserve but we need.
---
Seems plenty creative to me.
---
Oh geeze, oh darn it. They brought 40 whole carriers! Whatever will the *largest coalition in eve* do against such an overwhelming force?
---
Also, boson titans in lowsec? I doubt it.
---
This is a great idea!
---
I'm enjoying your tears :P
---
Maybe you didn't realize I was arguing that it will all work out and nullbears should stop crying it keep feeding salt to everyone
---
CCP is desperate to get more numbers playing coz a lot of people unsubscribed XD
---
&gt;As one example, it is significantly easier to supply a regional market minihub with a wide complement of competitively priced T2 modules than it is to supply one with modules that new players can use.
---
This is something as a new player that I tried to take advantage of. As a tiny supplier, people aren't bothered about wasting their ISK - which is a huge amount to you, but nothing to them - in these less competitively priced areas. Creating some industry for the holes in the local regions has allowed me to start buying ships that I won't mind losing due to having some kind of steady income.
---
Of course, that's just one players view of it. Many people won't want to spend a month trading stuff before they can fly off and get zapped, but I imagine similar niches exist that they can exploit if they think about how small they are in this universe.
---
Tell me which tidi fest you loved to attend as far as pre-blackout "pvp activities"are concerned
---
talks shit about content but literally never creates or contributes his own
---
very good yes haha
---
never heard of him. i don't think he exists.
---
Eve style Clash of Clans?
---
pl is only uncool in your mind
---
Unless you want to quit again i reccomend not mining.
---
sure
---
wrik hoover doesnt exist
---
InB4 everyone recommends almost literally any other activity besides hi-sec mining.
---
the bot should post the name of the poster that was removed so that we can call them bad
---
A better solution would be to massively reduce capital ehp, but give each capital a siege mode that massively improves its self rep, while blocking external assistance (remote sebo, cap trans and RR etc).
---
Some sort of mining module that doubles your yield but requires you to complete the hacking minigame for it to yield something. Maybe tie it to some sort of siege mechanism, or fuel consumption.
---
.....and in your video &gt;!GOTTEM!&lt;
---
The mimintar have a t1 ammo hualer. I have been in an alliance that would drag either this or a dst along with us. We keep it cloaked off grid incase we needed more ammo. Usually only if we where doing structure bashes in ships that went through a lot of m\^3 intensive ammo.
---
I have a better challenge. Stop posting.
---
Fair enough. I'm off to do some missions instead
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the link :3
---
Check https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore and find highest price per m3 in your area and have at it. Goes well with beer!!
---
It’s not an isk faucet, you can’t sell p.i to npcs
---
Do the Trig invasion rats warp into escalation sites?
---
Got an escalation located in a system under invasion and haven't been able to find an answer to this.
---
K, like 5-6 y ago I had 5 active acc-sub cap+ cap(0.0), houler, sup cap +cap(wh). I played total about 20h e week  - pve+ pvp. I had a sub on two main acc, rest payd with plex. It would cost somewhat 1.7b.
---
I'm back playing again but with only 2acc, putting additional 6b together.... Nop, I need rl too....
---
Oh but they have everything meticulously planned out and can do no wrong /s
---
Basically due to the web bonus the Loki is a very powerful T3C. The Legion a close second due to the ungodly tank you can fit. 300k EHP is just a silly amount for a second tackle cyno, or really any solo PvP encounter. Just a shame it's slow as balls.
---
Thanks! Very helpful!
---
Make sure to only run one or the other.  Windows' Gamebar hogs resources.  Not noticable in EvE, but noticable in other current gen games.
---
You should listen to the podcast with Hillmar. They are shaking things up and said to expect changes weekly. They sound like they have no interest in catering to what players want. Chaos era BBY.
---
Utility high, 50% chance to terminate seige/triage/indy 50% chance to polarise all resistances for 10 mins.

---
The hold my beer module.
---
A love heart Launcher 🚀❤️
---
JFs with covert cynos would, on the face of things, be fine with me, since the higher skill requirements would weed out more bads and poors, but it also severely restricts to only hulls which can use a covert cyno. Those are not often for sale in the ass end of nowhere.
---
I'd be more inclined to see a new classes of  cyno: industrial cyno and combat cyno. 
---
Keep covert the same - blops. For the industrial cyno, only JFs and rorquals could jump to it and any t1 or t2 industrial ship could light the cyno.
---
The combat cyno, as you said, could be restricted to certain hulls, and like normal cyno now, anything could use it.
---
Thanks for such detailed yet simple to follow tutorial! Helped me get back playing this game again after 2 years! Some great tips as well!
---
Holy hell you people sound like Alex Jones. Lay off the tinfoil buddy.
---
"ITS THE BLACKOUTIST AGENDA! NO LOCAL IN NULL IS TURNING THE FROGS GAY! WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!"
---
Ffs.
---
And maybe you didnt realize i was arguing, that how it works out is a massive funnel and buff to only the mega alliances of eve. And end to starting alliances in null.
---
Ejector seats, then you wingsuit down in FPS mode and try and finish them with your Dust machine gun. Kapow.
---
Anything but mining in high sec. 
---
But if you insist on mining in high sec, find a quiet system and mine Ice.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Sanshas consist of two main group, True Slaves, which are under control by brain implant, and True Citizens, which have the implant but retain free will.
---
I guess they are True Citizens that broke off?
---
Knowing these specials  they may actually do it.  Then accidently break all corp roles in the process, to be fixed "soon" in 2023 after they finish tiericide.
---
Give Stain a gate to Dodixie
---
Give us arena agents that pop us into blankspace against someone in a ship with similar ISK value. You can't warp away so the loser gets podded. No LP or extra money from it. Just loot drops. No matchmaking aside from ISK value.
---
Give us 1v1s, damnit.
---
Yes.
---
A decloak sphere thing that works like a Hics bubble. So you activate it and you can decloak any local campers within the sphere
---
Yes, they might work for fleet ships, if the corp gives ships to its pilots, which is an idea some dislike, as they think it makes people lazy etc. , but what about my manufacturing stuff ? I build a lot of things using all my chars, I can't just keep my ore and components and whatnot in the corp hangar ! And it's annoying to have to trade lumps of stuff from one pilot to another back and forth.
---
As long as the managers beleive it and let CCP shake things up with stuff lile BO let them do it.
---
You're bragging about basically not playing the game lol
---
Is this bait?
---
Corp/alliance bulletin page ingame - YES please ! 
---
Maybe I'm too lazy ? I'd like that, it would spare me from logging in to the forums to see the last corp infos. And maybe this could go on the launcher, in a kind of widget ?
---
Microwarpdrives now require fuelblocks to run.
---
The new granular plex can be loaded into ancillary armor reppers for increased repping amount.
---
Citadels now have ISK upkeep costs.
---
Supercaps now have ISK upkeep costs.
---
Paragon Soul becomes lowsec with highsec island.
---
The Catch system of 3GD6-8 will become lowsec so Stain has a connection to lowsec.
---
Don't do missions either.
---
I like this idea!
---
So just manipulate the market in HEK and make them buy extreamly overpriced Ventures.
---
I provided bait/ cyno/ first tackle and we were massively outnumbered, so why not? It's part of the game so how is it not playing the game? I'd say afk ratting and mining is much less than escalating a conflict. It's not on me they didn't realise it was bait in time.
---
also mine what you find. searching for better ore will just take time. time better spent just mining the less optimal ore right in front of you.
---
ur going down a slippery slope friend
---
Im sure you know this, because your posting demonstrates a very intimate understanding of the game, but eve sequels will never work. 
---
Eve exists because of its player-constructed universe and the history present on the single shard. You kill that, you kill the game. CCP knows that, thats why they dont make("eve 2, eve 3, eve4, etc..")
---
Adding more risk to null and deleting the ridiculous safety net IS balancing. The krabs are no longer the fat kid on the seesaw.
---
I think Ill use my free SP to train a rorq or 2 for our jspace moons.
---
A ship that can carry pods or fitted ships with pilots, kind of like a taxi.
---
Don't do anything! Playing is what makes you quit!
---
True fact: only people who play the game quit, correlation indicates not playing is the only way to reliably avoid quitting.
---
&gt; A freighter full of fuel blocks is required to online it, 3 freighters of Ozone per jump
---
Zeta is that you?
---
Find a good corp.
---
I've been stocking my meat locker for a decade awaiting the day I can start making brain-sausage.
---
I like this.
---
Well it's easy free isk. That's not eve. It should be very hard and super high risk
---
What do you expect me to do then xD Without any direction, I feel lost.
---
Maybe but I don't think so since the larger alliance aren't ratting as much anymore. Overall it helps the little guy the most
---
something something eve is dying 2003
---
sad but true :(
---
A warpable structure is a ship,dummy!
---
Fact check police here:
---
&gt;We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years
---
[yeah... about that.](https://i.imgur.com/aZfINLZ.jpg)
---
And once again, stop sucking that juicy CCP dick when listening to literally ANY of their promises, they say a lot of things, most of which never make it into the game, and now it's blatant lies to boot...
---
why would the head of CCP saying he literally has no fucking plan what so ever give anyone hope?
---
all he did was spend 2 hours admitting he hasn't got a fucking clue so he's going to randomly change every knob and dial he can find and hope sheer dumb luck saves the game.
---
Off to a good start...
---
Awesome man I love it. Thumbs up thanks for the laugh. Sad but true
---
Make NPCs in npc nullsec gatecamp and warp to your grid you if you're not friendly to them. 
---
Have them escalate concord-style until they can't be done anymore. Make the NPC area a place for players to make their Incursions :)
---
Because that's just a worse stealth bomber without the stealth.
---
And once again, stop sucking that juicy CCP dick when listening to literally ANY of their promises, they say a lot of things, most of which never make it into the game, and now it's blatant lies to boot... from non other than Hilmar...
---
now let the downvoting of the truth begin...
---
I mean if you actually posted a video of you smallganging or dropping supers to kill krabs or something, yeah it woulda been a pretty decent funny video. Instead you chose not to, and therefore I will poke fun of it.
---
Have a blessed day.
---
a reverse remote sheild/armor rep. just like a nos, it takes their hp and transfers some of it to you.
---
nano, dual polycarbon, drugged, snaked arty loki with two webs can go \~4k hot which puts small targets at 0 transversal with the two webs you can shoot at 45km or so :P
---
Let’s say the exact same 5 real people are on all the list with alts then. 
---
They can’t always be online, and be in every system so combat on structures are possible.
---
A NSA for battleships.
---
why are we still here? just to suffer?
---
270m TICKS BOIS
---
you know what's even more funny, that the whole thing about MAU/DAU being the highest in the past 5 years is a blatant lie... 
---
[stats for the past 5 years](https://i.imgur.com/aZfINLZ.jpg) we're now at the lowest player count by a pretty wide margin, and even if you don't include that dip at the end (and i have no idea  why you would do that but hey) it's still pretty average at best...
---
250 titans sat in top of each other with no I'll effects is fucking stupid
---
Take a moment to look at npc kills in the last 24 hours in delve and eso. And say that again.
---
Good luck killing that passive tanked gila with your passive tanked gila, or killing that 46m ehp titan in your carrier.
---
There’s alot of classes that doesnt match up well in this system?
---
100mn legion (but eh, with double webs being all around, you need to be careful)   
---
kitey dual web loki to pop soft targets solo (like t3cs and such). You won't kill larger stuff and you can't stay too much on grid when shot at so a lot of larger targets are out of reach.
---
Its already ingame, but its not presented properly. Go to corporation on your neocom and you can find it ;)
---
Based my experience (probably like 10-20 sites in trig systems so not much), trig will NOT camp escalations/DED sites in trig invasion system, im almost 100% sure they will never enter the acceleration gate but im not sure they won’t camp the first gate, hope this helps
---
grit your teeth, allow your friend to help, get in a corporation that will teach you.
---
A new blackout midslot module. We'll call it the bamboozler
---
When activated against a targeted player, it causes their entire screen to blackout with a game over sign  and the voice of Cary hiroyuki Tagawa from mortal combat saying game over insert 25 cents to play again. During this time the target signature radius blooms by 5,000% it's resist are set to zero and is held in place the same as a ship that has lit a cyno, but can be bumped in any direction at incredible speeds.
---
It would be activated for 10 seconds and have a 5 minute cool down but use such an amount of CPU that only ships carrying a bonus to "CPU reduction of the eve online arcade module" could use it. Ships such as the kestrel, arbitrator and possibly the ark could only use it.
---
It would require one tier 2 skill to operate so that it's not out of reach of new players to quickly train it up and fit to a kestrel.
---
Have you seen how dead ns is these days, noone in local anywhere you could just jump that titan round no worries.
---
Well, we'll give it a shot tomorrow then.
---
Thanks!  &lt;o
---
I'm more like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHLdYVELWrQ
---
A utility high slot module that, once activated, stops the OP from posting. 
---
I call it the "Please stop posting" module.
---
Give the Enforcer literally any buff. I suggest a drone bay that matches what's on the ship model. 
---
Give Black Ops dscan immunity.
---
Hive the brawly Caldari ewar ships that suck post nerf either an ECM Burst bonus or invent a new second ewar system for Caldari.
---

---
Personally I think they should post how many people haven't logged in during this blackout compared to how many of those people did log on for the last 5 years.  There is always old players returning after some shit goes down.
---
Make it dscan immune
---
I just hear a lot of crowdpleasing and parroting already existing suggestions from the community. I hate botters and 24/7 farmers, but so far it's casual players that enjoy both PVP and PVE that are paying the price for this halfbaked crusade.
---
&gt; "newbros are no longer an asset to corporations due to multiboxing"
---
JFC did they say that?
---
Faclon showed how out of touch with reality he is when he talked about 'Covert Ops JFs'.  
---
Now Hilmar is showing how out of touch with his company he is, or this is just a big PR wave before the fall.
---
Eve players are too smart to be fooled by DAU and PCDU.  Eve Offline tracks PCU not DAU.  DAU is more closely related to revenue, while PCU is more closely related to game-health.  Hillmar is bragging about revenue not game-health.
---
Bring orbital strike mechanics back.
---
Make the advanced planetary skill lls allow you to see other people's planetary colonies.
---
Allow one orbital strike per 2 days. Orbital strike reinforces the colony like a depot.
---
Also uh bring back Dust already.
---
Wait a second. I literally just read that the botters are now dead?
---
You want to bet industrial activity is down a ton in delve since the black out?
---
Think about it- you want to go back to the extreme hegemony of goons + rorq + perfect intel, or reduced their industrial output by a fuck ton?
---
Other alliances will be hit too and that's also good. Null needs to be dangerous and scary, not for crabs.
---
If goons want to fight for their ratting peace then so be it. Their supers will get dunked or be busy dunking, while the rest of hunters can kill their ratters.
---
It all works out in the end. This is the great balancing.
---
Yes economic activity will *change*, not cease.
---
Been an EVE player since 2003, but not so much for the past 4/5 years. With young kids I can mainly only play games that I can instantly save and switch off - which is why I spend lots of time playing Paradox games - which is how I also came to discover and follow your channel. Currently rewatching you 'Count of Paris' series as am currently in CK2 mode. Anyway, good luck in EVE, will track down the videos at some point and remember - Amarr Victor!

If you end up dying to them camping the gate lemme know (or if they camp and you get away this info would be usful for me), ill pay for ur ship, assuming you arn’t flying bling lol

Was not here in 2013 so i cant compare :D
---
Why no "Made you form" posts yet? Mostly away from game these days because of summer time so help some brother out here, who are these Project Gungnir people?
---
if it's a bot, it's literally free isk.
---
so, of course it's worth it.
---
Me too. Now I just don't know what to think. Maybe reddit will tell us what to think and it'll be ok

Change all ewar drones to be large drones, then give them huge buffs. They are literally trash today, but if they had full strength webs/paints etc but required 25 mb each people might use them.

Since you totally explained in detail what you consider a blue tax, I´m happy to tell why it doesn´t work in detail.
---
It doesn´t work.

Make it so if u get podded u die in real life. CCP plz
---
The fuck did I just watch and why did I watch the whole thing?
---
Wow you are fast
---
Oh Lord no. The null sec ratting bots are still working out the blackout. High sec mining bots are still churning away. The blackout did fuck all for botting overall, just dented the null sec ratting bots for a bit.
---
Jumping
---
Titan sized mining ships that devour entire rocks but on a 5 minute siege cycle where they can't use any mods on the ship and creates a phenomena where cynos are inactive within 1000km of it. Resists drop to zero like polarized guns when chomping rocks. Takes 300-500% more damage from subcaps.
---
Pacifier and Marshal too, they need a drone bay
---
Have a try of everything mate. Mining, ratting, missions, exploration, gas mining, PVP etc.. plenty of things out there. Nothing wrong with mining/industry, I loved that side of that game for a long time myself. Once you figure out what you enjoy, starting looking for a corporation of like minded individuals. o7
---
Are you sure? Because I'm getting reports of endless content going on in nullsec in general.  No specific areas specified but null in general is on fire with action. Dotlan is a liar though.
---
I've found that the more I know about most games, the less I enjoy it. 
---
Take Overwatch. In the every early days, back before there was a meta and no one knew anything, it was a lot more fun and a lot less toxic. Now, you must play this way and only this way. 
---
I think EvE suffers from the same thing. Back when you start, you experiment. I remember running a blackbird for lvl 2 missions, with all my slots filled with shield extenders. Wound up with about 14,000 iirc. Might have been 11,000 but I remember talking with an eagle pilot in a corp we were at war with that was very confused when my shield wasn't going down as quickly as they might have expected. But now, I'd never experiment with a fit like that, I'd look up how to run one, as much of this game has already been solved and it's competitive nature means that you have to run the optimal fit, because the other guy might be.
---
Hope that stroke didn't actually kill you, ya fucking sperg

Sadly that was an April Fool's joke https://www.eveonline.com/article/p6hym3/introducing-eric-coming-in-the-next-release

Quiet system that has Ice ano? Are we playing the same game?
---
Liken that to catching an epithal on a poco.  Is it fun?  Sure, but is it a good fight?  Absolutely not.
---
I can relate.
---
Such feels.
---
Augmented is much better, but a lot more expensive and painful to use. I dont know how tough the tank on the rats is but i think it will be more economical to use T2 (or faction - tankier than t2 but slightly less damage) until you're more experienced
---
They still couldn't be blue to one another though.
---
I don't know, but I did too and would like to second your sentiment.

Remove orbit, keep at range and approach. Force people to fly more manually.
---
I think you're misunderstanding what I meant, I mean it's crazy to think people would want to band together most of the game and then once anything resembling a challenge shows up they back down and leave. You're complaining about no isk to destroy? Want us to form the same as supers instead? Titans?
---
How do you guys delude yourselves into not playing and then act like that's the game you're paying for. Is your leisure time worth so little to you?
---
MacroJumpDrive (low slot) - it jumps you 5ly in the direction your ship is heading.
---
ShipRepellant (low slot) - it bumps every ship that isn´t in your fleet 1km away.
---
If its gonna die, why use a hauler over some beefcaked ship with an equivalent cargo to your golem? Honest question
---
Like slapping c4 on a Flash and catapulting it into a sieged Prowler while jetpacking away in PS2.
---
Totally resource impractical, totally, hilariously worth it.
---
&gt;Can someone explain why a blue tax to limit size of alliances would be a bad thing or why it wouldn't work?
---
It's amazing that, despite the unbridled idiocy inherent to, "omg make mechanical limits to how many friends people can have people shouldn't have more friends than me it's not faaaaaaaair I'm a useless bedwetter and nobody liiiiiikes meeeeeee" people keep making them.  And ignoring all of that, every last one of these proposals would be trivially sidestepped.
---
Highsec mining bots have always been there, both in space and in CCPs reports on how many players/accounts have been active. 
---
Now I wonder why CCP leaves them alone.
---
Ammo in cargo bay adds AOE damage to a ship explosion.

These were the best trollest things ever added to the game.  CCPls
---
\-A- is shit
---
Remember when there was this blackout? That was epic! Good times.
---
Do what you want to do. You started off mentioning mining. Instead of having no conviction to do what you started out wanting to do, go fucking do it for abit and see if it's what you want.
---
The movement of people into blobs and growing state of "everyone blue" in null had been going on since before 2015, though.
---
Lol this is hilarious because obviously the number of allies you have in a video game is a good indicator of how many friends you have. How would be side stepped though?
---
Give the tier 3 battleships a damage multiplier against capital hulls.
---
I just wish the recruiter skins weren't kinda fourth wall breaking and ugly. They feel really dark and mean, versus the friendly feel of recruiting. Plus having the giant word RECRUITER on the hull feels weird.
---
Certainly, but they could do a better job replicating The New York Times headline font
---
Hell, if this has to do with NOVA this are good news indeed o/
---
I know NOVA doesn't offer much... But it has so much potential to be great in the future!
---
You can start in a 1.0 or .9 system as npcs don't spawn there. Learn the ropes, find a nice quiet place to move to later (that has compression via a player station you can dock in) and set up shop.
---
That's the most idiotic strawman argument I've ever heard. Not to mention a half truth. 
---
They don't owe it to anybody to waste their time publishing data that would more than likely be ignored or argued against. That's why most gaming companies don't involve the community in their design decisions; they realize how idiotic mob rule is. Why CCP wastes their time even trying to cater to some of the ridiculous bullshit out of this community is beyond me.
---
The warpcore stab/nano Vagabond era was so devastating that it was decided to nerf it so hard into the ground that it would never recover.
---
&gt; If you run SP events, how can you call the data on logins accurate? 
---
They can probably filter those out without too much work. Remember, your actions are logged; a login just to click a button and redeem SP is super easy to filter out (account connected, no character connected) and they can probably filter out low playtimes too so anyone logging in for 5 minutes to shoot an NPC and log out can be taken out easily too.
---
That's not the point of posts like these. I don't like the idea but anyone who wants a blue donut hates Eve.

*“This is what games are for. They teach us things so that we can minimize risk and know what choices to make. Phrased another way, the destiny of games is to become boring, not to be fun.

I didn't know it worked like that... I thought it was something akin to Sansha having complete mind control over the entire population... It's interesting to know this is not quite the case o.O
---
I think they're referring to famed Albion Online Gold Seller, Wrickhard Hoobler.
---
Red is blue, neutral is red?  Bypassed your whole idiot idea.
---
Then you have to follow up with an idiotic addendum to that about curtailing reds, too.  So now we just partition space between subentities and don't roam each other.  Or, fuck it, we roam each other because who cares but stay away from anything strategic and cooperate on strategic ops.
---
You think people don't already have neutral blues?  It's not an issue if you just shoot what FC tells you to shoot.
---
Oh no, the venture bots will be making literally thousands of isk a day.
---
I'll let you know!
---
&gt;I don't like the idea but anyone who wants a blue donut hates Eve.
---
Yes, the blue donut is the worst thing ever, except for all of the windowlicking idiot fuck solutions people like the OP come up with for it.
---
Username checks out.
---
Yes, but I only care about T1 frigates. :)
---
Yea, they could. People would just start using personal standings.
---
Triple the yield if you stream it.
---
I saw these guys the other day. Is there anything a concerned human player can do to disrupt a bot in HS, since we can't kill them? (I mean we could, but that seems pretty pointless considering they have a million accounts and will come right back). Does bumping them do anything useful?
---
I'm pretty sure they know you're not going to placate everyone that's reeeeing over the changes with some positive data on player activity considering they're the ones trying to sabotage it to make it look like everyone hates it or it's a failure. 
---
What I really think is happening is that those people are in denial about the fact that regardless of how much they are thrashing about and playing chicken with their canceled subs, it's not causing the major impact they hoped that it would.
---
Repurpose ECM as a drone/fighter interference platform, reducing control range, speed, or gun mechanics based on scripts. 
---
It even makes sense in lore.
---
If the goal is catch-up mechanics, then there are much better ways to do it(like buffing rewards for low SP activities that new players engage in).
---
you can nerf the mechanic itself but you can't change the fact that people congregate &amp; team up
---
Yeah, it's called blue tanking. We've utilized some imperium affiliates in key structure defenses to tank against other imperium members lol.
---
They literally say this in the interview my guy.. players are returning. More (current subs) are active and logged in.
---
i'm gonna poke fun at you for being sTUPID then LMAO
---
Get back in your super carrier and go own the newbs with a 500 man fleet. Your PVP skills are strong.
---
I think I'm going to have that book.
---
It's interesting though, that some games are the opposite. For example, I play Pokemon competitively (.....well, at least singles. Some people don't think that's competitive but they can shut up.) and knowing that yes, I can take this incoming hit has made the game more enjoyable to me.
---
Here's some more lore for you. After some more reading, it seems the True Citizens wouldn't be able to leave and defy Sansha anyway. It's possible that when the other empires attacked and "killed" Sansha that it was one of the small splinter groups that existed before the came back together to reform the Sansha's Nation. Maybe a lore nerd will show up and clear this up.
---
"With his army of True Slaves providing for their every need, the scientists, philosophers, and other intellectuals became the Nation's True Citizens. While some were left unaware of the true extent of Sansha's crimes, they nonetheless spread the good word of Nation, bringing more followers into the realm. Soon, the Nation spanned several regions, rivaling each of the empires in might."
---
"All five empires, including the Jove, whom he had expected to stay uninvolved, and the Amarr, whom he had anticipating siding with him or, at worse, remaining neutral, banded together to form a coalition against the Nation. The coalition of empires swept into his realm, smashed his fleets, and destroyed his infrastructure.
---
Sansha himself was reportedly killed in the fighting; the Gallente Federation retrieved a body which matched Sansha's DNA and appearance. All that was left of his once mighty Nation were scattered survivors, ruined stations and settlements, and wrecked ships.
---
Over the next several decades, the remnants of the Nation slowly gathered together. A few of the Nation's commanders had survived. They pulled together the aimless True Slaves into the heart of Sansha's old promised land. A smattering of carefully hidden stations had been spared the onslaught; these served as the new base of Sansha's Nation.
---
The commanders slowly began the process of rebuilding the Nation from the scraps. They built new ships, fresh stations, and secretively recruited new members. Operating through shell corporations, go-betweens, and mercenaries, they procured new subjects for the True Slave conversion. It was slow going at first, because they wished to avoid attracting the attention of the still-hostile empires."
---
"However, Sansha does not have the faculties to control every individual detail of his Nation, no matter how much he might wish he was able to. Instead, he delegates local control to a number of highly trusted, loyal True Citizens such as Vizan Ankonin, Chelm Soran, Citizen Astur, and Citizen Arson. These commanders are given carte blanche to act as they see fit to advance Sansha's vision. However, because they too are fitted with Slave Implants, they are prevented from acting against Sansha's will in any way."
---
It must be exhausting getting so upset about a post over a video game. I don't think its something that will fix all the current issues but large bluelist just seem like free inte that only push people into bigger blobs.
---
Throw some lore in there about a capsuleer being so mentally exhausted from commanding a titan that the destruction completely ruins their mental strength.  Take away super/cap related skills.
---
A drone tether. Midslot. When you warp, your deployed drones that are within a certain range of you are dragged along with you, preventing orphan drones and commercials with Sarah McLaughlin saying you suck for abusing and abandoning your drones. Uses 5pg, 15 cpu, and costs 100,000 isk each time it keeps your drones with you because you are a heartless bastard, and should be ashamed of yourself. ("Wings of the angel" starts playing in the background...)
---
So instead of having an intelligent discussion and trying to come up with better solutions, you berate the people giving the suggestions?
---
I would assume the half that didn't drop gets destroyed. :P
---
It's more like exasperation, because this suggestion isn't even novel in its stupidity.  Someone comes up with some iteration of this dumb idea juuuuuust about daily.
---
Sounds like a friend of Gevlon Goblin tbh
---
Doesn't have to be bots. It could be someone running a bunch of Alpha accounts on VMs. I mean, they'll probably run like shit, but they're mining in high sec in Ventures so..
---
A lot of the High Sec bots mine in Orcas. I can say that's the one negative to come out of the Wardec changes. You can't mop up the high sec botters.
---
You could have a tax on personal standings as well.
---
Nyx / hel and thanny/nidhoggur if you are in a safe zone. Otherwise its gila/sacriledge in a quiet highsec system doing tier 4 abyssals
---
You sure got me good!

---
I've actually never seen it. Can you link me one of the posts that way I can sort through the comments and get the answers I'm looking for?
---
Maybe just maybe they have other metrics, like real users, not just accounts...
---
But yeah, screamin reeeeeeew is easier
---
That seems extremely arbitrary, to be honest.
---
Alternatively, divide the empire HS with lowsec "rivers" that are the prime territory for facwar.
---
Yeah gimme a sec, think there was actually another one on the forum just this morning but it might have been embedded in a blackout thread.
---
The whole standing system makes it so much easier though.
---
maybe just maybe they are using useless statistics like people who log into the game for 5 seconds to claim those shit daily rewards for logins that they are feeding you for the sake of boosting those imaginary numbers as a way of getting a juicier paycheck?
---
I'm not sure venture bots would even be worth the electricity. They are truly atrocious for isk making.
---
Done all of that. My point for posting here is maybe someone will see it from CCP and fix a bug that's been there for almost a year. I've tried to contact them several times through all possible ways now.
---
Thats possible too, who knows what they do, they wouldnt tell us, keep reeeeeeing, its a shitshow obviously
---
A market minihub requires a certain critical mass of activity in order to exhibit competitive pricing.  
---
My only point is that the critical mass for groups of newer players is significantly higher than that of groups of experienced players. 
---
Newer players operating around a hub established by and for experienced players will struggle separately, and therefore exhibit less activity.
---
Thanks, I will keep reeeeeing as I've been doing for years now.
---
Well, because it is ?
---
Look at offline numbers and the way even this subreddit was changing from "lot of content §§§ blackout OP §§§" to "There is no one in space outside of umbrellas"
---
Open a way to Jove space, only to be entered up to Battlecruiser class vessels through only a handful stargates. No dockable stations and no death clone possibility, no bombs, no bubbles. Inhabit it with Drifters or other sort of NPCs. 
---
No local, NPCs can be scanned down with probes and dscan. There are mining fleets, as well as battle groups killing rogue drones, as well as haulers flying between stations. 
---
The loot from those ships or stations however needs to be extracted using a special npc vessel that can be called in using a flare (preferably drops from data sites in low sec). The flare creates a signal on the map that can be seen by everyone in and outside of the region. 
---
 Once called in the extraction vessel will appear after a couple of minutes. Once on grid loot can be put into the vessel and after like five minutes the vessel leaves the area. The loot will be dropped into a random low sec npc station and can be retrieved after 24h. 
---
Calling in the flare will trigger a npc response fleet. The strength of that response fleet depends on the number of ships in the region.
---
(I have stolen that idea from The Divison which I played lately)
---
*hear
---
I don’t think the real fallout(or lack thereof) can really be determined at this point. I think a lot of people are just waiting to see if blackout will be permanent or to see if something will be introduced to mitigate it before cancelling.
---
The resubs and unsubs are so far are probably made up of reactionary folks. I know quite a few that are hanging on until an official statement about it is made because insofar it’s been sold as a test.
---
It's a conspiracy, they just really hate you nullbears.
---
Better go cry about it.
---
if this becomes a thing people will figure out some out of game tool to do it for free.
---
Is that you trump?
---
this has nothing to do with nullbears crying, it literally calls out a blatant lie on stuff that can easily be fact checked...
---
The 60mil number sounds high. 
---
I run t2 in maxed out hawk with 3 percent implants. Average time is 14 minutes specially with the twilit battleship spawns taking excess of 5 minutes to kill. 
---
Average loot per abyssal is just under 20mil. You can run 3-4 in an hour depending on breaks. You will pull 60-80 mil. 
---
If t1 nets you 60 no point wasting time with t2. 50 sites in I have yet to get a t2 skill book
---

---
Getting okay advice so far, but here's the "teach a man to fish" approach:
---
- download and install Pyfa, a fitting tool for eve
---
- make a character in pyfa that is linked to your eve characters skills
---
- find rykkis guide for wh pve sites
---
- find the site you want to do and check the dps of each wave.
---
- create your fit in pyfa. There are various ways to import and export between the game and pyfa.
---
- see if you have enough tank to survive.
---
- adjust skills to see how it changes your numbers.
---
All Vs is useful to compare what a fit can do to what your character can do, but remember that that isn't  a feasible short term goal. Learning this process is the best long term way to plan out the ship fits and skills you need to do whatever you want to do in eve.
---
A Red Sphere result means that only 1 probe you have out was in-range of the true location of that signature.  This location will be the furthest point on the red sphere from that probe (ie, the opposite side).
---
The size of the sphere only indicates how far your probe was from the true location, which is somewhat derived from your probes location and size, but nothing to do with the signature type or difficulty.
---
Me too sometimes, but what would we do without eve
---
Are you suggesting they cherry pick data that most effectively promotes the agenda? THAT IS HORSESHIT!
---
Oh, another one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c1gbe4/why_not_spicy_it_up_by_putting_a_cap_to_blues/
---
Give all of the logistics ships reduction bonuses to logistics drone bandwidth, reduce the drones V requirement to III, and increase their drone bay volume.
---
I'm no nullbear and I think they are using cherry picked tainted data.
---
The better question is what other games do without EVE? I heared a large influx of EVE players is unhealthy for most other games.
---
Thats because your playing competitively. Your constantly trying to find a routine way to win but other players are also trying to overturn your routine thus  forcing you to constantly seek new optimizations. However at some point this will become boring once the player base has figured out the ideal way to play.
---
That's why they changed it to kill x number of rats for your reward. It  gets people to log in and play for a little while. In High Sec it's a 15-20 min hunt some days unless you're willing to spend the time running a mission. I've noticed an increase in the number of people in High Sec since the blackout too.
---
More like, 310 T3Cs with slaved mach/gilas on your fleet vs our 400 feroxes wasn't a fight we were going to win
---
Ishtar will be best, Gila, Domi, Myrm are also options for subcap nullsec ratting 
---
Myrm is a bit shit imo so you’d be better off with a Domi or Ishtar
---
Check zkillboard.com for fits
---
He was speaking about Daily/Monthly active users. Those are currently inflated through login rewards. After people logged in they logged out again. But, I'm sure that the OP was aware of that.

There are plenty of people living in a dead corner lowsec island for years

You do understand you're showing a graph with PCU but are disputing DAU...

This and also the sig bonus is really good cus HAMs/HMs have shit application, plus tengu is semi kinetic locked

mhm
---
I was trying to make a joke, and then I realized I haven’t played eve in about 3 years now cause it enabled the shit outta my depression
---
hoover is full of cuties
---
Easier to facilitate, yes. 
---
People will still be allied(blued) outside of the game, where it counts. 
---
It's a dumb idea to treat a symptom of a problem and not the cause of the problem. Why do people congregate and form alliances/coalitions? Because they're making the rational choice that preserves their safety. The easiest way to not get shot by someone is by being friendly to them. If there was a viable alternative to that, people would be all over it like a fat kid in a candy-store.
---
Black ops battleships should be able to use a covert cloak.
---
Goons started giving SRP for Myrmidon subcap ratting because it only takes a few ticks to pay for a loss, so until they nerf battlecruiser insurance that’s probably the most efficient subcap ratter at this point.
---
That's an excellent point. I suppose I enjoy MTG and PvZ heroes for the same reason: constant re-assessment and variation.

It sounds bad, but I utterly hate the concept of metas. Congratulations, in a game of 1000 options, you've managed to reduce it down to 5, which everyone has to use because if you don't use one of those 5 options you'll get destroyed or moaned at for the next 20 minutes to become one of those 5 options.
---
It's almost as if peoples sense of discovery and experimentation has completely gone down the drain. I have some great friends on FF14, but every single time they do a new raid, they refuse to go before everyone has watched a point by point 10-20 minute long guide. Where's the fun in that?!
---
I make it a point to try and avoid guides and wikis whenever I play anything now. They used to be for whenever you got stuck. Now they've become the things you look at before you even play.
---
The ~~270m ticks~~ DAU is out of control!
---
Or structure docking permissions. The more people you allow to dock, the more you have to pay for each structure. Nobody cares about a big blue blob of people that lives in highsec and has no structures and they wouldn't get taxed. This would also make it so that some corporations within an alliance might decide to not allow all blues to dock and therefore everybody wouldn't have safe havens in every system.
---
I'm not a fan of your your idea, but this might be a slight improvement.
---
A half truth or deceptively-used stat, sure. But calling it a "blatant lie" is ... well... a half truth or a deceptively-used wording.
---
So... hypocrite much?
---
To be fair is that a bad thing that they are inflated? It seems to me that this is a push to get old members to resubscribe. I was eve free for a year or so until I got baited on free SP during the capsuleer day event in May. That got me to be a paid sub again.
---
Or really, just double down on the burner mission concept, except replace them with a diamond type NPC so players actually learn something about what's needed to fight another ship.
---
Somewhere in the mission will be a clue to whether the NPC is kite fit, or brawler fit.
---
Remove tethering mechanic completely.
---
Make citadel module activation remove damage cap(all power to weapooons!) for X amount of time. Like 12h for keepstar etc. 
---
Cut entosis timers(less and shorter) or remove the whole system
---
Make drifter AI standard in WH space.
---
The mmo options are quite terrible. I know there's the Camelot redux that has some people excited. I never played the first, but beyond that, there isn't a good sandbox mmo out there.

Don't be spoon-fed ship fits.

Cruiser sized heavy bombers? No cloak, has a bomb launcher and citadel torpe , HAC ehp, logi cruiser sig radius, and role bonuses that make them do gank fit bs level dps to capital targets but cant apply at all to anything smaller than a mwd-ing battleship, even with web/paint support.  Maybe ewar drone bonus.  Not particularly agile or fast but decent warp speed.

Plus Loki has more low slots(I mean, tengu has more mid slots, but you can't do shit with them without enough pg), is faster and superior resistance profile

Looking at this def not  going to be resub come January.  I understand CCP Point of view but dont agree with it. As for if Blackout is going to be a success. I would  wait at least 3 months from inception. End of September when people  who pay for 3 monthly subs will be key .If by the end those subs are still there then yes. It will be a numbers game at that point which will determine CCP actions .

Turbo Nerd!!! 😂😂😂😂😂

Really gets the noggin joggin

As he said himself he likes it the way he wants it to be, now how it was supposed to. Eve is what is it supposed to be : how the company made it.

I don't get the "we'll put chaos in everything, people like it". People like chaos to a point. Why would they create massive empires for safety if they didn't like order too ?

Yes 3x T1 dark filaments for fleet doing solo and average is 60mil isk per hour.
---
Now I''m doing T2 dark 3x filaments solo and average 100mil per hour but sometimes I have rare loot(max was 90mil in one cashe) so it is higher overall.

All in 600mil Garmur fit I posted here.

Get rid of module overheating, it never been fun and just forces everyone to overheat and nano paste. Stupid af

You do know  500 plex costs more than a subbed month direct. CCP literally make more money of Plexed accounts thaan subbed ones. Put okay
---
We've had multiple other sp events in the last 5 years without CCP claiming the MAU and DAU were the highest in years.

You are literally replying to to a vni ratter.

Too stronk.  It's enough to literally maintain a system through any available mechanism for the sake of industry.

The checkpoint system is more desirable IMO as a gate to low effort farming.  That and the LP mechanisms I put forward to destabilize tick-tock dynamics.
---
Sorry, but mining in hisec is useless, considering the yields null sec denizens have. Prices for minerals have plummeted in recent years.
---
As many other people, I advise you not to mine in hisec. 
---
For me, I reccomend you try hisec ded plexes in Jackdaw, or nullsec exploration in interceptor, if you have the skills.
---
Ooh the money i made stealing from PL POSes, miss those things

An Entosis like module which can reverse the anchoring of a structure and if it is low powered change the ownership after a process of reinforcement

Naga did have torps for awhile (on sisi) it was insane.

why should I be any better? do I owe them something?

Oh shit player are organized since 10 years, now we need to nerf it.
---
First of all , do all of the career agent missions! Even if you dont think you have an interest in that activity do them. They are relativley straightforward and reward you with big isk / ship/ skill rewards for a new player . 
---
After you complete all of these you should have several million in the bank and 5 or so ships in your hanger , including some combat frigates, multiple ventures , 
---
Industrial ship(x2 i think) and a destroyer . You can sell the excess ships you dont need for even more money too! 
---
High sec mining if a very “baseline” activity . If you really need a few venture cargo holds worth of isk to get something like a new important skill book, or to finish a fit on another ship then by all means. But sitting staring at space rocks watching your cargo hold fill up isnt very exciting and if im doing it then im usually doing something else like netflix . 
---
In your venture though, your not going to be able to make big bucks high sec mining , because if any new player could do that , then either everyone could afford to plex accounts for free or plex would just rebalance to the price point at which high sec mining was relatively as profitable . 
---
Others have posted new player activity links and such , and with eve you can try out a number of different things . 
---
One common recommended activity is exploration. You can “practise” in high sec by scanning down highsec sites and cracking open the cans although in highsec these are usually quite poor in value , but it lets you learn the process and you can move onto better but more dangerous sites.
---
Generally newbro exploration consists of starting in highsec and finding a low class wormhole to unknown space, in side you can come across pirate faction and sleeper explo sites . You want pirate facton sites. These have the potential to be just as valuable as nullsec (no security) space where they can have several hundred million to several billion of isk in goods in them. Now while you pickup your jaw off the floor at that juicy statement . There are many reasons why you may very well die and be podded multiple times before you even get safely home with one cans worth of loot. 
---
You need to learn how to scan down and bookmark holes on both sides, check they are not about to expire, know how to use dscan to check for other ships , know how to evade or attempt to at least , bubbles on wormholes (crash the hole) and be able to get safely back to a highsec trade hub with your loot , And until you do that billion isk blueprint in your cargo hold could get destroyed any second if a player chooses to engage you .  You probably dont know a number of the above points but they are just there to highlight the amount of learning and challenges to overcome before you could be successful at explo. Definitely have to be comfortable being able to lose say 10 fully fitted exploration ships before id recommend seriously getting into it . 
---
If you have omega , you can setup PI (planetary Interaction) . Bit complicated to setup but once its going its basically free passive income . If you do it in null you can easily make 1bil/month . Much less in highsec but still in the tens of mil every week ish 
---
FW (Faction Warfare) youll need to know how to get something called Loyalty Points(LP) , how to turn that into items to sell, what items to buy so you dont waste your LP, how to avoid other players on gates and inside FW combat sites (Complexes) . Potential to get 50mil/hr from this though will likely be substantially less at first . 
---
Mission running to grind standings to level 4 missions, can be boring and level 1 missions dont offer great rewards but once you get your rep up, and cAn fly something that can take on a level 4 mission ( battleship , well fit certain battlecruisers like the gnosis) then you can make pretty  decent isk , maybe something like 20-30 mil /hr depending on your completion speed, the types of missions offered and if you take time to salvage and loot the field after you run a mission etc . 
---
One under appreciated money making source is to fit a combat destroyer and go hunt low-sec asteroid belt rats , you can find rats with 250k bounties or more in low sec belts and you only need 150 dps to relaibly take them on , as soon as you pop them you bank the liquid cash so no need to convert LP into items then sell them, or sell your explo or PI loot etc , you just get the money within 20mins. So you can fly about belt to belt and kill rats that way. Is possible in some well fit frigs too tho might be a bit slower. 
---
Need to learn how to use dscan to see incoming players and in lowsec be aware of who is in local where everyone there could be a potential hunter 
---
Another avenue could be joining a new player friendly alliance . Im bias as im in BRAVE , but there are others like pandemic horde , karmafleet etc who accept all new players and that gives you access to nullsec space that those alliances own and protect . So it can allow you to make much more money with some degree of safety ( this is now post blackout when things in null are less safe )
---
At least in WoW, I believe that's still alive at the very top end. The guilds racing for world first always involve crazy strategies. I can remember when world first Nepharion involved stacking DOT dealing classes to make the most out of a mind control debuff which increased your damage by 1000%, which was intended to make players kill other players, but with a bit of CC, you could remove that threat and drastically increase the dps on the boss.
---
Yeah thats communism
---
we were never this close to the bonus payout deadlines from Pearl Abyss though, so that could have played a role in that...
---
Some form of filler module (with low, medium, and high variants) that doesn’t cost any fitting. All the module does is absorb a % of the heat damage from the neighboring modules. Make it require thermodynamics V for the hell of it.

Arbitrary penalties will not make people that want to group together and play together, not do so. Also, adding benefits will not incent people to group up that do not want to or are socially unable to do so.
---
These two are a good start. You will be looking for dens and refuges, they drop tags which can be worth about 1 mil but you mostly look for the escalation in low sec which can drop like half a bil on the high end.

BUT THE PCU COUNT IS DOWN RRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Like you said, the game is 17 years old. What people liked in Eve is a little out of sync with the current gaming trends. CCP said themselves NPE is bad and game is too complicated to keep players in, not even talking about how highsec is boring.
---
So you have it, nerf nullsec where the most interesting things happen, so people will leave it, while lowsec is dead as always. What will happen then ? People unsubbing, leaving the game never to return.
---
Not hard to see where it leads to. Eve has always been a game where you stay because you actually have assets and a community. Remove that and you kill whatever's left of it.
---
Ah yes we need T3 for frig, BC and BS
---
Honestly I think this video clearly shows why so many people never try EVE or don't stick around for long. You watch the trailers and it's close up shots of ships fighting, dog fights, missiles exploding against hulls, etc.
---
In game, combat is just blue and purple Xs moving around the screen and circles filling up with red. From a visual perspective, EVE combat is really meh. All of these detailed models and effects go to waste. It all reminds me of the old tabletop war games I used to play with my friends where you would move little square counters around a map.
---
I was watching a bomber's bar fleet on Twitch the other night. Hundreds of ships in combat, a Titan getting dropped on top of them, all of it looking like nothing special at all to someone who never played EVE. 
---
Imagine being someone who has never touched EVE seeing the Triglavian Invasion Trailer with the three ships in the mission and the hug Trig fleet emerging from the darkness. Now imagine that player excitedly signing up for EVE and realizing that the game is nothing like that at all (visually).
---
So you run into the Same issue as everyone Else i talked to about this.
---
The data you presented just Show the login count but Not the actual activity esp since it is unkown to us how many of these toons are bots or alts.
---
We can only proof that the Overall login count went down but we are in no Situation to determine how many of these logged in Accounts are unique players.
---
Imagine if this other guy was thinking the exact same thing about you, and it seems to fit.
---
Idea:
---
Add timers to anoms on respawn. Just like wh space. This will force caps to move around. No one should be able to sit on one spot or system for hours printing isk.
---
Another idea:
---
Limit anoms by ship class/size.
---
Self explanatory.
---
oh and offensive links such as CYNO jamming links mods.
---
the sun hurts my skin, I'm fine where I am, thank you.
---
technically, he said highest in the past five years. But if you put it into context what he says afterwards he certainly means highest for the summer.
---
&gt;[..] this month of july, we have the highest MAU and DAU in the past five years. just to give you a sense. So, if I just look across our matrix eve online has not been this vibrant over the summer in the past five years. [caneiros explains MAU and DAU then]

Economy of scale has always been the game, the hard part is laundering that money. 50 ventures at 2m an hour is still 100m an hour for basically 0 effort
---
If they do it in 50 alpha it is 2.3 bil a day with zero risk or overhead beside setting up.
---
What system is it?
---
Give me a MMO where this doesn't happen. EvE is a fine game because it took yours for people to figure it out.
---
Hell, standard MMO are figured in less than one month out, and when they make expansions it's all figured out before it's even released.
---
Stagnation has been caused by CCP and CCP only : citadel &amp; timers, no balance changes, skill injectors...
---
Mobile siphon units were such a dope concept but goddamn were they poorly implemented

The tax has a name, it's make is Tyrannos.
---
Make it a doomsday type module for titans, that prevent warping/jumping and most importantly remote assistance of any kind for the titan that activates it

Stasis web bubbles

Tier 3 refers to the hype, abby, rokh, and mael, back when ships were classified into tiers. These were supposed to be the fleet battleships (save for the hype, which never really fit the mold). 
---
Giving them a damage multiplier against cap hulls would add an interesting dynamic to a fleet fight where the main tactic now is 'hot drop o clock'. 
---
Sure, you will pop a lot of BSs, but youre gonna bleed caps like crazy, too.
---
Giving good advice for people to help themselves... You do realize this is reddit right?
---
Nothing wrong with mining to get a feel for the interface. I left Goons and Null and am chilling in my old home in Low/high while i decide my next move. It's relaxing to chill in highsec and mine sometimes.
---
What. Are you talking about CCP? I used the support 2 times and it took weeks until i got a reply and i never got a compensation. Thatswhy i dont even bother anymore with the support. 
---
Sounds like they have improved. Ill file a ticket because the skilling spree event is bugged since day 1 for me.
---
I think once they are setup they run them on shell accounts.
---
I like that.
---
I am just *that* bored at work today haha
---
You can't fix stupid
---
It's problematic if you misunderstand cause and effect. CCP made changes and then looks how they affect player behaviour. In the past there haven't been login rewards in the summer I think last autumn/winter were the first login rewards in general. Login rewards can be a good tool to keep new players around for their first month which is the critical time if a player stays around or not. The other tool is to boost figures to make you game look economically better. That doesn't work in the long run though.
---
Well i guess we will see if it works, but in my short eve life 4-5 years (playing full time with no breaks) i have seen so many people droping the game, lets say my corp in those years had 100 new ppl and of those 100 ppl only 7 maybe 10 have stay in the game all this time, but now ccp is playing with theyr loyal player base and i relly dont belive thats a good idea, and the other biger companys knows that, so what the other companys do is make "eve2, eve3,etc" in that way the loyal player base can stay or move where they suits them and the newones can chose to, as a new player is always hard to go to an old game and get atached becuse as new 
---
 player you are years behind.
---
Why are you creating new reddit accounts to ask the same question multiple times?
---
Hideaways are also usable. They take few seconds to finish and you can get an escalation up to 4/10 or a faction spawn.

Barely did vni ratting. I used to be a credit card warrior till some unexoected bills came up.

Does this comment really need a /s?

I've been playing plenty.  Was in a two hour fleet yesterday fighting over ihub timers in Scalding Pass.

And yeah, I prefer that to highsec fights.  So does horde.  We just don't care to fight over highsec when null has better mechanics and is generally more interesting.

---
"hey, let's let rich people pay to have hostile ADMs suppressed."  In what way would that not be a buff to the richest person in the richest alliance.
---
I never agreed with that. The fundamental problem with Eve's economy is that ISK and sov are positive feedback loops. Having tons of ISK makes it trivial to get more ISK, and having tons of sov means you can churn out supers and... get more sov. Requiring more player involvement to hold on to assets (which seems to be a major theme of this talk) would absolutely hurt the rich old players more.
---
Make hisec-hisec region gates (or maybe just faction borders) have a tax based on the market value of the ship+cargo making the jump, making low sec smuggling more profitable than hisec shipping.
---
No.
---
Ah right, of course. Well it might make CCP more money in Plex sales for those that don't rage quit and biomass
---
Yeah have to be anchored and primaried. If ur links then they wouldn't know what to shoot right off the bat. Or what to scan down.
---
It gives more control to the player having offensive links.
---
This guy just invented the titan bridge.
---
Every time you pod someone, releases a cloud of pod gas that can be harvested with gas harvesters. Pod water could then be used to make high level drugs. Water would be tagged with the name of the player that got podded.
---
Seriously...didn't even do basic Carrier operating well. Learn how to select/unselect your ship when issuing commands and you could have killed the sabre and others on the way out of the first bubble. You probably could have avoided the DD. You just got lucky they didn't have more.

Netflix and Drill

Literally every time in eve's history someone has had this attitude they change has hurt new players more than old ones.  But surely you are right and this time will totally be different.

The map is way too spread out, stain drone lands venal paragon soul are a pita to access, i dont see how it s a bad idea.
---
Sigh, all the shit pilots flying the biggest ships...
---
As many people say hi sec mining is quite bad, if you want to try out just do it but dont expect any good isk, when you want to make more money start do something else or join null corp and start mining there.
---
Literally every time?
---
It's a reused capture someone used for a propaganda post a week or two ago. It didn't fool anyone then either.
---
Name a change to eve that was intended to help new players that didn't help vets more.

Worst piloting period

No, many are required for additional modules and ships.

Make jump ranges between regions excessive, so geography matters more, especially with capital movement! LXQ should be exemplified by all 0.0 inter-region jumps! 
---
And give blops enough range to cross that expanse...

Mobile cyno inhibs jam active cynos, not just prevent new ones.
---
Honestly dude I haven't played in four years, I can't remember that far back, let alone CCP's justification for changes (which is rarely public)
---
They say later in the interview that excluding the people just logging in for rewards, it's still higher. I'm sure some people get through that, but it's fairly trivial to filter out people who login, meet bare reqs, log out shortly after.

And put a PANIC button on it, and when your AFK it will start by it self when tackled and announce exact location in fleet.

You know logical statements are not allowed on reddit

Give jump range a bonus determined by the size of the cyno ship. The bigger the ship, the stronger the beacon, the further a ship can lock onto it.

&gt;in which mouth breathing carebear conflates two different statistics to fit narrative

Most of this is out of context,  listen to the whole podcast to get the full picture. Thanks Suitonia !
---
Why is it worse?
---
If FF14 can have a 4 person mount, Eve can have a Space Uber Service complete with abductions, kidnappings, ransoms and hilarious incompetence.
---
Really tho, I like this idea. Wish you could dock with caps like this too.
---
&gt;We should kill asset safety... You can accumulate too many things. To have such much weapons of war you need fuel to power them, the fact that you can just have titans lying around is not natural and not good gameplay. Something needs to be done, it's not natural, it's not eve.
---
So now, after goons have comfortably secured their place as the biggest super/titan force in the game lets remove all the safety from citadels so that noone else ever has the ability to ever contest them, and gets wiped out...
---
No. There are ways to play EVE that don't even need any of those skills.
---
And just as in Planetside imagine RAMMER with short enough ram cycle on stealth bomber.
---
Shame. I woulda bought em
---
Clone vat bay on carriers or t3 blops would be awesome
---
Large bomb launchers that do twice a normal bombs damage
---
Separate the empires by putting relevant FW lowsec areas between them. 
---
Amarr and Caldari would be linked by highsec, but separated from Gallente/Minmatar via the two warzones.
---
Surround all of this with general lowsec, and outside of that is nullsec space.
---
That's because caps are broken. Dont fuck over everyone else that's get effected by tidi because you're to lazy to fix your broke ass bullshit game balance.
---
No, botters will abuse them
---
The recruitment program already gave new characters enough free skill points to spec into the magic 14
---
just gank em lol
---
Just cynos for citadels then. Hot drop 250 fortizar on 5 roaming cruisers when?
---
In somewhat related news, a Velator fitted with light neuton blaster 2s works brilliantly for suicide ganking Ventures.
---
he a new boy lee him alon
---
Make an alt Corp, put your clones in it, share materials and resources in corp hangers
---
Falcon strikes me as the sort of guy that would actually say Yolo out loud.
---
I mean, in the age of Titans I can see why these skills seem insignificant. I would argue that they aren't needed for a lot of other activities in Eve, and it's important to have some skills for defined roles that make Characters more unique in their abilities.
---
Haha thanks anyway :3
---
how the fuck do you tell whats going on with those graphics and uncolored overview, ew
---
Awesome, so I can assign my alt as a nemesis so I can have a neutral logi alt while I griefdec noobie highsec carebears. 10/10 Pro PvP!

I need this.

Make CCP cut one of your fingers of when you lose a super.

C4, no effects

They really aren't needed for a while anyway.
---
For a lot of the talk whenever he mentioned "making it easier for new players" he was talking specifically about the npe and getting players into the game.
---
That said, it also kind of sounded like he was trying to justify reworking FW. Traditionally FW has been the kiddy pool that new players and people who just really like small frig fights get to play around in. Citadels really badly fucked with the "difficulty mountain" that he described and made FW and nullsec more of a homogeneous experience than it was pre-citadel.
---
I think he is less interested in making an overall simpler game than in making it so that there are places for people who don't want to have to have 10 rorq alts, 2 Titan pilots and more faxes than god. I also don't think that it's necessary to really skew the risk/reward balance of the game toward the "new player friendly content" to make things like FW a viable kiddy pool.
---
Call me cautiously optimistic on this front
---
A high slot passive module - Rorquals Only - Double Drones Yield/Damage - Cannot be fit at the same time as a panic.

I did make a ticket before commenting this.

There is no best ore to mine.

Go play the game or uninstall. Don't mine.

Isnt niden a guy?

I read this then watched the video...  You're spot on.   Then he tried to attack the flycatcher with anti-capital fighters....

What is your Discord name? I'll send you a few cheaper ones that reliably run T1s.

There are some pinned fits in the Discord that will run T2s
---
The blackout will permanently hurt nullsec bots.

They may adapt to be better than now, but they are still permanently made worse.
---
Lmao top tier pilot PL 2019

You group them up, get a cheap battleship with smarbombs and kill all of them at once.

k

Because they look the same as new players.

Lost your imicus due to blackout?

[http://prntscr.com/oksrb9](http://prntscr.com/oksrb9)
---
CCP just play with number, you can make this number means what you want to said.
---
They will explain soon the average activity of player is highter , so DAU is highter. 
---
But all is : what they call activity? If it's different activity, so yes i can trust DAU is easy highter with reward on login, event, and people who take gate to roam more than just mining... beacause mining count for 1 activity, now the same player will coutn for maybe 6 or 7...
---
Hilmar will not said in a  broadcast : yes we have fuck up , and we need to fire some dev, and people we need to fire first is me and falcon.  
---
No he need to said everything is fine and create more disruptive activity and praise for one moment it work. Other case he will looze a lot more than just eve for him...
---
I've been playing Eve for 5 years oh, and I only recently started mining about 5 months ago and I love it actually! I would recommend plagiocase or rich plagiocase. But veldspar works fine too.
---
Cool, bye.
---
I'm sure they'll be happy to know you were so weak that getting one character killed by a lowsec gate camp is making you quit.
---
75€ a month, JFC.
---
Wild idea you got there /s
---
That's be sure people haven't realize to just fire up the tutorial.
---
go to your nearest .5 system with a lot of people in it, combat scan it down and warp to the orcas that you scan, they will be mining afk on moons, boookmark the spot then go get your miner and the free ore that waits you.
---
Buh-bye......
---
I thought removing local would.of been good.  It wasnt.  Good for killing bots and that's why CCP used you for.  We've already seen as expected these so called roaming gangs stopping due to no bots  and no actual pve happening.
---
Killing them can actually be quite annoying for them, if you run dry their stock of Ventures they might start undocking in pods. Ventures are also exceptionally easy to kill, you can do it pretty easily with a gallente alpha in an atron, or bomb them all if they're close enough to each other.
---
Bumping them puts them out of mining range but is also a lot of effort because ventures are small and fast.
---
It's no more a blatant lie than you calling it a blatant lie.
---
PCU is not DAU.

They mean very different things.
---
I mean, good job? You are heard? You realize you didn't even post about why you're leaving, right? People have posted these for years and you are just rich white noise.
---
Elite
---
Tell us that the game is going back in to development but we can buy new ships that we can look at, walk around and sit in but not yet able to fly for a modest £500 fee.
---
I meant the clone specifically. How in all the videos she's like super hot and shit.
---
Oh, which type of veldspar do you mine?
---
Slowest brain in the East apparently too.
---
LOL
---
Looks like yo mama raised a bitch.
---
Yup, and if you look at those summers they go down PRETTY deep.
---
Ok everyone - the challenge is this 
---
Come up with a new boyfriend you want to see in your life. One that doesn’t exist yet. You must post what job he does, what his hair style is and how he treats you on your first date. 
---
I know you all have some awesome ideas for new boys, lovers, big daddies, and all sorts so let’s see them all right here. 
---
Let’s show CCP how creative is this SubReddit and the EVE community is.
---
brutal.
---
HOW WILL WE EVER COPE WITHOUT YOU
---
BYE THEN
---
Add a sixth “skill level” for ships that is earned by piloting said ship. If the first 5 skill levels are the theoretical knowledge to fly a ship, the sixth is the practical. Fly an orca every day for a year, and you learn to pack a bit more ore into the cubbyholes. Fly a freighter daily, and you learn to shave a few parsecs off the trip to Jita.
---

---
Leaked secret prototype modules of the empires.
---
Minmatar: Glorified magnet, mid slot, 25% chance on hit that armor/hull will be repaired by 10% damage dealt, only works if taget is in armor/hull
---
Amarr: Lux amplifier, low slot, only works for energy weapons, increases the output damage as well volatility of crystals used, occasionally causing damage to the ship its fitted to, stacks with overheating bonuses of the weapons
---
Gallente: Adaptive drones, only medium drone variant, adapts the damage type to the lowest resists on target, randomly causes drones to take damage, full bar of shield/armor/hull
---
Caldari: Emergency launch something something, works only on launchers, when activated one of the launchers will get 200% bonus to rate of fire causing the launcher to be burned out when all missiles are launched causing mild overheating damage to the surrounding launchers
---
Would actually like to see some of these in action tbh.
---
I read somewhere someone suggesting to give this ability to the Marauder Battleships via the bastion mode. It will give them a purpose in fleet combat.
---
yea, flip those flipping ccpers
---
Only if you add the level V time to the skills they unlock.  Which is a significant number of skills, including T2 ships.
---
Yes, make them baseline. Skills should imo have specialization as their theme. If I have one character maxed out in combat subcaps, I may have another maxed out in mining, or one in trading/hauling. No reason why I should invest into the same core time and again for all of these. It doesn't add an exciting dynamic, immersion has been thrown out the window years ago and although there is no doubt this would help veterans, it does so minimally while be a faster on ramp for new players to get stuck in, regardless of their playstyle. 
---
Ccp should have done this instead of injectors imo.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Eve is hard for everyone, even OLD players.  
---
I've been playing since 2007...still constantly learning new things.  
---
You can't think of it like other games, it's sort of in a genre of its own.
---
fire ccp fozzie, ccp rise and ccp falcon
---
oops those arent wild
---
Why am i leaving? 1. No normal local chat in nullsec. 2. Vni changes 3. Rifters which kill your vnis or rorquals. 4. I have to do pvp pubs and pvp is so boring in this game.
---
him pulling his fighters after half the vid and being like "guess I will just die" is also nice
---
What do you mean with JFC?
---
Very real
---
I'm more curious how is this NSFW

This is eve... you are NEVER free.  She is that one girlfriend who was wild, fun, and f*cking nuts. No matter who else you date or eventually marry, you NEVER forget or lose your feeling for her, ever.
---
No that will just rot on all the citadels in nullsec

More curious, or upset there wasn't porn?

&gt; after the nova settles
---
It takes *quite a while* for a nebula to form new star systems after a nova.
---
Dense or concentrated honestly but I usually stick to highsec in my orca and mine rich plagiocase. Sells well and my orca can hold a ton so I basically strip a belt clean but it takes awhile with my drones

Your whining will be sorely missed...

Right? Days! Maybe even WEEKS!! /s

I'm sorry i hope you can cope with it

https://youtu.be/Qy9_lfjQopU
---
They hang around, as in you still have them trained, but I can confirm that they are not usable as an Alpha. If and when you go Omega again they will be fully trained and usable once again.
---
You don’t need these skills on your jita trading toon, your PI alt, your indy alts or your cyno toon. So they are nowhere near as universal as the learning skills were.
---
Make an event where sleepers/triglavians abduct a random ship from space and put them in a randomly generated arena in a random fleet against another equally RNG'd gang.
---
Call it teamfight tactics.
---
..but make them one way, you can only enter stain never leave.
---
Go back to the sandbox. Simpler game, about territory control. Too many "gimmicks" now, all about impulsive crap, "rewards" to entice you to login. If Eve was working properly, you wouldn't need "enticing" with free stuff to login.
---
The faq is this dude doing
---
I thought PL was good
---
PvP in this game is about as far from boring as you can get compared with other games
---
this is a fair critique of eve videos, or would be, if they were intended for general audiences 
---
but they're not
---
I didn't make this video hoping to lure new players to the game and you really can't criticize me on the basis of not doing a good job of it
---
Ah ok. Mining drones require Omega time right?
---
Yes it's why they will never said we fail. Maybe they will said it ... after win the bonus.
---
Porn
---
c but not me :smith:
---
I mean, you have groups of people that would just destroy every system in the game to grief people.
---
get owned hahaha
---
This is fake. Falcon said people did not unsubscribe.
---
AT can help then through this crisis.
---
inb4 they release it, but only applies to new corpses.
---
Rat ears/tail for NPCs
---
It's minimal and as others have pointed out the actual cost of fuel negates it now.
---
Pretty sure they do ya. Are you alpha?
---
It just feels like a massive stretch, and if that's his strongest reasoning it's pretty weak.
---
This is the most boring pvp of any game forever.
---
Mithinks you doth not realise what your suggestion would entail, every time this happened it would require massive changes to the client, the api, the database. 
---
Solar system information so far as what is in there, is static. You can't just detonate a solar system without nuking a little thing called referential integrity.
---
They aren't required though. Only on certain ships. Like my orca can't fit mining lasers at all it's all drone mining with a boost to their yield.
---
Falcon is an asshole
---
I think I just blue myself
---
Fair enough. [tasty](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6hmrpg/this_carebear_is_done_with_your_shit/)
---
Just look for active systems in zkill.
---
I prefer "Bus", because if it goes below 50%; we will explode.
---
No its easy 1. Alt + F4. 2. Uninstall
---
You will uncloak once you've booshed 100km away.
---
You didn't need them on those alts either back then. They were useful, just as they would be useful on Indy alts, pi alts, a hauling character, etc.
---
There was nothing absolutely mandatory about learning skills, if you were training for something minimal and specific on an alt you wouldn't even bother with training all of them either. It would have been a waste.
---
You think hes gona he the only one to go ?
---
wouldn't this make it even more risk averse to use supers?
---
ORE Titans
---
Since there are no limit on corps in an alliance, a bluelist tax would achieve nothing
---
PL anno 2019 what have we done
---
Good. Less supers, more subcaps, more fun.
---
Take my upvote!
---
Honestly, considering veldspar is kind of up there in price there's not much point to look for anything. Veldspar is everywhere and the other ores more valuable atm are all in null.
---
Well, I don't know if I would say that. But I can say that his statement about random people desubbing with large amounts of accounts being false... was indeed not an honest statement. I mean, unless they are going by the fact it takes time for the account to fall off.
---
&gt; For me, I reccomend you try hisec ded plexes in Jackdaw, or nullsec exploration in interceptor, if you have the skills.
---
That's kind of pointless advice though, isn't it... OP clearly stated beginner and your suggestions is a T3 destroyer or a T2 frigate, both which are unavailable to beginning players (and alpha players especially). :P
---
You do know that the gunning rights and docking rights already operate independently? Adding someone to the docking acl does not add them to the gunning acl.
---
What you are talking about already exists
---
But they were, lvl4+lvl3 on advanced paid itself back on any char under 4m SP
---
I'm curious as to why you feel that way. EVE is the ONLY game I have ever played that will give me a literal adrenaline rush. There is nothing like de-cloaking just within point rage of a Nullbear. And trying to do everything right with your hands shaking. Maybe you are just doing the wrong PVP for you. I suggest you give it a try outside of the 400 man null fleets.
---
All ores have just three types. There's regular, upgraded +5%, upgraded +10%. The names vary, but for veldspar, it's regular, concentrated, dense. Always mine the highest type if you see them.
---
I mean, it doesn't sound like a bad idea, but the balancing will be very confusing
---
What in gods name do you people keep going on about? There is no reason for them to waste time providing a bunch of data to some spergy ass armchair developers. They have access to it and they know the roadmap for what they want to accomplish. 
---
I've never seen a gaming community that feels so entitled to try to have such a say so in the development process as this one. Their mistake was allowing that sham of an organization that is the CSM to even manifest in the first place. I think this gave players a misguided idea of their influence over the game development process. People hardly know what's best for themselves in the first place.  
---
The stupid amount of shit this community tries to demand of the devs is beyond ridiculous.
---
We should not discount the subscription length factor. There is no reason to not continue to play until ones Omega time expires in a couple of weeks. We should see the decline in metrics fall off as Omega time switches to Alpha and chosen play styles are no longer possible.
---
CCP already share this data. I just ask they to make one entrance point, and not 50.
---
You haven't read post congrats
---
It sounds like you need to do something different in the game. Seriously no troll (in the hope this isn’t a troll). There are many different types of play styles, and it sounds like the generic 0.0 experience is no longer your thing, if it ever was. Maybe try out a WH group or something a little more spicy than being a target. 
---
Let’s be honest here, if you are quitting because of the local thing you probably weren’t having much fun in the first place anyways. Also no one leaves bc a ship got nurfed bc that literally happens all the time. Whatever you do GL out there o7
---
There needs to be something to liven up the blueballs or dunk mentality.
---
Ideally this would give the smaller entity more chance to deal some real damage to the bigger entity. Making it so people are willing to take the fight despite overwhelming numerical advantage on the opposite side will hopefully discourage N+1 gameplay and bring back the small gang.
---
At the same time N+1 will retain its ability to force a victory over an objective, but they should a group be willing to die gloriously, they should be able to actually do some damage.
---
I have no idea how to implement this.
---
What i mean is, only the largest groups would field them; because they can out-blob anyone else. So all other supers would be put on ice.
---
Dude, you know you can move to low/high sec and chat still works right? Look, I don't like the blackout either, but I'm trying to make a go of it. My kb sucks and I know it (I have a whopping 3 kills where I wasn't in a fleet, and two of those I died also.) I still love this game and I'm trying to get better, a little at a time. When I do blow up, someone else got content which we are all screaming for, and I'm all too happy to provide it, because someday I'll be the one looking. Does it suck for me? Yes. Am I broke? Oh God yes. (I'm space poor). But instead of acting like a little bitch, I'm sucking it up and trying to get better. If you are going to cry about it and rage quit, I don't want you playing my game anyways, because A: it's just a game, and 2; it's a game that doesn't have to cost you any money. Go play Star Citizen if you want comfortable and safe. I don't think any SC ships have blown up yet.
---
Deathstar when? I wanna deny my enemies their moon mining dammit.
---
IMO I would say yes. It forces new players to spend a long time training them. I would say that the majority of those skills could disappear and it would be a quality of life improvement.
---
Weapons upgrades and such should stay though.
---
Activating the MJD will decloak you, but it's still a valid tactic. A competent player/camp will still catch you, but it buys you 2-3 extra ticks since anyone trying to lock you will have the "Target lock unsuccessful." message for 1-2+ tries.
---
It is not at all a 100% reliable way to run camps, a smart player will spam lock you when he sees the MJD activation (and not waste time trying to decloak you).
---
Lol, you whiney bitches constantly crying about the skills you have to train in a game about training skills.
---
Fuck no, leave the skills as is
---
Can confirm. TEST has quite a few good guys in it, I fly with them often even though I'm not in Legacy.
---
"were they waiting for us"
---
There is definitely a balance that has to be struck. Losing everything is likely too far. But current asset safety is also too strong.
---
He is prob talking about the mechanics. Point and clicking to lock and orbiting what makes eve PvP unlike anything outside of reports with money involved is the risk involved and the meta game going on with spy networks and Intel gathering, I'm sure if your in goonswarm with your thousand other fleet members in a tidi fest with full srp for ships I can see how it would be boring
---
So much yes is this.
---
is ccp games paying u to shill &amp; why not if no?
---
it don't matter, nobody asked
---
You are better of using the cloak mwd trick.
---
You've posted this exact same comment three times now. Holy shit imagine being this frothing angry.
---
"Shitpost"
---
give me your stuff
---
Oh no a RIFTER is killing my rorqual !
---
You know, this actually isn't the dumbest idea I've ever heard and would play into CCPs "easier for the new guy, harder for the vets" strategy.
---
If each skill had a new injector multiplier attribute which was applied whenever SP was used, it would offer a fair bit more balance than the current situation, where specialised pilots can max things like supers while still remaining avoiding the highest level penalties. 
---
I forget what the exact figures are, but let's say Gallente Carrier took 2,000,000 SP to max. Give it a 5x injector multiplier so it would instead take 10,000,000 SP worth of injectors to max.
---
Those same 10,000,000 SP put into subcaps would be able to entirely max every racial frigate, cruiser, destroyer and battlecruiser.
---

Yikes, I said people would be able to \*know\* when this would happen. You want people to \*cause\* it? You monster!

That fool should level up his salt extraction skills.
---
As some one who just enjoys the game , pvp and pve I think I will be dropping some subs as well just not worth it long term, keep my main active obv.
---
Kinda looking forward to seeing the plex market crash and picking up some super cheap injectors.
---
That guy is so salty his salt overflown to another post
---
WILL SHILL 4 PLEX
---
Can i have all your stuff?
---
Repairing heat damage could also be cool even if it's not AOE. Imagine a remote module damage repair module, that works like current remote shield and remote armor reppers, but repairs heat damage.
---
I upvoted because it looked like a newspaper. Good job!
---
So 5 accounts, 15 toons.
---
What did you do with each? Seriously... how do you think you benefitted others, either those in your community or the wider eve?
---
thukker space is terrible. terrrrrible.
---
Well that explains your post.
---
Not gonna lie, I'm super interested to see that Rifter fit.
---
Kind of a shame we've been wasting some much time using bomber fleets when a different ship can get the job done solo, but you've got to accept the reality of the situation.
---
Agree with this.  Gone from 5 to 1 myself.
---
I’d be surprised if there was the required implant data on all those old corpses

I feel like were a large majority in a very represented group within this sub reddit. i read the notes from the talking i  stations broadcast and i have to say that i dont believe for one minute their claim of most subs and most logins I  months especially after they skewed their own data by adding a skill point log in event to attempt to entice people unsubbing to resub. I'm not impressed with the way this game is heading and I've un subbed aswell. my last two accounts expire August 7th and then I'm shelving my accounts. Just means I'll have $300 more a month to play with
---
If you don’t give away you stuff you’ll probably be back in a few months.
---
Op is just an attention whore. Won’t even follow through.
---
There is a great book for folk who have not taken a statistics course named "A Field guide to lies". I recommend that to people often.
---
TLDR: If a set of statistics are independently verified they may not be lies, but the way they are presented probably will be. Charts usually are made to favor the viewpoint of the person making it.
---
I think for new players, maybe the magic 14 could be a skill certificate to shoot for? For newer players who are learning the game it's helpful, for bittervets who know exactly what they want for their character they may not need all.
---
Can a stealth bomber fit RHML’s?  Those things are goddamn amazing.
---
Mechanics are shitty, the rush is all that matters.
---
I think you'd need to nerf the ehp a tad, up the sig radius and add the ability to warp to covert cynos to make them effective high risk, high reward whaling ships.
---
Botting will always make money. This botter has realized nullsec blackout breaks his bot program and hopes to make enough isk for when the plex prices inevitably fall.
---
All i did in the last few month was let 3 vnis rat some forsaken hubs by themself and have one rorqual mine with excavators. All under an umbrella. I played other games at the same time or watched netflix/youtube. I only played this game in one of the few mandatory stratops. It was so boring. I wanted to quit eve for a long time but i couldn't. Because i can't rat and mine like i used to i'm finally free.
---
bots are no longer impossible to catch at least?
---
Cargo expander lows, so it can carry more ammo.
---
That was my second thought after posting.
---
If you meet corp requirements its easy. Just remember to question your reasons for leaving and explain them to your former mates. Keep relationships they are really important for enjoying late game.
---
Ahh child, you should learn of what you speak. Init is literally siding with the enemy, protecting groups that are fighting against The Imperium. You guys need to decide what side you are on, that much is for certain.
---
oy vonen
---
But i wanted you to know anyway
---
What I would add to that, and in fact stress - join a Corp.  It does not have to be one of the ones listed above (as I don’t believe nullsec is a good place for true beginners), but join a Corp ASAP. The amount of things that will all of a sudden become accessible to you will stun you.  For example, perhaps you like mining (whatever, this game has something for almost anyone) Corps can open up moon mining, losec mining and WH mining including having older players to teach and guide you.  
---
EvE is not meant to be played alone, if you like this game, you’ll like it much more in a good Corp.
---
In Highsec you want Ice or Moon Ore from .5 systems .  But on that note: please tip the station owners as the Athanor uses fuel so that it can produce the moon ore . But mining is just to offset other activities in the game .
---
How about a BLOPs rebalance so they’re worth dropping on ships
---
it's people like you who will be whining that theres no one to shoot at in a few weeks time.
---
I mean, the cat's already out of the bag with skill injected capital pilots. There are tons of them at this point. This is just going to impact any of them going forward which, lets be honest, isn't going to make any real difference overall.
---
Well, if you consider someone who krabs/rats and mines to pvp, and subs multiple accounts and buys plex useless, then yeah not like CCP needs the money.
---
the sheer amount of joy in this guys voice makes me wanna play the game alone... even if I do not like it, his voice sold it to me :) downloading it now :)
---
I give it a week before they have it figured out with a new ratting ship meta, that as soon as a ship appears within 1au on d-scan or on grid, the ship is already in warp to a station/safe.
---
O
---
Either way I'm getting my excavator wet
---
Make you a deal. Lets wait. I am will to be the over all percentage of decrease is far greater in non super shield covered areas of null then they are in ones that are covered. If i they are i am right.

They're very worth it if you want to keep alts on omega time for free or cheap. It's probably the only reasonable way to have more than 3 chars online at once.
---
Quill!! Never knew you were a Rddditor! Love your Paradox videos, I am a huge HOI and Vicky fan!! You got me into Vicky! Would love to play with you sometime!
---
There are plenty of ships to fly, but also many you can't. Some modules (equipment for your ship) are locked. There are lots of skills you can't train too. 
---
Overall you are limited in what you can fly, but not really in what you can DO. If you want to mine, you can. Shoot NPC ships "rats"
---
I mean, it's literally called Old School RuneScape, if they made any big changes then it wouldn't be OS anymore, right?

Is this how you make deep safes now?

Nice welcome to eve man!! Didn’t you used to stream lost ark in korean? I just moved to Korea two months ago and learning the language, I would watch your stream a lot! If you have any eve questions hit me up I’ve played for 11 years. Also I’m in an active korean guild
---
I read the post, sounds like you are just a lazy bitch.
---
Alright so basically how it ended up working was there were two tiers of learning skills. You had the baseline learning skills and the more advanced. What people tended to do is to train the basic learning skills to 3 and train a bunch of basic shit before moving on and advancing those learning skills. If you had a new player, having them train all their learning skills off the bat would make them bored as fuck with the game and wanting to quit. 
---
If you were a veteran training specific shit for an alt, there were learning skills you may not bother with if your skillplan didn't need them. Not all learning skills effected all attributes.
---
Genuinely like this idea but what sort of range would you see it having? :)
---
&gt; The diminishing returns on injectors being linked to current SP is poor
---
Why
---
Oh my! Look kids! It's a unicorn!  
---
What do you mean Dad?  
---
I mean, someone posted an original idea and it's not utter garbage! This is Reddit you see, and most ideas are shit. That makes this moment extremely rare and special
---
doomchinchilla would never have allowed this
---
Well now you are
---
Problem is that making the change now further entrenches those that already did it.

Dw asset safety will be removed soon

Board my corvette in stations becomes board my super / titan.
---
Man, if PVP is boring, how does this dude handle pve?
---
I still get the EVE shakes.
---
I didn't know PL recruiting had gotten this bad
---
So there's you reason for quitting, you are one the many turbokrabs who only pvps when pings pop up. How about instead of sitting in a crappy rorqual lead some fucking mining fleets and make some friends. With those vni alts go to wormhole space and try some living out there. Fuck go on a day trip through those wormholes or go pvp in low sec.
---
I was out in lowsec in my tengu, and a crucifier flew up to my mission gate.
---
He then flew away but posted a link to his crucifier solo'ing a tengu with the comment "flex".
---
Apparently a tengu had just gone afk, and he just sat there shooting it for 20 minutes.
---
No, MJD does an active check at the end of the spool to see if it can activate.
---
The module does not activate upon initial click.
---
This includes getting scrammed during spool.
---
&gt;There are plenty of ships to fly, but also many you can't. Some modules (equipment for your ship) are locked. There are lots of skills you can't train too.  
---
&gt;Overall you are limited in what you can fly, but not really in what you can DO. If you want to mine, you can. Shoot NPC ships "rats", you can do that. You can fight other players for sure. I recommend you try all of it, see what you like.  
---
&gt;It's technically possible to make enough money in game to play for your monthly subscription, but don't bet in it happening.  
---
&gt;Have fun, and join some public help chat channels to learn as you go.  
---
&gt;I definitely recommend doing the "Agent" missions that pop up in a blue window when you start. "A Ship is been attacked! Go save it! ". You'll learn a lot about how the game works, and you'll come away with several ships and a good chunk of money.  
---
&gt;I'm Claytonius3 in game. If you add me as a contact it will tell you when I'm online. I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have.
---
thanks so much!  So you advise me to play it even without paying the subscription?
---
Can't it be both?
---
I think I need to find a better one. Thanks
---
What do i care about others? I only have my own wellbeing and my own goals in mind. My 5th account was skilling into my second rorqual. With my one skillfarm char which got me 4 injectors per month i would have my second rorwual ready by the start of the next month. My goal was to build up a 10 accounts rorqual fleet. I was ready to pay for every account with euros. I wanted to use the isk/minerals my rorquals get me to produce capitals/supers and titans. My other goal was to be able to build one capital a day. I started in december 2017 with buying blueprints and reasearching them from scrap. I have all component bpos for carriers, dreads and faxes on 10/20. I have all carrier bpos, fax bpos and dread bpos except the gallente dread on 8/16 once. I have enough component bpos to produce all carrier parts in one day. But with the recent changes my prefered playstile isn't possible anymore. I came to nullsec to get a 10 account rorqual fleet and get filthy rich and produce titans. I didn't come to nullsec for pseudo wh gameplay. If i would have wanted wh  gameplay i would have gone into a wh.
---
You can just hope the guy with the scram is too far away or too slow.
---
Ok thanks !
---
No. Activliy playing this game is too boring.

Bait is just common brevity for Guaranteed Content.

Thats not what they claimed. They claimed this is the best July in 5 years.

:shocked pikachu:
---
why do people have to be this retarded
---
Exactly this, and remember selling/buying regional bookmark packs?  Yeah ccp didnt like it either.
---
Sayonara, you won't be missed.
---
&gt; What do i care about others?
---
Well, see, CCPs design goals are exactly about making the world an engaging place to be in terms of interactions with other players.
---
If you didn't contribute to that, you aren't valuable.
---
he even said they didn't count those
---
Yes. I dont wanna buy omega time until I know what I'm doing
---
You're not Felicia but you are a Felicia
---
All you guys making fun of his skills need to keep in mind that this is pandemic hordes training alliance. he's gonna get there. keep up the good work.
---
Other players in eve online for me are just  npc with really good ai
---
Fuck you for making me upvote you.
---
That sounds smart, though I've never needed to add my accounts on a second machine.
---
Play for free figure out how the game works, train up free sp, then go omega.
---
the issue with gallente drones is the worst application in comparison to drones of any other faction. Although you apply more damage on paper with those due low tracking of the drones itself the practical damage is equivalent to other factions. So gallente is kind of hit or miss, if you get damage application higher - it is the better choice, if not then take Valkyrie (highest tracking) also exceptionally good in pvp due highest drone speed.
---
About augmented ones: don't forget drones are ammo, augmented drones are expensive ammo. Since you are not sure whether it works or not just stick to T2 ones, you can always upgrade as soon as you confident(skills, experience, personal luck) enough to use those. Anything beyond T2 is not neccessary a must it just makes your life easier and establishes QOL by using those. So if really need a little more ummf go for it.
---
Btw. if you wanna test fittings there is also Singularity server accessible via EVE Launcher. Use /moveme to be move to a wh, chose from the list a C1/C2/C3, look up whether it has a static C2, scan it down and jump through the wh to the new C2 in order in access some combat sites you can run for testing purposes. Since the loss on Sisi doesn't apply to your valet on Tranquility and ships / fittings costs 100 ISK each you can test to your hearts content.
---
u/CCP_Falcon
---
Good then i don't need to take care of it. I hate to move my stuff. Too much work.
---
Wrong. You will not boosh at all.
---
&gt;CCPlease make smarter NPCs that are more challenging to fight
---
&gt;What about fighting other players?
---
&gt;No that's boring
---
👍
---
Loki is truely the swiss knife of All t3 cruiseres, you can use them very well in combat because of the versatilty and the sub system for longer Web range making this ship the king in PvP.
---
The Tengu is also good if you use it as a damage dealer, besides this the Tengu is useless.
---
Proteus, armor making it slow, but if you go full retarded and you use it as podkiller like Santo Trafficante with Smartbombs and a cloak it can be fun. Other than that you can use it as hard tackle with Bonus to point/scram range but thats it.
---
Legion can be a good Support as Energy Neut or as dps Support but everything else you should use a Loki...
---
TBH Loki is OP AF, you can get a 100mn 5k speed burner with 70km heavy missile Plattform as kite Version with more than 40km Web range but also a brawler with +5k actibe Tank out with Guns or you use Drones and assist from far away and laugh in the enemie faces and go afk 🤪
---
But all of the t3c can be good Logis as Well!
---
I have a venture. but for some reason I stored it like 15 jumps away. What mining lazers do you use?
---
Methinks my job title says different, and on top of that i'm not entirely unfamiliar with EVE's API and SDE.
---
Nah because my bet is asset safety is next on the chopping block. Your shit will belong to someone else eventually.
---
this is what happens when u slack with your gifs
---
I also did pi with every char. Was planning to make them research, production and skillfarm.
---
That's why we have recons and cloaky t3s :D
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
PvErs have slow brains
---
also make all wormholes visible like anomalies! End this fu boring scanning-shit-fest
---
I’d go Brave newbies.
---
You can pretty much do anything, just with some limitations on how you do it.
---
Those limitations, in most cases, aren't too likely to become a problem in the early months anyway.
---
Goons and test were siding with panfam on this one...     
---
Since when is V0lta the bigger enemy?
---
Make plexes give lp points continuously instead of keeping one bored standing in one place for over 10 mins.
---
Thing is friend, right now they are on one side, tomorrow theyre gonna shift:)
---
&gt; Give the Proteus 400m3 of drone bay.
---
And you can only put T1 drones in it.
---
That could be, it took me months to find my first Corp.  The most important things to remember are:
---
1) Active in your time zone.
---
2) Good level of activity
---
3) Share your interests in the game.
---
4) Somewhat close to your area of operations, or you are willing to move.
---
Search the forums, use their public channel and or discord. Talk to their recruiters/directors as well as their line members.  Ask if they will let u tag alone on some of their ops, many will.  Get to know them soon enough you’ll find the right group.  Lastly, don’t be worried about leaving if it doesn’t work out, the purpose here is to have fun.
---
No
---
I'm guessing the OP isn't aware that standings were not always a thing, and groups had to use outside means to tell each other apart.
---
Yeah it was totally worth it long-term before these changes because this game wasn't still stagnant
---
 my tinfoil hat tells me the only reason this hasn't happened is CCP likes the multi box income from plex
---
Being able to call an API doesn't make you an expert on how the program is written. If you think referential integrity is something which blocks this kind of change from happening then you need to take a refresher on databases.
---
There's still a delay between decloak and being able to Target a ship. Same with recons, unless there are insta-locker recons (I'm not aware of any). Those ships will be in warp the instant you show up on grid.
---
So, make bomber and frigate pvp alts much much easier but make capitals and null fleets harder.
---
Just remove injectors ffs
---
Exactly
---
How do you recommend a returning EVE winner get started up again?
---
Havent been in game for a year so figured id be off on the balance.  From a rock paper scissors perspective fleet bs should be able to kill them but not as reliably as hacs.  And the heavy bombers shouldnt be a threat at all to hacs or bs except via bombing runs, but good luck with that not having a cloak and less agility than a SB.
---
OK.
---
Only if you can do this in hisec npc nullsec lowsec and wormholes
---
Or is this just another “please let us kill null blocs easier” whine “idea”
---
Lol, sure. Why the fuck would any sane person want objective data, its a shocker right. You should always trust but never verify.
---
"Involving community", fancy expression of doing whatever the fuck you want.
---
Only, this mythical blue donut doesn't exist. Alliances rise and fall, no group will ever truly take over. There is too much of a difference in ideologies and culture for that to ever happen.
---
Which will have no carebears to shoot at and unsub as well
---
Because I'd just make them neutral and everyone else red.
---
Cloak + MJD works fine for getting out of a bubble.
---
Only if the loot fairy agrees
---
When your Hel moves faster than my Tengu...
---
Oh and the excavators will be cheap as fuck by that point anyway
---
&gt; CCP pls hang yourself for me
---
You have like 4 comments on your last page of history saying falcon doesn't know how eve works and is shit. That's true but that's everyone in this sub so get over it.
---
I'd imagine your purpose with this data is to suggest how CCP is killing EVE with the chaos stuff or direction of game since you hate blackout. Just let it happen, if they kill it oh well - at least the CEO is actually focusing on EVE instead of more shitty side projects. If EVE has any chance to make it through this next decade - it will be because of what happens this year
---
Oh yes, if you aren't sure it's worth the money to you. The more you play on an Alpha (free) account you'll run into barriers here and there that require you to be an Omega (paid) account. At that point you can make the decision to pay, keep playing on Alpha, or quit altogether.
---
The EVE shakes are real man.
---
Standings don't matter. There IS a limit on standings by the way, that is why ProviBloc uses a KoS list instead of standings to signify their reds for the most part. Outside tools have long kept track of who is friends with who.
---
Uhh, that's wrong. I've done it dozens of times.
---
Right on
---
Thanks :3 I'll keep that in mind
---
No, they don’t. CCP either doesn’t have bot detection built into the client, or it’s exceptionally trash. 
---
Characters logged on for inhuman amounts of time should be flagged, mouse coordinates should be monitored and accounts continuously clicking the same position within set margins of error should be flagged, accounts performing actions on set intervals should be flagged. Measurable and identical responses to an in game stimulus across multiple toons should be logged. A neutral appears on grid and 5 characters all simultaneously warp themselves?
---
These are things that can be tracked and ARE tracked by other MMOs. The only difference is other studios are willing to put developers on the task.
---
I'd like to see them go but having joined late and before injectors i can tell you from experience that the first 6 months is hard work when you want to join in and basically get told fly a vigil of griphin.                 
---
There has to be some way to allow new people to join and be competitive without being so broken its abused
---
I hate that rush. I hate adrenalin. That's why i stopped solo pvp. The only pvp in eve where i got the rush.
---
Btw
---
No you can't have my stuff
---
Wait, those were removed?
---
Answer: you start your MJD then hit cloak. Just like doing mwd then cloak. You will be cloaked until the cloak module cycles. This will leave you with maybe 1 second or half a second of time un cloaked when it cannot repeat as your MJD launches you off. I have gotten out of dozens of bubbles like this with my command destroyers.
---
&gt; continuously clicking the same position within set margins of error should be flagged,
---
Cool, I mean, that's not how bots work, but that will catch macros.
---
&gt; accounts performing actions on set intervals should be flagged. 
---
Same, that's macros, not bots.
---
&gt; A neutral appears on grid and 5 characters all simultaneously warp themselves?
---
Why would they do this in highsec?
---
&gt; Measurable and identical responses to an in game stimulus across multiple toons should be logged.
---
You're assuming the bots are providing these.
---
Ohmygod. If amarr went nova, holy... the chaos from that!! \*jeezzzertz\*
---
I've been trying to solo strategic cruisers in a Merlin for years, so I'm jealous. Still haven't pulled it off. This is my white whale. Definitely tackled a few of them pretty good though, and ended up calling for backup to kill them when my dps proved insufficient.
---
Scoop pods and harvest implants.
---
Since the TTT treaty was signed. I understand you don't know all of the politics, but V0lta is literally taking ISK from Init coffers, and yet you want to defend them?
---
What makes you feel so entitled to think they owe you anything? 
---
Most companies run their games the way they want, and very few involve players in the development process in any sort of capacity.
---
Activating mjd immediately decloaks you *while it is spooling.*
---
That is to say, if you cloak+mjd, you're suddenly decloaked as soon as you hit the mjd button.
---
While it has its uses, it is not possible to use an mjd for this.
---
Yea.... go find yourself a single player indy game. Youll enjoy it more.
---
Your issues is you cannot seperate your game style from others, which isnt a strong position in an MMO, certainly not Eve Online.
---
I would actually be more than willing to speak to you privately more. But your 'i dont care what people think' and posting that you are removing 5 accounts from eve as if you truly believe that an entire organisatio  should change to suit you... well...makes me think our conversation would be frustrating, for both of us.
---
Top kek
---
They are idiots and asholes. The carebears will unsub. The hunters will unsub because they have no carebears to shoot at and build them stuff.
---
I don’t blame you.  I’ve been watching he average online players on the launcher... it’s rare to se wit break above 19k now sadly.  Before blackout was 22-24k daily and it’s only been a few weeks
---
Despite whatever ccp claims...  And whether it’ll be good in the long run i don’t know, but it’s felt empty
---
even in my alliance i don’t see people logged in or staying in, even pvpers are getting bored because, this didn’t change anything.  Despite the minority’s “i’m a wormholer btw” licking falcon’s ass thinking they have their golden goose with him because finally null is becoming as empty as wormholes....
---
It’s sad.  I don’t like it, i’m sticking around hoping it’ll become better.  I don’t care about the perfect balance or the krabs or the griefers. I care about the game being fun... and it isn’t for most that i’ve talked to on all ends of this.
---
please bring a hel of your own under a super cap umbrella =) the fact that they had the balls to drop in an area they have no control of says a lot.
---
Exactly, the exact numbers would be for people in embroidered polo's to worry about but this sort of thing
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c9iism/lol_a_big_lol/et1md15/
---
A deployable that creates a pocket of space which is big enough to hide some number of ships in it, but cannot be scanned or dscanned without entering it. Have it put out a beacon that is seen on overview.
---
I know right, how is pve not boring lol even with 10 accounts at the same time it's boring af
---
Then clearly you haven't been playing eve correctly this entire time
---
No i played this game for a specific reason and playstyle. Of course ccp can change their game however they want. They should just not expect me to continue to play and pay for it then. I vote with my wallet.
---
Remove Clone Jump times so i can jump between my clones faster so i can kill faster across multiple regions.
---
Thank you.
---
That will always be the case
---
If you think so. The carebears will leave and the hunters will have nothing to shoot at and nobody who builds them stuff.
---
Dont think its gonna go that far. From listening to the clip yesterday I got the impression that the blackout was just an event and that they wont fully implement it. Dont even think it was the point, but rather as they said,  just a test.
---
However, future events might be further shit. I really hope they dont just experiment for a year or 2 whilst neglecting to actually fix the real issues and then we all sit here in 18 months with just a shittier game. After getting shafted for quite some time because they wanna be edgy and cool and make Eve into what they belive it should be.
---
Yes, I've always been a big proponent of giving a shit ton more default skills.  This is a good idea.
---
that's some 19D thinking
---
They could add it to Bastion, if that's not already the case. Might make marauders good in fleet, in their subcap dread role?
---
You can't ragequit without even telling us what you're mad about. This is the worst rage-quit post I've read all week. Try harder. I expect to be both educated and entertained.
---
Clone vat bays on capitals can now carry generic jump clones, and are accessible to anyone in the same fleet.
---
Downside to these clones, you cannot train while in them.
---
1. it discourages use by long term players which limits income for the game dev and prevents them from following the meta with new ships like the Trigs.                  
---
2. It allows a fairly inexpensive process for creating perfect capital toons which exacerbates issues like the rorqual where everyone just injected a bunch of pilots to take advantage before it got fixed (still needs work imho)
---
3. penalizes new players that hit 5m sp or more before realizing that core skills were a thing
---
Yeah, because "fuck panfam" apparently. 
---
You realize non of this was my decision, right? But i can see why the guys at the helm rather shoot panfam then snuff.
---
I build my stuff for my Self. Nothing was lost.
---
Everyone does. My point is that you, and others that intended to have multibox indy empires but not fight for them are, arent what eve needs. We need more content for groups, and less for those that cant see the ecosystem as it could be.
---
the level of salt and stupidity here is mind blowing... "Ive been playing this game for months but actually playing is too boring so fuck that"
---
Structure Skins (yes i know money grab but damn it i want some)
---
Festival launcher for citadel, with even bigger fireworks.
---
Make a new type of clone, a pirate faction clone with perma death (no idea why i latched onto this perma death concept)
---
why not?
---
This... is actually a great idea. If rorq mining was more like carrier rating it would do a lot to curb rorq proliferation
---
I think people stay because of conflict and community, not building and saving assets. If what you said is true, we'd see higher PCU during this Empire Era, but it's the opposite. The game thrives and grows with conflict, we don't have that now.
---
What CCP seems to be hinting at isn't a nerd to nullsec, it's a nerf to the turtle and build an empire play style. The game needs it.
---
Mine not. I just unsubbed and left everything where it is. I hope they come to their senses and put the game back to the way it was before the drifter invasion.
---

Stop showing everyone my hel pilot 😔😔😔
---
Injectors were a mistake
---
this! or you can use the bodies to MAKE implants
---
Great, you can nitpick an argument, we're all so impressed.
---
I'm assuming bots are providing identical responses? Every nullsec VNI bot before blackout waited for drones to be recalled before warping when a neutral entered local, every single time. Not one would leave their Imperial Navy Praetors behind. When tackled, they all had the exact same response.
---
There's no bot detection, why are you assuming most of these bots are any more sophisticated than macros? There are plenty of VNI and mining bots that will undock in capsules and warp to a location and attempt to perform an action once they get there.
---
A reliable bot in any other MMO is going to be multithreaded with a thread for the primary task. You'll let the thread sleep on a random interval between actions, provide random camera movement on random intervals, interact with UI elements unnecessary to the task at hand, you'll click within the hit box of the desired action on a randomly generated coordinate. You'll take action to look as human as possible, and there are still ways to identify botting after all of that.
---
This is very much NOT what the current evolution of EVE botting looks like.
---
🤮
---
Redo Walking in stations, and let people play space barbie... but with guns... and bars... link it to nova.
---
Rare to see it break 19k.. what are you talking about? Every day at peek times it has 25k+ EVERYDAY.. even a couple of 30K+ players. Null has always felt empty, before and after.
---
Never tried a t3c. But this is one of my greatest moments in EVE. #newgoal.

https://zkillboard.com/kill/66249241/
---
The problem with a lot of ehp is that it becomes too easy to keep them on the field. The real downside of a SB is that if you catch it, it is dead. A single web and anything that does any amount of dps will kill it. If you remove that aspect of the SB, it becomes overpowered and that's what you've effectively done by giving it HAC ehp.
---
If they can't use a Covert Ops Cyno, they become so much less effective than SB because moving them is becomes too risky. Really, the only use I could see them have is bashing structures against an opponent that cannot contest.
---
Imagine a ship that cycles it’s mwd but eats 1/5 of your capacitor every time
---
To think that a couple faction smarties on those hels would have allowed you to moonwalk out much earlier. 
---
Also that piloting jesus. Like sure, shakes can cause you to make mistakes but completely shutting down when things go wrong in a 14b ship is a little silly.
---
That data isn't expected to change outside of a particular build of the client / api / database. It's kinda in the name. "STATIC Data Export"
---
https://docs.esi.evetech.net/docs/sde_introduction.html
---
&gt; The Static Data Export (SDE) is a CCP provided snapshot of static data used in EVE Online. A new version is typically released after every patch which changes the static data, though this may be delayed for various reasons.
---
Suns, planets, asteroid belts are all fixed with specific IDs and attributes. You couldn't just delete them without either a) breaking RI or b) cascade deleting on anything which references them, alternatively you have to start setting alive columns on everything, which then means most of your unique keys get borked.
---
You realize there is no chaos aka conflict anymore? That's a problem for the game. There's no incentive to go fight wars. So what's left? Turtle and build. This has caused many FC's to quit, and PvPers to find other games. You seem to be in favor of this current meta, but this meta has been going strong now for 3 years. It's time for a change.
---
Delete all chat channels, replace with voice chat.
---
Until you loose it eventually you’ll loose enough and end up space poor , two choices buy places with irl $ or go try your luck pveing again , but your isk will run out eventually if you are truly engaged in chaos.
---
That's why you sneak up on them under cloak, if it's myrm or a domi it can't warp before you can lock and tackle. Gotta play it smart and intercept.
---
No. I'm not a fan of "skills at 4 are fine", but most of these skills shouldn't be trained at 5 in the first steps as they don't make much difference initially.
---
What was everyone on grid shooting at instead of him? The nyx?
---
You are getting awfully emotional about this. I never said they owe me anything but I like transparency. 
---
Most companies period, its not strictly a gaming issue.
---
I like your attitude man, dying is apart of the game. hell the risk of dying gives me more content than actually dying or getting kills. Many changes in eve have impacted how i make money (NSA changes and site spawn rates) but as u said, suck it up and deal with it. This is eve if you cant handle risk or challenge then you really shouldn't be playing.
---
Being salty about changes that haven't even happened or been announced yet? 
---
That's a new low even for you querns.
---
Well, if you can't call in for backup because you have no corp and flying around null in a only-raw-storage-counts-fitted rorqual you are fucked by a rifter with a single point.
---
(disclaimer: if this move is for some capital-ship reasons etc not possible don't roast me, I'm one of these lame PvE guys, but at least with the knowledge to actually avoid PvP. That's also a Pvp-skill in my eyes)
---
You can at least spot where they're aligned to (if in, say, a Stratios) and bubble whatever it is they'll be warping to.
---
Alternatively, you could bump-decloak them.
---
I second this
---
I personally feel that capital skills should NOT be allowed to inject. But that should have been implemented from the start before Rorquals Online became a thing.
---
Watching you manually click your fighters MWD made my stomach turn.
---
Hold Shift, Left click the heavy fighters on the left (1) and then click the light fighters on the right (5). This will select JUST the fighters. Then hit F2 and they will all MWD.
---
Also, when you do that, you can hold E (Default Keep at Range button) and left click where you want them to go, and they will burn at the target (apostle).
---
All the while you can still control your Hel keeping it aligned to what you need to.
---
Nice job getting out though
---
The main thing is to not mine without a purpose. Sucking rocks to sell to buy orders is just being someone else's automated mining drone.
---
Look into getting into making stuff with that ore if you start mining a lot. If you roll your own frigates and cruisers you could start making your own gear to take into Abyssal sites, allowing you to easily reship consistently.
---
You could use the money from THAT to pay other people to mine FOR you (using buy orders). Over time you're paying new people starting out to do the low level work for you while you go out and do bigger and more interesting things.
---
And the circle of life continues.
---
everyone else was fit properly, This was this guys first time dropping and it turned out to be bait so everything compounded together into this embarrassing mess but he a good boy and he will learn
---
I don't know any players that can mine, unloading and warping off and back for 20+ hours straight. Lemme know what drugs you're using.
---
As a veteran pilot, i'd LOVE this.
---
If a newbro came up with a decent fitting for some frig I couldn't fly, it'd make it a TON easier to get into.
---
Sounds dank to me!
---
lmao look at this guys post history, how do you even become this salty?
---
It might become more confusing? But I would very much like exlusions all together on certain skills (maybe cap skills themselves or perhaps cap support skills), that way its still a train and in some cases long ones.
---
But idk, yours might be better. Could perhaps even up the SP for core skills.
---
stop copying my ideas from facebook pleb lol :D
---
Yeah I shouldn't criticize because we have all had this at one point or another.
---
&gt; it discourages use by long term players
---
Right, they don't need to catch up and this shouldn't change. It's part of the reason why people opened their assholes for injectors for the first place. Injectors were sold as a catch-up mechanic, not win more.
---
&gt; It allows a fairly inexpensive process for creating perfect capital toons
---
it's like a year of training to have all the jump skills and goofy weapon, bomber 5 and all the other skills to make a pilot from scratch. It's mass revenue for CCP. 
---
If you use less people will inject into capitals as reasoning it just makes it sound dumb, we want max revenue for CCP, not cut out their legs as they push this chaos theory.
---
&gt; penalizes new players
---
By letting them skill into whatever they want? Actually you're trying to penalize new players by time/resource gating capitals - that are on the block to get dumpstered by CCP as falcon/hilmar rewrite eve for subcaps.
---
I don't know that your proposal is any better than injectors as they are. Seems like bad reasoning got anything else or other renditions?
---
Did you know that there are people who build stuff (do industry) or otherwise pve as a way to pay for pvp ships?
---
New players are signed up for a lotto where they randomly get Asset Safety containers from destroyed structures. These containers are put in the deepest part of lowsec so they have to run a gauntlet.
---
Forget the Rifter, I want to see the Rorqual fit that died to it
---
Or how about he just he &gt;! Gits gud !&lt;
---
Your stomachs gonna turn when I stick my fist in it
---
Combat recons don’t need a cloak.  And either way, its a dramatic improvement
---
This is a prime example of someone who does not contribute to the eve ecosystem.
---
Honestly id rather see fighters less good at shooting sub bs, and motherships even worse at hitting any kind of subcap.  With these changes maybe theres no place for heavy bombers.  I wasnt specifically considering them as whaling ships, just something very threatening to capitals that cant be killed by capitals and must be hard countered by strong subcaps.
---
Let's not fix the problem\*
---
FTFY
---
I meant this as a joke, a Triglavian T3C would be broken
---
If you can't call for backup, flying a Rorqual is 100% suicide. It's just a matter of time. Even still, against a single Rifter you could always drop drones and obliterate it, or drop a depot and refit to core stabs, or just tank it until he runs out of ammo. Lots of possibilities.
---
Ban anyone and everyone that thinks joining a blue doughnut is good for the game.
---
Oh a shit idea thread. Well I'm full of shitty ideas, so:
---
Add a 5% chance for an Upwell structure or sov structure to skip all reinforcement timers when attacked. Not do the work for you (you still need to run the nodes or grind all the hitpoints), just skip the timer.
---
That way, any coordinated attack can't simply be ignored without risk, multi-tz coverage is valuable, and tz tanking will cease to work long term against a determined attacker.
---
bubye felicia
---
Bye. If you really want to make an impact or statement, contract all your assets to CCP and biomass all your characters across the 5 accounts. otherwise you're just full of sh\*\* just like your post.
---
The lower the security status the more lucrative the ore spawns are. So if you go to an area of space that is 0.5 the ore there will be fairly profitable for a beginner such as yourself.
---
Aside from not having thermodynamics trained (lol), I thought he did alright in an extremely stressful situation
---
judy stahp
---
I'm sorry, I'm confused about what looks emotional. I'm just trying to understand the idiotic entitlement on display
---
Bring back interiors like captain's quarters, but unique for each type of citadel. It doesn't have to be fancy, literally just what we had before but reskinned.
---
Also unfuck titan HAWs
---
All Citadels in high and low sec require starbase charters to operate just like POSs did. Certain offices will make you need more as well.
---
Skilling Spree is a permanent thing for Alphas, but once you hit certain SP milestones the mission pools and rewards and start having requirements of doing it in FW, low sec, null sec, or W-space (i.e. once you hit the 5 mil alpha training cap Skilling Spree objectives cannot trigger in high or low sec anymore and are more in the realm of 10-15k).
---
Give all the non-Amarr Recon ships a bit more combat capability compared to their Amarr counterparts. Enough so that the Curse is not the defacto Recon ship you always hear about. Move the Force Recon's bonus to Cloaking CPU to a trait, move all the E-war bonuses to the Recon Ships skill and combat bonuses to the Racial Cruiser skill. Give the Gallente ships a 75/125 drone bay with drone damage/hp bonuses, Falcon gets a full rack of 4 turrets instead of split 3/1 with a launcher, and ditto for the Matari ones for whatever they are bonused for.
---
And/or split the hull models for Recon ships. For the Gallente example the Azaru is now a Vexor model.
---
:)
---
Quill is a good dude. If you’re reading this: bring back your WTFactorio series for .17.
---
I think CCP should pay people to play the game purely to infiltrate and break up all manifestations of the blue doughnut.
---
A penny auction (paid in Plex) is started for all Asset Safety containers created, open to all players. Number of items and ships is shown but not value. Bids start at 1 plex.
---
Yes. Especially CPU Management and Power Grid Management need to go right now.
---
If a rifter kills your Rorq, then I probably would have suggested quitting the game too.
---
The Amarr take over the entire galaxy, to fight against the Chaos. The God Emperor reigns eternal. Jump drives used without the permission of the Amarr causes you to come out the other side a warp and twisted monstrosity. Sounds good to me. 
---
FOR THE EMPEROR!
---
You arguing over sites in a cloaked cov-ops?
---
JFC... idk even know what to say.
---
You’re both fucking stupid.
---
Have to admit as someone that's been mostly inactove of late and generally when they return they immerse themselves in PVE at first, the blackout has been keeping me away.  I slowly ramp up risk, and while I admit the general concept of the blackout is something I am so so on it's personally terrifying until used to it.  Just a kind of block right now on returning full time.
---
Nice shoop on the right boundary, color doesn't quite match.
---
&gt; Man, if PVP is boring, how does this dude handle pve?
---
You don't get the shakes when you sit in a 250 man fleet pressing F1.
---
maybe he should skill up ingame first. Couldnt even overheat because thermodynamics 1 wasnt trained. Doesnt PL have some sort recommended minimum skills to fly something to help newer pilots?
---
PEBCAK errors don't show on killmails
---
Can i have that rifter fit that can kill rorquals? :D thanks
---
As a gate camper, I love it.
---
Nothing more annoying than someone missing lock and being unable to decloak.
---
Being salty about your pet idea being casually destroyed?
---
That's a new low even for... uh, whoever you are.
---
He played the game for a while, so he propably has some skills, or even ceptors, although I doubt he has t2 relic and data analyzers.
---
If he is alpha, then good luck.
---
If a rifter is soloing your rorqual, you shouldn't be in a rorqual.
---
Can confirm, 2007 toon here, haven’t played in six years and have been active the last few days. Having fun so far even though I was carebearing and lost my Gila.
---
You are being super emotional over "people wanna verify shit". 
---
That isnt entitlement, thats source criticism.
---
doesn't this already exist, all of those skills have different skill multipliers? I guess what we would want is a different multiplier for an unallocated skill pool rather than training.
---
I don't imagine it'd be too hard to do that, since in the past they would do that with an exception of their own shiptype; which was rife for abuse.
---
"Sand in my sandbox!"
---
Upvote for Santa Cruz
---
Everyones a critic. Hey, nice vid and bring more. Entertaining.
---
Does anyone think they call it the time of chaos because they genuinely don't have a clue what they're doing?
---
He said kill asset safety.
---
They don't give bounties, boring!
---
Honestly, the problem has more to do with the imbalance with capitals more than actually having the capital pilots themselves. That's the entire reason people injected in to them in the first place.
---
No, no, no, no. "Streamlining" is such a slippery slope and it kills MMOs every time. Look at WoW. It started with "'fun' spells have no utilitarian purpose, so let's remove them", then to "unique class buffs are kept up all the time, so let's just make them passive auras", and now every class is exactly the same shit just reskinned with different animations and the game basically plays itself.
---
This is true
---
Well he has 300+ kills in a moacha, so he knows a fair share about using an expensive ship, but this is not about risking that hel was in no risk whatsoever, but extremely suboptimal piloting that just put at risk the subcapitals that are screening + the super itself.  
---
Unless the dude is back from a 3years break  i expect a super pilot to AT LEAST shoot the dictors, heck i would settle with locking them!
---
who even plays this game with a keyboard though. i dual wield mouses to click modules twice as fast
---
No just give them some kind of ROF or dmg bonus
---
Judy your obsession with fisting other dudes is both intriguing and frightening.
---
I think the bots have become sentient.
---
Being proud of being a known idiot... nice.
---
Eve isn't really free to play. More like a endless trial. You miss out on one of the most important things for an explorer, a cloak.
---
Cloak MJD works fine. That's how my command destroyers survive in Delve (mjd interacts with the cloak the same way as mjfg). But for some reason you get decloaked some point before your mjd cycle. Instalockers can lock you before the MJD occurs. But they also need to be in scram range, which makes you very hard to catch.
---
The other stuff is what has me concerned. All this about adding in more risk to more space like reducing player storage in stations, removing asset safety and local and large and small changes every week without reducing the cost to skill either in time or isk. They already have wormholes which can be even safer than null but have more inherent risk. They also added dead space and removed POS which was everything they just said that they wanted to re introduce. They said they like the new moon mining and want more like that moving forward but have not touched anomalies.
---
If you can’t be arsed to man your citadel during reinforcement hours against a few afk oracles then you don’t deserve to keep your loot.
---
We are reaching salt levels never seen before cap'n
---
Needs to be higher tbh
---
How do you think Incursions occur ?
---
&gt; Us older characters with &gt;80m SP benefit more from these free SP than newbros get.
---
This is not true at all.
---
A new player is dealing with actual skill based restrictions on even doing their primary activity (do a degree).
---
At 80m, you have the skills for many different activities and your life wouldn't change much even with another 1m sp
---
When they introduced the blackout I figured I'd just focus on PVP while I waited for this to be over- truth is instead of playing for 6-8 hours each day with 3 accounts it reduced to just claiming SP/starting industry jobs. Now Falcon says they should also remove asset safety from null-sec? Fuck this- if they also remove asset safety I'm selling all my stuff and moving out of Null. No way I'm going to risk 100B+ in a structure that drops it all when it dies.
---
Wishing rn I hadn't spent so much money on skill injectors and for a year of membership for my 3 accounts. Would prob quit for a while otherwise.
---
It sounds more like you're projecting. 
---
You're not entitled to have a source of information. This isn't a mob ruled collective. It's a video game that is developed by a company which is under 0 obligation to cowtow to the demands of an angry pitchfork mob. 
---
CCP can make whatever statements they want about their observations concerning their intellectual property. It is you and the people like you who are delusional in thinking that they have some sort of conspiratorial reason to hide the truth and are therefore demanding access to information you have no right to. You sound like a bunch of crazy people. Seriously, get a grip.
---
good idea
---
Include T2 drone skills into it.
---
look at the launcher numbers yourself compared to their claims then :p
---
psh  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74200718/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74200718/)
---
Merlin's kin therm lock makes it poor against proteus and tengu. Now that Lokis are so strong and nobody solos in a Legion, you should actually switch to a Rifter or Breacher, unless you can tracking disrupt a 0/1 web gun loki while fitting scramweb AB. Once in a while you could also solo a sniper Tengu with a T1 scanning ship if you manage to catch them.
---
If you cloak and MJD you will remain cloaked for close to 6 seconds before the MJD de-cloaks you. So your best bet is to have MJD skill set level V so it only takes you about 8 seconds of spool before you boosh. This only leaves you vulnerable for 2 seconds, which most of the time is good enough.
---
[Got lucky tackling a Proteus](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75613090/) in our space with my Magus alt once. Ended up solo'ing him once I got under his guns, as he only carried Null and Void :D
---
Sorry, this is a SHITTY idea thread, your idea suggestion doesn't belong here. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, sir.
---
Lol, you don't get "filthy rich" by multiboxing rorqs, or really doing anything that requires undocking.
---
So what you're saying is your mother didn't raise you right?
---
You are just an npc and don't deserve my stuff.
---
Oh just log in, what a fun way to return to the game
---
Can you explain what the difference between an Injectorthat has come from a skill farm, and an injector sold directly by CCP?
---
(Not that the latter is available. but if it were)
---
Other than giving the skill farmer, and market traders, a chance to rake off some ISK in the process.
---
Additionally, at least two scrams will need to lock you if you're in a deep space transport because of the built in warp core stabilizers.
---
To be fair if rifters can kill your rorqual you're probably going to be getting the shakes a lot mining too
---
Well this is the most boring "game" i have ever played. I am thankful of ccp for these changes. Finaly i can quit. I could not before. I was adicted to this aweful boring "game".
---
access/withdraw logs for corp hangers would be nice.  Smaller corps and alliances won't always have the membership count to support a proper market hub.  Shared hanger communism is a good solution to this, but is prone to people forgetting and 'forgetting to put ships back.
---
Next thing you know warp will have a small chance of making your toon go insane because of the things he's seen on the other side.
---
Injectors are problematic because they reward highly specialized alts, and some very useful alts (titans/super alts in particular) can be had for very low raw SP count because they can skip over every subcap skill. These alts basically can't be used until they have their capital skills ready due to the lack of investment in other skills, so only people who have relatively lots of resources already can afford them, thus making these super alts very much a "win more"
---
What you ask is completely fucking nonsensical. It should be perfect.
---
Also this already exists. It's called bombers. Coordinated bombing runs (like with actual bomb launchers not torps) of fleets of bombers. 
---
Not sure why this fell out of style....
---
Don’t know where you got that. Most of us trained 4+3 for int per wis mem on any non-main char, it was the forum recommended standard skill plan for any alt no matter what role, back when the eve-o forums were useful. 
---
5+5 paid itself back after 3 years, and was used on mains, but 4+3 paid itself back in only a few months.
---
The standard skill queue for any pvp, mining or indy toon began with making a Caldari Achura char and then:

This specific plan ensured you skilled the learning skills with maximum efficiency.
---
Look harder. I commented in this thread why i quit.
---
Mining is best done with friends on Discord while watching Netflix and drinking beer.
---
For laughs, this will probably *not* have a connection to Stain.
---
And here i thougt there is no correct way to play eve abd that every playstile is valid.
---
It's completely possible to start as an alpha, get to omega with isk and stay there without ever paying a dime.
---
My purpose right now is to relax and not have to worry. Isk and income isn't an issue. I didn't rat anyway so i don't miss that at all.
---
So.... Star Citizen.. I see what you did there...
---
My thought exactly. The MANLY way to quit is to livestream skill extracting all you so from all your toons and then blowing up your ship with all the injectors in the cargo hold. And then you blow up the wreck.
---
So there are people in PL that drop for the first time with PL?
---
I thought you were all elite
---
Funnily enough, Quill had / has a corp which is pretty fun. But given he's having to be a youtuber - his activity can vary. And hisec corp politics began to take its toll on members and they split in half. 
---
Which is kind of stupid when your purpose was to support the youtuber's community.
---
Anyway, i'm actively enjoying my own game :)
---
I mean, the EVE universe lends itself to it, largely because of the capsuleers and our sense of morality. It's probably a good thing we can't *actually* target ship weapons at planets because we'd exterminatus the entire cluster in less than a day.
---
Triple Rep Myrmidon, Cap Stable Dual Rep Domi, always just a Gila they are still godly. You could rat in a Carrier or Dread that's always a option but you could get dropped on at anytime. I used to do all my ratting in a Dual rep Typhoon and hit all the targets from 100KM out and then loot and slavage.
---
Here is my greatest moment in a [similar style.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75973859/) #newgoal
---
You do understand that the launcher number shows the current online characters logged in and not the DAU and MAU, right?
---
the absolute state of pl in 2019
---
Null still feels empty and even more so now when you can't gauge the  number of people in local. I ha e yet in ustz see this game even remotely break 19k. Ustz peek times are a bit less than pre blackout.
---
As an Alpha (free account) you can train 3 characters on 1 account. If you train each character on basic skills and after that specialize (mining, exploration, pvp / pve), that would give you a good idea of eve and the possibilities. Training all 3 in a row instead simultaneously could keep you busy for almost 1.5 year, enough time to know if you want to pay for the account, keep playing alpha or quit.
---
Easy. Warp vni into site. Drop mtu. Orbit mtu at 40 km. Drop heavy drones. Watch netflix.
---
&gt; Add a module to low slot that increases the amount of armor that armor reps repair.
---
Why would you want this over the extra EHP that resists give you too, such as from an EANM?
---
I put this in another comment. But if you want to make this EPIC and you want people to take you seriously. Sign up on twitch start a stream, take all your alts extract all the sp undock in a ship with all the injectors in your hold and have an alt blow it up and then blow up the wreck! That would be AMAZING!
---
That's why i used vnis and rorquals. They almost do it all by themself.
---
wtf havoc
---
[Artist's DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/sitzkrieg-chan)
---
They were great to work with and very much worth it for the price. Give them some love!
---
dys0n is recruiting
---
Yeah this is more entertaining than playing eve online
---
Why do people think CCP would balance their biggest earned
---
When I found out this wasn't already the case I was actually shocked. I felt like I'd trained for blops by mistake at that point XD
---
Awesome piece.
---
 Ah you re trying to find a proper excuse to say you're quitting eve. Probably would've been better if you just did it on the forums. Wouldn't be so mocked by everyone
---
The reason he thinks you aren't a programmer is because you assumed the only way to achieve the mechanic is to simply press delete on a system... xD just run a patch that renders gates to the nova system inoperable and toss everything in the system onto the killboard. No reason to update the map.
---
Ye I mean it might straight up go to shit or it might actually be good. Asset safety removal is prob one of the dumbest things to remove tho cause thats a great way of getting people to leave. 
---
But honestly, it might all just be hype.
---
DAU and MAU cant differentiate between bots or alts either.
---
Why should I bring a depot and stabs with me that takes up precious cargo? Why should I bring Drones if I use it as cargo ship? /s
---
Maybe edit the post and put it at the top.
---
Ever heard of small gang?
---
Weab cancer but its good.
---
To be Scrupulously Fair, maybe by "MAU" and "DAU" he means sekrit CCP numbers that distinguish sessions by unique users and not raw PCUs, which overcount multiboxers.
---
Not everyone flies in huge fleets with lots of logi.
---
That said however you can't get to the same EHP restores per second from a local repper that shield can without using its rigs and damage mod slots. If armor is going to have to give up its damage mod slots to get strong local tank that tank should at least be strong.
---
Ah good ole using ccp made an update I can blame for for finally quitting.  If you were tired sooner then quit then. Don't wait til an update and cry about it. Either just shush and quit it or expect this sub to think you're a little special.
---
The eve ecosystem has to contribute to me or it can go fuck itself.
---
As long as they will still make profit they won't go away. If you make less profit per bot just add 10 more.
---
You clearly have't been around for Sub Sales that included 3-6mo of time on a NEW account. CCP directly endorses multiboxing. 
---
If you don't like it, you don't have to do it - don't act like a communist and attempt to enforce that everyone do things the way you do.
---
Here's EVE Vegas 2018 having a half hour player presentation (CCP endorsed) explaining how and why people multibox: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFU8s0D2fkw&amp;t=4s
---
Try long term living in a wormhole with only one character as a solo player.
---
Try moving a capital over long distances without a cyno alt.
---
Were you even around for when there wasn't a place to dock titans and supers?
---
Do you even play this game?
---
its a stepping stone for other "premium" items   
---
make "premium skins" normal and people wont complain if you slowly slip in more premium items   
---
boiling the frog and all (or crab rather)
---
&gt; Was this CCPs short sighted intention all along? To make goons and the other big blocks the only safe havens for krabs to krab, and force people to bunker up in the big blocs, anyone who doesn't comply instead chooses to not even log in?
---
CCPs intention was cloud technology FUCKED local, they already signed the contract - Hilmar headed this up. Local bugged and was inaccurate or late for several months - blackout lets victims think CCP keeps them in mind while also serving the purpose of putting local not working complaints to rest.
---
It's cheaper to use cloud technology and you can dismantle all your offices as the servers are outsourced. The goal is to have basically everything in EVE run by cloud - because the game works by 1 second ticks instead of real time - so delays and shitty performance resulting from state of the art cloud technology effects eve less. Games like CSGO have 60 or more server updates a second instead of 1 and requires accurate updates for competition.
---
Eve is not competitive in the least with its server ticks or reaction time. It's not a twitch reaction game and so CLOUD technology saves money. Players have no say in this or any other changes as most of the game switches to relying on the cloud - it saves money at the expense of a little bit worse game - which as we've seen features like blackout can cover it up.
---
No where in here is the idea to hire someone to write for local/cloud to handle this correctly without loss or error. CCP fires people, hiring means less revenue - and for what a better game experience? People will play with or without local - that's hilmars call and he'll make it on combat as soon as they're ready and then combat will be inaccurate/delayed/broken as nobody will be hired to write the code for cloud to handle that and make it seamless. 
---
CCP will continue to push parts of EVE onto cloud technology until the whole game is chaos and we'll lose a lot in the transition. 
---
It's okay though some smallgang goof thinks CCP changed a decade + of game design for them, a great red herring for the disenfranchised.
---
I don't want smarter npcs. I just want more bounty. Oh and no pvp zones would be nice. Always to look out if some ashole comes by to kill your vni is annoying.
---
Honesty ... well done Sir
---
Im fairly Sure ccp calculates them based on different data then we have at Hand
---
So just for example
---
Nullbear #1 log ins his 10 rorqs with the Same IP they Show up as the Same ammount of persons as wormholer#3 who just logs in 2 Accounts from the Same IP so both count as 1 in that stats but for the login count we have the Nullbear is 10 logged in and the whler is 2
---
So if the Nullbear now just logs his main in as a "protest"  our count goes down but Not ccps
---
People will just return to using POS's again.
---
Dont use big words you dont understand mate.
---
I dont see how you are missing that source criticism isnt entitlement, its a way of thinking. Like not being a total moron you know, you should try it.
---
Ye thats the spirit, always believe everyone. Its really not the reason why the world in general is such a shitty place right? Cause there are too many sheeps around that just accept anything.
---
But bro, its alright. If you wanna be a sheep, I sure aint gonna stop u. Just swallow everything people tell you to.
---
I haven't got the shakes since Asset Safety was started. No real visceral feeling of loss
---
They still exist I believe but they don't do anything because POSes can no longer mine moons.
---
That's how spodbrains spell "drifter."
---
Yay! Or you can try playing in highsec where it’s safe.
---

right, moracha is the same as a hel. Yes you drop a moracha on top of a hel when you have no idea what is behind the other cyno. Moracha is CLEALRLY the same as a hel.
---
Exactly. Only times i get tge shakes is if i solo pvp. I hate the shakes. That's why i stopped solo pvp. And roaming around for hours and looking for a fight is so boring thst i can feel how i become older. Watching paint dry is more entertaining than eve online pvp.
---
Just mill asset safety
---
Most other games have the content brought you into forced environments. Eve has a few things like that but much like brs and the history of some battles is that fights can happen anywhere and over the smallest of things. Hell one of the most expensive battles happened over a sov bill not being paid on time. Yes eve has mechanic problems but it's eve and no other game is like it. So if you're whining the. I'm glad to see you leave. Even if playing this game for 10 years there's stuff those people haven't even don like in other MMOs.
---
i read your comments and you are actually a psychopath with brain damage... im glad to see you go

Played since 2007.

Small gang tackles my Abyss Gila in stage system.
---
Adrenalin high.
---
Kicked me like a horse in teeth.
---
FU moment.
---
Engage tackler, yell for help in standing fleet, login alt, get in fleet and warp super to scare them.
---
Alliance mate is helping ( spod bless ).
---
We take out a few, Hel lands, they run.
---
I warp Gila from there.
---
F yeah it was intense. Even though you know you have upper hand and are in minimal danger. 
---
So thank you no local for that.
---
Good times.
---
So, "fuck this, Hilmar must don sackcloth, smear himself with ashes and crawl to the cathedral on his hands and knees through the snow to beg forgiveness before I pay attention to anything he says?"
---
Good luck with that. I advise not holding your breath.
---
Very much hope they focus on FW. I loved and miss my time spent in FW and best way to get new players into non-npc corps and pvp is via FW imo. It's 10x more engaging than anything in high-sec and much easier to wrap your head around than all the different things going on in null. Anyway, I like a lot of what's being said here and I'm feeling optimistic overall.
---
I feel like friendly fire would be neat. By which I mean if a ship crosses paths with the weapon's fire from a friendly ship firing on an enemy ship, it could get hit too.
---
Your stomachs gonna turn when I'm done feeding it frozen burgies
---
WAIT RIFTERS CAN KILL VNIs NOW?!
---
HOW DO I RUN THIS GAME ON A POTATO I'M COMING BACK BOYS
---
I thougt only psychopath play this game. You need a very high level of autism to endure this boring as "game".
---
Wormhole generators is literally a thing you can install in ihubs already
---
Sorry the actual reality of our relationship with goons doesn't match your dearly held preconceptions, but we were in fact heading to the grid with the plan of "shoot everyone but goons" (and presumably Snuff, who invited us.)
---
Abyssal loot already crashed in value.
---
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT UNLESS EVERYONE IS ONLINE AT THE SAME TIME IT DOESN'T COUNT? oh wait no that's op lololol
---
&gt;You guys need to decide what side you are on, that much is for certain.
---
Who are you to tell us what to do?
---
&gt; Carriers and supers are kinda a pain to rat in
---
But you can't multibox subs to rat, so you have to settle for a couple hundred million an hour in that super then getting the same in 4 smartbombing battleships.
---
The battleships get caught by any point and get shredded before cyno has anything to say about it. It's also 4-5 subscriptions versus 1 subscription to operate a super.
---
So, you didn't even really play the game? You played other games or watched videos? Why would you pay so much to not play? Also, who did you think you were going to sell titans to if you never socialized? Hope you find what you are looking for, but your leaving is no loss to Eve.
---
assuming you'ree trolling, that's a good one :-)
---
Not everyone must enjoy PVP. I do enjoy it, but I enjoy more industry, logistics and trading for instance. Eve wouldn't be Eve if it was all PvP.
---
you know its 2019 right
---
If you provide me the extractors i do it
---
&gt;I understand you don't know all of the politics, but V0lta is literally taking ISK from Init coffers
---
He's not the only one who doesn't know all the politics...

Just pve in highsec.
---
You really think that "x players logged in this week compared to last week" is the only thing they look at? You don't think they look at how long people stay logged in, what characters they are using, what they are doing, what they lost, what they gained?
---
Eve is the only game I know to release an economics report. You think its so simple as "well they are giving away SP so the data are bad!"
---
Well i couldn't quit. I was addicted. Ccp cured me. Thanks ccp.

---
Depends on who you ask.. talk to Tuskers and small gang is &lt; 1 pilot.
---
Could you please transfer all your  ISKs to my account?
---
You’re the one quitting. Liquidate, bruh.
---
Because he said:
---
&gt; while also allowing systems to spawn new resources after the nova settles
---
Which to me certainly suggests his idea is that the system itself remains but is regenerated. Supernovas are not exactly known for leaving planets and moons in one piece, and certainly not remaining in orbit.
---
If he had argued for something a bit less... absolute, like a massive CME, I would not have assumed that absolutely everything in the system would be wiped.
---
Hmm typhoon sounds interesting
---
Shit, if you could just hide behind an asteroid or station when somebody was trying to shoot you...
---
yeah its boring when you are close minded and think about this game at the surface.... in this game other than pvp,pve you make friends, create bonds and chat with people and try to work as a team, accomplish stuff
---
I'm here to ruin your game but if my game gets ruined I'm packing up my toys and going home
---
Your a retard aren’t you...
---
Your quitting do what does it matter
---
So many nano vaga fleets, omg
---
more bad ideas here:  
---
\- No caps in anoms.  
---
\- any capital jump gains fatigue.  
---
\- Jump gates cause fatigue.
---
I don't know what guff your FCs have been feeding you but there were not "310 T3Cs". The whole INIT fleet including logi, support and tackle was \~half that size. The ferox numbers Panfam and Legacy brought would very likely have taken loads of casualties, but they'd also do much more ISK damage than sustained.
---
Cosmetic engine trails
---
I agree. I had no issue staying logged in doing absolutely nothing worth while, but now with these SP events I am starting to hate it very much to the point where I will log off and do something literally anything else and feel like I am doing something better than grinding out dailies. Even if it is to kill just one single rat for 25k skill points, I just feel this huge aversion to do even just that. Funny enough, if these dailies were not a thing I would have zero problem going to a site for shits and gigs to run it.  With these events, I think about doing it, then realize I HAVE to kill at least X amount of rats for the sp, that urge to go kill rats for shits and gigs goes away and is replaced by revulsion.
---
wouldn't mind cosmetic cloak effects myself
---
not like anyone else would see it, but would be neat to see my ship look different while cloaked
---
But after 300 kills we can expect at least the worst of the combat shakes to be a thing of the past.
---
Yes, but bots (and krab alts to some extent) log in for solid 8 hour+ sessions daily, sitting in the PCU number for a much longer time than real pvp people who log in for a few hours whenever they feel like it.
---
Probably by tackling it as a Factorio style thing.  
---
That can probably be fun.
---
Feel like there'll just be another "magic x" that will take their place, that we'll ask to also be baseline in a year or so.
---
Ah sorry i meant drifters not rifters. Ah fuck it who gives a fuck
---
Yeah and I was addicted to, fuck I'm still addicted to. You just went about the addiction wrong with wanting to multi box roquals and ratting vnis. Maybe you should've done new things but instead you stuck to that one thing and that's what you should be mad at. Not ccp
---
I don't have a problem with krabs, but if they want that level of safety ... HiSec is --&gt; way
---
I want less sand. I want no pvp zones so i don't have to rely on a stupid umbrella
---
I upvoted anime. Time to vomit, possibly neck myself
---
   
---
If you want more risk, then make the PVP players risk too. 50 frigates worth 10 million each is not a risk. Make that 50 frigates could not kill the ship above the class.
---
I'm one pilot. But 13 characters in fleet...
---
Lmao just store your important shit in lowsec if losing assets is that bad to you
---
Not a bad idea imo. I always thought the cloak effect was really cool and I spend a lot of time admiring it- I honestly would think cosmetic cloaks to be pretty cool.
---
you can't even imagine, veins on my forehead bulging, steam coming out of my ears and so on...
---
right, you don't really need more sp at 80m. Sure, its good, but 99% of eve players won't notice the difference as long as they're flying in 100+ fleets
---
so... no pilots?
---
just borrow your mom's credit card :-)
---
He’s not actually quitting. That’s the issue.
---
Let me paint my ship like a rainbow so my Eve persona can finally be as gay as my irl persona.
---
&gt; they reward highly specialized alts
---
Why is this a problem?
---
&gt; had for very low raw SP count
---
but than you're talking very few injectors if it was LOW RAW SP anyhow ... and this fixes what problem? Give specific examples of exactly training for which low SP super specialized alt.
---
&gt; hese alts basically can't be used until they have their capital skills ready
---
Those low SP capital alts? capitals are several months of training to get jump skills to V ( which is pretty mandatory) and then you skill their weapons system, (multiple months of training).
---
&gt; have their capital skills ready due to the lack of investment in other skills
---
A shitty, low ehp capital? That's good for eve
---
&gt; so only people who have relatively lots of resources already can afford them
---
Your ideas don't change the fact that only the wealthy will have injectors... it's nearly a billion isk per 6 days of training right now lossless, a billion isk for 3 days if you're a pilot with mid-tier sp. Are you saying injector prices would drop? Why wouldn't people just stop extracting if injectors suck?
---
It seems short-sighted and under thought from my perspective.
---
Or a blessing?
---
damn I mean that's cool but I don't know if I'd admit it tbh
---
POI POI
---
I don't fault you for assuming new resources (beyond anomalies and belt contents) would be spawned, I fault you for assuming ccp would be stupid enough to break their game doing it. Of course they would need to run a patch and downtime and avoid cascading errors. They would have plenty of time while the system is UNOCCUPIED.
---
For the games sake I hope too. But this is a direction thing, driven by a warped rationale to attract new players, whilst ignoring and forcing out the old loyal players. It will spell an inevitable death once the short-term fun is had by those who can't see very far and don't care.
---
and don't forget when you actually find something it's usually either a bot and there is no enjoyment, hooray you killed a lifeless script operating a cheap ass fit ship.... 
---
or a massive fleet ready to destroy you as soon as you take gate/land on grid....
---
Stats can be swung anyway you want it but once your free shit runs out numbers are going to sink faster than the Titanic. Oh, and are you just looking at the log in numbers? Or time people are staying in the game? Because those are two hugely different statistics. I know I've logged in for my SP and then immediately logged out. After reading this dialog of fucking morons running eve. I might be out for good. I literally just came back to the game a few months ago was starting to have fun until they pulled the blackout bullshit.
---
that would be hilarious !!!
---
*2 minutes to self-destruct*
---
Well i'm sorry but i just don't like people. Why i played eve since 2014 i can't explain. I took several long breaks before. This time i played a little over a year without a break. That's the longest time without a break i playes this "game". It took me 3 atempts to stay in the game. My first try was in 2011. Only an hour or so. My second try was at the start of 2014. A couple of days. At the end of 2014 i subbed and stayed. But why i can't say. I hate this "game" so much.
---
with at 7 isk, i guess it is
---
I appreciate your perspective. Here: [yeasty](https://i.imgur.com/JQr4qHN.)
---
Exploration.
---
1: You can make a fortune. Like billions weekly. 
---
2: You learn a LOT about the game. 
---
3: it’s VERY risk vs reward.
---
4: You will die and lose a lot. This is a good thing. It will be exciting and you will learn from every loss.
---
Nah i'm to lazy. And i worked enough in this "game".
---
you dont have to like people but just be an open minded person... also if you really dont like people go play single player games or something
---
it's awesome when people ask what they should do in a EvE sandbox and the first answer is "don't mine" followed by "don't mission run", what an exciting game...
---
Merlins seem to be less and less useful as the years go by, but nevertheless it must be a Merlin. Not that I wouldn't enjoy killing one in a Rifter of Breacher, but it just wouldn't be the same.
---
Cool anime girl but I can't spot the Aeon?
---
It'd certainly turn asteroid belts into interesting battlegrounds, yeah. But I was more thinking about forcing blobs to disperse
---
Well i only have like 10b liquid isk. Sorry but i'm too lazy to login and give it to you. It's too much work.
---
I've been doing a few fleets a week but that's been about the extent of it.  And high seconds in an option due to where all the characters are located
---
Which will be removed from the game Soon™
---
I'm sorry, did I say they would break their game? Because I'm fairly sure I said:
---
"It would require massive changes to the client, the api, the database"
---
It would require massive changes explicitly to avoid it instantly fcuking up everything which touched it.
---
Elegant solution.
---
There is a strictly Explo Corp in eve with absolutely no PVP ... idk if your interested in that but they are a good group of guys and they can probably give you a good skill plan
---
The difference is that the injector made in game, the sp had to come from a paying account, required time, etc.
---
The SP from these events is just generated from thin air.
---
There are reasons why asset safety is a thing. It wont affect me personally but making the game more tedious isnt the way forward. Thats a big concern regarding all the changes that are being talked about. The expectation is that people should be forced to play a more boring game than the rest simply because of their choice to live in a certain security class.
---
Perhaps makes theoretical sense but in reality, people are just gonna quit.
---
some people never really take the time to think about or try to understand it, so they just think "whoever brings the right ship just instantly kills me and theres nothing I can ever do!"
---
Sounds like I struck a nerve. 
---
Aren't you missing InfoWars or Faux News?
---
Unless you need a pvp skill plan
---
You really have no idea about logistics and continuity do you. Lol
---
I only build caps if some npc orders one. But i do very little advertisement on it. It's too much work. I'm glad caps almost build themself. You just have to start the build and wait. Like skills.
---
Lol dude, you wouldnt find a nerve even if it was in front of you.
---
Yeah exactly that’s only an option if you do not want any PvP enhancement at All
---
Weird. Sounds like exactly what I suggested! We have achieved communication. [explicit](https://i.imgur.com/JQr4qHN.)
---
Just find the ship that you want to fly in the ship tree, then train the skills needed to fly it and then the mastery skills after that. For exploration the ships would be the t1 and t2 exploration frigates, so magnate/anathema in the case of Amarr. There is also the astero as a faction frigate.
---
Upvoted
---
Well test is paying for it, by buying faction titans from me :))
---
Highsec is not safe
---
perhaps you goons can all just move on and ruin a different game now?  
---
Oh, almost forgot ... grrr goons.  
---
\[yes, this is a joke post\]
---
Wormholes are safer than nullsec. You can go there.
---
It is true.  You apparently know little enough about how SP are generated to be making a statement. 
---
Because with skill injectors, I get a diminished return that is bad enough that I use injectors rarely. They're not worth the same as an accelerator.
---
If they gave out age or sp limited accelerators, then it helps the newbro catch up.  As it is now, It actually helps the older characters more than the newbro.
---
The Magic 14 are essentially required to do 'stuff' in this game. Nearly all fits require T2 armor or shield stuff at the least and it is INSANE how big a difference they provide for power/CPU and shit. 
---
I honestly think they should be changed in some way, or have their total SP costs reduced dramatically. As is, to get all Magic 14 to level 5 takes over 3 months. For skills that people will basically say are required or you're not gonna have fun, that's insane to ask of a new player.
---
That's the plan. I have a lot of games still to play and they are all infinitly more fun than eve online
---
Casual
---
no game is dead because daily log-ins the opposite is the industry standard. Daily log-ins keep games afloat - that's why they're industry standard.
---
&gt; I've already heard from friends who have had to leave that they felt it was complete bullshit to get back after Christmas, only to find out that they'd basically missed the SP to get JDC5
---
That's oddly specific, how many friends did that happen to. I missed xmas sp because I wasn't paying attention to Eve. Didn't make me quit the game because my skills are where they were if that didn't exist. (also lol at jump skills being the skill)
---
This is the dumbest reasoning to quit and the dumbest supportive reasoning for in-game events not-existing. To the extent where it seems like a psyop - making a shitty, easily trumped argument for removal of daily log-ins to prove why they're bad - which would take away the stage light from real concerns of why daily log-ins might be a problem.
---
Every gate will get several warptozero bookmarks
---
But you weren't playing anyway. So nothing changed.
---
Make the conbat inty not appear on local ;D (when local will be back in space) combat inty are shit now
---
Yummy loot, even if its t2 mods i still love loot!
---
&gt; (when local will be back in space)
---
CCP said the results from blackout were fantastic, so hopefully local will never be back
---
That's still more targets.
---
Which is good.
---
+1
---
I don't think losing equipment you aren't using would really be visceral
---
Exactly. You understand what i mean with pvp in this game is boring as shit.
---
Nope, it's easy enough as it is ... and you want to take out more thinking or learning from friends/corpmates.    
---
I'll be you love skill injectors too
---
Obviously, but hitting MJD -before- you cloak will give you ~6 sec of cloak time before you get decloaked again.
---
Make sleeper data loot required for some ship construction.
---
I mean if you're gonna bot, you're also gonna use the virtual machine/ISBoxer settings for a renderless client that uses next to zero CPU resources
---
Just like you. My evidence: you post in r/eve.
---
I like this idea. It could drastically change how nullsec works, but could be a cool thing. It'd open up somewhat save havens all across. And maybe make it so that it is relatively heavily patrolled by the faction, so that their constellation might be a kind of 20/10 complex spread over many systems, make them not attack players they have good standings with and allow them to dock and be defended by the NPCs. Sounds like fun. Maybe don't add it to every Nullsec Region, but at least a few of them. Or add more NPC space to the outer edges of New Eden for some of the factions (ORE might be cool :p).
---
Maybe use with coefficient difficulty learning.
---
Remov the penalty levels of 5/50/80 million sp and just divide the number of entered sp into the coefficient of study complexity desired skill.
---
It would be good to disable the branches of the skills if the root skill is not studied.
---
Make them disallow cynos
---
&gt; It actually helps the older characters more than the newbro.
---
No, it still doesn't.
---
SP is less valuable to an older higher SP character.
---
Just because it's more even distribution than injectors doesn't mean that its better for veterans than new players.
---
A new player can get multiple skills done that directly expand their abilities with 1m sp.
---
A veteran can barely get any skills done, and certainly none that meaningfully expand the characters abilities.
---
I don't want to ruin anyones game. I just want to make a lot of isk and build very big ships. Is that to much to ask?
---
Daily rewards are the industry standard because of the mechanic of "I didn't log in for a week, now my friends are all in area X which I can't get to because I'm behind on SP and cant fit weapon/tank mod Y".   So then, to keep playing with friends they have two options, pull out the wallet, or convince friends to play some other game.
---
Play BDO for a while with RL friends, then just... take a break for a week, and then you'll see what I mean.
---
If the in-game rewards were not SP, but some form of loot, or cosmetics or something, anything but SP, then I'd be OK with it.
---
They promised us years ago that they'd never ever generate SP from thin air.  Then they do it anyways once they sold out.
---
Please, MOAR TEARS! I need more lube
---
Just pay the subscription. The grind to make enough isk for plex will drive you crazy. It made me crazy.
---
Suitcases.
---
Again as many have pointed out, this is an individual who has no real intention of quitting. He is upset that  mean CCP took away his safety blankets. His hope is that people would follow his rally cry and line up behind him so CCP would have to reverse the changes they made. BRING LOCAL BACK. Give me my bot friendly VNI. 
---
However what he’s finding is ridicule because the vast majority of EVE players are enjoying the changes. It’s ok, man. I agree that if you don’t like something you should vote with your wallet, I do it all the time. But I don’t stomp my feet and cry like a 3 year old who’s parents won’t buy them a toy at Toys R Us. 
---
Good luck to you, sir. I’m sure we’ll see you back in a couple months.
---
I don't mind risk I'm just not sure how I'm going counter stealth loki ganks to build up some bank. Ganks are fine but stealth seems to be too safe now
---
I dunno, when I'm links or logi and shit is going down it does something with me because me not being bad affects a lot of peoples evening.
---
This whole thing was in lowsec btw, haven't managed to sneak a fleet of carriers into highsec yet.
---
Give your shit to me and ill distribute it to our newbees if you really are out...
---
So you're trying to solve some problems that aren't really problems. And to do it would add more complexity to the skill system, an area we all seem to agree is difficult to communicate to new players. 
---
So what's the problem being solved?
---
Focused Alts: Have been a key component of eve since multiboxing was technically feasible, in addition they increase revenue by increasing subscription/plexing.  
---
New players training badly: They get a ton of Free SP to start with already... they can extract and reinject if it's just silly.  
---
Older players get little return from injectors: This is by design, it's literally a feature, not an issue.  
---
Making the Magic 14 go the way of learning skills would eliminate a lot of the arguments here and get new players to a comparative level with way less development effort, plus it leaves more SP under the 5m cap for them to use in ways that are actually about play style instead of prereq.
---
Personally I'd have no issue with scrapping the existing SP penalties and moving over to a skill-specific multiplier. I am a lot less concerned with someone injecting themselves up to Caldari Cruiser V than I am them injecting into Industrial Command Ships V or Carrier V.
---
Obviously there's the existing rank system built into the skills themselves which determines how many SP it takes to train, however, I think for the nature of injectors, it makes sense to have an alternate lever that can be pulled to adjust them, rather than just depending on the existing multiplier.
---
Youve gotten great advice above. Would just like to add that you can do most if not all things as an alpha, you will just be doing it worse than if you were an omega. So try it if you are interested in the game and if you like it and want to advance you always have that option.
---
When bots get nerfed it eases the effect on the economy which is reason enough to keep hurting them.
---
Very few hunters have the player skill or the SP invested in scanning to do this.  As someone who both runs sites and hunts others who do I am telling you this change would make it vastly easier to catch escalation runners or steal the site.  The only counterplay would be to destroy every wreck as you go.
---
I will say it again.  The 1-shot scan is largely a myth, I have run thousands of sites in lowsec and probably encountered this once or twice.  Making wrecks scannable would DRASTICALLY reduce the skill threshold for hunting escalation runners.
---
&gt; capitals are several months of training to get jump skills to V
---
The whole point is that you don't if you inject. You can start jump skills well before 10m SP, which is the "lossless" zone for injectors. JDC 5 can be with the same efficiency as say, Capacitor Operations 5.
---
checkmate daddy
---
SP generated by SP farms are generated from thin air over time, only difference is that on SP “gifted” by ccp you cannot make a profit ingame as a player.
---
Who said anything about logi? You can get comparable local reps from 2 and resists vs 3 cap-hungry local reps with mandatory worse resists.  
---
Pure rep power is often practically limited by your buffer anyway, you see on CS/BSs tanking 5k dps, HACs tanking 2K dps. Then you compare it to not-local-tank bonused ships like a Navy Mega having tons of raw HP, and the resist choice gives far more volley-surviving and bait tanking potential. Useful when you're under neut pressure or not much pressure.
---
Na we should just give up on it and surrender Eve to the bots because whatever we do there still might be some /s
---
The thing about optional activities is that they are optional
---
Pve my old Corp used armor buffer vnis and Nestor logi, though with the drop in vni damage from the nerf it might be better to use something else.
---
STOP SIGNING YOUR POSTS
---
Biggest is not always best. Many ships can preform many roles. Look at the bonus' a ship has from role and ship level + slot layout to determine how/what you want to do with it. 
---
Best advice I can give is since you're new and still learning, broaden your available options by training to unlock as much as you can. That means small guns to 3, then medium guns to 3, frigs to 3, destroyers to 3, and just keep going till you find the way you wanna focus on.
---
Lmao yes gotta check off the T1 frag list one by one
---
this is not a problem, and certainly not an argument against the change
---
Basically the OPs intentions are legit.  Its disingenuous to make hundreds of thousands of SP free and than in the same breath say look at how well eve is doing when I forced this situation and it is a horrible indicator of overall game health.
---
The only difference is CCP can purposely change the data to their whim with events and the OP is stuck to just doing dumb stuff to obfuscate data.
---
The story Falcon and his associates tell is a lie from start to finish. Everybody has the possibility to see the online numbers. Who is so stupid and still believes has not earned it differently!
---
&gt; that hel was in no risk whatsoever
---
you're retarded
---
Does BDO have an equivalent of the cancer that is eve reddit?
---
hard to replace ships without income
---
Is it possible to do something similar in Java?
---
Did I say anything about fisting though ?
---
OK, so lets go ahead and break down your entire statement:
---
&gt;  I hated the EvE skill-gain thing at first, until I left for a while (deployed), had a friend keep my queue up, and came back and had a few skills with long wait-times taken care of. 
---
That's admitted account sharing right there. They permaban accounts for that. 
---
&gt; I've already heard from friends who have had to leave that they felt it was complete bullshit to get back after Christmas, only to find out that they'd basically missed the SP to get JDC5. 
---
So they missed login rewards because they didn't log in? I'm not sure how that's a problem. You don't get your loyalty points at stores when you don't shop there. 
---
&gt; That is what Black desert style crap will kill EvE. 
---
BDO has grossed more than $1 bil in revenue and is still one of the top 50 games streamed on Twitch. Their streams pull in thousands of people while Eve pulls in hundreds.  I'm not sure how you're saying BDO is dead. 
---
&gt; Us older characters with &gt;80m SP benefit more from these free SP than newbros get. 
---
Calling bullshit on that. SP means way more to new players than it does to older players. Thousands of SP for a new player is the difference between being able to pilot a particular ship or use a certain module. 
---
The argument that gets thrown around a lot is that because injectors cost X amount of ISK and vet players only get a fraction of the SP that makes the SP worth more per unit to bittervets, which is true. That's a flawed analysis and off point though. You're comparing the monetary value of SP for 2 different player groups rather than the actual impact of the SP for character development. 
---
50k SP would take off almost a days worth of training for a bittervet training a 42 day skill, while the same amount of SP could train up several lower level skills for a newbro and allow them to get in to a ship or equip modules they wouldn't have access to otherwise. That's the whole point of the skill bonuses. Newbros that actively play can skill in to the ships and modules they need faster.
---
I can do it in an unbonused ship on an alpha. You know why? Because you can carefully dscan your target down enough to get his position within 0.25 AU while cloaked.
---
Because they are ***BY FAR*** the least exciting parts of the game. But people get stuck on them because they are the first progression system they encounter. Then they burn themselves out grinding smoothing with no meaning waiting for the exciting stuff to happen.
---
Tbh the upcoming age is great for industrialists.
---
?
---
This is not a natural evolution. This is a force march into Chaos. If you are not a "chaos" player, then CCP no longer wants you. Doom and gloom are upon you.
---
There are no new and exciting games coming out that can replace EVE. There is no EVE replacement.
---
Your comfortable home that you spent years building is no longer yours. Nothing you build in null will ever be yours again. 
---
I am afraid this is worse than you could ever have imagined. You may have to go outside and take up gardening or stay inside and take up scrap booking. Or even worse, become one of those people who plays mind-numbingly simple games on their phone.
---
Anime was a mistake
---
You have check my post history ? Nice so nie. So you have read all my exchange with falcon, and the one he saif if we have idea to improve MER to post it ?Apparently not. 
---
Stop seach salt. It's all aout simplification of data survey. Actually you need to use more than 1 source to have all information, i just ask CCP if they can merge.
---
Bye 👋 
---
Self destruct and trash yo stuff, it’s probably cursed anyway
---
TL:DR Yes it's possible to get to omega just by earning ISK and buying Plex with those, however you can't get there without obnoxious grinding. Staying omega is the key, however grinding time will reduce the more advance you are in the game depending on luck, your income method, your skills and your equipment. Shortcuts are less common except stealing assets and ISK or scamming.
---
As Clay\_Pigeon said play as alpha, decide whether you wanna stick around in eve. If you do there is always a way to get to omega grinding efficiently.
---
Haters gonna hate, eve shakes gonna shake
---
Agreed, and those people are the silent vast majority of players that does not consider themself elite players, they don't give a shit about reddit or the forum, they only like playing Eve and they are the guys that provides a constant flow of money to the game via subscriptions.
---
The fact that CCP could not see (or don't wanna see) this is one of the biggest problems.
---
You haven't read the post. Congrats.
---
Read again , and read the first line.  I just ask CCP to make all data easier to access for everyonne, beacause we have all data already ... You know they are with mer, on dotlan, on some other tier site ...  
---
And if you want to know Falcon himself have ask on a post to us bring idea to data sharing, so you search salt and bad intetion in a post just to ask a cool merge on data to CCP to avoid to collect MER on 30 devblog page, after go to other source of truth to have all.  Just the merge in one link of all MER raw data will be great. 
---
And as i said : we already have information so ... it's not to proof X or Y. It 's beacause some people know i play with game data and ask me where i found they ... an start to be boring to link near 50 link actually ...
---
Wow, who woulda guessed people would adapt
---
Bye o7
---
Do you have any skills to V?  Especially ones that take a long time to train?  They provide a LOT of benefit.
---
Take for instance, Dreadnaught skill:
---
My Rev at AD IV: 46862
---
Same at AD V:  48815
---
That is a 5% difference, which doesn't seem like much until you consider that is a 2k/shot difference in damage. And it's a skill that a vet would be training, generally speaking.
---
Or JDC5. That is a complete game changer for caps. 
---
Shorter skill trains that a newbro would train, say for instance AWU5, might get that extra PG for another gun or tank mod, which is a good boost, but not in the 2K EHP range, and it's not the game-changing mechanic like having JDC5.
---
Or you could bother to check the difference between t1 and t2 fighters.
---
That is \*why the longer vet skills take so long\*, they do make a massive difference.
---
Praxis vs omni damage. 
---
With a Faction X-large shield booster, 2 boost amps and 2 invulns tanks 749.6 EHP/s for 90.4GJ/s. Using none of its low slots. 
---
With Faction large armor reppers that are each twice as expensive as the shield booster and 4 enams tanks 582.8 EHP/s for 80GJ/s. This uses all by 1 of its low slots.
---
I guess you can do your own backup system, copy/restore .dat files. Or just scripting part. Why though? Version control works just fine
---
As others have already pointed out in this thread: You’re a bit dense.
---
Nice. You get less than half the yield with T2 Mining drones as opposed to Excavators. 
---
I would still bomb their shit
---
Adapt and survive!

Rewards based on undocking and interacting with stuff are much better than rewards on login screen.

Many themepark best practices are really bad for Eve. Dailies are not one of them. In themeparks it often amounts to pushing necessary unwanted daily grind to people. In Eve it contributes to the vibrancy of the universe. Dailies become not about the experience of the single user, but one persons undocking contributes to the positive experience of the another person.
---
Dailies are pretty good for Eve.

The first two links are good beginner exploration guides.

You're not really gaining anything out of it by doing so, but I guess whatever you find fun you go do it!
---
Imagine not having solo'ed a t3c in a t1 frigate lol might as well biomass
---
Sigh.. the advice to not mine is wrong.  13 years ago, i joined eve and mining is what made me love the game.  
---
Do what you enjoy doing.  If your focus is just making isk, you will have a bad time.  
---
Find an activity you like and the isk will come as you want to do it better, more, and efficantly.
---
If you like mining do it.  Kernite was good when i was noob.
---
If your mining for isk... dont do that, it will bore you to death eventually.
---
I feel dumber after reading this.
---
You can also fit 220 Mining Drone IIs into the space of 1 Excavator. You would run out of bombs before they run out of Drones.

Can you find officer rats outside of NPC space ?

Combat Tractor Beam! 
---
What I’ve wanted ever since I started playing, saw tractor beam, and tried to pull somebody towards me :)
---
Hi doxzer, 
---
PVE exploration is pretty fun, that's my favorite way to make money. I'm assuming you are talking about using core scanner probes to find Relic and Data sites, then playing the hacking minigame to unlock the "cans".
---
You'll start with the T1 (Tier 1, as opposed to Tier 2 or 3) exploration frigates, the Probe, Heron, Magnate, or Imicus. Which you choose depends partly on your starting race (Amarr, Gallente, Caldari, or Minmatar), but is really up to you once you buy whichever racial frigate skill book. 
---
After those, the upgrade is to T2 Covert Ops frigates, which require you to get that racial frigate skill to 5, then learn the covert ops skill. (which applies to all races of covert ops ships) Since three ships can use a covert ops cloaking device, I suggest you train the cloaking skill. That lets you hide from people who might will to shoot you.
---
I'm more into PvE but I dont feel too prepared yet. I need some good weapons e.g. lasers and missiles and shielding.
---
This is complete bullshit. There are people who have been playing this game for a long time. And when you play for a long time you always try one or the other. But at some point you have your own playing style. Everyone can decide for himself what is fun and for what he is willing to spend money. His decision is very good to follow. I know dozens of people who did the same. People don't want to be taken for a ride anymore.
---
Even tho what you are saying is true there is another aspect to it. It would seem rather strange that daily active users would be higher even tho the PCU is a lot lower. Especially in comparion to a preRorq era without as much multiboxing and some would argue bots and the lack of skillfarms.
---
Simply put, there should have been more unique players (ratio wise) before with a higher PCU. So there being higher unique activity (in an era with a lower ratio) now in a time where PCU is lower seems strange.
---
A man of culture I see
---
Ugh what game should we ruin next? People have been asking for us to leave Eve for a while... hasn’t quite happened yet.
---
I know! The shame has made me quit EVE half a dozen times, yet here I am again, giving it another go. I think I need an intervention.
---
Eh.. no, just do lvl 1 combat missions, they are stupid easy.  Then just move up, eventually you will want to do bigger stuff like incursions. But if u like pve, then id stay away from mining.
---
&gt;I still get the EVE shakes
---
This guy EVEs.
---
For point 1 - No, legally my wife had PoA when i was deployed. Legally she was me.
---
Point 2, this isn't a  corner shop -- no-one is paying anything here. Apples to oranges.
---
For point 3 there is a problem you're not quite getting. They lost something like 85% of their player base. The 15% remaining are the ones that area  bit special upstairs and are willing to pay for that crap.  Also the twitch thing... ugh. People with real jobs don't get to play games all day.  You know, like the people who manage the networks so that twitch can still even run.  But back to the number of people that will leave the game if it becomes another stupid game that you leave your PC on all night to AFK fish just to keep your SP coming in... wouldn't matter to games built differently from EvE. If you think space is empty now, just wait till there are 85% less people.  Sure, EvE would still make the same amount of money (if the 15% remaining didn't mind having empty as fuck game), but... it would no longer be EvE.  
---
For point 4, I'm guessing you don't have many skills in the 3 month-train range.  While the SP does help newbro get to that fitting skill, you can already train the vast majority of that already with the newbro package.
---
And if you put that in scale, that SP in injectors would apply to the newbro as it should, 100%. For me or others that have been in the game for long, that same SP it worth 40% of the same that is 100% for the newbro.
---
The free SP is therefor worth a lot more for an older player.
---
long overdue, agreed
---
Lol
---
Come to wormhole space. Pilot an 8 bil solo fax for a 60 bil + armor gang. You get mad shakes.
---
In a few months the crys that goons still mining too much and boohoo umbrellas...
---
.blackout didnt go far enough. Then observatories hit and its gonna be EVE is dead and dying...i am unsubbing. Just wait, gonna be great.
---
Do they ever include weapon rewards?
---
No. Not unless you're about to give everything short of ship and module skills to players.
---
What's advanced weapons upgrades but a fancy version of cpu management? Rigging skills but fancy versions of the magic 14? Jump clone skills are basically essential to 4, so the same as "can I hold off taking these to 5 or not?" Trade skills literally just stop you from being robbed by NPCs.
---
If skills "mandatory" to fly any fit are required, then so are all PI skills, all scanning and hacking skills, basically all skills. After all, without all of them, there's some things you can do fully well and that vets have a leg up on you in and that you're only training because they're required in order to do ______.
---
CCP : We're gonna do that   
---
Everyone : AHAH GOONS WILL DIE THIS TIME !  
---
Goons : \*are not impacted\*  
---
Everyone : \*Surprised pikachu\*
---
That is the Thing i wanna point you to aswell
---
With the Lack of plex sales skillfarms below a certain Level became a negative buissness so they are on hiatus mostly
---
And rorq alts are mostly parked and going to unsub because many miners can Not Wrap their head around how to make it safe again outside of Delve Eso or KE so that is a Solid bunch that went down and i can even Monitor this on my own Corp.
---
Around this time a month we should sit at about 15b in taxes to collect and we are actually at 8b so we have almost 50% loss on that side.
---
Same goes for ratting taxes they are - 40% but still we have people logged in.
---
They are just doing different Things 9r figured out how to make it as safe as possible and continue what they are doing
---
bring back walking in stations.
---
They should find something other than SP to do this with though.
---
Frankly I think they should stop giving out all this crap and just go back to Sub to play and be done with it.
---
The dailies will push out a lot fo the people that play eve because it \*doesn't\* have that kind of crap in it.
---
yes the goon coffers will run dry if you cripple their T2 mining operations lol
---
4.1% difference, not 5%
---
The events offering the opportunity to inject penalty free suggest they want to tap the high sp market for injector $
---
Is lack of isk ur issue? But they drop stuff u van dump n get new weapons, in a day youd have a few mill which is easy to get new stuff.
---
Overall - dont bother its pointless. Game is not really worth playing unless youre omega. 
---
It is possible to play the game without paying for subscription, HOWEVER you need to grind your way to get to that point - as in waste a lot of your life to make isk to buy omega, to train, to be able to make isk more efficiently (so that you dont waste as much of your life), so that you can keep buying plex. 
---
With plex going up in price, i dont find it worth the effort anymore.
---
I can't believe I just wasted 5 minutes of my life clicking that link, clicking the first killmail and then trying to figure out which characters were different in those capsuleer names. What the fuck is wrong with me...
---
 Stay strong! Do it now! Prove to everyone that you are leaving. I'll confirm it.
---
Lol, maybe you should inform yourself so that you are not so ignorant then?
---
Are you smoking something that you should share with the class?
---
The free sp is hugely welcomed by sp farmers. While I detest it, its ISK for buying ships to blow up, want to buy an injector?  I spent 5 minutes killing 1 rat, switched to another character on the same account, did the same thing, repeated by number of accounts.... yeah I love this change for SP farming.  however I still don't think it's good for the game.
---
Optimal salinity.
---
Who are you to ask?
---
why does everyone keep bringing up observatories i have no idea, those structures are in sisi since 2016-2017 and there were also pos mods since 2011 era that would potentially decloak cloaked people in system.
---
I know what the plan was. I also know that doing so flew straight into the face of signed treaties that your leadership signed off on.
---
Yerp, fat-fingered 5. Corrected :D
---
For high sec
---
- option to sort local and put wartargets/flashies at top of list (should be default) Newish players in trade hubs need to not be farmed so hard by war decs and at least be made aware of the danger. 
---
For null sec
---
-reduce anom spawns drastically, have sov upgrades increase site spawns in the constellation (can't bot/afk farm sites like anoms) 
---
For low sec
---
increase mordus special agent spawns, increase clone soldier spawns, lower the sec status in many low sec systems (all of these should be easy for ccp to implement). There are a lot of pockets with no .2 or .1 systems, would be a big help to the small fledgling groups living in these places. 
---
- Add a skill that buffs lp and isk payouts for non-FW low sec missions 
---
-nerf FOBs in low sec, they aren't something many small low sec groups have the means to deal with. They can be oppressive. 
---
-All of these things will give people more reasons to be out in belts or at missions in low sec, in battle cruisers and battleships, makes for great content!
---
Bye can I have your stuff please?
---
If goons are using t2 drones, everyone else is too... Guess what? Goons will still mine 10x more than anybody else...
---
Nothing changed... Moving on
---
can you link me a post saying goond will die?
---
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!
---
I get that but they still affect the monthly aspect since the blackout started 12th (I think). And also, the login events did get people to log on. They didnt play but they did log on. And certainly also the skillfarmers cause free SP. 
---
That event tainted pretty much every activity metric regarding this event. But Im still having trouble accepting that half the PCU would result in higher activity, especially in a time with more bots, skillfarms and multiboxers. Even if you exklude all those groups, still, half the PCU with higher activity. That feels strange.
---
Again, you don't understand the politics, I get that. Just wish your leadership understood them, but they don't.
---
Sell your shit to buy them or just contract all your stuff to some newbie and biomass
---
https://youtu.be/X1yo7cY4G9U
---
Must be using a poor fit fax then
---
Yeah that's not how life works.
---
Well that's just overlooking the fact I can bridge a blockade runner in with a cargo hold full of bombs. 
---
The benefit of bombs is that I can take out everyone's mining drones on field with 2 bombs. That's about 1.6 mil ISK investment to pop 6 mil ISK per flight of drones. So the more Rorqs bunched up, the better. 
---
It's more economical than losing excavators, but still they're still losing time mining and ISK for drones. It still accomplishes the goal of crippling their ability to make ISK and mine for resources. Rome wasn't laid to waste in a day.
---
I like your ambition
---
I know it feels strange and i dont wanna say CCP is always saying the truth. All i wanna say is that the metric OP presented May be as flawed as He accuses CCPs to be since we
---
A) dont know what they count and
---
B) we dont know from what metric they count it
---
CCPls: Just give him a unique BPO for a Megathron with whatever bonuses baltec1 asks for.
---
Just take your game out behind the shed already.
---
It’s still in the dumpster
---
Sure it s fantastic when we see the number of pkayer ig...
---
What he's suggesting wouldn't penalize an industry veteran with a boatload of manufacture and research and PI and trade SP from getting into FW frigate PvP for fun though.
---
Currently it's easy to be max diminishing returns on injectors but still not have half the subcap skills trained, even though you've only ever trained subcap skills. Then when you join a new group or the meta changes, you're months  from fitting in.
---
Whether this would help ccp sell more extractors and subs or fewer... I'm not sure.
---
I have :) The only pvp I do, and it comes with shakes!
---
You must've been out of the game for a long time if you call supercarriers motherships :P. But yeah, having an anti-cap subcap with really nerfing capital application to sub-cap is probably a change that the game needs.
---
Wow bro, you totally sound like Sun Tzu or some crazy war god. You should definitely write that down and sell it as bumper stickers! God, I really hope you're involved with your alliances military strategic operations - they'd be so frikin' dumb not to have you.
---
Shit, this is how HUN gave TEST such an annoyingly hard time in Fountain. Would definitely love to see this take place.
---
Nice try, come back with you finish building it.
---
&gt;insert clip of daddy mittens on The Meta Show saying "THEY HATE US AND THINK WE WILL DIE!", or something
---
You're only comparing value versus buying injectors. Look at it objectively from a new player. New players are likely not buying injectors anyway, so because they have way less SP than you, it's more valuable to them because they can get in new ships and make new major fit changes.
---
Yes, you get less SP from injectors so if you both bought injectors you'd be right. For a newbro not buying injectors, it's way more valuable to them.
---
A rorqual holds 200+ t2 mining drones, you'll run out of bombs before they run out of drones.
---
how are you gonna compete to recruit the low-tier applicants that flock to snigg and ~omega~ ?
---
In what way?
---
Barges in the current environment can struggle.  If supers lose the ability to shoot subcaps then rorqs are off the menu.
---
If asset safety goes then people won't want to keep billions in researched BPOs in null sec.
---
It certainly does stop you doing industry but it sure as hell makes it harder.
---
Yes and in the end maybe if he wasn't finding eve fun anymore he should've dropped the rorqual alts for a while and try something else to see if mining/production was for him. Try out wh space, low sec piracy, high sex mining ops with an invitation to newbros ot whatever. If you just stick to one thing and keep to it you'll byrn yourself out. So before deciding to quit see if it was that boring thing you do every day is the problem
---
Excellent.
---
Yes, however it is much more fun with a group of friends 
---

I like how he was downvoted. Give people the ability to hide  unpopular opinions they will use it.
---
That's already the case...
---
Definitely. I'd suggest at least a scout alt though. Fits can range from Astero to Strat to Legion, and I'd kinda rank them in that order (3, 2, #1). Theres a few ways to do it, but solo hunting in wspace is viable if not somewhat time consuming.
---
If you destroy 575 T2 mining drones in a minute to negatively affect Goon income, for one minute.
---
me neither, but i'm not flexing about it on reddit big man
---
Here's an idea that would require a severe tweak to Guristas: have those high-slot modules provide drone bandwidth, instead of having that as a fixed stat. Small, medium and large variants would provide different amounts, and so would T1, meta, T2 and faction variants.
---
Can't be the downtrodden masses and the victorious underdogs without some good old koolaid thinking
---
RvB is not dead FYI, although their numbers have diminished. They mostly work together now, actually and do Faction Warfare. Apparently a good group to join too.
---
How long would it take to do 7 jumps in a thanatos? Trying to figure out of it's worth the effort to move it or just buy a new. Rough ball point please :)?
---
Again, it depended on your setup and what the character was going to be used for. If you did not need skills with int, you would not bother with training those learning skills(this is a grabass example, would have to deep dive and try to find numerous skillplans from a bygone era).
---
As for a new player, as I said before you would have them train a couple of those skills, then usually a smattering of different combat and navigation skills so they could actually enjoy the game a bit, then return to the learning skills so as to better retain them as a member of your corp.
---
Throwing up the generalized skillplan of the time that doesn't take into consideration much situations makes little sense when your original argument was that the 14 are different than learning skills since I could just as easily link the generalised skillplan of this era that ofc includes the 14.
---
As Tyran said, they already exist as alliance tournament rewards. I would like to see more of those though, so it would be nice if we could invent the BPC's we get. Also, more Marauders pls.
---
Yay i'm glad with people like you i'm just gonna wait 1 more year before being able to be competitive   
---
the SP system long after the release is just stupid it need to be changed a newbro should skill much faster than a old vet with 200m SP  
---
but i agree trowing SP is stupid they need to change the number of SP you gain 0-5m SP you skill 10faster , 5-15m 6x , 15-50 4x , 50-100 2x  and make those "bonus SP" un-extractable of course
---
Oh you mean the park bench? Yeah that homeless guy over there is sleeping on it.
---
Oh no you have to wait in a game like EvE, doesn't seem like the game had been like that since it came out near 20 years ago. Yet it's still played and people are still around even after 10+ years of playing
---
A way to get positive triglavian standings and doing some more stuff with trig invasions and abyss content
---
Oh yeah reset imperium; blue snuff + volta; sounds good but far to happen imo.
---
Because those people probably aren't going to log in for free SP if there is no observatory. Get it yet?
---
Local chat still works in null.  Just no itemization of characters unless they speak.
---
Remove and refund upgrades, and make anomaly spawn based on the inverse of the ADM. If the local pirates are getting massacred, you get less tomorrow.
---
Not everyone is created equal, some learn slower than others.
---
1. I like how you backpedaled on the "friend" keeping your account logged in and active to now it was your wife with POA. I can see how you could confuse the two. 
---
2. The point is you need to login for login events to get your rewards. Most MMOs have them and you don't get the rewards if you don't login. Simple as that. 
---
3. I don't see the facts supporting your conclusions. You're going to need to produce something other than your opinion. All of the stats I'm looking at don't show a dying game. It had a surge like most new games have and the populations seems to have settled out. 
---
4. I'm going to disagree with you there. SP bonus is still very helpful to a newbro
---
I already discussed how monetarily the SP was worth more to a Vet player, but that's hardly the point of giving the SP to begin with. The point is to provide an incentive to actively engage in content. Mainly newbros.
---
Rifters kill normal ratting ships and disrupt peaceful mining activities. I agree that the recent changes are impacting gameplay.
---
On the contrary. He should definitely be on one. And let us all know when and where he'll be flying.

---
I mean I don’t understand what exactly you’re highlighting here. This is exactly what we wanted. It effectively halves the yield, while making it more dangerous to even be out.
---
The Chaos era is devastating to younger players.
---
I'll keep it in mind thanks
---
You would be surprised what a concentrated effort would do. Most of the time people are looking for that silver bullet when really its the small things that ultimately make the difference.
---
I did it couple years back, one account only too. Anchored a POS in a C2 I bought, complete with POCOs. Dropped the structure one year later and just kept wandering on endlessly with Legion. I actually developed aversion to docking, always made me feel claustrophobic.
---
Solo wormhole life is the best tbh.
---
&gt; You get less than half the yield with T2 Mining drones
---
Half the yield? why do people even use excavators when you can get unlimited titans with 0 risk ever with miner II?
---
Plus, less of a target, plus no value for hunter.
---
Are you sure its only half?
---
Fab niche case you've got there...
---
Yeah, but we don't post the video to r/eve.
---
It's not like he forgot to train thermodynamics because of combat shakes either.
---
It's just a drop in the bucket right? If you have enough drops the bucket starts to get full though.
---
Oh my lord its the man of the hour. How's it feel to be so salty?
---
Awesome any tips ?
---
Yeah, it's half. That means it takes twice as long to make the same amount of ISK or you need double the players. Not an insignificant difference.
---
What ticks did you get in your typhoon?
---
lol
---
A goon thinking you have to gain something out of messing with someone?

Yeah, you guys are not the same you used to be.

---
Soon tm
---
To a degree, but not really. They have advantages but really cant kill much that can fight back. If you're flying a frigate, Astero is the best bet and can occasionally will be enough to take out pve cruisers. Stratios/Legion will let you kill pretty much any ratting subcap.
---
inb4 Dust 2 for PS4.
---
there no difference then, SP doesn't  create anything people buying skill injectour just loss isk for nothing created, but if those players don't need the SP and spend their ISK for a ship that create something, he can go pvp/pve and get killed one day but SP ? nothing  
---
the only thing skill injector does it's hurting the game economy, i would prefer if they sell the SP directly for RL money for this reason
---
Goons (I think) found this weird dude who makes these videos.  They paid him to make this.
---
&gt; t accomplishes the goal of crippling their ability to make ISK
---
Just like Olmeca killed goons forever. 
---
If an Excavator costs 540m and  a miner II costs 1.1 million, if you do this for only a couple hundred years, you can do the damage olmeca did in one year - which seemingly didn't effect anything with goons.
---
Not sure it maths out how you wanted.
---
Bro have you ever done distribution missions? Fuck, like it's so scary. I get the shakes every time they give me that 800m3 of Kernite. I undock, look around and THERE COULD BE ANYTHING THAT CAN HAPPEN. My mom sometimes makes me the sickest chicken noodle soup while I run these, and that shit be calming me down because it for real gets stressful. I'll see other dudes be in my overview when I warp to gates and then jump through. But then WHAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE? Sometimes it be like that when I can't even see my shit, but then after like a minute there's my ship. It was there the whole time I guess. Who needs pvp when you got pve, for real.
---
No one cares. Just quit quietly and stop making a scene with your shit opinion.
---
It is absolutely a problem, but yes, it is not an entire argument against the change, but it is a factor.
---
I'm assuming its more of a "If stuff gets blown up more stuff gets sold."
---

Exploration is great.  Find a wormhole and make your way out to null for real isk.  More details available here if needed.
---
The sisters of eve mission arc is supposed to be good.
---
There are some tutorial missions that are good for learning the very basics and give you a tiny, half-accurate idea of some things.
---
People will disagree, but before long I'd recommend joining one of the big null corps and going on some fleets.  I played the game solo for a month in 2006, quit.  Played solo for a month in 2010, quit. Didn't stick with it until I joined Brave Newbies in 2013.  Dreddit/TEST, Brave, Pandemic Horde, and Karmafleet are all fine to try.
---
Don't try to start from the bottom and be self-sufficient.  It's like the guy that made his own sandwich from actual scratch.  The game is too big for that and you'll spend most of your time doing the boring work inefficiently.
---
Now compare how much time you spend in a dreadnaught shooting stuff as a percentage of your game time, and compare that against the time a newbro is spending in his mission cruiser as a percentage of his game time.
---
Yes, even high level skills are important, my point is they don't as dramatically affect your entire game as newbros getting 10%+ in additional skillpoints.
---
Sounds like you need to try Farming Simulator.
---
I hunt relic and data site explorer bros in WH's, it's sort of slow but I mean that's my speed.
---
Basically I just find a highsec to WH space hole, go in, bookmark all the sites, and spam dscan.
---
Holes that work best have a highsec entry and bonus if all the relic and data sites are within 14AU of each other.

If more PvP breaks out then ships will sell. Simple as. If you can set up a crab hole or have a supply chain set up in hi sec for cheap-ish ore (because there are a lot of people who mine in hi-sec who dont care to fight for competitive prices), or own moons, then you will be able to do good business. 
---
The BP issue is something parts of null already deal with, and something WH indy guys have had solved forever. Bringing in BPCs is just one more part of logistics and they cost virtually 0 m3, so the only real hassle is remembering to run the copies. 
---
Procurers/Skiffs will still be King of nullsec when it comes to small mining operations, but that's to be expected when things get more dangerous, and it'll be more worth the trouble if ore prices keep rising
---
Lot's of peaople are recommanding you not to mine, let me tell you that you should, under some conditions, because high sec mining IS actually dull  :
---
- put CODE and such as contact, so you can see them entering local
---
- mining is a good activity if you have 2 monitors and want to semi-afk EVE while you are watching netflix, playing something else or answering people on reddit
---
- spice up your mining game : some ideas 
---
-- find somebody else moon belt, and mine it under their noses ( side effect may include whining, salt thrown in your direction, attempting gank .... good fun :D ) . You can get good null sec quality ore ( spod, arkonor, dark ochre) and also moon rock ( don't forget to put them on your overview)
---
-- another one: hop into a venture, find a wormhole and try to ninja mine or ninja huff gaz. That is not AFK as you need to be on lookout for sleepers or other players
---
-- same thing but in low sec. You can also ninja mine low sec moons
---
see ? mining can be fun
---
Why are you so fucking special?  This game makes people earn their keep or pay for it.  Stop being worthless.
---
So...you think EVE is boring, see that a part of the game is legitimately exciting for you, but choose not to do it?
---
7 jumps? About 10 seconds. Cyno up.
---
An actual INIT member.
---
The question stands. What's your opinion worth to us?
---
make objects in the solar system orbit their star.
---
Savespots could remain "local" to their nearest object (e.g. a spot 200km above a gate should remain 200km above wherever that gate currently is orbiting the star), but warp-times in system would be affected by the moving alignments.
---
&gt; people won't want to keep billions in researched BPOs in null sec.
---
Some people will, and reap that extra reward.
---
No it isn't welcomed by farmers. That's why you see people complaining they should get it on login rather than having to do something for it. SP farmers would have to log every character in and do the activity, which would take an extremely long time in some cases.
---
Nope but pressing f2+f3 sabre-ing gets hairy fast.
---
Oh ye thats flawed, no doubt. As you say we dont know the criterias so we cant really say anything definitive, merely speculate.
---
Honestly, its all become quite a shitshow.
---
How about 7 jump drive jumps, lol
---
No reset contemplated. The goal was shoot everyone not imperium/snuff (ie: TEST, panfam)
---
&gt; Not an insignificant difference.
---
Half is huge. If you say half and also its a capital ship with panic and neverdies and the new mining tools cost roughly 500 times less ... I mean - eve should be the place where miner II's were used anyhow. Faction drones shouldn't be the norm.
---
It's weird because it forces a way better situation for miners. They make less but are way less of a target, can scale just as easily. Plus rocks last longer so you can be 50% more afk.
---
People probably mine more because they don't lose 8 bil in excavators - they'll stay out longer in worse conditions and never risk anything. No need to skill for excavators. Will it be more than before? Probably not. Will it be 50% less? Not from this alone no.
---
This, I like this. Proper color choice.
---
Yes.  Any that are a requirement for basic shit like T2 tank should be free, or they should lower those requirements.
---
Anyone who has tried to bring a friend into the game should agree.  They need to be able to do stuff with you without having to train for a month first.
---
blowing up a million isk drone idc how many times you do it, isn't going to be the silver bullet. I agree that industry would be a pillar to try and knock over but GL doing that under the goons super umbrella
---
Agreed. Instead of suprise Events a bit more transparency would be great from ccp
---
What are you going to do about it apart from whine on r/eve?
---
Assuming one cyno alt that isn't in a force recon, somewhere in the region of two hours. Also depends on your skills since that determines jump drive range.
---
So the way Hilmar was talking about NPC stations had me a bit worried, but asset safety is a relatively new thing. We managed to survive from 2003 until 2016 without asset safety without it killing the game*.  
---
Assuming that NPC stations stay the same I don't think it's too unreasonable to think that if you're going to go on an extended evecation that you sell off anything you can't stick into a JF or carrier sma or move to the nearest NPC null or lowsec station**. It takes a while to lose a region, if you have all your shit on 1dq and you're taking a couple weeks or a month off to take a vacation irl then you probably aren't going to come back to your virtual house on fire, but if you're unsubbing for six months I don't think it's reasonable to expect everything to be the same when you come back.
---
 And if you have so much shit that taking some basic precautions before going on a long break is too much of a hassle then you might have too much shit
---
*Granted, pre-citadel you're assets weren't destroyed, they were just in a station that you couldn't redock in if you undocked so you could fire sale or have a spy move them, but they were still basically gone if you lose your station. I think the game lost something important when asset safety was introduced guaranteeing that your shit was always safe
---
**It might be worth making some NPC space out in the feyth/omist area and in the deep drone lands to make easy temp evacs possible like it is in delve/fountain and the areas around stain/curse/venal.
---
I keep debating on getting that game.
---
This is a great idea
---
I think this should be reposted in "Ugly Confessions" subreddit.
---
sorry but that was an easy extraction with subcapital support on grid and other supers around, not a risky situation.   
---
I understand your view of potential risk but once you get used to move more fragile ships into more dangerous grid you won't measure risk the same way. What i intend to say is, he was never in risk of dying until he started to panic, he just pushed himself into that position, eventually he will die yes but doesn't means the risk was that high. You can lose a chremoas to a meta algos, doesn't means you where in huge risk, you follow me?
---
I have 80m+ SP and wouldn't use an injector for that reason, that said there's loads of skills I don't have such as caldari frigate 5. I only have caldari BS 3. I would be more likely to inject these skills when my alliance changes doctrine.
---
I have absolutely abysmal industrial skills, so if I randomly decided I wanted to do so on my main, it would be great. Shit, I'd probably inject some trade skills too. But I ain't paying 1b for 150k sp.
---
You gotta start  somewhere
---
this
---
You are the big dumb. This is like omnibrain levels of dumb. 
---
You are doing the equivalent of knocking one dude out, not even killing him and going "ROME WASN'T LAID TO WASTE IN A DAY!"
---
Man some of these people need to look in the mirror and ask themselves “ am I a weeny?”
---
Ok seems the Strat will be my boat of choice
---
Unless you are goonswarm double the players is a huge difference.
---
Yeah, fuck those guys
---
Learning skills were a trap for new players. If you didn't train them all to level 5 you continuously fell behind every other player in the game.
---
If you were to remove "the magic 14" just because its a time sink then you may as well remove every skill. You aren't being continuously punished for not training power grid management to 5. You just can't squeeze out every ounce of fitting space in your ship and you'll make compromises on the fit.
---
Now the observant person might say "Why Cybernetics 5 unlocks +5 implants. People without Cyber 5 are falling behind. And people who aren't mapped optimally are falling behind. And your first year of skills is when you really need to be mapped all over the damn place."
---
And to that I say "Yeah, remove attributes and just let all skills train at a fixed sp/min rate"
---
Thanks, doesn't sound completely awful.
---
Spoken like someone who needs an excuse to do nothing
---
Why would you self-incriminate?
---
And why so snotty the group you joined has titans ratting, why too stupid to sell the eyes on the ratting titan?  
---
Seems like a victim just shitposting. Too stupid to succeed at eve and wants to crab few pennies instead of collect payment for super kills. Actually dumb, actually less ISK made. 
---
Witty post mate, you really got whoever you're after
---
I disagree . Lot's of people have moon belts in hsec, with a bit of recon you can always find one active and mine null sec quality ore. Of course, you won't be able to use a rorq, be they won't be able to kick you out unless resorting to gank :D 
---
They'll moan and bitch about you, and you will mine so much salt :D
---
This isn't a niche case. It's just not a PVP case.
---
it isnt though. Since blackout begun, the majority of timezones have seen similar activity to pre blackout for the first couple days they were somewhat lower, but that wasnt long lasting or significant. The only timezone that has a major difference is since blackout, many of the already low periods, have gotten even lower. I dont think the AU tz is just biased to not want to play eve anymore, I think that characters that would generally be online all day long arent on right. That is to say bots are having a hard time, and are probably waiting out hoping that this ends soon. In other timezones this difference is made up for by people logging in more than before.  
---
I dont have the data sure, but i believe CCP when they say more users are logging in and playing.
---
You can start working for me $10 an hour picking up heavy shit. You'll have a house and family and success in no time. Glad I found you.
---
Most def, I mean, most of us are not 20 years old anymore. We dont have the time or the patience to "be cool and hardcore", just fix the stuff that needs fixing and chill. But it seems they wanna do just about everything else than just that.
---
The yield is half, but they have more speed so it's not actually half, and don't cost 500m isk each so losing one doesnt negate hours of mining.
---
LoL
---
That's pretty awesome
---
How cute they are learning.
---
I know you think posting various "death by a thousand cuts" quotes will certify you the wise bad-ass leader of the anti-Goon movement, but it won't.
---
Bombing a handful of mining drones will inconvenience a single Rorq pilot into having to bring over more. At least with Excavators you could make the argument you were destroying a few billion worth of assets and have a killboard to back up said claims, but that diminished usage of them means that you're only killing 1.1m~ ISK per drone. And yes, you think that's a lot, but it isn't. There are singular rat bounties worth more than that, and Goons are making 10x that money PER MINUTE.
---
But, yeah drop in the bucket, destroy the pillar, Rome in a day...
---
You are right. Local is super empty these days. Maybe CCP is getting us to a place where we can use titans as originally designed
---
You means vy asking to regroup all data ? No just make more easier to people to exploit they.
---
Bye lol
---
Great idea
---
If i were to do something it would be ganking haulers on gates. But it's more important to me to be having fun playing the game. I'm not so deluded that i think i could even damage any alliance by myself. Nor would i bother.
---
Well he clearly knows more about metrics than the company who collects them from just THIS ONE STATISTIC. DEVELOPERS HATE HIM!!
---
The rorq can carry like 100 sets of them, and your bomb cost more than the drones....
---
Seriously. Just sitting around jerking themselves over their pile of money they'll never use. Fun game
---
Wrong, because delve is so population dense. A lot of hunters default to roaming their space. We have been running excavators in abondened regions with little problems.
---
Maybe you should spread out to less dense regions?
---
Excavators use the same skills as the normal t2 mining drones.... just less value in drone lands since a lower demand for the drone parts.
---
I'm not sure why you seem so concerned with refuting what I'm saying then
---
If I’m reading this right (and I didn’t). You want dreads to get their drone bays back?
---
Protip: Deploy probes, self destruct ship, probes remain in space after you leave the system.
---
Extra protip: deploy probes, swap ship with carrier SMB, probes remain in space after you leave the system
---
or 1 faction scram
---
Lol, these guys have watched too many movies man. "Kill some t2 drones and delve is crippled, small guys win against big guys all the time after all."
---
Adapt or die.
---
They're a typically low resolution "solution" CCP has to removing local.  They provide no gameplay for the typical player over and above, say, a refactored, reworked and re-imagined radar system (dscan).
---
I hope they don't happen and that CCP hire some people with imagination.
---
Ummm NO! LOL you did not read it right
---
Fair enough
---
&gt; We have been running excavators in abondened regions with little problems
---
The "we" of which you speak is almost certainly a statistical blip in the overall MER.
---
Perhaps null sec isn't, and never was, for you.
---
This is why I fly without pants
---
Perhaps its not
---
I have adapted until I am almost dead
---
The only MMO I hoped never to catch the damn anime plague, did.
---
I have 4 mil is that enough?
---
Sounds like you still got a bit to go then.
---
The yield is less than half and most of the time you're going to be mining in the middle of a cluster so travel time isn't a large part of the overall yield calculation. Half is a decent round estimate. If you want to be precise then you would need to get in to yield time for a specific asteroid based on distance.
---
Haha, I agree
---
who can defend their own shit? the bigger blocs 
---
who can't defend their own shit? smaller alliances
---
so p much get fucked back to lowsec to anyone not aligned to tapi/goons/plnc
---
All you need to stop you is a cheap destroyer with a defender launcher
---
Kill the drones, kill the ship, seems legit to me.
---
Cool story.
---
What is your point?
---
That nullsec should be safe enough for 4 pilots to do whatever they want?
---
blackout also wasn't meant as a total fix. It's just a step.
---
&gt;They get a ton of Free SP to start with already... they can extract and reinject if it's just silly.
---
This is about new players, not new alts of already established players. Suggesting to a new player that he can "just extract and reinject" if he changes his ways (who doesn't at some point) is maybe the dumbest comment in this entire thread.
---
Funny thing, most of the jobs people start off doing are exactly that. I don't think I started out at $100k working my way through school.
---
I just returned during the blackout after 8 months or so of winning, honestly its not that big of a change. If you're in test space you should have good enough intel to PvE safely anyway
---
I do understand. 
---
Goons went behind inits back and sided with panfam. Dick move.
---
Just don't be ass at it and adapt nerd
---
&gt;Not everyone must enjoy PVP.
---
No, they don't. But imagine how fun it would be for everyone if all players did pvp regularly. ISK would be worth a lot because so much ships and modules would get destroeyd all the time. The more players do PVP the better game Eve becomes for everyone, even for industrialists.
---
Alt with 100km jams decloaks in the distance
---
no one can do everything by them self. It requires teamwork to be effective the point is null sec had like risk before and now it has risk. Intel bots aren't feeding you 24/7 you need people that have eyes and brains not F1 monkey's
---
Funny, because I keep hearing how unfair it is and how there's no counter for bombers.
---
I have adapted lol.
---
Try highsec
---
delet this
---
Haha thanks for your opinion :3 interesting
---
from the autistic screeching below i can see this is a good thing
---
time to log back in
---
I prefer the view of my hel unobstructed thank you.
---
&gt; Rifters which kill your vnis
---
Looks like it's time to come back
---
No, you have 4 accounts, thats already enough for 1 pve ship and 3 gates to scout. No need for replacement, wormhole does not need that as well.
---
Everythings fine.
---
Bombs cost around 900k a piece and most of the time you'e going to kill more than one drone. Even if I only kill one flight of them that's about 4 times more for the drones than the bombs.
---
As if the MER is an indication of anything meaningful.
---
Bro, spellchecker is your friend. Fuck.
---
And since youre no longer min/maxing you can just tank the shit out of the ship without any real loss and you no longer need t2 rigs either. So cheaper rorqs with minimum risk and no gain for an attacker outside of a shitty km (full fit under 2b). Plus since its shitty drones people can truly afk now since biggest threat was always NPCs killing the excavs.
---
People are very shortsighted, they dont seem to understand that for every action there will be a reaction. Seldom in the way one wants it.
---
Post your killboard
---
rest of eve cry, because goons  
---
CCP turn off local  
---
rest of eve laught  
---
goons adapt  
---
rest of eve cry again  
---
.  
---
well done goon ;-)
---
To each their own man. Don't insult me though because my playstyle isn't your playstyle
---
I know it is supposed to be "temporary" in the interview I read that is not the intent at all, it is to be permanent. It would be nice if 4 pilots could survive in null, I know that is too optimistic even for me.   I am in a large corp in a large alliance. That should tell you something. I am simply asking for a little consideration for the casual player. I wanted cuddles I would not be in the corp I am in.  I am ok with risk, it should be balanced with reasonable chance of success, skill based yes.
---
I meant an (iirc) omni-resist base hull. For most ships, going hardeners is practically quite good, though stacking pure rep power would be stronger for min-maxing just that. But we're talking armour tanking &amp; lowslots, so buffer matters a lot, unlike shields.
---
He’s just a goon shill
---
A) No.
---
And
---
B) Crabs have gone right back to it. We bagged a Hel last night because ticks are crack cocaine.
---
Thanks. I'll have a look
---
They've been long gone now it's all j4fags
---
&gt;This does two things, removes the barrier of using injectors from long term players 
---
Why should they be able to inject at all?
---
I agree, however it should be replaced with skill based Intel gathering. in time it will be very hard to take out a roam and have a reasonable chance of killing anything.
---
&gt;Oh and no pvp zones would be nice.
---
I don't think you understand how this game works.
---
Moracha is not THAT much better than a loki yet you seem to think is less risky than dropping a nano super. Of course it all depends on how and where you fly it, still not need that much to take down a moracha picture a very fast loki. Still this is NOT about who risk mores just that intigo uses a ship that's far more expensive on a semi regular basis sometimes under overwhelming forces that cold pop the 400b recon with no problem. I must also state that almost no one hunts supers anymore yet there's still very skilled hunters for AT ships.  
---
AT ships aren't that strong, just stronger still cruicers and frigs.
---
On your second point you don't start in a super or at least i didn't, far from it. He put in risk the subcapital fleet if not even another super that stayed in out of bubble screening for him, which i didn't saw in this case but it's not a huge stretch to picture that progresion of events. 
---
It's not to shit on the dude, i stated earlier that if fresh from a break i would understand confusion and freezing cause of new mechanics/not being used to it. But honestly not having thermo trained it's probably a injected char played by someone that has not much experience on grids that need yourself to make your own decisions. now i'm probably just bothering you with this, but the dude posted it expecting feedback, he has it now, he can handle it i'm sure.
---
Fair enough. The social aspect of it actually helped mine a lot when I was in a bad place and didn't really have any close friends 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Thanks for the tip :3
---
Should CCP "deinject" them?
---
Unspoken Alliance also doing well. Blackout is the best thing to happen to Eve in a long time.
---
&gt;I like how you backpedaled on the "friend" keeping your account logged in and active to now it was your wife with POA. I can see how you could confuse the two.
---
His friend dresses as his wife so he gets the two confused sometimes
---
Haha what are you, an independent alliance, lol, snuff pets
---
+ off grid tengu + high-grade rep sets + premium booster + abyssal deadspace mods
---
gf!
---
Working as attended almost nobody has the balls to use excavs
---
I want anaconda mines back!
---
sorry if it wasn't clear, I was talking about if new players screw up training to some silly extent as that was one justification in replies. I'm not sure what's dumb about having some cost to making a mistake in training. 5m SP at least 3 months of game time by traditional training... I'm all for making introduction and on boarding periods better and less punishing for mistakes, but there is a certain point where fucking up is on the player and not the mechanics.
---
Got em!
---
But but but how are you finding any kills if no one is logging in or undocking?
---
&gt;The dailies will push out a lot fo the people that play eve because it *doesn't* have that kind of crap in it.
---
Nah they'll just ignore them.
---
&gt;Frankly I think they should stop giving out all this crap and just go back to Sub to play and be done with it.
---
There's a reason few subscription based games even exist anymore. The game was losing players and revenue. Alpha accounts etc helped. Free SP is beneficial to alphas. 
---
&gt;They should find something other than SP to do this with though.
---
Nope, SP is pretty much the best thing to do with it
---
This must be the Titan pilot who keeps docking up
---
&gt; I am in a large corp in a large alliance. That should tell you something.
---
Then why does your whole story not once mention actually working with those other players to build your safety? Why is it on you to alone scout gates and scan systems?
---
&gt; I know it is supposed to be "temporary" in the interview I read that is not the intent at all, it is to be permanent. 
---
This is an irrelevant comment. I wasn't talking about it being temporary or permanent. It just isn't supposed to be the one magic bullet. It's just a piece of the solution.
---
Oh wow, that would really make folks salty.
---
I think you guys are more obsessed with posting about "salt" on reddit than themselves about eve. Like a bunch of teenage girls who complains that there's "too much drama around" but can't stop talking about dramas all day.
---
So that makes it a good idea.
---
my friend. come join the wormhole life with a nullsec static. it eliminates roaming 40 jumps. literally instant content.
---
As someone who has camped many a wormhole for months on end skill at Intel is trail and error. Also i have personal been out in null more since the start of this blackout and have seen bots that are still ticking mining fleets still running. the only difference is they actually fight off people now instead of instant dock. ( bots are still dumb and funny to watch die )
---
good point, I have 4 accounts and 3 of them have subs ending late of august. so now with no semiafk vni ratting I do not have reason to sub them again. I gave content some roamers to get my vni hunted, when i play them semiafk, but now roamers just find nothing. it looks like win for them :-D
---
Right on man; vote with you wallet... fck em
---
change the fee to either 30%-40% and make supers/titans drop/get destroyed according to loot fairy
---
Dude, something had to change. People multiboxing ISK generating accounts in essentially perfect safety in null had to go. Forcing you to log in and watch local to just dock up was bad gameplay for both you and for the hunters. 
---
Go to highsec if you want low-attention gameplay. Otherwise, once things adjust, there will be plenty of ISK available for the brave in nullsec. Or mothball those two accounts and buy a couple hundred $ in PLEX each year to fund you PvP. You’ll have more fun that way then wasting your life watching local. 
---
Adapt.
---
You have 4 accounts. You only PVE to support PVP. You are in a large alliance. I assume they have SRP, as most do. Your PVE effort should be quite minimal to make up for the initial investment of PVP ships. Your FC's are "burnt out" because they have to look for content, but you're not doing anything to look for it. You justify this by saying you don't have a lot of play time, but enough to PVE for PVP ships.
---
Some of this sure doesnt add up.
---
You can't have high reward without high risk. It goes against the spirit of the game. People have been saying the risk/reward of null has been skewed for a long time. This is one step to restore that balance. 
---
Null was never intended nor should have ever been a safe haven for casual players
---
Yes, actually. That's pretty much straight up terminal cancer for the game.
---
Sounds like something a risk averse hunter would say
---
You defo should. Much more fun and will net you some decent isk
---
[Aaaahhhh...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/077/so_good.png)
---
You’re god damn right it isn’t!
---
Hunting is totally doable solo.
---
That's Wingspan's whole claim to fame. Could be smart to join them if you want some guidance, or just have a go yourself.
---
Obviously, you're targets will be limited by what you bring, but that's expected.
---
As far as tools, you don't really need much. You could use a wormhole chain map, but it wouldn't be super important, just because you will be fairly nomadic, and don't need to help others through your chain, so you can probably handle enough of the map just in your head.
---
Wut
---
\^Underrated comment.
---
&gt; Content creators are getting burned out trying to find targets of opportunity
---
What the fuck are you talking about lol
---
If you're just hunting frigates, it would be smarter to use a rocket bomber with scram/point/web/prop
---
go to highsec, you lot should never have left in the first place
---
This is how the second anime war in EVE starts.
---
As we only have one pet - INIT - and ourselves are pets of a better alliance - WANGS - what are you even talking about?
---
&gt; so now with no semiafk vni ratting I do not have reason to sub them again
---
why the fuck do you even play this game
---
One Cruor interceptor please
---
Post the killboard.
---
Anyone who "Mines to sustain pvp" is just a miner.
---
My guess is your buddy is classic nullbear (but with teeth, teehee)
---
Intimidating others with combat probes is a valid tactic for exploration too. You launch combats and your Helios gets more scary. :)
---
A true man of culture I see.
---
I’m not just hunting frigates. That’s just what I tend to get.
---
&gt; I am in a large corp in a large alliance
---
Then you should have lots of people in that group able to help with intel.
---
&gt; I am ok with risk, it should be balanced with reasonable chance of success, skill based yes
---
Then presumably you agree removing local is good, because local provided a completely unreasonable level of safety and was impossible to evade with any kind of skill.
---
WAFFLES are fucking CRUSHING IT right now

and we got the whole OG squad back, just missing /u/hlynurth who we are working on

Not in NSH anymore but they weren’t having a problem either.

fleet pvp IS 100% boring as shit.  
---
small gang pvp is also 98% boring, 2% awesome. 
---
solo pvp is 99% boring camping, 1% awesome ganking. 
---
pve is 100% boring, but you can do other shit while doing it so eh?
---
Maybe if you knew how to fuckin hunt instead of do your bullshit lowsec shenanigans you'd be taken seriously.
---
I hope that's flair bait because lol snuff going out and doing any kind interesting pvp.
---
Well, playing eve tends to give you lots of little snippets of free time, and people tend to spend that time shit talking on reddit.
---
very well, just pointing it out.
---
Bombers have no cloak targeting delay, which is a major thing.
---
You can but you'll get bored of scanning. Far better to find a corp to play with.
---
Cool cool, post your killboard.
---
Um, big targets stay docked, didn't you hear?
---
summer stats ... best stats?
---
don't warp straight to gates, friendo
---
Those faction cap injects will get ya.
---
Who's that
---
No matter how hard you try the true krabs thoughts is just too retarded to think about and will put you on their level
---
hi stfu thanks bye
---
You act like taking space is the end all and be all. That somehow building an empire is the goal for everyone.
---
Frankly this whole line of reasoning is just giving yourself a cop out for when things get hard and you feel the need to bend the knee. It's bullshit and you know it. Tying yourself and identity to sov is your first mistake.
---
Right after PS5 is announced.
---
Where'd you go homie
---
to play with main and fly with it whatever i want. Enough ISK getting from alts... 
---
btw. why the fuck every industrialist or anyone with that kind of gameplay even play this game?
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Falcon and Hilmar
---
&gt; since most BS have 5-6 launchers
---
and most BS have a damage bonus to get it up to 8 effective launchers
---
I really like Fight Club. Maybe we can hang out at Eve Vegas.
---
I sub 3 accounts.  mostly to do indy / logistics.  i don't rat much or mine because it is boring as shit and like op, i don't have a ton of time to do mindless shit.  I'd like to say that i pve so that i can pvp, but yea with SRP and the lack of fights, i pve more than needed.  it happens.
---
Inside jokes you're not invited to.
---
Aka: nobody wants snuff around, you're like a bad fart.
---
I joined the donut and went to init. Been like 3 years since I did some of the bigger stuff so wanted to give it another go.
---
Hey buddy. You raise some interesting questions. I don't have the answer to all of them but my alliance is directly related to the Amarr incident. If you want to talk some pm me here or in game.
---
Faction everything tends to do that. The recent hawks feed had a 16b apostle that is standard for bling fits
---
Jesus christ bro, are you ok
---
better that killmail than nothing ;-)   
---
btw why ppl even hunt VNIs when it was NO CONTENT?
---
Well damn, looks like there's one less tootsie roll in the litterbox, err sandbox.
---
I don't think so. Where does this end? Everybody 'needs' T2 small hybrids, drones V and Advanced Weapons Upgrades too.
---
They're not like the learning skills in that you have to train them before anything else or you're losing out.
---
You presented your playstyle publicly and got scrutiny from the public. Don't post it if you don't want people to comment on it.
---
for a veteran player of like 2+ years or so you can pay for your account ingame with 1 or 2 play sessions... with some luck.
---
for fresh off the boat though it is basically impossible... just play around and see if you like the game; if you do- subscribe.
---
Post your ingame name and I might buy you a month sub... cause I might just biomass anyday now anyways.
---
Another good way is just to farm them for kills in your neutral Loki alt.
---
 I said nothing about not wanting low attention game play. Just better Intel than no Intel. and something that does not take another hour I do not have to set up every time I want to do something.
---
Why not, its reddit :P
---
I think it’s the depression. Or the spod
---
&gt; For skills that people will basically say are required or you're not gonna have fun
---
That's absolutely not the case though. You don't need all those skills at V.
---
fuck yes, waffles doin it rite
---
who is null sec for then? only super pilots?
---
A moracha can use a covert ops cloak. With a covert ops cloak you can EASILY chose your battles. Bridge with covert bridge range? A hel is safer than a moracha? With the right pilot and proper intuition, you can EASILY be safer than a hel. With the right pilot you can never be touched. I don't disagree with the aspect that new people shouldn't be in supers, but the reality is that this is EVE 2019. Until CCP changes the meta, THAT IS THE META. 
---
The only thing that I can see anyone argue is that supers are so easy to jump in compared to a kitey AT cruiser. That is Eve 2019, get used to it and wait for CCP to change that. 
---
If PL wants to recruit people that are 'Low tier' that is their problem. You want to shit on people for not having thermo injected, fair enough. All they can do is learn from their mistakes at their own pace.
---
Good if you don't want to do the legwork you shouldn't be entitled to the rewards of nullsec. Have fun running level 2s. Or fuck off, that works too.
---
Behind your back? Lolol, Sister Bliss signed off before the agreement was finalized. Again, you need to educate yourself.
---
Why did CCP ruin your playstyle? 
---
* Cloud technology was shittily implemented and broke local
---
So don't frame it like you can get a community on your side or to agree with you - it's a forced game decision that brings publicity to EVE. The players don't get a say in this and never did.  Even if people want to agree and get rid of fun blackout - CCP still has a local chat that doesn't work great - costs money and results in hundreds of threads as reddit Reeees that it's not fixed (because we can't go back - cloud local is forever moving forward)
---
The most important thing - CCP sets a harden the fuck up precedent they will use in the next 3 years as they move combat and other eve systems onto cloud technology. Again, with little forethought and without coding specifically for it - so eve combat turns broken like local did. People are dumb enough to think it's for them and will use it to fuel their hatred against whoever dominated them.
---
Cloud technology saves money because you only pay for what you use instead of paying for x amount of servers that sometimes get utilized, sometimes not. You can have 4,000 processors for a single system instead of one and have your 10,000,000 player battle in eve - with people phasing in and out of reality and combat breaking because that's state of the art cloud technology.
---
Each step morons can laugh as "null" cries or whoever the scapegoat is - they believe CCP is on their side. You might not like blackout and I probably don't care that your turn to have your playstyle is ruined, someone else who had theirs ruined is coming back to the game.
---
But I do care about the game getting shittier and that's what cloud technology has done and will continue to do as EVE is forced into that framework. It's in motion, Hilmar is putting everything on cloud technology to save money - and hiring coder s to implement this technology correctly is not something Hilmar is willing to do. That's spending money, we need to save money to keep our ceo salary.
---
Does blackout address some player concerns? Sure (it obviously needs further tweaking) And all the other massive changes will to. But the reasoning is cloud or no balls - not because game balance.
---
Anyone with a brain that knows how to play the game and carve out their space
---
i think you are drasically underestimating the amount of teamwork that went into building the current sov structure.  you are welcome to go try and empire build, but i imagine you will find that it is like a second job.  Null isn't safe by default, it was made that way from years of empire building.
---
What the fuck is that sentence?
---
I have two accounts, and play maybe an hour to two a day tops. You don't *have* to do mindless shit believe it or not. If you're pve'ing because there's no pvp, GO MAKE THE PVP. It's not CCPs fault people just expect content to be made for them. Maybe go learn how to do that instead of pve "more than you need to" ffs.
---
The biggest issue is that I'm not 12 years younger.
---
just asking for consideration of the little guy with no time, and yes I have friend who help with Intel but even in this large of an alliance not everyone is one 24/7 to help in my little corner.  I have stated in the past local needed to go away, but it needs replaced with some skill based timely to use mechanics. No crying, Not whining, just saying hey, if Im not a concern let me go. If I am take a min
---
what the fuck even is this post?
---
Some years ago when I was active in FW, there was a few Tusker pilots who were active in the same area.
---
This one guy who's name I can't recall was the one thing we always dreaded finding. Dude could pilot anything sub capital and was extremely good at ripping small gangs to shreds solo. 
---
I eventually trained an alt into a Falcon that I would always trail the gang with cloaked just to deal with him and keep him off us. He *always* showed up in the ideal ship to counter our gangs, and he was fucking *good* at it.
---
To this day, their PvP ability is something I'm envious of
---
A nice little bit of a laugh on a Friday
---
I'm teasing you at this point, mate. Calm down.
---
yup.  cause all those small groups are just living large out in null.  /s 
---
fucking idiot.
---
god dont remind me
---
I have to agree with the risk vrs Reward statment, and yes to a hard core player there is not place for the casual player. However CCP is in a business that needs to make money. Casual players tend to spend more over a period of time than the larger percentage of hard core players. The plex you buy for your accounts probably comes from a casual players wallet.
---
Not whining, just pointing out how wrong you are.
---
Chair I like you and always thought you were a beautiful piece of furniture.
---
But I have to downvote everything you said here :-(.

True, I would post complaining the op should sell intel resulting in the death of my titan. That way I can undock and die in the titan, having given that idea birth.
---
I understand. ❤️ I love you too.
---
Obviously nothing. But I have never once cared what random INITlinemember#2314 thought since it is apparent you are incapable of it.
---
I don't find roaming around doing jack shit nothing hours or cloaky camping systems to pvp that much fun.  especially when pvp is basic as shit.  There are plenty of games that have much much much better pvp with much much much less down time.  
---
The unique part of eve for me was the empire building.  pvp sucked, but at least it "meant" something in the long haul.
---
Literally just move to a different sec if you're not good enough to have a small movement in Nullsec
---
actually - since everyone is using t2 mining drones and don't have to worry about expensive killmails - we can lol fit these rorquals to mine closer towards 75% of excavators, especially since we don't have to actually move b/c of the miner speeds.
---
\#FreeGigX
---
What goal should I have for myself? I'm not a newbro, I have a fairly skilled subcap pilot, more than a few billions in the bank and 6 low-skilled omega alts. What activity could I do that leverages my many alts? Something pvp-oriented probably, but I'm not sure what to do.
---
You misspelled Wyvern
---
Is there a safe way to get a destroyer to Nullsec without getting bubbled?  I'd like to go ratting/get PvP that I might fare better in, because FW has people away above my level.  I figured that null would either have (a) new pilots or (b) risky isk-making via... Rats?
---
Where's this sub 2 bil T2 fit? 
---
If you drop out the mining rigs you're going to be at less than 1/3 the mining capacity of a T2 rigged excavator mining Rorq. If you go with T1 rigs you'll be a little over 1/3. The rigs would be the only real thing to affect your tank unless you're trying to cram the midslots with Nav computers which, IMO, are somewhat of a waste for more than one. 
---
I'm just trying to figure out where this awesome sub 2 bil Rorq that nobody is going to care to lose is.  Especially when they're making 1/3 of what they used to make mining with them. That's going to make each loss that much tougher to make up for.
---
Because not all of them are afk, some actually fight back and some call in backup that you might be able to fight.
---
this is some top tier r/eve conspiracy theory
---
So rather than having 1000 extra titans, imperium will only have 500?
---
Then why does it have the ring?
---
Extra extra protip: get 8 probes (the ship), rename them "Combat Probe", make some safespots , fly a Probe to each one and eject. Permanent probes in system.
---
Maybe you should try getting better at the game instead of seething in my inbox sweety
---
With a decent computer you could multi box dozens of accounts. If you were dedicated enough even name them all normally, have Corp chat and blend in as different people without raising too much attention. Have 200 alpha accounts linked around a few holding omegas and rotate them on login times to seem ‘natural’ or as random as you could make while adhering to a pattern and make new accounts randomly throughout the day get them into mining  venture and retire an older alpha clone. Have a few that stick around.

oh

Says the member of a laughingstock of an Alliance.

&gt;You may say I am too risk averse. I say yes I am
---
move to highsec
---
&gt;I do enough PVE to fuel my PVP.
---
no reason why highsec can't fuel your pvp
---
You were making a point and I was countering that point. It's called a debate. You devolved in to name calling when you obviously didn't have a good response.
---
Rote kapelle best kapelle!
---
Its really my fault for putting too much faith in the intelligence of nullsec line members.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb here with the hundreds and hundreds of posts the last few weeks. Eve is pretty important to you and you don't have much going on, eh?
---
&gt;sorry but that was an easy extraction with subcapital support
---
our subcap fleet was 6 leshaks lmao what the fuck are you talking about
---
&gt;other supers around
---
other hostile supers, sure. other friendly ones? no, not a one within 2 mids plus a regional, but nice try tho
---
&gt;not a risky situation.
---
you're *retarded*
---
&gt;I understand your view of potential risk but once you get used to move more fragile ships into more dangerous grid you won't measure risk the same way. 
---
\&gt;tuskers flair

look kiddo you may not know me very well but uhh

lmao
---
&gt;he was never in risk of dying until he started to panic, he just pushed himself into that position

he was at risk of dying until he entered warp, and he continued to be at risk of dying after that as we were stuck bouncing celestials in a hostile system within range of their staging keepstar with no jump range to anywhere outside of the region

&gt;You can lose a chremoas to a meta algos,

---
Probably for the same reason that you feel the need to prove it by posting in response to any goon with a pulse?
---
The most difficult thing noone talks about is learning to fit any ship for any use. A ship is ammo. A fitting is a patch on the ammo, helping and enabling your goal. 
---
Figuring out what ship you need and what modules to fit to get most of out of it is challenging...
---
People are suppose to be able to pick fights with you. Having access to 100% perfect evasion via perfect intel is shitty gameplay for both sides. 
---
Maybe there does need to be some intel structure to claw back some of the intel capabilities nullsec had before, but it had been way too safe for way too long. 
---
If you and/or your group is too casual, Empire space is still there with its perfect intel. The game should have a place for everyone, from the most risk-averse to the most hardcore adrenaline junkie. CCP is just making the deep end a little deeper, but the safer, more shallow ponds are still there. For too long, CCP has been leveling things out and making everyone too rich and too safe. Time for a change and some more diversity in game play. 
---
I wondered the same thing so I set out to find the answer and put my results on youtube. My Wormhole Adventures: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbos6Fd2KTsxbG6KImHWAyAzlHgs6BPVp
---
Others: Lol, goons, if you don't like losing them, don't use excavators.
---
Goons: K. We will just use T2 drones.
---
Others: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I still have 100k of them lol
---
&gt; Your FC's are "burnt out" because they have to look for content
---
No, his FCs are burned out because they are the content
---
Surprise, in blackout all of the shitters in fleet feed like morons
---
&gt; I meant an (iirc) omni-resist base hull. For most ships, going hardeners/EANMs is practically quite good, though stacking pure rep power would be stronger for min-maxing just that. But we're talking armour tanking &amp; lowslots, so buffer matters a lot, unlike shields.
---
For PVP sure, for PVE not a chance. The requirements for PVE are quite exact about their minimums. You only need enough buffer that you won't get alphaed in between rep cycles and any more than that is completely wasted.
---
&gt;Also, for armour, have you checked out adding an under-sized repper if you want more tank than resists will give you? MAR+SAR can be best, sometimes with 1 more Nano than Aux pump otherwise.
---
Dropping the 4th enam and putting a medium faction repper (which costs 3 times as much as the large faction reppers, which themselves cost twice as much each as the faction shield booster) only increases the rep amount to 580 EHP/s.
---
Lol... what you really said
---
&gt; grr they chose adapt over die
---
Same, lmao
---
Ganking is always an option.
---
They are prob skilling for barges. Takes a while to get there with alpha accounts.
---
Hunters also roam delve because goons. Spreading out will just make their lives easier
---
2009? Fucking noobros.
---
Help me understand why Rote Kapelle is a laughing stock?
---
Some mega irony in this statement.
---
You really do, though, because if you don't you're going to be at an objective disadvantage versus someone who does. Without Mechanics/Hull Upgrades/Shield Management/Shield Operation V, you're going to have less tank. Without CPU Management/Powergrid Management V you're not going to be able to fit as much to your ship. Without Capacitor Management/Capacitor Systems Operation you're not going to be as cap stable. Without Signature Analysis V you're going to lock slower which is *huge* for a lot of fights because a good number of fights come down to who locks who first.
---
Without 9 of the Magic 14 at V you are at an objective disadvantage, and often an extremely significant one, compared to a potential opponent. All the Magic 14 does is require you to waste 2-3 months of training time just to be on a level playing field with everyone else.
---
sorry mate if you can't understand what i'm saying i will jsut stop trying, good luck and good day
---
Why do we have to do that?
---
You didn't have a good response. You talking about chipping the tiniest bit away at a rate that they can regenerate far faster and acted like you are doing actual damage.
---
No what I really said is that no one is ballsy enough deploy their excavs, good try on the spin tho
---
Mon-ica
---
On behalf of the community, I deeply apologise that this game is hard.
---
for you to fuck off and not try to talk about supercaps ever again is probably the best thing
---
When init decides to not be goon pets call me.
---
The same reason we have to spend any time at all training into ships.
---
Having a brain and knowing how to play the game = joining the biggest alliance in EVE?
---
Insert wall of people telling you that your opinion is wrong and theirs is right.
---
Because they still use subcaps and don’t drop supers on everything. Lol total retards
---
MCAV is doing great. We've had 4.5 Zkill pages' worth in two days, which for a small to mid-size corp is pretty huge. Lotta good fights, plenty of roaming opportunities.
---
Also we're recruiting.
---
They pushed alphas to far away in the first place. Nerfing is slaping people across the face with no reason.
---
VNI  remake  is fine.
---
For a game with so many people spending their lives on pvp meta it's a huge turd at the end.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
you can be more selective with the moracha, yes. once you start to fight is far more vulnerable. Only reaosn i brnged it up was because one dude was mocking inti with the "under enemy umbrella" concept which i just found gunny, i could have choosen the fiend which wouldn't be a stretch, but alas, mistakes where made there. 
---
i do believe we don't disagree on the most part and it's just my poor comunication skills, sorry for the confusion, have a nice day
---
No, what you really said is that you want people to keep being dumb so that people can Lolbomb squadrons of excavators. It's a pretty hilarious whine.
---
Honestly, a passive regen Myrm is a thing I've seen used. It has a decent capless tank and can be fit with good damage due to not using a lot of the low slots for tank. It's useful for mission or site running, but that's about it.
---
&gt;PVP is basic as shit
---
Yet you  cant fucking do it. Instead of spending more time learning how to PVP and create your own content, you decide to PVE. I play for 1-2  hours a day, tops, and havent had issues finding stuff when I wanted to. You sound like an F1 monkey who would rather PVE than create content. That doesnt make you a PVPer lol. I cant imagine anything more mind bending than being proud to be an average line member in an "empire builder" game. You're equivalent to an NPC imo.

Rote Kapelle is Recruiting
---
I took 2016-2019 off from EVE to focus on RL, happily seeing it coincided with the worse meta of this game and I am catching only the tail end of it.
---
wow what morons
---
C5-null wormholes were nerfed because for a while pl was doing enough scanning that they could get anywhere in like 10j with a subcap fleet. It was around the time they were farming brave 1.0 in catch.
---
Also there is a null-null wh that you can put a single super through
---
Same
---
I'll take, "the difference between PCU and MAU" for $500 please, Alex.
---
Show me on the doll where INIT touched you.
---
AH, so if you don't want us around that suddenly means nobody. You are good at generalising I see. However, despite that, we find enogh content to enjoy the game. People actually call us in for fights. Apparently some people like fights were something more than a few frigs die =]
---
They literally said they remove the people that login but don't pass the character select screen from DAU numbers.
---
Bye, Felicia.
---
I don't know about hundreds, but it doesn't take a lot of time to respond and I enjoy the stimulation of a good debate. Eve players are never a let down when it comes to triggering someone
---
Cool man.
---
Don't act like you actually do more than gatecamo for your own homegrown content.
---
~~oh right you also get fucked up by cone in ravens~~
---
yall offer dental?
---
Rote is so fucking dumb.
---
The fact that you still play with dolls and sexualize them says more about you than me.
---
&gt;They can’t always be online
---
I think you misunderstand the dedication of people who lead corps/alliance. If they are needed, they'll be online. Also, any smart CEO/alliance lead will pick people from different timezones for those 5 people. You can have an AUTZ guy, a RUTZ guy, a EUTZ guy, and a USTZ guy and their online times will pretty much perfectly overlap.
---
&gt;and be in every system so combat on structures are possible.
---
They are the most fun to argue with. Or maybe I just like easy wins, either way
---
Rectal
---
There are a few (maybe 20% of your responses I chuckle at and agree with), the rest come off as really pushing the grr narrative. I mean, you aren't posting to please me or anyone else. Just an observation that some of those posts come off as trolling hard even if you don't really have a strong inclination for the point.
---
Maybe you should go into a WH tbh. If you want to krab in peace, go find a WH, take a few buddies with you and carebear your heart out in relative safety (compared to nullsec).
---
I think that's a matter of perspective.
---
Yes, technically you don't, but in reality if you wanna be effective it's needed.
---
I'm fairly new, and essentially any role that is not the most mindless tackle meatshield-y of the meatshields is off limits to new people. You can specialize sure, but with so much that needs to be trained it's a real problem.
---
I don't think the Magic 14 should be free, but the SP costs need to be massively tones down. Training them all to V should take 2-3 weeks, not three months. They are the most basic skills more or less.
---
Someone is afraid of INIT and a judgey girl
---
I am not critiquing you at all. Your video was fine. I was merely observing how well it illustrates a certain aspect of the game that others might not find appealing.
---
Some are, some aren't. It depends on who I'm responding to.
---
sounds like they need nerfing again
---
Or you could just have a tengu alt sitting in deep safe uncloaked
---
I'm pretty sure this will scare most supers away
---
*too easy
---
Lol, absolutely not. You're just easily baited spergelord who tries too hard on his recruitment posts for what equates to a subpar corporation.
---
It’s kinda silly in an Orca tbqhf. If you do It I suggest base out of a capital that can do high class sites &amp; escalations. The isk makes it much more interesting. Also twice as bug SMA.
---
I think alot of isk barriers have been overcome regardless of what alliance an individual is in. Yeah it's a 50 plus day train, but proliferation is nuts. Deploying these assets should be a carefully considered option, not the default response to a random hulk tackled. I have no doubt this would still happen, but it may lead to more organic, escalated fights. Not structure bashes. 
---
With smaller outfits, they need to think a bit more, and that's going to be the case for whatever they undock to be honest. Many non large block corps have fielded minimal supercaps and been successful. Lazerhawks is a good example before they got baited which led a massive fight.
---
I don't, amount of isk destroyed as a net is pretty easy to figure out and is definitely objective.
---
Nice edit, and we've never said that. Lol. Jesus christ you're dumb.
---
So nullsec does have pvp, and solo pvp is possible in nullsec, but it’s probably not going to be easier than lowsec. About the ratting, nullsec rats are very valuable to kill, because you get a bounty for each one and a chance at good loot. To get a ship to nullsec to use for ratting I would either scan a connection through a wormhole, take your chances with gatecaps in a more quiet area, or just fly out there in something harder to catch and buy the ship there. This last one is easier to do if you know the locals, and one thing you might consider is actually joining a null sec group. They have large markets for their members, and plenty of people more than willing to help out a new player like yourself. The standard recommended corps are brave newbies, dreddit, or pandemic horde.

Me too man...  the only reason I pve at all is to pay for pvp.
---
you can do stuff at the same time as the 98% boring parts of those other things too, tbh. I play civ6 usually
---
Give neuts a sig radius modifier so that battleships can't neut out frigs in one cycle.
---
&gt;but i agree trowing SP is stupid they need to change the number of SP you gain 0-5m SP you skill 10faster , 5-15m 6x , 15-50 4x , 50-100 2x 
---
Why should you be penalized for playing the game for a long time?
---
Very, I'm doing it myself. Pathfinder is your friend, get into the habit of using it. I got wingspan to find me a hole, dropped a cheap raitaru in it (under 600m)
---
&gt; He always showed up in the ideal ship to counter our gangs
---
spais
---
I think by content he means he can’t undock his big toys and be 99% safe.
---
Also, SniggWaffe #1.
---
Please do keep arguing about the meaning and intent of the comment I made because you're obviously my brain 😉
---
I hadn't gatecamped since \~2009. SNUFF mainly drop stuff for fun. Or get fleet fights from citadels. Had been for a while now. Like, you know... the kills on your killboard you are so proud of, according to this very thread. The ganked null-krabs. The fleets with conifiers. ALl the things you partake in. Grow up and look in the mirror before judging.
---
These replies to this sub represent a cross section of CCP's new target audience....
---
excellent explaination
---
Please learn how to read. Re-read what I said. Then re-read what you wrote. Think.
---
So this month as a general escape from commitments I let my two mains go alpha and started a whole new toon.
---
I took him through the NPE, did the carrier agents and am letting some skills train before I do the SOE arc, as I see a lot of folks having trouble with the NPC at the end.
---
Training at the beginning is SLOW, and using probes and the hacking mini game is not explained well.
---
NOTHING, about the overview, or probe scanner is expressed well, it didn’t even go over dscan, or the HS weapon/action safety.
---
The 10k sp allowed me to get a triston’s drones out to finish a mission.
---
10 or 50k sp really doesn’t matter a lot to me, my main is 35m so, and my alt is approaching the alpha limit after being trained up for PI and being a ok Astero scout (scanning, and m14 skills).
---
This is a good thing for new players, this is not for established people.
---
Wait are we still pretending like goons don't make up a decent portion of the r/eve population?
---
Is this 2015?
---
Sion?
---
Sites that have a pirate faction in the name (Sansha, Blood Raider, Angel, etc) won't have rats. If there isn't a faction in the name there will most likely be very powerful rats
---
I doubt thats the whole picture.
---
&gt;6 omega alts
---
&gt;pvp
---
The first thing that comes to mind is excavator booshing, where you take several command destroyers and push excavator drones of their rorquals far enough to where you can ECM the drones and steal them, and at almost a bil a pop, you stand to gain a lot, but it’s very risky. u/olmeca_gold would be the man to ask about that
---
Aside from that, cloaky alts with a blops to gank stuff would be dope, if you get friends (or become a god at multi boxing) you could kill barges, rattles, maybe even carriers if you find a real retard
---
Can't wait for the new resource depletion system!
---
Right now, I am getting back into eve, so I'm doing pve in lowsec to get back used to playing. It gets me money, but also gives me opportunities for emergant content (lost 4 Tengus already, and actually got jumped by an intercepter and a tengu yesterday, but got my tengus out) so I get more used to the stresses of solo/small gang pvp before I switch over to just hunting folks.
---
How much panic has happened in those situations is crazy. I've burnt out guns from not paying attention, and not switched missile computer scripts fast enough.
---
It's fun, but damn my heart gets going.
---
Go back to WoW cupcake, we won't miss you.
---
So sandbox is no more.
---
Just sit cloaked on grid in the same fleet and collect half the bounty
---
Nahh, I just think it is hilarious when Rote Kapel tries to sound relevant.
---
&gt; 25% lower mining yield and ~losing rigged rorq hulls is free~
---
The spodbrain is strong in this one.
---
Is it isk possitive? Burning the heavy fuel for siege and mining with these drones?
---
Why is there a half dressed thot obstructing my view of the hel?
---
Any thought of game balance aside:
---
Micro jump relay drone - Sentry type drone behavior, when connected to ship in space overrides the default behavior of the mjd and brings you back to the drone, irrespective of distance when the mjd is activated. (can balance m3/bandwidth to possibly avoid command dessies using this if desired). Restricted to one connected at a time.
---
Attack battleships - either with capital guns (no HAW's) or a spinal mount micro-lance dd restricted to firing in a narrow cone in front of the ship.
---
T3 battleship - No idea for these, design wise. I just like the idea that the subsystems would have to be baked in on construction. Going with a theme of decreasing flexibility as t3 size increases.
---
ho yes, I know it is, but from what I observe, hsec miners are not in that mindset. Those I bother actually took 2 days to even try with only one ship :D
---
unironically, get good
---
What the heck is up with the shakes?
---
I've played high reaction shooters and got into some crazy moments where the adrenaline hits and it's not the same as Eve.
---
I think it's because of the possible loss of your ship, and when the adrenaline hit comes you still need to be calm and watch all the data coming at you and make logical choices
---
Vs getting hyper-reactive trying to jump around and shoot someone, and that is like a "physical" outlet to the stress, and more inline with what the brain expects to do with the boost?
---
&gt;Halves their income
---
If that is how he wanted to play his game i understand why he leaves. If pve is your main drive in EVE i would say you are pretty fucked, i know alot of ppl say ohh it's so much better now you can earn so much more isk :) i have done a little ratting the last few days, you have absolutly no say in if you wanna get attacked no EVE feature can make it so you have a chance to avoid getting attacked, i would say if you do ratting you should see yourself as an NPC.
---
Nerf in the form of a stealth bomber run?
---
Not too sure. Corp was playing around with golem fits today.
---
For god sake can you just die?
---
I guess like 10km diameter? Nothing too big or it becomes overpowered.
---
You dont need VMs, isolated virtual environments like sandboxie work better for less overhead.
---
Are you gay?
---
So like, it is true for a certain minority of players.
---
What I thought was really funny though was the majority of the smelly neckbeards were only from 2-3 alliances and they were always hanging out together.
---
Yep for sure. This is my roaming fit, so I will often go from hole to low sec, or null, camp belt or some other site, piss off if locals bug me. 
---
Back in hole, go camp some relics... pretty boring but it’s what I enjoy. So I like the fit to be comfortable in low or null, hence web and point instead of double scram. 
---
Of course I could use smaller boosters and a mobile depot...
---
I was thinking you could contract someone to take your clone/fitted ship somewhere. Kind of like courier contracts, or you could just hitch a ride across the galaxy and sit back and have a beer.
---
Typhoon is the poor mans Rattlesnake
---
Nah, we were all solid.
---
He used neutral alts to scout our comp, we knew when he'd be hunting us because 1 certain noob corp alt would always show up about 15-20 mins before he did.
---
Only time he wasn't fitted for our comp is when we managed to ambush him when he was pouncing on a gang from a friendly corp.
---
Only time we ever managed to kill him too. Thankfully he wasn't interested in blapping their tackle because he knew he was gonna win that fight, so he couldn't moonwalk off when we landed on grid.
---
no, this would still work technically. the mjd decloaks you.
---
If you are talking about getting your dred skills to V and complaining about diminishing returns from injectors, you have totally lost touch with what Eve is like for new players.
---
I like the anonymity thanks tho
---
I'm glad you think they are great recruiting ads. Jealousy shows a bit, you could work on that.
---
Damn, you must be making good money if losing 4 T3 cruisers isn't discouraging you.
---
What he really said:
---
&gt; How the fuck does he know I'm so salty!
---
People seem to be missing this part. There is no limit, you can just make more and more to offset any income deficit. The only thing blackout really did to botting is create more bots but now in HS where they will most likely never get reported or killed.
---
Sorry but your combat probes wont stop my titan from ratting.
---
We keep hearing the same stuff. Are we mayhaps part of the same internet?
---
\*laughs in dual scram Maulus Navy Issue\*
---
Yeah, but I think spawn rates are higher in NPC regions.
---
The answer is no. Report and move on. Nothing we do against bots will have any real effect and it seems nothing CCP can do either. Its simply whackamole.
---
I mean, an armor tank would give you way more milage, though.
---
Oh yes I often brandish combats in covops, plus you can scan down abandoned geckos and other shit, and if you cycle them while doing a site, recons can't sneak up on you.
---
You don't even have to do it on an alt. Just warp to a safe and drop probes
---
Wait... You can lower CPU usage with ISBoxer? :o So I could technically quintuple-box on my 6-year old laptop? :o
---
I love how that both helps with staging for pilots and offers a significant logistics target to protect or destroy for allies and enemies.
---
Might be a 400I.Q. bait that our tiny brains can’t comprehend the irony in it.
---
This isn’t an airport, you don’t need to announce your departure.
---
Wait, thats a 100m/h?
---
Uhm. The T3chans are like 8 years old at this point.
---
Everyone else seems to be pretty ok with this tbh...
---
Actually I'm not in favor on the current meta. I'm just not in favor of the "let's shit on everything players built and dismantle it, that way they will play more", which is borderline retarded.
---
There are other way to shake up the game. Bounties are ISK faucets ? Remove them. Rorquals are mining too much too safely ? Remove the Panic module and rework the ship so it is a risk to put in space and defend but actually reward player doing so (current mining capability is shit compared to it's price) and/or make it active, or remove it completely so people can stop whining about it. 
---
No incentive to have a war ? Nothing you do will ever change that, even resource scarcity won't help in a citadel timer plagued-game. Then remove at least one timer for everything but KS/Sotiyos and remove timezone tanking, remove medium cits completely from the game. 
---
Supers are too powerful ? Nerf them too much against subcap and see none of them anymore. Don't nerf them too much and nothing will change. 
---
So what do ? Make dreads great again so they can kill supers and titans more easily so people stop dropping them on everything that moves : still reward organization (good luck moving a dread cache in the heart of the enemy fortress), while not adressing small gang problem much, because fuck the mentality where people think their 10 men nano gang should have a chance against an organized empire defense network. Get a dreadbomb and stop fucking with people, but that may be too much to ask, as you'd need to krab a little for that eh ?
---
I don't know man, but EVE hits hard.
---
Closest thing I've found is like pubg when you get to the final few.
---
Rorq costs maybe 1,2b to build in Delve. T1 rigs (100m), 4-5 cap mods (350m ish), regular t2 mods and drones (100m). Thats 1750m.
---
Even if its 1/3 of what you were making the price went down with the same. No difference in breakeven.
---
Anyone with a brain and the determination to carve out their space. It's literally what my group is currently trying to do.
---
Each one pays for itself in less than 2 hours.
---
Well, aside from the skill points lost...
---
Every time you take a cyno in a system you add mass. The more mass, the more chance you have to be hacked and sent to a Triglav site 1-2 jumps away where tackle npc + uncapped spooling battleships or sentries await you. Subcaps can just warp out, caps will need help to get out. 
---
Site will have a gate, so no capitals except the trapped one in there, you will need subcap support.
---
Npc will have a very bad loot.
---
Make a new concord ship, the overseer. Cov ops destroyer, 2 high, 1 med, 3 low.
---
Can use cov ops cloak and probe launcher. Can use special camera probes: cloaked probe that can be launched from cloak. You loose control of your ship and can manually pilot the probe in a radius of 500km.
---
For all the one who want to get some nice records without risking the ship!
---
Npc owned belts, can be probed or locations bought with SP. If you are not here officially, a npc fleet spawn to get you out after 5 to 20 minutes. Rare ore or resources can be mined here. Can be attack by other npc factions.
---
Move all L3 to L4 agents to npc factions citadels. You will have events going on automatically with NPC sieges, making temporary missions around that for both factions. 
---
Is that crazy enough already?
---
Because some people really have that little going for them in real life that they let a video game become very important and a very large part of their life and part of that importance includes needing/wanting to feel superior to other people and those that will never shoot back are easy and opportunistic targets for the narcissistic, yet fragile ego.
---
or at least have thermo trained
---
I don't remember if it was ISBoxer or a specific virtual machine, but there was a way to run clients that effectively didn't actually render the game. You'd have an EVE process running that was mimicking mouse/keyboard from your main, but that EVE process didn't actually like, show a game in any way. It was basically just a command line.
---
EVE: America
---
Invade regions for their sweet sweet sp0d.
---
It's all fun and games untill someone lights a cyno..
---
Lul, butthurt much?
---
I like when other people do PVE. I just don't like doing it myself. 
---
I'd rather bring nonconsentual PVP to them because I prefer blowing up blingy PVE boats than just basic T2 fit pvp ships
---
People actually came back for conflict 3 years ago. Now you need propaganda to keep them alive more than 2 weeks bashing citadels and waiting for timers to get fucked by cynojammers or blobs.
---
You have no real way to nerf the empire playstyle without nerfing everything, anoms, capitals, rorquals, etc.
---
People should stop thinking the current majority of Eve playerbase want chaos and no safety. Most of those not perma krabs just want to make isk to fuel their pvp needs without having to spent 20h on it a week
---
It's pretty great
---
i mean i can also push F2 to scram and then maybe F3 to web?  i guess you overheat as well so that is another click.  weeee, look i is elite pvper!
---
eve pvp is simple as shit.  99% of the difficulty is trying to get a fight.  and then once you do, it is push 2 or three buttons and collect your loot.
---
Ehm no because then escaping a gatecamp is impossible unless you are in an interdictor.... gate camping requires a tiny bit of skill... lets keep it like that
---
Pretty much.
---
Part of it is also that carebears tend to lobby for changes that make things safer with no effort required from them, and some of them are very vocal, so both groups get tarred with the image of a screeching minority, when most players do a bit of both and are quite reasonable.
---
Its less about PVE vs PVP, and boils down more to how safe each "side" thinks the other should be. PVE players want maximum safety, and PVP want minimum. Currently it's incredibly safe, even with blackout, but the standard of play is kind of tilted. Some believe they should be able to PVE in a near-AFK state, and rely on out of game tools to alert them and keep them safe and that's the "bar" so to speak. I'm not going to pass judgement and say PVE or PVP is right, but get fucked carebears.
---
You seem too reasonable for this subreddit, you tried PVP and just wasn't your thing really, and that's fine.
---
&gt; I'm just not in favor of the "let's shit on everything players built and dismantle it, that way they will play more", which is borderline retarded.
---
I don't know where you are getting this? We have no idea what CCP's plans are. All we know is their tone now, and that they see this current meta as counter culture to what EVE is about. I don't think there is any disputing that. Yes this is a sandbox, and yes some groups have "won" that sandbox, but this is a game and CCP is the law of the land in this sandbox and they will change it. I've had my game play style hit with a clubbed bat for years, and people wonder why so many [insert group that doesn't blob and build Empires] are happy with this change in tone.
---
&gt; There are other way to shake up the game. Bounties are ISK faucets ? Remove them. Rorquals are mining too much too safely ? Remove the Panic module and rework the ship so it is a risk to put in space and defend but actually reward player doing so (current mining capability is shit compared to it's price) and/or make it active, or remove it completely so people can stop whining about it.
---
Agreed on all parts.
---
&gt; No incentive to have a war ? Nothing you do will ever change that, even resource scarcity won't help in a citadel timer plagued-game. Then remove at least one timer for everything but KS/Sotiyos and remove timezone tanking, remove medium cits completely from the game.
---
Agree again.
---
&gt; Supers are too powerful ? Nerf them too much against subcap and see none of them anymore. Don't nerf them too much and nothing will change.
---
Agreed.
---
&gt; So what do ? Make dreads great again so they can kill supers and titans more easily so people stop dropping them on everything that moves : still reward organization (good luck moving a dread cache in the heart of the enemy fortress) while not adressing small gang problem much, because fuck the mentality where people think their 10 men nano gang should have a chance against an organized empire defense network.
---
I was in a C5 back in 2012-2014ish (roughly) and can't tell you how many times I yolo dropped my Moros on certain areas of space, sieged green and went to town on a carrier if it was caught. I didn't care if I got killed, but response times were generally slowish. Now if you catch a carrier it is instant cyno, backup arrives in 5-10 minutes through cyno via Supers/HAW Dreads and Titans with a big fuck you leave. I get it, people want to krab in peace. At the same time there is no counter play to that other than some stupid 100 man Goku fleet which shouldn't be the only answer to [insert krabbing capital here]. EVE used to be about a group of skilled pilots using that skill to overcome something that may be larger than them, whether that be destroying a capital, a larger fleet, whatever. Now you just undock your HAW dread, boson Titan, etc. and send everyone packing.
---
&gt; Get a dreadbomb and stop fucking with people, but that may be too much to ask, as you'd need to krab a little for that eh ?
---
See above, used to do that but absolutely no point in doing that anymore. If CCP wants to buff cyno inhibs, then sure I'll fucking go back to dropping a dread in nullsec to frag some people. But there's no point now. 
---
And I hope you realize small gang people PvE too. There's other ways to make ISK outside of running anoms lol.
---
Because there isn't much content at all in this game pve-wise, well, at least before abyssal stuff came out
---
What essentially pve players been doing is just going through the same thing over and over again
---
This kind of grind is the opposite of what Eve is known for, and the same reason Eve players holding such a high statue comparing to, well, let's say wow players
---
Afterall it's all about the circlejerk, also, nice bait
---
Everyone thinks their playstyle is the only way to play EVE. Fuck them. Do what you enjoy and forget about everyone else
---
I find a single faction (3 point) scram is good enough 90 percent of the time, plus the fitting room helps .
---
That makes sense. It’s a shame that people cant understand each other. Eve is not meant to be easy, so I just stick to highsec. Low risk low reward.
---
amen to that.
---
Yeah I think effort should equal reward. Doesn’t make sense to have super duper safe stuff everywhere. Ty for your input btw.
---
PvPers are like jocks, PvEers are the nerds. 
---
And with everything human (animals too tho, its  behavioural) there is always an "us and them", its basic grouping mindset. And so on.
---
Can you link KB so we can all have a proper laugh?
---
You mean when everybody is hidden in a building or snaking on the ground and you have to sit there and hope nobody randomly shoots you?
---
i like you guys, most of you that i've run into are good folk.  almost applied.  but at the end of the day, null just isn't for small groups anymore.  sure you can easily take space.  you just can't use it.  and the whole blackout thing has made it even worse.
---
This chaos meta if it comes about needs to increase the rewards in nullsec. Lower anom spawn amounts forcing people to spread out again, increase anom reward amount by a certain amount but take away bounties and make the rewards a type of tag instead. The average line member shouldn't be making less than 200-300mil/hour running anoms imo. But the safety has to be decreased to compensate for the higher ISK making.
---
The sandbox is still there, but they are wanting to create conflict and give players a reason to fight each other. Which is something that players have been asking for for a long time. 
---
Right now there's no need to fight which is one of the contributing factors to the current level of player entrenchment and stagnation.
---
&gt;1 certain noob corp alt would always show up about 15-20 mins before he did.
---
spaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiii

https://zkillboard.com/character/93736762/
---
see i'm elite!
---
am i really arguing with someone who has been gone for 18 months?
---
Bountiful is a C3 site (though you might have been in a shattered C1/C2) and it hits pretty hard, up around 600 DPS until you clear some of the rats. You can fit a Gila to do it.
---
You can get a battleship into C2 and above, but bear in mind that you're a big slow ship that can't easily get out, and you're likely to get ganked.
---
I came back for these tears, and it's been worth/10
---
Impossible to escape if you are not an interdiction nullified ship, or cloak instantly and burn out of bubbles, Or burn back to gate if your not made of paper
---
Were the unexpected bills your credit card statements after buying thousands of dollars in plex?
---
213/5000
---
I remember they did something similar many years ago  
---
with the drone zone  
---
and really that change was useless  
---
just like this change is useless

this is my favorite kill.

5 super carriers on a ratting idiot.

https://zkillboard.com/kill/67613121/
---
aka, super elite pvp!
---
how many buttons did you have to push for that?
---
Great solution, wormhole style.
---
Well said.
---
Keep going I'm close bby
---
&gt; if you don't you're going to be at an objective disadvantage versus someone who does
---
That's true of literally any skill that affects the ship you're flying. Should we all get Amarr Cruiser V and Logistics V for free because otherwise you're at an objective disadvantage when flying logi?
---
whoa ur telling me there is risk and reward dynamic in nullsec now?
---
holy fk
---
Will Sandboxie work? I'm aware people use it for security purposes. I've never actually looked in to running games with it.
---
&gt; Shield Operation V
---
Yes, because shield recharge is hilariously overpowered on ships not specifically fitted for max shield recharge.
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strength. Give it another shot champ, we'll wait.
---
Hmmm sounds like someone wants everything free like an entitled baby.... WH has less resources and no chat... STFU dude... The most valuable resource should be difficult to aquire... Go back to Empire with the other carebears
---
Daily incentives to log in are the least of BDO’s problems.
---
Yeah because both of those are boring, low income and pretty much dead ends. Come back to mining later maybe when you have a bit of an umbrella and you're mining for a purpose.
---
500k atrons are optimal
---
But more so the part when you are seeing an opponent, but have to decide whether to engage and give yourself away, to them or to others, versus staying hidden.
---
Maybe why I like Eve cloaky stuff....
---
Joke's on you, I don't dscan.
---
Also, why would someone be probing anomalies when you can already warp to them? Hello?
---
Correction: that knows how to play your part of the game.
---
That would be a MAJOR balancing factor to caps and I agree.  Great idea!
---
Well the shield regen is capless, so there's that bonus. It also has a higher EHP tank.  An armor tank would allow for more utility if you wanted to fit Nav computers or tracking links.
---
Better to stem the damage now.  Bitters are known for extracting, biomaasing and re-injecting.  They should just scrap injecting into ANY cap right now and be done with it.
---
There is no real risk from most forms of PvE, at least not from any anomaly sites or belt rats that aren't diamond rats. The only risk in this game comes from PvP.
---
Yeah, stop the injecting into ANY cap right now.  Truly a decent xhange.
---
Then you'll say Weapon upgrades and Advanced weapon upgrades should be free too and gunnery and drones and drone interfacing.
---
All these skills give more than most skills from your magic 14.
---
Makes killing the 300 incompetent titans more worthwhile
---
I do both, but lately a small group of people whom are vocal are complaining about a lack of pvp. Maybe they are just bad at it and need help? I also believe they need immediate stimulus like today's generation are widely renowned for. 
---
Best thing is they could have helped fix this by resource depletion from the beginning. Blackout is now a barrier for newer or smaller groups of players trying to get into null. More dangerous than wh space and very anti industrial. Why would a player go into null sec unless you want to roam empty space? Look at the map, there is not alot going on outside a few regions.
---
I mean, I actually fit one up just to see and it wasn't less than 2 bil. I suppose with the mineral abundance in Delve it could be cheaper. 
---
However, if the reduction in mining yield does impact the overall mineral availability, you could possibly see prices rise.  I guess we'll have to wait a while to see the overall impact.
---
No, due to the nature of how trafficking works in eve, a single system blackout means nothing
---
Injecting into T2 frigate skills is not nearly as game breaking as injecting into T2 fighters.  Can we at least agree on that?
---
I have about 3.6billion isk, and about 3 months omega time should I focus on multi character training to train a other character as well? I'm currently training skills to get an astero...  heres my current skill board https://eveskillboard.com/pilot/Rogue_Mime
---
Need more upvotes for this guy right here.
---
Personally not a fan of that style of play at all.  I hate that the 'competitive' style of gameplay favours camping and hiding instead of favouring people that enjoy going in without being certain they're going to win the engagement.  Though I do understand why people would do that, it's a safe way to play.  I just don't like safe.
---
it'd be way better for jfs tho as they can just cyno on 4-4
---
That will have little to no effect on overall intel gathering.
---
The blackout has actually pretty much stopped excavators booshing (Olmeca does mention that in one of his comments). Basically, he used to rely on AFK Rorqs to get his excavators and there are way fewer AFK Rorqs as before and most are now using T2 mining drones instead of the excavators.
---
Also, to be honest, I never really liked whaling all that much, I didn't find it too engaging.
---
The only injector I ever used was when they offered those boosters they gave you 100% of the skill points. I would never have used one otherwise.
---
Still cuts the yield.
---
Stop posting and biomass all your toons
---
Yeah I’ve had bombers bomb my T2’s out of frustration.   I imagine their hearts sinking when I instantly throw out more
---
Haha, I was in a Pubg mobile tournament in Seoul to try to win an S9, and I went hard, got 2 crates, fully kited out with ghillie and snipers, double digits kills.
---
Got beat by a guy with 1 kill...
---
Oh no we have to shoot people that fight back
---
*the horror*
---
Damn, hit the nail on the head
---
That often works out, yeah, but dual scram works on Ventures with only WCS in the lows, when a faction scram would not. I guess it depends what you encounter.
---
goon income halves, because campers with bombers are lazy to search other rorq outside Delve. wait, there are much less activity in other regions, so everyone just go to Delve :-D  
---
goons income is maybe half, but all others incomes is probably tenth :-D
---
And more rifters arrive.
---
Doubt

that is why I say semiafk! when you get sound player aggro sound, you just switched to tackled VNi and start fight align out. And even PVE VNI got some good kills, because proper piloted 100mn AB and 600dps was not easy to kill ;-)
---
It is very doable, time-consuming but doable. Having a program like tripwire/ pathfinder/ siggy really helps as you can copy all the signs and paste them in, then ignore the old/ ones you dont want to help keep your ui clear. Also helps identify what wormholes are statics. 
---
For solo, a stratios, legion, or Loki are good choices. Legion and stratios are best for most targets due to neuts. But Loki is ok, you can also meme around in an Enforcer, Proteus, or Tengu. I personally love flying Enforcers but they are far from an excellent ship compared to other options.
---
It's not about disliking PVE. It's about people who start to play the one pvp sandbox out there, while there's a zillion other non-pvp games and then go "I don't like it, this game should be PVE". 
---
a) why start playing a game you don't like the base premise of
---
b) people who DID join the game for what it is, like it and stuck around for it should somehow move aside for the folks who don't like the game? 
---
If you don't like the basic idea of EVE, and that's fine don't get me wrong, go play another game. There's so many other ones out there and so very few pvp sandboxes.
---
No, injecting cap skills is the problem we have right now.  People use PLEX to fund the money for fun time exchange.  This IS the most important thing to realize.  Any secondary use of Plex (like game time or skill injector purchases) are secondary.  Yeah, market forces and blah blah blah, BUT the value and utility of PLEX and why someone would buy it in the real world is motivated by what that Plex can buy them in the game.  Yeah, inflation makes the PLEX more valuable but it also makes every other commodity in the game more expensive too.  Any secondary use of PLEX like buying skins or giving out to Corp mates is dwafed by this.
---
with whom\*
---
people run out of ideas and things to do so they just end up trolling the pvers.
---
How are you this scared to lose a shitty dominix lmao
---
Multiboxing was banned. at least a part of it where you can lock and replicate the fire command at one time. Yep below You will see a kill male that I believe is a multi boxer that has violated the new rules. The question is will CCP ban these accounts even for 7 days and will they return the ship to the person that lost it.  https://zkillboard.com/kill/78063811/
---
Clearly ate an aspiring capital pilot. You need to wrap your head around the fact that capital pilots and capitals are ruining the PVP meta of a game. Making it a requirement for everyone to have a capital alt and fly capitals.
---
No, but we shouldn't have a set of skills that don't directly affect any one ship and which are just a speedbump for training.
---
Cool. Any rebuttal to any of the other eight skills I listed?
---
Well he's not wrong. PVP is pretty boring in this game, set your range and push F1+F2+F3 and wait for the other person to die. It's what comes before and after the PVP that is exciting.
---
Of all the games to turn to for pve..
---
Are we in the bargaining phase now?
---
Ser Twenty of House Goodmen?
---
No. Most people that do PvP also do some PvE (to fund said PvP). It's not like a hard divide between PvPers and PvE'rs. 
---
Where I think the hard divide DOES exist is a certain subset of PvE'rs that expect a safe place to do their activities. Most PvE'rs are happy that there's risk in the game - and do their best to manage those risks.
---
Also one thing to consider is that even doing PvE - you're competing with other players doing PvE because of the single market/economy. Your ore that you mine, or rat bounties you collect are in direct competition with other people's ore or isk on the markets.
---
Yes, but there is no reason end game skills should be injectable since the stated goal of injectors is to help new players.
---
Shhhh
---
Not even worth the damn bomb really. Heh.
---
Guys this is 4D chess, right?
---
I've been reading in an old forum post that Thukker missions are going to crush all your empire standings escept Minmatar, is that true? Also it says missions go to low sec a lot?
---
It was just an example... Most DST fittings include 2 warp core stabs = 4 warp core strength.
---
Some more Logi Love
---
Two things:
---
You know how Maraudars are like subcap Dreads? Gimme a T2 Battleship with a Triage for a subcap fax. 
---
A T2 Serpentis/Gila ship that has a heavy focus on drone reps with almost no bonuses to high slot reps.
---
I mean this is what happens when CCP wants to make EvE accessible to new players, breeding instant-gratification credit card warriors inhaling skill injectors.
---
People said my idea would ruin EvE. Being able to pay for skill catch-ups with PLEX proportional to the amount of time your character had gone unsubscribed (and therefore not skill training) since said character's creation. They pissed and moaned and rabbled about it. Where were they then CCP decided to implement it such that anyone could blitz into the biggest ships in EvE if they had a big enough bank account? XD
---
Happy cake day!!
---
You’re an idiot
---
If it locks in less than 2 seconds and is in range then yes
---
How so?
---
The only downside is that it never goes on sale.
---
How is giving new players a bonus the same as penalizing older players?
---
"multiboxing violation"
---
is this bait
---
Nope. https://www.twitch.tv/jason_kusion/clip/FreezingAntsyFrogPrimeMe?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time
---
I guess those few words were the most that your brain could come up with. Thanks sometime you may come up with more words.
---
It doesn't work that easily in practice.  I've been combat probed numerous times and almost never 1 shot, in many cases been able to finish an escalation later because I warped out before the hunters could pinpoint location.
---
I understand how 1 shot probing works, I have a perfect skill scanning alt with a virtue pod.  It's still quite difficult to 1 shot cruisers consistently even with good dscan triangulation.  Scannable wrecks would make stealing escalations as simple as spooking the runner with probes and then taking your time scanning the wrecks after they warp, at which point you can finish the escalation yourself or bring either a cloaky to camp the gate or a recon for the first room.
---
You’re so special
---
I completely agree.  OP is trying to suggest that exactly.  Take me for example. I have a 76 or 78 million skill points. I don't have every racial destroyer to 5 though. If I'm only training racial destroyer to 5 and not carriers 1 should I still have a skill point disadvantage and not get the full 500,000 skill points?  I think that is what OP is suggesting.
---
Not exactly a spy if it's purpose is obvious and not in any position to gain inside intel
---
It's just a scout at that point.
---
Fair enough.
---
having correct intentions but posting incorrect statistics is intellectually dishonest at worst and retarded at best
---
do you not know how replies word on this internet website
---
I think he meant input broadcasting? Still though Jason is legit.
---
Good JF is a dead JF.
---
&gt;why do people have to be this retarded
---
some of them have personal reasons to be this retarded, such as no longer being able to have 50 ratting vnis at a time
---
Well the game isn't so much about the PVP system itself as it is about the logistics behind the PVP. Securing territory, picking fights wisely, building ships etc.
---
CCP already banned him for 4 months and then reverted it after actually getting to review his case
---
he's legit.
---
It's an upside.  It's always on sale, for the exact price it's listed at now.  No tricks, no funny business, you know exactly what it costs and can be sure it won't randomly drop $20 a month after you grab it.
---
And it's an insanely fun game if you're into that style of thing.  grab the demo, maybe grab an old version (I think he said he had no issue with that, maybe in misremembering though) if you're unsure whether you'll like it.
---
Today in suggestions that help established nullblocs by hurting everyone else from being able to ever catch up to established nullblocs:
---
When many are pushed out, laughed at and mocked who will be left to shoot.   
---
Everyone is trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater and giggling about the salt and not listening to their issues.   
---
Karma is a bitch and one day the issue will be with you but tradition will be that folk laugh, mock and giggle we have even fewer players.
---
Sad.
---
I guess CCP will erase mining drone BPO's and only have them drop as 1 run BPC's from officers.
---
I dont like the daily event things.. I like logging into eve to play eve. I dont want it turned into a grind.
---
Rorquals or nyx actually
---
No that dude is just really good at multiboxing, don't carry so much loot and don't fly a jump freighter in hs. Also what were you doing with a jump freighter in uedama anyways, why didn't you just cyno to perimeter or jita? Where you really taking it through the gates?
---
I mean I don't know how you like your games but ideas like "reset the server," "delete all supers," and "revert progress people made in the past" is a good way to kill a game that's 16 years old.
---
What happens if you attack someone illegaly with citadel in hisec?
---
There are plenty of people, maybe even a majority, who do both.
---
&gt; It's always on sale
---
Good point, never thought of it that way.
---
Also, I already own the game.
---
PVP players often are elitist assholes who think their way of playing the game is the only way, BUT they are incredibly short sighted. It’s the PVE players who are the cogs in the wheels of the EVE economy who make everything happen. They do the industry that seeds markets, the logistics of transporting goods around, fueling stations, the ratting that generates the tax income for alliances for SRP and other services, and they provide most of the targets for the PVP players. They do most everything in the game to make the world turn and function.
---
I completely forgot about that. Thanks for reminding
---
If you don’t like people, why the fuck would you play an MMO?
---
That's a funny way of spelling 100%
---
Fun fact. It’s more fun to shoot at the guys that shoot back. Sometimes, it just takes poking at the carebears to actually get people to form and undock and take a fight.
---
Time to ask for a Wingspan delivery.
---
You just said you're in a large corp though not a little guy.
---
I can bomb things myself, thank you.
---
Propulsion Unified Structure Habitat -  P.U.S.H.  
---
- low slot citadel module  
---
- allowing to any structure to move like ship with rules:  
---
- - - structure shield go offline (because all structure energy is moving to propulsion)  
---
- - - structure lost all reinforce timers when this module is running  
---
- - - damage cap not apply (structure is like ship in this setting)  
---
- - - structure can be tackled like ship and when tackled module cannot be turn off  
---
- - - when module is running, structure can be destroyed - no reinforced timers, shield is off and only armor and hull left  
---
- module burned after use and can be repaired only by nanites  
---
yes it is crazy module, but can create some old style bashing things
---
So what's changed if you were fighting back?
---
Well he wants a challenge
---
He doesn't want to *lose*
---
But why is injecting a capital pilot bad?
---
For an older player sure you say "I made progress on my character slowly for 10 years new players should have to do the same" but from the perspective of a new player they'd see this change as "You will never be able to fly a capital without dedicating one to two years training that pilot." I think that would be a huge turn off for any potential new players.
---
The real problem with injectors is the way established players can flex their isk by having 20 rorquals. A player making a their first dread/carrier/super/rorqual pilot isn't a bad thing.
---
🤣
---
PVP players don't want minimum safety, they want minimum safety for the other side.
---
Everyone wants minimum safety for the other side. Are we more alike than not?!
---
Actually, yeah. The Hel looks way better than any other super.  
---
Love the colors BTW.
---
I create content, now i do not have reason undock, so nothing happen in space ;-)
---
\- Observatory for nullsec. The proprietary of the system have local, the gankers, no. 
---
\- Remove the option of the AFK Cloaky. If you are cloak need 1 minute uncloaked to target someone-open cyno. 
---
\- The cyno jumpers cant go back with another cyno in almost 1h. And +15 minutes of aggro. They need go back using the gates with the possibility of lose the full fleet when you decide to make a cyno or covert cyno attack.  
---
If the gankers want pvp. Come to do pvp. For just gank VNIs with 20B in ships better find a sense of your shitty life. I can understand maybe at the school all the other boys laugh on you and bully you and for that you try to make free your frustrations of your zero social skills. And of course your zero ability playing pvp. For if you want do pvp you don't gank/run like a chicken when you lose your absolute majority of risk zero gank. 
---
With the points 2 and 3 i'm happy. Equality of risk for the gankers and for the pve players.  But i guess they don't want that, for they know that's not is easy kill to a Rorqual-Hulks-VNIs... That can be so easy a counterattack and lose whole fleet, making REAL pvp.
---
You're misunderstanding. If you were fighting back beforehand, what has changed since blackout to make you not undock anymore?
---
Just skill into Proteus...oh wait
---
Because they’re flying sanitary napkins. Literally space tampons.
---
wingspan deliveries have had too many packages lost in delve
---
I do both. What am I?
---
not at delve prices
---
I'm a pvper, and my experience is that you want maximum safety for yourself, and minimum safety for the target. Its not as simple as the terms you stated.
---
Love this idea
---
just zoom in bro
---
This comment right here officer!
---
Nothing is ever as simple as a statement that leads off with "It boils down to." But for the sake of helping someone understand the general concepts it was good enough. Feel free to give him a master's thesis on the intricacies of player interaction and mindset in MMO space Sims I guess.
---
You are still VASTLY overestimating how hard it is to 1shot a scan. And if you aren't willing to defend the escalation you shouldn't have it anyway.
---
local blackout and VNI change. When VNI had 600-700dps, cost like 130m, then it can be in space and make same ISK with risk, that I do not see someone in intel or so and can be caught. Now you do not know anything and for same  ISK gain (1%-20m per TIK or 30-60m ISK per hour), you need 350m fit ishtar or like 600m Gila with 550dps. Both ships needed now are much more expensive and risk is much more now without local.  
---
Now undock Vexor or Myrmidon like PVE ship is just waste of time, why should I do click fest for just like 8m TIK? not worth my time
---
ur gay4jay too?
---
Then everybody switches to T1 drones.
---
Then they switch to procurers. 
---
Then ventures. 
---
Then T1 bs with meta lasers.
---
And boom. We're back to 2003. Except goons will still be mining more than everybody else.
---
not even having to bring more. the rorq drone bay is massive
---
ever heard of crop rotation?
---
I just think like him
---
I see many people with huge insecurities on their real life. They been bullied at the school or high school and now they show their frustrations killing people without any kind of possible defense like it happened to them at their real life. They are so \*\*\*\* insecure on their mind and they don't want the real risk on pvp, they want the super easy kill. 
---
And later they do that bulling comments on the forums and reddit attacking who just want disconnect from their work for few minutes-hours and want have a possibility of defense from those who want the zero risk kills.
---
I'm sure Hitler said the same thing...
---
PVP is the base premise? I don´t think so.
---
99% of the game is player generated/seeded, and that is done by PVE alone! PVP is not the core of the game!
---
PVP is a basicaly the icing on the cake which makes the game even more interesting.
---
The PVE part would work without PVP, but not the other way round.
---
It's likely if we experience the same thing maybe we are of same internet. Maybe the reports come from China internet, hmmmm
---
Not when it's incorrect. It is labeling one side as risk averse and the other as the opposite, when largely both sides are as risk averse as each other, just in different ways.
---
Not exactly, they will reform Jihad Swarm. Then they will just pop others who have mined the ice and ore like they did back then, and loot it.
---
Okay bye!
---
Imagine being this retarded.
---
Oh okay so you liked pve without risk (failing to read intel is not a risk btw) and without putting any real isk on the field.
---
&gt;How does the blackout feel for small alliances in NS?             
---
Dead silent.          
---
But big blocks will welcome new members.       
---
Thx CCP
---
Are you a solo player? That is literally the only way I can understand preferring high sec to anywhere else
---
Itis
---
I mean, it's no Nyx but its a great bit of art ♥
---
Its killing small alliances tbh. Just ask u/Savanted and u/Ohh_Yeah
---
But the D-Scan says its a Probe!
---
What happens to stuff contracted to the devs?
---
Meh I pvp a lot , but it feels now like that’s all I’m doing , since the blackout ,it’s going to get old.
---
But we will see how much pvp we can do until it gets boring again.
---
I love  the pve side of this game as well but for some reason everyone is frowning on pve ... 
---
Bah play Halo if you want true real pvp that is solely based of skills , the moment you can bring +1 in a (pvp) setting it fundamentally flawed.
---
And just a numbers game , bah , I go get real pvp on the Xbox bro , can’t wait for The new halo on Scarlet .. 
---
sure I won’t quite eve I love it to much , but I will simply just get something else from it , but true pvp skill based , Sorry that’s not eve brah.
---
Waffles has never been more devoid of content
---
We don't want a just PVE game. You have millions of PVP options. 
---
You have the wars, you have the  Faction warfare, you have the captures of the other alliances territory, you have low, WH... If you turn null to WH without the HUGE rewards of live in WH, just for make happy to the easy kill gankers... 
---
Make an equality of security vs pvp activity and all people will be happy.
---
Like i said in another thread:
---
\- No cloak afk. You need be uncloaked 1 minute before target someone (of course if he do aggro you can attack) Also you cant jump on the gates cloaked (only transport ships have the option to jump and move cloak and without any option to open cyno/covert cyno). 
---
\- Cyno/Covert Cyno jump, you need back for the gates. 30 minutes of aggro from the last aggro and you can chose between run from the counterattack, attack or disconnect. If you disconnect on aggro (combat probe and die) and if you disconnect without aggro will gain new 15 minutes of aggro when you go back. 
---
###
---
depends on the small group
---
if the small group legitimately played together on comms outside of ping warrioring they did incredibly well
---
if they're the type of group that doesn't come on comms and just rats in a single system while paying rent, those people are fodder anyway and don't particularly contribute to the environment anyway
---
Well aside from those two, you could do some multi boxing spider tanking shenanigans, there’s a guy named cloaky bastard that had a blog where he used a hunter proteus and remote rep domis (later changed to Nestors), and Bjornbee has a similar style with the new triglavian ships in his [deathly hallows series](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kBOvajYWCLU)
---
Genious.
---
Naturally, 1 Run BPC's for meta lasers, ventures and mining barges would only be sold in CONCORD LP store at the same price as green capital modules, what were you thinking?
---
When is the next Charlotte Meetup?
---
Not to mention having to move all your shit to an NPC station creates potential content for anyone who might intercept the shipment en route. And anyone who reacts to that by saying "but my shit might get blown up!" I don't know what to tell you, except to remind you that you're playing Eve.
---
&gt;Where I think the hard divide DOES exist is a certain subset of PvE'rs that expect a safe place to do their activities versus the rest of the game.
---
What about those who build a "safer" but not totally safe place?  Aka build up a region, coordinate standing defense fleets, a jump gate network and communication systems?  
---
A bloo bloo bloo I can't take my nano cruiser small gang in and get easy dank frags so CCPlease nerf!
---
Great for small alliances with half a brain. Bad for renters, bad for bots, bad for nullbears that should have never left highsec
---
We're fuckin dead mate.
---
Guess I'm the one with balls bc I've been using excavs and have not lost a single one since the  blackout started.  Lucky? Sure let's go with that. Is it stupid to risk it? Yes but 500m a piece that's 2.5b for 5 excavs and with plex to isk conversion rates for 500 plex you're looking at alittle less than 2b for $20, $25 to cover all 5 and alittle left over and if you have money to burn, fuck it. Not saying you should piss away $25 everytime your excavs blow the fuck up from a bomb but if you want to risk it, that's on you.
---
It's like picking up a handful of cheerios out of the conveyor belt at the factory and crushing them every 5 minutes and then proudly claiming you're crushing General Mills profits.
---
Increasing standings with Thukkers will slowly decrease the Empire standings but in my experience, the drop is pretty minimal. And you can always just ignore the storyline missions.
---
This is gonna get downvoted to hell but I’m gonna say it anyway.... *no matter what you think about PvP, some people don’t enjoy it.*
---
(The crowd gasps in shock)
---
If EVE is a sandbox game, there are hundreds of different career paths to take. And some of those people you refer to laughingly as “risk averse high sec carebear krabs “ *like* what they do just as much as you like blowing up other people. 
---
I’m just saying, guys. Being edgy is cool and all but don’t slip into the realm of douchebaggery.
---
Yes I'm salty about no longer being able to kill excavs in lowsec
---
That’s how I feel too. I think it would be cool to have some sort of influence over your skills. Like grinding them by flying the ships / using the guns, whatever. Gets people out and about too
---
without effort? lol 8m TIK i can get easily in hisec with same effort with fof ship &amp; 0 risk, because that I can even fly faction fitted ship.  
---
If I want get ISK with efford, i just sit into super with main and get 300m per hour under umrella, sitting in rorq or making similar ISK in hisec with burners/abyss...
---
It's almost like excavators are now some type of risk vs. reward system, wtf
---
Prediction: massive Goon locust fleets moving endlessly in a big circle around Null.
---
If you're making it difficult/impossible for pvp to occur...you're basically in the lame camp
---
As a guy who used to rat in a VNI...
---
...dude, what the heck? No-PVP zones exist. Their names are high security systems. No-PVP nullsec is a terrible idea, because people like you would use it to crash the economy.
---
Training skills just existed to train other skills faster.  They were redundant due to training implants so that's why they were removed.  Magic 14 directly impact gameplay and provide a clear difference in power between people who set aside to train them and people who didn't.  Putting everyone on the same baseline just isnt what eve is about.  We don't need to dumb this game down any more than it already is.
---
Not really a hard question. 
---
Is pve needed in eve. Yes for sure. Everyone does some form of it to fund activity.
---
The problem I feel personality is it's been abused to shit. We got bots, RMTers, runaway Plex prices, entire areas of space that are basically shut down for any sort of playstyle but pve. Instances that you can hide in. Safety umbrellas. Many other issues.
---
I think a lot of PvPers look at all this and say hey. Wait a minute. I thought eve was supposed to be about strife, fear, battle shakes, conflict. I think they blame PvErs for creating a pussified version of eve that was never supposed to exist.
---
Eve for a lot of people was this super difficult, super savage hard core game. That's how it was marketed. Now for a lot of people it's turned into Farmville online. There are a million other games that you can do that in. Don't do it to eve.
---
Keep EvE savage and dangerous. The idea of being able to lose it all on any given day is what eve makes exciting.
---
Keep farm simulator somewhere else.
---
Keep EvE dangerous!
---
