We're in a blackout. What's stopping you from killing them now? How do you know it's a bot? Most people do these thing. It's called being smart. You want free kills? Maybe you should work harder. You're pitiful.
---
&gt; CCP shares info on your loss when you die. The ownership doesnt change.
---

---
Yes, it does.
---
&gt; The sharing by CCP causes it be made public. If CCP does not share it, it cannot go anywhere.
---
Nope, if both parties involved don't share it cannot go anywhere, CCP is doing nothing beyond informing both parties of what they did.
---
&gt; After you have been killed, the info shared by CCP ends up on killboards
---
Only if one of the parties chooses to share, CCP has no involvement.
---
&gt; and the free intel problem is a fact.
---
It's not a problem and isn't free.
---
I hope you're having less rain than I had when I was there, which was all day every day.

Invest with me, I'll double it for you.
---
Alternatively you could set yourself up with a good isk-making setup, whether it's an exploration ship or a missioning ship or a mining ship or abyssal site ship or seed-money for industry jobs.
---
Create a second character and transfer him 90% of it so you only have 100Mil left and continue playing with a little bump until you figure out what you want to do with it.
---
Or give it to me, I’ll double your isk.

*"Goodbye enemy test fleet...OH NO I DD'ed THE WRONG WAY.* **FUCK.**"
---
Hek's still there.  Rens/Hek are a shadow of what they used to be.
---
It has to a significant amount of them and made it easier for you to kill them. Literally cloak over night in system or wait for them to “reset” Sabre ready... u good. At least this time you can enter local and they won’t immediately get safe. They just use eyes on gates (or pod tethered to fort)
---
Wow you're dumb. You said don't deploy what you can't defend. He is saying they probably can defend them right now, but if they were suddenly sieged by caps they couldn't defend them.
---
And that's why it would be an unfair and terrible idea.
---
I looked at them side by side already.
---
Not a SINGLE detail is the same. They just are both yellow with a forklift inspired design, as I said.
---
*Cue the Curb your Enthusiasm Music*
---
Depends on what you like to do, but can't go wrong investing it into increasing your isk/hr however you like to make money. Would go a long way toward a solid T4 abyssal setup for example if you like running those, or a good chunk of an MCT token to make a PI alt. Boosting your isk/hr capability lets you spend less time grinding :)
---
It's hindered them, sure. But botting won't be eliminated by the blackout, when many here said it would.
---
Did this once while I was in a cloaked bomber. It was lots of fu
---
How are you coping with being blocked!
---
ouk ouk f1
---
Nah we're only allowed to complain if it's caps being dropped. 
---
But you're right, caps, subcaps, it makes no difference.
---
Imo if you drop a fleet on a single ship, in a manner where that ship has absolutely no hope of survival, you have no grounds to cry when ships (be it caps or just massive numbers) that'll do the same to yours are dropped on your T3C fleet.
---
Nonsense
---
they are busy fucking yonis’ mother
---
Random security status upgrades/downgrades based on kills would be pretty realistic lorewise but also incredibly awesome.
---
well fuck. case and point :D
---
nice video john but pls join a better alliance :)
---
If someone wanted to kill them they would. Caps or no caps. Didn't we just have NPCs ready reinforcing stations in null? That was great content. Maybe this would help the station spam.
---
I never thought I´d feel sorry for high sec wardeccers, but these guys deserve all the pity they can get.

The standard people to hire for this sort of thing are P I R A T. If you hire them, you can go right ahead and fuck yourself.

Love it. The only good rorqual is a fucking dead one.

Nah you've got a good point for a cock guzzling fuckface, bad call on my end.

---
If you were a new player and didn't start it now, when would you get the opportunity? At which point you'd forever wonder what might have been.
---
Yeah but he's not as edgy
---
It's a good point regardless of my facefuckery. If you are going to try to insult (?) someone at least do it right.
---
Please post a link XD
---
Now finally someone that knows this game! I agree there would need to be some lore to justify it.
---
The bell, the shaft and the...
---
&gt;Yes, it does. You want it not too. But there is a difference.
---
It doesnt change because there is no change.
---
&gt;No it isn't, if you don't want someone sharing their exploits that's on you to stay docked and not be a willing participant.
---
Only one player having a say in how info some other player owns is a problem. Avoiding the problem doesnt fix it.
---
&gt;No, it requires a player to share that info, it's only because of a player that sharing in this fashion can take place.
---
No, because CCP has an API. Specific killmails not owned by whoever exploded you do not need to be shared by that player.
---
&gt;I know for a fact it isn't a problem and it has the restriction of requiring a ship to explode and is therefore not free. It also requires player input to see the light of day.
---
It is not a problem until it happens.
---
You haven’t been playing eve for long if a 17 bil suitcase rorq is someone’s wealth overshadowing their smarts
---
With the sheer complexity of EVE Online, I'm worried you folks at CCP are facing a task so difficult to complete that someone could truthfully state it's only a couple notches below that of Sisyphus. I don't envy you, but I hope that whatever support I and others can give makes the burden easier for you.
---
CAN EVERYONE STOP SHITTING ON OP FOR BEING A KARMA FARMING WHORE...
---
And realize that hes suggesting we light cynos... in perimeter... in highsec
---
CONCORD having to reallocate resources based on activity. This shit would be easy as fuck to explain lore wise. But coalitions  gonna cry when their shit becomes 1.0 and CONCORD moves in because too much krab.
---
Cant wait for another karma whore to post this is r/subredditdrama trying to say that Eve Online is just a bunch of racist assholes who support mass murderers
---
Or, now hear me out...
---
It was a bad idea from the beginning. Covert ops jump frieghter...  I dont remember him mentioning the covert cloak thing, I just figured he meant it can jump to covert cynos like a BLOPS can.
---
But I mean... comeon. Falcon even thinks all moon goo is available in all regions
---
Character Creation isn't normally counted in a Speedrun. Time would probably start as soon as you entered the game.
---
Why?  They're fine.
---
&gt; It doesnt change because there is no change.
---
It does because there is.
---
&gt; Only one player having a say in how info some other player owns is a problem. Avoiding the problem doesnt fix it.
---
Both players now own that info its either parties prerogative what they do with it, there is no problem to avoid.
---
&gt; No, because CCP has an API. Specific killmails not owned by whoever exploded you do not need to be shared by that player.
---
Yes they do, that player has to agree to having his information shared either by inputting it himself, submitting his API or joining a corporation that shares it's API's, at no point is information shared without an involved parties consent.
---
&gt; It is not a problem until it happens.
---
It's not a problem when it happens.

I like the idea of Jita becoming a 0.2 because suicide ganks, and some 0.0 becoming 1.0 because nothingburgers.

Make it show up on Overview/d-scan as a T1 hauler as an extra role bonus.

There was no way to just call OP out for being the shitheel he is without taking a jab at *someone*, was there?

&gt;hmm, the enemy appears to be gathered around a central point for *no particular reason*

&gt;I shall target this point and achieve victory

I studied this subject a few year ago.

Loaded up eve star system graph (excluding low, null and wh systems), and then for each star found it's distance from Jita.

When I get back home I'll try to dig up the results...

except all these kills happened in low. specifically cal/gal fw area
---
Nah. Just giving people a reason to go to low.
---
The epilogue is that Sort lost a csm seat by kicking slyce.
---
Yeah and honestly there should be a period of ‘X’ amount of days old for anything capital class. 90 feels right for a Rorqual, Supers and Titans I’m not sure the time
---
Yeah, this is pretty rediculous if you ask me.

I can't imagine how sad my life would have to be for me to have this much vitriol toward people on the internet who I've never met.

Basically there's instanced PVE you can do in relative safety that are fairly decent isk/hr but if you go higher level you are more likely to diaf. If you don't finish the site within the time limit your ship and pod insta die.

Yeah but if he got the 1b PI for lets say 20% off at 800m, he has 200m margin and depending on the volume, it may really harm his margin to pay someone else to haul it.
---
This made me laugh
---
&gt;It does because there is.
---
Its identical.
---
&gt;Both players now own that info its either parties prerogative what they do with it, there is no problem to avoid.

They can only do it because it is unrestricted which is a problem.
---
&gt;Yes they do, that player has to agree to having his information shared either by inputting it himself, submitting his API or joining a corporation that shares it's API's, at no point is information shared without an involved parties consent.

The API key is not the same as the info. The info is shared by CCP which doesnt respect the wishes of all involved players.

You probably “hunt” under those umbrellas and bitch at reddit and hoping ccp_falcon will nerf them because you want to kill things there and only there...

No offence intended. I just love the contradiction when people post saying they already left a subreddit. :D
---
Nope. But nice attempt!
---
&gt;Nope, it went from a ship to a kill report shared between 2 parties.
---
The information hasn't changed so it is identical.
---
&gt;No it isn't.

It doesn't have restrictions so it is unrestricted.
---
&gt;As it should not, one party does not get to decide what the other does with their info.
---
It is not their info and it affects the free intel problem.
---
&gt;It's not a problem when it does.
---
It's not a problem before it happens. Only after.
---
Drone Region in general benefits from distance from highsec,  meaning its more isolated. "safer".   and good for lonely ratting.  but the ratting isn't as profitable in other areas.
---
Delve is also isolated, but in a different way.  its generally nested in nullsec so you gotta travel through say fountain or other regions to get to it.      its also insanely profitable due to both its rats,  and the sheer number of moons it has. which are insane compared to most other regions.
---
Fountain used to be valuable, see technetium war. nough said.  still its generally something you want to control if you want Delve.
---
Geminate is notable for being close to Jita, and its accessibility means its good for content.  
---
last one i gonna speak on is Venal.  used to be the heart of the north.  see Empires of EVE for it.   but those are long gone days. and now NPC nullsec is rarely populated enough for notice,  though its still nice to have if you ant to put stuff in long term storage
---
Yup. Replying to you. Guess it's all over your head. That explains a lot.
---
&gt; The information hasn't changed so it is identical.
---
Yes it changed, it's clear you don't understand what the difference is between a fitting and a kill report.
---
*pats* you can do this.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah this one really bothered and bamboozled me. People always whine about CCP knowing nothing about the game but I always took it as just people whining.
---
But when I saw the “We buffed one of the most powerful medium weapon systems and left the broken one as is” change, it made me kinda sad.
---
Odd.  Usually the only ones who cry about that are the ones who.... cry about that.
---
Silly me for mistaking your snark about it as discontentment.
---
The price of hauling for a frieghter sits at around a 1m per jump for high sec. You have to do quite a bit of hauling to pay it off.

No it did change, it's clear you don't understand the difference between a fitting and a kill report.

Copyright is inherent. You don't have to actively copyright anything. You're confusing copyright with trademarks and so on.

Yeah the last time I was permanently in null I was in ISS and superfaggots weren't really  a thing.

Lol AND in Maila; I can see why you were thinking bait :D
---
A "Boson" is a conical Doomsday you can fit to Titans
---
Providence, I think is the last region where the sov holders don't shoot neutrals. At least last I checked. If you want to venture in null check with them.
---
&gt;  command Mammoths
---
elite freighter combat
---
From what I know, boson is Bosonic field generator, the aoe Doomsday of Titan. When activated it shoot a DD in a cone with the length 20km from the Titan and has 5 minutes cooldown. Boson is useless with Supercapitals but any subcapitals will die instantly
---
Blocks have access to larger areas and therefore can organize ways to rotate their krab-crops. Solo players are forced to do with what they find.
---
but I stoped caping v3 to get my pitchfork! I want bleeeeed!
---
I mean.  the reason we don’t isn’t the fact that supers exist.
---
It’s the fact that killboards do.
---
I am by no means that rich and i could pay to whelp 50 dreds at least a dozen times before insurance.  It isn’t expensive and i’m “one person”.
---
People don’t go for big fights or chaos causing escalations because they’re scared of being in the red.  And you usually have one side that turbo krabs so they can afford it and another that “hunts” that can’t.
---
Then the one that can’t afford it chooses to fight in areas that the turbo krabs are in and refuses to counter escalate being cost conscious
---
Then they blame the fact that supers exist
---
Fuck throw 15 dreads PER super, go isk even and repeat ad infinitum.  Make them REGRET using em.  15 dreads will kill most supers in 15-30 seconds tops ffs, so ou prolly will kill them before hell arrives and worst case you go down causing epic fights.
---
Eve shouldn’t be safe to hunt in... make it not safe for krabs to defend themselves too
---
Oh look, you called in your retard friends to help you. Must be your college buddies. How cute.

It's an empty gesture with no hope of impacting the situation in even the most trivial way.  The victims won't be aware of it.  It won't prevent the next batch of victims.  It won't heal a single wound, stop a single bullet, or even change a single vote.
---
It doesn't draw an iota of attention to the issue, or even the *incident*, which is already international news.

The only thing it brings attention to is *you*.

&gt; Carrier - Carriers would resume triage and would be devoted primarily to supporting fleets of dreads, titans and super carriers. Their function would be to support capital fleets, but they'd be vulnerable to sub caps. Carriers would no longer field fighters, and would no longer be able to use local reps. You'd need to deploy them in groups for them to be effective and support each other as well as an allied cap fleet.
---
Super late response, but...that sounds more like a [tender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship%27s_tender) or a [depot ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship%27s_tender) that has the ability to defend itself rather than a carrier.

What do you guys think? Tempest or Maelstrom? I haven't flown battleships yet but I really enjoy flying a Hurricane in a mix of PVE and solo PVP activities. I'd probably be looking to go the autocannon route with either a buffer or active shield tank.

Sick fights, and nice music too.

Good thing he had that small shield extender to protect him!

i will double your doubled isk. if that make sense :)
---
The game was "Machariels Online" until Injectors made it "Supers Online".  Sigh.
---
you filthy blue donut, you stage this battle, right?
---
That's more blatant not comparable to two ships being vague similar and having every detail different.
---
You're just blind fanboys.
---
The one and only :) Often imitated, never duplicated (that includes your isk)
---
Then what is the point of this post?
---
the reason is probably just oversight
---
You all acting like you've never seen the rorq bot farms in frat space.
---
A week after the ban wave of all their botters you suddenly had systems with 15 rorqs each all 7 day old characters. This is a common thing to see in their space.
---
&gt; However I recommend not joining the obvious "Brave newbies/Pandemic Horde/ Karma Fleet" who are advertized as newbrofriendly, which they are yes.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The problem of said entities is that they effectively brainwash newer players into simplified pilots who follows orders and are esentially taught not to think for themselves.
---
Have you ever spent time in these groups?

Good stuff my dude. Thanks for putting in time to make some quality pvp content.

Killboards and stats ruin FUCKING EVERYTHING. You are dead right on every point.

And trow a few pg units on the huginn while you are at it.
---
Because all they do is spam mobile depots all over jita and perimeter making my FPS drop like hell
---
You can deliver items to people in the same structure the item is in by right clicking the item while docked in the struct. Besides practical uses for shipping/courier it can be used to troll people by sending them unwanted items or somewhat more maliciously by delivering ships then blowing it up to generate a false killmail.

Nope, it's restricted to the two involved parties unless on of them choose to share it.

---
It probably has something to do with how the game "sees" structures: any kill made with a structure only shows the structure itself in the killmail and not the pilot. So I'm guessing that since the structure doesn't have a sec status, it never went "criminal" for you to shoot at it without consequence.
---
Just another example of how CCP was only (and barely) thinking about NS (if we can call Upwell Structures implementation "*thinking*") when they released them.
---
to know if people will show up, or just troll them, or maybe get a nice fleet and try to insta kill the Forty idk
---
I’m just now getting into Eve for that exact reason, I can mine while I build websites with very minimal attention. I made close to 3 mil on my very first day.
---
Bustard has massive tank as well, in line with the armor versions of dst. It excels at active tanking and typically combines very high resists with powerful local reps. My advise is to not skimp on tank and use x-type hardeners at least. Make sure your overheating skills are up to snuff and lastly, use a mwd to get into warp quickly.
---
Maybe caps in general shouldn't be something you can inject into.

When you kill someone with a structure and use fighters, the pilot controlling the structure shows up now, along with the structure, and the pilot gets final blow. If you don't use fighters, only the structure shows on the mail.
---
This change has been active for 5 or 6 months now. I was upset when it happened, since it's easy to tie characters in local to a structure now.
---
This isn’t believable, it’d affect suicide gankers and small gangs too much.
---
You forgot to say “only for pve kills” then it’d be believable
---
Nevermind these guys saying they'll double your ISK, now that you have a fund you can start doubling other people's ISK, and I can be your first customer! Here, I'll start small, I'll send you 500 mil and you can double it for me. Does that sound good?

Shh don't kill the dream.

Skill Injectors are one of the primary ways that people are farming up the isk for plexing. Skill points are the single most tangible expression of time invested in the game you can get other than setting fire to PLEX directly. Every injector that burns is invested time in the game being removed.
---
It's all relative, young Sharo.
---
Nah he was a guy in Horde who got kicked for some reason, biomassed, injected a new toon, and is in TEST as a spy trying to earn his way back into Horde.
---
That aged well
---
Why? That just means people who inject alts will cook up some alphas every day or two and let them sit.
---
Just gotta keep looking around till you find the corp for you that is active and helpful.

i saw this written by someone a while ago : how about having concord do larger payouts/hull type in hisec, lower in lowsec (but you encounter larger hulls) and have some drop system in null (but no payouts) like the blue loot is. Maybe have lowsec being a mix

He probably got stuck in the warp engines when I scooped him to cargo bay. Idk. Curse those zombies!

Lol everyone thoeryfits thise shit things on eve workshop. If you caught the last days of osmium or battleclinic you wouldve seen most fits being shat on by competent players. Zkill doesnt lie.

EVE is one of the most special virtual/gaming experiences you can find, imo. Don't worry about the state of the game, if you're having a good time just keep going and see where you end up. Curiosity often gets you killed in this game but also leads to very cool stories. If eve really is dying, get in now before it's actually dead- I'm certain you won't regret it.
---
I have only made them stronger.
---
Save us Lord Bob, take these meat sacks from us!

1 dps fit leshal (that is full entropic sinks/dda) gets up to about 2.5-3k dps. Run this against the necessary dps to mess up a sotyo

Can you escape warp scrambling by using a star gate?
---
They're all pretty homogeneous. Sansha space has better relic sites but other than that very little matters. Distance from Jita makes logistics harder but marauders are coming out of wormholes now so it really doesn't matter much.
---
What if he likes cock guzzling? What if hes a her, or a they, or an Apache attack helicopter?
---
 And what? Its argument on 6 warp stabed Nag?
---
Nobody thinks the afk stuff is always botting. Nonetheless, with more things you can do to make money while afk, the harder it is to distinguish if it is actually a bot or not. Idk where you're getting this "all afk things are botting" idea, but it is widely known that many of Eve's most lucrative pve activities can be done with very little attention to the actual game.
---
yea and from what I've heard from a few friends who try to run them when they spawn in our space, you won't even get the titan BPC if it drops as if it so much as shows up on Zkill (some random dies to the rats that camp gates and such) it will get swiped by some dude with stupid good ping and an auto loot macro before you even see the wreck appear.
---
Your name is really familiar. You ever play ARMA with a group?
---
yeah it needs a lot off work maybe something like needing to hack or salvage the wreck to get the stuff

Gnosis is a gimmick. It can fit any weapon system and any tank. So it can pretend to be any race of ship.
---
It's not an exploration ship, it's just a ship.

they booted darkness? Must be news to me  
---
RR is the #1 powerhouse of that group now

are we playing the same game?

We was in Horde space, cynos up when we first tackled

---
Nice vid!
---
I don't kink shame.
---
CAN'T GET ON KILLMAILS IN HORDE WITHOUT REPPING THE TARGET LONG ENOUGH FOR THE WHORE DRONE TO GET THERE!
---
Agreed. The Astero is only there for people who can't fly T2 Covops. It's basically the ship equivalent of a meta module.
---
Gnosis came out long before.
---
It was just a low skill BC that could do okay at pretty much anything.
---
Basically a ship a brand new player could hop in.
---
Then later the SoE ships came out, and the Sunesis as well.
---
But it's way sexier, so that is a plus.
---
And you can fight off t2 explorers in a site.
---
If you are doing straight relic/data sites then the gnosis doesn't even fit in. For relic/data its T1 Frig &lt; Astero &lt; T2 covops frig.
---
Most ships have a niche they occupy. The gnosis is a bit of an odd duck in that regard, its thing is that its a jack of all trades ship. That means in the end it's not as good as specialized ships in their niches.
---
Yes, [yes it is.](https://gfycat.com/quickhealthygoldenmantledgroundsquirrel)

&gt; ratting isn't as profitable as other areas
---
Ratting is just as profitable, get 19-22m ticks with 5 heavy drone ishtar, same as other regions. Plus, one of the sites, the patrol, has a guaranteed 3.5m drop at the start (the drone chip whatever it is called)
---
AP out here with the freshest footage since Prom and the vibes to match
---
I'LL BRING THE GALLON OF TAPIOCA PUDDING AN AIR COMPRESSOR AND A FUNNEL
---
Wow, just wow
---
tfw you inject the minimum skills to fly the hull and use the drones, but none of the skills to fit anything on the ship itself
---
Can't see anything with the super weird colour changes.
---
Maybe caps in gerneral should have never been a thing.
---
as a sov holder in provi i must disagree, ill shoot anyone ^/s
---
Including in-station. Your pod just ceases to exist.
---
Scratch out some names on the monument and you´ll get your free office tour.
---
If DeadCo booted useless weight, there wouldn't be anyone left.
---
&gt;So if that happens consistently, it must be seen as free intel. Otherwise the discussion only deals with the symptom and not the cause.
---
No, because it was never free to begin with. That intel was gained by a pilot putting their own ship at risk. What they do with it is up to them.
---
&gt;How do you earn intel by doing nothing specific to get info on modules that are destroyed?
---
TIL that killing a ship is doing nothing specific. What other oddities exist in this world beyond the looking-glass, where black is white, and victory condemned as defeat?
---
&gt;If they are destroyed, they are no longer there. From an intel standpoint, they are treated identical to non-destroyed ones. Why should you have perfect intel on those every time without doing anything?
---
Why does a ship leave a wreck when it is destroyed then, following this logic? It's no longer there, it should just disappear, right? Why should anyone know what kind of ship you were flying after it's disappeared?!
---
&gt;You get enough intel to recreate the fit.
---
Okay.
---
&gt;Enough intel for people to look it up and determine if its killable.
---
I guess killing it wasn't enough to determine this already.
---
&gt;That cannot be seen as "limited" since it doesnt impose a relevant limit.
---
No, the 'limit' I was talking about is again, the victor keeping the details of *their* ship hidden. Historically, destroyed + recovered technology from an opposing force is studied in great detail. I see no reason why it should be different here.
---
&gt;That's the real problem because the only way to restrict it AFTER the mail has been made public is for it not to contain certain info in the first place.
---
Then play better and don't lose your *Top Secret* fit. Autistically screeching about "muh privacy" when your ship is strewn about the battlefield like articles of clothing at a swinger's convention afterparty is moot.
---
So let's turn it around. Why do you feel that the person destroying your ship doesn't deserve to know what they destroyed? In this game of limited effective combinations of modules, little variation in damage output numbers, and static attributes on ships, why does it matter **so much** that your precise combination of modules remain secret to the point of dictating to the playerbase at large what they can and cannot do?
---
What has been seen cannot be unseen.
---
Are you part of NRDS? If not, then you're not part of most sov holders who are. Fact is it's the last space where that exists.
---
Probably doesn't even have jdc injected.

this was actually an idea floated

was refering more to the faction drops. but you are right.  i did forget the drone chips. those things really tend to get alot of value to them

if you're going to link shit, make sure you know what's in it....
---
1 guy dying to 30 is the fault of the 1 guy. Are you in a corp? Alliance? Do you have allies? Where are they when you're ratting by yourself? What are they doing when you're grinding solo? I'll tell you what they are doing... they're sitting in a standing fleet waiting to help each other. They're moon mining together. They're camping a gate together. They're roaming and PvPing together. Those chosing to solo rat know the risk. If you die, don't blame anyone but yourself. 
---
Seriously, if you're having problems in game PM me and I'll help you figure it out. Find something that's works for you.

---
Medium scotch does higher dps, has better tracking, and more range than medium T2 beam ammo
---
AC have to be weak because they have low fitting requirements.
---
Minmatar ships have to have double projectile bonuses because projectiles are so weak because they have low fitting requirements.
---
Because of their low fitting requirements, Minmatar ships have lower CPU/PG.
---
Artillery has largest PG requirements in the game.
---
Ignorance is Strength.

He wants the office bud, not police station.

How did the joke go CCP made themselves?

If you pay 15$ for PLEX, you can buy 300'000 ventures or something?

Step 1: Knuckle all the way

Step 2: Drop 2 dreads on a T2 fit krabbing carrier

Step 3: Warp dread back to wreck to loot T1 modules

---
I've warped *through* one of these in an interceptor. Just one.
---
I used up all of my luck for that one.
---
I started about a month and a half ago. Played nearly every day and I haven't been bored once since I started playing. I can already fly some pretty neat ships (just focus on a ship and guns you want and push toward that with your skills) and I met some amazing people who gave me money to make the ship of my dreams (only to lose it 3 days later lol). It is definitely worth your time and energy to get into the game. And look at it this way; if you don't feel like playing a certain day you lose nothing because of it because skills train based on timers that are active even when offline.
---
PRETTY ACCURATE WE'RE BASICALLY CANCER IN PEOPLE FORM
---
And.... it's another game... unless you own the trademark etc not much you can do..
---
DUDE NICE
---
Thank you for this comment. Saved my wasting my time watching it myself.
---
Fuck off nidia
---
If you aren't equipped to handle a hot drop, maybe you should fly a cheaper office? Or at least put more stand ups on it
---
what a horrible video
---
This reasoning is why/how i started playing in the first place, so far so good :)
---
Set aside around 750m for market hauling. Buy a cheap freighter, don't spend more than like 20m on it. Never spend more than 50% of your slush fund on materials. Haul low weight but decent profit items between rens, hek and jita.
---
There are websites that can help you find things to haul both ways. Any profit should be split in half to slush fund and spendable fun money.
---
Are you high?
---
Nope. That is the truth.
---
I always knew Tech was valuable, but I never knew why. Part of what spurred this question actually, as I'm working on a Stellaris mod set in Null Sec, but my knowledge of the industrial value of regions, or the industrial side of the game in general, has always been.... shit.
---
All I remember really from my time in EVE was that the North had "really good moons" (I don't even know what that entails), and that the Drones apparently had shitty rats
---
Here's my suggestion: get yourself into a t3 cruiser, any one that you can fly will do. Make sure you can do at least 550 dps or so and are cap stable with your tank and an afterburner running. Then go through low populated lowsec regions and probe  for 6/10 DED sites. If you do the blood raider one for example you will get anything from 60mil to 2.5billion isk in a site. 
---
Make sure you can warp cloaked and keep an eye on local while running sites.  The t3 cruiser shouldn't cost you more than 600mil, you do not need to pimp fit it. 6/10's are pretty easy. 
---
You only need 1 or 2 of these sites to pay off nicely to start becoming space rich.
---
And escalation blitzing with the hierarchy sites and sentient spawns is really easy in drone lands.
---
A tengu, some time and a little bit luck and you get 1b with some more action than just ratting... and if you are really lucky you get more money out of it than 23/7 ratting
---
Hi i'd like some boneless wings

Yes
---
Provi FC for this op here. 
---
There was a KBP TCU sov timer which was considered a full CTA at basically the same time. That's what we were formed for. I wanted to take out a bunch of harbingers and brawl you all to death, but we saw RC (the ones who would contest the timer)  were formed and ready to go for it.
---
Not wanting to waste time during the node game getting dropped on by RC while brawling you we decided to go with muninns so if RC came we would be ready for them well.
---
Turns out they did come, those were the rattlesnakes &amp; basilisks. We killed 2 basilisks and an arazu after a bubble caught a part of their fleet.
---
Was a fun time for us. We purposefully left Princess Abbie for last.

Has nothing to do with caps , injectors were the a mistake .. the numbers for supers/titans/rorquals/caps would be prob. Only 1/10 if people had actually trained them .. so stop complaining about caps
---
Don't to this - they've posted they no longer accept the public - I think its planned for like 2020 after a move or something
---
I don't know this for a fact, but I think there are much, much larger farms.  The margin isn't really there on sp farms anymore.
---
Can i have your stuff then?
---
They hold YWS0 as their capital, the system nobody ever uses (including them). Because the capital mechanics make sense.
---
Why you see the result? guy basically only injected sitting in the hull and the excavs based on that fit he was probably better off injecting a hulk isk/h wise.
---
Well, I don't know what anyone would do with a bumping titan in null sec.
---
RMT.... :D
---
Check your killmail and the transaction name in your wallet you can tell if it's the same guy. What ship did you lose?

RMT over a bil that's like less than 10$

Think of all the space work that goes into it not to mention the IT work to have a working SSO system with various levels of access to different VoIP services forums custom tools it's insane what EVE organisations do. It often outdoes small to medium businesses IT infrastructure.
---
small AC buffs for sure... not sure how you'll do it... but tech 1/navy AC platforms need love. they're pretty awful
---
I endorse this public service announcement.
---
Its a feature.
---
You repeated yourself 3 times. You said the same thing 4 times. Do you always repeat yourself 3 times? How do you live repeating himself 3 times? 
---
Artillery doesn't have the highest pg requirements to balance damage. Only one of the Rupture has low fitting space and a double bonus. 
---
On paper, medium pulse lasers are better because of they have better damage farther into their fall of. Jin'Tan did a video on youtube about it.
---
Because gatekeeping is cool when you can already fly everything.
---
Nice one Hilmar.

Roaming around in small gang fleets is some of the best times I've had in Albion.

That’s called Elite Drone AI. Moreover sentinel boss has a chance to spawn Drone chips for trading to get Astero/Stratios/Nestor, I’ve heard that they can spawn Sentinel Damage Control that has 500m isk price but never see them.
---
Rogue drone DED (Outgrown 10/10 spawn from squad/patrol/horde) quarantee ~200m loot from boxes, and an extra 150-250m from loots of Sentinel boss and Kuari boss
---
Rattlesnake and Leshak do ded better, and also drone data site has a chance to give you data escalation, which contain augmeted bpc and (I heard but never see) excavated mining drone bpc
---
I still don't see why these are exclusive.  ESI is already an asynchronous info source.  Local was instant.  There's really no need to delay esi for more than a few minutes.

I made a trip to high sec via jump clone and still had the local chat from nullsec showing up all the time, switching with the current local chat. Was nice. :D
---
So what happens when an explo site despawns in a wormhole? Where does it go?
---
You get that PvP isnt everything right? Your entire assumption is that nothing else in the game is content and nothing makes the universe vibrant outside of PvP. Thats a massive assumption, but it does explain a lot actually.
---
So risk mitigation is not a discussion of risk? Its in the fking phrase dude. 
---
You yourself explain how your risk is connected to your income, its the cost of doing business in your line of work. Yet you refuse others the same option. People paying taxes is the cost of doing business, and risk or whatever you call it wont change that the cost of doing business in NS is higher than yours.
---
But heres the kicker. People expecting to have lower risk as attackers when they go into unfriendly territory than the defenders. Now thats a thing I dont understand. You can, with your numbers, make more than people in Delve yet you want more risk/lesser profits for the other side. Now thats fking hilarious.

How much is a bil worth in irl money anyway?

Less than 10 dollars if you buy PLEX from CCP even less than that in RMT because their whole deal is it's cheaper than buying from CCP because you risk an account ban.

Waited 15 years to install eve and the final straw was the ad last summer for solo pve. As a carebear at heart I can honestly say pve is the least rewarding activity in eve.

Solo, small gang, roams, large fleets and massive pvp tidi slugfests are all in their own ways infinitely more rewarding.

There are still some days I like to solonuke an ice belt in a couple hours, but more often than not I'd rather sit in a standing fleet and focus on admin shit than even do that.

For next time: set up a push to talk for your recording software so we don't have to hear you moan into your doritos. It's just not what i needed to hear on a tuesday morning, and my day has gotten objectively worse because of it.
---
Then actually cut all the useless shit and just keep the actual gank as footage. The video was 15mins long, when at most it should have been 1min. It's not like you need to stretch it out to 10mins for monetization.
---
And then actually find some more interesting footage. I guess this was your first dread drop, so i understand the sentimental value. But watching someone click f1 to delete a random carrier just isn't that exciting unless you actually provide some background.
---
I tried doing RMT back in 2008 and got a warning. Never again.
---
I mean I could be wrong but last time I checked beams were just irrelevant over pulses. Since you have given no evidence to the contrary I will take it you are just being an ass.

Yet another quality Big Bill the Boss post!

Pros: Only people around for content are a newbro corp, so potentially easy killmails.

Cons: I'm in that corp and I'd get a stern talking-to if I tried anything.

Join Se7erence instead. Just my humble opinion.

Bump other titans out of keepstar tether

Idk, only injected a dread alt and a super alt before

A slight buff perhaps, but I would be really careful to overbuff them.

yeah cos he's totally only been playing eve for 8 days, does not have a bunch of other omega pilots and deff does not have any omega's he could have extracted all those skills from, yep deff an 8 day old baby eve player paying his way into a huge ship he's clearly got no clue how to use..

So what? Just check where it died. A blingy t3 that got droped to shit by avatar could have perfectly viable fit. The fact that it died is completely irrelevant.

🤔

I have one of them in my corp. Dude spent 600 USD to get a rorqual skilled up because he wanted it.

It went past regions, we were seeing people in the region out of our Nulsec static in our wormhole.

:D i know i see the irony :P but i propably didnt post for months here. thinking that i usually hung out half my day on here id say this was definitly considered leaving :D
---
And if we could merge prints with the same ME/TE. That would clear up so much clutter...
---
And then you stifle most of the content that drives people today. It removes options for third-partying or at the least reduces it. No, I think killmails and dotlan are fine because it is, by definition, delayed by a bit compared to local.
---
Space has grown and people have consolidated more. It is very common for us to do 50 jumps and maybe see one viable target to shoot because space is empty. You're simply trying your damnest to reduce content even more.
---
Imagine yourself ability to merge the BPC.
---
Oh no, you told me to get fucked and called me a nerd, on the internet no less.  My feelings are so hurt.  Now you can soak up my salty tears.  Congratulations I quit, you are clearly better than I could ever be.
---
Exactly, turn 2 x 10 run BPCs with the same ME/TE into 1 x 20 run BPC.  Would make T2 invention much less of an inventory eyesore.
---
That's what confused me the most. He had his apostle there, presumably repping the Hel, then proceeds to lance both.
---
I guess he's pretty new to the whole supercap thing and just got super nervous, messed things up. We all get the eve jitters. :)
---
Wtf you talkin about? I thought the rucus about "free intel" has been about zkill and dotlan showing real time eve-wide data about figts, ratting and mining pockets, ganks and gatecamps. Not about garpa or pathfinder. Local scanners wont even work now with blackout.
---
I do think there is need for public esi about kills, rats, mining stats to atleast be delayed for like 8-24 hours. Imo delaying market esi for 20-30 minutes to enable fighting automation and competition against people relying on 3rd party software to update their 500 orders as fast as the market ui lets them (thats me).
---
So you are asking to buff HAW auto-cannons.       
---
Ok
---
Nah i just take random fleet warps in alliance staging...
---
Honestly the first idea is what’s up, Eve is a game of desires that rarely pay off. Best to know your worth before squandering it in this kind of environment.
---
Never not get warped in your dank vanq!
---
Nop, never :)
---
Sooo are you saying afk mining should be bannable offence? You deserve the presidency!
---
That Paladin was fit by the Anti Christ
---
ye lances don't actually do that much dps, active tank caps can mostly deal with them
---
Bare minimum to use excavators, panic and shield buffer tank is approx. 14mil SP, this with jump drive operation to 1, no JDC and most of the fit having to be T1/meta/faction.
---
Can someone explain to me in simpme words what just happened?
---
Small shield extender...
---
Oh okay. So we're totally glossing over RSI literally stealing EVE artwork and copy-pasting it into their own, but the Venture having its entire design copy-pasted onto the Vulture isn't comparable?
---
Christ the doublespeak with you Star Citizen cultists is unreal. 
---
Guess I should have opened my comment with the mandatory "hey guys, love the game, spent £150,000 on internet spaceships, but..." that every single post on r/StarCitizen has to have just so all your fragile egos aren't damaged.
---
That is literally sad...

Well, it would be under the DMCA which is partied into many international agreements.

Also, all alliance logos are copyrighted by CCP when not otherwise officially copyrighted by the alliance in question.

I didn't tell squizz what to do. I gave an opinion &amp; shared my view. Learn to fucking read, or get your FC to explain it to you.
---
Dumbs from PH dropped a titan to save dumb B from PH and killed him instead.
---
The titan jumped in to help the tackled super carrier  instead he basically killed him.
---
To be fair. The lance was presta accurate, wrong target tho
---
Nice fucking job mr horde acatar
---
Aren't you supposed to draw a bee on it if you do anything at all?
---
Correct me if I am wrong, bots do not normally attack the bombers?
---
Yeah. When I looked at the E-Uni war report and saw that we were camping them in Jita, I couldn't help but laugh at the whole situation.
---
Dropping caps on a capsules and gatecamipng 15v1 in homesystem is that what called dignity or?.. I mean when I joined eve it was clearly said that there is no such thing like fair pvp here, like in wow or smth, where you have nothing to lose.
---
It sounds like you are in the eve equivalent of a local small business. Nice people to be with, comfortable place to be but no career progression beyond "do the same stuff everyday".
---
You have two options:
---
a) go corporate and join Goons, Horde, Test etc, Avail yourself of the support that provides, which will likely be free ships, structured support. You will have to accept that you might be one of the faceless many but with a number of good friends you kick about with , (same faces on standing fleets, same people in local - you will end up with friends eventually)
---
b) go "startup", join a small corp with real ambition - Wormholes is good. accept it's going to be tough and you will have to step up to the plate at times. Build up your skills both character sheet and eve experience wise.

That's week isn't it?

Come on scientist guy. I am beginning to think you are a bot yourself. You would not even be able to pass the turing test in this state.

What many miss here is that killmarks do not have color 😉

A decently skilled rorqual with ship and fit costs approx 30b.

From the looks of it, he dropped the Apostle with the Avatar (which is a smart thing to do actually)
---
**Compounding &amp; patience is hands down the easiest hands-off method (imo).** 
---
I've been playing on &amp; off pretty much since the game came out. I started off mining, then got into T2 production and moon mining and even made decent isk with PVP. But NOTHING beats hands off station trading!
---
Step 1: Look up the most popular (read: stuff that will remain popular...so keep an eye on patch notes!) modules/ships including some popular faction items. Note down major swing lows.
---
Step 2: Whenever something hits or gets close to those major swing lows, you buy in bulk at major hubs. You can max your profits with buy orders, but sometimes you can just grab stuff off market at sell prices if it's really at a good swing low.
---
Step 3: Patience...lots and lots of patience. You do NOTHING after buying and just sit on it until prices recover from that swing low. This might happen in a week, or a month, or 6 months...but eventually, prices will recover from swing lows. You want to trade stuff that has large swings in price.
---
Step 4: Sell once stuff is back at swing highs or above.
---
If you do that and constantly compound winnings, you'll be a multi-billionaire after just a few weeks/months with very little time commitment. This is a long term approach allowing you to enjoy the game without having to grind massively. You never have to haul anything this way.
---
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, trade different stuff to spread risk.

Dirty Lies, BLACKOUT FIXED BOTING ISSUE. THOSE ARE NORMAL PLAYERS, human beings or AI adapting to game.

they are apparently +10 with the icelandic police departement.
---
Yeah. Listening to Kyle Saltz's guest lecture with E-Uni (ProviBloc seemed like an interesting place to go after the Uni, so I checked out what he had to say), I have to wonder what they were thinking with the war declaration.
---
Does Spectre really have as much of a problem with ProviBloc spies awoxing the FC as he suggested, though? Because a lot of what he had to say seemed like propaganda even by NullBloc standards.
---
Would gladly take a hit to AC fittings in order for them to not suck so much.

You are wrong, auto aggro drones will hit back when you shoot them.

Oh you mean the one that can't even do 400 dps so you need a metric fuckload of them? Tbh if you don't notice 40-60 catalysts waiting for you on the next gate with your scout then you deserve it.
---
Or just delet
---
Syndicate is amazing, its just quite because people don't realize how great it is for people trying out nullsec without having to worry about sov.

It's a charged Albatross.

What's left behind after the ship goes down.
---
Well it is r/eve
---
&gt; you have never flown a cynabal
---
I have, and it's great. A/C still sucks on most other hulls.
---
Good shit AP
---
Used to, but now I just use Mogul to set price alerts.
---
Pick popular modules/ships, note down swing lows, buy at those swing lows in bulk, sit on stuff until price is back at or above swing highs, sell again. Just requires patience. No hauling required. Compounding is a beautiful thing.
---
Yea, they had a massive problem with that during this campaign. I personally had neutral alts in almost all of their anti-Provi fleets, and I wasn't the only one.
---
They are a public NPSI group, so getting neutral alts into their fleets and on their comms takes no effort whatsoever.  Which makes perfect sense for their normal NPSI roaming thing, but is a fairly critical vulnerability if you are planing to wage null-sec wars.
---
My experience has been almost identical, even though I went a different route to you. I had just one day after about 3 weeks where I got bored and realised that I had min/maxed what I was doing as much as interested me, so decided to go learn something else.
---
Do you put medium A/C on your HAW?
---
Haven't had a ticket sit for more than a week personally, most issues I've had were solved within 24 hours or so. Hope this is encouraging.
---
Copyright is automatic and belongs to the author / artist unless there are contract terms and it was done on paid time. If they are not in the USA, they get parts of copyright anyways.
---
Makes sense.
---
Goons and their blacklist are a bit of a meme, but it doesn't take much thought to figure out why it exists.
---
copyright applies anyways, regardless of it being or not being a corporation. trademarks only apply if registered and to areas registered in.
---
Use it to make even more!
---
&gt;What do you need to file? Do you not get automatic copyright on your works in the US?
---
AFIK soon as you create it you own the intellectual copy rights,  but goto court you have file the design and have it accepted

So far, we have had 15% sales happen roughly once a month. There's probably going to be bigger sales around November-December, there were some up to 50% off.

3 days is my personal worst response time usually 24 ish hrs

Providence pro : has also a named null sec system (nobody knows the name)
---
Providence cons: roleplayers
---
Find an incursions community. You should be able to fit one of their affordable fits for less than a billion. Then you can make half a billion in a few hours if they are banging out the sites.
---
They only said that because all the waves where perfectly synced with each other, sliding from f1 to f8 then on next char would stagger the waves.
---
Only ticket I opened was less than 24 hours I think
---
Your corp should be able to show you and help you make isk, without handouts.
---
This is not an offer to switch corps, but have you asked them how? If its not a great answer hit me up and i can identify some ways in whatever area you are in.
---
It's odd but whats the actual harm? Just more killmails to be had.
---
Hardcore mode.
---
Imagine yourself HAW gun made from 600x 200mm auto cannon
---
Why, do you fit medium ACs to your mach?
---
Olmeca Gold is that you? xD
---
Should be plenty of resources online for c3 fits. I'd start with a myrm or domi, much cheaper especially after insurance.
---
Lets go this rabbit hole.            
---
When i can i start listing BPC on the market }:&gt;
---
It’s been a blast! I’ve prepped for rain and have yet to get it during the day while I’m out. I’ve been doing the ring road so there’s still a chance with the days I have left
---
They were nerfed for a reason
---
I agree. It seems like it would be an easy thing to implement.
---
I suppose you need to consider that it was coded as Create, Read, and Delete, but with no Update capability. So to put that in you need to:
---
•Modify the database table with Update/Edit column (or enable it)
---
•Add an Update/Edit button on the Contract window user interface
---
•Bind the UI button to a stored procedure which modifies the database table entry
---
•Add validation to allow/prevent the contract from being updated depending on what state the contract is in (Created, Oustanding, In Progress, Finished).
---
That estimation is only based on what I can see on screen.
---
For our development team that would be 1 or 2 days work to build and bug test. Plus another 2 days to Test/QA. Add 1 day for post test bug fix contingency. All in all 1 weeks work roughly.
---
Doesn’t sound much, but for such a small change it’s time taken away from bigger priorities.
---
Lol go home ass fuckers
---
yup dont doubt there are people with way more money than sense who come to the game and ask what the best ship is and then just buy into it, but the number of them I think is probably super tiny in proportion to the number of people who do it that have played for years, or extract skills from another character to make a more focused toon.
---
You’re getting downvoted for not only being correct but for have better knowledge than 90% of the people here.
---
Why do I say this? Because 90% of the people that play eve are bad and have no clue about why x should be buffed or why x should be nerfed.
---
Well, he didnt miss
---
You are loosing your time, they are legions, the only way to stop them is to turn off Eve Online forever.
---
I have everything up and running, but am trying to get the cron job for updating everything working as well and can't get it to work. Have you tried that?
---
Use survey scanner?
---
Survey scanner.
---
Stain,
---
Pro: has not got a lowsec gate as entry
---
Con: Has not YET got a lowsec gate as entry
---
right im planning to start with the myrm, 
---
would u know the meaning of dps for the sites here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#
---
does that mean i need to be able to tank that much dps and be able to deal enough damage to kill the enemy sleepers before they can kill me?
---
There's a module for that. Survey Scanner.
---
Thing with what you said about the ticket being prioritised is that different staff work in different support departments. GMs that’re focused on reimbursing your ship after a server crash or something are not necessarily authorised to look at and interpret financial or technical issues with payments. That’s probably why your ticket is taking longer than a simple gameplay related issue.
---
i live in a shitplace with no option for regular internet, so i have to hotspot my pc from my phone, meaning i dont get static ip address, so i have to use VPN every time i play or i get disconnected, so i must have changed hundreds of ip addresses and never had the problem that happened to you... tbh you scared me a little
---
then for every buff AC's get (not that i think they need one) the cynabal, and a few other hulls would need nerfing to truely 'balance' the changes.
---
hurricane with AC's for example is pretty shit, but stabber it fills its role just fine.
---
rupture is a GREAT solo pvp hull with AC's with enough tracking range and damage to marvel those blaster boats.
---
im not completely sure i follow where the medium AC's lack.... which hull are you guys experiancing this on?
---
You actually have two tickets that are still showing in our system as open from 2017.
---
Both have been answered, both issues have been resolved and both have timed out and been archived.
---
Whatever the fuck that was, you win and now I can't sleep.
---
Hey dude,
---
Not sure about the specifics of your case, but if your account has been locked down for security reasons, it can take some time to get to the front of the queue as our security team deal with a shitload of ticket traffic relating to compromised accounts.
---
Sorry for the delay, the guys will be with you as soon as they can :)

Do you have a Texas Lawyer?

Right now though, we're closed to the public for tours as we're preparing to move to a new building this winter and there's random construction and repair work happening in various areas around our current offices.

We'll be re-opening for tours in 2020 once we're settled into the office.
---
It's perfectly fine for you to come up to reception on the fourth floor though, and take a photo there if you want to.

I'm in the office all this week, so more than happy to come say hi, grab a coffee and shoot the shit for a little while!
---
Yeah, people don't fuck with the old Lögreglan arround here.
---
Pirat are good dudes tbh, i have spoken to Lord Alarik a few times, and have experienced thier morals and values.
---
man do these guys value honor, and trust and respect more than anyone would really appreciate.
---
if you pay these dudes for something, they WILL deliver or die trying. they dont back stab, they just do business. what side of the business you are is your bad.
---
i also love you ivy league guys, all just as great for many different reasons, ive had my fair share of fighting you guys, talking to.
---
i've lived all over, from my experience  
---
North - a bit hard to live in atm, under heavy attack if you're in panfam, although a lot of the land is "uninhabited" atm, so they may be advantages there, on the other hand if you like content you will love it, if you start in some newbie corp like horde there is a lot of room for advancement, some good FC's up there  
---
Sansha Controlled space (south east) - TEST and Brave Space, as well as their allies, by far the best for exploration, also a capable umbrella to protect you if you're super ratting, second power on the server, also in war atm so some nice content there  
---
East - Chinese lands, under attack by test, i dont know much about it so ill leave this to someone else who lived there  
---
West - Fountain and other regions, under initiative control. fun region, excellent moons and ice, saftey is inferior to delve but its still ok, if you're a member of imperium and can use jump bridges life gets a lot easier, money making here is much easier them some of the other lands  
---
South (Delve) - Goon lands, if you wanna make isk this is where you wanna be, i made 50b in a few months and i wasnt trying that hard, also if you can manage the first few months you will be able to join some really fun sigs and squads, while its true that there are a lot of more PVE oriented players there, goons are so big that some players are truly great and an opportunity to learn from them  
---
also, if you manage to die in delve in a cap, it means you did something really bad, because  once you click that cyno button shits about to pop
---
-1 ISK sent!
---
While I agree with everyone who says that there already is a module to check the amount left in the roids, I don't think having a way to tell the percentage of the roid being left would hurt anyone.
---
Most people do no fit a survey scanner anyway, unless you *really* wanna max out those mining cylces.
---
I've used one of those before but it only tells you what type they are which is no better than the overview.
---
That's another shield mod slot taken up by a low need module. Would be neat to watch the rock get smaller
---
"It seems" is never a good way to measure the time it takes to alter code, especially if we are talking about ancient CCP code.
---
On a different note: Corp and Alliance changes when?
---
fucking LOL
---
Well previously the rocks just disappeared. Now they kind of vaporize at the end which is cool.
---
The people saying make a bank character with 900m of it are correct if 1 billion is a lot of isk to you then don't risk a lot of isk without doing some random suggestion listed here. These people are right you can get into some bigger ships with it and make more money but the main thing to focus on is have fun and learn the game.
---
I might be mistaken but you won't lose Sec. Status when attacking structures, however you are still getting yellow flashy, as you are in LowSec attacking something you officially are not allowed to attack (until it's a war target structure)
---
Or we could just use the astroid "shield/armor/structure" as measurement
---
Correct which is neat in itself. I rarely use the survey scanner so it would be cool to watch the rock diminish
---
That could work.
---
I know this is a completely different game, but Rust actually implemented a similar concept with the rocks in Legacy. It was changed from simply disappearing to diminishing in about 3-4 stages.
---

One would think the ad for a non-existent product would be a bit of a clue.

My bad. It's a bug report that had Open status for stupid amount of time and now has Attached status. Bug still isn't fixed tho.
---
Hey Falcon. Thanks for the answer. I hope you guys could speed things up for this case as it affects all 5 of my accounts. Also as i am missing out on loads of sp and well unfortunately my last holdiday week as i have to work to keep paying 😂 
---
Also some automated message that it is being investogated or even taken care of would be a good start.
---
Or even better if a ban occurs the account e-mail will recive a notification of it and steps how to get forward. Not all know (like me) what i should be even doing to get unbanned. So i filed tickets on all accounts and am baffled that not a single respond came through expecy for the one that it has been recived. 
---
So how about a GM contacts me and starts to work with me to clarify this and were all good and can end this on a highnote.
---

Judging by this sub, he didn't have to ask anyone. He figured it out by all the rorqual qq.

Better yet, make an alt and station-trade in Jita with 900m on that account. You can make a profit with minimal trading skills, and eventually will make enough money to sustain your main.
---
The first ticket I created 5 months ago regarding an exploit received a (generic copy-paste) answer within 27 minutes. The second I created last Sunday at 00:53 is still waiting for an answer. Personally I think an answer within 7 days is ok, so I'm still patiently waiting.

Doesn't matter your intention, if you can 0.01 by changing it, why change it?

I agree, that would be awesome. So it will likely never happen.

It was at 20% shield before he lanced it they could easily have saved it in the time it would have taken us to burn through that nc. Jumped in about 60 seconds after it died.

I swear if one more person tells me to use the survey scanner I'm gonna lose it.
---
But asteroids don't have shields?
---
spotted the guy who has no clue about mechanics !!
---
Yeah, bug reports and tickets are two very different things - if you have an EBR that's still open, then afaik it's still being worked on :)
---
This doesn't look like a bot though. I surely hope someone into botting fits rorq somewhat decently.
---
You mean, as in game mechanincs helping bots to kill players? What a game dawg!
---
Shintaht :)
---
I second that as ex—7- they are amazing guys. CVA are douches
---
Sorry man, there's not a great deal we can do to speed things up - you're currently in a specific queue with other people who're experiencing the same problem.
---
Hey you should use a survey scanner.
---
I'm pretty lucky with tickets so far. I got one done in less than 8hr.
---
+1 on that.
---
Sev3rance has a bunch of nice dudes and honorable fighters.

CVA gets worse the higher up you look.

They don't have many opportunities to, everyone and their mother is always desperate to bring content to them.

You’re probably right but REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Always that guy to come here and tell you how to do it 'better'
---
Just call guys from playing Fortnite and say let's do some admin stuff
---
Don't bother trying to get one.
---
Have you considered the survey scanner
---
Come on. The MER shows how rare loss in highsec, including suicide ganking really is. Almost nothing is lost there - like a fraction of a percent of what is moved around. 
---
I get that new players are likely disproportionately represented in that tiny figure, but the solution isn't just to make highsec even safer for the veterans there to suck up all the resources. Better to teach new players about loss, and make sure they can afford losses, than to bubble wrap them away from the core game. 
---
As Hilmar said, Eve needs to be easier for new players and harder for veterans. Making highsec safer is counterproductive to both of these - new players will find it even harder to compete highly skilled, multiboxing veterans if you give these established players more safety.
---
no it doesn't...
---
brawly rupture is fine, skirmish brawler scythe fleet is fine, brawly hurricane is fine(a bit low stat compared to the other battlecruiser brawlers, but that's more a consequence of not having a monopoly over the medium neut over other battlecruisers that most cruiser ac platforms have), AC cynabal is fine.  Stabber is admittedly weak for higher sp pvp, though I think that's more a consequence of it's t1 crusier stats.  It's very strong as a newbro ramboat.
---
Like I'm not sure what people want out of medium ACs?  Maybe the ability for cynabals to delete light tackle out to 50+km without actually having to fit ranged weapons?  To which I'd say no ty.
---
If someone quits because they got suicide ganked, is that really the type of motherfucker we need to stick around in EVE?
---
I consider it the barrier to entry.
---
Wouldn't have time for it with the one I already have.
---
Autism hurts
---
Because it's a contract. You edit it by deleting it and making a new one.
---
Have you considered a survey scanner? Some ships even get bonuses for them
---
Your personal intention may not be to .01isk but giving the ability to do so will result in it being the norm
---
Should be working as expected following downtime today
---
Yeah and I'm sure every Tom, Dick, and Harry in front of you wants them to speed theirs up too. Wait your turn.
---
Let us know your hisec alts names so we can take care of your problems :D
---
As a former spectre fc, I approve.
---
I have the same type of ticket (account security compromised) sitting with support for four weeks now with absolutely zero reply, despite four follow up emails from me. Tells you a lot about how CCP treats their customers
---
So something that you can do to make a bit of money pretty reliably is run abyssals. Even with complete newb skills you can hop into a caracal or a kestrel if you have some other corp members who do them and make a good 10 mill an hr running t1 darks, and it only goes up from there. I'd reccomend reading some guides and watching some videos and you should be on your way to making a little bit of cash.
---
It's not really a problem so much as it is a good way to filter out people who shouldn't be playing EVE in the first place. New Eden is a harsh place, people should learn that as soon as possible.       
---
Also, link lossmail.
---
Could this be a disguised "no local bad" post?
---
PVE is in dire need of being nerfed. Why do people think it's okay to generate billions of ISK and get richer exponentially with even more PVE accounts for free? After all, one can buy PLEX to stay subbed and money is no issue at all after the generations of more and more ISK...
---
Everyone not doing this is a sucker and pays for eve with RL currency.
---
I did this for a year, maybe longer in the past and I've stopped. Not because of the nerfs or changes, because it's silly. It ruines the game.
---
I'm looking forward for "man, T2 rigs are soooo expensive" and "leave your 6 billion ISK Damnation docked, we go with Hurricanes and T1 or meta guns, as everything else is too expensive.
---
This probably won't come soon and the large null blocks are least affected, but for everyone else... fun times ahead.
---
Maybe they could make Auto Surey Scanner for lazy people.

I have never gotten suicide ganked, I don't know anyone who have gotten suicide ganked nor have i ever actually heard about a new player getting suicide ganked. Suicide ganking is not a problem for the game

Ahh thanks, I would not have ever known that

No alliance upkeep =&gt; alliane will not protect you for a long time, same as sov. You will looze sov fast. 
---
I know why you are thinking that, and it's the root of a lot of missunderstanding in eve. It's not beacause renter paid you and you are in 100% alliance pvp you're group don't have all other shit. You just externalise it to renter. but basically renter are line member of some pvp corp. They can said no, it's the truth without they're money they will do nothing.
---
You need to difference suicide ganking and piracy.          
---
**Suicide ganking**         
---
* they will kill you just because they can, even if this cost them more than you lose           
---
* this is is not motivated by anything                
---
**Piracy**            
---
Reason to kill you is motivated by the :             
---
* Value of the killmail            
---
* Potential drop ^(people forget that modules also drop)

* Standings ^(you carry nothing but you are enemy)

Because a contract needs to be set in stone. What if I look at a contract, and while I'm doing that, the guy changes a small but crucial detail, that would be an open door for endless scams and I think Eve has just the right amount of those at the moment. The solution to this problem would be to warn the buyer that something has changed, but then you put the inconvenience on the buyer instead of the seller.
---
Really, the biggest requirement that I've experienced is that if the corp is doing an op at the moment and that you go online, you're expected to join the op and not going out krabbing or solo pvping.
---
Naw, it's a stick with wingy bits
---
I thought this was a "sandbox" experience. Why are you the one who considers who can enter and who can not?
---
We're looking into reports of issues right now, keep an eye on [EVE Status](www.twitter.com/eve_Status) for more details.
---
Its not negative its the way it is, if you were listing ships in staging would you not check yours are the cheapest so they sell?
---
Just because what new players lose is worthless ISK wise to you, it does not mean it is worthless to them. Even a million ISK is considered too much for a new player.   
---
And how is making suciede ganking harder is gonna make the new players find it even harder to complete with veterans exactly?
---
Nah dude, the hamster protocol has been expanded from server maintenance to other departments as well. The hamsters (both of them) are working overtime as is. 10k hamster wheel turns = 1 resolved case. Remember, they gotta sleep and eat too 😉
---
Working as intended. Thanks CCP, it took a while but we finally removed the burden of local for the benefit of all.
---
Jokes on you, they're on the Imperium Payroll
---
A fight you probably don't even have time to activate your modules in, where the outcome is pre-determined by the time the first shot is fired, is good strategy, but poor gameplay. 
---
People learn toughness over time. If you consider it a good thing they're gone at the first struggle, then they will never have the opportunity to become the toughest motherfucker to ever lock their scanners on you.
---
Can you clarify what’s the wait type for the longest types of tickets? I’ve submitted one 5 minutes after you booted me from my account, and I’ve been waiting for almost a month now, without any reply.
---
I said I like the blackout, did you even read?  
---
How is a new player making few millions an hour with a T1 mining ship affect the economy? 1000s of these players and it only makes 1bil of ISK generated additionally which is close to what a veteran can make nowadays. Not even a drop in an ocean.
---
If someone cant take losing a "hard earned" venture, they probably weren't going to keep playing once their battleship gets ganked either. Or they get kicked from a corp/alliance for being risk adverse. Or if they get kicked out of sov. Or if they lose their moon mining athanor. Or if they get scammed in Jita or lose their shit in a wormhole or accidentally jump their Iteron into lowsec.
---
I understand what your saying, relative to other games eve does not protect its newbros well. But Eve doesn't protect its veterans well either. Actually, it's not even lack of protection, it's a fundamental game mechanic of Eve online that all assets are at some level of risk when in use, and if that lesson is learned in a Venture, its not being learned in a Rorqual or battleship or a hulk. 
---
&gt;This kind of sadistic, screw-thy-neighbor behavior is considered the norm in EVE Online...
---
So my message to the writer of this review is: dont play it if you cant handle it. This anarchistic nature is what eve is, it's what makes eve unique compaired with every other game where the dev's handhold and protect you to an unreasonable degree. He wants bans for suicide ganking? He thinks it's not right that you need "just a little game knowledge and intelligence" to avoid deaths especially in highsec? 
---
Man what the fuck kinda thin skinned generation was I born into?
---
Sure, ok, but than don't post "EVE IS DYING, ACTIVE PLAYER NUMBERS ARE DROPPING etc etc"
---
I mean the easiest way to "fix" this is to just remove the runs all together. One BPC can be run once and is consumed as part of the production (instead of loosing a "charge").
---
BPC with similar ME and TE can stack.
---
Would make it way easier for T2, eaiser for people selling and buying BPC via contracts and easier for an already unwieldy inventory management system (dont know about you, but my hangars are all littered with cargo crates and hangar crates for sorting)
---
Some bittervet, I'm sure, would be happy to point out how this would be gamebreaking, but I for one can't really see the downside.
---
the only kind of posts I make friendo
---
Skynet - Welcome to Cyberdine Systems
---
Ganking is healthy for the economy. Barges exploding are being replaced. Why not put some on the market?  
---
Take a look sometime at the kills gankers get. You will notice a pattern of ships that don't fit rigs, little to no tank, and/or are often in systems with lower security status for high-sec. The belief that ganking is too easy is ignorant of game mechanics. Utilize game mechanics to your advantage instead of the ganker. Also, don't distinguish yourself by smack talking and providing salt as this is more of a prize than the kill mail to the gankers. When you are reviewing the kills gankers get, you'll see pods killed too. This is a sure sign of afk mining and not much sympathy from me.
---
So a system can be made to protect the newbie, not the veteran. Maybe a fine for suicide ganking, inversely proportional to a ships estimated worth? Higher the worth, smaller the fine.
---
I like how I'm getting downvoted b/c people are unironically white knighting you and wooshing on the posting.
---
Username checks out.
---
Ccp says fix should be applied now FYI
---
Chat is looking fine after downtime - we'll keep an eye on things and if there's any further issues we'll let you guys know what's up.
---
Survey scanner
---
This is just the fucking worst possible take 
---
What kind of autistic dumbfucks want LESS people to shoot at?
---
Why exactly do you want Eve to be like "any other game". It clearly isn't.
---
Who are you to decide who should play and who should not. It is a sandbox is it not? CCP and anyone with a sane mind wants more people to play the game since we are losing more and more players each year, don't they?   
---
Oh how would you have liked to see a lossmail to make it easier for your conscience.
---
"according to the spreadsheet you are having fun"
---
Can we have each ship show content of cargo hold so we don't need to fit a scanner to pick gank targets?
---
I'm only 23, but looking at modern gaming I can't help but feel old. What the everloving fuck happened to gaming? Why is everyone whining at the most minor inconvenience and overdramatizing every minor setback? I was scammed some 8 years ago for all of my virtual assets, was upset for a week or something, then went back to normal. No ragequit, no whining/bad reviews and shit. Where did all these crybabies sprout from?
---
The main appeal of EVE, and one of its core design philosophies, is that it is difficult and unforgiving. If a player is unwilling to handle that then they should not play the game, simple as that. There are plenty of other good MMOs out there, EVE should not cater to the whims of every single person out there.
---
It's test, the chinamans lightweight bot has a higher iq
---
All data CCP has shown us so far indicates that players who get suicide ganked as a newbie are *more* likely, not less, to stick around long term.
---
There have been numerous changes already to make suicide ganking harder. If anything, we need to take a few steps back and make it easier again.
---
You're like 10 ply toilet paper
---
If a person likes to high sec mine and not want to PvP, is he not up to your standards to play the game? What kind of thick headed attitude is that? Only your play style is worthy now?   
---
A venture might be valuable to a newbie, once has has 100m he can safely fly a cruiser. It is all about progress. You annoy a person before he commits and he won't ever come back.
---
I currently have a ticket waiting with CCP for 4 weeks, so it depends on the type of ticket I presume.
---
You didnt read his post and just waited for your turn to post again, didn't you?
---
So basically going back to the old days of telling everyone to HTFU? I can get behind this.
---
&gt;New Eden is a harsh place, people should learn that as soon as possible.  
---
This is the correct answer to this post honestly.
---
Well yes, eve *is* nullsec. Just about all media publicity around eve is related to plays made by the big nullsec players. Nobody started playing Eve because they heard about veldspar mining in hisec
---
I mean it really isn't hard to put 6 alts into myrmidons and warp them to anoms. Additionally if *they are actually botting* then that's some shit level income stream.
---
You clearly didn't pay attention in school. You have rights that are protected in this fair and equal world. Everyone's a winner today! 
---
Lol...

Look at all these cucks who don't undock

what do u mean? the last post there was August the 2nd

Didn't they added some effect on the asteroid recently? Like you'll notice the texture will change before it pops.
---
Woah, vni used to get 90m an hour max with perfect skills and a blinged fit, normally just under 60. But otherwise solid post, incursions can always use more people and are more fun and social than ratting away in some random nullsec corp.
---
&gt; they are legions
---
What about if we cast them out into a herd of swine?
---
Cost of oppurtunity mate. Nowadays there are tons of other options. You don't like a game, you can move on to the next. Same could not have been said 16 years ago. If Eve wants to survive, it needs to adapt just like everyone else.
---
The issue isn’t suicide ganking.
---
The issue is it’s prevelance against newer players.  When i was new a decade ago i could fly a faction fit battleship and didn’t have to worry.  
---
I mined in hisec and the suicide gankers forced my to procurers but they were RARE.
---
Nowadays you have people with a literally infinite supply of isk ships and accounts when it comes to needs to suicide gank.... and new players conversely have FAR less safe environments to catch up and farm up with.
---
It’s easy to be a edgelord bittervet and show how cool you are by insulting everyone with a problem.... but that won’t retain new players.  Eve has adapted to favor grief style play and that destroys the new player experience because let’s face it, it’s easier to grief noobs than to do any real damage to anyone with resources already.  
---
And there’s no counter to that.  At all.  You destroy a new pilot who is mining for 5mil/hour and they think “why the fuck would i buy plex just to compete?” when challenged with that or grinding another 20 hours to get back their 100mil ship.
---
Hate me.  Hate mining.  Hate bots, the chinese, pve, goons, test, whatever you want to hate.  But if you want this game to survive we need to have a more accessible entrance for new players that isn’t just to be fodder for people who can’t shoot better targets
---
Grats on undocking and doing a thing in this space video game about exploding other peoples space ships!
---
Move out of your mom's basement. Your incessant whining is disruptive upstairs in the bedroom. Every night I hear about how she should have aborted.
---
Someone’s upset about PVE changes, damn This Is Definitely Why EVE Is Dying
---
Coincidently i think it has been working as “expected” by general opinion for the past month
---
I mean, I don't know what else you would do
---
You get a free venture for doing the starter missions.
---
What a horrible comment
---
Harrumph, harrumph
---
I think the problem more lies in how the game presents itself to a completely new player. The sentiments expressed in that review are common. New players do perceive being ganked in a non pvp ship in highsec as grieving. But that's because the initial presentation doesn't communicate enough the intended gameplay. Maybe highsec as a concept just isn't working out that well and could need a rethink.
---
As a side note, the argument you hear even here on this sub about how pvers are the lifeblood and if they're gone the moronic leet pvpers wouldn't know what to do with themselves, really illustrates the issues I think. These people genuinely don't get what the game has to offer and truly believe pvpers are just dumb grievers who don't know any other game mechanics or how to produce stuff themselves.
---
Many newbros think CONCORD will save them from the ganker, instead they see their ship die despite CONCORD blowing up the ganker ship. "Don't fly what you can afford to lose" is the only answer they receive from the playerbase , except that it doesn't mean a thing for a newbro travelling trough HS thinking there an actual police system protecting him. How could he lose his cargo in this High security area under CONCORD protection, right?
---
My two cents : CCP should communicate more on dangers that a newbro can face in HS and how CONCORD is there to punish crimes, not prevent them. Maybe add a tutorial chapter about it? Or a popup when first getting into a transport ship? I don't know really. But i'm pretty sure that knowing the dangers of HS (wardecs/ganking/scamming) before getting blown up would generate less frustration from those players and maybe keep them on the game.
---
Ok, then substitute it with a few million worth of mining barge. Happy now?
---
... You do realize that this guy was mining in MAILA, with NO FIT, there were around 5 other random people in Local, and he ignored my hecate sitting on him killing his excavators for a good minute or two until he even started aligning out.  
---
That guy had 0, and I repeat, 0 idea what he was doing. Guaranteed.
---
I am not, otherwise I would have just told you to remove high sec ganking all together. I am just saying that new players need a easing in period.
---
He blocked us when we started trying to talk to him :(
---
I'm okay with making highsec safer. But it has to come at the cost of making it proportionately worthless to vets. No more orcas, no ice belts, no moon mining, lowest level combat sites only, no incursions. Basically anything that allows these carebear bitter cunts to hide in highsec indefinitely should be removed from highsec and pushed into low. This would revive lowsec and force players to move out of highsec after a certain time. If the only people in highsec are newbros just learning the game we'd probably see a huge decline in ganking and such activities as it just wouldn't be worth it. Sure their would still be freighter going out to null and they will be targets but those arent flown by newbros and so it wouldn't hurt player retention that bad. 
---
On the note of removing orcas from high I believe rorqs and supers, fax, and titans should be removed from low.
---
Did you even read that MER???? The Forge is something like top 2 destroyed value EVERY month
---
If you haven't tried them do not jump straight into high tiers. Work your way up from t1, because you will lose some ships learning it. Just throwing some ideas out though because you told us nothing about what you do in game.
---
Enlighten me then, because I see nothing of value there. He claims that my suggestion would make a new player find it even harder to complete the veterans.
---
You didn't answer my question.
---
&gt;A chance of someone destroying all my progress without any reason does not sound that fun either.
---
I guess killing PVErs in nullsec is off limit then too
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203209712-Rookie-Griefing "Players are advised to reconsider any aggressive action against new players in the following systems" 
---
eve do have a soft rule about griefing but only for the starting systems and the lvl1 arc, ofc you need to kill alot of noobs before ccp even thinks about doing anything
---
i feel ganking is okey as long as you dont keep targeting the same noob all the time
---
It can still be difficult and unforgiving but progressivly. You don't need to grief a person right off the start. Eventually he will learn when he loses a shuttle while carrying an expensive module. No need to annoy him when he is mining in a procurer just for lols.
---
Goonswarm? How about you join someone who's relevant
---
What a fantastic idea. I say we take it the full way, and just have players sign a waiver authorizing them to be killed.
---
Could you point to me to said data then?
---
Bruh, you must be some kind of stupid.
---
Right now, said idiot quits when he gets suicide ganked. This ain't the game for him. He's too pussy for this.
---
With the proposed changes, no one will shoot him. The guy keeps playing.
---
THAT'S STILL ZERO PEOPLE TO SHOOT AT.
---
The best way to ensure that new players continue playing is getting them out of hisec as quickly as possible. There is no meaningful content in hisec

I may or may not be enjoys gate camping lxq ;)

What’s the question star shine

jklasdfh  jdsakljf;dslkhf halskdf;j! HRRRRN

I can develop the idea of the thread: make new players learn that they will lose something. For example, I'm tutorial we can give them something new player can consider as a good item and destroy it in now battle in some interesting story starting with npc words "we all will probably lose our ****, but it is worth it" so people can learn that everything your earn will probably get destroyed. 
---
About suicide ganking: we can probably help ccp with a npc scenario of such events with tips of how to about such fate. It can be made through new chapter of tutorial with a cool rewards in the end, and the best reward for the new players will be experience.
---
Blops\* That was a blops dread.
---
&gt;You don't need to grief a person right off the start.
---
I'm quite confident in saying this almost never happens. Ganking is banned in starter systems, after all.        
---
&gt;Eventually he will learn when he loses a shuttle while carrying an expensive module.
---
The extreme specificity of your statements really only further convinces me that there's a lossmail behind all of this.
---
Moving out would help me and your mom, but who's complaining?
---
Thanks, I'm fucking not and I've never said that.
---
It is usually cost vs value.

Like if it cost you 10milion to kill a 400mil ship with a potential 300mil drop ... is this is profitable or not?       
---
Like it is potentially 290mil tick.
---
Btw, have you tried using a different browser? Happened to me some time ago as well.
---
Eve is a SANDBOX. It has high, low, null and wormhole space. Even abyssal space nowadays. This kind of fanaticism is just bad, for you and for the game as well. There many people who started Eve because it was simply sci-fi themed. They imagined being a miner, or an industrialist, or simply a space trucker.
---
Wooo!
---
Look it up yourself, I'm on the toilet taking a poop.
---
The only thing that would make this video better would be if there was a split screen of me bangin Glock's mom so the nerd's in this comment section can actually see what sex looks like when it doesn't involve your left hand and a magic marker
---
Eh, at least make it harder for alphas to do so and/or the loss of security standing mean more
---
Didn't we establish throughout all of 2018 that it doesn't work properly in this new setup? Stop using Blackout as camouflage to sneak it in again.
---
So no more multiple run invention? Or multiple run building from a bpc.. this is like the worst idea
---
Or a suicide ganker
---
Leaving gotg has been the best move for slyce it has revived a dieing alliance and growing bigger by the day
---
That's not what he said at all.
---
He said if the player can't handle losing the venture and goes on a crybaby rant like the one you showed, then he has no place in EVE. Not wanting to PVP is one thing, knowing how to avoid it is the other. One is an attitude, and one is a skill. 
---
HTFU
---
Six months into permaban and yet to receive a response.
---
Less than a week after talking to a CCPer at Fanfest: ban lifted.
---
Why leave when the content keeps coming to you?
---
Fact that you're crying about this means ur bad git gud u big baddie
---
Thank you!
---
Add me the and runs to a bpc and stack the ones that are exactly the same.
---
Also it was only recently that bpcs and bpos were different shades of blue, imagine the days when they looked exactly the same...
---
And in turn made an alliance revive it's self and use the same coalition as content how's gotgs roqs and supers going lately :)
---
Why are you trying to "force" anything. If more people does high sec mining, it becomes to worth less. It is player driven economy mate. You can't force people to your liking, you should know that. If few people like low sec, you can't blame players for that. If a person likes to mine in high sec, it is his decision and you have no right to force a change on him.
---
But you are on reddit....
---
https://www.thealphasguide.com
---
"1552 hours on record.  Thumbs down!"
---
That's not really a review, that's someone being so salty about something that happened to them in-game that they're trying to damage the game itself.
---
Thxs :)
---
A testament to this player base that you don't realize you're the stupid one.
---
People can move out of higsec.  Everyone was a noob at some point.  People stay and learn new things when they have fun.
---
Do yourself a favor and stop posting.
---
You simply need 1 copy for 1 run
---
Actually there are a lot of ways of helping newbros: newbros insurance
---
Like much better rates of insurance on ships, modules and loot in it, with near 100% money coverage for t1 frigs/mining frigs/ destroyers, t1 modules and loot that is worth less then 20 mil.
---
If player carry more than that BIG RED LETTERS "YOU WILL NOT HAVE COMPENSATION FIR THIS LOOT, DO YOU WISH TO GO THERE ANYWAY?"
---
How about the about 100million fine you pay whenever CONCORD blows up your tornado?
---
Expedited ticket response requires pearl purchase
---
Nah, they have the opportunity. They just don't take advantage of it. EVE is so blatant about you dying that they've put it into the tutorial.
---
Actually no. 
---
CCP slightly modify the supplied logo and they claim that one for ise and distribution in the game. 
---
The original logo is still in ownership on the Alliance that supplied it. Its a legal Cover Your Ass on CCP's side to ensure no issues with copyright issues etc.
---
I see you might be new to EVE, welcome.
---
gank a noob in one of those system and you will get a convo by a GM on the same day if you're online, and if you don't respond, get a week ban or something.
---
Not cooldowns. Fatigue. Pumping multiple injectors at once could be possible (say skilling into a new race of ships to fit a new doctrine)but the drawback would be reducing the amount you could gain long term from injecting. Not sure quite where the line should be drawn.
---
You claimed it, you prove it. I claimed how new players are quiting because of this griefing mechanic and my post proves so, by showing the MOST HELPFUL REVIEW IN LAST 30 DAYS on steam, backed by comments and ups.  
---
Your move.
---
So when I wanna run 10 runs of invention 1 run after the other I'd need to keep logging in and putting new jobs in, instead of sticking in a 10run bpc and leaving it
---
You cannot seriously be equating a scripted loss of little value with a player-driven suicide gank.
---
Tho that wouldn't be effective in contracts. You're not forced to buy from the cheapest seller like on market.
---
Yes.       
---
1. Setup 2FA for your email account and ingame client.       
---
2. Make account using buddy link - 750.000 to 1.000.000 extra SP if you do it this way.            
---
3. Create 3-4 alt accounts using your own buddy link (yes you have more than 1) and start training them in engineering.    
---
Don't use the extra SP yet.            
---
When you going to need an alt - you will have something already trained.
---
If they want an easy time of things, they should stay in the starter systems. Undocking elsewhere is consent.
---
How do you know the said players will not move to low sec or null or wormhole space once he earns some tens of millions from high sec mining and become a pvper down the road? You lose the player before he is even able to try the most of the game and for what purpose? To satisfy your own ego by annoying a noob?
---
No it just cost 10 BPC at the same time for 10 runs
---
Maybe as part of NPE concord contacts the player to explain how the popo work in new eden
---
Day one : all of low/null dies
---
Day two : the only industry pilots are now in highsec
---
New era of chaos successfully implemented
---
The person who quits because they got ganked isn't moving out of fucking HS. 
---
jfc
---
you're fucken ten ply, bud.
---
Starter systems end with tutorials, which does not teach anything other then locking, orbiting and shooting. You can spend months in high sec while mining and reading up on the game at the same time.
---
throw your computer out of a 10 story building now
---
"Here's your five, give me back my two tens!"
---
You should edit the last sentence to say: If I want to survive in Eve, I need to adapt like everyone else.  
---
Use the bad experience to educate yourself on trying a different approach in game to achieve your goals. The depth of the challenge in this competitive sandbox is the appeal. Figure it out or don't. Hint: you are not the only one who has been ganked and many of those have grown past it.
---
These systems exist, they're called starter systems. There's no need for fines.

---
If it is gonna cost you 500m to kill a miner with 10m ship, how many would do it? Numbers can be adjusted, need only a proper system to protect the newbies, not the veterans.
---
Thanks for this OP &lt;3 
---
I was just thinking my fries weren't salty enough
---
Because nullsec is safer right?  Then the new changes push that more out the window
---
People get ridiculously mad at this but it’s a real problem.  Whether they like it or not, downvote and cry and screech their rees “htfu”... it isn’t going to end well
---
Except, you agree to go to a "lawless" space when you go to null, and expect to die any second. Concord is suppose to protect you in "high security" space, yet all it does is maybe avenge you? Not even that because the attacker already accepted on losing his ship and is prepared for it. The victim, not so much.
---
Player in a 500mil mining ship is not a newbie.            
---
You need a lot of skills to fly this 500mil ship same for knowledge why to fly this 500mil ship.         
---
Lets get some things straight - newbies are using ventures.
---
I mean. If you're gonna spend rl money anyway. Buy plex to buy skill injectors to get there faster.
---
Yep, "a while". Almost 5 months without any answer.

FTFY
---
Who even heard about a sci-fi space mmo and thought to himself without know anything about the game, " I want to be a suicide ganker and annoy people because Condord fails to protect them anyway."
---
I don't have numbers on that.  It won't directly answer your question, but I would suggest taking a look at the section on "Account Security Cases" in this dev blog. It's from a few years ago but the information still applies.:
---
 [https://www.eveonline.com/article/customer-support-past-present-and-future](https://www.eveonline.com/article/customer-support-past-present-and-future)
---
Some info may be a little be outdated, but 98% is good :)
---
Bots will adapt to blackout as you can code into them to constantly dscan and will be more responsive to stuff showing on dscan than players will ever be.
---
Well, that's not an answer an omega (paying) customer expect.
---
The problem simply is cost.
---
Ganking a new player will have a cost in the region somewhere between 20/90% of their total earnings, while the ganker stands to lose a tiny fraction of a percentage point of their total. If this was equalised and gankers lost the equivalent percent total across all accounts, they'd never newbie gank.
---
Eve has the capitalist monopoly issue. People who have the most have all the advantages. Monopolies aren't stable, eventually it all collapses in on itself.
---
You need high sec generating income, it's beyond healthy for the game, and taking it away would kill off eve. CCP know that.
---
The thread is very well written.
---
If it's a sandbox experience why are you the one who gets to decide who I can and can't kill? 
---
See how this kind of arguing works?
---
For you maybe, and we accept you for that buddy. Nobody is accusing null being a stagnant boring empty space most of the time and Tidi infested lagfest the other. Why do you even care if you are not even living in high sec?
---
\&gt; hard earned Venture
---
You know you get these literally thrown at you everywhere?
---
\&gt; too easy to gank someone
---
Fit your ship like it matters. I've been in corps where individual members flew 500+ mil Procurers. I was right there in my Brickurer when they popped. What was the difference between me and them? I fitted only a shield + hull buffer which made it unattractive to gank my ship. Even if my barges would have gotten ganked, they would have paid themselves multiple times already.
---
the only common things in both game is "spaceship" everything else is different :)
---
I was just wondering i have mainly saw this on social media that the game is dying/ you should not play alone the problem is is that I can not play with anyone :(
---
i was just completing his meme! i liked the video!
---
It seems true.
---
I dont think it has anything to do with safety, i think what makes new players continue playing is interacting with other players, joining a community and getting to know other humans. In hisec its pretty much foreveralone.jpg afk mining a roid. There's no interaction and its dead fucking boring.
---
Wow /u/Coach990 5/5 for creating an alt account to sling shit at everyone in this thread
---
Remove ganking but limit earnings in hisec. Let new players get addicted and acclimated and limiting isk generation opportunities gives people a choice. Stay there and make garbage isk or advance to riskier endeavors.
---
The issue isn’t a safe hisec, the issue is a safe hisec with the current earning potential.
---
Then there is a choice to be made, between having a specific module that gives you information or more shield (or whatever you choose)... why would we want to remove that decision? 
---
As you pointed, it's far from vital information (that's why people hardly use it), and there's already a module to get it if you *really* want.
---
So how much is this in real money?
---
I think you can use survey scanner for this.
---
Bump plz give eve what it needs
---
Just don't record anything. That is against the law.
---
Look up ccp ghosts presentation at eve Amsterdam.
---
I seeee
---
Ah, the well honed cutting wit of an average 13 year old screaming down the microphone that they fucked your mum.
---
Can you send me the EBR number?
---
Also, it's possible a GM (reached through a support ticket) can do something to help fix the problem.  Devs may have already corrected the underlying software problem but if your account is in a weird state as a result, it may require GM intervention to fix.  If you haven't already, you should open a support ticket too.
---
As a general rule of thumb (though there are many exceptions):  Bug reports help future people who might have the same problem.  Support tickets get you help with your account and your items.
---
CONCORD is not supposed to protect you in hisec. CONCORD only punishes, they dont protect
---
The top level post i replied to is about removing esi entirely. This is something i believe most people that think its a good idea aren't really considering all the ramifications of. I cant speak for other groups but atleast where i live ive never seen anyone use "local scanners" for intel. Everything is manually reported by a player and the only thing thats happened during the blackout is now you watch gates instead of local
---
I would say if you are playing quite active with your account's and paying them with euro's time limit should be 1-2 days and active contact by email by admins. Terrible to hear over week response and month....uuuh.
---
Basically they want to be pirates
---
LOL I guess you don't log in either eh. Look me up.
---
Just looks like normal PL alliance chat
---
True but this opens up more play for blops and I admit something needs to be dont about botting in the future but the blackout works for now
---
\- Choose a name that does not start with a number or with one of the early letters of the alphabet
---
\- When, not if, you lose a ship, no matter how expensive it is, get a new one and carry on
---
\- NEVER give a single ISK to CODE!
---
You were warned. Remember that.
---
Just a question why do I have to do this?
---
Elite dangerous is vast and...pointless. 
---
Losing your ship is a minor inconvenience and at some point there simply isn’t anything to do with your wealth. You can’t even invest it to make more. 
---
In eve losing a ship can be crippling. Early game losing that vexor your worked for weeks to build or purchase can be a real kick in the preverbal dick. 
---
Later trying to pull off a Spicy Maneuver could cost you a titan and your very own reddit thread of shame. 
---
You can always invest 100% of your wealth in foolish endeavors and sometimes it pays off. 
---
Finally the people. I’ve been playing with my friends in my Corp of ten years. An actual decade of real time. We have argued and cussed each other but through the medium of eve online I have formed friendships that have very real meaning to me. I’ve even been invited to a wedding because of eve. 
---
So ultimately I guess my message to you is that the most important thing you can possibly do as a new player in eve is find a group of people that you mesh with. And play eve with them. I don’t think that’s something the elite dangerous offers very well.  
---
If you want to hang out in discord and ask questions about anything at all pm me and I’ll get you a link. 
---
Fly dangerous and always try to engage the enemy.
---
With the amount of moons, ice belts, and more anoms in highsec and can never be mined to a point it becomes worthless. That's why you should force people out. If you wanna live in highsec do so by living on barely anything. You shouldnt be allowed to hide there and afk mine your way to fortune.
---
Eh, I've spent more on dumber shit.
---
Maybe as part of the NPE it sends one new player into a belt to mine and another new player into the same belt to gank him.
---
Just because you disagree with someone, doesn't mean their opinion/assessment is of no value.
---
Are you looking for people to just agree with you or something?
---
Ok and can I get the discord invite?
---
The headline is misleading, the article was about the direction of the game which included an example of suicide ganking of new players
---
Star Wars Galaxies is a good example of what happens to a strong player base when you force changes on those who don’t want or are indifferent about those changes.   @CCP should heed those lessons.
---
I have the exact same issue on one of my accounts but not all. Opened a ticket this morning.
---
it's a rough estimate of the full damage of the wave. You can compensate a little by refitting into tankier setups at the beginning of the wave or by just killing things quickly and removing dps from the field.
---
There's no real dps minimum though the more the better to complete sites faster and overwhelm NPC active tank.

*scans friendly ship*
---
It's been dying for 16 years and it's designed to be played in a group. You can play by yourself but it's going to make everything harder for you, especially if you don't have multiple accounts.
---
Only a fraction of those comments have anything to do with suicide ganking. Most of them are the usual "The new changes and no local are killing Eve" posts
---
It was probably to keep it in line with the Sansha modules, iirc they are being introduced as drops from sansha
---
Yeah man... that's what's going on here. I'd take the average 13 year old's cutting wit over whatever the fuck you are given what you've taken away from this conversation.
---
This was some of my favorite solo PVE last time I was playing. Spot on advice, but, maybe a bit of a long term goal for someone who just got their first bil?
---
The price of skillbooks alone is probably making his head spin. Definitely a good time, especially when its in hostile space, get hunted, finish the site anyway, get out a bil richer. 
---
ofc.... Never not brag in local about your haul before jumping out in your travel fit.... er... they still travel as well right? I just came back from a long enough hiatus that all my T3s have "old" modules.
---
1. When calling targets fleet commanders tend to start by the top of the list.
---
2. Ships are ammo in this game, the only ship that matter is friendship
---
3. CODE are an in game scamming corp, they will harass miner asking for money to stop. If you pay you will become labeled as milkable capsuler and they will target you even harder asking for more.
---
Put Nerd hat on, buy crate of dr pepper &amp; you are ready to play.
---
first off, people have been saying the game is dying since 2008. 
---
Second, PWS is recruiting! come get some Wormhole action. It's way better than joining a null megablock because you're not just a faceless minion in some other dudes grand plans. You're a valued team member in wormhole space.
---
but yea send me a PM here on reddit if you're interested and I'll send you more info.
---
ah then its alot faster now
---
I have questions
---
You're probably seeing people in local from all over Eve, too. makes for some interesting times.
---
That just makes me sad all over.  
---
To go to all the trouble to sit in a Rorqual and not even have a IC, a PANIC or a tank.  It makes me want to send him fit in the mail more than anything else.
---
3. Sounds a lot like real life...
---
You dont have that data. That data is something that people who works in CCP knows, they never showed that to us, as far as i know.
---
Do the tutorial.
---
Join [Horde](https://www.pandemic-horde.org/)
---
That... Well, I'm a "there is no free lunch" kind of person. And when I hear stuff like this I get really jumpy!
---
Are you sure this isn't dirty money? By "dirty money" I mean money got by forbidden mean... People do get banned over shit like this! :(
---
I would suggest you opening a ticket to CCP, explain the situation, and ask them to see if the money is clean or not!
---
If it isn't, it would be better to lose it now than losing it when CCP tracks it back to your account!
---
&gt;the orca should be removed from highsec and ice belts and moon mining should go with it.
---
are you fucking high? How the hell do you expect lowclass WH corps to do any kind of logistics?
---
Actually more people doing 2FA.
---
New players already have an easing in period.
---
It is already against the rules to scam/suicide-gank new players in the starter systems.
---
go to 0.0 security straight away. Don't fall for the highsec pitfall
---
Make sure you don’t update/send new messages on the same ticket, it pushes it to the back of the queue
---
Then  you can assume that there are currently no issues from our end right now.
---
This is actually pretty simple.   
---
You define what can and cannot be on dscan.       
---
If you are running dominixes -&gt; well if you see something else, better dock up.                      
---
Next thing i heard recently is using a single char with combat probes to control a system.           
---
You can easily detect if something new is showing up on combat probes - if you had all your ships scanned earlier.         
---
Ofcourse this will not work in highly populated place - but you will not put bot there.
---
I bet they think the police will save them IRL too.
---
Hey Falcon!
---
Give players some random stuff as a gift to people that apply their accounts for 2FA, that really encourage them.
---
All of my accounts are there already, people should be really using that. Its not enough to tell them the amount of shit that can happen if they dont make it.
---
It would reduce SO MUCH that queue.
---
o/
---
Find a new player friendly group and join it. My recommendation is Pandemic Horde. Google 'Join Horde EvE' and instructions should come up. You can DM me if you get lost.
---
Seriously, run through the new player tutorial to learn all the buttons. Do a few missions in High Sec (.5 system and above) and then go join a new player friendly group.
---
EvE has a lot to learn and is complex. You want a new player friendly group to help you learn.
---
Had a buddy get banned on his accounts for selling a titan and having such a large amount of isk transfer through a toon that I'm assuming triggered an automatic detection thing. Been almost five weeks now. If we need to crowd fund for more security team guys I'm down to do that 100%. I just want him back to playing the game again.
---
do we really need a thread on this literally every time the chat acts a bit wonky?
---
um, maybe spend 2 seconds thinking of a way to avoid dieing to this?
---
"I mean, we’ve had gates to Stain since we added Stain!”     
---
It's hard to argue with logic like that...
---
Mining is so passive as it is, just press the scan button and work out the math.
---
Hey Is PePsI oK
---
TL;DR OP wants help scripting a bot.
---
i disagree, aren't most of the major blocs using caldari shit? I see more feroxes, caracals, and shit like that than anything
---
The problem with skill injectors.  I seriously think these should be limited to 20mill SP max injection  if the intention was to give new players a heads up
---
Reading official CCP responses in here has me concerned. Paying customers should not be waiting days for a response. That is unacceptable, period.
---
I have heard the "make high-sec a smaller newbie safe area" a bunch of times in the few years Ive been on the CSM. Its one of those things that cant seem to get enough support behind it even from the residents of high-sec itself. There are a TON of people who only really play in high sec and probably dont post on the reddits much who likely dont want their way of playing turned upside down and turned into the newbie starter area. The few people who have toughed it out in low-sec over the years would be equally torqued about having their capitals banned from the space they live in and being forced into nullsec with them.
---
Maybe in this age of flipping tables and changing big stuff on the fly there is more of an appetite for doing something nuts like that but if the plan to "revive lowsec" includes pushing highsec players to lowsec the plan is probably dead on arrival. Consensus is so hard to find. I wish that bit was easier because something clearly needs shaken up.
---
I may be totally oversimplifying it all but it seems like half the systems in Eve have no people in them at all. Taking people happily plugging away in their space(high-sec) and trying to cram them into the underpopulated areas probably isnt the way to go. Absent being able to fill those places with new players it almost seems like just getting out a carving knife and hacking away at the map and tossing some new NPC space in the far flung reaches may be the simplest solution to anemic player density.
---
Suicide ganking isn't really a fight though, is it? By the time the first shot is fired the hostiles have already scanned your ship, calculated the DPS required, and logged in however many accounts as are necessary to get the job done before CONCORD arrives based on your maximum EHP.
---
When your actions at the time can have no effect on the outcome of a fight, that is poor gameplay. Now naturally one can say that the error was making themselves a suitable target in the first place, but what with multiboxing, alts, and practically no long-term consequences for suicide ganking, the balance of that equation is way off.
---
It is a money launderer.
---
Show me on the venture where the mean catalyst touched you.
---
New player retention isn't the only meaningful metric.
---
No pvp might keep a lot of people around, but the game wouldn't be eve.
---
I wasn't happy when that poopyhead in that wardec Corp that killed my Coveter with a Stabber Fleet. But I learned from it, I learned to watch local for war targets. I learned that the last hour of the wardec was not safe (they dont stop until the wars totally over). Shortly after, as my Corp (Sebenicum) died to continuous wardecs. That wasn't fun, but I went to null with some corp mates and stayed there. I learned about the transient nature of eve entities. 
---
I lose and I learn. And so did/does everyone else. HTFU
---
As long as you are not agressed, if you take a fight on a gate always make sure you want to take it before you attack the other player.
---
sure sounds flippant but trust me - by all means do the tutorial, use some of the excellent alpha guides out there which have been posted ..
---
...but if you want to look into what the game has to offer on a more meta scale, nullsec, fleet fights and serious krabbing (isk making) then I would seriously suggest joining Horde as their help systems and support for new players are second to none.
---
Most fun I had in Eve in a long time, and I have been here since 2007.
---
Imagine getting worked up over a 10k contract fee
---
Sure, that sweet afk veldspar money just like chribba used to make with the veldnaught.
---
Obviously, that's what my post said.  Thanks for the helpful comment.
---
CCP wants to black out all chat.
---
I'd be all for banning suicide ganking, just make guns not activate in hisec unless the other guy is blinky.
---
In exchange CCP should make most of the donut hole lowsec. Hisec is reduced to a few systems around the markethubs, with no agents above lvl 2, and all the empires are cut off from one another. Also no cynos in empire lowsec. Also also, hike all trade taxes in hisec including player citadels.
---
There, hisec is actually high security, but you can't stay there forever if you want to earn isk. It's a few islands of safety where newbies learn the ropes, and you can keep your plex stash safe, or rebuild after getting evicted, but EvE is outside those islands and if you want to play the game you have to go there.
---
If they are active 23/7, a small amount of income begins to add up pretty fast.
---
Thank you for your much appreciated elaboration.
---
thats a strange way of saying all of us were suffering simultaneous mass hallucinations regarding the chat malfunctioning
---
i mean what can i say besides ur welcome
---
is "in a contract window" the only place to see the number of runs on multiple BPCs at a time?
---
id like to see that fit to be fair. 
---
i only seemed to be able to get around 400-500dps out of a hurricane.
---
and even then the tank was never something great. compare it to a ferox or brutix or harbinger and you see an AC cane is not that great
---
I like the approach, refocusing high security as a place for the new, the alpha, the trader, the industrialist (some), and the truly casual player, with less (but still some) risk, and correspondingly less reward.
---
The risk/reward for low then needs the corresponding update. As of now there is not much reason to be in low, other than to get "gud" fights, if you can. CCP may never be able to fix the screwed-up, low-sec FW mechanics or get the right balance on low sites/events,  but kicking war-time capitals out of low sec would alone go far toward reviving low.
---
I don't hang out in highsec already. The reason isn't bitterness or a desire to haze newbs. It's more about getting what I want from the game.
---
Here's the thing though; not everyone wants the same things as I do or has the same risk profile as I have. There are players (actual people, not bots) who are content to run L4s and are happy. There always have been. Making these guys live in poverty because they refuse to accept the greater risk as nullbears only encourages them to leave, not be retained.
---
There is always going to be a significant population of highsec bears. I might like to remove moon mining and would DEFINITELY like to see invasions cease but L4 missions aren't so big a deal these days. 
---
I honestly think more players would leave than be encouraged to stay.
---
well to be honest if he can run a t2 tank, getting the offensive and defensive t3c skills to V doesn't take to long. Apart from that he just needs his basic weapon skills to 4 at least and can run them with meta guns. You can get enough dps for a 6/10 quite easy in a t3c. 
---
So I wouldn't think its too much of a long term goal for a new player, if theyve done some exploration etc and know how to not get killed.  Most of nullsec and lowsec is uninhabited, tons of 6/10s are going to waste.
---
/u/Vylkor’s points are spot on.
---
The only ship that matters is friendship. Never forget that. There’s nothing so awesome as shooting someone in the face in the game and then getting sloshed with them at Fanfest.
---
Not for you, but for someone who might be so inclined: if you have any issue with a player, keep it in the client. You get to shoot back in EVE Online. Use that as a motivator. Do not take it out of the client. Some people are bad losers and then some. Don’t be that person.

Have fun!

Generally you only want to do ones with a DED rating, others normally has a chance of a faction spawn at the end and a chance of an escalation. For these you only get good loot if you get escalations all the way down the chain. This also involves a lot of travelling and is kind of a pain to do. 
---
If you are exploring in a stratios you can probably look at carrying a combat refit with it, and do 6/10s if you find them in empty space. They can pay out VERY well.
---
¿Por que no los dos?
---
After a blood test, thorough background check, and psychological exam. Also your API key
---
i will double your isk
---
True, bots can be programmed to d-scan, but 1) an automated d-scan behavior, even a "random" one, should be easily detectable, even for CCP, and 2) the scan still doesn't tell you if it's friendly or not - there is still the potential to interrupt the activity, very much so in higher populated areas.
---
Did you read it? Look how much ISK is imported and exported from the Forge and how little is actually destroyed. 
---
Almost everything that undocks arrives safely. Highsec is objectively very, very safe, even The Forge.
---
Christ you are toxic as hell.
---
Just like I do, I got min skills for orca and I use it to haul stuff xD
---
Stop making sense. You are breaking the narrative!
---
Blackout killed botting, mkay!!!
---
Shit u rite
---
I haven't played in a long time and 98% of my contracts were private to alts or alliancemates
---
anything you like. Oh and join corporation for newbeans, playin with someone from the start is a big deal to stay.
---
You know it's Eve Onion right
---
Of course.
---
CCP claims thats dying is good for retention rates.
---
Idk what he's thinking.  But maybe haulers?
---
I don't think a hamfisted change to hisec like that benefits anyone, though.
---
Unlikely. It would be the end of the game to be honest.
---
You can't tank them. You'd never be able to move anything worth more than 100mil in a standard hauler
---
Holy shit why are there so many venture losses at once on his in?
---
One of your best videos. Nice fights.
---
Lets see, skill injectors are 500k a pop, 14/.5= 28 skill injectors.  But also diminishing returns, so lets say 35 because I feel like it.  Skill injectors are 1bil isk, thats 35 bil isk.  $20/2 bil ISK via plex.  Thats $10 per billion ISK.  
---
$350.  
---
Damn.
---
wtf! that would literally make eve a second job.  No corp in goons has anything near that as far as I know, and I doubt any corp in Test or PH has that either. 
---
Join the game again and maybe try something different like wormholes?
---
But chat has been broken all weekend and yesterday with no updates.
---
Does this mean that from your end there have not been issues since the status update on 2nd August?
---
I am a o+ blood type  and I have stolen from 30 donut shops in 20 days and I am caller the donut phantom (btw most criminals have an o+ blood type ) :)
---
hmmm, 700DPS (with medium drones) 50k tank (with links going)
---
pre rigs and drones was 500dps (my usual number i find)
---
now, compare this to a brutix or ferox...? 50k ehp is nothing, the only that is going for this is your proberly dead before your neuted out with an 800mm plate :D  but what you stated is correct ofc. not taking that away from you. but these stats just dont keep up
---
Go to any ice belt or moon belt in highsec. They are filled with multiboxing veterans in Skills and Orca gobbling up the resources before the poor new players can get some. These types are the biggest griefers in the game in my opinion. These players are shameless, and even forced CCP to add new mining sites to starter systems because these multiboxing fleets would swoop in even there and take all the ore. 
---
We don't need more of this rookie griefing. I'm all for making new players have an easier go of it, but not by making these veterans even safer and more able to out-compete the new players. Highsec should be riskier for both veteran miners and pirates, and more interesting for new players. Making it yet again safer doesn't help either.
---
You and me both. When I opened the thread and saw CCP response, I expected OP to get dunked with a "you fucked up, stop lying" from my experience with other mmos. Instead of even acknowledging how that long of a wait time is a problem, their comments are pretty much boiled down to "ah that sucks, not going to get better any time soon"
---
That's not a bad idea, 
---
25K skillpoints?
---
I understand your point but i don't agree with it. Highsec isn't safe. (Destroyed value)/(transiting value) may be low but that's due to player knowing that ganking is a thing so they tank their transport ships or fill them with less valuable items than the ones they would if ganking wasn't a thing.
---
Jita may be the most common trade hub in the game but it's still odd how the amount of destruction in a highsec region can be compared with the one of a nullsec region where space overlord throw ships against each others.
---
To be clear i'm not complaining to highsec being not clear enough even if i think that ganking shouldn't be a think but should be replaced by better war mechanics.
---
No it cannot be easily detectable as you can define 2-5 second delay between "pressing" the scan and as variable use like 100ms.           
---
While the scan cannot say you if you are friendly or not, you can use any combination of above : naming scheme , current location, ship type.         
---
So if you know that you can only see 3 alts in Isthars in the systems ... if something else or more show up you know that you need to warp  ... like now.
---
Yea I mean the entire point of a cane is to be a fast, nano fit Arty boat...and I'm using it as a brawler lol. Still when you heat it it shits DPS, it burns brightly but briefly.
---
It's almost like there's actually content everywhere.
---
I'm fully erect thinking about it... this is a perfect ending.

Doesnt mean its not true.
---
To be fair medium guns kinda suck across the board right now, and the only ones I would say are in an ok place balance wise are hybrids and maybe artillery.
---
Nah, you still need to be able to play the game. You might be more inclined to get out there, take risks and learn to fight though if you've got the isk to replace your ship. 
---
For a lot of people, pvp is the most important part of the game, meaning they have to constantly grind isk to pay for the ships they lose. If you have kids and work full time, you might not like the idea of spending your limited free time grinding enough isk to buy a ship you know you'll eventually lose. In that case, you'd be better off spending your good boy points on some plex, buying some ships and trying to shoot people with them. You know, like an adult spending money on a hobby. 
---
And the game needs those people, because they provide the market with a way to pay for omega game time with isk. It's a very healthy circle.
---
Utter Chaos! Mission accomplished lol!
---
There is a reason you have so many "pay2win" mobile games or games with stupid amounts of cosmetics and microtransactions. Plenty of people who spend tons of money on games
---
Terrible tracking and fitting difficulties? Yeah I have.
---
Someone posted this a while back if it helps. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8je4kp/i_made_my_streamdeck_into_an_eve_control_panel/
---
That depends on the context. I work in customer service for a major telco and we have cases such as fraud where we can not communicate anything until investigation is completed.
---
I didn't even know we could enable 2FA. Can I still launch group them but just enter my time based pass code once ?
---
terrible tracking. holy shit ive 2shot garmurs orbiting me max speed at long point range, the thing tracks just fine xD
---
its im sure your fit or gun of choice that is the issue. cynabals are waaay OP if fit and flown right
---
What? Unbonused medium AC tracking, outside web range? You sir are simply a liar. :)
---
Aha, exactly!  Something similar to that is what I'm after!  That's very cool and the presentation looks very nice on it!  I always thought it was a bit disappointing that EVE, a game as old as it is and as ripe for it as it could be, doesn't have any even cheap peripherals that go along with it.  Who DOESN'T want a mini ship control panel?  It's a pretty neat idea to me!
---
I hadn't thought about including drones on it, but that's a sweet idea too.  Definitely going to do that now.  Thanks for sharing that, definitely adds some inspiration!
---
There is tons of people playing this game to run missions or mine some stuff like 2-3h/month when they have time or will to login.           
---
I know people that play this game for last 10 years and never joined a PVP fleet or "ratted" as they just do industry.                
---
I "knew" people trading in markets, but they died out due to 0.01isk bots :D           
---
Still EVE could get some interesting change that by default could split the higsec into islands.      
---
Making few systems lowsec ones and adjusting connections to them(so they are connected to other lowsec) could create more interesting higsec area, with more niche roles like smuggling and more trade hubs.                 
---
But this is something that will never happen as it actually requires adjustments to ingame map and CCP is unwilling to do it.
---
I'm trying to follow Hilmar's view here from that TIS interview.  There is no mechanic or structure that gives immediate information in all areas of new eden.  If hunters want content they need to work to find it, not just opening up Dotlan and looking for NPC Kills (Delta).
---
Otherwise, leave all the info on the ESI and abandon this idea of chaos so the krabs have local and the hunters have Dotlan to find the krabs.  I just feel like hunters and krabs complain they want more advantages but don't want to work for it.
---
much love&lt;3
---
ive been both the garmur in this scenerio.
---
and then asked for fit once i died, and then continued to use said fit just fine.
---
and no the fit has 2 tracking enhancers in the lows
---
I think capitals are the big reason you really only see people in fw
---
Accidently activated the gate to abyssal proving grounds,  due to not paying attention.

Won the match! My hands are still trembling ever so slightly, and i’m feeling high as a kite with all the adrenaline.
---
He addressed issue badly.         
---
Orca should lose ability to use mining drones.        
---
Like this ship became a higsec cancer, you just leave few of those with T2 drones and go AFK for hours.
---
Double TE shield cynabal huh? Interesting. 220s?
---
I use the blue color for all my neutrals; it’s a color that’s easily visible to me and one that I can distinguish when it’s up against any nebulae so that I can notice new ships on grid or new ships getting closer more easily.
---
But it did killed botting, but only until new bot versions come out.
---
im working off memory and not used it in a while.
---
im pretty sure it was 420's. but could of been 220's.
---
2 tracking, 2 gyro DCU 2extender is all i can remember xD but the thing is a beast IMO
---
Godamn drifters scramming our comms again..
---
Okay so it's the old TE fit? Did you use it since the tracking enhancer nerfs a couple years ago? Cos AFAIK that fit hasn't worked since 2016

---
TBF, CCP said how many times in the past year that chat should be fixed?  We did have a few months there where it seemed pretty stable so I gotta give a little credit.
---
might sound like a joke, but tbh, the "Don't fall for the highsec pitfall", is actually real advice ;-) Highsec is good for learning the basics, but tends to get boring real fast, real soon. Once you tend to get bored, try to move to W-Space, 0.0 security or lowsec for greater isk income and more enjoyable content ;-)
---
Sec status is a buggy mess. So are shitadels.
---
The security tickets can take a while....and I get it...you are paying for your subscriptions just like the rest (or some) of us do. When they get back to you, make sure you are awarded omega time that coincides with the time you have been unable to access your account. Has happened to some of the people in my Corp throughout the years.  
---
They have tons of tickets, and not nearly enough people to properly tackle them. Note I said properly tackle them (with access and know how to the data required for the higher security related tickets).
---
I'm director for a corp and so I've been involved in helping many of my Corp mates open many kinds of different tickets and seeing their different completion times. 
---
I have found the following in the last 2 years...of the dozens of tickets I've known of or helped initiate from various Corp mates, tickets that GMs handle (ship reimbursement etc) are the quickest with 1-several days.  Your issue, security related events involving bans, are unfortunately the longest, and can take days to weeks depending on the ban. Since yours states account abuse...one can infer they need to have someone with high level access to certain databases and tables pour over lots of accounts and bread crumbs...it will take a while...
---
Complaining about it will not make it go quicker.  It is what it is. They have to sift through a ton of data. We can yell and whine...if it makes is feel better. We can also just chill, enjoy your time out and play solaris...or replay SOMA...or go back to starcraft 2. I think those are all the options.  Hell, make your own raspberry pi console gaming machine complete with wireless controllers...the options...they are endless!
---
Nah, they nerfed em so they like they are now, they used to be way too strong.
---
ill be honest i dont remember a TrEnhancer nerf.
---
but i have been playing for the last couple of years without a break. (longer with breaks included)
---
i think i last had success solo in it around 2018 first 6months sort of timeframe? i mean, to say it doesnt fit, i mean, i can get a rokh to track a frigate without tracking modules just fly a certain way to help your tracking and youll hit....... like, hitting frigates is hard, but to say a dual TrEnhancer doesnt work is wrong. 
---
doesnt work as well. ok sure, fly a little better. its balanced as now you gotta actually do somthing.
---
Or sabre or any other good ship for that matter
---
Welcome to Hel
---
yea that seems fine to me. The Orca is just way too valuable as a utility ship and nothing else fills its role. losing the ability to move ships, equipment, and loot in relative safety would cripple us to the point of being unable to operate in our hole. I mean hell we're already working with a smaller hauler than most groups get since we can't do freighters
---
Nice, a post with 116 comments has 0 points.

One tip for you that I have is join horde. It's one of the best newbie corps out there and they give you a bunch of beginner ships and skills to start out.

No, stop trying to force yourself into relevancy

They responded to me within hours of an account recovery request. Just depends on your case and their availability I presume.

You can 2fa once then set up your launcher to never have to do it again from that same device. Then you can launch wihout 2faing every time.

I was so wanting that to be a picture of Steve Urkel with text "did I do that" shrugging his shoulders.

I remember when they talked about killmarks on mails. Years ago. 
---
Still don't have any hopes for that. Would be really cool, it could show for both the final blow ship + the victim.
---
I made my newbro friend into my cyno bitch and we both died
---
Naturally this would mean just cynos and not covops cynos?
---
Ok this sounds dum but once I join the horde if I do not like it can I leave?
---
Or maybe CCP could staff Team Security properly, so people trying to play their game aren't accidentally locked out for weeks?
---
Yeah, covops cynos would be unchanged.
---
Thanks for your reply. Other than a stratios, could I use a T3?
---
Also I am tempted to do some of the Unrated Complexes, just for fun, even if it's not optimal. I'm just not sure what I can fly - it seems there's very little info about these, any ideas on a ship or fit?

Dang, man. Well done.

Where has I ever said I have been ganked. You are only assuming that to feel right. My post only shows you the proof of a highly upvoted steam review. Blind yourself as much as you want.   
---
Yes, yes. You guys always say adapt or die etc. Think you sound so cool. Never ever it occurs to you that Eve as a game also has to adapt to modern age if it wants to survive. Deal with it.

Upvoting because I like the principle, but the execution would need a lot of thought.

Such a rollercoaster ride. Goddamn it

are you a stroke victim or something?

And how long do you think a new player stays in those systems? As soon as they finish tutorials, which does not cover anything but locking, orbiting and shooting.

i never had online friends. or friends on video games, or headset/microphone communications on my pc with anyone before eve online.
---
ive made friends ive had for 6 years and will continue to have them as friends through this game.
---
you dont need anyone, the community is there. what they mean is you will eventually need to join 'a side' whether its in hisec lowsec or nullsec. theres always pvp.
---
trying to get to the ice belts to mine them before anyone else in hisec, trying to scan all the signatures down before anyone else (everywhere) trying to get the top damage or best solo kill mail in lowsec. or trying to join the most fleets and help your team win in nullsec (in the big wars)
---
this game is a rollercoaster, you will be permanantly confused for the first 6 months. second 6months youll think you know better than everyone else. 1years in youll of made a choice and know exactly what you want from the game and head staright for it. 1 year after that youll realise youve never tried 80% of the game still and will go hunting to play the rest. 4years later you will have just a few things left to try and practice at. after youve done it all youll either be so integrated into the game or the community, or your friends group you wont want to leave. or youll be leader of the number 1 bloc in nullsec and you cant leave even though you hate everyone and everything around you. you stick to it because, you are. the leader
---
I agree on the idea but not the words. Suicide ganking is a method used for piracy but also for griefing.  
---
What you refer as 'Suicide ganking' is in fact griefing, or in some cases bad pirating (people sometimes don't fully understand how to earn anything from suicide ganking).
---
And this is written where? In tutorials?
---
Go into your launcher settings and choose "Download Everything," then allow the ENTIRE game to download.  You'll have a smoother experience overall if you do this.
---
By default, the launcher downloads a limited set of graphic assets and then fetches the rest on the fly while you play.  This is great for getting you into the game fast initially, if you're on a decent-speed connection, but can make load times a lot longer than they need to be when you undock or jump through a gate.
---
"Download Everything" lets the launcher collect every asset in the game, and you can still launch the game while it's downloading if you don't want to wait for it.
---
No, just related to the topic at hand (killmails still not updated despite years worth of talk).
---
Well, it's a bit of both.
---
I like to not lose my supers trying to move them so removing cynos would suck for that.
---
I also like the idea of caps not being the fastest thing to arrive on grid either offensively or defensively. Slow escalation with caps having to try to find a way to gate in would be more fun imo.
---
Penif tried to kiss me on the cheek but i gave him the ole switcharoo and full tongued em

Highsec is nearly perfectly safe to a veteran with a complete understanding of the game mechanics as the MER numbers show. There are perhaps a few cases where you might have to go to more extreme lengths to have that safety, but for most things, just paying attention and taking basic precautions (read don't make yourself a profitable target) will keep you safe. Complacency are laziness/greed are really the only killers of veterans in highsec. 
---
I totally get that isn't true for new players though who don't have access to the safest ships or the understanding of the game mechanics. That is a tough game design problem to solve however. I think a safe starter constellation, with nothing of interest/value for veterans might be the only solution. Call that highsec, rename current highsec to middlesec to make it clear you are intended to be at risk, and new players will have more space to learn the game before thrown into competition with the rest of us. 
---
That still has the problem it has to be made interesting and not feel like a 'bait and switch' when they leave the safe zone, but I see no other way to provide targeted safety to new players, but not veterans.
---
Amount of ISK here compared to total means nothing. A newbie ship is not even a drop in an ocean in total, but it is all of newbies assets.

Considering the absurd vulnerability of an orca and anything that miens ice, and how any larger entity can just drop supers to whelp anything that's not supers, it'd just remove ice for anyone not in null.
---
"a reason to go to low" isn't really valid as long as low is just a punching bag for null. Trying to force more people into that isn't going to work. :P
---
No, I even specificaly asked you to show me where has he explained to me how I am wrong though, and you still give me no answer, which leads me to believe you have none and just disagree without even explaining why.
---
It's funny how this is always the answer from CCP when with any other game I have ever played at least a person working the ticket responds within the first 24 hours to let you know it didn't fall into a black hole and its usually resolved within 48 hours.
---
I agree, but it should be more visual, like pieces of rock falling off and the rock shrinking.

This is a pretty good resource
---
You got me wrong. Ship is worth 10m, the fine is 500m for ganking it in high sec.
---
The best kind of features are the unexpected ones, They could also be called Surprise Mechanics.
---
Sorry, but suicide ganking is not easy.
---
It’s time-intensive, costly, often stressful and can fail spectacularly with just one wrong click, like everything else in this game. 
---
Gankers took years to refine the various scenarios to prevent a gank going wrong. As targets adapted, they changed tactics, too. 
---
And keep in mind, the vast majority of gankers follow CCP’s rules about rookie griefing and have even taken steps beyond published rules to avoid crossing the “exploit” line.
---
I like the idea of large Josef islands. Where all the major trade hubs are on separate ones
---
Ships destroyed are not true ISK sinks though. You give your ISK to a manufacturer or a seller. Your ISK stays in the game. It still increases inflation because it stays in the circulation. True ISK sinks are like market taxes. That ISK is removed from the circulation, hence less ISK in game, hence lower inflation.
---
This is pretty cool, actually!  That's a really neat concept, and I like how it's dynamic and changes the icons based on past keypresses.  Makes it quite compact and reduces the overall number of inputs needed.  I just wish there was a way to get feedback from the game for certain functions.  
---
It would be cool to have "WARP DRIVE ACTIVE" flashing on your dashboard whether or not you hit warp or you got fleet warped, for example.  This is a pretty cool concept I may consider tinkering with, too.
---
Now this also makes me want to integrate a simple LCD display readout like [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4313) so I could make a mini capacitor readout as well.

I\`m ganking in HS since 2010. New players hardly ever get ganked (under 0.1% of my kills), they simply are not hauling expensive stuff. And if somehow they get killed and I\`am positive he\`s new, I usually reimburse them.

Found a bunch of those dudes in another system. I just sat cloaked in a Stratios and waited for them to undock. They’d all warp to the same site where I would uncloak and kill one while the four other Myrms just warped out. They immediately warped back in on several occasions allowing me to kill multiple Myrms at a time. Dude has like 7-8 Myrms a system in probably 6 different systems. It’s wild. There’s also pods that sit on gates that act as a replacement to having no local chat. If you kill the pods, they immediately undock and warp right back after they respawn.
---
Good luck.
---
who is to say that its not a feature we are interpreting as a problem?
---
So it's a recurring issue. There is no reason for which an "investigation" should last more than a few days and you should treat your customers, Alpha or Omega with care they deserve. 
---
How are we supposed to know if we should just go an play another game for 5 months if we get banned by some overeager GM? The issue is often trivial and at least I though that my ticket will be resolved within a few hours. I was badly mistaken.
---
Treat people with respect, HTFU, hire more GMs and invest in this game we all love.
---
Who is crying about what now? My post only shows proof of many people obiviously do not like this griefing mechanic. As a sane player, I want Eve to be back to 60k PCU days without any alphas around. If eve does not adapt, it will die.
---
This looks perfect. Thanks!
---
Personly i Think we would have a month of boredom because no one would do anything
---
That tutorial is no longer here. Shows how little you know about new player experience to be honest. Today you only learn about locking, orbiting, shooting, turret range and that is it.
---
Sure, and in the meantime, OP can wait his turn like everyone else instead of giving himself priority over the people who have been waiting longer. 
---
The two aren't mutually exclusive.
---
More GM's would indeed be very welcoming and could crush botting even faster as it took them 4 months of "investigation" to ban 50 bots I reported daily. Week after brand new bots were made, again 4 months, new bots made... I gave up on reporting....
---
If we want chaos, it should effect all cyno's equally. Meaning, caps can't drop on the random roaming gang, but bombers can't effortlessly drop on caps either. That would be much better chaos, rather than basically making it 1 sided.
---
If CCP were to do something like that, it should effect all cynos, not just 1 type, otherwise, as u/Ghostile put it, it just comes off as a post about punishing certain groups and not others (keep in mind, i think cyno's are imbalanced and need a rework, but the presentation of your idea looks bias).
---
Of course it isn't. Because he no longer plays due to a griefing mechanic.
---
Heaven forbid we fight without our titans and supers being the first thing on grid!
---
I think he’s being sarcastic. Don’t join Horde.
---
You need to find your way a little bit to work or what you want to do. I don’t advise joining any nullsec (null security space) corporations as an alpha/new player unless you really know what you want to do and what you’re getting yourself into.
---
There are plenty of highsec or even lowsec corps you can join, or just hang out with, who will help you to learn, and Eve University is one such place that is recommended by many and is a good place to learn.
---
My recommendation however, is Malevelon Roe Industries. They do a lot of high sec/Low sec mission running and are a friendly bunch. They’re located in Pemene and have easy access to both high and low sec. Drop by their Discord and have a chat. They’re a nice bunch and have a wealth of experience.
---
&lt;link here in a sec&gt;
---
Think of Eve as a long game. There is plenty to do and see before you ever dive into null sec or wormholes and so much to learn at a less pressured pace if you take things slowly.
---
Good luck
---
Then make new players safer, or, better losses easier on them. 
---
Making highsec safer for veterans just makes it harder for new players to compete or catch up. Not to mention the game more boring. 
---
CCP has repeatedly made highsec safer, year after year, since about 2012 and activity there has only decreased. New players need some love, yes, but not your typical highsec veteran. They have it too boring/safe already.
---
CCP: Free stuff ? No.
---
Of course, no one is going to force you to stay. However I will say that moon mining is alot more profitable and all that in null
---
how do you report a bot? when I click on a character its just "report isk spammer"
---
I'd be okay with this, but it might not provide as much useful data.
---
Four and a half days without any response or ETA on a response is not really good enough. Maybe attach this thread in an email to the responsible within CCP?
---
Everyone's against rookie griefing. It's even against the EULA. 
---
But making highsec safer isn't going to fix that and worse, it will decrease game activity even further than all the other highsec safety buffs already have.
---
I am not deciding that. I am not againts all suicide ganking either. I am againts newbie griefing dude. Which directly affects new player retention rate. Go kill that hauler who is carrying 2b worth of loot and auto piloting, if you want. Don't care. But people like CODE. messing with a lone newbie miner in a procurer and griefing him to the point of not allowing him to mine even in high sec is the problem here.
---
Something is wrong when your actions unavoidably pileup the cue.
---
If during the Blackout you kindly recommend everyone still having issues with chat to submit a ticket, well THIS happens!  
---
People who pay should receive expedite service, not a face slap pointing a cue pileup, Dear.
---
Unless it changed within the last 60 days, yes, that part of the combat agent tutorial is still there. They even give you a ship to lose so you don't cry and quit.
---
Hmm I think kuddos is earned when it comes to there support team and ticket response I had filed a few tickets in the past and some was operator error (me) and CCP support team was always good , nice gm,s and good response time etc etc 
---
No complaints from me on this topic.

This is reddit, not a court of law.  I'm only subject to Texas Bird Law, which requires no actual proof - just a massive schlong and a great head of hair (both of which I possess). I'm sorry friend, but the Judge and Jury have decided.  To quote Aloe Blacc, "I'm the man."
---
This is the only way to win Eve....
---
He didn't ask to be jumped ahead, he asked for CCP to actually contact him in a timely manner, or at least bother to send an automated message.  That *shouldn't* require jumping him ahead, but it does **because of the inadequate staffing.**
---
That is a proper review. He mentions that he played the game for a long time but seen most of its issues which are not resolved after years of player base reporting them. Classic CCP. 1 step forward 2 step back.
---
Their purpose is to protect. Otherwise they would not get there in the moment of crime. Just because they are slow to scene does not mean their purpose is to punish only. If you can survive long enough, concord comes in and rescues you. So, it protects.
---
Okay, usually im fine with bait posts but you have crossed the line now.
---
Until the tax hike goes into effect at least.
---
Kinda does. You can spin your character around really fast. Another great boredom time waster when waiting for content.
---
If you make them islands I think you need to make about 7 different routes to get to those other high sec islands. This will allow for options to get through instead of a choke point that is gate camped 23.5/7
---
The same way bots do, a screen reader.
---
don't play alone, PvE is a bit lame. Standard answer is to join one of the big nullsec (PvP space) player groups and head into deep space. This gets you lots of assistance from people that play and is more fun &amp; money than solo in hisec (semi-protected from PvP space). 
---
     
---
Look into Brave, Horde, RedvsBlue, or Karmafleet. All good, just different flavors of "get you ready to help our side in the forever war".
---
Implied. Hard rule against griefing specifically in starter systems also implictly states that griefing is allowed elsewhere
---
&gt; server works fine
---
Its still the most important one brainiac.
---
Who gives a shit? Blood Raiders use armor, right? And they're Amarr-ish? Amarr a slavers. Slaves. It's fine.
---
We don’t know what right now is cause the new regulation is so new.
---
I could point out the obvious irony here... but what's the point? 
---
I give up. 
---
You win, I'm unsubbing all 50 accounts.
---
Are you talking with injectors? month or two I fit up five rorquals for about 8bil a piece
---
CCP's actually come out repeatedly and said that ganking is an allowed form of emergent gameplay.
---
Join Goonswarm
---
You can't really avoid if the ganker really wants you dead, that's the point. It all comes down to having enough DPS before Concord comes in. Which is fine. But newbies should have a ease in period. If your only option to avoid ganking is to not mine in high sec or not undocking, then are you even playing the game?
---
&gt; I hope you guys could speed things up for **\*\*\***\***this\*\*\*\*** case
---
mmhmmm
---
This guy is not getting reps next time hes on an op
---
To V-3 max, but that's when the constant bio breaks start because people develop IBS.
---
I like to gank in highsec - what gives YOU the right to "force" me not to?  You keep talking about the sandbox.  Eve's a sandbox you say.  Except when someone kicks over your sandcastle.  Then you want the right to dictate how they play.  You can't use it as a sword and shield.  It's either a sandbox and you adapt to it, or it's not a sandbox and you should stop saying that.
---
Sure but Cruiser V is going to take over a month. It may not be long term in the grand scheme, probably 2 to get it all together? but I bet it feels like it now at 1 month in.
---
I always found that anything 1 month out was really more like 3-4, just because it was hard to devote all my training to one path when there are so many low hanging fruit. 
---
but, if any training is worth a month or two, T3C is definitely it; talk about a multi-tool.
---
At least next time start to cap boost and align soon as you land, so when your siege is off, either you will auto align to a safe or you will have enough cap to jump away
---
Balls, that's lame, but I guess that's fair.  I've seen lots of other games allow certain information to be read, like, for example, iRacing allows you to read out things like tachometer and speedometer readings so they can connect real tachometers and speedometers to their computers for that little extra simulation immersion.  I was hoping we'd be able to read some information to be able to do something similar.
---
Perhaps my dream may not be realistic then.  I want a fun peripheral, not something that's potentially going to cross the lines of botting territory.
---
Who said anything about war decs? This is about suicide ganking dude. Stay on point please. You even get a announcement and all time notification/alert when you are in war.
---
Being all the way serious, and please note I'm not tech savvy but I'm almost certain that what you described (getting game statuses to display externally in a "snapshot" fashion) is against the EULA in some way. Much as you couldn't use software to enlarge one part of many windows and display them in a grid like fashion (such as your capacitor as an example) so that you could full screen Netflix until trouble happened. That might be what this original comment was keying in on. 
---
I personally love the idea tho! Long as it's within rules ofc :)
---
&gt; Of course he isn't. Because he no longer plays due to a ~~griefing~~ PVP mechanic. 
---
This definitely should be a thing, like 1 large injector every few days
---
Yeah, your overlay proves they don't even share the same profile. Thanks!
---
Look at my subreddit history, you moron. I post in this sub, and not Star Citizen's.
---
I am fine with that idea.
---
"While CONCORD forces do react quickly and with force, they do not have a mandate to protect attacked players and as such will not necessarily be able to prevent eventual losses if attackers can field sufficient firepower to destroy their targets before CONCORD can intervene. CONCORD should therefore be regarded as a force of retribution, not one of protection."
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203208902-CONCORD
---
Answer your own question.  Gankers are players who play a different way than you.  Who are YOU to decide who should play, and how they should play?  Why is your opinion any more valid than theirs?
---
No asshole. You pay CCP for the pleasure of playing their game. Some of us pay multiple months in advance and waiting a month for resolution of a problem preventing you from using what you paid for could be considered theft. Some have multiple accounts paid well ahead. 
---
I'm not having an issue myself right now but what if i do one day in the future? Will my hobby come to an end for a month because of horrible response times?
---
I felt like I'd heard that I didn't want to say it in the off chance that they had not ever explicitly said anything

&gt; Elite dangerous is vast and...pointless.
---
Best way i've heard it put is like Skyrim.
---
Vast as a giant galaxy, as deep as a puddle.
---
I'm directly relating my personal experience of losing a coveter in highsec to someone who would, in most games, be considered a griefer. Is that not on topic?
---
Of course not, that would be a silly thing to assume. I wonder how people even got the idea that this was your intention after you specifically excluded covert cynos.
---
Hey there, i don't know you, have we been introduced?
---
Granted, that was years back. I don't know if NC., Or any other Nullsec Bloc follows the same agenda
---
Huh, it's not every day that you see Waffles, Test and Init on the same side of the battle report.
---
That's a fair point.  I hadn't considered that you could use such a thing to blind rat, though I was just considering ship status, not so much local (for example, though now a defunct example), and didn't think about the possibility of blind ratting if you had a separate display with your ship's hull, armor and shield levels, for example.  
---
I appreciate the support, though I'm starting to think I can only make an input device.  That's still cool enough on its own, but I wanted to take it the next step further.
---
dammit. I clicked.
---
Yes only input my baby, and you cannot duplicate, simulate or "simulcast" inputs, keep that in mind. 
---
Now if you wanna take a real chance and your switch per se is all hardware NO DIGITAL, you can indeed broadcast your inputs like that, but be sure you CAREFULLY read the eula section that addresses actual Hardware Keyboard Switches.
---
You can do that now in 90% of eve systems.
---
It may take up to 3 month before you will get any reply from support. 
---
Falcon and Darwin just do their PR "damage control" job here. Don't hope it will speed things up.  
---
Source - personal experience.
---
so your law makers are passing laws they didn't read and don't understand AGAIN?
---
"The logs show nothing"
---
You would leave against anything you can't win against. Thats the point of a dualweb fit :) grow a pair and commit to a fight.
---
no, its not, its you out right saying nerf the other guys play-style so I can get risk free drops without any chance of a counter drop.
---
Do *not* go buy an expensive ship with it.
---
Either use it to buy some PLEX (while it's cheap) and stash that or just move it to another account/character so you don't blow it. Like another poster said, treat it like a security blanket to supplement your current activities. If you find a good way to make money dip into it as an investment to jump start that process.
---
This environment already exists, it's called wormholes and high sec. Those that like either two are loving it and staying.
---
Oh, I in no way want to try to even skirt the rules, but I appreciate your advice on that.  If I'm not the one flying the ship and I have my hardware device doing it, it feels cheap.  What's the point of playing if you're just gonna push a button and let the system do the rest?  That's no fun at all.  I just wanna make a pushbutton on a panel input into the computer as though it were any other keyboard key, which seems absolutely fine, as far as I can tell.
---
he got better
---
"still the potential" and "very much so in highly populated areas" were key points in my dscan point (above). If you're disputing that I don't see it. Otherwise, I do agree with you there will be workarounds for isolated systems.
---
On my first point I disagree and hold with my argument, with a minor word drop and further explanation. One can ~~easily~~ differentiate between software-derived actions and a human, ironically using software. And no need to slow the server running advanced algorithms all the time, across the board. Just a simple d-scan counter *could* be a useful starting filter, to then focus more rigorous detection. Granted we have some 'special' people playing this game, but how many times in a full day, or week, can you press "V" or the spacebar?
---
I think CCP is making bold moves that will *reduce* botting (using the terms killing, or eliminating have correctly not been in their statements). The blackout will force bots to hit d-scan, a detectable action. Bots will need to move (more so) into isolated systems. Alpha botting has been made more difficult with the VNI changes. Add some new detection mechanisms (and resource depletion?) and ratting bots will have been hurt.
---
Next, mission bots, explo bots, market bots.........
---
&gt;This environment already exists, it's called wormholes
---
The same argument that's used against blackout? :D
---
Ofcousrse they are jumping less, you are teleporting across the galaxy with WHs.
---
How is this so fucking hard to see?  Because you use them?
---
There is a fun bias called the 'dunning kruger' effect, and in a similar vein, people are usually unable to tell when a system is in their favor, because it requires a realistic evaluation of themselves.
---
Just a little
---
Offer something they can't get elsewhere. 
---
And have something in common beyond 'we're in the same corp'
---
Blops/blops bridging is maybe 5% of the stuff I do in Eve, if that... way to make a stupid assumption.
---
" Blopsing and bombing don't make up much of how I play "

literally a nerf the other guys playstyle so mine is OP thread.
---
Imagining... Oh, that's funny. Now...
---
Imagine we discussed medium auto-cannon in a threat about medium A/C.
---
Look, I know you hate where caps are. Great. there are a hundred cap threads a week for that.
---
Every law is tested in court. Especially such large ones in new fields that previously were mostly unregulated. 
---
Do you think all motoring laws happened over night?
---
chances are there is some logs in there that show locally.
---
screen reading in itself isn't really botting, its just having inputs be automated that is botting.
---
Drink
---
As I said...
---
&gt;I'd be okay with this
---
The problem is that blops would be utterly useless without cynos whereas caps would just be less useful, I'm not sure that switching off an entire ship class for a month would be a great idea.
---
We all like witty slogans and roleplaying at cat ear girls.
---
Sorry, I don't follow, is that a statement for or against capitals in low?
---
Huh. I wonder if it screwed up my defaults last reinstall and that's why I'm still getting bad blackscreen lag on an SSD. I'm going to test this, you may have just doomed more miners to logoff traps.
---
Get ready for the corp invites... consider joining a smaller alliance where you can actually be someone and hopefully not have raging idiots yell at you because you don’t know something yet
---
Director of 150 man corp amd the best advice i can give is always do whsts best for the Corp and it's members and be transparent. Tell your members where the funds go, ask if people wanna get involved in running the corp e.g mining director and get them to organise mining ops so everyone can do stuff together.
---
Give feedback to your members, if they have been super active and getting kills, or taking up responsibilities within the corp woth a mail. We do this by having a corp monthly update that's posted on discord and eve mailed to everyone.
---
The most important thing, have fun, if you enjoy what you do others will too.
---
Fly safe
---
O7
---
True.  If I figure something out, I may end up contacting CCP to see if they can weigh in on my idea before implementing it.  IF I can figure out a way to get it to work.  Seems unlikely right now, but like you said, there may be something, though if the botters are using screen reading, chances are that's by far the best option since they seem like they'd be always on the cutting edge of that topic.
---
" Do you think all motoring laws happened over night? "
---
 Boy are you grasping at straws to defend your made up theory based on laws that apparently are so new no one knows what will actually happen if someone decides to try and enforce them.
---
can we just delete eve for a month and call it a day
---
Ok better not have posison
---
Let me know if it helps your issue!
---
The hard part is not adding the button, it's making the button *do* something :)
---
So If I can dig up zkill metrics that show more ISK in ratting losses per capita than c5 dread losses per capita, will you resign from the CSM?
---
I for one am looking forward to seeing the new River, and it's t2 version. Come on CCP get the ball rolling.
---
Knew it was fake after "CCP commits to a date"
---
Against capitals. When every lowseccer outside fw can and will drop supers on anything that comes into their space it makes it less fun. In null people at least escalate but in low it's like frigate tackles other frigate, cyno lit, supers on grid
---
I can't wait to see next year's
---
Yes input as long as it is not duplicated, simulated, or in any way simulcast to my limited knowledge is fine! :) have fun Capsuleer
---
As I said it's not fully fleshed out. Its definitely not a fix all and everyone commenting seems to be looking past that part. I see a lot of posts about fixing null and fixing high and fixing this and that but no real solutions
---
&gt; do we really need a thread on this literally every time the chat acts a bit wonky?
---
Have you ever been here before?
---
You're either blind or retarded.  I'm sorry, it must be hard to go through life like that and I shouldn't be picking on the disabled.
---
I didn't realize you could blops bridge a Curse...
---
You poor bastard you!
---
You kidding? I need at least a jigger of posison before I run a fleet
---
I know it so blatant and cringe. The guy need to put this effort in to learning how to edit.
---
life’s better on the edge 😎
---
First - whatever time was wasted because of this is to be reimbursed, Second - if your life quality depends on Eve so hard, you make it wrong. And third - I pay 3 accounts yearly since 2011, and yes I've come across similar issue in the past. I don't need you to explain me what I pay for. I consider service and the game decent for the money it costs me. If you think opposite you are not obligatory to pay for it, no need to be such an arrogant jerk.
---
:(

Same here, it took me a few years a the biomassing of one of my room, to get positive.

That is besides the point, you know-it-all chucklefuck. You need to improve your basic reading comprehension skills if you are going to call anyone a "retard". ;)

---
&gt; basically, it's a glorified keyboard but a little snazzier.
---
Eve is one of the programs that accepts inputs from the F13 through F24 keystrokes. Lots of room there for unique key inputs from your controller, rather than just rehashing inputs that can be done via the primary keyboard :)
---
As for viewing heat / module status etc, that data isn't made available outside of the client.
---
But no worries. We are all in the same deep shit now. Welcome to the club bro ;)

:3
---
You were in a bomber fleet after saying you don't do bombing a lot. Bringing a curse to a bomber fleeting is  still going around bombing people.

But if you would rather talk about just blops capable ships you flew for kills ok:

This is still a nerf the other guys counter play to my cloaky fleets thread.
---
But still needs investigation
---
Oh, INTERESTING!  I did not know that was even a thing, so today I learned!  Neat!  I'll definitely keep that in mind.
---
As for the reading of data, I'm pretty much conceding on that point now.  It seems like my dream may be dead on that one, which is fine since it's shown on screen anyway.
---
The first 2 are stuka fleets... unless CCP put covops cloaks on kikis, no, they weren't blops fleets either. My point is that 3 of the 4 fleets you pointed to as examples did not use a covops cyno, so no, it doesn't affect my playstyle very much if you nerf covops cynos.
---
It does seriously affect Bomber's Bar and a bunch of small corps/alliances that make all their plays around blops. Does anyone seriously think covops cynos are a problem?
---
You can't. You don't know how much is being farmed by C5 dreads. I know how much is being mined/ratted in Delve.
---
Everybody Hates Bots
---
But yourself some implant so you will faster.
---
Make a plan on what you want to fly next (while fit). But not too expressive - you will be loosing 200mln isk ships pretty soon.
---
Train for it.
---
But it and have fun.
---
1bln is not that big a sum off money. Spend some and save some until you figure out what you want to do in-game.
---
CCP also said that more than %90 of new players quit the game in the first month. Do you really take CCP as a basis for being right and know it all?
---
That rule is not even mentioned in the game. How is that even implied?
---
I've actually tried offering a few legitimate contracts there when I had to sell off a few of my ships and didn't want to repackage the rigs.
---
Still wondering how many people blocked me without looking.
---
Brb renaming all of my salvager ships to “donut phantom”
---
What you like does directly ruins someone elses game. Which makes it different from other activities. I go to null sec to pvp, and if I die I don't bitch about it because I agree to it. A new player wanting to mine in high sec does not agree to griefed where it is not suppose to happen in the first place.
---
So all npc crap apart from staging stuff and pirate missions 
---
Deklein great for sec status
---
Drones isolated but crap ratting
---
Stain used to be great for faction spawns then it got nerfed so now its crap
---
Vale/tribute/geminate good for highsec 
---
Venal once good for pvp content until CCP removed the gate to it.  Great for pirate missions
---
Providence good cos of NDRS so anyone can live there as long as you're a good boy
---
Delve enough said,  needs more low sec gates to it for too protected IMO
---
Branch nice sec status systems and isolated sort of
---
Insmother, Immensea etc good for Angel Rats I like Angel's but Meh space wise
---
Curse used to be great for.PVP Staging now Meh like  all NPC regions
---
@CCP_Falcon, even with the blackout crapt my chat channel shouldn't change like 30 times in 30 minutes. It's been fucked all weekend just like every one else's. Maybe it's time to pull someone logs or possibly retire the hamsters you have powering the chat server. I think the hamsters are on life support in their wheel.
---
Yes they will be camped.     
---
People will try to sneak, smuggle stuff.     
---
Smarter people will run JF service moving stuff between islands.      
---
You will find people willing to patrol this single choke point so others can move.     
---
But this will make all areas flourish again as there will be no only one option to operate near jita.         
---
There will be more place for more people to grow and operate ^(you cannot grow and operate 30j from jita and compete with people 5j from it)
---
why would alpha's be a priority?
---
wow, maybe a priority should be given to this? if this ever occurs to me ill just uninstall/unsub as CCP doesn't seem concerned with resolving in a timely manner. sorry but just reading the responses here from CCP took away any patience I could have had for this situation. maybe all that sub money folks pay should go to answering a major support ticket in respectable amount of time, maybe im just crazy xD
---
I wouldn't have been half as excited if not for the blackout. 
---
A couple of years ago, I totally decided that eve would need to do something like get rid of local in null to be interesting again. Never thought it would happen. Not ever.
---
It felt like...holy shit....maybe anything is possible.
---
But why do you want to fine someone for PVP in a PVP oriented game like EVE?
---
It only ruins someone else's game if they let it.  I remember dying very early on in lowsec.  So new I didn't realize I was in lowsec.  I lost everything I had because I flew something I couldn't afford to lose.  Guess what?  I loved it.  It got me hooked on the game and I came back for more.  It's a sandbox.  You consent to PvP any time you undock and leave a starter system.  The player who is mining out there agreed to be available for interactions with other players.  If you don't want to interact, don't undock.
---
&gt;greater risk as nullbears
---
That this set of words makes me laugh is more of an issue than anything in HighSec.
---
There is nothing against killing a newbie procurer mining in a 0.9 system. Sure concord kills you. But is it enough to stop a billionaire suicide ganker getting his enjoyment from ruining others gameplay?
---
Looks like bots to me.
---
Not sad at all, it is content nonetheless. CCP makes money, person who wanted that rorq is happy that they have that ship now. Probably not happy after losing it. The person piloting isn’t skilled enough for it, but it still delivers content for both parties.
---
Let's just get this over with - your entire post history is crying about how bad ganking is.  Just link the lossmail where you went afk in a shitfit barge, or you got popped carrying Plex in a T1 hauler.  We'll all laugh at you, you'll rage quit, and we can all move on with our day.

---
I don't disagree with this viewpoint.  What I think we can all agree on is the NPE is shit.
---
So which metric interests you then? Nobody said anything about removing pvp?
---
As someone who does IRL contracting. Contracts are changed all the time.. just my .02
---
Do you mean something like “chaos“?
---
notice it was init that died to the bots, not me ;)
---
Thank you for your comments, coming with a CSM-induced perspective adds merit to the discussion.
---
For clarification, in my above post when I said safer regarding high sec I meant relative as it is today to low/null/j-space, not making changes to high sec risk. I'm not advocating making high sec a kindergarten. I do believe the risks in 'high' sec should be better explained to newcomers, though.
---
It is the reward side that is out of whack, specifically for low. Low just doesn't have much of a place in the mix. Right now it seems the majority of those that do leave high sec do so for null. However, to make low more desirable you likely have to nerf high and null rewards. I don't see it as forcing people out of high (or null). They can choose to chase more reward, or not.
---
And war-time capitals in low to me ruins any hope of having a substantial, sustainable low sec. There is no 'land' to claim or space to invade (really). Why does low need such tools, other than for seal clubbing? Low should be different from both null and high. If not, you're carving idea is the way to go. Chop it out.
---
On the plus side, the blackout in null has differentiated low somewhat.
---
Because one is ruining someones game just for shits and giggles, other is not. I have never even stated that suicide ganking should be removed and you are already bitching like game would die.

Came here just to say you have a fantastic name.
---
It is changed in the last 60 days, yes. Try again.
---
Being a ceo, especially if you are null sec is a totally different game then you currently play. 
---
You needs people that trust you and will follow you, not many but they are needed to get a corp off the ground. Be unique, look at each corp in PH, every one has a purpose. Weather it is to be the same language or to have the same play style, all your corp mates need a common interest.
---
Give your players a home, weather it is a wh or a null sec system every one needs a place to log off and night.as well as a central location for your corp mates.
---
Politics politics politics, as i said ceos play a diffrent game. Get use to barging with other CEOs for diplo resons. Corp mates will not stick around if being in your corp is a up hill battle. Things like blue citidels for jf to jita need to organized. That means you corp needs to provide value to other corps that will want to be your friend.
---
Just because the person cried on reddit doesn't make their case more important than anyone else's, regardless of the staffing situation.
---
If you don't adapt, you will die.  Repeatedly.  It's James 315's will.
---
You can go pvp in low, null and wh. Nobody is againts that. You grief a rookie in high sec and he is not coming back, period. Try to have some sympathy for other people living in the world, if you can.
---
The Goons ruin plenty of people's games all the time.  It's their unofficial motto.  Nobody's banning goons.  You know who ruins MY game? AFK highsec miners watching Netflix on another screen.  Let's remove them, since they make me mad.
---
Haven't heard of CODE. Do they like torpedos?
---
Restrict char2char trade or possibly any market interaction until account has 2fa. This practice is getting common in online games as I can see it.

Some people seem to like the idea of permadeath in game.
---
Of course only for others.

---
What about force recons or any ship with a cloak? What about any friendly who is doing something in something that isn’t predefined (e.g. running a ded site in a tengu)? or travel ceptors?
---
Thanks for the clarification -  we agree on that point.
---
I view low sec *war-capable* capital use akin to nothing other than seal clubbing.
---
Via con dios, friend.
---
The only way to win is to not play.
---
You don't want the answers.
---
Well obviously you'd remove supers from low
---
Maybe not you, but do you represent all high sec gankers?
---
They're phallic shaped, so most likely.
---
Then you can be a pirate in null, low  and wormhole space. Literally more than %90 of the game space combined.
---
Tip for playing eve: don't
---
&gt;If your only option to avoid ganking is to not mine in high sec or not undocking, then are you even playing the game?
---
Or you could fly properly tanked Procurers (with orca reps?). You could set known local gankers red and safe up when they're around. Have a friend/corp that will throw a new venture at you ("rich" friends are awsome to have). You could move systems if it's too hot where you are in HS. You could mine on an Athonor, where you would most likely see the ganker MWDing toward you. You could park an RLML Caracal in the belt with your miners, to 2-3 shot through those untanked, likely criminal sec status Catalysts. Hell, a cheap venture pays itself back in 1-1.5 load(s) of veldspar, maybe it's just a cost of doing business. 
---
Alot of things could be done to counter gankers, but none of them have to do with CCP changing the fundamental nature of the game. And hell, even if I'm not a fan of it, CCP does warn players and I presume they do ban them for shitting around in starter systems.
---
I dream of a day eve is filled with these fleets. Fun engaging fleet compositions, not meant to be 100% k/d ratio and going away from the meta everyone else is using. Keep it up!

---
It's a mutual relationship.  If you aren't getting anything out of your corp, find a new one that suits what you want.
---
Eve is a long term game, be ready to still be playing this in 6 months or years. This is not scary if you take a brake you skill que keeps chugging along even when you are logged out. Do be afraid to play a diffrent some times, unlike other mmos you are not rewarded for playing every second of every day.
---
This game has layers, every thing you do can be optimised. Start simple, do the high sec missions. Then join a alliance to help you work out the rest of the game. Eve uni, brave, pandemic horde all are alliance which put newbeans first. Just remember you can leave any time but find a small corp is harder as you need to find guys you enjoy playing with. Take your time and enjoy the ride.

Only 157 unique characters under 30 days old have been recorded as PvP-killed in highsec since ~8/1 (I'm pulling killmails from zkill's redisq but I reset my local db around then so it's probably a little light around the start point).
---
That's not just ganks, either, that's any kind of kill.
---
The median total loss value per character is 2.8m.
---
A truly profound number of these characters have names consisting of a random keyboard mash first name and an Eve auto system surname (likely bots), e.g., "jjdfsger Viliana".  They also make up the majority of the loss value.
---
Of the top 30 by loss value, more than half use this format.

There is literal picture proof of plagiarism.
---
Undeniable, irrefutable, proof.
---
If they are capable of plagiarism once, then all their work is suspect. The Venture/Vulture "debate" is case and point.
---
&gt; I don’t advise joining any nullsec (null security space) corporations as an alpha/new player unless you really know what you want to do and what you’re getting yourself into.
---
Agreed.
---
OP should find a "smallish" HighSec corp to learn the ropes.  
---
Jumping straight into Null as a first-time alpha is a pretty fucking stupid idea.
---
This idea is the antithesis of chaos.  CCP says 'no.'
---
In case of recons/ships with cloack - you are as fucked up against those as any other player. Bots have only one advantage that they can instantly warp when something show up on OV.         
---
Remember that bots are never safe, they need to just generate more profits than costs.
---
It's always fucked. It's the age if chaossssss
---
Dammit the real onion doing this is bad enough, but this hurt, man.
---
People's easy of communicating is only getting better, also people use of plying new games is getting better.  People want games that value there time and if it doesn't then off to the next free to play game.
---
whoever made those fittings in the guide should be slapped in the face. Up to meta 4 equipment is not significantly more expensive or even costs are the same (with some exceptions) giving you equivalent or higher bonuses with less drawbacks. A single word on wide spread availability of up to meta 4: either start your char as caldari or amarr or travel to domain / the forge in order to access the biggest trade hubs in New Eden. Also a word on ammo: if there is some range modification through ammo buy those(short range, medium range, long range), if there is damage types(fit accordantly against the enemy type). Just because it says standard, the given fit only applies to certain situation and a certain scenario. So your upgrade path is to skip meta 1 entirely, move up to meta 4 (at least meta 2 in some circumstances) and then upgrade to meta 5 (also known as Tech II).  
---
Every time I see those meta 1 fits on zkillboard my heart starts bleeding. 
---
It's bad to teach those absolute emergency fits to people who are gonna use them as standards not understanding where the difference lies.
---
I've received q lot of free stuff over the past 10 years. Some of it i didn't even quality for, but seemed to apply anyway.
---
Bruh chats been broken since last friday. CCPLS, I just want to be in one system, not 3 at the same time.
---
I'm still learning the curves so to speak, but I enjoy doing pve, rat farming... and stuff like that.
---
&gt;No, because it was never free to begin with. That intel was gained by a pilot putting their own ship at risk. What they do with it is up to them.
---
But it becomes free when it is made publicly available.
---
&gt;TIL that killing a ship is doing nothing specific. What other oddities exist in this world beyond the looking-glass, where black is white, and victory condemned as defeat?
---
You are getting intel on modules that were destroyed. This is added by the game.
---
&gt;Why does a ship leave a wreck when it is destroyed then, following this logic?
---
Because the salvage and non-destroyed modules.
---
&gt;No, the 'limit' I was talking about is again, the victor keeping the details of their ship hidden. Historically, destroyed + recovered technology from an opposing force is studied in great detail. I see no reason why it should be different here.
---
But Im talking about the actual kill. You get all relevant intel on this. It is not limited.
---
&gt;Then play better and don't lose your Top Secret fit. Autistically screeching about "muh privacy" when your ship is strewn about the battlefield like articles of clothing at a swinger's convention afterparty is moot.
---
Why isnt it a problem that people look up your ships and fits and make decisions based on that?
---
&gt;So let's turn it around. Why do you feel that the person destroying your ship doesn't deserve to know what they destroyed?
---
If it stayed there that might be okay, but it doesn't. It is almost always released publicly and other players look up your ships and fits and use that against you or just avoid the fight which means less content.
---
&gt;In this game of limited effective combinations of modules, little variation in damage output numbers, and static attributes on ships, why does it matter so much that your precise combination of modules remain secret 
---
If you can see what weapon type someone is likely using, that is a big deal, but there are many other things like gang size, etc.
---
&gt;to the point of dictating to the playerbase at large what they can and cannot do?
---
Because that released intel affects that player's content in the future.
---
Join a Corp the players are your best resource for learning the game
---
I'll admit I was edging until I saw the domain.
---
There's no known wormholes into the office, but you can stand outside the front door with one of those giant bubble wands to make bubbles with. Then  when people ask what the hell you're doing, tell them you're gate camping

---
So we're all imaging the last few days problems?
---
Odd that CODE seems to have such a bad reputation in EVE. I’m pretty new to the game but I come from Elite Dangerous where I think most people actually enjoy getting pulled over by CODE. They’re a lot of fun in that game. What gives here?
---
*insert skill injector*
---
&gt; Syndicate Cons:
---
&gt;     Only has one named system
---
Still a pro.
---
\&gt;suggests switching off multipe entire ship classes
---
\&gt;*"I'm not sure that switching off an entire ships class for a month would be a great idea"*
---
I think it would make sense to have those systems be more obvious to new players (&amp; vets tbh) rather than having a support article about it.  Perhaps a map filter or a pop-up when they leave the system similar when you first enter LS?
---
I've contacted CCP, let's see what they have to say to this...
---
You know, I haven’t played in over a year. I think my figures are definitely outdated by now... smh
---
Thank you all for the replies, but what's a DED site?
---
Is it a combat anomaly? Because I've been doing those, well not much anyway.
---
Yeah, to me $350 is a crapton of cash.  To others it is pocket change.  Also, to me 35 billion isk is again, a crapton of isk. But to a botter or longtime player, it is chump change.
---
I'll be working on that, thnks!
---
I can PVP anywhere because that's the game. Better to educate players on the actuality of the game as is than try to change it into something it isn't.
---
The correct spelling is "shithat" if you have ever needed to maintain a POS there"
---
HAW is many large AC bundled up tho
---
Join a very large corporation. I like that I get the attention of fellow corpporation members.
---
But what about Jita? Where will Mr. Big-FW-Guy go if he can't suicide gank leopards as they undock to pad his lackluster zkb stats?
---
Honestly, at this point I almost don't *want* logi on killmails. People obsess over their killboards too much as it is. Keeping people alive is its own reward, you shouldn't need the game giving you a 1/4 cent gold star sticker to validate you.
---
Well, he just said he wanted to give me a headstart, idk about money laundering...
---
You can't protect idiots from themselves. Why try?
---
OK, maybe there should be an in-game dialog when a 1st-day char hits the 5-mil SP diminishing-returns point saying "Looks like you might be trying to Pay 2 Win! It won't work!" But would the subject of this killmail have been deterred?
---
They mostly exploit the way concord (police) react to kill people flying expensives ships in high sec. 
---
The only real way to protect yourself is by not flying expensive ships, what can be saw as a game stopper for some people.
---
Added to that they really like bumping, they will collide with mining ships to get them out of mining range. You can’t do anything against that except trying to go somewhere else (but they will most likely follow you) or disconnect for the day.
---
TL;DR : you can adapt your game style to protect yourself, but you cannot fight back
---
Suicide gank occurs very rarely imo. I have never been ganked in hs and I'm playing since 3 years. I play with a friend and he got ganked once... I think eve has bigger problem than this.
---
What's RMT?
---
StainGuys combat probes would actually work vs force recons
---
Alternative/additional chaos option: 
---
All ships jump to the sun of their target system instead of to the beacon.
---
yes
---
I always assume good news is just eve onion clickbait when I see a thread on it.
---
so the easiest thing to do is hunt in the same ships as your targets  
---
the best way to disrupt a combat probe bot: leave a rookie ship at a safe
---
Cloaks, ceptors, and Combat Recons can all catch ships that rely on dscan. 
---
There's so many ways to catch those ships than there were ways to catch ships that relied on local. Bots can try to adjust, but more will die and botting itself will become far less common.
---
Thanks for the replies all.. guess I'll be patient. I replied to my own ticket so that makes sense
---
Don't play solo. The learning curve sucks without friends. Also understand that you will die. And you will suffer loss. That's why this game is awesome. Try everything at least twice.
---
arent you the one who bombed the init dude though?
---
&gt; CCP claims thats dying is good for retention rates.
---
It was in my case. First time I was ganked, I was like "WTF, how did that happen... and how can I do it?"
---
Never got very good at it but up to that point, the game was starting to get boring and I might well have left after just a few weeks.
---
List of things eve needs to be healthy :
---
-Make caps useful only against the same size capital ship, they should be nearly useless against anything bigger or smaller than them
---
-make sure only a small amount of players can rat in a specific system, people need to be way more spread out instead of living all under the same umbrella
---
-revamp sov somehow to give people a very good reason to fight and conquer regions instead of not fighting. Make it progressively easier for attackers and harder for defenders the more space you own
---
Last one might be hard to figure out, but even with just the first two the game would be in such a better state.
---
Then enforce it.
---
the number on their corp history page is too small ;~;
---
Welcome to the suck! Embrace it :)
---
IDK if "gatekeeping" is really the way to think about this.
---
I started after the learning skills were gone, so I didn't have to walk 10 miles to school through blizzards (uphill both ways!) everyday to get into my first cruiser, but by the time I trained into it I had at least some idea about how to stay alive in space.
---
For a game like this making people wait some wall-clock time before getting into a ship they can't possibly know how to use doesn't smell like "gatekeeping" to me, it's more like "not handing the 16-year-old the car keys, a fifth of bourbon, and a quarter of coke." It eliminates traffic hazards.
---
Wormholes are the best place to live. 
---
All those people asking you to join Horde or Karmafleet, Brave Newbies or (god forbid) Dreddit just want another body for their great null sec empires. They don't really care about YOU they just care that you're another number to add to their massive fleet to order you around and tell you what to do and where to go.
---
Make friends early, they will help you and teach you. But also don't trust anyone. Like 90% of people in EVE are out to screw you. Luckily most of them are in Goons, so just avoid anyone in Goons. I mean they aren't called Goons because the're nice to people.
---
Laughs in no friends
---
No it will not.     
---
Because it will be harder for normal player because player react slower.     
---
Don't get me wrong - this actually killed super boting, as super bots are much easier to tackle now.        
---
But this don't apply to cheap subcapital ratting bots.
---
I can send imaginary ink all day long yo.
---
This is just bullshit, every pvp knows who is new in system, no matter what name starts on
---
&gt;  but you can't stay there forever if you want to earn isk. It's a few islands of safety where newbies learn the ropes, and you can keep your plex stash safe
---
I said it elsewhere. Not all of the people playing the game are interested in leaving HS and are likely to just find something else to play if they can't efficiently grind missions or mine cheap ore. The content they seek isn't the same as the rest of us. Take away all of their content and you're only encouraging higher turnover.
---
Personally, I think there's a fine balance required when talking about retaining players. I would absolutely get rid of HS incursions but much more and it'll probably be doing more harm than good.
---
At least Albion Online is able to handle a local chat.
---
No, we weren't there at the same time afaik
---
Cloud Ring has a cool nebula.
---
Make sense indeed.
---
&gt;LowSec. By removing all the isk activites from high it pushes these industrialist vets into low.
---
The will go to Null not low, because really there is no reason to go to lowsec for you isk making when you can join a newbro farm and rat.
---
&gt; Yeah that's why we remove rorqs from low. On that note we get rid of Supers, faxs, and titans too. This is low not null. You shouldnt be allowed to drop super fleets on every problem.
---
Again this is just gonna push people to join the biggest carebear bloc in NS, preferably with supers so they can escalate to bail you out, it also means non-big bloc titans pilots are fucked massively as there mobility get's massively harmed ( a lot of these travel over lowsec as there often don't have a blue donut in Sov ), you also give a stealth safety boost to jump freighters as they now no longer have to fear getting nyxed. 
---
Like honestly all i see happening is that HS becomes a deader place with just Newbro's and all other people move the NS, and we see more response fleet, leading to less pvp content long term. 
---
LS remains the same just with blopses + legions or loki's as the primary hotdrop platform, with some groups maybe moving to npc null.
---
baited on a free onion
---
I'm not in favor of OPs ideas but you can't possibly be claiming that more than a fraction of kills in HS are the result of actual PVP. The vast majority are unsuspecting pilot rapes, and that's OK. Just make sure you yell "surprise!" first.
---
So just give a dst a cov ops cloak and make blockade runners pointless? Got it
---
Tell me again, how you can expect a newbie to do everything you wrote just now.
---
---   Then you can assume that there are currently no issues from our end right now.
---
Ok  now i relly belive eve is dying lol
---
How is war decs considered a grief. It is an explained mechanic. Game even mentions that  you can die and Concord won't help if you get attacked by the agressors. You lost but you knew before you lost. There is a huge difference you fail to see here.
---
Could a Bowhead work as well?
---
Do you mean like let's blame it on chaos instead of actually fixing our game peoperly?
---
There is a couple books
---
Just make sure you drink it from a bottle.
---
I came here to post this, so take a few updoots instead.   
---
I used to like EvE Onion, and now I don't.  
---
But if this somehow pushes CCP to actually make good on this necessary change, then I will like EvE Onion again.
---
This is terrifying. How do we avoid having this happen?
---
Personally I'd like to see the API system striped down to the absolute bare minimum.
---
Bring back some of the paranoia.
---
Where my entire post history? This post? You are losing your shit dude. If you can't move on with your day that's not my problem. Maybe have a life outside of Eve and reddit? Your only claim is to hope that I lost something to suicide ganking to justify my posting here, even though all I am showing is a recent steam review with tons of upvotes on it.
---
I know 15b isn't a lot, but it sounds better than listing 150b for some reason when I made it.
---
Cans are better
---
They fucked up the lore site....
---
Sure, it was lowsec. Not the point of this post. Use your head. You consent to PvP not in high sec when you have no war dec on your corp. That is what war dec is there for. To PvP in high sec. As long as you are a rookie in a npc corp or in a corp without a structure in space, you should not be easlily griefed by veteran players.
---
yeah, but it's also kinda shit.
---
So can you set it to run 50 copies as one job in this world?
---
Your not forced to but why wouldn't you?
---
CCPls nerf corpses
---
Take 50 mil off the top and spend it all on skillbooks. Inject them all. Train them eventually. All the frigates, all the destroyers, all the cruisers etc., all the guns, all the missiles, all the drones. Eventually you will have a nerf-proof combat char.
---
So you're just talking out of your ass about something you have no experience about and projecting how you think people *must* feel onto people you've never met.
---
Interesting idea, at least you could zone them with bubbles.
---
Sure there are bots, but there also legit players there as you can see. Even one person leaving due to bad gameplay mechanic is a loss by CCP and Eve community. Do you really need a game breaking issue to actually care about an issue in the first place? No matter how little it is, and issue is still an issue and has to be fixed.
---
GOOD LUCK!
---
They aren't. That's the point. You either learn that ships are closer to being ammunition than a fixture in your hanger or you find another game.
---
Scamming is legal and actively encouraged by the devs. Don't give stuff to other people unless you fully trust them and if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
---
But the edited contract isn't a contract until the other party accepts.
---
Eve contracts could probably work that way too, *given sufficient developer time and effort.* Probably not many players would pick this as a high priority issue though.
---
Seriously as a programmer I cannot understand why making chat work as intended takes so much time in EVE.
---
A part of the tutorial should be getting suicide ganked in your newbro ship. Possibly getting podded to the home station or having to dock up in your pod to get into a new corvette.
---
if they werent all on vacation lmao
---
LOL What a douche answer to an ongoing issue.
---
Because It is not PvP. It is griefing. You can't do anything in a procurer against few catalysts. You want PvP? Lİterally the remaining %90 of the game allows you to do that in one way or another. Low, Null, Wormhole even Abyssal to some extent. Being in high-sec where Concord is suppose to protect you but is late to party and only serves to avenge, although it does not really matter because the aggressor actually knew he was gonna die anyway and was ready for it, is no PvP at all.
---
Honestly, at this point in the game's existence, there is no excuse to not start that game fully knowing what you are getting into. 
---
Dozens, if not hundreds of Videos, Articles, Blogs, and Reviews that explicitly explain what goes on in game.
---
Exploration / relic sites, and go have fun with what you have. :)
---
Don't spodbrain too hard. Get out and enjoy the game, t1 frig/destroyer roams are still fun.
---
Of course, but he's paying for the service. They could, at the very least, acknowledge the situation.  Like he said, "hey we're working on it" would be better than nothing.
---
Brutal.
---
Well correct. At that point it'd simply be a solicitation. Which can also be modified.
---
Also correct. This isn't even a huge thing. Just an IRL business thing I can actually comment on since 99% of all the other stuff I'm oblivious to. Lol
---
Make it a turn-off-able warning message that their ship isk value per hit point is high (based on arbitrary Suicide gank thrasher fit price).
---
Purple*
---
Suicide ganking is not PvP. Try to learn what PvP actually means. You are literally killed by the game, not the enemy player. You are shooting at a ship which can not shoot back and you had all the time to prepare to destroy his ship before Concord can even arrive.
---
It doesn't matter if they quit. CCP is making the game they want, if people don't like it, CCP has no obligation to cater to them.
---
I was introduced years ago to CCP games while playing Dust 514 on my Playstation 3.
---
That game made me very interested in Eve Online and as an adult I'd like to know what kind of PC do I need to play Eve Online?
---
I do not have a PC yet. I've only played games on consoles, so I'm maki g the transition to the PC and know nothing. Are gaming peripherals important in Eve similarly to an FPS? 
---
My budget is limited with a baby on the way. Can I play it with a cheap Walmart laptop or should I just save my money and get a nice gaming pc for Christmas?
---
Sorry for all of the questions but there's  a lot about PC AND Eve Online that I don't know about.
---
Awww. Join a corp, make friends!
---
You had 50 suicide ganker accounts?
---
Your posting has gotten worse
---
If you create your account with a Refer a Friend link, you'll get 1,000,000 Skill Points, which will really help. A ton of useful skills take days or a week+ to train, so getting them out of the way at the start really helps make the game more fun (from a new player).
---
Honestly, I'd say its worth starting a new account with the RAF bonus, its worth weeks of time training - more if you're an Alpha.
---
Don't want to spoil to you but most of eve fights is about griefing.      
---
All gatecamps, roams and hot drops is always about getting unexpecing and unprepared player why trying not fall for a trap of someone ready to respond to your actions.             
---
True griefing in EVE is when you deliberately kill a true newbie.       
---
I gank and when by mistake i gank a newbie i give him much more isk than he losed and send email WHAT he did wrong and why he died.
---
&gt; Keeping people alive is its own reward
---
i agree people obsess over killboards too much but being the logi that X's up for ops can mean you fly nearly every day yet have a killboard that is blank except for losses for the last 2 months making you look like a shit pilot despite the fact that if not for you and others like you your alliance would damn near crumble
---
lmao :ccp:
---
chat has been fucked for days
---
You haven't actually made any credible argument that it is an issue.  You seem to be trying to skip past establishing that it's an issue by declaring it so, and then hoping nobody will notice while you head right onto "How to fix this."
---
Declaring that someone encountering some minor challenge in a video game is a systemic problem is a pretty outrageous claim and you're going to have to support it with something other than a link to what is probably your own salty review.
---
You did good!
---
Plz let us know how this story unfolds o/
---
And how many of those losses are new players?
---
How many new players fly anything worth caring about into and out of Jita?
---
The majority of that value comes from idiots flying in expensive ships with needlessly blinged modules or people in big ships carrying too much valuable cargo. 
---
There are too many good targets going in and out of Jita for anyone to give a shit about some new guy in their frigate/barge.
---
Tbh I think I found one friend to play with me :)
---
I think there's something odd happening, I gained access to my accounts after lossing control of my e-mail a while back, took them less than 15 minutes to respond.
---
No, leave it open, just remember it’s all a scam.  “You’ll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy”
---
It's a video game. The only thing that could possibly be damaged is their mommies credit card while buying skill injectors. Besides, y'all eat this stuff up. They are delivering you content, why complain?
---
It's really dumb that so much of this game is locked behind months of wait time. No matter how good of a player you are, you just can't do certain things without watching a timer crawl at a glaciers pace. It doesn't matter how good you are, how much you grind... you're just denied.
---
Then along comes skill injectors which removed the gatekeeping and everyone's panties are in a bunch. Now the cool ships aren't theirs and theirs alone, anyone can get into them provided they can come up with the isk.
---
It's like you guys don't want people to play this game and want to retain an edge over other players forever simply by having subscribed longer.
---
You have a method for dealing with low skill players in game. Blow their credit card ship up then come to reddit and brag about it. No need to gatekeep.
---
Found the CODE. ganker. Now your posts make more sense.
---
I’m more of a Rens guy myself
---
stats are better
---
Goons live in null. They can do whatever they want in null and nobody is against that. High sec is a different matter.  
---
How do they make you mad dude? You have some serious problems. Are you okay? Have you lost someone you love recently? Don't lose hope, seek a friends help.
---
Ishukone/Thukker is lore.
---
Ishukone gave the antidot to SOE and Minmatar for free
---
What would the magic marker be used for huffing?
---
People are entitled to vacation and the company needs to staff with that in mind.
---
Some1 should visit Brave's looting classes.
---
Warps back to wreck, just to leave the most expensive stuff behind.
---
Are you a girl by any chance?
---
? Why does it matter
---
And that folks is why you don't download shady 3rd party software. Stick to the mainstream trusted tools. I would imagine the number of compromised accounts is due to people trying to download botting programs that have keyloggers installed or other such programs.
---
Because 0.01 isk doesn't make actual difference and by not buying it, you can contribute to not supporting that practice.
---
There's no fucking way to win. If you were suicide ganked, you must be whining / complaining. If you weren't, you're talking out of your ass about something you knew nothing about.
---
What do you want him to do? Be in superposition between the two?
---
Why can't you play with people?
---
You're completely wrong of course.  Or rather I should say, you are looking at this from the wrong point of view.  People have options for entertainment these days.  Why would they choose Eve, which made them rage because they lost the fruits of hours of "effort" when they could go and play or do something else?  What compelling reason is there?
---
I only stopped caring about losses in Eve when I finally got ahead and had enough ISK that I didn't need to "strive" in the game to acquire it.  Before then every loss was a setback.  That's also what people in Eve like about it of course.
---
It's not for everyone is it.  It never has been.  So there's that too.
---
The design of the game for the first 13 years (or however long it was before injectors) was "gatekeeping?"
---
I think you just like to use the word "gatekeeping."
---
Go ahead and have the last word if you want.
---
It would also restrict the ability to drop directly into a safe or optimal location in a fight.  No more directly jumping into tether range, no more tightly clustered fleet after jumping into a perfectly defensible situation.
---
R/evejobs is good place to start. Or go join eve university.
---
I hear they are fantastic and they have campus' in each type of space.
---
I have no friends who share the same interests with me
---
It doesn't
---
Yes. But that did.not prevent the rp edgelords from shitting all over the idea of that as a basis for Calmatari faction ships.
---
By friends, they mean in-game, not in real life. Lmao
---
And there are system wide jamming structures. So if you don't want people jumping into your area just take sov and put up the jammers.
---
Ok but no I am not  if for some reason I seem feminine I get that a lot “/
---
Maybe people could stop being dumb dumbs.
---
I mean social problems
---
no idea, by the time i've cycled all my characters through the free skill point machine i'm usually done for the day.
---
the first day was boring as fuck, though, even chain dropping on retards trying to tackle things under the umbrella was as boring as watching paint dry so i'm kinda glad i haven't had to endure much of it and have just been sucking up all the free SP so ccp can pretend that black out isn't pretty much as dull as every other day of the year.
---
Apperantly they do not react quickly enough. In any case, rookies won't care about retribution, they want protection. Any new player will say fuck it and move on which is what is happening..
---
ive been waiting for a way to prove definitely for years a kill was solo only, and logi on killmails is one important step. Ever since I half assed a site that was going to be about solo eve kills and ranks etc.. specifically only to realize you cant actually guarantee a kill was solo because of stuff like logi not showing up etc.
---
Also the volume of the screeching has lowered.
---
MER will tell all....
---
People cried like children in 2006 as well ( when I joined)
---
Support in this game is a joke anytime I have had an issue they take forever to respond and then they tell me that's too bad but we can't do anything to fix anything.
---
The important trait is "has Ship Maintenance Bay?"
---
Might be shit but at least they listen to their customer base.
---
Because victory without adversity is meaningless. And Eve has that in spades.
---
You saying you hate ganking is the same as me saying I hate mining.  They're different playstyles for different people.  Just as you can't imagine ganking being fun or engaging, I can't imagine mining being the same.  But Eve is a sandbox as you keep saying, so we're both free to play the way we see fit.  I know there are miners out there, and you know there are gankers.  We can each take appropriate precautions.  But you dictating how I should play my game is no more correct than me telling you how to play yours.  Eve is what you make of it.
---
&gt; Doesnt mean its not true.
---
Not true....Yet. 
---
Dare to dream, and until then, fit a symbolic pop gun and get good at dropping extra targets. :)
---
I always kind of liked managing both, plus it can get you on even more kill mails, when you "accidently" give it a cycle on your fc :) 1 dmg still counts!
---
Do you enjoy any part of this game at all?
---
Yeah, I want my gold star.
---
I'm not in CODE.
---
Merge and split would be lovely. I mostly build caps, so I like to do concurrent runs, but if run off say 10 x 10 copies, then merge into a 100 run bpc for storage, then resplit back to 10x10 or 5x20 or what ever for the production run, I would be a happy man.
---
wrong, his posting was at its worse when imperium was clearing out tribute, it was void of any intelligence
---
You're mining/hauling in highsec?  Use your head.  You consented to PvP when you undocked.  Use appropriate precautions - tank your ship, use a scout, don't haul what you can't afford to lose, don't haul expensive shit on autopilot, mine aligned.  Every single argument you make can be turned around against you.  Your entire post here is trash.  Just link the damn lossmail so we can all laugh at you already.
---
I added a list of all hiseh islands to my exploration checklist a while ago https://gist.github.com/Dawnkeeper/a6ad0acee3392ed52c21a1b4958251b1
---
He touched briefly on how killboard efficiency is so important. He's so right. How you look on your kb is far too much of an influence in taking fights and it's dumb as fuck. ESI kill info needs to be killed off somehow.
---
In all honesty. Eve feels more dead. Been a 7 year subscriber and i'm cancelling my secondary account. I'll keep my primary subbed but i'm downscaling. Don't know if the blackout has anything to do with it.
---
i think ur just a thin skinned little babbie
---
So you can still solo PVP in EVE, amazing! I thought the game was only a blob fest these later days.
---
The most important thing to do, no matter what advice you take:
---
Have fun.
---
It's just a game. :)
---
I only use logi when my corp does something small, anything else, avoid it like cancer till I get on km's.
---
These are not necessarily insurmountable obstacles given the demographics of this game (there are lots of maladjusted nerds in Eve). I played solo for a long time before joining a corp with reasonably active^1 members to play with, and believe they hype it is a huge difference.
---
^1 As in, out of 100-150 members, there are always a few online when I log in.
---
Hell, now that I think about it, ccp could charge a small small service fee for "licensing validation" or w/e when merging/splitting and create another isk sink in the process.
---
It seems everyone is always posting about frat bots or iron crown bots these days which is true honestly but are we just going to pretend omist doesn't exsist? Or is botting allowed there cause it's test space? Commence downvoting.
---
I appreciate your data analysis - it seems to indicate what I always suspected - ganking of new players is not the game breaking issue OP would argue.  In my experience, most ganks are done for profit and this seems to bear that out.  I'd love to see data on how many new accounts were created in the same timeframe to get an idea of the percentage that even died in highsec.
---
Yes but make it that just capitals can kill other capitals.
---
Emergent gameplay
---
&gt; projecting how you think people must feel onto people you've never met
---
I mean, isn't that what we're all doing on here? He's not wrong, people want to feel that games value their time investment. Though, personally, the only times I felt like quitting was when CCP felt like they were being irresponsible(*cough cough* chat issues), not when I was being retarded in game.
---
This is pretty autistic
---
I guess you’ve found your community
---
Just what Eve needs, more Sov holder /s
---
the blackout is shit, bring back the bugout, was actually fun to carry on my conversation in 1dq as i was shooting VNIs in catch
---
most of it sounds decent but the first change would kill of trying to dreadbomb a titan at all, so you would end up making space significantly safer in the process
---
I hear it runs in the hi sec family.
---
i found inspiration from all these other “good” posts
---
&gt;as a new player  
---
I have a feeling you will fit in greatly
---
While we are going over the little features.... I wouldn't add this on its own, but if they are updating killmails anyway
---
Fireworks deserve special mention in killmails. Perhaps in addition to a list of those who did/prevented damage, there should also be a list of the celebrants who sacrificed high slots to honor those who will die.
---
How about you take a long walk and come back once you make sense?
---
Not really, drones chew up rocks. If you genuinely AFK'd for hours, you'd come back to an orca that has 1/4 of its cargo hold full. At best.
---
Chat is all scammers just delete chat everywhere the player base will be much happier without it.
---
Goons/Test control about 3/4 of the map (GOTG are defacto goon renters at this point) for all practical purposes and could steam role anyone if they wanted to (goons just steamrolled Panfam in tribute, it wasn’t even a contest Panfam couldn’t even get half the numbers goons had most fleets).
---
If they dropped supers goons could probably solo the entire fleet, but just in case Legacy would move during the heavy tidi to help like in UALX when goons helped legacy blob Panfam &amp; co. supers. 
---
Wormholes seem to not have that many players but are still relatively healthy.
---
Lowsec is ok too, but snuff owns most of the moons and rents them out, and really put a damper on most capital usage.
---
Highsec goons, legacy, and Panfam have all agreed to stop hostilities and share revenue from the perimeter keepstar.
---
TLDR massive blue donut
---
Its a good point you are making
---
Ack. No. Do you even build? Do you like having ammo to shoot and nanite paste to use?
---
Back in the day, invention used to use 1-run copies. Do you have any idea what an inventor's hangar looked like, with 100s or 1000s of 1-run copies of things? 
---
Do you honestly expect me to make 2000 runs of nanite paste by either tying up my BPO for 3 days on one line, or making it 10 units at a time on 1-run BPCs and babysitting it to start a new job every 3 minutes? Instead of doing 10 200-run jobs and being done in half a day while I'm free to do other stuff? Why do you hate me, you sick motherfucker?
---
Machariels, Armor T3Cs, and Feroxes online. 
---
I honestly loved that meta. More fights because we had ships that would just refit for what was needed instead of just leaving or whelping when faced with a fleet that you aren't currently fit to engage.
---
There is an external backup of the old EVElopedia site over at eve-inspiracy, the Backstage Lore wiki.  It contains exactly the same lore articles (and more that have not yet added back in the new fiction portal) but with the far superior wiki format. It is therefore far easier to navigate than the fiction portal.
---
All those tips are for veterans dude, not rookies. You expect a rookie to use a scout? I have not even said what I do but  you go ahead and assume I lost something to suicide ganking just to feel tiny bit better about yourself. It does not change the fact that you are wrong. But you are too much commited already to ever go back againts your own word right?
---
Amateur T2 inventor detected.
---
Good luck. If you want some help, send a mail to Alexander Otium in-game. I like helping rookies, I can throw a bit of ISK your way and point you in a good direction to get started.
---
yeah something like that so you have to put in more effort to swipe one than have a decent macro and a good ping
---
I did, where I linked the most helpful review on Steam in the last 30 days. Try to read first. Even if we assume it is my review which is not, it is still the top recent review and therefore an issue in the game.
---
In the same boat, I subbed all my accounts just before blackout because of the poor state of balance in 0.0, particularly the new jump gates. Still playing on what subs I have left but won’t be resubbing until there’s some real changes.
---
You're a genius.
---
Seriously, this is a good idea. Though maybe not a small matter of programming.
---
It is not a game breaking issue and I have not mentioned anything like that anywhere. You have started to become delusional mate. I said it is an issue of a new player retention rate. We all know CCP after years of trying are still doing terribly in that area, which they admitted themselves recently when they announced the rates.
---
You're Doing It Wrong.
---
Don't start by clicking the BP in the hangar. Use the Industry window to filter BPs and pick from the list.
---
But yes, stacking/merging BPCs would be nice.
---
Git gud.
---
Your career path in EVE should then be "pretend to be a girl and scam all the basement nerds sending you stuff because they love you"
---
It took me over a month to get a response and then another week for them to give me my account back + restore my SP. No ISK or assets returned, however.
---
Frat doesn't have the Reddit presence to shame tapi/goon/whoever botters regularly.
---
And I think you are just a basement dweller, no-lifer, thick headed, miserable fool but we can try to communicate without insulting each other right?
---
it increased the goon reddit post per day significantly
---
Sure, buddy.
---
haha damn, i only realized this was eve onion when they said they were gna straight up disable the kill mail end points xD
---
Side note: these groups only temp blue each other for "serious stuff", so small gang is still quite healthy and the blackout has improved it.
---
nope, since blackout every goon hates the game
---
I would always build your own pc. You can get better specs for the same price as a prebuilt,  or get the same specs from paying less.
---
Most games are Graphics intensive rather than cpu intensive. Eve is the exception, being the other way around - so consider other games you might want your pc for when building.
---
/r/buildaPC 
---
/r/buildaPCsales
---
And www.pcpartpicker.com are your friends here. 
---
The first two communities are great for finding parts and asking specific questions / reccomendations. The third is a great site where you plug in your parts and it finds the cheapest live prices for you, as well as telling you when your chosen parts might not be compatable.
---
I'd recccomend asking in /r/buildaPC then making a build on partpicker then finally making a new post back on /r/buildaPC to have them verify the final build.
---
As a starting point I'd be looking at a gtx960 and i5 processor for EVE on a budget. Make it a 1060 for a little more breathing room, or a 1070 if you will be playing other 2017 and later open world games on it too.
---
One does not influence you, other is killing the fun of others. Nobody forces you to mine. A miner currently mining in a high sec belt literally has no effect on you, unless you are so mentally retarded that you take it as an offense against you.
---
aye, and it is large enough. nestor has it it can hold a shuttle
---
I've gotten more small gang fights in provi and (surprisingly) delve, and Frat has almost completely stopped undocking. While I am still feeling somewhat burnt out due to all the risk averse spodbrains, things are a little more fun.
---
Goons don't really exist, they're just spreadsheets and bars
---
Good that you donate isk and explain what happened, but some don't. As can be read by the review there I posted.
---
wrong, it reduced the amount of posting as a whole by goons to the point I think it's just me and querns with a random jay &amp; tuzy post here and there
---
Well then people would call me a 40 yo chad who sits in his basement tricking as a trap
---
Catalysts are used not Thrashers. Everyone would get spammed by said message because CCP would have forgotten how to program it to be able to be turned off.
---
Why do you fuck me like this.
---
Thank you for this extremely helpful post!
---
Feel free to PM me. I'll give you the in game name of my main. I am always down to answer questions and if you lose a ship or something I can help you stay on your feet.
---
SPODBRAINS
---
Yeah idk I haven't really put much thought into it, but something needs to be done. It can't be that only titans matter and are the solution to everything. It makes everything else irrelevant in big conflicts.
---
You contradict with yourself. You suggested a bunch of shit a "rookie" can do to avoid ganking and then went ahead and claimed that they can't actually do them.   
---
And you can't force that way of thinking on anyone. Maybe he likes to keep that ship in his hangar. Does it hurt you? Does it bother you? If so, you might have a mental problem.
---
Does Intel or AMD matter?  I watched the AMD event from E3, but I don't know which is better.
---
Alright over there omnibrain make the game nothing but pain and suffering for groups relying on opsec and see how it goes then. I would rather the game not die but you are really determined.
---
well in larger conflicts it still would just have titans be used constantly, it now will just be titan blob A vs titan blob B with no real room to use anything other than titans
---
No problem, I forgot to add:
---
For building the pc pick your case then find a YouTube vid **of someone installing on the same case**
---
WHERE THE FUCK WAS THIS ON ACTUAL MONDAY?
---
FUCK YOU FRAT FOR NOT UNDOCKING ANYMORE.
---
FUCK YOU TUSKERS FOR GANKING MY DELVE ROAM BEFORE IT COULD GET BOSONED
---
NERF JAGS AND FIX THE GODDAMN VENGEANCE ALREADY.
---
So you're saying that you find attacking significantly weaker opponents who may or may not be armed with a T1 weapon is difficult? Your skill points alone will guarantee a win. Maybe it's YOU that's actually terrible to the point that this is all you can do. I'm sure you've never considered that though.
---
More free intel.
---
This is Eve. That's what's known as "success."
---
Injectors help new players catch up. Is this not what we wanted?
---
Quality shiptoasting
---
So you have experience on the matter? Because all I show you is a proof of said mechanic being a reason for new players to quit the game. That is all. I only suggest a few things to avoid making new players rage-quiting over a griefing mechanic.   
---
Whether I know you or not is not even slightly important. You don't know me yet you are here to accuse me of things all the same?
---
EVE players tend to hate being told they might not be as awesome as they think they are.
---
I found Elon Musk.
---
Ah the old Russian whataboutism
---
Show me on the doll where Code touched you.
---
Have a smartbomber sit permarunnig
---
It's ok. I'm just hoping the number of targets to shoot at doesn't drop off hard from here.
---
If I’m hunting to suicide gank, i don’t gank characters with an age of kess than 90days.
---
Its really unimaginative, as much as i dislike the instanced character of abyssals. Speed run contest for them or for some DED sites woild be so much fun.
---
I can always trick people into thinking I am a 40 year old chad who lives in his basement even though I am not
---
They are literally giving away free skillpoints right now
---
Sure, that ends super ratting then.
---
This is what happens when they leave Falcon in charge for the weekend.
---
Don’t fall for the 0.0 trap. Stay in highsec and Join a Wormhole corp.
---
I dunno!  Last few days in null I’ve had Jita local spamming like crazy.   Local is so bugged I can’t tell what we’re testing anymore.
---
Just fit a gun in a high slot if you want to get on killmails.
---
Ive been seeing a fuckload of gnosis bots in high sec anomalies, reported em all and the same ones come back day after day.
---
&gt;CCP also said that more than %90 of new players quit the game in the first month
---
I wonder the impact of the "refer a friend" bonus where you refer and get 1 month of free game time, nearly making a 1-month old account free, as long as you do not pay for a second month.
---
Seems like veterans who use/abuse this will really inflate the number of 'new' players who subscribe for one month only.
---
Show me the stats proving that CODE ganking causes the poor player retention rates.  There are a million reasons people quit, not the least of which is the bad NPE and impossible learning curve.  Back your claim up with more than a subjective review that a bunch of people liked. If that were acceptable proof, I could just as easily say that your idea is terrible based on the hundreds of comments here and 0 upvotes.  But I won't do that.
---
It’s happening already and quickly. Do you news?
---
It's a good point though, if Test et al hate bots so much, why do they allow them in their space?
---
I like how the more I challenge you, the more you resort to name calling and the more your spelling deteriorates.  It makes me wonder who the person of lower mental capacity in this argument is?
---
Well they just went and did it for 0sec farmers.. guess they like how that went.
---
Still no new gate being constructed
---
This game is early access.
---
No one does this. You are yelling at clouds. 
---
But yes, if you are worried, it would be likely considered griefing for a rich veteran to follow a player around and constantly gank their procurer. 
---
I’m starting to think you just aren’t comfortable with the idea you can lose to another player in this game, no matter how remote the possibility is.
---
I’ve just rejoined the game and I’m learning from the ground up, it could be in your best interest to join a newbro corporation such as Pandemic Horde or Brave newbies, these guys will teach you the basics of the game offer you a home and fleets to join so you can learn pvp, they will have fits / doctrines available to look at so you can fit your ship correctly to their fleet format or for solo play, they will usually have guides on their websites so you can learn  the game.
---
I’ve been doing exploration to earn money but you probably won’t have that learned, there’s guides out there which will give you a recommended skill path so you’re going to be optimising your ships based on what you’re wanting to play. Here’s an example;
---
https://wiki.goonfleet.com/Recommended_Skill_Training_Guide
---
But eve is your oyster I highly recommend just reading guides online that explains all the terms in the game like different spaces (high sec, low sec, null sec, Wormhole space) and what each means and how you can make money and setup your UI etc.
---
Yea but you're that idiot right now......
---
Yeah sometimes they smash Caracals into each other to pretend they're not blue.
---
"That's impossible I got hacked because your shitty servers were compromised"
---
- Someone out there circa everyday.
---
Intel mostly. 
---
With the blackout, a lot of players looked on Zkill to know where there was any action going on. This also was handy for ratters so they could use that information to look at the amount of action (kills) that was happening in their nearby systems and then decided not to undock and blueball hunters. Same applies with fleets and etc.
---
I've always gone for Intel + Nvidia, however as i understand it Intel + Nvidia has the best products at the ÚBER-HIGH-END (think: ray tracing on 20xx series GPUs) but AMD has extremely competitive mid range products.
---
I dont know much more than that about AMD but im sure /r/buildapc can argue among themselves forever about that, so its a good question for them.
---
Yes but if you're going to get serious about Eve, you'll be needing the empty bottles. You might cut yourself on a can.
---
It’s not an exploit, it’s a game mechanic, but carry on.
---
I'd enforce a "no account security support without 2FA enabled" guideline
---
Wish it was just Querns and Jay and Tuzy.
---
What about no
---
Roaming through Provi is depressing now.  Makes you wonder how bad the botting problem really is.
---
And if you don't pay them hope you have a friend's in standby to blow them sky high, or they'll keep coming either way
---
Welcome to the Fam my friend :)
---
Stacking identical BPC's/BPO's would be nice, but i don't think that is going to be possible without a significant rework of all the inventory code.
---
And i'm not sure what kind of demonic spaghetti is involved in that. :P
---
As someone with an intense interest in the lore of EvE Online, *thank you* for this link!
---
The CODE in elite are far different from the CODE in eve. Elite CODE are filthy pirates. In EVE, CODE protects highsec from greed and corruption. We uphold and defend the New Halaima Code of Conduct. If you intend on mining in highsec make sure you purchase a permit from your local agent, or join the in game channel ‘minerbumping’ to get in touch with one of our fine agents. Don’t listen to these rebels and bot aspirants. They’re trying to corrupt you into leading the same bot aspirant lifestyle they do. Make the smart choice and become CODE complaint from the start and have an enriching EVE career! Best wishes from CODE, and James 315.
---
Praise James.

Wormholes aren't as comfy as you'd think, recently HK has started flexing hard alongside novac and lazerhawks
---
LOST ANOTHER FUCKING STRATIOS TO SOME TWO BIT CHUCKLEFUCKS IN NULL SEC CUZ MY GOD DAMN WIFI CUT OUT AS I WAS ABOUT TO WARP OUT
---
PepeLaugh chicago
---
yeah but there're also dozens of reviews like op posted.
---
can you really count the choobs who joined during Delve as actual goons though?
---
So your idea of a credible argument is, "Look guys, someone said something!  REAL ISSUES!"
---
Yeah and they still get to the point. You are going to die, and a lot. You have to play smart or risk losing everything.
---
But now we have seen a large increase from Minerdistraction and  Dictateur\_Imperator which struggle to form coherent sentences. At least Querns can be funny. The other 2 feel like really bad troll accounts.
---
They could use some buff to tracking or a role bonus, out of my ass : double tracking agaisnt drones.
---
I've got it handy as I asked basically the same question to someone yesterday and they provided me the link (the OP of the forum post) to look at!
---
Many corporations offer aome kind of capital fund investment plans. I d ask around about these.
---
How would the game be hurt by making Highsec safe from ganking?  I played the game for a while running missions, and I enjoyed it.  Later I moved out to Nullsec, and I enjoy that.
---
If, during my time doing missions, I lost my ship to some troll, some chance I'd have quit the game. 
---
I do not see the benefit to allowing highsec ganking.  It does provide additional "content" to some players, but gankers could just do ganker things in lowsec or whatnot.
---
It seems to me like permitting ganking has the potential to drive away new players without adding any value.  If freighters and mining barges were 100% safe in highsec, I do not see how that hurts the game at all.
---
Meh, whatever, I don't really feel strongly about this, but I seriously do not see the point of allowing any highsec ganking.
---
But that's not the point. New players get mixed signals. Players who don't get it post these reviews and potential new players get the impression the game is unreasonable.
---
Blockade runners, DSTs. You know, what basically every wspace corp uses
---
&gt;Yes, that's exactly why your dinky account with 2b ISK was hacked, while the top 0.01% were untouched.
---
Clearly it's a conspiracy, and they're in on it!
---
If you calculated a ship’s EHP over the time of the fight, and they took significantly more damage than their EHP, you know they had logi support.
---
I'd argue the constant risk of loss is what makes Eve so special - my time is more valuable in game because I know I can lose it all so easily.  It's what's kept me coming back.  That and the feeling I get knowing I just caused some other dude to lose everything.
---
Let me add that you should ignore everything in the local chat while in the trading hubs. Particularly Jita. 99.99% of what is posted is a scam no matter how hard they try to say otherwise. 
---
In this game, scamming is allowed. Be careful.
---
Not big enough, too many people using ships that are too big. We'd be running cargo all day if our hole was too far from trade hubs.
---
Meh, not really.
---
I appreciate the role play. Take an upvote but you can still go die in a fire.
---
I think the question is more just why rage in the first place? It’s pixels, someone memed on you, life goes on
---
Enforce 2FA on accounts. That's the only real solution. Adding more people might speed it up, but would also be a huge waste. If you've worked on IT tickets for a large company/community before, you know how absurd it can feel trying to just stay on top of the issues coming in daily. Adding more people is patching up a problem, but not really solving it. The only way to solve it is reduce or remove the source of the ticket type (in this case, compromised accounts).
---
&lt;3
---
And you will only regret that when your favourite tools become unavailable.
---
They're plenty big enough for the majority of wspace. Roll your holes for good connections if needed, and make logistics a regular thing not "I need to move 500k m3 now!!!" and you'll be fine.
---
Sadly I think you're right, most things aren't nearly as simple on the back end as we'd like them to be.
---
HAHAHA FUCK YOUR MTU THAT SHIT IS HILARIOUS ! 
---
WHEN I WAS IN NULLSEC I MADE IT MY MISSION TO KILL LOST MTUS WHILE HUNTING FOR LOST DRONES (BECAUSE FUCK THOSE OVERPRICED CALDARI NAVY WASPS), AND FUCK IT IF IT WAS A BLUE MTU, A KILL MAIL IS A KILL MAIL ! DON'T LEAVE YOUR TRASH IN SPACE THAT'S HOW WE GET ROGUE DRONES !
---
I LOVE THIS THREAD
---
I wouldn't worry overly much. I've given smaller sums (maybe 100Mil) to people before just because they were new. You probably just made a whale think you were cute or something.
---
you seem upset
---
Yes lets split the already minimal playerbase
---
Does that mean all the non sov holding small gang groups that also don't engage in large scale warfare with us are blue to us?
---
Sov and structure warfare is aids right now anyway, if it stops being aids I might care.
---
Another day, another sad carebear posting to Reddit about how the baddies touched him
---
Please tell me someone sent him a message offering advice instead of just the generic(well deserved) trolling. I feel like a loss this big for a retarded new bro will drive them away from the game, instead of sticking around to provide dank content for the future.
---
Haha
---
Waaa? I love easy afk pvp kills !
---
Just making an observation that’s all lol
---
So sad that it’s minimal 😔
---
I love Falcon, where did guard go? I know he quit but I want to buy him a beer and send him a thank you card.
---
Great video again. Some more small gang with comms too pls? :Ρ
---
The game is unreasonable by the standards of many games. This game is infamous now. If a potential player is turned off by a few salty reviews and/or they don't look at other reviews, videos or articles about the game, then they likely aren't the type of person that would enjoy the game anyway.
---
that may work, though I still dont know what to do about links. blinged out pods could perhaps make it difficult to assume sensible max hp ranges.  And I'm not sure, but do you get the start and stop times of a 1v1 fight?
---
Good idea. Introduce them to the cringiest players right out of the gate so they know what to expect.
---
You picked a horrible example. A procurer that’s at least somewhat awake will fuck up a bunch of gank catalysts and also have a beefy enough tank they wouldn’t bother in the first place.
---
What you all complain about people not taking space and not being part of the big alliances.
---
I DIDN'T LEAVE MINE ANYWHERE. IT WAS IN THE MISSION POCKET WITH ME UNTIL CAPTAIN DOUCHEBAG DROPPED IN UNINVITED. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE IN A SHIP THAT PROBABLY CAN'T HANDLE FIGHTING ANOTHER CAPSULEER AND SOMEONE YOU'VE NEVER MET DROPS IN ON YOUR LOCATION? YOU PERFORM AN EXPEDITIOUS RELOCATION MANEUVER, THAT'S WHAT. THEN YOU START KEEPING AN EXTRA-CLOSE EYE ON D-SCAN TO MAKE SURE HE'S NOT TRYING TO FOLLOW YOU, AND IF YOU MANAGED TO GET HIS NAME ON OVERVIEW BEFORE HE CLOAKED THEN YOU CHECK THAT AND FIND OUT WHO HE IS. AND IF YOU'RE IN NULLSEC, YOU SURE AS FUCK DON'T WARP BACK INTO YOUR POCKET TO RECOLLECT ANYTHING YOU COULDN'T PICK UP UNTIL YOU'RE SURE HE'S GONE OR YOU'VE DOCKED AND PULLED OUT A SHIP YOU CAN FUCK HIM UP WITH.
---
Holy shit, that was your first stream!? Damn I couldn’t tell at all, hope you keep it up. Tool is out on spotify now, maybe a Tool themed stream comin up? 😁
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
this but unironically, for the longest time i believed gf meant gank fleet.
---
This. Is. Eve.
---
Have at least a weekly hauling service. Liquidate shared loost wisely and turn it into solid incentives. Have a clear direction in which the corp is heading, a playstyle and small narrative around it. Make your men believe there are worthwile objectives to achieve together. Have solid doctrines that you wont need to change every 2 weeks.
---
Sure! I’m currently editing a second small gang mixtape (with comms). Do you enjoy watching raw uploads also, or do you prefer edited/sped up footage and comms?
---
Wait a server, are you implying this is also part of the chaos event? No sarcasm, I fucking LOVE IT! You have no idea how much joy I am getting right now.
---
Those are all excellent suggestions and CCP should implement them now as they will be required to truly balance the game. Well done!
---
SHUT UP, PAUL. JUST LINK US YOUR LOSSMAIL.
---
If you use 2FA, the 'AI' makes exceptions for that.
---
At one time, people would get aut-banned for using VPN, because their geographic position would change more rapidly than one could fly.
---
I have a carrier pilot, first name Aoife. 
---
Because ships were meant to go boom.
---
Meh I disagree. A lot can be gained by presentation. Nobody decides they want to make beautiful ascii art in a cs map and then start whining about pvpers grieving them when they get shot.
---
I also disagree with the implication you need to be tough or smart or thick skinned to play eve. It's just an mmo. It's up to the devs to make the ui and designs and intended gameplay obvious and intuitive to people new to the concept. If people don't get it it's on ccp, not their lack of smarts/toughness or w/e bullshit eve nerds like to tell themselves.
---
Shintaht is just wannabe poitot

Do not trust this man! I sent him 1313.13 isk and he charged me a 0.01 isk nuisance fee, before processing my valid halving request!

I’m trying to go the route of 3D print, make a negative and then use greensand to make a casting of it.

But I’m just planning on using a backyard foundry lol

This guy for CSM
---
I'll take that trade any day
---
No. Getting killed by an NPC is getting killed by the game. Disconnecting and losing your ship is getting killed by the game. Blowing up to a Mercoxit rock is getting killed by the game. Getting ganked is dying to a player. It's you, a player, dying to another player. P(layer) v(ersus) P(layer).
---
Concord has nothing to do with it. 
---
God damn, HTFU. This is absolutely pathetic.
---
I mean ur the one crying about a non-issue
---
The fact that supercarriers cost 10b these days might tip you off.
---
So I recently came back after winning eve for about 7 years.  Decided to move my base of operations and was ganked leaving a station with about 170 million ISK of crap. I undocked, was insta-targeted and in my pod all while still black screened. (My ping blows) IF I did not have a fair bit of ISK and tons of datacores from research accumulating while winning Eve I would have once again logged out for an extended time. And the little shit who ganked me went into hiding so I could not exercise kill rights. (Also likely if I sold it the little shit would claim it from one of his other alpha alts). Prolly went on to another free account to get his jollies. Would be real fun for a newbie ...
---
At some point CCP needs to just seize alliance assets as an example.
---
That's still plenty enough to get a capital pilot on day 1.
---
Ok now that definitely does not work.
---
It makes sense for racing games because the market and peripherals for them already exist. EVE is comparatively quite niche, only a couple players would ever use this feature if it existed
---
It actually is in the starter missions.
---
Remove combat logistics completely
---
That would help these fleets be viable
---
How to make money; join an alliance. Pretend to be a girl and try to make “friends” in game. When they trust giving you something leave and take the stuff. Repeat this many times and you’ll be a trillionaire

Someone with fraud problems may still be a legitimate customer that pays, but gets fucked by third parties. It requires investigating and in order to ensure both a swift fix and low queues, you may not hear anything until a solution is present.

Patience is a virtue.

Oh boi have you missed a big time for miners
---
I'll quadruple it.
---
Been working on doing the absolute minimum each day. I'd look for cloaked ships but the hunters would lose their goddamn mind if they couldn't afk in space with no risk.
---
I was thinking of doing something with an apac (  [https://www.arcadeworlduk.com/products/a-pac-analog-digital-dual-gamepad-interface.html](https://www.arcadeworlduk.com/products/a-pac-analog-digital-dual-gamepad-interface.html) ), but once you have added the cost of the pcb, a decent angled hammond instrument enclosure, illuminated switches etc. You are half way to the price of a streamdeck.
---
(so I used the parts to build an arcade controller for retropi instead)
---
A lot of my buddies went to highsec for some shenaganas after this started... I'm the last hold out of my core group... it is going as expected

So kill logi?

It won't give you good reputation, but surely your Corp will grow like wild grass

Iceland has something like 710 police officers.

They can't stop all of us!

It would work if we had hundreds of tiny groups scattered around by themselves. I would agree there. But as most of null especially is dominated by large entities with thousands of bodies and IT departments that make some businesses look like treehouses, you can not rely on that alone.
---
Now if you would say that there is a way to break up all large entities and coalitions, I would be interested
---
No more bar parties under the office huh?
---
Any idea if y'all will be open around fanfest?
---
Content
---
Major change, don't find it the hard way: combat ceptor lost their bubble immunity. check the ship description first if you use a ceptor to travel throught null sec
---
Bad advice. Mining permits are the best investment you can make.
---
I never said anything about toughness or being thick skinned, It's still just a game. 
---
If players don't "get it", it's on them. There are 16 *years* worth of information on this game. If they aren't going to look any of that up, then they aren't going to do well in the game in the first place.
---
Yeah tried them all.. suuuper annoying.
---
Its a joke post...
---
Nice!  My plan was to use an Arduino to interface.  While you're right, the practicality of simply using a streamdeck certainly is there, I like to make my own stuff because, to me, half the fun is designing and building it and the other half is actually getting to use and enjoy something I actually built.
---
That's awesome that you built a controller for a retropi though!  Those are VERY snazzy!
---
you mean the same ppl that trash talk null sec blocks are behaving like them, then complain that their is no content ? ( serous question here, not a troll. I'm genuisly confused about who is whining or not on this reddit)
---
My preference is raw with comms because I learn more from it. The edited are nice to watch too though.
---
The moon landing footage was shot on a sound stage on Mars. Open your eyes, sheeple.
---
If you choose to mine, mine in Kamio or Niarja. These two systems are the best places to mine in high sec.
---
Yea you just have to be respectful of everyone's opinion and up vote and down vote based on if the comment actually contributes something to the conversation and not your opinion WAIT NEVERMIND THIS IS /R/EVE FUCK ALMOST FORGOT WHERE I WAS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Killing live information gathering is not the same thing as killing all information gathering ability.
---
Information is always good. I guess I really am taking an HTFU stance on this issue overall. But true newbies do need to know *how* to harden the fuck up: how to prepare, and what to do after losing their ship.
---
I feel your pain
---
That has nothing to do with botting, Provi was not some magic bot haven.
---
It has everything to do with the fact that Provi doesn't have an effective defense umbrella, and you guys have been kicking their teeth in.
---
Don't complain about a lack of content you killed off. Suck it up or move to different content.
---
Your mom boyfriend asteroid should show that. In eve asteroids are fine.
---
Not saying you did.
---
Ok so this is it then. According to cpp 10k people try the game each week and only a handful stay around after the first week. So what you're saying is ccp does nothing wrong and game is better of anyway because all those people are just not the type.
---
I was thinking of a DST or something. IDK. What does an orca do with it's tank if it gets caught?
---
My orca has like 400k ehp, so it'll drop drones and fight till I can get people undocked and to the hole.
---
This sub is the metagame extension of normal game so you dont know if ppl really describe an issue or whine to push their own agenda if youre not familiar with both sides of arguments.
---
how do you live a server?
---
Try filing a ticket to billing, these have highest priority afaik.
---
Excited for about 3 seconds.
---
I didn't say anything about the game being better off with or without them. Only that the game is likely not something that they would enjoy. 
---
CCP can do better by getting more people to try, only a few will stay and that's to be expected. It's a niche game style in a niche genre.
---
Learn to make it somewhat apparent it's a joke so you come off less of a moron. The downvotes should clue you in.
---
Don't play alone. But there are always lots of corps looking for members, including new players. Join a good one quickly, and let them show you the ropes! That's how you'll get hooked.
---
I think you miss the point of the OP. As a new player I didnt understand a damn thing you said.  It takes months to understand the complexities of the fgame to een consider some of those tactics and even multiple accounts which newbros dont have.  
---
All i know is I have a ship that mines ore and so thats what I am doing because the Mission Agent told me to. Then I go boom, get another ship go boom again, turn off eve.
---
I thought Red vs Blue was apolitical, so no "our side" for them. It's just an eternal pvp funfest.
---
If I was gifted a sum like that I would go do pvp. All of my current isk making activities are so that I can fund pvp.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  Welcome back.
---
High sec mechanics suck and CODE sticks strictly to high sec. Plus people in high sec are usually there because they don't want to PvP.
---
The support is almost non-existent, I cried and bitched for months about how retarded it was that I am omega on live servers but not on test server.  They COULD HAVE TOLD ME that I can buy PLEX on the test server to omega up, but NOOOO, instead they gave me a full page about why they cannot help.
---
My point was that heavy emphasis on any metric can result in changes that lose the spirit of what the game is.
---
Maybe they should develop a better umbrella then?
---
Been directoring a couple corps in null so my answer will be for these.
---
A great deal of things get into a corps survival but ill say a strong recruitment drive and good FCs are key to build a startup powerhouse, have fun for 3 months and then disband if you havent figured the 99 other things on the way.
---
Considering just how much of it there is, I'd wager most is some kind of normal pvp. War targets, faction warfare, etc.
---
Quit your racism
---
Well, this is the Age of Chaos! I am sure that's what CCP had in mind when Hilmar mentioned it.
---
I made a post about this a little while ago. Watch this video, it applies to EVE just as much as it applies to real life.   
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs&amp;t=48s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs&amp;t=48s)
---
&gt; How long untill CCP staff reacts to tickets ?
---
Got a 2020 calendar?
---
Very nice way to look at it
---
Adding Breaking News at the start and adding a random CCP Falcon cameo should do the trick.
---
Right and that is where we disagree. I don't think it's that niche. It think a lot more people of those 10k would stick around if expectations and perceptions were more inline with reality. People trying cs:go know exactly what they get into. And again this is on CCP. CCP themselves say they want to increase retention, not so much exposure.
---
\&gt;waaaah a group nobody liked got evicted, HK is evicting all of wormholes again
---
Funnest fleet I have ever been on.  Was so much joy and fun had in comms as well as in game. It was just good fun all round and some really nice kills.
---
They're good for quick runs, but not for exporting our loot and products, or importing a bunch of fleet ships. Everyone else gets freighters and jump freighters, I don't think wanting to keep our only mildly-heavy cargo option is that crazy of a request, personally.
---
I'm not opposed to more information being given to newbies. Tell them that there are psychopathic capsuleers out there that just want ships to burn. And drive the point harder that joining a corporation will really really help if you get into a tight spot. A corp (even a bad one) can do some of these things, a newbie cant on his own (I do understand that). Any highsec Corp will have people that can help you buy a new venture or t1 frig, that I'm reasonably confident in.
---
But radically redefining the NPE such that you are ungankable for any period of time or you start in superhigh security space or whatever is anti-ethical to eve.
---
If you're still looking for a corp you can pm me if you want.
---
Funny story is that I just met a guy who does that haha. He even carries a hull repper in his cargo as well. Frankly I never plan to live long enough to need that stuff, and at the rate I lose ships, it would just add to my cost. I'm already just barely getting by :P
---
Uploading as we speak :)
---
This
---
Trig guns are good. But that maybe attributed to their platforms being better rather then weapons themselves.
---
Well that's kind of stupid if a player controlled structure aggresses a non-criminal player. It seems to me that what's good for the goose is good for the gander, and the person starting the non-consensual pvp against a non-flashy should eat a sec status hit too. 
---
Almost certainly a non-flashy player defending herself by attacking support fighters that have aggressed her from an upwell structure should not be penalized for doing so. That's just common fucking sense.
---
Baited on a free onion.
---
That lore site has most of what you are looking for, but it's so badly organized that it just doesn't make sense if you don't know how those chronicles should be ordered; which is pretty sad.
---
EVE source is pretty good for back story. It's quite heavy on Dust and the templars because of when it came out, but very in depth as to where the 4 empires came from and the workings of the pirate factions.
---
Lots of pretty pictures as well.
---
Infinite - 1 day.
---
"Undock" is a caution-colored yellow... LOL!
---
Well, I did not know that.
---
I love that
---
For PVP there's been a shift in the type of fights that I'm seeing. Rather than roaming around until supers get dropped or a fleet gets bridged on you, I've seen more small gang fights and 1v1 situations. Plus quite a few instances of hunters dropping the same targets or just dropping on each other, which has been funny. There's been a marked decline in traditional AFK ratters to hotdrop, but there are still Ishtars and, surprisingly, I've seen more rattlesnakes (which is great imo).
---
I think the combination of the blackout and the VNI nerf happening so close together has been problematic for guessing how either are doing. A lot of smaller krabs have just shut down until the meta stabilizes, and I've stopped using my own ratting alt (which I was just starting to get back into before the nerf, super annoying...). There are also less excavators out, more Mining II drones, but not so bad that we're having trouble getting targets.
---
All in all I think the situation is still in flux. Ratters are starting to adapt and the excavs are slowly coming out again, but there's definitely a lot of hesitation and people who aren't undocking krab toons. PVP is fluid but I'm having fun. My monthly kill count in July was one of the highest I've ever had. So yeah, my accounts are all subbed again.
---
Best tip I can give ya is try to buy into a limited time release item, drugs like pyrolancia sell faster, limited release skins may take longer to sell but tend to increase faster then other things. Look at items like the hvx3 w.e ballistic control drone dmg mod. My first real investment was buying as much quafe zero for 3-6m risk and then up to about 8 or 9... it quickly went to 18, and then well over 20, it's at over 30 now my stock ever the years has gone from nearly 500 to about 100, but my investments in skins has now made me asset rich. With skins value in excess of 1.5 trillion isk.  I am actually trying to liquidate much of the assets and hope to help some market people out in the process as I have 0 skills in trade, and zero time willing to dedicate to the market besides watching my assets increase in value.  Msg me if anyone is looking for a foolproof investment with a minimum 50% ROI up to 200% or more if negotiated right.  Certain clients are not welcome. And only looking for people with minimum 100 billion isk to invest. Although if ur a noob with trade skills I can work out a portfolio to help you out for 1b probly. Not worth my time but I like to help newbros.  Invest in Cheese!
---
Migration from null to low/high caught on camera. Like lions watching the herds move on to better pastures. The lions can't really move, and they know hard times are ahead.
---
But who am I kidding, just upvote blackout good and downvote everything else.
---
Lowsec gate to Malpais instead pls
---
Downscaled as well until I know what direction CCP is going. I don't want to invest in a second account only to have it's goal nerfed.
---
I've seen some half-assed comments on reddit from your before, but this one following an entire week end of chat servers shitting the bed in a very public way takes the whole fucking cake.
---
But how?
---
He is literally a hi sec pubbie who mined in goons like a beta boi.

3.  Game has been dying since early 08.  Were still here!
---
4.   Enjoy the game space bro! Get into a noob friendly group, learn how to fend for yourself isk wise.  And have fun!
---
convient isn't it though? They now have a "lore" reason to blame the game acting like the devs gave the server a lobotomy, from now on when the game shits the bed they can just claim its a "feature" like when they made lag a "feature" and started calling it TIDI
---
You can exploit game mechanics, it’s not always negative. For example minimaxing in D&amp;D.
---
Why are you so dense? Feeling guilty about something?
---
Fun fact: Stellar bodies aren't always the same distance apart. New gates could open, old gates could close via this very reason. 
---
Oh, you know, space magic.
---
or at least the devs brain cells are.
---
I mean if those small gang corps are going to drop all their shit on anyone who tries to invade you, yeah they're pretty much blues.
---
And now it is better how exactly?
---
I read this as **"I just downvoted eve online"** 
---
Anyway, starter tips: 
---
Nothing said in local should be trusted
---
Do tutorial, then do career agent missions, all of them. If you need help finding just search for them. 
---
Spend at least a few weeks getting your bearings on how the game works, what you want to do and how you wish to do it. 
---
From there, consider joining another corp in game, but only if it's worth it to you. Some join and go solo after a while, others start out as solo and end up joining other groups. Also do your damn research before you join someone.
---
Are you always this retarded or is this just a particulary bad day?
---
it would be nice it the MER was split in 2 this time, one for the dates of the drifter thing and one after the black out
---
You missed when there were actually people logged in and undocked. Feel free to tour 0.0 ghost town.
---
Making perfect intel less perfect comes in many forms.
---
Just something I think you missed. 
---
“Ccp, consider gates. Gates should be closeable/lockable.” If we cant close/lock them, please rename them
---
&gt; I'm in the office all this week, so more than happy to come say hi, grab a coffee and shoot the shit for a little while!
---
Isn't that your job description? ;)
---
NPC nullsec in drones instead plz.
---
The first time someone said EVE is dying [was actually in 2003](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rQXJ7Y7r3Xg/U9hIMGUYPcI/AAAAAAAABUo/Vi4LURooI7w/s1600/First+EVE+Is+Dying+Post.png), haha.
---
^ Falcon's Alt...
---
Fun fact: it takes millions of years to have any significant effect.
---
I'll give you the FW kills but most empire wars are about playing docking games until you see an easy kill. There are exceptions (the trading tower fights were definitely pvp) but my bet is on mostly on one-sided fights.
---
Anyway. whichever of is is closer to the truth, I think OPs ideas would kill the game, or as you said, make it not Eve.
---
yes.
---
the bit that involves flying spaceships.
---
GG
---
no, fuck that.
---
I haven't been baited this hard since that time I bubbled my own fleet to grab a couple of enemy ships and got my buddies bombed
---
clearly not if the game's still kinda shit?
---
That's not a fun fact. 
---
I feel tricked by this thread. First it's not StainGuy posting the thread, now this. I want my money back.
---
solid video man
---
Hush! Don't talk about those sites!
---
News to us.
---
Okay, yeah, trig guns are pretty fucking busted
---
much love
---
No Hip Hop or Electronic Music, have a like!
---
We've had a corp mate stuck dealing with a banned account for well over six months because someone went on holiday.
---
How in the ever loving _fuck_ is that acceptable?
---
Nice nice! But next time lower the volume of the music when you are talking, as its kind of interrupting and makes it hard to focus on what you are actually saying.
---
Get some exploration frigates, go far away from all tradings hubs and start looking for wormholes. If you are cautious you can pay back your ship in one run with data and relics. You can add some spice with a venture to get some gas.
---
And you can try combat site later with T1 BC when you start feeling confident.
---
If you like it and want to go from prey to hunter, lot of corps will be happy to have you.
---
If you are interested in this life style, feel free to ask.
---
I understand the desire to build things. Knowing you made it, to your design is pretty awesome. 
---
The apac is good, it comes with an app to deal with mapping. Arduino is too clever for me. I am a valves and transistors guy. 
---
I was planning to go full minmatar with the design - dynamo printed labels on a metal box
---
honestly it hasnt been that much different - you do miss the intel of quickly knowing if there is people in a system. 
---
At first I was paranoid about running into camps but space does feel more empty, i've flown through multiple regions without running into anyone.
---
I have seen some decent killmails but it seems like those mostly come from bomber fleets
---
so i don't hate it but i wouldn't say it is an improvement
---
Bullshit.
---
CCP isn't sorry. If you were, there wouldn't be continued cases of people waiting _months_ for tickets to be responded to. Look at WoW, this would be fixed by now if it was Blizzard support dealing with it.
---
Stop lying to us. We know you don't care. Your actions say more than your words.
---
We've got a corp mate pushing 6...
---
Security Team "deals" with these reports. Not the same team as those dealing with their broken chat.
---
I have had ticket response time from 12 hours to still waiting 3 years later so....it can vary.
---
In the Spirit of Chaos: let NPC corps randomly declare war on each other.
---
Hisec carebears dont just want to grind isk. If they could play on their own singleplayer shard with no pvp, would they? No, they need to be a part of a living universe to get their enjoyment. There is more to them than "likes seeing number go up".
---
And they could still grind in hisec, with no gankers, 100% safe. They would just get better rewards elsewhere.
---
To be fair this tactic works in every online game, and it works pretty damn good. 
---
If you can pull this shit off (pretending to be a girl everytime you log in) and maybe even get a voice changer you are golden. For me it's too much shit to deal with, especially since you have to stir shit up in alliances as a girl to make people join sides and fight over you.
---
Yknow ive never experienced an fc calling targets alphabetically and never done so myself as an FC. Generally call it by ship type and distance or in free fire situations you shoot the dude with the closest to your own name.
---
Oh look, a sock puppet account
---
Or up you could just scout the holes on your way in and out like most players already do. DSTs handle 9o% of wormhole use cases. The only purpose you'd need a hauling or a for is to bring a large structure in or out since a DST can't hold it and a freighter can't enter low class wormholes. Then again you could always just build your fort in the hole.
---
you missed introduction of skill injectors and ship skins, however CCP managed to get rid of ingame casino called "I want ISK". Also banning a lot of bots or kinda trying...which kinda resulted in local blackout for null sec. Also nerf left and right to T3 cruiser(tank), rorqual (tanking + yield), dreads and carriers(tank), machariel(low slot less), VNI(drone bandwith got nerfed from 125 to 75MB rendering the ship mostly unusable for pve content). Introduction of force auxillaries, command destroyers, T3 dessies, tranglavian ships. Don't forget the sov mechanics change, pre cancer and post cancer still the same cancer.
---
So risk vs reward in null is currently not balanced, right and left cov ops. Great times for null pvp content though if tackling anything big which is easier than ever, but anything else is kind of meh. For good or for bad, eve is still breathing.
---
The fuck? We have a fairly decent sized Corp as far as low class wormholes go. Our doctrine ships are constantly stocked and it doesn't require hundreds of DST runs. You can fit 6 cruisers or 4 BC hulls in one DST plus all the modules as well. If you can handle logistics without using an orca then you're doing something wrong. Do you run exclusively battleship doctrines or something? If so I feel bad for your statics.
---
Be good to see some stats actually
---
Catch is garbage resource wise but is good for content because pipelines/logistics

Triglavian cyber attacks continue, CONCORD had provided optional [enhanced Neocomm security](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203465601-Authenticator) software for all capsuleers, failure to ensure all security measure are in place will limit CONCORDs ability to provide aid to pilots in the event of personality corruption.

What are you even talking about?

People fly implanted and blingy shit all the time in null and WH space.
---
About 5 years ago I played for about 2 years. Joined several corps and stayed with eve university for awhile too.  Initially did some mining but got quite bored fast. I really missed out on pvp because i simply was to nervous to attack someone.  Fought a bit in a few wars, but it took a while to grasp what was going on. 
---
Eventually I found that a support role was fun to do, but that only worked in groups, and because of the reason I had not that much time a day to invest, I found it kind of hard. In big corps/alliances you sometime wait for a long time. 
---
I quitted and about one week ago I picked it up again. Now, I’m afraid to solo pvp, but I’m trying to learn. Living in low sec &lt;.5 using exploration in wormholes and planetary interactions to earn money. Preparing a few (8-10) frigates to go and attack people on sight.  Not because I’m a bad or annoying person, but to get some experience.  I expect to lose all of them, but who cares! :)
---
I’m guessing that doing this with one or two others would be even more fun, but I don’t have the time to really sink in corporations and build friendships.
---
right click EVERYTHING!

---
one-sided fights is just PVP all over new eden.
---
If you're in a fair fight, both you and the enemy fucked up.
---
Plus theres the alternative of building the ships in your hole.
---
Pro players know that’s where the big iskies are. Gotta pay for that small shield extender somehow
---
Thats more expensive isnt it?
---
Depends... If they make them stackable then you could have the job take multiple BPCs at a time, up to 10 similar BPCs.
---
it would be a change that requires more than making them stackable and max 1 run.
---
exploration is pretty fun and interesting.
---
Can be insanely profitable, can be kind of dull, but it's all about chasing that high of another great day of RNG.
---
send me your isk and I will double it
---
Thanks. So how does zkill help hunters? Obv zkill shows kills therefore the person is already dead. 
---
Is it to see how many people may have killed someone therefore theres a possible fleet to kill?
---
Will do, I've heard that from a couple people, appreciate the feedback :)
---
Remember everyone, in very few cases do the people complaining about being banned tell you the whole info.
---
But anyway, op, this sounds weird.
---
I log into EVE on 2 computers regularly, and another couple dozen sporadically and haven't had issues, including one of the accounts being Alpha.
---
Never actually logged in on 2 computers at once across my accounts, but still.
---
The TFA is for logging in, not launching.
---
yeah, I wasn't playing, but came back to a a diplomatic shuttle bpc. wtf is that?
---
Wildlands-  isk doing anything is worse. Region is huge, so getting anywhere takes longer. Geography is kinda fuckt too. thukker missions don't pay that well. it's not the worst place on the map, but pretty mediocre. Very empty, so it's easy to live there safely.
---
Interesting, maybe I'll look into one and consider tinkering with one.  I enjoy learning new systems.  
---
That design sounds pretty awesome!  I haven't yet settled on an aesthetic (though I'm not really an artistic kinda guy), but that sounds like a pretty cool look and a metal box would make it nice and solid for sure.
---
Beans are some good dudes. Super autistic. But good dudes. Are you the tip of the spear guy they evicted?
---
Nah, each ship in this comp is puking out so much DPS that enemy logi was never a huge issue. Usually things were dead before anyone could even respond, and even when there _was_ logi on field, we were just melting straight through the reps.
---
I think the comment about 100% k/d ratio hits the nail on the head - the typical nanogang comps that get used in a lot of roams are more able to escape if they bite off more than they can chew. Meanwhile glass-cannon brawlers are almost guaranteed to get blobbed to death eventually, you're just trying to kill as much as you can before it happens.
---
That makes since, but I think I am goi g to take a break from trying to do pvp. I ran across 20 retrievers and one rorcqual last night and could not get one person in my Corp to come help bomb them. 
---
And was going to see if I could just kill one but I was so bad.
---
Or maybe you should hunt in a more target rich environment and let the fishery recover.
---
Do relic and data sites in C1, C2 or C3 wormholes. Use a site like [anoikis.is](http://anoik.is/systems) to ID them. Do only the ones with Sansha, Blood Raider, Serpentis, Guristas or Angel in the name. Run 1 or 2 sites then bring the loot back to a highsec station, then go run some more if you want. Sell the loot in any trade hub (Jita, Amarr, Dodixie). Try not to transport more than 100 mil at a time, learn how to make and use insta dock/insta warp bookmarks. 
---
One relic site in a wormhole should get you between 5 and 50 mil. Data a bit less but still worth it. 
---
Once you've got a nice pile of isk built up you should look for a corp that looks fun to you no matter where it is, highsec, lowsec, nullsec or wormholes. Check /r/evejobs or the official recruitment forum or the corp finder in game. Don't be afraid of the lawless areas you get used to life there pretty quickly.
---
Forget about space trucking and mining until much later in the game.
---
2fa is enforced in a way, you always have to confirm via email. The problem is it's a little less secure since chances are high if anyone has your eve account they also habe your email.
---
The problem with enforcing actual 2fa is that you can't really force people to download third party apps like google authenticator and some people also don't have smartphones.
---
&gt; How are we supposed to know if we should just go an play another game for 5 months if we get banned by some overeager GM?
---
Given the circumstances, and my personal experience in such matters (being former video game CS/Tech Support myself), I'd place my bet on a HWID ban. Specifically, the hard drive.
---
Older laptops were notorious for using cheap, shitty drives that had widely duplicated HWIDs because until more recent years, it was never really an issue.
---
I'd be interested to hear what happens if OP creates a new account on that laptop and attempts to log in.
---
How about we do the opposite? All cynos everywhere, including wh's! I've been roaming around wh space cloaked up, just doing recon and those player structures sure seem to have a lot of fat loot in um and only a handful of people with multiple accts defending. 
---
My "make Eve history" goal revolves around doing a lot of recon work and then giving that info openly to the big blocs. In null, farming smaller corps isn't really profitable at all. But imagine farming wh corps every six months? Could be worth it.
---
The bubbles!
---
Don't be too daunted abou null. Pre blackout it was really safe, probably safer then highsec since you knew everyone in local is either a good guy or bad guy. But with blackout its a little more dangerous, but thats what eve's suppose to be.
---
Isk transfered between players are not faucets or sinks. You are using a term you don't understand.
---
Was just there! Coolest place.
---
you're right actually I'm pretty new
---
That’s Albion for ya.
---
I got to Reykjavik on sunday and so missed my chances because holiday and weekend :(
---
When you have the character's information up there's a little button in the top left corner. There you have the report bot option.
---
Totally clueless guess: it'll go down to 3-3.3m then rise again to 4.8-5m
---
It's criminally underrated how good this game can actually look.
---
Making people blind is not making intel less perfect.
---
I would prioritize finding a good corp, having a community makes or breaks this game for alot of people. For nullsec, best bet is goons, pandemic horde, test or brave.
---
Find another sandbox...
---
Hek dude wtf
---
space is emptier, but when you do find stuff, you have a pretty strong chance it's not going to be pre-aligned.
---
my tackle rate on confirmed in-space miners and ratters has gone from about 5% all the way up to 95%+
---
see very few other "roamers", but I never really did anyway in my timezone
---
Russian bots don't seem to be quite as retarded. But yeah, that's not okay either.
---
Astero bots been my main focus. I can snag a couple straight off the astero zkill board that were killed today as they all have similar fits and setup:
---
[1](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78264860/) [2](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78258422/) [3](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78256611/) [4](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78256537/) 
---
Those are all killed today and they tend to keep to the North. But looks like quite some people now focus on these bots as they can just camp in a relic site with a dual sebo rocket bomber. But yeah I've been reporting bots like these 2 years ago and looks like there's no end in these bots. CCP's better off bringing back the old relic sites with rats in them.
---
People already do that without a lowsec gate to stain. Plus stain is a shithole.
---
it's a stretch but does it check out eeehh it seems to check out  
---
i guess
---
Market Broker fee - how low can you get ?
---
good ide i like it
---
Well taken points.  
---
Don’t get put off by people being unhappy about this and that on all the social media platforms.  It’s the spice that keeps people interested.  
---
The one constant in Eve is, in writing, we all are almost constantly unhappy about almost everything.  In person most of us are actually pretty cool and would be much more likely to buy you a beer than hate on your alliance (actually we would probably do both).
---
Why wouldn’t you wait like literally 2 seconds lol
---
This game thrives at maximizing the opportunity and ability to victimize people exactly as you described above. Efforts are in overdrive to further stifle any growth of any activity that is not victimizing such people... HTFU...
---
Jump in, run through the tutorial again if you need a refresher on what the various buttons do, and then join a large new player friendly group.
---
The last is key, you want a group that is used to helping lots of new players learn the game. My recommendation is Pandemic Horde. Google ‘Join Horde EvE’. DM me here if you get stuck.
---
This is Isk removed from the game in the form of tangible goods being destroyed.
---
i think its possible that dreddit is recruiting, or brand newbros
---
Sure, how about we end however you make pvp money as well.
---
At this point AMD is just as good as intel for gaming. If you are trying to achieve max frames for a fps intel would be better. However in terms of normal gaming I would go with AMD.
---
Whats changed? Less subs out,  less players out, less content in general. Keep seeing posts about tons of kills but honestly, kills were happening before as well so hard to attribute it to the blackout specifically, except for most excav kills. NS small gang meta has changed aswell.
---
See tons selling off their stuff aswell, lots lots more than regular market fluctuation. Cant say for sure if theyre switching income streams or just straight up quitting the game. 
---
Prices have started to rise. Some items are becoming very expensive whilst PLEX has gone down. Further proof of less players (market tampering/fluctuation can ofc be a reason but its just too much to just be tampering/fluctuation). 
---
But we havent seen the end of it because people are still holding on. Think a lot of people are still evaluating if they should continue to live in NS or the game itself. Especially since the "age of chaos" will wreck NS for 18 months. 
---
This wasnt a good change, no matter the reason behind it the game has already lost a lot of players which I doubt we will be getting back. Some would argue that people have returned as well but I doubt its even close to the same numbers. Some will respond by saying that they would rather have less players than afk ratters but they dont seem to understand that there are ways to lower afking without lowering population.
---
And some will scream less bots yet the data doesnt seem to support it. In fact looking at new player graphs, market changes and such it seems the blackout traded lots of real players for more HS (and the like) bots. I would much rather have kept the bots in null where they actually could be reported and killed than the current setup. Bots just gained invulnerability imo.
---
So ye, nope.
---
How did you make your isk? Boson ratting?
---
Well, they arent the solution to everything. In fact they are the solution to very few things. The absolute majority of fights in the game are non titans and even non capitals.
---
&gt; you shouldn't need the game giving you a 1/4 cent gold star sticker to validate you.
---
I dunno, I think the point of the sandbox is it gives you things that *you* feel are valuable. Some people might not like running a research structure, but I do. I don't particularly care for logi on KMs, but some pilots do. 
---
Eve has enough room in the sandbox for both pilots to get things they value, and if eve is giving you something you value, then that creates engagement and it's better for the game.
---
While the art of the scam has really taken a down turn in New Eden in the last few years, understand that their are still a number of great scammers out their who are very very good at taking what you let them.  They love that kind of PvP.  
---
It a deal sounds too good to be true...it probably is.  
---
Everything that happens in Jita local is a scam.  It’s just a matter of which one it is.  
---
Never never trade things using the ‘trade window’ with someone other than your own alt, and even then I still don’t really trust them.  Use contracts.  
---
No...you will not win at the ISK double game or the fire sale contract game if the person you are playing against is not dumb....and they are usually not that dumb. 
---
Don’t let people you don’t know move your stuff.  Go with well known freighter groups and fully collateralize everything.  
---
No real group will require you to give them your money to be a member.
---
Most of these old chestnut are the stuff of memes now, but still worth remembering.
---
I was too busy speculating whether it was a trap; we just crossed each other in the connecting c4, I'm thinking someone's hunting me. He remained uncloaked the entire time while scanning the now c2. Either highly suspect or serious oversight. 
---
Moving in slowly, thinking be quick and gtfo; sabre suddenly appeared about the distance of the nearby pos and immediately warped to 0 on the target. Point, bubbles, done. 
---
:0
---
Sure you can. It's 2019, who doesn't have *something* they can install Google Authenticator on? Playing games isn't a right. You want to play, keep your account secure or GTFO.

This guy built a nice panel i have been meaning to reproduce for myself! Instructions included!!

I suppose the idea was to get other people concorded, as they see him undock as a criminal, and shoot after his timer expires? But alas, the turntables.
---
Surprise Buttsecks Mechanics?
---
I didn't mind it at all tbh. Was funny I was talking in 3 locals at once.
---
Eve Uni is never a wrong move.  They are good people, they have classes and a good wiki, you can trust the organization (as much as anyone in Eve) and it will give you some time to think about what you want to do.  
---
Never be scared about changing up your game if something sounds fun.  Almost no one these days don’t care about if you were in this group or that.  Just hang with people and doing things that are fun.
---
Wow that is pretty awesome. I mean it is a way to bring the Eve community closer together.
---
&gt;if someone wants to have instant kills without posting all the time to zkb which is crazy 
---
You mean pretty much how zkill used to work? You guys legit have it so much easier, tools like eveeye and zkill have come so far and you're still whinging for even more handouts.
---
How much estimated value do you think mine each day with that setup?  Im just wondering how big of a dent this did and what it would take to make this unprofitable for them ( like having to go and kill them every day?)
---
Honestly, I think we would just lose the majority of those players.
---
Diesnt mean it's not well thought out unlike eve. Just not my cup of tea just as eve isnt others.
---
Invulnerability timer bro. It does not work against concord.
---
Nice.
---
I came back to the game a couple of weeks ago.  I opened a ticket because I forgot my old account names and had everything resolved within 2 hours.  I'm sure it has something to do with certain tickets requiring investigation.
---
Lol "no one does this". Isnt the entry into CODE to do just that?
---
CCP also made the 260m tick thing sooo.
---
ableist scum
---
Remember when multiple bubbles would blind you?
---
I dont know what to tell you except that we're only just now coming out of our setup phase. we have been running packed out orcas twice a day for almost a week now.
---
They don't seem that bad. Maybe a little bit of a tracking improvement. But with the long falloff you already get a lot of utility that brawling hybrids don't give you.
---
Err... I had a similar experience in my first corporation too! :(
---
Shit hit the fan with griefers in the system the Corp lived soon after I joined in, and people thought I was a spy! lol
---
During my first week with this guys one of the members got his shine new toy blown up by griefers, blood boiled up and he turned the entire corporation against me, calling me a lots of names and kicking me out of the Corp... 
---
I considered just stop playing after that stuff... I had no idea wtf happened, just knew people hated me with a vengeance :(
---
I ended up don't logging in for a few weeks, but came back and hauled my stuff away from the system I lived with all that dickheads!
---
Eventually joined a new Corp and stayed with EVE for years lol
---
Anyway, regarding what you said... You want to give eve a chance but you don't want to partake in reading about it! This is a big issue! Eve is dautless, this shit is HUGE and if you want in but don't have the patience to start studies on game mechanics, game activities, etc, I would honestly recommend you to don't even try! :(
---
The risk thought is what makes eve EVE, and if you find the wish to push on and give it a shot, I'm sure it's worth while o/
---
Just look for a group of nice fellas and start experiencing what the game has to offer until you find the thing that makes you have more fun, things will just go from there o7
---
Two sides of the same coin.
---
Allowing suicide ganking, the griefing part atleast, is one of the dumbest things in this game. It only shows the new player how much they actually dont know and very few will, after being ganked, just think "hmm let me invest thousands of hour into truly understanding a game in which I just lost everything". The arguments for griefing are some of the dumbest Ive ever heard and goes against every sane behavioural aspect.
---
But its part of old Eve in which "everything should be dangerous". Ideology is one thing but in reality one has to adapt and this is a game after all. Let HS be safe from most griefing but allow for "real" ganks. If a JF pilot loses stuff, thats the cost of doing business. If a newbie miner loses his ship cause of reasons they dont understand then he/she will most likely not pursue the game.
---
But theres tons more issues with why HS sucks for new players and the entire system needs adaption to an era in which games have tons of competition and people simply dont have to play Eve. Make it into an attractive game instead of "there is no other spacesim out there so youre fked".
---
It doesn't take much to trigger you. Your flair really should be "Premier Krab" your entire corp has killed 2 bombers in 2 months lol. Between spodrocks and reddit posting no time for pvp?
---
Also remove dscan, combat probing, non local chats showing people in as well. Remove the overview as well. Blinding people is the best way to go forward.
---
WTB CNC Nyx
---
Chaos is what CCP promised isn’t it?
---
Change for change's sake is as bad as being mired in being so worried about breaking things you never change it.
---
Last time I have submitted support ticket I got ansewer after 3 weeks of waiting.
---
Flair checks out
---
The guide explicitly talks about how the starter fits are just that, and even provides instructions on how to improve them (plus an entire later page about fitting concepts more generally).
---
The guide is designed for those first fits to work 100% no matter what the local circumstances. Yes, 95% of the time there will be meta modules available, but 5% of the time it will cause additional overhead.
---
I'm not sure exactly how much they would make with this setup. However, with max boosts and skills I think a Procurer makes ~50m per hour. There were no rorqs providing boosts and the procurers were cheaply fit so I will assume 40m per hour per Procurer. We killed 600m and with 15 Procurers that is about 1 hour worth of mining. While that isn't that much on its own there is also the time before someone reships the bots (they warped back to the belt in pods so I am assuming the bots can't reship themselves)
---
The game actually looks good most of the time. It's a very beautiful game. Even the rust buckets that minmitar fly look good.
---
And re-meme-bering
---
Oh my god, that is amazing. I would call it the epitome of fail, but knowing EvE this is only the tip of an iceberg the size of Kilimanjaro.
---
$$$
---
Good grief, I can barely see some of the ships in this fight, even *with* all the bubbles highlighting them! Just goes to show how limited visual range is, I guess. I know the game wouldn't be nearly as pretty if ships fought BVR.
---
If only this was Jita chat. I'd be happy.
---
This game would become infinitely better if half our tools broke.
---
There's no part of this which is good for the game. That player (assuming it's a genuine noob, which it looks like from the fit) has just wasted a stack of money and seen it blown up almost immediately (he probably bought that from the Maila keepstar), and hasn't had a good experience of Eve. When experienced players throw 20 billion ISK at injectors to ramp up multiboxing, it's bad for the economy. Allowing people to skip straight over all the subcaps removes almost all sense of progression from the game.
---
Even from a cashgrab point of view, yes this guy dropped $300 but you are probably missing out on plenty of subscription money from him and his friends after he bitches about how stupid Eve is.
---
CCPls make injectors work like an accelerator, so they can be used for their supposed purpose of 'newbies catching up' but not to inject straight into the endgame.
---
I have not. Silvr is the blops fc take all your anti shit sling to him
---
For those of us who are ignorant newbros, what's so special about Poitot?
---
hey shush I got alphad by rats
---
As a logi main I have to ask, do we get back pay?
---
Faceslap administered :)
---
That said, the principle behind the meta0 fits is to make the "startup" experience as quick and painless and possible - even at the expense of a bit of power in the fit itself.  
---
Are the fits improved by using meta modules?  Absolutely!  But availability and price of meta modules can be inconsistent.  A veteran player can easily swap out something that's not on the local market for a different meta, and shop around a bit for lower prices.  But for a new player, who probably doesn't know the difference between a Tracking Computer vs. a Tracking Enhancer or a Quad Light Beam Laser vs. a Focused Light Beam Laser, the meta module names just add an extra layer of confusion when they just want their ship to have guns already.
---
Given that meta0 modules are consistently available, for consistent prices, and swapping them out for meta[anything] won't screw up the fit, the meta0 versions are used as baselines to speed up the new player "fit your ship and go" experience, without having to spend extra hours flying between trade hubs, delving into meta variations and comparing prices and checking CPU/grid implications, and doing all those other things before they get to shoot some red crosses already.  Sure, the fit's not optimal in terms of stats-per-ISK - but that's not what the meta0 version is optimizing for.
---
Just remove non-consensual PvP from Highsec and the problem is solved.
---
Players who want to shoot people should move to lowsec, people who want to shoot more people move to null and people who want to live like a hermit move to wormholes, and the people who do not want any form of pvp, who love the pve and just wana do their thing, leave them alone in Highsec.
---
Must be just me, but when I logi, I don't want to be on killmails.
---
Does it matter? He already spends money on an omega to  do a friend invite. And then he spends 5$ for the pack. Why is that acceptable and spending 200$ isnt for a speedrun?
---
Sounds like a plan! Thanks for letting me know about tool too, had no idea they weren’t on Spotify.
---
Sadly they both quit eve to celebrate their honeymoon in an indonesian gay bar

shhhhjj
---
Have you seen World of Warcraft ? Or Runescape who give you items for having MFA ?
---
Tell me about it. PIRAT is generally competent from what I've seen of them, but these guys act like a bunch of scrubs that just want to attack everyone without getting CONCORDOKKEN'd. Someone in the E-Uni Mumble even said JkMuX provoked TEST into declaring war on them like it was some kind of achievement, and another guy said it was the first time he'd ever seen Unistas fighting alongside PIRAT.
---
Not much
---
Wait, *they're* the ones responsible for that? Dammit, now I wish their wardec hadn't expired so I could hunt them down and blow them up.
---
This has been asked many times before, shitty anime genres notwithstanding. And it always confuses the hell out of me. New Eden is such a completely fucked place to be, think I'd just want to be a Thukker caravaneer and keep as far away from the center of the goings-on as I can.
---
He meant to kill me lol
---
fac
---
well if we arent born as capsuleers i would hole heartedly agree. but since this is eve i would take advantage of my immortality. while everybody else is like "what do we do how do we get back?" i will be taking advantage of the confusion. no one ever goes home in isekia. so why not live the best you? eve is harsh and unforgiving. be ruthless in this hypothetical. and i agree with it being a  shitty genre. just thinking of new book ideas and i needed to get this out of my head so i wont write anymore fan fics i wont publish. not a fruitful use of my time.
---
I actually wanted to ask what you meant by "reborn as a capsuleer". Do you mean, isekai-style, just drop into a life with most of your formative experiences already behind you? Because the requirements for becoming one are incredible demanding, and the process for becoming a capsuleer *sucks*.
---
If everyone wasnt a prick in player corporations, that would help too. Ive been in 15 or so corps, from 30 pilots to the biggest in the game, and it seems like the vast majority of people in them are completely apathetic and unresponsive, a solid chunk are "lol fuck you git gud htfu lol" and perhaps 2% are decent people that are actually fun to play with. Game's got a culture problem to tackle before you can get newbros to actually enjoy being funneled into player corps.
---
Not really true. I know quite a few highsec bears from my near decade of play, they kinda just like the number go up. I know a guy (we shared a mission hub for a few years) who had played for 4 years, running l4 missions, in an npc corp. Those people pay subs too.
---
Ugh Eve Onion finally got me.
---
You leave those in about 10 minutes.
---
Quill18 over on YouTube just made a pretty good tutorial spanning the first few hours in the game. He's by no means the most knowledgeable player  but that itself might be helpful to other newbros.
---
That is completely untrue. Most medium guns are quite solid, maybe not in the huge f1 monkey fleet context, but in small gang. Pulses and beams are both very solid on hulls like the Omen Navy, Phantasm, Harbinger, Harb Navy, Aug Navy, Zealot etc. Blasters are also decent on brawler hulls like the Vexor, Vexor Navy, Thorax, Deimos, Brutix, Brutix Navy etc. I don't need to say anything about rails as everyone and their father has been running those. For missiles, rapid lights are amazing and heavy missiles see some use in Cerb fleets and on some kiting ships like Heavy Missile Drake Navies. Although HAMs are kinda garbage tier like ACs are sadly.
---
Do I need to submit a stool sample or will this post be enough?
---
Haha I’m pretty sure you sent me half an ISK yesterday
---
I don't remember getting suicide ganked and podded in the tutorials. Just blowing up a station by ramming it with a frigate and having another frigate blown up by a horde of NPC subcaps.
---
It's the only named system in Syndicate
---
this post plus any stainguy post equals one well formatted post
---
Cool thanks for the summary.
---
&gt;yeah this is a known goon no lifer as you can tell
---
has 300 accounts
---
???????
---
*Thank you*. I'd been following EvE for years before I started playing so I knew what I was getting into, but other would-be players aren't as informed as I was. The tutorials should be hammering the first rule of playing EvE into a new player's skull again and *again* and ***againandagainandagain*** until they can recite it by heart, and I'd bet good money that some of the players who left EVE after trying it out for a week would have kept playing *if they had known what to expect*.
---
Furthermore, the tutorial can't just tell players to harden the fuck up, it needs to show them *how*. Preferably by giving them several first-hand experiences of what some players will do to you in hisec if they let their guard down.
---
It's funny how these things work. Here's a little story that's relevant-ish to what you were trying: 
---
Once upon a time I was brawling on a highsec gate in a Rattlesnake and I had the red skull from podding someone in a previous fight, eventually I ended up deaggroing because the people I brawled brought too much. Anyway, with nowhere to go I decided to jump into highsec and sacrifice myself to Concord. However, after jumping I noticed that I only had 20 seconds on my red skull timer and that Concord hadn't showed up as I was still gate cloaked. I waited the 20 seconds and burned back to gate aaaaaaannnd Concord didn't shoot and I jumped safely back into lowsec.
---
interacting with marshy on any levels is dangerous for your sodium chloride levels
---
a fedo
---
So true...so true.
---
EVE can adapt without changing the core gameplay by hammering the game's #1 rule into their heads from the moment they log in and all throughout the tutorial missions. As of right now, it isn't doing that.
---
Keep them coming !
---
I don’t get it that’s an apostle
---
It requires some special brainpower to understand the formatting
---
&gt;The Fedos crawled over him. Their emissions felt like perfume.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;He scratched the first one behind the calciferous ridges on its back. The Fedo, excited, scrambled higher onto his chest. He kept scratching, but his fingers slipped and poked through, into its soft meat. It didn't seem to mind. He could swear that it was vibrating from pleasure.  
---
&gt;He felt as their mouths, with their tiny rows of coarse, serrated cartilage, suckled at him, cleaning, looking for nourishment.  
---
&gt;The one he'd scratched was now at his right nipple. He closed his eyes and sighed.
---
I'm not one to kinkshame, normally, but...you nasty
---
Offf, gees if we assume even a 20 hour bot workday that is uninterrupted that's a disgusting 12 bil daily profit.  Gees I did not realize the sheer kindof money they were generating with even a "small" bot operation.  You'd really have to keep hitting them each day, and early even to make it not worth the time, and what real person is gonna put in that kindof effort everyday for...what? until they possibly get annoyed enough to move their operation?  This is quite disheartening to think about.  Good job nonetheless, I dont mean to take your glory away in anyway, I guess im just realizing how awful fighting botting really is and the uphill battle of it.
---
dude, It was the early days of zKill that inspired it. There was zKill a cool global board that seemed to emerge as a clean alternative to the various corp/alliance?? based boards (hazy memory), and I thought a pure solo kill tracking board, ranking solo pilots, global leaderboards, stats, lalala, make your own rankings/competitions etc type stuff..  would be awesome.
---
but then I realized the fatal flaw aand gave up.
---
Wait the link got removed :(
---
Well we are all going to see. Pretty sure everyone will find something to hate pretty soon.
---
Doing l4's I can make a few hundred million in a casual evening. Perfect skills and a specialized blitzing ship, and its boring-ish so theres a downside, but its consistent, easy, and almost 0 risk. Could do a lot worse to fund your pvp endeavours.
---
I admire your optimism, but this is the boundary between altruism and money.
---
It’s good for the game.
---
grrr goon hat goon bad man is bad goon bad grr!
---
hey they could use the blockchain
---
just merge the conflicts and have a review
---
Huh. I thought there was more to it than that.
---
Mar5hy is the premiere solo pvp'er of our EVE generation, John clearly doesn't know who he's talking to. That no lifer just doesn't understand ~~you can totally have a life with input broadcasting and log-on bots for numerous accounts~~.
---
This made me think. 
---
We now need a nice animation when a bubble goes down. It just vanishes right now.
---
If you write a series, you should do one on you at your allies
---
Period basis and omist is full of real human being players, "xddyr gffft" said so in local
---
What changed for the good? 
---
The not having local gives a fantastic element of surprise in engagement. I do love people automaticly cant just dock up instantly you jump into system. There are a lot of people out small gang cruising because of this and it makes things exciting.
---
The bad...
---
There is no limitation on no local. Now what may have been a slight advantage to a hunter or roam is now a DUNK. I did some roams with my corp ... We used cloaky tackle and Recons and we killed a bunch of shit; was great.
---
Went DED running in a blinged out blops and got caught was a close fight but... I lost because 6 recons then a drek came in killed me with... guess &gt; cloakys and recons... (gf).
---
So adding in an aspect of no local I think is great; but with no local... covert cynos... recons... cloaky everything... its all just too much for any long term sustainability... unless its rorquals/supers. I think its super lazy or incompetent game design. Would be nice if there was like a highslot mod that removed you from local, or dscan, or cloak... but not all three at the same time... but that would take some effort to implement. No turn off local... aww shit we can even turn it on or off now... fuck ... guys don't unsub ;)
---
This “gatekeeping” of forcing me to earn ISK before purchasing a ship is really taking a shit on the game. All ships and modules should be available to anyone at no cost — I’m sure it’s easy for the rich veteran players to support this kind of gatekeeping since it doesn’t affect them.
---
Here's the amazing thing about being a capsuleer: You can be nobody, and still be mind-blowingly wealthy. The average family can save up 10,000 ISK in a *lifetime*; you could patrol highsec asteroid belts, run a few agent missions, do PI on the lowest-yield highsec planet... In New Eden terms, you're a nobody, but you'd still be dragging in enough revenue to live in conditions that'd be king-like to your modern-Earth mind. I'm talking beyond Jeff Bezos, beyond Saudi Prince levels of 'rich'. "I want to buy a private spaceship the size of an aircraft carrier" rich.
---
You can still fly frigates and get that adrenaline hit. You could even strap yourself into some VR setup and get 90% of the way to being a Clone Soldier.
---
Honestly, why *not*?

What is a good, active, UZ TZ, Wormhole corp?

---
&gt;  no local has had no impact on me
---
Enjoying it personally, makes fights a lot more spooky in general, big fleet fights you don't know when groups jump in.   
---
I have been hunting in Delve a bit and it's fun knowing the ratter you are keeping eyes on won't know you are in local. So getting a chance to learn a lot of stuff. Yeah, happy so far.
---
but, but r/eve said that... :)
---
Can someone explain to me what on earth a "ML-EKP 'Polybolos' Ballistic Control System" is? I don't remember seeing an hour glass icon in the top left before.
---
It seems like the problem lies in the hate some PvE/PvP players hold for the "other team", as it were. I have no issue with folks who want to spend all their time doing PvP, and I'm planning to start doing some of it myself once I build up enough of a stockpile that I can afford to lose ships regularly, but it's kinda hard to not get angry when some jerk in a Hecate shows up in the deadspace site I'm running and blows up my ship explicitly because he doesn't like people doing PvE and thinks they're carebears.
---
That, right there? That is the kind of small-minded pettiness EvE *doesn't* need. I realize that in low and null are dangerous places and I've got no problem with that. I think it's fine and dandy that players can ambush each other and how the game encourages you to keep your guard up at all times. Hell, before I joined E-Uni I was part of a nullsec group that operated in Syndicate, and keeping an eye out for someone trying to jump a Wolf in on top of me was all part of the fun, but having someone keep me from running a site out of pure fucking meanness because they hate the idea of someone doing PvE *at all* ought to be heavily discouraged.
---
Regional Chat Encapsulation feature.... not a bug.
---
I'd like to be whichever one can delete anime and weebs from existence
---
Here's a tip. If you start ratting. Keep an eye on your intel channels and d-scan often. If you're within range of a gate. Someone jumping in can d-scan you down before they even uncloak. Running anomalies and belt ratting is far more dangerous than scanning combat sigs and running those. If you're in a sig, you'll see probes before anything.
---
Insure your ship. If you can. fit a cloak. Only spend an hour in one spot. Dotlan will show your NPC activity and it's a bright light for hunters. And finally if you die... so what.
---
I think on behalf of all of us I can say thankyou for your contribution to the game.
---
pretty sure the hamster has been dead for a while, the wheel is merely spinning on its own and slowing down...
---
That symbol is limited edition I believe - like a reward for an event, etc.
---
Even if the capsuleer training is gruesome, if you wanted to avoid all politics and intrigue you could still just load up your favourite ship with exotic dancers, fedos, spiced wine, and then retire to a wormhole. I'd imagine that to be an easier lifestyle than any non-capsuleer could have.
---
brawling hybrids with null nearly match med acs
---
Okay, this is obviously stupid but.... Random cynos!
---
When you click jump, you load grid at a random cyno within range.
---
Dude, try to use the thing inside your head. I meant the aggressor is killed by the Concord, when I said getting killed by the game. So the ganker is getting killed by the game here. It is not PvP. Ganker kills the unexpected victim that can not defend itself, Concord kills the ganker. So it is not PvP.
---
I choose CCP, so I can fuck the universe and your in-game dreams.
---
I think it's a module that required certain resources to build that you could only acquire during an event.
---
When politics spill out from eve and into reddit lmfao
---
So that was me, saw a huge mining op in an ice belt as I was coming back to Thera. I stole from a rat wreck to see what would happen, and I wasn't disapointed as both a Skiff and an Orca sent their (T1) drones at my Wolf . It hurted a lot but was ultimately pointless without any tackle. I extended my limited engagement while my suspect timer expired, and came back in a Tengu with two points. The Skiff pilot was nice enough to sacrifice a Marshall to Bob in addition to his first offering.
---
Remember kids, crime pays, as I got most of the loot. [It was a good day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UqMyldS7Q)
---
Fact 1: If it was not an issue, it would not be mentioned in the most helpful review in the last 30 days on Steam.  
---
Fact 2: No one is crying except the people who are against any kind of change, in the form of REEEEEEEE, as demonstrated by you.
---
Comrades, this man is in shock, get him to the infirmary...
---
the chat did not explode, it was the hydrogen tank!
---
How is being "awake" is gonna change anything? An no, whatever you do, with enough DPS on the field, you will die. Much more easily in a mining barge piloted by a rookie. And trust me, some people will go all the way to troll and grief another player. You would know this yourself, unless you are 12 and just met with the internet?
---
There is lots of counterplay.
---
You can pick a different route
---
Reduce the value gained from ganking you
---
Make your ship harder to kill
---
Lots of math to be done and fun to be had before a single shot is fired.
---
Imagine not KM whoring friendlies
---
It’s a BCS that also improved explosion velocity, so you can apply better to smaller targets.
---
Good video dude. I would personally turn the video around. Have the pvp footage first and then explain your fitting and your mistakes etc.  
---
Also how can you live with yourself having screenshake on while warping.
---
sucks to be you
---
I don't have the faintest idea where those drop. Also interested in the answer.
---
My idea of credible argument is, look you dumb oaf, there are many people who don't like this sort of mechanic, as you can see by the number of ups the review got. So it is not "some guy's opinion". On the contrary, it is the opinion of many against yours alone.
---
sounds like u need to learn to adapt to harsh environments :)
---
If what you said was true, I would claim to remove null, low and wh space all together, but I don't. Seriously, wake the fuck up. At this point all you can come up with are false accusations.
---
&gt; drops 2 dread, bombers and blops to kill a single ratting carrier
---
&gt; spend half you siege cycle aligning one place, the moment it ends you warp to another place in a complete different align, then complains that the rapier is gonna bump your phoenix while turning
---
i know this video is satirical so there's no point harping on the rest but sweet god it hurt to watch
---
Accounts were hacked and restored within a day before 2FA was a thing. If you honestly think CCPs CS team is actually staffed with more than 2 Indian guys these days you are dilusional.
---
And you fail to come up with anything other than pointing at writing mistakes of your opponent. Looks like you are finished. Move along.
---
Nope, that’s the point of “unlimited” and “instant”. Even if you have an existing JC timer, you can jump in a citadel to a clone in the same citadel
---
Oh good, there for a second I thought it looked all jumbled up because I was having a stroke
---
👏👏
---
m u n n i n b t w
---
If that's your standard for data, there are a lot more posts and comments here telling you that you're a whinging numpty than there are in support of that review.
---
Maybe try actual data instead of, an opinion piece from Man-On-The-Internet.
---
why the hell does some hisec rando have a marshal lmao
---
Well yeah that's what I meant with presentation problems. Like I pointed out in the discussion with that other guy nobody thinks it's unfair to get shot in a counter strike map.  The game rules in eve allow pvp anywhere. People who kill you while you're running ded sites just feel the game is one big cs map, and they're not wrong to think that. But I don't think people who perceive that as grieving or meaness are completely delusional either. The fact so many people feel that way is a failure of CCP to present the game for what it is, not them being soft pussies or anything.
---
how the fuck did this marshal managed to die?  
---
it's not like this tengu was full neut fit....
---
You want to be a capsule. Welcome brother.
---
You show me the stats that CODE. ganking has no relation with new player retention rates then. All the proof are there in the review backed up by more than 100 people on Steam. If the opinion of majority is not enough for you maybe you should avoid voicing your own opinion. 0 upvotes and 0 downvotes that is. By the way, most places on earth deal with problems by the opinion of majority. Maybe you live in a non-democratic place. It would explain a lot. I am sorry for you mate.
---
I fucking love no local and there is not bad aspect it this change.
---
How are you going to bling a Skiff in 1.5b worth of crap and still hve t1 drones?
---
Alliance chat seems to be in a sort of delayed mode as well, idk whether it is because there are usually 1500-1700 people in my alliance chat to save bandwidth, or a universal thing with the blackout. Whenever someone does talk they do appear.
---
But not we already are sticking blobs emitting gases and ozzes...
---
You just got blown up by the lowest low lifes of the lowest, dont blame yourself. Staging up EVE might take years man. I am with game since beginning, been doing multitude of careers and as you know the possibilities are endless. Take it slow in enjoy, any rushed non rational steps will cost you everything. I advice you caution and welcome back.
---
0 resists.
---
Yes you just wake up as your main. And now have to choose what you wanna do.
---
As a logi bro I say always kill logi first
---
*Okay so with a slew of new isekia anime coming out* fuck off
---
The move is what you wanna be then
---
There are a lot more comments but not a lot more actual people, try to see the difference. Of course gankers are gonna REEEEE and cry and bitch and moan about this idea as hard as they  can. Still does not mean majority.
---
hahahaha I like to get the full effect of tunnel warp, you know, live action :P
---
And it's funny you mention it, it actually crossed my mind today to do that next video, run the combat footage then have the commentary at the end. Or, maybe cut down on the commentary time at the start for the next one.
---
Few hours max 24 hours. Always very PRO replies from CCCP
---
A Gurista with one caveat—an industry quality clone and bay.
---
There are 19 comments in total on that review from 11 unique posters.
---
You have a reddit post with 270+ comments sitting at net-0 upvotes and far more unique posters than 11.
---
Not really sure you know what a "majority" is.
---
I just bought a seperate numpad as I have a TKL keyboard, and I mapped some broadcasts, and drone shortcuts onto it. You could also get something like a razer orbweaver if you have the cash to get it.
---
Gatekeeping.
---
Ah, alright then. My main's a Caldari. I think I'd try to start a new kind of gladitorial sport among capsuleers in partnership with Nugoeihuvi or whoever's in control of Caldari entertainment right now. Like Quidditch but with cruise missiles.
---
Report to CCCP immediately or enjoy ban for RMT ok bye.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
Hey look, it's the bi-monthly Goons bitch about Marshy post.
---
What made me angry was the sheer pettiness of the act; if he had done it because he wanted the site and its loot for himself I would have understood, just like I would have understood him doing it because I had some bling mods on my ship and he wanted them for himself. But he didn't, he just hated PvE and wanted to ruin my fun because I didn't feel the same way. I think players like that are just as much a cancer to this game as bots, even though bots are obviously far more severe a problem than assholes.
---
Isk isn't locked behind a loading bar.
---
It was from an event, I think It was operation permafrost. Iirc It looted from the sites that spawned, Its a ballistic with less damage but a little application bonus.
---
Use a buddy code
---
I would imagine the most traffic you'll see is going to or from Jita. But that's also where you'll see the most gate campers as well, b/c they also know that's where the traffic will be.
---
There are a few Hauling based chat channels you can join. Where you can negotiate for better rates than you might see just randomly posted in Contracts.
---
If you see some Contracts with very low rewards, then don't take them. Maybe send a message to them suggesting what you would be willing to do it for, and see if they bite.
---
Don't just take a single Contract and undock. Fill up your hold as best you can, that way you're maximizing your profit for the trip. Yes, that does mean you make an even juicier target. But it means you're saving trips.
---
Learn how to use the Map to see where recent kills are happening. Then mark those systems to avoid, and let the computer find a route around them.
---
aye, I'm blind.

I can't discuss the details, but can assure you that mistakes happen, and CCP does correct them.
---
It can really freak one out, logging in and having your account banned (or perma-banned), after investing a lot of time and emotion.
---
Brave Newbies leadership decides to branch out into Albion Online. Then, after weeks of difficult brain work, figured they coild make it look like a copycat to get attention and thus recruits
---
I’m not much help with the T1 haulers but Train into a DST, and then hit me up in game, Dex Patrouette, and I’ll help you get started with some collateral and I’ll show you the ropes ;)
---
To me it sounds like you have more in your hole than you can reasonably defend. Whats your Corp name again?
---
Tbh quidditch with cruise missiles doesn't sound bad.
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
EvE has graphics?
---
Wait, you can set the computer to plot around dangerous systems? Wow, that's nifty.
---
I've been trying to fill up my hold. Thing is I don't have a ton of capital for collateral, so I can only take jobs that pay out like 500k to 1mil apiece and those tend to fill up my hold. I'm using the Tayra max cargo fit off UniWiki, if that helps.
---
How do I join a chat channel, and do you have a specific hauling one to recommend?
---
What's a DST?
---
In any case I'll shoot you a message! Thanks!

I get that. If you think that's petty you haven't tried FW where you have people camping high sec routes for hours each day to try and alpha fw toon haulers. There's no skill in it and yeah it's hard to not call that petty. But again, I do think it's a mindset problem. Those people just enjoy padding their kb like getting a highscore in an arcade game. The game rules allow it. I think a lot of the perceived grief will go away if people just see the gameworld as one open free for all arena and act accordingly.

I thought I read all of these a long time ago, WTF, I have some reading to do.
---
...I don't think you understand what antimatter does when it's exposed to normal matter. [Here's a hint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wXtm7YIRWM).
---
It's official now. ಠ‿ಠ
---
It's all meaningless traffic cone.  Don't kid yourself.
---
Conveniently with very white names.
---
Meet Phil and Edward from CS
---
I've been new not too long ago, and yes meta items are very confusing.
---
They actually only get less annoying and confusing when you can cross-check pyfa and the market and see which meta version is the best for the buck. Or maybe it's better than T2 for some reason.
---
Players interested in min-maxing will discover pyfa. New players should just get the right fit and try things.
---
Oh hey, another TSSOC guy! Nice work! Surprised how many just didn't have Warriors, tbh.
---
You see these are the answers I'm looking for! We are fucking capsuleers! We are immortal demi gods with eternity at our finger tips and no limits to what we can do! Also why just capsuleers? Personally would start a semi annual death game on a colony out in hull. Come kneel come all ye who wish to be rich. Capsuleers could sponsor champions and the last man surviving gets a bill.
---
I'd be a random crewman on the Veldnaught.
---
Why am I not surprised your a goon?
---
If you don't get in there, shoot me a message. I have a good feeling about you.
---
Is he still camping delve? I havent seen him in local

[T2 tanky haulers](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Hauling#Deep_Space_Transport), see them flying through jspace all the time with T3C escorts.
---
Deep Space Transport. Larger tankier hauler.
---
Unless you like hauling (or anything in Eve), don't do it!
---
There are so many ways to earn ISK in Eve, so find one you like doing!
---
You can get 'paid' for hauling by buying-low, adding value (which is what hauling is:  a value-added service), and selling at a higher price.
---
Examples (which may or may not be practical):
---
* Buy ore, compress it, optionally refine it, and haul to market.
---
* Buy ice / compressed ice in systems with ice fields (see DOTLAN), refine it, and haul the products to market.
---
* Buy 'mission trash' (example:  cap charges in Amarr space), reprocess it, and haul minerals to market.  [Another example:  long ago, I used to buy meta 3 and 4 missile launchers cheap in Amarr space, and sell them in Caldari space.]
---
* Find a 0.5 system, and buy moon materials.  Either haul as-is (ouch), or react it in-system, and haul products to market.
---
* Buy (or manufacture) items required for loyalty point store purchases, and sell those items at mission hubs.
---
I could go on-and-on, and I actually did all of the above at some point in my Eve career.

We got ourselves a good old fashioned "clearly throwing down more isk will make me more skilled" type.
---
Getting moved out of UALX took about 6 hours.
---
Need some things clarified.
---
Is Mar5hy a goon or against goons?
---
And seriously 300 account or is that an exaggeration.
---
Yeah that's what I mean. What would you do, though? You have eternity and more money than God! What do you do to entertain yourself? Starts. Cult? Join the cult of Bob? Worship a piece of Steve until it starts talking to you? Go to war with one of the major powers? Purge the amarr? What would you do I'm new eden if you weren't bound to a pod for your whole existence?
---
It would be quite bizarre to have the Brave organization under 501c4.
---
Nah the rogue drones are were it's at. Figure out there have mind systen and ymthen you can bring back online all those alts currently hibernating.
---
Multiboxing isn't the issue. It's never been the actual issue. It's killability. Nobody complains about 20 hulks in a belt. Why? They can be killed. Like I said, remove panic, give them capital mining lasers instead of drones. Proper risk vs  reward can now take place. Opens up a ton of options for bomber fleets, dread bombs and WH groups.
---
But didn't that ship crash into caldera prime?
---
&gt; What's a DST?
---
Deep Space Transport.  A tech 2 industrial.  Slow, but bigger capacity, and can be more sturdy (record holder I think is Caldari Bustard, but the other races have benefits too).
---
Also related, a 'BR' or Blockade Runner.  A smaller tech 2 industrial than is very quick, and can fit a covert cloaking device.  Great for hauling smaller expensive items.  They are immune to cargo scans.  BR should never be un-cloaked, as they are often attacked on-sight in the hopes they will drop something valuable.

How the fuck does a Marshall get solo'd by a tengu
---
[oh...](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78266900/)
---
There was someone posting stories about playing eve without ever docking up here. I cannot find any of the old posts or what he's up to now.
---
Also there was the guy with the whole JF and courier service, jared something? I wonder if he's still playing.
---
Your invuln timer was broken as soon as you clicked align.
---
Lol it's ironic how EVE is so sandboxy to the point where it can sandbox itself to death since it can't protect new players.
---
&gt; Wait, you can set the computer to plot around dangerous systems? Wow, that's nifty.
---
By default Jita is on the 'avoid' list, because it is so busy.  You may choose to remove it.
---
Right click on the 'A' info panel (near top left of screen).
---
Rule of Eve:  right-click everything!
---
You don't make good money by hauling unless you have a jump freighter.
---
I think they cracked the enigma code with less brainpower than it took for me to decipher this fucking smog
---
A lot has changed. No one really does small gang drake/hurricanes sadly.
---
Meta is pretty much: retribution,kiki,loki,jackdaw, keres,Brutix navy some more options I can't think of atm. Drake/hurricane can still work but I wouldn't call them meta
---
Treat this as a completely different game. Nothing you used to know matters beyond the basic mechanics. Too many changes that if you rely on that old information you will screw yourself.
---
Can I see your logi-frigate fits?   
---
You've got me *very curious.*   
---
Also, logi needs to focus on logi, not whoring on killmails.
---
How do they do that when blocs would drop by with their super blob for fun fishing trips whenever they feel bored?
---
I've caught a few trying to gate to highsec however all the ones ive caught were empty
---
Hams are really good for tengus tho
---
If you are picking up courier contracts make sure you plot the route ahead of time. Avoid any contract that requires null or lowsec until you understand the mechanics more
---
Not really sure you know either. There are more than 100 upvotes on that review. When you consider the REEEEEEE meta in this sub, of course the whiners are gonna downvote harder than anyone.
---
As someone getting back into EVE after some time.. I'm interested!
---
Then the chat system must be broken.
