Because it's the case. I don't understand why people want so badly to catch ratting ships, aside the fact that they are easy targets and post almost no risk for the attacker to lose his ship.

The literal best part of that hell camp was how easy it was to froth up you morons into believing hacks were being employed to sneak those supers out - then you consistently fed subcaps to roaming gangs for a week and fucked up when the supers broke out.

Unless this also shuts down corp tax income then all that happens is that alliances have corporations set their corp tax to a minimum level and then charge them that equivalent.

If it does shut down corp tax income then hope your corp doesn't want any offices or other ongoing charges.

It took a good year and a half for the Imperium to get it through to most people’s heads exactly what to do when the enemy comes for our rorquals. Until we got this well organised we used to have Pandemic Legion come on Reddit and boast how many millions of Rorquals we were losing everyday in Delve. Apparently we were the running joke for months at one time if I recall. Until we stopped losing so many and began killing enemies really well one day and developed great defences. After that we’ve heard no end of bitching and non stop calls to “nerf the rorqual “ it’s become a never ending whine. It’s not the Rorqual that’s the problem here. After all I’m blowing up enemy rorquals often enough on the other foot. The problem squarely lays at the feet of our shitty and useless enemies who can’t seem to organise a piss up in a brewery. Get good!

We got pinged to get off STK citadels, I didn't know why but I heard something about awoxing. I guess that's the reason why.
---
Well I was saying that as well, but I'm talking about overall alt numbers.  Whatever the number of current subscribed accounts to the game, there are half as many humans playing EVE, roughly.  That's not logged into the game right now, just overall.  Though that number is probably a good indicator for the logged in numbers as well

You have a solid point!

When you wanted Walk in Stations then go on to say "Not like this!"

The idea of pushing a button and getting pvp is sort of the ideal model for facwar sites, if you ask most people.  They've tried other (badly implemented) ways of providing more constant, instant-gratification pvp that were still part of the sandbox.  Personally, I'd rather get ganked by a gang of 5 risk averse fucks using a bait punisher, but still with my chance to escape, every day over having to pve first to get the option of pvp, then in that option only face the sort of bling-fit min-maxers you pvp in other games.  The real issue imo with instanced pvp is that there is no nonconsensual pvp (i.e. I tried to warp out of the plex but your tackle got me, now I have to fight outnumbered) and all the fits are pretested, and the meta is narrowed, taking away the sandbox scenario in which pvp fits really openly counter each other.
---
My point is that instanced pvp in this sense is designed to satisfy one of the eve player's itches, but doesn't fundamentally answer that player's desire to play a sandbox game.  It's just half assed.
---
Nah. Fuck local. Saturday night was a blast.

&gt; but when I was on the CSM we were quoted that there was around roughly 1.5 to 1.7 subscribed accounts per human.

And when was that? Was that by any chance before skill injectors were introduced?

For starters, this mechanic heavily favors the side with more people, so there's that.

---
Poooor mr fedo not enough love.
---
Indeed it was, so like I said it's probably gone up a fair bit.  But even if there was a 30-40% increase, it would still average out to around two accounts per human
---
You said rage rolling was effective, there is your solution. 
---
You had a 100+ numerical advantage in that fight along with backup pods, people outside the hole would be useless but you had a full fleet of dudes still sitting there how where sleeping. 
---
Yes if you lost the hac fight things might have turned out differently but having the pressure of having backup pods. 
---
so the time of control even IF hk won would have been rather limited, plus you were fighting against people that were up for 10+ hours getting in real life tiredness plays a roll in such an eviction. 
---
Thanks.
---
I still don't see how facwar sites couldn't provide push-button pvp that has a more open meta and a dynamic sandbox playstyle.  Your complaints about the bling meta are exactly the issues with instanced pvp in other games: in a narrow meta, the sweatiest nerds with the most capital will always win.  In a setting like facwar sites (were they working ideally/more populated/less full of bots) you would have escalation options for that blingy dude, you could bring in backup, etc.  The fact that instead of fixing facwar they added a new frankenstein instanced pvp-pve thing is exactly what I mean when I say they demonstrate an inability to comprehend why their game is popular and who plays it in the first place.
---
it says fleet issue ship, not ships.
---
&gt; But even if there was a 30-40% increase, it would still average out to around two accounts per human

There's no point in speculation because we don't have the numbers.

If you're looking for HONOUR you came to the wrong game my friend. 
---
You couldn't be farther from it.

Ah me bad at reading... But the lesson still stands. FW is not a 1v1 arena. Always expect someone to drop in. And in medium plex, there is always probability of combat recon accompanying that lone T1 frigate that you see on dscan.
---
If you've just joined us in EvE you're going to end up with a list full of over 9000 strategies that you deem 'unfair'. Buckle up and make friends or it'll just hurt worse.

It was 1.5 that we were quoted.
---
CSM9 was in 2015, injectors came out in early 2016, and alpha clones came out late 2016.

so yes, it was before everybody in the game added on 5 alts, with a few adding 100+

But yeah, I agree with pgl that it's probably gone up in the last year or so, though not by anything like 30%. Maybe 10% at most.
---
Or.... You could just hack one, maybe 2 cans and then warp immediatly 
---
Listen- I came from a mmo much like EVE but it was a medieval setting, the idea floated around removing local and some private servers did it. DO. NOT. DO. THIS. The only thing you will end up with is zero small scale fights because you will never be able to find anyone, because you don't know where anyone is. This isn't some frantic froth-filled bullshit that's all speculation, I've experienced this before.

The best way to do these sites is to scan the useful cans, hack them all at the same time and leave grid at the same time. No one dies.

Making the grid cyno-jammed would be great, though.  This game so desperately needs a reason for the defender to field subcaps other than tackle

we had \~200 stukas and you had \~180 hacs ontop of that we had \~60 ravens. Hacs should beat stukas and ravens arent known to be hac killers either... you had the advantage and fucked up and thats okay (we even counted on that cause every group we ever faced had this painful first lesson in fighting stukas).
---
If the fight would have been lost it would have been the end cause we wouldnt be able to contest the 2nd reff of the keepstar a few hours later - pushing the whole thing an entire week if we would chose to keep trying. We would have tried to gain back hole control in eutz together with snuff and reavers who were in the hole. In that tz we would have had a good chance probably but the hk side would have the control in ustz again and thats where we need to get the people in from since the keepstar timer would be ustz.
---
We don’t have to but neither do we have to be good people on Reddit 
---
&gt;It was 1.5, and it was both:
---
&gt;http://jestertrek.com/eve/pop-alts.png
---
&gt;Source: CCP Quant (though I also saw an earlier version of this chart by CCP EyjoG)
---
&gt;But yeah, I agree with pgl that it's probably gone up in the last year or so, though not by anything like 30%. Maybe 10% at most.
---
I wonder how CCP reaches that estimate. I don't know anyone who doesn't have at least 2 accounts, most people I know have 3-5. Maybe that's just the bubble I'm in, but I find 1.5 accounts per player very hard to believe.
---
Perhaps the massive increase of alpha accounts by non-paying customers has stabilized the number somewhat (off-setting skill farms, rorqual alts and what not). However, if my gut-feeling is right and non-active account are being taken into consideration in CCP's estimate of accounts per player then that number is not really representative of reality.
---
Also, Jester, now that I have you here, do you think you could update [this fella?](http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-fouryear-compro.png). Really interested to see what it says now.

Connect bounty payout to IHub/TCU and pay all bounty as tags. So you have to fight for your payout, if the bad guys want it. Keep the take/share as is.

Me neither. Well besides that it might provoke a response. Or just to disrupt krabbers of some alliance you don't like. With tools like near2 it's just way too easy to provide a risk free environment. Ofc huge alliances who put in the effort and infrastructure deserve to farm their space, but every reasonable person will agree the current situation is ridiculous and not good for the game on multiple levels.
---
But personally I just don't like local in general, and not just for those reasons as op implies. I want to get rid of it across the board. So also in high and low sec.

Kept the supers out of play for 5+ days, and they limped back the fuck home right after.

New Eden will burn with the fury of his wrath ^TM.
---
Putting big stakes on ratting payouts will only cause every roaming fleet getting dropped by titans even sooner. People who propose such ‘easy’ fixes have no idea how 0sec works.
---
So removing local would remove small scale fights(all the time in wspace btw the place that doesn't have it) and you can easily find people :shrug:
---
Congratulations on killing his tackle solo before he burned you down. People don't like losing ships period, it's the product of the time and energy people spend grinding the ISK to buy it. Heading out solo in particular is pvp on hard mode. Getting dog piled, out shiped or out played is commonplace in New Eden. Take heart in your victories and the solo kill mail. Also going out with buddies really does increase your engagement profile although it could lead to people not wanting to take fights. 
---
How do you pvp in abyssal sites? I thought when you activate the filament you get taken to a place where others cannot join you?
---
they would have to be reworked to be able to return, the best bet would be as a special module for T2 ships. a Minelayer module would deploy them as a sort of invisible(?) and static missile that activates when a ship gets into range of it.
---
they would have a short lifespan to ensure people cannot just drop a bunch of them and lag the system the same way its done with containers or mobile depots. probably no more than a few minutes after being launched so you could in theory field them and wait if someone fell into the trap but you would have to redeploy them after a while.
---
best if included with the addition of a new T2 Minelayer ship with bonuses dedicated to them like increasing their response range, damage or having shorter cycles between deploys (but lifetime still being the same, they would just spam more in the same frame of time).
---
I don't believe that for a second. Outside of hundreds or thousands of botted alphas being counted as 'different players', I could barely name 1 or 2 players that run 1 account and at least a hundred who run 2-40 accounts. Even poors are running many accounts because they become almost free at 5.5mil sp

It normally doesn’t if you have to skills trained up, I’ve done it many times in a t1, cargo scan 3 or 4 and hack the one with the best loot. Worst case you lose a t1

Forcing people to defend taxes will make roaming 0sec close to impossible.

Just find a friend, and then find the system that guy is camping. Warp in a max tank fit punisher with several neuts, and when he brings in his backup, tackle it and neut it dry, then bring in your own. 
---
If you can’t win the game, then change the rules. 
---
You can cloak if you're outside of the plex's "bubble", the 30km bubble surrounding the beacon within the plex.  People hiding/cloaking things inside medium plexes with something acting as bait isn't too uncommon in FW.
---
You already have to defend taxes.  Trust me, I have a fair amount of experience making people defend that tax income.
---
Actually it's 77b
---
You need to bring your alts
---
The best piece of advice in EVE could give you is don't fly something you cannot afford to replace. I treat my solo PVP ships like casino money I never undock in something that I'm not willing to lose. I try not to whelp but it's not always avoidable. If I get a good fight or some exciting close calls I count it was time well spent. 
---
Give it a few more years I can't wait to have supers that cost less them my subcaps lmao.

You also need to account for the fact that the people who are logged on more often are the more hardout ones who are also more likely to have alts. The average number of alts that they state is pulled down lots by the casual guys who log in once or twice a month and have a single account subbed.

That is actually very interesting news!

It's only a natural progression to find somewhere to talk about the game when the in game chat system doesn't even work.
---
In tier3 and above, if there are enough people running abyssal sites, a gate to a proving ground appears in the final room. It's optional but good rewards go to the victor, and there is a chance that nobody is there so you get the reward uncontested.

That's not how the force works

all this is going to do is reinforce large alliances, hurt fringe members  of coalitions, small coalitions, renters, and botter renters.  its would reinforce density for 24/7 monitoring of every system.

how many medium and small sized guys can quickly form to stop a 50-100 man fleet roaming through their area?  they struggle with caps in the best of circumstances.
---
Clearly there’s a vested interest for the CSM to remain in its current form for goonswarm.

So you killed his alt and then he killed you...  And you're crying about him killing you.

The hypocrisy is strong here.

As others have said, going through wormholes is a great option.  Even better if your corp uses a wormhole mapper so you can see how to get out there the most efficient way if a corpmate has already scanned the route.  Where ever I am in high sec, I know I can be out in null in a few jumps and a few splashes since my corp maps so many wormhole chains.
---
Also, you can have a pod dedicated to sitting in an NPC station in null, and you just jump clone when you want to get to HS.  Using this method, you will sell your loot in Null to a loot buyback program who will take like 10% of the value (but you don't have to risk getting killed an route back to high sec). 
---
Wormhole drifters can be lured i thought, people use citadels to kill them no ?
---
Not really since you can’t rejoin a wardecced Corp for 7 days so it’s one off at best.
---
Yes, they anchor them on grid with the planetary warpin and just wait for the drifter to show up
---
I think it's fascinating to see the annual ebb and flow in player activity in the game.
---
Is there a way to select all regions at once?
---
As others have said, wormholes are your best bet to get to-and-from highsec in order to put your earnings into the market. Whether through a direct null-high connection or through a J-space system, that kind of shortcut shaves a crapload of time off your transit and is much safer than running through a number of gatecamps on your way to Empire space.
---
Trying to route through Thera is not something I'd recommend on your first try. It's a well-trafficked system, and more than one first-timer has met a quick end to their journey, their ship, their cargo, and their pod. 
---
So before you head out to null, I'd suggest getting used to how wormholes work and how to survive in them.

New destination alliance for PVP weebs?

I was discussing this earlier with a few friends, really you would have to flip the current meta. The route I would take is to nerf the respawn times of the belts to 2 spawns a day for each individual belt. Doing this would force Rorq miners to spread out creating openings for small to medium gangs to get kills before getting hit with the super blob. It would also lower the availability of materials to produce supers thus raising the price back up. 
---
Its hype hes probably already got another one
---
Looks fun! BR would be nice though
---
Now the hulk pilots are gonna whine until they buff their tanks again....
---
Even if it didn't require manual pickup, this would be a positive change. Alliance gets no tax from system without an ESS or reinforced ESS. 
---
Well that’s a shame you’re leaving fully. Your blog was fantastic (and the drama). Even in the age of eve blogs (which is well and truly over) yours was the most insightful into CCP and CSM by a mile. How do you feel about the current or last CSM team? Any names you’d say are good bad? How about some reforms  for CSM election you’d suggest?
---
just petition it, CCP is known for replacing stupidity/pvp losses.
---
Mynnas fall from grace and unticketing was great to watch. He was even worse then inominate. 
---
I wasn't in the alliance when it happened, couldn't tell you. Maybe they thought they'd be too small of a target for sniff to care about. It sat out there for a very long time before snuff ever hit it, a few months of that while the entire alliance was in bleak lands instead, would have been a perfect time to ref it, but snuff left it alone for some reason until recently. 
---
He’s the best imperium/goon etc candidate in 5 years. Take that as you will. 
---
Looks exactly like the ones they released by accident a year or two ago...
---
Que padre. Man, quiero viajar por ayi pero mi pinche gobierno no vale verga. :'(
---
You keep saying from the top of my head/from memory etc. You’ve had enough time now to pull evidence and you can still only name 1 or 2 leakers. 
---
?
---
Awesome dude, welcome! DM if you want some corp recommendations
---
wow
---
wow wtf, lmao
---
\&gt; Every CSM in my memory had at least one member kicked for leaking or some other shady shit. 
---
You are either wrong or that girl from 50 first dates.
---
Thank you
---
You could go off my forum posts. You could go off my podcast appearances. You could go off my discord discussions. You could actually, you know, talk to me or talk to anybody who actually knows me. 
---
And loss value isn't equal, it actually favors the drones heavily.
---
You need to look into the backstory of that fort before you talk about it then. That fort has been RFed multiple times. Because of citadel mechanics it's deep UStz, which Snuff didnt have. It's been RFed several times before but BRM had Calmil/BL/PH/Tri help defending it. Snuff just built up their UStz recently, so they are clearing out structures they couldn't clear out before.
---
No that's American food with Chinese spice.
---
I miss having a roadmap. We know so little about what to expect in next 18 months. 
---
Wat? 
---
spelt garmur wrong
---
Nope. One of the ESI versions screwed up Snapcount and I've stopped bothering with updating it.
---
This is the last graph it produced:  http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-2018.png
---
Sometimes they'll claim they have the backing of the CSM without the CSM even being involved.
---
If I'm actually playing I have 30 or more logged in, most of my friends have 20+ too when theyre online
---
Where is this data from then? and how old is it
---
Por favor no se unan a ninguna corp vieja de hispanos, son por lo gral, todas son por lo menos mediocres sino peor. Hagan algo por ustedes mismos los cubanos, seguro terminan siendo mejores pilotos, mas unidos y con menos drama.
---
While we're at it make it possible to have the interface in one language and AURA in another, without having to play around with the resource folders.
---
Yeah this is a good post, but even if it was just a focus group its a focus group of the n+1 style of play. Along with the fact that a good chunk of them are utterly retarded makes it so much more than just a PR/definition problem.
---
They need to have 1 vote per actual player, and they need to have a limit on how many coalition members can be part of the CSM, along with maybe having a guaranteed rep. for each type of space (null/low/WH)
---
Quant gave a whole presentation that went with this graph (he presented it at Fanfest, IIRC). Again IIRC, he said they looked over both IP data on where accounts were being used as well as accounts linked via e-mail addresses and/or credit cards. But yeah, it wasn't precise and the graph itself says it's an estimate.
---
I believe the numbers because I know for a fact that there's a huge silent majority of EVE players that play the game casually, most of them in high-sec, most of them for a few hours a week in high-sec, just running missions or mining while they watch a movie. They don't have any interest in the larger meta-game, they don't care about in-game politics, and they rarely encounter any of the stuff that everyone here goes nuts about. A lot of them are completely unaware of EVE social media.
---
One of the more interesting conversations about EVE I ever had was  at my first Fanfest. I showed up early to do some tourist stuff including a long bus tour around Iceland. I ended up sitting next to another EVE player, also early for Fanfest, a "life-long" L4 mission runner. He and I chatted about EVE for hours between stops (I knew a lot about L4 mission-running because I ran a high-sec feeder corp for the old Gentlemen's Club in which I ran a weekly L4 mission group to help the new players earn ISK). It was really illuminating to get this guy's take on EVE, and how little he knew or cared about the drama outside the very few systems he traveled between.
---
Getting on the CSM, I was able to have conversations with EyjoG and others with direct access to the data and it just confirmed this huge silent majority is out there and they really don't give a shit about any of us. ;-)
---
With re: the player count data, Snapcount broke on me back in September and I haven't bothered to fix it.
---
Couldn't they just always spawn the PvP gate and then have a waiting period where you just sit in the site waiting for somebody else to queue up? If nobody matches within 2 minutes you get automatically kicked out back to k space.
---
&gt; CSM8 had no leakers.
---
Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahhaha dude you're so fucking wrong.
---
which is why it's so damn addictive... anyone that wants to play fair can go play minecraft or something.
---
My man, it was a joke reply to this joke of a thread.
---
Haha
---
With re: CSM election reforms, see my other post in this thread, but short version, I think CCP should handle it like AT commentators: have people put together portfolios of their style of EVE play, where those portfolios prove they know about that particular style of play, submit them, and then CCP picks the ten or twelve people they want for a year based on those.
---
And I haven't paid much attention to the last two CSMs, and didn't vote in the last two elections. Back in October, I had a problem that I knew a CSM member could help me with and I reached out to Brisc Rubal because he hangs out here and he was gracious enough to help me out.
---
Tell me falcon do you ever get tired of PARADING AROUND LIKE NOTHING IS WRONG !!??
---
I wish i could parade around but after the pineapple incident i'm not allowed to :(
---
The delayed local would work just as well, and is functionally the same as having no local for the purposes of hunting.
---
As much as I would like to see that change it does go against CSMs secondary function of a marketing piece based around an elected group of player reps to devs. Something that can be sold by news sites easily. 
---
You're the same guy that says CCP never changes their upcoming patches based on player input so you'll forgive me if I think your vision of reality is quite skewed.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/64815399/
---
They already do that, but it’s 5 minutes 
---
IMO, HiSec should be 1.0-0.8, instant CONCORD response. Everything else is LowSec/Null.
---
Why? So that the noobs don't have to PvP unless they want to (via duels and joining WarDec-able corps), and everyone else can shoot back if they're attacked.
---
a fookin h8 the csm am playin 4 5 yrs an they ain dun sheit
---
No spy alt in tapi 😕
---
ahh ty
---
If the structure was under the same corp/alliance they wouldn't be untouchable.
---
Presented in *sloth-vision*
---
Most of the marketing value is centered around "hey, this game company brings players to Iceland to get their take on upcoming game changes" rather than the election itself. So that aspect of the CSM would remain intact.
---
The part of the CSM's mandate that would be broken is the intent that the CSM be watchdogs to prevent CCP abuse of their position. The lack of CCP control was supposed to produce that kind of check. But that mandate has been broken for quite a while, I think, so the loss of it would be minimal.

I was on the recieving end of leaks specifically from CSM8 and the next few that followed it.  I'll be happy to name a few of the things and mention a few of the things that never made it to public light to you in private if needbe.  But lets go ahead and make one thing easily verifable: Ishtars and r64 goo(including thulium, which until then had been the most useless of all moon materials except perhaps evaporites) disappeared from the market completely a few weeks before the tech nerf/moon redistro/t2 materials change was announced that precipitated the fountain war and the ishtar buff that made the the ship du jour for 18 months was announced.
---
Yes you can with a fast ship and good hacking skills.   I almost always get 2 then leave as the rats are showing up.   Going for 3 is suicide
---
Holy fuck you dinos are actual retards, huh?
---
nah
---
ccp is a dogshit company
---
They aren't bots, they are just asic miners.
---
I doubt that. If you really want to get detailed you can look at indy alts and trade alts... those logged in and sitting in a station... those afk. I would say at any given time with 30,000 logged in you really only have 10,000 real humans. It's definitely up for debate, but I would assure you its far less than you think. 
---
Thanks. Don't know why the downvotes. We're entitled to see them how we want and they are clearly scrubs. 
---
"in the site" duh
---
Hooo boy. If you're salty about getting baited into a 1v1 heaven forbid someone drops caps on you. 
---
So you expect anyone to just ask your fit before any engagement to see if its fair?
---
kek
---
I expect anything and everything, but that doesn't mean I don't reserve the right to call them shameless and pathetic. 
---
well people have different opinions, and that makes people unhappy. but amid the downvotes, just wanted ya to know you arent the only one that thinks some tactics in this game are fucking ridiculous
---
Finally, a face I can put to your comments and posts! I appreciate this all too much, fuckin' hell.
---
~~could you finish making the bed too, please~~
---
This is accurate as far as it goes. I'd add two things:
---
Not all devs engage with the CSM. Some have no interest in the process, some have active contempt for the CSM, some see the entire CSM as leakers and don't want to show them anything of substance. Sometimes, this view holds and as a result, there are often whole feature sets that nobody from the CSM sees or knows about until they're announced or released.
---
At the two summits I attended, it was striking to see the devs/teams that wanted to be there versus the ones that did not and were only there because they were told to be.
---
Second and related, the CSM is really only as effective as CCP management and their coordinator allow them to be. If a given CSM has a weak coordinator and weak management support, they won't be shown as much as will a CSM with a stronger coordinator and better management support. A weak coordinator has another effect: it will make it difficult/impossible for the CSM to get the word out both among the devs and the player base. I don't want to name names or anything, but one of CSM8's coordinators and his lack of strength within the company delayed publishing of one of our Summit minutes by weeks...
---
Imagine reading again what I said and not caring about my ship, but about the stupid tactics used.  Just as you can have your opinion, so can I. 
---
Were you in the CSM?
---
close but no
---
Maybe if CCP listened to their good ideas, and told them to get fucked on their partisan ideas it could work. 
---
His warp jammer... do you even play?
---
In a novice site? Are you an idiot?
---
It's on the internet so it must be true.
---
Go fit your neuts in that shitty Tristan... LOL
---
Disgusted at the tactic and laughing at how low they sink. Guess you're not too smart. 
---
Laughing at the extent it was done for a t1 frig. And clearly pointing out that fun doesn't need to equal a win. Best work on those reading skills. 
---
Now that would be hilarious to do that for a t1 frig kill. Heaven forbid you even read my post. Hoo pal
---
Wtf really?? 
---
Yes. Because that's exactly what I said. Are you tone deaf in a reading sense of the term?
---
Which director?
---
Newbies might thisk that's a festival, too few content recently
---
Finally someone that understands what I'm trying to say. 
---
You actually don't even have to dock up, you just can't be in a ship. I've done it when I had to swap corps in NS and didn't have a friendly station to dock up in, so I just ejected and switched corps. I had almost every non-isk asset in that ship at the time. Sweatiest 10 seconds of my life.
---
what ratio would you say are devs that like the CSM compared to dislike?
---
Four or five likes to one dislike. Maybe a little higher.
---
That's why the difference was so striking.
---
Goons should have just allied themselves in the war against Pirat’s alt Corp and they would have been good. 
---
... 'except it's not in geminate, and goons gave them a slight helping hand
---

Nice AAR.
---
Looks like Goons are taking the kiddo's out for a evening stroll.
---
Classic tapi cant get anything done without papa goons holding their hand. Wonder how much 'legacy' tax ends up in 1dq
---
For real?
---
People form for entosis timers in kavela expanse. Fight happens. Our logi wing starts breaking, dictors manage to keep the fleet bubbled while we try to run to the fort on grid. Without a logi wing, this means we are bleeding T3C's and ishtars. 
---
Because that is totally all hordes work and not the PL/NC super fleet? You realize if Test  and Imperium would deploy down here for real this "war" would instantly be over. But who wants that? Too many blobs in one area ruin this game , we had some gudfites when it was only SV vs horde but that shit is over now too 
---
They got spud on the dino brain.
---
"Test"
---
Important to note that a lot of northern ships didn't make it onto the BR because they didn't kill anything. 
---
I can't say a jackdaw fleet and some harpies is handholding.

&gt;is by far and away takes the cake.

Signal cartels website maps the Thera connections. Go there and use the Thera wormhole to get from highsec to null and back with limited jumps. Also has links to dotlan for each system to give you an idea of how busy it is there. Thera is the most connected wormhole in the game with statics to high, low, null and other wormholes.

Test: we not Goon Pets
---
Also Test: we need Goons to help us do anything
---
give it up Test, just apply for the Goon application and get it done with.
---
Yes, the Goons were the bad guys in that situation, CLEARLY.
---
It's handholding not carrying.
---
Local chat eve wide went bonkers. It was great. Wormhole style. 
---
Hello guys. Here we see the strong and independent alliance TEST starting their deployment to Geminate / Kalevala. It seems Progod's tactic worked this time. In his speech he talked about how their enemies have to coordinate with each other. Here we see this tactic in practice. One alliance versus the coordination of several.
---
The best part about this is the 450 j4gs in TEST and Goons violently stroking themselves over such a titanic victory
---
A fleet of Jackdaws and another one with Harpies. Along with a fleet with Gokus and yet another fleet of bombers.
---
Natural selection at its finest 
---
nc cerbs, pl jackdaws, bl munins,

Of course NCPL never show up for you

---
Muy bien! 
---
There PR problem is also the fact that because a great deal of the CSM are Goons. Image matters in regards to this. Even if the majority of the CSM are only interested in the game mechanics and not the politics, there will be always be bias over that, especially when some implementations only appear to benefit one particular aspect of the game. 
---
That BR is still broken though. Case in point: I'm not on it. Because logi and all that CCCpls
---
The hero we need.

Goon jackdaws goon harpies init stuukas legacy d team harpies
---
We're not down here for good fights.  And we don't care about if pgl or vily thinks we're blobbing.  They've talked so much shit about PL and how we aren't committed to our deployments and how TEST is this battle hardened group.  Well we're here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They're going to be homeless soon.
---
Correct and I never said they weren't there. Just funny to leave out ships to hide the fact that TEST / their coalition cannot do stuff without their bluetral friends.
---
NC PL are in the same coalition, noones denying that. Are test and goons in the same coalition?
---
Lot of Panfam butthurt in this thread, I'm loving it.
---
Hope you didn't like krabbing in Kalevala.
---
See, this is where you are not understanding what it is the CSM does.  They aren't there to bring ideas.  They are there for ideas to be shown to them.  That is what a focus group does, they give feedback on ideas presented, similar to test screenings for movies that then have the endings reshot.
---
[I wonder what the answer to that question is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rQQgGUP_Uw)
---
Whining about null blocs fighting together still in 2019. What a lad. 
---
Yeah, both sides are butthurt at times. Such is EvE, y'know?
---
Also, I hated krabbing in Kalevala. Screw those anoms, could never figure out a vni fit to fully afk them, and carrier ratting took more work to optimize due to the way the rats spawn.
---
Not as funny as all those faction forts thou amirite
---
Well goons have also stated that they'll "Third party" in this TEST "invasion".
---
And this is not what I'm seeing in practice. Not that it's coming off as a suprise or anything, just silly that your megacoalition has to paint it like that...
---
Everyone bands together and evicts Goons, lol 🔥 GOTTEM 🔥.
---
North bands together to "evict" TEST, we're not here for the good fights!
---
Test and Goons poke Horde and friends, *reeee*. 
---
Never gets old. It has aged beautifully.
---
Welcome to New Eden! Make some friends and find a player corporation that does the activities you enjoy doing in-game. 
---
I don't control what Goons say -- hell, I don't even control what TEST says, I'm just a grunt -- but it's safe to say that whenever Panfam is involved we're in lockstep with each other.
---
Gud fite Mittens o/
---
eh, if your gonna pick a fight with someone, and then cry to goons cause you picked a fight you know u cant win.
---
lets face it, we know where all the real fighting power is in your force.  and its not you.  where are you without the imperium.  just join their coalition and get it over with 
---
The same way in which Horde always called on NC for timers when they unblued each other a few times for content?
---
Welcome to Eve in 2k19 where people band together against common enemies
---
Only 2 to 1 odds AMAZING JOB BOYS WE’RE REALLY IMPROVING 
---
NC Cerbs kind of just sat on the citadel and watched Horde die and then ran off somewhere.
---
This is pretty rich considering the shit show that was the "eviction" of Test just a very short time ago. Goldfish brains. 
---
Hey man, you guys do it when we lose fights. 
---
the harpys are legacy we had worms ty
---
I think one of the Titans jettison'd it.  
---
&gt; and then cry to goons cause you picked a fight you know u cant win. 
---
Go cry more to NC/PL/BL because someone has picked a fight with you that you know you can't win.
---
There's two sides to the coin, TEST have tried a few times to fight Horde solo to just get turboblobbed by all those entities + supers + titans, why would they not invite goons to come and join the fight? 
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about the stukas. Regular bombing wing was Test though iirc. 
---
Only TEST members go out of the way to deny Imperium-Legacy mega coalition. 
---
That was Predditors.
---
[Woop woop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwY28rpyKDE)
---
Honest to goodness, r/Eve turned me away from EVE more than EVE itself. Probably because ingame I am limited to my neck of the woods while this site airs out the cluster's worst.
---
Well I've got good news for you!
---
I can't give much, so please take my upvote!
---
At least when Goons are on field Test will fight. This will  be the more akin to the Goon offensive before long. .. if not already.  See ya on the battlefield gents. 
---
How have I never seen this before?
---
A+ on the production values.  
---
Sir they are worms not harpies 
---
You don't even have to leave grid (unless this has changed)... Align, aggro guns, ping, warp back and shoot again.
---
That actually makes me realize that EVE's actually a fairly small MMO when compared to most. Heck, using non-MMOs for comparison, even Payday 2 (whose story ended last year) has a larger concurrent number of true players than EVE.
---
sorry stuukas in tidi are great for playing dota while in fleet
---
We have never denied we are not in the same coalition, when it comes to shooting NC and Panfam our goals are the same.  When we got nothing to do they hunt in delve we hunt in catch etc., just look at the kb's.  
---
u/Naz-al-Ghul did that to announce the Goon participation in the last war (Great War?  Whatever name we're using for it).
---
Fc is credit recruiting? I want to join war!
---
It's just like Iceland in that it's importance for outweighs it's population size
---
so if you dont call nc or pl I am betting TEST wont call us, but I am 100% sure that isnt happening so we will just continue to show up.
---
I honestly don't think a planet would explode unless significant explosives were used. The metals and rocks in the core and crust, I'd imagine it'd be more like puncturing a gravy filled baloon in zero G depending on the size of the projectile.. It may even just cause a catastrophic collapse of the crust.
---
I was watching a show about the 90s about how that response to the drug problem was extremely weak and bizarre
---
Just joking 
---
At least tethering is a step up from docking.
---
Makes sense to me, EVE does have that effect in the gaming community. Vocal Minority I guess? (same with complaints in this sub really dragging down my personal enjoyment of the thing too)
---
Also based on the grammar and typo, apologies if I'm interrupting a stratop.
---
You're in the right place, and yes: Eve is hands down *the* most newbie friendly MMO out there.
---
More friendly than any other game, if you join a newb friendly Corp most will run training fleets on how to play the game
---
It's one of the best kept secrets in r/eve history, but I'll fill you in: http://www.isdredditrecruiting.com/

Imperial Legacy

Well, they showed up in Cerbs and tethered up to watch Horde get murderzoned.

It taste so good
---
\&gt; the point of them is to make CCP money
---
    Where do I start? Is there character classes? Is there groups I can join ? Any tips for starting off?
---
Where do I start? 
---
Checkout Pandemic Horde, Eve University, Brave Newbies,  KarmaFleet and more. But try doing tutorial missions aka starter missions first to get a hang of things.
---
Is there character classes?
---
Nope but there are different ships each excels at different tasks for you to choose from. You're not obligated or locked in to doing anything.
---
Any tips for starting off?
---
Google, eve university wiki are your friends. Also, don't fly what you can't afford to lose!
---
I always recommend new players join Eve University. They'll teach you how to play. 
---
You realize they are in the same COALITION. LEGACY and IMPERIUM are DIFFERENT COALITIONS...
---
Right you are!!! Both sides blob, there's no morale high ground here, you win some you lose some, you blob all any chance you get cause winning is winning is winning. Have muh updoot!!!
---
can you add a tl;dr
---
You realize that NC and PL are in the same COALITION as Horde right? LEGACY and IMPERIUM are different COALITIONS...
---
So us and Goons like helping each other kill Panfam.
---
So fucking what?
---
:)
---
The CSM are the Emergency Hull Energizer to CCP's game changes. By the time it's used, the outcome is already certain. The mod gets burned out after use and the ship gets destroyed (on reddit) anyway...  
---
Why would Imperium not take this opportunity to continue throwing punches at their forever enemy?  
---
It's early yet.  Third-partying remains on the table but when we have as many options and targets that are red to us why wouldn't we opt for those?  
---
Form better next time and you won't be relegated to complaining about megacoalitions on Reddit.  
---
What's the current t1 cruiser nullsec meta right now?  Is it still rlml caracals? 
---
call it whatever you want, you are the north and we are Imperial Legacy.  Both are made up of multiple alliances, coalitions are an out of game creation as CCP doesnt actually support that functionality.  We are also fighting without any super or titan support which you guys have free rein to use.
---
gf! we lost this one, hoping for more fites!
---
PGL is gonna cancel taking SOV because Goons don't want to assist and then say he is watching football?
---
The game will  be dead before any long term investments pay off
---
only option for a new player is to set up a AFK VNI to farm isk for skill injectors, note the AFK, so the most efficient choice of playing the game is not to play it. People will tell you this is fun, newbie friendly engaging and rewarding gameplay but they just want to collect taxes from you and for you to be another drone in a fleet.
---
Or you could work and buy plex then buy injectors, which also means the fastest way to catch up is too not play eve, hope you get the idea lmao its a dead game on development life support with new bugs (never to be fixed) being introduced each patch. It will never be 2012 again.

shit they got our playbook everybody panic

I like the fact that someone sat down and put in the effort to make that website, and is paying to host it.

What do you mean Third Party? We've already been fighting Pandemic Horde since the Casino war. This has never ended, the war just continues. We've never not undeployed as far as our elite groups go and have been killing Pandemic Horde most nights. There was a potential truce late last year because Sort Dragon, negotiated one for you but you threw it in his face, which put you right back on the hit list. You should of taken his offer...now you will pay.
---
Yeah heavy breathing guy with a lisp and girlfriend stories.

Don't mind you ihubs. They may have all gone missing tonight.

Goons have killed more TEST Titans than PL did lmao

Then make short term investments?  Or, you know, play it for fun?

Looks more like a goon and init with there TEST pets.

did you not see the thread about my rorqual yesterday?
---
If only ihubs gave kills
---
It's sort of similar to GOTG and PanFam back when you were all bum chums. :) Different coalitions, same enemies.
---
Long term investment?
---
How about just start playing for free and having fun for however long his interest \*or\* the game holds out?
---
You know they will move supers and up there if things kick off.  Why wouldnt they?

Shady tactics from shady people. This is Eve, it happens daily. Pretty normal even though I agree with you. 
---
Shoutout to Tross Yvormes for taking over from Tony Rocca, the previous host.
---
You know it baby! 
---
Any videos of the fight?
---
 It's sort of similar to GOTG and PanFam back when you were all bum chums. :) Different coalitions, same enemies. 
---
You only joke because you know it's basically true. Legacy Coalition can't do anything with Goons. 
---
just put an alt for warpin on every wh in your chain... EZ
---
Why wouldn't it surprise me if CCP actually got bought out by a dev who's leading in the business field of user generated penises?
---
55 Alliances fight Goons during the Casino war, no one complains. Two alliances fight PanFam during this war, Reddit erupts with whining...

2010 was a good year to be in WH, don't think any exist since most of them have been evicted.

whoa guys im gettin called out here, goons come help me downvote this dude or im gonna have to bail

Hey man, I feel like you need a hug.

i'd be angry if my alliance was calling max dudes cta to defend horde sov as well

seems to be more alts than new blood.

We were in battleships, it was smart bomb the pod or let it get away. The latter is haram.

If you want that type of gameplay, go to wormhole space maybe?

we don't have to be in the same coalition to be friendly with each other and poop on northern crybabies.

They were in the same coalition and have had good diplo relations since before your coalition existed

can confirm cerbs were spotted and did not participate.

I hear that horde will be moving to WH and living out of mobile depots soon. try them

Are you retarded?
---
no

Oh please god yes.  I'm almost done training my titan pilot.

---
third party doesn't mean we shoot test it just means we show up and do want we want.
---
Dreddit is in fact recruiting. 
---
Errrrrrrr I thought that it was pretty obvious that the CSM are just a big focus group and not Junior Developers.
---
and by bleeding you mean they got fucking slaughtered.
---
I'd be angry if my FCs needed a major Goon sig and an INIT fleet in order to make sure my invasion-but-not-really-invasion-its-just-a-deathclone-deployment got off the ground.
---
What two alliances are fighting Panfam?
---
We worked well enough together that we just kinda kept it going.
---
The Horde salt in this thread is delicious.
---
Pleblente - the hero dictor we needed, but didn't deserve.

You mean the slaughter?

I mean, things kinda already did kick off with that previous dread welp.

Most timers are 99% irrelevant to line members regardless of any other factor.
---
It matters greatly to the alliance/Corp, on the other hand.
---
TEST is basically a Reddit corp. If you are seeing anti-TEST shit on Reddit it's usually because there is enough validity to it to survive the downvotes.

Plebente is always doing something useful.  Wonder how many corp medals he has.
---
Just join a small alliance. Unspoken alliance, Nullsechnaya Sholupen, Rote Kapelle to make a few I would recommend.
---
But, probably should go to r/eve_jobs and see what’s over there
---
FC panic is burnt out, wat do
---
I’m not angry at all.
---
However i have worked with solutions that were as old and long lived as Eve.
---
Sometimes it’s not as easy as you make it out to be.
---
Just because it’s easy in a clean and new POC.
---
Neither of us have seen the code for inventory management in Eve, hence you don’t have any clue :)
---
As the second to last guardian to drop I had fun
---
Thanks for the content!
---
You say that like it means anything.  In the north we have decided collectively that while we like shooting each other, we fucking a number one love shooting your asses.  So thats what we do.  If you dont like the fact that we talk to each other, well, too damn bad, blame doomchinchilla for causing us to set up coordination channels as a result of your failed eviction attempt last year. 
---
This is followed by a guy with a furry model in a diaper calling you up while you're ratting and "owo"ing you. Then you delete the fucking hellspawn of a game EVE has become in this dark timeline and strongly consider getting back into alcoholism.
---
Done!
---
which kind of cloud?
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/227/stats/
---
So are we.  Ignore all the flaming and baiting in this thread and keep fleeting up, PVP is fun.
---
Are people still using alliance count unironically when modern alliances are often larger than old school coalitions?
---
imperial legacy, so it realy takes two coalitions to go up north, shit iam smug as fuck
---
Oh yes those 2 small upstart alliances called Goons and Test. And they totally do not have their coalitions there also. Totally. Lmao dude.
---
What am I doing wrong? I'm using Firefox and all I can see are the new player graphs on this site, the online player count graph is missing.
---
If you are NCPLHORDE, then yes, goons and legacy are very much allied against you. If you don't belong to NCPLHORDE, then goons and legacy aren't allies.   
---
The mutual dislike between north and south is just that, mutual. 
---
If I'm not being flair baited didn't BL........ pull out pretty early in this fight?
---
I was like 15 when I first played EVE so they're out there, just not common.
---
This is like the 4th time you've posted this, and each time it still didn't matter...

Noobs in WH? That's surprising.

Problem is if we do not back up horde I am fairly sure it just changes who blobs who.
---
Toomany dumb panfam pets think goons really are our masters/whatever bullshit narrative they want to throw
---
If you can't handle us stop playing and log off hordlings the north is ours 
---
You mean the one where goonies actually advance a war for you?  In that case then yea we got it though is the PGL fort fumble an audible or read option?
---
I frequently see them in t1 explore ships, killing them is like clubbing baby seals tbh, but I always srp them.

I like to dual web my rail thorax , no point but it’s like a poor mans vigi and great for killing tackle coming in

fun fact, jack was my alliance secret Santa and gifted me quite a few small gang ships. he's always welcome to come roam :) 
---
Get gud.
---
Look around /r/evejobs and see if there's a C5 corp that wants to take you into Bob's Back Yard. Most high-class corps require an attention to PvP, so be aware of that going in.
---
r/eve has over 100,000 subs
---
does tapi have that many members?
---
there should be literally nothing communicated to the CSM that isn't public. 
---
Youre wrong.
---
quit until they remove local
---
Awesome! Hey, I'll fight you nerds any day....just gotta get past Harvey's lads camping NBPH.
---
Seriously though, bring him on. I'm sure he'll have a blast.
---
Id resub if this happened.
---
The community is very newbro friendly. Specific groups like EVE Uni are even more friendly, as they exist in order to give newbros a solid foundation in the game before letting them loose on an uncaring and cruel universe. Once you're out there in said uncaring and cruel universe, however, others might not be so inclined.
---
As for the mechanics themselves, it's a horrible and complicated world if you try to learn everything right off the bat. The best starting place is to run all of the tutorial missions, all five career agents, and the initial Sisters Of Eve mission arc in order to get a thorough grounding in the game. From there, it's pretty much catch-as-catch can for what you want to do, and that's the point where you should start looking for a corp to run with. In the meantime, pay attention to the newbro chat and your starter corp chat in order to pick up a few nuggets of wisdom. 
---
More like botsbase growing 
---
So basically it's like when TEST says they aren't Goon pets. You've posted it a million times, but each time it doesn't matter. 
---
The CSM is a joke, full of corrupt cunts tbh.
---
+1 good stuff
---
The last paragraph is a decent tl;dr.
---
So instead of you trying to take PL space you guys attack Horde... And you can't even win fights in space that we ACTUALLY occupy...

Good post m'lord, upboated u :)
---
Yes and no.  The user interface and new player experience baked into the game's code are super complicated and it'll take you a little while to get the hang of things.  Eve is probably the single most complicated game you'll ever find, and trying to figure out how shit works takes a loooong time.  Just stick with it.
---
On the flip side, as some of the other posters have mentioned, the community is exceptionally welcoming and helpful to new players.  Yeah, there are some jerks who grief new players, but overall this is the one topic we can put aside our differences on.  The game is very hard but we want you to succeed -- at least enough so that we don't feel guilty when we blow you up.
---
&gt; Hes kinda hated I think still in the eve community but thats all ill say 
---
Yeah, to be well known in Eve is to be hated.  You'll get used to it.

I wish I had jumped into Brave Newbies (or any large nullsec newbro friendly alliance) on day one. You do NOT need any particular skills to fly with them and have fun! They will provide you with more fun, knowledge, and isk opportunities than highsec as a newbro.
---
Oh look, goons and test won.  Color me surprised
---
I almost want to say the name but I dont want to be ridiculed soo soon lol 
---
Are you unironically bragging over having to change from a TAPI deployment to a TAPI+Goons deployment in order to win shit?
---
joined 4 gudfites?
---
The inital timers were all set by Goon sigs deployed in the north, not TEST. 
---
So far so good, found a newbie friendly corp, doing some missons. Really cool
---
The problem is the csm lacks the thing that makes a focus group and that is focus. For example when aryth tried to rake down the mer none of the other csms presented any contra arguments. Actually no one even asked what the threats were.
---
So it can get to a situation where one or two csms can push their own agenda and make ccp claim the csm as a whole wanted it. 
---
So, how many ihubs died?
---
People who capitalize random words are usually CRAZY.
---
Probably a wise call.  We take rivalry and trash talk to epic lengths.
---
Spod bless you all, may the light of The Mittani shine upon you all and may you be blessed by his radiance.

Should be J4Rs instead for that sweet sweet rorqual cash
---
Bud, assuming no flairbait, you're in BL.  People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
---
New player here. My tutorial with Aura, im pretty sure, missed some important details. I've read elsewhere, for example, that the tutorial should tell you that double clicking somewhere makes your ship fly to that location. The tutorial didn't teach me this however. Rather, it went straight to combat. What is contained within the tutorial, and am I right in my suspicions that the tutorial seemed to skip past things in my case?
---
Yeah! FW is a great place to develop pvp skills and most militia alliances are new player friendly. Pack your cargohold with slaves and join amarr militia for the best roleplay experience.
---
The goal post was unironicaly moved from test deploying to both them deploying lmao
---
I'd rather color you completely dead wrong.
---
what a shining example of whataboutism
---
I believe a huge number of people have registered, played trial and never touched the game again. If you count these in, your account to human ratio can be dramatically deflated.
---
We're not down here for good fights. And we don't care about if pgl or vily thinks we're blobbing. They've talked so much shit about PL and how we aren't committed to our deployments and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we're here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They're going to be homeless soon.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Okay
---
I'm guessing they mean that the weakest of us win Eve and go outside only to be killed by bears or sunstroke. This is why summer months can lead to a decline in logins. The strongest and smartest stay indoors all year long and log in.
---
Undocking... well, now that's a different story.
---
Nice BL is pets meme, good joke man, even though quite regularly BL has curtailed its blue list.
---
Rather than own it, TEST and the rest of Legacy (REQ, BRAVE, etc.) seemed committed to the idea that they are "the underdogs of Eve," with nothing to prove that idea at all. What TEST and Legacy by proxy are really good at doing is creating a professionalized victim complex after years and years of honing it down to a fine art.
---
One of the best part of having two friends who play eve in the same neighborhood  means that we can get a beer and talk for hours about ships. Good luck in quest of getting more cubans into space o7

&gt;The Mittani pbuh
---
Fixed that for you
---
sigs and squads have been in geminate area since horde was attacking gotg
---
but if they are that dangerous why limit themselves to hisec? 
---
Dunked
---
The only difference between BL and Horde is the same difference between cats and dogs.  Horde are stupid but loyal.  They're perfectly happy being PL's furchild.  BL, on the other hand, are slightly smarter but walk around like they own the place.  At the end of the day both of them would starve if PL stops filling the food bowl.
---
Please show us a recent deployment where test was succesful without goon support. 
---
Like it is just easier at this point to call anyone goon pets because without goons. All those alliances falter. 
---
Little known fact: "Las Tunas" means "the tunas"

I'm sure bait, but no one complains? Goons haven't stopped complaining 
---
MOM FAST GET THE CAM the RMT super protected bot haven coalition I am part of is superblobbing with their asperger plebbit pet coalition and I posted about it on reddit, mom please look
---
BL has more blues now than they've had in the past 4 years combined, you stopped being a merc alliance and just joined the ncpl side fulltime
---
Lol "deploying" 
---
So the two largest coalitions are blue on everything important and that's probably bad for the game long term
---
I'm sure if panfam fell apart, the game would improve. Test, goons, frat. That's all the game needs in it 
---
We don't complain really, we just invade and twist the knife. :P
---
&gt;The only difference between Goons and Legacy is the same difference between cats and dogs. Legacy is stupid but loyal. They're perfectly happy being Goon's eastern shield. Goons, on the other hand, are slightly smarter and can survive easily without Legacy and TEST. At the end of the day, Legacy and Test would starve if Goons and their allies stopped coming to help them.
---
That's not for me to decide.
---
Lmao sorry I forgot having a heavy hunk of main goons+Sig's isn't a deployment keep spinning sweaty 💅
---
When did goons stop complaining about world war bee? 
---
If you reship before km is generated, it shows new ship with old weapons
---
As a mercenary poster, you're gonna have to pay me to continue reading anything you type.

Found the dickbutt

What's the difference between a Plane and a bunch of Pandemic Legion sympathizers? The whining stops when the plane's engine turns off.

We never complained about World War Bee. Because it was never called that. :P

Thats literally the only thing in EVE that pisses me off.

Dont welp it to the low sec nerds

no salt! just hilarious that test are bragging a 25 billion loss,  especially since the amount dunking they’ve been taking the last few weeks on their own, and the only way they could get any sort of win was to max beg goons to bail them out. Gj though a win is a win
---
Original.
---
&gt;please stop killing us for the health of the game
---
rofl you fucking coward
---
what an arbitrary point to make
---
Yes well the worst abuse of power in the game hasn't been from CSMs but from the devs themselves. Not only that they did almost everything they could to cover it up and in the end almost certainly lied about it. So their concerns can go fuck themselves :P
---
they promised that actually, the old ones used to, but the node warfare made it kinda crap because it vanishes now with out taking actual damage 
---
Bravenewbies started in 2013 and was the beginning of thousands and thousands of people trying out the game from big battles like asakai and b-r making the front page of reddit. If we want more people trying out the game, we need more of those big battles to keep driving newbies. 
---
Hello Serenity, botbase has been spurred to new heights, yet.. as  Local dies?
---
Capitalized words are for EMPHASIS... Can't italicize on phone.

So it take tapi goons +eatra to fight a nebee corp lol.
---
Easy money if you're willing to die in cheap ships. Back in the day I used to mine in ec-p8r for crokite and I probably got killed like 30-40 times a week :P Paid more than mining in empire did though. 
---
Your reading comprehension skills are trained to zero aren't they?
---
Advice: Alpha caps at 5mill skillpoints, then you need omega or to use Daily Alpha Injectors (50mill a pop or buy from steam/ccp store), so choose your skills wisely.
---
...or just enjoy and stumble in like we all did; So shoot me, the game should be fun. 
---
That being said, getting to 4.9 mill and realizing you trained shield tank when you need the armor tank resists...
---
I must have these.

Shut up and take my upvote lmao

um excuse me that was a discord message not a reddit comment

i would like the north to die so the gam can die so all of you can move on .
---
&gt;Dinobraining this hard
---
I'm not in panfam. Or nullsec in general. 
---
Teddybears in dead terrorists Is recruiting, are at UKTZ though not sure what time zone you are?
---
Yeah because you always have 3 friends willing to hack nearby
---
Good luck on effectively multiboxing hacking minigame.
---
this is merely sage advice and free at that.  stop complaining.
---
Any noob that go's to null is fodder for B.S
---
No I’m US. 
---
He was talking about
---
&gt; hack them all at the same time
---
which is impossible to do on a single ship.
---
given how few people bother to participate in the voting even if you tried to limit votes to 1 per person blocks would still win by a landslide as they are the most motivated to participate. And how exactly would you limit the votes? Some accounts are plexed indefinitely so there is no credit card for you to track, emails are disposable these days, and many people have the same name as other people.
---
You seem to have trouble counting, like what do you want me to responde with when there is a battle report for the fight ( that is likely to omit some bombers on yourside because you likely where not at the last wave ). 
---
like this is the second time your contradicting numbers i can see for myself in a reddit comment, like what do you expect the response to be serieusly dude WTF? 
---
Git gud
---
&gt; then that's proof that Horde doesn't usually get SRP on their fleets. If TEST does the same thing, why don't people say the same thing about them?
---
No idea, I've never said or implied anything like that.
---
Responding to you and the same tired arguments trotted out by Legacy mouthpieces deserves as much originality as you're getting if not less.
---
SF just being SF. They got themselves dunked by Russians the other week too 
---
So the CSM ae a corrupt puppet government with no real power while a shadow government (CCP) do the real business.
---
That sounds like CCPs way to bring the real world into the game
---
i think i see it too, its near the center right? 
---
Okay!
---
dam them clouds kill
---
our lord and savior returns
---
we're totally a newbie corp, trust us

---
said an ncpl pet
---
I mean the counter and it's not total unfair is that somebody will be looking like the asshole like somebody will have to make that call. 
---
Now I do think the CSM in its ring the alarm bell role is current absolutely broken. 
---
But giving a dev final authority on if wing span can run a wormhole candidate is unlikely to work ( are play styles are often more grey then black and white ). 
---
Ok
---
Why.. that looks like a invasion from the south. Coulden't have done it without your 'allies' eh..
---
The problem is it creates a circle they don't vote so they don't get representation their space get worse so people leave their space they have fewer people to vote so don't get representation until you get a CSM with only nullsec folks on it. 
---
ustz is the new autz
---
Tbh you quite enjoy in playing what this "dogshit" company offers. 
---
sounds like the issue starts with lazy people who can't be bothered to participate. As they say in the real world, if you can't be bothered to vote you don't get to bitch about how the election didn't go your way.
---
Great choice, I left a large alliance partially from burn out and moving to wormholes was a fantastic change of pace. As others have said the PraiseBob discord wouldn't be a terrible place to start.
---
No you’re a simple farmer
---
Feel free to keep your simple thoughts to yourself you nonce 
---
PH for quite some time is nowhere near a newbie corp/alliance. Sure, they take in new players a lot, but they have loads of veteran and experienced players with rorquals, caps, supers and titans.
---

Well grid cynojamming can be problematic - as grid grow and shrink ... it can be abused quite easily.              
---
You can easily make few separate grids and merge. If you use DT for the merging process - you can get really huuuuuge grids.
---
Oh btw how’s that jumpbridge network workin out for u
---
It’s true.  Sometimes I kill them, sometimes I help

them out.  Either way I usually throw them ISK and congrats to them for having some balls.

Concerning your third question, it’s what the Proving Grounds are about : two men enter, only one leave. So better kill that pod, as Local is disrupted and the timer is still clicking down. Plus a lot of people bling the hell out of their pod to run higher tiers efficiently.
---
cringe
---
This is just a hull blaster hecate, move along. 
---
This is kind of true - in many places mining (in npc areas moon mining) lead to big groups killing smaller to keep rorqual safe. 
---
My flair is my corp, yup. Very astute. 
---
Oï ! Basically, there is two things : you either keep what you mine for yourself, for reprocessing and use of the minerals in Manufacturing or selling it, or you are in a large enough alliance that can field a buyback program, which will gladly buy everything you mine to support the war effort, generally the ore alone under compressed form, because it’s way easier to carry around the characters with perfect refining skills.
---
Concerning the Rorquals, I don’t remember any corporations or alliances asking their miners to pay the boosters, as they generally mine too. However, nothing is stopping you from giving them a tip.
---
Nano Vaga's and Ishtars ... a small gangs dream back in the day :)
---
Which is a damn fucking shame, because instead of someone with both a wide and deep understanding of the game, we got more Goon mouthbreathers like Judge/Brisc, who got voted in purely to spite other players/for beeing in a Goon alliance.
---
never not shoot panfam.
---
&gt;&gt;This can actually make it more difficult to hold/profit from large amounts of space, but not really effect the "little guy". As a large group will have multiple systems/regions to defend, they can't realistically cover every single system with immediate response. Whereas a smaller group is normally only occupying much smaller space, they can react much quicker.
---
Well, I was actually thinking the other way around - for larger alliances that has a lot of people online and tend to drop supers and gate camp with HICs on a kitchen sink roam, it would be easier. 
---
Good luck with this if you are a less active alliance/corp, you won't get to the 3 days ever, since smaller corps/alliances will most likely have timezone holes and not enough people to defend properly.
---
True, but both EyjoG and Quant would have been smart enough to limit their data to active accounts.
---
I KNOW look what gobbens ask tech 2 bs + lol what new player can fly that.
---
The problem is that alliance will just pull the corp or member data and get the cut from there. 
---
Drone alloys please - and minimal ISK
---
People apparently don't play in EVE without a local - EvE is a game that need players active to be alive and not die.           
---
Next idea please.

Entosis war... The most fun mechanic in the game...

When was NC.'s last deployment? how did that work out?
---
dat salt tho
---
Yet so funny 
---
ty!
---
Spoken like true eve player.           
---
gets cucked, runs like a bitch
---
Don't vote for him he is a goon.                
---
Vote for me!
---
How am I angry? Your post history shows I'm talking to a 12 year old that wasn't allowed to go to school..
---
Okay thanks
---
Clearly people were out in space when local was offline
---
What are goons even gonna do with that space? Not that delve doesnt make enough isk already
---
&gt; 2 reinforcement timers, 48 hrs apart 
---
That alone makes it pointless for any roaming gang to shoot, because even if they come back for it 2 day's later ( unlikely ), the defenders can just put there dreads on it. 
---
The running joke is nobody fights on shield so what you doing is creating a gun less astra if I wanted to set a timer I could shoot a poco. ( the only have 1 RF ). 
---
If you want small gangs to get fights over the thing the RF has to be mildly frustrating for the ratters, meaning the cycle needs to be shorter ( and the structure should be relatively cheap ). 
---
setting a fight up 2 days from now is basically pointless as a small gang because you will be massively outnumbered anyway, leading to a why shoot it scenario ( see citadels ). 
---
the again a single cruiser should not shutdown ratting for a weekend, because that's the other extreme. 
---
Our Walrus has teeth. :)

Wow I've never known nc. To do that
---
/s (duh)
---
AAR: we gave strat pap so all the krabs will come to bash things for a day. We won thanks to undocking only when in blob of double size. We much skill and we are space emperors.
---
Wasn't it test invasion? 
---
Oh wait 
---
/u/caprisunkraftfoods you are crazy with all of your common sense and facts, GTFO! 
---
Honestly this is spot on!
---
Also, yeah, while I have issues with Brisc/Merkelchen/Judge, I know them as pretty good generalists who can honestly voice the concerns of the general populace of EVE fairly well. Even TheJudge, whom I have personally known and have a strangely adverse and yet friendly relationship with (was in CO2 w/ him), **however**, I do know and trust he will represent the greater EVE community as best he can.
---
My personal issue however is when you have a general feeling amongst nullsec players that certain blocs have insider information on upcoming changes that may benefit their bloc. I cannot say for certain, NDA or no NDA, whether any particular bloc has benefitted from insider information. 
---
I mean.. test hasn’t exactly joined the ranks what you pointed out as test is only a single Corp which isn’t really “the big dogs”, like in the scheme of things provi is pretty unimportant at the moment 
---
Is this HK's application video to PL?
---
No warp jammers in Eve only warp disruptors and warp scramblers... do you even play?
---
That comment was low skilled, go play something else.
---
Mittanni told test to go to Geminate. That's why 
---
Just to let you know, Goons get SRP on gate camps and kitchen fleet roams, as long as the fleet you're doing it on is pinged. It might only get third tier SRP but you'll still get something.
---
This art is unironically worse than your post it note art. 
---
You also have a really unhealthy obsession with dickbutt. 
---
Triple posting because every time I see this image I just want to straight gouge my eyes out and stick them up my asshole. 
---
An underrated comment!
---
Can confirm, was the FC for this encounter. 
---
Before you ask, yes I’m still salty as fuck.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt;If you want real content, either go roaming and wait for people to notice you
---
That rarely results in much more then getting ignored, no serieusly go to somebodies staging system, sit there in a safe or on a gate wait for them to undock, the either undock like something you can't fight ( if you have more logi then i have ships i'm not fighting you ), or you will just be ignored until you get bored an hour later.
---
It feels like you don't do a lot of roaming by this comment, yes forcing people to undock is a thing ( that means the defender wants a good reason to take a close fight rather then play blueballs or helldunk ). 
---
Like as a defender there is literally no benefit to giving a good fight, you can get it somewhere else while the attacker will not return if the region is boring there for any defender that thinks about these options will either massively outform you or not undock at all. 
---
When it was partially working :)      
---
From my personal experience like 3-4 people from my corporation freed themself from EVE thanks to this broken local.         
---
In the same way like you fight addiction - each day less and less time in game to the point that they stopped to login and canceled the subs.        
---
no one needs to  brigade for shit like this to get downvoted you pleb.
---
...err, entirely possible. This sub can be a silly place.

Tikle disbanding as well, rumor is they are joining HTP.  PI5 and their 2 pockets are up for grabs!  
---
Till this day there is outcry on comms. I think you could participate in your alliance more 
---
I means that FRAT includes people from other countries in Asia,such as Taiwan, Singapore etc. India?If they speak Chinese.And not all Chinese are in FRAT.Just because they provide Chinese client localization tools,So many people who don't speak English join them.

Every single change that gets put forward will "hurt the little guy" in some way. Just do *something* for fucks sake this waffling has been going on for years, literally.
---
What are BL other than another n+1 alliance? Practice what you preach.. only so long you can claim to be a merc alliance when you engage in the exact same gameplay as other entities... Just find these posts so hypocritical it's a shame. Can't imagine the state of your forearm if Elo put down the bag long enough to get in.
---
fuck off weeb

We don't want sov, sigs and squads are just having a fun excursion to the north :)

I can’t wait to see this get dropped, and have the undock 1-2degrees off in any direction just for the rage that will ensue

Well you are here and ingame, constantly posting about the game.        
---
If you are not "enjoying" the game than you are a masochist playing eve ... but then you are still enjoining it, just in your own special way. 
---
Well done! We need more new blood in Eve.
---
Happy cake day.
---
the energy per vote ratios doesn't match up ( most people not in null don't get handed a ticket to input ) especially if it's like a 20/40 Real people corp. 
---
So that means basically everyone has to research the own candidates that reduce's the number of votes massively ( because most of none-null isn't that centralized in power structure ). 
---
There is also the issue of it being another mechanic that drivers well resources to the people how already have resources and away from the rest of eve, so it means the area of space in the worse state gets the worse support ( i present you FW space ), meaning once a region gets a bad patch there is no return path. 
---
Not that I know, but you'll probably upset people if you spread that rumour.
---
You should go do it lol

This x10. It would be amazing to be able to copy more than 10 marks at a time. however CCP doesn't have the skill needed to make that change without entirely breaking something along the way. So until they get some bug fixing and repair experience under thier belt we should just be great full for the few game features that still work well.

You can copy 10 at once and they move over almost instantly. To make moving them easier I use small containers. When you have hundreds to move this makes keeping track a bit easier.

Less conflict. Less content in highsec and all of the highsec content creators shifting over toward increasingly professionalized ganking. 
---
And most of all, more space for the sorts of pure scam corporations (mass recruiting of players to tax them and run bad ore buybacks, no training of players, no corp events) that were put out of business by the old system.

Well in Null you get to check if others are in local, warp to safe, cloak check their Killboards, if they have a lot of Asteros on there, mark them with -5 and take the next system.

NC Cerbs used their ADCs on bombs, giving them the choice between hiding for two minutes or dying horribly (HACs without ADCs are *very* squishy) - they chose the former and the fight was largely over by the time their ADC was available again.
---
INCORRECT

classic homophobia

Which mistake? Doing 1-2 cans in T1 frigate is viable tactic. All you risking is a spare change.

It's just marketing, its the same as companies having ethically sourced X &amp; Y product. CSM don't matter.

Then you can't know that no one complains and therefore your argument is invalid 😜
---
Not sure I agree with you, having just read the dev blog on it. Looks to me like it protects small growing corps while allowing established corps to wage ware on each other. I don't see how this assists scam corps at all.
---
Yes more structures ideal just whay tbe game was lacking. 
---
Well, they are good or maybe not so good (Idk) in their little piece of sandbox. Why should they branch out if they are happy with what they do? Same with that Santo guy who used to smartbomb 23/7 and nothing else according to his KB. I don´t get why he is doing only that (subject to discuss) but hey, if he enjoys that why not? 
---
Sure keep talking big. Until someone like villy or sappo has enough of your bullshit and we deploy with our super fleet. 
---
Smugposting about a few retards loosing g their caps and then talking like your holding back the full power of test doesn't look like a good idea. 
---
panfam could have picked an even fight and gone after goons, test may not have felt obligated to get involved since they had already gone after goons in Delve. But they decided to try and curb stomp Test for a morale boost instead.... boy did go that go well.
---
Perhaps they were told to get their asses up north rather than mucking around with you guys.
---
We don't have supers that is fake news.
---
All the other threads? You must mean the only other thread then, the one were people are making fun of PL for sitting on tether in cerbs before leaving PH to take their curb stomp like a man?
---
Now wink for me.

It all comes down to lack of effort.
---
It's a reddit-browsing, shit-posting alliance that sometimes also fleets up and plays internet spaceships. Not the the other way around.
---
It's pointless only if your leaders are telling you how and what you should call things so that they fit into their narrative. The rest of us use the actual name for the war.
---
Ah i see, now where's that brave noctis...
---
You could have 50 people with amazing game mechanic knowledge and NEVER be voted in because CCP allowed it to be so. You bring up Grrrr goons having the most to spite other people but the other powers could do the some in vote brigading (which they do btw) but they just can't get the people to vote it because of "effort". CCP could then change it to top 10 alliance gets people on CSM and the outcome of retards on the CSM will be the same. Doesn't matter if it Grrrr northen retards or grrr goon retards or grrr any other enitity retard.
---
Devs already direct talk to a few people with great game mechanic knowledge but in doing so only get a narrow point of view with some with regards to their playstyle, very few of them if any actually try to better it for the vast majority (usually only benefits a minority). 
---
All that an established corp needs to do to abuse these changes and protect itself is to pass its structures into a holding corp. 
---
The scam corps don't have structures.
---
Oh. okay
---
Arw they sold on the market as BPC?
---
Not that big an issue in highsec due to lack of ownership/open stations anyway imo. Am I missing something?
---
The actual name of the war is WWB , still you can't convince goons it's not
---
I love shit like this. Just got off waking night. Later

The Culture
---
I can't tell if you're being satirical or just stupid
---
&gt;I strongly disagree. Most games I have played through the years have had some kind of anti-cheat to detect botting/hacking.  Valve has VAC, Blizzard has Warden, some use BattleEye, etc..
---
and all of them have a fair ammount of use, but they aren't perfect in any way. Botting in WoW is still prominent, as it was for the rest of the game's history from hunter pets called Boar Ad Nauseum, to 50 People farming BoT for gold 23/7.   
---
Even Valve's VAC can not prevent all cheating from happening. Yes, you can deter them (as CCP does with banning them), but there's just no way to prevent it from happening in the first place. 
---
B B B Baltrom..
---
Great to see you guys still having good small gang fights still!  Makes me wanna play again! :)
---
L L L Laris :)
---
We've been talking about this shit for years now and nothing ever gets done. I don't care which of the dozens of possible solutions CCP goes with as long as they actually *do something*. 
---
Or if they have no intention of doing anything about the current state of nullsec they should just come out and say so. Somebody just make a decision already.
---
Solid fights, keep making them!  
---
&gt;So they will stop botting once anyone flies through gate? Sounds fine.
---
You can set your overview to account for hostiles only very easily. As soon as any neutral enters the system. Which is the same that's happening with bots today. So, even removing local will only bring a temporary improvement. Botters will adapt cause another Alpha account to scout all the regions gates is just fine.   
---
Yeah, you can still do a login trap but you can do this at the moment too. 
---
If the biggest active block gets it's members to vote and the others can't be arsed to vote then it's not the big blocks problems, it's everyone elses for being too lazy!
---
I get that it's effort to go log in your 50 toon sp farm and vote but thats just the way CCP designed it (CCP should use the link toons together and use it for voting aswell so if you vote once with your main then your 50 link accounts automatically do it to). But really, don't bitch about lazy folk not wanting to log in and do it. Bitch at ccp to make it easier for them to do it with all their accounts.
---
He held his invuln since the titan was dead anyways, but yes, loading times in this game are totally fucked up. I once jumped my super on a drop and was black screened for 2 minutes with nothing but my overview showing, fun stuff.
---
I do what I can lmao.
---
Google are the days when it won't hit 50k+
---
&gt;The fact that small gang has devolved to cloaky hunting mining drones is hilarious.
---
Should just have player-run focus groups. They were way better but also probably cost too much, its something players could do and funnel shit to ccp. 
---
should've happened a decade ago, we'd easily have 60k pcu right now
---
There is plenty of content in higsec, just wardec someone who can shoot back and is not newbie in a armor tanked caracal.           
---
Look how many azbels and sotiyos around.            
---
Yes no more farming armor plated MOA's on jita undock by people in Machariels supported by bunch of nestors. 
---
Wrecks don't get destroyed by bombs/smart bombs/bosons...
---
People shoot the wreck to get rid of warpins though. 
---
Yeah but while i lick windows i go WEEEEHOOOO WEEEEHOOO with my friends okay. NOW PUT YOUR FUCKING HANDS AGAINST THE WALL YOU PUNK!
---
The people mostly are! The game mostly is not!
---
But you can kill the structures if they don't decide to defend them. 
---
Yep.         
---
I have also opinion what can help to improve the online numbers - but  even i am afraid to give this feedback.          
---
&gt; i dunno what "ifs" is supposed to mean but the fact that hk talked the same shit about smaller wh groups that self destructed when they evicted them is enough reason to just treat them the same way. Also what do you expect with all the guys bored doing hole control... you know how things go if ppl get bored. The meta is different, exactly and thats my point. In their arrogance they claimed nobody from nullsec would be able to deal with their meta but it was the other way around.
---
If they are so arrogant why go the same way then ? I've not been in this game very long, but I've not seen the same amount of shittery from HK than I've seen from INIT in the spawn of these 2 days, and I do dig deep in the comments in threads generally. And even if HK were that way toward people they evicted, the fact that almost of WH answered to defend them shows that no, it was not that big of a deal. And the fact it would have go through without the help from Horde also says a lot about the ability to do so.
---
You may not have been the one shit talking but many in INIT have. You may not be turbo spinning the Mittani way but you still look from your side of the fence. You can't bring 1000 dudes for the initial fight, fight on fair numbers the one moment you are at the lowest and they are at the highest but still expect people to think INIT was the underdog in all of this. Most of the downvotes in this threads and the former ones are deserved, the whole "WH salt tears" are fucking ridiculous compared to the amount of bragging and self destructing caps threads that were on and all. 
---
This is all about e-reputation and bragging rights, otherwise nobody would be there to argue. But as was my first point, I don't think there is any point in trying to revive any of those arguments because it's not going to go anywhere good for INIT.
---
Dont worry. After Panfam Goons are going to dunk TAPI.
---
Rumors sayd Goons are fucked about the bad words TAPI spreads over the Imperium :3
---
Modern science delivers!
---
cool, shoot me a PM and i will give you guys a head start
---
just stop the CSM. Its useless... They jsutget free rides to iceland and informations to spread out to the alliance before anyone else know it.
---
But hey, if you wanna be a CSM just buy your votes. Its working... And then Claim you are here to help the Memberbase! :3
---
I remember a time when PL posters claimed Brave wasn't a newbie alliance because "newbie alliances don't fly tengus"
---
I'd argue that Horde isn't a newbie Corp. It's a newbie-friendly corp that uses that fact as a crutch, an excuse so they don't have to hold their hands up and just say "we lost".  It's a transparent attempt to absolve themselves of blame for their great many failings as an alliance in Eve. Chief among them being their steadfast refusal to promote self-improvement, individually or as a group, in any real capacity.
---
I like taking out this fit for solo, it is kind of balanced for everything from speed, tank and damage. Make sure you have some exile and hardshell boosters and that you heat your anc armor repper. 
---
They cost around 30 mil each and packs quite a punch for it's price.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/70858235/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/70858235/)
---
Not with that attitude...
---
Try Piracy Preferred then as  they're small wormhole Corp setting up an alliance, there mostly US I believe also.
---
There is no loot incentive to shoot a structure since POSes disappeared. Attack that Azbel if you have a grudge, sure, but everyone that wardecced for loot has now shifted to ganking instead.
---
Or they are doing the thing that actually griefs new players - gatecamping the low side of high to low gates.
---
More safety for career highsec grinders. No change for actual newbies because they always flew under the wardeccers' notice. 
---
Damn :/
---
Who fucking cares? You get (almost) nothing for it.
---
Better to gank freighters instead. As (almost) everyone that was in wardeccing has now shifted to doing.
---
Good stuff ;=)
---
Test cant beat panfam without supercapital, like goon 1 year ago in hakonen. 
---
Lets be honest, you guys were dicking around in Goon space until not terribly long ago. 
---
&gt; some see the entire CSM as leakers
---
given the history of CSM leaks I cannot really blame them ....
---
I don't know if its memory bias but I'm almost certain the accidental Police Pursuit Nyx had more blinky lights than this one.  What a rad few days that was.
---
Toxic!
---
LoL        
---
Wanted to give a serious post here ... but i guess you where probably one of those guys shooting plated caracals.           
---
Don't get me wrong - i am guy shooting t1 industrials carrying over 700mil.  
---
But i am doing it for profit and my targets are not poor - simply stupid. 
---
TBH they were dead long before that. Just because it had a pulse doesn't mean its really living. 
---
make more friends then
---
If one were to suspect they are selectively enforcing it to give some players/groups more leeway than others, what would the indications be? I could agree it is badly enforced in general and still conclude the former. Why aren't the concord baiters banned? Falcon even publicly warned them. We know they used an "exploit". Where are the punishments? I haven't seen anything.
---
There is really no way around it. They are clearly protecting certain players.
---
It's disgusting, right?
---
Tell me who ?          
---
Like give example and link killmails. 
---
It's not about the act of voting it starts with how to vote for? 
---
So then you have to spend 3/4 hours watching everyone talk about eve to make an informed decision, now the problem is you lose a % of people with all of those steps ( null sec solves this by handing people a filled in ticket ) they can do this because they have a trusted authority figure.
---
Now the easy solution is to just tell everyone what to vote for but well that brings it's own issue's ( namely you need somebody with authority now ). 
---
CCP could divert 10% of the resources that went to the agency and implement a voting system right on the character select screen.
---
Any composition rebalance can be exploited.
---
I was making T3 destroyers. I had to stop when I heard about the change coming to the materials. (doubling in most cases)
---
Because otherwise I'd have ramped up production, to stockpile before they became more expensive to make.
---
Ship rebalances can be exploited. If a ship is becoming better, then buy it up before it does, when it's probably cheaper, sell when people want it. 
---
See how that goes? We _have_ to be careful.
---
How many hours of interviews did you watch last CSM, or did you just copy the alliance ticket? because I suspect a majority of null voters copy the alliance ticket press vote and done. 
---
LP store only for the Palatine. 
---
Why would anyone waste 50m wardeccing to kill a caracal? I'd only do that over a serious grudge, the sort that would motivate me to shoot an Azbel.
---
Actual wardeccers looked for expensive ships. Deadspace fitted strategic cruiser doing missions? Worth a dec. Orca and exhumer fleet? Worth a dec. T2 fitted battleship? Not worth it.
---
I mean this fix, isn't gonna help tbh, the reality is CCP has a hard time doing something that will force nullsec into small groups and well any nerf at this point to super production is only gonna entrench the established power blocs. 
---
Plus there is this problem if GSF gets pissed enough CCP is broke.
---
If not this then something, there needs to be some kind of reform and if that can't happen then get rid. Of the current CSM half (generous est) do any kind of community events or engage with the eve population. There are even one or two current members who campaign on the fact and are open about an unwillingness to do anything outside of their bloc. How this does not result in CSM membership being revoked is beyond me.
---
I love that TAPI is farming Panfam.  I was in TAPI (then known as TEST) when PL started farming TEST for content and followed them for continuing farming.  I'm extremely pleased that the tables have turned, and I thought that Provi was hilarious.
---
It's the involvement with Goons that I utterly dislike, and the smugging about TAPI achievements when 1000 goons tag along.  I mean, whatever floats your boat, but to me the second largest coalition in game batphoning the largest coalition in game strips them of all bragging rights whatsoever.
---
There is no way I will link my (reasonably easily doxxed) Reddit account to my EVE characters. I've had more than one IRL threat in game.
---
I mean. He is not totally wrong. Eve is not known for hand holding. And being able to some of your own research is not a bad idea. Your questions have already been answered multiple times. Just doing a Reddit search on this sub like "new player " or "returning player" will give you many things to read. 
---
Your questions seem to already be awnsered. So I won't go into them. 
---
Yea I never really thought of that dude as being representative of TEST. All he ever seems to do is run around Provi (or camp it, lately) and try to drop people.
---
I mean, if TEST at large were camping us, this would be an entirely different scenario. But this 2-4 alt stratios/blops gang isn't really that much of a threat. Even in our worst TZ this guy is at severe risk of having a strong counter-drop on standby waiting for him.
---
lol
---
&gt;I've had more than one IRL threat in game.            
---
Have you considered reporting this to CCP to perma ban such player or group of players.           
---
CCP is pretty fast in this kind of situations.           
---
Goons and test would still have made an alliance.
---
would not solve it because the biggest issue isn't pressing the vote button it's how the fuck to vote for. ( that's the research-intensive step ) 
---
WWB is the name, casino war is the narrative Mittens want you to believe
---
Yes. That's what I just said.
---
"I was there"
---
The last two I checked up on were still playing months after the threats were reported.
---
Something something narrative trying to rename things because important.
---
/u/ccp_falcon         
---
I assume this guy is trolling, but if those RL threads where real i guess you want to know about it. 
---
Ive seen more meaningful content in highsec in the form of wars and pvp thanks to the changes. I look forward to the fixing of the more abusive war mechanics still in place but this is a fantastic start. 
---
Wow, you can't throw around RL threats like that!
---
It's a burn geminate to the fucking ground party everybody's invited
---
TBH i wonder why CCP didn't send to all old users information about wardec changes.        
---
Single email that have only this in content and also clearly this stated in subject. 
---
I imagine its mostly alts. In the last year I have moved from 2 omegas to 5 omegas and I don't even have that many alts compared to some of my corp mates
---
I'm all for Grrrr Goons at times (or any other null block for that matter), also I get your points and you're right on most of them but two issues:  
---
* CCP can choose what they do with CSM from how meta is I wish to believe even 'Null blocks' can see how unhealthy the game meta is.  
---
* Brisc has proven himself, might some rare expertise to table and might also be some Null Block line member but if you recall when the all 'HIC changes' fiasco went, Brisc was there listening on reddit, trying to take that in and I wish to belive him and other more knowledgeable CSM were asking CCP to fix things, which they end up doing, Brisc gets +1 from me for this alone, CSM is also about voice of players even if CCP just doesn't seem to wish to listen.
---
In my experience people don't wardec bling fit people, they gank them. I generally fly stupidly blingy ships and I've been ganked (and attenmpted ganked) loads but I've never been war decced for it. So this change hasn't altered that at all.  
---
The amount this has changed appears to be almost nothing from my experience. I didn't even know the mechanic has changed until I read this thread and I've not seen an increase in high/low gate camping or an increase in ganking. I'm currently in high and low sec and I haven't noticed any difference at all.
---
Concord baiters? If someone uses an exploit before it is deemed an exploit they don't get banned. Only if they use it afterward are they banned for abuse. The indication of one group being favored over another would, for example, be all the bots in the drone regions being banned, but all the bots in Delve being left alone. 
---
I got no alts at all
---
TISHU resurrected itself briefly then folded into Snuff. 
---
Hey mate, when does the test campaign in germinate start?
---
It's just tens of thousands of shit astras clogging up space. It's not a big deal it's just irritating having to see peoples POS all over the fucking place, at least previously they were restricted to moons. 
---
What is the Corp tax rate?  
---
Is friendly fire on?  
---
Do they have any active War Decs or able to be War Deced under the new changes?
---
[https://eve-tracker.org/whkills](https://eve-tracker.org/whkills) here you can (usually) see the most active wh corps, a great list to go through to find a suitable group for you. But somehow it's not fetching corpnames for me rn.
---
If you mean stuff like mining mini games and drone micro management, it's never going to happen for the same reason that wardecs got nerfed. CCP needs subscribed afk alts mining and flying VNI's, otherwise they'll lose a significant chunk of their subscribed accounts.
---
Just have a tank. I was doing these in a brick tanked Legion back when they first came out. 
---
&gt; downloaded it all through steam
---
RIP
---
The reports were real. And a couple years ago. 
---
If you want to see much worse than I ever got, check out st0ner smurf's old blog (he's a different person to me). He got a hell of a lot of threats. Or hell, look at the minerbumping site every other Saturday.
---
Even if it was a Minokawa, I doubt it would've done much to help against 20-something dreads
---
Decent turnout for all involved all things considered.

When the subs fight actually kicked off, this is what local looked like:

Are you suggesting that some sort of high sec player police force was going round wardeccing "scam" corps in high sec before these changes because if that existed I wasn't aware of it. I was aware of high sec corps wardeccing small newby friendly player corps who were trying to establish themselves though and this change protects them. If those player police exist they can still grief "scam" corps if they want to by ganking them.   
---
There will never be a perfect solution to high sec war decs but anything to retain more new players is a good thing from my perspective. Perhaps some of these war dec corps will grow some balls and move to low sec or null sec to get actual fights rather than just pick on new players or small corps who stand no chance of defending themselves which is the situation we had before.
---
Jeez thats a surprisingly reasonable summary. Am I on reddit?
---
&gt; PL (46)
---
Okay they really are dead.
---
rofl shadow cartel dropped 6 blops on a hype with an apostle on stand by.
---
Well, since tapi is blue with everybody around them except for provi there's a big chance that provi will get invaded by them for content
---
What is "The Casino War" ?
---
This is nullsec in a nutshell, what else did you expect? Honor brawls and meaningful pvp? 
---
T1 cruisers aren't really flown a whole lot except if you really want to get a fight. Caracal are great because missiles and they also are good anti tackle, Moas, Vexors, Ruptures are all ok too.
---
&gt; But if you recall when the all 'HIC changes' fiasco went, Brisc was there listening on reddit, trying to take that in and I wish to believe him and other more knowledgeable CSM were asking CCP to fix things, which they end up doing;
---
For a start, no he wasn't. Idk if you're in Praise Bob but he was getting railed there for suggesting ideas that were almost worse than what CCP were proposing and completely not understanding the issue. We kept trying to explain that the problem is the chance of getting rolled out, and he'd just be like "well you live in wormhole space, it should take effort to roll holes".
---
The whole point is he shouldn't need to listen. CCP brought up the same idea the previous year when Noobman was on the CSM, he explained why it was a problem for w-space and what would be needed to replace it at which point CCP basically went "oh that sounds like effort nevermind then". No reddit drama required, not shitshow necessary.
---
Fast forward to this 2018, it comes up again, there's no one on the CSM who knows anything about w-space so it continues uninterrupted to a dev blog (with that pathetic message about w-space being "collateral damage" no less) proposing a false dichotomy between fixing lurch HICs and fucking W-space and end up with a mess. Eventually after much "input" and "representation" CCP ultimately ends up implementing one of the ideas that had been discussed the previous year when it came up with Noobman on the CSM and everyone's happy.
---
The HIC change fiasco isn't a +1 for people like Brisc, it's a perfect case study in why they have no business being on the CSM.
---
thanks to new chat system loading time is..oh wait
---
$20 says no meaningful kills will happen between legacy and goons.     
---
Idk even know why people bother with the propaganda it's obvious as fuck.
---
I see you have never met griffin or falcon alt broke then 
---
OK this will be down-voted to hell but i was i was talking about afk camping.       
---
It is totally fine ! The whole concept of cloaky camping.  But it lacks any active counter-play letting smaller groups to manage camping.           
---
Lack of active counter play makes players feel powerless - and this is not good. ( i am not talking about counter-play in form of counter hot drop )             
---
**BY ALL MEANS I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ABILITY TO DECLOAK CAMPERS**          
---
But imagine yourself ability to pinpoint their location using some structure and then have ability to launch bombs into this "grid" that will explode randomly on it. (all pinpointing is kept within this mini play)                    
---
Based on "feedback from the system" you are getting information if you hit something or not - letting you to focus on smaller and smaller area on the grid.           
---
Eventually you could probably destroy ship if person not respond to this bombing in any way ... or have untanked ship.          
---
**Mostly it is giving the players ability to do have some counter play**                    
---
&gt; rather than just pick on new players or small corps who stand no chance of defending themselves which is the situation we had before.
---
You spelled "target wealthy, established career highsec players who had the resources to defend themselves but an attitude of 'that's CCP's job'" a little bit wrongly there.
---
Noone ever bothered wardeccing actual newbies in their cruisers. The 50m fee made that a fool's endeavour. 
---
Sometimes you'd dec a corp because you saw a blinged Paladin but your only kills would be against newbies. My approach was to speak to newbies that lost a ship in situations like that and more than one of them wound up abandoning their dead end highsec career corp and finding homes where they could experience what EVE actually offered rather than a 'level up to a Raven' mentality.
---
____________
---
In any case player retention numbers are in freefall since Citadel removed most of the conflict drivers. One more driver of conflict gets the final nail in the coffin (although this was a small change, the real change happened when the watchlist was nerfed).
---
It was deemed an exploit in 2015.
---
&gt;The indication of one group being favored over another would
---
It's more granular than that.
---
Whoops, horde forgot to ping eight times to make you guys stand down.
---
Salt farming != RL threats.            
---
There is huge difference.            
---
Stoner is a nice guy, always willing to help and pod home to save time.        
---
We need more players like him. 
---
I'm on about the exploding ones that can be mined in K-space, he had a real hardon for a Venture.
---
Wow thats some new level of bullshit
---
and there not wrong
---
Yeah Horde is such a strong, independant alliance that would never stoop to a batphone.  
---
If it irritates you so much, wardec and take them down.
---
I like this idea alot
---
WH content depends largely on the static of the wormhole where the corp lives.   
---
If you are interested in rolling the nullsec static and roaming around look up c2  groups with a ns static (Kronos Ritual, Odin's Call, Hard Knocks are some I am familiar with).   
---
C5/C5 groups(Lazerhawks, NoVac, TDSIN) tend to brawl other large groups and typically clash with other wormhole corps more often. They still roam ns often though.  
---
C4 groups (Pospy, NJED, WhSoc, are some I know of) are kinda c5 lite with a lot of wh content and not so strict requirements concerning activity and skill. 
---
I am considering coming back to EVE too and did some research for myself so I hope this info is helpful to you.
---
When I was active wh life was the most fun, small gang high skill players roaming nullsec and fighting the blob is where EVE shines I believe. Good luck in your search. 
---
yeah
---
I'm convinced there's actually two people behind your Reddit account. The guy who posted this, and the guy who makes those fucking awful shitposts.
---
Fuck I love irony. Tells people to do research but is in an org that does it for you and sends it to you in a nice little ping. Never change goonies.
---
Yes we do. And he has had a fuckton of IRL threats made to him. A fuckton. (Assuming his posts to the blog are all truthful, as I assume they are).
---
James 315 had even more IRL threats pointed at him, again assuming his posts to his blog are all true.
---
I've done a lot less ganking and other pirate-y stuff than those two so I think I only got 3 or 4 threats that were worth reporting. James claims to get a couple per month.
---
I disagree. When I started in 2012 bunch of us noobs made our own corp (twice)... We were constantly wardec'd and farmed by 'mercs and pirates' all whilst trying to learn the game and trying to have fun... Eventually I gave up and joined a nullsec corp and haven't looked back since. 
---
?? We were a founding member of the allied WWB forces.
---
Make cloacking consume cap, so you need to recharge after some time, or anything that make the cloaking time finite, and not infinite in order to avoid perma afkers. 
---
Why do you need to italicize or capitalize for a normal sentence? Do you see other people writing that way here? Do you write papers that way?
---
Also, just so that I hope you actually *use it*, you can **italicize** and even BOLD stuff using one or two ** before and after whatever you want to italicize or bold.
---
&gt; Eventually I gave up and joined a nullsec corp and haven't looked back since.
---
Seems to have ended well. 
---
Only for me... The 10 other members of my noob corp stopped playing 
---
I stand corrected, received the wrong optics from looking at reddit while losing the will to even watch the shit show in disbelief to how oblivious CCP can be at times, which never seize to amaze me.   
---
Maybe not have J-space CSM member is also on us, if everyone and their alts decided to vote in J-Space we should be able to push one in.
---
Casino War, WWB, who really gives a rats arse,  other than those that mine the salt that it causes
---
you must be from TEST hence why the hate and the anger issues you are having....but your insults show your level of maturity so for me to be  a 12 year old seems like I have more class than you sir.... :)
---
Venceremos !!!
---
How much damage does these actually do? What kind of tank you would need to survive it?
---
because no friend ?
---
Tbf a super capital umbrella is a hellva drug.
---
100% agree but CCP doesn't. Super proliferation was bad in 2015, instead of tackling it by reducing numbers they enabled it so anyone who can stomach mining could get a Titan instead.  The game is just not enjoyable any more. Best thing they could do is rollback to 2010. 
---
Same story here, I was head of a hisec Corp/alliance for a while everyone in it was fairly new, got wardecced for ~12 weeks straight, tried to fight back, the wardeccers pulled a vanishing act only to come back later on
---
Over the course of the 12 weeks we went from ~300 to 5 people actively playing with the vast majority just quitting the game and never having come back.  Of those 5 who stayed I am now the last remaining playing as the others suffered the same shit elsewhere
---
I actually rather use near2 for the Commander Spawn rather than intel, I use a scout to cover my ass while I run my VNIs. When something interesting comes, I think about what ships I have to take it, if it's something absurde, I'll just wait for it to pass. 
---
The thing is, PvE ships just are not content. I mean, okay for Rorquals, Carriers or Supers, but ratting Gilas/VNIs/Snakes ? What's the point ? Feeling superior to a ship that is rigged for ratting ? Boy is that elite AF. 
---
This is not a counter - gameplay - but something that in negative way affect many different play styles and tactics.          
---
My whole idea is about making both sides to put in work and some thinking into whole process. 
---
How many VNIs did you kill tho? 
---
that would be a really good idea, There must be tens of thousands who have left or given up due to the absurdly horrific experience they created.
---
if only 10% gave EVE another try it would double the number of players.
---
And this is why I think the initial changes to wardec has been well received... You can still make your own little corp, but make an NPC station your home. Win
---
Hey almost 2:1. Surprised test even took the fight with those odds. 
---
actually, i'm not sure if it would be downbrigaded that much...
---
but even IF. If you got a nice idea to make afk stuff more activ, but not too boring, CCP would for sure try to implement it. VNIs on the other hand are in my opinion not that critical, because their impact is lower (except botting, but that is another problem)
---
Is that what you call extracting from Fountain into Outer Ring until Lenny put up a bunch of ISK for you to hide behind NC/PL?
---
Don't take it wrong mate, but if you don't get content while drifting from a stargate or staying near it, then you are probably doing it wrong. I understood a while ago that VNI "content" is pure BS, when I want a fight, I just take a BS and go roaming, content guaranteed. 
---
yeah yeah because every corp in nullsec is full of elite players
---
Don't play through steam
---
Highsec: Procurers/Skiffs is usually the option, solo miners may use retrivers for the hold. Hulk/Mackinaw in highsec is like standing around with a big "KICK ME" sign on the back. You will get ganked. Even in like a 0.9 system.
---
Lowsec: whut? who mines in lowsec?
---
Wormholes: they only have weird sex orgies;
---
NPC null: **crickets**
---
Sov null: Rorquals all the way, i personally like covetors IF you are mining together with rorquals (compression to compensate for the low ore hold and rorqual remote reps and their sentries in case rats spawn). You could upgrade to hulks eventually, or you could just train for a rorqual instead...
---
the carebears grinding l4 missions in hs in a raven navy issue 5years ago are the ones ratting in supers nowadays...
---
Lets be fair to them, they have fought us at times with even numbers and won, like they did a couple of weeks ago when trashing our Muninns (though part of that was me fucking up a warpin, but they capitalized on it very well to convert it).
---
It does become difficult to have a 2 coalitions vs one contest, but it is what it is.
---
Are you sure your grand idea doesn't have something to do with a gate and... oh what region was it?
---
but isn't kalevala another region?
---
As soon as PH went home after the failed Branch invasion, Gobbins asked GotG for help in Geminate... He got told to get fucked... 
---
Their differences make them better. 
---
Out of Focus is recruiting.
---
when goons deploy aswell xD
---
Just remember to pay your N.S.P (Newbro Support Fund)
---
Basically a "minesweeper" minigame? 
---
actually the idea is NOT a bad idea, Being as EVE is a "submarine simulator" in space, the dropping of depth charges and a sonar space equivalent, would be trivially easy for an active player to avoid, but destroy inactive players accounts. 
---
whether players control these hunter killers (boring and a pain in the arse), or NPC actors, ie guristas etc, randomly hunt space, to clear out afk Cloaky campers, is open to question. Or even both methods depending on how quickly players want to clear them from system..
---
Can you give me some more details?
---
This is exactly how we should be paying CCP. Would you prefer the alternative to be paying for modules, ammo, ships or other things?
---
I don’t envy your coalitions position that’s for sure. 
---
I member
---
&gt;  im sure theres lots of "fun" to be had.
---
Yes there is you truck full of salt. It's not because CCP is wasting Eve benefits that Eve isn't fun until you have a full industrial set up, 30 afk VNIs and 5 caps alts.
---
If you blow them up can you get a popup that says 'You sunk my battleship!' ?
---
a decade ago we didn't have citadels which is at the heart of this change
---
Keep in mind that Eve is a sand box and is no classical MMO. A lot of the fun of Eve comes from figuring stuff out, exploiting the possibilities and enjoying the complex interactions between players.
---
&gt; Being as EVE is a "submarine simulator" in space          
---
My point exactly - also it will make players feel less powerless - like those tears in local around 3rd day are nice - but like with wardecs - many of those players are leaving.          
---
It is not about removing cloaky camping but about giving players to do ... as they are not ratting after all :D          
---
That's okay, you win some, you lose some. I think as long as our members are having fun, we don't really care about the holding space element of it. A lot of us are very old players in EVE and it's a player driven meta; you have to learn to find what you enjoy and make it happen for you, otherwise the game is pretty much wasted.
---
Can someone explain background and what’s happening for an eve noob?
---
Tbh they did it to themselves.
---
Whenever TEST forms something fun and small (even some stupid frigate roam fleets) Horde starts ragepinging for BL, NC and PL and then drops 150 dudes vs 30 frigates. Test in return pings for rest of Legacy and Goons.
---
Ultimately both sides just wanna win at all cost, no matter if it was a gud fite or not. And both sides will post and circlejerk brs when they had 2:1 or 3:1 advantage and dunked their enemies.
---
And not so long ago it was Panfam that formed a huge coalition aimed at evicting Legacy. They will tell you it was Frat etc., but it's quite easy to see who was pulling the strings. They were the ones that created Imperial Legacy that day and now they need to face the consequences. 
---
I think you're getting confused here. We were in Fountain before and after WWB. And never lived in outerring.
---
Mmm, that is one of the broken things about goons.  bored sigs looking for content have more firepower than most alliances and some coalitions.
---
If you just cargo scan it, the count down do not start?
---
That position could easily have been avoided if panfam had the balls to invade delve instead of legacy space this summer. Instead they forced imperial legacy. This was panfam's choice.
---
Yes because those aren't the \#1 and \#3 alliances in the game in terms of numbers and this doesn't include their coalitions mates.
---
Over time the cloaking field could show as a faint cosmic signature, growing stronger over time, and the length of time a cloak is active contributes to a cool down on the signature strength so they can't just recloak to reset it.
---
Or make cloaks overheat and take damage over time requiring the player to dock and repair.
---
!
---
&gt;I'm sorry TEST cannot fight horde+PL+BL+NC. under their supercap umbrella.
---
1.Shield titan
---
2.ratting titan
---
3.Out of super range
---
4."Thats why i have 2 fax in system"
---
5. Thinking all blues wont just light a cyno on you 
---
6. Its a quick jump from cache
---
That guy has been begging for his titan to die it fucking seems like.
---
Cringe.
---
How is BL an n+1 alliance comparable to GSF... or the imperium even? are you that fucking dense?
---
&gt; you couldn't do it yourself so you had to call in goons
---
Yeah of course. We've come a long way in a short time but there's no way we could take on NC, PL, and Horde on our own. I'm not really seeing any of us suggest otherwise.
---
&gt;the second largest coalition in game batphoning the largest coalition in game strips both of all bragging rights whatsoever
---
Sheer numbers aren't everything. When the a really huge fight takes place both sides (Imperial Legacy vs Panfam and friends) bring pretty equal numbers. I'll brag and shitpost when I see my enemies getting dunked regardless of the circumstances, as is tradition.
---
&gt;It was deemed an exploit in 2015.
---
So report people you see doing it for exploiting. If you catch someone with evidence and they don't get banned post a thread on Reddit. 
---
&gt;&gt;The indication of one group being favored over another would
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It's more granular than that.
---
So wait you genuinely think CCP are showing favoritism to individual pilots?
---
Like people click throigub to YouTube when you can just watch it here. 
---
I need no CSM, nor I want someone to represent me as a player in eve. 
---
CCP made this game we all love, now they need to deliver more of what we need not what we want! If anything, CSM is part of the problem. Free up those resources and use it on game development.  
---
Kick Fraternity
---
Just another idea to this - to make this even more interesting.        
---
This 'Deep Charge Launcher" can be mounted only capital ship (including orca) - and when it is active - it gives a normal weapons timer - so no tether for person using it.           
---
This way cloaky hunter will know that moment someone starts to hunt him ... there is a capital ship that cannot tether and can be blaped by bunch of bombers. ! 
---
Horde called help as well. They just didn't form that well. Panfam is capable of putting the numbers in fleet to fight this but didn't. TEST still is willing to go 1v1 no batphones on horde, but we already saw how that worked out in hisec.
---
The NPE is still hot garbage.
---
Hell yeah buddy!!!
---
"t was a wonderful time before the structure spam.
---
For what it's worth, I appreciate your honesty and hard work throughout.  If only everyone else who's served on the CSM was the same.  I'm quitting the game primarily because of the rampant cheating I've seen in the past few months.  Botting is out of control, and when I see that every where I turn, plus CSM members leaking inside info to help others, I know it's time to get out.  
---
She was kinda hot. 
---
Would likely be best to work like some of the FLEX structures, Low amount of timers, And then make it come out within 1-2 Hours of initial RF.
---
That way the group can keep roaming, Then come back to it towards the end and make some ISK from it.
---
The growth you see is all bots. 
---
good for you!
---
Players already did that. CCP falcon posted in it.
---
There is no point in reporting protected players.
---
&gt;So wait you genuinely think CCP are showing favoritism to individual pilots?
---
Why are you still at that stage? The evidence is there. The players are not banned. Why are they not banned? Because of CCP's passive support.
---
Do they actually being equal numbers? From every battle report I've seen for the big fights in the last few month the north is generally outnumbered by like 1000 and either doesn't commit or gets dunked by sheer numbers?
---
Killmail ;)

But i just edited 1st post - so both sides of the gameplay have a interest in this gameplay. 
---
wasnt even in super range....

---
You din't have a super cloaked after failed drop with 2 enemy fleets on the same grid looking for you .... didn't you.          
---
Cloaking is not only about camping. 
---
Lol are you really pathetic enough your using the fact your not as big as the largest entity in the game so your not just another f1 monkey alliance? Throw shade all you want mate, just don't pretend you are any different. 
---
It does on stratops. Though the kool aid here on reddit might've skewed your view
---
Oh sure. Let's just fuck over J-space yet again in order to make null a happier place.
---
take an upvote lul
---
Actually I don't think all of J space organized would out vote the nullblocs.  There's just too many people out in null. 
---
Black Rise Mattered is recruiting
---
I'm surprised nobody posted about this yet, but it seems CCP is adding support to remotely purchase, and inject skills trough the character sheet.
---
&gt; Please try again later. Alternatively, you can also find and purchase skill books on the regional market.

.
---
&gt; You are about to buy the following skills for a total cost of {[numeric]cost.isk}:

&gt; Are you sure you wish to continue?

Who cares? We don't need to convince them. The rest of us will call it WWB regardless.

He is taking a break from eve, obtaining his GED and securing either a trade of some sort or enrolling in college. Idk if he’s decided. But i can’t wait to give him the titan I promised him for completing his education in some way. 
---
bleh
---
It's a little early in the game to be starting with the "We didn't want that space anyway" theme isn't it?
---
a couple of my alpha alts got an email about wardec changes a couple months ago, not sure if that really counts though
---
Exact mechanics of timer are unknown.
---
You’re half retarded if you think any invasion of delve is going to work.
---
Sorry. Made a mistake up there. Full retarded.
---
damn,you're right, I don't provide a sponsor history, that's a huge oversight on my part
---
I made a github issue for it so I won't forget: https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/issues/184
---
Which players? You've yet to present a single shred of evidence of individual players being protected. Who were the people who exploited the Concord baiting thing? Where is ANY evidence of them doing this? 
---
Woah that video had a super strange effect, either that or was just from movement from the camera man, pretty trippy.

Final fix pirats bounty mode set up agens Who Pay 60% of The bounty if you can kill this guy No more freedom to be a pirat with bounty on you The system is broken useless you get 20% of a ship to 5 10 mil an They have bonty for 10 Bill its a joke this system.. 
---
What is the name of this thread? Why is he not banned when we know he used command broadcasting?
---
I think it was those who ganked all the freighters in jita.
---
Yep, also this information was not showing directly.         
---
What you do with emails from games you no longer play?  (assuming you didn't define a rule to delete them?)        
---
Delete just looking on the sender - but you also notice subject.       
---
Putting only this info in subject is actually something you need to do. 
---
 Wow.. that melted quick! 
---
Blink and you missed it!!
---
By "over time" I didn't mean "immediately fuck this guy", I meant like after 10 hours or something, something to force long term abusers of risk aversion mechanics off the field and give them some quality time to reflect on their poor choices
---
You're deluding yourself if you think the 2018 iteration of Delve could ever be assailed by our single coalition.
---
Besides I thought you'd won that war with Winter Coalition, cementing yourselves as the number 2 contender, and that this North deployment was about making yourselves a stronger force?
---
No offence, I get that you guys want the occasional easy win too (we all do), but Number 1 and Number 2 beating up a not-at-full-strength Number 3.
---
If you want to keep it enjoyable though, Number 2 vs Number 3 suits us just fine, its pretty much even stevens on numbers that way too.
---
But it's entirely your call, and you can justify it however you want, just don't try to sell the rest of us those bad eggs lol.
---
&gt;I'm sure if panfam fell apart, the game would improve. Test, goons, frat. That's all the game needs in it
---
Honestly, it wouldn't matter. Some of y'all would quit, but most if you would just somewhere else.
---
Get over yourself. The game would be fine without you.
---
Branch.
---
Not really. The largest combat squad is Space Violence, maybe 3-400 real people. Reavers is a couple hundred guys at most.  Liberty Squad much smaller than both.   
---
Reavers fought under the gotg super titan umbrella outnumbered for months until they were baited and lost 5 titans.   
---
&gt; Noone ever bothered wardeccing actual newbies in their cruisers.
---
The story of the game for me as part of brave newbies was living under constant wardecs for the first year of being in the game. caused me to leave for a long time.
---
guy is asking about which wh corps to join and there is a 1000 other threads about ns stuff you can spam..
---
dunno why you gotta spam this thread with that stuff too
---
The fuck you talkin' 'bout, Willis?
---
That's a bad google translate ....
---
Then keep your supers and titans docked up. They are fighting you on your ground. They can't win under your umbrella by themselves. 
---
Makes it harder for the guys rmting. 
---
That's really too bad. I would have loved to play that game if it had actually made it past a proposal. Rather than Diablo With Ships Online 2019. 
---
oh shit why you make me upvote, damn you stainguy
---
Personally Id have just made cloaking take fuel, and make something like lo smaller in size.
---
like 10 units a cycle,
---
maybe increase the length of the decloak timer so theres a longer gap before you can recloak.
---
(this last one might help bs's be a little more relevant again)
---
Because 1. It takes time for CCP to investigate this shit and 2. Its not clear he ever actually gained and advantage through this. As I said before when Gaara was causmght on video red handed it took like 3 months for CCP to ban him, and all that time he was rorqual mining hardcore. 
---
Why not active gamplay requiring time of both sides? 
---
Don't let your dreams be memes, just do it!

I missed you art work. Shits good

losing renters, crab space, and market hubs is the way to the poor house. why not srp non strat ops if cash is plentiful?...

---
Eve is a cheap way to spend a few hours during the cold, empty period after the holiday season. 
---
I don't anymore. 
---
I'm pretty sure I haven't said we don't want it.
---
I have said we're mature enough to learn to adapt if we lose it, though.
---
Something with Stain and Venal. Venal has two gates to Branch, Stain has none. That's not fair. IIRC this was the issue.
---
Andi is back!&lt;3
---
How would this make it harder to RMT? There are millions of ways you can transfer ISK and Assets.
---
If it is, it would be a miracle.  Has anyone ever seen an advertisement for EVE?  The only advertising I ever see is an occasional youTube spot in between watching "How to EVE" videos.
---
C'mon CCP....How about "Longest Running MMORPG" ads in Gamestops or Gaming Mags. 
---
It's possible I am just standing outside the target of their advertising but I feel like EVE is invisible to new potential players.
---
Something like scanning down cloaky ships? =)
---
eli5?

many EVE players are friendly to newbies but the game EVE isnt 
---
&gt; 55 Alliances fight Goons during the Casino war, no one complains. Two  alliances fight PanFam during this war, Reddit erupts with whining... 
---
Goons wasn't the largest alliance at that epoch? 
---
The "tutorial" as part of the new player experience got changed to contain much less content recently. It might be the case that the information you read was about the old tutorial which is no longer in use. 
---
I think you may things a little garbled there. You're saying that there are no content drivers but you're limiting things to high sec. Why don't people like you who want pvp content move to low/null/WH where you would have it in abundance? Simply because you're risk averse and prefer to have the support of concord and pick on people who aren't ready to defend themselves yet. Really, if you want content drivers you should be moving out of highsec yourself.   
---
The truth of the matter is high sec is now exactly that, high security space where small corps can't get massively screwed over by overwhelming force unless they actively participate in that side of the game. It doesn't stop pvp content, it just limits it in high sec and high sec only. You want pvp content? Pick on the corps and alliances in high sec that have structures and invite wardecs or go to low or null.   
---
I really don't understand the mentality of "I deserve to be able to pick on people in high sec with impunity irrespective of the effect it has on new players and the player base overall". You want PvP there are many avenues for it available to you. Pick one and stop crying about it.
---
This change just means that corps will put their structure in shell alliances. The real fix should be tieing the ability to wardec someone to the level of their economic activity like their ratting or mining profits on individual member levls over time.
---
If a corp on average through its members should be able to afford to defend itself it should no longer be protected from wardecs whether they know PVP or not. If they don't know how to PVP at a reasonable profit point they deserve to be farmed to death or go back to low profitability by staying docked.
---
The new activity tracker should make this solution trivial to implement.
---
Unfalsifiable and inseparable from protecting. I have reported bots for months, nothing happens. Players reported the botting supers for months, dont think anything happened there.
---
It is clear he used command broadcasting. This is illegal and a 30 day ban. But apparently he was previously banned for botting according to some, so hes up for a perm ban. CCP doesnt want that, so nothing happens.
---
&gt;As I said before when Gaara was causmght **on video red handed it took like 3 months for CCP to ban* him, and all that time he was rorqual mining hardcore. 
---
So delaying is not based on the strength of the evidence. CCP protecting some players for whatever reason explains the situation.
---
if only we had something like this in elite dangerous, I might come back to eve yet
---
We'll never out vote them but we should be able to push one CSM member in.
---
As far as we know the timer starts when you are on grid uncloaked.
---
ikr
---
I was a bit removed in 2018, logged in once and a while, didn't really do deployments, and even eased off r/eve a bit.
---
Eve Havana, when?
---
Maybe try making a good post instead of a bad one and it won't get downvoted
---
I can tell you are very angry, and if it helps at all I have been angry plenty of times in this game too. One of the most interesting things about EVE is that being a sandbox, it’s unfair. You can do all sorts of things that in most games you could not, from bringing a bunch of friends to surprise someone in a duel, to scamming people out of their hard-earned ISK, to forming a big gang of your friends and knocking over someone else’s sandcastle that they fought hard to build.  
---
While this open endedness results in many unfair and frustrating moments, it also opens the game wide up to amazing and surprising outcomes. So many game queue you up in an arena with evenly matched opponents and an expectation that you will win half the time, and lose half the time. Perhaps your rating goes up and down, but at the end of the day, almost everyone playing the game has a “win half the time” experience, and it’s rare that something genuinely surprising happens. In EVE, there are no such guardrails, the unexpected can and does happen, and people can craft their own interesting stories. The friends you make matter, the skills you develop, the preparation, the planning, the intel gathering, they all form part of the framework that will make you successful or not, and in that EVE is a little like real life. I don’t know, but I suspect this is a big part of what makes EVE seem more “real” then other games.   
---
You are getting a negative reaction from everyone here because you have come as a new player, and you are attempting to apply social pressure to change the rules of the game. By and large EVE players don’t agree with you because they like the game without guardrails. While it absolutely leads to moments where a more experienced player uses two ships to kill a newer player (or half a dozen players kill one player, or a Titan gets dropped on a T1 frigate), it also leads to stunningly beautiful moments where one player uses their skill, their cleverness, and their abilities to defeat many.  
---
In this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9dbcWoCjL8 Chessur is in a T1 frigate by himself, and is often engaging a whole gang of people, many of whom are in larger and more expensive ships. If there was either a rule, or a cultural convention that prevented this, and instead maintained that a t1 frigate could only ever be engaged by a single other t1 frigate, then this video would not exist, and we would all be the poorer for it.   
---
While people like to win, and by far the most common thing to do in EVE is come to a fight with as many advantages as possible, some people do the opposite, and try to win against the greatest odds possible. These are our heroes, and they tell the most exciting stories. It’s why people love the videos made by the like of Rooks &amp; Kings, Chessur, Lously Lou and all the others who say “Bring all your friends, I would like to fight every one of you”.  
---
At this point you have a choice, you can write off EVE as a “Game for jerks” and go play any of the countless other games that promise a safe, dry, fair predictable experience. There are countless such games, and many of them are quite fun in their own right despite these limitations (I still very much enjoy chess, and it is absolutely this type of game). The other choice is you can decide you want to find a way to succeed in this very hostile environment, and maybe even becomes the sort of player that chooses to come to the table with less than the maximum possible advantage for the sheer joy of outplaying your opponents. Maybe if you do that next time you kill the bait and slip free. Maybe you kill the bait and then when the trap is sprung you kill that ship too.   
---
If you chose the latter, a couple of points you may find helpful. I find that it gets me in the right frame of mind to think of EVE as an ecosystem simulator. Players are generally both predator and prey at the same time, and everyone who is in space has a set of things that can kill them, and a set of things that they can kill. It is the job of every pilot in space that wants to engage in PvP to find things they can kill, and avoid the things they cannot. To the extent that you fail at this, it’s on you, and the only thing to do is examine your play and see what you can do better. I find that often when a situation seems impossible, on giving it some thought I realize there were many thing I could have done better. If someone seems keen to engage you in a ship that you have a good matchup against, there is a good chance it’s bait. Punishers are always bait. During a fight, you should be refreshing DScan a lot, the sooner you see incoming reinforcements the sooner you can start trying to bail on a fight (I realize this is hard, I understood this concept WAY before I was able to micro well enough to do it, if you keep working on it, it will come). Lastly, if you decide that despites it’s many failings, EVE sounds like a game you would like to get better at, you can reach out to me here, on youtube, or on discord and I will be happy to give pointers, I like helping new players get up and running with solo PvP.

no one rmts using this

everyone who has any idea what they're doing does 'scams' to rmt

TEST can post again!!
---
You know - in WH space this mini game play could constantly show something ... as something is constantly lurking there - if you bomb long enough who knows maybe swarm of drifter bosses can warp to your location annoyed by your actions this.             
---
**They are there - even if you think no one is looking**          
---
Soooo many. Oh wait, those were Ishtars. Same model, just a lot more expensive.
---
wrong
---
When my corp was young we had 4 real people with 8 accounts. We didn't fly bling ships but we were war decced most of the time. In the end we all just stopped playing because we couldn't fight back as they would always have more people than us with logi and ewar so what could 4 people trying to get established do?   
---
We could all drop corp which negates any feeling of being a team or we could do what we did and simply stop playing for a while until the war dec corp got bored and let the dec lapse. So we'd cancel our accounts for a month and go play elsewhere.   
---
Most of these high sec wardeccers are simply fairly sizeable groups of people who would prefer to pick on people who can't defend themselves and guarantee winning over actually having to fight. That's why they're in high sec and not low/null/WH.   
---
If this pushes them to find they're content elsewhere it's a win. If it makes them start suicide ganking it's also a win because at least then they're targetting bling ships rather than the new and space poor.  
---
jesus proof read your shit
---
Yes the caracal is still a popular quick formup ship although many noon doctrines have switched to jackdaws since they are essentially better in every way except dps. I still see moas from time to time tho.
---
just remove local, cloaky camping fixed
---
Give me one example - as bots are one thing that could totally ignore wardecs. 
---
I'm still not in panfam. Live in a wormhole. 
---
The game needs more entities, not less. You can't tell me less entities is a good thing, unless you just want to krab all day. 
---
The CSM have managed to push through some important changes over the years.  
---
However, the fact that they are appointed by open election does mean that the system more or less guarantees that certain large Coaltions or Alliances will always have representation.  
---
As has been pointed out, in almost every session of the CSM, leaks, insider information spiking the markets and all other kinds of nonsense has emerged and CSM have been fired or resigned.  
---
The public perception that the CSM is nothing but a nullsec lobbying group isn't too far from the truth. 
---
&gt;cringe
---
No but the point is Gaara WAS permaed. It just took them forever. The GMs are undermannedand overworked. 
---
Poor Gevlon Goblin -- this completely destroys his livelihood.
---
/u/deltaxi65 forward this to CCP please
---
And therein lies the other issue with them. If I want to tear one down its a what, 2 week commitment? For a single 1 billion ISK structure. Previously a POS could be taken down inside of 3 or 4 days. 
---
yea he was ratting basically every single day as well for really long periods, and he would start pretty early in the day.
---
we found him and ship scanned him with a neutral that was just roaming around like 2 days before we killed him (didn't warp off when we ship scanned him with a neut malediction) and he was almost 0 cap when we scanned him too so we thought we would have a crack at him.
---
And why did it take them so long when the evidence was so clear? No investigation was needed.
---
They didn't even ban the Mittani after the death threats. They didnt fire "t20" after he was caught.
---
There is a pattern here.
---
Biomass your characters and leave then
---
but why if i can annoy someone even this way }:&gt;  ^^more
---
It could just be a quick connect between char sheet and market.
---
"The player community embarrassed us with juvenile antics.."
---
Well that's how it ends when you buy something you know nothing about :D 
---
no i drive many people away from the game through ingame ganking and harassment 
---
The only problem are the shitty overview filters. Either I filter out all engineering complexes, or I see all of them where I have docking rights in the entire system.
---
I would like to have filters "show all Sotiyos and all Athanors+Raitarus with blue standing in system" and " show all ECs on grid". If that was possible - why care if there are 50 or 500 neutral Raitarus in Perimeter?
---
Should there be so many, that they cause server issues (I don't think that will happen anytime soon), CCP will have to find a solution which doesn't require players to take them down. Maybe remove low powered ones automatically or something like that.
---
It cant be real!
---
Meh, fuckers like you are a dime a dozen at best. Make no real change, but feel big about what nothing they can do. 
---
t. who
---
They happen fairly infrequently. Sometimes you'll get a third party site like greenmangaming or humble bundle selling them 50% off. CCP sells them directly at this discount usually around Black Friday/Cyber Monday.
---
Note that the third party sites limit sales quite strictly (one or two per customer). You can also only activate one of each pack per account.
---
Well they gotta do something with those caps now I guess 
---
Yes it's literally impossible for video evidence to be doctored. And no reason for our enemies to mock up a video of someone 'input broadcasting' like this. An investigation is ALWAYS required.
---
Mittani never made death threats, they did give him a 30 day ban for what he said but 'lol kill yourself' was a very heavily used meme/insult back then so I think even that was harsh. The T20 shit was so long ago CCP didn't even have IA and as someone who has been investigated by IA trust me they are good at their jobs. 
---
And then when the shell alliance is wardecced, noone can defend it because noone else is involved in the war. Sure you can join a war I guess but then you may as well have the structure in your alliance I'm the first place.
---
They key wasn't to protect structures, it was to protect human interaction at a group level.
---
So, to me, it seems like a fine change.
---
Don't worry friend our beloved Lord and Savior Sansha Kuvakei didn't go anywhere.        
---
He always keep his eye on everything to keep the citizens content. 
---
I still say the better fix would have been to have neutral logi go criminal when supporting war aggression.
---
I believe this change simp ly moves the bar for losing players. 
---
Que vueltaaaa
---
Stop being salty about the loss, and stop being salty for people giving you grief for being salty
---
Why would he let you go after you killed his bait? 
---
The trap was set and you sprung it. He would probably rather have killed an AT ship, but you take what you can get. 
---
like yo leader lel
---
yeah, if only they'd test these things before deploying them on the test server
---
I still think CCP. missed a trick by not allowing offline/unpowered structures to be hacked. Rock up, use hacking module, 48 hours later structure starts deanchoring. I've been saying this since back in the offline pos days though. 
---
Purchase yes, but where does it say remote inject?
---
thats western spy squat ...
---
I'd like to watch some former wardeccers in Lowsec. Can you recommend a gate?
---
Local removal would have done the same.
---
I think you're confused. After Goons announced their Viceroy ideas Culture tucked tail and started taking every moon they could in Outer Ring out of fear of losing Fountain. It was only after Lenny announced he was funding WWB that you guys even considered joining the fight.   
---
I was in Culture during WWB. 
---
Please do, it would be good content for our boson Titans.
---
&gt;Reavers fought under the gotg super titan umbrella outnumbered for months until they were baited and lost 5 titans.   
---
Hey, INIT was deployed along with you guys, don't forget about us 
---
We're actually talking about skillbook injection, not skill injectors.
---
I totally agree on that. I get spammed by Eve ads on the internet but yea i already got the game Running on the background when surving the web. They should indeed do more advertising
---
Underrated comment.
---
Yey more micro improvements, that won't change anything in the game....
---
WTB big bold fixes &amp; rebalancing so this game can becomes great again, and not just capitals online :'(
---
You said you take any fights even unfavorables.
---
If he sat in the Plex and you engaged him directly to be killed, how would that change the outcome?
---
Why does it bother you do much that he let you kill something before shooting you?
---
ALSO goons singlehandedly took out rage
---
Just a few years ago (between 2011-2015) the peak login numbers were between 50k and 60k, so I would not call 38k growth.
---
Considering that the amount of accounts per RL player has increased significantly since then you can do your own math what that means for the actual count of RL players.
---
Your post brings up a good point that nobody talks about with new players (myself being one).  Everyone says:
---
1. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose. Check
---
2. Treat your ships like ammo, you will lose them. Check
---
Nobody says:
---
3. There are some sociopaths playing who will kick over your sandcastle and say nothing except "Get a Permit".
---
So, how do we handle this? Well, it is an interesting subject.  
---
I kill (and am killed) all day by other players in COD and other FPS and never bat an eye or think anything of it.  **Why, what is the difference that makes EVE kills taste so bad?**  *It's the grind.*  There is no grind in FPS.  Everything is handed out effortlessly.  But in EVE, everything you own is either real money or real time grinding and/or skilling into some new bling.  So, when somebody destroys that effort for their personal enjoyment, it stings and it should.
---
So, how do you move past?  I struggle with this as well.
---
1.  Pretend the people who killed you are really just over-powered AI.  Say to yourself, "the thing I love about EVE is it is never boring. The AI is always coming up with new and inventive ways to kill me."
---
 2.   Understand that these people are just looking for content.  They are bored and looking for excitement.  I do fault them for not making the grind connection though.  I suppose some of them are the sort of people who would mug someone in an alley in real life, but most just don't make the connection.
---
3. Make an ISK to Your Local Currency converter in Excel.  Once you have a handle on what 1 billion ISK = in the real world, your losses will become (and hopefully remain) laughable.  After realizing my gank loss was worth .37 USD I was able to laugh it off a little easier.  This will also help you understand what you can afford to undock.
---
Alphas can't even use cloaks so how would they scout anything and stay alive? I'm not a bot maker myself but what you describe sounds very hard to code. It would have to recognize who entered and who left or people could just fly inside with alpha pod and log off to shut botting system down. Don't be a nay sayers, there are endless ways CCP could solve this problems. I rat myself in a super but fuck this, lets watch the world burn. 
---
Greenmangaming and humble tend to limit how many can be purchased at one time from a customer which is rarther annoying tbh.
---
Also if you use GBP or EUR as a currency I would suggest using markeedragon's site because it charges you in USD. Galaxy Pack for 40 euros YES PLS.
---
if we did both it'd be at 90k pcu
---
So no amount of evidence is enough. How convenient when the purpose is protection.
---
&gt;Mittani never made death threats, they did give him a 30 day ban for what he said but 'lol kill yourself' was a very heavily used meme/insult back then so I think even that was harsh. 
---
Because he had protection.
---
&gt;The T20 shit was so long ago CCP didn't even have IA and as someone who has been investigated by IA trust me they are good at their jobs.
---
It is still going on. Just a passive version. The IA is clearly doing nothing.

And for the record I never said it was easy, I berated CCP for not facing the challenge of getting it's code base in order so that required performance and functionality like nested containers stops being a problem!

It was actually online ads that brought EVE to my attention, about a year ago. F2P is hard to pass up (and now they've got my money).

Wardeccers aren't after structure grind kills but after ganging individual people in their freighters or exhumers. Putting structures in a shell alliance is to protect people from being exposed to being killed by wardeccers. Obviously if you're dropping a Keepstar or Sotiyo you have a plan to defend it from attackers.
---
My solution is better because it avoids the possibility of putting the criteria for being "big enough to wardec" in a shell corp and cheating the system. Having an Astra is a shit definition of being big enough to defend yourself anyway. CCP just didn't want to make it impossible to remove citadels from HS I guess.
---
If you make enough money by having economic activity related to mining or ratting in the corp you should be exposed to wardecs and plan to defend your members to some degree. That's a much better definition IMO.
---
&gt; They were the ones that created Imperial Legacy that day and now they need to face the consequences.
---
Oh, how come have your buddies been telling everyone that Imperial Legacy was a thing for months before that conflict?
---

 There is always a cloaked Proteus watching you. If you feel safe, that just means there are two.

Goons have been fighting pl/nc since 2010, the game will be fine.
---

---
A corp can only get so big without having a structure. Even the smallest corps have a raitaru because it helps to have a base to refine their mining stuff. 'enough' money is always spurious and this way both sides have skin in the game. Attackers can be counter attacked. That's part of the problem - wardeccers previously couldn't be effectively countered.
---
If you kill their structure then they don't have any war any more.
---
I think that CCPs solution is the closest to fixed as you can get.
---
It's not about size, it's about choice. You can choose not to expose yourself to wardecs at the risk of having to use other people's structures that ARE at risk of wardecs.
---

---
Stop pretending that you are important.
---
Drone Walkers is on wrong side of BR.
---
Having economic activity is not spurious at all. And no you absolutely should not have a choice to make bank in HS and be protected from wardecs. Having an Astra is a shit definition of being big enough to protect yourself. And putting that Astra in a shell alliance is an easy way to avoid your members being ganked which is the main goal of wardeccers. Nobody cares for an Astra kill that takes a week and several hours of grinding. What wardeccers want is your blinged out exhumer that takes a few seconds to blow up when caught.
---
Flair checks out.
---
Since they won it
---
Ok mate, again you are tripping into tinfoil hat territory here. Just 'CCP is corrupt' with no actual evidence. 
---
BR screws with the sides as more kills are added/updated. I thought this was common knowledge. 
---
This is so very incorrect, I was in a Corp that had very little of value that got chain wardecced into disbanding. Even though they got very few kills from us they still kept renewing wardecs, remember a lot of these guys make a butt ton of isk botting to finance their grieftrains. I for one absolutely love the change, Eve doesn't feel safer for it but it does feel much less oppressive.
---

For many casual players it's important, that they can take a few months off, come back and don't lose anything substantial. Such players are only a small part of the active population on any given day, they are hardly present on Reddit or the forums, but they are a substantial part of the revenue for the company. Thus it's sensible to consider their needs. Eve would not become better if they quit. I like games, which are paid by people other than me (mostly, I have one sub).
---
The current rules are a good compromise. If you really want to get rid of something, you can wardec the owner and attack+destroy it. But it's effort and not profitable, thus everone who didn't make enemies ought to be mostly safe.
---
Tbf, At this point I imagine goons calling it that because it triggers the fuck out of everyone
---
v0v all I could do was say my piece and hope people voted for me. From what I've heard about the last couple years I'm kind glad I didn't get on. A few really frustrating sessions.

I was also 15 when I started playing and was always the youngest member in any corp I was in. Even now in my early 20's I'm still younger than most everyone I know who plays
---
try combantrin
---
Given the level of plex prices in-game, we are due a sale somewhere!
---
I'd rather new corps be immune to wardecs than get strangled to death every time they try to do something
---
Do you have some more details?
---
I don't want to shoot structures. I want there to be tension between living close to your friends and, therefore being safe, and ratting far away but making more isk. I want to hunt people, not structures. I only shoot structures so that I can shoot at ships. All that you have created here is a grindy, boring mechanic with little room in-between.
---
As mentioned in the OP, the 1st RF would reduce bounty payout from 100% to 75% in the system and 2nd RF would bring bounty down to 50% payout. So RF'ing with a gang does make it annoying for ratters as they'd be losing ISK in that system if they choose not to fight. Combined with other gangs roaming through and the possibility for the tags to drop, others will see these things on 1st or 2nd RF and continue poking them in the hope to get tags from them (once in RF, you cannot remove the accumulated tags).
---
Large tag drops+system wide visibility on RF gives incentive for people to blow them up. Yes, your gang may not get the tags on the one you put into 1st RF, but you're still effecting the bounties of everyone in system. 
---
Alternatively, instead of RF'd, you can just collect the tags from the ESS and continue on your, making isk regardless. Or steal some tags and then shoot it to put it into 1st RF. Making money and causing ratters/botters to lose isk.
---
&gt; Can someone explain background and what’s happening for an eve noob?

---
Saves them having to reimburse books I suppose, you can buy for a bit cheaper from the market. Obviously market seeding would stop but player orders would still exist.
---
You can rip Evictus but least they actually do something. Great pilots to fight daily. HTP who? 
---
Because the framework was in place for months, but not actually in effect until everyone decided to dog pile Test.
---
Come on man. You know God damn well how that all went down. Stop trying to advance your narrative be pretending to be stupid.
---
But you are dismissing all the evidence. There is more than enough to shift the burden of proof at this point. So you are just in denial.
---
But the fact is you DON'T lose anything significant if your citadel goes plooie. It's a 1 bil ISK POS, all your assets enter asset safety, you love the station and that's it. I would understand if there was significant loss when an astra is blown up but that's simply not the case. 
---
Nope it is heavy drone size. 
---
Happy to help.
---
Obviously new corps will be inefficient at mining ratting etc. and be immune until they are not by my rules as well. But when you're making dank ISK you should have a standing fleet capability to defend yourself to some degree. Being forever safe in HS by choice should never be a thing.
---

---
You realize you don't have to shoot it right? You can just steal from it and make isk while you roam through a system where no one wants to fight.
---
By shooting and RF'ing it, you are directly hurting people who sit in system and rat all day and choose not to fight. That is your own choice on if you want to do that, no one is forcing you to.
---
Whats your current option now on a roam? Warp through a system, see all the bots.. i mean "legitimate players" warp to a POS and nothing happens and you move on to your next destination. With this, you can go into their ESS, make some isk and either continue on to your desto, or RF it if you want to start annoying the bot owner who chooses not to fight.
---
Sure, the botter would move at some point, which opens them up to getting blown up, or their home will be found again, rinse/repeat.

And the point is that Isn't what the wardec mechanic was built to support. If you want to fight in highsec, fine, but this removes the one-sidedness of the old method.
---
You can't make bank in HS because the margins are thin, UNLESS you have your own 0% facilities and so on. At that point, you have to put down a structure. And if it's not in your corp or alliance, then it's at risk to HS wardeccers who can look at system indices etc.

There is no evidence that CCP are doing this to protect individuals. None at all.

Idk how you can say this entire paragraph and then say "all CSM needs is some more PR".

The year after year after year lack of whalers, FW persons, wormholers, NPSI, and even smaller null alliances etc. accumulates a huge issue with adequate representation. If you ask people like Brisc they can represent everyone by listening to them. We both however agree on that people need to be experts in fields to adequately represent their playstyles. Given that, I don't know how you can say CSM bodies constantly filled with large empire builders is non-problematic with respect to the nature of the feedback CCP is receiving.

on question 1, you want to find a nice mix of high volume AND high margin. best way to get on those is when a high volume item suddenly sells out of jita, or nearly sells out, meaning the volume is still high, but the margin can be 10-20-50+% for a few hours or days, depending.
---
when you sell is up to you. if you dont have that many orders to update, then you can just sell things as they come in. you will start to notice yourself that you might spend a lot of time updating all of these orders, (maybe you have 5 orders of 10 units), so next time you decide to wait till you have 50 units of that item before selling. it could also depend on your skills, and the number of free orders you have. if you find yourself suddenly at your max orders, then that problem will solve itself out as you have to wait for items to sell (or for your skills to train) before you can create more sell orders
---

Because with that warp speed your not gonna get far ( or at least not in a decent amount of time ). 
---
There is a difference between content and just feeding, i mean getting forced of the gate happens, like not every fight should be engaged ( and even with a t1 cruiser i will not feed it if i don't have to ), not because of killboard stats because how gives a fuck but because it forces my opponents to give me a fighting chance if they want a fight. ( or out play me something that shouldn't be hard i'm not that great at eve ).
---
HA!
---
where was it used? 
---
When has the mighty NC. ever sought out an even fight? Where was your sense of honor when you took Tribute using up your yearly batphone tariff in record time? We've been on the other side of this, and recently. Don't act like it's suddenly a negative thing  now the roles are reversed.
---
What is this feedback you don't want to give?  I am curious.
---
make it like FW gate sliding before CCP broke it - you are guaranteed entry as long as you hit warp as soon as you land
---
The price is worth it in my opinion. Sure, on principle we shouldn't let highsec become a safe space, but it's better to have a healthy game. I'd not mind seeing large ISK faucets removed from HS though.

Its the worst focus group I have ever seen because their respective skills don't 'focus' on each topic they are talking about.

A real focus group would pull people who had experience with each major change and let them hash out what would be best moving forward. Like the T3C and T3D rebalances which are some of the best changes in terms of balance over the last few years. 
---
The quoted text was obviously about skill books, so why post about something not relevant?
---
There is evidence, but you ignore it because you dont like it. You are clearly intellectually dishonest. Why would anyone give a known command broadcaster the benefit of the doubt? It's on him to provide a very good reason why someone shouldnt conclude he has used this for something other than chatting (which is still likely bannable). Failure to do so should be a ban.

mobile gaming proofed that you can make way more money by milking the whales then trying to keep the regular customer base. SC does so as well. It's a sad state
---
It depends where you are trading. In a competitive hub you need to split your stock so you can hit 4 to 5 price points, on high volume stuff you’ll need to adjust prices to combat market volatility. For high margin low volume goods you can just let the market come to you more as cheaper stock is bought out. In both cases the only real factor is working capital, for low margin you need more because you need to be selling more frequently - what matters is return on capital. Let’s say you have 10moercent margin on a blops hull at 100m for a 900m buy price, and it takes u days to sell. You need to make 100m on 1 billion in 7 days to match that RoI, so at a 2 percent margin you are going to make 20 million per billion traded, so need to sell 5 billion of goods in 7 days i.e turn your stock 5 times not invest 5 billion, otherwise you could have sold maybe 5 hulls and made 500m. So the basic calculation is RoI on deployed capital and stock turnover, if you can turnover 1 billion a day at 2 percent then over the 7 days you’ll be 40 million ahead per billion etc. The second consideration is how active you want to be - if you are very active then you can adjust orders wand capture more buy sell opportunities increasing stock turn, if you are passive trading then high RoI over longer periods may be more profitable. There is no magic answer to your question simply because trading is dynamic and involves a lot of other factors like watching BR’s to see when a big fleet got lost and buying up things before prices spike or doing arbitrage to move goods to staging points close to where people might need to restock. Lastly capital plays apart - high volume requires a bigger stock investment and a bigger buying reserve to keep sales flowing to accumulate income. The only way to really do well is keep a spreadsheet and monitor stock turnover, margin and RoI to work out the optimal capital efficiency based on your trading strategy.

&gt; Given the level of plex prices in-game
---
... CCP should be concerned if it was a good idea to encourage a meta where subbing pve-multibox-accounts with the printed ISK via PLEX is heavily favoured while players that just liked to PvP and sold PLEX ingame for ISK got kicked in the balls frequently ...
---
Capri, you have no idea what you're talking about. I wasn't in Praise Bob when the HIC issue went through. I didn't join that discord until the HK eviction. You are flat out lying here.
---
The porpoise proposal was something that was suggested to me by an HK member, which I floated at his request as a way to deal with the HIC changes if CCP didn't fix it.  That was me doing my job - taking a WH idea and presenting it to see if there would be public support. There wasn't, and it was shitcanned. 
---
I never, not once said anything remotely close to "well you live in wormhole space, it should take effort to roll holes." From the beginning, even at the summit, I made clear that if they were going to change the 500 MN HIC bug there needed to be a fix for WHs.
---
The bottom line is that there needed to be a fix, but it had to be balanced. Leaving a broken mechanic in the game that hurts one group because it benefits another is bad for the game in general. The fact that Noob was able to block this instead of getting an actual solution is not a good thing. It was him putting his playstyle ahead of somebody else's. 
---
I don't have a problem with you guys questioning my knowledge and skills - that's politics. But I'll be damned to watch you guys lie and rewrite history to turn me into some kind of boogeyman. 
---
Pretty sure you are allowed to use it to adjust your ui  windows etc.
---
Did you really have to put that idea out into the universe! Damn it, man, CCP read this subred!
---
If "did nothing until CasinoBux convinced them otherwise" excludes someone from that list, then the list of True Scotsman aggressors is... MOA?
---
Of course it comes down to how easy it is to vote.
---
If you have 1 person with 50 accounts then it requires effort currently to log in all them accounts and do it. Most people won't bother their arse to do it and then there is the few who will use 100 accounts and do it for ISK. 
---
Make it easy for people to do it in game and you will have more people doing it.
---
No you don't need to be informed to vote but it does help if you actually give a damn about things to do so, same goes for RL voting  ;) 
---
Agreed, but I think the equilibrium price is somewhere much lower than 1.7b ISK per old Plex given how cheap stuff is.
---
At current levels it is only £100 to buy a super hull for example.
---
they like to ban users who do it havent been caught yet but its a risk.
---
I think you nailed it to a certain extent, but I wouldn't go as far to as to say the CSM is fine. 
---
I feel like people would be more satisfied if they had the opportunity to communicate the things they feel are most important. 
---
True story: I just think it was the better name, and it represents some of the resentment for CCP's actions during that time.
---
The triggering is a cherry on top, though.
---
i like mining, its relaxing and i get to talk to people, and in the end of the day i can press print on another carrier and be proud of myself 
---
Chinese servers shut down or had some weird restructuring crap going on so a bunch of asian players switched to TQ, nothing new...
---
same as now, but scaled down (almost no rorqs(if they existed at all at that point), way less less ratting carriers, and exp no ratting supers/titans) mining battleships was a thing for actual people, not bots 
---
Going by ship numbers looks like test and friends lost in efficiency tbh 
---
"Local is bit better"
---
CCP decides to keep current chat system because someone said in one comment that local is "better" RIP...
---
I thought TEST was a goon Sig?
---
You mean it's not?
---
I only find it funny you guys call it the casino war because goons actually tried to make their own casino and simply failed, the alternatives were more popular. They don't have a moral high ground to stand on.
---
CCP restriction is 1 per account, so I took that rule XD
---
Elite dangerous has almost no crime and punishment at all. The grid around a station is approximate high sec, everything everywhere else in populated space is less safe than lowsec. 
---
what have i done ...............
---
That's not the case here though. Alphas can't cloak, and this guy's whole thing is cloaky camping.
---
What are the odds (don't be too specific) of finding a wormhole which leads tot null sec? Last week I tried low sec for the first time and on my way to low sec and in low sec I scanned down about 15 wormholes. All of them led to unknown parts of space (w-space, right?), Not a single one to high, low or null sec. Is that's normal?
---
Next week maybe

Technically you can go fuck yourself too, but you won't right? So here we are with butthurt goons whining about someone who supposedly used input broadcasting against the EULA to camp a bunch of system, while they have their entire industry based on that...
---
The chinese invasion
---
they did say they would check and see until the end of January, so who knows what they would take as actual proof of it working/not working.
---
more like police botting incoming
---
Ok here goes since you've posted 4 times now on it's who to vote for......
---
For anyone who is actually interested in the meta of eve and whats happening then they will generally be informed from watching Twitch, youtube, reddit, forums etc and that brings out an easy 5 people off the top of my head who you would most likely vote for in a CSM balot but for the rest who more than likely don't care will either random vote or block vote just because.
---
The crux of it involves how easy it is to do it for most. Alliances generally put out a huge Mail on who to vote for and how to do it but even then if you have say 3-5 accounts which I think is average for the more serious eve player then it's "effort" to go do it 5 times, seems trivial but human nature and all. I generally only do it with my oldest account but then again I don't give a shit about the CSM. If I thought that the CSM made any difference and who I voted for actually mattered then I would log in every account to do so even though it would probably take the best part of an hour to do so.
---
pretty much
---
But how often are you adjusting UI? Sure, he has a ton of campers, but he also has his droppers as well, and this behavior is indicative someone who is violating the rules against input broadcasting to combat characters.
---
who gives a fuck, I'm not the one claiming to be a once great alliance and being completely wrong about what happened. proud member of p3ak for almost 3 years btw.
---
The answer is no. You just block everyone who disagrees with you.
---
Covi is best , bitch to micromanage tho as the hold is tiny and you have to dump your ore in a rorq every 2 minutes 
---
we have mindless sheep willing to pay money for ingame skins no matter what... we got a critical mass of idiots already the future of this game, or more precisely it's demise is most likely now in the hands of those "skin addicts"... and they would rather have a shinier looking space dildo to spin in their hangar than actual quality game...
---
&gt; The porpoise proposal was something that was suggested to me by an HK member
---
Who exactly? Because I can't remember a single person in HK thinking it was a good idea.
---
&gt; I never, not once said anything remotely close to "well you live in wormhole space, it should take effort to roll holes." From the beginning, even at the summit, I made clear that if they were going to change the 500 MN HIC bug there needed to be a fix for WHs.
---
I really can't be arsed trawling through logs right now but you absolutely did.
---
&gt; The bottom line is that there needed to be a fix, but it had to be balanced. Leaving a broken mechanic in the game that hurts one group because it benefits another is bad for the game in general.
---
Again here we go with the false dichotomy. It wasn't "leave lurch hics fucked or fuck over w-space". We have a solution now that both sides are completely happy with. Your average w-space player didn't like lurch hics anymore than your average null player.
---
&gt; The fact that Noob was able to block this instead of getting an actual solution is not a good thing. It was him putting his playstyle ahead of somebody else's.
---
Noob didn't block it, he explained to CCP what the priorities were from a w-space perspective (which were basically "I don't care as long as I can go through a hole with &lt;0.1m mass") and suggested they could be achieved by either splitting it into a new module or possibly just stopping you from activating a prop mod/MWD with the bubble up. CCP went "hmmm that sounds like more work than we can put into right now" and left it for about a year.
---
Also, again, false dichotomy, there were solutions everyone would have been happy with.
---
So you believe that he is not using it on his droppers? I have a some Oceanfront Property in Arizona to sell you.
---
I hope they do. 
---
G2A stuff is generally resold codes bought using stolen credit cards. The codes will probably work, but they don't get legit codes from CCPs distributors.
---
As I said, different playstyles and narrow points of view. I wouldn't want tournament winners only.
---

See, under these proposed mechanics, I could waste your ass for that comment. :)

“When you forget that people can shoot back at you outside of high school”
---
I basically got the same response from him when I tried to say the ECM changes made the falcon and widow completely useless 
---
His response was basically "well just bring more then" 
---
I'm not going to make assumptions on how he, specifically, is using it.
---
Just noting that there are legitimate use cases for it that do not break the rules.
---
The idea is that you enter a wormhole from nullsec and scan down all the other wormhole connections in that wormhole. One of them might be a hisec connection. There may also be a route to another wormhole that has a hisec connection.
---
There are wormhole databases that can tell you if there's a guaranteed wormhole connection to hi-sec (called a hisec static). Its been a few years since I dabbled in wormholes, so I'm not sure what the best database is nowadays. Just copy/paste the wormhole system name into the database and it spits out the type of wormhole and what the statics are.
---
If you're unfamiliar with wormholes, grab a cheap ship with probes and a cloak, hop into an empty clone, then dive in and look around. See where the wormhole chain takes you.
---
This has been done and even with the representatives telling CCP how retarded the rorqual changes were they still went and done it anyway. So it doesn't give me any hope.
---

Ah, that makes sense. Thanks
---
Now, I'm not trying to defend the guy, but I am curious what using input broadcasting on his droppers would be useful for. It's not like bombers or something where he's flying them all at once.
---
&gt;BECAUSE GOONS SUPPOSEDLY DO IT IT IS FINE FOR HIM TO DO IT

Ain't that a beautiful piece of logic

To be fair, Poco's don't effect an entire system's bounties.

You also can't steal tags from one and if you destroy a Poco, there are no drops/rewards for your time.

---
Low class wormhole corp with loot buyback. But would mean WH explo instead of Null.
---
i wouldn't worry too much; once you have the itch ... it's literally incurable. 
---
I would likely do the same thing as last year and Ctrl F wormhole corps and drag them in random order, the thing is the standard of releasing a ballot, is something almost exclusive to null sec alliances and well it's clever for them to do so because it reduces the voting barrier ( because now loyal newbro can vote without thinking ). 
---
The problem is that this structure would not be easy to replicate outside of null sec, it's not about my specifically, it's more about in general, like if it loses 10% of people how would otherwise vote that compounds on the already existing numerical advantage. 
---
It also increase the effort for people that have to press truth in order to vote, so even with a equal distribution of laziness null still have a massive advantage on TOP of there numerical advantage, and the more you look at it the more it should shock nobody that well NS dominates the CSM, the problem is that this domination is getting push at this point where there is virtual no room for non-NS space.

---
I mean the effect planet wide PI ;). 
---
I don't think the bounties will lead to this massive defensive effort but more to big alliances having a afk super on it, and small entities accepting the RFs, and just ratting more. 
---
The issue i still have is despite being frustrating for the defender, there is almost no incentive for the First RF especially if you don't plan to come back, so it feels like a mechanic that will be under utilized. 
---
Where does it say "inject" ... all i can see is purchase oO
---
I personally run the sites in an astero or Helios and hack the clsosest can with my analyser 2, while cargo scanning the rest and then rush to the one with the best loot immediatly after I loot the first can, I've had them spawn directly after the first can before, and I've had them spawn mid 2nd can before. I don't think I've ever failed a hack entirely though lol

nah we already had WW2: WWREEEE so we get WWB3(3) out of this one

---
Was reffering to mass input broadcasting to login many alpha accounts at once.
---
You can log in an alpha at the same time as any other account, so with input broadcasting you can do numerous alphas bypassing the restriction 
---
More like no content exists in provi 3/4 of the time. No content no point in having droppers there.

---
This is true.  Was fucking around with a SFI when a proteus decloaked and scrammed me.  A few seconds later, another decloaked and scrammed him.  I shot once at both then bailed while they fought. 
---
The countdown starts when any player ship appears on grid cloaked or not. I know this because I tried to cloaky camp one once and the rats showed up, I was up at a perch. 
---
Also the timer seems to be randomized sometimes they come very quick, but they never come faster than being able to cargo scan a few and hacking 1. You need to know which loot and in what quantity is worth good isk. Always warp at 0 you’ll land basically in the middle of them. Cargo scan and Hack one and get out, don’t even bother equipping a cloak if you can refit close by. 
---
Something Awful is one corp (GoonWaffe) that’s basically dead. GSF is mostly filled with what they’d historically call “pubbie trash” they recruited from reddit and the rest of the game.

INIT has always been “pubbie trash” and has always been desperate for whatever the forum of the month is to validate them 
---
ah okay ty
---
You can't punish the NS ones because they can get their shit together and actually get people to vote.
---
The fact that no WH folk got selected is infact a failing of the WH community who couldn't get their shit together. Nothing stopped them talking to each other and putting forth a few candidates and vote brigading them through (which by the numbers in WH there should be zero problem doing) but the tribal nature of WH is i'm guessing the downfall of them voting for someone together and the fact that the last WH guy got kicked from it.
---
Timer starts when any player ship appears on grid, I tried cloaking camping one at a perch and the rats still showed up and I never decloaked. 
---
What if, and this is a radical idea so brace yourself, we put a gate from Stain going to lowsec? 
---
How so?
---
I wouldn’t lol
---
Yeah, basically it was when you’re an newbie and want to move out to more dangerous space, stain is a great option. You don’t need to worry about sov or anchoring and keeping citadels, you get npc missions that are far more valuable than lowsec or highsec, you have exploring in Sansha space, one of the single best way for newbie ISK. On top of all of this, you are relatively close to the sov null blocks, so you can take quick roams out to harass the blue donut. The big issue is that stain can’t be accessed by anyone from lowsec without either a jump freighter, or wormhole scouting. This is a huge nerf to the entire area, and makes the entire region almost entirely useless. That’s why there should be a gate from stain to lowsec, to make it easier for newbie logistics, so they have incentive to move out there and make null a little more interesting.

&gt; "I really can't be arsed trawling through logs right now but you absolutely did." 
---
No, I didn't. In fact, this was the first public comment I made about the 500 mn HIC issue, and it was in the october release thread: "I know this is an issue for wormholers and I noted it was going to be an issue for wormholers. I am going to advocate for a fix for this - some kind of dedicated hole rolling ship or something similar - but the fact is that 500mn HICs were broken and they weren’t working the way they were supposed to be working - they were adapted for rolling because of how broken they were. This was a “bug became a feature” kind of thing, but the bug is still a bug and causes other problems elsewhere. It needed to be addressed."
---
That was the tone I took from the beginning.  I was actively advocating for you guys while Aryth and Killahbee were saying "fuck all wormholes."  And yet  I'm the one you guys shit on. For trying to help.
---
&gt; Again here we go with the false dichotomy. It wasn't "leave lurch hics fucked or fuck over w-space". We have a solution now that both sides are completely happy with. Your average w-space player didn't like lurch hics anymore than your average null player.
---
It's not a false dichotomy. You are claiming that Noob did a better job by getting them not to touch HICs in the first place and that left a broken mechanic in the game, because it benefited him and his playstyle. What this CSM was able to do was to get both the issue addressed AND the WH issue taken care of. I was advocating internally for an entire week to get Rise to fix this. Ask any of the other CSMs, and they will tell you I was the primary one advocating to get this fixed before the release went out. And we got it done in a week. We have that solution because I helped push for it, and Rise agreed that it needed to be addressed. 
---
There is no way for you to know what Noob said and the minutes don't indicate that he said anything in CSM 12 when Jin/Suit brought up the 500mn HIC Bug. So where are you getting all that you're claiming he said? 
---
Stop making shit up. 
---
it's also possible someone else started the timer before you got there. afaik sites have timers they despawn on if left un run as well.
---
finally, i dont have to DST a titan book
---
Amazing idea - i wonder why no one from CCP came with it yet.        
---
Truly best ideas come from players playing the game. 
---
If people want to leave a singe undefended capital in a cyno jammed beacon/ESS, there are plenty of subcap comps that can dispatch a single super pretty easily.
---
All the attackers need to do is bubble the path for fax reinforcements and then its a dead super.
---
Depends on how quickly you can RF. If its 5-10min, it would be pretty short and if you live nearby, would make it worth coming back. If you're fully roaming and out of the way, then just steal from it and don't worry about it. Or RF it if people annoy you and its always possible another roaming gang may come across it when it exits RF. Or you during a roam come across one already in its 2nd RF which opens up the possibility for you to kill it and take the tags.
---
this is a good change

---
I would advise against doing this unless you have a lot of ISK to burn.
---
No Vacancies, Lazerhawks, Out of Focus, Mouth Trumpet Calvary, etc are all good w-space groups that I've come across.  Fight like hell too.
---
Did you not have d-scan up?
---
Broadcasting is near-useless for cloaky camping and hot dropping.
---
Trust me, I've done my fair share of that (when isboxer wasn't explicitly banned)
---
Keep in mind, that Eve is not balanced around 1 vs. 1 or similiar "fair" fights. If they introduce arenas with rules enforced by game mechanics, I'm afraid players will soon find one superior build, these fights become boring and the whole invetion fails. There's a reason why the alliance tournament rules change a bit every season.
---
There was a group "Hek Fight Club" or something like that, they held sportsmen fighting events in LS near Hek. I don't know if they are still active / when the next event will be. That's the way to go, imho. Events hosted by player groups, not waiting for CCP.

---
&gt; Noone ever bothered wardeccing actual newbies in their cruisers. The 50m fee made that a fool's endeavour.

So It's just not worth to even try going for 2 hacks, go for one and GTFO?

---
You can as long as you stay 32km away from the timer beacon.
---
There are no large isk faucets in highsec, except maybe incursions and abyssal sites since they no longer cause you to go suspect.
---
Ive long said the game needs to incentivize membership in highsec. Maybe move some of those isk faucet activities to require membership in a structure-owning corp, which allows newbros to operate in safety for a bit but then open themselves up to pvp to get access to more content.
---
I always thought that something like this would be a great role for covops/blops ships. Allow them to act as hunters of cloaky ships. The covops could launch bombs in a shortish range (100km) around them that would decloak a ship on hit (say 20km decloak radius?). The blops would have much greater range and decloak radius reaching out to most of the grid.
---
You'd think EVE consisted of 80% Somalians then judging by how vocal they are here on reddit.

Input broadcasting in any form is against the TOS. Is boxer in certain forms is not. 
---
A while ago I thought an interesting idea was activating cloak would stop capacitor regen, and you'd deplete it slowly. One way to be cloaked longer was cap batteries. 
---
In a way, it meant you couldn't just hit cloak and wander off. You'd need to periodically decloak to build cap back up, exposing your position to enemies for short periods.
---
No thought on scale/how quickly, just an old idea.
---
Good point and good insight. Much appreciated.
---
Yea that’s true, it’s possible they cloaked as I was coming in. But I just remember being surprised watching the cans blow up as I was 150 off and cloaked. 
---
ah just said this myself, good idea ;P
---
Can't fly anything else to keep focus on krabbing?
---
Nah. I block toxicity and insults. You can't give me an example where I blocked someone without toxicity and insults.

Seems like nonsense.  Why would GOTG have any interest in that and Gobbins seems to lack the self-awareness necessary to actually start trying to mend the bridges he torched.

What're they at now - 60 Titans?  70?  Sounds like a newbie group to me.

I'm not saying it's not working. I'm just saying it's nothing to brag about.

If there's no isk faucet past getting noobs running, I see no issue
---
Good small change. Now let's hope it won't be bugged lol.
---
How dare they strategically burn enemy assets in another region!  This isn't what was promised!  How dare my enemies not do what I want!

Jizzed my pants - amazing ccp
---
nah.
---
no.
---
They stay fitted. If you board a ship with modules you can't use those will auto-offline.
---
Then link where the devs or GMs have explicitly said input broadcasting is allowed. 
---
Well you can def go for more or all the hacks, depending on skill and fit but in my experience there are cans that can have 500 mil in loot, some only 30 mil so I don’t mind leaving those behind. But point is you can do them in a t1 with only the chance of losing a very cheap ship. So  try it out. 
---
Thanks guys.

&gt;Input broadcasting in any form is against the TOS.

But it isn't.  Here's a list of allowed uses of input broadcasting:

Don't tie it to grid, make it 500km radius from ESS. Similar basic effect, less abuse potential. Now you need 2 ships for a cyno trap.
---
They remain fitted and modules will remain online if you don't board the ship. If you board a ship that you can fly as an alpha and it has modules that you cannot use, those modules will go offline. Rigs don't require skills to fit or use, so they will remain unaffected. Do note that as an alpha, you'll get larger penalties from rigs as your rigging  skills are capped at a lower level than what you may have trained as an omega. You cannot board ships that you don't have the skills to fly so they will remain as is in your hangar.

With current iHub mechanics.  If we're already at the point of changing something (this ESS proposal) then iHubs can be changed too.
---
And destruction of an iHub is far more devastating to the local ratters than cutting bounties by only 25%.
---
Client settings are lol not affecting other players. Positions of windows are outside of the client as well is the login process. Glad to see you already complaining.

You usually aim to find a low-class wormhole with a HiSec static. [C2s](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=c2&amp;staticdest=&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_unfiltered) make this easy by having a 2nd static leading to another wh.

Oh sorry I don’t have any bigger ships to fly, I guess it isn’t good enough for you.  
---
Cloaky camping = old wardec system. It disincentivises undocking. Thats it. It does not mean that cloaking is inherently evil (just as wardecs aren't) but again its better to stay docked in you structure instead of fighting an asymmetric war against cloaky campers. 
---
Reavers and Black Ops  were deployed to ROIR for 6 montht at least before SV deployed. Init was our brother in battle up to then.

Superior Ghost site (wormholes): 12000 damage

Improved Ghost site (nullsec): 10000 damage

Standard Ghost site (lowsec): 8000 damage

Lesser Ghost site (highsec): 6000 damage

Is this item a one time use? I used one and now when I go to the market to buy another it says expired. It won't let me consume anymore.
---
the very first time i worked up the courage to try one in my helios i warped in, decloaked, burned to a can, made sure i was stopped and started the hack and then the whole thing exploded. i can only imagine that someone tripped it before i got there. i now have the npcs on my hacking overview so i can know when they show up.
---
Which is why i bought a stratios and put an 1600mm plate on it.
---
Don't return to the same, what are you crazy?
---
Is init goons or not?  I can never tell with you guys with your changing narrative. 
---
Literally impossible to prove a negative. No way for him to prove he didn't do something. 
---
There is a theme of reluctance that pervades this game. Reluctance to let go of the 'newbie' card. In a game where everything you care about can be destroyed and you have only yourself to blame, it's one of the few lifelines that people try to cling to.  
---
From carebears who mine in highsec for a decade and still consider themselves "new" because they have never PvP'ed, to those who take a break and then describe themselves as "new returning players", to even established groups of nullsec warriors like Horde who raise the newbie card each time they suffer a defeat or setback. They all paper themselves with a veneer of 'newness' in an attempt to protect themselves from harsh realities of society.
---
And I believe it's shameful that they are willing to demean themselves in such a way. We are all immortal capsuleers, and we must be personally responsible for all of our actions and inactions. Only then can we be proud of ourselves.
---
So, I've been able to see what this new animation is about on a ice rock : when the ice rock get emptied by the last mining cycle, the roid disappear with a blue-ish cloud that appear as the same time the rock melt and then disappear, the animation last around 2-3 seconds, very nice. Nothing change before that.
---
best update in a long time
---
&gt; especially when some implementations only appear to benefit one particular aspect of the game. 
---
You mean like hisec wardec mechanics?
---
The point of the thread is that it doesn't really matter who is on the CSM. CCP is going to do what CCP does.
---
The CSM is there so they (CCP) can disclaimer, "....but the CSM was informed, so this makes our stupid change OK".
---
The real winners that benefited the most from WWB were Goons, Test and Brave (and SNUFF to a lesser extent), change my mind...
---
12k explosive damage max: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites#Explosion

I'm whaling right now.

I mean, odds are if half the game hates him the other half doesn’t. I think Sort Dragon is probably the only recognizable name that isn’t liked by either goons/test or panfam
---
Are you an expert?
---
&gt;Along with the fact that a good chunk of them are utterly retarded makes it so much more than just a PR/definition problem.
---
Elected officials in any aspect are more often than not retarded. But they were elected, and usually the "retarded" comments come from people who voted for the guy(s) that lost.
---
Heh… this wasn't in the patch notes, was it? 
---
There's strings for remote purchasing skills.  Don't see anything about injecting those skills.
---
Moon, you were on enough fleets with me to know this isn't true. I'm sorry you left INIT and I'm sorry it was on bad terms, but there's no hard feelings on my side. 
---
I like how you didn't even bother to try locking the sabres.
---
holy fuck this is awesome
---
it does make a difference but not in a positive way, it just allows the largest coalitions to collude with ccp and influence the game changes that they want, not that would be best for the game.
---
the fighter uno is new to me, but the fa-14 is a gm only testing fighter/drone

&gt; Until I've got too bored with hadrcore late night mining

If you want to make an impact on todays EVE, you have to do this, with at least 10 Accounts ....
---
Finally a good fucking meal 
---
thx for Info
---
Damn had my vote until you had to bring WHBOO butt hurt into it. 
---
Not PGL...
---
Is anyone gonna post the changes?
---
In game voting system.
---
Candidates create a preference ticket. If a voter chooses that candidate #1 the preferences are used in order for any unfilled lower slots. ie Voter may select 1,2,3 but leave the rest blank. 1's preferences are used to fill in 4+.
---
All Omega accounts may vote.
---
Allow Corp CEO to proxy vote for their members who didn't vote.
---
Allow Alliance Executors to proxy vote for the Corps whose CEO didn't vote.
---
All Proxy votes are identical to CEO's own vote.  ie he only has to do it once.
---
************************************
---
the assumption here is that Candidates and CEO's are invested enough in the game and the election process to do some research on the best candidates that the average line member may not.
---
Isboxer isn't explicitly banned
---
Thats the thing, you think everyone disagreeing with you is toxic.
---
No, rules are the same for everyone.
---
I can prove it. He literally chatted in multiple systems at the same time. Others have been banned for the exact same thing.
---
Perfectly awesome dope! CCP sure knows how to rub the thing during make-up sex.
---
Predictions on whether this will make the probe window even more unusable in big tidi fights?
---
You don't need to be an expert. 
---
Every time I see the claim that the CSM needs to be full of experts, it makes me just shake my head - it's the clearest sign that the person making the statement doesn't understand the CSM or it's role.
---
We aren't game developers. Being an "expert" doesn't really help. And being an expert in one area of the game generally means you focus only on that and you don't have a broader base of knowledge.  While there's room for experts, there is also room for generalists who have other skills.  I bring a lot of skills and expertise to the table in areas that are secondary to my EVE knowledge (and regardless of what folks say, I've been playing for 13 years so I'm not some random noob) that are still very important for us to be credible and effective. 
---
Luckily for us he quit years ago and won't come back until the big meanie Falcon leaves CCP.
---
still not that many
---
Yeah, hunter or hunted, anything that makes scanning in general more responsive and easy to use gets a thumbs up from me!
---
For realsies things involve moving the shield supers and titans.
---
The shield supers and titans aren't in the North.
---
If this guy was in goons, everyone defending him would be calling for his head on a platter, but because he camps goons, it should be swept under the rug. 
---
This subreddit is worse than US politics lol.
---
He got caught, so there is no reason for us to assume hes not guilty.
---
Selective enforcement best explains the situation.
---
That's because they had a shortage of self sealing stem bolts at the time.
---
#Praise Bob
---
Still no example.

Elephant Race 2 when :D

spoopy newbies corp is recruiting! pm me for details

I support this product and/or service and now wish I'd voted for them instead of Signal Cartel in that other thread.  Mistakes were made, sorry.
---
How about the more interesting stats?
---
* Contracts Lost
---
* Freighters Lost
---
* Jump Freighters Lost
---
* Total Volume Lost
---
* Total Collateral Lost
---
I'd love to see how hard people gank pushx
---
I have yet to find one of this sites... Not sure really if my skills will allow me to be greedy and go for more than on lol
---
In any case, I now have a reason to actually have a cargo scanner in my exploration fits.
---
Violence is the Answer! We're pretty active, and a lot of fun. Just last night we were hunting a ratting Barghest, lost him to the ol' docking maneuver, but found a fenrir! Killed the fenrir literally 2 seconds before downtime on the gate, log back in after dt, fenrir pilot salty, drops 4 carriers on our dreakavic who dies. Was fun!
---
So he should be banned cause his chat input broadcast proved he has isboxer?
---
Any1 asked to bad silver miner who input broadcasted the character creation?
---
Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are carried out for convenience:
---
obviously neither were actions that have consequences on others
---
Yeah give the people the joocy stats. 
---
&gt; t's the clearest sign that the person making the statement doesn't understand the CSM or it's role.
---
In that case, lots of credible people think you don't understand CSM's role.
---
&gt; We aren't game developers. Being an "expert" doesn't really help. 
---
You are there to give CCP feedback on matters they can't immerse themselves within. You need to be fully immersed to those matters to be helpful.
---
&gt; And being an expert in one area of the game generally means you focus only on that and you don't have a broader base of knowledge.
---
 
---
No, it doesn't mean that. We put forward being an expert as a necessary condition for a good CSM. It doesn't mean it's a sufficient condition. There are lots of experts in this game who also know a lot of things about other playstyles.
---
&gt; I bring a lot of skills and expertise to the table in areas that are secondary to my EVE knowledge (and regardless of what folks say, I've been playing for 13 years so I'm not some random noob) that are still very important for us to be credible and effective.
---
I am not saying a non-expert can't help CCP in any matter. So the non-expert feeling like he's helping, and there being instances where the non-expert is actually helpful, is plausible with what I am saying. But the non-expert also can't offer help to CCP in many matters, and often times the most important ones, or matters of conflict. I agree with capri on that much is also deducible from the minutes.
---
earth is flat, it just fell on some kind of sphere and enveloped it
---
Down voted because true - reddit. :D
---
&gt; You do realize space exists that isn't delve right? Large swaths of space that are just bots or less organized entities live where this will have a large use.
---
So the purpose is to drive even more players to the goons? Many nullsec regions are only populated in one timezone, their shit would be reinforced daily. And even if they are online, they can't really defend, because every other "roaming gang" would actually just be bait for a large fleet waiting for a bridge.
---
If someone doesn't want to fight you, you cannot make them provide "fun fights" for you. Get over it. They are either strong enough to drop a super for each of your subcaps, or they'll dock up. If docking up is not an option any more, you can force them to leave (to the goons, to HS or the game completely).
---
&gt;we don't really care about the holding space element of it. 
---
Could definitely be interpreted as "didn't want that space anyway".
---
I get what you were trying to say, but I also could see how someone saw a meme in that.
---
I'm not justifying him, however lets face the truth, even if CCP bans him they wont lift a finger against the plethora of input broadcasters in Imperium space because that would kill off like a quarter of the population and that's lost profits.
---
Inside coalition yes...
---
We'll see how much resetting they do when NC. need another batphone. 
---
Sure you can.
---
Cloaks now require 1 ozone per minute.  Done.  Not a huge change, but it does make those 40 account *camp a whole region for months* thing a little more difficult.
---
Thank you CCP this is a nice change
---
WTS CSM seats. 40 bill per seat/term. Xenurias not welcome.
---
&gt;they wont lift a finger against the plethora of input broadcasters in Imperium space
---
Except they have banned any and all that have been caught so far.
---
Caught as in lighting dozen cynos at the same second, not "Nobody can fly x amount y without broadcasting!"
---
If only you guys put that much effort into attacking Goons...
---
Wow this is some thread necromancy, hah. 
---
The discussion was about starting a corp, whereas I think your points apply more to corps that are up and running already. I argue that trying to build a corp by cold calling a bunch of strangers in hisec is a bad idea, which it is. You should get the ball rolling with friends and people you have attracted through your leadership elsewhere, and then you can recruit people you don't know once you have the core of the corp assembled. 
---
Looks like you can only declare or be declared on if your corp or another corp in your alliance owns at least one structure in space. Seems pretty fair to me. If your corp is rich enough to have a structure it's rich enough to supply some combat ships for people to pew in.
---
It was 352 vs 318, https://scans.minusten.net/l/M84reaRy
---
WOW... thank karkur
---
Clearly, the only solution to holding the Council of Stellar Management accountable is to elect players representatives to a Council of Stellar Management Management Council
---
ur mittanibux are in the mail
---
ya ur right only 90k
---
While trash talking up a storm in another thread, I'll add ;-)
---
Leaving provi was the best thing I ever did. They're a bunch of autistic role-players devoted to nearly useless space that they simply don't have the ability to properly defend, so it's just a never ending game of timers. Now I'm out in Delve making real isk and not being berated by half drunk FCs for not having a third dread alt.
---
Is this even a question? ofc it will, probably wont be usable even in low populated systems when there are more than 10 signatures there.
---
Nice, can just have a character sitting in a school station now
---
Yeah lets just strip down the whole game so TiDi fights can be 0.1% faster. right?
---
But that was the entire point of this deployment. Using PGL's words from the TEST forums "We want to take Carriers and dreads to learn how to fight and escalate under a hostile supercapital umbrealla". 
---
"The PR project has a PR problem, other than that it's fine"
---
same here: dont see it either. anybody can give pointers to what OP claims to see?
---
yeah i dont see/read that either. where does it say/imply "inject skills remotely"?
---
"fighting test is haram"
---
\&gt; ur brain on dino
---
&gt; In that case, lots of credible people think you don't understand CSM's role. Before you say anything, let me add that it's entirely possible that you are on CSM and still don't get why you are there. It's entirely possible even CCP doesn't know the best way to utilize a system like CSM to help Eve.
---
Got it - everybody who has actually done this and the folks who created it for the benefit don't understand the point of what they're doing.  You, on the other hand, fully understand it.
---
And people call me arrogant. Sheesh.
---
&gt; You are there to give CCP feedback on matters they can't immerse themselves within. You need to be fully immersed to those matters to be fully helpful.
---
That is one small facet of the overall role, and so far I've seen maybe one example of where being totally immersed in something would have been beneficial and that was a third-party application/ESI discussion that only Steve understood.
---
&gt; No, it doesn't mean that. We put forward being an expert as a necessary condition for a good CSM. It doesn't mean it's a sufficient condition. There are lots of experts in this game who also know a lot of things about other playstyles.
---
And there are a lot of those experts who would make horrible CSM members, because they understand their area of expertise but can't see or don't care about other parts and how they're connected. There is room for generalists, especially generalists with social skills. 
---
&gt; But the non-expert also can't offer help to CCP in many matters, and often times the most important ones, or matters of conflict between different playstyles. I agree with capri on that much is also deducible from the minutes.
---
Most of what Capri said is wrong, and I wish he'd actually gotten elected so he could see from the inside that his perception is incorrect. Unfortunately, not every expert is expert enough in campaigning to get elected. 
---
Lol
---
that scan would seem to indicate 
---
613 v 318
---
Basically, wars can now only be declared against a corporation or alliance that deploys a structure. It’s given corps (like mine) a great opportunity to build up and enjoy playing together.
---
i see that you are limited. lemme try to paint it for u.
---
rules wasnt broken, connecting from other places is not bannable according to elua
---
&gt;You can't punish the NS ones because they can get their shit together and actually get people to vote.
---
It's not about punishing a group it's about getting good representation and a quality game. 
---
&gt; The fact that no WH folk got selected is infact a failing of the WH community who couldn't get their shit together. 
---
No it's a numerical issue, let me explain again the csm had a total of 29226 votes. 
---
Let's look at a breakdown first round, Aryth had 6644 of these votes that means, out of 35343 about 18% characters 
---
Now that means you would need 6061 to get the 1091 votes ExookiZ got in the first round. 
---
That's the top 6 wormhole alliances by members voting for ExookiZ and here is the thing he still didn't make it. 
---
What your literally asking is for a less organized group of people to have a better participation rate then 1 of the most organized alliances in the game.
---
The reason wormholes had a CSM in the past is ironically because some null blocs would have him on there ballot, without it there is literally no point running based on wormhole space.
---
That's my KM!! LOL! I made it to Reddit, I won EVE ;)
---
The problem here is I forgot about the rats (yeah!). I knew I could tank the explosion, but the rats did shoot me and killed me before the explosion.  
---
Also, the timer was really short. I quickly hacked two cans and was warping out when the rats scrammed me. I was caught by one second.
---
Already replaced, I didn't want that Loki anyway, blah blah bla xDD  
---
You can now only declare war again corporations or alliances that have deployed a structure (which has helped the social aspect of high-sec. a lot).
---
On a sidenote with all the bashing going around. How do you think he can even use input broadcasting in his case? He literally just sits in a bunch of different systems. I guess cloak activation is literally the only thing you can broadcast in this case.
---
Obviously relatively speaking compared to a corp just starting out and unable to fight back. My whole point is that economic performance should dictate if you should ve exposed to being wardecced.
---
Brother they didn't even have respectable SRP when they pocketed 10% tax taken over the last three years. Bear in mind this is an alliance who doesn't deploy or campaign or any of that good shit. They didn't even offer a respectable SRP once they'd secured Perimeter! That's with minimal expenditure on infrastructure by the way, fuel aside. 
---
Let that sink in and raise a glass to Gobbins for a job well done. Surely when Eve is finally shut down, Pandemic Horde will be remembered as the single greatest isk printer in the history of the game.
---
News flash, they can’t forget about you if they never gave a shit about you in the first place.
---
Oh, wow, who ever did this, can you please take a look at the chat code ~~right now~~ when you have some spare time?   
---
Seriously, thank you! (Can we get a name of Dev, asking for a friend?)
---
vOv then hit the important cans and bug out. 
---
We always had 3 friends willing to hack nearby, but we lived in w-space. 
---
On reflection I could see how that could be inferred; it's a good thing we clarified that wasn't the case!
---
No one can wardec a corporation that don't own any structure (pos/poco/citadel)
---
You want people to actually *play* Eve?  Madness!
---
Honestly who cares about the effect on TIDI fights when this change will make day to day gameplay so much more responsive. It was always mega aids to close and reopen probe window every time you warp to get accurate results, especially when hunting.
---
So overall collateral is close to 1 palatine and that from 6k customers...
---
You’d have to ask INIT, we keep getting told different narratives about INIT’s independence.
---
Dude unironically that will be a fun war.
---
Love it &lt;3
---
😘👌
---
You purchase the item and it's injected directly.
---
You had it right. Capri is making things up. 
---
https://evepraisal.com
---
You can cargo scan and Ctrl +A then Ctrl +C the loot and then Ctrl-V into that website, it will tell you the estimated value based on jita prices. 
---
Also I’ve noticed since coming back exploration is extremely saturated, so ghost sites aren’t up for long especially in low sec. 
---
I played 2008-2013 and started a high sec corp for RL friends in 2018. I was recently involved in a war in high sec right before the change, I lost 2 Athanors and a Raitaru. It was a fun fight and I spent probably around the cost of the stations on battleships for my corp, but we lost. They kept the War Dec going for weeks and I was starting to just not log in. Then the changes happened and I could return to building up again. Ownership of something is a great condition for war, I think it should have been like this since the beginning.
---
We don't have interest in that. Thats why Sort told him to get fucked... Sauce, our discord 
---
They went to Querious sometime last year and got shit on by QFC and Goons vOv
---
The one that kills me is corp/alliance management. It is literally **the** most important thing in EVE Online: organizing how players relate to each other. It should be a major structural backbone to the game. And yet, with only a couple of exceptions we're still operating on virtually the original systems developed for the game 10+ years ago.
---
And those systems aren't very good. EVE's corps and alliance should benefit from a security system at least as good as NetWare version 4 from 1993.
---
Thank you good sir!
---
Same as when a booster that allows a fitting expires - it stays fitted by something gets inactivated as needed to make it work.  For power, it randomly turns stuff off, for lack of skill, it turns that module off till it's a "working" fit.  Also, you can't undock if you don't have the basic ship skill anymore.
---
There’s the r/eve we know and love!
---
Even a pure QoL change has to somehow be bad!
---
&gt; least they actually do something
---
You want one example?  I'll give you several.  Nosy Gamer has a great series of posts on highsec distribution mission bots using Alpha characters.  CCP didn't touch them until he posted his first couple blogs.  
---

---
For someone who sucks so bad at EvE you seem to throw around a lot of insults.   
---
We sure do enjoy the salt though. Sprinkle it all over me. 
---
Another way for people to never leave their home system.
---
"Horde the day after they left branch was already asking for help. I simply told them there is more of a chance we come over and shoot them then help them" 
---
This is an absolutely amazing QOL change for everyone from hunters to ratters. 
---
Sure thing mate. I know that fast. but i stopped playn when i realised that. OFC thats one of the reasons ;)
---
So goons join in Kalevala. Goons bring more than TAPI. Horde feeds. TAPI claims epic victory. 
---
Gah, its gonna be THAT kind of invasion. 
---
Now THAT is the right question, which is why I'm not directly calling for a punishment, but an investigation.
---
It's very possible that chatline was the only "illegal" use of it, but it could also be bombers somewhere. (inb4 his rorquals in Delve)
---
Why should people be shameful for enjoying the game their way?   
---
Fuck off with your noob elitism. 
---
Come to nullsec. First guy you find will throw a cyno-interceptor at you and drop a supercarrier on your solo-roaming-whatever. If you can't beat them, join them. Adapt or die. This is EVE. 
---
On question 2, if you are low on remaining orders or are burning out managing too many, increase your batch size. If you have a surplus of available orders and energy maybe decrease it. The longer you hold something, the greater the risk of an adverse shift in the market. On the other hand, time spent micromanaging orders could be spent doing other productive or entertaining things. It is a balance. As I have grown in assets and decreased in available time, my batch sizes have steadily increased.
---
Those new injector boosters and hisec being less cancer to live in probably made some difference
---
&gt; Got it - everybody who has actually done this and the folks who created it for the benefit don't understand the point of what they're doing. You, on the other hand, fully understand it.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; And people call me arrogant. Sheesh.
---
Sorry, but people on the field are in the best position to know whether you (or CCP) are doing your job you are supposed to do in the best way. That's not arrogance. Your stance is more arrogant. It's like a politician saying he is solving problems of the people to the best of a politician can do, when people disagree.
---
&gt; So far I've seen maybe one example
---
Most of our problems begin with what's not being discussed over there. Not with what's being discussed.
---
&gt; And there are a lot of those experts who would make horrible CSM members, because they understand their area of expertise but can't see or don't care about other parts and how they're connected. There is room for generalists, especially generalists with social skills.
---
There are a lot of this and a lot of that. The bottom line is, when there are a lot of experts, with good knowledge in different areas as well, who also have to soft skills, why should people settle with non-experts?.
---
And quite frankly, your "approval ratings" seem kinda low for you to be making your social or soft skills a talking point all the time.
---
&gt; Unfortunately, not every expert is expert enough in campaigning to get elected.
---
Campaigning skills being a prerequisite for a position to give CCP valuable feedback is part of the problem. So what you're saying verifies what I've been saying. 
---
Besides, only 3/10 of all CSMs actually showed a considerable effort to campaign for their position (and the rest is there due to block voting). A kitten dies whenever you praise your campaigning skills from a CSM seat gained via being on the Imperium ticket. You don't even know whether it was your campaigning. For many other people, we definitely know it wasn't their campaigning skills.
---
Campaigning skills is a prerequisite for people unaffiliated with null empires like capri. Doesn't mean you had to have good skills to get on the ticket.
---
&gt;People moving freighters to corporations
---
Please clarify: How does the new war system cause people to move their freighter alts to corporations?
---
Happens all the time, shut up about it. 
---
Lorrrr'have mercy on yo soul!
---
Goons join in Kalevala. Goons field heavier numbers. Horde feeds. TAPI claims elitism. 
---
But please, dont mention the loss numbers outside of horde. I'm pretty sure that PL only lost one t3d....and that was due to a client crash. I think I have 40-50 kills for yesterday's little thing. 
---
Mar5y input broadcast (little to no evidence he uses it in PVP/unfairly) - Weekly posts and massive upvote brigade.   
---
Loads of bots killed and much greater evidence. Falls to the bottom.   
---
Hmmmm 
---
This pretends that the NDA is actually enforceable and honored.  Dubious.
---
Further, the fact that the focus group is predominately made up of large block folks means that large block concerns are being represented, not small block concerns.  It doesn't even have to be reps checking back with the block, they know what is good or bad for their block without checking.
---
How can you look at this and still not believe in god?
---
Yup.
---
Every low tier blob wants to rent out drones.
---
*sigh*
---
Bro shut the fuck up. No one fucking cares. Ya know what's fucking dumb, is that when it's shit like this that  happens there is always one goon making sure to brigade reddit every single day until their agenda is pushed.
---
You guys are the only ones that do this shit, seriously. God forbid I had to see a fucking update that gigx was logged in every single day. It's a fucking video game, move the fuck on already. I don't want to see updates about some guy "asic miners" just as much as I don't want to see updates of your multi boxing rorqs.
---
[MOVE THE FUCK ON](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg)
---
Yes!  Next in line : delayed local in null.  Battleship scan res.  Warp speed buff to all ships.  And medium auto cannons.
---
I see a future where there is a single high-sec structure holding company. All other corps using said structures for a low fee. A dedicated corp for fueling said structures. A dedicated corp for defense of said structures. 
---
Let us make it happen.
---
This needs to be limited to K-Space though, the idea of being able to ping a system for cloakies in WHs seems monumentally against the nature of that area of space.
---
Wow, you seem to have some serious anger issues buddy. You should probably work on that so that you don't look so dumb.
---
we lost count.
---
This place is so fucked. I don't seem to remember it being like this when I won Eve back in 2016 just after WWB...
---
Maybe it was and I was just a bigger fucktard, or maybe it wasn't and it's gotten worse, but why does it feel like this forum is a shitshow of retards and dickheads compared to so many other game forums?
---
They are working on a revision which is available by the beta option in the launcher settings, I don't think you can apply profile settings per client though, probably very little changes will come to the current one as this new will will replace it eventually. 
---
Yeah, especially if you prestige a second frigate nearby, you can actually hack as many as you want, blow up, bookmark wreck, then reship and collect the loot from your wreck. Usually turns a profit.
---
Literally unplayable
---
That corp can no longer be wardeced if it doesn't have structures so it's no longer safer to have your freighters in NPC corps.
---
TEST invaded Geminate on Saturday putting in nine hours worth of work setting up taking Sov. On Sunday they stood down because they couldn't get Goon support to finish the job, so PGL "watched football" instead, wasting the work of the previous day. 
---
Holy shit that’s fucking cool, great wee QOL change.  
---
Still not seeing it... see quick buy text being updated, next to a lot of other UI updates to make other old mechanics similarly.
---
Don't see remote purchase + inject in the same field.
---
This is what kool aid and spod does to an individual.. A sad sight indeed
---
Thanks CCP!
---
Proof or get the fuck out. 
---
World War Bee
---
exactly. thats why its not the only corp
---
&gt;The only corp that manages to have fun without the constant salt and butthurt
---
At first I thought you were being facetious )) 
---
Medium autos, please CCP, P-FUCKING-LEASE. 
---
Warp speed buff to all ships hasn’t one I’ve heard of considered before, I often fly bonused or small shit, but I can see some good implication from it’s implementation. 
---
bittervetbtw
---
\o/ this January release is looking better and better
---
There's a lot of risk in becoming a high profile hauler. Not only do you have to be prepared to replace your ship if it gets ganked, but you also need to be ready to cover the collateral of any contract you fail because you lost your ship.
---
There are a few precautions you can take, and certainly I would suggest steering away from regular freighters (JFs have a modicum more security in that if you are at risk, you can simply jump out to a safe cyno in a nearby lowsec), but again there is a costly barrier to entry with the jF hull, and if you are destitute enough at the outset to be worried about plexing your accounts, it may not be an ideal risk/reward ratio for you.
---
That said, it is another way to play the game, so if it interests you, you can certainly give it a try. Perhaps try moving smaller sized packages from highsec/lowsec in a blockrade runner first? You can set up insta-undock warp bookmarks and cloak up to get around, and don't have to worry about evading bubbles till you are ready.
---
Good luck!
---
SRP has actually already been processed and sent out. 
---
People logging in to get the log in rewards?
---
praise bob
---
Burn *Horde
---
Beware of how you define "newbie friendly." If you expect to be given special treatment and exempted from combat, you will be disappointed. If you expect people to be helpful and not discriminate against you unduly, it's great. One of the nice things about EVE is how you don't need to grind your character to an arbitrary level to be allowed to participate in most activities.
---
sooo goons won the fight for test? without test panfam would have had subcap superiority (like 50-100 of legacy was brave retards in frigates) and probably have been able to escalate with caps

after dscan bugging out, corp chat dying and later even standing settings and fleet invites disappearing comes this overly awesome qol update? wtf ccp trying to give me stockholm syndrome.
---
And I thought Horde was Panfam's meatshield? You mean it's n.......
---
Oh. Nevermind.
---
You need isk to get going, but JFing can be very profitable, especially if, rather than PushX or whoever, you join a medium sized null group. 
---
What log in rewards ?  That's to rewarding that Cant happen in Eve. 13 days of Eve was great though 
---
literally takes 10 seconds to restart it manually
---
There was a way to see top isk-valued killmail per ship, but I forget how to find it. 
---
No it’s on the backs of four elephants, themselves standing on a giant turtle, slowly moving through space, does even the turtle know the destination..?
---
dscan next? Poggers
---
I sometimes just sit and listen to Below the Asteroids and weep for the years I've lost to this game.
---
I don’t know who this guy is, but that statement is correct. 
---
Yeah after I saw that I went back and started watching other eve videos with comms, it’s epic.
---
"resetting" 
---
let us know when your supers aren't staged in M-O anymore
---
Yeah, it is an alt for running wormhole sites, didn’t even have the skill injected. 
---
...
---
That does sound hella fun
---
What is wrong with you? How old are you? Are you sure you're playing the right game? I'm so confused.
---
What is a cap gun dread going to do against a Sabre? Also that wasn’t the only account I was running, I was fighting subs the whole time +5ish minutes after that video ended helping tackled dreads get out.
---
Unless like i posted - in wh space you get constant ghost readings. 
---
What, that you got baited by someone who sprung a trap rather than a fair fight and you think that's mean and not allowed for some reason?...
---
Those are new, we self destructed the old ones.
---
Gotcha, so we should honorably stand up to bigger blobs without bringing in more dudes.
---
I guess we need training in space bushido.
---
Used them once, fast delivery, no issues.
---
Price (reward) scales well on higher collateral deliveries, a bit pricy for low value hauls.
---
Jumped 50 dudes onto 1 dude. Kills dude. Links it like it's a big accomplishment. Outnumbered in home system 10-20 to 1. Loses keepstars. That's not a big deal. #narratives
---
Since that matters.
---
You have a good attitude for this game. I expect great things of you in the coming years.
---
Provi hasn’t rebuilt enough to warrant another invasion. It’s only been a year, need at least another 6 months before it’s worth kicking down.
---
I had a great fit against Grunt Kado, who I have a lot of respect for, and fear due to his often “out there” fits, and how he uses ships many of us in LS don’t see the potential of. Not so much if that in this one, but it still  just went in my favour, great fight, my dude.  I owe him a few more kills still.  
---

For real, like not even spinning:

My take is we won't move them unless Vily comes back from his break, and probably not even then.

We're saving them for you.

Rat in your titan until you have enough isk to buy a new titan 
---
Olmeca, you literally just said that members of the CSM and CCP don't know what the job of the CSM is, but you know better. That's absurdly arrogant. 
---
My approval ratings are just fine. A bunch of salt from a handful of WHers and Hedliner's usual sperge does not mean that the bulk of folks don't think I'm doing my job. Those who are paying attention know that I'm one of the most active and most approachable CSMs out there and that I actually care about the game. 
---
Campaigning skills are important, especially for folks with no big bloc. I won because of my commercial and the effort I put in going on all the shows, putting up a website with actual ideas, listening to people, engaging with the community.  I didn't need any votes from the Imperium ballot to win (I had 1990 votes on the first ballot, and you only needed 1600-something to win), and I wouldn't even have been on the Imperium ballot if I hadn't been campaigning. I was 5th on the Imperium ballot and the Judge was #4 - Judge was the last person elected. Whatever help there was from the Imperium ballot went to him, not me. I know the STV pretty well now, so you can consider that one of the areas of my expertise. 
---
I was a literal nobody from nowhere and I beat a lot of better known guys including some of your issue "experts." Why? Because I campaigned. 
---
Excellent, keep flying your little beauty. 
---
You got schooled bro

Hurrah!

Dude, the proof was pasted here on Reddit over a week ago. He was undocked in space using input broadcasting.

Hey look a thread thats not about MCAV.

Let’s change that real quick. MCAV, we’re gay, fly nano-gang, everyones an FC and we hate face brawling armor on wormholes for hours because it’s about as fun as a citadel bash.

Mouth Trumpet Cavalry [MCAV] (C5 wormhole corp)
---
**Who are we?**
---
Mouth Trumpet Cavalry is a PvP wormhole corporation that is dedicated to taking as many fights as we can. We are a group of tightly knit individuals that enjoy wormhole life and flying nanogang fleets. We take pride in our fast responses, and eagerness to rush into a fight repeatedly. Our philiosophy is that "fights are fun, so lets seek more fights". Manual piloting is an important part of how our fleets operate. If this is an area you are struggling in, we will teach you. We have many veteran pilots that are always sharing knowledge with our newer pilots. We are confident you will improve as a pilot here.
---
We predominantly fly nanogang, this is our first choice when responding to content. We maintain several other doctrines that allow us to deal with situations that would otherwise be unfightable for our nanogang. We stress being prepared so that we can be reshipping quickly, so that we can bring the right tools to hand to take an engagement.
---
Our pilots are very PvP minded. When someone says on coms that a ship is found in the chain, the best recruits are excited have another oppertunity to pvp. Every one of our pilots is driven to get fights and blow things up.
---
Outside of PvP, we have an excellent array of planets for setting up PI in our hole. We also provide the opportunity for players to do industry in the hole as well. As well as the usual suspects of PvE content, like running sites. Many of our pilots do these activities on the side. Affordable and fast logistics are also available for use, allowing our members to order whatever they want and get it promptly delivered in our home hole. We offer SRP in the form of free Logi And certain Alliance funded ships as well.
---
We live in a vanilla c5 with a c5 static.
---
**What do we offer?**
---

I dunno, but I figured if I was gonna go for literally the worst idea ever, I might as well go full retard on it
---
Lol I'm a jaded old bittervet from EVE history that just came back last year, I think I'm past my prime haha.
---
Have you ever found a lowsec WH to stain?
---
Just had a great brawl with Test in and outside of Perimeter. The objective was one of our Azbels that had been reinforced into armor. We had only 29 Ishtars to their 60 something Eagles, so we were initially just going to stand down, but they chased us and we ended up fighting on one of the gates on the way home. Surprisingly, we managed to come out on top, and went to reship in Jita. Test came back and paused the timer, and we came in, fought them for a bit, and again forced them to leave grid. By the time they reshipped it was repaired, and we got a couple more Eagles as they tried to warp off.
---
Was a very fun fight as logi, especially since I was a frigate so no one put ECM drones on me. Enough incoming dps to make things fun, but not to where stuff is dying before I can even start repping it. 
---
That's a dangerous line of conversation to follow because I have scans of the various alliance's capital numbers, and so know who formed what.
---
Suffice to say neither side chose to commit their carriers/dreads, though both did have them formed.
---
Lmao.
---
will try to not be biased...
---
simply sort dragon put a deal with imperium for 40 faction fortizars...for safety during like 6 to 12 months (don't really know duration)
---
Show me any time recently where a botter/input broadcaster has been banned quickly upon being found out and reported. Because I can think of 0 examples. 
---
Um. Ok?
---
Make sure you ping @everyone in your discord 
---
I give it a week and people will still spam their hotkeys for the probe window to refresh.
---
Since what? 
---
palatine have never been an isk problem
---
So like $400 for a titan, when they used to be 4000
---
Let's be real, that's basically a rite of passage in Eve
---
Possibly your finest work to date.    Bravo, Sir... Bravo.   
---
Probe UI 2.0 is already suffering fron low performance. Not big fights but just normal activities. 50~100 results isn't a rare occurance but fps will eat shit no matter how fast your computer is. To counteract this you either use map only or window only, but barely.
---
What a time to be alive
---
The only proof was a chat message, not a video of him lighting 50 cynos at once. 
---
Maybe that's what it took. It gives you perspective.
---
Yeah we have notified the guy who runs it, he's working on it
---
It's *ONLY* the best song ever made for a game.
---
Haha perhaps, thanks for the compliment in any event.
---
~psyops~
---
That would be a pretty big negative change to a lot of players who are not permacamping. 
---
Not a fan.
---
The camper isn’t the problem. It’s the cyno backup fleet that you don’t have a fleet to counter at the moment that’s the problem.
---
I thought we Knew the Judge would never be all Hands on Deck again !
---
If I have JF 5, is doing hauling pretty lucrative? How risky are the low/null sex hauls? 
---
I think even hitting the refresh button will kick start the download as well. 
---
I’m sorry, who?
---
I still have a double interdiction sphere launcher sabre from before the change where they made only enabled at a time, it will never be able to undock until it's refit, but it's a keepsake more than anything now. 
---
That deal was only for GOTG and not for the rest of the North. 
---
Last time I checked Legacy Coalition is the same size as PanFam...
---
This is so true. And tbh fleets with Mar5hy are so much fun.
---
Wut
---
Sounds like they should move it to the could with local chat.
---
Horde is done in Kalevala,they need to go back home to Branch...oh wait
---
&gt; Olmeca, you literally just said that members of the CSM and CCP don't know what the job of the CSM is, but you know better. That's absurdly arrogant.
---
First of all, I'd appreciate if you didn't manipulate things I say into absurd positions and then refute them as if they were my positions. There has been multiple instances now where I had to point out nuances you conveniently ignore. I get that you are a politician and this is what people do to appeal to masses. But I am a philosopher. We care about argumentative prowess, truth, and being right. More than trying to look like we are right.
---
I did not say CSM and CCP didn't know CSM's role. I said that it's possible. In your case, it even looks like the case. I can't speak of many other CSMs or CCP, with whom I had no interaction. The point here is that I don't have to be CSM/CCP to know the best role CSM can take to help the game.
---
Thinking like the above is not arrogant when you think of the fact that we are the one on field having to deal with decisions you make in closed rooms. Criticizing CCP/CSM on their decisions is something players rightly do all the time. That doesn't exclude criticizing them on what they think CSM's role is, or how they think CSM can help to the betterment of the game. We don't have to be CSM for all that.
---
&gt; Campaigning skills are important, ~~especially~~ *only* for folks with no big bloc. 
---
FTFY
---
&gt; I won because of my commercial and the effort I put in going on all the shows, putting up a website with actual ideas, listening to people, engaging with the community.
---
&gt; I was a literal nobody from nowhere and I beat a lot of better known guys including some of your issue "experts." Why? Because I campaigned.
---
You won because of the meme and being part of a nullblock. 
---
Your ideas were not special or enlightened. You specifically campaigned on the premise that you can represent everyone without having your own ideas. We discussed this before when you were campaigning.
---
You did engage with the community and listen. My point was that you'll never know how much that actually helped or how much people actually liked your ideas. You weren't a nobody. You were a mega empire member. All you had to do is convincing your nullblock to put you on top 6 in the block voting ballot. Perhaps you just got on the Goon ticket due to the meme. The meme itself amounts to you shooting a video and being a RL politician, not necessarily stuff that'd indicate your broader campaigning skills. And again, campaigning a skillset which I argue shouldn't even be entirely important to get into CSM.
---
At the end of the day why you got elected is really a side issue to this conversation. All I'm saying is perhaps you shouldn't be so surprised to be called arrogant if you don't see the meme and the block voting could have been the factors that got you into CSM, and not your campaigning skills. 
---
Yes,
---
Send me isks I'll double them 😉
---
CCP has a stack of these types of changes they are just banking for when they screw something up bad enough for long enough. This is their version of the men in Black mind erase flasher thing. All is forgiven, have updating ranges in the probe scanner!
---
No thanks, station content is denied to all but the biggest corps/alliances. 
---
Im not contradicting myself at all... have been saying this since the start
---
seems like the issue is a bit too complicated for you guys and thats why you failed? i dunno
---
No, I would never buy from there when for a few bucks more you get a legit seller.
---
I'm just doing the standard Reddit shitposting. I support ships dying in every way, so I do have to commend one less titan out there.
---
Is the fact that CCP are shit at banning even when they dont deal with their "friends" an indication that they will ban bots that are part of the "protected class"? No.
---
They basically do something when the public shitstorm gets too smelly.
---
Reports do nothing. I know this for a fact.
---
Bookmarks are still absolute ass because they are putting more priority on stupid things like breaking a chat system that worked fine before.
---
❤️
---
Im excited to see how hard this spaghettis my overview when I'm combat probing 200+ ships while moving. Still an awesome change.
---
That's literally every company. I am an active member of like 4 or 5 gaming communities on Reddit and 'the devs tale notice when the players make a stink' is a recurring theme, not something u ique to CCP.  Everyone knows reports do nothing, but I doubt it's because CCP is best pals with every botter in the game. 
---
Yeah mate you might need a break from the game. This isnt good for you.
---
Also, if you are going the multi-wormhole route, you should also use a wh mapping tool so you don't get lost, e.g. Tripwire or Siggy.
---
Then stop dropping supers and titans. We had a good fight the other day but you guys had to escalate to the point we couldn't fight. Just like yesterday, you keep your caps docked.. we keep ours docked.
---
&gt; That would be a pretty big negative change to a lot of players who are not permacamping
---
not seeing it tbh
---
TEST is the same size as Horde.
---
I know the feeling man. If you're later US tz then ORIFT might be a good fit for you. We have a bunch of night owls that came to wormhole space for the exact same reason you're considering. Right now we put around 25 actual players in fleets so nothing too crazy but if it sounds cool we give it a shot. Hit me up in game on Towelie Smokesalot or message me on here. 
---
+1
---
might also ability for t2 BS to use it. Finally have a good reason to bring marauders to the field. 
---
lol everyone knows that test/goons formed bigger caps, you’re not some sooper spy for knowing that
---
if we had subcap superiority, we could have brought in caps despite having fewer. but we didn’t have subcap superiority, so it fell apart.
---
so. no point bookmarking it, then.
---
Well, you can already remote inject, so idk what that aims to accomplish
---
Who gives a shit?  I view the win condition for eve as when the north lies beaten broken and in the grave.  Everything after is an epilogue.  When that happens we can have a good fight and await the final cluster shutdown.
---
&gt;It's also how they help HK track their rental empire
---
Good troll post! +1
---
Yes, I know they attempted to rebrand to be the Dead Coalition, but almost everyone (including many of their own) refer to them as GoTG still. 
---
&gt; I did not say CSM and CCP didn't know CSM's role. I said that it's possible. In your case, it even looks like the case. I can't speak of many other CSMs or CCP, with whom I had no interaction. The point here is that I don't have to be CSM/CCP to know the best role CSM can take to help the game.
---
As I said before, it is the height of arrogance to tell somebody actively doing the job that they don't know how to do it, especially coming from someone who actively misunderstands the role and yet is unwilling to learn from those who have done it.  You are so positive that you know better that you're incapable of having a conversation with anybody. 
---
&gt; Your ideas were not special or enlightened. 
---
Ignoring the fact that some of the things I brought up were things you suggested to me, they didn't have to be "special" or "enlightened." They needed to be ideas that would make the game better, and the fact that I actually put out a platform was more than 75% of the folks running did. 
---
&gt; You weren't a nobody. You were a mega empire member. All you had to do is convincing your nullblock to put you on top 6 in the block voting ballot. Perhaps you just got on the Goon ticket due to the meme. The meme itself amounts to you shooting a video and being a RL politician, not necessarily stuff that'd indicate your broader campaigning skills. And again, campaigning a skillset which I argue shouldn't even be entirely important to get into CSM.
---
Being one in a sea of 40,000 faces made me a nobody. I pointed it out specifically in my campaign video. I was, and still am, just like the vast majority of people who play this game. I won because I did something unique, and I ran my campaign like a real one. That's what put me over the edge. If I'd just relied on the meme and did no other work, I'd have lost. It was everything else that I did that made it happen.
---
I know why I got elected, Olmeca. I've done the math. I know the work I put in. Just generating that meme was more work than the vast majority of candidates did. That was part of the campaign. You don't think going viral is something that every candidate wants? 
---
Regardless, I'm done arguing with you. Arguing with you is like trying to teach a pig to sing. 
---
Why wouldn't you simply use a public mask and have people use that? That's what it is for.
---
Sliced bread gets bested yet again
---
I've asked about 0.0 / wormhole logistics before and people just say when you join a corp, they have freighter services that will ship  your stuff etc. 
---
Assuming it's an established corp who you trust not to rip you off, do you literally just contract a few ships and items someone in the corp who then just moves it to the main station or something? 
---
In high sec obviously I just buy when I want and move it to where I need it but nullsec or wormhole logistics seems way more complex.
---
Say I', pvping in a vindicator (just for argument sake) and I lose it, can I just put in an order for a new one and it will arrive within a few days or something? How does it typically work? 
---
TEST is to Imperium as Horde is to PanFam
---
Giant bunch of meatshield tards that can't join the real alliance corps.
---
I was thinking jet can mining might be the best option, cans last an hour which is fine and then haul a full load back to station in a hauler?
---
Wait what, there are regions of nullsec which is owned by NPCs? Can these systems be taken over by players or are they just dedicated neutral zones?
---
By the way after doing my research I've decided on a skiff for nullsec as you'll need to take rats that spawn on you and if you do get tackled at least you have some kind of suitability while someone might come to assist you.
---
I see you commenting with insight on several comments, so I wanted to give you a good answer to this. I think of TEST and Goons as the biggest guys in the room. We keep each other in check by not trying to evict each other. If we did, the rest of the server would team up on one of us, if not both. So, we have a defensive pact to defend each other's space, but also to stay neutral so we can fight each other when needed. Once you go above the equator (middle of the map) we are blue to each other. We hate the north more than we hate our bee friends. 
---
This all came about because of the dog-pile that was getting ready to happen to TEST during The Extinction War. Goons knew that if the rest of the server teamed up on us and killed us, they would be next and of course we would have helped the rest of the server if Goons didn't help defend us when we needed it. So we activated our defensive pac and fended off the winter invasion. 
---
Goons and TEST are brothers born of different parents. We both came from forums and started as a rag tag group of random people just fighting their way through the world. Could it have been avoided? Maybe, maybe not. PL did continue to try and farm us after WWB, so they are getting their just rewards.
---
thats fine, but when you have a rorqual on field supplying boosts the cycle time and yield bonues are so massive that you cant jettison fast enough, wich is why you just drop it in the fleet hangar of said rorq
---
Every fucking time the launcher forget my accounts CCPLEASE
---
Typically, you’d buy it in Jita yourself, usually with an alt, then set up a courier contract with whoever the courier is, and wait. 
---
Also, never do 0 collateral contracts, always do just over what the item is worth. No legitimate courier will expect 0 collateral anyway. 
---
A lot of those threads were made by random people. I think everyone enjoyed some memes coming from this whole thing too. I think it was less bragging than making fun of that weak mentality shown by hk by giving up AND claiming they never had a chance and then claiming they undocked against all odds...
---
Yes i am looking from my side of the fence but im trying to be objective and i think i can claim to be more informed about what happened, could have happened and so on than some wh f1 drones.
---
400 of the 1000 initial ppl had to jump out again cause they were not ready and prepped for a week long wh campaign. And the remaining numbers are ALL of our timezones combined. We didnt hold hole control with 1500 people like they try to make it out. We held hole control with 200 max. They formed almost 200 to counter and thats why im saying in THAT (all deciding) fight we actually were the underdog. Just because they failed and we caught them doesnt mean its the hard counter. Reputation issnt gained on reddit either btw. and nor does it hurt init in any way if i argue with the wh guys that want to hate us anyway.
---
Well, maybe.

broken thing? we just have better organization and more content groups with real content
---
This was always bizarre to me. Doing an activity that has no cost that affects uncountable players and then saying a cost would be negative. The result is the same (people docking and not playing). If you can't afford the cost, should you be shutting down the play of an entire spot? 
---
Sure we all have our cloaky stories but I remember passing through MOA space seeing upwards of 80 people docked because of 2 campers in their triangle. That's a massive result for no cost. You wouldn't pay to shut down a zone? I would.
---
Though, I will be on your side because the more we screw over everyone in null the better. So I'm pro stupid ideas that affect any nullbitch. 
---
You can remote inject skill points, not skills.
---
You have a jita alt to buy what you want and then contract it to your trusted JF/freighter guy, talk to him to work out a fair price, you’re probably talking 50mil from highsec to deep null, buts it’s been years since I’ve been involved in that. Most JFers etc ping when they are going to be next doing a highsec &gt; null or null &gt; highsec run. Love him, he is a hero. 
---
You not contradicting yourself your story has consistently not matched the battle report for that fight. 
---
I don't think you have the depth of understanding of our hate for PL. We have been evicted from 5 regions, more than a dozen stations. We have had our staging stations reinforced for "lulz" and we have had to pack up and move more times than I can remember. We have been hunted for more than 4 years. As in, we get evicted... find a new home, and a few systems over a new PL staging pops up. Rinse and repeat. So, don't treat this like some misc war over some nonsense narrative. This is the bill collector coming for payment, and the payment will be in blood.
---
bruh, I have some terrible news about where you stand in that coalition:
---
in the front, soaking up hits, right where they told you to be. 
---
Boy, you dont have a clue how a defensive war works do you?  Maybe if you guys had participated in the fade/pureblind campaign last year instead of krabbing it up in geminate you would have a better idea how this works.  Maybe if you had ever been on the wrong side of the boot instead of joining up with panfam to be on the winning side you would have a better idea how this works.  
---
This is a marathon, not a sprint.  And you guys aren't playing it to win right now.  
---
So basically the part where you have the most fun?
---
Depends really on your ship also I hope you're not doing this alone because it would be really hard to defend on ur own. I think using hams would be a pretty decent choice. Take my words with a grain of salt though since I've never actually defended a structure outside of a fleet
---
&gt; roaming in a battleship, you don't roam all that much do you?
---
From time to time, it's always pretty fun. All you need to do is to know what you're doing and avoir shitty areas like Delve, Deklein or Geminate, a.k.a blob lands. Now believe what you want, I mean, who am I to tell you that you are wrong even when you are. 
---
which is also why your "fun" remark, implying that what they do isn't fun, is, excuse my autism, retarded, you fucking retard.  
---
we can go on forever if you want to keep nitpicking stupid shit, or you can vote for somone else and fuck off.
---
Whoops, yes I posted in the wrong thread. Thanks for replying though.
---
In my opinion that all depends on their leader's ambitions. Point taken though - here's an upvote
---
The public mask is open to everyone... Would you want to share the routes to your systems with your enemies?
---
Yeah you are right... it was 1500 goons fighting 60 hk ppl fighting against all odds like the heroes they are
---
if that makes you sleep better, i dont care
---
&gt; As I said before, it is the height of arrogance to tell somebody actively doing the job that they don't know how to do
---
Not if your job is making my/people's life better. I/people can tell you that you don't. Still ignoring the important nuance are we?
---
&gt; I know why I got elected, Olmeca. I've done the math.
---
I don't really wanna debate how you got elected anymore. Seems like that's not helpful as you're not willing to absorb the point I made. If you ran independent, and without the meme of being a RL politician, perhaps we would have a verifiable way to resolve this dispute. 
---
&gt; Regardless, I'm done arguing with you. Arguing with you is like trying to teach a pig to sing.
---
Whenever we argue we hit a cycle where you keep ignoring nuances, and I keep having to repeat it again. You figure who's the pig and who's trying to teach.
---
lol wat
---
No worries!! Also, when you get to know your groups JF runners, and use them a few times, most will be more than happy to do it if you say “yo can you grab me this ship on your run later tonight”. Logistics make the world go round, these guys make eve so much more enjoyable, and deserve a tip every time imo. 
---
An event so unprecedented, so rare, that it was felt necessary to send out a ping stating that fact.  
---
Nah ure just unknowingly being a huge idiot
---
Brick tanked punisher is my favorite t1 frig. 10k+ ehp and 150+ heated dps. Plus one of the best looking frigate hulls
---
A marathon that you guys aren't even running... You really think you are going to be to maintain Highsec ops and invade Geminate? You guys can't even win fleets where you out number Horde in Highsec. You guys only win fights when Goons hold your hand...
---
How long before your krabbers and spodbrains lose interest? For an alliance that is now supposed to "live" in Geminate y'all's numbers have been pathetic... Content for us has been great the last couple weeks. Makes it worth undocking. 
---
Cloaky camping does not shut down anything, it just lessens the power of local in giving you warning. You probably already have warnings based on activity if you check your intel channel. Defenders have 10x the advantage with panic/super defense fleets/ fatigue less jb/ and massive counter numbers. So stop crying. 
---
Who's reddit account are you?
---
Yes please. If only they noticed the path you took on the first one :p
---
You can increase profitability by hauling a lot of stuff at once. If your freighter is full then fit expanders, that way you can put in even more expensive stuff.

Nice game CCP,   you can play *and get mugged at the same time!*  Where else can you invite the scum of the earth into your living room to chat and look through your wallet.  This is real money folks, not some game tokens.

\^Underrated comment
---
I found a LS off our static and then scanned into a C2 from the LS. There were some BS wrecks and station cans on dscan. A few minutes later after confirming on ZKill, I locate the station containers littered all over grid ejected from the Fortizar that once stood anchored just a few hours ago. The station containers were all picked clean and had crap in them like minerals other than the last container we checked. Corp mate confirms Standup Market Hub 1 in last station container but we need a DST to pick up as it's over 30,000m3 . It's worth 750+ mil, which is not bad! I warp around system and begin to scan out the hole and find 3 Ravens, 3 Brutix Navis, 1 Eris, 1 Crane in a small faction POS in the far corner of the system. They are all piloted except the Crane. I jump my Bustard in and immediately cloak up.   
---
 It won't show up on DSCAN from their POS and I have eyes on the POS with my scanning alt.  I bring in a falcon alt, cloak up and warp at range off the station container. I am expecting a trap...perhaps a sabre or something cloaked right off that station container with the Standup Market Hub 1.  It makes no sense in my head that everything else had been looted. They have a DST right in the POS, why would they leave it? I figure with the falcon and core stabs on the my Bustard, it's worth trying to get the loot. As I convince myself that sometimes eve players are just bad, I still start to get the shakes as I warp in my Bustard. Worse off, it pops, best case I double it's value in loot. 
---
I land, decloak and loot the station container as quickly as I can while spamming my align hotkey back to the LS hole. I swap back and forth between my scanning alt on their POS and my Bustart as it gains momentum while I'm waiting for it to reach maximum speed before initiating warp. I warp, land on LS hole and jump. I immediately cloak up and start to scout my way back to HS for a quick sell.
---
Op success and 3/4 of a billion richer!
---
I'd rather have an anchored structure (maybe tied in with sov) that, once every X days can be toggled to pop cloaks. That way, you do it when you want, scan the dude down, kill him. It only disables cloaks for a few seconds, so if you are at the computer you can easily cloak back up and you're set for another X days.
---
Hunters hell, this helps me krab. 
---
You mean the announcement that the F1 alliances send telling you exactly how to cast your vote?
---
i guess it is always a Cruise Missiles + Painter. i don't think there is any point on fitting anything smaller, but that's just MHO
---
No but i found from Stain to lowsec. 
---
Stupid question....when did T1 bubbles change to a 2 day despawn vice 7? Or is that an upcoming change?
---
Wait, who does this? Surely it's faster, cheaper, and safer to jump clone to empire to learn it, and pod back? Or change home system to your school system, pod there, jump clone back? Or a million other ways you don't have to a)own a DST and b)move 5 billion ISK in a silly manner?
---
no dont wait until youve bought out your buy order just have enough of them up to always be able to push something, idle time is bad and reduces profits
---
Your parent comment is right though, this is a fundamental problem with democracy. If one particular group is very keen on being represented, they'll end up being overrepresented. No matter what you think about gun rights, the NRA is a very good example for this.
---
Sometimes you just gotta let your bittervet out :P
---
I love comparing eve hulls and fits to classes in other MMOs. Eve basically has sci-fi versions of an old, fantasy MMO mechanics (tank, heal, buff, debuff, crowd control, damage dealing, pets) but while leaving the player free to build their own class. Meanwhile modern MMOs tend to just bake all the support (and to an extent even tanking and healing) into every DPS class and just vary the animations and timings of everything.
---
Just ignore the salt lol. 
---
Galaxy pack at G2A is almost half the cost as elsewhere... 
---
Its not because the neighboor is doing it , that it justifies you doing it ;) 
---
Yeah, that's too much.  Any "solution" needs to be on the cloaky camper's schedule, not the guys looking to kill the cloaky camper.
---
If you have 600 ozone, you know you're good for 10 hours before you have to refuel.  Doesn't really change gameplay for solo dudes at all.  But if you have 40 cloaky campers covering every system in delve for a month, suddenly refueling becomes a real issue.

WWB died, PL lied.  Now PL &amp; Co. get to reap the long term rewards of their agrarian and diplomatic mistakes.
---
JF hauling is definitely lucrative. Especially with JF5. 
---
Low sec is much riskier than null just given the state of it and type of ship you use usually. If you’re jump freighting properly though, the only time you’ll be at real risk to lose cargo or your ship is high sec re-entry. High sec is much more dangerous to a JF than null or low. 
---
That's not proof... sauce, me.
---
I guess it's too hard to carry around 120 ozone?  idk.

The thing is also that we are running out of reasons to explain the lack of enforcement. Perception matters. CCP knows they are seen as not banning bots. This particular case is a good opportunity to show that they care. The evidence is there. But as usual, nothing happens.
---
But this guy clearly isn't botting, this is input broadcasting which is a different crime entirely.

Well... if you wanna fly new eden's biggest buttplug, its all up to you.

Atomic Beam Cannon sounds like a much cooler name :D

6 cloaky campers in one system shuts down rorqual mining 100%.  There's no real counterplay to a sudden bomb wave on your excavators other than *don't mine with 6 neuts in local*.

why not both?

New venue for Vegas.  Nice.

I don't see that but it may be in another post, either way I like the idea.
---
You do realize that winter actually starts on December 21st, right? It technically hasn't even been winter for a month my friend.
---
&gt;Would you want to share the routes to your systems with your enemies?
---
Depends on what you are doing. If this is for long term use, then yes I agree with you. For one off's it's fine for a bunch of corps/alliances forming up for a roam. Your enemy would need to know the mask name and know what 3rd party tool you are using. I'm certainly not important enough for people to be stalking me they way you are suggesting.
---
We are easily maintaining hisec ops, geminate ops, and other theaters. How many of your attempted markets stay active for more than a couple days?  How many do you even attempt to defend?  We have a sig there that is backed up by the alliance proper.  As for geminate, again, look to fade and pureblind last year.  This is a slow process of wearing out your pitifully thin fc roster (ja makanen, lol), wearing down your space (you have all but ceded western geminate already), wearing out your members wallets (non complete srp for strat ops only when allowed by the fc, lol), and wearing out the batphones.  
---
Eventually your adms are low, your fcs are worn out, your members are poor and demoralized (already happening if your discord is anything to go by), your fleet numbers drop, your batphones get less interested in forming big for you, and then, a breaking point is reached, and you collapse quickly.  
---
Wait, I didn't even know you can refresh! How?
---
^ This use your nyx for ratting and your avatar for boson ratting
---
Nice video
---
Glory to bob
---
Good bot
---
After being away from the game for a year, ive got the sudden urge of makeing videos and doing weekly uploads. Ile try to progress on my editing and make it more smooth 😊 hope you enjoy
---
like when all your HK numbers are consistently higher then they where on battle reports and all your init numbers are consistently lower.
---
Along with lies like no citadels where up when it's more likely then not they where, your information becomes suspect, try lying about things that are less trivial to verify. 
---
Like I never made the 1500 goons claim, because that's not what the battle report says i made the 100 numerical advantage claim because that's what the dam battle report say's, like you do get that anybody could look it up right ? 
---
What makes this sad is that really your pissing over your own achievement, if you sad nothing and didn't spin some cool narrative by consistently low balling your own numbers while rounding up the hostile number, when this shit is literally trivial to verify. 
---
People might be giving you the benefit of the doubt, but when you consistently wrong in the direction that favors you most any such benefit quickly melds. 
---
If you want and copy paste the numbers from the battle report nobody could have disputed the number and everything else you say would not be suspect by your usage of creative rounding. 
---
Yes, do it my friend.
---
We did? We dont have supers up there, but panfam does, so if we can out form them in caps without deploying supers I am very impressed. 
---
This has to be a troll.
---
I didn't extract but I have gone down the path of flying Titans and Dreads instead of carriers and supers as my goto capitals.
---
To expand on this a little:
---
Red Frog have always had all their freighters in npc corps, and corp alts in the mail corporation. Because doing it any other way would be fucking insane, with how the wardec system was.
---
Felicitaciones la conectividad es cosa seria por esos lares. Espero que puedan solucionarlo. 
---
I'm not in a F1 alliance i have to look up how i vote for myself ;). 
---
On the positive side it means i didn't outsource my thinking ( on the negative side not all my idea's are of equal quality and this thinking thing kinda hurts when you have not done it that much before ). 
---
Have you considered getting another Nyx? If you fly one and it is 30% enjoyable, getting another will double your enjoyment.
---
GoTG doesn't want relevance,they just want to pay off Sorts car loans.

Salty Bois in the comments ✔ 
---
Why is high sec more dangerous? Groups of suicide gankers?
---
Also how many hauls/hours would I need to do to pay for Omega by doing JF hauls?
---
we didn't have super caps because TKE isn't worth sacrficing that much for to defend in eyes of the directorate
---
And cell reception not being dog shit.
---
first they delete local for a day, then they make the probe scanner better
---
the future is now 
---
thats real nice. Dont need that hotkey anymore! rejoice!
---
Goons have been in Kalevala cloaking camping for two months. Not sure Test had to really call anyone. They were already there.
---
Switching filters causes the list to refresh, I think. Or rescanning of course.
---
a tip, look to nullsec.
---
nullsec powers have the largest ammount of isk use/isk loss.
---
and thus need replacements.
---
fits they use, sell the best.
---
Cormorants, Caracals, Stabbers, Macheriels,Nightmares, Bhaalghorns,Megathrons, Apoc.
---
it can also depend on where you selling or who you selling to.
---
Feroxes big right now.
---
so just watch battle reports that show up on reddit, look what both sides using, and those ships are the ones people want ot buy.
---
also. ganker ships.  Talos, Catalysts, etc.  
---
Can you give more details? How did they almost steal 18$ USD from you? "Do NOT trust people" is a hard lesson learned in EVE. Sometimes it takes a few times for people to get it... 
---
the way this game is going yeah totally get an Avatar
---
This is a great update.
---
You mean to see how badly you can ruin them?
---
If you want to experiment, I'd suggest Pyfa. But in game, you're far more likely to roll them into garbage than you are into something wondrous. 
---
Considering that people currently force the whole thing to refresh to update the distance, it should be better, if anything.
---
Please say Geminate is worth sacrificing. 
---
I think you're onto something
---
Oh shut  the fuck up you circlejerking retards
---
zeroniss1 for Horde CEO \\0/
---
Cool announcement - I'll hold any praise until its released and functioning correctly.
---
Makes sense. I was a huge COSMOS producer back when I played and was curious.
---
Look at that list more closely. Most are either in HS, or on the LS-HS gate. That rather proves my point (they are pretty much uncatchable when cynoing).
---
&gt; is there a good argument for nerfing logistics?
---
Some level of difficulty and effort in logistics is what gives the cluster a sense of scale. Also, targeting logistics which are bringing supplies to a battle front is one way that small groups can do something meaningful against the big blocs, and Eve needs a lot more of those.
---
I have nuetral citadels in both Geminate and Kalevala. If horde wanted their space, those things wouldn't have lasted the 2 months i've had them there. Try dropping a neutral citadel in delve. They want that space.
---
Finally New Eden has developed the technology of... e-books
---
I never saw you FC a single fleet when I was in init, and I only went on one fleet the whole time I was there (was pando's btw)  
---
I'm not sorry I left, I was literally counting down the days anyway.   
---
There's no hard feelings on my side, either. I just don't think someone should be allowed a voice in affecting gameplay mechanics and changes if they don't have a full understanding around the topics they're speaking about. 
---
Well that just made too much sense.
---
sabres are really good, BPO goes for like 80B though
---
There is a tab in the market window that has a chart with the price of that item over 3 months (iirc) and volume of sales.  
---
You better swallow those cummies instead of blowing them out. 
---
Oh, well that seems pointless. You can't effectively multibox hacking as it's an active puzzle (particularly at the speed you want to do it in a CRF), so you can't hack any faster. All you gain is the slowboat time for burning 20km and that's pretty much nothing with an MWD.
---
They had the POS a decade ago.
---
And just to emphasise, the damage is 100% explosive, so you can target a tank right at it if you can refit/reship nearby.
---
VNIs
---
Isn't this the place goons have cloaky camped for 4+ months now? 
---
Are cosmos mods the ones where a 50mn mwd only needs 135pg instead of 150? 
---
The best option!
---
Also not sure why your nyx pilot has 65m SP, nyx is nearly perfected at 40 mil sans the useless stuff like nanopaste V / armor layering V, definitely perfected at 45
---
Just started playing again. Been about a decade since I logged in i think. Starting fresh but still enjoying the game. 
---
Planning on making a c3 base to solo on if I can manage it once I remember how to play the game and got some money to afford it.
---
I saw the dscan and it was 190 ships. Rounding it up calling it a \~200 man hac fleet is higher but reasonable i think. Most of the logis are not on the BR so going with zkill as info issnt 100% reliable (zkill will never tell you the full story and any decent fc would tell you that). INIT numbers were \~200 stukas (probably less at start but hard to tell) and then additional \~60 ravens on the 2nd engagement and speaking out of memory i can get some numbers wrong here and there so pls forgive me if my first estimation was 10-20 ships lower on the ravens (not like that made a difference). All in all you can claim 70 numerical advantage was on our side and i didnt argue that. Lying about citadels is a stretch. I said we didnt have them up cause i remembered forming out of a pos for this one. So it didnt matter if there was a raitaru up and i had no reason to lie about it anyway i just assumed thats why we were still forming in the pos but someone corrected me and i explained it right after nbd.
---
Even with your biased numbers of 160 vs. 260 you had the tactical advantage tho. Cause yeah believe it or not shiptype and skill matters in this game.
---
To say im talking to you cause im trying to get some recognition or so is also weird to me. Who the fuck would even read this thread especially so far down at this point anyway?
---
The bragging about how ballsy you guys were for undocking against all odds while in that particular fight all the odds were actually in your favor was just a bit much for me not to say anything. Also who needs the battlereport if you can see the video of what happened? You are just picking on little things i might have mistaken while the truth is right there.
---
Yea, supers are boring as fuck, dealing with the fighters and that, titans are p damn boring as well most of the time. But if you think you’ll see more action, and don’t rely on your nyx for isk to replace the titan down the line, then go for it. 
---
But if I was you I’d just rat in the nyx for a few weeks then inject a new avatar pilot. 
---
Remember to factor in hauling costs or your time if you are going to do it yourself.
---
If one thing Dscanning needs is to be made hard again. Its ridiculously easy to find someone.
---
This change accomplishes nothing other then more CPU stress on the server. 
---
Materials will cost more than a ship if you sell to Jitta.
---
You can try and make and supply the market somewhere remote and list the ships at higher prices than materials needed to produce them. 
---
Location is key as  you need somewhere withot a lot on the market and with people who would buy from you.
---
Oh god yes!  Huge quality of life.  Thanks CCP!
---
+1 for PGGB, I learned a lot with them and they bring good fight
---
In high sec you have to take gates, in low sec and null sec you're jumping directly to stations/structures which means you're 100% safe.
---
With citadels it's a lot easier to always have that exit cyno safe but when they're on stations there's always that little chance you'll by chance have your cyno killed at the same time as an unrelated high sec gank is now happening to you. 
---
Calm down satan
---
Maybe he's been on enough fleets with you to know you don't have a clear understanding...?
---
You sat in front of a camera last weekend and said (I'm paraphrasing) "I don't see the point of an eagle fleet, I bombed an eagle fleet once, they're just not good, just fly a ferox". There was no substance, no argument. Just, you bombed it; so it's bad.
---
&gt; You don't need to be an expert
---
So it would be fine for the CSM to contain 0 nullbloc players, right? The rest of us also know enough about Eve to 'have a broader base of knowledge' to present the null perspective and balance null features.
---
Why would we?
---
It affects us 0%.
---
"We can't see your ESI info so we need a deposit for 30 days"  After I said it didn't sit well, I searched and found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6gea41/recruitment_scammed_by_honeycomb_part_of_goonswarm/).
---
Now, this is EVE right....so I know, this could be some member of a competing Null Sec Corp trying to starve the Goons of new recruits. So, I am willing to rescind this post.  I will require 1.5 Billion in ISK which I will return after 30 days if I am wrong (+25% interest)
---
Or, if you don't like what's on r/eve, don't browse it.
---
\&gt; So I am an alpha starting small in the industry world of eve online currently settled in jita  
---
Bear in mind that being an alpha means you are going to be less productive in manufacturing items and will be paying more in taxes and fees on the market; and being in Jita mean you are probably competing with the more ruthless and efficient manufacturers and marketers.  Hence why your profit margin (if any) will probably be tiny and (like you say) more work and less money than Level 3 mission running.  
---
One suggestion would be to find a 'hole' in a local market somewhere which you can fill. Of course, this depends on doing research on what (and how much and how often) is needed in that location, your ability to source the minerals and parts needed to manufacture there, and competing against the various websites and spreadsheets that identify these market holes... you may find something to make and profit from, and then some other nerd hauls in a bunch of it and undercuts you!  
---
There are quite a few guides to manufacturing and marketing which go into much more detail about all this, if you search or browse some of the educational sites like Eve University.
---
&gt;Why do we even have r/eve? 
---
because it's literally the best aggregator of out of game content.
---
things like hoboleaks dumps, patch notes, new announcements, in-game news, etc all get dumped here.
---
it's literally a 1 stop shop for 'what the fuck's going on in eve right now'.
---
if i have to wade through a bundle of shit posts, so be it, it's worth it to have all the content in one place so i don't have to have 30 bookmarks for different sites in order to stay up to date with any changes.
---
It's not fine, it needs representation from different areas of the game. I'm not sure how you actually achieve that, but having an entirely nullbloc CSM is never going to result in anyone having good input on balance or features to support healthy LS, HS or J-space. And that's even without going into the krab vs hunter angle when most of the CSM represents a bloc which does an incredible amount of krabbing and wants that space to be safe.
---
Congrats, you now cannot do a BLOPs fleet because you cannot remain cloaked while having bombs in your cargohold or know you'll need a lot of torps.

oh my,  that TiDi...how is that even fun?
---
If roaming delve and using ur eyes is not evidence. Dont know what else i can say
---
I'm literally reiterating what Aeg or someone told us at the end of the fleet, I really don't care wether they think it is worth fighting for or not, I just wanna shoot dinos and bees.
---
You could try, but the modulators have more chance to increase the fitting costs than lower them.
---
You can run the 3x5 career agents of a faction, plus the 3x5 of the allied faction. That gives you L3 agents. There is no need to run L1-2.

you took the words right out of my keyboard

I guess when you can't fight back in game you do it on Reddit.

I'm sure he seeded hundreds of corpses.

Does your name imply the Uni you went to in Canada? Cause if so, many of us in IOU are not far!

other people could definitely replicate it if they had content creators and people who liked inflicting pain.

You're a walking meme

oh well, as long as you get buttmad about TEST / GSF shitstomping NCPL, we'll keep doing it.

Eve combat on its own is dated, boring and dull. Where the fun comes from is the hunt, the set up, trying to out wit your opponent and using tactics and strategy to fight out numbered while still getting either a kill or a fun fight. Sometimes just getting away after a failed kill attempt can be more fun than just ganking someone. 
---
When you take Eve combat and put it in a 1v1 setting all the variables of sandbox interaction are taken away and you are left with that dull boring combat. 
---
tldr: Eve combat does not scale well in to 1v1 arena.
---
Who is going to bankroll keeping the bad guys blue for the duration of the conflict?
---
UNPOSSIBLE.  CAN'T BE DONE.  JUST CAN'T FIND THAT 24m3 ANYWHERE.  THE SHIP IS RUINED.  THIS STEAK NEEDS KETCHUP.  THE FROGS ARE GAY.
---
Good for you then, space friend!
---
Ask any pilot, any real pilot. It doesn't matter if you win by a F1 or a F2, winning's winning.
---
well the thing is, you can remote change clone ONCE every 12 months, thats on cooldown for me rn 
---
also yea i can just ceptor up , eat the book and kill myself i guess 
---
Gross
---
I was joking, it should say "bots" not alts. 
---
This place has a toxicity problem
---
What's the cost like for all that infrastructure?
---
what if you do this on all factions?
---
Csm is just a damage control. Nothing less nothing more. 
---
If that's who gets elected, then that's what folks wanted. It's perfectly fine by me. 
---
brought to you by the great CCP Wonderboy &lt;3

So no more need to move them ...
---
Yes, Sort, the most trustworthy source in all of Eve.
---
its incredible how people miss the point this hard.
---
Now this is a legit shitpost
---
That's correct. I shared an opinion based on my experience. I was not tasked with writing a Suitonia style blog post arguing why Feroxs &gt; Eagles. Nor would I do that, because I have no desire to do that.
---
A faction won't like it if you do career for hostile faction, so they will start liking you less.
---
There are a couple hundred other INIT members who would disagree with him. So you can take the word of a guy who jumps corps every two months and left after getting into it with our lead supercap FC, or you could take it from all of them. 
---
away team is always underdog.
---
Broker fees and sales tax are a percentage of the value of the sell order, so as long as you're not talking about minimum brokerage fee orders, it doesn't matter whether you put up one buy order of quantity (100) or one hundred buy orders of quantity (1) - the amount you pay in fees is the same.  
---
And, if you're looking to avoid the bother of putting up multiple sell orders, I'm thinking you should probably stay away from a high-volume/low-margin strategy (it only really works at Jita, which means constant order-update babysitting along with having many, many orders on the go simultaneously).
---
If you're looking to minimize effort, go with lower-volume/higher-margin, and consider less-hectic places like Amarr or Dodixie before jumping into the deep end of the pool at Jita.
---
Good luck -

We can't forget Hellmarch either.

Looks like most of the names are back in. There's one blank left that I see, which I think by process of elimination must be Of Sound Mind.
---
There are plenty of hard feelings on your side, or you wouldn't be here. If you never flew with me, then you have no idea what I know or don't know, do you? 
---
Which is it? Do you know me so well you know I know nothing about the game? Or do you not know me at all, but are still here shit talking? 
---
Regardless, you have no idea what my level of knowledge is, and you're just here because you have a chance to crap on somebody in INIT. 
---
Good point. 
---
Lmao you ownd him!
---
We brought a fleet of 20-ish caracals for a gudfite over the weekend -- Horde responded by dropping a couple of HAW dreads supported by 70-ish man kitchen sink fleet. Then they proceed to meme in local that we can't fight without Goons.
---
Well, be careful what you wish for. 
---
having 40k characters under one banner is the main thing tho, it doesn't take a lot of effort to make a ballot and send it for the voters if you can reach them and they trust you, the problem is reaching them (smaller groups and communities) and them trusting you, especially when the combined amount of these smaller communities often don't surpass the amount on the one big alliance.
---
could be Gobbins pets like yall
---
Oh I got a bunch of his when I was in provi. Also Corebloodbrother and some other used to be high hats in proviblock. 
---
It was a good change just from the point of view of player retention, which, believe it or not, helps us vets and PvPers even if we never get to blow up the people who would have left the game because of the old wardec system, and have decided to stay. 
---
Stain desperately needs lowsec gate to be more alive, even dead syndicate has one
---
THERE YOU ARE :@
---
wow thats a very nice change actually 
---
Be aware Brisc, he will give you advice for campagning :D he will teach you your work :D
---
Welcome to the internet 
---
It's been technically cold as shit for 4 months
---
If you are just starting.. I would do ammunition/missiles and Vexor Navy Issues/Vexors and Caracals.
---
I have a few alts and one friend who has a few alts.   
---
The attacker is also only one player who is multiboxing toons (probably). 
---
Where is navy vexor police skin? If you make police skins for top botting ships make it right.
---
Or, better yet, Stain to Jita
---
The question is, did he make that nebula in his image too?
---
I have?  wow this is news.  
---
I solved this issue by deleting my sharedcache &amp; eve root folder contents.  (BUT LEAVE THE LAUNCHER DIRECTORY ALONE) 
---
    
---
This got the beta launcher to DL the updated w/o a full reinstall.  The catch is you have to re-DL everything if you have the "DL everything " option checked in launcher settings. 
---
what else am I supposed to do? play the game?
---
I'm here commenting on issues I see with the current CSM, has nothing to do with Init.   
---
I don't need to be on a fleet listening to you give FC orders to get a feel for your knowledge of the game. There were plenty of times in Init discord, or when I read CSM minutes, or seeing things that you post on reddit that painted a pretty clear picture regarding your grasp (or lack thereof) of game mechanics and the effect they have on various interest groups in the game.   
---
I said you don't have a clear understanding of game mechanics, not that you know nothing. And there's nothing wrong with that. I don't have a clear understanding of many game mechanics. Then again, I'm also not trying to be on the CSM. If you're going to be on the CSM in order to influence positive changes to gameplay, then you damn well better be an expert on the topics you're speaking about. Multiple people have pointed out ITT that you're not really an expert on anything in particular, which is further highlighted by your entire campaign being built around "guys i do politics irl vote 4 me tia" instead "i really know what i'm doing, put me in coach"  
---
Just because you don't like what I have to say doesn't mean you have to take it personal, or twist this into me being grrr ~~Init~~ Goons
---
&gt; This place is so fucked. I don't seem to remember it being like this when I won Eve back in 2016
---
Somewhere had to be the real new kugu...
---
Can't upvote enough. POS's created so much content when they actually mattered as part of the sov system. It makes far more sense to use POS's to dictate sov rather than waving a wand. I miss the tactical layer it added to systems with low moon numbers and the logistics required for the systems with lots of moons. Ccp really has fucked the sov system up good. 
---
A whole hour, that's not much. 
---
That one hour of cloak fuel, is 4 full reloads of ammo which you can chew through if you catch a carrier and aren't just some blob or in damage that's around 14K damage you're sacrificing. 
---
Having bomb reloads takes up 80% of your cargo and then if you want any meaningful amount of reloads for torpedos without needing to go home the rest of your cargo is ~8 reloads of your torpedos. 
---
You can always remote change your medical clone to your school system, regardless of cooldown. Afterwards you use a regular clone to jump back to your staging/home and reset the medical clone to there. All you are really burning is a single 24h or less clone jump.
---
What about in a ship with only mildly-revealing underwear?
---
are you aware of the history of TEST? We are THE underdogs of all underdogs.
---
It was a clusterfuck lol, fun!
---
I thought the public mask was singular. Meaning you can create your own name one. I see no mechanism to do so anyway.
---
Can goons kindly fuck off and stop causing these good fights to turn into tidi lag fests 
---
can anyone tell me what these events actually are besides some pub crawling with the devs?
---
maybe ive missed it somewhere but the data seems... absent
---
It depends on a lot of factors, like the location you are trading, the time you have to dedicate to trading, your starting capital, etc. 
---
What I will tell you is that it often *feels* like you are making more isk on low margin/high volume trades. The reality is that sometimes you are, and sometimes you aren't, your ticks are just coming more quickly. 
---
The other thing I would tell you is that low margin/high volume trades are a lot more work because of market volatility. You will need to check and adjust these orders almost constantly. So, if you go this route be prepared to spend a lot of your time in eve staring at the market. 
---
Finally, like most people here have said already, I think the healthiest approach is a well rounded one with a good mix of low volume/high margin and low margin/high volume. 
---
And one final piece of advise, have some patience. Remember that if prices on an item you are selling get too low or if the prices on something you are buying get too high, it is okay to freeze your order in place. The market almost always regresses back towards the mean, and it happens quite quickly in eve. You will make a lot more money this way. 
---
Sticking with EVE for me…  I can't speak for anyone else... Is a sci-fi/space themed simulation of what real life would be in those circumstances.  With that in mind,  I approach the game from a "challenge accepted! " POV.  Expect loss.  Try to learn from each loss and grow in the game.  This is how one gits gud' in EVE.  IMHO :-)  YMMV
---
Git gud*
---
Opening and closing the window (alt-p) or changing the sort also does it. 
---
Basically any change you make to the data displayed forces a refresh. 
---
&gt; kugu
---
I had to research that and yeah................
---
:/
---
Eve updates in a nutshell
---
Its kinda like Goons trying to call themselves the Imperium. The name of a group is not what they call themselves, but what they are called by others. As the joke goes, you can build 50 bridges in a town, but fuck 1 sheep, and they don't call you "Dave the Bridge Builder" do they?
---
if they made blog entries about changes like this instead of fucking depleting spod visuals people would surely complain less
---
Lenin?Noooooooooooooooooooo
---
It's just a Guristas skinned Dragonfly
---
&gt; Chief among them being their steadfast refusal to promote self-improvement, individually or as a group, in any real capacity.
---
I literally don't even know what off-brand kool-aid you'd have to be drinking to think that of Horde. There's hurf, there's durf, and then there's claiming that TEST is a terrible alliance because they steadfastly refuse to have fun with propaganda.
---
It's, like, part of the fucking corporate letterhead or whatever that Horde is there to encourage people to improve.
---
No. These are not stupid tactics. He laid some bait out, you took it. You had all the tools to counter the bait. You could have been watching dscan, and been aligned out for insta warp as soon as the bait died. In any case, you went hunting and got out smarted. Get over it and learn what you can so that you won't make the same mistakes in a more costly ship. As long as you are salty you will not learn anything.
---
Hey be happy we're kicking out the guys that have been harassing you for a while a year ago. 
---
Feel free to explain how many of the other CSM members this fine you feel aren’t doing their jobs and don’t have a grasp on game mechanics. You called me out - the only one you’ve ever interacted with and who knows who you are - so forgive me if I make it clear what is obvious to anyone with half a brain that this is personal on your side. 
---
Test has a SIG doing stuff in Stain.  I'm not in that SIG, so I don't know what they are doing in Stain, but based on the BR you linked, it looks like mostly Russians doing mostly Russian things.
---
In other words, business as usual in Stain.
---
If you are running security missions, you probably want to work for the highest level agent available to you. Personally, when I am grinding standings, I use distribution missions and then switch to level 4 security missions once I've reached 5.0. Distribution does not pay as well as security, but they are easy and fast to finish so the grind goes much more quickly.
---
The most efficient way to grind standings is to do as many Storyline missions as possible. Assuming you are in a constellation with a Storyline mission for your NPC corporation or its Faction (check the list of agents for the NPC corporation you're missioning with on Dotlan to see where they are), they will offer you a storyline mission every time you complete sixteen missions of the same level with any corporation from their Faction. 
---
If you go to your Character Sheet, click on Interactions, then go down to Standings, you'll be able to click on each corporation or Faction and see your standings gains. Each dot on the graph is a mission you've completed. If you've completed twelve Level 2 missions, for example, once you unlock Level 3, be sure to run four more Level 2 missions to go ahead and get the Storyline mission. The standings boost will be worth waiting before you switch to Level 3.
---
If you locate a system with multiple agents of the same level close together along with a Storyline agent of the same corporation or Faction in that constellation, the standings grind will go very quickly. Ideally you'll be turning in missions 2-4 at a time, which will get you to the Storyline agent much faster. I've found that Level 2 Distribution missions are actually the sweet spot; Level 3 missions tend to send you further and/or require more hauling capacity, whereas batches of Level 2 missions can all be done at once  in a hauler and don't take you very far.
---
Many distribution missions you can fly in a frigate, but some will require some type of hauler. The T1 Industrials are fine, but if you have the skills a Blockade Runner is perfect, since it's fast, it can cloak for better security, and it has more than enough hauling capacity. 
---
I'm not discouraging you from doing security missions, though. They do pay a lot better, and leveling up in security missions is important so that you know what you're doing once you start level 4.
---
Clearly he knows more about that than me - he’s a philosopher and shit. 
---
If this happened a decade ago, that also meant more revenue for CCP to invest in server tech.
---
Can't argue with that...
---
Wasn't it for provi's stations? Which NC. failed hard and had to call PL to help them get some stations. Good old R3 pocket. 
---
&gt;People who propose such ‘easy’ fixes have no idea how 0sec works.
---
Stitch is genuinely one of the most knowledgeable roaming players in the game.
---
thats irrelevant to my comment, spodbrain
---
dont talk to me until you obtain a 5th grade education please
---
Shit, Legacy is full of us Canucks, though you're all south of me XD
---
I think the number of alts is growing at a steady pace, not actual players. 
---
&gt; I was actively advocating for you guys while Aryth and Killahbee were saying "fuck all wormholes." And yet I'm the one you guys shit on
---
you are the one nerds shit on because you are doubling down on certain positions and engaging with **everything**, do you really think if aryth and killahbee were talking in reddit or in WH specific discords they would get anything but laughed at given their positions(by wherms at least)? No less doing it during or slightly after the HK eviction while in many discords kspacers were coming in to troll
---
At this point it looks like you're baiting yourself into this situations and playing dumb, it's not possible.
---
praise me
---
You could just unsubscribe to /r/Eve.
---
Really though, /r/Eve is just like the old CAO inD.  Yeah, there is a lot of shit posting, and spinning and all that other shit that was on CAOD, but some people have fun with that stuff.
---
So basically, leave us alone to shit in our hands and throw it at each other.
---
NICE!
---
Yeah it was a good change. There is still the potential to improve it, but it's vastly better to before the change.
---
Ok. You really don't know much do you? Our Highsec precense is basically to make it cancerous for y'all. Highsec ops are super boring and they wear you down easily. 
---
You really don't know much about Horde if you think our FC roster is thin... You guys don't do fleets unless PGL leads them. If anything it is TESTs FC roster that us low.
---
Join Horde and you can see how much fun everyone is having watching Dinos flail about haphazardly...
---
Typical COSMOS mods are comparable to t2 mods in stats (+/- a bit) but with greater reduced PG/cpu requirements compared to t2/faction/deadspace/officer
---
&gt;I saw the dscan and it was 190 ships. 
---
That's a good 30 ships that then did no damage nor died, that number is already suspect. 
---
&gt;i think. Most of the logis are not on the BR so going with zkill 
---
Most of the Hac logi is there because they lacked ADC's so they where the first to get popped, beside a total of 13 scimi's died in the hole after that fleet. 
---
It's almost as if the comp wasn't careful formed and literally moved ASAP to start rolling because the comp would change truth the night as people went to bed and logged on. 
---
so i give you a 173 that's still way short of your 190 ( you might want to check if you scout can count that high ). 
---
You do make a good point here most of your command destroyers didn't take aggressive action and would likely not show up as there flown by alts. ( meaning the 260 number is likely on the low side ). 
---
&gt;~60 ravens
---
87 Ravens on the battle report, that's 27 off.
---
&gt;  All in all you can claim 70 numerical advantage was on our side and i didnt argue that. 
---
No i claimed a 100 and the battle report backs up that claim, it was likely more because most hacs died to like 22ish bombs. 
---
&gt;Even with your biased numbers of 160 vs. 260 you had the tactical advantage tho. Cause yeah believe it or not shiptype and skill matters in this game.
---
That's a battle report number i didn't make that up, I'm doing you a massive favor with the Battle report numbers because it's about ~90 bombers short. ( really never bother to count the bombers ). 
---
But let's give you the benefit here and say 150, that put's it at ~300 to ~173 ( that's including scimi's that died with a GSF ticker later on during the eviction ). 
---
&gt; To say im talking to you cause im trying to get some recognition or so is also weird to me. Who the fuck would even read this thread especially so far down at this point anyway?
---
That's not about this conversation in particular it's about your general activity, i'm not silly enough to believe this conversation matters all that much as it's just one of many. 
---
Times you tried to push this narrative that HK had a massive advantage when realistically that fight was a toss up at best, and the only reason it happened is because HK was already massive massive lucky. ( because despite your believe rage rolling really isn't a good way to get a fleet into a wormhole, and most people that suggested it tend to have never done it ). 
---
But Init has repeated pushed this narrative of HK having this massive lead after getting a number of hacs in when the reality was more that got massively lucky to get a relatively even fight and far from a fight under ideal conditions from there side, did HK have a chance for a come back there YES absolutely, but let's not pretend like it was some massive lead also there is very little of the it was ballsy to undock it's most well it was the only play and well it was a 50/50 shot ( i would say 40/60 in init's favor ) so HK kinda had no other options, specially because most people in that fight also didn't have that much at risk ( as the non-HK toons didn't live in rage ). 
---
I agree supers are the most annoying things you can fly in EVE. Including Titans. 
---
I was simply trying to be present and do my job. I’ve leaned my lesson. 
---
Never had a problem with SRP. If your alliance needs SRP to be active in fights, then that is just sad...
---
I mean, being here isn't a prerequisite to play the game. You could always create and moderate your own sub if you have a different idea though - if enough people feel the same way and you can successfully moderate it I'm sure it can get traction.  
---
That being said though, this sub definitely took a nosedive with the death of alliance forums, sites like Kugu and the re-made garbage EVE-O forums.  
---
Everyone flocked to /r/eve and the most successful content when a sub grows is always the lowest common denominator; jokes, memes and shitposting.
---
You'd be better off not fitting missiles and going full neuts + ewar tbh. Anti sub missiles are very weak against any sort of reasonably competent group, raitarus especially have very low dps. Just use it as an ewar platform to support your own fleet.
---
&gt;anopaste V / armor layering V, definitely perfected at 45
---
My Nyx pilot is my main, that's why. That's also why I do not own a Nyx, and despite having perfect skills never fly my Thanny or Moros either. I kind of wish I had all of those skill points back, but I would loose too many SPs by extracting to make it worth it to me. 
---
At last, this will give both parties a real feeling of knowing exactly in which part of the system they are located.
---
Not that I have any detail on the fight but that one looks like it needs a BR tool with more than 2 sides.
---
Which probably means it boils down to "Some structure got RF'd, people came to follow up as well as defend, TEST/Brave came to third party. Structure didn't die"
---
Thanks bud. I can see a few applications / fits where this could actually be beneficial. Pyfa when I get home from work tomorrow. 
---
So... wait. Does this mean that there is no Fanfest proper this year?
---
/r/wholesomememes
---
Aw ok, but if I do distribution and get to lvl 4, I can then swap to the level 4 security agent right away right?
---
3:40, the Deacon that lived :,)
---
evesterdam is put on by players friend, ccp don't run it
---
come on, there's an abyssal gap between being present and falling for every single provocation during the moment where those people are being evicted and most others are just angry that the blob can power thru yet another area of space easily. And that before counting your own smugposts about it following pando's desperate attempt for someone to tell him he did a good job and award him good boy points.
---
Why would a Goon or a TEST kill each other when Panfam is on grid? It's like the Marines and the Navy.. they hate each other, but if an Army guy walks in, everyone knows who's getting their ass kicked. lol
---
That depends on your personal perspective. Obviously I'm in his alliance and don't dislike him and vice versa with you and your alliance leader. So you believe in your leadership and I in mine... If I didn't i wouldn't be hanging around. But that is just the politics of Eve... It makes our game interesting, without which it will go stale and die. 
---
Looks like this "tour" is the replacement for Fanfest. Instead of Fantest, CCP will apparently be supporting a wider number of player gatherings at different points around the world and will do their game announcements, keynotes on upcoming features, and round tables at these events.
---
That presumably means that assuming there's a CSM14 election for the year, the results will be announced at one of these gatherings as well, maybe EVE Down Under or the St Petersburg one.
---
It's fine to do something about cloaky camping as long as you also do something about local. At the moment, two shitty mechanics (free, instant, perfect intel on the one hand, and the ability to sit in space and pretend to be active on the other).
---
Being able to counter camping without doing something about local just makes krabbing even more incredibly safe and that's not a good thing.
---
Actually the thing that would best deal with camping while also improving the rest of the game is (i) delayed local, exclusions from local or cloaky ships not appearing in local, but also (ii) delay on cyno or a decloak delay before being able to light a cyno. This removes most of the threat of a potential enemy in system, gives you a counter to being dropped and also improves general play because you can't be instantly dropped by a cap swarm.
---
As if they're going to waste time maintaining parity between old and new Aura voice clips. Oh wait, something something unwise/unnecessary allocation of dev time....
---
True, after all nothing would've been possible without people to fill those roles. Honestly, looking back at the comment I replied to, I was for whatever reason under the impression that it was just to smug. So yeah, pretty shit comment by me.
---
For reasons of pure idiocy, i copied "circlejerking retards" into google and clicked the images option...  it hurt me, hurt me bad sir, lol.
---
Just over a year ago I folded my old hs alliance into the corp I'm with now, and I can confirm that there's about 30% of the guys there that did not want to come to null with the rest of us. People we'd hung out with and played for years. 
---
They just had no interest in the requirements of null living or the extra income/options that come with it, they really just wanted to log in, mine/run missions/build stuff while watching netflix or doing other stuff. 
---
You don't think about it in null where everybody and their dog has multiple alts, but there's def. lots in hs that have no interests in the politics or the null life where you can get by quite happily on one account.
---
Not really. Some t1 frigs and dessies are being bought in hundreds. Every day. Welp and buy again 
---
cooler than Entropic Disintegrator?
---
I'd rather see more entities in null not less, regardless of who they are. Sounds more exciting tbh. Not that Horde will be going away after this.
---
To add to this, if you are undocked and log in as alpha you will be unable to use any of the modules :O  
---
once dunked a guy in a carrier because he was alpha when he logged in and couldnt do anything.  
---
Thankfully we killed him before he would get his credit card out and resub :O
---
Question 1: Do both. Go 50/50.
---
Question 2: Always put up sell orders as soon as you can, as long as you don’t end up maxing your number of orders (which shouldn’t be a problem with the right skills).
---
I'm just going to refer to another comment by me. What I wrote to you was pretty dumb now that I had a look at it the day after. I was under the impression that you were smugging for whatever reason.
---
Don't care, if they announce it as part of the eveonline world tour, they should at least have something to say about the available payment methods 
---
Very true, I’m one of those welpers - sure my losses must effect the Merlin market. 
---
I was more just memeing on bots
---
AAR: 
---
Provi forms Bhaals and some megas to try and keep the JB from going down. 
---
Proceeds to welp fleep into 80 machs while loosing the JB in the process. 
---
Maybe one day we can get gud.
---
Sounds more like a hydra tbh
---
&gt;i dont like thing and thus nobody can 
---
Cloaking and not doing anything doesn't 'affect uncountable players', it affects no-one. What affects players is being hot dropped. Do something about cynos and camping isn't a threat.
---
oh 
---
Was he wearing a wizard hat? 
---
Fast and the Furious joke, sorry.
---
Or try moving lots of low volume items that’s cost a lot in something quick and small...like a shuttle!
---
Simpler to purge Omist and Fey tbh.
---
If you weren't poor you would keep your nyx and make a new avatar pilot. 
---
Yeah I was
---
He is already forming for day after's fleet. 
---

Well you can thank papa PL and mama nc. for that. Because they are the whole reason for the south attacking north as Pamfam went on for years bullying smaller alliances for "content" like taking Provi's stations. Many smaller alliances had settled in Provi and allot left after Pamfam took the stations causing those smaller alliances  many losses and where they end up in? Legacy. Why? Because Legacy actually managed to stand up against Pamfam and that was their way to take revenge on what Pamfam has been doing to them for years. So now we're going to return the favor.

And the only proof here was a chat message.

Funny Test doing Goons Dirty work

That's a good thing, it points how disgusting titan proliferation has become and maybe something will be done about it.

Someone just found the beginnings of their new mining empire.
---
Hah was wondering about that. I knew you won't get booted out of your ship if you turn alpha in space and can't fly it. But what would happen if you turn alpha in say in a t1 fitted hac or something equally stupid? So you can't fly the ship but you can use the modules. Can you still activate those modules?
---
same
---
Or make ammo/drones and put them up where people run missions. Mission runners will always buy ammo for more than what it costs in Jita if it saves them running a bunch of jumps to get more.
---
Also make sure you stick to sell orders if you aren't already, buy orders will leave you with no profits.

holy shit you went off the deep end

Best Wormhole Eviction 2018: POSPY. Or it would have been if HK hadn't stepped in right at the end of the year. Although they didn't really fight, so maybe still POSPY.

Don’t be dumb. Horde is considered officially part of Panfam while TAPI has to sleep in the rain.

Good for you guys.

Well, Novakorr isn't banned from the game, so there's that.  
---
You'll notice the same patters now as then: Retards who haven't flown more than 2 clients at a time baying for blood while anyone with more than two brain cells saying that while yes, he's a fucking retard for doing that, it doesn't prove anything other than he typed that while broadcasting, and that running multiple miners is possible without broadcasting.    
---
You'll notice that the ones who actually know what the fuck they're talking about aren't saying "No, this guy 100% isn't broadcasting mining", they're saying "We don't know if he is or not, because nobody wants to take a video and submit it". If you record a multiboxer doing suspicious behavior that you think is broadcasting, send it to me and I can tell you if he is or not.

Roam more space? You are in Delve more than most Goons are lol.

I have always been clear that there's a difference between "Brisc the INIT Line Member" and "Brisc the CSM Member."  I am not part of the meta, I'm not an alliance leader, and while I have fun smugging as much as the next guy and I'd be fine with getting crapped on by folks for that, when I'm trying to do my job, I take it seriously.
---
I have had infinite patience trying to be an advocate for certain communities, and despite that, I've got Capri here actively making things up that aren't true, and other folks who know they've been talking to me and I've been talking to them staying silent, for whatever reason. 
---
I'm not interested in doing that anymore. 
---
I'm not wasting my time getting into a debate with you on an opinion I voiced that you disagree with. There's no lack of understanding here - it's simply my opinion.
---
You want to debate me, come on camera on Open Comms Friday night and we can talk all you want about Eagles vs. Feroxes.

Without a defense fleet you will only annoy the attackers. Two t1 logi ships can easily out rep a raitaru dps. Neut and e war combined with a defense fleet is the better play but watch your cap management.
---
Are they going to disagree with him because they think so, or because you're going to try to find them in game if they dissent against you on Reddit?
---
This seems like a popular copy and paste argument, but how is it not just adding fodder and nonsense to 'still having local'. The only debate that should ever come about is to have or not to have local, adding all this additional bullshit to it won't solve or adjust anything positively. 
---
Jump clones have been in the game for quite some time
---
14000 rubber ducks were stepped on during this track.

---
How exactly makes this argument any sense?  
---
\-Free alphas cannot be played when using multiple accounts (i know there are ways to cheat that, but ppl doing that are also committed enough to just make omegas, as it's more isk/hr)
---
\-few "old" players play even single alpha accounts instead of multiple of their omega alts due to strategic reason (it's rare, but wasn't even an option before)
---
\- The bot situation did not change with alphas (botters, did for sure not grow much, as their activity was always only limited by ccp/their machines and not via the game itself)
---
\-not related to alphas: SP farms are rarely logged into, their PCU contribution is minimal
---
Yes. The agent availability depends only on your standings, it doesn't matter whether it's security, distribution, or mining.
---
isn't that just largescale null conflict though?
---
Neutral logo is a huge issue in high sec.
---
an alpha clone can fly a mostly T2 BS
---
Did your bots get violenced?

yea they will find a way to take everyone's toys away .. good thinking.

It's just so silly how expensive it is now to setup a small base too, and how easy it is to be swatted away.

well they're still ahead by how many faction fortizars?
---
I don't know how much the ihub costs, but the pirate anomaly upgrades cost a total of 1.2B from the my supplier, and 900m for a full set of mining upgrades.  Only a few horde systems would have both sets, but many will have a full set of pirate upgrades.
---
Isk?
---
You don’t lose all your skill points when you blow up.

And even if you did injecting your skills back has severe diminishing returns.

Skill points are incredibly valuable , keep your super and alt, and rat for the ISK you need over time.

i mean he isnt wrong (he's also not in panfam but i think HK?)

I upvoted OP, though I have to say this is not right thing to do to any kid. Eve should not become a comfort zone for him, this is not right. He has to learn how to live with the real people, or he will end up coming to a VR everytime someone gives him hard time in RL. I wish OP has told him that he can only play with him, if he try to find real friend every fucking day, is it at school, or in the neighborhood does not really matter. it could even be his teachers, or the old lady walking out her dog every evening. He also just has to (and I hate being that pushing to 11 years old kid) talk to his parents. Let them know he's playing Eve, let them know he's socializing with some real people online, let them know this makes him happy. But he has to find the way how to be happy in RL. Please, please don't ruin his life by beeing too nice with him in this online game, which you never know when you would stop playing due to your RL issues, and that kid would feel so much hurt if and when it happens.
---
Sorry, I had to say it out loud. i believe I'm doing the right thing by adding little bit of salt to your cake.

Read the last sentence and thought it was some kind of bait post calling the mittani a kid...
---
Shoot me a PM, and for a modest fee, I'll bring down some boys to help defend it. 
---
As for income, it depends on what you are doing. Just hauling it may take a few runs to pay for omega (aka make \~1.5bn), but also lets you exploit null markers which are often more expensive than Jita.  Bit of research and you can supplement your income there. 
---
But, do your research first, JFs alone are expensive, nevermind the collateral (usually more than the value of the ship) if you fuck up and die.
---
Yes, but more importantly "This is REALLY EvE"

That sounds like ghost sites?

That's one way to get to spend time with your father.
---
Downside to expanders is slower align time, and hence slower travel time (compared to nano lows).  Also, be weary about carrying too much isk value with you, above a point and you become a prime target for suicide gankers.
---
Plex?
---
Offline. Side thought, if someone goes alpha in an orca, can you still use the hanger bay? Live in a wormhole with the orca only logging in to give storage?
---
But do you have a jedzero, or brea? 
---
Ferrata is a small corp that has a nasty habit of running entosis in Test sov any time Test is deployed, and likes to stage meme caps in range of Test ratting space.  Naturally, Test does not approve.
---
Presumably, this was a fight about the ferrata citadel that appears on the BR.
---
Also, as dead as stain is, there is a Good Sax keepstar in there somewhere that for some reason has been allowed to live for a year.  I hear it's a freeport, so if you're not aligned against them you can probably stage stuff there and have some fun, you'll just need to dangerzone your JF onto the only NPC station in range of lowsec to get there.
---
Had brought this up a while ago.  Very happy to see this make it into the game!  Great job!
---
I had ALOT of customers every year for AT season. As well as plenty of space bros year round who had to makecshit fit for whatever reason. It was fun as nobody else was doing it on my scale super public at the time. I wonder what happened to the 1200+ BPC'S I had when I sold the character.
---
do you mean a baltec fleet?

&gt; Why would anyone waste 50m wardeccing to kill a caracal?
---
Why did multiple highsec "mercs" waste money wardeccing my alt corp?  From their war history, it looks like they just wardeced a good chunk of the pilots in Jita.
---
And that abuse is why you can't have nice things.  Wanna fix it?  Go shoot them.
---
&gt;the game can barely support what we have right now, it would just give up above 50k

incorrect, servers have handled 63k easily

err, where do you see baltecs anywhere here?
---
Where tf you see XiX there?

Why? We only joined them after a request for help to fight people we hated because test couldn't match your combined numbers, but at that time we could exceed your numbers by ourselves. Picking on the little kid on the playground backfired on them.
---
hai
---
Cute Provi copying the big guys’ doctrines
---
It would probably be a sabre, but as a small time industrialist you don't want to deal with the most high-volume gear, because that's the stuff being competed over by the players with a lot of cash and job slots.
---
You'll want to look at lower volume mechandise where the profit margin is higher so you can still make money being less efficient with alpha skills that affect tax and such.
---
&gt; everything seems to be less profit over time than doing some lvl 3 missions
---
L3 missions are among the worst income activities in the game.  You can make more money flying around warzones collecting loot from wrecks.  Make sure you're manufacturing with fully researched blueprints, in citadels with the correct bonuses.  Virtually everything should be more profitable than your missions.

---
he doesn't have the capital to make that worthwhile. Even if there were a 10% margin on VNIs, he'd have to invest 5b to make half a bil in profit and there's no way he has that cash laying around.  The margin on ammo will completely vanish without trade skills that require Omega.

Never fuck with old money you wouldn't believe the gorillions those Russians have after five years of renting the dronelands.
---
If you try it out or simulate with any success let me know. I mean, I havent played in years but still get nagging questions.
---
I always read the posts they make and watch the videos they present its a way for me to get to know players I've never met who represent different play styles from my own. I've spent time in FW, I've spent years living in lowsec, when I started this game I spent over a year living and playing in highsec, I have nothing against those play styles and do not want them ignored. You assume I do because I am wearing the goon tag, that's your false assumption and its not my problem. And no I don't vote the perfect party line. I vote for who I feel should be there and then if there are spots left over I fill in them with the alliance suggestions my ticket usually winds up being half and half. 
---
Will do, b 
---
well deserved treatment of test imho.
---
I love the assumption that just because goons get handed a list of people to vote for none of us are capable of looking into the candidates ourselves. 
---
I love how everyone just assumes that happens, sure lots of lazy people copy paste, but plenty of them do look into candidates.
---
Nc Dot will be very salty about it.
---
Don't you just love the reddit hive mind?
---
ahh so the solution is to make "rules" for combat that give you a chance? lol
---
do you remember which mods came from where? 
---
No
---
GREAT QUESTION
---
No one has a problem with local being used by players for what ever purposes they have, the thing most 'no-local' people want is to take away the ability for bots to automate a warp out based on someone entering local.
---
You make a very valid point, which is why I'm against taking out local totally. Delayed local would offer all the advantages of what you said, and 60 seconds is enough for hunters to find a bot anyway.
---
Damn alpha alts everywhere. 
---
It's amazing how much people think they know...
---
are the number of contract success or failed ? just asking don't jump on me. is just that it does not say.
---
Hmmm, well you can boosh outta here then =P
---
I doubt it!
---
it's not the line members fault he can't tell the difference between an \*alliance\* and the two largest \*coalitions\* fighting 1 coalition while begging them to not undock supers because when that happened saturday they got face rolled
---
Probably requires a session change. Eve is big on those. So, leave system, dock, etc.
---
[Dirty Lex and the Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zDi-mcMiU)

Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
---
Oh then im retarded then mb
---
That will not lead to people in the game organizing themselves to get a rep elected, it will just make it easier to split their vote. WH's had so many different options to vote for they garunteed their vote would be so split that it was completely meaningless, the same thing more or less happened to lowsec. There's a reason in real elections each party only runs one candidate and that is to avoid splitting the vote in their opponents favor, if you want a meaningful change lobby CCP to hold primaries  with a limit per alliance ticker of how many people can win their way into the main election, you'll still have a large null showing but if the other parts of the game can even ATTEMPT to organize they will most likely get people with a chance of collecting a popular vote on the main ballot.

The BR is \~250 vs. 175 and in my mind it was 200 stukas and \~50 ravens and lets just assume both sides have the same amount of ppl missing on it even tho our doctrines are very low on logi or dont even have any. Turns out it was 80 Ravens and 175 stukas which is kind of the same story i kept telling from the beginning issnt it?! The first engagement was equal numbers with you in hacs and us in stukas - instead of what i thought was 200 vs. 200 it was 175 vs. 175. Now you are you gonna tell me how much stronger cruise ravens are and it changes the whole situation? Let me give you a hint how much impact they had... the ravens killed 1loki in that entire engagement
---
Why you think its 90 bombers short i dunno. That would make it 290 people in the stuka fleet alone following your logic.
---
You seemed reasonable at start talking about evidence and battlereports but im kinda tired of this now and even tho i enjoyed this conversation this will probably be my last reply.

You can always come to aridia if you want we got a group of Nice corp's working togheter as friends

Except for all the times you guys allied with the strongest powers, I.e. 2010-2013, 2015-2016, and now with GSF and co. The only thing that TEST is better at then playing the underdog victim card is allying the strongest people and oppressing all others, QQing when they lose that stranglehold.

---
Bad politician, bad csm, worst user. 
---
The rest of their fleet which escaped isn't on the BR due the fact they did not kill anything, there were about 60 or so.
---
I sold my Sabre BPO for 140b
---
It's just funny how all that lack of instant intel has only made it small scale fight heaven. 
---
Sure there are tons of different aspecs when you go into wspace. If simply removing local like op stated would kill small scale fights then why are there any here since it "kills it".
---
The never being able to find anyone is bullshit you don't need local to find anyone. I love how people think eve is a "hardcore" mmo then reee don't make me hit one button for intel it should be automatically broadcast ed to me.
---
Oh thank God, I haven't seen a Mar5hy post in like 2 days... I was starting to worry the meme was dead.

One of my favorite lowsec games while I was living in Sendaya with Brave was sitting off the undock within range of my Thrasher, align out, blap the pods of our enemies as they warped in to dock, warp myself out then back again. Rinse and repeat.  
---
Frankly one of the things that makes hisec so obnoxious isn't that there are gate camps filled with people ready to get popped by CONCORD for attacking you. This is EVE, you can and will be attacked anywhere. The irritating thing is that once you're attacked, you don't have an absolute right to defend yourself. If you do, you'll be trapped in system until your aggression timer ticks. If you're lucky, you might slip off the gate and bounce to another location in system, but this is actually worse than evading gatecamps in nullsec. 
---
I understand the gate mechanic for trapping gankers in the system so CONCORD can deal with them, but it would be nice if, when you're the target of these gankers, you could do whatever necessary to extricate yourself from the situation without also being penalized. The current mechanic plays out in the gankers' favor, it makes hisec gate camps more deadly, and it does nothing to teach hisec players how to actually PVP.
---
Nice catch! Crane is a BR so wouldn't fit the market hub could be the reason?
---
Only a few drop as mods. Most as BPC's. Very faction specific. Armor/nos/laser/cap etc from Amarr COSMOS, prop/hull/projectile/etc from Minmatar COSMOS, etc. 
---
Would love to get back in game and run a COSMOS industrial crew to farm the shit out of all of it before CCP finally gets rid of those sites/missions.
---
You have become the shitposter you hate.
---
ok so whats the nerf to local then? 
---
i don't even cloaky camp, never have but i can see how unbalanced it would be to nerf 1 without the other. Why can't you?
---
The little Kestrel that could.
---
You have to be doing something really wrong to end up not being able to make a profit selling stuff in Jita
---
Most of the stuff you can build can be sold at a profit even if you buy materials at sell price, even more so if you set up buy contracts...
---
&gt; Literally the evidence (chat screenshots) were posted of Mar5hy input broadcasting. That is 100% proof.
---
The evidence posted was him input broadcasting a chat message, not of him launching 40 bombs at once.   
---
&gt; As far as you being the judge? That is hilarious.  
---
How so? I've used ISBoxer since 2014 and have become quite familiar with it's limitations and abilities. I'm not offering to do CCP's job for them, I'm offering to let you know if you caught one or if CCP's server ticks are making it look like it.  
---
So explain it to him maybe?
---
All non-T2 and non-faction BPO can be purchased from various NPC corps.  Check your regional market.
---
Some BPO are only available from NPC corps which only exist in a certain sov.
---
Example:  Every BPO for armor, capacitor, capacitor warfare, and Amarrian ships, is available in Amarrian space.
---
Upwell structure BPO are sold by members of the Upwell Consortium:  Chemal Tech, Eifyr &amp; Co., Intaki Bank, Mordu's Legion, Ytiri and Zoar &amp; Sons.
---
One oddity is BPO for fuel blocks and a few others that I can't remember:  Thukker Mix.  Technically, Thukker Mix is a pirate corp, and at one time the only pirate corp with offices in hisec (I think there may be others now).
---
Lastly, Outer Ring Excavations (ORE) have some BPO (and skill books) that are only available from their 2 stations located in Outer Ring.
---
Form up your own coalition and fight us. 
---
nope. it implied they cant be the **only** corp in eve to have "fun" because their definition of fun is fucking retarded and the retard that proposed them actually was to fucking tight to realize it.

You don't understand what the CSM is then: advertising. The CSM is what CCP presents to journalists when it's time to talk about why Eve is special. Like the dollar figures regarding losses.

It's not that bad.  Everything happens pretty quickly when 500 people are shooting at each other on each side.

There's not likely to be an actual schedule for discount sales, since that would tend to dry-up any full-price purchases.

Stop trying to make an impact and make an impact, build a reputation in your niche for doing something really well or in a really funny way, and stop following the standard line member path where you have 12 titans but nobody cares.

I guess I mean in the colloquial sense, a referral to "Goons" or "CFC" still refers to the GSF-lead coalition as a whole. Few people will count groups like Bastion as independent of CFC. Initiative is pretty independent, but they are still within the coalition and during block warfare will be considered CFC/"Goons", even if it isn't always accurate. Same with lumping other groups in with "The North" during block warfare. Often the referrals are just used to reduce the number of group names that have to be put in a AAR, as saying every alliance every time would get real old real quick.

@everyone whoever Dumbchinchilla is on reddit have them PM me thanks

Yes, but I have no idea if anything has changed, if the broken missions were fixed, if components were removed from the DB, etc. I last played somewhere around shit. I dunno. I fought in AT6. Quit like a year later. 
---
This is the best idea I have seen. Will take least effort and yield best results. Anyone suggesting adding yet another mini game deserves to be sacrificed to bob and go play framville which has plenty clicking around for your sorry ass.

whats his ingame name I wanna send him some isk

The new hip thing all the cool kids are doing is saying "Toaster-Bath" or "Do Toaster-Bath !", because when your entire existence is getting dunkt on that's all you can really say.

No way to claim said fee from miners on an athanor, so it won't happen.

Bud there is plenty of npc stations and you have to be dumb in putting titans or supers to someone else keepstar.

The skill you're looking for is Transport Ships. You'll need Spaceship Command III and Industry V to train it, along with your racial Industrial ship skill trained to V. You'll fly either a Prowler, Prorator, Crane, or Viator.

Damn that makes it an even shittier proposition than rolling officer stuff as the stats are already nerfy, and the scarcity of components for building the mods in the first place.

You merely adopted the ability to cope with r/Eve toxicity Brisc. I was born into it. Molded by it. I didn't get a friendly comment until I was already a man.

Only if your mom knows who he is, and if the prison has wi-fi.

Doesn't affect me at all.

You will hear me that way when they nerf chain boosh tho.

Welp, looks like exploration is back on the menu
---
thx for the heads up. no luck here still
---
I mean all the other wormhole corps not HK where kinda useless let's remove those. 
---
Like removing ships from the battle report because they where irrelevant seems like a silly way to go about it, as for the missing 90 comment that was off your 200 man bomber fleet ( there where about a 110 on that battle report ) not count command dessie's and other support ships, like removing stuff from the battle report because it didn't perform seems silly then we also need to discount the misclick and at that point well init lost that fight.

Not as hard as your wormhole... sorry ex-wormhole

Maybe, I guess we will find out definitively in a few months. ;)

A single logi ship can do it if the BS are properly tanked. And because the logi only goes suspect, the structure can't even shoot it.

inb4 the kid is actually some sweaty man social engineering his way into OP's corp/alliance to steal their assets in 2 years

As a wormholer, I have no idea what the point of this is…?

Miniluv produces its own ships.

Dunno about CODE guys.

Nestor role bonus: can fit the unnamed module that scans/bombs.

You missed a lot since you've left :)

Join a wormhole corp that mines and produces in wspace, PvP and defense comes with the package.

Nestor would be my choice.  Make a CPU reduction as part of the role bonus for the unnamed module in question.

I made a heat sink with meta 11 DPS numbers and 15 CPU from a trebuchet heat sink, sits on my nightmare atm

Thats not bad at all is it? Im not up to speed really but that sounds good from memory.
---
I’m doing the same thing on an alt. DM me if you’re ustz we can wardec plebs and knock over their sandcastles
---
That would be useful
---
There is a skill called 'Criminal Connections' that might help you get there.
---
I know it seems easy, just got two years of history with my current corp. Just packing it all up and moving is quite a big decision but like I said, I'm not enjoying my current playstyle so I need to do something about that
---
What's the dumpster fire that is the right game? 
---
Not interested in mining anymore, I've done enough, used to be able to sit on grid for hours on end with my accounts, just doesn't do it for me anymore. Will certainly have a look at a few wormhole corps, any you'd recommend?
---
Thank you !

Sorry mate, I'm EUTZ

For the record, being nice to him *is* showing him how to live with real people. Real people can be kind, compassionate, and friendly, just as often as they can be hateful. It's important to remember that. Though he is being bullied, having someone kind to him may be enough to give him a reason to fight through it and persevere, as opposed to giving in and crumpling under the pressure, possibly leading to depression or suicide.

Meh, doesn't really matter where they are - snuff generally bring the cancer with them :)

In order to return to relevance, one has to have been relevant in the first place.

I know that.  I also think that's a stupid reason to have a group like this.  Abolish it.

From my experience, multi boxing supers is unique in that it returns multiplicative enjoyment.
