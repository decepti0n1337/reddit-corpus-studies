No, he has switched alliances just before the fight, it sometimes doesn’t show up that quickly. So did I btw, TRI FTW!

---
---
How about we over complicate everything in the game. CCP wants to retain new players, how about they do so by making needless changes that complicate everything! Why use a control wheel or shortcuts to control a ship instead we should have to type in exactly what we want to do in Chinese. 80's adventure game style.

*fed to tri, centi and therablob
---
Never know with rabbit holes — best hunt I ever had was bringing 70 npsi bombers 7-8 holes deep in and caught capitals ratting. Someone was autistic enough to give me the connections and wait on these krabbers for days.
---
A static that is random...ummmm...errr....
---
Crayons all along my wall.....
---
I don't know m8 I saw 4 caps get fed pretty hard along with a ton of dead nightmares
---
&gt;Shoot first.
---

---
&gt;recruit a super pilot.
---
Uh you have super pilots in alliance
---
I'd say it means complaining about getting blobbed might be hypocritical here since apparently you guys weren't looking for a good fight but for a dunk, but what do I know? 
---
Also, *we* brought CENTI + V0LTA. BB tagged along with V0LTA I believe and TRI showed up to third party, with you being the more interesting target because of nice km's your nightmares would make and the even shinier km's your caps would make. So we were aware of some 40 dessies coming as backup (V0LTA), not of all the other shit that made the battlefield one giant clusterfuck.

I’m not going to pretend to be an expert on space explosions. Or the mathematics behind it..

But shouldn’t the pieces of the object move slower than the shockwave itself?

Of course, I’m not so sure it would explode in a perfect disk either.

Of course, at 29, I’m not so sure what I want to do with my life either..

If anyone knows, I’d love to learn some new space science.

No.

It was V0LTA and a few other Therabois amounting to a total of barely 40 duders. The Bombersbar merge came last moment before we went in, prior to that they were chilling cloaked on a blops literally on the other side of the universe so for sure noone had eyes on them (aside from the fact the addition of bombersbar was fairly unplanned).

So i can only repeat: that dudes intel sucks.

Lol oh there was some bitterness for sure, between Endo Fett and myself we lost quite a bit of our networth on that loss. But after i watched him move around through the corp member list (it shows the location of each member) i tracked him down with a low sp alt and waited in the station where his JF toon was. Once i seen the JF alt leave system i burned my other alt who was the ceo of BombTymers alt over to the station he was in previously. I set up an office so i could check his inventory and thats when i seen about half of the ships, modules, bpc's, materials, and fuel. Once i seen that i grabbed screen shots of everything sent it out to my directors and got things rolling with alliance leadership. With the proof that we had of Bomb being the thief they gave us the go ahead to go ahead with the AWOX. I messaged Cercis and we talked over the phone about how we were going to execute the kill and planned it for the same evening as im sure he was getting ready to leave corp. Later that night we had two fleets running one that was comprised of our HIC's, Titans, and Dreads. The other was our "Roam" fleet. Cercis pinged out for some pews, and we got the bait rolling. Once his Titan alt was in his Titan I messaged Dan Jintao, and Crashnbrun in the secondary comms and said he was in his big toy we are good to go the party started. We landed at our "Mid" and thats when Tevo hit him with the HIC point. From there on we shit on him until his Titan was a wreck. Bombtymer was a good sport, but i we were hoping for some salt from him. God damn millennials. Yes the shit decision was mine to make him an officer in corp but i will learn from this and our corp will grow from the experience.
---
Increasing the frequency of shit decisions will not fix the game.
---
i have no idea what you're talking about so

Perfect.

I have kind of a small screen, so i put my dscan in the top left corner of the screen because i am typically in WH space and it doesn't matter that much. I also had red safety set because i've found that my drones don't always auto aggress when i shoot something in null with yellow/green safety. And there was this astero on the sun decloaked probing something idk what but he had a salvager instead of a cloak.
---
It was a 0.6 system and i'm sure you can imagine what happened next.
---
the real test was the mail server
---
Mmmno. Carebears in holes are just targets for all wormholers. They can't keep everyone out. Most hole rolls are for finding fights. If you make a habit of rolling to avoid them, that'll get noticed and someone will seed you for profit (remember, no asset safety in wormholes -- all that delicious carebear loot is yours for the taking if they can't fight).
---
Thanks for the heads up, so as the attacker there’s no downside to killing an MTU?
---
Too bad they took the video down :(
---
Just losers who can't find real PvP so they shoot inanimate objects for jollies. Most often they'll run away and get a bigger ship if you attack them. Typical bait and switch. Typical bottom dweller of Eve.
---
Orcas mine at around 20m ore/hour, so around 40 hours?

Definitely a long time until you get your investment back, but it's the lowest interaction and safest afk activity you can do.

---
Safety red, attack the dude, heart's racing, and then i get really confused when my cap goes to 0 and I die.
---
Why would they be rarer if you're more likely to win by dropping than before. We intend to turtle even harder where I live. Where we did not drop supers in response before. We do now. Saving anybody is becoming infinitely more difficult. Supers are even more necessary than ever before. CPP does not understand the game or are dishonest about their motives.
---
&gt;Depending on your alliance you may or may not get support defending it.
---
Tough shit.
---
Yeah that comet fit is way better than your 3 rep incursus haha. Usually you have 2 rep on the incursus, and it's a hard fit to play win with.
---
There's a pretty significant downsite, it turns hisec into lowsec for you for 5 minutes meaning anyone can just tackle you and hold you till their friends can come kill you. Or you could mess with the wrong ratter and his Dominix is actually blinged to shit and fit with neuts and you just die impotently.
---
I heard Eve players liked to blow things up.

Whenever a station is unanchored (or destroyed), every item get asset safety. Basically, they get teleported to the closest lowsec NPC station. You then have to pay 15% of estimated value to get the assets back. CCP has been talking about reworking the system because it's a bit too strong, so that might change in the next 2-3 months, but nobody knows exactly what the change will be.
---
Citadels can be anchored in any system except shattered wormholes, so yes, they can be anchored in NPC nullsec. You can anchor an unlimited amount of citadel per system since, unlike POS, they are not attached to a moon.
---
We are to busy eating popcorn and f5:ing this thread for more salt
---
hero of the fight/thread tbh
---
A game with no casual players is a game where you have nothing to shoot at, or anyone to make the stuff you shoot with.  But hey, torpedo the health of the game so you can eat your hot pockets and tell your mom how elite you are while the game dies from lack of subs.
---
Why are you unspoken boys so salty all the time? Total misery.
---
Oh boo hoo, of course you didn’t. Did you expect Volta to actually bring even numbers? 
---
Other than that, I was a little bored and counted a bit. We had ~29 Nightmares and a total of ~44 Subcaps, not counting in Sabres and tackle. That’s what TRI had *on their own*. As you might’ve heard on comms and as it has been stated on this thread a dozen times, fighting you, even with TRI, wasn’t that bad since we didn’t do too horribly. *Even though we were already outformed 2:1 at that point.*
---
The annoying part was getting Volta in. But hey, didn’t want that Sov anyways /shrug
---
So are you in Goons or Test?
---
yes
---
A) wasnt me. 
---
B) weird. I talk to reds in local all the time. Maybe you were just a cunt?
---
Not my corp though. We're actually kind of disjointed as an alliance, which works for us

Had some spider tank rattlesnakes against sleepers, one approached the other that was aligning somewhere. Didn't notice the web, both rattle at 0 cap and shield alert rings up.. No cap for mjd.. 2km away from cap transfer..

Because the ships that can use cynos are more expensive. It may be that it doesn't matter to some groups, but that's the idea.
---
The reason you are more likely to win is because people drop less.

&gt;Saving anybody is becoming infinitely more difficult.

Good.

I was exfilling that machariel from our home wh. I had the out hs scouted, saw the magnate come through, drop probes, and then get super focused on scanning. My machariel lands, takes 15 seconds to lock (CCP BUFF BS SCAN RES PLZ, FOR FUCK'S SAKE) then blap!
---
Looked after, was like a 20 day old character or something. :(
---
Agreed
---
Yeah... but they're super squishy. Bombers are fine.
---
The video got taken down for now so I can’t confirm this, BUT. There were definitely more than just Volta and Therabois warping onto us. And even though the addition of BB might’ve been unplanned, it doesn’t change anything about the fact that they came in with you, as one fleet, as shown in the video. 
---
Ffs, if you want someone to believe that you don’t blob, then tell BB not to come along. Making a fight, you already knew was going to be onesided, even more onesided.
---
A) I didnt say it was you I said SF deserved it. B) You're all weird. And I wish I was just a cunt but nope. I was hanging out while they protected the new Dom Fort as it was coming out of its anchor timer, and was just chatting in local they locked me up with their carriers and set fighters on me. I got away at like 3% hull then they called me a pussy for not wanting to fight their carriers in my cruiser. I called them on their bs in local and again in discord and they had me kicked from Vastly. Every SF member I've ever had interactions with is a shit bag.

Who the hell are these investors they 100% aren't eve players, although I can understand getting pissed about missing skins.  You reddit armchair developers know nothing about making a business
---
Local blackout is a buff to nullsec PvP players and solo hunters.
---
well thats just too bad. i'm sorry you had shiity experiances with us, although, arent you also the guy that made the reddit post shit talking our FC in the Adirain fight?
---
Good.  Like really good.  I'm betting they learned a ton, because failure is a wonderful instructor.  Breaking things can help make them better, so this is probably an excellent result.
---
Indeed. I need to see how much SP is needed for correct mining rates however.
---
Yeah if it's a few interactions per hour, 20m an hour would be very good. Now that I'm starting to think I may run the thing even when I'm not playing eve hard, only needs 66m a day to get a PLEX at the end of the month..

what you don't want your half a trillion assets (faction titans) just getting MJFGed 500km away from your blob with little counter play besides hoping you can scram all the booshers fast enough in TIDI? :P
---
Not that I know of. In my year in Vastly it was only Vastly on ops outside of like 1 or 2 members from SF. Even defending yalls structures hardly any SF ever showed up. I dont know any of your fcs.

Maybe you'd enjoy fleets that pays for your ship? Logi are often appreciated.
---
2billions per ship is really a lot

&gt; Adding chaos is code for I want things harder for ~~nullsec~~people who live in nullsec but easier for ~~my playstyle~~ people who roam into nullsec.
---
There I corrected it for facts.
---
I would rather them test it like this instead of breaking live environments.
---
Dont need evidence. I watched Centi sabres land with Tri sabres. Everybody in TS said that was pretty shit, so when the Azbel lived with 2% structure I said lets drop a dread and finish it off and give Trigg a win after they got mega blobbed. If you dont like that, either stop working with all the "third parties" that show up, or come pvp us about it.
---
Before we saw you working with Tri on top of knowing volta were coming too we were gonna pretty much just stay out of the fight and see what happened. Whether it lived or died was irrelevant to us at that point.
---
I believe that was the point
---
I would rather see the max wormhole timer at 8 hours so they respawn more randomly. It would provide a bit more content that way for both sides of the hole.
---
That's not uncommon for wormholers..
---
No one is forcing you to live on player owned structures. You can keep your stuff in absolute safety in hisec and take all the breaks you want. There should be no mechanics that make your stuff safe without you doing working for it.
---
I was updating one of my alpha alts' skill queue. I was kinda bored, so decided to shoot a miner just because.
---
Warped to a belt, alphaed the guy, got concorded as expected. Grabbed a screenshot of my pod midwarp in the beautiful Amarr space because it looked nice. Next day I posted it on Twitter and CCP gave me 3 months of Omega because I won a screenshot contest contest.
---
Thank you, anonymous miner. And sorry for the venture.
---
I put in a couple draws my losses in this case were either blobs or dwebb frig smashing thru my reps, wasnt good footage. Thanks though I do try to post close and interesting losses.
---
&gt;We had ~29 Nightmares and a total of ~44 Subcaps
---
If that's true, what were the other 43 dudes in fleet?
---
&gt; The annoying part was getting Volta in
---
It's actually the other way around. We batphoned volta (who we thought were only brining ~40 dudes). That 100% happened. We didn't talk to Tri, and didn't know they were in the area until we saw them on grid. The fact that BB and TRI showed up wasn't anything we planned. So yes, you got out formed, but it wasn't something we did on purpose.
---
For much more number wise you guys sure didn't come out that much more ahead.
---
I mean they could know if it was a ccp security employee awoxing lol
---
I didn't find that, ty
---
Yeah true for some reason I thought that one died.
---
damn that was awesome
---
I don't give a fuck about skins. I didn't sign up for the test. What I am, however, is someone who invests his real life money into various companies. Straight up, I would be pulling out of Hadean if I had money invested. So kindly go sit in a corner until you know what you are talking about.
---
Why do I remember the Bergman name ? Was that QFC back in the good ole days?
---
I dont know to be honest
---
Hm. Seems like that was a while ago. But I'm sorry bad shit happened to you
---
No please don't do this. You should not NEED to have a certain number of alts to own supercapitals.
---
&gt; If you dont like that, either stop working with all the "third parties" that show up
---
We only used the batphone we got *from quiet*. We didn't know tri was even in the area. But who am I kidding, you're just going to ignore everyone saying that anyway. I don't really understand why quiet is so determined to be butthurt about something that didn't happen. And better yet, instead of hitting up one of the diplos, you just made an assumption and had a fit about it.
---
Non PvP players should be banned from making posts about PvP.
---
"Wormhole daytripping?"   
---
lol, your solution to nullsec isk making is go into a wh.
---
Sadly it is an unpopular opinion that empire building is awesome.
---
Who cares?
---
maybe not yet, but it affect game in future. krabbing is good activity when there is no war or NO fucking conflict driver, because CCP is killing all conflict drivers
---
But, you don't have money invested....
---
fuckin sociopath
---
Eve isn't full of space scientists.
---
Not currently, I expressed myself badly, those factors have been doing so for the past few years... some momentary deficit doesn't sounds so bad tbh.
---
That is great but people shouldn't claim nullsec has only received buffs when its easy to prove that sentence is bullshit.
---
we rat in capitals because it takes years of skilling to fly capital. and that changes with skill injectors, so WTF you should even thing about subcap ratting? and as well CCP killed lucrative 6/10 smartbomb ratting with expensive faction fitted BS...
---
I to like old EVE mechanics.
---
yup true, subcap ratting was shit. only reason for subcap ratting is that it can be semiafk like it was with VNI, gilas, ishtars.
---
i don't actually agree with your assessment. I think carriers will still be viable you just have to accept that if you get tackled you are gonna die. This means sebos over nsa and staying aligned/ having an out cyno/beacon ready.

They could have just changed the name to "tobacco" or something in DayZ and been fine, because tobacco is completely safe and with 0 side effects and costs to health, or it wouldn't be legal would it? 😂

Unless I'm way off, this is seriously an option for copies sold here, change of a texture and name in the game, very easy fix.
---
Quality post right here.  Not even a shitpost in my book.
---
Can't have that, how else can WHers be elite and close access to their home? CCP even made a ship mod to allow WHers to use an exploit legally after they changed an unintended use for heavy interdictors.
---
because local give them false feeling on safety, without local they just disappear from space. what is win for game? not that what ccp did

Ik m8 that's why my post is going to get down voted into oblivion. Making 500 mil an hour while being safe is not OP at all

Ratty knows everything, was waiting for "got a mate...." 😁
---
Ships should do nothing on their own. You should be space rich with dread in c6 because it's hard and dangerous and you should eat shit with your carrier in anomaly as it doesn't require any brain to operate. No amount of isk investment should lead to good profit without a player being actually good.
---
Why?
---
Did CCP remove them? Since when?
---
&gt;actually think carrier

Align out and use fighters?

haha that guy always fly wolf or other frigate class  lol imagine his sorprise every time he find a carrier bigger than him on zize
---
Okay, so even if we stick to what you're trying to say. You had you + Volta ready to work together to win the fight, and suddenly Tri comes in with a ton of dudes with nobody knowing, and Centi was never going to go in because Tri might kill them too, until Tri asked for help because of triage. So of course Centi says yes Tri, lets shoot them together and we have V0lta as well, dont shoot them either. So your alliance at some point worked with all those groups to make sure they wouldnt shoot each other in a 3:1 fight. Correct? And you managed this all within a few moments? Because all three fleets were shooting only Trigg dudes. At absolute 0 point in that engagement could you have said "Nah Tri we got this already on our own"? Why is that? Because you thought your Azbel might have died without them being on your side?
---
OP succes i guest hahahahahah
---
There's no point talking to quiet, they will just spin the story to what ever they want and bad post on reddit about it. Just get used it, they are pros at burning bridges.
---
The best way to kill MTU's is to find AFK ones.
---
Plus if the owner has a bounty on him you get that also.
---
I have killed 100's of AFK MTU's and been killed when I when suspect maybe twice. No one comes to save random persons stuff.
---
And oh the salt you will get when you pop someones can for 500,000,000 isk.
---
Definitely down for way more wormhole spawns. You really can't "stop rolling" without getting rid of mass limits. But you can make it a significant pain in the ass to roll/crit them.
---
Might be a little bit biased
---
Imagine being so triggered about getting blobbled you suicide a cap almost as much as worth as the objective.
---
Same here. The big stuff is what I find fun.
---
We didnt get blobbed, we never even formed. But good try.
---
Yeah. It would mess with the lore. But just having all wormholes have no mass and only allowing c5 and c6 wormholes to have caps jump in and out would be easy enough
---
PepeHands can't blob in Chinese TZ PepeHands
---
What drones are you using? And what ship? Rattlesnake gets a big buff to drone HP and DPS. Some NPCs have a hard time breaking a gecko’s shield when it’s being controlled by a Rattlesnake.
---
Tribute lacks natural salt mines you see having no big blocs. So in order to sufficently salt our fries, it has to be insourced
---
If they got blobbed who cares? Are you the anitblob police? Who cares centi or whom ever killed TRIGG? I'm not sure why you got so triggered over someone getting blobbed and deciding to suicide a dread just to say fuck you?
---
Meh the good imp fit has blasters btw
---
Yes, we are the anti blob police
---
At that point it's just closer to nullsec with gates that take you to ???. Mass is pretty important and the reason WH meta is so much different than kspace. But if holes regularly had 5-10 open connections, a lot more content beside krabbing to be had.
---
Imagine being so triggered about someone else getting blobbed you suicide a cap almost as much as worth as the objective.
---
Wake me when it works and goes in game. Then I'll test it out.
---
You're doing a very bad job at it just to let you know.
---
It's just an inconvenience, you do get that if a game developer wants to discourage behavior ( for example super blobs ) making it inconvenient is a great way of going about it. 
---
Like for example if I roll enough alts I could know every system ( well except for wormhole space and null-sec ) real-time player count along with track people, yet it's very inconvenient to do so, now if you said to me let's add it to the API given the information is already there i would be like fuck no because then it becomes convenient enough for people to do it.
---
It's too common for people to use the argument of a QoL fix only to realize behavior impacts down the line.
---
You run them in a large group. It’s an incursion basically.
---
Solo ships will he vaporized.
---
If its so perfectly safe and so easy why aren't you doing it? 🤔
---
Ik m8 I'm just memeing
---
I am...
---
I know but I really liked part of it :( I want it to be.
---
Taking the day off of work to test a system for someone elses company. I'll pass on that.
---
Oh, so wait, I could've actually tackled this guy without worrying about getting Concorded?  I didn't attack him b/c I suspected he was trying to get me to initiate and thereby also flagged by Concord.  If I see this happen again I'm in the clear to defend my MTU?
---
I've thought for a long time that it would be interesting if carriers were used for uh...carrying ships? It would be like a titan bridge but the carrier HAS to go with and the ships start out effectively docked in the carrier hull. This would mean smaller non-titan owning groups could project some power in a similar way to the bigger groups. Probably matters less now that anyone who wants to own a titan can...
---
I would like more connections as well tbh. Not 5-10 but 2-3 would definitely  be nice. Maybe have those connections be a little more random as well.
---
Did they change T5? I heard you can do them in 3b gilas or 1.5b vagabond and there's not much risk of dying. And it's about 200m/h so not that lucrative
---
It runs pretty close to perfectly (save for slightly degraded performance compared to the native launcher and the inability to use external links) on Steam through Proton now.
---
If their color is read but you aren't shooting each other, you're still blue. TRI wasn't there to third party, they were there to save an Azbel.
---
We are all sailors
---
who?
---
This is eve.
---
Some decent ideas. I'm totally on board with the rat scrams.
---
 We already have "random" holes to an extent. What exactly do you mean by that? As a hunter, more connections = more content, so I could be on board with that.
---
As far as the "no rolling" part. Do you mean having no mass restrictions on holes? Meaning if I find a Very Large hole, i could just jump an infinite amount of caps through it? Honestly, that would actually make wormholes safer for ratting. The best way to catch ratters is to rage roll a C5 static until you roll into someone mid site. But without rolling, i would just anchor some bubbles around my connections and drop a scout alt on them. I wont have to worry about people rolling into me. It would actually be pretty comfy.
---
A better suggestion would be to allow rolling, but make k162 sigs not appear for a certain amount of time (10 minutes?). Then people wont even know when you roll into them. Content galore!
---
whatd i ever do to you huh cephy?
---
More like pros at burning Azbel.

I was memeing for most of this. I thinking we wanted to change home rolling in anyway ccp would just put a hard limit on how many caps can go through c5 AMD c6 holes. For the random wprmhokez I mean having 4 or 5 always up (if you roll it (If rolling is still a thing) then it auto respawns even if you dont scan it down or jump into it.) No wormhole would ever be safe if that was the case and would forced people to work together.
---
Where are you trying to still them?
---
The usual practice for making actual money is to take the goods to a trade hub, or some other place where you know there will be lots of buyers.
---
i agree but it is technically incorrect because they are red : ^)
---
also according to TRI they were here to third party until trigg dropped faxes, but you'd need to talk to them because I'm not them
---
Once he goes suspect for attacking your mtu, you can shoot him, but then he can shoot you without be concordokened either.
---
&gt; So of course Centi says yes Tri, lets shoot them together and we have V0lta as well, dont shoot them either.
---
Idk why Tri didn't shoot volta. Like, I literally don't have an answer as to why that was. Perhaps it was a last-minute convo between FCs. Not everything has to be set up in advance.
---
&gt;At absolute 0 point in that engagement could you have said "Nah Tri we got this already on our own"?
---
What were we going to say? "Nah, you guys don't get these kills because we don't need you anymore"? That's absurd. Besides, we did need them to break the triage trigg brought. Without tri, we wouldn't have broken their reps. Same for the active tanked dread.
---
When someone is helping you with something, you don't tell them to go away the second you don't need their help, especially if that means the would miss out on the rewards. Don't be dumb.
---
Agreed, for my money a dress is infinitely more useful than a marauder.
---
Objective? We didn't think there would be a fight. We weren't going to throw 18 machs at like 30 nightmares (which is a decent matchup for them) with Centi bringing the world's most useless fleet comp against a pile of battleships with 2 large smartbombs per ship.
---
FUCK I slept through it.
---
Get yourself a goal, even if its just "be filthy rich." Playing in the way you do will lead to further disappointments as possible playstyles changes. They always do.
---
and pros at feeding a nagl =)
---
You realise the systems in chain may be 1-100 light years apart?
---
Yeah it is a nice playstyle, but people are mad because the focus on this playstyle for the last 4 years has forced most others into the dumpster.
---
Please never type again.
---
You want to play the game so that you can continue playing the game.   
---
Get yourself and goal. Eve's better that way, and you won't be reliant on the current FOTM playstyle.
---
Thank you for the good post.
---
Yes strawman him cause his only suggestion of what you could do is go to wspace. 
---
Then again Brave lel
---
When I did it I wouldn't call it afk but it was more then chill while i watched movies.
---
Yet emotionally invested enough to suicide a ship to destroy it. Please just man the fuck up and say you wanted it dead from the get go. No one is going to be mad at you for being dicks and risk averse. It happens to literally to any entity in eve that gets blobbed.
---
Well if you are right, i'd definitely be willing to trade some pve safety for the chances at extra pew. 
---
I think the biggest problem I would have with it is that sometimes your static just ends up in a dead chain. You would have that chain for days, it could end up pretty boring.
---
Shutup you dumb BOT repping fucktard.
---
Maybe nothing. The money supply is immense. Inflation must be reduced. It wasn't always this way.

Pretty funny this centi sabre  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78505879/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78505879/)  died exactly when Tri started getting kills, and that he was the one who landed with another Tri sabre who both missed their bubbles and had to burn at the nightmares, where the Tri sabre cloaked and lived and this guy just kept burning in for more bubbles. But of course they werent working together until later on in the fight, not at the very start, so clearly this lossmail is faked.
---
Your the only ones butt hurt that’s why you keep posting. Put another Azbel up, if you don’t care, maybe we will help you in the future.
---
Imagine being in BOT
---
How does that have ANY relation to the this situation? If you're going to strawman, AT LEAST try to strawman properly.
---
lol, a decade later and your still here.  Clearly they're doing something right haha
---
Nag are build to be feed. It is the circle of life doing his job.
---
You know your argument is very weak when you resort to straw man right?
---
Lol, goon crying about bad caps that make things impossible to kill... That's something new.
---
I suppose, too bad your nag pilot was so triggered about someone else being blobbed they forgot to go in a clean clone.
---
Kk.
---
My bet is on the try hard tacticool Navy Nuke that will never be in an ops/attack center.

Federation Navy Comet, safe choice for making dank, by the book FW kills, well done.

https://zkillboard.com/kill/70855694/
---
Came back after a break and forgot that I was in highsec and decided to try and kill someone who was afk on the station I undocked from and woops concorded.
---
idk what you are smoking but i never said anything about not blobbing. yes we blobbed you and we fragged you off the field despite your faxes. deal with it. the numbers mentioned were still wrong. what they had eyes on wasnt 60 volta, it was 40 dudes with less than 30 being volta and what landed on you later was over 100 because of the merge with bombers bar.
---
I don't know why you think you have any reason to comment. Please just biomass and quit the game.
---
You mean "ad hominem  but you're not denying being in BOT. So I suspect you're not particularly well educated.
---
Your missing the point.  The cap goes through the wh chain not jumping like a normal cap cyno interaction.  
---
More a reduced mass quick travel through a chain then say jumping from jita to kinakka
---
Here's a better idea... Since the Trigs and the Drifters are out hunting in groups now. How about the Sleepers stop just loitering in their Sigs waiting for someone to come kill them. How about they start attacking ships and Citadels as well. Eviction notices all around!
---
That it is
---
Step 1 and 2 are the same thing? You're meme'ing wrong.
---
And how are you to decide that? Who is anyone to decide what I decide to do in eve. Are you the content curator of eve? Do you decide what anyone does in eve? Get the fuck off your high horse and remember we are all people playing a video game. Go get a beer or something and chill. You might be TOO invested in space pixels.
---
It's really telling that your reply mentions my 'sneering condescension' with its own sneering condescension. It seems as though you are purposefully avoiding discussion and are searching for something to distract with, perhaps looking for a line of discussion where you have better footing.
---
Either the thief that grifted his way to stealing a corps assets, or the guys who decided to be lying pricks to awox the thief.
---
You 'suspect' it's almost as if people don't have alts and do other things in eve, or even worse, have contacts to tell you things. Wow, shocking. Now please go back under the bridge you came from and behave like a normal human being when you return back to the surface.
---
You don't even have the Shitppsting skillbook *injected.* Get out of here with this trash
---
anyone who wants to have fun with their super, would have a dedicated toon for it anyway
---
Anyone who is suggesting RNG for gatejumping or Cynos isn't terribly bright, to be honest. That's a fucking horrible suggestion.
---
The person who attacked the MTU has to wait for the owner of the MTU to attack them before the attacker can attack the owner without the attacker being concorded. 
---
The owner must attack the attacker first, otherwise RIP attacker.
---
However the attacker could have neutral logi on standby, therefore baiting the owner into attacking the attacker, and the owner would get into an unwinnable fight. 
---
It's basically the same idea as people trying to bait fights by stealing from wrecks in mission sites, only instead of stealing from a wreck, the attacker/bait is attacking a MTU instead.
---
I know I rep an alt in BOT when I'm on reddit.
---
That makes logical sense. Stfu and get out of here
---
Quiet cried about the fact that our sabre *landed on grid at the same time as tri*, and we're the ones butthurt?
---
We used a batphone that quiet gave us, and tri showed up on their own, and apparently that's some horrible travesty for quiet.
---
Literally biomass.
---
It's almost as if people can choose a name at will and hide other alts at that. Dude, stop smoking what ever you are smoking, use logic, there are many reasons why people name REDDIT names as is. Why are you so triggered that some rando on r/eve is shit posting (or bad posting).
---
We knew it was going to be a blob fest the only unknown was Tri TBH. We were going to stay out and let you guys defend your structure knowing that Volta was coming should be enough right...
---
&gt;With blackout you have zero counterplay
---
How? Rat in systems where you can dscan both gates and then just keep the probe window up. 
---
Nobody except the sweatiest of nerds is going to camp you out, and if they do then jesus just go for a walk for 45 minutes and come back.
---
I don't think Blops are in a bad spot. Not every ship needs to be great at direct PvP, and it has one of the strongest utility modules in the entire game in the form of the Covert Jump Portal. People would still use Blops if it had two high slots which could only fit a cloak and a jump portal, so I think as long as it isn't actually worse than its T1 equivalent its fine.
---
In any case I bid you farewell, I shall end my 'discussion' with you before I catch spod brain from you. Cheers o7.
---
You think fighters are like drones, don't you?  You don't know what you are talking about, do you?
---
How does that work for fleets, if one person in the fleet aggresses does the rest of the fleet become open to attack too?
---
I assume logi will get flagged if they help, but not sure about bystanding fleet members.
---
This isn't about my entitlement, it's about why I think the idea of changing how cynos work is a great idea (Notice the title of the original post). It's obviously a good idea because, you guessed it, they're changing how cynos work! I hunted before blackout and cyno changes and I'll be hunting long after these updates. I totally expect null dwellers, especially those in goons, to only drop overwhelming force, that's not my "choice" as you put it. Goons is a PvE corp that doesn't like good fights, only shooing potential content away with their supers and titans. Even that is perfectly ok because EVE is a sandbox, if you want it and it's within your power to do so, you should go out and try to make it happen. You have this idea like I'm angry about the lack of ability to hunt before blackout and cyno changes. I literally found frags before 6 months ago and a couple days ago so it really makes no difference to me. I'm very excited to dunk cyno fit recon ships actually. It's going to be great. Is it my desire each time I go out that someone brings something engage-able? Of course, because that's my play style and there's nothing wrong with that. But you're acting like I am on /r/EVE telling you to ONLY BRING SUBCAPS OR I'M GOING TO BE ANGRY! That's where you're incorrect when it comes to my motive. I'm sure it's your desire to hop in a ratting/mining ship and go about your business uninterrupted. But we can't both have everything we want, can we princess?
---
As we are on highway of nerfing caps and buffing subcap fleets. This certainly would be a welcome change.
---
Just sit with gates in dscan range or use an alt and just watch the probe window. 
---
Null is just now having to do exactly what wormhole ratters have been doing for years and somehow it's impossible for the elite gamers of null.
---
Completely facetiously every time I've seen it
---
I remember that guy, he got kicked from phorde for shitting up discord and pinging directors over trivial stuff. Nice job on the awox!
---
This is already fixed. The difficulty comes in not getting ninja-salvaged.
---
T3Cs are a gimmick ship anyway. With the proper subsystems, you can essentially pretend to be any of the other T2 Cruiser roles. If you want to be a HAC, you're a HAC. If you want to be a Recon, you're a Recon. But in exchange for flying a Swiss Army Knife... you lose SP if you die in the seat.
---
So if you're dying, be sure to eject before it pops. Or don't die.
---
But like you have 18 solo kills between your 2 accounts since 2012. Doesn't add up to me, unless you linked the wrong killboard. You say it limits the people you have to hunt and I say I've found plenty of targets. 1 anecdote for another. We could go back and forth all day but time will tell if this game can get back to a healthier balance of PvP and PvE. I'm guessing you'd like to have more targets to hunt and I'm right there with you on that one. But you gotta admit CCP had to do something or the game would just turn into Farmville. If these changes seem too ridiculous, maybe they are in the short term, but it might also provide valuable metrics for CCP to know what comes after these changes. The age of nearly 100% safe PvE should be over in my opinion.
---
Kinda hope one day payed clones will come back.
---
Their Athanor just got reinforced in the same system. About 1 day, 15 hours from now. So round 2?
---
 Lol at the downvotes to that.  The salt is real.  There is lots of it.  And it is tasty.
---
If anything, I'd be up for an extra line of T3D in parallel with the existing four. 
---
I don't want Pirate BCs. There's Navy BCs already. Filling out every hull size cheapens the idea of specialised Pirate ships. There's no Navy _or_ Pirate destroyers. If you had to put them anywhere, it's there.
---
decreasing it won't either.  It was already broken.
---
THey built Empires in space.  Goons won.  everyone asked for a reset.  We are getting a reset.
---
Yep!
---
pretty sure you lose SP even if you eject. If you were the last pilot of a T3C destroyed in space you lose SP. (pretty sure)
---
I was thinking a new type of wh one that spits you in several different locations before closing say after a B mass, 5 B total after you clip the first B exit changes based on where it goes if you short  it it has 5 potential exits . so if you rage roll it it can appear in 5 different places . also if you close it on the wrong side (the side it did not start on ) you can keep it going as in 5 b mass from the k162 side, going to 5 new places , great for wh corps great for Null corps with a hot gang concept, great for a highsec crew willing to stretch their legs . just an idea not a sermon
---
It was just a Thrasher, you could have killed him if you were in anything bigger than a cruiser.

very true, i just don’t see the need for the extra hit to the training que, welp

Fair enough. I agree that empire building was oppressively OP compared with other playstyles. I just don't like how people who enjoy that playstyle are demonised.

I suggest you look at Goonswarm's super losses, but also get a bottle of rum or whiskey first.

lol sorry i didn't take 10 minutes out of my day to write a paragraph refuting every baseless thing he said in a 2 sentence shitpost. "Then again brave lel".

So that somehow invalidates everything i say (talk about a logical fallacy).

T3 ships are strong.

Just build them and sell the item

well yeah, we lived in tenerifis in 2018
---
do you think any of us legitimately have connection to any sov we own
---
&gt; Where are you trying to sell them?

&gt;

&gt; The usual practice for making actual money is to take the goods to a trade hub, or some other place where you know there will be lots of buyers.

im at Nein Where do you recommend me to sell them?

“Ages ago”, before T3s got nerfed ? Tengu for example is slower and has less tank than pre 2018... previously they were god like
---
I brought a drake.  Forgot to put ammo it in.  Went as expected.
---
The distance of space between groups should serve as a punishment of sorts for bluing everyone within 3 regions. Let alliances that do that wither away and die because their members can't find any content. 
---
Drifter holes at least have some interesting restrictions and challenges to them, but they functionally already allow you go all over the place in terms of nullsec in specific ships. 
---
If we let goons just roam out of Delve every day to anywhere in the Galaxy via wormholes, then they just get rewarded for bluing and burning everything around them until there's nothing left but friends dead space.
---
Pretty sure the current change to Drifter Wormholes does exactly this...
---
It still makes sense in the context of a static. There would *always* be a wormhole that goes to a random place. You can roll it and treat it like normal.
---
For my sanity, I'm going to assume you are trolling. 
---
In case you aren't, wormholers have non-aggression pacts? Holy fuck that's news to me.

actually this is my account lol

I 100% completely agree.
---
" Doesn't add up to me " Or you just have no idea what my play time has been like. I have been back to the game for a year. Spent 3 months in the war as soon as I came back, took a month off after putting in well over a 120ish fleets in 90 days, deployed with a squad for the next several months, got a one month break to rat to put together some cash for the next war, went to war again, came back, spent 2 weeks not playing due to drifter BS, went on vacation and came back again, I've had maybe 2 months to hunt since I got back to the game in June 2018.
---
\&gt;  I was super tired but 
---
Nothing good starts this way.
---
I took a 7 year break after they shit the game up for Incarna. I've been back a year and I'm already wondering how long this go round will last, so clearly they aren't doing much right.
---
Its really not if you listen to something besides the reddit narrative on goons.
---
I admit I shouldn't use the term 100% to describe something figurative. But PvE is too safe. 80-90% safe. =-p
---
it's my industry alt corp
---
What’s your main then lol
---
The person shooting the MTU gets the suspect flag. Anyone can shoot that person freely. Fleets do not really have much to do with timers, just boosts and cynos and you get a fancy fleet channel. Once you attack someone that has a suspect flag you both receive a limited engagement timer and they can shoot you back. You can have a limited engagement timer with multiple people at the same time. There was a recent change to logi and providing reps to someone that has received a limited engagement timer will result in a criminal flag unless the logi also has a limited engagement timer against that third-party, MTU shooter, as well.  If the logi's safety is not set to red that logi will not be able to rep you
---
Try not pissing off literally all of your neighbors next time fam.
---
Why sit on a gate when the npc's wont scramble you? Theres traffic on gates. People will steal. 
---
Since when did the npc follow you in warp? I do run the random spawns and this is how I do not die, they do not follow. Most of the time you get a spawn, kill it and while killing it another spawn comes in. Usually. Sometimes you get spawn 3-4 and 5 at the same time. When that happens, you hit warp, and its usually instantly because they got webs out the ass on you. Ive must have done this hundreds of times now, not a single time did the spawn follow. But what the fuck do I know?

---
imagine being this retarded to believe this
---
Silly question, but have your blueprints been ME researched to a reasonable level?
---
not mine, but one of my friends got dunked on by NPCs while in a Tengu.
---
Neutral logi get concorded for repping suspects now.
---
Even as someone living in a WH, I'm not a fan of how easy it is to roll a wormhole.
---
The local hub is your bottom price. If you can't sell at Jita, meaning the bottom cutoff and fastest swinging market, then perhaps try selling them somewhere further from Jita, like another hub, preferably a mission hub. I sell stuff a bit far from Jita, and it's slow going, but I make 150-200% Jita price.  
---
Don't bother using blueprints that aren't, at least, maxed on Material Efficiency, because you will always compete with Jita's prices, which often, are at the VERY edge of breakeven, and if there is a gap, there is some industry person or someone with PILES of what you're making that will just undercut you 1000 times.  
---
So, with that in mind:  
---
Build away from Jita. It's expensive, just about anywhere within a few jumps of a hub.   
---
Sell away from Jita if you can. It's a lot less hectic, and people WILL buy your stuff if you're along a decent route.  
---
Use max ME blueprints at a minimum. Research them yourself or buy them. Starting capital is high, but if you combine Industry with another money-making activity, you'll quickly notice a bigger wallet when combining it with cycles of your industry slots. Doing Industry as sole income is STUPID slow.
---
Get into T2 stuff ASAP, because that's where the good stuff starts. The gaps on T2 are always flexing and being manipulated, and most folks are buying T2 over T1 all day long.  
---
If it's hard to transport, people -will- pay more for it if they need it and don't want to make a trip for it.  
---
Ships might seem like a solid choice for selling further out, but only if what folks need with it is available there as well. Otherwise, not many fools will fly an empty ship BACK to a hub to outfit it. They'll just pay a better price at Jita and get better price modules there as well.
---
Marauders are borderline OP, but suffering from diminishing returns. You say this is a problem with marauders, I say this is a problem with capitals not following the rule of diminishing returns.
---
People that enjoy fights usually don't want capital shit. At least my circle of friends roam to get subcapital engagements. I have no desire to rack up cap kills.
---
What happened to the new ore that appeared with triglavian invasions? Rakovene for example. It doesn't show up in market anymore.
---
oh look another "*game is too hard for me, make it easier reeee*" post
---
This was many years ago but I still think about it sometimes. I was in lowsec in a broadsword, heavy tackle for a fleet in the system next door. I tackled a hurricane shooting rats in a belt. I realized quickly that this was a new player with a terrible fit, and he didn't have enough DPS to break me, but I had just enough to kill him even in the low DPS broadsword. I didn't tell my fleet mates that I had tackle and instead took like five minutes to kill him solo. Poor lil fella

De nada
---
Just make it 100 runs
---
the point still is that there are far better ways to make more isk. the belief that anoms are the only way to make isk is absurd. its not even being risk averse anymore, its just being lazy to the point where you don't care if anoms are safe or not, you just rat in anoms because they're the most convenient. literally having an alpha alt in an incursion group is safer and makes the same amount a carrier would.

Never argue with an idiot, they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. Based on reading this, Valk has YEARS of experience on you.
---
You know how cancer it would be without damage caps in 2019? 
---
You need how many cap dreads to hit damage cap on a fort? Capt that I can find is about 15k after resists? Like 3? 4? 
---
If you drop 40 dreads then it'd take how long?
---
Some structures have way more than that on the kills so you can get pretty degenerate with how many caps goons can field.
---
Flair baited then
---
Why would you, as a PvP fella, spend tens of billions on rorq pilots and fits and join some alliance to be a carebear in, instead of spending your isk on pew?
---
You're right about counting cap injectors it was the only example I could think of.  Thanks for your input regarding the drones.  Mixing drones is akin to task organizing in the military.  The idea is to create a combination of unit types (talking military) to mitigate the weaknesses of other units.  It's the same as composing a fleet of different doctrines.   Thanks for your input.
---
Me? Nope haven't been an E4 since '85, lol.
---
F. I remember reading about your imp loss only a month or so ago.
---
Say I wanted to have a "career" in eve of scanning down ships in NS or WH space.  How do I accomplish this for a corp that I'm not a part of? You know, like, give me 40mil isk/hour and I'll scan your space and provide constant updates, go where you want, support how you want, etc?
---
That's also a full production application
---
It makes a lot of sense of you know how industry with in this game
---
Simpler times, eh?
---
Thanks for the reply.  I saw a video of Suitonia in an 800 dps Eris melting a cynabal in 10 seconds (I counted).  So, that would work if I can get into point-blank range.  
---
Relaxing the "new player" constraint, how could I take a cynabal down solo.  Like, is a T3 destroyer option, maybe?  An assault frigate?
---
Not quite.  I write this way because it's what I'm used to I suppose.  Bottom line up front, plain language etc.  Besides I taught small unit tactics at USMA using games for about seven years so I'm used to breaking things down.
---
It's the second?! Yup, pack it in boys
---
One grade higher, but retired since 01.
---
Lol, no reason to hide it, SFC.
---
Lol, not quite.  If I had to put it in Eve terms I was a Minmatar tube and rocket artillery (not autocannons).
---
The closest thing to this is either getting escalations that you can sell to people or scanning down very difficult sites and selling the bookmarks to people that don't have the skills to do so. Everyone in NS knows someone that can scan the shit they cant find and everyone in WH space can already do it without paying someone else. And 40m/hr is laughably high for something that anyone can do without much training in an old game.  
---
There is a rescue alliance that helps people trapped in WH space though, maybe they are your type of thing?
---
Got confused for a sec because the Atlas background music is going and this fit too well with it.
---
Then put back in conquerable stations.
---
Thanks.  The advantage of a cloaky ship is you can quickly reconfigure your drone group while you are waiting or approaching the tgt.
---
I hate to be devil's advocate here, but they do cost several times as much as their ship-class counterparts. Not to mention, many times they just can't perform the same in fleet fights. They just have very specific uses which include anti-capital, which is all people seem to care about at this point.
---
sotiyos are mostly titan's or carriers 2k off and ccp looks set to just remove them at this point.  
---
there rewards are to easy to steal out from under the runner and the fleets are damn near impossible to fight against.  
---
so mite as well just remove them for that list.
---
The Problem in the article is that the Marihuana ist used in dayz as medicine. But well Morphium ist worse then Marihuana and most seem fine there...
---
I run two med and one small neut.  Ok well at least I was on the right track.  I think I will organize my drones as you and other suggest.  With that being said no one has mentioned light drones.  I'm wondering if I should even carry them.  I suppose fast lights would be useful unwebbed tacklers. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Check out ammamake and the surrounding ammar / minmatar fw zone
---
Thank you!
---
Did you miss the link I posted, where someone already proved you don't lose SP just a couple months ago?
---
Lasker and blights wretch are fantastic for current lowsec frigates
---
Give t3 battleships native adaptive resists, like the RAH but perhaps toned down a bit.
---
Thanks.  I plan to roll in the Astero for a bit.  The other night I killed some poor explorer who immediately started cussing at me in Russian (I live in Odesa Ukraine very familiar with Russian cusswords).  I had a few comments myself, not very diplomatic.  In that situation I ambushed from a perch.  My decloak tactic was to simply decloak in warp.  I waited for him to start hacking a new container so he'd be preoccupied.
---
It would go a long way towards solving the cancer that is structure spam

Y U abuse all dem words? Say U sorry.

Brand new to T3C's, fairly new to PvP with some risk. Stole a blingy hunting fit and welped it into a rattlesnake.
---
The aren't that isk expensive.
---
Give me my caldari x minmatar crossfaction.
---
the thief
---
Reddid narrative has nothing to do with goons being the main pile of caps so it's funny to see how you fall into your own trap
---
Doesn't the popup still claim you will lose SP?
---
what incursion group wants an alpha, are you soaking other peoples incursions?   
---
I don't think ~~anyone~~  most people who super rat thinks its the only way in the game to make isk. "better" is such a funny word to use because its so subjective.  ratting gets done not because it is the highest isk/hr but because its easy and accessible for players at every level. we've been telling new bros for ages to get into a vni because its the best way for a new player  (with low sp and actual game knowledge) to make money with a low initial investment. was it the absolute best isk/hr thing they could've been doing to make isk? No, but it was the most accessible. ratting in supers under an umbrella is good because its safe, and makes good isk/hr for the level of setup and time commitment. There are plenty of people in null sec making allot of money  doing other things including indy and incursions which utilize caps and are hurt by the  cyno changes.
---
It feels like u know the pain of being dropped on by multiple carriers. Its ok the pain will go away sooner or later 🤣
---
Great thanks! I think I'll try an MWD at some point.  If they are capped they should be able to get away thus no need to worry about a scram (my escape).   Thanks for the fit I'll take a look at it.  The goal eventually is to be in a Loki or Legion.  I figure I'd use the Strat as a stepping stone first, then jump into a T3C.  
---
I think another way to get experience is to mix target difficulty types.  For example ratting ships are probably the easiest targets in terms of knowing how they are fit, what they are tanking, etc.  While a pvp fitted ship would be more difficulty.  The idea is to cut teeth on easier targets, with an occasional difficult target thrown in for the experience.  
---
Just thinking about how to get more experience while mitigating the risk factor.  Sometimes when I've gone days without catching anything I want to go all-in on whatever comes along.  I need more patience and target discipline.
---
The battlecruiser is just a worse iki.
---
I dont have issues with an alternate option , just that dont trust on the timelines that they eve ppl will give them. If u ask today u will get it like 5 years later
---
Bingo
---
No it was stress tested.
---
Who's this lady?  I only do that mission to get my sofa back.
---
Looks... Breakfasty.
---
Simple the skill loss is to make the losing and buying that ship more of a hit . Its a t3 cruiser for fk sake and kill anything from frig to battlecruiser without issue . There need to be some sacrifice to using it.
---
They had a lot of people moving around with fairly responsive behaviors.
---
The problem is that there was so little game there that it's hard to tell what stuff is lag induced and what stuff is just because we don't have enough info about the world around us to tell what is going on.
---
Climbing in the ship gives a warning. But if you eject before it dies, you won't lose the SP. Of course, they could also scoop your now empty ship or something too.
---
I have done about 8 hours of carrier ratting since blackout, in periods of 40-80 minutes, and have never seen a neut let alone been tackled by one.
---
If investors all gave up after 2 failed tests (each better than the last) then nothing would ever have been made.
---
Look at how many failures SpaceX has had, how many failures the wright brothers had.
---
Each success is built on a mountain of failures.
---
Then what companies do you invest in? Because all of them have failed more than twice.
---
I thought static WHs were defined by the fact that they always go to the same region of space?
---
but you can't do that unless you are willing to throw away recons after the change. And if you are the fleet getting dropped on just keep killing recons as your fleet goes down to make them pay for dropping.
---
Yes, because when we fight in a shared static we totally want the cap numbers to be decided by RNG...
---
And yet with tether you can easily get your shit out with DST's or jump freighters. or just jumping your caps.  
---
also the idea of 2 big blocks dividing up the map and steamrolling.... sounds very damn familiar, like right now familiar... They'll just wipe the floor with regions worth of citadels cause they are bored TODAY \*cough tribute\*  
---
Atleast it'll reward the guy willing to DO something about the citadels near him, he MIGHT get some loot, and wont spend a week to do it. whether that guy is in one of the cancerlitions.. or in a hungry small group looking for a likely citadel to burn.  
---
Forgotten POS's could be some of the best and most rewarding loot drops of all time, and the same with attacking and taking important stations, firesales OMNOMNOM
---
If caps printing isk is the problem don’t allow caps to enter the anomaly.  Problem solved!
---
Don’t just nerf caps! 
---
They are CAPs. Very expensive and skill intensive.  Let them worth something in PvP.
---
The rattles are remote cap local rep. The nestors are remote rep local cap. The repping power scales up with the more Nestors you have. With two, it might not be possible to have enough reps to tank the nastiest sites. Make a pyfa fit and see how much you're tanking, then compared that to rykki's guide.
---
The problem is that the behavior that would be discouraged here would be "logging in."  Which is not a behavior they want to discourage.
---
The higher you go the better amount of loot you get and the higher chance of good loot, but sometimes even in 4 loot caches are empty. 5 I have done some but I don't recall if I found empty caches or not. The nodes are sometimes empty too. High levels and for faster clears that's why it's a good idea to have a fast ship and or a tractor beam + weapons that can open them to see if they have loot or not.
---
Fuck why is this upside down, Im in Australia shouldn't this be right way up
---
Oh boi, have I got one for this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/78056515/
---
Fucked up fuel calcs, had to run 2nd Cyno, frat hunted me down just as I jumped into the WH and caught the Carrier, 3 minutes later there's a 50+ man Muninn fleet there to give my 23B carrier a belting.
---
Probably the next thing you'd complain about if not for blackout and other changes.
---
Thank you for the advice. That really clears it up!
---
a limited engagement timer can not be inherited that way. so no, its always just you and the "thrasher".
---
That would be really fun. My FC friend would certainly love more wormholes to hostile space...
---
any PvP is real PvP.
---
It is code for bringing the game back to a point where pvp is meaningful and rewarding, and not just a sideshow to rorqs and supers.
---
Out of curiosity, why aren't you considering dual RR Leshaks?
---
Probably true, and then I saw it with my own 2 eyes! wtf!
---
You'd think he would've put some of those dedspace modules onto his shit-fit titan.
---
Don't have them trained on two characters yet, and its gonna be a while for one of them. :(
---
Thats what ive been trying to tell people.
---
LMAO giving up after two tests.
---
If humanity gave everything up after two attempts we'd still be painting cave walls for entertainment.
---
Considering the absolute buttload of work that it must have been for the guys scouting the wormhole highways it was reasonable i think. Because if it hadn't required such effort, then everyone would have been doing it.  
---
 And i'll agree, the null-nulls were a bit too good at force projection. But instead of almost removing roaming null connections they could have slightly lowered the spawn rate, and voila. Problem solved without completely removing a playstyle.  
---
Speaking of force projection, 2 years later they added the ansiblex bullshit. If the roaming null connections can only exist in limited fashion then ansiblexs should have greater restrictions aswell.
---
Fair enough, that's understandable.
---
LANGUAGE NEPHEW
---
I also did not know they were suitable for this sorta thing. How do they compare to Nestors/Rattles?
---
&gt; Your logic applied anywhere else would mean that freighters carrying ships should have those ships go into asset safety. Blow up the house and the shit inside isnt safe. 
---
THis isnt the same logic as with a freighter you are out in space and logged on, versus not while docked.
---
The why is pretty simple I dont want to lose shit or alot of shit due to IRL Afking.  And any amount of loot percentage will just force people to use the npc stations anyway so its mute.  It was definitely Right to have it put in.
---
&gt;THis isnt the same logic
---
How? 
---
Your ship blows up containing another ship. Your ship can drop.
---
Your structure blows up containing ships. Your ship can't drop.
---
????
---
It requires 4 accounts at the same time in low class, while putting 4 battleships on the field. Or one account and then it takes you a minimum of 20 up to 35 minutes to roll. How is any of that too easy?
---
Lol, you'll find a lot of posts on this subreddit that are nostalgic for the early 2010s late 2000s that you were gone.  I guess opinions differ
---
Player stations? Citadels? 
---
J space doesn't have asset protection so all of our shit drops when it pops.
---
Wish granted. Now only C1 have K-space connections. To get to C6 you now have to go K-space - C1 - C2 - C3 - C4 - C5 - C6.
---
Not necessarily. 
---
A nullified T3 can get anywhere in space pretty freely with a covert cyno, and a force recon can be bridged through. Then, their regular cyno can wander around your space unknown. Or more likely they'll just covert bridge the force recon whenever it's needed.
---
You’re all beautiful!!
---
POSes should be banned from lowsec
---
I create content every day, except I flush it down rather than uploading it to the Internet for everyone to see
---
that s weak man. How about all the whs become warpable anomalies  instead of sigs and the exit opens instantly - much simpler change hehehe
---
Because it exclusively nerfed roaming connections it forced high class groups to move to low class space. So wh groups got less fights with eachother (also minus capitals) but had to swallow the pill because having a NS connection is almost mandatory to have a consistent content stream for your members.
---
Wormholers taking one for the team again...
---
Allow me. The receiving end of the lingering shards (facing the explosive shockwaves) is inherently resistant to the impetus because it and the other remaining ship bits alone survived the even worse initial detonation. They might crack or corrode, but inevitably they will spiral down to a local gravity source (if ratting then the rock sites or the ones with acceleration gates and /or complexes) otherwise a multi-millenia drift to the outbound stargate(s) that through energy mass (relativity) are heavier than the parent system stars they watch over.
---
Trigger happy vs Blue donut.
---
Goons became the pile of caps to combat the super/cap heavy meta that existed, prior to that they were the pile of subcaps. It wasn't our trap, we simply adopted the play style when it became overbearingly dominant. People seem to have forgotten the goons won their early wars with overwhelming subcap numbers.
---
The amount of people in this thread that have absolutely no clue about wormhole mechanics/ the stupid amount of effort that goes into scanning is staggering. 
---
Instead of being butthurt about nullsec changes you should be grateful you get any at all #wormholerbtw
---
Two leshaks are not enough to tank c5 in rr
---
And if you bling them to have enough tank i'd guess the price will be way too unreasonable
---
Not to mention leshak risks running dry on cap on drifter if you don't have cap transfer or something like 130 cap regen
---
Pretending that Olmeca is a monkey is just dumb lul
---
It's also hilarious that people seem to think you burned 4 regions to save our shitty Asbel when, you know, Anveri/.
---
You won't be able to compete on the market then. 99% of the industrialist use fully researched Blueprints.
---
That is problem 1
---
Problem 2 is probably the location where you manufacture. Low, null and wh provide additional bonuses in terms of material efficiency. Furthermore, the system cost index influences the job cost. If you produce in high sec at least try to choose a system with a low industry index - avoid perimeter and other systems close to trade hubs and accept a few jumps to your market.
---
Keep in mind though that you should not carry 1b in a Tayra.
---
Problem 3 is probably sourcing. Check if you can acquire raw materials cheaper with buy orders. Do your math carefully. Nothing is more displeasing than losing money at the beginning of your industrial career.
---
Not that i want to advocate for vote brigading, but usually reddit apps should let you store login tokens so that switching accounts is 1-2 button presses max. Reddit is fun has that feature and it is really comfy when you  want to switch from your hentai throwaway to your accounts with a... cleaner posting history.
---
You can do standard C5 sites with dual RR Shaks. They're about 1.6Bn each, give or take, which isn't unreasonable. You can run data and relic sites with 3-4 of them, and tank the Drifter no problem.
---
You can't scan the fleet behind the covert cyno from a cloaked ship.. imagine there where a instant wormhole generator in wormhole space you could use to summon a fleet directly to the cloaky t3c who is sitting near you. You won't see it on dscan, you won't see it in local ( because blackout ) you will see it the moment the hunter decloaks and his countless friends from over 200 possible systems will join the grid. That moment you realyze you lost your ship and you can't do something about it.
---
Just the same class of wormhole/kspace, not the same region
---
Cough cough Pirate faction marauders cough cough.
---
I know I know that would be op af.
---
Still one can dream.
---
&gt;You can't scan the fleet behind the covert cyno from a cloaked ship
---
Oh so you didn't pay attention to dscan to see the ship jump the gate?
---
Nice
---
Dual Nags.
---
I was more so looking towards the picture.. you can see fragments of whatever blew up further out from the initial source than the shockwave pictured above. Given that the ejected material has more mass than the plasma we see as the shockwave here, wouldn’t they move at a slower rate? Thus, should not be out twice as far?
---
Or are those tiny spod rocks?
---
You won't see it jump the gate because its already logged in the system..
---
Those are not the surviving hull fragments, they are pulverized shrapnel.
---
But still more mass than plasmids no?
---
Ahh, the best kind of shrapnel.
---
TBH, I'm not entirely sure since I don't have that much experience with Nestors/Rattles, but I'm pretty certain dual RR Shaks are better for clearing C5 sites. With the spool-up on the gun bringing you to the lower end of dread DPS at their peak (IIRC) you can get a lot done in a little time.
---
I'd upgrade to four Shaks to run data/relic sites, three if you really know what you're doing (though you might have to bring out armour bots on occasion).
---
Two leshaks have plenty of cap, if you pay attention to the sig window and roll accordingly they’re very safe as you can Micro Jump out if something pops up. As far as the drifter goes they are RR so if you can tackle it you can tank it as the ship getting neuted is the same one that will need reps. But I have yet to be neuted out by the drifter in my fit, the capacitor is a beast. Costs about 1.6 bill but its fast and safe once you have the multiboxing skills.
---
That's not how r&amp;d works.
---
No. Any PvP is any PvP. Real PvP is real PvP. Just like any athlete is not always a real athlete. Just like you have people who play football and football players. 
---
There's a difference, but if you want to justify shitty PvP as real PvP then that's your choice to be stupid.
---
Move the skill point loss to certain caps and wait.
---
This took me a while, but was an awesome read!
---
You arrr on to something...
---
Wasn't it Shart Dragon's whining to CCP that got the change to happen?
---
In most cases, you die too fast to eject.
---
Being locked doesn’t prevent tether.
---
This pretty much, it's the booshers that are the problem.
---
not to mention that decreasing rates of piracy are linked to global warming
---
I've been mocking null salt all month... but this, this would make me salty, at least for a while. 
---
I wouldn't lie about unsubbing, tho'.
---
So... rolling praxis for everyone? doesn't sound too different from what we do anyway.
---
Can you share the fit, please?
---
I tested 4 cheap leshaks yesterday on sisi, about 650-700m each, no battleship V tho, took about 20min/site with drifter
---
This I like.
---
Upvote.
---
That would be a QoL improvement. No more scanning your chain, no more bookmarks... 
---
Please, do this CCP.
---
Bots and krabs would disagree given safety nets a d Intel channels.
---
That's all out the window now.
---
I love how most of the comments in this thread are from people trying to make wormhole life harder, but all they come up with is shit that would make our lives easier.
---
Then you're fucked. But there's no point complaining about the 30 cloaked proteuses that may or may not be camping in your system for the past 2 hours. That's a common worry in J space, but 99.9% of the time it doesn't happen.
---
cheap rum also decreases logical abilities
---
Removing the need to do quick 5-figure arithmetic after all these years? 
---
Quality of life improvement = 0.00023%, measurable and therefore brilliant.
---
The thing is, that would be annoying as fuck, but if you are not used to getting rolled out, you are not living in a wormhole.
---
Had my first run with them today, but they weren't showing up in my overview. Can someone confirm they fall under "invading precursor entities" in the filter list?
---
Wormholes having no mass limit?
---
correct me if I'm wrong but I smell cap blob
---
I was able to get in, technically speaking.  It looked pretty good, but it was basically a 1 FPS slideshow on my computer.  Any touch of the controls sent my ship into convulsions.  *Obviously* it was because I didn't have a snazzy Corsair gaming rig...
---
Out of curiosity, anyone get their SKINs yet?
---
I'm all for this change. Cheaper rum is always good.
---
Did nothing for or against stagnation. Contrary to what wormhole BTW folks would have you believe, hunters don't really contribute much towards null destruction. Wars are king. Ever since moon mining changed, we no longer have a reason to go to war. Especially with sov and structure grind.
---
Fair warning. i tend to rant.  
---
I'd be all for an anti cap subcap (tho i'd FAR prefer it being t1 and cheap as fucking chips so everyone can use it, cause fuck this capital BULLSHIT)  
---
But triggy ships can do FAR more than that.  
---
They have Really damn good tracking, and can shoot at a better range of distances than quite possibly any of their opposition (missiles a possibly exception to this, but then we've all bitched about how RLML was OP). for outright range they are not the best. but they have the best versatility of range of any subcaps.  
---
They do as much as twice \*or more\* the dps of nearly all other ships of their class, While also being perfectly combat fit, rather than being total blap fit (coercer fit for instance)  
---
Add to that the utility highs and bonus's to neuts, that is the wet dream of any solo/small gang pilot (with the drek being a great example of this. Two command bursts and STILL a room for a neut!)  
---
While a few seem to underperform \*damavik is still a bit shit, and vedmak has been totally eclipsed in ALL directions, smaller, bigger AND t2\* They are undoubtedly glorious OP wagons. and as much as i love flying with them. they need a nerf. not a total bat to the fucking face. but enough so to stop the kiki replacing pretty much all kiting frigs and dessies, And the drek replacing any battlecruiser comfortably.  
---
I'd complain about the ikit and nergal, but tbh i actually havent seen them enough to know just how good or bad they are.  
---
For fleet work, they are almost never worth the price of admission, and i do love this.  
---
But as a solo, vsing other people in solo/small gang. if you see one. 90% of the time you just leave. There is near no chance unless the guy is a total idiot (warps kiteyboi kiki at 0) or you've got the right friends.  
---
And while you may consider that "bitching about a ship being good at what its designed to be for" theres a difference between being good at the small scale. and being quite possibly some of the single best options possible, with the only downside being a reasonable increase in cost.  
---
TL:DR  
---
Triggys do a fuckton more than just "kill caps" and are ALOT better at killing subs than you give them credit for.  
---
also i am a longwinded cunt who cant stop ranting.
---
I think the more important property is that they will respawn in the same system almost instantly after collapse.
---
So you can roll them (collapse purposefully) until you get  connection to area you want.
---
Sorry that's what I meant. Forgot region can mean the pre-defined areas.
---
Fleets are just for organizing players.
---
They do absolutely nothing for crimewatch. Nothing.
---
Were you on the CSM do you have the chatlogs? No stfu idiot.
---
Yeah. What will the OPs idea do/change that the current statics dont?
---
Someone complained and everything that person was saying was true. I was faced with lie to or tell the truth.
---
SP wise, rattle &gt;&gt; nestors &gt;&gt; leshaks. That is it doesn't take much to have rattles that can tank and deal good dps.
---
Yeah if you think you could take em. just remember that he can attack you back after you shoot him. You will get a limited engagement timer for 5 or 15 minutes i don't remember but he can extend that by refreshing it shooting your wrecks so he can go out reship and come back and wait for you long after his suspect timer is gone.
---
What are you complaining about then?
---
How many dps on one leshaks?
---
Drifters are sleepers, and sleepers originated in... exactly... highsec!  
---
News alert drifters have existed for a couple of years now in wh space.
---
It miraculously manages to save up to 2 minutes of your time.
---
So, if I strawman this appropriately, a 1% QOL Improvement yields 869,565.217 minutes saved.
---
I have no idea for what it will save 10 days for but you have the numbers!!1!
---
Thanks for the advice. I'd like to start with 2 ships for now, so ill probably stick with rattles, and I'll go up as I get the ISK and the characters.
---
Coming from 2008, I’m glad that’s gone.
---
Thank you for the advice! Looking at my skills, I'm a couple weeks away from having them at high levels while my rattle/nestors are practically maxed, so I will upgrade as I can!
---
I can't decide if you are a) mad about blackout b) off-topic c) concern-trolling. So i'll go with a mix of all three options.
---
**C4 SPACE WAS A MISTAKE**
---
Get tank, align out while mining, dont be afk, maybe that helps.
---
I read here that they have not much dps and no points, they just make people not afk. Maybe.
---
Or just triple box hookbills for T3 or Hawks for T4-5.  A lot more money and a lot less risk
---
literally the most common phrase relating to eve there is. Man all these noobs that join that can't live without skill injectors and rorq mining, no wonder games dying
---
As much as I know this will be seen as a bad idea. I agree that supercapitals shouldn't  be in low, not really because of current issues, but purely for the fact that it will open up a section of space in which dread + Carrier + Fax + Battle Rorq battles happen more often without the fear of random dd's or super gangs dropping. I think it'd make things more interesting in that regard, but I wouldn't take normal capital usage out of Lowsec, it's low security, would mess with getting a lot of ships around, punishes low security rorq users (Who believe it or not, do exist in small numbers) and eliminates capital warfare from lowsec corps which is un-necassary.
---
They're trivially easy to run away from, keep an eye on D-scan, they roam. They don't just spawn.
---
If you got your shit together, you can also have an Orca on standby with combat ships docked. Properly tanked Orca can stand up to the recon groups no problem.
---
Let it tank, get in your cruisers or whatever, kill the bastards.
---
I love the recon trigs. Sure as hell make mining less mindless.
---
How about no D-Scan in WH's. That would definitly be worth a meme.
---
Also, legalize space weed.

You don't think Battleship DPS and Tank mixed with the ability to jump, Jump entire covert gangs, ability to have heavy neuts, smartbombs, speed increase when cloaked and 5 second relock timer with a cyno that's covert isn't strong enough?

---
Marauders were created as PvE space vessels, winkwink!
---
What, did you seriously think that these guys were going to crack the holy grail of online PVP on the first two tries?
---
Don't you think that if it was easy to build the infrastructure for 10,000 player battles EA or somebody with massive resources would already have done it? When it gets cracked -- and it will be -- it'll most likely come from smaller companies who are willing to gamble and beat their heads against the wall repeatedly until they get it to work. Which is exactly what's happening here.
---
Mind uhhh enlightening a young soul on what tank and dscan means.
---
What
---
When have I complained about blackout.
---
  What has that got to do with F1?
---
I think they should keep stealth bombers the way they are and make T2 heavy bombers battlecruisers with capital guns but the same paper tank and slow speed, and awful sensors to boot so that you need to have ewar support to use them effectively.
---
Dscan - directional scan. Learn to use it and love it, you might as well learn sooner than later since it's an essential tool for survival in low-sec or 0.0.
---
Tank - Means the same thing as in any other MMO. Your ability to suck up damage, either by boosting resistances or raw HP.
---
All high horses on that podcast about Tribute. Proceeds to blue up immediately with FE and the TRIGG/TOXIC blob. 
---
Cute. Tribute was too good to be true.
---
Thats what you usually do when camping
---
Just ignore everything said why don't you.
---
Tank is defensive modules.
---
Your ability to take damage. So this would be, for most mining ships, shield modules. Shield extenders, Shield hardeners, etc. Damage Control as well.
---
D-scan is Directional Scan. It's an on board ship scanner that lets you know what is in space out around you, but not how far or what direction (except when you use its range and cone size to figure it out yourself). Be default, 'V' opens the dscan, and you can unsnap the dscan window from the full system map. Then you can set it to whatever range you think is good, and 360degrees and press v every once in a while. If the recon ships appears on it, then you can prepare to leave before they even show up on grid.
---
No. Goons will keep winning and you'll keep complaining.
---
Thank you very much, I’ll get the C type and keep pills. However, Is there any way to bling it more to tank the last wave?
---
I was totally not interested in trig invasion, until i moved thru one yesterday.         
---
Rattles on gates, and nestor supported ships on citadels /u/ccp_falcon is this really what CCP wanted from trig invasion?
---
Oh will you fuck off already
---
I signed up and got no email. I'd set aside some time on my birthday for this shit.
---
You know, I’d believe you but why did you Sabre land with Tri‘s and bubbled the Nightmares BUT you never undocked? Kind of weird don’t you think? Or did you just want to yolo a Sabre into us? According to some Tri guys, you only undocked after they asked you to (???) but yeah, you just like to yolo Sabres (???)...
---
It'll tank the last stronghold wave if you upgrade both invulns to C-type.
---
Adapt or die.
---
Currently i am in process of inventing 50 falcon BPC ^(can get shield reps) , 50 pilgrims BPC ^(can get armor reps) , Undecided number of amarr T2 frigates for jf movement.           
---
I hope you are doing the same as prices for all those things will get expensive quite soon.
---
And I feel like people who are criticising the people who are upset over this are missing the point as well. Nobody's upset over the state of the gameplay, or the lag. People are upset because they were unable to even get into the testing environment, either because the launcher didn't work for them or because they did not get the login code until up to an hour after the test concluded.
---
Those issues are inexcusable.
---
Because you’re fucking annoying, but yeah, according to you were all Goon Pets so what do I have to say anyways?
---
&gt; Straight up, I would be pulling out of Hadean if I had money invested. 
---
That's because you're a pussy. Seriously, you roll over faster than a dog looking to get it's belly rubbed. 
---
&gt; So kindly go sit in a corner until you know what you are talking about. 
---
You know, I was going to treat this like a discussion, but now I realize you're just being a dick to feel powerful. Stop acting like you're some hot shit, you don't have the stones for it.
---
Apparently the SKINs aren't even on TQ. So I'd say CCP is going to hand out the SKINs a few weeks after everybody forgets they were owed them.
---
&gt; T2 modules and ships will spike due to this. 
---
And how is that a problem?
---
CCP: Ok
---
CCP: *makes half the WH's one way and exit WH never appears on probe scan.
---
The frustration part is what puts my brain into reset-mode every morning, to forget how it was the day before. Otherwise i could not get into another one to try another fight.
---
I would like to see how community react when a new wormhole spawned, it immediately open K162 instead someone walk through it
---
i know, ive just been bamboozled a few times and am slightly annoyed.
---
"ohh great fight vs this cynabal.....oh hi rapier and ur 3 loki buds, cya in jita"
---
Or the wormhole immediately open K162, so roll wh does not work anymore
---
So people who use jump freighters and capitals will become bankrupt. You make it sound like these are rookie ships.
---
Mining in a properly fitted Procurer or Skiff, will give you plenty of tank and dps (drone damage bonus) to kill them and continue mining. Worst case, you will enough time to warp out.
---
This isnt a CCP project. The licensed the skins from CCP and Hilmar is personally backing them. 
---
The skins and stuff are purely a way to get bodies for the test. They got them that.
---
My list of reasons not to just use a tengu :
---
Considering they thought about  removing carriers from warping to sites I think this is a much better alternative
---
Cool, thank you very much.
---
Ratting in a Myr and be killed by the Astero for overestimate EC-300
---
660mil for for people above 50mil SP and under 80mil SP and 1.3bil for people over 80mil SP.
---
That's A LOT of added cost. Based on cost balancing they should therefore be able to kill carriers solo when you have more than 80mil sp.
---
Get a spreadsheet off of arko flloyd. He has a thread somewhere
---
If you are that poor you cant afford a to buy a t2 cruiser then you probably cant afford a cap in the first place, and if you do have one... Dont fly what you cant afford to lose
---
If they notice in time when i eject at half hull they can have it. SP loss already doubles the price of my Legion.
---
I'm inclined to agree but null on null action is uncommon with or without the wormholes. Trying to get a decent subcap fight is a roll of the dice as to whether they will or will not drop supers on you. I'd rather capitals were fixed first and I'm not convinced CCP is actually going to succeed in doing that.
---
Nobody's salty lad, people are just downvoting you because they want you to know that you're a fucking retard that doesn't know anything about what he's talking about.
---
You don't need to be salty to do that amigo.
---
By the way, Horde guys like running with shield tanked stuff, often times they dont really tank for the NPCs but rather players. So always turn on effects and check if the guy is armor or shield tanked. If hes shield tanked you are often best off using EM damage, they expect everyone to come at them with explosive.
---
You act like only Goons do this. When was the last time NC and PL were at each others throats? Not being on one or the other side of the fence is more uncommon than not.
---
Allow covert cynos in wormhole space to be used from the same wormhole group ( c1 to c1 , c2 to c2 and so on )...
---
while scrammed "scrambled cyno unable to jump."
---
Cycle goes on as normal on cyno ship
---
What is the most isk/hr activity as alpha clone? I don't care if it's boring etc. Don't include trading please.
---
One thing comes to my mind is exploration in sansha?
---
Nope just pointing it out you scan down and crit your holes and nothing big enough to hurt you can get though that and no dread bombs in wh space
---
lol
---
I'm chilling at my desk with two girls and one pimp cup.
---
Is that even the same font?
---
I’m not embarrassed by any of my kill mails. In fact, if there is one feature I have never cared about, even though I’ve been in corps where they jizzed over them, it’s kill mails.
---
I don’t give a flying fuck about them and I never will.
---
&gt;sequestered to another part of the system.
---
So, back when you used to be able to assist fighters? K so now you have VNIs/subcap ratters with assisted fighters again. 
---
Also what's stopping one side of a fleet just combat probing the enemy carriers?
---
And inb4 carrier alts so you can get Max fighters on grid.
---
Play it smarter then, we’ve had plenty of losses against good pilots
---
its okay [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmcasnlOM1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmcasnlOM1M)
---
That's a tech demo for you. 
---
It's less about being something people want or enjoy doing and more about raw concurrent users connected.
---
Nope, me and my corps love in null - we love it. But then we aren't in a bloc. 
---
See you around ;)
---
So that's where the button was hiding. I knew it existed but hadn't found it since I started doing industry again. Manually filling market folders was a bit of a pain.
---
yep, would also make wh safety go away - which is in line with what op wanted :))
---
its usually a hit or miss. sometimes I frag some fast tackle and get out, sometimes im the one who gets fragged :P
---
Im just bitching to bitch
---
Exploration in NS, salvaging after ratters in NS
---
How do you adapt to no people around in a mmorpg game? Nullsec is deserted atm. Only the dumbest people around continue to rat in anything smaller than super under one of the few umbrellas.
---
Yup.
---
My point was just that the lack of "game" also makes it hard to tell, from that play perspective, how well it was even doing.
---
Like I was seeing rockets tracking stuff, and blowing up and hurting things.
---
But also there were times I seemed to take damage from nothing or miss was seemed like clear hits.
---
Those are things where the lack of feedback about things happening can make intended behavior look broken.
---
𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎𝚝𝚎𝚕𝚢 𝚕𝚎𝚐𝚒𝚝 𝚕𝚖𝚊𝚘 👌

show is on the doll where the mean bottom feeder touched your mtu :)))

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Not entirely on board with cynos being limited to recons honestly. It does make it harder for the defender to escalate to capitals. Lighting a recon on grid would get it killed very easily. Supers aren't going to jump to that. Which is fine if it also made it more difficult for the attacker to escalate but it doesn't. Under Blackout they just uncloak, drop the cyno and in they go. Capital escalation needs to be equally difficult on both sides. I'm all for jump spooling maybe. Or cyno spooling. Takes five minutes or something for a capital to lock to a beacon and jump. Bridging could still be instant. Give the attacker an opportunity to combat the escalation and vise versa. Maybe cyno structures can still be instantly jumped to so logistics won't be too big a pain in the arse but there is risk jumping to a static structure off a citadel. JFs are already getting the ability to jump to covert cynos. I don't think CCP has thought this one through at all.
---
No, you've got it all mixed up,
---
it's cap proliferation
---
And yes there are a couple of other good app alternatives out there, will probably start using that, but I was just wondering.
---
You are a bit slow, aren't you?
---
You mean explo as in data and relic or pve sites as well?
---
horde
---
&gt;Goodbye baiting the risk averse hunters that only want easy kills. Goodbye hunting the hunters.
---
With the Blackout active you can still bait the Hunters, Just sit at a deepsave or docked at an NPC station and wait for them. 
---
The issue is that in the hours you sit in anticipation for any hunters, you could have mined the worth of any T1 Barge and made extra in case you lose it to said hunters. So it's basically never worth to setup a standing fleet unless you want to mine with heavy equipment like Rorqs and Hulks (and Hulks are going to die before your trap springs anyway, making it neccesary to intercept hunters at the Gates before they get to your Hulks).
---
IDK what your WH lyfe is but if you do any type of PvP what so ever out of a WH youd know how much of a buff these changes have been. Like holy shit blackout was massive. Now these cyno changes? WH pvp just got massively buffed.
---
Horde
---
I had absolutely no problem logging my dedicated supercapital and titan alts off in a POS.  It was known when I bought them.
---
youve layed eve then? no, im sure not, so you have no concept of the comparison im making, eve make fortnite look like farming simulator in 'harsh-ness'
---
Rapid here, yes the MTO keepstar was quite an excellent fight. Of 110 Dreads only 3 Lived; I had honestly lost hope for eve as far as imagination and killboard queens go. That fight gave me hope that maybe eve wasn't in such a bad state after all. I held on for quite a while, shame things had to happen the way they did
---
As for everyone else you can see part of the battle here: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U65gIziADT0)
---
P.S  Hi Manny
---
That sounds like a fantastic idea, a good way to catch out idiots :)
---
so you cannot man up and just admit, there is a chance you have it all wrong, there is a chance they did what they needed to to keep eve alive, which im sure they've run into plenty of times with such an old game.
---
answer the fucking question, your fooling no one with your bullshit. its a very possible, and likely situation. not some impossible fantasy im stating.
---
Looks like DED plexes
---
all i did was type into google 'mission running gila eve online' 
---
eve online has just as much info about things outside eve as it does inside. everything outside is pretty much all player made or explained.
---
But what about the friendly fire? Is that normal in the corp ?
---
&gt;Nobody's upset over the state of the gameplay, or the lag 
---
this is straight up not true, there were a lot of people like that at the first test, and at this one.
---
though, you're 100% right about the inexcusable issues
---
If the person can afford a super or a titan they can afford the paltry couple of billion to asset safety it.  If they are in a Keepstar they are also likely in a group organised enough to help them get the ship to actual tethered safety anyway.  The problem there though is the need to keep continuously subbed, which would seem like the point for CCP.
---
that 5 is completely out of alignment
---
oh, ive burnt plenty of pings to edge of grids since the changes, im very aware of grid sizes. however still today fights go a few 100km from a gate or structure, and you find the edge of the grid. 
---
me and my alliance burnt over a grid WHILE fighting only a few days ago in HACs. hence why i asked what happens if you booshed a cyno ship over the edge of one.
---
i think sir, you have no idea what a grid truly is for you to say this lol. maybe you have some basicly knowledge, i endured pre expanded grid sizes and now. im sure i know.
---
Only DED sites and rally point anomalies. I have to carry everything with me like a mobile depot, backup drones, travel fit and still enough space to stuff in a cloaking device when I switch to combat fit sometimes even loots. So really no for relic and data scraps. And majority of the escalation sites end up in nullspace which I did not feel safe to fly into with my stratios.
---
Bad meme please ignore
---
They have the same kind of hold as a Bowhead, right? It can't be that bad of an idea to allow players to ride in it, right?..
---
Mind sharing your fit? I’m starting to get tired of just doing relic and data sites. Looking to move on from the heron to some low sec combat or Black Hole Combat sites
---
Where do I find them in the overview settings, couldnt find roaming trigs when casually looking for them in the settings
---
Improvement ideas are welcome!
---
I wouldnt wonder if they are not shown on dscan for newbros. Standard overview settings are bull.
---
changes in null have been making everything harder,
---
how about they half the amount of wormholes. and if one is rolled prematurely it increases the chances of drifter battleship spawns in your system
---
you all seem to think this era in nullsec is good things, and WH space needs some good.
---
how about they triple drifter battleships, make wormholes 2x more difficult to scan down? thats a comparable change to make sure WH space isnt left out xD
---
now this would finally give Wormholers the attention they cry for lol
---
they seem to think all this shit is helping nullseccers.lol
---
just make cynos consume like, 20 medium salvage tackle rigs as fuel, problem solved :D
---
you can make 3x as much isk/H, you can choose to remove of keep all entrances into your system, you can build more shit inside to defend it than anyone could bring in to take it, im pretty sure wormhole space is nice to its resident. if i could stand solitary confinement i would move into one xD
---
Capital ships are too cheap and overpowered. Everything is still unbalanced in favor of the residents over the roamers. Jump gates with no fatigue is overpowered. Capitals are still overpowered for their cheap cost. This cyno change will make it more likely to get fights without it being ruined by supers.
---
Not interested in this tbh.
---
Standard dscan I believe is set to "all" though by default. You have to set it to "current overview".
---
And I think all the default overviews include diamond rats
---
You can easly tank the stronghold in dual rattle with mod grade crystal set (without the omega, it doesn't cost that muchvand the boost is decent)
---
No session changing, no Smartbomb damage calculation, no module use, no fleet commands being send to 200PC's to make thier ship warp together. no cynos active having shit jump in (more session changing i guess).
---
what does this achieve? oh look we can have 3000 humans connect to our server, nothing more. just connect, the ship fired itself. there was still lag with 3000 people. and still ships jumping around. the server stopped letting people in, and you want 10k real people? make it not a waste of time and test the things we know cause lag first xD
---
If you're not in one of the blue donuts you still have to have your super be a space coffin. We still manage.
---
Making supers and Titans just another ship was a terrible idea, they're so powerful that plenty of people still own one without a keepstar to store it!
---
No Gopnik, without buterbrod and kvas, can lose at such glorious game as EVE.
---
By the stripes on my Adidas track suit, I will will.
---
I missed the mail with the key and download because it got in my spam mailbox. 
---
But the Thank you mail got in my normal inbox...
---
Like a hat?
---
Keepstars were not a qol change for me. I don't have access to one. I still have to sit in it like a space coffin.
---
Must check them out later
---
Industrialist and miners unfortunately.
---
Can't generate content without ships
---
ashimu BPC's doing explo? lol
---
Invanding Precursor Entities I believe, same as the invasion npc’s
---
B types on a titan, you did more than justice for yourselves.
---
awesome to hear you achieved what i too may one day :D
---
There has always been FOTM-ships and fits. The high-SP ships were not quite as common as they are now, probably partly because of the injectors. You see, when there were no injectors FC's and alliances had to take into account the fact that it would take time for their line members to get into a doctrine if they weren't already in it, so it was necessary to give them time or have overlapping "high-SP" and "low-SP" doctrines that could be flown in the same fleet. One example would be command ships and battlecruisers in the same fleet. Now with the injectors available they can count on at least some of the line members who cannot fly a given doctrine to just inject to it instantly so there are expectations to do so as well. Also peer pressure counts, and if you complain about quickly changing doctrines and training times you might be told to just inject and be done with it. So simply having injectors available makes their use more expected of you.
---
 Try RVB we fight in lowsec and are in Faction warfare. in all nullsec blocks you're only a number under 1000.
---
And they dont care at all. Unless they need newbros in meta fits for meatshield.
---
Lol, if someone \*asks\* about that kind of access it will def not be given and the person would be put under very close observation, potentially even restricting roles.
---
&gt; ONLY engage someone if they are 90% certain they can win without losing a single ship.
---
A lot of the time there aren't "fair fights" to be had anyway.
---
It's either you dunk or get dunked.
---
I know, as a hunter, I dropped on fights with real risk. I've made risky dumb moves, and risky moves that worked really well.
---
But I'm not going to drop into something where we are going to lose hard.
---
And with the advantage defenders inherently have, this generally means only dropping on easy targets, because anything that gets close to "fair" starts to extend the standard deviation well towards "we lose our entire fleet".
---
I can only know what my fleet has, I can't know for sure what the enemy has available.
---
They show up on my interface and I haven't done a lot of custom filtering, they should just show up like normal hostile NPCs.
---
I gave FW a try, thank you for the advice it's just like you said. I hadn't considered it. People in-game have been very helpful as I look for a group that does this
---
&gt; you could have mined the worth of any T1 Barge and made extra in case you lose it to said hunters.
---
This is mostly the case.
---
I know just doing FW missions, even in blingy tengus, being very cavalier with my security, I would still make multiple times the cost of the tengu for each one lost (not accounting for SP loss). That's even including my REALLY stupid behavior like running my mission even if a neutral was in the mission with me.
---
Just doing the basic safety of running away with reds in system or someone showing up on my gate, the risk gets cut way way way down.
---
You don't need perfect protection or to bait hunters, because there just aren't enough of them anyway.
---
did you actually read the entire thing?
---
Well everyone seems to be lying  thought I’d get in on the lies too
---
Nice loot.I would like to see your fit too,if you don t mind.  
---
Also how high can u go with that stratios? Can u do 5/10?
---
No more rolling holes.. might have as well said delete WH space in its entirety. Nobody is going to sit there all day with a shit chain.
---
Good job :=)
---
Oh fuck, it's Nepsy! Hi! I sometimes talk shit with you in Local, it's me, Rigknot!
---
Also fuck you for stealing someone's stuff with that one courier contract with a low collateral, you're still my enemy &gt;:c
---
Mines doing the same thing. I just assumed the app had some issues due to its low rating in the store.
---
Do you make your ISK in null?
---
Stroke or Scottish I’m saying
---
Eve University lets you learn at your own pace. It isn’t like college, it’s more like a Montessori school. Karma Fleet is also always recruiting, if you have thick skin and are capable of reading basic instructions.
---
Blood Raider sites drop blood raider BPCs.
---
Just like Drone Sites drop items to trade for SOE bpcs.
---
- Capital ships are too cheap and overpowered. 
---
I really don’t see capitals as too cheap and overpowered. Before the fighter nerf maybe. But now a single carrier can be held in place and defanged very easily by any small gang with at least 1 logi.
---
And they are being compared  to hunters  running around in fleets of bombers and interceptors. Which makes the carrier or dread worth 10 times what those ships are worth. It should be able to put a fight up against a fleet of 10 or so. 
---
-Everything is still unbalanced in favor of the residents over the roamers. 
---
So it should be. They are the ones that have invested sometimes hundreds of hours and billions of isk to make it their home. Of course they should have home field advantage. Otherwise what’s the point of owning space? 
---
-. This cyno change will make it more likely to get fights without it being ruined by supers.
---
Not at all, for these sort of fights people will just suck it up and pay the price. What is has stopped is the individuals and fun cynos. They will now ONLY be used for massive blogs that can instantly control the field.
---
Cool thanks that's good to know. I roam wherever the wh spits me out in this case it was there space. Turning on effects is a good idea regardless of who I'm fighting its just another indicator that improves situational awareness.
---
&gt; Blood Raider sites drop blood raider BPCs. 
---
yeah, this is what i was thinking, the BRsites drop them, not explo things??
---
Well, lots of stuff isn't worth making, because some people do industry with their own mined minerals and don't think about what those cost.
---
But you'll also need 10me at the minimum and find a good place to make them.
---
I do everything in null.
---
Not quite exactly. Polarization mechanics at least guarantees you can immediately get back before having to deal with polarization consequences. Also you retain mobility within system and polarization timer is exactly 4 minutes (IIRC).
---
I’m waiting for goons, horde and no. To all come and say they were bad phoned. Seems how they roll, get a good fight don’t engage get all your batphones to come then engage and say you didn’t phone and it was all just luck they all turned up at the same time
---
I think he forgot to mention that you can't cloak either.
---
Obviously being unable to warp off is something you're fine with since that's how it currently works?
---
Same. Explains that one then. Nothing missed then. Thought it was a blackout.
---
With this fit and mid grade crystal set you can easly tank the stronghold. (Without the omega implant, the boost is still decent and it doesn't cost that much)
---
&gt; like another hub, preferably a mission hub.
---
But if you can't sell at Jita price, then you are generally better off buying at Jita price and selling in the hub, not manufacturing yourself anyway.
---
You could shoot him.
---
T3d don't give SP loss on death.
---
Its all individual limited engagements.
---
Just give up, salt post and enjoy the arguing. Best content right there
---
I didn’t mean this as an insult to hunters. This is the eve way. Lose is permanent, so of course you don’t want to take a fight you think you will lose. 
---
My issues is bait cynos were a way of hunting the hunters. Now to bait will require a cloaked reacon on grid as well. Which will often die as a result of the drop. 
---
It makes  baiting not worth it, which makes hunters safer again. 
---
If they find a vni at the moment there is a chance they will die attacking it because it was bait. After the patch there is very little chance it will fight back in anyway whatsoever
---
Skill point loss for T3D is stupid enough already.
---
you know you f'd up when stainguy has to correct you
---
&gt; result in a criminal flag u
---
Seriously? I thought it just entered you into the imited engagement
---
Переехать стоит. Ждать тут постов на русском - не стоит. Так что лучше вооружиться английским.

Ииии в таком случае встаёт вопрос - какая разница, кто здесь рускоязычный, а кто нет? Если проблема именно с английским, делать тут особо нечего.
---
Imo they should have a chance to drop a skill injector. :)
---
Well ... you can suck hard at EVE ...
---
But exercising is real exercise....
---
Elsewhere in the thread people blamed Manfred Sideous.
---
Now you can buy a sweet Stratios Skin
---
Basically another way for Hilmtard to loan out EVE resources (the players) to another company.
---
Cosmic Signatures are exploration.
---
At 10x the effort for anyone trying to use it. If you don’t have a large group of people constantly working on it, then you are effectively frozen out of it.
---
warp out, you are not even supposed to stay out of range, comet is way faster
---
if you are somewhat managing- well, let's be honest, tormentor vs comet is a losing fight everytime. maybe if its a bad fit, you could put your own drones on his drones and load gleam to kill the drones, but the fact that you still need to clear its drones is telling
---
breacher might do it, atron might do it... tormentor no, even though it is very strong t1 frigate
---
Aether wars is a possible end to tidi. CCP has a lot invested in the tech. You can barely call it a game - its just a quick asset flit, but the tech behind it will could determine the future direction of eve
---
In a large corporation that is built on taking chances on new players? Yes.
---
Horde has long since evolved ways to deal with it. You will be fine.
---
and people ACTUALLY think this shit is going to have a noticeable positive impact on EVE in the foreseeable future.  They can't even get the non-new parts (such as basic email keys) working.
---
Shouldn't you be saying something about farming billions of income in near 100% safety?
---
Imagine losing titans in battles in 2019

Kiki/Deacons will lay down the hurt through a crit hole any day of the week, even if you are in dreads.

At the rate they're going it'll only take 10 years before there's anything usable that may help EVE.  The odds of EVE being around that long are pretty LOL, at this point, though.
---
No it wouldn’t?? You could still roll a hole off damn quickly, especially if you live in a 5-5...
---
Wardec only
---
Some players don’t need a reason to go shoot people. Just having them there and it being relatively easy to get to them is all it takes to encourage roaming. 
---
If you are one of the many whose play style is to log in for huge wars and go glass an entire region, this change won’t affect you. But for those who play as often as possible, this change keeps the day-to-day from becoming stagnant and boring.
---
and this is why CCP continues to fail spectacularly after 10 years.  Everyone gives them the benefit of the doubt even when they continue to show they have no idea what they're doing, so they have no reason to improve.
---
Fun fact: Null is safer than high and low sec.
---
Right. We shouldn’t make any changes to Eve because people might drop Supercapitals on you. Logic checks out.
---
Many smallgang groups roam in expensive frigates or cruisers, these can easily range from 300m to 1.5B+ which is then approaching the price of a carrier...
---
107 is a perfectly fine prime number
---
Agreed. It is a full time job for those who try to find useful chains.
---
&gt;  I read here that they have not much dps
---
You were lied to.
---
Lokis are literally the new tackle frigate. Cloak, 30km point and web, tank 1K DPS.
---
Titans are the new attack BCs.
---
With the meta change to Myrms and Domis you can try bait solo/small groups of bombers by fitting a ton of tank to the Domi and having light drones, a long point and a grapple reads to go...
---
Are you retarded?
---
Oh honey... Things are only going to get worse for you.
---
It's made it 15.
---
But also, Aether wars isn't just about helping eve.
---
Shhhhh you weren't supposed to show everyone how awesome lowsec is for individual players.
---
It’s a fair bit below HAW dread DPS, let alone capgun dreads. Still, RR ‘Shaks are certainly very strong for C5 ratting.
---
With 2 characters? Rattles IMO because Geckos,, with 3+ Nestors because you can farm the Drifter.
---
900m in Drifter blue loot per site?  Yes please!
---
I had the same idea - but involving supers turning into mobile forts and transporting up to cruiser size ships
---
You can do rattlers with alpha characters
---
Or we could just delete c4 space
---
Nope, just hoping this was one big bug that can be patched away when they need more subscriptions again :)
---
What do you mean by it was avoidable?

If you're interested in learning more, you should listen to three classics, not this which is quite bad.

---
That idea is bad. It only works in null because they throw down empty citadels everywhere.
---
At least in j space there's usually always someone on in the same system so you just grab the guns and go to town. 
---
Also that'll be some nice free isk delivered to the undock
---
CCP vs Nullsec
---
Well not anymore in terms of doing ded sites ... at least when you're alone with one toon. No local and a big system means you don't see anyone entering, and someone who's experienced enough can combat probe you down in 1, max 2 runs. So in worst you have just a very very short window to spot you got combat probed down (so you basically have to press the d-button permanently). After that, they come with combat recons, have fun escaping.
---
Now just think about if you wanna put a 1B+ T3 or equally fitted ship into one of those sites.
---
Lowsec has local ... 0 in system? super safe to do the ded site.
---
If you wanna really wanna get people? Just pre-scan all nullsec systems in a region and take the best sites and have a cloaked guy sitting on the gate ... wait 30-45min for the next best tengu coming by. And now see it from the site of an explorer ... knowing everyone can do that everywhere ... would you risk your ship for a possible 0 drop in a site?
---
Keep crying, it's hilarious.
---
&gt;you can choose to remove
---
You cant make your hole completely safe unless you get balls lucky with the mass and put a hic through a few passes to super crit it. 
---
Either do that or accept the fact that enyos and booshes will come say hello to your 7 bil leshak fleet
---
Karmafleets probably the best new player Corp in null.  Check them out at www.karmafleet.org
---
Probably hisec incursions or NS/WH exploration.
---
Might be able to approach good numbers salvaging behind a ratting carrier.
---
Yes, but then you will ask, “why is all the rum gone?”
---
Fire vs Frat
---
Why is the rum always gone?
---
No, this is not the case, the BC has many bonuses that the Iki misses (Links!) and has a more balanced and easier to work with resist profile. For Heavy Armour fleets where you can’t bring Shaks the Drek is tankier than the Iki fit sustained periods of time.
---
Just make a flex FOB be like other small structures that decay after a set period of time (say, a week?) so that they can't be spammed because they're temporary.
---
5/10's are harder then 4/10 or 6/10 ... 5/10's have 3 web towers in the last room + full aggro you move with 50m/s and have to face tank everything. All other sites are a bit dependent on the faction, but they usually don't have any hard counters to your ship (except serpentis, their 6/10 are unfair in direct comparison).
---
Until it was abused to hell by people like gaara with ISBox input broadcasting 50 of them
---
*  MUCH less traffic 
---
* did not say it was safe
---
* make 3x as much
---
* no cynos
---
never said it was safe, but i guess if things like booshes are an issue and you dont setup a scram chain to combat that. that is not the games design fault.
---
WH's get ALOT of benifits for being so remote, when theyre not really remote at all.
---
oh you fight the drifters that DD everything that moves?
---
Fatfingered MJD on my marshal and then didn't warp off in time, got cobbed by 30 destroyers with our fax 100km away watching and laughing
---
More roaming holes, give more rats scrams. Wormhole space has been getting the D for years, these items just add more randomness. Also delete C4, they offer no value to anyone.
---
Not like nullbears will choose it over 50m/hr or 150-200mil/hr anyway.
---
for real, you rob a corp and you get your assets out. you don't hang around with your super playing innocent thinking theyll not catch on to you. you extract the characters and roll new ones.
---
No. Wormhole drifters are a joke to kill with a half fit dread.
---
like the chaos you wanted for nullsec? :P
---
Yea. I should have posted more concisely. What I wanted to say is that these things you have mentioned are not interesting for many or even interfering with activities of high-seccers.
---
Oh, you mean like how it currently is?  👍
---
&gt;Two leshaks are not enough to tank c5 in rr
---
Says who, because I do that shit all the time. If you're broke and use cheap fits yes they'll just die
---
Mine can do garrisons easy, but the stronghold you'd need to heat damage and reps to make it through.
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Hush! Keep it quiet!
---
Take my upvote
---
Oddly enough i have well had two. one blinged out for fleets and such and the other for yoloing and dropping on whatever.
---
I was in comms a few days ago with Tiny and he said that I should talk to yall about potentially joining for an episode if you talk about small gang ewar and the celestis.
---
Just Googled it. Have a few questions.
---
Wai, wha??
---
\&gt; implying we'd let Wildkins run CENTI
---
lmao
---
Anyways, if a neutral fleet lands that looks interested in fighting the people that are shooting your structure you wouldn't try to bubble them I suppose.
---
Нет, у меня нет с этим проблем. Я чётко описал о чем пост)
---
subplot: 
---
**FW: War never changes**
---
maybe he dont complain but just don't like the anti nullsec stuff whats going on when wormhole's are not really better as null before blackout in regards to savety/isk to risk metrics.
---
so? another would spawn immediately and so would its exit
---
Can you post your fit?
---
Форумы еще живы? О_о
---
New player corps like horde brave newbies and karmafleet are decent to get started. Also Eveuniversity seems like a great starter corp.
---
&gt;Then the majority of escalation sites end up in nullspace which I did not feel safe to fly into with my stratios.
---
why not though?
---
Acceleration gates, bro. Make it damn near impossible to catch guys.
---
Riiight, and when I’m tackled after someone rolls in through a connection I have no control over, with 100x more isk on grid than you and nearly guaranteed to die, I’ll just light my cyno and bring in reinforements too... oh wait
---
every small alliance can already be helicoptered by any of the big powers, the only difference is it needs atm 3 boring timers for the defender to not defend vs imperium/pandafam/legacy.
---
when i was a rookie i enjoyed exploring and hacking - now i am focused on making rigs for a nullsec corp.
---
Inflation is caused by more money existing in the system with the same number if things to buy. Any new isk creation increases inflation.
---
and what of the different ideas is bad?
---
Roaming gangs have not benefits the most, mate. Not by a long shot. The winner of that contest is blops and other covert mechanics.
---
In fact in my experience roaming gangs have a harder time now than they did before, since local was also an essential tool for them. Now they have no idea whether there are targets around, or if there's a 200 man defence fleet sitting off dscan near the next gate.
---
Not to mention that when they enter populated areas they'll immediately be spotted by scouts, negating much of the blackout benefits. And the locals will have bridges, cyno alts and shit giving them superior manoeuvrability.
---
i dont think this is a good opinion when they just learn the ropes of the game how to fly what is the overview etc.
---
Can you try that again please?
---
/r/eveporn
---
he maybe just used cheat engine lol. but the zpc stuff was broken as fuck i soloed 50 ships got 0 :P i killed 2 ships with 3 other dudes got 2k. i run 50secs into the cloud and hit r get 4k.
---
A lot of people here are going to suggest horde, karma fleet and brave newbies and other assorted shit tier blue doughnut corps/alliances. I’m gonna go against that meta and say that you should shop about for and look for a tight knit corp of good dudes that are willing to show you the ropes. Literally put feelers out to the area of space that you want to go do and talk to multiple corps. Do not just settle on the first one you pick and be smart and check their killboards if your looking for pvp. Ask about activity in time zones and let thier public channel ect confirm that they are not just fabricating their numbers for active people etc.
---
Only if the gankers are idiots. In order to bait someone you have to make them think you are indeed krabbing. I.e. you have to actually fight NPCs. Any smart ganker will just pile on top of the NPCs making it more or less impossible to tank for the Domi.
---
Of course you could clear a belt or an anom and then sit between the wrecks and pretend to be looting/salvaging. If the gankers are greedy they probably will try their luck. But this will work once and you'll kill 1 bomber, maybe 2 if they are stupid. But these guys will not fall for it twice.
---
I dunno what the other guy is saying, do NOT try to fight a Cynabal in an Ashimmu.
---
The Cynabal trades tank for speed, but as a pirate cruiser, can fight many things the same size as it. A lot of the Cynabal's power is being able to haze stuff that are smaller than it and escaping from stuff that's bigger, a true skirmish brawler. It also means:
---
*If you can get on top of it and hold onto it, it'll probably die to any similarly-sized true brawler.*
---
Unfortunately that makes fighting one tricky because they almost always have the option to disengage (making it hard to "counter" if flown well).
---
Regarding Chessur:
---
In general, blistering amounts of DPS reduce the length of the engagement, which amplifies player mistakes/hesitation, so you can get kills you otherwise might not have. I'd assume the enemy Cynabal in this case was an active armor fit and did not run their reps in time.
---
If you want to copy that, the Hecate can fairly easily reach ~800 dps.
---
Nullsec obv, what else would there be?
---
Neutral logis were being abused in high sec war fleets, so they made the penalty harsher. Not a perfect solution, but still an improvement.
---
Carthago delenda est!
---
Well you get zpc from kills only if they had zpc.
---
So most kills would give nothing.
---
Um, yes, yes they can.  You’re pretty dumb to think otherwise.  In fact, crit all the holes you like, I can guarantee there’s is still a way to get a full fleet into that hole to kill you, with very very little you can do to stop them.
---
Legacy vs fraternity
---
...I'm talking about using an alt to scram your own cyno ship to force the cyno timer to stop.
---
Looking forward to classic and raiding molten core again even if it has a crap res run when you wipe. Still play Eve though may unsub some of the less used characters depends on how well the molten core raids go.
---
How do you scout a capital blob that gets cynoed in?
---
“One carrier” you are looking at the problem in a vacuum. Truth is you get dropped 20 or 30 carriers and HAW dreads on you small gang not 1 carrier. Cap hulls are 800-900mil that’s insanely cheap coupled with their still good insurance
---
3x more, and sites respawn *wayyy* slower than they do in null
---
I do the same in null, because its more fun than anom ratting tbh.
---
They should remove this skillpoint loss all together. It takes long enough already to fly some ships properly with some more or less not as usefull skills taking 30days+
---
it's combat exploration signatures that you have to scan down ;)
---
Переехать пора. Давайте почистим тырнет от кривых форумов
---
ccp are doing things to shake up the sandbox. Reddit is all like "YOU GUYS ARE SO SCREWED NOW" but nullsec is like "WHAT ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY!" and the elite pvpers, wormtards and hisec daytrippers are dunking excavators and mobile tractor units like gangbangers.
---
Nullsec have responded by throttling their mineral exports and creating trade deals with other blocs. hisec may or may not burn like a thousand suns soon.
---
Can’t wait to yoink people into the lava 8)
---
Since CCP wants to make things harder, how about removing wormholes from WH space?
---
One more think: From what i see that you are making, most of the things you said have a very low margin. If you are making things in order to sell, i highly recommend looking for something else to make. For example: small caliber ammunition. Scourge Light missile sells very good at Jita for example. I know the raw money gain is not much, but if you are worried about stuff costing more money to build than its worth, then this is a solid option.
---
People shoot POS in HS too. So LS could deal with POSes just fine even without Dreads and Carriers.
---
Is it fun? No, but at least in LS it could lead to exciting fights when more people get attracted.
---
Explo isnt only data and relic. Combat sites from signatures is explo.

/r/evejobs
---
Not a whole lot tbh, OP just seems to think more connections in WH space is unwanted and because he is a little butthurt about changes to null, is requesting changes to WH space without know even in the slightest what he is really asking for 🤣
---
Lol what an arse hole. If you think CCP is on the verge of bankruptcy then it's up to you to prove it.
---
E-Uni does have you learn at your own pace.
---
Apply. Wait for a personnel officer to mail you saying that you've been approved to queue for an interview, queue up for an interview and hope that there's a personnel officer online to interview you (basically, if you're not spamming our chat channels with obscenities or something like that, you're getting in). Probably going to involve logging off, queuing up next time you're logged in for at least a few days.
---
Once you're in, you can do pretty much whatever as long as it's not something that violates the neutrality policy (shooting structures without director specifically authorizing, Spectre Provi StratOps, for example) or something that would get you suspect or criminal in High-Sec (in LS, you can pod the fuck out of people and get yourself as many criminal timers as you want, though). It's encouraged, but not mandatory, to head on down to a campus and do stuff there because that means that there's a decent amount of people who you can do stuff with (and will be glad to show you how to do stuff). Most people head over to either the High-Sec Campus or the Amarr Mining Campus because there's an excess of carebears in the Uni, but the other campuses can be viable options. Low-Sec Campus is likely going to get you more use out of the cheap frigates that new players typically fly because of affordability, for example, and while its future is uncertain right now (manager who built the current LSC from the ground up a few months ago resigned a couple of weeks ago because of real-life time commitment, a lot of the services that brought people out there, such as market and lootsheet are being suspended), it has tight-knit community and is worth checking out.
---
There are no mandatory classes. There are a decent number of classes posted on the in-game calendar, most of which only require you to be in public Mumble, and you are encouraged to listen to whichever classes fit your interests. Learn at your own pace.
---
And you said that you want a corp with action. Again, that depends on the campus. Amarr Mining Campus is not an action-packed place. Even has a rule that you're supposed to minimize PVP so war targets don't go over there looking for content. On the complete other end, Wormhole Campus can get up to lots of crazy stuff, depending on connections, but it's a bit much for a new player (at minimum, need Cloaking IV, a cloaky scanning ship, and a navy or assault frigate, along with the Freshman title that requires a week in-corp and 30 days of character existing, it's generally a good idea to be able to fly more stuff than that so you can make ISK to afford replacing those ships, brand-new players probably can't do much else besides gas Venture). Project Solitude is probably the most boring campus because while there's more action than AMC, there's barely anyone there to do stuff with. The people there are great, there just aren't enough if them to do much interesting stuff.

Source: Am member.

God help anyone that wants to go on a move op anymore and isn't in primetime for their alliance.
---
wh's have statics to null, sry to dissapoint you
---
Crazy thought but, they would likely do what everyone has been telling people in null to do... put a scout on the entrance
---
Wow what an arse hole. Put words into peoples mouths so you can keep living your fantasy why don't you.
---
This is probably the biggest buff to goons that has ever been added to the game. If goons are going to have a harder time protecting their krabs with the largest super fleet and best organization, everyone else is basically fucked.
---
I agree with you, low sec should be the place where new and seasoned players can get there PVP experience untill they have the skills to fly capitals (an entering stage for Null)  and not a place where you get dropped by capitals. At least they should ban them in FW low sec systems.
---
Having supers tether instead of dock, just adds more logistical chore. I'm sorry that you don't have a ~~fully armed and operational battlestation~~ keepstar, but going back to more tedious times doesn't help the game.     
---
Besides, the number of supers we have in our hangars at home doesn't really mean anything, as long as the terrible sov system is still there and nobody invades.
---
bUt eVeRYtHinG iN eVE Is pVP
---
less actual work. sounds good to me. leaves you with more time to roll those holes xD
---
Well, when you can be doing 400m/hr doing lv5 in lowsec... That nullbears ticks are a little lmao.
---
But Even there. I make a Lot of isk in low sec explo. I hoy toe to toe with my friend from Null ratting in a carrier and, my Loki cost half than a ratting Carrier.
---
(I use a Carrier to Blitz LV5 when we have enogh umbrella and for hyper Blitz Besiged covert research sites)
---
attempt 3 at you avoiding the question. 
---
i dont think they are, if they were, they have injectors now (which i hate too) so im sure theyre fine with those pumping currency like no tomorrow
---
It doesn't really affect new players. If you want to jump straight into a war then Dreddit is recruiting.
---
It wasn´t your mistake, you undocked, got into a fleet and were ready to fight! You did everything right!
---
ANY ship could have a cyno fit, so the guy telling you to scout is either trolling you or has no clue.
---
Our small gang almost always outnumbered. If we see a miner though of course we are going to kill him. Instead of crying try bringing a gang of equal size against the hunters and believe me they are going to fight more times than not. Don't bring your cancer supers if you want a fight its as simple as that.
---
DED sites also exist as escalations rather than as scannables. Since supers still rat you can buy the escalations from them and still make money.
---
Do they supply with ships or something, or do they expect for a completely new player to be able to get everything themselves?
---
stop being salty, nullcarebear
---
You know all those "combat site" things you immediately tune out of when you see because they aren't relic sites?
---
firstly. your tackled. pretty rare compared to nullsec ratting already due to attractive, ease and traffic.
---
now the chance of being tackled by something you cant deal with as a group/ alone with your alts?
---
all of this reduced chance by hole rolling opportunities.
---
im not saying WH space is safe, but compared to nullsec right now, it is safer all in all.
---
Esi is dead. That's why nothung works atm
---
I’m just trying to simulate blackout in J space. Since there’s no cynos in wormholes you can easily watch every route into a hole, so krabbing is extremely safe. With this change, wormholers would have no idea how many cloaked t3s were watching them rat, just like it is in k space right now
---
guess im wrong, but i dont see scanned down COMBAT sites as 'exploration'
---
however OP does say 'few sites later' just me scan reading the title i guess.
---
New players are looked after very well. Lots of free ships and resources.
---
&gt;Also, " I am not generally a PvP player ", say goodbye to the little credibility this thread had.
---
So if he doesn´t mainly focus on PVP his opinion is worthless?
---
And you do realize he said capitals and supercapitals? So what does your comment have to do with anything?
---
Warping as new player with a Helios with 350mio in cargo into a occupied FW plex, because I wanted to see what that thing is. RIP.
---
So yes
---
Ya for sure. It's also your only bet of getting away from a fast tackle ship that's holding point at 20km. Warriors or acolytes and maybe a set of EC-300 are good for pesky small ships and trying to get away. 
---
It's not too expensive to fill that drone bay up. I think I had 2 heavy sets 2 medium and 2 lights. And extra drones or something. Man it holds a lot of drones lol. Some ppl label them as dmg type and size but whatever helps organize it for yourself.
---
i think wormholes should be fixed, and only XL capital holes have mass limits. unlikely as this is a bit picky. but it removes the ability to 'choose' on either side. would make nullsec and WH space more dangerous.
---
but alot of things Wormholers have been saying have been far too pro WH's, instead of actually making it harder.
---
your idea i understand would have its difficulties, but also strengths and pros for the WH itself
---
Citadel drifters dont drop loot
---
SP loss is just an isk value now because of injectors
---
Eyes on their staging? Often the caps will start mass undocking / logging on before the cyno is lit, giving you a very obvious que.
---
Alt with shipscanner? Can even be in a throwaway ship so it doesn't matter if it dies and can reship all the time
---
Don't make it sound like it's impossible. These people are just being lazy. Does it sucks that caps were dropped on them? YES!
---
But there IS counterplay.
---
Hopefully though, not having bait cynos be an issue also means hunters will take more even fights, since the effort to bring in a huge defensive fleet is now higher.
---
We need more wormholes, wormhole space is getting rather crowded
---
The answer appears to be yes!
---
That would be pretty terrible, the ability to roll for them pvp is what makes wormholes nice and not everyone is able to defend themselves against hostile caps, which rules out living in c5/c6 space. It also allows wormholers to blob as much as they want, buffs nullsec using wormholes to move thousand man fleets, and a couple other changes that are bad in pretty much every way.
---
If there was 900m of loot and the same mechanisms as the Drifter Incursions then sure.
---
More like: FW never gets changes
---
Hmm that must be a empty low sec with a tones of cosmic signatures btw nice job would be nice to share fit :D
---
yes I did, before I posted. Did you have a reason for asking?
---
move more fleets, sounds like more destruction to me,
---
and i did state capital holes to be limited the same way...to aid this issue about capital movement. well. stop it happening. (or maybe moving a jump capable ship through the hole once would collapse it completly.
---
allows wormholers to blob? well vice versa, more death, nullsec vs wormholers much much more death.
---
and to finish, 
---
&gt; the ability to roll for them pvp is what makes wormholes nice 
---
Sorry, i didnt realize Chaos era is suppose to be 'nice' for everyone at all times?
---
No i don't talk about various WH types. 
---
Let say new WH spawns, it is N432 at this moment the total mass is  randomized and it can be +- 40% of the base ^current value.
---
DED sites in a stratios? Escalations or scannable sigs?
---
im talking about the drifters that DD ships and one shot them, not the ones you farm for isk, or are they the same thing? do the incursion ones DD the ratters?
---
Sure when you have an alt to sit there. But not everyone has that. And unfortunately not all DED sites requires you to take the gate (only one i know that is like that, but so far i didn't do any existing DED site from every faction, so can't tell if there isn't another one). Besides some DED sites disrupt, web, neut and in the wrong moment, you cannot get out fast enough.
---
Just take Maze ... you're about to start, get into the first room, maybe 5-6 frigates to disrupt ... bad timing means they are faster in your site, then you're done with those frigates.

I don’t get the allure to WoW classic. Do people forget how punishingly grindy the old MMO experience was?
---
Wormholerd VS C4 Space
---
The ones in WH don't DD but you are talking about the incursion style ones that do.  As long as they drop 300m of loot people are fine, the DD only goes off once every so often so you can tempt them into DDing cheap ships then kill them, hence why CCP pulled the Drifter incursions after a few weeks when people figured out how to farm them for great isk/h.
---
Anything PvE will either get farmed if its worthwhile or it will get ignored, there isn't much in-between.  Much better to let PvP provide the risk, as per the changes to Null they have done.  If that means WH mechanics change then that's fine, WHers will adapt accordingly.  Note that the hunters in null aren't those just carebearing in WHs so they really will relish more connections or random WHs etc.
---
There’s a whole lot of people rolling holes looking for krabs in WH space friend, null isn’t the only static being rage rolled for content
---
And I’m not sure how many alts you think people commit to ratting in a bear hole, but it sure isn’t enough to deal with a fleet buddy 🤣
---
If it’s that much safer null sec and that much easier to take a hole and create an alt army capable of fending off a fleet then come join and you can quit crying about null being so dangerous all of a sudden.  WH space would welcome another player willing to risk billions to rat, especially the one who think they’re safe in there 😁

I may or may not have attacked a Sigil on a null-highsec gate, burning my guns out, getting scram/web/neuted by the Sigil and then dying like a peasant to a single Sabre in my Hecate after I hit reload on my ancil repper for no real reason while showing a friend EvE...
---
ok, so a NEW mechanic,
---
closing a hole, or simply periodicly spawning Drifter battleships that roam, pop up and DD your ratters without your 'permission'. sounds nasty. loosing blingy ships. thats more blackout level for WH's
---
osrs is more hardcore
---
Once you fit a capital it is no longer cheap. The hull might not cost too much after insurance but you are fitting hundreds of mils worth of capital parts and fighters in them. 
---
And yeah often people drop way more than is needed, but they also aren’t looking for a fair fight. They are often defending their pve and miners. They don’t want a fight at all, they just want you to leave. 
---
If you come into a system stack someone who isn’t set up for pvp and has no chance of beating you and then get dropped by a group that outnumbers you so that you have no chance of winning. What’s the issue? You want to gank people with them having no chance to respond? Or should you expect them to do the exact same thing You just tried?
---
Well if you're living in a bigger community in null, that might apply to you. But the normal little guy, that has to work on his own for escalations, it looks a bit different. Like OC wrote ... escalations in nullsec are very dependent on where they are. Like if i get an escalation, in 3 out of 5 cases, they are in a system, that i don't even have to go to, to start them, as they are owned by enemies and their systems are pretty active. So they realize pretty quick when you start doing any DED sites there. Combat probes assured within 5min. And with no local even doing the sites is risky. Not everyone has tons of toons to have them on gates, so doing the sites is usually pretty risky nowadays. And when you're working the whole day, like probably most people in eve, when coming home you're not really in the mood to rat, get maybe an escalation, maybe have it in an enemy system, so not able to do it, or close to their systems, so still risky to get hunted down by some random DED hunters.
---
Even though i like the blackout from a pvp perspective, from a ded site running perspective it's too risky in many cases. So my amount of running sites, basically decreased from pre-blackout 2-3 DED sites per day, to now 2-3 DED sites per 2-3 weeks.
---
A big bloc like goons, test or horde will give you skill books, free ships to both make money in and fight and will give you isk to replace ships lost on fleets. They'll also have training programs and mentors. Everyone is really friendly and helpful unless you are a complete tool
---
Lol fucking pot calling kettle black
---
im saying currently WH's and Nullsec are equally dangerous. but nullsec has more traffic.
---
You attack a ship that you think has no chance of fighting back, and then cry when the defenders do the exact same thing? Ok that sounds reasonable
---
Yes, must nickel and dime dev time only for stuff you care about...  Try thinking about someone besides yourself.
---
Which they are welcome to do. It doesn’t change the fact that a proper fit capital is at least going to be 1.5+ bil.
---
Doesnt that end up halfing the mobility between holes? Today, we have our static, a Null Door, 3 k162s and one or two data / relics. 
---
Most of our content comes from entering the K162s and hunting since we know it was at least active from their side at one point.
---
You can fit most capitals for &lt;300m worth of mods
---
Aaaaand low-sec Genesis has a five-fold increase in visitors.
---
I'd go for the Nestor, scales up better due to remote reps and aligns almost twice as fast. Also less mass and a scan bonus should you get stranded
---
As long as they add some counter play element like D-Scan or Local Alert.
---
Моя сестра - деревенский велосипед, а мама в холодильнике.
---
when did you guys go to fw? i miss rvb, great times when i was new in hisec. bit of a shame in some ways that newbie corps like horde made it harder for rvb.
---
counter play like hisec gets against its triglavian invaders? :D
---
Wormholes take a bit more to harass, but when you do you take everything including the foundation. 
---
There is no asset safety.
---
Aren't they marked on the map?
---
The black out is the worst thing that's ever happened to Eve!  
---
Except now all that loot is worth more.  Good for you!
---
Sweet. So classics when they fuck the cyno’s completely off right?
---
[removed]
---
Well, it’s not like no local was a completely positive change for nullsec with no downsides. Fly to providence if you need proof of that. And you could also make this only apply to static holes, so wandering connections work normally. 
---
Basically it would mean less people moving around but a lot more risk and it would make doing pve pretty much suicidal, just like in nullsec. Not actually a very good change at all in my opinion, but certainly an interesting one, and perfectly in line with all the other changes they’ve been making for the chaos era
---
yes, i guess there could be a picture warning of drifter in wormhole system. but im thinking these would be pretty permanant. making the warning somewhat meaning less
---
I wanna know this too
---
It's pretty good, you don't have to frame the situation as you v the entire game
---
I do all the time, like right now I’m thinking how sad and pathetic it is to honour someone’s legacy with a dumb cyno vigil
---
&gt;Being solo in null
---
Found the problem. But that aside no one can gank you in a DED site unless you let them. They must decloak on the entrance gate to get in. Giving you ample opportunity to get out of there and consider the site lost. This goes for scanned sites as well. 
---
And things should not be balanced around the time investment of someone who can never play.
---
That is correct :) If they continue like this, we will soon see Eve private servers just like we did wow. I myself would like a rollback to triple ancil Rorqs :)
---
That sentence isn't bullshit:
---
See Rorquals after they were changed from a boost machine to a mining monster
---
See Carriers/Supers ratting after the buffs to tracking
---
See Titans ratting after the above (plus injectors) allowed everyone to get into a cheap Titan faster.
---
Which part is bullshit?
---
If you're worried about the cost, sure.  But the better way to look at it is not every ship should be an affordable isk/hour of pvp boat.  Not everyone can afford a titan (well not yet), but they are still probably fun to fuck around with if you can afford one.
---
SP farm if you're all out of useful shit to train
---
And rorqual idk printing took inflation on a wild ride. What's your point
---
Because you have narrowly defined exploration as only the easiest to get at lowest hanging fruit.
---
duh, it ain't goons
---
How about one way wormholes as exit doors only. They don't appear on the inlet system. 
---
 Add high chance of Thera and those Blender systems they call Drifter Systems.
---
You already never know when dura lexx will roll into your dreads.
---
Cant wait for it to release il be playing that when eve is dead
---
Is that the carebear heaven?
---
The PC is being offered to whoever was at the top of the leaderboard, which is obviously difficult to do if your client kept crashing or whatever. If it was a random draw I think it would've been better. Things not working is fine, it was never advertised as a working product, but tying prizes to leaderboard stats at this early a stage is never going to work out well.
---
alwas crit/reduce the hole when moving caps in solo. i learnd my lesson 2wise. but not as expensive as yours.
---
The timer would be removed, they don’t have Battleship tank. Dps isn’t to shabby the rest depends on what you want to do neuts and smart bombs come with their fitting drawback. I’m thinking give it a Covert cloak but I’m not against nerfing something to accommodate. Also the cyno will be gone. Personally I think that should be recon cruiser only attribute
---
'Rve private servers' is something even more retarded than your original shitpost.
---
I just sold the Isk and it was never actually tracked. Never understood why people feel the need to be edgy to get around the "system".. CCP are not that good at detecting this tbh and you are more likely to be flagged for this than just sending direct isk.
---
Not necessarily, but it is how the game worked when I started playing. And how I would like it to continue to work.
---
Come home. Beans need roasting.
---
Thats exactly why we moved to FW. Eve changed. Skill injectors. Big blocks where you can be part of big null battles on day one. We got low numbers and then our glory leadership took us there.
---
NOW we have alot of fun and the numbers raised again. 20ppl plus fleets everyday now are pretty common.
---
I know :)
---
Damn, well happy retirement and I hope in a few years when I retire I’ll be either same position or at least have a healthy tsp.
---
You also need to invest 10b + ~75m in SP across 4 accounts locked inside the wormhole, need to protect your own assets personally and then still can't really do anything against groups ragerolling a C5-&gt;C6 or a C5-&gt;C5 at a rate of 1 wormhole every 3 minutes.
---
Nullsec on the other hand, you can just rat/mine on your main/useful alts if you want.
---
Oh, ty for this large answer :D
---
I think they actually miss it. I mean, live wow is a joke compared to how it used to be. The sense of meaning was lost along the way.
---
Im curious why is there no SOE capitals or dread level ships?
---
Yes, now I can finally have the safety I always wanted by having no people entering my space
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77326875/
---
Play eve for 11 years never once lost a capital, survived Asakai, B-R5RB, HED-GP etc etc, first time ratting in a carrier lose it immediately.
---
You mean not getting to put your toy in perfect safety, because you're in a big bloc ( because if you're not your not getting a keep star ) means you would mean a majority your members would quit? 
---
Like really, you do get this is a privilege really only enjoyed by the big null blocs right? 
---
You essentially saying if I don't get to have this massive advantage I'm not playing.
---
Test is putting up pretty good content at the moment.
---
Chaos era, give any wormhole with a Highsec static a new shiny concord gate making the connection always on..
---
There is at least one DED site where you don't have to take gates ;)
---
Serpentis Logistical Outpost ... 
---
unfortunate for me, we're in serpentis space + the site scrams, webs, neuts. One combat probe run and they're on top of you.
---
And i am not saying i don't play alot, i simply say that i am usually not in the mood because of reasons that let me prefer trying to get fights (which i fail usually). So i rather spend 4 hours in trying to fight someone and the last 30-45min i am not starting to do some random DED site that gives me the overseers effect for 60min and no drop ... (happened too often)
---
In short: Eve RMT is no longer profitable and there are other renting empires out there. CCP once mentioned that Russia was 5% of total subs...
---
xxDeathxx stopped being PvP alliance over a decade ago. They used PL/NC. For a while to keep space but we’re finally removed from map by StainWagon and never recovered. But the core issue is RMT - lots of “Dedicated”eve players simply moved to other games to make money. 
---
There are other minor reasons like Ukraine / Russia fallout and the resulting drop in critical mass of players necessary. The idea of “nation space” in Eve was always bad and cross border groups finally won out.
---
Sorry. I will hold on to it and hope that one day I can login again and this bad dream/dark chapter is over and my toys can once again see the light.
---
Yeah counterplay if you have a highly organized group that can put in a ton of effort/manpower in order to have a low sec roam where you don´t get dropped by capitals. That´s what Null is for imho.
---
This counter is just asking way too much from the normal players or smaller groups.
---
Though there was a reason a lot of MMOs went away from the grind 1000 mobs to level gameplay. Players were catching on to the fact that it was just a shitty way for Devs to create time barriers for them to create new content.
---
I 100% agree with this statement. Why did this happen in the first place? Make WH great again!
---
if your remove capitals from low sec then CCP needs to undo all the small gang bullshit changes they have imposed on nullsec, and build a wall between low sec and null.
---
Now's about the time some ambitious corp / alliance adapts and takes advantage of the evolving meta and changes the landscape of the nullblock meta.
---
If we are all being honest something drastically needed to change in null anyway. It had become stagnant with very little incentive to take or change sovereignty. 
---
Somebody will capitalize (no pun intended) on the laziness and complacency of the status quo blocks.
---
Some of these comments are just fucking dumb. People bitching because they can no longer farm enough in 24 hours to replace a cap ship? The no risk all reward days are gone and they should be.
---
CCP's, shitting all over null , your turn will come.
---
Dreddit is the biggest reddit Corp in eve. They are the largest corp in Tedt alliance please ignore. 
---
Brand new players are welcome the only requirement is you have an active reddit account that is over 3 months old.  They provide free basic ships to newbros, have a wiki and forum for members to use as well as a 1 on 1 mentor program if you want to you it. 
---
Dredditisrecruiting.com for all info
---
things are pretty stagnate in Null right now as there is really no reason to fight over sov.  With the upcoming cyno changes, there is even less incentive to take territory.  
---
About the only movement right now is the mop up from FRT / Legacy and the rest of Null turtleing.
---
I do believe that there's propaganda in Eve, correct?
---
someones got salt issues huh xD
---
I'm sure you will enjoy retirement, I know I have even though I'm not retired.  I separated at 37, did three years as a contractor at the staff college, another seven at the military academy, two in Afghanistan as a contractor, one-year teaching at the Ukraine military academy, and another six years (still in Ukraine) doing other things.  It's been a great ride so far, and one hell of an adventure.  Next stop may be Africa (contractor), or back to using games for training, not sure yet.
---
Someone mentioned adjusting d-scan so that the further away the object is the less info you have. e.g.
---
&lt; 0.1 AU - Drake
---
&lt; 1 AU - Battlecruiser
---
&lt; 2 AU - Ship
---
&lt; 5 AU - Metal object (not a rock)
---
&lt; 10 AU - Uknown floaty thingy in space
---
&gt; 10 AU - Stuff
---
Scanning ship modules could improve the accuracy of the info for the pilot scanning. A module could also make someone else scanning your own ship more difficult.
---
Enable local and disable dscan
---
Really fuck with their brains
---
Yes I know combat probes is a thing
---
 I’m debating on doing a contract stint back in Afghanistan, good pay for my skill set and help create a  decent nest egg after the initial retirement.
---
Yeah that's what I figured.  From all of the recommendations it doesn't seem like I need to carry all four damage types.
---
Yes, let me lose my 3.5m sp at once. That can be upwards of 35 injectors to replace that depending on your sp amount.
---
yea,tryed a 5/10 yesterday with a gnosis and managed to rock the first 2 rooms but the 3 rd one...i had no ideea that those statis towers were going to screw me that bad

"oh look another "*game is too hard for me, make it easier reeee*" post"....cough hypocrite cough
---
&gt;One of the posters repeatedly crying in these threads ever since CCP started this chaos shit
---
&gt;I'm a hunter
---
Doubt.
---
Imagine thinking people will join private servers to fucking rorqual mine
---
Is two frigate alts too much to ask? One has to train a cloak!!
---
Jesus fuck dude. If you think two alts is a lot to ask then idk anymore.
---
But NS has choke point + dead-end systems with stationary gates, if suddenly there is 4-5 wormholes appeared you have to scan for each and during the scanning time enemies can enter to system and camp.
---
One Eden is the one true Strat skin.
---
Even CCP cannot deny it
---
Eh, if you are back for a year that's still more than most games get played by a single person, so yeah, they're still clearly doing something right.
---
Serpentis Logistical Outpost, open first pocket. Very unusual arrangement. But i can extrapolate that to all ded sites are equally as dangerous.
---
&gt;And i am not saying i don't play alot, i simply say that i am usually not in the mood 
---
Well too bad.
---
Why haven't you shared with us your prize?
---
It's always enjoyable to see the kill when someone describes in such details how it came to happen! o/
---
All in all, great hunt, Ive learned a lot by reading in this post.
---
That was a good read, hopefully it’s the last time anything like that happens to you. 
---
He’s not the brightest bulb to stick around with his titan after that :D
---
I don't understand. You can't attack people in hisec. Or are there some special rats spawned somewhere you have to go find?
---
omg
---
I lost a carrier to a Fortress when i just started out doing missions.
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
Yes, please come if you have the motivation to learn the game
---
It does have battleship tank. Its broken, you are being silly.
---
I assume at some point the GMs will either get suicide ganked or else go suspect so people can actually shoot them.
---
Any guesses which group will have the most bots whacked?
---
I guess i won't bother then. I'm not much into suicide ganking.
---
Не. лучше оставайтесь на ивсрушечке.
---
I insta-popped a 12 day old WH exploring Heron pilot at a Data Site using Dread Guristas Torpedoes. It had to happen.
---
Then about 3 minutes later the pilot came back to the exact same site in another Heron..... I felt bad, but insta-popped it again. I probably spent more on Torpedoes and Nano-Paste than their ship cost.
---
I flung them 5m Isk as comp.
---
Are you me?
---
yeah, why would I be upset the number people I can find and kill has dropped along with the player count?
---
Last time i checked CCP merely provided the assets used in the test to the company actually doing tze test.       
---
They also said it's unlikely the aether engine can be used for eve, but maybe there are still things to be learned.     
---
This will not end TiDi.
---
Actually wh only spawns to other side if you warp to the signature. Even if you warp to it, it doesnt spawn immediately but starts to throw a random yes/no every hour if K162 spawns or not. So if you close hole and never warp to new sig the exit doesnt spawn.
---
One more typical goon cry post. How about changing of subbredit op?
---
I want a open world experience which gives a sense of discovery and accomplishment like when i do something  will i get "wow did i just do that" or when i visit places will there be moments like "i am just gonna sit here and look at this"
---
Well that particular site is in fact very unusual. It has 2 escalation stages + direct warpins (you can make safes and warp in and out whenenver you want), but scrams, webs, neuts, has 3 pockets in the first stage and 2 rooms in the 2nd + the 2nd room in the 2nd escalation stage has 10 waves, with multiple scrams, webs and even neut. In total, that one escalation with travel probably takes around 1,5-2h of your time.
---
In comparison a guristas one ... 20min top. Now you might see why even if you get the escalation are more like "nah, not in the mood to spend that much time now" especially when your first escalation is already in a staging system of your enemy.
---
Of course we don't let a kill go. You guys have a choice whether to drop caps or bring subcaps because its YOUR SOV. Choosing caps is what makes you a coward. Also the most ironic part is that we just don't engage you when you bring cancer so you deny yourselves content by being cowards
---
Sounds like you are doing a great job leading your members. How long have you played yourself, if you don't mind me asking?
---
fcs don't light cynos, lol
---
And there used to be a decent number of null to null wormholes.
---
&gt;Naturally, some more pvp minded people don't want more npcs... especially npcs that might be under control/direction of other players.
---
I think any pvp minded people want more people to undock. Having a game that feels alive and where people do shit, is the whole reason for us playing eve.
---
And that right there is the Hyprocracy of this curricular Argument, depending on which side of the fence you sit.
---
ackshually i was talking about a change in that, as op is about the changes -  i know how whs work right now
---
It can survive long enough for caps to arrive, that's exactly the goal of locking Cynos to Force Recons and Black Ops ships.
---
A cyno shouldn't be a light and wait for everyone to formup. It should be more tactical and planned (ie: caps are ready, get the cloaky recon on grid, get in position and then light). It shouldn't be just light it as a one stop shop solution
---
Run, run now
---
Combat sites from signatures ARE explo.
---
You just get out there and start exploring to see what you find.
---
Even they are not high end, they are faster. So running 5/10 and 6/10 can be very lucrative. (As you can see from the screen shot in OP) BR5/10 can be a little tricky in it's 3rd room. You need some tank. The BR6/10 need a lot LESS tank. But at the end you need to be capable of output some DPS to break NPC tank. They Rep a lot.
---
they jettison the stuff and abandon the can so ppl can loot it
---
I admit that I mostly gang crabs and miners.
---
You know why? Because it's the only content that I'm able to find so far... OK sometimes we meet another small gang randomly but it's very very uncommon. The game doesn't naturally provide good fights... Today the only way I could find a real fight is to go in FW. Its sad because it's simplify the game to : warp to a novice plex and fight.
---
&gt;100% safety
---
You have no idea how wormhole rolling works do you?
---
Put 1bil in a tyra and you will be "much into suicide ganking"
---
&gt;“One carrier” you are looking at the problem in a vacuum.
---
But this views the problem in a similarly narrow way, the view from a big alliance with a massive capital reponse fleet on hand.
---
wormholer btw.
---
Life is too static atm. \*heh\*
---
I want to spice up the WH gameplay.
---
Every level of Industrial Command Ship will give you 10% bonus to drone mining yield, so get that to IV at the very least. It also expands your ore hold by 5%, meaning you can mine for 5% longer. After that, you need T2 mining drones and that's pretty much it to maximize ISK/hr.
---
For safety, you might want to get a T2 tank (bulkheads and shield resist mods), a few levels of Shield Command (to get a Shield Command Burst to boost your shields, mining boosts don't affect drones IIRC) and T2 light drones to fight off rats.
---
Now, before you start, know that there are reports that Triglavian ships have started appearing in ore fields in hisec, killing mining drones and miners (but no official announcement from CCP). Your T2 tank is good enough that  you can last a while against the triglavians, but it's probably a bad idea to go completely AFK for 3 hours. I don't know how frequent they are and if it's going to be a permanent fixture of hisec or simply a temporary test by CCP, but it's something to think about.
---
You are aware CCP said "we know we'll lose players, but fuck them", right?
---
Thanks!
---
After PL or one of their pawns dropped a freeport fortizar between my alliance's home and FCON's main trade hub in Immensia, I was trying to move all my assets and firesale all my stuff because I saw the writing on the wall when FCON declined to do anything about it. Mind you this was before TRI invaded. I lost almost a billion which at the time was most of my wealth.
---
It took me several months in Karmafleet to recover from that loss.
---
Actually lived in a WH for a while so I know enough about it to know what you mean. I was just referring to the OP. He was talking about pretty much 100% safety and to Olmeca and the CCP crusade to remove making billions in so much safety.
---
With time/effort spent Eve has given me some of the biggest "wow" moments I've ever had in gaming.  
---
It's worth getting into if you're able to make that time investment and understand it's a harsh place to be, you'll lose stuff but if you treat that as a learning experience rather than a point of frustration, you'll be fine.
---
GTFO cyka blyat
---
The game is beautiful that's for sure. You will definitely remember the time you almost lost everything
---
Ah a rare double wrapped spoiler!
---
ah nvm, sr i was retarded.
---
Lmao buddy...
---
CCP has explicitly said they do not care about short term subscriber loss if it'll improve the long-term health of the game.
---
*You'll be waiting a while,  methinks*
---
Olmeca came out multiple times saying that his playstyle was nerfed by a lot of the changes. He can't boosh excavators anymore because nobody is using them at the moment. Also, most miners are not AFK anymore, so they can usually use their PANIC module before he can kill them with dreads. He also soon won't be able to cyno the dreads as easily because of the cyno changes. His kills have nearly dried up because nullsecers are actually paying attention to the game, even after he invested a couple trillions in his dread pilots and booshers. He also needs to adapt.
---
Tell me how often do you get a single carrier dropped on you and a blob of them?
---
Thanks for the answers guys. Downloading the game. Grinding shouldn't be an issue since i have played looter shooters but one last question. There isn't that big of a difference between premium and non premium right? And can i buy premium using in game currency?
---
I can't imagine the goal of the cyno change is to kill all big fights that make eve famous in the news.
---
But can you multi box 5+rorquals, watch Netflix, and be impossible to kill thanks to super umbrellas?
---
r/PointOfNoReturn
---
Wormholes don't have asset safety, mass limits, there are no bounties, no sec status gains, no escalations. It's already tougher shit that null.
---
Makes sense
---
Wormholes have been chaos from day one, princess.
---
It already is, but by a lesser percentage
---
Lol I cant shame a poverty fit titan. At least he *had* one, unlike myself.
---
I think you will have your "wow" moment. But you need to be patient and accept that this is a pvp game and some people will **** you hard. Well you will **** people as well.
---
Thank you for the complete answer! I actually went around pyfa&amp;evemon and I needed around 1.5M SP to fly the orca with reasonable yield, that's a bit too much at the moment. The thing I had in mind was that I have two codes for 1month omega, but already used similar code for all my main accounts. I'm trying to get the maximum out of that 1month omega, but not sure I will use those accounts to rat with because I'd need to buy 2 more rattles for them.
---
So I'm not sure haha, they would be kinda useless while training to fly an orca. Need to get my accounts sorted. I still feel like it might be a good idea to have a miner in one of my accounts, just no idea on which one..!
---
Everything is relative. And is also dependant on how the new owners respond to this. They have fucked over a lot of players with these changes, and a lot of them whales with alot of subs. Let's see how the pipe sounds in 6 - 12 months :)
---
Access to ships and the skills required to do some of the more interesting things is kinda a big thing.  Treat the non-premium account as an unlimted trial imo. 
---
You can buy gametime (plex) with the currency (isk) via the ingame market.  Beware, scamming in game via it's mechanics is competley legit.
---
delete this!
---
Are you gay? You might be a content creator
---
I mean, having a pulse is basically the only requirement to join KarmaFleet, they are definetely the lowest common denominator corp of the Goons. FYI, we're saying that Karmafleet is the feeder corp of the goons in the sense that they feed the alliance, they're one of the main entry point of the goons, not that they constantly feed ships.
---
Taking away brick tanked cynos won't remove capital fights.
---
Capital fights will need to be planned and intentional with everything standing by and ready for the jump.  What this removes is the lazy Nix ratter with a cyno that just lights and waits five minutes for the umbrella to get there act together.
---
I recommend the Nestors. They can get the job done much cheaper because they can refit off each other during the site. 2 of them can duo all c5 anoms, but you can shed the excess tank for more dps when it's not needed.
---
Dual Leshaks probably are faster, but at 1.6B each I think you're better off training a Naglfar. Or you can use a far less blingy Leshak fit and trio.
---
Well, as a player I do not accept the changes they have made to my sandbox and the framework I started playing in. Therefore I cannot in good conscience subscribe or risk my assets on terms that I do not agree with anymore. And there are a lot more players that feel like I do. Let's see what happens in 6 - 12 months :)

That's what the random permanent connections would be for
---
Played eve for 8 years my dude. Never touched fortnite but I know its not too harsh, but saying noone loses is absolutely ridiculousness.
---
Just hard cap the amount of caps m8
---
so plex and premium is different. alright thanks m8
---
Nice meme
---
Shared world pvp. Boy oh Boy this gonna be fun
---
Check out tribute. Lots of very salty nerds fighting there to dunk on and fights to 3rd party. They are using caps too, easy dread bomb materials. Pretty easy to bait out supers
---
Cool, hope you don't come back. Eve doesn't need risk averse chickens like you.
---
I started a little while ago. This game is vast and complex. The community can be salty af or really friendly and helpful. Community makes the game, so i recommend finding some people you enjoy playing with. It took me about a week to begin understanding the mechanics and seeing the game's potential and throughout that week I kind of hated it, although I'm still on the fence whether I want to actually keep playing.
---
where have I said this game is too hard
---
to distinguish myself : I lost quite a few explorer ships trying to get the loot of those rattlesnakes. I lost I don't know how many asteros "oh wait I'm not cloaked oh no" to sleepers
---
If you can form 100 titans you can get a few extra recons. Literally just put one or two in your SMB.
---
But the Widow is the perfect Cyno ship, just in case someone fails to primary you, you can help them out and ecm them.
---
Wormholes and 100% safety is bullshit.
---
yulai whack a bot will be suspect
---
Any guesses on how many of these guys have been subbed in the last 6 months?
---
what’s aether wars? is this a new form of faction war??
---
Lol, that is easy to say when you're just a peasant and don't have as much to risk yourself :) Come back and talk to me when you have some isk and big ships to your name :)
---
Thing is is a frigate with Battleship weapons. That is a full bling bomber can be raped for a freaking venture with T1 weapons.
---
The only change i can take, since cyno change incoming, is take out the covert cyno fit. So the coverops frigate has more weight and use.
---
I actually love your idea that a system instead of becoming more profitable the more you remove the risks it becomes the other way around. 
---
if i were an npc pirate i would not keep going to certain dead needlessly.
---
I'm confused with timezones, are CCP bros already roaming or in a few hours? Yulai is at 17 so in 6 hours
---
Thisis like an old school after-school special:
---
Along the way, we found out the content we really wanted was inside us the whole tuime.

\*soft guitar solo in D minor starts.

\*soft lens fade out\*

This is like an old school after-school special:
---
Was enjoying NRDS Providence. Had just flown 24 jump round trip to buy a Primae for half price. Entered the system I wanted to set up my PI in. Warped to the TCU in an empty system to be safe while I worked out which planet I was going to set up first.
---
[Come back from PI screen to realise POS on TCU dont necessarily follow NRDS rules.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/53184027/)
---
I don't know who these risk averse roamers are, but I can tell you that when we roam we are almost always outnumbered.  We've taken fights with response fleets 2-3 times our size, with capitals, supers etc, and still tried to stay on grid unless we were 100% getting smoked.  You're always going to have people looking for easy kills in this game, but you shouldn't be surprised when  a roaming gang decided to leave after FAX or stupid shit like that gets dropped.
---
wow @ amount of meme votes there
---
you dont use bombers much do you
---
Great to hear that you've had a good experience with FW! One last thing to add (particularly related to your previous comment about FW meta). It's true that there is a lowsec meta, it's a lot more defined than the nullsec meta, for example, but it's also very flexible (probably more than nullsec's). You could, for example, get a friend and fly 2 off-meta ships and fight 2 on-meta ships and still win depending on piloting skills and the inherently rock-paper-scissor nature of some engagements.
---
To contrast it with the nullsec meta, there's only really 1 kind of ship you can fly in nullsec and that's kiting nanogang, ships optimized for speed and range. You're most often going to be fighting outnumbered, so you want to pick off single members out of the opposing fleet and you need to protect yourself against opposing tackle (Jaguars are very much the ship of choice right now), that's probably going to be faster than you. 
---
In lowsec (especially FW), you have a better chance of fighting "equal" engagements, or at the very least engagements that allow you to fly different kinds of fits (for example, the Tristan can be fit as a brawler, scram kiter or kiter and fly well in any role in FW.)
---
Well you can do FW lvl4s and get 1b/hr so ur tick are little lmao :D
---
I’m not being rude. This is a discussion I’ll engage with if you can act mature. 
---
Geddon is 175k tank with 2 plates, 2 enams, explo exam, dang cont and reactive hard.
---
Same fit redeemer is 125k
---
Redeemer gets no bonus to neuts or drones
---
Redeemer is a couple of bil more expensive. For a couple of bil I’d feel more comfy cloaked. 
---
I think that’s a fair trade off
---
Why not go all in, and bring back skill point loss if you forget to upgrade your clone, and get poded.
---
the whole point of t3's not getting cynos was because they were too tanky..
---
This one https://zkillboard.com/kill/18161707/
---
Don't think that I need to explain more... I was so clueless back then
---
ofc
---
That’s your choice then. Either build a keepstar or join a group who has them. If you don’t want to then enjoy the space coffin
---
what do you not understand in SUSPECT, suspects cant be shot by anyone in highsec
---
Correct and the fact it's boring is what prevents it.
---
First concord, then wrecking shots... dude the way you lost your AT ships are amazing.
---
There is no way google was able to translate this to make so much sense, someone generated this with google translate
---
LMAO
---
Don’t like forward stages keepstars? Then put up a fight about it Whitney bitch
---
We used to run 1mn merlin gangs with scalpel logi. The sig on the ship is so small we could tank caracal gangs, good times
---
There's alpha and omega accounts. Alpha is like a trial that never runs out, you can try almost everything in the game but lots of skills that you need to dive deeper into things are locked. Omega is basically like a premium account, everything is open to you and your skills train faster. You can go from alpha to omega either with ingame currency (by buying 500 PLEX off the market and activating it) or by subscription with real money.
---
All the PLEX on the market is sold by real players, who buy it from CCP for real money. This way you can "buy" in game currency. 
---
My advice is to play on alpha for a while, try out as much as you can and when you start feeling restricted you can think about upgrading to omega. If you can pay for it out of game do that, because having to grind the ~2 billion isk for 500 PLEX each month is a real drag especially for new players. Later on it's more manageable. 
---
Also don't start out with mining, do some [exploring in wormholes instead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cmv2yo/thinking_about_trying_this_game_again_have_a_few/ew4zcn9/) It's more fun, more dangerous and WAY more lucrative for new players than mining is. 
---
Good luck.
---
It probably can, carriers are pure garbage atm
---
as much bullshit as 100% safety is in nullsec
---
Those changes all happened over 2 years ago. See the list above for all the relevant changes. Nullsec income has been nerfed repeatedly over the past 2 years and to claim it has received nothing but buffs is what makes it bullshit.
---
 ["official" video of the fight from Trigg/Toxic (dead) logi pov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxBxuJ6KwZ0&amp;t) 
---
i wasn't interested in editing videos, so the original raw footage was just dropped in alliance for them to watch and edit if they wanted, that's why i took it down.
---
I know someone snatched it already and reuploaded it, but i ended up staying awake till 6-am trying out softwares, and figuring out how this shit works, so here ya go.
---
We did have a  good time, eventhough a potential 4-way turned out to be 3v1, with BB/Thera having to warp off grid when the fight was over, because some npsi guys were trying to finish the azbel. (overheat next time!)
---
Thanks for the pew to everyone who showed up, and a special thank you from all of us at Trigg/Toxic to  Cici Awas, who yoloed his dread  to finish the 1% hull of the Azbel with  45 sec left on the timer, that was glorious.
---
Good lawd
---
Make sure you get a buddy code! Gives you about 3/4 weeks of training time
---
but, that's a buff..
---
What part of bombing excavators and ganking carriers that can't fight back is meaningful pvp?
---
CCP now only releases ships that can separate themselves from ships that are already released. A ship that would work theme-wise is a SOE FAX, but what would you do to differentiate it from a regular FAX? Until they find a good niche and mechanic to make it different, they won't release it.
---
Asking nicely, to dock up the mining ship and bring an equal number to fight, usually turns out in no content at all ... i mean maybe there are those 2-3 corps out there, who do exactly that, but nullsec groups usually go the way "dock up and wait it out", "drop supers immediately" or "bring the equal amount of ship times four" ... that doesn't really sound like win-win.
---
Aren't they the reason Sansha National is so powerful? I know Sansha found a piece of ancient technology that gave them an edge on rebuilding their nightmarish empire with improved ships and the capacity to launch incursions in HS.
---
Was it Yan Jung technology?
---
Yes plz I want this
---
#TeamCotty- Shanna
---
He's talking about Signal Cartel, in case people didn't get which corp he is referencing.
---
What is assault frigate gangs
---
Knowing about staging systems and possible groups that drop capitals is not just achieved by having/training two frig alts. And you would have to know about possible cyno alts of said groups. Things like this is what causes people to either straight up join a big null sec group to leach of the highly organized effort they put in, stay in HS or simply quit the game. 
---
It kills variety. Right now low sec is just null sec with security loss, same risks as in null and way less rewards. Imagine HS corps trying to move into low sec, they will get obliterated in no time. 
---
Imagine having low sec without any capitals at all, a place where new corps would have a higher chance to build up untill they feel confident enough to try to take a system in null for them. The N+1 will make it hard enough for them.
---
As I said this shit should have no place in low, people who want to drop their caps on stuff should go an live in null (and then complain about not getting any targets afterwards).
---
I'm curious, if you wanna quit playing why not simply quit playing?
---
Why do you need to tell random internet strangers about how you don't want to play the game anymore?
---
Do you think we care?
---
It's still mostly safe, just needs a little more work. Anchor a large bubble on it, set a cloaky scout, and you have all the time in the world to dock up anything that's ratting or mining.
---
Interesting how you refer to all of nullsec as just goons.
---
I propose that undocking has a 15% chance of spawning a fleet of triglavian ships which try kill everything on grid, but get counter dropped by drifters who try do the same. Introduce real risk. You an elite pvper with kitey BS frigate? ur dead. turbokrab with 15 rorqs? some of them are dead. You an alliance with a large fleet that wants to do something? 15% chance you all need a new ship.
---
best change ever tbh.
---
If carriers had a buff for basically carrying clone bays and increase in ships it can carry, that would be a mobile fleet and conflict driver.
---
Hang on are people saying jump drives are a problem now?
---
Because of the same reason the hardcore "elite pvpers" need to create equally stupid posts telling random internet strangers about removing asset safety, getting skill point loss when flying titans/supers etc. We need some counterweight to all that lunacy. Which was my hope to provide.
---
Change the sphere that ships land on to be big enough so supers don't bump.
---
Then you can cyno off-grid properly.
---
People making suggestions about making the cyno tanky enough to keep the status quo are missing the entire point.
---
When you see the huge drop since the begining (20% fall) you can not be so positive for the futur. When a dying game lost 20% , it s a big deal.
---
The activity IG has dropped. You see A LOT less people in space.
---
Myself i have not ressubed 25 account (well 20 was skillfarm). I had a lot more target 2 month ago than now. I dont pay to play in empty space.
---
I was it. Not quite sure why I do though. It's always been junk
---
salty nullbear detected
---
Providing unlimited ability for any group to blob another without any limit whatsoever...yep that’s a great idea.
---
I lost an explo ship due to a gas belt. Warped to 0 and the forgot to move and cloak. Heard the alarms and knew it was too late.
---
thicc tank arazu is 100k ehp, use it
---
thats how you fix that
---
Lol, regular carriers o not have too much ehp, they suck ass both in hp and application.
---
If you're organized you should have little trouble getting people in before the cyno dies.
---
i respect that, but if your going to own somthing, would you skimp out on the tank of such a thing for the sake of 1 or 2 billion isk, when the total cost is in the region of 75-100bill.
---
doesnt make sence to me.
---
Medium has to be per moon because they replace moon mining pos, unless you are going to make exceptions for athanors.
---
this is one way, other one would be to just remove citadels or limit the number per system and limit the number of supers able to be docked.
---
I agree. My Aeon was fairly expensive fit before I yolo'd it
---
That's fine, there just needs to be less reward for playing that way than for playing in a higher risk way. It's not about forcing people to do X or Y, its about risk being properly rewarded.
---
What if the new owners told CCP to do all this in the first place?
---
If they really wanna go through with cyno changes I think it should be fit in marauders, and heavy assault cruisers, also add the monitor in their as well, this would make especially marauders more needed and used and they have survivability to hold that cyno.
---
even then a super completly fit full bling (officer mods aside) is half the cost of just the hull of a titan, and this chap used b types?
---
I know you're probably salty about null changes but any wormholer who's actually in wormholes to pvp wouldn't mind this at all.
---
This only hurts the people who have farm holes with no intention of pvp.
---
Turn null space into WH-space! It's the only way to save EVE!! /s
---
Only 11 accounts here, but between my friends probably up to around your number. They are all playing No Man's Sky now. Which makes me sad.
---
People claim this, but I’ve seen some concrete evidence that they’re much more complicated and that is not a safe method for handling a new hole. I mean, if you’re ratting keep doing it. Maybe we will find you one day.
---
Wanna nit pick more? My CEO accidentally dropped a haw titan on Bombs Titan the night we AWOX'd him lmfao
---
backup HAW 'just incase' ''went as planned''
---
That honestly just increases krab potential and limits pvp.
---
You didn't answer the question at all, why do you think we care even a little bit that you quit the game?
---
Everytime I try to go in lowsec i come across a gate camping...
---
His HAW titan was doing more damage than my devoter for sure lmfao
---
Trying to pvp in my 1b 10/10 ishtar.
---
everyone knows a devotors dps is the dreads behind it :D.
---
theres guys in eve me and my group would love to achieve this on, well played
---
so having a couple hundred nerds from all over the world collect in one spot and light a flare for hours in your honor is sad and pathetic?    
---
looks like you are not getting it
---
So, a good time for a camping trip?
---
Why everyone thinks that i'm salty null bear? :(
---
I just want to make WHs a bit more spicy.
---
\*PvP wormholer btw.
---
I second this advice; mining and grinding rats (npcs) for isk is mind-numbingly boring.  They guys doing this tend to be fodder for everyone else.  There are much easier and more lucrative ways to obtian isk, but isk doesn't equate to a good gaming experience, it's just a means by which you can do some more interesting things.  
---
Most of the depth of the game is experienced via interacting with people, but choose your friends wisely.
---
Thicc'er falcon is 130k ehp before overheat. Use it instead
---
Lol!!  Sounds great.  The price difference is actually nice if you are just starting out and don’t have a lot of cash.  
---
By watching the tempo of how quick they do the hacks you can get a pretty good idea of when to time your warp in.  Warp and then approach (+/- prop mod depending how far you are away) as you are hitting all your buttons.  If you do it right your bump will land just before you have tackle set.  Make sure you get at least a couple points of tackle for those who use stabs.  
---
Nothing more entertaining than practicing a second language while gaming. :-)
---
Don’t be afraid to take the Astero vs Astero or the Strat vs Strat, fight depending on the other person’s killboard.  You will see people who just feed badly fit explorer Astero/Strats.   Just look at the last few losses on zkill while you are waiting to pounce.  
---
When in doubt give it a go...what’s the worst case, you die and learn.
---
That is of course always a possibility, but I think this is more like "let's do everything we wanted and talked about doing before the lights go off" sort of thing. Or they simply want to introduce more microtransactions.
---
Lol res run, just /follow someone else! they’ll get you to the boss
---
I signed for the test, but FFS I'm out of town and cannot partecipate...
---
I think this post should be more about POS's. a pos it was allows a smaller group to have a super/titan. i know this, we did it, right on the edge of snuff jumprange in lowsec,
---
yes we would make effort to not drop our t1 caracals onto snuff dudes, and they seemed to leave us alone (it was pretty ovious we were dropping subcaps)but with a pos or two, you can do this just fine. removing POS is silly. maybe all the POS structures, but not the POS's themselves.
---
Whats the point in a keepstar if you cant dock anything in it thats special? ownership of keepstars should be limited? per region?  i dunno. but not removed from the game
---
Clearly a post from someone who has never devoted hours to hunting for a few seconds of glory only to have it ruined by panic and 20 supers
---
about 2-3 weeks in classic you crying there to, cause it's too hard, even it's a non-loosing-stuff-game if you fuck up daily!
---
Couldn’t practically work, for higher class holes at least, because of how wormhole regions are structured
---
The "i am in a pve boat so i can't fight back" meme is making you look like an incompetent coward.  
---
Which null-group that has people ratting in carriers doesn't have a supercap umbrella these days? You legit just have to light a cyno, that is all you have to do lmao.  
---
Also good job on missing out on switching to mining drones for the duration of blackout like everyone else.  
---
But i guess it is easier to cry reddit than to actually improve yourself at the game.
---
And you seem to misunderstand what meaningful means: deleting ~1bil a pop is one of the few good ways left for small groups to inflict somewhat impactful damage to big bloc level alliances.  
---
Claiming that excavs die too quickly is silly considering how good the rewards are vs. the risk of fielding them.
---
You're right. Which is why they need to fix the resource and war mechanics instead of shitting on top tier (read: anyone with cap skills) null players.
---
Go back to the interview with Hilmar &amp; Co. in TIS, Listen to Falcons rant on nullbears. It was filled with salt and hate for that specific group of players. 
---
Well, change the resource mechanics of the game and 20 rorqs will no longer pile on the same anom that spawn every 24 hrs... Just the way Hilmar suggested. Don't completely fuck over caps that people have spent a lot of time and/or money on. It's just a massive betrayal for the customers. Either completely revamp them or don't touch them at all, we are unfortunately at that stage now.
---
Ah yes, another opinion of someone who can't fly them
---
Well it only takes one dude to come through a crit hole or come out of afk and scan new sig and if its out of dscan range... well you know what happens.
---
when the palentine gets build. im sure thats a red flag for CCP for some no doubt planned hits to the game....
---
It's Eve timeonez which is Icelandic. Yeah it's a terrible time as most of the US will be at work, myself included.
---
Outside I'm laughing, but inside I'm crying ;_;
---
I'd suggest you run an armor rep Vexor Navy. It'll be cheaper than a Strat, can still run level 5/10s and 6/10s, and it's gotten even better with the recent VNI changes. Once you can do that without kicking the bucket, then move onto the really shiny toys.
---
Downloaded and will listen at work tomorrow
---
I'm actually struggling between Sanctuary and One Eden.
---
my plan is 3          
---
2 with native tank to the ship (aka armor -&gt; armor recon) and one opposite
---
Definitely Wow moments.
---
I've had some moments that are burned so much into my mind because I felt my heart was about to stop.
---
The story I love the most (though it may be hard for you to understand so I'll try to get enough background) is when I was running with a new Black Ops crew.
---
My friend knew I was getting into Fleet Commanding Black Ops hunts, using my own Black Ops Battleships to bridge the fleet around as well as do combat in. Black Ops battleships are equipped with Jump Drives that allow them to jump to beacons other players in the fleet create in start systems light years away. They can also make bridges that allow Covert ships that are smaller to jump as well.
---
Anyway, I would normally hunt in Providence, because it was a bit easier for a small time crew like I was running (when it was mostly just me controlling 2-3 characters).
---
My friend would hunt up near the Caldari-Gallente Faction Warfare zone in Nullsec with his corporation, but they were open to friends joining the fleets, so I was able to take my Blops to join. As the new guy, I had my Redeemer (Amarr Black Ops) as a bridge ship and was using my Widow (Caldari Black Ops) as a DPS and ECM.
---
We dropped our fleet consinsting of about 10 Black Ops and a few covert Tech 3 Cruisers are some target, I don't really remember. We set up to jump back as a response fleet showed up much larger than ours, but we were cloaked up safe.
---
Unfortunately, to be able to send the T3s back safely, I would have to decloak my Redeemer and let it sit there while everyone jumped back. We jumped all the black ops back and I bridged most of the fleet back.
---
One guy was straggling and got to me too late, so I relit the bridge for him to go, which most would say is a dumb idea when there is a hostile fleet in system. The bridge locks my ship in place for 60 seconds. Right as I relit the bridge, Combat Probes appeared nearby. Combat probes are used to find people in space that aren't at normal warpable locations.
---
Just as the bridge was going down, an enemy Falcon (Caldari Recon ship) decloaked and tackled my Redeemer before I could jump out. Cue butthole shutting. Being Tackled means that I was unable to warp away, micro jump away, or full on jump away. I was stuck. The Falcon can also jam ships, so I was unable to lock onto him and shoot back.
---
We had a Loki (Minmattar Tech 3 Cruiser) that could help me, and he asked if he should relight his cyno (the beacon I mentioned before that allows the Black Ops to jump to it). I said "yes". And didn't really wait for the FC to agree.
---
He lit the cyno nearby, and I took a breath and jumped my Widow back into the fray, knowing that it was just seconds before the fleet would probably be showing up (Honestly not sure how they weren't already there).
---
Nobody else ended up jumping in.
---
My Widow jumped in and I quickly locked up and jammed the Falcon. This freed my Redeemer from the tackle, and both of my Blops micro jumped away as the fleet was landing, to cloak up.
---
The Loki was still there, the hero. Somehow, he managed to get out, too, which I do not understand how that was possible, but the other fleet must have been really incompetent.
---
Anyway, back at the staging system, they gave me a new cyno and I got both my blops back safely.
---
They were good ships.
---
While I didn't record that, I have recorded some stuff, so here's a video of my using my Widow for some other fun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTf-tklFpw
---
you can take a falcon for over 400k ehp for about 1 bil (This is before shield slaves/phenoms/enchanted mods)
---
How much damage you need to destroy an MTU? I would like to hunt them (I want some revenge because i've lost about ten of them in the past weeks)
---
I'll definitely be sleeping in AUTZ.. Maybe I'll put an alarm in the middle of the night hmm...
---
The problem with BCs is that your sig is larger than a cruiser, and you're a lot slower. Those two things together will cause a shitton of damage to land on you.
---
Yea and those days the dev buffed "hunting pvp"
---
Basically a big part of the game is trying to do pve (money) without been killed by pvp players.
---
I have some same feelings about this game that I had while I played rust. It's a risk vs reward game.
---
The point of a monitor is to be able to anchor a fleet without fear of being headshot.  Lighting a cyno and standing still kinda defeats that purpose
---
I'm gonna go for this one  
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77197273/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77197273/)
---
Yes and no.       
---
Like you need both armor and shield cyno ships.          
---
It is actually hard to rep falcon with your armor based fleet, pilgrim on the other hand ....             
---
Cyno don't disallow reviving remote reps ^^YET!             
---
Just imagine yourself falcon cyno sitting in the middle of tackled smartbombing capitals and those apostles trying to keep him alive.
---
Join us in wormhole space! Start killing people! Star making isk!
---
Where did I say they die to quickly? Also if your pvp group is getting dropped by supers how is that meaningful pvp?
---
The point is after the blackout change the biggest thing that happened was mass bombing of excavators. That's nearly pve because the player controlling them had no counter play. Once the cyno changes go in ratting carriers will have no counter play to bomber fleets and either stop undocking or due in droves.
---
I guess what you need to define is meaningful pvp because in the two most common scenarios, one side of the fight has 0 chance. Either the carrier brings in supers to stop you or the carrier can't respond.
---
You obviously have no clue about investing. I will bid you good day.
---
It on says t3c though.
---
6 6/10s, 2 5/10s...that probably took a lot of time in a solo strat. And a hell of a good luck (there was a good drop and you wasn't chased off by locals). Impressive
---
No, what is happening here is absolutely nothing. Not only does their server not work, but neither does their back end infrastructure. For instance, not everyone even got their codes. That is signs of a company just flailing about. Keep sucking their cock though, seems that is all you are good for.
---
Were you not invited to the party?
---
There is only one time zone, EVE time zone.
---
What 400m on lvl 5s? More like 1.5b
---
The back end failed, the client failed, the email notification system failed. These guys should go back to McDonald's and stop wasting people's money.
---
I should write a Reddit bot that links the most recent zkills for rorquals in umbrella null space with the breakdown chart of how many spod-hours it takes to replace them triggered on “impossible to kill.”
---
Absolutely.  
---
I am not unhappy actually about changing asset safety, only talking a bit about what I guess will probably happen if it actually goes away.  
---
Right now the only thing that is saving a lot of groups staging structures are that it’s an absolute awful task to blow them up.   Change either the work requirements to blow them up, or the chance of loot, and you better actually have a NPC station handy.  
---
We glassed the north mostly because we had nothing else to do I expect, but also for politics.  Even given the oppressive TZ tanking, and little chance for a fight, and no loot, we still could get 1000 of nerds ready to fight those structures for months at a time.  
---
I expect most active players, even those in pretty good sized groups, will just move everything of value into NPC stations the moment the wind turns.  Only people who will get caught for anything other than little things will be AFK players and those not available to evac,  
---
I actually have no problem with that, but it may be worth thinking about how it may impact the chances of that person wanting to re-engage after.
---
i Thought the bastion module gives you an agression timer....

I grew up with classic, so I pretty much know what to expect :)
---
Too stronk
---
Holy fuck. Could you imagine rolling holes. How much mass is left there Johnny? I don't fucking know mark... Aww shit I'm rolled out now.
---
I don't say it is good thing.                    
---
Skill points is what you buy from CCP.        
---
Either way they are generated **only by RL currency**           
---
While T3C sp lose is from before the extractor era - expanding this mechanic that is directly linked to your wallet is just the baaaaad.         
---
Aka you buy something from CCP, but if it is destroyed .... you can buy it again.... and recover your capabilities slowly ... or instantly by paying bit more.                        
---
Do we really want to go into this rabbit hole.
---
Lmfao you realise how dumb you sound?
---
Why do you want to use bastion?
---
Porpoise sucks at mining. Its designed to be a mini orca, boosting a mining fleet. Not mining on its own
---
It is sad and pathetic, I absolutely get it
---
Well I'll throw my dick in the ring, 2.2b per hour running citadels with single Nag C6.
---
Of course you care, you're proving that by the minute lol. Why do you care enough to post about it?
---
to tank the invasion dudes? no, is that not what you meant when you said marauder?
---
learn 2 push keyboard scrub
---
Most hunters are looking for good fights, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Killing VNIs/domis is boring.
---
nothing to see here just era of chaos bud
---
Well you're literally correct on the "nothing to see here" part.
---
Not if your heart rate doesn't go up.
---
they have 10k shield 10k armor and 30k hull with no resistance.
---
Yes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HHpR9khVKw
---
&gt; They are meaningless as they don’t do anything great, significant, or important for the game other than make it bad to play for all involved.
---
You are being willfully ignorant now. If the changes are meaningless, then they don’t deserve the level of whining and mental gymnastics you are giving them.
---
Sure i can swing dick 4b if i use 3 pullers
---
You don't need bastion to do it.
---
Your heart rate doesn't actually need to go up for something that isn't exercising your cardiovascular system or burning fat.
---
Stretching for example.
---
yeah not gonna bother finding a way out of the chain just so i can maybe shoot at someone when i can just sit in the chain and definitely shoot at someone.
---
linux does still work, but can confirm, neither the windows launcher nor the download seem to be working right now.
---
Don't use gates that are right off the main trade routes? Get 5-6 jumps away from Jita or Amarr or wherever, *not* along the route to another hub, and look for lowsec entrances there.
---
naw. too much work. I prefer to sit on the jita undock and try and nic stuff from the people actually doing the work for the ganks.
---
Sounds like a good reason to not bother WITH THAT SITE. Not with ded sites in general.
---
Have the same problem :(
---
Who would train titan 5 again? Lol...........
---
mmh ok, you still gonna run into the problem off the loot being so easy to steal though.
---
Well unlike darkness some alliances can actually defend theirs
---
If you have to use probes to scan it down, it counts as "exploration" whether you use data miners, gas harvesters, or damage-dealing to harvest the contents.
---
&gt;  So really no space for relic and data scraps
---
Relic loot takes up practically no space at all, mostly.
---
Well the 7/10 is in fact your best choice. Straight forward going through 5 pockets. The 8/10 and 10/10 is station grinding and the (9/10) ... fleet staging point with hoping you land somewhere near where you started, is ... well station grinding as well :D
---
I should probably go to lowsec :D 5/10 was basically the best time/ISK-ratio hehe
---
Until you take insurance into account, whereas the expensive subcaps get little to no insurance.
---
babies first titan, eh?
---
If I were in Darkness. do you think I’d actually advertise that fact publicly?
---
I mean, I think that’s a fair balance.
---
Why shouldn’t a potential 300b drop not be one of the riskiest things in game?
---
No need to be buttmad bc someone has outgamed you guys several times on these.
---
I'm just saying you guys don't need a buff.. lol
---
I was unable to so much as see any other players. I assume my connection and hardware were just too old and crap to keep up.
---
Default strat best strat
---
Brings me back to my original point: don't go to null.
---
Thanks for coming back 2 days later to make sure no one else in this thread is here to tell you how full of shit you are.
---
&gt; Not enganging things in low if your scout sees capitals undocking in a staging is NOT a counter.
---
That is literally a counter though. A very safe one as well. Its a queue that only means trouble. The logic is really simple here too. If caps stage, you will get blapped if you are in an inferior fleet.
---
Seriously, if you are warping around in a fleet that requires a  4 bil logi, you need to have lots of intel to find interesting fights. 
---
If you dont have a plan for the worst case scenario (read, OP), this will happen. I dont really get why people go mad over losing is because of their own faults. It sucks, sure, but move on and improve.
---
&gt; Nein 
---
You are way the fuck off the beaten track. Closest place where you might have some luck is Hek, at the Boundless Creation Factory station.
---
Don't forget you can jettison a can to use for temp swap space.
---
Of course you are aware that people drop caps on small gangs in the home space - to send a clear signal.     
---
**If you come here this is what you get.**                
---
People don't like when you try to mess up with area that suppose to be safe for member income reasons.            
---
Years ago, before ingame mechanics forced people into such big groups, and this gave them ability to defend some space so well, it was opposite, but same dogma across New Eden : **don't give fights at home**                  
---
Goal of this was same.        
---
If you don't offer fights at home - people will less likely visit you during roaming.
---
As others have said, the largest conflict at the moment is Legacy and FIRE Coalition verses Winter Coalition.  The primary alliance in Legacy is TEST alliance who are mostly US and EU timezone players and Reddit users.  Their allies in FIRE are primarily Russian-based alliances.  The core of Winter Coalition is Fraternity alliance who has a large Chinese-speaking base, but a growing US / EU timezone English speaking group.
---
your mother dropped you
---
Hmm, OP clearly doesn't understand that dropping caps was specifically to keep them from coming to our space. No one is complaining that you idiots are not in our space, as that was the whole point. If we wanted to be farmed constantly we would have joined Horde. Instead, we farm others away from our protected space, and get all of the "content" we desire.
---
i mean, xploration is the finding of these sites anyway, if were all going down this route.
---
whatever, i saw bpc's and questioned it, ive already admitted to not reading title fully
---
ok fair enough
---
You could be a masochists
---
Now you're making too much sense
---
“Helldunk or blue balls.”
---
The single most cancerous mentality in Eve.
---
It's not about "risking to lose", it's about knowing that you will 100% lose because they'll drop supers and titans on your 4man cruiser gang. Most hunters will take a "fair" fight even if it means they might lose.
---
Hahaha, that was my fleet. We almost got Hy Wanto as well. Tons of fun in Tama that night.
---
I suppose you got that mythic Azshara kill to prove the game is a joke?
---
Lol, first of all, you think Reddit and flair means anything.
---
Second, I've been thoroughly enjoying esp Blackout. It's just that I care about consistency.
---
no, i reddit at work, and dont work weekends. :D
---
ask NC. if sub caps can reach edge of grid only a few 100km's from a gate. they all crossed one the other day, whilst fighting bjornbee's NPSI infact which is on stream.
---
&gt; I wanted to join the Amarr navy, but is that even possible?
---
You can join the Amarr militia if Faction Warefare. Either the NPC corp (24th Imperial Crusade, I think) or a player corp that's in the militia.
---
Is Dirt'n'Glitter still a thing?
---
The learning experience part is very important. Real game experience (not grinding related xp points) is what matters in this game. When you get blapped and lose your ship, consider what you could have done differently to survive. Was it your ship build or should you have crashed the gate sooner. Did you have an escape plan and did it work. For example, I do a lot of nullsec exploration. When on the sites I am most vulnerable to NPC and player aggression. I’ve lost three ships trying different strategies but now I think I have the right strategy! I hope!
---
I was unsubbed during this event last year, how does the Yulai transport of botters work and how to kill them?  Where in the system will they appear or is it just random?
---
So the scheduled events are at 1500 and 1700. So an EUTZ thing only yet again.
---
It's not hard, it's inconvenient
---
I downvoted this post because you mentioned being downvoted, you hypergoob.
---
&lt;3
---
thats what happens... To many Spod, Goons also losse alot of stuff.  
---
They just dont care about.
---
Did you ignore the part about complaining they don't come back on purpose?
---
Think about it from a different site... if you know someone is attacking your MTU and you might have some backround information about his previous kills and maybe even losses, you can kinda prepare in something that he thinks is an easy kill but is just a very good bait. So you are the one that gets a free kill after that. :)
---
Prob a bit late to throw in my 2 cents
---
Next time you fit up a t3c, buy subsystems. Then go to the assets window bc you can see who you bought them from in that window. Try pming them and asking if they want to buy bpcs. Chances are they would say no, but it is possible they would take it.
---
eve uni get thier own share of content by the way. unless theyve changed ALOT in the last 6 months.
---
Pandemic horde are often said a good choice,
---
Horde,
---
Eve Uni
---
Brave newbies - are still going, but i went the other day and they just stayed tethered, very unlike the good ol'brave used to be.
---
i would give my 2 cents, dont join goons or karma fleet. they are 'imperium' and therefore forever the enemy. :D
---
you can always move after
---
If you shoot occupied ones sometimes you can get them to engage you which makes it alot of fun.

And your fleet can consist entirely of you.
---
It is a safety measure of sorts to be in a fleet by yourself. It prevents you from accidentally succumbing to malicious fleet invites by gankers.
---
You have a point, but when is it ever a fair fight in EVE? These guys come to dunk on people who can't fight back. Miners, haulers, newbies in Myrmidons, etc. Then they cry about capitals that come to protect our members.
---
right
---
you will find 'blue fire / Awoxing / friendly fire insidents in all large groups.
---
it wont be the end of the world. theyll all tell you dont fly what you cant deal with loosing. 
---
and it doesnt happen all the time, moreoften to the expensive ships anyway. 
---
the places it will not happen or be very unlikely will not be able to help your growth as much.
---
Weren't you complaining about people not fighting you literally yesterday? :thinking:
---
nothing stopping you from being a defenceless procurer, with a cyno falcon cloaked next to you
---
Mate I've run 2 pullers out of aeschee, with a dedicated carrier plus toon in each of the 3 systems, running two sites almost at a time, 4b with 3 pullers is not possible, upload vid on YouTube otherwise I think your telling porkies, 1.5b per hour with 2 pullers 3 carriers, also takes time to select / sell items from lp.
---
Was it ever working?
---
I had one spawn in be like that. Just nothing around...moving through empty space.
---
Most weren't though.
---
I don't know if I hadn't connected properly, or just the spawn area was so large (in anticipation of so many players) that occasionally you might spawn far away from anyone.
---
Wormholer '' i live in a space that needs no balancing, changes, or attention, infact its great your!''

What was the complaint? "Wish my titan had more killmarks from bosoning in delve"?
---
When I gank those 4 mining procs with my 10 kikis its a display of great skill and mental fortitude. When you boson us all before we get to kill those procs it's just you ruining the game.
---
Nah, you've clearly never "done it." If you ever had, you'd know that carrier ratting is probably the most carpal tunnel inducing cancer in the entire game.
---
What I’m referencing is how that system does not work like you explained. We have found a wormhole without a sig before. We found it because we had a drifter go entirely MIA, on Dscan, not on celestial or holes in probe window. 
---
We combatted it and found it sitting on a wormhole with no sig.
---
always, fight grr goons, or farm to buy a ship to fight grr goons in
---
and director roles
---
These people also seem to think that carriers and supers are anywhere near each other in dps/tank/isk printing ability.
---
I'd like to do that but honnestly I would die in 15 minutes trying to survice to local players with a PvE fit …
---
Nah, he complained people wouldn't engage his command ship in delve that totally has neither a cyno fit nor on standby
---
ded don't escalate.
---
theres no wrong choice (except goons or karmafleet :D)
---
but seriously. there no wrong choice, you can always change,
---
youll make friends anywhere
---
theyll all try to help you a little as if you grow up under thier wing your more likely to stay loyal to them.
---
Who in groups with established super umbrellas and several hostile regions to farm scrubs in is complaining about not having people bothering them at home while iskmaking.
---
Real pirates drink Grog. Ask the biggest pirate of the world: Guybrush Threepwood
---
Yep it was working fine till last week or so.
---
Typical
---
Imagine thinking mining creates inflation.
---
Eutz here. One of those is office hours. And even 5pm ain't great, I might just about make it home for that.
---
CCP brought a bit of WH to nullsec, so I think CCP should give them a little of nullsec.
---
Enable Cynos in Wormholes.
---
Please tell me how mining a rock creates isk out of thin air.
---
I've been hunting this little guys, the salvage is quite good, and they do offer a challenge, albeit It's not really something worth ISK wise unless you want to try something new... Can teach you good lessons about D-Scan and combat probs.
---
An orca mining should be perfectly capable of killing them, save you do not go AFK... I heard about people either losing orcas or losing their augmented mining drones for this guy, stay sharp and have fun! xD
---
All in all, ai welcome this new system... It something done to fight AFK gameplay, and I honestly think we just have to gain from this on the long run.
---
People who do it don't complain if this is their goal.
---
Never heard of this. This is some dark magic.
---
Fair, except from some goons ive not seen people complaining about that a lot.
---
TIL cheating = abusing.
---
**Don't dropping caps on anything possible for a guaranteed win is the dumbest**
---
If there is an abusable mechanics in a game, it's not players fault to use it for maximum outcome
---
No then I’d live in a wormhole.
---
Captial ships demonstarte power and unity. We reship into larger ships for larger engagements.
---
if youve got green safety (its green if you dont even know what this is) you actually cannot shoot somone in hisec, or do anything thatll get you killed. try it, get in unfit ship, shoot random, itll ping at you and say saftey system will not allow it.
---
if you shoot at him after he shot your MTU, itll let you. ensure you can actually kill it, a thrasher is a pretty good t1 destroyer
---
It is fine to kill a T1 cruiser in 3 T3C with support, but loosing one of the T3C to a super is blobing.
---
Nobody complains that people don't come back to harass them, that's why they drop caps on them to start with. We don't want these people back and roaming around.
---
Multiboxing subcap ratters is far more isk than carrier/super ratting. If someone can multibox a carrier/super, they're probably cheating.
---
Join the New Order and help reshape HISec to the vision if it's saviour, James 315. I was a mere number in a nullsec bloc, a warm body for their senseless lust for senseless greed, their visionless bloodlust, their uncultured megalomania. 
---
But then I heard about CODE, and I realized the justice. I kneeled and prayed to James, to his Agents of CODE. And my prayers got answered. I was given a ship, and a name. A target, a sinner to the glorious New code of Halaima, a blemish on the flawless vision of James.  I knew my purpose, to take down this preposterous heretic, and to be reborn by the cleansing fire of Concord. 
---
My reincarnation was successfull, and I was given a family, a place, a meaning. I will not rest, till the cleansing wave has purified HISec, till everyone supports the new Order.
---
Praise James.
---
Praise CODE.
---
Praise the New Order.
---
It's actually not that bad, just a little frustrating when you are 20mins in and someone tries to come kill you. Just keep scanning and you should be fine. Drop a can on the warp in to de-cloak people who might try to catch you that way. Just keep vigilant and you will be fine.
---
Ah yes, the good ole, don't play the game right now counterplay, that'll beat your enemy!
---
Ever notice how all the kids who want capitals nerfed into the *absolute* ground are from poor, small, irrelevant groups that live in high, low, or wormhole space? I don’t even rat in capitals and it’s amazing how much butthurt these groups feel against the average capital user. Like, I get that supercaps are oppressive, but they forget how expensive and time consuming capital skilling is for the average pilot. And I’m not talking about guys with 30 Rorquals, I’m talking about the average guy with his Thanatos thats basically getting screwed here.
---
It’s the Olmeca Gold mentality. The people who do nothing but hunt (and who probably don’t own caps) want to be able to kill expensive toys with risk-free bomber blobs then moonwalk out. They want the pendulum to swing their way without really thinking of balance. 
---
I would never quit, but Jesus, you’re foolish if you don’t think pressing established players too hard won’t make some quit. You know what happens when fishing pressure becomes too high? You run out of fish to catch. Just saying.
---
This
---
im sure these cyno changes are to stop heavy tanked ships and cheap throw aways from being used to cynoing in things, or to keep a cyno going mid fight. Putting it on a marader or in this case a monitor would defeat that purpose.
---
imagine understanding that minerals go into super builds and supers print isk
---
If you complain about excavs getting bombed then you are complaining about them dying too quickly because you get no chance at counterplay (as you stated below). It is the underlying reason you complain about.  
---
&gt;That's nearly pve because the player controlling them had no counter play.  
---
What does this even mean? Pve isn't defined by "having no counterplay" , it is defined as players shooting npcs. If you want to imply that you as a nullbear are as inept at fighting back as an npc then you are also implying that you are a moron.  
---
There is a myriad of ways to outplay hunting gangs (baiting them in a pvp fit, having a counterdrop on standby, using intel channels, spies, setting up gatecamps to trap them into pockets,...) but they require you to do more than just logging and going straight to krabbing. But i understand how hard that is, because now you have to turn on your brain and maybe even talk with other people in your alliance, yikes!  
---
&gt; Once the cyno changes go in ratting carriers will have no counter play to bomber fleets and either stop undocking or due in droves
---
Man it is almost as if this change was intended to exactly do that :thonking:
---
And now i can finally get to the core of your argument "there is no meaningful pvp because either it is supercaps or bomber fleets".  
---
This has always been one of the things that happens in eve pvp: If you can escalate the hardest you will win a fight. There is no fundamental problem with this.  
---
The problem with the current meta is that the escalation chain is broken. Instead of slowly ramping up fights going from subcap to caps to supers, we now directly skip step 1 and drop caps (cyno changes will slow this down btw, it will be great).  
---
What you are pointing out are symptoms of the ensuing arms race. 200man bomber fleets get fielded because they are nimble enough to evade the inevitable cap drop, while also being the only thing that size that can punch through your most common targets (caps) quickly.  
---
To "fix" this symptom we need to go to the root of the issue (one that you seem to think doesn't exist given your posts about how null only has received nerfs in recent years). Fix the infinite anom respawns, delete excavs and turn rorqs back into a boosting platform and disincentivize the use of ratting carriers.  
---
If you do all this the 200man goku fleets become obsolete, because they won't be good at dealing with subcap response fleets/using them would be like dropping a sledgehammer on a tack.  
---
Instead we would get more ship variety for hunters, and we might actually get interesting fights from the resulting game of rock paper scissor style counterplay that makes pvp so fun.
---
rorq mining -&gt; super proliferation -&gt; super ratting -&gt; isk
---
it's not rocket surgery
---
Reading comprehension, yo!
---
I was the one responding that there are positives to the ones complaining all was bad.    (But I guess the flair checks out.)
---
/eyeroll
---
It's not about "putting the toy in perfect safety" it's about having the ability to put the toy somewhere and get out of it, which was not something that could happen pre-Citadel. People had to have sitter accounts, POSes for every super, and a bunch of other crap to keep them "perfectly safe."  It was inconvenient. 
---
Having a place to park them and let people train supercap skills on mains is just a convenience thing. That's it. 
---
It's not like CCP just handed this stuff to these groups. They earned it. Folks do not like having what they earned taken away from them - this is basic shit.
---
\*cries in proteus\*
---
Almost any small gang capable of killing a carrier (I'm talking less than 10 dudes) is putting more isk on the field than the carrier is worth.
---
Nobody wants the small gangs to come back. They drop the caps to keep the small gangs out.  Nobody is dropping caps for good fights.  They're dropping caps to keep people away so they can man/rat in piece. 
---
Duh.
---
Should be fixed now.
---
 r/ eve 2019... I can't tell if you are being serious or not.
---
Just a bit of clarification. Actually, there is no premium. The game is designed to be played as Omega (monthly subscription/500 Plex). Consider the Alpha just a never ending trial, that, compared to other games, let us try a lot of content.
---
It's this kind of stupid idea that somehow makes it to CCP as a good idea. Please stop. Just don't.
---
With 3 chars I run 1xNestor plus 2xLeshaks.  The Leshaks cap transfer each other and then have 2 RR for the Nestor, the Nestor can rep the Leshaks if they have agro.
---
Its about 25/30 mins for site plus Drifter give or take.  Dubious that 2 Leshaks can tank it alone, esp the Drifter but maybe.  Note that the Nestor has higher sig radius than Leshaks so it will always end up with the Drifter agro after it switches once or twice.  Mass wise Leshaks are 60m and Nestors 20m so you are only putting 140m or so on the hole each way.
---
There's a name resolution issue with ESI. It should be fixed soon.
---
(wasn't touched over the weekend, as friday deployments are the devil.)

seriously, just go try it on sisi. Doesn't matter what advice you ge here nothing will trump that experience

Hah have you met the average null linemember?

I thought did you did not lose sp anymore ..at all

---
I Burn Jita every day!
---
That’s what we said.
---
I didnt know the pc was tied to highest score. Taking that into account then yeah tying that into a possibly unusable product is a stupid move.
---
But again Id more blame Hadreon instead of CCP for that. As much as I am happy to bash CCP and Hilmar for their screw ups this aint a CCP run event its a Hadreon event using CCP's playerbase as a test group.
---
Thats not feasible in the slightest. Everyone can scan and any group wealthy enough to pay your laughably high price already has people scanning around doing stuff.
---
You'll probably spend more replacing your ship and spending time getting to NS, than making ISK. Not?
---
Why when I can do it on 10 man EZ Mode and get the same content. 
---
Thats what killed the game for me.
---
wormholes version of big is like 10 dudes.
---
In nullsec we have fights in their peek that can hit over 5k players in a single battle, and no their not just supers and titans, these mega fleets are composed of supers, caps and subcaps, Nullsec has empires that spawn whole regions and along with that comes the logistical nightmare of actually keeping it all running and alive, hell just moving assets and players into a forward operating base to begin a war is a logistical nightmare in and of its self, then you have all the daily operational and sov defence shit to factor in.
---
Because Test and Goons make this shit look easy does not mean it is easy.
---
It *really* helps to have enough of a bank roll to ride out the crashes, without needing to sell at a loss to make your next time.
---
Thats not true. He's very good a listening to the minority who post rants on r/eve and thinking that its what the majority of players think is wrong with the game.
---
Probably not. Given the recent triglav/sleeper/drifter stuff and how it interacts with sansha, i'd imagine they stole from the sleepers or drifters for that tech.
---
&gt; diamond rats didn't randomly warp in on you and infinite point you and kill you
---
When did this happen?
---
Pretty sure i ready about this in the patchnots and it says something like "if you dont want to copy formatting use rightclick" or something like that.
---
When calculating if something is worth making, make sure you \_also\_ pay attention to the taxes and fees for selling it. 
---
Most tools don't. (I never got round to putting it in my public one, for example. Some day I'll make it intuitive enough)
---
You sound like you are 13yo and need to feel important in pixel space ship game.         
---
To answer your questions - yes i did.        
---
On eve meets.         
---
They are usually 30+ and sometimes come with kids.         
---
Damn i consider myself to be below this "average null linemember" as i don't have time to play the game due to RL.
---
Why can't you rat in your PvP fit?   You won't get the best ticks, but you can certainly have your heavies out ratting, and when the bombers show up you disconnect and send out the lights.
---
One friend got kills by ratting in a VNI with a few changes to buff it for PvP.  His motto was "ALWAYS fit a point or scram".  It just meant he couldn't AFK the early stage of an anom.
---
I fail to see how giving more casual players a joyride killed the game.
---
Let's do the same for bombers, they are cheap, they can deal massive damage to end game ship and their playstyle keep having buff, I would find it fair heh
---
At least they are saving us from another garbage game.
---
Yeah. There is ways og doing a Lot of money. A Carehole is a shitonn of isk.
---
I'm talking on single account and less hardcore stuff.
---
I am not complaining at all. The projection of overwhelming force against people harassing krabbers is *designed* to discourage you from harassing krabbers. I think you are confusing us, or at least me, for a straw man you've built in your head.
---
They have only fucked a small minority like yourself, not a lot. These changes will not affect the numbers by any significant means ya baby.
---
Usually the convo after a kill is a random dickhead trying to gloat... At least from my experience either Its gloating for killing you or a guy giving shit and salt over a combat site he wasn't willing to compete with you over --"
---
No it is simply that the balancing changes that you propose are shit because you want to get back at the "evil" wormholers, because your beloved NS got nerfed.  
---
Completely forgoing the fact that we are the smallest playergroup in eve (iirc 2-3% of the playerbase), and that we have a long standing meme about how due to that we don't get any wormhole specific changes at all.  
---
I know few wormholers that would disagree with nerfing subcap C5 farming, fixing wormhole nodes to reduce gridfu during brawls and nerfing the godawful injector fax bullshit that makes highclass pvp a farce.  
---
But hey you keep doing you.
---
The interface is kind of like that :)
---
Took me till around a month ago to find the preview option for ME/TE
---
It's a great time, he is just in Goons, so a little butthurt over the changes
---
Flair checks out.
---
My point is that the version with zero formatting should be default upon copying or cutting. But yeah you're right, now that I'm looking at the notes: 
---

---
Oh boy! I am super excited. 
---
Fake Edit: 
---
It's really too bad that the written word cannot impart sarcasm in the way that someone's voice can.
---
Lol. It is not a small minority in Eve who has multiple account, most players do. So if you think it's only a small minority then someone's taking you for a ride my friend.
---
This is why the players are to “blame” for 
---
***C.H.A.O.S.***
---
Serious question:  Does anyone have a link to something that proves hunting corps are risk averse and won't take a fight other than a sure win?   I have been in a few smaller corps that would roam and hunt pretty regularly, but our KB's were always filled with some blingy losses and there were definitely both suicide roams and WTF-"let's do this anyway" roams. 
---
And sure, there are krabs who roam and engage in some PvP, but might it be that since they are accustomed to a different game than the smaller corps that their whole attitude when on comms/in a roam is just very different and they don't know it?
---
You know.... This shit is dumb. Before blackout, there were always risking gangs of 12+ in 1DQ and they could spend the day going gate to gate bubbling and killing everything. I tried to defend but usually ended up dying alone.
---
The idea that a goons drop caps on everything is absurd. They don't take home defense they seriously. It was one of my reason for eventually leaving null. Now if you fuck with their Rorqs or Supers and that's something else.
---
these changes will not prevent large null blocs from dropping caps on small gangs; they will simply have a force recon on grid now instead of lighting the cyno on a rorq
---
these changes hurt their ability to batphone for help/drop their own dreads much more so.
---
So, let me get this right.
---
1. You wanted null sec to have no local to make it easier for you to catch things;
---
2. You wanted cynos changed to make it less risky to go after people in null who can't see you, your covert cyno, or your bomber gang; AND 
---
3. Now, not content with that, you want CCP to make your life *even easier* by increasing the spawn rate of wormholes into null; THEN
---
4. You will probably still complain about how null sec players want easier no risk gameplay;
---
isnt that the goal of these drops, having nobody bothering you wile ratting/mining
---
Should people just feed tackle ships to kitey gangs who just warp away when they are presented with a challenging fight?
---
Absolutely not, unless by content you mean more hours spent scanning.
---
Do you stand a chance with a PvE fit if sometimes you want to fight instead of fleeing ?
---
Oh my.
---
Of course.
---
I don't know why anyone in goons would be complaining about not getting content.   Sigs &amp; Squads are deployed so folks who want some action don't have to sit around at home and wait for someone to visit Delve.
---
&gt; If the person can afford a super or a titan they can afford the paltry couple of billion to asset safety it. 
---
Well that's just not true alot of the time.  But I also support raising the tax on it.
---
Hey PGL, hows that not playing the game going?
---
&gt;You guys have a choice whether to drop caps or bring subcaps because its YOUR SOV. Choosing caps is what makes you a coward.
---
Implying defence fleets don't drop in overwhelming numbers/caps to guarantee a win. You don't want your home system known as a place to go to get kills do you? 
---
How can you not understand this? Also bring your own caps if theirs are so OP. 
---
&gt;Also the most ironic part is that we just don't engage you when you bring cancer so you deny yourselves content by being cowards and then you go on the forums to whine about no content in null.
---
I mean pretty sure that's what the "hunters" do. The "null is empty" posts aren't from people defending their sov.
---
Meh, okish
---
Pretty sure Karmafleet is bigger than Dreddit, but it's pretty close.

Finally, an effective nerf to TEST alliance.
---
Online versus not online.
---
I've managed to kill a rail comet in a breacher, but forget a blaster comet.
---
My experience as a newbie so far.
---
At the starter agent station discover I could sell minerals required for missions at 87% above the regional average to other newbs. Hell yeah found a niche market to sell in! Get mining and $$$
---
Then realised a early gun was selling for a really high 100k each but the BPO was only 90k. That price was BS and wanted to undercut them. Mined and bought the materials for a 100 item run. 230k investment 5.3 mill return made. Hell yeah! Damn Alpha and limited production skills... And waiting for a real trading to come in and undercut my RRR...
---
Just complete my first HS exploration run and 6.2 mill in loot! Practiced being parinoid on d-scan. Just not sure what are my triggers to run if in low sec. Also gotta risk the run to my local trading hub to turn it into cash without being ganked for my loot...
---
Only issue is actual fighting, locking, reactivating my guns on new targets... Doesn't feel right, use to the old freelancer game, view in close. Eve is more viewed on a strategic level (zoomed out) you don't see the detail of your ship fighting. If you zoom in you lose situational awareness... Just gotta get use to it and what to look for.
---
While mining discovered NPC pirate faction miners do 0.6 space astroids so going to practice combat scanning and ganking them. Saw lots of afk mining drones and wanted to see if I could steal them... Only possible in an Omega ship and not in HS... Damn they are safe for now.
---
Also finding a suitable corp. More fun to play with people.
---
You will find what you are looking for in eve.
---
If dropping caps on gangs is the best way to defend your space then of course do that. I don't blame anyone for doing, just CCP for designing capitals this way. 
---
Like on the other side we've got small gangs who fly cancerous kitey shit or stealth bomber gangs. Why? Because it's the best way to fight outnumbered or to gank things before capitals show up. 
---
If you're doing the most effective thing then you're doing it right. It's CCP's job to bend the meta toward the most effective thing also being the most fun thing, generally.
---
No it's not. The extra low is not worth losing T2 resists and lower sig. Not to mention the 50% bonus with MWD on or the ability to fit a ADC.
---
&gt;they should therefore be able to kill carriers solo when you have more than 80mil sp.
---
This is the kind of person who routinely cries about caps everyone.
---
Thanks! I could restore the launcher now.
---
I only do LV5 from time to time. Not a mission runner my self so don't know how to be 100% eff. I'm an Explo 99% of the time.
---
I suppose that you can invest un a fited Carrier in every Sistem that missions spawn and only do the blitzable one, right?
---
When i do it, i use a Barghest. Gating a Carrier is a pain. One of our guys has Raven Navy Issue all over the systems. Maybe i turn to LV5 for a change un future.
---
I think the change is too restrictive. Cynos should be allowed on more ship hulls in exchange for other drawbacks. Using a regular carrier for anything is going to be a huge pain in the ass, and with bomber gangs running around, they’ve basically become food. I’m not really comfortable with the idea of undetectable 60 man bomber blobs killing expensive assets then disengaging at will - all while incurring no jump fatigue so that they can do it again and again and again. Shit is going to get really old quick. 
---
Why not make scrams shut down cynos and prevent their activation? Maybe even give them a spool up timer to balance things out and make sure ratters are paying attention. Or at least expand the number of ships that can fit them. Why would *anyone* even fit a regular cyno on a Blops at current prices? That’s the dumbest change I’ve ever heard. It literally hurts my brain.
---
How about just not allowing any capitals in w space. I want to watch the veins pop on the w space people who complain about null sec krabbing while running their wormhole sites in capitals.
---
Then rolling nullsec wormholes in your space should be no problem.
---
Oh no going to unsub your 50 accounts? Its funny how players think they know more than the devs that make the game. I created my character in 2007 and I heard this nonsense back then. I returned over 10 years later, the game is still very much alive and it's funny I still hear the same thing. 
---
No this update will not tank the player base, and I will bet will any update in the foreseeable future. What will tank the player base is big microtransaction changes. It would have to be something that more game breaking than skill injectors.
---
but Lorenzo Maulerant told me there is no content in space D:
---
i’ve rarely played a good mmo that 1 account is optimal . theres always a role in a  game that an actual player wont want to fill and thats where alts come in.
---
be it cynos,
---
logis
---
links
---
buffs
---
heals 
---
etc
---
Where does this happen?
---
It's not impossible but also not likely if they come prepared. I used to just run DEDs in a PvP fit mach so I could take fights in the site or bait them out to a celestial. It even allowed me to go kill someone else in system running anoms and belts. Definitely not optimal but it allowed me to have fun while trying to make ISK.
---
We also drop caps for killmarks :)
---
[This](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/compilation-the-lore-of-the-jove/183437/2) seems to suggest that Society of Conscious Thought may have shared Jove technology to Sansha's Nation.
---
He is thankfully being sarcastic, but you are right there are people who actually believe that.
---
the problem is propably that except from some terminal spodbrains the people that do these drops and the people that complain are not the same. But contradicting voices coming from the same group makes the group as a whole sound somewhat silly.
---
I've been out of the WH game for a couple of years, but we used to do "when in doubt" jumps on very crit wormholes with a HIC with the bubble up to reduce its mass by 80%, then jump back without bubble but with an active 500mn MWD to give it 65mil mass to push through. I don't recall if running two bubbles reduced it for another 80% (been too long)
---
In a couple years of rolling, the HIC-trick only failed me once. That's why you bring a cloak and probe launcher. vOv
---
on reddit
---
Sources on everyone complaining groups aren't roaming into their space. The whole idea of dropping overwhelming force is to encourage you to not come to our space.
---
Can't you just sit on a depot and refit the MJD to more tank?
---
He did it poorly, that's for sure. If he did it right you'd have no log or way of tracking it. Obviously he's stupid, considering what he did (and most old corps know him for being an idiot), but if he were like 5% smarter he would have gotten away with it, easily.
---
ESI only stretches as far as you allow it. There's no way for you to track alt characters and such, and all he has to do is make trades look convincing, since you can't see specifics.
---
Ugh no, not doggo
---
Blap the recon before leaving grid
---
Yep.  I thought it was a little heavy-handed too. However, you used to only get a suspect flag as a neutral logi and it was abused because the neutral logi could just rep themselves. You had to bring an overwhelming force to destroy the neutral logi before you could attack the fleet proper.
---
A recon dies quicker than a rorq. You can kill a recon potentially before the caps even jump, or at least before too many come through. You're getting maybe 50-60k EHP out of a recon, it's not invincible like a rorq is.
---
Unless they're literally johnny-on-the-spot with jumping, it's a benefit to small gangs; every rorq has a cyno, not every spod brain will have a force recon sat on grid.
---
Furthermore, you can at least kill their cyno and leave grid and either come back later or at least leave with a killmail. It's way better than what currently happens which is caps drop, small gang leaves, noone gets any kills and everyone is sad.
---
Is this really the origin of it? I had no idea it wasn't a real word/slang, or that it was exclusive to EVE.
---
What kind of dps and tank do you need to run these sites?
---
technically, yes. In practice when a new sig appears it's much easier to scoop drones and mjd away rather than refitting on 2+ accounts
---
what if lighting a cyno increases sig radius?
---
Lowsec is full of people. Iz scury
---
Which is smart, but not nearly as fun.
---
Lmao all these npc bees and dinos thinking they have rights in game
---
But so many supers and titans will die due to stuff like bumping off the stargate, structure or each other.           
---
Years ago my carrier bumped off a titan ^(after like 10minutes standing next to him) just to stop over 300km away.           
---
This is still the issue, even bigger as you gate capitals now.
---
FW missions or exploration
---
This will not change.
---
why would it be FC's lighting, there would simply be a few montors in fleet
---
its more the idea off how big the wreck is if you try and put the  work into stop some one stealing the  loot, its very likely your still not gonna be able to stop the person doing it.   
---
then it becomes a question off, "whats the point running the kill if there almost nothing we can do to stop some one stealing our reward."
---
Imagine yourself being in NC after this change.      
---
PH will need to babysit all the NC ops.
---
Aren't these really "The Crazed Eyes of Hilmar" lol?
---
Loki ir Legions are the way to go.
---
Since we fly a Lot of armor doctrines, our fleets are of Legion. The are less adaptable than Lokis, but boy, they tank. Then it's easy. Some DPS Legions, some logi legions.
---
They will get Even more meta, with cyno changes.
---
Best kill report I've seen in awhile lol. What a time to be playing eve pipe bombing hahaha
---
Equip a target painter and you'll become higher priority most of the time.
---
if a marauder lit the cyno, just FYI, it would have to be buffer fit. 1 arty nag would alpha the marauder if active tanked xD lol. which id love tbh, but it doesnt take much to wipe subcaps off grid that arnt moving
---
Yes it is.  It is always a good time.
---
That's why, this time, it was booked for a Sunday. Which is *commonly* a day off for people.
---
If you fit full tank and long range weapons you can kill the booss and then warp out (remember to bookmark the area). Then come back few minutes later when the site has despawned.  
---
I know Hurricane can do that, Gnosis can probably too.
---
I recently had a run of 14 consecutive 6/10s where neither A-type EANM nor repper dropped. OP should buy a lotto ticket.
---
If ur a 'small gang' you will not be able to blap a 400k falcon before they get carriers/fax onto grid
---
you used to loose SP if you didnt 'upgrade your clone' when you lost you pod.
---
Tier3 Cruisers you still loose SP
---
Show me that 400k ehp fit falcon please
---
the chances of shooting someone in yulai today are around 100% whereas in your chain depending on tz probably less than 1/4 of that
---
HIC is better imo, allows you to tackle a super then drop the hammer on it
---
All those flightleader videos 😩
---
I live in a wormhole so yeah I do want people to come for a fight
---
I can run up to 5/10s in a Stratios (scannable). Take a while though, so isk per hour is meh. 4/10s are nice.
---
\&gt;My issue is they are just “hunters” they aren’t looking for good fights. My experience with roaming gangs is they will ONLY engage someone if they are 90% certain they can win without losing a single ship. 
---
I will destroy your statement with pure footage.
---
[Hunters arent looking for good Fights.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6jjQemJ_F8&amp;t=1312s)
---
\&gt;I really don’t like the upcoming cyno change because one of the only ways to ever catch these gangs was to pretend to be completely defenseless 
---
You are just weak like your comrades and have no idea about basic piloting maneuveres and dmg projection. Thats why you only depend on baits to get frags.
---
Any small gang group would fight you immediatly if you field same numbers and firepower. But you are to shit pilots and risk averse to do it.
---
\&gt; The roaming gangs have just got stronger. And the people that grind there adms, defend their territory, and invest their own isk into their industrial empires just got another major shit change to quality of life. They will adapt and overcome.  
---
Only reason people like you live in nullsec is because the game was a shit show unbalance fieasta. Thank god times are changing after 4years.
---
Also zero faks if you adapt or not. We survived the capital AIDs era. No matter what you do we will outplay you 90% of the time cause we are simple better pilots with thicker skin.
---
\&gt; Ccp please change something about cynos. (Mass limited, not on capitals, can be jammed, buff cyno Inhibs, etc) but this change is really destroying a lot of playstyles that aren’t overpowered and definitely deserve their place in game. 
---
You dont deserve shit you only earn things in life and in game. 
---
As always Adapt or quit.
---
the way i taught myself means when i see 'drop' drugs used when shooting a scram webbed target not even bothering to move makes my skin crawl. sorry to pick XD
---
Hunters only want one thing ...
---
You say that like it’s a bad thing. If I knew I had guaranteed descending connections in every chain I wouldn’t have to roll for potentially hours to find a decent exit.
---
Also this would be hell for logistics since every battleship would have to come in as a DST, since C1s are mass limited to BC and down
---
See theres a catch 22 there.  It's harder to move supers/titans via cyno so they will be gating more often, but its also harder to light a cyno for dreads to blap it quickly enough giving the defenders time to move subcaps into range.
---
Also, every single nullsec system with have a cyno beacon in it, if it doesnt already.
---
Would hurt the people that small gang drop supers on rorqs and aren’t risk averse fags with them more than anyone
---
You are in for a wild ride.
---
Some GM is somewhere in the system ... when you arrive probably 100 are already around the particular station ... over the time you might reach tidi amount of people.
---
Then suddenly GM's talking in local, or not directly a GM, but Concord-Toon, that will basically announce somethings incoming and then there will be something big suspect blingy appearing in front of you ... happy shooting.
---
pipebombs are hilarious to watch.
---
Oh on reddit what a clear answer. I saw one meme with titans making a star because they were bored but that's it. Acting like this is a constant thing is ignorant.
---
You have choices.  There are a lot of big-bloc (and not so big) who will feed you all you need.  You can also join some smaller entities that figure out how to be more self-sufficient.  Or you can start one place and move to another.
---
Personal opinion is to learn how to manage a lot on your own.  It is more satisfying and more challenging.  It also means you will get to see more available options than just what is shown to you.  
---
Becoming self-sufficient gives you freedom.  You want to join a big-bloc?  Ok.  You want to join a small group?  This is now open to you because you don't need all things made easy.
---
he did like no damage to you, if he staggered his insane amount of nos (way to many) / neuts he wouldve kept you dry and he would not of been pointed or webbed
---
Nobody gives a shit about 1dq. It's not a ratting or mining system.
---
Everything in EVE is in UTC. If it is not you can yell at the idiot who used local time.
---
(Iceland happens to also be in UTC but that is just happy coincidence)
---
God bless SrGrafo and his excellent meme templates.
---
I use a leshak and a zarmzad for c5 sites. I know it isn't as isk efficiant as 2x rattles or even nesters, but i was bored and wondered if it would work. Which by the way it's easy as shit almost afk mode.
---
Since you have no arguing point you jump directly to insults? Sort of sad that you run out of steam after spewing your shit opinion, lol
---
30+ with kids has nothing to do with the average null linemember complaining about how they have no small gangs running through... in contrast to their alliance who purposely drops capitals to keep small gangs away
---
classic
---
&gt; You won't get the best ticks
---
Here are the numbers for 3 DDA ratting ships.
---
Myrmidon : 13.5M
---
Ishtar : 18M
---
Dominix : 17M
---
Drop to 1 DDA for a "PVP fit" and you make less than highsec missions. You still can't "full PVP fit" because you are getting attacked by rats while you wait for people to jump on you, so you need cap mods in there that normal PVP fits don't use.
---
At that point just go to highsec to run missions or incursions or whatever.
---
Based on it being "whack a bot" it sounds like they will be dropping NPC supers.
---
Its still a thing, i know because i roam with them
---

&gt;we don't get any wormhole specific changes at all.
---
Does it really need to change?
---
and i think you will find in my history, plenty of me defending the changes in nullsec. Its hella fun, superb for the game. makes nullsec feel more nullsec. i fully support it lol.
---
if wormholes were so bad, no one would live there, they dont need fixing, they need nerfing or not touching.
---
if no one bothered to live there they would im sure change it and 'fix' the issues. as far as moaning about wormholes for so long goes. people have also said eve is dead for a while. thats also easy to ignore
---
&gt; Most hunters will take a "fair" fight even if it means they might lose.
---
Welcome to EVE!
---
Play the tutorial, ask a lot in help channel and if you're still here after 2 weeks, congrats!
---
Don't join just any corp because everyone tells you to, especially nullsec. They need just taxpayers.
---
Figure out, which playstyle suits you and join a corp that does exactly that. Look for the eve career chart online and see, what you can do.
---
hahahah not even a neutral alt to cyno them in
---
I get not wanting to work late, but it would be really cool if CCP would let a dev or two run something in each tz (give them a PTO day for working late to run the event!). This seems to be shaping up as two years in a row where all the interesting activities happen when I'm at work (Central USTZ). 
---
=(
---
A brick tanked falcon will get 400k ehp with links for about 1bil (before shield slaves/min maxing etc). A true “small gang” will not be able to kill it before faxes can jump to it.
---
I agree with you that this change makes it harder to save rorqs and that it is a good thing. 
---
Just wanna clarify that im mostly in support of these changes, i just wish that recons get a cyno duration of 1 minute, and that t3cs can light a cyno w/ the covert ops subsystem for a 5 minute duration.
---
What insult. You asked if he had ever met the average lime member... He was just describing them after confirming that he had indeed met your average null sec line member.

You dont deserve shit you only earn things in this game like in real life.
---
In HA Brawls that 50% MWD bonus is irrelevant since you’ll get webbed down by dual 95%+ Vindi webs and blapped by dreads, in that situation an AB is better, also, the Iki *does* get T2 resists, but there’s a nice fun Kin hole and the Drek gets a 20% bonus, which gives it higher base Kin/EM!
---
If Ikis were so good then some WH groups would start using them for HA brawls, instead, they still run Drekas because Ikis aren’t as good (in that role, Dead Terrorists are using them in NS Whaling fleets to great effect).
---
There was a PH gang in 1DQ1 for many hours camping the various gates...yesterday.
---
same place i did in mine :D
---
u/Rolmar clearly deserves the crown
---
&gt; Is two frigate alts too much to ask? One has to train a cloak!!
---
Yes. Alts with eyes on staging areas 8 jumps away *is* too much to ask, for 6 guys who just want to do a cruiser roam without spending two hours getting set up.
---
This sounds almost like...   Eve.
---
Even when I was mining in HS as a solo newb this was how it was.  There was an organized NPC corp that provided boosts and bought ore in a .5 system.  But it was regularly visited by CODE and gankers so you had to keep your eyes at least partially open.  This isn't exactly describing WH space, but it meant you learned that in EvE things will kill you if you aren't paying attention.  Personally I also learned that mining is dull and found other ways to become self-sufficient.
---
I never thought a random fight would cause a reddit post to reach 200+ comments  :)
---
This is so true it's hilarious. Take a look at LXQ2. A system where pandemic horde and slyce regularly frequent in numbers. They feed like crazy. Guess what, it's a pretty popular roaming destination, because it provides killmails. Right next door, pandemic legion, triumvirate, NC dot etc; generally higher skilled players, veteran players (well for triumvirate and maybe pl lol), drops toys on gangs, they mine in relative peace and their space is quiet. 
---
Wonder why that is? PvP are risk averse as anyone and they go to the path of least resistance to get easy kills.
---
That also works, if un-fueled it self destructs after a period of time.
---
Higher wanderer spawn frequency. That’s probably the simplest and easiest method for increasing connectivity and pvp.
---
Pipe bombing? Another eve term that I have no idea what its meaning is lol

The complaint is that theres less potential targets out in space after the blackout. Not that their umbrella is working as intended.
---
everyone will just do the dance and do more coordinated jump ins.
---
Basically, while a fleet is moving, scouts look ahead to find bubbles and enemies camping.
---
THen the fleet warps.
---
Pipebombing describes the action of, after the scout clears a system (often this is signalled by a spy in the comms or fleet) a dictor with a cyno with bubble the warp path, as the fleet enters warp (now into the bubble) the cyno goes up and you jump a bunch of smart bombing battleships through and as the fleet lands, you disco party until they are all dead.

To /u/Nazori **THANK YOU**
---
I want to say that I quit after my first week in Eve because I saw that something is VERY wrong with this game.  Fundamentally with things like Skill Injectors, Real Money Transactions and Bots that it is basically a Moneypit for CCP and Money Making scheme shrouded in a space game.
---
I did a LOT of reading and researching and VERY easily came to that conclusion.  With the time (or Money) factor involved in building up skills to become competent in playing this game, I wouldn't waste a cent on it because of those factors **PLUS** with the apparent Botting that has occured for  last few years that has inflated the price of ISK to insane levels as the OP pointed.

---
Same could be said about a lot of the issues in NS as well. Dont think Ive met too many that would actually say the Rorq is a healthy ship or that the Rorq meta has been good for the game. But the things we wanted changed the most havent been fixed and the current changes we are getting whilst getting shat on from every direction are counterproductive.
---
But in no way do I belive its fair to hurt WHs because of this, 2 wrongs dont make 1 right.
---
perhaps also the players should not complain if the mechanic is changed?
---
There have been a lot of complaints that the changes are affecting "the way the game was designed" without accepting that most of the game design allowing that game play were themselves at some point changes in the game.
---
Exactly
---
Ah, that's a great idea - thanks!
---
What if the game designers themselves DO want people back and roaming around?  Are they not permitted to change the game to suit their purpose?
---
If you're dumb enough to let a vindi get in web scram range of you with dreads on the field then you're going to die no matter what you fly but at least you might survive a volley with ADC so there's that.
---

---
I count 15 A-Types. That almost has to be more than 6 6/10s. I can't remember ever getting 3 deadspace mods in a single site.
---
Look at the killboards of other groups who do this to get examples of fits. Inner Hell is a wormhole group that does blops Lokis
---
Perhaps your problem is that you believe the way to play the game is to maximize your ticks?   The point is that you could rat in a PvP ship.  Yes, you won't get the max ticks.  But you will get to "hunt the hunted" WHICH WAS THE TITLE OF THE POST!   And as a bonus you will get paid some ratting ticks to do it, and get paid to look like bait.
---
(This whole "but muh ticks" attitude...   Just. Won't. Die.   Even when talking about PvP.)
---
As a percentage what proportion of the membership of those large alliances have a meaningful contribution to maintaining that complexity? If you aren’t leadership it _is_ easy...
---
It depends on how you look at. Making it harder for caps to run anoms isn't shitting all over caps necessarily. Tengus used to be op at running DED sites, they take alot more work now. VNIs could afk an anomaly, they can no longer do it afk. There is too much easy isk and coincidently inflation.
---
To your point about nerfing resources, from what I understand that is also on the table with depletable and varying ores in null rather than static belts which at least limits the rorq orgy in many cases.
---
Caps are still powerful event changing ships that really should be more for bashing other caps and structures and influencing sovereignty. You can still rat in them albeit with more risk.
---
See, this is how things *should* work. But CCP doesn't iterate or balance, so players try to instill whatever bullshit mentality they think is "good for the game."
---
Cyno beacons are expensive to maintain. Small groups likely wont be able to afford many
---
All these structures have costs
---
When CCP announced Blackout, one of the first things i thought was pipebombing.
---
Yes I too love to watch TV instead of playing a game I pay for
---
Was looking at fit and thought there’s nothing horrendously wrong with it....then saw what killed you. F
---
Yup lol
---
Yes it's totally viable. You'll be locked out of some "group" content, like incursions (high-end pvp) or null sec sovereignty warfare, which require fleets or corporations to join. But if you want to be a lone wolf, you can do it. There are many game options that suit solo players, like exploration, faction warfare, trading and industry, and solo piracy.
---
You talk like people don't need isk to do things that the want to do and their time isn't limited by having IRL responsibilities. The purpose of ratting is to make some money so you can spend it on other things, I despise ratting and the less of it I have to do the better. Intentionally cropping income to occasionally catch the random idiot stealth bomber is not a good course of action.
---
&gt; Like on the other side we've got small gangs who fly cancerous kitey shit or stealth bomber gangs. Why? Because it's the best way to fight outnumbered or to gank things before capitals show up.
---
It's not the best way, it's the only way. You need to be agile enough, that when the titans do drop, you can GTFO before the Boson goes off.
---
who is complaining a about pvp being dead? we drop so we can back to our day to day.
---
And can warp cloaked
---
I'm not complaining. I am quite happy there is an added dimension to dropping my caps. Now I have an actual reason to drop my fax with my haw dreads. I can't wait
---
Ah, you see, to fix this, there are now double the number of wormholes.
---
you should probably rub a few braincells together, search some googles, or look at some youtube guides on how to make isk in EVE Online.
---
its not that fucking hard
---
doon;t be foold by the video's length, its sped up drasticaly, the normal time is likely 1 hour or so, i got fooled by somthing very similar when i was looking at playing with rattlesnakes, and learned that lesson the hard way.
---
The imperium is recruiting, you are qualified.
---
Nice practice for one of those response fleets warping in from a cyno beacon instead of direct to the tackled super.
---
Wake me up for the ustz stuff.....
---
Sleeps the week away.

---
CCP need to nerf kitey BS and nerf cap drops. Make everybody have fun by brawling at 0 like real men.
---
plus reps from (atlast) a rorqual
---
Which is the problem. Not you, not hunters, but simply the fact that finding even semi-good fights are really hard. And honestly, this is a CCP issue. If they had spent some of the dev time theyve put on PvE content these past 2 years (abyss, trigs) there would perhaps be a pleasant way of actually getting fights instead of killing PvE people.
---
They could have done something as easy as to create a staged arena just like in other games. You click a button and your ship is transported into an arena where someone else has chosen the same thing. You could go in with fleets or solo bla bla bla. I know, its tacky for Eve but Im certain it would work. And honestly, most of that work is already done (AT), they only need to make it wider. Could even throw in some isk for winners or something to make it viable to actually just do PvP for a living.
---
Above is just a suggestion but the point is that Eve needs more content. Right now its cutting away things to allow for more ganks, which most can agree on is really bad content. And it will only back fire because thats based on actually having people to gank and from where Im sitting that well will run dry up soon.
---
Okay, then you don’t have much to whine about in terms of scalability or other players min maxing then. I mom max to a moderate degreee and I make 200m-300/hr (wher btw )
---
&gt; RnK invents pipebombing....moving to Serenity.....wrecking chinese mango guys.
---
Wtf are you talking about? Only Lord Maldoror and mybe 2 or 3 other guys went to Serenity, they did not wreck Mango (PIBC on Serenity) but join them (PIBC-Head_FC Fulcrum is a personal friend and the mandarin teacher of LM)
---
QUIET and burning bridges. Name a more iconic duo
---
But muh cloke
---
yes, 100% they should also increase the number of null to null wormholes as those lead to some very interesting fights.
---
And since its already expensive, a gistum-a type 50mn doesn't cut its tank down much so it can hang with the gang if need, or ping off during a fight until cyno is needed
---
No need to be nasty.
---
That was great fun, my friend Fu1crum.  Xièxiè.

yeah there is. fucking braindead questions deserve nasty responses.

Then don't make the optimal way to play revolve around making the other person's game experience miserable.

Supers have very little to do with it. They are just a convenient way to do the thing, if it wasn't supers it would just be some other ship.

Just going to leave that here.
---
False equivalence: more like "Any athlete is not always a real athlete." This obviously doesn't make sense, despite you using tautologies to try and prove your point. What sets "Any PVP" aside from "Real PVP"? It's entirely arbitrary, isn't it?
---
Which isnt needed. You dont need more isk on the field to kill a carrier. But if you bring 20 people together for a roam in pretty much anything worth roaming in then the price will quickly go up.
---
&gt; Also what's stopping one side of a fleet just combat probing the enemy carriers?
---
Absolutely nothing, which means that the carrier will have to keep warping around to avoid getting pinned down and destroyed.
---
dude you are just embarrasing yourself at this point. stop posting
---
Oh that looks familiar..... [Dead Moros](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78493940/)

300m is easily a full bay of fighters, t1 capital mods, t1 rigs and t2 subcap mods
---
YOU SUCK
---
People dont want the fight. Should be obvious.
---
You can casually mine in high sec if that’s what you want to do.
---
They also give practically no isk at all, mostly. A bit salty after several stealth nerfs a couple years ago. Even if I move the probes as fast as I can, identify site type in 2 cycles and get 100% scan after 3, use triple nano hacking frigate, the isk/hr is no match for combat sites even on the best days.
---
Yes, because in the clusterfuck that is C5 Heavy armor brawls you can consistently keep within optimal range of triage, outside the range of Vindis (or Vigilants which can easily go 2k/s heated, even with plates and rigs) and not get caught by any enemy support (Scram Prots, HICs, etc).
---
As I said, there’s a good reason WH groups are still using Drekas over Ikis. And it’s not an ISK reason.
---
I don't want to join a nullsec bloc though. Is it really good game design if joining a big bloc makes owning a super infinitely easier than if you were to be a smaller, independent corp?
---
This was to expect, when you had some knowledge and watched the RnK Videos "Message in a bottle" &amp; "1st light on the 5th day".
---
LM went to Serenity, teaching Fulcrum and his PIBC-Blob the Pipebomb (Message in a bottle). As Serenity is dead and they moved to TQ, this is logical, as it is a quite low skillpoint barrier to this (except bridge Titan). You can bet that the mandatory skillplan for all Mango Members since there move to TQ started with pipebomb-Rokhs. Also I am quite sure the ex-RnK-Char is an alt of LM.
---
Did you do all that with a Stratios? What's the fit you used?
---
From a post in one of those threads (from 2011)
---
&gt;This was still in an era where physical people would rat not bots, so you could get the drop on them. 
---
EVE never changes.
---
Provided you don’t get blown up by someone who hates people that do PvE and attacks them every chance he gets. Speaking from experience here.😒
---
I am aware of that. What I'm saying is that I think he either did not loot some of them or didn't include them in the screenshot. Another option is that some of the A-Types came out of 3/10 where you could arguably just skip the overseers effects.
---
dont be bad?

May I suggest insider trading? Get rich in 1-2 days with the right info from the right person.

Imagine if this was real life. Imagine if you asked a ''stupid'' question and you got the response you just gave him.
---
You would have been considered the biggest asshole on earth.
---
Something like a Capsuleer security status... number of citadels and active players over time actually raises the status thus reducing the threat of PvE elements and reducing the concentration of the rarer materials. It eventually becomes low sec sans Concord. Imagine the salt from having your own infrastructure reducing your profitability.
---
We have no standards anyway so why not.
---
Luckily this is a forum about a video game wherein all PvE has been solved, and tons of guides in both text and video format exist and only require the minimum amount of effort to find.

Sounds good, ill throw an app in later tonight.

---
GOTG IS ONLY ALIVE BECAUSE OF TIME ZONE TANKING
---
Fraternity Treasury
---
T1 rigs are around 150m alone. You need around 5-8 cap mods and which cost around 20-50m each. Youre budget is already broken. 
---
So again, yes you dont technically need anything on a cap but for defense fleets most are actually much more expensive than 300m. Not to mention HAW dread fits are in the range of billions and not millions.
---
CCP really fucked up when they introduced rorquals. They made 400mil/hr on normal gneiss rocks. They could tanks 35, 35! fucking carriers worth of dmg at full tank and had 7 minutes of panic. Also they could be immune to most cap warfare through passive tank and triple or double ancil. 
---
The nerfs were was too little way too slow. I think rorquals are still a little op with the 6min panic and 20-45k dps tank (normal range). Would take either another min off panic or another 10% of tank to put them in a somewhat balanced spot.
---
I’m ratting and doing missions until something more involved coalesces.
---
From what i understood you got stuck trying to save someone else but you were eventually rescued. Sounds like that scene from Star trek where Kirk exposes himself to radiation to save the ship  (kinda like it i guess). I LOVE THAT. CAN'T WAIT TO EXPERIENCE SUCH ASS CLENCHING MOMENTS
---
Good to know :)
---
Sounds fun! Thank you for the info and the videos!
---
Alright you have been given a gaggle of answers. but so far none of them have been helpful at all.
---
So first thing first you should go out there and ask your corp, ask your friends and ask everyone you got a contact to. They will have answers that will suit your current location a lot better than the general answers you will get here.
---
So my  horrendously basic answers is the following that you got 2 somewhat easy things you might not have thought about.
---
Both of them starts with a probe scanner.
---
You can use a probe scanning ship to scan down relic/data sites or look for the more lucrative DED sites. These sites can reward high loot but you must be willing to jump gates and search a bit to find them.
---
That being said you should really ask your corp for ideas aswell as fits.
---
That's a mute point
---
I don't see the other post you're referring to.  Maybe he deleted his post?  
---
Anyway, this is great info!  I happen to know the fit of the cynanbal I'm against, and it has 0 tank, so I should be golden if I can get within 9km of him to scram.  I'll see if I can make a Hecate fit that goes to 800!  Thanks again!
---
I think they were also floating the idea of an anchorable like tombstone or something. Can't remember where I saw that though. Maybe hoboleaks.
---
easier said than done when they're chain booshing
---
Funny how you barely mention snuff who made up more than half of your fleet
---
He was in a Hecate, I had a Myrmidon fit with artillery. It was basically the worst matchup possible for me.
---
Thing is, it’s not him blowing me up that grinds my gears, it’s the shitty r/gatekeeping attitude he had about it; like the idea of someone doing PvE offended him on a personal level. That’s like being offended that other players do exploration, industry, or roleplaying. It’s absurd.
---
send me your isk and i'll double it
---
LOL at the no counterplay. 
---
There are groups actively counterplaying excav bombing somewhat successfully. Goons are not one of those groups. (Hint) Maybe it involves using something other than a super/titan and rorqual.
---
ThAnK yOu BlAcKoUt
---
what did u learn?
---
As long as i get everything free i don't  mind and yea i took that ship with better speed since i felt more like exploring
---
"Join a nullsec group" is kind of the unspoken prerequisite there. If you aren't already corpmates with the ratter you're salvaging after, it will not only take you forever to get out there, but you'll get violently dunked by twenty Titans once you do.
---
After posts like this one no wonder CCP implemented Agency aka spoonfeeding feature for some *really strange players.*
---
&gt; bring out my rorqual  
---
Why not casual belt ratting with a titan?
---
corpii is from 3/10 yes, corpum are from 6/10
---
My point is that you are acting like a jerk. Your ''justification'' does not matter.
---
It's certainly an adventure to say the least.  Medic-types get paid good money.  If you're still youngish by the time you get out look in to protective services.
---
4/4 RR shacks are perfectly fine.    runs a Garrison in about 20 to 25 minutes and is completely cap stable.     you can replace one the batteries for a Target painter to clear the Frigs much faster.

---
Ummm...  that is exactly what they did.  They made it so you can/could/should? use some other ship.  Super-safe super-ratting grew out of all the things they put in place.  That was probably not the intended effect.  So they are changing it.  
---
Or perhaps it was the intended effect, but a few years later they decided to change it. Either way it is their game.  It might be the right reason or the wrong one.  It might make for a supre game that is less successful or a shitty game that is more successful.

 Either way it is not our choice.  They get to pick.  We as players are free to like or not like and play or not play.

---
Are you just mad your excavs got bombed?
---
I agree that it's ccp issue (remember : blame the game not the player)
---
But I don't think a staged arena (like bg in classic mmo like wow) would be the best idea because it would be against the concept of this sandbox game imo.
---
I think there should be random event that will magnet people with pvp ship for small/medium awards, creating battles everywhere.
---
In another hand I think hunting pve player is a good thing but I would love to see those players "defended" by other players that are paid for that job. 
---
Today I only see players defended by cyno which is unfair for me OR players not defended at all which is unfair for them. There is nothing between. 
---
Imo hunting should be even easier but the reward for crabbing or mining in null also much more lucrative so there would be a good risk/reward balance and a lot of fights
---
Hard to trust people after i heard about that story where the "judge" screwed over his corp after plotting the plan with another corp whom he met online. Forgot the names
---
I’m considering trying the game as well, I want to really put in the effort to learn. What I want out of the game is a mining career and trading. 
---
My problem is when I started this game when I was younger I was really just lost...I had no idea what to do and how to do it.
---
But I want to get it down so bad...that I might suffer through the pain...I also hear about finding a Corp but idk how I go about doing this
---
Why
---
It's the home system. It's pretty absurd that Goons don't take defending it seriously. It irked me a great deal.
---
&gt; Why can't you rat in your PvP fit?
---
It's a fucking waste of time. 
---
Also I wasn't talking about ratting in a pvp ship. I was talking about using it as bait. We are talking about nullsec. The NPCs actually do damage there, especially if you don't fit resists specifically for them. And the gankers are not solo-pvpers but 90% of the time small bomber or t3c gangs. 
---
Kudos to your friend, who managed to kill a couple of retards before blackout. The game has changed in the meantime.
---
First fight I've seen Mango win :o
---
And the small gangs are looking for easy ganks. 
---
Salt&gt;Good fight
---
If people want fights in subcaps they go find them. They don't get in a rorqual and sit in a belt.
---
Pretty sure goons would be happy if there was never another hostile in Delve again.
---
"good for the game" = "whatever i happen to do the most, no matter what effect it has on anybody else"
---
Then just merge into bigger organization.         
---
Like all changes CCP did over last 4 years constantly enforced this approach.           
---
At this point you can hardly say that this is not CCP    goal.
---
No one is shooting anyone if that happens. The ultimate green doughnut will occur.
---
Very few caches are empty. Shoot them from a distance so you can tell without getting close.
---
To increase your chances, you could either run electricals (cap recharge bonus) or equip a cap booster. Either would allow you to run an MWD much longer, giving you more speed to scoop up all the nodes.

In that case, iki will do much better purely because of ADC.
---
I personally run 2 Nestors and 1 Domi. Nestors for the RnR and Domi for the drifter bitch. Since it has the higher sig radius the drifter will always attack it. Not always at first but it will always switch to and stay on domi the entire time. And since the drifter will always attack the domi, the nestors are free to GTFO and micro jump out if trouble shows up.  
---
I might have to train up leshaks though and give them a try if they are really better. How to Leshaks do in C6 sites?

The poem is beautiful. The rattlesnake is dead.

When i say small groups i mean non sov holders.  If you own sov and intend to use your space, having an effective umbrella and response fleet system is the price of admission.
---
Those same guides point me to Mining and Running anoms in a super carrier, or are focused to brand new players who need to run lvl 1 missions to earn 1m/hr.
---
They also point towards station trading, which I already said dont work for me due to time investment.

If I could afford a titan do you think id be making a post asking for some advice?
---
I have a real question:  How long have you been playing the game?  I am not asking as an insult or to impugn an opinion, but for a reason.
---
The idea of normally achieving 100m/hr as something any braindead person should be able to do in relative safety is a pretty newish idea in the game.  Once upon a time the "huge" isk faucet people complained about was the 100-150 mil/hr you could get doing incursions.  A safe source of income was blitzing L4 missions (now considered chump change for the effort) with multiple mission pullers.  Then some rare nerd jumped in bragged about super-ratting ticks but that was when super pilots were rare, the super couldn't be docked, No alliance boasted more than a few dozen titans, and supers cost the equivalent of several years of game time.
---
Balancing IRL with game play has ALWAYS been an issue.  And people were frequently advised that for most players it was much easier/cheaper to pay IRL and work for the cash to do it.

Basically the interpretation I was hoping people would take from it, yeah.

Regular carrier ratting is super chill and you could easily watch a movie while doing it with no problem.

Super ratting is where it actually takes APM and if you get super optimized you have to pay attention.

Never even attempted to run relic/data sites and ded.

What exactly may nullsec be? Yet to complete the tutorial. Is it one of the four races in the start cause i choose gallente
---
I have a better idea! 
---
Remove all ships!
---
Since 2012, but with very long breaks in between. In 2012 FW mission running was already clocking around 250-300, and C5 wormholes were always around the 1B/hour mark with 2 dreads and vindicator/Loki.
---
Level5s is lowsec, the biggest zero risk income in the game, unless your carrier gets stuck inside a collidble object model. Oops did I fuck up the r/eve narrative, I meant to say, there's nothing to see in lowsec honestly, a definitely not \~elite hunters\~ farming their ass off on L5 alts for years without dying, no siree.
---
There used to be a joke about nuclear hand grenades (this was back during the Cold War when nuclear versions of all kinds of things were being built). The punchline was that it kills everything within 100 yards. Because a good grenade throw is 30 yards.
---
We can figure that out together if you want
---
Whats the point of dropping on retarded nano shit and bombers that are virtually 100% impossible to catch no matter what.
---
Does this mean I can copy/paste messages with system names now?
---
No local in null, so if you're cloaked why do you need a nuet alt?
---
Not sure it s in rage.
---
Me it s not in rage, it s just that the content is lower than before because we have lost a lot of activity IG.
---
I’ve been following EVE for about a decade at this point, I knew what I was getting into when I started playing. Having my ship blown up is *annoying*, sure, but that’s something I can handle. That player’s attitude pissed me off because it basically amounted to *“Stop enjoying what I don’t enjoy!!1!”*, and that’s just being a shitty person.
---
You want to be a pirate? Fine, that’s legit gameplay. But don’t tell me I’m not allowed to have fun.
---
Thanks but I like to be able to run eve on my own schedule.
---
Another winner wins Eve at last.
---
GGWP.
---
Maybe CCP should not allow the Boson to be fired if a gate is within a certain range.
---
That hadn’t occurred to me, actually. I’ll think about it.
---
That actually sounds very nice...however I won’t be jumping in until I get internet at my home. Just moved into a new construction home. They’ve laid the fiber wires down just haven’t plugged them in....I would Sacrifice a goat for some internet 
---
But I’ll def join you :-)
---
Rest in Piece
---
Sell the rorq , buy a bling gila run abys
---
No, link is not included in the copied formatting. If I copy a clickable system name and them paste it again it does not work in chat.
---
Bro, that sounds awesome! Does working for the Amarr navy increase my rep with Amarr? Or just the Navy part of the empire?
---
what did you expect? a detailed list of every single comment a blocmember ever made about people not coming and fighting them?
---
imagine getting dunked on by mangos
---
....Okay.
---
I didn't know having friends meant you had to warp your schedule to fit them.
---
Most people find friends with similar schedules.
---
Just like in real life.
---
And? It's the same everywhere. You don't rat and mine in your home system, therefore there's no need for it to be 'safe'
---
You can afford a rorqual so doesn’t look like your too short on isk sell it if you don’t use it will have a bunch of isks
---
Never write software just because it sounds interesting. You cannot stay motivated to keep building it past the first day or two because you'll always know that nobody is gonna use this ever so why even bother.
---
You should play the game a bit, check out what endpoints are available and solve a problem you have in the game. Make software that's useful for yourself and then share it if you feel like someone else might find it useful.
---
*The logs show nothing*
---
I think certainly there are some like you, but most quitting are in varying degrees of rage
---
I think most of us are content with being left the hell alone. Wormholes are much more complicated than the average nullsec line member can comprehend, and I think most of us believe it’s too complicated for CCP to adequately balance.
---
Apparently it was.
---

---
Porpoise is 90% of an orcas function at 10% of the cost
---
what? copy text with formatting !   
---
*i'm gettin wet, it should boost the NPE and may help to keep old players*
---
They first have to inject more, mind that most of them came to TQ in 2019 and have no SP.
---
That works, my point is that it should be the default since sometimes ever second counts and this "copy with formatting" option **really** slows things down
---
Play stupid, die stupid.
---
This is strictly for an in-cyno for saving rorqs/ratting supers and titans. Its not meant to be mobile :D
---
In their mind, they are the noble eve bushido warriors doing YOU a favour by 10v1ing myrmidons in kikis and running away at the first sign of a pvp ship.
---
You should be thankful for their brave sacrifice to bring you content.
---
More likely from the dedicated cyno-rep mino that jumps in immediately but i see your point :D
---
Gid gud retard
---
Do some exploration (relic sites only) and you could make 500mil in 2/3 hours if your luck aint to bad
---
Because goons and tapi are cucks
---
I use evanova sometimes, but I really wish they updated the official app, it could have been great.
---
Idk about TAPI, but as a former goon, I can say they would be quite happy if no one showed up in their space. They drop caps to serve two purposes: 
---
Firstly, to keep people away from their space. So their crabs can crab in peace and isk can be made. They are trying to keep their space safe for their members. So they will show full force to show that others aren't welcome.
---
Secondly, it gives their members the chance to use their big toys, and experience in caps. Dropping on an AF gang is better experience than it just  rotting in a station. 
---
I don't blame goons for trying to keep their space safe, as well as dropping caps as much as they do. I mean I won't go roam their now, cause I know whats coming. Its kinda common knowledge for certain groups, this is what you get when in their space.
---
If you see implying it's so frequent you should be able to easily come up with a couple examples. Otherwise it's just your world because I haven't seen it as a constant thing. You may notice in this very thread most people are saying, no we don't want you to come fight us and using oppressive force is our way of telling you to fuck off.
---
Hi have you met eve nerds ?
---
Doing FW game mechanics (capturing plexes, running FW missions, killing FW wartargets) will raise your standings with the Amarr Empire (and to a lesser extent the Caldari State) while throwing those with the Minmatar Republic and the Gallente Federation into the shitter.
---
It’s safe as fuck to move titans and supers through null anyways lol. In a big bloc or not.
---
Try adding local scamming to your station trading regimen, it's pretty easy/afk. 
---
You can also look up "cycle trading" and start getting into more than just .01 games. (Remember, if a bot can do everything you can do better, you're playing the wrong game; you have to get smart/creative to make real isk in any field.) Your playtime/schedule lends itself to mid-term investments, where you spend 20 minutes playing and then come back next week to cash out the rewards. 
---
L3 or L4 abyssals might also be your thing.
---
i don’t think ~true goons~ even complain but since GSF is +80% pubbie trash there’s bound to be those who complain about content
---
What?
---
Good luck! Let me know if you want me to just toss you one from pyfa, I have a bunch lying around.
---
Setting up drops for a 5% chance to get a 20 million isk killmail, oh boy such fun engaging gameplay.
---
Of course we do it the hammer way. That way they get encouraged to go elsewhere.
---
Oh he wasn't complaining about not having content, he was complain that the elite pvp roamers don't want to fight anything that fights back.
---
Explo in Sansha is amazing, also I recently moved to wormhole space and huffing gas in a cheap venture is pretty good ISK too, I’ve made like 200mil in a few days of logging in, killing the rats, which can be done in a cruiser for lower class holes, then playing overwatch for the time it takes to empty the site. Haven’t died yet, and even if I do, it’s only like a 5 mil ship.
---
Fortnite is there for you.

**EvErYTHInG On THE DoMI! eVERYTHInG ON THe DOmI! EVeRYThING oN THE DOMI!!!**
---
Nope, Serenity folks a lot of them are totally clueless on TQ. They might be decent F1 line members but at least in lowsec you see all sort of shit. Remote rep rigs on local active tank AFs type of bad.
---
Even with the buffs, nullsec is still safer and more lucrative than anywhere else in the game.  Blackout was good, everyone crying about it is a carebear who wants perfect safety, and I'm a bittervet former WH PvPer who loves it all.  Come at me.
---
Then it still wouldn't be what happen says is happening. That would be the devs upset people aren't roaming null because they get dunked by caps, not the people who live there.
---
its kinda fascinating what well made videos do to the image of some groups, regardless of what really happened
---
its not about the isk, its about sending a message
---
I wonder why
---
I mine in peas.   
---
I rat in peas.  
---
BRB. Gotta log in real quick to rename all my ships:  
---
Peas porridge hot.  
---
Peas porridge cold.    
---
Peas porridge in the pot why the crap doesn't this fit in 20 f*ing characters?
---
This am curious about.
---
In comparison to carrier rating is this an equal. I only ever did the level 1s found it pot luck what you got.  Also what filaments would you run I've only done the darks. Just curious Before I invest in a blinged out gila.
---
Because they are cowards and only want to fight things that don't fight back.
---
There are several other avenues to different wealth.
---
Start up a market alt and station trade (once you get enough on the market, this can be very lucrative). 
---
Abyssals can be very lucrative and t3's are relatively safe and easy. Also with your time constants, these would fit perfect. 
---
DED sites and exploration are other options. 
---
I am assuming your in null sec, however since my friend and I moved to low sec, my friend has made more isk just clone soldier hunting and killing faction spawns, than he ever did in null sec. 
---
Really just depends what your interested in and want to do.
---
Literally nothing in this post is true.
---
You are a very angry man. Just take a step back, breathe and realize you aren’t shit. 
---
I am guessing from your comments you like all these updates. Which is fine. They have buffed certain playstyles and made them more fun. That doesn’t mean that they have made playing shit for many many others. 
---
And great that you found a video of a small gang fighting, congrats. Want me to send you hours and hours of comm chats as we try and get small gangs to engage and hey continually run away and harrass only easy targets? Cause jump on comms with any null entity and I promise you for every one fight that is taken there will be 50 they run from. 
---
You aren’t elite pvpers cause you bring kiting nano shit into some else’s space and kill pvers. You are promoting the exact same type of gameplay you lose your shot over when you face something you can’t kill.
---
So if you live by adapt or die I expect you have Never ever raged about getting dropped by multiple supers? 
---
Cause you haven’t earned shit, they have put the isk on the line for their ships, their structures, there ratters, so STFU with you shitty little gang of “elite pvpers”
---
The whole point of dropping silly numbers of caps on you is to send a clear signal to fuck off, not to create engaging content.
---
but is it?
---
Like this guy? https://zkillboard.com/kill/78497785/
---
Except I posted 6 nerfs nullsec income received and 0 buffs in that same time frame. So the reality is that it has been constantly nerfed but people refuse to accept that.
---
If you want, share your fit please 😊
---
While this is true, I recently ran the numbers on Orca vs Rorq vs Barges with various boosts (max rorq boosts vs imperfect rorq boosts vs max orca boosts vs imperfect rorq boosts) and it made me never want to touch an Orca/Porp again.
---
With Excavators and perfect, Rorq obviously outmines everything else by over 100%. A perfect Rorq edges out above two perfect boosted Hulks. Roughly 500km3/hour. 
---
Downgrade to 'Augmented' Mining Drones and the Rorq loses over half of it's effectiveness, and with perfect skills pulls 300km3/hour. Roughly equivalent to 1 perfect Rorqual boosted Hulk.
---
However, how does this compare to an Orca using 'Augmented' Drones? The Orca pulls 100km3/hour with perfect skills. Three times worse than the Rorqual without Excavors, five times worse than the Rorqual with Excavators.
---
The Hulks with Perfect Rorqual boost are about 310km3/hour. Downgrade the boosts to Perfect Orca boosts and the Hulks drop to 210k/m3 hour. 
---
TLDR even without Excavators Rorqs+Barges are about 200% more effective than an Orca+the same Barges.
---
Another wonderful bug that's now a feature.
---
C4 space never used to have any wandering outbound holes until frigate holes where introduced and CCP probably forgot to exclude them.
---
Maybe he was rp'ing?
---
This is not good advice.  It's this kind of thinking that gets me tons of kills.
---
Local nerfs continue, until morale improves.
---
When I used to roam around doing that shit we didn’t come to dunk on people who couldn’t fight back, we did that because that’s all that was available. No one wants an actual fight and we wanted some kills so that’s what we did. Everyone in my Corp would have gladly traded 100 trash miner kills for one decent sub cap fight lmfao.
---
dae spodbrains am i right guys????
---
edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger
---
it's r/jita
---
Please define "real PvP" for me.  I'm pretty sure everybody I kill in highsec has a much bigger, more powerful ship, meaning I need to have superior skill to survive the engagement.  I also never start the fight, so I am guaranteed to suffer at least one unanswered shot.  Walk me through your thinking...
---
Not wrong
---
Minmatar and Gallente are lesser peoples. They lack faith.
---
Serenity folks - which ones, there were some 10k also? Sure there are lot of scrubs in Lowsec, but there were already scrubs before Serenity people joined. I spoke of the people leading Serenitys biggest and most successful alliance or being a longterm member of it.

You are not supposed to play alone in null.

Also, I AM a bittervet former WH PvPer, and I DO love blackout.  So those are both true.  So you're "literally" wrong.

I looked at Thanatos/nid kills for the last 2 days and barely got half way down the list. 
---
They all have less than 30 people on them. 
---
Some of them are probably worth more than the carrier yes. But it shows that they aren’t this big scary thing people make them out to be.
---
I see you have not done besieged covert labs... Dessapointing!
---
Yeah!  If you have one, that'd be great!
---
You have friends in RL too?! 😜 What is your secret?
---
Lol the most popular roaming destinations for most active small gang corps is horde, delve and brave. Those guys blob super hard but that's what makes it fun. You have to be on your toes. No one in my corp does pvp just to get easy kills, it's always been about the fun of getting a challenging kill and coordinating in a way that allows your small group to beat bigger blobs. We kill ratters and miners all the time but usually it's to get a response. We will hold grid with caps as long as the dps isnt overwhelming but when capitals can have application fighters and alpha that can wipe many cruisers off the field instantly there is no reason to bring sub caps. If there is nothing we can feasibly kill on grid we will leave. To call small gangs risk adverse is silly. I'm sure there are some risk adverse groups out there but most people who are skilled in pvp dont want to be in a group where that skill isnt tested and improved.
---
increase  player felay in tidi fights for moar chaos!!!
---
Shoutout to the Russians in c6 Red Giants making that much with smartbombing rorquals
---
That’s cause you have literally come into someone’s space that they have dedicated a lot of time and effort into building and are killing there pve characters..... what do you want from them? Go Entosis a node and you will get a few people that want to fight come and defend. Try and shit on the isk making characters and you will get shit on
---
I really wonder how the fiend is gonna die at this point
---
afk on a gate to rats? lmao
---
As long as it could deliver the job, it is OK to lose one of them.
---
The point of an orca is just to run boosts and serve as a drop of point. They're not supposed to mine solo. My Corp has a WH with a few moons we crack. One porp sits there with it's mining drones passing out boosts to the entire fleet.
---
FUCK THOSE SCRUBS GIVING ME SHIT OVER COMBAT ANOMALIES DURING THE WEEKEND!!!!
---
OF COURSE I WILL CONTEST YOU, ITS FUCKING WEEKEND!!! WE DONT HAVE ANOMALIES ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE, AND YOU CAN BE DARN SURE I WILL BE RUSHING THAT LOOT!! MOTHER FUC****!!!
---
You're dumb.
---
They shouldn't be so easy to generate. carriers now feel like t2 cruisers used to in terms of availability.
---
Yeah I'd guess I average 400-500m an hour on a good day with 1 hyper carrier staying in 1 system and declining everything but the best
---
I could have played safer and kept my distance to the rattlesnake but was greedy and went in closer with higher damage ammo at the end. He was in low hull when I popped and had less than 5 seconds to live at most.
---
tldr comments: yay another player leaving eve, -1 target woooooo
---
Can confirm regular strat can run 5/10 (scannable/excalations from Dens). You want to headshot the final boss and gtfo. I usually fit autocannons for the last room so I can blap and get out.  
---
 I've only run a few 6/10 in the Stratios with a few warp-outs to recover, but sentry drones seemed to work best. Suggest T2  sentries, not faction, as losing a couple is not uncommon.
---
I’ve set up dread bombs on supers, cloaked ded site runners, set up gate camps. Waited hours for carriers in blops I know the feeling well. 
---
It doesn’t change the fact you are trying to shit on the pve players and expecting a response other than get the F off out of our income.
---
Hoping to join ya soon m8. May i dm you my discord tag?
---
This is the correct answer. I mean the large null blocs newbie groups have things they can offer and arent bad, however the one thing that will always be the key to this game is relationships. Finding a nice tight group of corp mates, can help you much more and you might build lasting friendships in this game this way. There are always smaller groups in all areas of the game who will help out newbies.
---
Eh most of my experiences with people has been nice. 
---
Cant really help with ded sites as that is not my forte but if you need advice/help with scanning/hacking or fits for that i can give you quite a lot of information.

---
Sure! I’ll gladly add you!
---
The ultimate in tackle shouldnt be cynoing in caps. Matter of opinion.
---
Lame attempt to 'be with the peasants'.
---
Yeah that is definitely long enough, combined with participating on the other side of matters, to understand the new meta. Nothing has changed; clever ratters prosper.
---
If you’re under the impression that new members can’t contribute in that WH group in anything much better than a gas venture then I sincerely hope that’s not what they tell you guys.
---
Are you not able to activate your ADC and burn out of range with a Muninn? Or is more the lag fest from landing in all that shit keeps you from activating or doing much of anything til it’s too late?
---
I’m glad to be playing a game with some awesome people.
---
Then you can’t small gang hunt with supers, look at flightleader’s stuff, it’s brilliant but won’t be possible after the changes
---
We miss you, but I hope the break is doing some good, you did seem a little on edge just before.
---
I've noticed COSMOS sites on my overview. Can these sites be farmed for bounty &amp; salvage or not really? Do the rats inside them respawn quickly?
---
you shpuld try burner missions. if you have alts even better as you need to complete them in a small gang , 4 is optimal
---
Lack of rorq access is a problem with an azbel shaped solution
---
Where are your fighter support units? Network sensor array? fuel? Capital neues? The fighters them fucking selves? You can’t link an absolute shit fit and say “see fittings are cheap”
---
haha
---
Are you implying that an azbel can be used to circumvent wormhole sizes?
---
mad snuff blob boi who cant get free kills under super umbrella
---
Perhaps you could take a swing at producing an AAR for them (no bias included)?
---
This sentence looks like it has a lot of words and letters that may be English.
---
&gt; AOM just RnK'd an Elo Muninn fleet.
---
I was nowhere near the fight I just clicked the BR and looked at a few kills
---
So broke functionality and didn't add a new one
---
Ahh, see, you misunderstood me. I pointed out that the so called elite PvPers won't engage anyone that isn't a PvE ship. That isn't complaining that they won't fight. I'm just calling them pussies. I chase them out. Which is what I stated here. Apologies if you are too stupid to understand.
---
oh yeah i not saying its bad, just wounding if you could build its tank enough to service the  battle ship's smart bombs
---
By your metric Horde would be a bigger reddit corp than both.
---
Don’t think the person saying “just feed two leshaks to a site” has actually tried it. I’d be interested to see a duo leshak fit that can run anything but maybe the lowest dps site and even then..
---
Inbetween you finishing your warp and being able to activate your mods there is a time where you cant be locked by weapons or logi but can still recieve smart bomb damage. Thats when the majority of the damage is done. 
---
Expect to see this patched out once Elo and Olmeca begin complaining about it on r/eve.
---
&gt; Fraternity Treasury
---
Beat me to it. Though I think the devs try to pull from a cross-section as to not look like they're picking on anyone.
---
&gt; One porp sits there with it's mining drones passing out boosts to the entire fleet
---
My point was that an Rorq boosts are 100% better than Orca boosts. By having a Rorq doing the boosting your max yield Hulks are ~310k, by having an Orca the max yield is ~210k.
---
A rokh with 700k EX ehp could die, I won't try to squeeze the poor recons. XDXD
---
Alex vs. his identity.
---
Youre right everyone should follow your lead and sit on their own killing NPCs or rocks, truly the height of enjoyable emergent gameplay
---
Oh yeah duh
---
Keeping the dic a secret is a bit easier now thanks to Black Out
---
The RnK videos are the reason why im playing eve! I wanna be part of one someday.
---
Seriously? You're telling the dude not to learn because nobody will ever use it?
---
That's a shitty attitude. If the dude wants to code, then he should code.
---
ah ok so just enough tank then to get people on field then
---
The salt deposits in Tribute seems massive :D
---
Ah, so his BR and how events could indeed be accurate and your commentary was based in a superficial glance at a BR? Got it. Thanks.
---
I am going to assume you are in null.  If i was you, id find a dead end system your alliance owns, id have an alt cloaked in the gate, listening for someone to jump in, and be aligned to warp as soon as someone pops in that is not blue.  You can mine fine if you use vigilance, its how i mine in a wh.  The only other issue you will have is someone well see your rorq and could log off and wait to try and catch you.  Sadly mining in a roq is a huge bloody target on your back, with no support.. not much you can do,
---
Exploration pays well, but I'd advise you drop a char or 2 into their own low class shattered wormholes and log onto then every day or every other day and scan back to hs to drop off goods and then head back. I do this with 3 different chars every once in a while and net 200-400mil while only leaving them in their respective wormholes.
---
DED can pay quite well too. I prefer to run LS DED and LS escalations, which some finish in NS. If you are part of an NS umbrella then find where DED sites spawn at a spot that not too many of your people are running them and run them there. A T3C is the most flexible, I think tengu is still the best for DED, but carriers get used for NS DED sometimes.
---
&gt;to fund my other activities in the game.
---
What are those? Like what kind of isk do you need to be making to fund those other activities?
---
Delet c4
---
That's mostly just Reddit. Most of us in game are ruthless murderers but will treat your corpse with care.
---
You must be one of those people that are too lazy to scan or you just suck at. I would be happy having the spawn timer reduced.
---
Except now with no local, there is no cyno necessarily required. You could have your 15 smartbombing Rokhs and the Sabre already cloaked in position on the hostile fleet's path for hours and they'd never know you were there. Now is actually a better time than any other to be pipe bombing.
---
Chaos Era continues: Timers are now random, get fucked 🙌
---
Same here... I am playing less then 10h a week because of Real life stuff like children etc...
---
Since I can't undock a carrier without a massive risk to loosing it and the upcoming cyno changes it is really difficult.
---
I used to do 2 or 3 heaven per day and bought pvp stuff from the Isk I earned.
---
Yes... There are tons of activities out there but nothing with what I can afford good (alliance doctrine) ships without spending a: real money for new accounts or b: billions on (for example) a good abyssal ship + implants.
---
The best thing I could do is mining in HS, incursions or doing lvl4 missions and fly with some npsi Fleets... But I really don't like the idea of moving back to HS...
---
... moot.
---
Yes, I want null sec gameplay to be more challenging. Not a wormholer, by the way. I live in Fountain.
---
fuel your cit maybe?
---
Depends. It's chill and the Triglavian recons are valuable for highsec.
---
The cynos can be blops tank fitted with a couple of smartbombs themselves. Win win!
---
&gt;oh shit he got me, quick think up an excuse and call people names to distract, that always works
---
I agree but let's not get into the pacifics
---
Or it was intended? It’s a frig NS hole lol. It’s not like it’s various frig holes to all sections of space
---
It all depends on what you set your vulnerability time to. That is the time it is vulnerable.
---
Living with 2 statics isn’t actually that enjoyable tbh, regardless of the “double statics double the content” screeching
---
well it would defeat the point off the pipe bomb being kinda cheep for what it can do.

Out of curiosity, why did you guys go with explosive smartbombs?  Minmatar T2 ships pretty universally have big kinetic holes and conversely, the Falcon has a nice big kinetic resist and the most tank out of the recons.  I think with heat, links and gimmick tanking the Falcon for full kin damage, you can allow to at least survive the friendly smartbombs.
---
I enjoy pirate (C3 and under wormholes as well as normal space) relic/data sites. Always a risk moving around wormholes, and the payout can be huge, or nothing. I found a wormhole with like 14 sites, and made 400m in about 2 hours. I've also gone hours finding only a few sites, or blown up cans worth 40m, or died and lost ~100m because I misclicked on an ore rock instead of where I wanted to warp to...
---
For only a few hours a week, its a great way to explore, and actively play.
---
Incursions are much better isk/hour, but you probably want a few hours at a time to do them, and you need a few hundred million isk invested. But they're great isk for people like me with &lt;15m sp, and they're safe, consistent, and a good way to just kind of hang out and chill on comms. Easy to get into as well.
---
If you enjoy industry-type stuff, you can try PI too. I enjoy the mix. I can either just reset it daily, or I can try and play around with it more and move things, re-balance things, etc. more for better income. Either way, its consistent good isk with little time commitment once setup. I have all 3 characters on my omega account doing it, and it takes &lt;10 minutes/day (you can also set it to reset every 3 days, you'll just get less from it) plus an hour or so to haul everything once a week.
---
Note, I live in a wormhole, so the gain is much lower in highsec. But I make ~150m-200m/week. However, corp taxes (no other tax, just PI) and paying to haul to Jita (T1 haulers are too risky, slow, and boring for me to want to haul) take a cut.
---
Wtf is pipe bombing
---
how this actually reads "ccp pls help me i tackle titan and downtime but don't have the resources to kill it, not my fault though its game mechanics"
---
I'm aware, like I said a rorqual makes the orca redundant. I use orcas for WH logistics mostly now days.
---
Read it again. It's about motivation to reopen the project file after a day or two. If you don't have a real use case, there's nothing to drive you to finish it, it becomes a chore and is not fun. It's not a good way to try and learn something you hate/dislike.
---
Drifters appear on dscan lol.
---
40rokhs could deliver 96k per round.
---
Let's say you hit the ADC button before you get hit, that would give you roughly 170k ehp against Ex damage.
---
Two rounds of damage within 7s could easily kill you.
---
Smooth brain, just make it so new sigs don’t appear instantly. Give it a 1-5m delay. It’s basically the same thing since new sigs is our “local spike”
---
Can't ADC while in warp and you're dead before you exit warp
---
Only needed half their numbers to smartbomb em.... Seems inefficient to me.
---
Heck, you can get into WTM with ~200m. I just got into a vindi to start, since its so much better than what the other acceptable options are, and that only cost 600m. And I've made well over that in a day.
---
Plus the Concord LP is another ~25% on top of the isk payout per site. (31.5m/site isk, 7000 LP @1300 ea is ~40m/site).
---
Even TPPH walls when WTM is with a non-optimal comp (not enough combat caps for TCRCs or not enough leshaks/vindis to contest) are ~20 mins each. I've done chains of TCRCs about 10 mins so 6 an hour so yeah, the 100-240m/hour seems spot on.
---
ehhhh. I would disagree. I think Rattle's are a little more skill intensive then, Nestors. Both rattles and nestors you can fly on alpha accounts. Also price wise, Rattlse will cost more then the nestors.
---
How tricky are T3s to learn? I just ran about a half dozen T1s in some random Vexor fit and found them snoozefest easy and terrible ISK. Haven't tried T2 or T3 yet. Having trouble finding guides honestly.
---
I mean it’s basically confirmed and heavily tested. It doesn’t open, and if it’s warped to, it only starts polling yes/no after it hits a certain time remaining. 
---
Seeds are seeds, however.
---
You can always build a rorq inside the WH. That's what my corp has done.
---
They could. T2 resists can make them super tanky if you tank for a specific damage type.
---
Explosive smartbombs and a tank Pilgrim or Em smartbombs and a tanky rapier.
---
I completly agree with this dude, we roamed all day long yesterday and took all fights we could,90% of them we we're outnumbered and upshipped, but since the dudes im flying shit are not fkin dumb F1 monkeys and actually know how to pilot, we killed everything that standed in our path without losing a single ship. Learn to fly your ship and not just lit a cyno on a scrammed target, and then we can maybe talk.   
---
'bou hou i can drop my super op ship on a scrammed myrm with my bait procurer......' Pathetic.  
---
Yay!
---
How, exactly, did you "get me"? Your idiocy knows no bounds I guess.
---
Can you provide more information? bug ticket number? I am pretty sure any disruption to normal timer mechanics are a bug and not intended functionality. I can ask CCP if you can give me more to work with.
---
Move to lowsec
---
Ok ok, +1 for rocket surgery, I like it. Still there is a leap there. Rorqs are their own problem certainly, but adding minerals to the game isnt direct inflation. Ratting creates isk, so ratting nerfs fight inflation. Rorqs are a secondary element to this particular problem.
---
People are flying ''nano shit'' because every fucking time they tried to brawl, they got a cyno lit on them and dropped by a thousand super/dread. Things are about to change, ill gladly get back into wtv brawling ship.
---
Less than in many games. New players can skill into something specific relatively quickly and be effective in fights in that niche. 
---
But of course a lot of factors in winning a fight come from how well you manually pilot, knowing when to use what modules, when to overheat etc... So players with more experience of course have an advantage in know how. But equipment wise and game ability wise it’s flatter than many games.
---
Does that mean reducing the Titan V still train times to be similar to the subsystem V skills?
---
2D 12H is the minimum timer your citadel can have if its in low/null I believe. So sounds about right.
---
What you really said.
---
&gt; Stop pointing out my bias, I'm an angry dick on the Internet and don't point it out.
---
In other words, he has a pulse.
---
I think I only ever once lost a ship to bombers and that was a domi and I was flying with no scout...
---
no it was just me listening to Rise on the podcast and thinking what possible solutions might come...
---
as others have noted just increase mass and sig and it should be enough... so start off with that...
---
if things still don't settle down then move on to more drastic measures... we are dealing with chaos... so I was trying to be as chaotic with my approach as possible... but the fact that it triggered so many null sec guys should be reason enough for CCP to consider it.
---
if you have a c6 and don't have more than 1 nag, u dont deserve ur 6 and I hope u get evicted. If you're nomading, good for you, good luck.
---
Throw a faction medium remote rep in place of the drone link and it will tank whatever.
---
What other activities are you funding? Or was that a way of lying to try and get more answers?
---
For the most part. With good direction however, no for both isk making and pvp.
---
Stretching is stretching. Exercising is exercising. See the difference?

I could try that :)
---
only solution i found is restarting eve.. usually the bugs go away if you reload ship hud and what not but this is something more
---
this is the correct answer, also mjd bargs work too
---
Legit question: is there a defense to this? Assuming they have a spy in fleet, doesn't seem like the FC can do anything to prevent this.
---
Durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
I'm cool with this - hell make it 10 minutes.
---
EX could be used against almost all types of ships, since most zealots are AB fit. KN is very hard to apply to eagles, we tried it before ADC was out, and we failed on serenity.
---
So we just keep using EM or EX, but mostly EX.
---
OFC, Rokh looks awesome. 
---
But I will think about Falcon, thanks for the idea.
---
Does it have to be eve?   For programming and games I would suggest looking at a game called screeps.  I agree with another commenter that without a good reason to finish, just doing something to do something it will be quickly abandoned.  But then again, if you have more discipline then most, as suggested above, play the game and find a problem, look for an existing app that solves that, either improve on it, or if it does not exist, create it.

The point is there is real PvP compared to lame PvP. The same way you have real chess players and then just schmucks who try to play. It's called having a respected tier of quality and professionalism vs some asshat who doesn't know how to do anything. 
---
Sorry you think lumping all PvP as being real and respected into one category, but I don't. PvP covers a wide range. And real PvP is for the elite. Anything less diminishes what the true pvpers do every day and the skills they possess.
---
They are called shattered whs.
---
Looking for a cheap fit to clear our the sleeper rats in Ore/Ice/Gas Sig's in C1-C4s, no real combat sites, only reasource sites, so I can bring in some ventures after. Daytripping only. Curious about the *cheapest* fits that could work, I already have stuff like Drake and Tengu if I wanted to clear combat sites or overkill these resource sites.
---
Smart bombs will push it over probably
---
How do you know what OP does and does not find fun and rewarding?
---
Like 90% of the stuff I've coded I'm the only one who's ever used and maybe 25% never even worked.
---
I had plenty of fun.
---
Well before it was increasing my production of industry, PI, roaming ships in PvP that are destined to die since im crap at it. Padding for bad days when I lose a rorq or some other capital.
---
Each system has a security status.
---
It's easy to get overwhelmed with info. Jumping into lowsec or nullsec for the first time will display a warning. Advise: read popup warnings.
---
Second this. It's not a major conflict, but Vale/Tribute are currently a great spot for small-midsize conflict.
---
You can't balance around price. At least not with the current saturation of money in Eve. 
---
Look at null groups, supers, which are supposed to be a flagship, are now as common as any other ship.
---
Maybe 7 years ago you could make that argument
---
Many reasons. I am not going to retype the different reasons, simply go read the 2 threads on official forums on the subject.
---
I will simply add that CCP has many other things to work on and fix before even messing with null sec operations. For example, a new player friendly tutorial would be a good start
---
Yup, no titan needed.
---
So what's your ideal world in eve? You're proposing absolute safety in ratting which means no one needs to roam anymore as roamers can't accomplish any goals other than fighting other roamers, but since there is no reason to roam there won't be any other roamers to encounter.
---
So now you're ratting with impunity and accruing wealth for what? Perhaps more rorquals? ok, but to what end? Now you want to build an overwhelming capital armada to extend the boundaries of your sov... Ok why are you taking more sov? It's not because life gets easier with more territory... Oh, so you want to farm more? Ok, cool - it appears your prerogative is to acquire more wealth.  So eventually there will be no conflict and nothing to farm for.  Farming in eve isn't fun, it's not stimulating.  The value of farming as a trader or as a production person is because it's either: you want to supplement PVP or because you just want to see how well you can automate some farming activity.  For the former, that has been dying out and is having a small resurgence due to some of the chaos era.  For the latter, play a clicker game or find something in real life because the cost of doing it in eve is all other facets of gameplay.  
---
I've been saying it for weeks now, every time someone advocates for enjoying small gang roaming to gank farmers and skirmish with defense fleets the response is "Your pvp is killing my playstyle, you only want what you want to play!" which is a bullshit argument - you can farm even if people are hunting you, your efficiency just takes a small hit.  Secondly, you can reverse the argument to this: PVE players trying to exclude people looking for pvp are telling pvp players that they aren't allowed to pvp.  This is because pvp for the sake of pvp and pve for the sake of pve in this game are garbage nonsatisfying encounters.  Both activities are valued by their relationship to one another.
---
As a below poster says “Helldunk or blue balls.” True indeed, it's the death of the game in terms of searching for fun.  Eve/CCP in recent history have neutered contested resources which means there's little incentive for people to compete for anything which is why there is so little conflict. 
---
How does CCP solve these two things? For helldunking: making it harder/impossible to teleport overwhelming odds on enemies.  For undefended PVE operations? You're welcome to make an argument for how we should pity the lone defenseless miner but you'll get no sympathy from me, any ship with guns is adequate to kill such a ship. The real mistake they made was to not have someone defending them during their work - to be clear, what I'm saying is mining should be either an activity dedicated to standing fleets in the belt with them or so nearby that a fleet warping from the gate to belt would not arrive before defense would. 
---
For blueballing: blueballing only works because of asset safety.  Asset safety needs to die.  Right now losing "everything" means losing only what one has floating in space which pales hilariously in comparison to what assets are stored in stations.  POSes were better about this, but citadels could be the same.  If a citadel gets blown up (just like a citadel in WH) gets destroyed, your shit gets dropped - not magically teleported away.  It seems like this is on the timeline for chaos era in which case, god bless.
---
TL;DR - PVE cannot be allowed to be safe because without it being meaningfully threatened, there is no point to playing the game.  Helldunking in all cases kills content. Blueballs only work because assets are 100% safe.
---
Папа, кто не мой мотор!
---
And since local is gone, not just delayed, it makes sense to completely remove the k162 sigs, not just to delay them.
---
Stretching is exercise though.
---
It's an activity done to maintain fitness.
---
If i want to partake in whatever activity that requires friends, then yes it takes planning. Due to my schedule that isnt possible.
---
Join Horde
---
Because "hurr durr C4 corps suck" memes, of course. 
---
I've never quite understood that one.
---
Buy rig blueprints on contract like trimarks and cap rigs and just make buy the materials and sell the results easy 10 mill profit per run and you can have 10 runs going at a time.
---
They can scout in ways that minimize the risk of this, they can use tactical.
---
The bubble HAS to be up and in line with the warp before ships enter warp.
---
So if the scout is on the out gate, and the FC uses a pre aligned fleet warp, there would basically not be a chance to decloak the dic and bubble up.
---
Chinatown has some tricks up their sleeves.. nice.
---
Your schedule has you only playing when there are zero other people online?
---
Because someone will probably be online when you are.
---
Makes sense, I've just never done the math.  I was under the impression that pipe bombs only worked on lower EHP targets.
---
Real talk: that might actually be awesome.
---
Good!
---
march forth brave solider, free eve from the oppression of the nullseccer, the botter, the spodbrain, and god bless you.
---
indeed was this not also referred to as the poor mans doomsday... I think they person who first did it called it that or something... but this was the old dooms that was AOE and could kill a sub cap fleet in one go.
---
I don't get this sentiment at all.
---
So if someone already coded a thing you think would be cool to code, then you shouldn't code it to see if you could? Maybe learn something?
---
You don't \*have\* to always be trying to find the next killer app. Just code things, have fun with it, learn new things.
---
Not really. You just log on when you can and see what everyone else is doing. If there’s a timer coming out then you try to show up for it but if you are busy no one will care.
---
Uh... we already have drifters roaming systems in WHs. If you fail to kill it, it will warp off of the signature and roam around, warping and fucking up anything it finds.
---
If you don't include a /s everyone will assume you are serious and i never learn my lesson.
---
I am serious about caps being cancer tho. But i don't actually think that a cruiser should be able to solo one.
---
Using 12 catalysts to suicide gank some non-pvp fitted ship by pressing F1 and waiting is not real PvP.  It's on the lesser tier, lower level, bottom dwelling of the any PvP term. 
---
I rest my case. 
---
Call it what you want. I'll call it what I want. But don't get your panties bunched up because I think less of you. That's your problem to cope with. Not mine. If your feelings are hurt... deal with it and respect my opinion. I'll respect yours. 
---
That answer your question?
---
Well, they are trying to balance things out a bit. Daily login bonuses, they just buffed the bonus skill points from being referred, they made a $5 pack that gives you a million skillpoints, and they made frigate sized abyssal filaments you can run as a very new player as long as you’re in a Corp with people to run them with. 
---
Overall I’m not sure if the current meta is better or worse for new players than the old VNI meta, but it’s not as bad as it seems
---
Oh. You are correct. My mistake.
---
Why the fuck is Elo fining FC's in the first place? Actually pathetic.
---
Did you really checked all characters from that related?
---
scanning and running relic/data is fu hell boring shit and it advice only asshole mentality players ;-)
---
Well i cant say ratting or mining was exactly riveting lol.
---
I remember back when you had to fit your battleship with enough tank to survive the double doomsday
---
Your RF window has a 60 hour buffer before it, meaning that if anyone shoots your structure in that window it will come out the week after (9 day timer).  Anything greater than 60hrs and it will be rf'd for the same week (2.5 day timer)
---
not so big isk income, because navy LP store are pretty bad and transfer LP to liquid ISK at good rate is very long way
---
Generally, it’s not worth the effort to create a spy alt just to awox some new players. Sometimes people do it, but I was in Horde over a year and i only remember it happening a couple times. Mostly they use their spies to hotdrop our capital ships or freighters, but with the cyno nerf this will probably be less common, especially since Horde doesn’t live within jump range of npc stations anymore.
---
You realize the problem with your ideology though, right? As soon as everyone catches up to the logical conclusion of "perfect protection" there will be no content to be had, save for hugely escalated capital fights which stemmed solely from the desire to dunk a miner/ratter or from trying to take sov... which only serves to extend the space you have to rat/mine.  Unless there is more nuance to why and how we can play eve, we will continue to confine the scope of realistic options.
---
Furthermore, capital fights on the scale we're inching toward are boring, a burden, and excessively long.  This is why something must be done to create opportunities for ships like battleships and battlecruisers and destroyes and etc.  If you're thinking people are saying "Caps aren't allowed anymore" you're being ignorant - first of all, capitals have a disproportionate slice of the pie of content already. Second of all, just because there's an objective to increase the volume of opportunities for subcaps does not mean that caps become obsoleted.  There's plenty of space for all ships to have meaningful jobs.  The problem has been that cynos/jumping has been so powerful that it usurped the use of all other ships.  This is compounded by some other ridiculous implementation like fighter application to subcaps as well as HAWs.  Fighters at least are relatively easily killed, but HAW dreads are a crime against balance.
---
my dude if everyone in the game sat around killing rats and mining rocks, your isk and your minerals would be worthless and the resources themselves worthless. eve is a game where the enjoyment value comes from players interacting with each other. ask yourself - is there really any value in having the biggest dicks in this spaceship game, ready to drop anything on the smallest invader, so that your rorquals can mine in peace? do you really derive that much enjoyment from watching numbers in your wallet/ore hold slowly increase? do you really think this game isn't best when it encourages players to interact with each other?
---
Super ratting was still possible if you were under an umbrella. Now it’s pretty much the same but you need a recon alt.
---
You must really suck at the googles then because when I searched "How to make ISK in EVE Online 2019" I was given a video on running incursions, an hour long video on generic isk making things in sov nullsec (From the focus of a Brave Newbies pilot but applies anywhere), a video on exploration, and a short video on clone soldier tag farming in lowsec. I also got links to a few websites with text guides on, including the above stuff, PI and generic green anom ratting.

2. ~~See point one. It's just too hard for us to properly gank ratting noobs in battle cruisers because alliances defend their space.

Do you have a source on that testing? Because I’ve looked and haven’t found anywhere that can actually or even relatively confirm it.

It's an alternative method in a wide range of exercising. If your doctor told you to exercise more, I'm sure they didn't mean for you to stretch your hamstrings every day. LOL

If your corp says PvP is mandatory, I'm sure they don't mean for you to shoot a high sec can and run away.

Have I explained myself enough yet? Y'all seem to be just trolling me now. Or you're just bunch of lame pvpers afraid of real PvP. 😂 whatever you say won't justify what you do to me as real PvP. Perhaps that's something you need to work out yourself. If my opinion hurts your ego... so be it.

I didn't ask you to define my playstyle (you're wrong, by the way - I don't use Cats).  I asked you to define "real PvP" as you use the term.  You haven't done that.

Most well stated, if anything, we should be on our knees begging you for this amazing gift that gives eve meaning.

You're talking about going to classic which I assume means you think current WoW is shit.  (Which I agree to some extent ) so I would think you would want to go back to classic because they made retail a care-bear joke? Which is what it seems they're trying to do for Eve through drastic and new changes.  (Something Blizzard would NEVER do).  Seems kinda silly to unsub from a game that is trying to revert itself...to a game that did revert itself.
---
&gt;  Grinding shouldn't be an issue since i have played looter shooters but one last question
---
EVE is definitely *not* a looter shooter or anything close. It's not about the grind unless you want it to be. EVE is much, much more of a sandbox than any modern MMO/pseudo-MMO.

Do you see why that might be bad for the game though? If you designate mass swaths of space as "no fun zone" then what's the point of playing?  Why PVE if not to allow one to PVP?  Right now, there is no conflict driver in eve - players have been the conflict drivers, namely farmers.  In an ideal world we would see this:
---
Assemble for farming, to pay for losses/new fun guns/big project to expand opportunities
---
Bad guys show up to disrupt farming, good guys incur some losses
---
Good guys show up to help farmers, bad guys incur some losses and become farmers again.
---
That is the ideal cycle but it is fundamental that both sides incur losses.  If there isn't a real risk for either side to suffer loss then there is no incentive to play at all.
---
We see people having tangential conversations to this about how many mad ticks they can make doing x, y, or z.  Many of them are SO profitable that they can take on generous losses and still be tremendously in the green.  Adding those losses is good for the game as it gives people a reason to want to be the aggressor.  And I'm not saying that the aggressor has to go home without his lumps either.  It's not difficult to imagine a gang of 1-10 dudes getting into hostile space, killing a rattle and a couple VNIs (or myrms now I guess) and then on their way home, losing a couple of their guys to the defense fleet.  This is good for EVERYONE.  It feels bad temporarily to be the dead PVE player, but it gives you a reason to want to go kill who killed you.

You really haven't told me anything other than trying to insult me.  What is "real PvP?"  Does it require a fleet?  Does it have to be in null?  You brought that term up and now you don't want to discuss it.  I am genuinely curious how you define it.

If you'd asked me, I would humbly suggest that what I do takes a great deal of skill - I have to avoid being alpha'ed off the field by the first shot (which they always get to take); I have to spiral in and achieve tackle without dying or losing them; I have to get under their guns and kill off any drones without dying; I have to cycle my neuts and manage my cap.  I have to do all that in an assault frigate and yet I still manage a fair number of blingy kills against much larger ships.  Isn't that skillful?  If not, why not?
---
F .  A .   C .  T . S
---
&gt;You believe that any time someone tackles a capital, they should bubble up, the fc should split their fleet into two parts, one to stay inside the bubble, unable to warp, in a very vulnerable spot, potentially out of range of any logi they might have, just so they can decloak a recon that may or may not warp in cloaked
---
No, but you're going to refuse to understand you need to adapt until you lose a easy kills and watch someone else's youtube video that shows them decloaking the recon.  Hint: It doesn't take 50 ships.
---
It's interesting to see this progression. Such excotement over a few million, as I know I used to be.
---
Now I'm dealing in production chains handling billions or isk.
---
haha, that's great you were there.  Yeah, that's me.  He had a buddy in a Hurricane who just gave me the carebear-stare and probably could have given me a hard time - but he never fired.  The Drek pilot engaged me almost immediately upon landing on the field - he's a recent Hordeling, so I think he's maybe more aggressive than your usual highsec carebear.  I also managed to ransom him as well before the podding, and got a heaping bonus of salt after the fact.
---
Ah, this I can help with.

AOM == Army of Mango, newish alliance that has a lot of

that was almost exclusively Chinese players.

used here. Search "rooks and kings pipebomb" on youtube.

Elo == well known FC; you'll have to search for more info

Munnin: type of ship. Cruiser, I think. What's relevant is that it's

a smaller ship; a fleet of battleships would probably not be

vulnerable to this kind of attack.

A ham gnosis is your best option if you’re focused on being cheap

You want a compact space like Delve so that Goons aren't having to live in all of Delve and, say, Fountain and cloud ring\*, and thus directly brushing up against the small groups that are now trying to take ex-NC space.
---
If that kind of land-rush is happening on a bloc's border, they're gonna be in the land rush.  Or at least controlling who gets to rush.  If it can happen several regions away, then the blocs are much less likely to be involved.
---
\* (not that they actually would be in those particular regions because of issues with those particular regions, I just needed to stretch them in the problematic direction to talk about the issue.)

No, he called me a carebear and then explained that's what he called anyone who did PvE.

Howdy brand new bros caters to new players and teaching them the ropes. But feel free to look around and find what playstyle suits you.
---
I would have no problem with Eve going back to its roots, but why does it have to be with changes to things that actually were present in its roots? I regret not playing Eve at that time, was busy with Anarchy Online before going to wow vanilla. I mean, why don't they just delete current sov system, rorquals, caps, the whole shabang? Not change things that were actually present before, like local and cynos. That's my main current problem with it. Their changes nullifies my playstyle and all my work in the game up until now. Kinda feel cheated and betrayed. Like it was all for nothing.
---
YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT, MOST WORMHOLERS ARE UTTER MORONS
---
Yeah, Friday i had this 2.5b raven navy issue tackled for 30 minutes. His corp gave me 5 killrights 1 of which I used to bag a 2.4b typhoon fleet issue on sunday. Good times.
---
Dude you’re just a hanker out to make the game more annoying for newbros. If you wanna be shitty in a video game that’s on you but don’t pretend it’s a good thing, especially when advising a newer player
---
does it even matter if you cant light a cyno?

The more groups, the more friction.  The more friction, the more chance for that friction to blow up into something.
---
To live next to a bloc, you're going to have to blue a bloc.   But the people on the other side of you don't.  Nor does that bloc particularly care about your dispute over a constellation between you two.
---
them siting cloak leaves to much risk some one could decloak them by mistake and reveal the trap or they could go to a spot when other cyno trap could off been set up for them, better to just wait for one off the traps to be sprung then drop them there.
---
I mean you can take what I said in a few ways. But I was initially aiming at the sad state of the blue donut that you've accomplished.

Exploration is not worth it outside of wormhole space if you’re alpha. Even then I’d recommend dropping your loot off in hisec after each wormhole, since it’s always a matter of time until you run into a site that is camped.
---
I think he knows what that means, its just really weird sentence.
---
They are not stupid ideas. Cynos are incredibly oppressive. Asset safety has problems. Killmails have too much info on them.
---
&gt;For example, a new player friendly tutorial would be a good start
---
Almost completely irrelevant. There are much bigger issues. There used to be wardec griefing, and there is a massive dependency on other players which immediately creates a barrier to entry. CCP apparently prefers that people sit in null and farm all day, so thats basically what people do.
---
I saw that - awesome work.  I'm just back from a long break, and I didn't even know what a Drekavac was when I went in.  I was asking friends on discord as I tackled him.  If you haven't already seen it, you should check out: igerentundesirables.wordpress.com/
---
They also have an in-game channel.
---
It will. WOW always catered to a certain demographic and EVE attracted the polar opposite. That line skewed in the last few years but it’s not being balanced back to how it should be.
---
like 
---
what
---
there's no reason other than cost not to just bring a 270k ehp shak, it's not even appreciably slower than the drek and if you have the numbers to kill a hole with shaks it probably doesn't matter what subcaps you bring because shit is getting delteeted
---
and if the reason is cost, you're probably not doing high-end C5 brawls
---
as fulcrum said before, the 700k ehp rokh can die on there own, i dont think your gonna get that kinda tank out off a recon.
---
No it should be a Big loss for your Charakter not something srp Covers
---
That is some very spicy loot! And that's a pile of ISK you've made right there. (Makes my 30-40m/hour look like nothing.) But you do you. This is a sandbox game, you do what you like to do.
---
hmm you will need thick skin in this game... indeed its the players that make the game great and its also the players who can get under your skin. For me I imagine those players as moms basement dwelling  troglodytes autists virgins and this is literally the only thing they got going in life and who am I to tell them they way they play is wrong. its a sandbox is it not?
---
This game literally brings out the best and worst in people.

Yes. I indeed did know, which also says I hold a masters in EVE Nerdery

Sorry. I should have figured out that if you have flair you would know what this means. I just have memories of pasting large blocks of AAR into google translate ...
---
But mittens said there are no bots in goons!
---
Not necessarily, I just figured it might be a cool project assuming there was some gap in the existing community tools that people would like to see filled, I don't know the game well enough yet to tell- Just thought I'd ask and find out.
---
901k Ehp on a Falcon vs thermal damage.
---
best explanation so far.  and from a goon!  
---
obligatory grrr goon   :-)
---
Good post, I appreciate the thought that went into this. I'm all for mechanics that help alleviate the oppressive nature of capitals that have nuance and counter play versus just making capitals more frustrating to use.
---
Mwd/cloak trick. Have a travel fit. Refit at stations. Or bring a mobile depot

Thats just T2 mate.

Then your stuck in siege for 5 minutes and dead in the water.
---
hmm slap a cyno cloak and some smart bombs on that and now you have a cyno ship that can help out with the pipe bomb. every little bit off damage helps
---
You can drop your bubble pretty far from the gate to catch the fleet.  So the chances of being decloaked a pretty small.
---
&gt;Having a place to park them and let people train supercap skills on mains is just a convenience thing. That's it.
---
No it bring the up keep cost down ( this is more then a convenience thing this is a upkeep reduction in both player time and plex cost ). 
---
&gt;It's not like CCP just handed this stuff to these groups. They earned it.
---
CCP made the thing they put it down, i would not really say the earned as much as somebody in leadership press anchor and they might have shown up for defense once. 
---
This isn't a big deal your absolutely right, but it's one of many way's the game discourages anybody from not joining the winning team. 
---
Like if your not in a big bloc it's not one big fuck you it's a 1000 little way's that the game screws you.
---
yes but your pipe bomber battle ships are meant to be where they land,
---
Or dont use siege?
---
Right on will do for sure. Ive been trying to find other fights just roaming around in lowsec outside of FW space but have a difficult time finding them.
---
Add 150 m to the price and youve got 1.93 mill ehp.
---
https://i.imgur.com/sDzqY3z.png
---
Or just add 50 and get 1.2 mill with c types.

More content can be found in highsec than can be in null.

Muahhahaha everyone has a price right!

Hii bby :heart:

Tip: Once you use "buy all" to start a mulitbuy, you can open other  blueprints and "buy all" will add them to the same multibuy.

Which you can then copy to your clipboard, paste into jEveAssets and find out what you need to import.  Which you can then paste to a new multibuy on your Jita alt.

Ya, you've had cloaked Sabres hanging out in system with bombers cynoing in 100-ship blops fleets on top of your carrier?

Did you read the post? Or did I just miss your joke?

The common misconception was due to how the Hyperion patch notes were worded. If you go into the hyperion discussion where they clarify the mechanics, they explain what is laid out in the spreadsheet. 
---
Hyperion was the last documented patch notes that included changes that touched on these mechanics, so if they have changed, it was an undocumented change. I’ve put it to the test at length and so far only three sets of “unaccounted” for probes have popped up, which were; a dude we intentionally rolled in who logged out in our hole (lol), HRE seed in our c5 that was there before we moved in and has logged in since, and TEST dude trying to recuse his dreads from our c5 who started by logging in his chimera and then launching proves with his scout. 
---
Haven’t once came across a situation where more than a lone scanner has breached that sense of security closing off your static gives you. I do make a point of telling people if you leave things unwatched for basically any amount of time, expect the wormhole to be open. But yeah, if someone has more recent patch notes that explain things other wise I would be happy to be proven wrong. 
---
But this is the method I’ve found and been using for the past two years.

that thing should die if you look in it general direction,.

Don't need to be on grid. Or don't need to be in position.

Could warp down as the bubble drops.

Above is the reason Null was made into carebear heaven in the first place. Now CCP is aggressively rolling it back. 
---
As someone new to Eve - you really should not be joining Nullsec. You will get dunked a few times and lose interest. Empire exists specifically to cater to newbies to guide you into full sandbox experience of WH or Null space.  Your first Corp should not be Dreddit despite what Dreddit tells you. You are there as meat shield for older players.
---
mmmh yeah true.

Join the merry band of CODE. gankers. They are doing the one, risk free activity that chaos era has not hit (yet).

https://zkillboard.com/character/1702414266/ this is one of the "ex-goons" being claimed, seems pretty deceiving.
---
It's not. But it is significantly more difficult.

Losing a ship doesn't mean losing the game.  Dying is in intrinsic component of EVE.  If you don't like that, eve isn't for you.

That was way back when an alliance having more than one titan was, well, actually an accomplishment.
---
They're secondary only in the sense that car manufacturers are secondary to car deaths. If you make it cheaper to buy a car, and more people buy a car, and nothing else changes - more people are going to die in car accidents. In this case rorquals made it much cheaper to buy caps/supercaps. More people bought them. Those people printed isk. It's not really a leap in the sense that, say, trying to explain how supercarriers are in the low-10b range and titans are about half what they cost before rorquals without blaming rorquals. Or trying to explain how bounty prize income jumped [4 trillion isk](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3SSuZT2QzNHe2qaWMLiiDt/1dc9e65f98188bd80dda71365e9e06f9/9aaa_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png) about 3 months after rorquals came out without blaming rorquals.
---
This isn't CCP's failure. They just gave the resources and the players to Hadean.
---
59 days ago he was in Paxton Federation, a part of Goons...
---
how is that deceiving lmao?
---
You can be skilled boxer, but if you beat up unsuspecting little old ladies I wouldn't call that real boxing. Your failure is confusing lame PvP as real PvP. If you rather be a lame pvper that's okay by me, just don't get upset that I have that opinion of you. True pvpers and real PvP is heading out looking for fights with people expecting a fight. That's the highest and most honored PvP in the game in fleets or solo. Sure you can PvP solo and kill ratters, but again... that's not on the scale of real true pvp. I respect skilled players heading to FW or null and solo engaging others who have the same intent far more than I respect what you do. 
---
How hard is that to understand? You trying to find your own justification to be honored for what you do and you just won't get it. Not from me. Hope you can deal with that. 
---
Think of it as a PvP level 5. You're just a level 2. Bye

Just because he has next to zero killboard activity doesn't mean he wasn't in goons

---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78519243/ snuff pilot being claimed as "ex-goon" because apparently OP can't be assed to actually look at any of the pilots
---
What about like a Caracal?
---
T1 are complete garbage, they're essentially equivalent to L1 missions in hisec, so not worth running at all. [A guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9fgzqn/finally_loot_from_50_t5_electrical_abyssal_sites/) here ran 50 T5 electrical (and has ran other types as well, just google 50 T5 dark, electric, etc. and you should find them). It's roughly 200-250m/hr for T5. I think T4s are also in a similar ballpark, maybe a bit less, but pretty close.
---
Got in on this a little late but it was fun. Learned a few things too, always a plus
---
That so called dependency is important. An MMO is played socially with many different players from all over the world, so that does not need to change. 
---
Also, the fact that a new tutorial is needed is not irrelevant. The fact is that CCP has plenty to deal with (even without a new tutorial) before messing with null sec operations. And null sec has much more things going on than isk farming
---
I'm still here trying to have this conversation with you, does that not suggest I'm willing to understand if you can convince me?
---
It may not take 50, but the more you use, the higher chance for a decloak. I have some experience decloaking, and what I have found is it's not particularly easy even when you know exactly where they were when they cloaked. Factor in not even knowing if they're there for sure, let alone where they would be landing from, and you're going to need a lot more coverage.
---
I've raised this with CCP.  Thanks for the detailed explanation.
---
http://puu.sh/E77EW/b93b52b0d9.jpg

I looked in game, not on zkill, because these are all megakrabs with next to zero KB activity

I think zkb assumes that that kind of number of people on a km in hs are on it it is a "gank"

I did.
---
You said OP shouldn't do the thing OP is wanting to do because people have already done it before.
---
invite sent pal!
---
eh, the ships couldn't cloak that close to each other
---
Should've added a couple of gifs showing local chat. I needed eyebleach after that.
---
Note to self, bring combat probes or a 300km locker next time!
---
i apologize, i was wrong
---
T3 are both when the filaments become worth running but also become a bit harder so that you need to pay attention. T1 and T2 are essentially equivalent to level 1 and level 2 missions in terms of both difficulty and payout. T3s are not that tough, but the rewards start getting worth it. The big payout comes in T4 and T5 which can reach 150-250m isk/hr, pretty good loot.
---
Would you have a nestor fit by any chance?

You could run abyss sites, they're pretty challenging with very good income.

I don't know how you achieve 320k - or rather, why I don't see the same in Pyfa. 271k heated isn't bad though.

Also, I'm wondering if I can fly the nestor on 3 accounts. Would you have a nestor fit by any chance?

WHY IS CCP UNABLE TO CREATE A FUNCTIONAL EVE ONLINE PHONE APP?
---
No we don't install games on phones!

Thanks for the source material!

Perhaps it’s possible that someone initiated warp from the visible side, ID’d the hole and left without ever jumping? Would this then leave it as “existing” but invisible to the far side? Meaning that our friendly drifter who does not use probe scanner sigs could warp to it, but we could not? Once he arrived there of course we were able to combat him down and arrive at an invisible hole.
---
I don't know why you continue to project a level of anger on me that isn't present.  I go out looking for fights.  The people I kill chose to fight me; in fact, they had to shoot me first. They chose the time and place of engagement, not me.  I'm just reacting.  But I understand now - I'm a lame PvPer.  
---
Would it make you respect me more if I told you I was a wormholer, btw?  
---
Also, could you link me some of your kills so I can see what "real PvP" looks like?  I sincerely want to do better than a 2 on your not-at-all made up scale.
---
Also, how do the Drifters work with these dual-boxed rattles? Can they do anything?
---
Nice!  Thank you!  
---
You go wh hunting in these fits?  (I noticed the probe launchers).  How do you fair without a cloak?  You catch anyone?
---
Yeah that many sites was at least 10 hours over the course of the weekend, maybe a bit more considering he was running things in a stratios. Combine that with some absolutely ridiculous luck on those 6/10s and that is a terrible measure of income.
---
That is the worst Photoshop I think I've ever seen.
---
I don't know whose supers you're baiting out, but you're welcome to come at try.
---
I imagine you could cloak then slowboat everybody into position on e.g. a corp bookmark
---
cloaked ships don't decloak other cloaked ships. so, starburst. cloak, reapproach, wait for someone to have a disconnect and do it all over :P
---
It's not about just shooting people. That's cool and all, but what really drives alot of null players, is working together to accomplish something.
---
And what happens if youre wrong?
---
It's mostly because from a player perspective like maybe 20 people in eve do empire building ( like here is a secret if your not in leadership your not building an empire your building somebody else his empire ).
---
An actual apology on reddit, this may be a first.
---
I'm not trying to target anyone here, fwiw. The half a dozen people behind these characters are hardly representative of the thousands that got banned. I don't know how CCP chooses them, but I don't think they're going to teleport in the thousands of VNI bots that other alliances were known for.
---
Before anyone accuses me of bias, I'm in Test, so not exactly the best represented group here today.
---
No because that isn't normal and is avoided by engaging your brain
---
WHO THE HELL THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO PUT THE WARP TO 0 NEXT TO THE WARP TO 10!!!!
---
Initially cloaked ships within 2km would decloak each other, then they changed it, then they changed it again to nerf bomber wings.........so did they revert that change or something?
---
GRRRRR CCP. NERFING CYNOS NEXT MONTH AND MAKING IT COSTLY TO MOVE MY CAPITAL CLASS SHIPS AROUND NEW EDEN!!
---
WHERE DO YOU GET THESE NERVES TO SHAPE THE GAME YOU DEVELOPED?!! FFS DO SOMETHING USEFUL LIKE FIX SMALL GANG PVP, CAUSE THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS! SAD!
---
BUT HEY, ITS GM WEEK!!! GTFOH!
---
Don't try them. If a drifter pop, you'll lose a ship. You will be neut to death and since you're self-tanking...
---
Hey just a suggestion. I like your idea more tho. And the important thing is that something actually exists.
---
Thats part of belonging to a bloc. People keep complaining about the umbrella but forgetting that it costs trillions of isk and countless manhours to build and keep. If there is no reward for teamplay then why even do it anymore?
---
If hunting is too easy then it wont matter how much the rewards are buffed because there is always a better option. And it will alienate most from that activity which lowers content all around. Balance is always needed.
---
You can only buy skills remotely if they're sold by NPCs.  Loot drop skillbooks (precursor, etc) that re only sold by players are not available.
---
You can definitely start now! Skills train in real time, not have time, so older players have more Skill Points, but it's sort of a rock paper scissors game. Even a player with only a few days under their belt can give a veteran a bad day! EWAR (electronic warfare) and tackle especially. 
---
EWAR can make it hard for your target to shoot your friends, hard for them to move, or had to leave. It's really annoying! Tackle is when you run right up on someone and use a Warp Scrambler or Warp Disruptor and maybe a Stasis Webifier to slow them down and keep them from leaving. Both tackle and EWAR can be done in a few days, and in really cheap ships. Any serious corporation (player-run group, like a guild in other games) will give out ships like those for free. 
---
If you are looking for a corp, and I recommend you join one, there are several newbie-friendly options. I'm in Dreddit, the big established Reddit corp, so of course I recommend us! EVE University is another popular choice that runs actual classes in game. Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbros, and Karmafleet are the other big newbie corps. We like to say that the best ship is friendship, and it's only partly a joke. Playing with friendly people makes the game much easier, and less grindy.

And i hate to tell you, theres no difference to that now, compared to if asset safety was slackened.

Lots of bigger groups will gladly bash on smaller alliances stuff simply because they CAN, its happened twice to small alliances ive lived in.
---
And im sorry but i utterly disagree that people will just run and hide to the nearest NPC station.. Smaller alliances will for sure, cause they HAVE to, and thats NO different to what its like today.
---
Bigger alliances? ye no, im sorry mate but i absolutely fail to see how goonswarm or test, scared by a slight removal of asset safety, are all gonna shit their collective frilly panties and ship all their shit into stain/delve NPC.
---
There is no reason to, and no. it wont be "only afk players that get caught out" This npc space argument and the afk argument are total dodges that seriously have no merit behind them. Everyone are not total pansy cunts. they've just been able to live like one for 3 years.
---
People have always been willing to take the risk in eve(if they HAVE to), moved into null and wormholes and risked losing all their shit. (albiet in different ways) 
---
So if everyone is gonna run to npc space. fine by me. i'll gladly fly deep into ratting pockets and try and annoy a fight out of whats left.  cause there will be people left willing to play EVE. and they will dunk my ass, and all those cowards will either come crawling back, or fuckoff forever, and tbqh mate, i dont care which, the free lunch is over.

Yeah like bring a ship with combat probes next time. They were spawning them 300-500km apart from each other.....
---
Ye like others have responded you are lacking FSUs, fighters and fuel. And you have already broken your own budget by this incomplete fit. Not to mention that its a shit fit even if you add all the other stuff. 
---
So again, you technically dont need any mods on your cap but if you want it to actually work it will cost you some.
---
because squizz
---
Because Citadels are meant to replace POSes *and* outposts *and* conquerable stations.
---
Only the POSes used stront.  The others were indestructible.
---
Heavy water at that.
---
I think youre being overly harsh, like carriers with fighters? Who even does that? /s
---
We've been running them for a while in provi against the locals.  As per, https://br.evetools.org/br/5d5aecb7aa2e4400170d0372 for example.
---
Then do... Less?
---
No one is required to spend at least 10 hours doing something.
---
&gt;You are there as meat shield for older players.
---
No, new players can't fit enough tank to be effective shields.
---
Brand new players are given EWAR ships.
---
What makes it a shitfit?
---
It was great, and the fact that poses were limited to moons was really great to avoid structure spam.
---
While on the other hand I hate how the physical pos works, with all the anchoring and the containers. I like being able to dock up and organize my stuff that way. I don't have to lose my alt to pos guns 2 times before i get the damn thing to not shoot blues. But I agree with you that the mechanics surrounding it, like timers and stront and the system limit of poses.
---
YOUR WELCOME AND PLEASE FLY YOUR ORCAS MORE OFTEN MAYBE IN OULETTA OR SOMETHING
---
Spent way more time bashing, and repping, and restronting towers than ive spent on shooting citadels, even with three timers.
---
ENGLISH SUBS \o/

"content"
---
I think WHs should get instant local.
---
We're trying it the WH way in null, should try it the (old) null way in WH's.
---
(warning: post contains sarcasm)
---
YOU'RE* ALSO FUCK YOU MAYBE I WILL
---
Possible to avoid ships that are invisible on dscan but that can use dscan to pinpoint your location?
---
I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT
---
Good point kristallnachte, chat up people that just killed you, or just barely missed you. Open dialogue and you'll learn they may be on at this same time all the time.  Before you know it, a friend is made that fits your schedule.
---
YOU ARE ALL BAD AND SHOULD FEEL BAD
---
When we say experience fo we mean the literal leveling experience or the metaphor experience.
---
A lack of krabbers because of risk will by it's nature increase the reward for krabbing in null.  This doesn't go for ratting, which is practically pure isk/hr, but it will for good PI planets if PI becomes harder, it will for ABC ores if mining is risky, it will for faction mods and pirate stuffs.  Those all got over-mined and prices dropped despite isk inflation.
---
Well, "chaos" is good enough for null at the moment.  Time to give it to other space too.
---
I spent 45 mins trying to get Aura back when i accidentally closed her
---
You could always warp to MTU or a can someone dropped.
---
I'm not sure if/when it got reverted, but I can confirm that *right now*, cloaked ships don't decloak each other (and don't bump).
---
Because :ccp:
---
That kinda went over my head. Guess i gotta give it some time
---
Rorq pilots don't pay for Eve, they sell the ore to buy Plex... They pay for Netflix
---
No I didn't. I said that it's hard to stay motivated on a hobby project you aren't sure if you're gonna ever use. If you have something you wish was automated in EVE instead of having to do it manually, there's a lot of incentive to learn to solve it so that you don't need to do that thing manually anymore.
---
Go for a compressed ore buyer for traders. Enter your refine skills, taxes, get a buy list of what is underpriced or a fair price for compressed ore at the different hubs. 
---
There are a lot of I have x, what is it worth, but trade tools seem to be lacking lately
---
It's 2019. CCP can't require from today's players to do basic math.
---
Apart from that: you're right, it was a great system.
---
No T2 cap mods. That fit looks like an LS hit and run fit mixed with some tank. I personally wouldnt build such a fit in that manner but its situational so cant be overly negative towards it. But can say that if you want a proper fit for real fights you go T2 cap extenders, the booster can stay 1 tho. Depending on what you drop it against you might need an EHE and cap neuts. And so on. 
---
But no matter, even a somewhat cheap carrier fit is more expensive since you are lacking some mods and fighters.
---
If that's what you want to believe, I won't stop you. 
---
Hows roaming through all the empty null, only get to dropped on by supers going for you?
---
They pay with time.
---
Traditional pipe bombing used grid fu and bombers / bomb launchers.  But the fundament is trapping a large group in a bubble with a group that wouldn't win by traditional tactics but do win by bringing huge aoe damage.
---
In this case, a group of ~30 150mil battleships beat ~75  600mil HACs, by applying huge aoe damage the enemy couldn't escape.
---
he automatically warps off, right? I don't have to worry about getting trapped?
---
Thanks man, joined the discord.
---
GSF kicks and reports botters, so CCP can use them. PanFam and BOT don't, they just move them to other systems if bad guys get too close to upsetting their RMT empire.
---
I FUCKIN HATE T3CS
---
JUST PICK A NORMAL SHIP. THE ANSWER TO EVERY FUCKING ENGAGEMENT IS NOT A DAMN LOKI. 
---
SHIP DOWN YOU BADS
---
Thanks, appreciate it. Just didn't want to kit out a 300m ship and whelp it away on my first try.
---
Well, he was kicked after being discovered, then reported to CCP.
---
They did... Now they pay in wrecks and bombed drones
---
And there is a reason they changed it, because coffining characters is incredibly stupid, and shocker... bad for the actual health of the game. 
---
But you know what, I assume this will be the next change CCP implements when it turns out after the September patch that wormholers still get umbrella'd and continue to QQ.
---
Max positive security status.  How do I get it quickly?
---
Not quite true. These are all people who were banned months ago.
---
thanks for English subs
---
the game dies with dignity.
---
Poor man's DD and before Titan's/DD existed a disco bomb.
---
"Empire exists specifically to cater to newbies to guide you into full sandbox experience of WH or Null space."  Are we playing the same game?
---
THE AWESOME PEOPLE CANT HEAR YOU
---
Ive also noticed that remote buying of skillbooks fails. Leave it to ccp to release a feature and immediately break it
---
Don't feel bad. The cargo scanning cherry picking scrub deserved to die.
---
We called them Motherships.
---
When this plan utterly failed, CCP turned Motherships into Supercarriers.
---
You got it. That starts the k162 timer check ( eventually it will appear ) and populates the k162 on the other side in the invisible state. From there the drifter can warp to it like regular wormholes.
---
I want two effects per hp, random combination where it picks 1 upside and 1 downside every system
---
After it gets dirty.
---
Beautiful! :)
---
Not literal game experience points. Meta-knowledge of the game and how things work.
---
Carriers are pure garbage atm, light fighters should be able to track a fuckin brick but no
---
.....
---
&gt;tarted to 
---
Wait, are you saying that sov holders have an advantage over the people who roam through? Oh, the humanity...
---
To fix this we ought to give people who didn't organize themselves in such a way as structures could be built, claims laid, and space defended the ability to always be on parity with the people who own the space. Maybe even buttons that blow up the sov holder's ships as soon as they are locked.
---
Ok so the old system definitely had its positives, but at the same time some of those things you mentioned were the opposite of fun.
---
&gt; Defender has to repair their structure
---
While this is somewhat a fair point, the actual process of repairing a structure is as boring as shooting it. If we could somehow make the shooting part less boring too without drastic change in dynamic, I would say that is preferable.
---
&gt; Short timers (local content)
---
No disagreement there (for medium structures at least). The new system is just a massive increase in time sink. The minimum timers are longer than the old maximum timers. Really kills faster-paced low-end content.
---
&gt; Allowed for counter play on both sides(kiteing and restronting)
---
Kind of. Having wiggle room on when timers come out is nice, but how it was accomplished before was really janky. Counterplay is fine, but the purpose of timers really fails hard if there is a reliable way to force timers out of a time when they can be defended.
---
Granted, too many timers are not based on when they can be defended, but are made just inconvenient as a deterrent. 
---
&gt; Hard to scale for mondo coalitions
---
Not really. Large coalitions are much better equipped at handling wild hours of re-stronting than smaller ones. I feel equalizing the playing field here is a positive.
---
&gt; No stront no timer
---
I think that’s fair as well, but that’s really a bit of an edge case since it’s super easy to just put stront in it. No stront only really helped with abandoned structures, which I agree need to be easier to kill.
---
&gt; No fuel no timer
---
Pretty much same as above. 
---
I really think it’s fair to say most of the pain of new structures is that the lower-end stuff that function close to POSes, now are as good as the biggest structures in terms of the process. I personally think it’s mostly medium structures that need the serious nerfs. Larges and XL don’t need to be the same as medium.
---
Honestly why do you need so much isk? I have 22 b in my wallet and I literally only do pvp I might rat out of complete boredom of if I'm teaching somebody a few things but outside of that I dont do any pve activity shit all the ratting I've done this weekend all went to fund a buddies new astrahus. No one said you have to no life eve to make isk but what in the world do you need to make 500+m a day that you cant just wait a few days on? How much isk do you spead? Or is the only joy you get out of eve from big dicking with your dank ticks?
---
Is there a site that you can input the system and your skills and it output what PI you can make based on the input? 
---
If not, there should be.
---
People fly kitey because it allows them to GTFO if the cyno lights.
---
Brawling is hella fun and fighting in point or scram range can really reward better pilots.  But by definition you have to do it while scrammed.  Then the cyno lights....
---
The changes don't obviate krabbing.  They just mean that krabbing got riskier and the lifestyle of the krab will have to change.  If it can be done through numbers and resources I am sure the big blocs will do it better than others.  The old style punished the bold.
---
&gt;Carriers and Supers were supposed to be major military assets not isk printing machines.
---
Good, then ban all capitals from w-space too. Also, refund me approximately 75million skill points.
---
Ill take that as you dont have a real answer.
---
This. Every time-specific event misses USTZ. Same for patch announcements, so no chance to buy up recon hulls or something if you live in the Americas. Feels bad bro
---
PI can help a lot.
---
T2 cap extenders would give you an increase of 100,000 EHP
---
T2 cap MWD is worthless
---
T2 booster is such a minor upgrade
---
For home defense you don't really need a perfect maxed fit
---
It's also killing the game by raising the barrier to entry.
---
&gt;Also, the fact that a new tutorial is needed is not irrelevant.
---
It has already been redesigned multiple times. You want them to focus on irrelevant bullshit so your overpowered crabbing is safe.
---
&gt;before messing with null sec operations. And null sec has much more things going on than isk farming
---
It's absolutely time to deal with nullsec as it destroys the game. Cynos and isk faucets are not confined to a certain area.
---
Spooky
---
God do I wish.
---
Put in 1/4 the effort, get a bit less lucky, bring in 1B?
---
I had to reinstall this morning.
---
1 - Hard to tell null is empty if there is no local.
---
2 - Before in way way too many systems it wasn't empty.  The skies were full of VNIs and Gilas everywhere, scurrying to a safe or tether.
---
Nope, he attack the biggest signature on sight. Be sure to know wich rat trigger the decloack of the structure and keep it until the end. I lost a Rattle to a Heron like that once ^^'
---
&gt;elon support, but I definitely agree with the idea carriers should not be suitable as frontline combatants. Historically speaking, they also traveled with escorts to
---
Wait... capital ships should not be 'front line combatants?' Are you serious? So... they should be really skill point intensive and cost prohibitive station spinners? I mean, maybe you're right. Capital ships in real life have escorts, and never in the history of warfare engaged in 'front line' combat.
---
That is, of course, as long as you do not take the actual history of naval warfare into account.
---
Probably trying to plex an account.
---
Yeah, it took nobody mining the materials and building the thing. Somebody just pressed a button and it appeared like a miracle.
---
I'm curious about the travel fit.
---
Go to high sec, witness 20+ orcas siphoning off a moon belt.
---
&gt;Some of these comments are just fucking dumb. 
---
Such as yours.
---
The lower-end of the Rank-and-file pilots getting fucked by CCP doesn't actually disarm the blocs.  And those same players are far more fucked in non-bloc alternatives.  'Cause the blocs have the money and manpower to adapt.
---
So no, Jesus will not appear and conquer nullsec for you.
---
Let's roll back to rorqs not mining at all and only providing boosts. We'll even let you bee off grid.
---
Tugen in a krabbing thread. Who would have thought...
---
Thanks mate, what's your name in game?
---
I don't think the stratios can do those very well. Unless you go shield tank with DPS lows. Once those mordu get close, you're fucked.
---
i mean they're pretty decent AFK miners yea. Hell even I've done that on ice lol
---
So what is the point of owning space in null sec if, in order to make isk, you think sov holding alliances should be reduced to 'wormhole day tripping?' 
---
In addition, its nice that your other alternatives are 'industry,' which, leaving aside the 'hunter' complaint about Rorqs, would require about 90% of players to get new alt accounts (not to mention how actually impossible industry would be if everyone did it) and exploration sites, which are already impossible to find in much of null sec from over use.
---
LOL, as a goon myself (I very much like goons), the one thing I am salty about is when we complain about bots in our systems, management just tells us to stop worrying about it and shushes us up.
---
Rodney Dangerton
---
Man, mentioning Yulai makes me feel old. I remember when Yulai was the Jita of the the universe :D
---
With no local, you don't need a cyno to do pipe bombs.
---
??? this is fake there are no bots in tapi or goons???
---
did you even read this dudes post and comments!? hes asking to be spoon fed isk and seems to shoot down anything resembling effort or actual gameplay... just wants to rorq mine infinitely with no risk, screwwwwwww that. never needed that crap in the game (rorq changes) and eve only is degraded by such an approach (feed me isk for no risk, nomnom).
---
&gt; While this is somewhat a fair point, the actual process of repairing a structure is as boring as shooting it.
---
I think you (and many others) are overlooking something here: Repairing structures was a great way for non-PVP people to get involved with corp/alliance business and help. Sometimes it also involved cat and mouse games with small subgroups of the attacker that tried to interfere. I absolutlely hated that CCP removed it.
---
Probably to simulate red-shift.
---
So do I leave the rat alive? What do I do?
---
&gt; grid fu
---
Now that's another flashback.
---
Don't conflate your alliance with all of nullsec. Some of us think it's generally great.
---
THEYRE BUSY CREATING A MOBILE GAME IN HOPES IT CATCHES A COUPLE WHALES OF EQUAL TIER TO THE AVERAGE EVE AUTIST.
---
&gt;First of all, just to say, my corp maintains a strong military presence and I'm pretty much 100% safe next door in the C5 static. 
---
And you couldn't ask them for advise? I wouldn't feel so save then.
---
Found the nerf that hurts big groups more than small. Eat that nerds.
---
Suspect status isn't on a killmail. I guess he just assumes that more than X ships on a kill (in HS?) is a gank.
---
Dominix is primary. Everyone on the Dominix.
---
I’ll get over it
---
Did you ever need to repair a POS, and all of it modules, after having it all troll reinforced out of your timezone by a bored super group that had nothing better to do than wave their dicks in your direction? With the knowledge that nobody would actually show up to fight when it actually came out. 
---
The words "unrelenting tedium" don't quite manage to describe how intensely boring a mechanic that is. 
---
Calling it a "great system" is over selling it just a tiny bit.
---
Just laugh at the dumb nullbear.
---
that´s my real answer
---
I've been out of Eve for a while but I thought Frat and Mango were both alliances with Chinese players unless the old hatred between non-loyalists and loyalists got carried over to TQ as well (just assumptions from watching RnK)
---
There is a very high chance of bots being in every alliance. Although the numbers seem lower then last commissar that happened.
---
I wouldn’t recommend it, but it might be possible. Look at the caracal’s ehp/s regen and compare it to the dps of a gas site in Rykki’s guide, and see if you can make it work. A gnosis is really not that much more expensive, though, and it’ll have more dps and no problem at all with tank
---
Recycling in Null is profitable too, requires no skillpoints if you're smart and use a Salvage Destroyer and seperate Industrial Transporter over a Noctis for throughput.
---
Its a great beginner job until you can fly ships / fit several "advanced" modules like a CovOps cloak etc. you name it.
---
You only need like 200k skillpoints.
---
Pays you around 100-120mil ISK / h.
---
I loved how the titan pilot went "bleep blop beep" in local xD
---
They're all mega-rich and none of them run C5's in duo's...
---
I think you still don't get it : a 10 men, or 100 men gang isof no consequence to any big alliance, they could just remove you from space in any doctrine. It doesn't even matter in the slightest. Most often than not, the doctrine is 'throw whatever caps we have online on it and fuck'em up'.
---
But what you're thinking is 'they don't even put any effort to remove us, just click jump and it's over". Do you even know how fucking tedious it is to setup shop, ask people to go into standing, cover the 500 retards that fuck-up every 5 min, actually check intel and have FC on standby to prevent the random enemy alliance to drop the actual super pilot that goes yoloing solo, and organizing almost everything that led to having an efficient umbrella ?
---
Naah, you only see the "They press jump". 
---
You are the one having it easy, only having to bring 9 friends to form your 10 men gang and going to wherever any big alliance is krabbing without thinking because of ESI and people actually not moving from sov to  sov every week,, and you're still blabbing about how people should put more effort into chasing you away and that caps should not be able to chase away small gangs, not even considering eve balance in the slightest.
---
You're asking to be served content on a silver plate, while saying "eh i'm putting effort maybe they should too".
---
What effort are you undertaking to even think you deserve the right to annoy groups that actually took years to setup their turf without them being able to fight back with whatever they choose to, undocking ?

&gt;static of my corp's lower-class wormhole
---
How much traffic does your static see?
---
Dual Rattlesnakes:  
---
\+can run any combat sites  
---
\-heaviest mass  
---
\-no combat refits  
---
\-lowest interactivity required
---
Dual Nestors:  
---
\-can't run Strongholds without a full tank fit (don't do this--it's not worth it)  
---
\+lightest mass  
---
\+easy refits, including to props and scrams (so you can jump directly out of your site to support a gank as heavy tackle with logi and dps)  
---
\-refits required for good site running, so higher interactivity  
---
\+can hack combat relic or data sites without slowing down your ratting
---
Leshaks:  
---
(I haven't run this, so my knowledge is limited)  
---
\~low mass for a battleship, but higher than a Nestor  
---
\~no combat refit, but you're already a decent PVP DPS fit  
---
\+highest dps
---
If your static sees much traffic, then run Nestors and then maybe swap a Nestor for a Leshak. Nestor+Leshak definitely works, and if that gets comfortable maybe switch to 2x Leshak. If you aren't running the drifters, then Nestors will get slightly better isk/hr than Rattles by running (some of!) the relic and data sites and hacking while you shoot. Leshaks are probably better isk/hr than either, but I have zero experience running those for PVE. The stories you've heard about Rattles being faster than Nestors probably come from people who only put one DDA on their Nestors. You can run any combat anom but a Stronghold with 3 DDAs in at all times, once your skills are good enough.
---
Yeah, but then you're not making a whole lotta isk if you do 2 6/10s and come out with 160m for the 2 hours it took you to find and run them.
---
Teleport all the bots to said system it would be the most excitement that hs gets.
---
Players: "we aren't bad guys, we just abuse your broken mechanics"
---
CCP: fixes mechanics  
---
Players: "REEEEEEEEEEE"
---
You remind me of those polish botters.
---
They must have been very handsome and intelligent botters.
---
Yes, don't warp straight between gates. This tactic needs you to fall on the drag bubble to eat smartbomb. If you warp to another point and then to your destination gate, you dodge the bubble.
---
Well I agree with just about all of that. I think the injector is probably to blame quite a bit also. Rorqs certainly need a nerf. In general all of sov null activities need a nerf.
---
yes I know but these are regular skills (racial cruiser, indy etc). Must be broken by some reason
---
maybe,but there is a downside,you can only have 4 sentries on a strat
---
I meant that no one got concorded for shooting them, which iirc is one of the things zkill looks for.
---
I mean I understand that. But would you not feel like that if they just straight up deleted caps or something?  That seems even more intense than moving them to an older play style? If they came out today an said we're deleting caps people would like suicide off buildings.
---
Buy clone soldier tags and turn them in at concord stations
---
That... Yes, I see your point! &gt;.&gt;
---
However, I do not believe one has done the "low sec experience" without running those murder traps at least once!
---
And you so have a point about the stratios running those sites... Only 5 lows, that would really hurt the spa to sink those Battleships! --"
---
We mainly go out in null so our static is generally fine.
---
Sorry industrialists, your don't get to haul your wares to the central trading hub because....
---
*Looks at previous response*
---
....  No ratting and mining in the home system you bads. Git Gud!
---
Ask them to pay for your ships and go PvP with them then.
---
I do faintly remember a stream where our glorious leader the Mitanni provided guidance of “Goons” don’t report “Goons”.    It’s bad for morale and all.        https://youtu.be/NjyNeEOCq70
---
Are you telling me that you can't make the same 6b when you put in less time? No fucking way! Holy shit!
---
Play casually, get casual returns. Who the fuck knew?????
---
you can't get tackled on tether - there's nothing stopping industrialists hauling to the central trading hub no matter how many enemies are in the system.
---
JSPACE IS SAFER THAN NULLSEC NOW ESPECIALLY AFTER CYNO CHANGES PROVE ME WRONG
---
i'm confused about how you only pulled 100 mil? have you not been opening the caches?
---
get super, farm havens under super umbrela
---
I'm saying that you're using a shitty example for someone who is looking for different ways to make isk.
---
You won't make the 6b if you put in *the same* amount of time. On average, probably closer to 2-3b. Less if you're unlucky.
---
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP YOU'RE REALLY QUIET
---
Acceleration gates mean catching then in a site is impossible. Cynos mean you can’t gank them while they’re moving. Local means you can’t camp them in.
---
shooting things that can't or don't shoot back.
---
the common pass time between "elite pvpers" in null, and gankers in high sec.
---
I know right.  Your first guess would be a mining thread
---
People used kitey shit because they were unsure which enemies had a cyno, so getting in scram range was always a serious danger. 
---
With the new changes, going out and fighting in brawling ships will become more common. That means you'll be able to bait in PvP fit ships and enemies will come into engageable ranges more often.
---
I think the GMs just locked the accounts, logged them in themselves, and then teleported them to yulai.  One of the bots was one TEST kicked months ago and it logged in neutral in space in eso to get teleported.  Not something a botter would have done.
---
You are dickholes for doing this on a monday CCP
---
There was a handful of -10 pirates coming in to whore with rookie ships that got shot both players and police, not sure if that makes a difference.
---
I wasn't there, big if true.
---
u/ccp_falcon plz respond
---
What if Ships stayed in space if tackled before DT? Legacy code?
---
So shooting things that shoot back means i'm not elite anymore? Damn and I thought my short stay in NC. last year engraved the elite status in my DNA.
---
Yeah but Caracal doesn't sacrafice half it's bonuses to Drones and sleepers always nuke drones first.
---
I'll have to Pyfa it a bit
---
I clicked too quickly or whatever and had to do this for a cyno alt the other day.
---
Esc &gt; Reset Settings &gt;  Confirm Skill Purchase ( Reset ) &gt; Relog  
---
It worked fine for that character after I did that. Hope it fixes you as well. But knowing ccp it could just be broken in general :)
---
haha no. they kill everything
---
Thanks. I'm also a just returned after many years away and will join you guys once I get my feet under me!
---
Since blackout, I've been finding that getting into boosh pontifexes and stealing rorqual excavators has been wildly profitable. I'd suggest you give it a try!
---
Also, karmafleet is recruiting
---
I would assume zkill checks whether one of the people that killed the ship died to concord shortly after. And that definetly happened to some.
---
Define chill and valuable. I have 5 seconds tops to start warping my entire barge fleet out when recons land on grid or I start losing ships and I spam dscan more than on my wormhole alts to get some forewarning. Watching a movie on a second display or taking a short bio without docking up is entirely out while the reward is the same old. And the loot I get from those groups barely makes up for my lost mining time.
---
Here I thought you were going to suggest fitting a combat probe launcher to a mining ship in order to get an early warning on ships in system.
---
I never mine, so I don't know how feasible that is. And doesn't help for cloakies. So... Probs not super helpful.
---
Excuse me, sir- this sub is for EVE.. not EVE Light or EVE Fake.

I like how the first rorq killed came from a corp called hubris...

Like I told u/cactusjack48, having my ship blown up was something I knew could happen at any point and I accept it’s part of the gameplay. What ticked me off was the shitty r/gatekeeping attitude he had about it and how he blew me up not for the loot or the ISK, but because he hated players that did PvE and apparently decided to ruin their fun any chance he got. He didn’t even loot the wreckage.
---
That’s like someone being offended that other players do exploration, industry, or roleplaying instead of PvP all day, every day. and I think it’s entirely justified to get mad at them for it.
---
&gt; In general all of sov null activities need a nerf.
---
this attitude will have a great many people come and tell you how what you really want to do is nerf their playstyle to the benefit of your own
---
&gt; Don't conflate your alliance with all of nullsec. Some of us think it's generally great.
---
*dunking excavators and mobile tractor units like gangbangers*
---
I got you, fam.
---
The counter cyno was way too strong, particularly in conjunction with FAXes. It basically meant that any idiot with a reasonable amount of tank was unkillable under the super umbrella unless the attackers brought overwhelming force (usually lots of caps/supers or hundreds of bombers).
---
I don't like everything about these cyno changes -- I think they've gone slightly too far and should add one or two additional ship classes -- but I do appreciate that the changes blunt the impact of a super umbrella a bit. Defenders can still set up traps to catch hunters, but now it's a deliberate act instead of a default setting.
---
P much. I remember when the SkillU titan got teleported to HS, the guy wasn't even subbed and was actually banned for editing the eve wiki then forgiven. These 'Bot executions' are a joke lmao.
---
Yup, that’s basically my opinion about them as well. I bet the guy likes to pull wings off insects, too.
---
On a related note, it was a rather pleasant surprise to discover EVE was teaching me lessons that could be applicable IRL, like how to handle money or dealing with strangers in business deals.😁
---
I don't even roam in nullsec except for rare ocassions, killing krabs is kind of boring; just letting others do it and seeing the salt on reddit with all this changes is more than enough for me.
---
I'm gonna ditto this, imo the way to start work on a successful program (and in this case the determination of success is OP not burning himself out before it is completed) is:
---
1. Have a use case/problem in mind
---
1. Determine what tools you can/should use to solve that case
---
1. Have at least a conceptual plan of the different parts of the solution and how they fit together.
---
1. Actually start the coding work.
---
yes, a lot of times. I also helped repair the BR-N97 outpost with 1% structure left in 2014 in subcaps as the meme "Provi has no caps" was for the most part true back in the day. Granted, that was a bit soul-crushing as it took roughly a week.
---
You didn't shoot anything but the inside of a station while in NCdock.
---
I see youre a man of culture, but let us rewind back to the days of the nanophoon and aoe doomsday weapons
---
Battleships engaged in frontline combat, but carriers sure as hell weren’t slugging it out alongside them. I see zero problem with dreadnoughts getting into massive brawls.
---
Compared to EQ- WoW was a fucking cake walk.
---
So just have a clocked recon near your miners and do the same shit. No local means they still don't know your alt is there.
---
They do. They have probers that can get 100% hits from outside dscan range, warp in a cloaky tengu and you're dead.
---
its simple you buy Trimark armor pump II BPCs on contact for around 12million and you make those for 10 mill profit a run
---
Sounds like my old group... And myself now a days
---
Alas, the war against the bots rages eternal...
---
If I was so inclined to find these tags off the market, where might I look? (What do I need to kill and where?)
---
You need to kill clone soldiers, which spawn in lowsec belts
---
Yea a lot of people are flocking to other areas of space like metal to a magnate.
---
The blackout is soo satisfying to me. I’ve been playing for 11 years and have 4.43 billion isk lost in total. For a rorqual, that’s about 9 hours worth of mining. 
---
You don’t need as much money as you pretend that you do. Stop being greedy and go play the game. 
---
And if you really can’t help but horde resources please remove yourself from k-space and dig into a wormhole. Many piles of isk to sit on there you dragon.
---
I'd love to see what it looks like from the botters screen. I wonder if they get a gate jump effect or anything. I'd also like to imagine the botter's client has audio on and they hears the klaxons of their ratting super/titan going into hull.
---
Paging /u/ccp_falcon - what would it look like from the botter's side? Do they get a chance to fight back?
---
Now we just need Rooks And Kings to return and my week will be complete.
---
It is really hard to execute and easy to avoid if your careful.
---
TO THE FUCKER THAT FIT AN OFFICER WEB TO A MEGA, FUCK YOU MAN YOU’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO WEB ME AT 24km! THATS JUST WRONG! IT HURT MY WALLET WHEN YOU LINKED THE DAMN THING IN LOCAL.
---
You're never going to win the war of his attitude, there's nothing you can do about it and he's entitled to it.  Who cares what he thinks.  It doesn't matter.  If you get all bent out of shape because some random neckbeard playing an internet spaceship game says some obnoxious shit to you you've got bigger problems.  Just ignore him and go back to whatever it is you were doing.
---
Or do what cactus said and bait and kill him.
---
62mil/hr is not bad income, you entitled injectonoob.
---
The lower the lowsec rating, the harder the clone and the more valuable and effective the tags they drop are at raising your sec status.
---
Finish (start?) EVEHQ NG.  [https://evehq.co/](https://evehq.co/)
---
HIGHLY NON-DEBATABLE...    
---
I actually lost a malediction to them on the T5Z gate because friendlies bailed like dirty little nerds.
---
africanized rats have been a thing for awhile now since before I came back to the game a year ago.
---
Would loved to have been part of that but this pesky work thing in ustz keeps getting in the way.
---
only if you live in a region where people have spent the time and money building the infrastructure to allow that.
---
It was actually pretty fun.
---
Yes, thank God indeed!
---
Here’s the🚪, pack your 💼, and gtf👋 you 💰 krabbin 💩head.
---
At one point I had about ~32k but when I died it all disappeared...
---
I plex every month. I've never had an issue with isk without doing pve. Maybe if he didnt need 30 alts to make dank iskies he wouldn't need so much plex each month.
---
yeah but the diamond rats don't leave the belts or their safe spots unless there's a sotiyo in system
---
AETHER WARS WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD FOR A DEMO
---
I didnt mention an MWD and specifically said booster can stay 1. T2 tank is however pretty nice.
---
But listen dude. You said 300m. You linked me an incomplete fit that was higher than 300m. It was lacking fighters even and FSUs. So the exact fit doesnt really matter.
---
I am assuming they're trying hard to avoid saying that ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) is their critical yardstick.  (Hopefully their KPI of choice is not ARPPU, though - the only whaling EVE benefits from is Rorqual killmails...)
---
But I think they're right about one thing - Peak Concurrent is not an ideal metric to be leaning on. It's useful over the long term, but not for measuring efficacy of tuning level changes, imo.
---
I had fun shooting former TEST pilots.
---
Nope. Name me a ship that hasn't been nerfed or role changed over the last 10 years. They weren't handing out skill refunds then either. At least you can skill extract if you want redistribute those points. Tou should have plenty of isk for that seeing as how you've been super ratting on easy mode for ages.
---
Blackout shook out the null bears that had no business being in null to begin with
---
If they care about anything in that area it'll be retention and churn numbers would be my guess. High playtime is actually a bad idea since it risks burning people out.
---
EVE's big problem has always been that its acquisition funnel is appallingly bad, meaning they have to compensate by limiting their long-term churn to an absolute minimum.
---
I play for fun. I invest my time in fun and combat ships.
---
Been playing since 2012 but fuck me I guess? 
---
Dont know if you read my post but lets do some basic math.
---
Lets say I earn 62mil/hr.
---
At maximum I play 10 hours a week, thats 620m per week.
---
Now lets say nothing at all goes wrong ever in this timespan, i earn about 2.4bill a month. 
---
If I want to plex my account that leaves me with 700m roughly. 
---
So lets say 700m a month, now lets fit a bling ship. 
---
Thats likely going to cost all of the 700m, if not more.
---
I now need to wait 2 months to afford the ship, unless I want to lay down real cash. Which i will need to do for the other 2 accounts I own. In the current economy of eve im not going to get very far on that amount.
---
I HATE THE GUY THAT STALKED ME FOR A HOUR THEN WOULDN'T FIGHT ME WHEN I GRABBED A COMBAT SHIP, ASSHOLE PICKING ON VENTURES, WILLN'T FIGHT A DESTROYER
---
I'm sure you'd be welcome. We're a fun bunch, and helpful for new or new-old players. Say hi in Discord when you pop in!
---
Nothing about fitting arti to Myrmidoms either?
---
Its Chaos era, you may or may not see it sometime in the next 6 months. CCP's goal is to always keep you guessing!
---
Whoever snagged those 2 A-type invuls, Ka-ching!
---
To add on to this, running 3 Hawks bumps the per run up a lot.
---
Could your post be anymore condescending
---
Yeah... I tested this on Singularity. Looked for good fittings. Eagle and Sacrilege for example. Learned a lot about the abyssal mechanics and how to beat them. But got stuck with Tier 3 Sites. And this with a 1bil Sacrilege. And the profit from tier3 was that good... Not that I would not buy a ship like this on Tranquility but ratting with a Myrm seems even better then Tier 3 abyssal when it comes to Isk per hour...
---
I WAS AT WORK DURING THE WHACK-A-BOT AND FUCKING HELL I WANTED TO WHORE ON SOME SUPER KILLS AND A TITAN BUT NOOOO EVERYTHING IN GM WEEK IS EUTZ
---
THE FUCKING NERVE OF GMS TO RUN GM WEEK IN THEIR HOME TIME ZONE
---
Its actually easier than ever now to plex in lowsec.  With the updates to the Agency window you can see exactly what systems have signatures in them from anywhere in the galaxy.  Just beeline it to the systems that have 4-5 sigs and you're almost guaranteed a 5 or 6/10.
---
That might be true but regardless it has killed the activity of players in my area by at least half if not more.
---
Actually managed to get one last night.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78514528/
---
It was close. Just tried to keep optimal as long as I could and won the dps race.
---
Random time in a 2 hour window. \o/
---
Because that 500m/ day is more like 500 every 1-2 weeks. Which in eve you can lose in a minute or one misclick.
---

Reddit is english speaking from it's start, so if you want to speak about eve on russian you have to create your own sub or  adapt
---
I'd say was bad bait, but it seems to have caught everyone swimming by so far.
---
I know. Giving you shit. Miss you PF guys
---
I mean I'm confused by both of your replies
---
Depends on what you are flying. Orcas and skiffs that are not paper can handle the recons just fine. Just have to be paying attention
---
Lots of people feeding excavs like mad, goons just have more so the numbers are bigger.
---
Except for the part where it says she’s dead.
---
Both times it’s Ben a Sin actually, since then I don’t put myself in those types of situations.
---
Watching YouTube showed me not to take the bait off a gate in null.
---
I play for fun too, but i need isk in order to buy things.
---
Its about  how many battleships are in the bomb.
---
With the loss of cynos I dont think even the most dedicated players will be doing that as much.
---
Why did this analysis fail?  
---
As you can see in the image I marked the dip and yet it still failed.  
---
Also I read that you're supposed to get 100k times your accuracy in reward, I get nowhere near that.
---
as many as your ship/skills allows you
---
I roll with 3. Not sure where your getting the impression I have 30, but if I could afford that many id just sell the plex and not have to worry about isk ever....
---
as said before "Well before it was increasing my production of industry, PI, roaming ships in PvP that are destined to die since im crap at it. Padding for bad days when I lose a rorq or some other capital."
---
What is this grid fu you speak of?
---
Can confirm. Two corpmates and I getting fat stonks from these
---
Asset safety....and just how will that work for inactives?  come back and find all your stuff gone?
---
On top of all the briefer explanations, if you have an hour to spare, watch the RnK Clarion Call 4.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Unfortunately this is accurate. Even a well tanked battleship will struggle to finish off a couple in a wave before having to bounce. Thankfully most of the people you’ll run into out in these sites are fairly receptive and will enjoy having you around. If you see a dedicated fleet, and trust me you’ll recognize it when you see it, just find another site because some of them are a bit aggressive, not to mention odds are they’ll be getting final blow on the rare spawns.
---
While I'd like to see it, too, bear in mind that local was turned off on July 12th. August would be a more representative month for gauging the effects of the blackout.
---
I have that problem all the time in Windows when sending e-mails.  Highlight something on a web-page, copy, paste ... blech!  Worse if you were trying to copy just the data in a table.

I find I have to paste to a Linux editor window (VirtualBox), then copy and paste that back into Windows.

But does not the dots mean that it's there that the object is?

Oh ur not wrong there my friend lol.

Well done
---
I always took the dots to mean that it was previously pinged.
---
Early August was also when most of the people who had hoped this would end in 2-3 weeks gave up on that hope, the *"keep on trucking; push through the pain"* attitudes ran out, and people's actual reactions started showing themselves.
---
hope thats not a real quote, players dont deserve to be spoken about like that, regardless of being a krab or not.
---
Do you agree that there's a scale of PvP? For example, is pounding a noob in a t1 hauler with your Loki a greater or lesser feat than engaging a fleet of Eagles with logi in your fleet of Munins with logi?
---
If you can't see PvP has a scale from ganker griefer to elite skilled combat, then I don't know what to tell you. I do, however, assume you're an educated man and maybe you're just misunderstanding me. 
---
I do the PvP that satisfies me. I suggest you do the same. But I won't hide behind the lame shit and call it real PvP or elite. I've done it. Chose not to continue it. Maybe because I have standards and wish to keep it real.
---
I'm guessing it's stalled somewhere in the PR department. Some things take time to spin.
---
I think some changes are needed, high class is fairly dead these days. But they are delicate changes, and not the kneejerk reaction bullshit that people advocate for right now out of bad faith.
---
I agree with you.
---
Glad I didn't have to say it:)
---
One of the worst things CCP ever done was remove the yulai highway.
---
Lui, I'm not saying I thought that, but...
---
They are currently adjusting what numbers they feel are important to show case in an MER as the prior metrics in the MER are most likely taking an absolute beat down.  Be on the look out for a whole new metric list.
---
Reduce the stacking penalty maybe?
---
So you mean this one should have been a "no transits"?
---
Salvaging absolutely requires you to be in the corp whose members you're salvaging after, yes, but exploration you can do solo from your NPC corp, as long as you're smart about it. You'll lose ships in the beginning as you learn the ins-and-outs of staying safe, but it's perfectly doable.
---
They don't need to remove it entirely. But the system should require you to take active action, including some mild risk, in order to claim your stuff back.
---
I think you got part of it? It could be reoccurring.
---
Just make them as fast as other same class drones. They're too slow to be effective other than that theyre pretty ok
---
Nah One Eden is the best
---
Item cost - min cost = bp value
---
Stop flying bling then. Stop plexing. You sound like an entitled carebear. Go run level 4s in HiSec, that more suits your mindset.
---
And yes, fuck you.
---
But should it not have marked the other spots then?  
---
Also do you know why I don't get as much reward as the site claims I should?
---
heh, I remember back in I think late '13 I was on quite a few rep fleets in an exequor. I was really new back then and was just happy to be helping the group. 
---
It got people to undock, that much is certain.
---
nice
---
Maybe t3cs and t3ds? And mauraders?
---
I actually made the items from scratch, mined some of the minerals and bought the minerals I couldn't mine.
---
BPO - blue print original, the instructions to make it.
---
Once your items are on a npc station they can't do anything but they could kill you ship onsite to restrict your movements. Search eve first trillion-air. The guy talks a little about pvp trading.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cqpk28/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_august/
---
stop warping to combat sites, warp to the relic and data ones instead.
---
You're either in Wormholes or have the best luck in the game finding so many Ghost sites.
---
I'm going to go with the former. You're not in null. In Wormholes, you only want to do sites with NPC faction names and not ones with names like "forgotten xxx", you also need to be to be in C3 or below because they NPC sites don't spawn in C4-6.
---
Yea for sure. Blackout is not a cure for all. I am still pretty happy with the last two months though, because we learned alot about how a world with no local nullsec would look like, and especially a world without excessive botting and/or multiboxed farming.  
---
Plex price has gone down steadily, trit is becoming more expensive. I think the next step should be to get those same effects by turning rorqs back into boosting platforms and removing their mining capabilities.  
---
The upcoming cyno changes will limit carrier ratting somewhat, and they'll definitely affect umbrellas.  
---
If/when that stuff happens i would be totally fine with either turning the lights back on completely, or maybe getting the long proposed idea of delayed local, where you don't immediately show up in local chat and stay hidden for a set amount of time.   
---
This way intel bots can be tricked more easily by doubling back into systems. And intel coverage would have a hole, with roamers getting a chance to juke out the defenders.  
---
And last but not least it has vitalized the playerbase somewhat, we havn't had this amount of shitposting since wwb, heh.
---
It only makes the other spots if they are close to yours or if someone else has them marked. Do you just mark single zones? Rewards are based on accuracy
---
“Umm no. These numbers reflect the normal summer hiatus...” it’s just worse cause of global warming...
---
Tldr snuff dropped dreads and got kills
---
+1000 I have asked it to ccp some month ago.
---
RnK actually described this as the TRUE super weapon of titans. The ability to move fleets instantly at will. Dude was a genius
---
Years ago, grids used to be way smaller (often just a few hundred kms across) and people would manipulate them in very interesting ways. 
---
You could extend, shrink, reshape and displace them by placing objects, wrecks and corpses at specific distances. It was an art I could never master, so I'll point you to the original, ancient source of knowledge, published in 2009. 
---

I'M BAD AT THIS GAME FUCK
---

---
There is no more reward for playing riskier. Until the devs figure themselves out, making things riskier without giving any incentive will mean people just wont do it.
---
*"this is the concurrent average per day in minutes of NPCs killed regionally applied per system as you see it's fairly average as compared to before"*
---
This is a content generator, not a creator.
---
Been that way for a while. Over 2 years at least (park 40+ bombers on a battleship for a drop and watch one of them decloak)
---
Yea so EvE gets banned in Australia...
---
Forcing people to **just use alts instead** is not a form of game balance. It won't reduce the number of supers out there, just reduce the number of alts available for other, sub-capital related, stuff.
---
Snuff prove you don't need a Keepstar to have supers, it's just an expensive convenience.
---
Flying coffins were a bad idea which got fixed.
---
The solution to supercapitals is more realistic and effective force projection nerfage e.g. Maybe make regional gates impose jump fatigue on caps and supers.
---
And all that before the Cyno nerf makes supers a first-to-the-fight-or-forget-it waste of ISK.
---
Yes, what is the point of being together if you cant enjoy your collective group power. Even smaller corps can have a keepstar, its just much harder and someone bigger may want to knock it down.
---
How about: Total number of regions with pvp kills per hour, not by volume just a yes/no query. Looks about the same by region! What do you know! It looks like we have mining in each region today as well!
---
That's what I'm doing
---
I would put large scale null fleet combat at a solid 1 on your made up scale.  Do what someone tells you, when they tell you, and only have to worry about clicking the align button, the keep at range/approach button, F1 and broadcast for reps?  Yeah, that's fucking elite, sweetie.  
---
If you're the FC, that's a different story.  But I doubt you are a huge nullbloc FC.  Not with your judgmental attitude. And with what you just described, you're clearly not a small-ganger like Suitonia or someone of his caliber.  You're just nullbloc linemember #3047.  
---
Solo PvP, even in highsec, takes substantially more skill than the fleet combat you just described.  I need to understand transversal, resists, cap warfare, proper scouting and tackling techniques, I'm always solo and suspect, so anyone can shoot me at any time, and I use a ship that's not OP - no trig meta shit for me.  I'd say that's skillful.  Not to mention, I need to use my wits just to get someone to fight me.  You just undock for a ping, go where you're told, and the fight comes to you.  Hit F1, repeat.  No chance that's as hard as what I do.
---
Nope...  I'm definitely in null and not j-space
---
That...is the greatest thing I've seen in a while.
---
If you jump with less than a minute to downtime and do it right, it’s literally impossible to kill you no matter what “resources” someone brings
---
Just out of curiosity, what did you think a combat site was going to be?
---
JUST BRING CAPS YOU NERD ADAPT OR DIE
---
I the case above I only marked that single spot.  
---
But I have examples that should clearly be correct.  
---
This one for example https://imgur.com/a/R4tORrc  
---
The site says the rewards should be 100k isk per 1% accuracy, I only get roughly 33k for a correct solve at 66% accuracy, if the site was correct that should have been 660k.
---
This is actually a decent suggestion. Easy extra money to be made for a once a week effort. Not a ton but it can supplement your PVP and fleet needs.
---
The success of the strategy (atleast how rnk did it) depends more so on the bubble going up when the scout is already in the next system. So no bubble = no decloak.
---
Make it so you have to target the drones instead of the player to get them to stop
---
DONT TOUCH MY FUCKING BOMBERS YOU GOD DAMN COMMUNIST
---
I enjoyed the video but you are doing things wrong. You didn't overheat your guns several of the fights and didn't apply webs in the second. As a rule of thumb, always overheat your guns in frig fights! They are on a separate rack to everything else which means you will still have your prop mods if you had an inclination to escape.
---
I would also look in to manual piloting if I were you. Flying straight at an enemy (especially ones with turrets) is not a good idea, they will hit harder than if you approach diagonally.
---
The idea of loosing any SP is a beyond retarded idea and only further supports other moronic idea's such as skill injectors and loot creates (Just lost your Titan? Roll for $10 and maybe you don't loose Titan 5.) Fuck off with this shit.
---
&gt; You're never going to win the war of his attitude, there's nothing you can do about it and he's entitled to it. Who cares what he thinks. It doesn't matter.
---
I'm well aware that there's nothing I can do about it. I care about his attitude because I think people like him are toxic to any game they participate in.
---
&gt; Or do what cactus said and bait and kill him.
---
I fully intend to. After that, I'll consider the whole affair over and done with.
---
I wouldnt mind these things. I hope it will go that way. Dont like the cyno changes but thing is, I dont mind any change, its just the lack of iteration that bugs me. As long as the devs will do what they are saying, that they will actually iterate on things that they see is broken due to changes, Im fine. Think most are. 
---
Hehe ye thats true.
---
I wanted ECM drones buffed. All drones need a little attributes boost.
---
Double edged sword, chance if you're cynoing in to a structure you could end up out of dock range.
---
This is a good idea!
---
those aren't diamond rats nvm
---
PD is really stupid. It will only mark you correct if your line passes through one of the red dots. You found the dip, but you JUST HAPPENED to not click onto one of the red dots. CCP logic
---
And put it on display in one of the citadels owned by the corp.
---
Not sure about buying skills being broken, but I know skill imports are broken.
---
Here's a screenshot from Excel of what I'm importing into my skill queue from EVEMon, and what EVE is putting in my skill queue: https://i.imgur.com/XgnzO5S.png
---
I mean ... what the fuck?  Caldari Battlecruiser goes from being the first ksill down to the 23rd.  Weapon Disruption goes from mid 40's almost to the top.  Caldari Destroyer also moved up.  This pushed the large hybrid specs down 8 places.  And Minmatar Destroyer appeared out of nowhere.
---
It just makes no sense.
---
You mean the \~100Bil + \~5Bil pod isn't a loss if the alliance SRP's it because of SRP?? Might want to take a course in financing or you know, pass high school. XD  
---
Unless you work in the government, in which case this make total sense.
---
I'd say us rank and file guys are enjoying all the salt you null sec bears are producing over these changes. You're nothing more than a cog in a wheel out there in your ever shrinking part of bull sec. You aren't the only ones with money and you'll have less of it now that they are taking away easy mode for you.
---
Fine with me!
---
More content for everyone.
---
How feasible is it to solo a frigate Abyssal in an assault frigate? I'm thinking Amarr specifically since that's what I can fly.
---
Early/late/extended lunch break. That's what I did
---
This might be arguably more time than you have but my first answer would be wormhole ratting. C5 sites can be upqards of 600m a site counting the end boss (in case you didnt know c5 bosses arw a 100% chance but optional).
---
But it's not a combat site, it's a relic site
---
Great, another time zone locked EVE content many people cannot access due to actually having a job.
---
Too much to ask them to "store" the offending ships and dribble them out over a 24 hour period?
---
According to Reddit, it never is a good time to be a new player..
---
Was there actually a mechanical difference or did they just change the name from mothership to supercarrier?
---
well done, congratulations on putting my words back in my mouth but it's definitely an uphill battle which makes the win worth that much more.
---
i'll just add that a bulkhead fit would have a very real chance of catching up even with suboptimal piloting- dual damage rigs is his biggest mistake there. nevertheless, good kill and props for keeping going.
---
Dontbwant caps dropped on you dont hunt in big bloc space simple
---
THATS ALMOST AS DEPRESSING AS SPENDING TIME IN THIS SUBREDDIT!
---
IIRC, they made Motherships do more DPS and IIRC shrank the Ship Maintenance Bay.  But it's been a long time.
---
Solo you could probably do t3. I triple box t5s and make about 500m a run.
---
STILL BETTER CONTENT THAN IN GAME
---
We wouldn't rage, bro. Bring it.
---
&gt; I'm still here trying to have this conversation with you
---
Tip: When attempting to have a conversation with someone, repeatedly miss-stating what they just wrote is not productive.
---
Sounds like he is warpinvbto sleeper sites
---
If you can post the names of the sites it would help. Ghost sites are the only ones with Rats in kspace, if they're named pirate relic/data sites they should be rat free
---
Then it's a ghost site and they are exceedingly rare. After exploring thousands of sites I've probably found less than 10-20.
---
that sounds like regular ccp update cycles tbh
---
But could they ever jump with other people's ships docked inside?
---
If I could afford a third account, I might try doing that. What are some good fits to get started?  
---
I've only done T1 abyssals with cruisers so far and it didn't feel worthwhile. But I know that the others can be better ISK.
---
It's going to be very, very funny when this results in the exact opposite of what you want.
---
'Cause you're so blinded by rage and desperation that you can't see the obvious way players will adapt.
---
I'd like to still be able to move my super from one side of eve to the other to helicopter dick people with supers.
---
We can't all have what we want.
---
Time to remove all citadel and EC and such from 
---
Make it how they originally planned, not some permanently home
---
if you are in drone regions, some data site will spawn frigates if you fail a hack ( abandoned research complex or something like that )
---
All the chars ported today, and all the chars ported in May said "Bleep Boop" or a variant several times in local.
---
I did mention I was a "filthy casual krab". Is there now definitions that separate the two?  People wonder why new players dont stick around, it's people like you who scare them off by being as hostile as possible for no real reason.
---
Correct. This however is just a salt post. They've had no issue with it until today when they tackled a titan who didn't time it correctly, dropped a super and a handful of dreads(&lt;5) on it now coming to complain about the mechanics
---
something something blackout something fog of war
---
Of course.  That's what Ship Maintenance Bays are for.  They hold fitted ships.  All of the capitals have them.
---
Motherships, IIRC, had huge ones.  The theory was you could use some Motherships and Titans to reship your subcap fleet (we didn't have different warp speeds back then, so "go out in frigates, switch to BS wasn't a thing)
---
Problem is if you're mass re-shipping, you've either got a station nearby (you're desperately defending something) or you should be retreating instead (your attack isn't gonna succeed if you just throw more ships at it).
---
Also, there's huge problems with Titan/Rorq cloning bays, and without those problems somebody might have used them more.  But they'd still have some pretty big negatives compared to just flying your fleet.
---
Rorqs are an investment to make isk. Titans could have been. Just a really expensive investment.
---
TIL 95.2% efficiency is inefficient
---
LMAO RIGHT SPOOLING UP AN LMJD REQUIRES NO LESS THAN 786 GJ AND BADS BE LIKE "OK I'M JUST GOING TO PRESS F1-F4 AND WIN" SMH

500 mil gila with no implants can run all tier 4 abyssals except for darks. Now go and profit.
---
The probably dont want to release it before they figure out some sort of login campaign where you gain sp for mining XX amount of ore and kill xx number of rats to fix numbers so the game looks alive again instead of this shrivelling husk thats more dead day by day... sorry i mean more "healthy" day by day.
---
You could try with a Gila, they're usually the recommended ship for it. T3 start to be ok ISK/hr, but T4-5 is really where it's at
---
"as with spoons. There is no domi"

being a new player doesn't mean he's not in legacy

WHY THE SHITDID I GET BLUEBALLED BY THAT STUPID GNOSIS THAT SPLASHED IN AND OUT FOR NO APPARENT REASON JUST TO DOCK UP AND LOG.  I SPENT SO MUCH TIME WAITING FOR IT TO RUN THE BEAUTIFUL COMBAT SITES.... FUUUUUU
---
&gt;what does this achieve? oh look we can have 3000 humans connect to our server, nothing more. just connect, the ship fired itself and spawned randomly. there was still lag with 3000 people.
---
Pretty much this, yeah. Even EVE's architecture could probably smoothly handle 3000 people in one system if they weren't doing anything, and EVE does it on a single server node rather than across multiple distributed nodes.

Who called whom goon pets? Why are you all taking this so serious? Bat phoning does not make anyone a pet by default. If you get triggered by the words of some rando on the internet, you might want to get to a safe place and learn about the internet before you return to it.
---
Weren't incursions nerfed a bit earlier this year? I was thinking of doing them but I heard they aren't as good anymore.
---
What part of "ex-" do you have trouble understanding?
---
😀
---
#YPU WOULDN'T SAY THAT IN AUTZ
---
Reduce the stacking penalty by factor 5. If you reduce it, they would be pretty op in larger fleets

Or he is warping to lab sites like "Core Exile production facility"

steel roamer was right

#FREE GIGX
---
That one you only marked the yellow ones right? Is that the one you got 66% for?
---
I think maybe you're misunderstanding me. Could the mothetships jump with people in ships docked inside of them. I understand ship hangars and fleet maintenance bays, I'm talking can a dude in a subcap jump while docked in a mothership ala Battlestar Galactica.
---
&gt;CODE.
---
Always good to have quality input from L33T PVPers.
---
Extract mining skills, sell excavators and rorq, and you just got like 12-18 months worth of your income. If that doesn't last you for whatever else you want to do, you can still rat via abyssals, incursions, with pals fit for PvP, etc.
---
[cries in AUTZ]
---
nice try tau
---
No, just the ship.
---
That's why I said barges. Money wise you are in the green with a covetor over a skiff after just 6 hours of mining even if you lose the covetor at any point after that. In my eyes going with the skiff means taking the loss automatically before it even happened.
---
If they did they could have fixed that at any point since they fucked it over in 2013 with the warp speed nerfs, they still have not.
---
Dont you all have phones?^^
---
no
---
I kind of wish they would bring back small grids. It was always amusing when you had burned so far that you fell off the grid
---
They do, though. And it's not "worse cause \[sic\] of global warming", the summer hiatus occurs because *normal people* go outside and do things instead of staying indoors playing online video games.
---
The number of people that desperately want this game to be dead is genuinely pathetic.
---
Need more info on this do you know a guide or  give 1 yourself ?
---
Because fuck you, that's why.
---
Citadels should have 1 timer for each tier.
---
Astra 1
---
Fort 2
---
Keep 3
---
Etc. 
---
Low Power drops all of those by 1
---
Haha it is small numbers but I've doubled my isk at each step which is exciting.
---
I'm looking forward to getting involved in the large production chains.
---
I have. Maybe there was more if you count blueprints and skillbooks that I used on my char. 100 mil is what my loot container showed at the end.
---
That's what I thought.
---
God bless. Now I don’t feel as a bad.
---
There are fewer sites - 1 instead of 3 in highsec, so there is downtime between them (1-2 days down, 5-7 up I think). And there is some contesting for the better sites, but its still good isk.
---
LEGACY NEEDS TO GROW A SPINE AND RESET GOONS. IM TIRED OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF KRABBING AND WANT SOME GODAMM SUPERCAP SIEGES
---
I'm not sure I'd call KarmaFleet a Reddit corp, IIRC Dreddit has activity requirements on Reddit unless if you have 15m SP, similar to how GoonWaffe generally requires you to have a certain level of activity in Something Awful. I don't think KF has any requirements
---
do a littttle research on corporations to join as a new guy, but honestly, the majority of people in eve want more players to get into and stay into it.  So with that in mind, almost ALL people are very helpful in getting a new player squared away.
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
It’s worse cause people in general go outside and do shit instead of staying inside playing games that have shitty events like blackout. 
---
What’s next?  Wait I got an idea. You can’t undock a ship unless you trash a stack of plex!” We will call it  “Cash grab”, people will love it!
---
What do you think I miss-stated?
---
I for one am shocked that snuffed dropped caps
---
Did you link a bubbled init rorq response fleet getting chunked at home against a 5x bigger goku whaling fleet as evidence elite pvp roamers want to fight? Or do you class horde and test as the elite pvp roamers?
---
As a newer player thats never played with poses, what stopped alliances from anchoring poses at every moon to shut down offensive poses against them? That seems to be one if the biggest arguements I’ve seen against a hard limit on structures.
---
You're really desperate for this game to die, aren't you?
---
Cheers for the feedback, you're right about overheating. I should be pre-heating every time?
---
Ah gotcha, thanks! I guess I'll keep skilling for it.
---
haha thats fantastic! :D
---
That doesn't change a damn thing, because the hunters can't light cynos either....
---
PVP and scoop the loot. Bottom feed, baby!
---
If you're time/numbers limited or just find PVE excruciating, grab a few friends and some cloaky ships (always optional, a few ecm+tackle frigs and destroyers could do the job). Gatecamp somewhere near a big alliance's home like Horde's or TEST's, or an active pipe. With the new cyno changes you will never get dropped on if you have eyes on the other side, because you just run/cloak up if you see a force recon/something you can't handle. Chill, have a smoke/drink, watch netflix/chaturbate and most importantly shoot the shit with your buddies. 
---
Drop the loot off in a **deep** safe, into a secure container. Don't anchor anything else there. Covert cyno a blockade runner + blops in to scoop the loot and jump them out. Share the loot with those who helped you. If you want it all for yourself, join a cloaky crew and hunt for big targets, since in any decent group the hunter gets the loot.
---
Solo pvp is of course a lot more skilled and intuitive, but the problem I have is that you waste it killing grandma coming back from the grocery store. I love Suitonia and have great respect for him and Andy Virus as well. I can't remember the last time one of them tried to bait a noob to fight with high sec criminal flagging tactics. Apparently you haven't learned the greater aspect of the game as they have. 
---
As for null, I do it all... solo, roams, strat ops, fleet ops, WH raids, just about everything and clearly I live by a higher standard than you. I would suggest trying something else than orbiting and clicking F1. You clearly are overstating your skill. You wouldn't last a day in null and the blackout. You'd be crying for your criminal bait tactics and hoard of catalyst alts to F1 the next hauler. 
---
I've had fights with multiple squads, logis, caps, ewar, bubbles, dictors, scouts, cynos, team tactics, etc... the whole bag of worms, pal. There's nothing more exciting than real pvp with all the elements managing more than when to hit F1. Sorry to say, your style is outright lame and fake to be honest.
---
But thanks for clearly admitting there are levels and tiers to pvp, which is the reason I posted here in the first place. Looks like I'm right in that aspect. Whether you agree with the details on the levels or not... I'm right. So, thank you.
---
I didn't mean to make you angry and get into a debate about the definition of real pvp, but after all this I'm extremely satisfied with your response and thank you for your time. You verified all my thoughts on the lame pvper and how they can't see past easy kills, griefs, ganks, and noob baiting. But hey... if that's what you enjoy, by all means keep it up. I would though recommend you try to challenge yourself and find some real pvp someday.
---
I was pretty happy but it's still a pretty low overall win rate.
---
Is there any situation where I should be putting damage on the drones rather than the pilot? Kitey Tristan's eg?
---
You have my sympathies, I can't bring myself to grind through it, even for a Marshal bpc
---
Eve is one of the best games ever created. It’s not for everyone but extremely rewarding. I’ve been playing on and off since 2005 but only recently (past two years) really got into it. The best time to join was at the beginning. The next best time to join is now.
---
Sure, blame the guy on the upper deck of the bus and sees what’s ahead. Don’t lay a hint of blame on ccp who is driving the game off a cliff.
---
Check my killboard friend.  I've shared it.  Let's see yours?
---
Because Reddit flair is always correct.
---
Nothing. People did it.

You just start to realize there are a FUCKTON of moons.

---
PS: Community is the number one cited reason players stay with the game.
---
Is there a major conflict right now? yes... Are there any interesting major conflicts right now? no...
---
Yea we'll have to agree to disagree unless you have some data.
---
What do you expect to happen? CCP is not going to be able to identify a brand new bot today for this event and when they do identify a bot they ban it, they don't leave it botting around in space waiting for an execution event.
---
Nothing stopped them. An offensive alliance actually had to work to get a foothold into hostile territory. As apposed to.now they just dropped 50 medium structures at the same time. Some of them are bound to anchor. Then have the timers outside of the defenders prime time and they are unable to remove these structures from their backyard.
---
Just loot at the fraternity vs test war. Test has structures literally in frats staging. And frat can't do anything about it.
---
How long did it take you to reach the lowest sec status?
---
these are literally the fleets that cause them the biggest issues though. or do you think you're gonna kill rorqs or supers in your nano loki? and the problems on the other side are the same, you're usually getting a fucking superfleet dropped on you and have to fuck off. just tried to show how it looks when theres a response fleet that isnt 50-100 caps/supers/titans.
---
frankly, aside from fleetsize i dont see much of a difference. or is being "elite" limited to certain hulls? and which ones would that be?
---
Welcome to the world of rich text and unicode.
---
Not everyone injects. Especially 80m players. They just wait the two days lmfao.
---
You’re lying. If you’re in null sec, relic and data sites won’t have NPCs except for a few very rare varieties.
---
But only one titan? Reeeeeeeeeee goes multiple doomsdays!
---
It's 4 days if you have a favorable remap. And that doesn't change the isk value of the SP.
---
Hard to... I got alts everywhere.... even in CODE ;)
---
And oh what a shit show citadels have been
---
Bombers are fine the way they are. It's called a Glass Cannon.
---
[TFW you turn off sov notifications](https://i.imgur.com/VAEKr7A.png)
---
Wrong. They identify it and leave it to collect isk for months. Then ban it.
---
Yeah most fights won't last long enough for it to be a problem. I also noticed in that first fight you kept moving to activate your reps and never did. Had plenty of time too. Did I miss something?
---
Fit salvagers to a catalyst and salvage begind a krabbing super. Not that hard to figure out.
---
For botting.
---
He's a wormholer. Gotta forgive the guys who think wormholes are still scarier than nullsec.
---
Roll a FW alt (or 4, one for each faction), get them into a hecate or jackdaw, run lvl 4 fw missions.
---
The only start up time is getting the standings to accept lvl 4 missions.
---
The isk/hr is a bit hard to classify since the payouts vary wildly depending on what tier your faction is in and how willing you are to sit on lp for 6 months waiting for your opposing faction to swing the control back to their side, but in general its better isk per hour than carrier ratting.
---
Also making your BB double-DD-proof meant everyone had abysmal DPS. So it took forever to kill a fleet. Also this was before TiDi. Almost all of these fleet fights were total lagfests. Most of the time logistics had to be off grid to even be able to do anything. If you got primaried in your BB the objective was to try and warp to your logistics friends, if the server would let you.
---
Man that was a really weird meta back then.
---
I love it. "Execution". Everything about this is great. They don't just ban people, they haul their shit into hisec space for a good old public execution. It's entertainment, punishment, and a message to others all in one
---
When to titan was going down he was chatting in local say "bleep bloop" "beep meep" or somethinfg similar was that the gm's filtering it out??
---
And different for every char.
---
huh didn't know that was a dual web tormentor  
---
anyway  
---
i'd say breachers are a good example, its two drones make up 1/3 of its dps but it doesn't have replacements, and by the time you kill them the breacher won't have dealt much overhead damage. this will probably be a net gain in terms of damage saved vs. damage dealt especially considering breacher's longevity, and added drone micromanagement will likely lead to mistakes in breacher's dual active tank management. a tormentor like yours, on the other hand, has a spare couple while also retaining good dps, but it doesn't tank much on its own. so it's best to land as many punches as possible on him before he does. with a kiting tristan you shoot the drones because you don't have much of a choice, but against a brawly tristan you probably want all your damage on the ship (low-middling tank and damage, beefy drones). the occasional pvp maulus on the other hand, is begging to be defanged.
---
Wow.  Everyone has given up on the grind for this.  It's truly and monumentally exhausting.
---
Congrats and hang in there.  I hope you make it to your BPC before you claw your eyes out.
---
I like to give CCP the benefit of the doubt that they try to avoid false positives since the difference between a depressed individual and a bot might be hard to see.
---
Yup over 5 hours of anticipation for an epic fight... waiting fpr every one to get in fleet then all the jumps to the fight followed up by a black screen  when u jumped then the inevitable kill mail after multiple re logins and 30 min of grid loading
---
Red means it’s not a transit
---
Yellow means you missed
---
&gt; just tried to show how it looks when theres a response fleet that isnt 50-100 caps/supers/titans.
---
The response fleet gets chunked 4 to 1, highlighting the need for those supers.
---
&gt; is being "elite" limited to certain hulls? and which ones would that be?
---
Well yeah, you already know this, elite dvd culture has always been small numbers in kitey, high damage, chosen specifically to hit krabs and approach tards and gtfo before anyone with a clue shows up.
---
Well no you'd do a procurer instead for the tank plus low cost.
---
The major conflicts are boring. Why would anyone want to sit around and bash Azbels for hours on end when you could find fun fights elsewhere?
---
They have a bigger sig and half the EHP of a T1 drone.
---
You living the carrier main life now??? I saw you..

Wtf are you talking about? You should compare MMOs to MMOs and not cool guy arena shooters or MOBAs...look at this apple it is so much redder than this orange...

I get this strong feeling that tells me most of the loud ass whining about “adapt or die, krabs” is coming from people who don’t actually play this game like an MMO, they play it like a fucking MOBA. Back in my day we existed in a persistent world, not just logged in to “meme on some nerds”.  No your cute little 4 man gang can’t kill a fleet of Rorqs and the entire response fleet. 
---
These empire and umbrellas were built on the backs of huge groups of pilots within the confines of the game, just because your elite and your 3 buddies all fly together doesn’t mean you should be able to topple these established infrastructures. Go back to your holes and your LoLs.
---
The playerbase is loosing members and the few that remain stay within the great game called Eve online.
---
So it worked like i said, then they undid that at some point, then in 2014 they made it so they decloaked each other because isboxer bombers were an issue........still trying to find when they switched back.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2iv81w/sisi_ccp_stealth_buffs_isbox_bombing_cloakies/
---
Correct.
---
Destroyers and Indu-transpoters are better because they're faster warping around in System and have like twenty time the cargo space of a Noctis.
---
So you minimize the time spend between sites to salvage and MTUs to scoop.
---
I'm sitting in Delve you get about 3-5mil ISK loot from wrecks and about 7-9mil ISK from salvage. Your usual Titan wants to clear a site every 4min 20sec since thats their Boson cooldown with max skills, so roundabout a site every 5min if you calculate warp time between sites. That are twelve sites an hour so about some hundred million ISK depending on what drops. Thats a single Titan tho, in Delve there are several Supers / Titans or normal Carriers ratting in the same System. Thats why its so important to not use a Noctis since it turns like a Rattlesnake Battleship and warps just as slow, ideally you want to leech all Supers and Titans etc. so throughput becomes very important since you only have like 2h until wrecks despawn.
---
Sometimes Supers etc even let you have their Faction Spawns and Dreadnoughts to loot and salvage!
---
One mans trash is another mans treasure.

The iron crown one is connected to at least 6 other vni/carrier ratters i have seen in scalding pass all with exact same character picture all with a similar name

Often I get a huge adrenaline rush during fights and click/misclick everything. Definitely happened during this fight, I had the shaking hands afterwards.

I should try to get over it but it's also my favourite thing about pvp

Come to Pandemic Horde. Get chatting with a recruiter or someone who is ready to hook you up with a new player package, which should help. Get on coms, get in fleet, shoot things and explode. Repeat!

Is there a good place to find solo pvp during USTZ (like 22.00+ in eve time)? Min/amarr fw is really dead outside eu prime and tends to be nothing but baits during ustz, black rise/placid is just blobs and gate camps even during prime time from what I've seen. Can be nullsec as well.
---
Fighter 1 on my main :pray:
---
While repairing a structure was definitely not fun, it would definitely help prevent some of the citadel spam if it were still around.
---
NO U
---
That's a screen relic. I've almost shat myself seeing my cloaked, stopped t3 start doing 360s. Don't know why it does it, probably some bug with ship orientation vs. 0 velocity
---
The conflict agaisnt shitty spelling titles is ever lasting
---
Does anyone know what the point of web drones is? They can catch and web a battleship or bigger, but that's about it.
---
No. Drifters stop dropping loot, like in nullsec.
---
You realise the gokus would have fucked off to find the next juicy whales right?
---
Cloaked ships do not decloak other cloaked ships. Never have. 
---
You may be remembering someone's idea that never made it into game
---
The ones that are maddening to me are the ones that show I successfully marked like 15 transits, but one on the extreme right or left (clearly also marked) shows failure.
---
SMH EVEN THE GMS CAN TIMEZONE TANK
---
Gatecamping in a 15 minute old Broadsword in Ladistier. I pressed the jump button instead of orbit. Concord won that round I tell ya.
---
The probe launcher is more for utility and the fact that expanded launchers require like 0 fitting space on T3Ds. You can use it to transit through thera, scan MTUs, combat scan warpins, etc.
---
A proper ratting BC or BS will be really rough on a hecate. It really wants to shoot frigates and squishy cruisers.
---
These are the only ones with NPCs I occasionally find. But you have to be really unlucky to find several of them in a row. 
---
Either way, if you are not prepared to fight google the site-name and find out what is inside before you warp. It's PVE. There is no time pressure.
---
Ganking alts aren't usually registered with Zkill, so you often won't see the Concordings appear there anyway.

It's not to troll, they wanted to bait out caps for the repair in order to driveby DD and if you knew this you can counter bait and dread bomb the DD, but thank god CCP fixed all that way too much sandbox phew.,

As is tradition

Yet another fighter nerf, locked in position and can’t warp, no local, no cyno’s.

Didn’t you hear, Carrier ratting is dead

"There should only be one playstyle"

oh, it's retarded.
---
It's simple.
---
* Delete the small and medium drones ewar drones.
---
* Increase the strength of the heavy drones
---
That's it. You want strong drone ewar, sacrifice 25 mb each and actually get it.
---
It has changed multiple times.  In 2006 cloaked ships would decloak each other.  They changed it at some point, and then changed it again in 2014 in the bomber nerf, then they changed it again at some point since then.

Kinda weird. Because even if it wasn't a known transit before, and it might have been random noise for all we know, this probably should've been marked by other players before so you should've gotten one of those 70% successes.

They should allow us to configure the utility drones. Lets say the sensor dampening drones should be scriptable like the sensor dampener. Script them to reduce scan res if you want to fuck up enemy logistics temporarily. Stuff like that.  The current version of all these things is indeed completely useless. Except for the ECM drones maybe in a few small scale scenarios.
---
Sisters of EVE are a group of people that mainly focus on rescuing civilians and innocents from a wide variety of disasters that mostly happen in space, and can be the result of pirate raids, capsuleers attacks or regular people caught in the empires’ wars.
---
A Dreadnought would see little use in their scheme, as it is used as the main damage platform against static structures, or other capital ships. SoE would gain little from destroying structures by themselves, just to rescue whoever could’ve survived a reactor meltdown of that level.
---
As said, a FAX would be the most likely to be created, as it is supposed to help every kind of ships, including the largest ones, to maintain their hull integrity by refueling their shields or repairing their armor plates (and in rare cases, repairing their hull directly). But as said once again, CCP still need to find interesting bonuses for that new faction capital that would allow it to fit inside a niche.
---
Last, I’d say a Titan could be probable. Not used as a capital and structure killer, but as a supersized flying hospital, with gigantic onboard medical facilities to help during the biggest catastrophes (like that Caldari Leviathan that crashed on a Gallente planet), but it would see little capsuleer use, unless they can do something like a Titan bonused for remote repairs.
---
Maybe a carrier too ? It’s a Capital ship that can be easily moved, can carry loads of assembled ships and has access to versatile fighters, including support ones.
---
I was ratting in a Raven yesterday, aligned to a station. As soon as I saw a ship on d scan I mjd'ed and then warped out. That ship landed where I was before the mjd just as I entered warp. Obviously this won't work against cloaky ships, but it saved me at least once. (Don't know how well it will work repeatedly.)
---
Right. Because, as is well known, every single person who does a thing does it for the very same reason as all the other people who do it. And that reason is of course the exact same reason you do the thing. No way they could have their own reasons. No way at all.
---
that reminds me, I should go to Tama one of these days.  I don't think my ship will survive though.  lol
---
bet you got jdc4 to you big trash bag
---
Yeah alot of mine didnt. Lol
---
Most ideas I've ever heard for balancing them would become op at larger fleet scales.  With all of the other changes going on right now, I don't think this is where CCP's attention should be.
---
are you stupid or retarded
---
Cant speak for tapi but we wouldn't have and judging by past engagements aswell as the one you saw in the video im fairly sure horde wouldn't have either. These beans are crazy bloodhungry. And i honestly doubt tapi would have fucked off when 2 other fleets stay on field.
---
well they dont play anymore so lmao
---
I never have, I typically fix it once I'm no longer able to enter Jita without the police attacking. I think that's like -2.5.
---
I was in GBC and later IT Alliance.
---
I remember when we where on the offensive that you had fleets with dreadnoughts roaming around RFing POSes all over the place.
---
Hilarity ensued if someone stronted wrongly or forgot it alltogether. And on the defense you had work between OPses repairing guns and other structures around your POSes.
---
Also, before they removed most timers, it took the better part of a day to setup a deathstar or resi-star POS. Also work someone had to do, but it was something that non-hardcore PvPers could do to help the alliance (and nothing keept your from doing some ratting on a Alt, or missions or mining.
---
The new Citadells are a good idea badly executed and leave a lot to be desired. If they are better or worse than the old system is subjectiv. But i *had* fun doing POS stuff (i am more the contructor-type of player instead of the destroyer, i play stuff like Anno and Egosofts X-Games).
---
Force recon ships or blops battleships. That have hell of a tank on them
---
Yeah it is roquals are the new meta
---
How to make easy 60m ticks and safe
---
1. Fit duel sebos not a bad
---
2. align to citadel 
---
3. As above
---
Well...  They do here
---
Dam auto correct sebo not bad freaking phone
---
Sure there is.
---
They aren't goons if you kick them.
---
That's CCP's general strategy at the moment.  Nerf into the ground instead of incremental change.
---
Which is how we get the meta to change from one wildly stupid phase to another.
---
UNLESS YOU ARE SLEEPWALKING

What a good improvement CCP.

Tell you what, if you suspect someone is a bot in GSF, send me a jabber message. I'm not scared to raise a stink.

Is there a point to be found among all this cancerous millennial parlance?

If you're in a novice or small FW plex, using Dscan and paying attention, there is no way in hell you're going to get into a fight you don't want to take. That's the whole appeal of FW, you get nearly perfect choice. You can still catch people who don't pay attention, and you can sit on the warp gates (which can be scanned), but you're fucking delusional if you think that fragging the occasional noob guy in a t1 frig with your slaved garmur is because you're 2 elit 4 dis world.

Squishy cruisers are my target, so I think I'll be good.  Thanks again!
---
Hey dude you're fucking awesome. Everything you've been saying I now realize is 100% the case. I live in the blandest part of null. I often undock and look for a fight. I find mostly lokis, there have been some kikis, and Nanos everywhere. I have no fucking clue what ship I could fly to stand a chance solo against one or more of these. I legit have no idea what to do. 
---
I want to play, but in the drone regions there's nothing but cloaks and nanogangs. I live in space Compton.
---
I've been having a blast in low sec. Like you said, the fact that the general shape that fights can take, that I can just plan in general, I'm having fun.
---
Wall of text I'm sorry. I started FW on a new alt à month or so ago when they had the promotion. I really love my dual Rep breacher but I need a cheaper ship for now lol. Thanks again man

Defanged is a great term for it. Cheers for the advice
