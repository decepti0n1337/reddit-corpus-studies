I'm not a native english speaker, so explaining gramatic rules and things like that is kind of hard to do without the specific vocabulary (which I clearly don't have).

But you'll get a handwritten letter from the only and only Jay, for whom goons are gay. I am informed his handwriting is magical and the paper smells of pure sunshine.

PI "templates" would just be dumbing down a really cool aspect of the game. Every mmo does this gradually and their numbers drop as a result. EVE has been pretty good about not dumbing everything down too much, but it's always alarming when people ask for simplifications. Not to mention it would kill profits for the people who actually do PI for money.
---
A Goliath implant helps a little, I still avoid Dark when I can, Gila with Navy drones will tear through them though.

To be fair, the wormhole move fleets Fade to Gem were handled spectacularly well, first by Horde's scouting arm in finding the chains and then by FCs like RockMuncher just in terms of herding the cats. There wasn't a single wormhole slip-up of the kind that would earn server-wide infamy, which given how much stuff was on the move was an enormous accomplishment. But leadership didn't deliver on its promises of suitcase support, beyond the first outbound trip, which cost me a lot in detonated hulls at a time when losing that much really hurt. Combined with the nightly Elo Knight parade once we got to Geminate and the infamous Vanguard awoxing of a Hurricane fleet that was preparing to fight Bjorn, it made my subsequent exit from Horde not nearly as painful as it could've been.

Agreed. Like .... I selfishly want it, but it would probably be bad in the long term

Its a huge change to how EVE works that could have big repercussions, so I think CCP is considering doing it permanantly but wants to make sure that it isn't a disaster before they commit.
---
Bob has spread his man mayo across the stars!
---
did you really make a thread to call out another thread for being dumb?
---
are you the product of incest?
---
Solid video! Comms are always better than dubstep sped up bullshit.
---
I notice that you run your microwarp unnecessarily a lot on your Drek though, but since you’re dual boxing a ceptor I guess it’s tough to manage
---
An alt in each system will be useful during blackout for a few reasons. They can watch gates/undocks for activity, they can dscan for undocked fleets or ratters etc, or they could blops cyno in a bunch more stuff you wouldn't know was there because it would also be cloaked. 
---
 Getting them on position before the blackout starts I doubt will make much difference either way to what they'll do once it does
---
Nice video, it’s cool that the pulse Exec can fight beam Tormentors although I’m more of a beam exec man myself, the dps is a lot higher.
---
There was a Star deal going on and in order to find the page with the deal, I had to have a specific link. 
---
Ask your friend to send you the link he used to the page he got it for 10 pounds at.
---
I need to play that again.
---
If that is what you believe, you are a moron.
---
Yep, paying with euros is the most expensive sadly. Then comes the dollar and the pound followed by the ruble. You can buy subscription for dollars from Markee's store, but I haven't found 3rd party retailers selling sub for the others.
---
Local will still be there. They can make themselves appear if they choose.
---
They can also warp in and light a covert cyno because after the blackout you won't know if they are there anymore. If they come in after the Blackout, your eyes on the gates will see them and report them.
---
Now quit being dumb.

Hey blight! how are ya

I just finished skilling and buying for a deeeecent Hecate hunter. Gonna have a pal or two come out for a roam. Maybe bring a newbro with.

This is gonna get weird! Woop!

That sucks they should turn the poses into single person industry stations instead of removing them.
---
He had the choice to not make such an unsustainable promise to start with, going back to my original point: there's a reason why irl corporations take such meticulous measures against being caught with their pants down like this.
---
Or the PCU will take a shit and it will be incredibly boring.  I honestly have no idea, but the number of people who think this will somehow = engagements and kill (especially in the long run) amuses me.

Sounds about right, yup.

Thanks a lot man. I’m very glad something can be learned from the video. Thank you much for watching and commenting.
---
My buttcheeks are permaclenched, but that doesn't excuse your silly labeling.
---
The scary thought is that bots may not have too. Just because you can’t SEE local doesn’t mean that chat channel member list isn’t loaded into the client memory and accessible. Bot programmers have full access to client memory so while the client is programmed to not display the names of the members of local until they speak, if it’s in memory, bots may still be able to know when hostile enter system. Won’t know for sure for awhile.
---
Thanks for watching man!
---
You're fine, EVE is probably the only game where something as trivial as a chatbox is the most important survival tool in the game.
---
Do they offer complimentary paste when you sign up?
---
Sauujk in the background "Australian timezone and how its the best"
---
Bots can do absolutely any action a human can ingame. The only advantage humans have is intuition and being able to adapt to a situation on the fly.
---
God the move from Fade to Geminate sucked. Pretty sure I still have shit around in Tribute lol.
---
!Vily
---
This will undoubtedly push players to lowsec.  Assuming it’s left in a relatively permanent status (which it won’t).  We’ll get structures to restore local.
---
Improving low sec such that the benefits of the space (not necessarily an apathy if null) incentivize players to do more in low sec will be great steps in the right direction.
---
nice try
---
Seriously why would people play eve as a farming simulator. As a pve game , eve is terrible. WOW is better , there I said it
---
only the finest!
---
I think it might add some new tactics for the FC's toolbox. It would be neat to see how pvp changes around it. But yeah, bots will bot and that wont change much. 
---
I just would rather be optimistic, because I personally felt that the lack of local really made wh pvp more interesting. You HAD to have scouts on their hole, or you had no clue what was coming until it was on dscan. It makes certain roles more important too. 
---
I also love the rapid escalation of numbers during these fights, I think once an FC gets in over their head they might just batphone the entire phonebook and we might see more large fights. It would also help the economy for more ships to explode more often imo.

You need to pay attention to what their statements actually say.
---
At any time has it occurred to you over the last few hours that with pretty much every single response here disagreeing with you, that maybe, just maybe, you need to rethink your thread, ideas and possibly your life choices?
---
If you have a good setup you can make well over 1b per hour doing lvl 5 missions
---
I'll have him try that tomorrow, thanks for the tip.
---
Oh woe unto you that have been blocked by "Gallente Rebel."
---
hell yeah dude hard at work keeping the subreddit safe
---
 The best high sec corp is Code.
---
&gt;The biggest impact it will have on roaming gangs is the amount of time they spend warping around looking for people who are not even there. 
---
Everyone seems to keep missing this point, with no local in a 50-60 + AU wide system you are going to spend a few minutes bouncing around just to figure out no one is home. And given how much of nullsec is already empty unused space and how much more people are going to compress themselves to prevent getting ganked with no local there is going to be a whole lot of searching empty systems before you find a target. Outside umbrellas I don't think people are going to find this gold mine of targets they keep hyping this event up to be and under those umbrella's you're going to get melted when they drop a fleet on your head.

I press V and then look at my directional scanner window to see if anything’s changed. But yes well done on creating this
---
No mention of monoclegate?
---
Odd question I thought of with the upcoming nullsec local changes; why don't we have a dscan immune frigate? I know we don't have two sealthy hulls in that size, but what about one of the interceptors?
---
test and goons are irrelevant, change my mind.
---
With how vital the D-scan function is, it could use a redesign.
---
I write for a living and would hire you, so ... not terrible.
---
This is old test it’s no longer like this it’s all just ratting talk and isk per hour memes and krabs getting angry at anyone being remotely edgy and reporting to diplos.

During my time in TAPI I once had a guy tell me "I wish your entire family was ethnically cleansed" (Without consequence to that person I might add), and afterward, I got into trouble for sharing my fantasies about sleeping with Sappo's wife (I have a fetish for Jews)
---
who cares about walking in stations or monocle gate
---
Yes, it will be less in nullsec. Eventually I imagine some of them will come back and find the optimal solution to get isk. 
---
Many will probably move to highsec and just take the lower ticks.
---
Within minutes of Gobbins announcing it, even.
---
Don't know. I think it might be a different node.
---
Nobody gives a wet fart what you think.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(How'd I do?)
---
We had local chat issues for weeks if not months. People still went about their business. People still even used local when they thought they could. And despite the existence of cloaks, Force recons, and scab inhibs people still rely on dscan with regularity.
---
There are possibilities that lie between worthless and OP. You just have to keep in mind benefits, trade-offs, precision, and accuracy.
---
(๑ゝڡ◕๑)
---
This is fucking golden
---
That's not what I believe, that's a fact. I mean really, did you think CCP was making all these changes out of the goodness of their heart to help you, the little eve player that could?
---
Estamel launchers? Is that like a bonus loot piñata for gankers?
---
Because I already have one day job and I have no intention of getting another.

You play eve. It's literally a job in itself

Delve isnt stuck in New Eden with you, you're stuck in New Eden with Delve. As someone who has been in multiple large alliances Delve is one of the more active areas for PVP. It's like Curse and Impass got smashed together. You can have 30-45minute gaps in Intel in Impass. But Intel happens every minute in Delve.
---
It's funny how people assume Goons are not going to take advantage of the blackout. You arnt coming for us, we are coming for you.
---
Does the lady in the back have a baby that she throws on the floor?
---
You know any botter worth their salt already has a gate ping bot set up.
---
So unless youve seeded into know bot systems...they going to just as hard to catch. If not harder since local still goes fucky from time.
---
You haven't broken new ground utilizing NPCs . There's videos of this over the years
---
Can't dscan cloaked ships
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA
---
Align about as fast as any recon. and 72km point and 27km scram kinda nullify the speed issue for initial tackle. 
---
And dont show on dscan
---
Bah ... just a fad that will never catch on!
---
Like electricity.
---
your mom should have swallowed and save us all the headaches
---
" those login rewards you can introduce something similar and characters  being online, not docked up and not cloaked can earn points that people  then use to buy **cosmetic items** that go directly to character, so cannot be sold."  CCP makes way to much selling those cosmetic items for cash, they'd never go for that.
---
Sabers have a decent sig radius because destroyer, shield extender, MWD, and (if) shield rigs. They are not sig small as one would think.
---
You can get 337dps out of a full neut curse and 440-480 for a double/single neut curse.
---
With selectable damage thats enough for most ratting ships.
---
Had a good chat with him in PM, learned how he does it and he learned how TEST does it.
---
If there are no NPC stations in a system and no citadels, can I move my asset security items to Engineering or refinery structures?
---
Fayral learned everything he knows from Noir. :P
---
clearly OP is way to stupid for that.
---
Ha thanks! I actually have done a fair bit of paid writing &amp; proofreading. Working on getting back into freelance writing, and figured I'd broaden my skills and portfolio a bit and try something fun I'd never done before. So if you would actually hire me, just let me know! :D
---
Nope. Just another one of those Internet hoaxes.
---
the farther down the thread you read the more it looks like OP really is that stupid, that or the best troll ever.
---
My thought is when the bot program checks local during the blackout; what value is returned?
---
You fit anywhere other than stale gamer beta compensation clans (I can't believe I just used that word).
---
with the massive price drop in those over the last year is there even money in it anymore?
---
Still better than your twitter takes.
---
"  Think for a moment CCP was pulling out its hair trying to deal with all the bots " No they weren't, they have consistently put the absolute minimum effort into resolving the botting issue which is why it is now such a problem.
---
Ah, my bad, didn't notice it's per level.
---
  
---
Source: Am not a Super pilot.
---
concord has a known trigger that you can play around, gate guns do not scram web and insta kill you. Drifters were a bad idea that was implemented poorly and with zero communication. CCP gets a 0/10 for this event so far.
---
Awesome clip, i wish null would be like that for a while, but really, bots that use local to safe up may die, wimps may unsub, toxic failures who want to hit people that can't defend themselves will shit up reddit and all will be back to normal soon.
---
CCP are trolling you, guise, it's a desperate illusion of things happening because the Trig invasion was being farmed from day one.

So you aren't excited for blackout?? Shame
---
Please don't listen to this guy, he's obviously not got a clue about money making in low.
---
&gt;a binary polarization of null sec is boring and means no real change can happen.
---
well unfortunately a no local nullsec is going to lead to just that, people will continue to consolidate into a few mega coalitions that give them the safety that local used too.
---
Going to come back here with killmails from this weekend dont let me forget.
---
That would actually make sense, why would the owner of space and the operator of the network allow a hostile entity to use it?
---
&gt;  Is there a guide/list of things I should and should not do? =)
---
1.  If you are not having fun doing something, stop doing it, and find something fun to do.  If you are not having fun, you are playing Eve wrong.
---
2.  Make friends.  The most valuable things in Eve are trust and friendship.  Nothing like being in a fleet of friends, getting vaporized, and laughing all the way to the clone vats.
---
3.  Trust nobody.  Even if they share the same house with you; they are a spai playing the long con, because who else would live with you, an Eve player!  Yes, that means your momma is a spai!
---
4.  Don't take it personal.  It is just a game.
---
5.  Ships are consumables.  Don't fret about losing them, and expect that it is lost upon undocking.
---
6.  The best way to disarm someone being hostile in chat is to complement them, agree with them, and make them laugh.  Self deprecating humor goes a long way.  Never lose your temper; just step away.
---
TL;DR hord moves from one place to other place
---
If you're in Goonswarm and you're not getting enough fleet pings, you need to join more SIGs and squads.
---
"There could be 5 stealth bombers ready to bomb your excavators at any point"
---
No one is going to be using excavs, they'll just load up their drone bays with multiple flights of T2 mining drones and wait it out.
---
" also going to be incredibly vulnerable to being blue scouted during this period " 
---
This was already a thing and happens all the time.
---
Myrm will cut my ticks by 20% straight up.  More if you fight active tank rats. It doesn't make sense for me to rat at all.  Ratting is already boring as hell, now with 20% less isk! Fun.
---
For the time being abyssal and join the hunt is my plan.  I expect the hunt will get pretty boring pretty fast since I doubt much will be out
---
Am I the smartest dumb kid? Or just dumb?
---
Yeah the cap support side of that move was something of a shambles.
---
On a tangential note: I found a great many routes from Fade/PB to Geminate. The only reason I really play now is to poke around wormholes. I don't want to live in them anymore, but taking a hole in Fade, popping out in deepest Aridia, jumping a few gates, then hopping through another hole into Geminate (or wherever) with a bunch of beans in tow never gets old. Over the years, I've converted umpteen beans into wormholers btw just because of short convos they struck up with my scanning alts after a move or whaling fleet.
---
To think: if it weren't for Krebs, PH might still have a native wormhole corp. Ah well.
---
Damn, that's spot on...
---
Damn, that other guy stole your post...
---
Not unsimple isn't not the opposite of the eve wayn't.
---
yes, everybody should stop botting but you can only control if you are botting, so in order to stay competitive bots become more and more appealing

---
yes  
---
they count as citadels for all asset safety purposes
---
uh this is not the no suggestion is stupid thread
---
I think you're right.  Now intel is free and easy.  A single scout in a staging system tells it all.  Now you'll actually need spies to get info that was previously free.
---
And when you say “people will be afraid to undock” you really mean pussies like yourself. Be gone nerd.

---
Subtle difference, TEST only logs in to shittalk.
---
&gt;It doesn't make sense for me to rat at all.
---
yeah, and the hunters don't seem to get this - they think people will continue to rat despite every other alternative being better, or upshipping to something they won't be able to engage.

Depends - if the numbers of logins drop dramatically it will not take more than a week

I was in BRAVE when PL kicked them out of catch, and then I had my own titan in karmafleet when we kicked PL butt in X47, that'll keep me going for a while yet :D
---
Dang, do people exploit this in wormholes?
---
Now put a nullifier on it and you have a drone-built proteus.
---
Actually the reason you see no drone-proteus's, and few Stratios, in that kind of cloaky-hunter role is the natural drawback of being a drone ship in hostile space. Proactively disengaging in response to sudden threats (cynos, dscan) means either leaving your dps behind, or takes far longer, because drones.
---
Stop posting. XDDDDD
---
Twitch Prime also has a deal going on for 15 days of Omega and a ship and skin
---
This is amazing!
---
Mate if the big botter groups try to continue BAU, it's going to be a feeding frenzy like eve has never seen.
---
Last time local broke it was a VNI holocaust. I picked up more than 20 and only because the first T3C I grabbed in my hanger ultimately turned out to be a bad choice (took a ASB fit loki instead of something more sustainable, like my blaster proteus). I probably lost another 10 to others because I had to duck to NPC space to restock ASB charges.
---
It was christmas and Fountain was an all-you-can roast turkey buffet.
---
I hope you are right. I think though that no local means drone cruiser based, anom farming botting activity will necessarily be severely curtailed.
---
Big Heron and Slasher kills.
---
Lol, maybe!
---
Why do you ask?
---
Horde does it better, or at least did up until the move to Geminate. Our PI markets in Eso, the visible ones at least, are not nearly as well-developed.
---
Astero’s and Stratios loot piñata could be worth quite a lot . And way back fw people were flying big stuff. And I’ve killed my fair share of caps and sub caps in null alliances. So you can quit bitching or unsub.
---
Sounds good in theory, but because our dear botters tend towards whichever income source is best (cash or minerals), they are a self-balancing input to our overall economy.  
---
So where you may be correct in some more fixed-supply resources (PLEX, T3, some T2), in general minerals vs isk balance, bots or not bots really doesn't have much of an inflationary or deflationary impact, or at least it doesn't while the relative ease of adding another silverminerbot is about equal to that of adding another Rate My Ticks VNI.
---
It totally fits, except the friends concerning things ... the moment you start going to eve meetups and meet them and have an awesome time, you can tell friends and family "hey you know, going to ... Canada to meet couple cool dudes" and they're like "woah thats so cool" ... suddenly accepted me playing a game forever :D
---
The fun in the game thing ... well yeah another story :D

Yeh man I hear ya is also nice to have the confidents punching into potential kiters but I have kinda been diging pulses recently.
---
4 clients on one screen or 4x screens. What resolution ?
---
I'm not bitching, I'm pointing out that the removal of local is not a magical fix to EVE's problems and creates problems of its own. But for someone like yourself who is still content with killing trash, the effects of these changes are less apparent.
---
Honestly this is tame compared to the EVE of old.
---
It hasn’t happened yet so what you’re saying isn’t fact there for it’s bitching. There’ll be plenty of shiny shit to kill. Always will be. You’re just salt ridden. And it’s unbecoming. Good day sir. May you live well in your station for the remainder of your stay.
---
4 clients over two screens (or one 49” display) at 1080p
---
I don't think this will be the case, the reason being part of their safety is the distance it takes to travel to them. In Low sec you would get pestered constantly.

Welp that's enough internet for today.

I recently got into small T2 hull production and moved quickly into JF production ( from reaction the materials to invent from bpc's)
---
I wish I didnt give this manufacturung a go, its like a side job. I barely log into my main and do my things...
---
Pretty sure it's your connection.
---
Ah yes, the old 'Kor Azor' pipe crew. Man that was a different time, shield Drakes were the tankiest shit back then
---
Goonswarm will be just fine they have a capital umbrella they know how to use  d scan everybody needs to calm down and go back to work mine on
---
R1- something
---
I was actually the best man for a guy's wedding I met through Eve. 
---
Pretty much across the country from me - so I get what you're saying, and totally agree! Haha
---
Also, who needs fun when u have spreadsheets in space!?
---
Most modern cards can handle a 1080p screen very easy. Even 2 screens with 4 clients should be ok.
---
no u
---
What is this blackout? What's going on in eve lately? Unsubbed for a few months
---
Until you backstab em and leave laughing maniacly
---
I think the better way is dock the Rorq, bring Orca instead and all Titan brings with them 1 MD, change all weapond slots into miner II. When enemy come refit again
---
Thanks. 
---
Appreciate that most modern cards will manage it, but I’m looking for card specs. 
---
Will a RX570 manage it easily or should I look to manage it with something like a 2060 to make sure it has all the power it needs and then some?
---
Just buy the caldari one that should still be cheap
---
Even if the hunters PvP each other it's still a win
---
The whole cap thing is very odd to me, given that there was a 100% secure route for caps to use and abuse. Very few people would actually need back and forths to move stuff back then, and all of them should have been able to use their own cyno alt to get back to fade. It simply wouldn't have been a good use of anyone's time.
---
Not the mama!
---
You don't need any nvidia 20XX cards as RTX will be pointless in EVE.
---
 I would recommend buying what you can afford. If you get a good monitor 100 hz+ then a card that can sync the screen refresh does a lot for how good a game looks. 
---
I looked at what you paid for CPU and Board so a 2070 would be overkill. I run a 1070 , 2k and 1080 screens. 3 clients at a time on the 2k no issue, watch movie or whatever on the other.
---

If only there were groups of people that used wormholes and are used to hunting in no local environments
---
i used to, but the upper level types cracked down on red alts....
---
I guess it appeals more for newbies, to learn how to mine or rat. Also its more relaxing than pvp. Plus the occasional snipers that watch :)
---
but you're not the one that has to keep the sex gates fueled
---
This is exactly what I’m after and very similar to what I will do: a few clients, streaming sport and watching a movie or Netflix. 
---
Thanks heaps.
---
&gt; Accepting ISK donations in the meantime :)
---
hey, whaaddaya know, me too!
---
All good mate, enjoy. Also don't break your budget, you can turn down  a few features in ever for performance and the game still looks fantastic.
---
i can killz dumb miners to deny wormholers kontent?

We don't need Alan North or Alan Thicke coming down to null whenever they want. Damn canadians

Now the challenge is between Team Red and Team Green, or more precisely, RX5700 or the GTX1660ti. 
---
5700 blows the 1660ti in benchmarks but you certainly pay for that (about AU100). 
---
Decisions decisions.
---
The actual reason is that drone proteuses are shit, and the stratios can't covert cyno
---
so true it hurts
---
It’s all on youtube too.

---
Enjoy your day!
---
It isn't.
---
Clients aren't made aware of data like that. Just like cloakies aren't loaded at all in other clients.
---
Cool this isn't the third time in a couple hours this was posted
---
Get some spreadsheet software, or use the google one, and do some calculations.  Margins are pretty tight, or negative on a lot of stuff.  Just remember to calc before doing a profit run.  If you're savvy learn how to import price and other data from esi to make calcs easier.
---
His comment is entirely an "if" that isn't.
---
The delayed local doesn't provide clients with the names of those in the system in any form.
---
I looked at r/eve once and died
---
That was really well done.
---
It's still a benefit.
---
Dscan isn't perfectly repeatable. There is an enforced gap.
---
At a minimum you'd also still have 60 seconds to get oriented to the bot before it could know you are there.
---
Much better than before.
---
The movies came afterwards, 5 or 6 years iirc. The show was taken off air because the humor was 'too complicated' for the American audience according to the network execs at the time apparently :)
---
Since none of the PI that moves through the program ever touches the open market that is not surprising.
---
Fun to see people "proposing" ideas but really just whining to get back their free intel.
---
The defense still has the favor. This is just some more balance.
---
If you hunt in the same ships as the bots, then they won't know you from other ratters...
---
Also then friendly people in other ships may trigger the dock up.
---
Definitely less efficient.
---
This would also make the bots less efficient. Friendly would trigger it.
---
Presumably common ratting ships would be exempt, but then bot hunters could also just use ratting ships to hunt.
---
The final stand of Atlas and the Ghost of Pandemic Legion.
---
So there once was a man named Bobby Atlas, he liked chicken, and running an alliance full of warm bodies.  Bobby had carved out a huge section of the south for his mighty empire and lived in a castle on a hill surrounded by his servants.
---
One day an angry Russian decided Bobby was living in his house so he cursed the land and summoned an angry spirit, manifesting in the form of the forces of a very young Pandemic Legion, who set about the countryside pillaging and murdering the lowly serfs.  Cult of War, Honorable Templum of Alacedonia (honestly fuck you if this is spelled wrong) were put to the sword, crucified on the lanes of the streets that led to Bobby's mighty city on the hill.  He was forced to watch, trapped in his holy city as the countryside around him slowly burned inward, the smell of his inevitable fate carried to him daily on the wind.
---
Finally the heathens were at the gates, prowling his actual city, with a Russian monster on their heels he called everybody into his mighty fortress and closed the gates.  The forces that be decreed that Eve was still shit under strain back then and at that very moment with so many people packed into the might city....
---
Local broke.
---
Atlas couldn't see hostiles.  They had no idea how many people were outside the city, and every scout they sent out exploded under concentrated artillery fire, head counts seemed impossible as the overkill was intense.
---
For 10 hours the ghost of the Legion held the forces of Atlas in their mighty castle waiting for the inevitable timer that came with the dawn (and the russian time zone).  Theres too many outside Bobby told his men, we'll just wait for morning, after all the Dancul had been unleashed in the games first ever sighting of a tracking titan and the Legion just mopped up all his allies right?
---
Dawn came and the server reset itself from shitting its pants, shedding its cleansing light on the truth: His several thousand man alliance had been, in the dark, scared of 15 tired weary Arty Mach pilots perched just outside the gates of his castle.
---
He was furious.  
---
As he opened the gates to vent his wrath, he was undone, as the russian horde logged in and shit on his chest.
---
Then he went and got chicken and was never seen or heard from again.
---
Yup, humans have a much much much longer list of if&gt;then statements
---
Sounds like your internet sucks
---
It favors defence more that they don't know a sabre is cloaked in their site, instead of having ~10s to warp out?
---
I mean in general.
---
The defenders still have the advantage, by a long shot.
---
This change itself benefits the hunters, as it should. Nobody really needed that pointed out. That's literally the intent.
---
We were talking about a certain tactic used to bubble ratters, not generalities
---
What, there is something else to do in Eve besides shitalk in local?
---
ThunderED is also not the most entry-level friendly application to setup. It's very powerful, but it comes at a price. Need a more powerful VM too.
---
we weren't even talking about that
---
Can confirm no problems on Ryzen 5 2400g running 4 accounts.
---
Do you know how hard it is to prove a player is using a bot? Also the time and man power to watch the account to make the call. Its not that they did the least amount its just a waist of resources to have your people trying to be online cops. So this is the solution they came up with. "The weals turn slow but they do turn"
---
Sounds like someone forgot to train acceleration control 5...
---
&gt;Damps would not have prevented me from killing the sabre
---
Depends on what you were flying and how the sabre was flying. A keres can get assault frigs down to about a 6k lock

I know it would be easier if they didn't have a single person doing the job...
---
That's not shotgunning... That's your typical dscan maneuver.  The term shotgun was coined to describe multiple ships randomly warping to as many sigs in system as possible, just like a "shotgun" shell going off.
---
Ill give you that one
---
I don't have time to deal with adolesence.

&gt;Not really a shotgun but the idea is the same - pick a random fhub and hope its the correct one.

&gt;  maintain my point that rolling fleets of rorqs parked on rocks doesn't increase player numbers either.
---
No one is arguing this, or at least I never mentioned it, so I don't know why you keep bringing it up. All I'm say is, that as a matter of established, recorded fact, B-R had no measurable effect in player numbers after 3 months. I'm not saying this as the usual r/eve unfounded assertion. I'm saying that CCP themselves told us that there was a large spike in interest in the week or so after B-R, which mostly dissipated after the first month and was below the level of statistical variation after three.

Newbro friendly groups like Brave, TEST and indeed goons are vastly more effective long term subscription builders than big media events.

I enjoy these stories from before I started playing Eve. It's like the Age of Heroes from mythology.

ORLY?
---
I have a metric shitload (300 + runs iirc) of Curse BPCs lying around for *years* that I havn't built out because doing so was a 10 mil loss per hull.
---
 I don’t really see how this is a big issue. Alot of krabbed systems are small for the reason that it takes less time to warp to the next combat sites. Very often there are multiple krabs in one system. Even more often there are blues flying around/through the system. What happens if these pop up on the d-scan? If for every ship that showed up on d-scan the bots would dock up, they aren’t going to make much isk at all.
---
"  just like a "shotgun" shell going off. " but you missed the part that mattered.
---
The UK price not been updated since Britexit ect so your mate is the one getting a good deal. The UK price should be closer to what you are paying.
---
AKA hush you before they charge me an extra 2 quid a month per account.
---
Boson at 100km? That will accomplish what exactly?
---
TIL that small gang pvp is being 70km off your targets and randomly clicking in space while not being able to hit anything
---
well, you can still jam the logi wing.
---
if you're later to the grid and the other fc misses you you can jam the some of the dps wing and hopefully remove a few ships for a few cycles from shooting your side.
---
You can sacrifice a blackbird to save a carrier
---
Theres lots of things you can do except be super oppressive in small gangs where one ship locks out the entire other gang.
---
I've been trying to come up with a good answer to your question. This is what I got, Nothing is wrong with AFK mining ratting. In fact keep it up that's how we get most of our kills. Thank you.
---
Remember when CCP nerfed Titans and all the titan pilots said they'd quit?
---
Sure seemed like there were still plenty of titans around.
---
your best bet is to find other players who will teach you, which is abundant in this game. the retention rate for people that dont find a corp in the first month is like 10%. the retention rate for people who find a group is way higher.
---
It’s not about whether groups take fights - all respectable C5 groups will fight, its more about strategies that work on-paper but are risky to try (vs just bringing Leshaks).
---
Tip: if you are cluttering. Do it good. Anchor mobile frpots everywhere in inner hell wh space. :-)
---
Oh fuck did we move?
---
Great start! After looking through code, there are some ideas, however:
---
1. If we stick to WPF, consider switching to MVVM and bindings early. This should make code cleaner and easier to maintain in the future.
---
2. I don't see any sense of using material design theme in the app. It could be useful on a small screen, i.e. mobile, but this is an Eve companion program, therefore it will run alongside game client, only on a desktop OS. And this theme wastes a lot of screen space.
---
3. Thank you for not using Javascript and Electron in particular! \^\_\_\_\_\^
---
And a fuck ton of ships including a super.
---
And all the salt.
---
Haha dont get me wrong. My business is solo pvp  - but it would be sad if that wouldnt be possible anymore....

It works on low dual boxing on my surface pro 3 i5 with 4gb ram.

They are not really quitting, 1/2 of them will have over 6 months sub still left and will be over it by the time they need to resub.

Dscan can not see cloackers.  
---
In WH, the moment you see T3C in Dscan, it means you already tackled.
---
I mean, how many botter doing it in WH?  
---
Botters can use scout on gate. Yeah. tho that means another toon not making isk and watching the door instead.  
---
In WH, you collaps the door. Even by that, not many sane guy bot in it.  
---
Not to mention you can log off trap and camp the place. Also, this is nullsec, not WH, meaning blops gonna be come, destroy and gone in an instant.

This means botters gonna need to start building AI that smart enough to PVP.

&gt;DeMichael Crimson is the prophet of standings, having grinded all 4 player factions to over 8.0, which takes a lot of careful work.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;https://forums.eveonline.com/t/faction-standing-repair-plan-aka-the-plan/8008
---
Wow brother, thanks and yeah, it was definitely a lot of work to get the Empire Faction Standings up high. Since then I've been messing around with building up Pirate Factions and Thukker Tribe so my standings have taken a little hit. I needed to have high Empire standings first to act as a buffer before I started working on Pirate standings.
---
Currently there's 23 different Factions in Eve, however standings are only applied to 20 of those Factions. Rogue Drones, Drifters and Triglavians currently don't register standings in-game but CCP will probably change that sometime in the future, especially since they're going all out with this new Invasion expansion content.
---
Out of the 20 different Factions that standings apply to, I currently have positive standings with 16 of them. Due to the Epic Arcs and Cosmos Agents, I've already raised Angel, Guristas and Thukker Tribe Factions to positive standing and will soon have Sansha and The Syndicate Factions positive as well. Currently the only Pirate Factions that will cause any problems for me are Blood Raiders and Serpentis. Raising standings with them will cause my Concord standings to drop, that's something I don't want since there's no way to gain standing with Concord and more importantly, they control high sec systems.
---
Soo, after many years of working on gaining positive standings with all Factions, I can say without a doubt that currently there's just no way available in-game to gain positive standings with all Factions. Most can be made positive but not all.
---
You need 26, 31, 51 and 61.
---
If people move out of null they need to get some cajones. Basically null just becone a new bathtub wormhole. ( We are playing a submarine game ).
---
There is not alot of difference between them
---
The gates are static exits. The wormholes are that suddenly appear are the mobile ones.
---
You need to regular d-scan. 
---
Krabbing can still be done. Wormholers are more krabbers than null and are more secure than any null apacw because of it. They make in C5 and C4 a bill / hour easy. Thats ten times in null. 
---
Pvp as well. There is no need to got LS.

---
Amen.
---
Right i always forget about the implicit 1 before skills and modules.
---
Yes!! Now is the best time to start playing! There is a bunch of ship happening currently with the black out, PvE, events, all kinds of stuff. 
---
On top of all of that the promotions/specials for joining can propel you forward pretty fast. The game is free to play (though of course you have the F2P limitations) but if you do it right you can start off in Eve with a bunch of SP and some Omega time. Currently there is:
---
* 750k SP for using a recruitment link (use your favorite streamer, a friend, or someone who you would be interested in helping out because they get perks for you using their code).
---
* 1 Million SP as well as some other cool stuff for the $5 DLC pack in the account management section. 1M SP is a lot, especially for $5. Ontop of that you get a booster that gives you a very nice boost to damage output as well as some attribute points that make training faster
---
* Twitch Prime just ended, but if that comes up again you can get the Twitch Prime trial for free by getting Amazon Prime trial for free, or pay the $5 something dollars for Twitch Prime. The Twitch Prime loot was 150k SP and 12 or 15 days of Omega. Sadly this ended on July 9th, however it could come back.
---
* I'm not sure what the secret is, but one of the new accounts I started recently had a half off deal for 30 days of Omega that was from an in game link after logging on for the second time. 
---
All in all, to give you an example, I started a brand new account using my own recruitment link and started day 1 with 2.3M skillpoints (with would normally take about 2 months to get) and 45 days of Omega time for $12 (free Amazon trial to get the Twitch Prime loot).
---
Seriously, I know so many people that have been playing for like two years and done way more than the 8+ years I played.
---
It doesn't really. CCP just does pointless stuff like this or nerfing this or that to mollify the people who loudly and constantly bitch about things and to look like they're doing "something". 
---
Just like when the c0p$ go on TV to brag about their latest drug but..."Hey taxpayers! Look and be impressed at this big pile of cash and guns, that's actually only 1% of whats moving in this city" or raiding some titty bar or massage parlor. They do it because suckers buy into it.
---
Just more bullshit.
---
Me after now 5 years playing Eve. Still dont know if fun. Still dont know why iam playing this .... thing.

Change your PC??? Wow you mean somebody might have to spend $20 to buy a 15 year old machine to run a 15 year old game on??? That'll learn em!
---
Well yeah, it's a surface pro lol
---
they're over 400mil in jita right now. build em, become rich
---
Great article, you could perhaps expand a bit on some stuff into terms none eve players would understand.
---
Huh I didn’t actually consider a shield tank, it does leave a tonne of space for DDAs though. I was thinking running a neut or nos setup with a plate but yours looks pretty sweet
---
Yeah but drifters kill you for sure. Its doesnt matter if ur afk or very actively playing. They point you in 1 sec 100km range and do 5000+dps. Theres nothing "good" about this. 
---
Was hunting botters in detroid - warped to wrong  site - dead in 2 secs to drifters sitting there
---
&gt; Ah yes, the old 'Kor Azor' pipe crew

  Flew with that mob briefly- We'd get so excited to score a single kill. And yes, I flew a shit fit drake.

let it go
---
You have no idea how drunk i was when i started to code it.     
---
When i sit to it yesterday i had to change most of the variables to ... less eve-offensive.     
---
Like half of the tool is still full of strange stuff but i didn't have time to adjust it.                           
---
If i have some time i will probably do it better.        
---
Initially it was meant to be only for dscan - and like when i was coding the part to restrict only dscan scans i noticed that i can also use it for local, cargo scans or system anomaly scans ... and all work - sure you can mix those scans and get bit strange results - but my current idea is to not impose restrictions that will annoy people. Why they need to click to reset, change scans if just one scan is "wrong" and when you copy next scan of new type it works ok.               
---
Currently what i want is to get the id/icon list from CCP assets somewhere so i can use it in the tool.         
---
This will also allow create readable grouping of items letting to also show summary "50 Battlecruisers".               
---
This + cleaning up the tool will be the base that i will wait for user input to build reasonable requirements .          
---
There is plenty of web tools around doing the same stuff, and my current goal is to have something much simpler and much faster that runs locally and don't have to connect anywhere.            
---
^(not that giving ability to send a "post" is not something to be considered)
---
That was a good fight, was afk and heard alpha shouting over the unworn headset. Quickly got suit and booted, grabs my bb requirements and then some in kills. 
---
Cannot remember if this is the one that also had a fucking thanny mango the jump bridge and die before we could even hop back over the regional gate. The amount of "use your brain plx" pings we had was crazy but were all for good reasons.

I just haven't heard a coherent argument for why I'm wrong.
---
But they aren't just getting them in position, they are making sure everyone sees them there which is the AFK cloaky camp-shut-down-a-system strategy. And why are they more useful now with blackout?
---
But no actual answer. If they are here to light covert-cynos why are they not yet doing so?
---
Depending how many things you have on the dscan, also history will be fun thing to have.    
---
I noticed new bomber then 2 t3 and on next scan again a bomber.     
---
Was it the same type like on a first scan?
---
This is one of those that will go down in history :-)
---
*laughs in content*
---
They also start with 350 to 450k sp in pretrained skills.

If you do this, also buy the meteor pack from ccps website, trips all three rewards for the referer

Thats not even cringe, what youre doing here is meaty cringe.

Eve needs it for obvious reasons, so you can exchange every kind of data to check every aspect of the game

There will be surely some issues with privacy, but nothing you can't fix it with a tiny note on the EULA.
---
The fact you had to had "Invasion" says a lot about the state of the game prior to that
---
CCP could just run a search for clients activating dscan every server tick for 5+ hours at a time. 
---
I have no idea if that's possible but would be a pretty good way to catch bad bois
---
&gt;gplv3
---
this is the correct license.
---
If that’s your tactic then don’t worry about anything but dps. You dscan warp and tackle and they facemelt, as long as they have enough tank to handle being primary for a bit then they will be fine. You don’t even need to worry too much about webs and the like. Shield fit, max tank/max dps and a scram for good measure. A Merlin would be perfect.
---
bots reduce the relative value of whatever thing they create
---
botting rorquals deflates minerals, making virtually everything in eve (that is built with minerals) cheaper and effectively increasing the purchasing power of isk
---
botting ratting inflates isk, making everything in eve cost more
---
both of these kinds of botting increase the cost of plex by consuming it, but bot ratting increases it twofold
---
I'll find a WH and use the back door. Then probably die because I'm objectively bad at pvp :p

posting about a single super kill at this point makes you an attention whore and nothing more.

I'm talking about the pros people bitch about, not the casuals..oh and by the way, at one point I literally did have a basement filled with PCs. All fully operational. Got em cheap at auction. Good old days before too many people found out about auctions, including the formerly tech ignorant auction houses. Now the good shit is plucked before it ever comes up.
---
Hmmm just off the top of my head, from what I've read about the matter, had I been interested, I could have automated 300-3000 accounts. The pros clearly know much more about it someone who just did casual research to see what everyone was bitching about.
---
If you want to keep believing something can be done about the pros help yourself.

What's step 4?

Lol all of my setups are a straight line on extractor planets, and a weird hexagonal shape on production planets.

---
Both look good but you should swap to t2 where you can be meta where you can't.
---
I honestly think they should be brought down from such stupidly high levels. Like + 10 for a super and +20 for a Titan.
---
Why a super has 25 extra warp core strength is beyond me.
---
Nice video as always!
---
I will win next time we fight! lol
---
See what the most killed stuff is on zkill, checkout the profit for it, build it, sell it...
---
Go to the Angels regions and you should find more sites due to their (comparatively) low payouts.
---
you can always check out but you can never leave
---
I consistently make 20-30% profit manufacturing and selling in highsec. Some stuff I have even managed 100% profit...

They are still completely different - j-space local was only a small part of the differences between wormholes and nullsec. Here is a few examples:
---
1. Nullsec has static gates, and thus geography
---
2. Cynos work in nullsec
---
3. You can't roll nullsec gates
---
4. Supercapitals can be found in nullsec
---
5. You don't have to worry about fleet mass
---
6. No system effect in nullsec
---
7. Infinitely respawning anomalies, both combat and ore
---
8. The average player group is about 10 times as large, and there's 10 times as many of them
---
9. Anomalies are vastly easier compared to most WH anomalies (C3 and higher)
---
10. Doctrines commonly used in fleet combat are completely different
---
11. NS has ADM 
---
12. NS has sovereignty
---
Recons everywhere :)
---
Pretty sure before Kakao bought it they don't do these things anymore
---
Wormhole space has the ability to roll holes. 
---
Nullsec has cynos and supercaps.
---
Just go do it in high sec it's very easy to pick up no risk either.
---
13. No asset safety. that's a big deal
---
Jams the carrier
---
Yes OK buddy
---
Indeed.
---
A Hecate will die to a solo ratting ship. They are good for killing pvp ships, but a half decent ratter will kill you if you don’t warp out, and a good fit will neut you dry have a point fit to an extra mid slot.
---
Best advice I can give is focus on a fighting style (brawler, kiter, etc) and research T1 fits that excel at that style.
---
http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page is a good site to find basic fittings, you can then adjust as you learn.
---
Buy like 10 or 20 of the fitting you like, go to Low Sec and lose them.
---
....How would I be the attention whore here?
---
All I said is that the drifters did accomplish things.
---
Hence 5/10
---
Jump in join Eve University right away (other starter corps are available) most give out free starter ships and skill books. Join their fleets get blown up learn from it rinse and repeat get the skills needed to fly effectively. Once you have tried all different areas of space join a Corp that you suites your play style and hang round in Corp chat complaining about how Eve is broken.
---
Some random C4 corp nobody's heard about said they were going to evict us
---
What are the odds they’re actually being accepted and not recruitment scammed?
---
\- Stable network of jump gates (and the added benefit of ansiblex jump gates for sov null) vs rolling statics / wandering wormholes (so different logistics, hunting techniques etc)
---
\- Cynos
---
\- I think there are no valuable moons in WHs
---
\- IHUB upgrades in sov null
---
\- No caps in lower class wormholes
---
\- Different PI and Gas
---
\- Ratting for 'ticks' vs blue loot (both inflationary thouth)
---
\- Different drifter mechanics (in high-class WHs you can spawn a drifter battleship in combat sites, which will roam the system if not killed, in 0.0 there are now groups of drifters randomly spawning and attacking structures / players)
---
\- Different asset safety rules and citadel reinforcement windows. You can kill a citadel much faster in WHs (couple of days I think) and there's no asset safety as in 0.0, so everything inside the citadel will drop in cans after the citadel is blown up.
---
I guess there are more that I didn't mention. In any case, no local in NS doesn't equate NS to WH space, especially sov NS.
---
Got an ad delivery job lined up that starts on the 20th actually
---
Tool? Pfft if you're not d scanning by muscle memory already you're doing it wrong.
---
I'd imagine you're selling outside of Jita? Or manufacturing something especially technical.
---
If you're making that profit outside of Jita, I'd wager you could probably just be making that profit by trading instead of even bothering with manufacturing.
---
If you can't produce below Jita price, then you aren't adding value in the manufacturing process.
---
Seems that expired on the 9th and I only heard about it yesterday.
---
What do u expect from CCP it's an existing mechanical script in play and they don't know how to invent anything new. But if they are following the same event as the wormholes shouldn't also be cyno jammed and covert jammed as well while this is happening only makes sense otherwise it's nothing new and just like cloaky camping
---
Okay then, that's fine.
---
Just don't want to support a bad habit like EVE for the unemployed.
---
I think povar is bored with no one in dura logging in

Its about the store, not your account settings.

guess what: you can do PVE without having a standing fleet as backup.

LS still has local and DEDs are still gates...sooo

Pearl Abyss isn't owned by Kakao.

...the solution has been there all the time: bring stront timers back
---
Lol where is that scene from?
---
Nope, jita, just ordinary t2 modules. Nothing special, it's all timing. The profit is in watching trends.
---
Good read.
---
/me flies a curse... cant see me :D
---
log out in system?
---
Some say The Orange is still out there, haunting local in TTP-2B.
---
Even if they can ... there is no issue with that ... lets assume you're in a ceptor warping to a site with like 5AU/s ... even if he clicks the MOMENT you enter his 14,3AU scan range, then he only got so much time left to react and warp out ... and the ships agility needs to allow him to warp out.
---
So i wouldn't be concerned too much about it.
---
Local Bots = OP ... d-scan bots = "try to warp before i land little Bot"
---
Aaand this is why no local is good.
---
Originally they had infinite warp core strength and could only be  stopped from warping by doctors and hics.
---
That’s insane! I guess they had different purposes back then.
---
Given how common they are now, lowering it down a bit seems like a good move.
---
all this does not take away from the simple fact that it's tedious busy work that distracts from actual player interactions.
---
and guess what: most smaller groups (including myself) hate this change as well. you can't take out anything that's not cloaky anymore or your expensive roaming gang gets glassssed.
---
No, they wont
---
Ratting in a cap will look the same as now.
---
Ratting in a subcap will just use cheaper ships because slightly lower ticks are better than the payouts after splitting bounties.
---
it's about putting bodies on the moon to mine the minerals. we didn't have anyone willing to sit in a barge, they all rather shoot players.
---
Ahh intrepid crossing, soo long ago
---
Sorry, there's not a chance that will happen.

i for one, am not stupid enough to think that i can predict what this change might bring. it's a real big shake up and the consequences are not foreseeable.

Then you can shoot a fuck load farther than 8 KM

That

&gt;Then you can shoot a fuck load farther than 8 KM

8KM is the range of my warp scrambler.
---
Here's another fun super fact: fighters used to just be big drones, so carriers and supercarriers could just deploy regular drones which 100s would fit in the space of one fighter.
---
I usually don't watch these frig vids, but your commentary and fun attitude made this very enjoyable to watch!
---
Why would it?
---
So... What's the significance of this post exactly? I don't get it.
---
No Rancer, Miroitem, Tama and BWF-ZZ are still going to demand daily ship sacrifices and manifest zkill entries.
---
Had that happen with a little farm Corp in a C5.
---
  We rolled into their hole, maybe 8 of us at the time. 2 prospects and 3 ventures on D-scan.  We combat scan him down and as we warp in, he’s warping out with all 5 accounts. At the time it was unknown to us that it was one guy so we ask for a gentlemen’s brawl at the sun in local and tell them we will bring the same number of pilots. One person responded in the biggest reeeeeee carebear way you could. He claimed we were ruining his record, we should be sorry for interrupting him. So we said fuck this dude, we logged in alts and started huffing the 540 at the sites he cleared. He didn’t like it too much and went on super rage mode rant asking us how attached to the hole next door we were as he brought out caps. By then the sites were almost empty so we decided to leave. Well he managed to get a scanner in and in the next few days got a carrier and would roll our connects out of our prime time. A day or two later we catch him, in a bling fit legion, as well as a bling fit tengu. Got both pods, the total for all was around 6-7 billion. He then gave up and sold us the archon he was using for cheap as hell. 
---
TL;DR:  Guy got mad we stopped his krabbing, tried to evict a Corp with 15x his numbers. Failed and lost billions. Got a carrier delivered for free, Hull was cheap.
---
i got burned out from our C2-NS hunting and went for a High Class holiday in REHO, back to the roots, in one month I enjoyed 4 heavy armor brawls, each of them lasting at least 30min

Just sub one account and never look at plex, works great, fuck grinding for gametime
---
Buy a cheap ship and go PVP in lowsec, you can warp to Faction warefare plexes and camp them. Try novice first.
---
You can kill plenty of things without pointing them, also you're in a stealth bomber why are you using scram when most things can kill you if they get a scram on you?
---
Browsing through the source code:
---
"Have you heard about lack of lowsec gate to Stain?"
---
"namespace LowsecGateToStain.Properties {"
---
and of course the project is named LGTS internally, which stands for Lowsec Gate To Stain
---
Hey, one of the developers would love to get in touch with you to help identify the cause of the issue. Can you submit a support ticket by emailing [support@eveonline.com](mailto:support@eveonline.com) and direct message me the ticket number. I can then put you in touch with the developer. Thanks.
---
So you opted to use no alt combinations? Seems very inefficient.
---
Drag net or police squad I think
---
eve is full of minmaxers dude. supercaps will stay in the sanctums and havens, carriers will remain in the havens, and subcaps will shift to Myrms for mass afk running fhubs or rally pts, Ishtars for active/able to fight off and in either havens or fhubs, and domis in fhubs or havens for afk sentry shenanigans.
---
Have fun being cought in the gatecamp.
---
Easy to make a bad sandbox but probably a masterwork to keep it in check with quality and balance, I'm sure.
---
You have  tried nullblocks, hisec and solo. Looks like wormholes is next for you.
---
I wonder why no one makes bots that swarm attackers. 
---
Or bots that can gatecamp. That would be scary.

Pretty sure t2 mining drones will outmine a hulk. Rorqs will still be the go to ship.
---
&gt;You can kill plenty of things without pointing them, also you're in a stealth bomber why are you using scram when most things can kill you if they get a scram on you?
---
My thinking is that I'm hunting PvE ships, and they are likely to try to warp, and less likely to have their own point. So I'm hoping that I can pick battles that are favorable and leave battles that aren't.

Next build related question. 
---
What response time for monitors to people find best? I’ve read that there is no noticeable ghosting at 5ms. 
---
Thanks.
---
&gt; How is damage synced then? When you fire a weapon, the game must tell whether or not you hit, how much damage you dealt, then update the state of both your target and your client with that information. Is that also done without transmitting data? If so, how?
---
Damage is calculated client-side then the final hp lost is transmitted. I was referring to navigational information, which is only transmitted when a ship's "Move mode" (eg orbit approach etc) changes. 
---
&gt; But if you were using a data structure that was mapped by known distances you wouldn't even need to check objects outside the dscan range; the loop would stop the moment the n objects were checked.
---
Yup, if grids were distinctly organised by range then this could probably be possible for player ships. Non player things however, don't really exist on grids. They are created and removed when players arrive/leave.
---
&gt; But if you really wanted to change how dscan works to make it avoid lagging the servers for some gameplay reason, I'm 100% confident you could do so. 
---
Oh absolutely, the blessing and the curse of software development is that almost anything is possible (unless you're hitting up against some sort of physical limit of the universe like the speed of light), everything comes down to a question of effort/value.
---
Haha, yeah right, like you actually took a shower...

---
All that sounds pretty balanced, we only need another nerfbat applyed to the Rorqual's head.
---
When you agress someone but between your aggro and the target's death you reshipped the killmail shows your new ship with the previous weapon you used. I once got a kill with light missiles in a Stratios, something like that.
---
why? you press a button and get a result. you can even pinpoint via angle and distance. its working pretty well. id only love less anoms showing up in the probe scanner but dscan is fine.
---
The rorqual isn't really the issue. Excavators are.
---
Hey guys I gor wife aggro, can I get a PAPs for this drunken camp? We've been watching the same chick shuffling for hours and I think I'm done.

Hi.

This is my new squad that's moved into the area. We're trying something new and daring, with full blessing from Mittens and the rest of the Goon Ubermensch.
---
Covert Krabbing. The idea was to covertly infiltrate enemy space and mine and rat under their noses while they are in Delve hunting us. It's the last thing they'd expect and pretty genius on my part. I'm pretty sure that many shoulders have been dislocated from high fiving about this, I personally fractured my coccyx with self congratulation. If you know what I mean and I'm sure you do.
---
But all this is ruined now, thanks for outing us and making me look like you in front of Jay, whom I am so ever 4 gay. 
---
Let's go home lads.
---
I half disagree. You're correct in that you're playing "wrong" if your only goal is isk/hour efficiency, but at the end of the day if he's genuinely having fun popping NPC rats or mining in highsec, I wouldn't want to use the word "wrong". Just inefficient.
---
eh in delve/eso/malpais you're probably right. outside of that, probably 1-2 rorqs and an army of exhumers, cheaper to lose I guess.
---
rorquals are fine, except for the stupid PANIC module that shouldn't exist. At least make it like a damn ADC instead of complete invulnerability.
---
I'm expecting to see ratting haw dreads, ticks are marginally less in a haven, but more in ring sanctums. Don't know about most people, but I'd rather have a gang warp in on my haw dread than a standard carrier when I don't expect it.

Why even post this?

That would make it very hard to take over regions if you're from a different timezone. After successfully attacking on their time zone you now have to defend your structures - still on *their* time zone. Only after a while, the timers would finally flip to your time zone.

as far as i know and i'm not up to date on bots, there are two different types.  the older types are screenscrapers, that basically take a screenshot of the screen ever second or so and then look for certain things in the screen, e.g. the name of an anom or site.  Then in uses simple gui interface tools to direct the mouse to click on what it finds.  you can google instructions to program these.  try something like "online flash games python cheat".  These bots however, don't work that well and aren't really used that much (from what i hear). 
---
The other type is the memory reading bots that pull the information not from a screenshot, but from what is stored on your pc.  these are basically derivatives of https://github.com/Arcitectus/Sanderling
---
more complicated, but i don't think they are that hard once you get the hang of it.

Doctor:you have 3 minutes break  I:watching and hear this song  Doctor:you have again 3 minutes break  I:its ok and I hear and watching this song

They'd be OP as hell
---
Imagine a tackling interceptor, but you literally have zero way of preventing it from catching you.
---
The thing with tackle ceptors, is that once they jump in a system with targets, they actually have to use the time when they are cloaked by the jump to pin down something they can tackle for their main fleet using DSCAN. This give time for aware targets to GTFO, and retarded targets get caught. But now, with Blackout rolling out today, they'd be zero way of knowing if you have an interceptor coming your way until it's too late, as it won't show up in Local, and won't show up on DSCAN too.
---
Bad bad idea.
---
Depends if they believe the changes will be healthier for the game long-term, because it is clear the system they have now isn't working and many believe it is safety which makes the game boring. 
---
I personally know of 6-9 players coming back specifically because of the black out. So all the haters might need to log out just to prevent the numbers from increasing.
---
Catch is gonna burn. Intact armor plates must be much more expensive after two weeks of cloaky sabres in each relic.
---
Quality!
---
Multiple people would love that, as POS allowed for a more nomad play style, compared to citadels and the week required to anchor them.
---
On another note, we might see small citadels taking the place of solo owned POS soon. The Astrahus being the smallest citadel currently available is still classed as a medium-sized structure, which mean we might see a level below that for solo or nomad people.
---
And I don't think Mobile Depots and MTUs count as small structures, maybe micro sized.

---
We have a little op area un LS. It's pretty fun actually.
---
War can be declared and a lot of fights around a single moon, or areas of lvl5 missions. Doing minning OP, takes time and planning. (We roll every WH on the pocket/constelation. Set up a Nice gate camp on Gates. Had a response fleet ready, etc)
---
If the most little groups leave Null to LS. Can be a lot of pew pew and the best moons will be war objetives. (If Null start their economic attack to Low/high. Even more)
---
They have to hit you with Dscan. Many systems are larger than Dscan range, even to a gate. If they are really on top of it and are dscanning all entry points, and you can't find a WH in/around, you just plant a cloaky in the system and wait for the bots to reset.
---
Who did this 🤣🤣🤣🤣

FW plexes needs to be reworked so people need to use actual fitted ships to defend them; it needs a good/unique way of income besides FW missions (like BPCs for Pirate subcaps dropping there); FW need a massive overhaul (how Tiers work at least, suitonia did an amazing post about it some months ago).
---
Probably more related to ESI being down. Not sure if intended.
---
Fucking crab

That and the MPTC. Those are still down at 1.4-1.6 versus a 2bil plex.

hey /u/wollari

great track also like disturbed cover, not as good but still worth a listen.

Squizz is a good man

I mean, it's boring and clicking it regularly is pretty much the definition of busy work? It could be turned into something a bit more entertaining or interactive.

Buy MPTCs. They are 1.4-1.6 and Plex is back to 2bil. They are definitely going to rebound.

All those A- Miner notes and E- Miner notes make me almost cry. This and the middle part of To live is to die are impressive songs.
---
works fine over here.
---
VNI prices will spike, hunters will end up fighting each other and titan's will be dropped on anything not afk that gets tackled.
---
Squizz pandering to shit memes again, well I never.
---
I thought you meant players banding together to kill bots.
---
hence i said period not event lol
---
how will the attention starved folk function?
---
90% of goons is going to dock up, if they haven't unsubbed already, judging from the previous posts here and on the eve forum :&gt;
---
But they cost a lot more than a hulk
---

---
?
---
This is fucking awesome I hope it lasts a couple days.
---
Never thought I'd say this but thank you Squizz
---
so you are bored and want dscan minigame for fun. nice...

Spod bless
---
You’d just whitelist names and have them all as long complex strings to make them difficult to replicate
---
The period may very well be forever.
---
I don't want to lose zKill, it's an amazing resource. I expect he'll be working on more tricks behind the scene to keep its functionality while limiting the immediate intel it can give.
---
LS is far more dangerous than null.
---
Is your friend using steam?
---
If so it will be £9.99, regular account will be $15 which will cost you about 12 quid.
---
I agree with the most top portions of your post, quite before you actually discussed the idea.
---
On comms
---
yes. discord blaclout next.
---
Bots will just start using Myrmidons and as long as they survive longer than an hour they'll make a profit.
---
Yeah? I mean, shouldnt the  game be designed for the subscriber and have multiboxing be optional? Have you considered the reason you are multiboxing is precisely because excel sheet game mechanics bore the living crap out of people?
---
What exactly is a recruitment scam
---
this is eve online and not a dscan minigame simulator lol
---
We're both using the standalone launcher.
---
Because they have other incredibly significant other benefits.
---
What exactly did you expect me to answer then?
---
You are in a well orgaized organisation, and I bet that in TAPI or Imperium space the warnings will be heard by most. I doubt that in Space china or in Drone Renter Lands people have the same awareness or organisation level. And even in Delve and Esoteria there are people living outside of all information channels.
---
Launcher doesn't matter you can launch steam account from standard launcher, it depends on how the account was created.
---
this is gonna be good lol
---
Reactionary gamers I swear to god... Game are meant to evolve, not stagnate. Phones are completely different today than they were when EVE launched.
---
kinda dumb imo
---
There are only 3 or 4 other posts about this.
---
In my opinion there should be a couple more because this shit is gonna be gud
---
you can spam ingame killmails throug h all channels you are in
---
I did say CCP will completely fuck it up and that will be all part of the fun.  To be fair though, my corp chat is shite and alliance chat is just a stream of fucking annoying contracts.  
---
You have to hit out of game chat for anything vaguely intelligent (I use the word intelligent in its broadest possible sense).
---
dscan is a tool inside the game. the game is evolving. the dscan tool is fine and there doesnt need to evolve. its not meant to be a fun tool but a usefull tool and works fucking well. go play project discovery or something
---
I fully expect the next announcement to be about random clusters being turned off.
---
If this is going to be a thing for nullsec, I'm going to shoot myself right away.  Either that or use a sinister auto-dscan tool that's probably against the EULA.
---
The only way to communicate will be using CCP-sanctioned emotes. The first 5 of which are unlocked by completing the activity tracker. The rest must be purchased with PLEX.
---
Bob approves
---
As long as we get to see the spicy kills after blackout.
---
It is but I was looking forward to watching the carnage unfold while at work today.
---
How will I bask in salty ratter tears without zkill!
---
I legit want to look at something and remember some fun times, please put it back soon.
---
kill the competition so you can pull some gay shit like this smh
---
I love Dorkest Dungeon but goddamn if it doesnt make me want to punch my monitor.
---
wow good post
---
Yeah no grandpa, world's gonna change. You're going to have to drop the landline sooner or later.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc-RnTE9I8w

No I didn't hear anything. Fake News.
---
Dude... D-Scan. D is for directional...
---
You don't use it for spodhunting huh?
---
Oh okay, we both made our accounts on the website.
---
hAHAHA
---
Uh Oh ... there comes the bees with demands.
---
Burn Jita for CCP
---
Burn Amarr for Squizz
---
:P
---
god shutup you don't know what you're talking about at all
---
you were talking about deportation and the relation with increased food costs
---
why not blackout r/eve as well?
---
You won't be able to see it as it happens, which is a bit of a downer. I don't think we will lose it for long though.
---
The easter egg is in the response
---
    status: 503
---
    message: Networked Capsuleer intelligence has fallen
---
It really isn't.
---
Just say **no, no one here**
---
Squizz at it again. 10/10 I love this.
---
Says the guy being reactionary? Wake up
---
I've been wishing for a big event that destroyed 1/3 (or more) of the systems in New Eden for a long time now. But we get a local blackout instead. Not that the blackout is a bad thing... but having the trigs/drifters/whatever blow up a bunch of gates to shrink the size of New Eden seems like it'd go a lot further towards increasing conflict/content
---
The attitude in this message seems very different from the last one. This doesn't seem like an event as much as a perma-change they are going to monitor and decide on based on community reaction.
---
thanks!
---
we will never know since zkb is dead.
---
Hahaha
---
put zkillboard back please. I was sharing some good memories earlier, I won't be able to do that anymore :(
---
As a PVP player I find this ridiculous! Without zkillboard there is no reason to play, and I will not be logging in for the duration of the blackout and will be unsubbing my accounts until CCP learns from there mistakes!
---
Zkillboard
---
Yep. And the market is pretty well fully stocked too. I was worried I was going to have to make an order for a ton of rigs to get my ships fit.
---
It's quiz night at my local if that helps. ?
---
Good. I expect they’ll use the new structures to bring something limited back eventually, but we should never return to full real time local.
---
The source never lies.
---
I mean maybe they were, I was only contending that if China could build a wall 1,000 years ago then it's not impossible, but all that got cut out.
---
But hey this was always a recording of a serious conversation in the first place.
---
Imagine using the word "gay" instead of "dumb" in 2019. Smh.
---
Chat doesn't have the same level of protections around it that gameplay elemenents do. How many times have we seen chat go bonkers and you are still in local chat in a system you left like an hour ago, or where people have manipulated it to not show up in local at all. We've seen those cases. It's an industry standard chat protocol, and channel listing is a standard feature, so I'm not convinced they can't query the list or that it's in memory by default and they programmed the client to hide the names rather than the server not providing that information.
---
Kinda gay comment MeesterButtss.
---
It's my corp name.
---
Good, because I personally think that zKillboard is actually bad for the game. It's used for ego stroking, and there's so much manipulation/padding of zkill. You should be blowing ships up for fun or strategic purposes, not for k/d ratio etc.
---
Not sure if bait or not. But zkill is not run by CCP. At all.
---
lmao I hope that reference is a troll
---
Hey! Let's not get carried away here.
---
Sorry you said you had issues with Low Sec. I assumed you would have said FW somewhere in your original complaint if that's all the issue was. There's a ton of Low Sec that has nothing to do with FW.
---
His best post of the entire week.
---
Imagine caring about your KB lmao.
---
Haha, dusted off my old Hub in Paradise, hope you do not drop me to dead, I am just warping around cluelessly in cheap ships ...
---
Blank title, black background, no content.
---
This is the source code of zkill:
---
 &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;\&amp;#65279;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style='background-color: black;'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
---
Are you terpila?
---
The quoted response times are always bullshit. Use independent hardware verified reviews to get detailed analysis. 
---
In terms of general speed TN &gt; IPS &gt; VA (Severe ghosting in dark shades, smearing)
---
If you got a 144hz, as long as the average response time is &lt;6.94ms you'l be good to go.
---
Connection to chat server lost
---
&gt; I expect he'll be working on more tricks behind the scene to keep its functionality while limiting the immediate intel it can give.
---
I doubt that will happen. zKill has the critical mass to keep be *the* killboard right now, but if he removes/limits any important features people will just move over to a new one. 
---
Just like people have been moving from their corp killboards, to eve-kill and eventually to zKillboard. If there's an alternative that's as reliable and provides better features, people will eventually move on.
---
:)
---
There once was a botter in Frat  
---
who didn't dare go out and rat.  
---
He cried on r/eve,  
---
said "I'm going to leave,  
---
if I can't see you in local chat".
---
That's what I meant. There is no easter egg.
---
delet r/eve tbh
---
It's deliberate.  Looks at the network headers:  message: Networked Capsuleer intelligence has fallen
---
You're smart, I like you.
---
Care free carebaring in null, also: botting, is effectively over.
---
The heads of the Rorquals will be skewered to the stargazes \[that should totally be a feature\].
---
So you just wanted free ISK. Got it. Well, your leadership did. That ISK didn't filter down to the regular players. I do understand it was used for SRP in many cases, but I guarantee a large bit of that ISK was pocketed by your leaders.
---
With these new changes, SRP can still be funded via other means (various taxes), while the members doing the work get to reap the rewards instead of funding yet another director titan alt.
---
Shitalk in Reddit about the shitalk on local.
---
Pretty sure it's in asset safety now
---
"I wAs JuSt PrEtEnDiNg To Be ReTaRdEd"
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Squizz, you'll always be our community's MVP.
---
Because there's never any intel here.
---
LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE DYIN... oh wait we can't :cry:
---
I mean, as much as I want the blackout to be exciting. I think it will be fun in different away.
---
I think Krabs are going to stay docked, for the most part, if this is only a short blackout. They can ride this out.
---
What I think will happen is more people will be out roaming and looking for Krabs. Fleets are going to bump into each other and Fight will happen. 
---
I'm sure a couple of mouth breathers will get caught, but anyone with have a head is going to dock and join the hunting fleet.
---
so I need to keep my hunting fleet at home and put bait rorqs out?
---
I’d prefer to see the kills happening .. 
---
Provi carrier down
---
Dude the entire conversation is basically a troll, just listen to it.  It's like 8 people on bacon bar joking about yerts and the civil war

Disregard, reddit is hard.
---
Though you responded to the other guy who posted the content.
---
Most of the nullsec blocs are excited, tbh. Krabs and miners will die, sure, but most players are encouraged to try new things during this "event". There will be more hunting fleets, more scouts on gates, and a lot more content in general. And the nullsec blocs have the numbers and networks to defend their territory -- it'll just be a bit more difficult now.
---
Honestly, not that many pilots are freaking out. It's a step into the unknown for many, to be sure, but not so bad.
---
So a truly awesome drunk fc kitchen sink
---
(Its bait)
---
I thought this countdown sequence is better suited to a Disaster Area concert.
---
are you in TEST or something? Aint no one going to limit my content, no thanks.
---
You're a sad little person aren't you.
---
but but but how can I hunt without having all the out of game tools?
---
You don't drop on everything that moves. You hold off for the juicy target that you; 1, have the numbers available to kill, 2, have a route to get there with via wormholes and 3, have available pilots in escalation ships if necessary.
---
Please learn how much work goes in to a drop. You obviously don't know. You think everything just gets dropped willy nilly, but it isn't.
---
But hey, nice troll.
---
Didnt fit my survey II module someone tell me is this sarcasm or salt
---
As someone who can't login this weekend thx for ruining my viewing from the sidelines u/squizz.
---
Make it so that we need to press the dscan button to reveal each comment or new post. XD
---
I think most people understood that from the first one, at least I did. This is NOT an event, it's an experiment.
---
Hordlings should always take the bait
---
The only person with a shovel here is you mate.
---
Just post screens of your kills here and it will be fine!
---
ex deee
---
that was beautiful. truly the robert frost of our generation
---
I once aligned the wrong way in my bomber and killed several allies who were very upset with me
---
Yeah not many people in this thread are getting the difference between a college debate club and 8 people shitting around in bacon bar.
---
Stop being like that, shoot everything and everyone you find out there. Always.
---
Likewise it'd be very easy to defend regions in your timezone, and even if you lost the initial battle it would still be in your timezone for a bit before flipping. Working as intended.
---
And the problem is ?
---
Imagine using the word 'little' instead of 'vertically challenged' in 2019. Smh.
---
Maybe find a new corp?
---
I've heard NJED is recruiting.
---
No, fuck off.
---
Move to null sec. Same hidey stuff, none of the collapsing holes.
---
You mean F5?
---
I can rock 3 clients, 2 at 1440p and and 1 at 1080p with a single GTX1080
---
I would suggest you try joining dedicated invasion fleets/communities if you enjoy the pve aspect and would rather not play the game alone. Or try Abyssal space, also much better isk/ph that level 4's. You can also live in null and low sec and not be required to pvp. Just need to find the right group that is laid back. 
---
What do you like doing?
---
or... is it?
---
No new structures have been yet announced.
---
I did say other very significant thing non-FW related to be honest. And really, not much else should change there other than that.
---
You should post this to r/showerthoughts knowing full well you'll probably confuse the hell out of 99.999998% of people in that subreddit.
---
I concur
---
Please don't advertise your shitty subreddit.
---
Get bent
---
1) I have some characters that basically just have 6ish mil sp with good drone skills, such as heavy drones V and/or interfacing V. How much could they go for on the market?
---
2) Are logi legions still viable? Are cloaky logi legions viable for small gangs?
---
That's just goons.. the blood thirsty beans are excited. Some have semi's and full on boners.
---
Are you drunk?  Because it already has a "Do not ask me again" checkbox on that dialog.
---
Until they realize the krabs are just sitting comfortably docked up or offline for the weekend to pass, while jumping an endless number of systems just to find a botting VNI or two...
---
I suspect activity will spike for a few days whilst ppl adapt.  Then the novelty will wear off and then it's back to normal.
---
I was referring to your character.
---
uh, there is no problem?
---
I agree, my only worry is CCP + undetermined could mean "ooooh something else shiny" and it's forgotten about
---
Yeah I'm down let's blue up and combine arms in the static haha!
---
blue donuts, now also in j-space!
---
Botting isn't over lol. They just program around it.
---
Supers are going to reap kill marks during this
---
ALMOST wish i was still playing
---
Its been pretty cool.
---
We've had alliance level instructions and corp level instructions, it is funny how its now turned the game into a far more cooperative game, previously you could afk mine and keep an eye on intel channels, now we are coordinating with friendly fleets of gate campers looking to keep hunters out of our space.
---
We've had droves of people quit (omg, if i can't triple box ratting supers, i'm not playing Eve!!!11) but those that remain will work together.

No quotas or need to train doctrines in horde. It's suggested but you don't have too.. plenty of stuff to do, just gotta ask around.

Tbh the standards on this sub is so low you can never be too sure

The last major quit wave was the 3rd iteration of carrier dps nerfs. when they were doing a 10 % dps nerf after the two previous dps and application nerfs. I remember the reeee was so loud they toned it down to 5 %.

LOL wow, you got me!

It were me
---
EVE appreciates anyone re-subbing. I'll say that.  I'll also be upfront in believing that a business model that puts the balance in favor of people that already quit against retaining the current population doesn't seem wise. I forsee a move that reaches a common ground and will probably be seen as bleh by both sides.
---
ZKill serves no purpose other than to stroke your epeen and give intel to your enemies. I hope it stays gone forever.

Havent cared about my killboard since like 2012. So i guess its free money for some notification spam

---
Krabs not playing at all. That sounds like a win. Maybe if enough leave CCP wont be afraid to update the PVP side of thing any more.
---
Krabs not playing EVE at all is the best thing that could come from this.
---
You mean Alt+D?
---
Always a possibility.
---
So they have a bunch of people in place that won't have to dodge gate camps or be seen on the gate when they enter system. Yea that is real dumb...
---
I know this, your missing the point I’m trying to make, the people that would be fine making isk in lowsec will also do just fine where they are now in null even without local. And in null they will have backup ready to help them most of the time.
---
those that can’t stay at the keyboard and keep their whits about them will find lowsec way worse than null for safety even without local.
---
I catch mission and site runners all the time all you need is a few scanning alts with clean killboards  plus a decent grasp of probes and d-scan and a interceptor or recon. people won’t get much warning because the toons that are pirates won’t appear in local till it’s pretty much too late
---
And even if you use a closely t3 to run sites and cloak up anytime someone enters local you will be harassed and pretty much forced to stand down or move on till they get bored. There is much easier isk to be made elsewhere 
---
people move to null for the infrastructure and safety you aswell as the isk making ease you will never get all of those in lowsec
---
Wouldn't a gallente rebel just be a matari?
---
While I really like your videos, I have one question that bothers me. Why do you cycle the SAAR so early? In a lot of cases it results in wasting 1, 2 or even 3 charges that could really help much more in the later stage of the fight, where you end up cycling empty repairer. If you cycle'd it later, you'd not only not waste those charges, but also if you cycle later and end up in hull, armor reps still help while you're in hull, definitely much more than when you still have full shield.
---
Booo
---
While i get that this is funny as a meme in relation to the nullsec blackout... isn't it kind of a dick move to remove a commonly used tool for anyone in highsec, lowsec and wh space because of a change that specifically affects null?
---
You are either trolling, don't play eve or are clueless.
---
So what I recommend is using two dreads. This way you can have one dread with small guns and one with large guns and finish the site + the drifter in 3 sieges i.e., 600m per 15 minutes + bookmarking.   
---
As for the REV fit I use:
---
High: 3 guns, 1 large smartbomb (named dark blood e.g.) + siege :)  
---
mid: Capital cap injector (3200), 2x fed navy tracking computer, capital cap battery  
---
Low: 2 tracking enhancers, 3 heat sinks, 2 imperial navy energized adaptives, 1 capital repper.  
---
Rigs : Capital energy metastasis adjuster t2 + capital aux nano pump t1.  
---
I think you can swap one energized adaptive out for another heat sink if you buy a more expensive hardener.  
---
Then fit the other rev identically but with HAW guns and maybe use a damage rig instead of tracking rig on that one.  
---
Now when the drifter spawns, you refit 1 heavy warp scramb and 1 disrupter instead of the tracking computers on one dread to scram the drifter.. and have target painters on the other dread on the drifter.  
---
This way I can run all C5 sites in 3 sieges (with the drifter).. Easy money.  
---
If you are planning on using one dread I can't help you but I think some people actually fit 2 haw guns and 1 large guns and maybe have one large gun in their cargo/fleet hangar for refit on the drifter.. I have never tried it though so I dont know, but now you atleast know what tank is required..  
---
P.s. if you are not aware of the bookmarking in C5 sites, check out this video:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujQNeLPd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujQNeLPd8)   
---
These bookmarks are required if you want to do the whole site + drifter in 3 sieges..as far as I am aware..  
---
p.s. a Red Giant C5 is very helpful for smartbombing the frigs.
---
Most bears will be in hibernation methinks.

Question.  Is there a way to find a wormhole close to my home in low sec that will stay open for a long time? This giving me access to consistent WH space? Or are they always moving.
---
Why did you get booted?
---
dhd has the dumbest arguments but i still love to hear him shout about nothing.
---
If you are undocked in null it should be dangerous, it should feel dangerous, you shouldn't be able to play the game while also watching tv, either watch TV or play a game. That said pve should be more engaging aswell.

Scythe Fleet Issue (missile fit). Slightly blinged but within the price range I can burn a few of them without being seriously low on ISK. I will undock from Jita at 13:00 sharp eve time.
---
No it will close after max 48 hours...but a new one will spawn after, just not the same
---
I don't know about botting, but the people in the smaller alliances don't seem to be undocking or even logging on so:  content, is effectively over.
---
The change specifically affects the whole game. FYI
---
Store the salt rations
---
More more more!
---
Is that every page or jus the home?
---
Krabs go outside into the Real World for once.
---
Mordu bs drop very rarely I’ve got a friend who runs every belt for 15-20 systems every day he’s lucky if he gets one a month, you can get the clone soldier tags but only one of them is really worth anything. 
---
and you have to be switched on belt ratters make easy targets especially if your scrammed/disrupted by said mordu battleship

Less krabs &gt; less subs &gt; less money for CCP to work with &gt; less updates &gt; less new content/pateches/changes/whatever &gt; less fun for "you"

---
There can be no Krabs in this hell, no Krabs at all
---
Cept there’s no killboard now.
---
Thanks, I might try that, but i doubt it will work - dock to a corner so I can have 4 of them on a single screen.
---
Also, it will still bother me that this is per account so i need to switch profile every time i run becuase trader, miner, pve on the same account.
---
Also, turn off clients at fullscreen (windowed) and they never start up fullscreen.
---
A predator is often blind to its own peril
---
I tried installing eve-o preview and i have no idea what it even does. I launched 4 clients and they mesh-up in upper left of my main monitor into a small rectangle. Maybe if i search it on youtube.
---
there is more to a webpage response than the html
---
They will start at the size of the manual window.
---
So manually make the window the size of the screen and it'll be Fullscreen.
---
But yeah.
---
I multibox with eve o preview.
---
But I manually dock the windows to Fullscreen.
---
Simple solutions for complex problems - most offen preferred by simple minds. This blackout may solve the botting problem partly in nullsec, but it creates more problems with other activities.
---
Wannabee-pvpers just want more easy kills, sealclubbing industrials and miners, that's all.
---
Not sure. Haven't logged in yet and just saw the notification on my Evanova app. Best guess is they might have looked into my history. I'm one of the OG Belligerent Undesirables so yeah I'm about as dirty as it gets. Frankly, they should be embarrassed that they recruited me in the first place.
---
You gone too deep, son
---
Who even uses in game chat anymore?
---
Well hopefully they delete citadels before they fire the dev team. Then EVE will be fun again.
---
I hate it to be honest, but it's because I can't help but care about it. 
---
When I have an unlucky run of losses and see lots of red on my kb it puts pressure on me and makes me pvp even worse. I know that it's ridiculous, but I can't help it. Would much prefer to be free of that!
---
Love it!

You don't need a killboard for kill marks. They go on a ship. You're thinking about kill mails.
---

---
Ya the krabs won't be logging in is my bet.
---
no.
---
Well I have a *"Look at what happens when you're not in standing fleet and on comms!!!"* killmail now. So thanks, I guess :P
---
*shrugs* exactly what I said would happen is happening, the only people actually undocked right now are the same pvpers that were always undocked in the first place (in our space I mean), everyone else has either unsubbed or decided they are going to just passively farm until CCP pisses off and decides to let us play the game again.
---
this should be fun
---
We tried that. HK got smashed.
---
Gallente backed rebel
---
That's a very limited outlook on things.
---
zKill isn't just intel, zKill and killboards in general are part of the stories of what happens in EVE.
---
Dude open up dotlan and tell me krabs are all docked up. Plenty of NPC kills everywhere.
---
Yes pyfa all the way... I mean the fitting simulator is really just so you can do multi buys, right?
---
You listed three FW things in response to me, that's all I see. Sorry for the confusion. I agree that not much should change, which is why I was asking what you think should change. XD

You can make this exact same argument for botters/hackers/exploiters/whatever.  Some subs are worth losing if it makes the game healthier.
---
Bots will prove it. Give it a few days in case they need to patch/reprogram their code, but if bots can still dock up instantly when someone enters system even though local is "delayed" that will be the proof.
---
Omg thats so great. Love it &lt;3

He gets pretty into their memes yes.

You really don't need back up to run level 5s. Just use an MJD barghest.

You'll have to be looking really close to notice any ghosting with any modern monitor. Like really wanting to see it and find it to notice it. Just look for something in your budget that's well rated on Newegg, do some research on opinions from tech blogs/reddit reviews.
---
As long as you aren't buying a TV to use as a monitor you'll be fine.
---
*relief*
---
Yeah makes sense now. How do people make a home in WH space then? If I enter a WH from low sec, what are the chances of a new WH opening up in that space that goes back to the same low sec system.
---
Concurrent player numbers haven't dropped. There are shitloads of targets out there, go get em.

It'll increase intake and retention if the outward appearance of eve being 90% bots and sploits goes away

Wondering what will happen to all these wonderful Renter "Empires"?

Yup, and concurrent hasn't dropped. Target rich environment. Possible exception of detorid because it's overfished to shit right now.

They are, but someone has to buy PLEX with real money to put it on the market, and if the demand for PLEX drops because the bots stop playing, less people will buy PLEX with real money to sell for isk.

They don't... They come back home well before that wh is likely to collapse. If you right click the info of the wh it kind of tells you how long it will still be stable. If it says "has reached the end of its lifetime" it will collapse with a 4 hour period.

Look at this - as some mode managed to quickly hide it :    https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ccbj2v/lets_talk_seriously_were_people_creating_so_many/           
---
Current eve offline numbers show normal numbers, but new player graphs show 0 new created.        
---
So the question is if CCP is not showing false login data just to persuade people "come play, others play".

Ahh, that makes more sense!

We have known about them for months. Quite possibly several hundred more still in that station plus several hundred more in other stations. Its the best worst kept secret.

Saying that I look forward to seeing what they kill. It’s gonna be interesting
---
That looks like a delay in the data mate...
---
Glad to see you're still tinfoiling hard.
---
&gt;! im gay !&lt;
---
Also the idea that negative player reactions would be seen as something bad by CCP. 
---
Yelling about the game will only drive outside interest, because internet drama is the main recruitment tool of the game. Especially when the complaints tend to read as "oh no these recent changes will cause too much meaningful player interaction and high stakes combat" to any outsiders or retired players who come to visit the sub.

The sad part is ccp hates big alliances and coalitions and this will scare off people to join bigger "safer groups" .  Regardless if it actually is,is another argument all together.  
---
This may drive some conflict and might even impact the MER in places other then delve, but as for new, small and mid tier alliances looking to hold there own have no capacity to even know that they are at anytime in trouble.  
---
This was an interesting idea to say the least and honestly is going to bring a new structure that can be blapped in a single timer for non delayed local.  This also goes to show that they were messing with the local and chat system to try this out and see precursor effects.  (Not Everytime the bugs happened but some where ccp stayed quiet). 
---
This is all my opinion and has no basis for anything other then my own gut.  I can be wrong in all of this and someone will be glad to inform me as such.

The 3 x super ratters are thinking "CCP will hate that I unsubbed 3 accounts".

CCP is thinking:  "You didn't buy those PLEX from us anyway...  we don't care."
---
They didn't bring CCP $ and didn't bring other players content (because if there was a chance they were content they wouldn't have been out there with their supers.).  So all they did was contribute to isk inflation.

are you ok?

Jokes on you I moved to a wormhole. What are these sleeper things ?

Yes god today is going to be a great day at work with all these meme's

They shoulda read the pings

I'm not cool enough to have a copycat!

You're.

Even fucking wallymarts is in this...

Damn.

refer to that last part, PLEASE IGNORE

pls do not give him attention
---
its RP , blackaout nullsec so blackaout zkill ...
---
I laughed harder than I should have
---
1) Petition CCP
---
2) Who are the locals?  If they have an easy-to-get-into corp, join it.  Then evac your stuff and leave if you don't want to stay.
---
Isn't that what we want with this one, though?
---
I thought it was a connection issue from my work lol... Good job zKill..
---
Still waiting for an pvp come to my

Im in CAD-176

so we can all use the ingame map to try and find our way around? l m a o

Yes I think that is a fair assessment.

Take it to the logical conclusion. Eve should shut its services.

how many man hours did it take you ?

For the real Blackout experience go ahead and turn off your screen too.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

nah, my bet was a max of 1-2 weeks, u can check my previous posts. The first weekend will just have the highest activity of nullsec hunting with all the hunters with raging hardons running around, which will subside come monday...

Except the amount of moon goo in their space. A venture fleet moonwalked out with 15 bil of it and CVA didn't notice until shit talk in local apparently.
---
When the nerf to anom respawn hits I am going to LAUGH!
---
Quite simply no one can predict what is the next move by this new CCP.  Make a nerf to the umbrella and I will think they have to walk bowlegged to make room for their new big brass ones.
---

I'm surprised I didn't already have this account, tbh. I still have the Would Vulcan character though lol.
---
thats a considerably lower return when compared to the previous loot reports i have seen. i am myself getting much less isk per hour when running gammas and exotics lately.  did they nerf 5's?
---
I have no objections to having a delayed local as long as there are other improvements, be the observatories, sov upgrades or whatever.  The risk is CCP see this as a total success and leave a half broken change in place.
---
Yeet the fucking baby
---
Shhhhhhhhh
---
Probably not.  You're mining on an Athanor, and usually the Engineering Complexes are placed close enough together that you can see any bubbles or hostiles.
---
And this, kids, is another reason that you don't trust cloud services.

CCP SKILLPOINT COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL NOT WORKING CORRECTLY REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
 /s
---
Because his site became the standard, so everyone gave him the tokens to pull that data from.
---
Nobody else currently has those tokens and there's no point attempting to build a replacement because I doubt it's down permanently.
---
I'm open to the idea of those kind of additional improvements but even without them, delayed local seems like a good thing. Doing nothing else is better than reverting to normal local.
---
Hi, I'm Dentass

Means will likely stay docked for a few days, but the Krab Fever will kick in and they won’t be able to help themselves.  I expect the real killmails to show up in a week.

Luckily the salt pillar comment can be applied to both of them somewhat equivocally.

just make a keyboard with just one letter, paste "V" on it, and have a drinking bird keep tapping it. Sorted.
---
I'm betting this is permanent and that we can deploy a comms thing that doesn't have a reinforce timer / can be blown up like a jetcan in order to temporarily restore local.  I bet it's like a cyno where everyone can jump to it, too.

Assuming he ran them back to back at the full 20 minutes, it would take around 16 1/2 hours at 162.5 million isk per hour.

*laughs in nemesis*
---
valk and villy evidently got someone assblasted so they delivered to these fine gentledinos a shitload of ventures in a wormhole. then they unanchored the structure and proceeded to kill the ventures. it's just to fuck with spvg's kill-board. it's pretty funny, i'd be kinda proud if i made someone mad enough to pull this shit.
---
Hold on illed say the soft Krabs. Most with a back bone dont care.

God, I miss this show. so good.

Joke's on you, they don't have local either.

What else could that possibly mean?????????

it's due to a biological drive to shitpost local felt by every TAPI pilot

Personally I think this sucks, but I guess it's his to do with what he pleases. 
---
Are there any alternative sites?
---
So many won't understand this and that makes me sad
---
No, he's right.  But of course having to do it may make CCP actually implement a decent "radar" system for players, so it's not necessary.  It should be automatic and how good it is should be dependent upon skill, maybe fleet charges/boosts and so forth.  
---
But no, CCP will give us some completely retarded "observatory" mandatory structure instead, to add to the structure spam.

---
You forgot the random guy post ever an escalation or loot.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
I just turn my electricity off and make pew pew sounds while mailing money orders to ccp. It's a game style that is really catching on.
---
..but what I mean is that what if, like zkill blackout, we have no external tools. Just the game. 3rd party external tools are awesome and I would hate living without obviously...it would be interesting going back to eve of older tho. I was never there then..
---
I get your point though...where does it stop.
---
Most smallgroups have 1 to 5 real big krabs, that strait either rorq or carrier/super rat while everyone else either anom rats in subs or mines during a moon pop/ does ded sites, or other sigs and escelations.
---
What ive noticed is these guys usually dont overlap their isk making activities totally. Like out of the 15ish to 50 dudes in the small sized group, 5 to 6 might be doing isk activity at the same time while everyone else stays in comms bored waiting for an FC to make content.
---
This is GREAT for smallgroup retention. People will feel like they are actually helping their cause and group whether nothing happens or they catch a few scouts or even fend off a gang.
---
And even then bigger hunting fleets can create infrequent relations with different groups for safety, and then the whole escelation process is alot smaller and contained. 
---
This is what will make eve have content *accesible* in null, something that didnt haplen for a long long time. The hammer wont drop on 3 dudes, and no local means really harsh intel gathering that can be obfuscated if there is a big event plannned by the agressing party.
---
One of the greatest way to retain players is to make their space something that they work towards and fight for. Its something to say hey me and my buds improved, we put the work in and this is our space. When the bois undock its to do something important, and junior fcs can really wet their feet in the waters now.

To reiterate, my point was, it's his site. He built it. He can do whatever he wants with it, including turn it black for fun and internet salt. And if he did indeed do it permanently, which of course he didn't, someone could replace it.

This is where it sorta breaks down for me honestly.  They have a mechanic in null sec.  they have a mechanic in wormholes.  Instead of dealing with the “null sec problem” they take this obscenely lazy solution and shove it down our throats to make us suffer some kind of penalty FOR PLAYING THE FUCKING GAME THE WAY THEY FUCKING BUILT IT... BUT FUCK US RIGHT??
---
Instead of throwing resource allocation up in the air... 
---
creating system resources to run rampant In undeveloped systems...

Causing resources to despawn at higher traffic points or cyno lights.

Fixing fucking low sec...

And this is just a few easy ones...

Nope... take local away.

The \~elite pvpers\~ and grr "*0.0 sov have it too easyyyyy*" nullsec groups are absolutely clueless when it comes to understanding the enormous amount of effort, planning, and man-hours utilized behind the scenes to ensure an effecient re-location of some 10,000 players &amp; assets. The amount of work big alliance logistics teams put in are very seldom in the spotlight, but are a influential factor of an unimaginable magnitude in the survival of a group's infrastructure, and the group as a whole - this Buds for you Jump Gate Fueler Citadel Anchorer Undock Aligning Freighter Multiboxing Space Travel Agent and Galactic Sovereignty Landscaper.

I do not believe they understand what In Good Faith means. its pretty much the opposite of switching and entire active sub to private because it was the "cool thing to do." I'm all for removing any mod behind this. was pretty uncool to try to read/discuss the blackout here since DT only to be given the middle finger by mods. Sure its just a blackout, but reddit does have this whole in good faith concept when it comes to sub reddit mods.
---
Never understood this argument , people who buy plex need someone else ingame to buy it from them to keep the chain of money flowing for CCP , if the brainless ratter isn't buying it then there would be no reason for anyone else to buy plex with real money.
---
That's better
---
k
---
Agreed.
---
Judy have frozen burgers tho.
---
Garmurs are in a pretty good spot. They are one of the defacto mission running ships and have some use in PvP as well. Skills are a bit more complicated but maybe someone else has a skill plan handy.
---
It's pretty easy, just break promises.
---
And others will form anti-anti-gate-camp fleets.
---
My thought as well. The story did well putting isk in context but most people will have no idea how much m3 is considered a lot.

I left Horde a month ago and still have stuff on market there.  I should probably take care of that.

Dude, Goons are excited for this.  I can't wait to get home frome work and lead folks in blopsing.

Where's the killmail?
---
TBH I think people miss a lot of the experience on how is going the blackout with zkillboard on "blackout".
---
I can understand the reason but would be great to have access to the killmails even if it was with a delay of 30m-1h.

---
Running sites as a group will have high-sec level pay. It's simply not worth it.
---
The main problem with the blackout is that it increases the risk massively (not a bad thing per se but...) the reward has stayed the same.
---
So it's gone from Low Risk - Mediocre Reward to Extremely High Risk - Mediocre Reward.
---
Additionally, the blackout gives ridiculous amounts of power to cloaky cynos.

You can roll any connections that look dangerous if you want to pve, though. It’s not hard to find a c3 with a lowsec static out in the middle of nowhere and no other jspace connections.

You and I dont play the same game then
---
Stahp 😀
---
Yikes.
---
What could it possibly mean?
---
The I shall explain:
---
- There are and will always be someone in the game willing to buy the PLEX a PvP'r sells (that were acquired using credit card).  Always.  It might be another PvP'r who sometimes krabs, or lives in a wormhole, or does it occasionally to pay for a 2nd or 3rd account.  (I PLEX my 2nd, sometimes my first).
---
- That is different than when someone has 20 (more?, less?) Alpha VNI bots running.  Or has 3 supers and complains they are now slightly less safe IN NULL SEC*!  
---
The meta was stale.  People were krabbing 23/7 using the most expensive ships in the game in total security.  The risk/reward was out of balance.  Someone who is (or thinks they are) good, and with more balls, will still super rat because of the ticks, but they will have to accept a bit more risk to do it.  
---
You need knowlege and balls again, and maybe some skill.  The players above just need a "walkthrough" guide.
---
* As a reminder null sec = "Null, as in zero, security"
---
#nopoor!

DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO

Ahhhh yes, nothing like some fun in the TUB

---
Garmur is an terribly overprized ship wich gets headshotted most of the times because pilots flying it are known to fit them stupidly blinged with faction points / scrams and deadspace propmods etc.
---
So Garmurs are reknown for being giant fucking loot piñatas...
---
As for aquisition its really expensive and costs allmost double of other **T2** frigates (wich argueably perform better)!
---
Since you're new its best to pop some T1 ship first to get experience, then when you've done welping bunch of your usual Kestrels, Tristans 'n shit go for higher prized vessels.
---
Its allways best to train into T3 Destroyers, T2 Interdictor and Interceptor and T2 Assault Frigates.
---
For T3 Destroyers its just takes one week or two to sit somewhat properly in them, sure powergrid and cpu are tight but they're really usefull nontheless.
---
If you want fleetcombat train into Jackdaws for they're the best in doctrins, if you want some lowsec shenanigans, nanogang stuff go for Svipul or Hecate... Svipul is more of a 1v1 brawler or instahlock sniper - Hecate brings ~~rape~~ **the paintrain** as in every knifefight they proceed to skullfuck anything they can sit upon *(I'd consider \~930dps on a Destroyer as rather painfull)*. Confessors can work too and are known for their active baittank so they see many uses in PvE but are hard to fit because they rely on capacitor that much.
---
All T3 Destroyer have the benefit that the ship alone costs about as much as a Garmur but their fit is way cheaper so in the end they cost half as much as any Pirate frig, only &lt;80mil ISK.
---
T2 Interceptor are also great for newbros to train into because all alliances seemingly lack tackle or people that want to fly tackle, it escalated to a degree that in GSF you get more ISK out of SRP than the ship was worth it, making it desireable to get your Interceptor blapped in combat ~~to cheat on the tax office (insurance fraud)~~. ^(I have never done that and don't know anyone who did!)
---
So training them as soon as possible really helps, there are three Interceptors to consider: the Ares as its the one with the best turnspeed to make a Taxi out of, the Stiletto as its the one with the most *speeeeeeeeeeeeeed* *^(gotta go fast boiz)* and finally the Malediction and imo the best of the bunch because its not oneshot and can actually tank the thing it tackled, making it the best fleet interceptor to hold on Carriers while tanking their Fightersquads.
---
T2 Assault Frigs are worth your time as they're the most versetile and can really fuck your day up. They have their respective factions T2 damage resist profile and you can do bunch of stupid tanky shit with them, they're fun to roam in and since they can fit an ADCU(assault damage control unit) they can even survive several Boson ticks because of their frigate sized signature radius.
---
The Wolf is known for their 93% somewhat resist profile against EM damage, its really fun to bring it into space where Blood Raiders, Sanshas or Drones are your default enemys as the native inhabitants of those regions will oftentimes have adapted their damage to fight those npcs. 
---
You can do stuff like that with all T2 Assault Frigates, if you roam Angel Cartel space go for the Retribution - same with Serpentis, Guristas space ... just bring Caldari / Gallente there and you have an easier time. Match the resitance profile those areas you're roaming.
---
But I'd advise to go for Minmatar T2 Assault Frigs since their selectable damage types and performance is overall really great \~ you get up to &gt;300 dps with those nasty little ships.
---
Its cheaper and more reliable to go get T2 Frigs or simply specialized ships like T3Ds to roam null or low and look for fights! Pirate faction vessels are needlessly expensive, known to be blinged and not really usefull for noobs in PvP since you are going to die in seconds and reimbursing your losses will take longer.
---
T3 Destroyer would be the best for newbies since they can do great in most environments and they bring more fitting space than any frig could wich also helps newer players.
---
Also T3Ds wont get headshot because they'll most likely survive it too tbh, heck Hecates are used as lowsec/highsec Taxis because they align in under 2s and pack like 25k ehp - yeah boy you gonna need more Machariels to smartbomb that.
---
That's where most risk averse people live!
---
They are really there.
---
So the set to private earlier was to control the spamming?
---
WoW was the first MMO

This would have more weight if you hadn't been hyping up the change 24/7 weeks before it happened. It very much reads like the CEO of a company advocating for his own product.

You have a perfectly functional, automated "radar". It's your Overview.
---
Radar doesn't show you activity in other time zones and on other continents. It tells you about activity in your immediate vicinity. So why would ships have an automated function telling them all about things happening several AU away?
---
Next step is to remove Incursions from high sec and drifter ratting from wormholes. Total nerf of all income in 5..4..3..
---
Shit now where intel?
---
No, just to troll people.
---
Why are you trying to work it out?  It's completely pointless.  Just let it be.  Put it this way, if you need to dscan to stay safe, you're not safe, so no amount of dscan will help.

How much is the initial investment on this thing?

Curse: oh ho, you're approaching me!?
---
The ability to trivially and fully close off a hole for pvp-immune krabbing should probably be on the list of shit to fix while they're making Eve scary again.
---
Been employed every day for the last 36 years, but thanks for playing.
---
SKINs babyyy
---
Wouldn't it have been funny if CCP deleted everyone's old bookmarks to level everyone's playfield even morem
---
the 68ft keep is dead jim
---
&gt; It's your Overview
---
That's grid only (for ships).  
---
&gt; why would ships have an automated function
---
Because it's a video game.
---
Look at dotlan for any null region, look at number of NPC's killed, just glanced at Delve there is only two systems and the highest is like 1k npc kills over an hour, thats like 1 or 2 carriers.
---
This change is one of those things(AT the moment) that sounds good on paper, but in reality it's hurting the PvE players, and they make up the majority in EvE, no ratters means all those PvP pro's who love killing PvE fit ships will find it much harder to find anyone cos no one is actually out ratting.
---
This all might change tho if we get the comm's towers that give local back to systems with them online.
---
My favorite response is to say hello as I take the out-gate... I wonder how many bots have stayed docked after I leave cuz my name is still in local?
---
Play the game with people, not numbers.
---
What exactly makes zkill a cloud service? The definition of that buzzword is so vague. Is any website a cloud service then?
---
Lmao

You can always be rolled into

Bring back deep core probes!
---
ooooh wait till Vily finds out
---
I just discovered evAnova . What a fantastic app
---
Hunters keep their free intel. Others do not.
---
wouldn't it be funny if your fingers all developed malignant tumours from that fucking cancer you posted
---
Woooooooooooooooooossssshhhhhhhhhh &lt;3
---
Hunting out in Null from wormhole space is pretty legit at the moment.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/aw6kdyk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/aw6kdyk.jpg) :P
---
Perfect in every way!
---
Depends what wormhole type it is. What jsig is this?
---
Wormholer btw
---
My corp member has been "getting caught" in neuting VNIs on gates or in anoms for months.   The kills he gets are hilarious.
---
Local: black out
---
zKill: black screen
---
r/Eve: Private
---
I lol'd.  Best mods ever.
---
who rage rolls c5/c6 anymore?
---
Nothing died today, Zkill tells me so.
---
They will see how stupid this idea is within 2 weeks and they will rush to undo it before the proposed time-frame is allowed to play out. Say what you will, subscriptions and activity is going to fall off a precipice very quickly. Like it or not, real success in the game is dependent on a relatively safe environment. Take that away and they will flock away quickly.
---
Local is primary, we don't care how chats work besides that.
---
sandbox game. You can blow up ships for strategic reasons if you want. Many people do. You can ignore that zkillboard even exists.
---
But other people can blow up ships for kb stats. That's not mutually exclusive.
---
Can confirm, TEST spam best spam.
---
It's pretty much a given that if you are in TEST, local is always the primary.
---
The mods are the main abusers of the spam!
---
No, hes not a wormholer sealing off exits to pve without any risk of pvp.  Hes just making a desk bro.
---
It's like whales singing in the ocean, just our way of announcing our presence to people who might want to play.
---
dual armor rep Dominix got a buff
---
FU-KING AGREEEEEEEEE.  I'll be rattling around Delve when I get home...fight me.
---
This would have more weight if you hadn't been moaning about the change 24/7 weeks before it happened. It very much reads like a krab advocating for his own playstyle.
---
We, the pilots
---
(people with active subs w/ Eve online)
---
How are triglavian ships? Are any of them good for PvE content?
---

---
March is January in Exoland
---
If CCP stopped wormhole rolling and made all wormholes static and give J space security ratings and concord, wouldn't you be annoyed they flipped your playstyle choice out from under you?
---
Oh no no no, only nullsec income is bad. All other kinds are good and should in fact be buffed considerably
---
This is my unironic #1 complaint about loss of local.
---
Which is why i shall spend this time baiting and killing all of the roaming bears looking for afk pilots and bots.  Also blue bots if i find them.
---
Yeah earlier today we (Odin's Call) roamed Providence a bit with some guests from Pos Party and we came across another roaming gang (I believe a Tuskers/NPSI gang) and we had such a fun fight! It's not just about oppressing NS, but about having more uncertainty with roaming gangs which spices it up so much! 
---
GF to all those that were there, a ton of fun was had! :)
---
Out of interest, have you actually *tried* engaging with the situation?
---
Nah.  They are mostly fine.
---
I haven't done them but incursions seem to require coordinating fleets, teamwork, and their blingy ships get targeted for ganks.  
---
WH ratting - again, not something I have done, but it seems to require a lot of effort to set up and then you are still at risk.  
---
Both are huge income.  None are as safe or easy as the umbrella.
---
Calm down bud
---
If your removing it because of intel.. remove all of the intel... API feeds (dotlan) Ingame map (players in space last 30 mins, players docked last 30 mins, jumps etc)   
---
this is a half ass attempt thats just going to reduce content because people cannot be assed to spent 3 mins probing every system they go through on a roam to find theres no one in the system...   
---
and the people who dont like wh space because of no local will just move to highsec, resulting in even less people out for content to happen.   
---
theres already 1000 less people on vs the same time yesterday, with today being start of the weekend...  and i suspect it will just get lower..
---
Nooooo! Protect my home Senpai Jay-kun
---
I get by with a little help from my friends, then ;)
---
Definitely appreciate view points that don't speak from experience!
---
What are you using on the small rats? I was under the impression 
---
HAM's don't apply well on those.
---
Well, I roamed for 4 hours and found like 3 kills
---
Alot of Chad's with the pvp dream
---
why even combat probe lol. It's a quick way to tell the locals there is an enemy.
---
yodik just got payed for that, doubt yodik himself got mad at valk/vily since he lives in a wh and doesn't care much about stuff outside there
---
This would have more weight if you hadn't been salty towards me 24/7 since TEST bitch-slapped you out of Provi. It very much reads like an "elite-PVPer" trying to salve his ego.
---
You mean lot of people have their miners logged out. Well not to bad.
---
&gt;if the brainless ratter isn't buying it then there would be no reason for anyone else to buy plex with real money.
---
This is only the case is there's an oversupply of plex. Given the meteoric rise in plex prices over the last couple of years, I strongly doubt this is the case. In short if Krabbo01/02/03/04/05/06.../99 don't buy those plex, **plenty of other people will**.  There's a particular term for this kind of commodity which I forget, but in essence, it will always be in demand as long as people can afford it.
---
What  *might*  happen therefore is that plex prices might fall somewhat, but if you think that would actually be a bad thing for EVE, then you're in a very small minority.
---
Short answer: Yes.
---
Longer answer: Depends on the type of content you're doing. I don't personally use a Leshak for wormhole ratting, but I know some people do. To get the most out of a Triglavian ship, you need some big targets to ramp your damage on, so I don't know how efficient they are out in k-space.
---
Hi :)
---
I'm a formally trained cabinet maker, i'd love to give you advice/help/etc if you need it!
---
It looks great! how did you finish it?
---
Go play abyssal PvP if you want instant content
---
he literally posted his fit. thats the initial investment...
---
They've stopped for now.  They said "brb, heatin up the second hot pocket".
---
Source/evidence?
---
All your points are valid points.
---
  Small players can finally go and do something while be harder to detect but this change also works in favor of larger null block entities.  
---
Now they can move an entire fleet in to a system and no one would know.  You wouldn't know if the force recon fleet was even on d scan.  
---
Hell camp would become a new term.  
---
I'm looking at this with caution, more choas will ensure and I'm sure I'll be going on a lot more blops fleets after today.  But I think this will force  tighter net and then when that tighter net gets full Bob only knows what will happen
---
This is why people live in wormholes
---
Karma-whoring of such barefaced shamelessness cannot go unrewarded. Take my upvote and post the logs.
---
Do you serious consider the removal of local to be the same as all of those things you just said?
---
I don't, at all.
---
That person have make the mistake of opening that secret door though. Cyno + hotdrop soon tm.
---
don't forget, ISK donations can go a long way
---
lmfao u/squizz! hilarious
---
MaxOnline -10000 gj ccp,waiting for next shit Patch ,next -20000 online
---
wouldn't if have been funny if ccp deleted everyone's characters to level everyone's playfield even morem
---
I started a new Darkest Dungeon game the other night, somehow managed to lose my crusader on the road to the hamlet. Kept receiving crits, and he kept missing. RNG rolled me hard.
---
&gt;Generally agreed upon consensus though is that wormholers will continue to get shit on
---
The unity slogan we can all get behind
---
Super agree.  Go out and fight and die (and win) and don't sweat it.
---
Relatively safe environment is high- and low-sec space. Null should have been this way a long time ago IMHO.
---
Childish
---
So what you're saying is that if INIT go roam Delve we can shoot NCdot?
---
i totally agree, strange you are here telling me what "is"...
---
how many rorquals do you have?
---
+spike in Perimeter
---
Its not set in stone yet, but this does kill it for casual PVEers, and maybe thats ok for most. Either way, its the shake up everyone wanted so lets see how it plays out. For me, i dont have the time or will to adjust so thats that. However,  i do hope this is a move that reinvigorates Eve and is fun for everyone.
---
When a Minmatar ship is built better with rusted metal than that desk.
---
The term you are looking for is "inelastic" meaning the demand does not respond as much to changes in the price.
---
My theory is (and I am sure I will repeat this elsewhere) the people who supply PLEX will do so at lower prices.  They did in the past when the assets they bought were the same price or even more expensive.  As such, unless someone who liked to fly faction ships is now flying supers instead, they were buying more for a PLEX than they did at lower PLEX prices.  In that case, PLEX inflation was hurting CCP's cash flow as they needed less PLEX for the same PvP.  
---
So again, the unsubbing PLEXing uberkrabbers are not hurting CCP.  Quite possibly CCP decided their game style was hurting CCPs cashflow.
---
unfree Fabio
---
Found a thread missing the propaganda tag
---
I don't follow the character market, but I can give you the hard cap for (1): It costs \~10b isk to inject a character with those skills from zero, so there's no way you're getting more than that. My guess is that nobody wants your afk VNI alt right now, so the actual price is probably closer to the amount that a buyer could get for extracting all the skills.
---
Re (2): Sure, and sure. "Viable" may not be the standard you want though. My sense is that the Legion is mostly outclassed by the Loki except in niche circumstances.
---
This is gold pls more :D
---
One. Budget jump freighter.
---
Just go look at dotlan SMH.
---
5000 of the Chinese bots are offiine now
---
They could eventually, but that's a bit like saying if eve shut down tomorrow you could just make the game yourself. It's completely unhelpful and doesn't address the fact there's no real reason to cause the issue in the first place.
---
Great plot i love it no intel no for 00 no killmail bragging for the rest
---
Good job
---
oh no bots not logging in, whatever shall we do
---
STOP SPAMMING THIS CHANNEL
---
----------INTEL ONLY----------
---
I have friends who do Incursions, so I have inquired.  And as to WH'rs, they are always here whinging their isk isn't risk-free.
---
Just fly to the nearest market system?
---
And there are specific people who go through middle of nowhere systems to find these statics. It's not how you think it is
---
One less than this morning perhaps.
---
&gt; theres already 1000 less people on vs the same time yesterday, with today being start of the weekend... and i suspect it will just get lower..
---
Assuming this is accurate, it's actually a much more interesting picture than that. The blackout event has attracted a fair number of bittervets to resub, thinking that these will be like the imagined halcyon days of Eve; killmails flowing like honey from a spring, etc etc. However, with PCU down, that means that their ranks aren't making up for the folks who, for reasons hysterical or practical, decided to stay logged off because of the blackout. Obviously, it's too soon to draw any real conclusions, but if this trend continues, it's an amusing consequence of the change.
---
Useful ~~intel~~ communication is preferred.
---
WoW that's a low price
---
Well, maybe you’re in some weird time zone, but for most of us we can’t play right now, so obviously numbers are low
---
I havent had this much fun ratting in YEARS!
---
Dodixie, and I'll do nothing of the sort.
---
amrast is a big homo
---
This may surprise you, but sigs are of critical importance to those living in wormholes.
---
Tradeoffs, probably. You'll notice that most ships give you some of what you want, but not all of it. A Lachesis has a long point, dscan immunity, can fit a reasonable amount of tank (not great, but better than many gank ships), but it's slow and not bubble immune. A tackle 'ceptor has a long point, reasonable speed-tank, is fast, and is bubble-immune. To make a dscan immune hunter frigate, ccp would probably want to give it some tradeoffs, and it's not clear to me that there are good options. Making it not bubble-immune is an obvious go-to, but that's not really enough. And while you can shorten the point range, lower the speed, and lower the speed-tank ability, it's hard to peg a level for those that's reasonable for a frigate while also being reasonable for the kind of ship we're talking about.
---
I also take bait seriously
---
I noticed that I have a toon with appropriate skills that has never hunted anyone in a BS. I'll try that today if I login.
---
Fun fun fun! Love the chaos.
---
lol no. No way in hell would I be krabbing today. Probably won't do that for the duration of this.
---
I dont get the sub reference or what this is but what I want it
---
You can also see new sigs pop up
---
+1 For elevated shelf in back. +1 For non-blackout post on blackoutday
---
Well this went straight to a weird place
---
Coward.
---
Set your drones to not auto-aggress.
---
I'm betting you attacked an NPC mining op without realizing it.
---
They'll take my bookmark collection from my cold dead fingers

Shut the &gt;!fuck!&lt; up

Low sec DED sites, T3/T4 FW Missions... is there a Tiglavian ship that could perform similar role as VNI?

oh right, that 0 group who rage rolls their high class static

#Canonlykillpveships
---
So possibly forever? Good riddance
---
Here, after a little editing. Little rough but something quick I whipped up for you [Seraph](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
I am a forum pvper. I attack any argument that I perceive as weak. 
---
And don't see that goonswarm members are upset. I only saw only one guy get pissy about it(kinda disappointing actually). All the others seem be be either neutral or mildly approving of the change.
---
Maybe they are upset and just holding their salt. Who can know though.
---
I'd think its really daft to deploy a structure without ANY public feed back. I'm not only talking about game mechanics wise but through dev feedback as well. CCP needs to test these things because they have a really shitty history of deploying patches (albeit its been much better lately).
---
Can you show me your Dotlan screenshots because this looks to be flat wrong?
---
I am in Jita
---
They are indeed always here whinging, about everything.
---
You mean like, "get out of my site or I'll report you to management"?
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Good, why the fuck should Nullsec be safe?
---
Havoc you don't have enough god damn brain cells to do anything remotely as interesting as this.
---
Ahh i see man is what it is good luck with that will be seeing you when you pod down next :)
---
Yeah I guess
---
Show us on the doll where the falcon touched you
---
Bring it ;) and cheers man
---
Ok
---
MonkaShake
---
Honest question, would you have not fought this gang before the blackout?
---
Clam down cringe lord
---
wouldn't it have been funny if ccp deleted eve so we can all move on with our bitter self hatred?
---
forever even.
---
Addition.
---
System
---
Ship
---
Anom
---
Cyno fitted yes/no
---
Correct, CCP provided Intel should only go one way.
---
Cheers soldier always trying to keep things positive init :)
---
Hi, I’m Dentass
---
I think he needs to calm up.
---
Confirming retardation. Engaging backpedal protocol
---
You felt the need to let everyone know, I felt the need to let you know.
---
that's pretty much confirmed
---
I'm coming to realise how deeply conditioned I am to open zKill instead spending time thinking about what I can do in the game.
---
Killboard blackout is also a big part I think. I wonder if preventing third party sites like Zkil from pulling that information would be better for the game too.
---
FeelsGoodMan. Just woke up ready for a full day of dunks (most probably feeding tho)
---
It won't be forever. After a couple of weeks CCP will announce an "Observatory" upwell structure to restore local per system. Then things will go back to normal.
---
Exactualy what Purity says is very hard to gauge when they are going to get a good hit whilst not fuly under the guns so cant really hold of my reps.
---
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
---
Killboard blackout is also a big part I think. I wonder if preventing third party sites like Zkil from pulling that information would be better for the game too. 
---
I don't think this blackout experience would be the same as you describe with killboard intel available.
---
I can hear the wormholers screeching already
---
Something about collateral damage?
---
So you're saying you might do some pvp? Or just logging off like the rest of the krabs?
---
I thought r/Eve was the new local
---
Krabs and botters will stay out the game for some time, the firsts will come back when the whitdrawal synthoms kick in and/or realize that this isn't gonna change for some time.
---
Botters I hope stay away... or well, you know, die a horrible and painful dead (ig ofc).
---
Jesus, now that's the level of anger
---
Dual faction webs. He posted his fit.
---
You're so full of shit.
---
Large groups still aren't fighting. Structures are still everywhere. Capitals are still being produced like rabbits procreate.
---
Those are the issues plaguing EVE. Local has never been an issue. It was never the problem. This isn't *the* solution that we needed, and comments like yours are only going to make CCP think everything is fixed when it most definitely is not.
---
"Cloud service" could roughly be translated to "service you're running is not on your own hardware and software", which means if it goes down, you're out of luck; if they change something, you're out of luck. "Cloud" is nothing more than just "someone elses PC".
---
Not a single sign of intelligent life anywhere
---
Thanks for accepting my invitation to the fleet matey!
---
I've had fun and found PVP that wouldn't have happened with local so I'd call it a success
---
Wut
---
I usually krab *and* PVP, mate. Doesn't have to be one and the other. I've just stopped krabbing for now.
---
&gt; there's no real reason to cause the issue in the first place
---
The reason is it's his. Content creators can do whatever they want with their content.
---
Spike!
---
2 neuts
---
It s a troll right?
---
(⬛‿⬛✿)  
---
(✿⬛‿⬛)  
---
(⬛‿⬛✿)
---
hehe i am the first poster this week
---
None of our squad is quitting because of no local. We are ecstatic
---
It's the single most exciting thing to happen for people who pvp in recent memory.
---
Best EVE news site out there.
---
Wow I bet u rly showed him with those DOWNVOTES!
---
Your blops drop are questionable mate 
---
but what ever floats your boat
---
Try yellow dots on the other end of map
---
Yeah, just wait until people run out of isk and can't afford to buy new pvp ships.
---
I think it's more that you can get that fight without Provi knowing where you all are immediately and forming a Cerberus blob with Lachesis and Huginns to wipe you all from the face of the earth.
---
also 
---
&gt;not sure if empty system
---
&gt;or if it's a bunch of shit that's been parked in a POS bubble since 2014
---
&gt; Another tactic is find the area you want to hunt in and look at the ratters killed on zkillboard.
---
Too soon.
---
It's only happening because this change is new. Like when an expansion finally releases, and people flock back to a game. Give it a few days and we'll still have a broken EVE with a ton of problems that CCP refuses to address.
---
All those wars we had in the past happened with local. All that content we had happened with local. Again, local was never the issue.
---
If your ticker is accurate, you should know better than anybody about my blops dropping.
---
Hell I just got one your your guys Noctis like an hour ago.
---
Maybe give people time to adapt?
---
And to be honest, a couple of days without massive influx of isk to the game sounds pretty awesome, but sadly I seriously distrust your numbers here.
---
Also, chances are that most pilots have left their ratting ships and joined one of the probably hundread of fleets looking for something to shoot in NS.
---
I think it's a good idea in practice but poorly implemented and no one has really thought through implications.
---
Couldn't the same be sad about any change to any game or website? Maybe he is opposed to nullsec blackout and this is his stance? Maybe he just wants to troll everyone who wants to brag about killmails.
---
I know, right? And here I thought I was going to get all kinds of easy kills. Almost nothing is undocked.
---
Thats a good point. I also sorta figured maybe with people being unwilling to undock pve ships, its sort of a "whelp nothing else to do" situation and are undocking combat ships, which is creating more opportunities. I'm eager to hear some more stories.
---
Currently looking at dotlan for Delve, 0 systems with above 1k npc kills
---
Can't have local because free intel
---
Uses dotlan as a source of free Intel.
---
Unless I'm remembering wrong the majority of the subbed playerbase is in hisec anyway
---
that would be sweet tbh
---
This joke is even better the 429th time around, boy howdy.
---
Awesome stuff!
---
Did someone say it should be safe?  
---
...
---
Is there a voice in here?
---
echo....... echo....
---
The feeling of absoulte safety without even using d-scan is wrong and should have never happened.
---
I don't care about your F1 pushing
---
"Every cubic meter of space not occupied by our ships is filled with cloaky t3cs."
---
Cheers mate:)
---
Yeah you can totally bling out that rattlesnake you're using. It'll NEVER die.
---
The guy that runs Dotlan would actually have to pay attention to EVE for something like that to happen.
---
No, it wasn't.
---
Such a badass!
---
Oh ok, so as long as you know everything, all good
---
So everywhere?
---
please stop posting if this is ironic
---
if this is srs then still
---
stop
---
I got the same on my end. Make sure yours is set to “NPC kills” and not 24 hours. 
---
But it’s also been like less than 12 hours since deployment so I wouldn’t put too much weight on this yet.
---
need some diagonal supports, this thing looks like a computer hardware death trap
---
Jokes on you OP. Goons are plotting to just take over all of J space now.
---
Thank you for these statistics!
---
I'm not in an alliance or a large, well-known corporation. So no F1 pushing for me.
---
Again, local was never the issue. It wasn't. I don't understand why people don't get this. We were *just* complaining about a lack of content, about structure spamming, about capital proliferation.. but then we're handed a "fix" for a completely unrelated issue, and suddenly it's all unicorns and rainbows?
---
Really? That's the bar we had set? The lack of content was because of larger gangs. Smaller gangs always had content. I'm in a smaller gang. We could take a roam out any day of the week and run into another couple of roams no problem.
---
Either that bullshit you somehow managed to write or a few dozen people decided not to use their bots today.
---
Yeah, I fully expect people to wait out the first blackout for a few days... the addiction is too stronk, they'll be back. I'm just happy CCP didn't say, DONT WORRY, BLACKOUT WILL ONLY BE 48 HOURS! because then people will just wait out the duration and login after it subsides... and that is gamebreaking.
---
I don't know how long you've been playing Eve but once upon a time there was no warp-to-zero.  Warp-to always landed you at 15.  So to get anywhere fast people started making bookmarks 15 past the gate in the direction they came from, so when warping to them they'd land right on the gate.  I remember spending weeks making sets like this.  
---
Anyway some enterprising people decided to start copying and selling the sets on contract and very soon the Eve database filled up with a trillion or so bookmark records.
---
CCP introduced a mechanism to stop or at least slow down the copying of these bookmarks alongside Warp-to-zero, and that mechanism is still with us today (you can't copy more than 10 at once), though they stopped making each copy lag, so at least the 10 you do copy are there more or less instantly.
---
Thanks for listening.
---
Less ISK being generated means the purchasing power of existing ISK increases, PVPers benefit from this.
---
I'm okay with this.   
---
Goons need a break from their asset ramp.
---
That's LS every single day, and we still have local.
---
MY GOD! This relates too well to wh local.
---
Tengus are here
---
Who said it should have happened?
---
Nobody.
---
Do you people read, or are you running this through a Trigonometric language translation and back again?
---
unnnnlucky
---
Late to the party, and it wasn't even funny the first time.
---
You're really hard on yourself in the video, but a lot of it is having to deal with micro managing the capacitor making your life harder in conjunction w/multiboxing the ceptor.
---
You played fine man. I wouldn't have expected to be on grid that long either, surprised it dragged on so long honestly.
---
Well, unless you've got some hard numbers on the count of bots in Eve Online: Noted Space-themed Spreadsheet, we can both agree that such speculation is utterly without merit.
---
The problem is, flairbaiting is incredibly common on this sub. So, the odds of a question like yours being from an actual new player and not joecuster are pretty low
---
I would of thought D-W wouldn't agree with you.

Everyone in Delve.  
---
I expect that most people in Theta are waiting for the people who think they can out drop us in Delve.  Time will tell though.
---
What's your point? Don't DSCAN, don't probe, don't even bother trying to keep yourself safe? 
---
404 valid point not found.

Hipsters*
---
C4 sympathizers !!!!
---
No, you just seem to be way too stupid to understand written language.
---
I agree with the fact that they need to test it first etc. But when was the last time CCP actually managed to release literally anything without issues?
---
Even this blackout as a latest example has caused alliance/corp chats to fuck up, and there are hundreds more examples of stuff breaking after even the tiniest changes after weeks of it being on SiSi... in some cases with actual bug reports about said issues being posted multiple times, on SiSi and still making its way to TQ...
---
They literally announced Observatories during last Fanfest. This could not be more obvious, even if it were a procurer sitting still on gate in low-sec.
---
For PVE purposes that dont involve being afk the Navy Vexor will still be viable, albeit practically a different ship altogether. It will now be a cruiser sized Myrm. It will have med rep bonus and reduced drone bay along with split dps between hybrids and drones. It would be very effective in gurista and serp 4/10s as an example. You could use rails or enjoy facemelt dps of blasters for the Serpentis Phi rat or the structure in the Gurista Scout Outpost. I guess I'm being specific to intermediate combat exploration.
---
Shessh, you've got something big up your bum tonight haven't you.
---
Spotted the nullbear.
---
Your cyno alts do not count
---
Feels great. Also, it's morning - you're on the wrong side of the planet.
---
In what respect?  It's quite simple.  If you need to dscan to stay safe, you're outside an umbrella.  If you're outside an umbrella, you're not safe.  That is all.
---
Had so many great fights and rivalries in low. Hopefully they'll make it relevent again.
---
Delay it 12 hours so it cant be used as a tool for real time metagaming.
---
You started your post stating that you didn't even know if those numbers are accurate, why would I do anything different? This (both my comment and yours) are clearly pure speculation; so what the fuck are you even saying?
---
Seems like you need a Snickers
---
Our allies. They are the kings of shitposting. Do not underestimate them.
---
.. so many weirdos on r/eve.
---
Im 5/5 taking the proving conduit and not ever having encountered an enemy ama
---
Never chained FW missions have we.
---
The issue is that every other region I looked at were still far behind Goons so compartivly speaking nothing changed, wait appart from like a 90% drop in people ratting and being in space where other players can shoot at them.
---
Id love to see miner numbers tbh cos im not seeing in my local anyone mine either even tho we have support, im sure people are mining under big umbrella's tho but I would be willing to be that those numbers are also way down.
---
You are obvously a troll or a nullbear who read a few things here and there and thinks he knows when in reality he knows shit.
---
Thanks Teal'c
---
That's Monty Python right? Love it.
---
Memories.... In the corner of my mind......
---
I dunno, if only there was this "drag net" thing you could place between two points when you know from the last visit where the second point is going to be.
---
-100 for wingspantt.
---
Do pilots docked in citadels still count as "in space" rather than "docked"? Or was that ~~bug~~ feature fixed?
---
Black Friday?
---
Ah, no free intel today boys!
---
Player owned jumpgates to wh space..... mmmmm
---
At least they didn't end up like razor
---
I mean whenever i’ve been listening in when dudes get dropped it sounds pretty poor. Bit like you camping efforts 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Unfortunately i can’t check about that noc since zkill’s down. But i’ll take your werd for it. 
---
But your known among us for being shit not good 😂 hence my comment...
---
Not sure if system full of defenseless ratters
---
or defended ratters because they use my very method of identifying my target systems

Nah, hipsters don't constantly tell non-hipsters how shit they are for not being hipsters.
---
pretty stupid.
---
I had fun too, I went out saw the sun, had some beers
---
How do I set up my Dscan to be refreshed every some seconds?
---
Less pve and more pvpers mean plex price crashing. As a pvp player i am not liking the foreseeable 25 percent drop in my welping power.
---
This said i dont really play much anymore so idgaf.
---
It doesnt stop your dread from decycling. I wish they would scram though.
---
It wasn't funny the first 700 times this was posted.
---
Yup theyre all gone forever and delve is empty go check
---
So are you too cowardly to fight ratters who fight back?
---
This.  
---
Only a total moron would use anything but T2 drones.  Full stop. 
---
In the short term people will either stay docked (beautiful summer day), or be in a cyno tanked Rorqual with T2 drones.  
---
If it goes long, people who have Rorqual hulls will still be using them with T2 drones, because why not.  Or that you mine is better than not.  
---
If it becomes permanent, then you will see meta shift to a mix of boosting Rorquals and PANIC protected barges.
---
Bruv I totally feel ya on that one.
---
Then don’t use a dread
---
Hi, i’m Dentass
---
You don’t. Doing that would probably get you banned
---
Anoms don't normally show up more than 4 AU from a warpable celestial.
---
Yeah that's like two thirds of my EVE career
---
True, my numbers may not be accurate. They are hearsay from this thread, after all. However, your statement implies that you can explain away any difference by invoking the "boo scary bot" card. As such, you'd have hard numbers, yes?
---
yeah but this one is best one, its the only one with a boy howdy response!
---
No local puts a massive hurt on bots.
---
Yeah but I don't care lol
---
This does nothing for eve.
---
What kind of intel? Delayed intel that's only going to tell you what happened 10 minutes ago? I enjoyed it more to just browse through at work when I got a free minute. If I was hunting I would use something far more useful, like the in game map or DOTLAN. Zkill is more like a news ticker than active intel.
---
Alright, so really every website and most internet based applications are cloud services. 
---
I would argue that it's impossible to design a killboard that *isn't* a cloud service though.
---
lmao thats the purpose of hunting, to kill weak targets, no hunter is gonna engage something that they know has a good chance of kill them, its not smart :p
---
Are you serious? I've been playing for a while and since I learned about the dscan I keep using it more frequently. And now with the blackout I want to just smash the button all the time. It kinda doesn't make sense for me that it couldn't be automated.
---
I went out and roamed in a Tengu for a couple hours in Detorid. I found either enyos that were too far away before i could probe them or groups too large for a single Tengu to fight.
---
Not a single VNI anywhere. I'll have to check the other pipe because I granted was in the backroads.
---
First impressions: EVE feels even more dead than roaming felt before. I'll see how fleet play is later this evening.
---
It’s ok there is no one in there today.
---
Cause less bots are logging on to farm.
---
Low quality bait
---
Correct: wormholes are the portal to the next life and that which is already dead cannot die.
---
There's over 20k rn, just saying. Next time you decide to whine, don't rush it.
---
That would hurt my corps playstyle, but it would likely be healthier for the game.
---
Wow I just went to 1DQ and you're right, 0 people in local! Goons have actually disbanded and scattered to the winds!
---
^^^^^/s
---
You're right, the only way to make isk is to be under a super umbrella. You literally can't make isk in wormholes, lowsec, hisec or heck, even NPC nullsec. 
---
(big /s)
---
You guys have trouble with that too?
---
Not really a good indicator as people's schedules vary. While its friday and the start of the weekend, USTZ has been working since blackout started. Youd want to compare between Friday's. Not comparing thursday and friday. For example, i was off yesterday but not today and cant login yet.
---
Checking EVE offline, it shows PCU was 26k last friday. We are at 23k now, before USTZ even comes out of work. Though i wouldnt mind if someone double checked that, eve offline on mobile is pretty terrible.
---
My final opinion is that PCU isnt the definitive factor of actual fights occurring in space and content being had. If for example, you had a 30k PCU and 25k of those are krabs, miners, bots etc or anyone else who doesnt particpate in pvp, that leaves you with 5k people to play with.
---
If the PCU drops to 23k people because 10k bots/krabs/miners are offline, but we gained a few thousand pvp'rs, then there is more potential content to player ratio. Also, more potential paying customers if its just bots/alpha's logging off.
---
While i wont say everyone not logging in are alpha's/bots, there is certainly a % that is. And any pvp'r or paying customer than comes back is a bonus to CCP and the game.
---
Has PL undocked yet?
---
yes, now all my shit is stuck in asset safety.
---
Already did. The last tormentor in the video lol
---

I made a killing selling regional bookmarks
---
Pretty sure I'm blacklisted by every group PGL and DHD have influence over, and I'm too lazy to make spies.
---
It helps, but it doesn't help you against someone rolling into your hole, or against seeded holes. You still got to keep an eye on your scanners.
---
A T4 gila’s bling is very dependant on the abyssal type. I have a T4 Gamma Gila fit that has so far not failed (close calls for tank sometimes though) for just a little over 300M ISK. Better skills and/or more bling would make it better. So far though I’ve only tested it on the test server and so don’t have a figure for approximately how much ISK/hr it brings me.
---
Local wasn't free intel. It was free PERFECT intel. It's not the same.
---
I honestly love the game, I felt that it was in a decent state. All the criticism I have for it is because these recent changes, which should be quality of life changes, are designed at refocusing the game so that instead of earning, building, trading, fighting your way up. You will just whip out your credit card.
---
thank dude. Would you care to chare your fit? 
---
Think i might jump on sis and test some things out
---
I can't do anything to my gates to limit the ability of an incoming fleet to use it (crit the wormhole).
---
I can't destroy the gate to remove the connection to an undesirable system and get a new gate to somewhere else (roll the wormhole).
---
I can't keep destroying the gate and spawning a new one until I get a gate to someplace I like (wormhole rolling mechanics).
---
Really, it seems obvious to me that security issues of gates is nothing like wormholes.
---
Basically, yes. Killboard will almost always be some kind of cloud service (although zkill's websocket endpoint for getting kills as they happen fixes most of the potential issues related to that), with zkillboard specifically the only thing that is/was lacking from my perspective is having a way to get full killboard data dump available, so you could mirror the data and work on it on your own hardware, without being service-dependent for past info - even if service going down means no new data, you still can use all the old data.
---
I know most people on this subreddit hate crabs but in all seriousness aside from a super umbrella I wonder how folks can mine (or rat I guess but mining ships would seem more at severe risk.) without getting popped easily.
---
Good. I guess I'll have an easier time catching you guys if you think I can't do it. (Despite the evidence lul)
---
&gt; We've had droves of people quit (omg, if i can't triple box ratting supers, i'm not playing Eve!!!11)
---
good riddance I say
---
Did your father not teach you about masculenity and how it doesn't have to be so fragile?
---
'Masculinity'.  Doesn't your browser have a spell-checker?
---
Because they're busy gate camping and running around looking for targets.   
---
Why are there so many people who want Serenity on TQ?
---
Perfect but woefully incomplete. Didn't tell if someone was docked or cloaked or even active. So compared to dotlan telling you jump activity and kills its about on par.
---
and crossfit
---
I like it. Keeps thing more op sec feeling. Even when local comes back
---
Plenty of ways to make ISK that are stronger than running anoms.
---
I have no horse in this race, I'm fine with it either way. The point is the ones who come to delve in numbers a single multiboxer can outblob, will have to think about this.
---
YOU MONSTER!
---
Sure. 
---
Highs: 4x Rapid Light Missile Launcher II (Scourge Fury Light Missiles)
---
Mids: 10MN Afterburner II, 3x Large Shield Extender II, 2x Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
Lows: 3x Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
Rigs: 3x Core Defense Field Purger II
---
Drones: 2x Valkyrie II
---
With this fit I get 617.5 DPS, 13,200 Shield HP (19,800 in the actual abyssal), 78 (117 in abyssal) BASE shield regen per second (not EHP)
---
Can you confirm the interpretation of your wording "In support of CCP's blackout..." that you actually do support the nullsec blackout and think this is a good thing? I have friends tinfoiling hard rn. Ty &lt;3
---
Deffo. Besides, the people who are losing ships right now will need to eventually do some monemaking to pay for new ones.
---
Shit, well there goes my plan. I guess they’ll have to use dotlan or the in game map
---
Salty much? I mean geesh. Way to show you have not only been licking the salt wheel, but swallowing each one whole from the box.
---
It's just that the few who are freaking out are being extremely loud about it.
---
Well at the heart attack rate you are going to it might not be long. Need to chill out a bit. WOOOOSAH.
---
I think this argument has been fully exercised over the last decade and current thinking is that local is kind-of bad for the game, from the perspective of the state as it is today.
---
Why is this hard? I support CCP and what they are doing.
---
Rocket bombers up up
---
Yeah, but I'm a hardcore rebil you see
---
Hey squizz, petllama here from back in karbo days. Delay the shit out of them!
---
delet zkill. Be free my friend
---
The state as it is today. What do you mean by this? Because of the proliferation of bots?
---
This feels like NULLSEC should be. Most fun I’ve also had in years
---
It's not going to be just a weekend. The krabs will be forced to return, or move to less profitable pastures.
---
as someone who hates third party tools being more important for gameplay than undocking, I support this.
---
I appreciate the sentiment but as someone who is away from their PC for the time being and very interested in seeing the effects of the Blackout, especially the initial effects, I am disappointed because zkill offers a very clean and well put together way to see how people have succeeded or fucked up under this new local regime.
---
Just you wait until Observatories hit and intel is one way to the defender. Gonna be funny af when the tears flow the opposite direction.
---
You forgot the cloak and nullified ship as well.
---
Not just bots.  I mean the general feeling of stagnation.
---
It’s not 100% safe, no. 
---
But it’s many times safer than nullsec for anything smaller than a super
---
Also Corp bookmarks. Early days of w-space required someone going back to share the chain book marks with the rest of the gang before a gank. Also managing a can of chain bookmarks for new players longing on. "Who fucked the bookmarks?" Was the most common phrase used in my old Corp during that time.
---
i like it
---
&gt; Q: So you're telling me that if the Rorqual I just blew up in Delve has his API on zkill then I can't see it even though I posted it manually until it's an hour old?!
---
No. We are not going to give you our keys again, get out.
---
much appreciated dude. will try this out for sure
---
Working rl will log me in later
---
Okay, thanks for the answer. I agree, it shouldn't be hard, and I like the change. Just when I have someone (the tinfoil guy) spread bad info from bad sources I try to curtail it so I figured I'd ask.
---
Yea I’d really suggest you try it on the test server before actually doing it. I had a few very close calls in my first few tests cuz I was new to T4s. If I didnt have past experience from T1s and T2s about how abyssal works in general I wouldve died a ton.

---
You can still see it. And since you are away from your PC, you are even less affected. Who cares if it's delayed a bit?
---
I hadn't even noticed but I suppose it is.
---
 Find my bots. 
---
:D :D :D :D :D
---
Squizz, **thank you** for making this blackout even more interesting and dynamic. 
---
In regards to your proposed changes, I am personally in favor of this. I think delayed killmails will encourage more watchful behavior and put an emphasis on user-collected intel.
---
Why are there so many people who think their play style is the only valid one and every one else can go fuck themselves..
---
Personally I love the idea of com's tower's that give us normal local and that players can shoot to offline giving us a blackout it will be a brilliant tactical and strategic system for alliances to play with, but that's not what we have at the moment.
---
I was in Darkness for 2 months. Worst of my eve career. They had a 3rd party tool. Every hostile in region was reported in intel channel. That intel channel was somehow linked to you location. If the hostile was closer then 5j from you position it made a beeping sound for you. So you can get safe.   
---
No one said Local was perfect intel. But i used to roam a lot and i know how it is to waste time and everything docks because i get reported in from local chat 10j from any action. Countless nights with no kills.
---
You rang?
---
That's just gay.
---
No they were already hostile. I warped in and warped out.
---
I'd like to add another question to this:
---
If there was a delay in killmails being posted ( an hour, a day ) to the api, how would people feel about _all_ killmails being put out in a public feed?
---
Lowsec empty all my kills have migrated to null in covops
---
What about a global delay of 1 hour everywhere? Why is low and highsec different intel-wise?
---
Using dscan? Aligning? Setting traps?
---
fuck this man, im checking out zkill every 15 mins or so because im used to it, it fucking hurts my brain, i think im on withdrawal or something
---
\+1
---
Now, now. Don't be so pessimistic. Any sane implementation of observatories would necessarily allow for anyone to erect an observatory in any system. Hostiles would be more than capable of constructing their own where they chose to hunt. Of course, this would require them committing something to their pursuit, and, well, we all know how that story ends.
---
You moved to a wh...  to escape not having local?
---
Lol it told you someone was around DESPITE THEM BEING CLOAKED. and it's still a weekday, the real fun starts on saturday.
---
username checks out?
---
No, any website isn't a cloud service. You can most definitely run your own server in your own building which you own and have it host a website.
---
Cloud stuff becomes increasingly "cloud-y" as you from from on-prem to XaaS stuff: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
---
Stealing from [BMC's Blog](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/) where there's a [great image](https://blogs.bmc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-810x754.png), there's increasing loss of control as you head towards SaaS - what's most often thought of as "cloud".
---
Some examples are, from the same site, starting with least-control towards most-control:
---
* SaaS: Google Apps, Dropbox, Salesforce
---
* PaaS: Azure, Heroku, OpenShift
---
* IaaS: Linode, Digital Ocean, AWS, Azure
---
You'll notice that some services/cloud providers can straddle things a bit; just look at which extra red boxes on the image that they provide from one to the next to see which parts fall into the next-right-moving layer. As an example, Azure provides virtual hardware instances which you manage - IaaS - but also provides virtual hardware instances with Windows - PaaS - as well.
---
Depending on how openly available/open source your hardware/servers/runtime/middleware/OS is depends on how potentially fucked you can be if a proprietary XaaS provider dies.
---
Networking/hardware/servers/virtualization are the most open; you can pick whatever networking tech, storage, servers, hardware virtualization tech you want, for the most part. OS to middleware to runtime to applications gets fuzzier, but there's both completely OSS (Linux/Wildfly/OpenJDK) all the way to closed (Windows/IIS/.NET Framework) (vs .NET Core). Data is even MORE fuzzy depending on whether or not you can move it, it's in a standard format, some other software can do something with it, you understand it, and so on.
---
In this case, EVE's data is open-ish and documented enough that you can get/interpret whatever CCP provides in the static data export (SDE); however, your access to live data is dependent on SaaS. ZKillBoard is totally SaaS and, other than whatever data matches up with CCP/SDE data, also closed source/closed data. And since it's closed, the level of "fucked when they take it away from you" is "total".
---
This guy gets it
---
Does anyone know if drifters spawn on the test server? 
---
And can anyone confirm if they still have the doomsday (I assume they don't have the overshield mechanic)? Cause there was an early thread on /r/eve that said that they have neither the overshield nor the DD, but I was watching /u/jintaan  video on Drifters, and he mentioned that they do have a DD, with a 20' cooldown, that does \~600k omni damage.
---
4:41, fuck that purple guy anyways.
---
The upside down
---
Can confirm
---
Seems legit
---
From a casual players perspective, I hate the change. For me, Eve used to be something done after work, while watching a movie or doing something else in the meantime. Having to pay more attention to excavator hunters or booshers is not fun nor relaxing.
---
Lol its over already. Im just all over the place. Auga isnt actually my home :P
---
I don't know about delaying lowsec killmails if lowsec doesn't have a significant shift in intel availability. So, any areas with delayed local should have the same behavior. Immediate for hisec and lowsec, delayed KMs for null and anoikis.
---
However, I think another consideration should be the ability to share your killmail at will or generate battle reports after combat. Like, if you manual post a KM it posts and you can share its URL to link directly. But it wouldn't show up on a system, alliance, corp, etc. page until after the appropriate delay period?
---
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE HOLE CONTROL.
---
Delaying it in wormholes doesn't make sense to me. We all want to fight, knowing someone was active in a hole you connect to increases the chance of finding them and getting a fight
---
Yeah I checked local and not a single goon to be found
---
Delays are cool &amp; Good
---
I take it then it was from one of those RC peeps?
---
Im working, hopefully can join you guys later. Finding decent fights?
---
Underrated comment right here
---
IDK, I don't think third party tools should follow suit. Given you're the only game in town, I'm seeing this as pretty harmful to entities without their own kb backend software. Plus it sucks cause I want to prepare for a roam later and am looking for certain targets. :P
---
If CCP wanted to extend the blackout conditions to third party sites they could do so through the API.
---
Sounds about right. I can't imagine a sane person actually ratting in nullsec.
---
Haven't seen a single ship in anomaly for like 2-3 hours roam from bwf to deep kalevala, except rorq which killed our ceptor and gave zero fucks cause we couldn't scratch him. Got some good fights with homedefs istead, space really felt alive.
---
Oh i agree, just arm chairing enjoying my popcorn.
---
Sounds like a lovely plan!
---
So you’re away from your PC but must be ‘live streaming’ zkill ....makes perfect sense
---
We just need to kill dotlan and it will be perfect
---
Wait zkill is dead?
---
Nice wood.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cccni6/blackout_is_here_get_your_thumb_insured 
---
Right there perfect intel. Its called perfect intel all over the place. 
---
And your talking about near2. But near2 is only as strong as those using it. And doesn't give "perfect" intel, just a warning. And thats the point of intel channels. People would still be making mistakes, people die with near up.
---
BUT MUH KILLBOARD!!!!
---
I think this has to come from CCP delaying that information. Otherwise I think it will be down to players to willingly stop themselves from using a competing website that doesn't delay killmails. In which case we may as well argue that players should just stop using zKill.
---
Yup. Love to see the amounts of bots dying right now. Suck that this also has to affect Zkill for the lulz.
---
A killboard is great intel about enemy doctrines for example, even with a delay. Imo killmails shouldn't get public without someone involved actually sharing it.
---
...you can't fully close all holes in your home. New ones will always spawn and you can be rolled into. Best you can do is crit your holes, and the Nestor is a thing that exists.
---
Not sure if you have been reading the past few months of dev blogs, but you should.
---
I wish I had hole control when my uncle comes over for christmas :(
---
Personally I'd rather not have to wait an hour to check for info on kill mails I was a part of. Maybe have the kills be processed at full speed, but held from visibility on profiles, systems, and corp pages for an hour? That way those with the link can use it but it won't be used as intel?
---
do it! withhold for 1 hour. its a good idea.
---
So local being in existence has various parts of the game balanced around it. So when you delete local when do you address the other aspects? Or do you do the CCP thing and wait for people bro point them out for you.
---
Just be patient and lets see what happends. This is needed. Look at all those boting region empty now. I saw gate camps and ppl roaming. it is amazing.
---
Do tell
---
Personally, I use zkill for intel but mostly for abyssal space. I check it briefly to see if abyssal pvp is actually active without wasting time running a t3 to check. Other than that, I don’t see the delay being a huge issue in my life because I’m almost always a lowsec player.
---
My Corp is having a blast, literally haven't even heard anyones in goons complain. Even Mittani sounded happy about it.
---
I support this solution. Hell, I'll put my own api into zkill now for that benefit.
---
I’d pay money for an Attenborough doc about gaming and gamers.
---
You're an awfully narrow-minded bigot.
---
Enjoy it. Soon goons will have a way around it that makes them adapt to it better. Then you will all be screeching that it's not fair and to turn it back on. 
---
Like how goons said delete supers and everyone else said they were fine. Now everyone says delete supers because goons have the most.
---
Sorry, maybe I'm being dense. What do you mean by the "HOWEVER"?
---
Surely in order for zkb to get the killmail at all one of the entities on it would have to be API verified.
---
do it 
---
limit instant perfect intelligence
---
you know things are bad when getting a noctis is the kill chose to demonstrate the quality of your blops dropping
---
Im actually a huge fan of the black out. But i just felt like the narrative being spun around it was bs. Its a fantastic way for ccp to outsource a bot purge. And we're seeing it be effective, which is awesome.
---
Using Dscan doesn't work on force recon  and cloaked ships.  Aligning is probably not enough against d scan immune ships.  Setting traps will typically only work if you already got people ready for a cyno ( ie the bigger guys).  It also will only work if the hunter doesnt have his own group.  So my original question still stands.
---
So many people taking over each other. Pure aids.
---
yep, squizz replaced the normal page with just a black page. he just made the blackout even more awesome
---
Its 35mm rough cut beech, down to around 28mm once plane'd. its 15 year dry though, so its a biach to do by hand, and its all slightly twisted, making it difficult to get a straight plank out of

i added the brackets because it was wobbling like a new born giraffe, its much steadier now, but the front legs are still "weak" 
---
i would normally sand it up to 2500 grit, but i went lazy and stopped at 400 and slapped some of the local wood oil on it (cannot for the life of me think of the name atm) it stinks... 
---
ill probably take it up the rest of the way tomorrow before second coat of oil. 
---
As for diagonals. ive been trying to figure how to add them without getting in the way of my legs
---
There is nothing such as perfect intel. It mainly became a term after watchlist changes. People use it in the place of "intel" and justify bad arguments.
---
There is too much intel and too little intel. Different arguments can be made on how much is too much. One could argue local is too much intel.
---
Confirming was fun as hell roaming around!
---
Just saying the usual formula is to mass test those structures. I really doubt CCP will release them without us knowing before hand.
---
&gt;Yes. If any char or corp on the killmail is API verified and the kill is  in nullsec then you'll have to wait until the killmail is an hour old.
---
Have you considered doing the reverse? A benefit for registering essentially? Allow people that have linked their Zkill/Eve to see the killmails immediately or with a smaller delay, whereas people that haven't cannot.
---
I think it would increase registered traffic to the site and some really interesting things could happen if gangs are able to find a killmail from a couple minutes ago, and bust into the system without local up and going.
---
Extended addition to my [comment response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cc9gel/zkillboard_down_for_blackout/etmbs4a/): while EVE is also SaaS, if EVE is gone/down then all the stuff about it becomes irrelevant other than history/amusement.
---
CCP DOES provide, well... [limited endpoints to acquire the data you might want](https://www.reddit.com/r/evetech/comments/afgojp/confusion_as_to_obtaining_killmails/). ZKB has (had?) just made it a lot easier as well as kept a nicer history. It *COULD* be re-engineered and recent-ish data rescraped from CCP; such an undertaking is somewhere between [unfeasible and non-trivial](https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/07/17/understanding_engineers_feasibility). Probably. We'll see how long it's black, then determine the feasibility if it's still a problem.
---
I love you Squizz, do your thing fam
---
Well, that would simply be high sec, excluding the effects and rat type.
---
Buff to high sec sounds great! /s
---
local has always been one of the issues, no single change will solve the many problems with eve. 
---
&gt; We could take a roam out any day of the week and run into another couple of roaming gangs no problem. We still can. Literally nothing has changed for us.
---
calm down mr dinkle
---
Dude!
---
I helped
---
im confused about the api thing: so if no one involved has an api in zkill but someone manually posts the km, there's no delay, otherwise there is? imo it should just be no delay if someone posts manually, or just always delay: that seems a bit weird.
---
Oh buddy, you've opened a can of worms.  Perago has all those chat logs.  I'm gonna sit back with some popcorn and enjoy.
---
I honestly hope it stays this way. Now jumping out of my spooky wormhole is that much spookier.
---
&gt; Garmur is an terribly overprized ship  
---
&gt; have ^some use in ^PvP ^^as ^^well  
---
close your ears to the garmur hate r/eve preaches mate it's not good for anyone  
---
i'm just going to say it: is garmur an okay ship, no ofc its not its fukken ballers dude
---
you can fit lml+long point+scram+mwd and pvp other people from the next system while overall being a massive faggot, longpoint is also handy in gangs  
---
or you can fit rocket+scram+web+dual prop and skirmish around it's all taste really
---
you want t2 rockets and missiles, missile support skills, navigation support skills, eventually gal frig v/cal frig v
---
Some things will need a look, others not.  Rather than tweaking existing things I'd prefer something new though.  I mean if you're going to restore some intel, I'd prefer it wasn't an "observatory".  It may be that no local is fine, better even.  We'll see over the next few weeks.
---
Why would you never say thank you to squizz?
---
No querns, you just want to look like a troll but just come out as retarded.
---
 **\[Multiple Items\]** anyone buying a Thanny?
---
Shit wrong chat!
---
It's just the most recent one. Happened like an hour before he posted that, so seemed fitting :P
---
I eagerly await your tip on how to align while mining in a Rorqual.
---
(And yes, I know the actual fix is to cyno in the umbrella)
---
&gt; No
---
That's what I thought. I'll trust you not to speak to matters you have no place in, from now onwards. I'm glad we had this discussion.
---
Why does only null-sec get this benefit?
---
Praxis shit fit works up until C4.
---
And, that means it's not perfect Intel. And that doesn't address all the free Intel players get from dotlan.
---
No, it does not.
---
Bots are done with for some time until they adjust. Idiots quit. Everyone else is ready. Win-win for everybody.
---
No, I edited that on there as a demonstration of what it would look like.
---
The question answer itself, because TEST.
---
Doing a great job at "pretending"!
---
Lets be honest - for now give 1 day delay for all killmails.        
---
From what i noticed people ... undock and roam because they don't know about gatecamps earlier visible on zkill.
---
It is perfect if what you need Intel on is "who could possibly shoot me right now?"
---
Making a decentralized killboard would actually be kind of cool.
---
Alliances or corps could run their own instances, their members could register their API with their preferred providers. Kills gathered by those individual killboards would then propagate over some P2P protocol so that everyone always has an as complete set as possible.
---
Squizz, I agree. You know I was camping a guy while cloaked today and went to look him up on zkill and realized wow, it's just my first nature to do this now. Maybe with a delay we can keep some of the spookiness going.
---
Maybe also consider the delay global, or at least all of non hisec?
---
Wrong class. Whales are mammals. We’re reptiles.
---
but you are still gay
---
https://i.giphy.com/media/2UvAUplPi4ESnKa3W0/giphy.webp
---
it's hilarious someone got mad enough to pay him to do it.
---
Suggestion: limit KM data where if you’re not on the KM, you don’t see what the fit/drop was, only who/where/time.
---
Verified corp API’s of the person who got blown up get to see the drop/fit for reimbursement. 
---
Keep it up! I love what you’re doing.
---
Didn't you just post this? Poor guy at 4:41 :(
---
what promises were broken?
---
how about no
---
Because local never made sense to begin with. 
---
I'm all for adding a structure that brings that service back online, to SOME degree, but the original implementation of local in nullsec is just dumb.
---
I was.. trying to be nice.
---
_One_ of the entities, yes. Ignoring manually submitted KMs, at least.
---
The proposed change would have all of a parties killmails delayed, no matter the source, if that party is API verified on zkb.
---
Eve is a year older than wow.
---
Exactly this...
---
I'll say this, and I'm likely I'm the minority:
---
As a small entity we often rely on zkill and such tools to avoid getting roflstomped by larger entities. 
---
We live in facwar low sec and take every remotely "fair" fight we can. Zkill often helps us avoid the larger blobs that we simply cannot match.
---
We do not have the resources to create our own KB or have alts everywhere to scout things out. Larger entities can do this fairly easily I suspect though. So I'd imaging a delayed local would penalize smaller groups more than larger ones. 
---
Delaying local would hurt our playstyle more than it would help.
---
How so?
---
I love this idea
---
Personally i would remove killboards in a heartbeat, but having a 1 hour delay is nice.
---
My only point against it is for the battle reports if you delay those even longer it becomes yesterdays news maybe bypass 100vs100 kills so we can get a battle report after the fight and shit post on the same day then again we often wait an hour for the updates and post anyways so it might not be a problem.
---
That’s been fixed for about a year now iirc. Could be more or less. But definitely fixed.
---
It'd take quite a bit of effort to make a significant impact on the usefulness of *intelligence* you could gather (so-and-so flies HICs all the time vs. is-a-hot-dropper) as long as rival groups didn't cooperate to both not share data from an engagement.
---
Also, I think you're misunderstanding the use of the word "perfect" in "perfect Intel"
---
What you said would be perfect Intel would actually be complete Intel.
---
The use of perfect is to mean that it's absolutely accurate in what it conveys.
---
An Intel channel with manual reporting is imperfect, as people could be wrong or lying or any other number of things. But local is perfect as it's specifically verified and confirmed by the game.
---
actually delaying km is just dumb asf, we should have the option to choose.
---
Great stream today, Super enjoyable to watch
---
Delay it all 24 hours! Killboards are a great archive/recording website, but it should not be misused for realtime intel.
---
https://gph.is/1KmgWbn

GF volta
---
It's amazing that most of the people biting this bad bait are actually goons.
---
I think it's fucking stupid. What is the point of messing with zkill for a dumb ass CCP event? Just be a public resource or people will go elsewhere.
---
No.
---
I think what people mean by "perfect intel" is that it's intel that has no counter-play. Everyone is reported in local, instantly, all the time (chat problems not withstanding). There is no way to change that without just leaving the system, but then even that is reported in local.
---
EverQuest and Ultima would like a work with ur candy ass carebear mmo
---
Yeah delayed would be better, no skill would be a killer without scrapheap
---
That would be absolutely fine in this case.
---
How much isk did this 'accidentally' rake in?  Order magnitude?
---
Ah, insta's.
---
When ratters dock up against hunters they have no hope of fighting : "Coward/crab/PvE only lol"
---
When hunters don't fight ratters that can fight : "Being smart"
---
You should totally add a delay!
---
Absolutely support this idea.
---
Please please please leave it like this for an extended period, so nullbears actually adapt to it and we get to see what it actually does for the game. If they think it will be short they'll just reee and refuse to undock, and as well as not being fun, it also won't tell you anything.
---
Can't wait to watch this later. Love you videos Jin!
---
I dig it. It makes New Eden feel bigger somehow.
---
If CCP is going to keep the API running as-is without an enforced delay, I think long-term it might make sense for people who would already have access to that information (e.g. the person who was final blow / victim, or corp d directors) to be able to see the kill if they are logged in via SSO and for them to share a link with an access token attached which allows it to be seen.
---
In effect this would mean that the people involved would still have the same access as they do in the EVE client, and could share those kills through zKills interface, but I wouldn't be able to see &lt;X&gt; name and plug it into zKill and see everyone he's flying with / where with no delay.
---
They fairly commonly don't show up for a min or 2.
---
Wait, are cloaky boson titans a thing?
---
So Basically we had a rule of not feeding in highsec for a little while and he didn't take the message lightly.

 [https://i.imgur.com/wzvIcOD.gif](https://i.imgur.com/wzvIcOD.gif)
---
Sounds about right, not sure why you are making a difference from one region to another, just delay everything one hour and be done with it.
---
Why am I in a heron.
---
The thing with sites like that is you can always post the killmail manually, if you receive it immediately. But yeah, CCP could make the automated data collection (through ESI) have a much longer delay time.
---
please teach me how to get curses on dscan sensei
---
I'm surprised they haven't decided that it's a good time for a Burn Jita.
---
Same here, I get to log in tonight to check in on industry jobs, catch a fleet if I'm lucky, but will be traveling for work all weekend.
---
Ok so who's making the new killboard?
---
Even aligning in an Orca isnt really feasible versus cloakers or for mining in general ( you gotta stay near the rock to mine it and cant stay at speed forever.)
---
Wait, so does this mean i should come back with my solo play as a Tengu space pirate stalking relics? honestly, is it better now for solo players? without everyone docking the moment I enter space?
---
He dislikes gankers
---
I'm of two minds about delaying kill mails.  On the one hand, I'm sure groups use it as part of intel tools to see roaming gangs and fleets and thus avoid conflict.  
---
On the other, we have tools that we use to find fights as they're happening, so we can get to the content in a reasonable amount of time.  An hour delay would mean that any small scale fight would be over long before we any interested parties could get there to participate.
---
So basically this would make it easier to fight people who don't want to, but hard to find people who want to fight/are fighting.
---
In balance I know I'd rather participate in fights/find them in real time than have an easier time farming PvE players, so generally I'm negative on a delay.
---
Local just needs to be available for the alliance and friends. This would circumvent all the confusion, but still allow hunters to roam. I think this will be the eventual change.
---
Hear Hear!
---
Nice
---
Delay it to one update per day - at DT
---
I don't really want you to delay killmails. That just gives an advantage to groups large enough to have their own killboards with enough APIs to have meaningful data (like goons ...).
---
Convince CCP to delay the API endpoint instead.
---
Delay 1 hour
---
By monitoring the cluster they mean we had to clean out the dead hamsters finally and it takes a few days.
---
Meh. Roamed for an hour from a static in detroid. Ran across multiple gangs and a massive home def fleet from FRT, all within a few jumps.
---
Shit was tight.

---
Well, the issue with the wobble is that you have no real jointery going on.
---
You have wood stuck butt end to flat end, with a little piece of chinese steel screwed into place.
---
Look into a kreg jig for pocket holes, or ask around to your friends and see if anyone has a biscuit jointer. They are strong.
---
You could also install some cross braces as well to provide for some stability.
---
Please allow for the posting and immediate displaying of killmails like currently is available with the 'post' link. This should only be available to people that have the ESI link from the ingame killmail and post it to zkillboard, and not available even if they refresh the page after posting the killmail.
---
I use zkill to check and be sure I looted the good stuff, other people will probably not post killmails manually if they only get a 'success' type of message instead of being able to immediately review the killmail that was posted.
---
I'm kind of torn, the idea makes sense but I think people use zkill to research fits and share kills more than actual 'live' intel - maybe that's just me. 
---
The delay might give an advantage to people with larger intel networks since someone can link an in-game killmail but people outside those channels are blind - but maybe that is the intent?
---
Really its just an hour seems like a long time.
---
This is an awesome reply. And agree its not perfect, and low effort.
---
Close, but I'd say "when a hunter determines the risk of loss exceeds the chance of a kill and doesn't engage"
---
Other than that, a perfect summary.   Proud of ya!
---
&gt;I keep seeing posts about local being perfect intel, and I cant help but disagree. Perfect intel would be exact location in system, ship type, fitting, ect.
---
Oh look, it's the deliberately obtuse argument that intentionally conflates accuracy and precision for the 800th time.
---
You can really tell which ones are the elite peeveepeers in this thread 😄
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Yea delay kills for sure.
---
I love you
---
i would have been fine with delays but the overall stats of corps are pretty important intel i use all the time. this is really irritating.
---
Do it, squizz. I like using zkill for intel but its a little too good, a delay is just what it needs.
---
i wish i could roll away your posting
---
Navigating in eve without dotlan is pure cancer.
---
Remove the stats but keep the map active. That would be ok
---
So I used to play eve quite a bit as a solo pilot.  My favorite past time really became hunting Relic sites in null sec in my tengu, playing the occasional space pirate.  I would also do some worm-holing, but always solo.  
---
So I understand the new changes make it so people cant know i'm in their space unless I talk in the chat.  Similar to wormholes.  
---
Has this improved the type of play I describe? I mean previously I would end up with multi-boxerschasing me with their slaved accounts.  And everyone docking whenever I enter system.    
---
I used to love the thrill of sneaking through territories, plotting that path, running a gate camp with my nullifier and cloak up.
---
I'd fly in this fleet
---
Fact.   The lion doesn't go for the strongest gazelle.  It picks of the easy ones that don't, or can't, fight back.
---
Higgs rig, covetors, porpoise.
---
&gt; Why are there so many people who think their play style is the only valid one and every one else can go fuck themselves..
---
that's what pretty much everyone except the nullblobs were wondering the last couple years
---
Oh, that’s spicy.
---
You know nothing John Snow
---
fuckin squizz man
---
blackout is amazing. just fc'd a small home def gang vs some thorax with t1 logi. nearly equal numbers. (i think lol rip zkill) and ya it was just a  really good time. PROBABLY wouldnt have ever happened with local because everyone would have docked up or already hot dropped them.
---
Local changes are good, gassing all intel kills a very essential part of the game and as you said it if not you someone else will do it anyways. Think about small corporations and solo roamers. &gt;!You are literally bending the knee to people who don't even play the game my dude just shitpost on reddit.!&lt; 
---
Because haulers don't check gatecamps or roamers dotlan as well as wormholers system killboards or who is active or who is not right? Kill the stats for all I care so we won't have those elite people who just jerk off to how many ships they blew up, but I disagree with zero intel. You guys just think there is some dystopian Eve where everything gets solved and one of which is disabling third party addons, do that and people will just turn to big blocs more and more. I thought we were supposed to fight against that?
---
I gotta say, it's hard to enjoy streams that have ended :(
---
It's sad, as an afk player I can't even see if it have a big impact on the game..
---
you are probly fine with diagonals on the two sides and one across (or two, crisscross) the back. that should cover the normal forces relative to your two-plane orientation (not counting both of the 2 parallel planes, their normal forces are on the same direction). good on you for just building and being willing to iterate!
---
god forbid you have to play the actual game. No joke just play one of the thousands of cookie clickers or non pvp korean mmos.
---
Just do a poll dude, comments are a bad way to gauge. It's a loud minority typically.
---
Straw man.
---
The problem with Local is that it's free, perfect and instantaneous. If you want to argue for local chat to be delayed by 1 hour like the jump/kill stats, then I'm pretty sure all the 'delete local' folk would be fine with that.
---
I wonder how much Goons paid him so it wouldn't show exactly how many bots they really have in delve.
---
I dont see the connection between counter play and calling it perfect intel. To me that would be non consensual intel. Cause obv the hunter doesnt want to be in intel, and the prey does. But non consensual is what eves all about. The prey doesn't want you killing them, just like hunter doesn't want to be seen about to pounce, yet people die all the time with local up. Some.... 23hr a day players dont die, cause they have perfect attentiveness.
---
I guess we have a different definition of perfect is, because I don't think local provided perfect Intel.
---
The goons not excited for this are idiots
---
Aye :)
---
Perfect would encompass complete, because perfect would be complete.
---
&gt; Nevermind, I got booted
---
  So what did you do
---
...Says the krab who still has an umbrella.
---
The one thing I would agree with in this area is that the K162 gamble timer should start as soon as the new sig spawns, not only if you warp to it.
---
Yes please. Seriously I wish someone else would come along.
---
You have my support!  Delay it all by an hour
---
How dare Squizz making changes to a free tool!
---
I think you understand the user story of an EVE player very well and I fully support your judgement in how you operate your product.
---
This is so true, I'm not sure why most of the wormholers I've come across are so fucking bitchy or look at anyone else but wormholers as the bastion of eves last pvp group. 
---
There are a select few that don't act like that though, albeit they are more rare.
---
dual web + caldary navy ammo + standard crash booster + 5 lvl aplication skill +3% aplication implants.
---
I don’t mind getting tackled by something that is up to kill me. I acted as bait several times, against bombers, t3c or small cap drops. And it was fun. But having to take care of small unexpected stuff that wants to kill excavators is the opposite of fun.
---
solid advice
---
Goons don't have their own killboard
---
What you need is two battleships fitted with higgs rig, and a cap with MWD. One pass and this will pretty much roll any wh that allows caps to go through.
---
I wouldn't put the delay on kills for your site. Ultimately it is up to you of course, but doing this will kind of screw the little guys who don't necessarily have a bunch of tech savvy guys who can create their own alliance killboard. 
---
What I think would happen will be that Imperium, Pamfam and other large coalitions would create their own KB because they have the techs that could do it, while the little guys would be stuck with using your delayed information.
---
I think if the delay should exist it should come from CCP so that everyone is on an even playing field.
---
You would not believe in how fun is to mine for 5 hours and press D-Scan for 3000 times.
---
Its so fun!
---
Then stop playing and move on
---
\*calmly logs into World of Warships\* \*designs alloys in After Protocol\* \*enjoys his day\*
---
I like it :)
---
The problem I see is that even though you might do this, there's nothing really stopping another group from making a third party tool for grabbing kill feeds within their own groups etc.
---
I'd really like to see a delay on LS, NS, and w-space kills - but I'd rather that delay comes from CCP's own end so that no individual party can work a new third party tool to their advantage.
---
It tells you with absolute accuracy who is logged on in a system.
---
I guess you could make an argument that, because it doesn't show you if they're docked or not, it is slightly imperfect. But even that actually helps krabs because a hunter can't tell whether those names in local are even targets, whereas the krab can assume that a new name jumped in and panic dock.
---
Even with a higgs rig it is still likely that a cloaky can decloak lock and scram you before you get out.  As well it just slows down the time you have to essentially reset your position.  It also takes up a spot away from either mining amount/ a command burst rig for mining typically /  Tank against rats.  Covetors and Porpises honestly dont get alot at all and they usually arent worth it, they also still have the align time and get out issues.  They still have all the issues if not more so than my original point.
---
Really? That's pretty surprising. I know they have a lot of ESI backed useful tools. Would they tell you if they did?
---
Took us about 5 minutes to run into VNI krabs in Det. Theyre still there, and not at all hard to find.
---
Reeee
---
I am in an average alliance without a super umbrella more more than a year.
---
Now, because of this update, obviously i will leave everything that i built (logistics, infrastrcutures) and live in a WH, OBVIOUSLY.
---
IQ &lt; 70?  That's a pity.
---
Conversely if someone goes to krab in a system and a hostile is there they can't know if that person is active or afk, while a hunter in system can reasonably expect a new target is either in a station or on a gate now. It works both ways with advantage to whoever was in the system first.
---
Fight was over fast
---
Perfect means the information is verified accurate.
---
Perfect doesn't mean complete. It means the information is perfectly accurate.
---
It's also not knowing that there is another gang roaming in the same system with you.
---
So then a critical choice between risk and reward must be made.
---
Id call that a successful change.
---
If you can figure out how to play they built it then you can figure out how to play after they changed it.
---
Oops took the bait
---
I'd be willing to have my corp put it's API in your kb if we could have the option to set it to completely private and our kb's would only be accessible to us. Otherwise, it provides no value to give enemies free kb info and I'll continue to push for any corp/alliance I'm in to have their kb's removed. Nothing personal or anything, because zkill does provide a legitimately good service/experience but it is also extremely detrimental for pvpers.
---
Wasnt there an entire Ed, Edd and Eddy episode with this premise?
---
Yeah. "link KM! linnk KM!" see why you're an idiot yet?
---
I'm just waiting to jump into a random null sec system and be hit with TIDI cos there's 900 cloaked T3C hunters all trying to combat scan a single VNI bot in a POS.
---
Hi, today someone askme abput what happen with the old alliances of renters (wermt dot dot dot and the others but no find referenece in the alliance biographies.) what groups are renting now ?
---
Goons don't use zkill on a Corp level (for the most part) anywhere you list  that stuff you compromise your position and give out free Intel,  remove your esi protect yourself
---
Did you miss the joke?
---
This wouldn't affect researching unless you're only interested in the last hour of kills.
---
You should add the newbies in the background asking in local why no one is showing up in their chat.
---
^this delay only benefits the mega blocs
---
&gt; Convince CCP to delay the API endpoint instead. 
---
One day maybe
---
Go for it.
---
The cloaky proteus reigns supreme again! And it is right behind you!
---
Well written thoughtful post, thank you. /s
---
Yes, please.
---
You still have near2,it's not like that function went it way it just takes more effort than a bot scrubbing local. Now they have to scrub gate overviews.
---
I think it would have to be done at an ESI level, otherwise what's to stop larger groups from creating their own tool to utilize their vast network of players as an advantage over the little groups.
---
Lame af....
---
If killboards didn't exist how would you adapt?
---
So much this, there are kills (like killing your own cyno alts) that are sensitive info you as player should have full control over. That's also main reason why I'm never going to provide my own ESI to any killboard service that's not either under my full control or part of alliance mandatory ESI suite - there are kills that should stay hidden forever.
---
Your behavior is not in line with our community standards, please enjoy your seven-day silence and kys.
---
I have the same bad habit...
---
Oh so it would only be delayed if the victim or his corp had their API linked. That makes sense.
---
I thought manual posting wasn't possible any more but I just remembered it was copy/paste posting which was disabled and you can still post with the URL. Whoops
---
Mmm not really.  THe choice there is literally to do something worthwhile and probably die, or make it not worthwhile and just not do it.  THat's not a successful change at all and swings towards risk far too much.  These are essentially the same problems that were had before.  All about that pendulum of balance again just opposite this time.  One time is too far into safe, this may be too far into risk.
---
Testing
---
upvotrd for telling the truth
---
I am not sure how many active bot programers are left for Eve.
---
The market has shrunk as the game has and a lot of people just rely on old bots.
---
It behaves in the reverse now...
---
100 percent support
---
But you get a killmail. In-game. Share it in fleet chat yo
---
concurrent numbers are tracking about 1k less than last week.  so eh, there is a drop.  and given that the novelty might get some people to log on, i'd expect a larger drop after the weekend it the experiment continues.
---
Easy to create a link to see kills, not really a solution.
---
upvoted....prosecco is starting to kick in
---
I’m a friendliboi now, next time I think it’s a perma
---
What an original comeback!
---
There is a much better active gila fit that will do every t4 abyssal site except for Dark and it's not really that expensive (350 mil maybe). I'm at work right now and don't have the fit saved, but can share it when I get home.
---
Do it squizz!
---
Cool, although I prefer passive fits, but to each their own ideas and work.
---
It's a solid 500+ mill per hour mate not including really expensive skill books.
---
Also if you run the sites fast enough (bling + implants) you can dc reconnect and still have time to finish the site.
---
I really dislike that zkill is the only game in town. I really opened up my API and db a few years ago hoping to promote competition but after nearly five years still nobody
---
I’m not complaining but I’m also very confused..
---
I played this game since 2003. I think I do. How about you STFU and stop crying if you can't handle comments.
---
yes pls!
---
Think bigger. This goes both ways, a relic hunter may skip a hole if there is recent activity.
---
Tell us how you really feel. Open up your heart!
---
Share the killmail in game
---
delete killboard so shit pvp players could say they are awesome ..just delay kills..return board pls..do you know how many ppl use it as intel ..like 10% ..mby
---
"WAHH!! make easy kills easier.. WAAAHHHH!! I don't want even a hint of a possibility that those indys know I'm about to gank them with my combat ship WAAAHHH!!!"
---
This is exactly what you are.
---
every single absolute without a formal proof is inconclusive(this one included btw), we don't need formal proofs for colloquial language however, that's dumb. Stop bikeshedding mate
---
i need highres!
---
So I'll get to catch more herons but miss the PvP corp nearby... Nice...
---
Ok idc :)
---
Do whatever you want man.  Delay it.  Delete it.  Do nothing.   Do what you want with the website.  It is in the end, yours.    Lets delay it and cause people more trouble!   In the end, in my opinion, the kill-board is supposed to be for record keeping, looking back, maybe saving and finding fits, seeing activity in the past but not as an intelligence tool for quick and live intel.
---
Yes please.
---
I like the idea but the urge to see your latest kill on killboard is quite strong too. My thoughts are along the line that maybe it could be possible to delay certain details coming up until certain amount of  time has passed. Things like system, alliances, maybe even names of participants (and numbers). Not sure if this would be viable option of course :) 
---
Love the blackout idea anyways, this is EVE before killboards were a thing :)
---
I had something going but then CCP announced no AT and that took all the wind out of my sails. To create a killboard is a serious undertaking and to have a rich killboard would require a diverse set of people giving their APIs. Why have multiple sources when the current source is pretty good?
---
Yis, delay it. Best decision right there.
---
Just giving out the facts, won't stop any battleship worm holes just a heads up.
---
Marauders are also super good at this
---
I want a refund.
---
Also multi-boxers and botters devalue ingame effort causing ingame prices to drop.
---
This means PLEX can buy more ingame, so people can buy fewer PLEX.
---
From that perspective CCP would profit from multi-boxers and botters no longer operating. Reality is its probably mostly neutral.
---
can you delete this thread?
---
Was he the boot guy? Bitching about pixel densities and shit?
---
It's Mikal Vektor!
---
You know I was originally pretty pissed off at you, thinking you openly countering the decision by CCP to make Null Local delayed by tearing down a resource that we all love and use (which yes, you do have the right to do). Now that I've actually read this, I am so much more at ease and supportive of your decision and your ideas in the post above. I personally think that delaying them will have a very beneficial effect on combat by allowing us to focus on fighting rather that Killboard Naval Gazing when we should be reshipping or countering a loss.
---
Keep up the hard work :-)
---
Ah, where's your spirit of adventure, Paco? If you roll the wormhole then you'll never get the chance to see who might come through it.
---
Perfect intel does not mean complete intel.
---
It means that the intel you get is perfect. It is never wrong. You know exactly who is in system, what system they are in, and when they enter/leave.
---
&gt; So with this, could you stop telling lies. Thanks
---
Was... was that directed at me?
---
I think the community is just as confused as you are. The only way I see that happening is if someone gifted you Omega time. Even then I'm pretty sure in today's eve they'd have to transfer Plex to you and you'd have to activate the game time.
---
I heard a fantastic saying once:
---
"If four people sit at a table to talk to a Nazi, there are five Nazis."
---
I don't think you should be the guy to do this squizz.
---
Whereas I like the idea in general, it should be at CCPs end.
---
This change will hurt smaller groups and entities, mostly those who roam and look for fights. I am not against the world having more danger in it, or uncertainty, but it'll be trivial for a large group to make a killboard, force ceos to apply their corp API, and thus have instant defensive Intel when people come knocking.
---
Large groups don't need more benefits. Zkill offers smaller guys all the same Intel they get, which is great. If you make this change a zkill clone will come along and replace for that functionality alone. 
---
Solving this at CCPs end would again put everyone on the same playing field. Delayed posting to external sites would be excellent and force people to communicate and scout. This leaves the opportunity to mess up Intel reporting and have an actual fog of war, but it has to be done by ccp.
---

trhats waht we want to see .... new and / or adapted meta´s
---
Thank you for murdering a good source of spice and information on a weekend when we want as many eyeballs and media attention as possible, great way to boost those numbers.
---
yeah upon further reflection I think I am for it - possible side effect is it might encourage more people to develop their own tools
---
That doesnt sound familiar, but i honestly tuned him out quickly. He mostly just kept screaming that ccp were dumb and didnt know anything about their game while they were trying to convey new things/mechanics.
---
Are you calling me a Nazi?
---
All good points here. I opened up zkill's API to make it easier for others to be on par with the same data that zkill has.
---
And think bus factor, the community would be left with nothing while everyone scrambled to fill the vacuum.
---
Now I have a headache
---
lol null bear iv lived in lowsec since 2009 done nothing but pirate there, most pvp guys i know are 
---
A. broke
---
B. really good so dont lose ships very often unless its a big fight with srp

c.older dudes who have a good job and would rather buy plex than turbo krab

D. any combination of the above

I made my isk market trading high value goods and building caps no need to mission run for me sonny too much pve wil lrot your brain, not sure where the angst is comming from maybe you have experienced different good for you :)

Is the god taking them away a synonym that if null blocs move to whs they’ll nerf what they can there too?

---
Or not 🤷‍♂️
---
Why?
---
but wait wouldn't they ju-
---
oooh
---
*ooooooohhh*
---
How’d you know where to roam?  How’d you know you were 10 jumps from your targets and then have the audacity to get upset when they knew you were 10 jumps out?
---
There’s a reason hunters don’t roam full and dead space.  Free intel tells them exactly where to go
---
Well put, thank you. I fully agree this change need to come from CCP, in the meantime I'm trying to see what I might be able to do to help.
---
Because this sub hates everyone.  🤷‍♂️
---
What is zkillboard and how do i support it?
---
I think you're vastly underestimating the time and effort required to setup and run a killboard site of the quality like Zkill. There's not a bunch of competitor sites out there that people can just flip to, nor if people just throw up their own, are they going to easily be able to get many people to swap over posting KMs/handing out their ESI to that one to do so.
---
U/Squizz ^^^
---
I applaud you for your low effort shit post
---
anytime I have a toxic thought. I do the reverse and  make a compliment lol
---
delay null for a day
---
Do you take the time to get an additional cache or 2 per site or are you only looting the bioadaptive?
---
If I had my way.  All killmails from CCP would be delayed by a day at the minimum
---
I don’t recall doing anything but when I go into my skills it displays having omega, it apparently ends on the 26th, which makes no sense with me only starting yesterday..
---
Can't I use a Jump Freighter full of injectors?
---
Praise Squizz
---
Yeah, but who's more likely to be in system first? A roamer, who moves from system to system, or a local krab, who has his staging structure in the system?
---
Lol, well that explains a lot.  You're one of those psychos.
---
Fair enough
---
HS/LS are empire space, its plausible to think that Concord (I'm thinking esi/api wise, not just zkill) can mantain a real time intel network just like they can keep up the local chat, while in WH and now NS they can't. I wouldn't mind the delay in HS too tho.
---
this change would really fucking suck for wormhole space, zkill often a crucial tool to determining if another active group is in a chain.
---
One hour delay is something I could get behind. One downside would be the ability to check for cyno bait but then again I can always have an alt with a ship scanner.
---
What do you mean by tonight it’s 1pm in alof of the world, there’s more than 1 timezone mate
---
Maybe...but maybe i am cloaked as well
---
no  :P
---
I moved to Thera, who are these Volta guys ? They get pretty sweaty about PvP.
---
What you're suggesting is how it operates right now exactly, though as Squizz and many have come to realize, it's not a benefit seeing your killmails immediately, it's actually a massive penalty, particularly with the blackout. It gives your enemies free intel on what you're using, and where you're using it.
---
You can read the salt on reddit for that.
---
"I want something different, but I'm not willing to do it, who's going to do it for me!!11!!1"
---
I like it.  Do it
---
You can go to secure.eveonline.com to check the account management section. You should see there your current Omega status, what kind of subscription you have, and how you're setup to pay.
---
You can also check transaction history to see if there was ever anything paid on behalf of your account.
---
yea this is really good, do this regardless of how ccp handles local in the future
---
You can gift time to another player through the PLEX Vault without transferring PLEX.
---
&gt; doing this will kind of screw the little guys who don't necessarily have a bunch of tech savvy guys who can create their own alliance killboard.
---
It's not even about being tech savvy. I could knock up a basic killboard (not as nice as zkill, obviously, but functional) in a few days. But unless you're a big group, you're not going to get the APIs of enough people for that intel to really be useful, or for the kill database to provide information about neutrals.
---
Squizz actually posted about zkillboard earlier. Said that if ANY of the pilots in a killmail are API verified, then it will delay the posting by an hour, regardless if it's posted manually.
---

ALL THAT BURNS BURNS FOR THE GLORY OF BOB
---
Great idea.
---
It’s almost like they know exactly where to go, as if they have free intel in a map telling them exactly what to shoot for with wormholes instead of the vast emptiness of nullsec
---
But nah people wouldn’t support free intel, after all they wanted local gone for this reason.
---
Right?
---
If you do this. No one should have an advantage. Ccp should delay issuing kms by an hour as well.
---
Nah libs are cool.  By the way that saying you heard isn't fantastic it's lame
---
Well conceived and implemented disabling of your public resource on which countless other resources rely on without any warning beforehand, only to solicit feedback after the fact /s
---
Or you're fuck off unscannable.
---
This!!
---
so yea why to kill 90% of content :) if 10% of us using it :) dude who make great tool EVE check before you jump, died to mine camp in sys where i camp 2 months on same g8..so yea..return kb pls i refresh it 24/7 i dont read news or watch movies till im playing eve :)
---
Kind of like your fleets. It's a fucken wonder I don't play Eve anymore.
---
stop posting jay
---
Well lets be honest the actual people that co something about this is CCP.         
---
Moment zkill stops providing accurate killmails is the moment when we will have inflow of killboards that will do it.      
---
Not that it is wrong but whats the point if this happens.
---
&gt; Really its just an hour seems like a long time.
---
How are you surviving in eve when an hour seems like a long time?  OPs, roams, gatecamps can often last 4x that long, sometimes longer. An hour is a short period of time, which is why many people in this thread would prefer a 24 hour delay, myself included. 
---
Zkill killmails currently provide highly valuable live intel, its value isn't changed just because you don't use it as such, it just means your enemies are being smarter than you. 
---
Additionally, you don't have to wait at all to share your awesome kill, you can just share it ingame, with the ingame killmail. You know, like you could before.
---
To be fair, it is more subtle than most of the shitposts we usually get here.
---
It says “Paying With GameTimeCode”, I have no idea what that is
---
He's just seriously stupid, just ignore him from now on.
---
About your account, someone probably gave you time as a gift, you joined the game with a friend or something? Check the Account info on the site someone else already linked (secure.eveonline) and try to see what info you can get there.
---
I suggest doing a poll. The only response you'll reliably see here is the vocal minority. 
---
For what it's worth, I disagree with delaying killmails. It feels like tampering with the data to me. The proposed method also doesn't seem very sensible either. I think it'll probably hurt content more than it will help, except maybe for gatecampers's content (who are the main group who is really hurt by zkill's "free Intel"). 
---
Anyway, implementing such a change would only make me inclined to delete my APIs tbh. I like being able to see my killmails (and yes, lossmails) quickly, and I prefer to do it on zkill because ingame killmails suck. 
---
Ditto for battle reports. Would delay them and by the time a reliable BR could be generated, it would be kinda like "meh, so what?"
---
I don't see any downside to this, yes please. I wouldn't mind lowsec also being one hour.
---
You glorious bastard!! Have an upvote!
---
I replied to that comment, it says Paying with GameTimeCode, and I have no idea who would’ve gifted me
---
So to phrase it differently, who has access to better intel, the person who lives in and uses the space or a random person passing through?
---
Another fun fact, carriers and supers could deploy fighters from a pos tower and assign to anyone in fleet, they would follow that person around system and assist someone flying a noob ship... made for some stupid kills
---
Oh yeah I forced you out of the game I'm sure lol.
---
Actually I kind of hope that's true.  "Grrr, there's tons of other alliances in this game and tons of other FCs, but this progod dude has made me so mad I literally can't even find the leave corporation button, like how do I even leave corp?  Fuck it I'll just quit EVE".
---
hilarious.
---
Maybe they only show you the bluelist, or expands dscan for controlling entity.
---
fuck stop helping them you numbnuts Paco I'll call Tiny on u
---
Well, then enjoy it I guess?
---
Maybe you could send a ticket to CCP and ask, they surely know what happened.
---
Ingame killmails suck
---
The moral of the story is not to rely on 3rd parties you don't pay to maintain a service ))
---
Haha yeah I am, I’m just very confused right now
---
Can’t you just check local pop????
---
I lack the expertise to make something like this. By the time i have it working the event will be over. In the end my use case for it just has to suffer.
---
&gt; VNI prices will be in freefall considering the nerf. 
---
I'm so sad, I have a *ton* of FDU LP I was sitting on hoping for the prices to rise to unreasonable levels.
---
Your fit only works in a gamma though. Which if it's all you want to run is fine, but if you want to run others your fit will not work.
---
It's not a bad fit. Not trying to knock it, just that it's only good for only one type of site.
---
This guy thinks local is coming back
---
&gt; Plus it sucks cause I want to prepare for a roam later and am looking for certain targets. :P
---
This is the very exact reason that we need the delay. To drive meaningful random engagements, where there is risk and unknown, where people don't know exactly what they're going up against, where they don't know quite what counter to bring against it, unless they actually run scouts ahead to get intel. 
---
This behaviour stifles pvp combat, and it takes excitement out of the game. It's like playing battleship, when you already know where your opponent has placed all their ships. How fun is that?
---

---
You know how fun it is to enter a system and have everyone warp to station in 0.3 seconds?
---
You would still see the stream of kills, it would just be offset by an hour.
---
\&gt; Just be a dutiful public resource   
---
why? zkill has always been a private project by a private player.
---
\&gt; or people will go elsewhere.   
---
like where? :)
---
Did someone forget to tell them that local got turned off? If they want to drop in Delve so badly, all they'd need to do is fly there and park in a safe.
---
Yea, although I find it very useful considering the only mutaplasmids I see myself needing often are shield ones, if I wanted others Id just buy them.
---
There are some many good fights happening atm!!
---
I logged on, undocked straight into battle today! We won then got countered and then had to break out. A good fun night with the boys so far :) made me happy today ccp...
---
That's a valid point too. See I would know that if I was tech savvy :)
---
I am a  mainly a Krab in nullsec and I welcome this nullsec blackout with open arms. Might make my life harder for a while but I’m happy to put up with it if it means people can combat bots better now.
---
I like...!!!
---
r/woosh
---
Check your email, did you get any kind of promotion from CCP? It might be some free game time? /shrug
---
Ashterothi is the best space nerd.
---
Man I got done by one of those in RR space a while back. It's pretty brutal if you're not expecting it and you get a bit lazy
---
He could make abyssal space live probably.
---
Probably means his gaming PC. 
---
I often browse zKill  when I'm out just to see what's been going on.
---
Probably because no one’s krabbing and they’re all out having fun...
---
I love you Squizz, I always have since GOOD and FONDl!!  
---
I bet u/HazeInADaze does too!
---
Agreed, tbh. This was the path my thoughts more or less took too.
---
Also, the way i see it, right now the main group of players hurt by zkill's "free Intel" are gatecampers and similar since there are tools like eve-gatecheck and such. A zkill delay would help them the most, and I'm not sure I want that. Sure, the free Intel hurts roamers too, but I don't think that is too big of a deal.
---
I'm confused. How do you think it makes jumping out of your wormhole that much spookier, to keep it as it is, instantly updated?
---
Lore-wise, the blackout was described as 'limited' in the Scope video; so that covers permadeath.
---
Map-wise?, that's on CCP not going far enough.
---
Why should "hunters" have perfect, real-time intel and PvE players not?
---
&gt;Lowsec delayed by 30 minutes
---
&gt;Why does only null-sec get this benefit?
---
:thinking:
---
Make space dangerous again, get rid of warp to 0.
---
Do it!!
---
&gt; i would normally sand it up to 2500 grit
---
There is NO reason to sand wood to this level except for high grade cherry which can maintain an unbelievably flat surface.
---
300-400 grit is more then enough for 99.999% of finishes.
---
Ccp broken confirmed
---
Just do it!
---
Weird! I believe that means it thinks you entered a code to get your omega, like you bought a code from Steam or something like that.
---
Well enjoy your free double training and Omega access!
---
Or maybe they're trying to find an area that isn't umbrella'd to hell and back.
---
Not everyone is out to kill lame ass Providence.  If they were, the owners wouldn't exist.
---
We don't have an internal killboard at the alliance level. Our SRP software just takes the API link directly; no killboard needed. We also fine our membercorps and altcorps for providing third party killboards with an API. (Manual is fine, individuals APIs are fine but discouraged, given that popular third party killboards have their scopes set to slurp your corporate API as well as your personal, if you happen to be a fulldir, and give no choice in the matter.)
---
This is an odd article.
---
can you share some statistics? count  VexorNI/carrier/mother killed in nullsec. kill counts per region. with out kill. just a number
---
First time seeing this meme and I'm too distracted by how awesome this kid's hideout is.
---
I am currently hunting for said fleet, and i can confirm that the only ship i have seen in space was a procurer and an iteron, after like 10+ holes.
---
Did you buy any starter packs or anything? If you only have two weeks of Omega time, seems like some sort of starter pack was applied..
---
So we haven't worried about delaying Wormhole KMs this whole time, but as soon as Nullsec throws a tantrum all of a sudden we're moving mountains? 
---
Interesting
---
welcome to nullsec bromanderson dude.  I, however, don't have a cyno equipped to my Nergal, nawmsayin.
---
They used to have their own killboard several years ago.  CCP changed killmails and everyone but Zkill decided it was easier to use Zkill than do all the fiddling to make them continue to function.
---
This guy gets it.
---
I dont think you know what being aligned means.
---
Holy crap! They really had to shut the forums down lol.
---
i support this
---
Do it, I have plenty of APIs and tools to keep your killmail count at the same level as zkill's.
---
Ya, they had it set to private.
---
This would make using capitals so much more viable in smaller groups.
---
100% on your side here.
---
You're an idiot
---
Sleepers, contrary to the name, do not, in fact, sleep.  Instead they fuck you right up the ass.
---
Lots of people moving to highsec.
---
man i hope so.  I am going to return because of this.  I have always been a solo player, dipping into wormholes, lurking about in nullsec.  Hunting relic sights/data sights and looking for that pirate kind of play.  The local chats in nullsec always ruined this so hard for me.  Then I would get jumped by multi-boxers using their local chat scripts to stalk me...  
---
Has anyone else found this is true? that this enables the privateer pirate to actually be able to catch folks, and scanning in nullsec is actually a thing now?
---
Its 2019 bud. Get a fucking programable keyboard or mouse already.
---
Set button to toggle a repeated key stroke on or off.
---
Poof. Dscan always with 1 button.
---
Is it still possible to make truly unscannable ships?
---
Is that why I get bugged every time I go to the site to not use my adblocker? 
---
It's not that I don't want to support web developers, but  lot of malware on the internet spreads through "malvertising", often without the site owner knowing.
---
It was directed at Ian....I'd love to post his in Game name, but that's a little close to doxxing.
---
Even someone with the expertise is going to take a while to make a replacement from scratch.
---
Fuckers
---
Maybe it was someone random you interacted with.
---
All im saying is call it what it is. Its not perfect intel. Its not accurate intel. All it is, is intel that a pilot is in a specific system. Which is not op. It becomes op, when bots use it to evade death. Therefore blacking out local isnt curbing op local, just a round about way out sourcing a bot purge onto the players.
---
Even in Delve 80% of krabs are docked atm. I personally am shocked BB have been rolling for an hour and not finding anything.
---
It's true, we could create our own killboards. However, I suspect you're misunderstanding how killmail data is acquired. There's no central feed, from CCP, containing all killmails that occur in Eve. All killboards require individuals to submit their kills "manually." This can, of course, take the form of providing said killboard with permission to poll the CCP API on your behalf. However, this only allows the killboard in question to retrieve your kills (or those of your corporation, if you have sufficient roles in your corp in-game.) As such, any private killboard that, say, Goonswarm Federation creates would be limited to only the killmails that are posted by people who are comfortable giving away such information to GSF. Which is to say, us only. We wouldn't be able to divine any information about the rest of the game that we ourselves weren't at least partially responsible in creating in the first place. zkb is only such a useful source of intel for you because so many individuals have trusted their information to its care.
---
no idea why they'd give up a hole to TKE, we just got a 5bn isk leshak+pod there
---
Entire EVE farming like crazy check Dotlan npc kills per hour :) black will not boost kills or shutting down killboard :) only will make real attackers/defenders much much more careful that mean less engagement and less killmails :) for dude who have eyes on g8 use onboard scan, close wh, he can farm with 4 supers :)
---
No local is still retarded mehanic
---
I’ve only interacted with one of the Admin(?) people that DMs and asked if I needed help with anything
---
Delay it
---
In the short term, all things being equal, we'd likely have to be more cautious of the fights we take. We'd probably have to focus more on combat near our staging areas as we have the best Intel in/around there. 
---
I'll concede that our Intel isn't limited to zkill, but I rely on it heavily for roams. It would likely impede our roaming ability more than anything. 
---
Our focus is nearly 100% pvp and we use zkill as much for finding fights as we do for avoiding blobs. If a reasonable size gang is near we'll generally take the fight. We take our fair share of bad/outnumbered fights for funsies so long as it isn't a complete slaughter. 
---
Typically what we try to avoid is the groups that will only blob us out with vastly surpior numbers and ships, and zkill helps us with that.
---
Well, if I base it off the Zkill API, then if you delay it, my feed gets delayed too. There isn't any point writing a new tool if it doesn't go straight to ESI - at that point I might as well just use Zkill directly.
---
oh man thats nice to hear.  So the solo-privateer pirate is real again?
---
Yes, I miss my deep safes.
---
Wow, such an original and totally not salty comment!
---
/s
---
Starting it can be a signal to ccp tho. Hopefully they will understand it.
---
This will not make pvp easier. Right now it is seal clubbing. I want to jump into a system with 50 in local and 8 ships on d-scan -- people crutch so hard on local that I know my odds of getting a kill are way higher. FC's also crutch on local, now they either need good scouts or accept higher risk profiles. 
---
No local will make hunting and pvp much more dangerous, without a doubt.
---
What is the state of lowsec/FW? 
---
I’ve lived in null-sec space for about a year, but I have decided that I want to start improving my solo-small gang piloting skills and I don’t think that null sec is the best place for that, even with the blackout. I feel that every fight just turns into a blob for one or both sides.
---
So is low-sec what I’m looking for? I really just want to be able to consistently find solo fights and be able to whelp smaller ships (frigates/Dessie’s) without getting blobbed to death
---
Right.
---
But when that intel is immediate and perfectly accurate, it's bad for the game because it means people can avoid being content too easily and reliably.
---
Is that Bob striking them down?
---
None of them have ever come up with a good answer for this yet. StainGuy made a post about removing esi end points that sites like dotlan use but all the pvpers said it would be bad for them to lose their free Intel.
---
So what you're saying is that we had it in us the whole time? *_* that's so sweet
---
zkil is GNU software, anyone could put up their own fork of it and not implement some kind of arbitrary delay or turn off the site for giggles. They could use one of the other, lesser-known killboards out there. Hell, develop a wholly new one.
---
Being effectively a monopoly in the public killboard space due to the popularity of it, I would have expected squizz to be a little more thoughtful before shitting in the pool by pulling a stunt like this. Especially when so many other resources rely on his site. For example, some alliance SRP tools.
---
Or more likely they use it as a clear perk to owning sov....who knows
---
No local has reenergized the best ship, the Friend Ship
---
I tried to play Eve.  My right index finger eventually locked up while I was chasing people around the region.  
---
I feel like players who enjoy the game the way you do are a very vocal minority.   If I am right, then log on numbers will go way down over the next few weeks.
---
Just a box. 📦
---
A date which will live in infamy
---
You're very right. That's what's so funny about this. Y'all could have just done this shit for years.
---
noone stops you from making your own killboard, have at it.  
---
and for your alliance srp tool... food for though but maybe you should pull the kills directly from CCP and not from a third party website. are you really this stupid?
---
Last week on Thursday it was a holiday in the States as well...which means a lot of people weren't at work and many people then also had Friday off...meaning a lot more nerds logged in playing games when they would otherwise be stuck reading Reddit at the office.
---
I'm not in charge of the tool so don't ask me. Just putting my 0.02 ISK out there.
---
PvE players would have the same access as hunters to instant killmails.  It would actually make it harder on hunters vs a delay.  I'm saying that most roaming groups would actually much rather take this penalty to hunting in exchange for better intel on real fights.
---
Unfortunately StainGuy is right
---
Wrong, this also happened before (hunters fighting hunters), but meanwhile lots of people krabbed in relative safety and made shit tons of isk and minerals; now that's not happening today.
---
Obviously this can't last forever, and probably most people will adapt sooner on later and get back out there to do their things, but in a far more dangerous enviorment.
---
Also, stop trying to reach conclusions about the blackout effects less than 12 hours after it was implemented.
---
\*notices carriers\*
---
OwO what's this?
---
This is the sort of news that draws people to a game. The news will be "Game goes dark, nobody knows the effects yet", which is actually way more cool to an outsider - at least to me - than "Things happened in a game, people died"
---
Now, hopefully the headlines will be "Things happened, but nobody knows what" with a follow up article when we know what they were. The speed of the news being reported is not so important in terms of game visibility.
---
I mean surface level looking at it yes, but the mechanics are what created the mentality.
---
Wait a few days when there is no minerals on the market and everyone is low on isk.
---
Even if someone forked it right now and had the servers to run it you would still need people to add their esi keys to get the data.
---
Wow this is dumb
---
Yeah that sounds stupid, you should have to work for intel, not have it given to you.
---
DO IT
---
well, have my 0.02 ISK : maybe stop blaming Squizz for the incompetence of your leadership then people might be more understanding
---
A lot of “wormholes” are actually in pvp corporations and not just chance ravinne fan clubs
---
So you are mad your out of game free Intel tool isn't working but don't understand that people are upset about local disappearing?
---
Delay it, intel should not be free/easy, especially using third party tools.
---
You (or your alliance IT people) can host your own zkill instance privately.
---
u know it
---
Resubbing for winter.
---
If only the blackout extended to your posting.
---
we were hunting in kalevala, but then we ran into a pl boson gatecamp, a 100 man goon ceptor fleet and a shitton of random horde subcaps, so we decided to get the fuck out of there
---
What if what I really like about the game is pve? Fuck me?
---
No You?
---
I support the delay screw the haters squizz
---
And I'm saying that the same arguments for removing/delaying local apply here.  The only difference is the people pushing for perfect, real-time intel are on the opposite side.
---
&gt;I'm saying that most roaming groups would actually much rather take this penalty to hunting in exchange for better intel on real fights.
---
I suspect many times the people having those "real fights" would prefer not to get third-partied.
---
Which part sounds stupid? I'm honestly unsure what you are trying to say.
---
+10
---
so you found a shitload of targets... and decided to run away?
---
Understood and the end state (delayed/imperfect) is a good one in my opinion. But human nature being what it is, I don't believe this is the method to achieve it.
---
If anything hopefully CCP sees this and slaps their balls down on it too.
---
Haven't played in months, but you go right ahead and pretend I'm mad about something I'm not experiencing.
---
Yes, my alliance leadership is responsible for a public resource turning off their site for a meme.
---
Imagine if any other big website did the same. Let's just shut down youtube for a week hurdur.
---
Maybe the krabs are all docked up today, or tomorrow, or even next week, because they think local will come back soon. But hopefully it doesn't and they have to adapt - the ISK must flow. And then there will be more PVEers to hunt, as well as random fights between roaming groups.
---
All of these targets are a big nono for torp bombers
---
TEST called local primary, and it eventually died.
---
Guess that must be at least 50% people who ignore all sorts of in-game news.
---
&gt;hunting Relic sites in null sec in my tengu .... playing space pirate.  Has this improved the type of play I describe? 
---
Yup. So long as you're cloaked, people won't know you're in-system. The one downside is you're not going to know if anyone else is there either, so if the relic-hunter has backup, you might become the hunted.
---
no, they're responsible for relying too much on a privately run third party. that is absolutely moronic.
---
Its great , but dotlan is still giving intel
---
Have you looked at the production vs destruction number for eve? try a year.
---
Were you interdiction nullified?
---
Its always been the shit, but now its friggin amazing.
---
That being said, its quite amusing hiding from some bloated HD fleet in a safe and never once seeing combat probes on scan.
---
It isn’t going to be peak for another few hours. Most of America is still at work, except maybe the east coast. Peak player count is during late EUTZ, when the Americans are home but the Europeans are still awake
---
Like something I'd do to wait for UPS or FedEx so I can actually get my package.
---
Hey, sign me up. I promise I'll share it with only myself and 40,000 of my closest friends.
---
&gt;pvpers said it would be bad for them to lose their free Intel.
---
This part
---
you can't. and why should you? is he in any way obligated not to do this? the data comes from CCP, you could get it yourself.
---
Krabs are afraid of taking gates.
---
What does BB consist of?
---
Gating anomalies.  
---
Thats the dumbest thing I ever heard.
---
No point in removing local if zkillboard is just going to show you the exact size, composition and location of an enemy fleet anyway. I'd rather zkillboard not work at all, or at least have some ridiculously long delay like 1-7 days. Also, people are always complaining about killboards and how meaningless it is. Well, fine, let's get rid of it. I'm not sure what good it really does on a day-to-day basis. Month to month it's a decent analysis tool, but otherwise it's all "didn't want that anyway" bullshit.
---
I think you're wrong but time will tell.
---
Considering I almost lost a prowler in a highsec rats in an incursion system, I'm staying far away thank you very much.
---
it peaks at about 1920 or so every day.  https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
maybe not logical, but it is what it is.  also, the drop may be within the margin of error for people expected on.  the last few fridays have been around 25k or so.
---
You need at least 500 injectors in cargo so that the JF has enough brain mass to collapse the hole.
---
maybe not logical, but it is what it is.
---
People mine and rat in wh space just fine, space is big and a lot of the systems in null are mostly empty. Use d scan when mining and have standing defence fleets up, use smaller nimbler mining ships but mine in fleets. for ratting be aligned out.
---
Wait... doesn't TEST SRP rely on zkill? We got a ping about it earlier today....
---
Fly a real pvp doctrine then you risk averse coward.
---
entirely true.  probably within a normal expected range.  i'm not doing any advanced stats on it, just throwing the number out there.
---
Holy shit look at this. Pvp options and you run away. Brilliant.
---
Who says he hasn't been using all the data he gets in other ways since he created zkill?
---
But seriously, he has a love for this game and can obviously see how delaying is beneficial to its life, so I'm not worried about it.
---
We'll chalk this up as reddit complaint 1,323 in the last 24hrs from Goons. Well done, citizen!
---
Nothing new. Mar5hy has campers almost exclusively in Legacy and Imperium space now. Plus it's widely known that certain BB FCs won't attack anyone from Panfam or allied to it, excluding renters in most cases.
---
Aside from that, krabs are docked until new safety tools are found and implemented.
---
If You Build It, They Will Come (Back)? I doubt it. Some, yes, but not most. The ISK only needs to flow if you need to use it.
---
imagine shutting down your website unironically for memes
---
Can confirm.  Am currently cloaked somewhere.
---
I think you're awesome and you should do whatever you want.  You've got my support no matter what.
---
Wormholes have hole control which is not something K space can really have as much.
---
Some people are too retarded to use it.
---
Well this looks interesting
---
Not terribly intuitive though...
---
i wouldn't put it beyond them, why?
---
Delay one hour. But who cares about esi... just make it all one hour delay. Zkill should be a tool to see fight results, reference fits, and maybe gather long term Intel. Not second by second news. Posting a kill manually should be acceptable too. Not everyone is giving you the esi
---
Why should he take payment for a product he provides at no cost to a massive community, providing his time to specific individuals who are willing to pay for it? Because he can, thats why. You’re a jackass for attempting to call someone out who’s done nothing but provide a free service to the community.
---
I came to down vote, but up on reading changed my mind and then reading further changed again. But.  I give you benefit of the doubt and as an Cloaky hunter perspective I agree that Anom bounties could be tide to tag delivery as there is way to many MTU's out there floating.  But then it comes to question, should bounties to be risen or should it stay same what would reflect isk/h ratio to those who dont have secondary account for cleanup.
---
I need a ratting bhaalgorn fit.
---
Some? More like most 😂
---
wouldn't it have been funny if ccp deleted ccp so we can solve this nullsec crisis
---
\&gt; HOWEVER, this will only happen if any entity on the killmail have their personal or corporation API on zkill.   
---
Question: If nobody has their API on the killmail... wouldn't it just not get posted? Or am I missing something.  
---
I'm absolutely down for delays, though. Gonna try and spend a good bit of time this weekend playing.
---
Still a better intel thread than most big null alliance's channels.
---
Its full of dank memes there
---
Oh, your flair. I guess it was bait
---
TIL. nobody in goons knows how to tap the api
---
You're welcome to make your own killboard mate.
---
Positive. Also, thank you so much for your work.
---
yes.....but actually no
---
Not to mention we are regaining some of that good old fashion scifi mystery. non-wh, null sec local never made sense in that regard.
---
He could take your isk and say he’s gonna give you intel then not do it. Cos it’s his website, and this is eve.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I dont know if your a hisec carebear  or not, but every single person I have talked to, loves the change.  Your meme cannot be further from the truth, but hey take an upvote for providing reddit content.  I can only speak from my perspective, but my alliance has been prepping for this event ever since it was announced, and we have all been looking forward to it.  I know it fucks up you meme, but null inhabitants are enjoying this just as much as everyone else.  Long live the blackout.
---
I like to check zkill often to see how my bro doing in EVE and delay one hour just make it pain to see what's happening when they are fighting
---
You seemed to miss the subtle implication, people living in and using the space getting better intel than roamers seems fine to me because they live there. The Intel was perfect in both directions just people who lived there were better able to take advantage because the frequented the space. People who live somewhere irl know better if someone has been there as well.
---
They give out free stuff sometimes. Maybe they gifted you gametime without saying anything.
---
I am new :C
---
Not the right thread but gonna post it here anyway because it's PI related and few care.    
---
I don't know when it happened but it used to be you couldn't use launchpads unless you were undocked.  You can now manipulate launchpads if you take station control.    
---
Also, you can now establish new colonies while docked if you have a command center in your hold.
---
Ah Kk, post seemed to go in both directions so wasn't quite sure.
---
SOUND THE HOARDE HORN 📯📯📯
---
feels better :) and its much nicer on a mouse being that high
---
TBH, any sane implementation of observatories would either A) only show you people in your alliance B) show full local to everyone or C) be so hard to fuel that it drives logistics to drink.
---
mining without some kind of backup will probably always be dangerous.   
---
Ratting, it depends. People rat in WH all day long though, so I think people will find a way to rat in Null as well. What I found in playing in WH space is that you are actually fairly safe for the most part, and the extra effort on the other players part is a huge deterrant. They have to:
---
1. Learn that you exist by using D-Scan
---
2. Find you and then figure out if attacking you is dangerous or not
---
3. Decide to commit or not
---
So for most people, step 1 is already going to be a huge safety net, esp because you won't dock up when people passing through pass through.
---
Step 2 might be easy if you are ratting in an anom, but if you are in a probe sig of some kind they will often not even bother
---
Step 3 just depends on what's going on locally and who your daddy is. If they've made it that far, odds are they are willing to commit.
---
Any time homeslice! :)
---
Haha I couldn’t agree more homie! 🤙🏼 Why are Bombers Bar flying bombers? 😂😭 Doesn’t even make sense! 😱🧐
---
Technically they can scream in local
---
been living in wormholes since 2010 and this is how we've always done it
---
the ones that do are propably too smart to post stupid threads like this here.
---
This was incredible, thank you very much for writing this. I cannot upvote more than once, but I'd do it a thousand times.
---
Stainguy thinks its a bad idea, that pretty much automatically means its a great idea.
---
Do it bud.
---
I think there's space for a couple different intel paradigms.  The main difference is the type of info being shared.  Local can be used to provide continuous positional data on fleets and players at a system-level resolution.  Instant killmails on the other hand are more like radar pings that provide infrequent, irregular positional data with the added info that conflict occurred.
---
Really there are pluses and minuses for different playstyles to both local changes and the proposed zkill changes.  For instance, the local change actually nerfs some aspects of hunting in that it can make it very difficult to determine if there are any targets at all in a system while roaming.  On the other hand, it makes it much harder for a perfectly attentive player to warp to safety as soon as a hostile enters local, so this is net plus to hunting.  As I've mentioned above, the first time you kill something in a region a resourceful PvE player can use instant killmails to identify an incoming threat.  So here we have a case where delaying intel actually makes a PvE player *less* safe.
---
The trick is not to paint instant or delayed intel as broad strokes as good or bad.  Certain approaches to both have the effect of retarding or promoting different kinds of conflict in different ways.
---
To be fair, we got them out of their C4 and into our C2, rehabilitation is a long process.
---
Why wouldn't you already have those?
---
Can confirm, this is the most effective way to roll wormholes, absolutely do this
---
Maybe you’ll catch something with your 3 hunter alts for once
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GODS
---
He have the point. Zkill is not a CCP tool but a player made.        
---
Like this is a valid concern, maybe it is time for CCP based killboard?               
---
From my perspective today i seen people who normally just mine go and camp a gate ...... like i love it.             
---
My fears so far was that CCP will kill the game, but so far it looks good enough - for sure i can live with that online numbers.            
---
Why people undock ? Not because of the blackout - **but because no one knows that there is a gatecamp** and people roam in normal ships and not move just in nullified shit.
---
Why am I mad or upset? I don't really mind we have the manpower to scout. Why are you jumping the train that it somehow effects me?
---
Squizz has a great track record of refusing bribes. It's not something I'm particularly worried about anyway.
---
There is only one elo, this is blasphemy
---
I have TEST on ignore so not sure what you're talking about
---
Of all people to complain. You’re in goons dude. Probably the group most capable of producing in-house tools for things like this. 
---
You’ll be fine.
---
Shhhh.. Their fragile egos can't handle the truth, they might quit the game again.
---
With a finish on it, you'll never notice the difference between a 400 grit sand, and a 2500 grit sand.
---
If you want something that smooth, you should put down a finish like shellac or a few coats of poly, and then sand it with 2500.
---
You have 40,000 people and like a 1000 titans, why do you care? 
---
Make your own Killboard if it bothers you.
---
It's still a good point that should be considered.
---
Don't hesitate with your ideas because a bunch of salty nerds in this echo box think they have an opinion. Do with it was you will, its your website.
---
What is your ingame tag, I want to follow your zkillboard and bask in your imaginary glory.
---
go cry somewhere else
---
And then later when they stopped allowing making deep safes,
---
fuck off retard
---
lol and you audit his contract and wallet logs regularly, right?
---
I was just testing you....(&lt;----^(never goes pvping or intel hunting))
---
&gt;Bombers Bar, or Pandemic Legion, or Snuffed Out
---
As if they'd be the ones offering the largest bribe.
---
[Incursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blpNXY_z9DE&amp;t=60) and [World Ark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFyrMjz_jBI&amp;t=1280)
---
So while not on the scale of EvE PvP which I find wholesale uninteresting it is still larger scale battles than I've seen in any other game.
---
I realize this is unclear but I'm too lazy to fix it above. The suggestion is not to gate anomalies but rather to move away from anomalies as the primary PVE earner of nullsec towards larger, rarer, and more challenging PVE content requiring fleets e.g. incursions and putting THOSE behind ONE gate with the explicit purpose of keeping caps out of the sites intended for subcaps while the most rewarding would be accessible to and designed to be run in capital ships.
---
Don't be stupid, he's not obligated in any way to do or not do shit. If he feels like selling that info (not that I think would) he totally can.
---
If you don't like it do your own killboard, the endpoints needed are right there, not like CCP gabe him exclusive access to anything.
---
It’s really a point that applies to all player-made tools. If someone forgot to remember that for zkill, well that’s on them.
---
You want safe PVE? Sorry mate, no guaranteed safety in null sec
---
everyone can make their own killboard and pull the data from CCP. zkill is something a guy privately invested a ton of his free time, he has no obligation towards any of us. if anything this goes to show that we rely far too much on other peoples work.  
---
calling a person out that did a ton of work for us like that is an absolute bitchmove.
---
I definitely understand adding in a delay. I think it adds a lot of 'flavor' to the game. The fact that external sources are also blacking out is pretty unique and adds to the immersion I think.
---
The only way to rehabilitate c4 degenerates is with a direct dose of in game 9mm bullet to the head ( in game)
---
Do you not?
---
But you don't need a secondary account to just warp back and scoop tags from an MTU.
---
Am I being flairbaited or did I just read an unironic goonpost urging caution against monopolies.
---
Ok, I laughed
---
It's r/eve, finding a smart person, not to mention a OP is probably the rarest thing ever
---
I would agree they however need to eliminate all intel that is not generated by players, meaning ESI endpoints on Dotlan and all intel on the in game map.  Then it is truly dangers for hunters and hunted alike.
---
Make your own killboard site then OP
---
Go to high sec plenty of pve there
---
Thereby making their voice louder than the majorities.
---
I know this is a joke, but...
---
There is local in abyssal space, but it doesn't work. At least it didn't when I tested out while multiboxing in frigates.
---
No need for me to put cloaky eyes up on a gates to +1 or whatever in this region, until today ofc.
---
No the KBs are on blackout
---
Yep.
---
Bahaha! Tell em’ like what the hell do you expect in Null sec &amp; low sec? If you wanna PVE, CCP handed HS to the care bears. Jesus man
---
agreed, ingame killmails hella suck.
---
God, yes. Delay it. Delay it for as long as you can. I wish it'd be delayed for a day or more.
---
I know it's great =D Excitement
---
I saw his fit, I was also under the impression that ewar doesn't work on rats. Guess that's where I went wrong?
---
If it comes from ccp and no one can provide instant kullmails you'd be completely in the clear.  Otherwise, probably a proliferation of lesser killboards.
---
I just laughed so hard in the DMV i farted.
---
Lol. When two rival cloakies uncloak and hunt that vni together in brotherhood
---
I don't expect complete security, I do expect some level of counter play to some asshole with a cloaked ship tackling you and dropping a whole fleet of other ships ontop of you. And there is none anymore, people can just sneak into your system in the off hours and log off so you don't even get the chance to see them coming through the gate.
---
Then do it carefully
---
I wonder if you can elaborate on this.  I'm very new to Eve, so I don't even know what a plex is (I thought it was subscription replacement).  How can I join FW and be self-sustaining if I'm losing frigates consistently?
---
RREEEeeeEEEEEEEeeeee 
---
No one believes you
---
Still you don’t respond to all the people that are telling you that you can always pull the data from CCP just like zkill does, if you’re not satisfied.
---
I have very little interest in trying to engage with it. What it's effectively done is made it impossible to go out and mine in a rorq or rat in anything smaller than a super or larger than a VNI unless you are sitting in umbrella space. It's made the cloaky camper situation even worse.
---
I think you should run it delayed for the duration of the blackout as a test.
---
You have to remember, this is the same group of people that cried about certain aspects of the MER giving away too much intel.
---
For as massive and overpowering as they are, they'll complain about pretty much anything that they think gives away intel.
---
Please do. I'd like to see it.
---
Wut?
---
Do it
---
Wall street bait
---
Webs are very popular in the abyss and invasions. Dual web is standard on abyss sacrilege. :)
---
But then you don't get content, and who wants that?
---
&gt;...hunters are hunting hunters
---
hunter1: uncloak!
---
hunter2 : no u!
---
Whining is easier.
---
There is no point because as other have stated anyone can make their own site that mimics a killboard, thus nuliffing any bribes that squizz gets.
---
Why? The whole reason the community did this was to have a real blackout. That’s why /r/eve is down or zkill etc.
---
Leave the blackout alone and let’s see what happens
---
&gt; An hour is a short period of time, which is why many people in this thread would prefer a 24 hour delay, myself included.
---
It really depends on how you look at it, I think you could make a good argument for either.
---
Do you roam with a clocky tengu? You must love risk.
---
Oooh, I’d be down for different levels of zkill! I’d pay like a bil a month for no delay in kills. Standard/unpaid version is 1hour delay for everything
---
:) could have bought out the 12500 grit:P
---
i usually feel a difference between them, but im probably not using the 400 long enough. i tend to use a grit till it feels smooth running the grit over, then move to the next grit, and repeat.
---
works great on a pan thats sticking
---
Unironically do this during big timers. There's still sperg in local but holy shit it helps a lot
---
And this is CCP's fault because?
---
Yeah because brawling 200+ subcaps in cloaky bombers is the best idea ever
---
&gt;we’ll be monitoring what effect this has on the cluster
---
If the login number drop a lot they take that as an indication to turn it back on ;)
---
Are we supposed to be sated with our lot? The concept of "enough" is for losers.
---
Shhhhh........ delete this thread and just keep it sekret.

This, dear viewers, is a good example of why UI and UX are not the same thing.
---
No, they’re sleepers who fuck.
---
You don't understand how the killmail API works.
---
This projection is better than beam lasers’.
---
That's because, unlike you, he has a basic understanding of how the killmail API works.
---
Gonna have to fight ships that shoot back. Everyone is out hunting
---
&gt;Haven't played in months  
---
&gt;I can see things on the map
---
You're lying about *something* here. What it is, I'm not entirely sure on yet.
---
Doing a bunch of work isn't a periapt guaranteeing goodwill. I've done a ton of work for GSF, but I don't expect any of the subhumans around here to give a shit either way.
---
DO IT!
---
&gt;rregular positional data with the added info that conflict occurred
---
It's only "occurred" if it's delayed.  If it's not delayed, it's "is occurring" unless we're going to pretend every kill is 1v1.
---
Fact is, a giant block of text doesn't change what you already said:  You want this so that you do not have to scout.  Your targets, OTOH, should have to scout.
---
High sec pve is trash. Null pve was never safe

slow and kinda inaccurate but i do dig the graphics... but man its slow

Someone roll a JF filled to the brim with 300 skill injectors onto this guys lap, he definetly needs the brainpower

Godspeed brainpower freighters, this man needs your help

Believe it or not, it's possible to click on "map" while updating a skill queue.  You wanna call that "playing"?
---
You are correct I do not know how it works for EvE online but if one guy can do it whats is stopping anyone else? Unless he was given special access to a API.
---
Lol what?
---
Wasn't even funny?
---
Not flairbait, OP is director of GSOL in goons.
---
Praise be to Bob.
---

---
The sleepers are his children. The drifters are the arbiters of his will.
---
How, exactly? The killmail API doesn't let you walk over every killmail created, regardless of who it involves or without the consent of at least one involved party. You have to convince other people to give you the killmails.
---
is it possible to have KMs from large battles exempt from the delay?
---
theres a difference between "not giving a shit" and "shitting on someone's work because theres a possibility that you dont like how it's done but profit from it regardless"
---
Yes.
---
Best thing I've read all day!
---
&gt; Obviously this can't last forever, and probably most people will adapt sooner on later and get back out there to do their things, but in a far more dangerous enviorment.
---
This.
---
We have to allow some time for the ratting withdrawal to kick in. Sooner or later the krabs will come back to rat/mine because it's the only thing that keeps the ants away.
---
So we should just delete zkill
---
Sounds like DED sites, we have that. The main reliable payout is an ope that you sell in lowsec to npcs
---
Consent. Killmails require at least one person in the set (last blow, victim) to consent to giving you information about any given kill. You can't just trawl the corpus of killmails from Eve's server. At least, not without brute forcing the hash associated with the killmail, which is impractical, given CCP's aggressive error rate limiting. (Not to mention, sound cause for them to push your shit in for abuse.)
---
Haha
---
You should try undocking.  
---
4 amazing small gang fights against other hunter groups today.  Won 3, lost 1.  No cap escalations.  
---
Wormholer, btw.
---
They could try *roaming* a region?
---
That's not a thing. :)
---
No one knows, dude. No local. Pretty sure can assume no though.
---
i love how goon posters are more cringe than irony goon posters
---
Wormholer btw, who do you fly with? I just lost a skirm to hull pen 😂
---
Yes, LS is exactly what you are looking for, better chances of finding solo / small gangs pilots than anywhere else, with plex mechanics helping to get somewhat "even" fights. 
---
On the other hand, there's not as much people as in other parts of space and you'll find a lot of empty frigs just doing defensive plexes and not fighting at all, and it might take you some time to actually find fights; sometimes you just undock and start shooting, others you can spend hours roaming only to see potential targets warp off. But this happens everywhere else I think.
---
Please do this. But also make LS delay 1 hour as well.
---
Also +1 for CCP to delay the issuing of ingame Killmails notices by 1 Hour.
---
So what if he does?
---
PIZZA BACK ON THE MENU????
---
then how about you make a start? you have access to the biggest pool in the game. and frankly also the best infrastructure i experienced so far (out of the game aswell). i bet you could get your own killboard up and running in no time.
---
You sir may you go to the top
---
We profit from zkb? How so?
---
generally the way things work is that if you suspect something bad happening you seek evidence, not ask for proof of lack of said bad thing
---
WHole-some
---
Cant you just call or message them and ask how the fight went?
---
Thats why i said to put a delay of 30m to 1h... 1h old information is pretty much useless.
---
The scope vid clearly said reduced bandwidth not turned off, think of Apollo 13. You can have air or heat local would be heat.
---
Damn
---
Can anyone explain it for the dumb people (not me tho i totally got it).
---
if you now pretend that goons don't use it in the exact same way that everyone else in eve does im gonna call you the biggest fattest liar on this whole damn sub.
---
&gt;i usually feel a difference between them, but im probably not using the 400 long enough.
---
Is this before or after finish?
---
Make a start in what, obtaining the consent of the entire game? The tech involved isn't the problem; hell, zkb is [open sores software](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard); we don't have to build that part of it at all.
---
What about on monday the killboard comes back on with a 3-4 hour permanent delay...
---
exactly
---
Damn it you made me check my account and she's still alpha!
---
That was a funny coincidence, I'm sorry you didn't it :)

---
squizz somehow figured it out too, and hes just one man.
---
Ooookay? Why did you post this in response to what I said?
---
IDEA: Allow anybody on the killmail to see it immediately, but delay it from the public. At least then people won't be too incentivized to build their own killboard if they want to get a little more intel on a fight they just participated in.
---
If it's too much work for you to implement authenticated visibility of killmails, you could still keep it off the homepage so that people would at least need a direct link in order to view.
---
NERD CCP did it better
---
I dont really understand the crusade the gsf directorate is leading against zkb, to be honest.
---
yall motherfuckers always tryin' to over-compensate
---
I love the support of the blackout, but I don’t think the delay really matters. I use zkill to see who lives in a place, how active they are, and what they fly. Seeing that they’re around right now is easier done by just jumping in... the only place where I think a delay would matter is for gate camps or high sec gank systems...and even then, it’s not that big of a deal. IMO apply your lovely talents elsewhere.
---
True. Fundamentally what I'm asking for is a rebalancing that makes dynamic/group content like DED sites more rewarding for players than solo running anoms. Rewarding enough or common enough that players start running them instead of soloing anomalies.
---
I am only stating that only CCP tool can guarantee us some things.
---
&gt; How can he be trusted to not make private killboards for Bombers Bar, or Pandemic Legion, or Snuffed Out...
---
He didn't create a new facebook.  If someone wanted to build an app that did this they could whip it up in a few days.
---
He didn't so much "figure it out" as much as he was the only game in town. I guess we can go back in time and rewrite history. BRB.
---
Maybe give him constructive feedback...
---
\&gt;why would you post something related to the thread you're posting in
---
Praise Bob \o/
---
I didn’t see before I posted, but Squizz actually made a thread and suggested similar thing, but better because he knows what the duck he’s talking about. Here’s hoping!
---
I hope this blackout is a permanent change. But if they do decide to bring local back, I hope they don't bring it back all the way. Something like an anonymous local that doesn't display names or standings would still be better than a normal local (not as good as a full-on blackout though).
---
I didn’t see before I posted, but Squizz actually made a thread and suggested similar thing, but better because he knows what the fuck he’s talking about. Here’s hoping!
---

---
Get owned by "The Sidekick" with equal numbers.
---
Try to get people to form under you from now on.
---
Curious whats stoping you from searching fits? Certainly an hour delay isnt going to make or break tour research.
---
Given the change in local, I'd like to believe that CCP has big enough balls, lets just hope that they did not use all of that surface area on the local changes
---
it look 100% better then zkb
---
It’s been a steady stream of content all day - a surprising lack of vni’s and frat space has been very quiet ...
---
&gt; Suck that this also has to affect Zkill for the lulz.
---
It's not for the lulz. It's valuable intel.
---
Woah man with that rational thought ima have to stop you right fucking there.  Take that shit out lay here
---
Generally, you post in response to the statement you're replying to, not the OP. I ain't the OP. Go fish somewhere else.
---
Maybe its time to make a group called "pvp bar" then if bombers aren't made for it.
---
More tools are always good. Disatisification with tools led to the development of Pirates Little Helper for instance.
---
Dread works better. Jump once, siege green, then jump back and the added siege mass rolls it in one pass.
---
you forgot mass limitations, average null fleets are &gt;40, while wormhole fleets even in Highclass are usually less then 40 characters, which are usually multiboxed and more brawl oriented aswell
---
We're cool with discarding it, if that's what you're getting at. Feel free to block goons at the firewall.
---
Fun fact: "tuz" is turkish for salt
---
Your point is moot.  Just about every eve app requires an api and permission from the person, so literally any DIY killboard would require it as well.
---
Reship like the rest of the universe. There's more content out there than ever and you chose bombers out of all the possible ships to fleet up in. 
---
Ironically there's more content than ever because people are all looking for krabs to kill and only find other krab hunters.
---
I get and agree with that position but to avoid that issue I FW alts.
---
You obly need an alt with high securities connections and some other social skills to do them. Your DPS dealer doesnt need to be in FW at all but it will damage your standing.
---
I use a seperate dps alt with a VNI. I say do.. i havent done it in a while but you'll make a few 100m an hour doing it. It used to be a lot more. Before we could make 700m+ an hour but those days are long gone.
---
It’s really nice outside today you guys.  Really nice
---
make a better page and i'm sure people will gladly come to you. and before you ask how you're supposed to make it better: thats on you, you're the ones complaining.
---
Lmao most hunters these days are even more risk adverse than that, they have no interest in staying on grid with anything that has a gun lol. We have had a few cruise through our space who won't even take a 1v1 fight, they are just looking for mining barges and exhumers to inflate their killboard
---
There is this thing know as high-sec. I hear you can pve all you want there
---
I applaud this. Now, for the important question... did traffic go up or down because of this?
---
I just realized your name is coded for roast beef
---
Too hot, not going to undock today.
---
bbut what about the  blackout? whale hunting... pvpocalypse... you're a shark. be a shark
---
Can confirm, make sure you activate bastion on the J-Space side to Max out your mass an roll faster
---
i mean, you're talking about goodwill in the case of the OP levying accusations against squizz, and my counterpoint to you talking about good will is that goodwill is unnecessary since said accusations lack evidence
---
but then again, i should've known that needed to be spelled out for you since you are querns
---
Not if you pod them quick enough.
---
so you want it gone in general? why complain about squizz and not CCP then?
---
Take the stick out of your ass, you uncreative shill.
---
I think squizz should start it to show CCP the way, and the delay should be three hours.
---
Have you seen the Imicus redesign lately?
---
Everyone's ducking the wave until their ADM's start to falter.
---
No, I wasn't talking about the goodwill that the zkb dude has accumulated. I was speaking in generic terms. Please increase your reading comprehension.
---
Pretty sure I saw bots in LS last night...
---
I miss that show.
---
t. goon
---
No, that's exactly my point. The dude I was replying to was laboring under the false impression that the data was just out there for anyone to take and that software was the only barrier. He didn't do anything wrong; it's a technical detail that isn't immediately apparent.

The only feedback I have to give is to leave it alone, let CCP have their little event.
---
&gt;I am not against the world having more danger in it, or uncertainty, but it'll be trivial for a large group to make a killboard, force ceos to apply their corp API, and thus have instant defensive Intel when people come knocking.
---
That's not really much different than announcing intel via comm channels. Internal killboards are perfectly acceptable intel, imo. The only people hooked up to them will be your internal membership, so it won't give you any information about the rest of the universe.
---

Right, I just like the playing field to be equal. I'd be happy if ccp did the change.
---
Yes low sec is probably what you want. Also being a highsec merc. Low sec you get better partners though, and more interesting fights.
---
Pirate groups can be good too as long as they just don’t gate camp and actually do 2v2 or 3v3 etc

I remember bitching on coms about Corp mates fucking up the copy and instead dragging them into their cargo. I also was that guy that pulled the 3rd hole exit route bm and fucked over everyone. Good times.

Still doesn't change the fact that it isn't as simple as you make it out to be. You thought the data was just there to be taken without any work whatsoever.

---
See that would have prob gone over better then calling it fucking stupid, calling the event a dumbass and then saying shutup and do your job. It's all about how you say things to someone that put alot of time into something, that alot of people use on a daily occurrence.
---
mild shock dot gif
---
No shit.  It's what we've been saying before Local went out: the Supercapital people aren't going to care.  It's good for Wormholers since they know how to hit fast and get out, but the people who are looking for "roams" in Delve or really anywhere else that's heavily populated aren't going to have fun.

---
I say you should have to actually go look at the damn wreck. Killing somebody then warping off in your broken boat to hide while you check zkill to see if it's worth going back is lame.
---
Keep the delay!
---
Fortunately, there's 3 other regions ingame to choose from - High-Sec, Low-Sec, and J-space, all with their own mix of PVE, as well as the new Abyssal space, which offers you the ability to enjoy instanced PVE where you can be as anti-social as you want

it's still CCP that provides an endpoint for killmails (or literally anything). i mean it's pretty well known that goons seem to have a problem with other people doing literally anything. the reality here seems to be that you're mad at squizz because you can't control him. (or other players giving him access to their killmails for that matter). but youre forgetting theyre using a ressource CCP provides.

Yeah but that forces people to communicate to pass the information, which is a good thing in an MMO.
---
If solo guy who doesn't ever participate and just rats dies to a roaming gang, we'll, that's on him, he should be using his teammates to help him. This would be better, I reckon, for the long term health of the game since it'll force people to play, talk and coordinate.
---
Pulling it from esi automatically and instantly circumvent all that. I want people to be involved, because that keeps them around.
---
Idiot guy who doesn't want to do that won't change regardless of how the killboards change around him. For everyone else, this should push them to more activity, even if only in the communication piece.
---
Secondly, people are fallible, which means they have to get better at reporting (a skill to learn) and gives opportunities for confusion and the fog of war to work in a roaming Gangs favor. It's a win-win of skill and capability determining how well you do vs a auto generated perfect piece of Intel.

no, i legitametely just didnt take the change to ESI in consideration. before that taken all collections people had together im pretty sure goons were in possession of all API's in eve that were ever given away to someone.
---
Twitch prime account? That has 14 days of omega i think
---
im not sure whats worse, panfam circle jerk threads or goon circle jerk threads
---
Is that really the argument you want to use? By that logic, you shouldn't be mad at the fact that we suck tons of crok with rorquals; it's just a resource that CCP provides, and are mad because you can't control it.
---
Yea in love the idea, but isn't skill all on github? All the big alliances would have a big incentive to just clone and deploy their own version without the delay... It hurts the small gangs who roam in null much more than the big guys...
---
Tracking Vigilant Tyrannos kills on skill was SUPER useful during the attacks.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sN6\_tetmdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sN6_tetmdI) sometimes we don't even bother with the cloaks.
---
Yeah, we totally abuse killmails. We camp a major null pipe intersection with convenient jump bridges nearby. As soon as they hit intel, step 1 is always go to Kill. Does he fly alone, what kind of ship, what's his typical fit, cyno deaths, does he suicide roam or is he slippery, how is his T3C usually fit, etc. 
---
Based on all that, we know whether worth chasing into a pocket or wait where we are or gtfo. An hour delay will keep us from learning most of that, but the majority of the info is still there.
---
Recruiting btw.
---
This is pretty cool. Exciting time to be a new player in nullsec.
---
I think that's what people are hoping, if they don't log in very much then CCP will reverse this. Don't worry though, this was already considered before it was even done. I think you're going to have to stay logged out for a lot longer than you anticipated
---
Yesterday i propose that a lot of people in this subreddit just insult me.
---
OF course i agree. But 1 hour is not enought. Delaying 12 hours is better (beacause big fight could make more of 1 hour). 12 hour make the roam could be over, all could be finish and you learn it just after.
---
uhm yes, i think it's on CCP that they provide the possibilities for that (delete excavators btw).  
---
the reason i dont like goons is a completely different one.

Well bombers bar is called bombers bar for a reason.
---
I actually knew that. Back in the late 90s I kept having Turkish dudes PM me on mIRC thinking I was Turkish. Took me a bit to figure out Tuz was Salt.
---
Yeah, that's fair. The new system is a lot more resistant to theft of API credentials, given that each set of credentials is only valid if you also contain the requester's secret key as well. Not to mention that old API keys were slowly accumulated over the course of a decade, and the ESI transition occurred only a short time ago, relatively speaking.
---
anytime i have a toxic thought i type in match chat in all caps
---
Or heat could be "npc kills" and the other statistics that are still coming through....
---
Highsec PVE and Null PVE are the same thing. You shoot at npcs and get isk or shoot at rocks and get ore. The only difference is the amount of money you get from it.
---
it's almost as if i had predicted, and been downvoted, for prophecising exactly this all fucking week.
---
hi, i'm captain obvious and i'll be here for the duration of the blackout.

We're happy to work a problem from multiple angles, basically. Costs nothing to try, at any rate. It's not like we're held in high esteem around these parts in the first place.
---
Terribly sorry that "no local" made all the bad players and turbokrabs dock up and quit. Only ones left are those who have a clue. Come back when you have one.

---
Dunno what you're talking about. We've been doing our best to rescue Krabs in Kalevala all day.
---
I don't necessarily disagree with you, and I wouldn't be mad if CCP made that change.
---
However, in lieu of CCP doing it server-side, I do think Squizz's idea is fantastic and would not be in support of any new public killboards who don't implement a delayed feed.
---
Gives you basically infinite time to find ships to kill.
---
If local updates instantly, you have about 4-5 seconds before the system (and sometimes the region) is a ghost town.
---
With delayed local, you have WAY more time to find people and pin-point what you want to kill.
---
He's talking about providing a no-delay view on his existing data set, while leaving unprivileged parties out in the cold. He's not talking about the tech itself; that part is [open sores.](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard)
---
I'm not sold on delayed killmails.
---
If I lose a ship, I can just take a fast screenshot of overview or copy the combat log, and send this intel to fleetmates. 
---
If I kill a ship, I can either want to do it stealthy (delay would help here... except the target can just share most info himself, see above) or brag about it (delay would hurt me here; I'd just post screenshots instead).
---
The only real difference that the kill won't become completely public for an hour.
---
To me this feels like a QoL degradation without a significant benefit (people will find a way around it). Am I missing some aspect of this?
---
As someone whose main specialization for the last ten years has been scouting and finding content for my particular group, I had a good laugh over that one.
---
I do actually agree with what you're getting at though.  For too long the amount of work that small groups have to do vs the amount of content we get has been sliding in the "not worth it direction".  I want the amount of effort it takes to find fights to go down, and the number of fights we find with that effort to go up.  If I spend fifty percent of the effort and find one hundred percent more fights, that'll bring us back to about where we were at when Eve was at its most popular in 2009-2014.
---
Bombers bar is called bombers bar for a reason. Also we are an npsi group, not everyone can fly lokis.

Yeah, that would be more useful. Most roams last less than 3 hours, so if small gangs or wormholers are getting kills before they get to your space, you can't just pull up zkill and see their fleet comp.
---
Absolutely nothing... So what of it if he does...
---
Make your own damned killboard if you're paranoid that will happen...
---
I am totally listening to this later in my shift, I haven't heard anything really lore involved in ages, but then again I live under a rock.
---
If anyone knows where I could find some cannon lore knowledge about how alts work, or if alt characters (on the same account OR on different accounts) are connected in any way I'd love to read it.  I've been thinking about it a lot, for some dumb reason.
---
Can you keep the abyssal killboard up/not delayed? Lot of people use it to see if proving conduits are happening and if they will decide to go in.
---
&gt;I understand that you have a certain quota to meet, after all.
---
hmmmmm
---
They're both the same lmao only difference is names
---
No, can you post a link?
---
IMO the removal of local as no effect and was not aimed at fucking up super umbrellas
---
Ain't no quotas on my train, baby. "Enough" isn't in my vocabulary.
---
If enough people tackle shit in delve at the same time, won't they get jump fatigue?
---
How is that different from Recon Ships then? Hell the Gallente Recon ships have range bonuses to warp disruption and scramble.
---
And the interceptors at best have a total of a 25% range bonus, isn't that kind moot with their high speed at that bonus?
---
Goons still OP need more nerfs
---
Compared to a tackle ceptor, Recon ships take years to warp.
---
Ngl even if you pretend to be retarded you're still actually retarded so...
---
So you are saying I should log in to finish local off now?
---
I've been getting tons of kills in delve what are you talking about?
---
If you're playing on steam there was a promotion where they gave away one of the starter packs that came with some game time so if you redeemed the code that would be where the time came from.
---
\&gt;:)
---
Oh? Enlighten me, O Arbiter Of Internet Standards.
---
Nerd
---
Bingo
---
We'd often just give up on it: scout in groups of three. Cloaky loki and two cov-ops. Cov-ops would hopscotch the fleet through the chain while the cloaky loki sat on the new friends ready to keep them around if they tried to leave. 
---
Even if the loki got decloaked, most people back then did not have a pve ready to pvp mindset so it would take them a while before they'd think to try and kill it instead of running away.

THIS IS A PVP GAME DAMNIT! CCP?! WHY FOR YOU TO PUSH PPL INTO WHAT THIS GAME ISNT?! 
---
Idea: Give people options to apply to active on killboard FW corps upon finish tutorial?
---
No shit it's an experiment.
---
And then it would leak.  And people would boycott and revoke permissions.  The paranoia and lack of foresight is strong in OP.
---
This was said almost daily leading up to the event, removing local does not stop us from having a standing fleet or using it.
---
rude
---
FW is rather dead lately. Especially since the group I'm in, Amarr, has been winning. REALLY hard to find a fight.
---
A: Yes. If any char or corp on the killmail is API verified and the kill is in nullsec then you'll have to wait until the killmail is an hour old.
---
Overall I think everything you propose is good except this. Being able to share a km via a zkill link of a kill you just made is a good social part of the game. Zkill is just better then the ingame or a screenshot.
---
It would be more work, but what if the just posted kill was available only as a direct link for the first hour, then only after that time the kill shows up on player/corp/alliance/recent boards.
---
that said i am still convinced that if anything youre the group that would have the highest chance of building up a competition in a reasonable amount of time just based of the sheer amount of people you directly or indirectly have influence on. and for killboards to go away in total to prevent the possibility of possible biased intel there would need something to happen on CCP's side.  
---
maybe we should all step back for a second and just be thankfull that over the past years someone has prevented a killboard competition shitshow by publicly providing one for everyone equally. imo this is much better than several ones controlled by different entities.
---
Yea. I agree that this is not a great thing, but how much is delayed zkill going to change that exact scenario?
---
Now you are still able to see what he is usually flying or if he is usually flying alone, so you will still be looking at zkill every time you see someone.
---
cant go tits up
---
Only if it was a Cyno I would believe you.
---
Eve is alive again. GJ CCP
---
delay them! fully support this.
---
Yet people fly blops, trucks, hunter t3s, recons?
---
🤔 really makes you think 🤔
---
Don’t complain about safety is my point. Want safety stay in high sec.
---
People talk about the little guys taking sov all the time. Dotlan and the ingame map keep small groups from sneaking into null and setting up in a system or constellation because cynos, pilots in space, jumps, npc kills and all that stuff is tracked in dead as shit space and made easily accessible. If that information wasn't there, small groups could go set up in space that no one ever goes and avoid getting instantly stomped by other null groups or BB or anyone else that would go farm and evict them.
---
Scouts on the gate and wormholes with probes out to notice any new wormhole.
---
Why do goonposters intend on making theirselves look retarded it gets really hard to tell if you guys are flairbait or actual members
---
Whether you want to PVE in null, low or hi-sec, the moment you undock you consent to PVP.  My best recommandation is to switch to another MMO my friend
---
no shit
---
Yeah, most fun in a long time.
---
It's going to settle down after a few days, but the feeling of harshness is back. This is EVE.
---
How would an hour delay change any of that info?
---
no shit, that is why I posted the way I did, to go AGAINST the joke. The jokes on you buddy =)
---
 We CaN gEt FrEe KiLlS iN dElVe BeCaUsE nO lOcAl GuYs
---
You know what’s hilarious? The edgelords don’t even get the joke.
---
I'm hunting big game so I wanted to see where big game was getting dropped in the last few days. Zkill doesn't really help find immediate targets except in certain circumstances.
---
You seriously expected something else?
---
I just want to let you know the joke was understood and posted with an antithesis to the OP but I guess that was lost by people who automatically think they know how people post.
---
Keep it black!!!!

---
How do you sell all your loot?  I'm a few weeks into this game, and I can't use my Personal Assets tab for crap because I have so much stuff spread out all over... I decided to try to liquidate about 400 items, but selecting all and just selling them is a nightmare... Plus, I wouldn't hate to get a good price for some things.
---
I'm tempted to just take everything to Jita and dump it there, is that what most people would end up doing? And just take whatever price I get?
---
haha good one
---
You could get all your alliances to give you API access and create a bot which feeds all your losses to a Jabber channel in a day or so. Why would you pay Squizz for that?
---
Ya that is not me. I am a pvp pilot but I need to pay the bills.
---
Sure thing buddy... Sure thing. [https://i.imgur.com/vQiA4Ms.png](https://i.imgur.com/vQiA4Ms.png)
---
Unironically.
---
Thank you for assuming why I posted as I did. While words can't really portray what I'm feeling, please don't assume you know why someone posted without at least asking why.
---
4 hours roaming ... Shit out there. This is crap.
---
Better intel? Maybe. As good as local? No.
---
 i see what you did here
---
is a checkbox that hard to program to mute that autistic sound
---
Where do you live/play? I play in provi if your not in a empire boarder section your the carbear. Ratting in provi is already really risky. Your Corp should just learn to not ruin the game
---
Marketing, right? Can't exactly call it "come watch us spawn a hole to nullsec for several hours".
---
It was an antithesis to the joke, but words don't really express emotions well unless you explicitly write it out.
---
You do unless you pay for all your accounts with real money. And, on an alliance level, you do if any people are undocking and you have an SRP programme.
---
So, umm, they basically sleep *with you*?
---
Amarr is winning? How the hell did that happen? I was in Amarr as well.
---
Sounds more entertaining than that bee guy from eve online on twitch.
---
Up to you, thanks for assuming my emotional state.
---
My experience was different. I roamed for a bit in Scalding Pass, taking gate after gate through the eastern side of it until I stumbled upon PL’s new home and I didn’t find a soul. No. One. There was no one, neither in local (obviously), neither in dscan. Sometimes I found one or other frigate, but I didn’t find a bubble, no ambushes, no big ships.
---
I only managed to dscan some VNIs out and mining ships near the populated areas.
---
It'll cause the WHs to collapse (close) trapping the carriers in and leaving them easy prey for WHers.
---
How did you get there from what they said? Less important =/= get rid of
---
Lol such a dumb comment. You prob live under a capital umbrella and have never actually played pvp
---
Like an archon.
---
You really like PvE but say you are a PvP pilot but also dislike when people try to PvP you?
---
Guess he was expecting to get a dozen super kills by now.
---
Ok then how can zkill be an essential part of the game?
---
Are you implying that only the web service would be delayed and the API would be open without delay, or are you now going to force the eventual competition that you are promoting to also have the 1h delay?
---
For example I think our SRP app uses the zkill API and such it is broken now afaik. Putting the API on a similar limit will also force all the people to submit their srp requests an hour after they have died and *potentially* left fleet/ shut down their pcs.
---
link us your killboard, oh wait  :)
---
Trying to out blob goons? Genius!
---
had the exact same experience.  Basically how i found this thread.
---
They are using big amps tho.
---
been roaming in delve a few hours ago, was fun. also goons are much slower today than usual
---
Voltas pretty good, they raid null with Kiki's and Drekavacs
---
Thats only a small part of the fleet and its needed to keep the fleet running. However no point in discussing with a troll.
---
This is why we each have half a dozen super alts.
---
And people can roll into them. Only way to be sure no one gets in is to monitor your access points. 
---
Want to mine in relative peace. Find a dead end pipe system and stick an alt on the path congrats you are now even safer than a WH.
---
some good Grrr goons here folks....get in while its still hot.
---
Very pretty, but also not really all that intuitive. Lookups are also rather slow.
---
&lt;10% of the fleet flying high sp ships doesn't mean the rest can.
---
This is one of the main reasons I play without sound.
---
There is only one ELO KNIGHT King of the North protector of all muninns slayer or rorquals and king of swagnoroks
---
Ayup.
---
the alliances running full SRP programs have hundreds of billions in the bank with which to continue running it. I'm talking about the little guy ratter/miner who's going to look at the odds of losing his ship and decide its not worth the risk.
---
You memed it wrong. 
---
Should be:
---
"Dscan Button"
---
 Pic
---
"So hot right now"
---
Bot are not affected by this change on mid term. Botter will just change code and adapt. Stop thinking no local kill bot.
---
Usability is about on par, though.
---
That's been going on forever, but only for very large and very specific needs. Generally speaking though, they already have the damn thing built and functional and probably hosted and served all on the corp private network. It's fucking crazy how massive the online service networks are for Goons and TEST, etc.
---
Nononononoonononoonno. /r/eve has told me that all Goons have unsubbed from the game because they are so unhappy with these changes. This is FAKE NEWS.
---
So we need new skill site. BTW I always use Adblock.
---
NPC Deltas change over time. Why would you post a link that's going to change every hour? Take a screenshot at least.
---
wew lad
---
Eve has sound?
---
LS for solo / small gang, wormhole for small gang ( and can still daytrip for solo pvp ) and nullsec for f1
---
At the end of the post he lists some methods for making isk that might interest you, pretty good methods for the blackout
---
I'd actually prefer such a shitshow. That way, the intel component of killmails would be much lower, to the point of functional nonexistence.
---
Uh huh, warping back ina super sounds like the best idea
---
And for the remaining 66% of Eve?
---
Then make your own service you stupid sperge
---
It wouldn't, you still get all the intel he listed with or without delay.
---
Yes, please delay killmails.  Best thing you'll ever do.  Ignore the morons.
---
Thanks all. Now considering 1440p so good to know that the video cards I’m considering will manage that output.
---
Sounds like someone trying to thin the competition.
---
Who's running anoms in a super who doesn't have half a dozen accounts?
---
**Surprised Pikachu**
---
because ive been checking the delta all day. its been at 0 for every system all day long with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 system that had like a +5 increase and that's it.
---
also went through during the night hours of CH TZ and it was fucking dead.
---
And everyone who has their killboard tokens on zKill are going to enter them in on my killboard too?
---
Dont worry It is harley
---
Other than the speed, sure. At least zkill has some decent caching, or so it seems.
---
These types are the same people who, in the same post, accuse us of being too concentrated in Delve, as well as being spread out across too much territory. Critical thinking is a growth area in these sorts.
---
vvvvvvvvvvvv
---
100 mil but returned
---
Automating inputs is against the EULA!! Reported!!!!!!!!
---
now? maybe. (allthough i doubt it) pre ESI? i think we both can think off how that would have looked like...
---
I would have think about Omist, branch and Malpais first but well nice job
---
That's fine and all, but it makes for poor post content. A screenshot would have been far more enduring.
---
[You're welcome](https://imgur.com/a/XNc2VZe).
---
Let's say Inner Hell is rolling holes for content. Before they get to my region, they get a few kills somewhere outside of my sphere of intel. All of a sudden an Inner Hell scout pops up in our space. With a delay, we don't know if it's just a guy or a small gang or a fleet, but thanks to immediate killmails, we see that they have 25 guys in drekavacs with command destroyers, logi, sabres and rapier sitting on the other side of their wormhole somewhere nearby. 
---
That just ruined their surprise and they haven't even left the wormhole yet. We're already pinging for a fleet to kill them all. And that fleet won't be a gg gf, it'll be a "we kill them all and lose nothing fight." Big win for big null groups, big loss for smaller groups.
---
Who wants to bet this guy just lost two carriers and that's where the salt is coming from? Hmm
---
You joke but I can easily see the shared bookmark system using a different format and invalidating all the old bookmarks.
---
Yeah, but the whole interface is completely unintuitive. The dev should at least add a help button of some sort.
---
Say what you will about Zkill, it's pretty user-friendly, even if it's missing some features.
---
Replying to remind myself later once you post it.
---
But it's still dscan immune, which in a delayed local environment, unless you have scouts on every gate in a system still has the surprise advantage.
---
Ages to warp doesn't mean anything if your opponent only knows when you exit warp.
---
Which isn't that one reason why people were memeing about Curse price speculation earlier this week?
---
Intel gathering is and for some people using zkill or similar sites also is and that is what I said - literally gave 3 examples -, do you just blindly follow the narrative without a second thought? (rhetorical question)
---
Did you just expect them to roll over and die because of a local blackout?
---
I think zkill could've ruined the blackout in a lot of ways. So yeah, this is a great idea for the weekend to make it extra scury
---
Pls. Just make battleships completely unable to leave also.
---
&gt;Or maybe they're trying to find an area that isn't umbrella'd to hell and back.
---
If had followed BB's recent theme you'd see that they go after imperium and legacy space almost exclusively at this point.
---
As long as he posts the poll on zkill, reddit and in eve forums to get maximum visibility, sure. That sounds fair.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVM-KfkNark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVM-KfkNark)
---
Lmao nice brigade, at least post the ping
---
I wouldn't mind the idea of a monthly purge, where one of the weeks in each month at random will be a blackout.
---
why didn't bombers bar bring *bombs,* that's the real question.
---
Yup same. And I'm not even playing the game anymore. I just wanna see everything on fire.
---
You probably gotta leave Delve to find anything tbh Bees sleep when its dark.
---
What? I wasn’t the one arguing for pve. I only recently resubbed and I don’t pve at all.
---
My favorite so far is getting caught in my rattlesnake, only to 2 shot the dps with a gecko while I can’t catch the stiletto keeping me pointed
---
that's what they made bombs for, or have you guys been going after defenseless krabs for so long you forgot you can put bomb launchers on those ships?
---
So I don't think this will be a very popular opinion, but I think we should also consider removing the dotlan/in game map intel too.  I'm not saying this is a "good" idea, but something that maybe might make it a little more dark, and make hunting a little harder too?
---
I hope zkill has a special 'blackout' weekend section where we can see all the big juicy losses lol
---
Good point. I guess all I'm saying is I rely on zkill a lot more than I thought I did.
---
It is like Null sec has never been safe specially to nuets when they wonder into delve
---
I remember warp-to. Good and bad days, lol
---
It's debatable, and it's only my opinion- but in some ways yes.  
---
People choose to explore facets of EVE because of the style and substance they entail. Generally, in the case of greater null sec, that facet is large scale null sec warefare, albeit funded by krabing.   
---
In the case of WH it's fluxating space, lack of safety, the enigmatic unknown and smaller gang PVP within J or raiding into K.   
---
In the case of High Sec its.. er, Theme park stuff? I dunno, but I'm not gonan judge, whatever it is they like it.  
---
Changing those mechanics alters the facets of WH content that WH pilots enjoy, just the same as removing local from null sec removes the ability of null sec alliances to focus on warefare between large alliances and degenerates it to smaller scale pvp warfare and guarding assets.   
---
Just as I'd prefer not to add High Sec local to WH space, because that's an aspect that makes it unique and enjoyable, I'd prefer not to blackout local in null, or remove concord from highsec. I don't want to homogenize the experiences.
---
Hate cynos not goons
---
Gr8 b8 m8 i8 8/8
---
God i'd forgotten about the bookmarks in cans.. I remember this in C6s.
---
hmmm would be fun if this were true sad thing is obvious bait is obvious XO
---
Hey guys, I went in and the hole collapsed... I think a carrier went in before me. Anyway, I'm gonna ask the locals to scan an exit down for me.
---
Is that made by an intern or something?
---
The point of armada fleets is not to go after subcaps but capitals. Be it krabs or stuff that jumps in to help. They are equipped with fvb's. Also we are not complaining. We knew no local would at least in the short term be bad for bombers bar. But we believe its good for the game. Thats why we rallied behind olmeca.
---
It depends. (Like always).
---
If it’s a bunch of cheap items such as ammo, or most rat drops, you can sell it at the buy price in Jita for close to its estimated value. However doing so can take a while, as you have to sell them in clumps. It can also be annoying.
---
What I end up doing for most low value items is just going to the nearest free or near free reprocessing plant and reprocess the lot for minerals. Minerals tend to have much tighter buy and sell values, and you can turn 100 unique items into 10 different minerals that are worth roughly the same.
---
For more higher value items I wouldn’t reprocess them. Instead I’d take them to Jita, and check the buy / sell values before you sell it. If they’re way different odds are you have a rarer item, and you should place a sell order. If they’re close enough for comfort then just sell it off. 
---
However some higher-ish items (like the warp disruption field generators) actually sell more of you reprocess them! 
---
A way to help keep all your loot together in the future is to set a designated station (preferably in high sec close to wherever you are) where you dump all of it at the end of the day. 
---
Fly safe! o7
---
I have that from birth.
---
I legit thought it was going to be a pic of some deformed baby
---
I don't know. I just saw the post.
---
Same with dronelands and frat space, was hunting like 10 regions today, didnt see a single vni/ishtar bot.
---
Shitty reply to a dramatic response to your terrible suggestion.
---
As a wormhole resident, intel is really only able to be gotten in a few ways: system zkill, or player zkill that you saw in system. By delaying wh killboards and slowing that intel, it would make cloaky vs cloaky fights much more difficult to find. It's good to know if a system is hot, because it allows for more content. 
---
By delaying wormhole kills, it would be more difficult to figure out if people are group hunting in a hole, and the only thing you can do is blindly fly around until you find probes in a hole.
---
Same tbh
---
Needs alot of people (or accounts) to work :/
---
Proof? lol I doubt there is any
---
we'll just adapt like always
---
It's not much help. Most warmholers coming to visit will be chain rolling a nullsec static until they find you. That way they are safe with a clean hole only they know about.
---
You do not roll w-space. W-space rolls you.
---
I guess [zkillboard.com](https://zkillboard.com) is broken now.  I just want to see how many ships the Triglavian Collective destroyed today. lol
---
&gt; mrgothmog from the New Eden Inquirer here. 
---
Please stop coming on my minecraft server and asking for op, it's not going to happen.
---
So delete it?
---
So Basically...
---
All the krabs are docked up not doing anything while hunters are out PVPing with each other. They are fighting other combatants because they are actually out there looking for fights instead of responding to some Krabs distress call about being bubbled in a belt.
---
Something they could have always done anyway. All thats changed is the willingness of the PVE Krab to stay docked up where he belongs so the PVP folks can play the game.
---
Was never about the mechanics just the mentality.
---
The proof is right here on zkill
---
 https://zkillboard.com/
---
Great advice
---
It's not the size that matters it's how you use it. Right? Right???
---
Lol delicious salt
---
You are not with the randomness of the holes that open in null sec.  The wormhole systems are safer as they typically only have certain wormholes that can roll into them.  Null sec that is not true.  That would also limit mining to a vastly reduced number of specific systems.  So Congratz you have further forced people to group into smaller specific areas (or have alot more accounts I guess but for alot of folks thats just unfeasible.)  It sounds like the risk reward balance has definitely swung pretty far in the other direction which may not be entirely feasible for money making at all.
---
Some sounds I want. This sound I don't want.
---
Incursions and the new Trig invasions are fun.
---
Welcome to the Thunderdome bitch
---
And you didn’t take them out.
---
&gt; Right now Nullsec PVE is dull as hell 
---
Eh, EVE PVE is dull as hell.    Problem is bigger than nullsec.
---
Because if he did it would be found out or leaked pretty quickly... Having access to a no-delay killboard is not a secret that could be kept for long.
---
I mean that's good and all but you're unfortunately not everyone. I think there would be a big flock to something with feature parity of what we have now. Or as I said, internal tools benefiting the large blocs on defense.
---
You gain loyalty points (LP) and ISK by doing missions, killing player enemies and capturing objectives. If all you’re flying is basic fit T1 ships in small fleets you can easily replace them with your earnings.
---
I haven't even logged in today. Maybe you did? =P
---
I use drones to blowup additional cache and 'Packrat' Mobile Tractor Unit. if all rats down and last cache 50-60km + i'm not waiting.

use the map

It really whips the llama's ass.
---
Does this really change that usecase though? If you're just wanting to see his kb/fits thats still available.
---
It's true.   Delve is nearly defenseless.    Please don't beat us any more.
---
I tried, I couldn't find a good one. Have one in case some day i actually resub?
---
If you don't mind me asking on this thread...can I do this and have the two ships fly together?
---
So a hauler with an armed escort?
---
I SEE THIS AS AN ABSOLUTE WIN
---
why you gotta be mad though?
---
The real value in zkill is in the ESI token list. It's not actually that complicated a piece of software, just a lot of scale.
---
Someone screenshot me the starmap with all those cynos pls
---
and then you run all your sites and log off for 3 days while they respawn. seems reasonable.
---
outside those regions they will just switch to orcas  for boosts.
---
K
---
The truth will never be suppressed indefinitely.
---
I'm not a big fan of goons but love TEST because of this attitude. One time our bois were moon mining and some other gang jumped in and we were ordered to stand down so we all docked and uhh ... stayed docked. A gang from TEST jumps in, mops the floor with the other group and posts on local, 'We showed you our dicks, now show us yours.' 
---
Never change TEST, would've joined you if you weren't allied to goons.
---
Than they play the wrong game.
---
Warped into a lost battle , killed a saber and went to Valhalla, gfs in local, it was a good day
---
Inb4 CCPs next rolling blackout affects cynos somehow
---
If you want to afk mine go to high sec. I'm a casual as well which is why I stay my ass in high sec. All you're doing is potentially hurting your Corp and alliance by being a fucktard afker.
---
🤔
---
So because they are not ok with having a massive amount of isk involved in earning a small to mediocre reward that is incredibly boring to earn they are playing the wrong game...
---
&gt;  The wormhole systems are safer as they typically only have certain wormholes that can roll into them. Null sec that is not true
---
i dont think you know how wormholes work, cause it aint this way
---
delete this
---
I am so angry grrrrrrrrrr
---
Salt? your taste buds are a bit off my friend :)
---
dotlan is blackouted fyi
---
No everything can be scanned with  skills/implants/hulls. You can make it impossible for SOME players, but nothing like the slippery Petes and off grid boosters of the day. Or you could... you know... fit a cloak.
---
This sounds like an awesome feature 100% support
---
goons are more likely to lose supers to npcs than panfam, thats not a dig at panfam btw its just how bad goons are
---
I like the idea (I'd prefer more than 1h tbh), but I think it's on CCP's, if you delay your kb I'll look for another one that gives better intel to fight the enemy. It's our nature I guess.
---
I drop lokis soz v0v
---
Nerf cyno and we good
---
Naw its one of the less annoying sounds in the game honestly.
---
Am I looking at it wrong? Any region I look at shows all systems at 0
---
\*LOSING
---
Is there a monthly subscription plan

"Join Sniggwaffe" in game channel

what is discord
---
Send it to me
---
blackout has caused that disease that gives you shitposts
---
It later new Bomber Bar rage rolled for 4 HOURS for delve and didnt get Mashy is Complaining CCP is helping goons more new as 9 eve time
---
 
---
# Delve is still no fun. Cynos everywhere
---
Hint if you want to hunt stuff don't go to Delve, you will be blobed by supers. Nothing changed.  
---
CCP need to consider cyno jamming the whole region to change something.
---
I read every Dev Blog. And you still have provided not one iota of evidence to support your claim.
---
'member when we used local for that?
---
I'm having withdrawal symptoms already.
---
Why don't you then?
---
You're wrong? Great talk.
---
You aren't gathering intel from an in game source though. You are getting it through a 3rd party that people shared their keys with. If killboard culture wasn't so pervasive you would have a lot more people like goons who don't want their shit on zkill. And for those people its not about wanting their stats to look good its about not wanting to give out free intel.
---
WWJMD?
---
That's pretty much what it looks like.
---
learn to tackle XO i know this might be pushing the boat out but there has to be atleast 1 decent inty pilot in goons right?? just by the law of averages someone has to be good XO
---
Show us where the Wizard Hat touched you.
---
and people tell me my posts are bad
---
You're looking correctly, Dotlan is blacked out as well
---
yea its not annoying or intrusive, i just want options :) make it optional on all alerts :) that be fun wouldnt it
---
Are you not amused?
---
Agreed I was just poking fun. Its not under Warning Sounds or Secondary Interfaces?
---
remove zkillboard service at all.
---
As a 4th rate internet celebrity, I order you to delete this.
---
Except most of that stuff is available in game lmao, what a stupid decision.
---
Sent, so double it and send it back?
---
Hi friend, dotlan isn't updating for those stats...cause it's a black out. Click on any of those systems stats. You'll see 😁
---
I don't mind what he's done at all, but perhaps there's some 'grounds' to complain. zKillboard is more of a service than content, and it's very common for service providers to have certain legal responsibilities to their users relating to consistency of service, even if the users haven't directly paid for it.
---
Obviously providing a service for a game without being paid means nothing like that could ever really apply, but the responsibility might still be there from a moral standpoint.
---
There is a discord snd this morning it was closed down to one channel 'local'.    It distilled all of the autism of the sever into one tiny room, i left the server after the 5th ping.
---
before
---
can i have your stuff LOL
---
That was good and not what I expected
---
Ah lol i feel you :)
---
This just makes us use a shittier UI in the ingame map.
---
Please unfuck.
---
actually hadnt looked before but cant find an option for that no
---
wtf is GSOL?
---
zkillboard's thoughts and prayers are with \#blackout victims until monday dt, source: squizz said it in his thread about it i guess idk
---
it seems like you are not exactly on the newest hypetrain
---
I can’t remember which sound it is in the options but you can turn it off. You’ll lose the little clicks when you highlight modules and stuff on the UI but that’s about all I’ve noticed.
---
por que no los dos?
---
I just wish I could have the hourly npc kills statistic instead of only a 24 hour option.
---
+1 supporter
---
Makes sense and I agree with you. This was brought up a few times actually, it will allow people to spread “jew roam” out without giving off ratting activities.
---
NPC kills aren't, only the 24h statistics are. Current (delta/to-the-hour) stats are not available in game.
---
Also with zkill down, it's impossible to know where any fights are taking place.
---
ingame map totally tells you these things xD
---
Lmao!
---
u think nobody except one or two guys have killed an npc dipshit? dotlan is also blacked out
---
What is CCP paying you to be thier cheerleader? Take your head out of the sand and look at the facts. Every change recently has been about reducing playing income and helping us incur more losses. Do you really think that CCP is doing this for your entertainment? No this about money, they don't want the player base making ISK, they want you whipping out your credit card and buying it. If this doesn't worry you then you either A. Have too much money, or B. Don't pay attention.
---
I just want to be able to link kills to mAh friends squizz I don't care if it's an hour old.
---

&gt; I really just want to be able to consistently find solo fights

yes
---
&gt; and be able to whelp smaller ships (frigates/Dessie’s)

---
eeeeee
---
Detorid's dead too, aside from some pods trying to run sites.
---
Audio under the headline advanced audio settings. There are several slide bars two of which are warning sounds and secondary interfaces. No specific button for just the d scan though.
---
yes. most of r/eve apparently thought we would
---
Oh, I see, autocorrect got me. 
---
&gt;An hour delay will keep us from learning most of that, but the majority of the info is still there.
---
That should say an hour delay **won't** keep us from learning most of that.

Muted for being dumb.

No, me :

Your posting tbh.

I muted all notifications from that discord months ago. Every now and then I peek in and am reminded why I don't hang out in there.

Jita
---
Logged in staging. Saw empty local. Felt sad. I logged off until a ping came.
---
It's a stupid fucking meme, gimping everything.
---
There's always that one dickhead from another corp that won't post the killmail. When we're in those fleets it's always nice to pull up zkill and see the kill after a minute or two.
---
Cool, what J-sig are you in? Let me know and we’ll gladly help getting you out...
---
If you want to hunt krabbers, you'll have to go looking!
---
Lowsec will do you well. You wont get constant fights but is best place for the solos stick to either black rise or bleak lands personally i pvp in Bleak just keep to the more trafficked systems i usally only check kamela/lamaa/kourmonen/huola/auga/amamake/sisede these days. as for blobs it will happen however if you stick to the same area you will get a feel for who can offer you a decent 1v1.
---
Cool, I'll just use one of the other out of game maps :)
---
Tell me the names of said BB fc's. Bet you cant. Because its utter bullshit. 
---
We go for everyone. One of our fc's who joined fraternity even gave up his role because he wouldnt be able to drop on certain alliances.
---
Panfam just doesnt have that much (capital) krabs out compared to others. We hit legacy most of the time because:
---
1. The chance of rolling into your space is higher (you are spread across 7 regions)
---
2. You got the second highest amount of krabbing (more targets)
---
3. The umbrella isnt as strong as goons.
---
4. You are active during eutz, when most bb fleets take place.
---
The other big group that krabs and which you didnt blue are the chinese. We would go for them, but their space is empty most of the time during eutz.
---
&gt;I mean they kind of function as a private game developer inside a game.
---
It'd be more like a dev-tools team, but you're mostly right. Goons' setup is better than some of the studios I've worked for.
---
I would but your corp didn't give me the proper delivery I ordered when you guys finally delivered (which took weeks!). So I'll just edit it instead.
---
HAHAHAHAHhahahahah can I have YOUR STUFF AHAHAHAHAH
---
I meant irl but yes new eden weather is pretty shit
---
It's going to be hunters hunting hunters hunting hunters.
---
Unfortunately a decade of abuse by bots, and nullsec being risk averse faggots means something has to change or the game does.
---
I meant IRL too. Its too hot, im staying inside.
---
I can't imagine why.
---
https://i.vgy.me/RJiDKk.jpg

There are other out of game maps that show hourly npc kills lol
---
Deleted all of it.  No one gets my work.  Do it yourself

Please read what I wrote. Sanding more then 300 -400 grit 99% does absolutely nothing.

The only exception is cherry which has unique properties
---
Why would anyone want to find people in certain regions?
---
LOL found the frightened krab.
---
NS is the most secure and safest space in the game. Its safer than Hisec. Good grief.
---
I thought it was funny and a nice move
---
Still down now :(
---
3/10 meme
---
I JUST WANT MY GASS WHY WON’T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!
---
I can't imagine why anyone would want to hunt for specific regions.
---
There can't be any reason why, it must be some bias of some sort.
---
Also fuck goons, fuck TEST, fuck Panfam.
---
i fully agree. we used to write software to track people in whs in real time through the eve api. it was fucked up and we had a huge kill rate. apis that provide real time info should be set at least to delayed.
---
I’m aware of the implications, thanks. lol
---
First one - before long there will be many many more like this
---
As a new inhabitant of wormhole space, I think I have seen this done twice already. Very safe and fast.
---
just turn down the secondary interface audio slider
---
Grrr gons
---
Everything is bait. We had 5 dudes waiting on a bait VNI, hoping he would be tackled. We got some more guys and we upgraded to a gate camp lol.
---
Sometimes I wonder if you're unhinged, a genius or dangerous...
---
Yes to all of it. You are awesome!
---
lol apparently I am frightened crab.  How dare I talk balance and  on this holiest of anti krabbing subs without being a krab  (not that its actually a bad thing).  The correction here for you is that it "was" and is now no longer, but that may now mean it is now too far into the risk, at least imo for mining.  Also I dont live in Null atm, used to.
---
adapt or die
---
This isn’t Wow.
---
I like it.
---
Link? Always good to have more options and data.

wormhole    █████ ███ expanded  █  ██ happy :)

It wasnt you perago    i liked the corp the problem i had was with alliance leadership with francis    not with you guys

Been making Tacs for most of null going back to 2009.  Sales to begin tomorrow am.

---
UI is designed for mobile and a bit ugly though
---
Unironically true
---
Squizz, zKill is your baby, you do with it what you will.
---
Thank you.
---
Yea that was after i had a big discussion with francis and some other dudes who called me dum b and stupid on the alliance discord
---
I think the same effect should take effect for everyone or not at all. You should also think of other users for your site. I would bet that there are plenty of people that still like to view kills going on in realtime regardless of it's intel value. I know that I have friends that stopped playing Eve but whenever there's stuff going down in the game, they open up zkill and see what's going on in realtime. Sometimes, those of us that play Eve link zkills to them while we are in fleet for interesting stuff we just killed. Everyone's different, just my two cents.
---
How a response saved a shitpost
---
&gt;guy blue to 2/3 of the game's playerbase says he cant find anyone to fight...
---
You dont say?
---
Oooh you're a little salty :)
---
&gt;learn to tackle XO i know this might be pushing the boat out but there has to be atleast 1 decent inty pilot in goons right?? just by the law of averages someone has to be good XO
---
Yeah, but then they got a super and are sitting waiting for something to get tackled so they can swing their .. supers all over the place.
---
[Where'd everybody go?](https://i.imgur.com/VsX07cZ.gif)
---
Seems like a great idea, nothing can go wrong here
---
asteros, always asteros
---
Some mysteries should remain unsolved. It's better for all of us if we don't know the answer.
---
Yup! That said, the krabs will return. They will adapt, they always do, and then the real fun begins.
---
I guess I'm the only one who only uses it to see how my corp mates are doing when they go on roams before I wake up... That and to take a look at how fleet fights go.
---
Delay results until downtime if it makes you happy.
---
Touché...
---
So you didnt heard about Jita Blockade right?
---
Tea and cake or death?
---
Orca
---
orca
---
Like a couple of other people said you can put your fortizar in an orca.
---
Lol why you think that?  I have all of 8 months invested in this game and between all you better vet attitudes and my own ability to see that ccp is never gonna fix their game, just continuing these lazy half assed attempts, I decide it’s not for me
---
Pretty easy decision actually.
---
I think 24 hours is a good length of time for null and wormholes. One hour is still really good intel in some cases.
---
Oh definitely not too hot here
---
Hey I think scraping Intel logs is fine. That's what I was trying to get at, what if we only relied on in stuff like that, Intel and in game map statistics...
---
We know you are there, there's just too much shit to kill, just got done killing a 15 man brutix gang when a 20 man frig and Desi gang is reported 5 jumps away, then Bjorn bee inbound with 70 ass frigs, drive him off, 12 man init stratos drop, kill that, now 20 man harby gang... I needed a break at that point. Who has time to probe down 1 lone ship?
---
 July 12th, 2019   
---
Some  of you might heard about it. CCP Games decided to change the local of  nullsec systems into delayed mode. This means it behaves like wormhole  space and you don’t know who’s around you until they reveal their  presence.
---
Some sites in the eve online community (like zkillboard.com) decided  to join in and turn their page black during the weekend. After some  initial thoughts and after my kids went to bed I decided to join in. But  rather then going black completely, I opted to just hide the  sovereignty, kills/jumps and system related historical changes from the  main page.
---
This way you can feel the blackout but you don’t lose the ability to navigate into “unknown” 🙂
---
Fly safe.
---
\--
---
From the Dotlan Blog
---
I agree. However, building battle reports will be harder. Is there a way we can have battle reports behave differently?
---
Presumably the reason you want live Intel is to protect your own members? So youd care most about your own losses.
---
It was npsi
---
Ill happily talk to CCP about it. Key binding a single stroke key is not against the EULA it does not alter gameplay it does not give me an advantage it does not combine multiple actions that would be inhuman to do.
---
It activates DScan 1 time per server tick the same as all other avenues of activation.
---
It just saves me from wearing out my hotkey by pressing it as you said 3000 times.
---
But by all means if you seek more clarity on the subject get CCP in here.
---
shieeeet. He knows
---
I have learned a side of the Gurristas I was previously unaware of.
---
While I agree, I have also used it for intel
---
I am quite curious about how bad the excavator bloodbath has been TBH. I suspect the rest of the game hasn't left their nano and gate camp ships all day but I am sure there were people still mining in excavators without any protection.
---
no you're just an idiot
---
Tis true...Dotlan does seem like a set it and forget it server side tool...its just that so many people from small gang to big bloc fcs use it to show how many npc kill deltas (indicating active ratting)...imagine null as truly unknown...
---
everything is more terrifying when it is unknown
---
Great insight. Gonna be fun times. Become a verified Brave publisher so that I can tip you.
---
Nah, you don't need to out blob the goons: just their supply of people with a grain of sense and an ability to tackle. That is a much more limited resource.
---
As a filthy casual, if you were to make changes as described above, you would not effect how I use your service. I also agree the changes you describe should be implemented at the API level. This shouldn't be your burden to take on.
---
Went Up to tribute over to Perri Falls, Malpais, Kalevala, Malpais, Oasa, Malpais Kalevala Etherium Then it gets fuzzy and we ended up in Catch. before going back Hundreds of jumps and it was crap. Map shows most with 0 ratting and one would assume 0 mining. Twas the desert save one system in Kalevala where they were PL or NC. were trying to use titans to kill us but ended up killing hoard by accident. 
---
4 hours of .........
---
That might be -- I do most of my play in groups/fleets. I literally have one solo kill and he just wanted a quick trip home.
---
But tuzy I need iskies for my toonies
---
It’s garemo. But, I’ll probably use my other char irockpreggochics kahoudi. Unfortunately due to work and school I won’t be able to do this until next week.
---
Try in and look at ratting numbers...... "0".   
---
100+ systems and 0 save R10
---
u/Squizz I LOVE YOU!
---
YAAAAY!
---
First roam we took out after blackout, we fought two other roaming gangs (one dunk, one feed), and found multiple solo pilots to blob, would recommend.
---
😂
---
Do it. 
---
Discord bots + ZKill is ridiculous.
---
So if this causes a significant player drop and CCP has to revert, can we trial local in wormholes to see if that increases player count?
---
Wormhole players were very eager to change nullsec into space like theirs and it didn't work, maybe the reverse would work and reinvigorate wormholes.
---
Also, the gang we fought was Tuskers. They hunted us because we killed one of their solo dudes, twice. With local, maybe we wouldn't have managed the kill and they wouldn't have been as motivated to come out and dunk us.
---
All alone in the dark...
---
Solo plus scout alt is recommended. I'm using my tackle alt as a scout. Saved me today. Goons had 6 titans in o-i. 3 on each gate in boson position.
---
And it’s awesome.
---
Capsuleers don't die, they are immortal. EVE lore 101.
---
But now how will the hunters find their targets, rather than just loading up a webpage and checking npcs killed?
---
Hell no.
---
It won't, but keep thinking that
---
Naxirian really hit the nail on the head. There's also a hypothesis I had which that fight confirmed: we're going to see more roaming gangs and gatecamps. The real reason I was so excited about the blackout was that I was expecting to see roaming gangs a bit more commonplace. It isn't always about fighting on an unleveled playing field against a defenceless krab, fighting another gang in your gang is one of the most fun fights you will have. Both sides have formed up and want to be there.

By pulling up the in game map that has the same shit?

I'm wondering if anyone has done an in depth study on the value and profit of mining. Such as:
---
How much a belt is worth in high sec, low sec, and null sec
---
Isk per hour per mining hulk
---
How much profit an orca adds to a mining op
---
Selling ore vs minerals vs finished goods
---
Quick sell vs long sell
