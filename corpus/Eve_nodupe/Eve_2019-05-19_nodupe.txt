It's not that we need more force multipliers. It's that the existing force multipliers need severe diminishing returns.
---
---
---
Maybe they should be useless. 
---

---
I've always been of the opinion you should get a cyno, or panic mode.  Not both.
---
It wouldn't make them useless, it would just dampen their impact -- which is the point of this.
---
We need something to prevent TQ from turning into Serenity 2.0.

I'm not the author dude. Literally just a fan. I posted cause the update is for the eve community. I bought the first book and loved it (as did alot of eve players).

Caladrius lmao. I never said anything about KOS being good btw, they sucked just as much as GOTG, maybe not as much as Darkness. but definitely the rest. don't see what your trying to say by pulling them down lol. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
GOTG didn't pull its weight when goons deployed inn full strength. There were daily fights over ihubs and jammers, the only viable defense of the co2 keepstars. co2 outformed gotg almost every time. Showing that you showed up in force for the big fights don't really matter as those fights were not the ones that really meant something
---
But hey, at least you can keep fcing corms
---
are you disappointed that a 25k coalition evacs from a 50k coalition with 40k allies?
---
it's like "killing eve" except its not a tv show
---
Agreed.
---
Let's go back to the days of snipe battleship fleets. We all line up and honorably fight to the death.
---
Actually alot of fun and hasnt leaded to eviction of any kind. Destroying a fort and rfing some sov isnt really eviction and you can't really ever evict pixels. Its just fun to be inside of a pvp battle besides when ph and nc need 100s of people to fight smaller people they just blob you out. But in any sense its still fun to do
---
CCP can just add captcha for green anoms, like mosaic with birds in 9 pieces
---
Won't be too lopsided if NC calls on those who enjoy shooting goons. I think a lot of people underestimate NC/PL.
---
What's sad is the north not even fighting. That some weak shit coming from the people that brought in the massive coalition to "make TEST homeless" less than a year ago.
---
Where did you get the models? Thingiverse?

It’s an advertisement. You’re a shill. You may feel justified in your shilling but you still are.

---
There used to be a term that’s stood through the entire existance of Eve Online: Adapt or die.
---
But now certain alliances are filled with vets who are too bitter to adapt and they seem really bothered with their 2010 helicopter dicking zkillwarrior playstyle not being dominant anymore.
---
They even get all uppity when this is pointed out, and act like including industrialists in their alliances means they themselves will be marched at gunpoint out to mine the ore anoms and build the capitals.
---
No kink shaming! 
---
But seriously, why? To say “I was there”? To each their own I guess
---
If CCP wants doesn't want it to null to become stale, they should revert cyno jammer changes. It almost literally makes much harder to even contests sov ownership. Raw number of timers that have to be won for this makes cancerous to even contests. 
---
Besides that, there is no real incentive to take someone's sov. Delve proved that one region can truly big number of players. No need to spread out. 
---
Couple more dead Rorqs won't change it.
---
I see a big block of words but I'm unable to read past the first line.
---
Rifters are one of the worst frigates now
---
*nods sagely*
---
That coalition was smaller than TEST's coalition tho
---
Not to mention has nothing to do with Bots
---
CO2 formed for dumb shit that had nothing to do with their keepstars daily, yes. No one gave a fuck about ihubs in upper Pure Blind. Gotg formed for every timer that was actually important and agreed upon by the allied leadership (including CO2, NC and PH leadedrship). And then when CO2 were supposed to coordinate effective defense with us for shit that mattered, they didn't. When plans came together well we got good defence like the first time DW- Keepstar was attacked, but the majority of the time CO2 were very poor at coordinating with everyone else. 
---
I generally don't like shitting on people we were working with, but the amount of times CO2 leaders were given a job to do in coordination channels and simply didn't show up was incredible. No jammers anchored when they were supposed to be. No one gunning structures when it was needed. Gigx and Da Winci bitching and arguing with leadership constantly about everything. I'm not blaming them for the overall loss, but the narrative that CO2 fought the Goon menace while the rest of us did nothing is rubbish. CO2 did what CO2 wanted while the rest of us tried to coordinate an actual defense.
---
such an un-effective tactic, much better off putting different types of weapons with their best ammo.

Honestly considering how badly some people fit and flew then maybe this is still too complex as entry level. I cant imagine many other people theorycrafted as hard as we did and there was a lot to do between day 1 and day 2.

Y'all brought this upon yourselves by kicking us out of Deklein.

for an alliance with unspoken in your first name,
---
you sure do talk a lot of shit
---
A blob is just a group of a bunch of people. So if you take a 250 man fleet and bridge onto a 50 man gang, you’re blobbing. 
---
I think he’s just talking about larger fleets in general, because in a fleet of really more than 20-30 people there stops being a lot of room for most of the people to take much initiative, instead you just anchor on the FC and follow broadcasts. If you’re doing that with strangers for no reason it’s super boring. If you’re doing that with people you know and like, and you’re doing it to defend your space from people who are trying to take it, suddenly it’s pretty fun.
---
That would be the _actually having players use your sov space to afford some goddamn supers and titans_ nullsec meta.
---
Enjoy the 4000 goons coming at you , shit head &lt;3
---
that coalition massively outnumbered legacy in supercaps, caps and numbers in fleet.  
---
  
---
I know that counting ratting alts is a reddit favourite to show that "we're fighting a 40k coalition" but those number don't matter. What matters is what you put in fleet and how many (super)caps you have. Both of which vastly outnumbered Legacy.  
---
The very second goon supercaps landed on grid in UALX and that advantage was gone, the war was over.  
---
So, no. That coalition was not smaller than TEST's for the duration of the war. Not in terms of power, assets or skill, skillpoints or any other metric that mattered.  
---
That whole invasion was a cowardly move to try and pick on someone they hoped to steamroll. They quit after one real fight.
---
I thought the Imperium and goons were the same thing.
---
Can you please explain how this works and what the differences are?
---
you are welcome to contact a mod
---
I know what hotkeys you use! I know your secrets!
---
TIL NCPL cannot afford supers and titans.
---
Hi, newbro here.  
---
What is the organizational issue preventing the rest of the server from temporarily aligning and stomping them?
---
Aww can we keep him?
---
Imperium = Goons + Init, Bastion, Lawn, and sometimes Snuff.
---
Day 1 meta was solid and fun to fly.
---
What are you talking about? 
---
As someone like minmatar or caldari different ammo types is very effective.  You can do broad spectrum damage, and also adapt on the fly to your enemy by easily seeing which damage type is hurting more.
---
I think you're an idiot but here, let me help: it's not that we dont want to mine, or build, because every alliance you're talking about has players in it who do exactly that without being botched at for doing it.
---
Here's the secret though, none of us ever liked that kind of game play, so we just dont do it.  Nobody is stigmatized for it, it's just the game play is like waiting for AIDS to kill you..
---
Most of the rest of the server is blue to them?
---
Heeeey, I've met you once! And by met I mean warped my Stratios right into a bubbled wormhole and you guys killed me. Now I always check if WH is clean if I wasn't there for more than half an hour before warping in to zero. And now I mostly fly in Astero anyway, heh.
---
P.S. You also were making some content in a low sec near my home recently, you guys are sure quite active.
---
ok
---
You don't split ammo types in between targets. Full dps on primary.  If you are gun whoring 3 targets with different ammos for each you are wasting firepower.
---
Is that breadcrumbs? No eating infront of the computer..
---
Not even invested in this war and I am interested. It would be cool to see the mineral value of a titan fleet
---
username checks out
---
ah that sucks.  I don't really know all the relationships between alliances, just the names.  Is there a map of this somewhere?  
---
goons are going to stomp pandemic horde and test alliance right?  They can't get volta and code and all them to help them?  Isn't snuffed out chaotic neutral and could be persuaded?  
---
No one in hi-sec would ever donate to pandemic horde to help them right?
---
No one said split ammo types among different targets....
---
I care about local and am neither krab or bot. I like the top tier banter.
---
I dread the noise level in quiet comms.
---
.
---
That is genuinely disgusting.
---
The more weak your ship is, the more likely that you'll be engaged. So try downgrading to a T1 frigate or destroyer.
---
What if CCP threw an arms race and only Goons showed up?
---
As a Rag pilot, I concur!
---
no it didn't. legacy had more supertits than the other side at UALX, and were winning the fight before goons jumped in and broke the server. in the end they unironically blobbed themselves out of a victory.
---
They were *horrific* at the time of CSM 8. Like, not just bad, but ludicrously bad. One example we were given: if you wanted a new type of rat for a mission, you had to manually enter into the database every little piece of information about that rat, with no automatic tools for doing so at all. Once that was done, there were apparently then multiple sub-databases where the same or supporting information *also* had to be entered and that data had be identical to the first database. Again, this had to be done completely manually and if everything didn't match, then the rat might not appear or might not function if it did.
---
We weren't given all of the technical details, but apparently it was that level of bad.
---
One of the big efforts that Seagull wanted to put into place that wasn't made public was to redo all of those tools, an effort she estimated would take years. It definitely wasn't done at the end of CSM 8's term. Later CSMs would have to comment on how and if it's been done at all. I assume they're much better now, though, because of all the new events that have been created in the last three years or so.

In practice [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/submit?selftext=true).

This is bait, right?

At the very least when they do activate they should kill active cynos (but keep the movement penalties of the cyno) as soon as they do activate
---
no :(
---
Game ain't what it used to be, that coalition is dead and rightly so bcs we wud do it no justice in this day and age
---
What "passive" income sources did you use?
---
buttblasted redditors will be mad always, they are jelly they dont have big toys
---
Im not sure why you think you are entitled to a fair fight against a massively superior opponent.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to do there, but at no time did I suggest switch between targets. Someone else said that is why you might want to split your gun groups, I suggested otherwise for a different reason.
---
But NC. is THE premier Alliance, they drove The Imperium out of their former home. No one could match the mighty power of NCPL, no one! (Except maybe Provibloc, and well, anyone else)
---
As an executive level manager, I got the very distinct impression that a Directive or Pacesetting management style would be the best fit for CCP employees, with hard deadlines set in advance.
---
So while yeah, I generally agree with your opinion of this style of software development, I have to admit it's a relatively good fit for CCP employees.
---
the rest of eve are too dumb to organize

And nothing of value will be lost.

C4 has another 2 statics that can lead to pvp/K-Space and sometimes  some farm. We usually scan pretty deep chains every direction from home system. We also developed technique and ~400m Gila fit that is capable of clearing solo Frontier Barracks in C4 and Vital gas site, which lets our newbros progress really fast.

---
/u/Squizz how inefficient is zkill filtering by time?  I ran a few earlier and had a noticeable delay.
---
I'm seeing a poor methodology here and wondering how to fix it.
---
Sapporo jones and his minions.
---
because you need enemies in EVE, so usually evictions just end with them leaving ot go somewhere else.
---
otherwise you end up with chinese server, a blue donut where EVERYONE is controlled by 1 power.
---
right now, we close to that.  as TEST is to spineless to be independent, and requires goons to back them up in all major engagements.
---
and goons is unrivaled, no one expected them to recover so well.
---
honestly though, this current war. should be interesting.  Panfam on home turf vs Imperium.  the scaled tipped to Imperium, but Panfam, provided they fight, should get some good fights and might be able to hold.
---
but if TEST joins (and no guessing who'd they join,  its not like they independent enough for us to do a simulated 3 Kingdoms style war),  then it will be over.  panfam will probably refuse to fight.
---
You ran a few \_what\_? Can you be more specific please?
---
&gt; that coalition massively outnumbered legacy in supercaps, caps and numbers in fleet. 
---
what coalition was that? cause as far as I know literally the only entity that had supers staged for and were actually trying to evict tapi(as in, were doing any sov related work) was pl. Skillu + tri had no interest in evicting you and only showed up for the big shit exactly because you people helped and later housed xix. 
---
&gt;I know that counting ratting alts is a reddit favourite to show that "we're fighting a 40k coalition" but those number don't matter. What matters is what you put in fleet and how many (super)caps you have. Both of which outnumbered Legacy. 
---
 do you think only legacy has ratting alts? the rest of the eve universe doesn't? I know you're gonna say that "oh they keep theirs out of alliance" or some other catchphrase, so go and pump up their numbers with their renters (and i guarantee that the pl alts there are at most 10%, and that's highballing it pretty hard). 
---
Another thing, what do people rat on? VNI -&gt; carrier -&gt; super, wow it sure does look like ratting alts actually *do* matter, you just need to not be a brainlet and refit it. 
---
&gt; The very second goon supercaps landed on grid in UALX and that advantage was gone, the war was over. 
---
it wasn't because "the advantage of supercaps was gone", it was because you now formally had helping you the first (by a factor of two or something close to that) biggest coalition in the game, **while being the second** . I like to think its also because pl put down the crack pipe and actually bothered reading citadel mechanics and how they make offensive wars pointless but that's just wishful thinking.
---
&gt; So, no. That coalition was not smaller than TEST's for the duration of the war. Not in terms of power, assets or skill, skillpoints or any other metric that mattered. 
---
again, what coalition?
---
I urge you to reconsider.
---
Hey, now. NCdot and PL were very tired after sitting in X-7O for four months and collecting casino money. They very nearly logged in, too. Mortifying!
---
*Docking Request: Accepted*
---
What did it do? Or what buttons are those?
---
Those are all lies.   
---
Legacy+goons had 79 titans on the BR and FRT/Skillu/Panfam/BL/TRI had 100. 
---
As for winning, the TRI+panfam were winning the isk war 42 vs 57% and the NC. had their superfleet on their way trying to blob just as hard. Because that was panfam do, they blob with supercaps or they give up.
---
are they giving away SP this weekend again?
---
Massively Superior and massively larger are different. The problem is that it seems numbers are what win wars with tactics falling to the secondary concern.
---
Goons didn't expect anyone would listen to the text on the members blue baseball caps.
---
Goons could have (and likely would have) done the same thing NC/PL are readying to do now if HBC made a serious effort to finish goons off. Unanchor shiny shit, refuse to risk anything big, do asymmetric warfare where it makes sense (e.g. low effort on one party results in absolute cancer for the other), and if it gets bad enough just dock up and play a different game until they get bored.
---
&gt;as TEST is to spineless to be independent
---
Uhh, NCPL pretty much drove them to blue up half of EVE just so they could survive. 
---
&gt;honestly though, this current war. should be interesting. Panfam on home turf vs Imperium. the scaled tipped to Imperium, but Panfam, provided they fight, should get some good fights and might be able to hold.
---
I guess you're new? Last time Imperium went up north with their super fleet they pretty much rolled over the north, and now they have less allies than last time.
---
&gt;but if TEST joins
---
if TEST does show up, it will be to shoot NCPL titans, and you can thank NCPL for that.
---
&gt; right now, we close to that. as TEST is to spineless to be independent, and requires goons to back them up in all major engagements.
---
He said, pandemicly.
---
Because if just balling into one large group is always best, you end up with serenity - a single bloc ruling the server with only prearranged fights
---
If this turns into a real war ill log in but no one else has a reason to come to anyone elses aid. They will all just bend the knee.
---
[This coalition](https://imgur.com/a/nVBJB9L)  
---
More titans on the panfam side. You're full of shit. 
---
 
---
Goons only joined in this war when the overwhelming northern coward coalition already formed and announced to evict TEST. They could have not been pussies and attacked goons, but they were just hoping for a easy pushover. Test didn't even UALX, they just fought back and weren't too cowardly to log back in. That's all it took to stop this cowards invasion.
---
Im looking forward to seeing dumb goons die. All the sweet tears as to why theta didnt save them.
---
It's not a fair fight, it's happening close to their staging in space where they'll have jump bridges to make movement easy. The owners of the space still have the advantage.
---
&gt;HBC
---
HBC was shit on. MBC is what you're thinking.
---
There are def a few things wrong with that one.

---
&gt;Uhh, NCPL pretty much drove them to blue up half of EVE just so they could survive.
---
no, its a typical fight.  test would have been evicted, and reformed elsewhere. like every group before them.  as is eve way.
---
instead, they blued up everyone they could,  can't blame panfam for that.  a war is a war. like it always was.
---
&gt;I guess you're new? Last time Imperium went up north with their super fleet they pretty much rolled over the north, and now they have less allies than last time.
---
yeah, when PL was dead after most of their super fleet got trapped south by goons buying test's soul.   we didn't really see their fleet again till long after the war.
---
and Horde was only involved by volunteers in that, as most of it was still building geminate.
---
&gt;if TEST does show up, it will be to shoot NCPL titans, and you can thank NCPL for that.
---
wont be any NCPL titans,  NCPL isn't going to throw away titans as feed vs goons and test.
---
and goons will only have test to blame for the lack of content.
---
Early Amarr lore described them as being descended from "Conformists", a splinter faction of "the Unified Catholic Church". Over the years this has been more or less scrubbed from Amarr lore (same as with the Gallentean being French-descended) and today can just about only be found in the [Amarr Timeline](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/amarr/timeline/).
---
Reddit is only 5 minutes of time. The upcoming 10% tidi with only blues in local will amount to days.
---
I sort of agree with this.the only thing binding all those alliances together was the casino contract.  Once that stopped they ended up shooting and backstabbing each other instead of focusing on ending CFC for good.
---
That 5 minutes a day is worth any tidi

NC + PL Will face un war almost half of the players un The game. Sadly, NC fucked up thing with the other half and now cry about being alone un front of the meatgrinder. XD

Karma is a bitch huh?
---
at this point we must invade mittani's dreams and plant an idea to break up the imperium.
---
I also work in TV! My people!
---
NCPL made the dumbest diplomatic mistake in the history of EVE, when they forced TEST to make a decision on either a:)being farmed by PL when they wanted to try to build up their alliance or b:) move and take their chances with goons. 
---
They had worked with goons before and were allies in the past and knew goons were good on their word.  PL and NC. however cannot be trusted, so they made the decision best for their alliance, moved and made good diplomatic moves to secure their space.  
---
Remember at the end of the Casino War it was TEST, Co2, GoTG, NC, PL and Pandemic Horde on one side with Goons, Initiative, LAWN and Bastion.  Who is left that NC and Panfam have not driven away.  Now take away those decisions and put goons in Delve.  The picture that is painted would be pretty grim for goons.
---
This ^
---
Tonight..
---
I’m ok with NC/PL hiding in low sec refusing to throw away assets.  When they decide to come out again they will just have to rebuild what little they have been able to accomplish until we do it to them again.  Punching down on the north will never get old.

That's all nice and well... but before that you might want to learn punctuation, spacing, and even some basic grammar.

We have different play styles. We are PVP first.
---
Yes, but in our defense we only had two weekends to do everything before the tourney started; we know we made several mistakes, but with the short time notice to get a team together, theorycraft the comps and try to practice with them, it was expected.
---
&gt; they fought against one common enemy on the most telegraphed structure timer possible, yes that's what a coalition means.
---
show me an example of that when doing actual sov work and not some honeypot structure km and then we'll talk. 
---
&gt; weren't too cowardly to log back in.
---
it's easy to log back in when the goon supers were able to hit grid before dt while your reinforcements weren't and when the system is actually under your sov(and therefore you can deploy structures to tether in pretty fast). what is there to gain in logging back in after dt for them? to hellcamp the other side? the thing you guys managed to do for like a week before giving up on how boring it was?
---
also I find it amusing how you keep calling them cowards non stop because they "rely on supercaps" while you yourself says the following:  while acknowledging that all you did by calling goons was actually rely on supercaps:
---
&gt; What matters is what you put in fleet and how many (super)caps you have
---
and fails to notice that "relying on supercaps" is all you did too when calling goons.
---
&gt;NCPL made the dumbest diplomatic mistake in the history of EVE, when they forced TEST to make a decision on either a:)being farmed by PL when they wanted to try to build up their alliance or b:) move and take their chances with goons.
---
i wont disagree there. but then again no one really knew how strong Goons had become until that point.
---
and had it just been NCPL vs Test,  it would have been just another normal war in EVE,  and in the aftermath, the status quo would have been null as normal.
---
instead, the statue quo changed to the first step to serenity.
---
&gt;They had worked with goons before and were allies in the past and knew goons were good on their word.
---
thats propoganda,  goon's word is as false as often as its true.  you only need to look at their history to see that. or do i need to remind ya of the false war they tried to start for the sake of a book.
---
&gt; PL and NC. however cannot be trusted, so they made the decision best for their alliance, moved and made good diplomatic moves to secure their space.
---
NCPL is as untrustworthy as Imperium and Test.    and aye, i wont disagree that the move was good,  short term,    but long term it would have been better had test been evicted and then goons slammed PL.  
---
&gt;Remember at the end of the Casino War it was TEST, Co2, GoTG, NC, PL and Pandemic Horde on one side with Goons, Initiative, LAWN and Bastion on the other side.
---
yeah, and that was actually a pretty good sided fight.  keeping in mind originally CO2 was on Imperium's side.  the sides were fairly even.  then CO2 defected,  and more joined the war.  and yet Imperium still fought well, as they were the big entity at the time, so you need alot to go against them  (unlike now where its the big plus more vs a smaller)
---
&gt;Who is left that NC and Panfam have not driven away. Now take away those decisions and put goons in Delve. The picture that is painted would be pretty grim for goons.
---
if i recall, GOTG drove Panfam away by desciding to make deals on behalf of Panfam, instead of just itself.   when it did that, and claimed ot have authority over panfam to make deals on their behalf, and without consulting them on top of that, well. it was a huge insult.  they dug their own grave.
---
Yeah, maybe they are. But they don't run and they we're not crying un redit about serenty 2.0 or blueball or else, like some pro elite mega super hyper pvper Coalition that i know.
---
XD
---
What if you just print them "donate" them and we can "donate" the materials 😉
---
Snuffed and Test are both Goon allies. Code isn't really significant in nullsec.
---
Corrected, thanks. Absolutely the wrong abbreviation.
---
Did you start before or after they reshuffled?  I'm guessing before in which case, F.
---
The Imperium (goons) is the largest coalition in the game and Legacy is the second largest (Test). Although they are the two largest coalitions in the game, they are blue to each other. Although Panfam are much smaller than the Imperium and Legacy, they are just as scary, hence why the 2 largest coalitions blue each other to survive. It's a balancing act, except the Imperium and Legacy don't have a way to kill Panfam.
---
I mean,  you could turn the question around and ask the same thing. Goons said they'd twist the knife after b-r but ended the hellcamp 3 days later.
---
Fighting an enemy already on their knees isn't fun for either side. And following them around certainly isn't good for the game.
---
Oh you completely miss the point again. They're not cowards for relying on super caps.   
---
They're cowards because they(FRT/TRI/NC./BL/GotG/Pl/NC./SkillU/Volta/Horde) only went to war thinking it was an easy win. And they backed out the moment it was not easy anymore. That's why they are cowards.

---
Goons were heavily camped into Saranen for like... a month. But with Empire space mechanics, good/bad/otherwise, it's extremely difficult to exterminate any group determined enough to wait it out. The MBC was also NOT a permanent coalition, but rather a very large group of smaller coalitions brought together by isk and the smell of blood in the water. When either of those two things dried up, (and when PL started walking in acting like they were responsible for it) alot of groups started bleeding off. WWB didn't start in null sec, it started with the low sec Denizens banding together and stopping the CFC Viceroy program, then pushing back. Nowadays, most those low sec groups are gone, folded into others, or in wormholes.
---
Avatar conga line. Nice.
---
hold me
---
Different strokes for different folks. In saying that, I do look forward to the inevitable "why didn't you undock" splurging from the Imperium and TAPI. Just if we in Panfam actually needed our space like The Imperium.... then maybe we'd care about it haha.
---
How was it backstabbing? Once WWB ended most of the alliances involved reset their standing to pre-WWB state.
---
The only alliance to actually back stab would have been Snuff's red wedding for SC.
---
Yeah ok well my point is that there was still a shitton of things to theorycraft and test. We were still in the dark about a good number of things with a pretty high amount of practice and some pretty good theorycrafters. 
---
Pretty much everyone figured out putting a drake with a cerb was a decent idea, but actually flying that correctly, fitting it correctly and knowing every matchup/situations, plus doing that 9 more times was a hell of a task. 
---
The actual ships was the most obvious and ultimately the easiest part for the most part. I think there was plenty of depth to go around after that.
---
consider what you just said with a bit more perspective. "IF PanFam are alone." Like, its preposterous to think that NC/PL Horde and waffles, all competent groups, all together aren't enough and its their fault. 
---
Blaming an entire family of alliances for "being alone" undercuts the fact that its already a large group of competent independent groups already. Why does it have to be that every war is half of eve vs the other half? Its been the natural course of games and has been partly driven by CCPs changes, but I think the overwhelming majority of the non-goon portion of the game all believe this is for the worse.
---
... my memory is failing me. I remember MBC being a thing but who did it consist of?
---
Us living up to our agreements isnt some propaganda, we are known for living up to our word.  Are there examples out there where we failed sure there are but we are known for living up to our word.  Ask GOTG after the end of the last war or TEST when they came down to Catch.  You may not like it, but it is our reputation.  Whereas NC and PL are known for breaking their word, that is their reputation.
---
That's a somewhat silly query since you don't put an end date on it and the query will always return killmails descending.  I thought I had something in place requiring a starttime and endtime when one or the other is given. Guess I'll have to check that, thank you for pointing it out.
---
Anyhow, the return on that query is quite acceptable imo. A few seconds isn't horrible considering the what you're querying as well as the size and load the database is under. I'm sure you'll have some suggestions to help of course.
---
Money Badger was during WWB. Panfam, MC, GOTG, TAPI, Snuff, misc. randoms.
---
Literally everyone not Goons.
---
Words words words words words words Words words words words words words Words words words words words words Words words words words words words Words words words words words words TWAT!!!!
---

---
(Merkel isnt a human)
---
Could we just have a yet unheard of NPC faction cyno in during the largest super fight and annihilate both sides?
---
That would be the best outcome.
---
Agreed, in practice it doesn't make sense.  It was a "proof-of-concept" run to see if the API shared filters with regular.  I didn't want to knock down the database, so I thought I should ask.
---
Guess it's time to set up a spreadsheet and start pulling kill counts.
---
&gt;Us living up to our agreements isnt some propaganda
---
oh i not disagreeing with that in this case, but you can't honestly say you haven't betrayed alliances or deals in the past.   heck Goons is still known for their old reputation of recruitment scams (despite all groups doing that, goons are known for it)
---
&gt;I didnt perceive GOTG ending the last war on behalf of the entire north was them telling you what to do
---
should also look into what the feeling to GOTG was at that point.
---
keep in mind after CO2 fought to the end to defend GOTG, they were rewarded with GOTG banning them from staging from GOTG keepstars.  screwing CO2 and forcing them to leave the war entirely.
---
and then within the hour of that, NCPL and Horde caps were ordered to redeploy out of all GOTG keepstars to NC keepstars in order to avoid GOTG screwing us like they did CO2.
---
GOTG fked their allies first, and broke all trust.
---
the only one that "went to war" was PL. No other entity was trying to evict you, again show me a sov timer with them on. 
---
- NC: did not have their supers staged for this invasion and their subcaps helping pl was the closest thing to trying to "go to war". 
---
- Tri: showed up for the ks because dinos were activelly helping xix to kill them, talk about cowardice am i right. And they lived close so their supers were somewhat close as well.
---
- skillu (which volta was part of, good to know you know your history): showed up for the ks because you were helping and housing xix, and because they had their supers nearby. 
---
- BL: Not a single titan or super on the br, just fucking munnins lmao. 
---
- GotG:lol
---
- FRT: dinos were trying to evict them themselves so yeah, pretty rich to grandstand there.
---
- horde: they didn't even deploy their supers for the ks, let alone for some mystical eviction coalition.
---
honest question, do you get your info just from morale posts?
---
We tried. TEST deployed to UHKL-N to pursue Goons at the end of WWB. PGL, for all of his derpiness, correctly called what was going to happen if we didn't finish the job.
---
Instead of joining us, our Moneybadger "allies" NCPL attacked while we were deployed and eventually evicted us and CO2 in the Tribute War. Then followed and continued to harass us when we moved south and fought against Goons/Red Alliance/Stainwagon to carve out our current territory.
---
Fuck NCPL. We told you morons this would happen.
---
People were burned out honestly. 
---
It’s all well and good to say, just camp us forever. 
---
But In all honesty goons as an organisation and the imperium in general we’re in no real danger of breaking up or failscading. Most people who left only contributed via taxes. 
---
The leadership and members on both sides  were burned out after months of war and content denial. The FCs and line members are real people with real life jobs and commitments that can only be put off for the sake of a game for so long. 
---
The members of MBC were content to have won and reap the rewards of the space they had taken. On top of it being made of several groups that were traditionally hostile towards each other. 
---
Goons/imperium whatever else you may think about them or their actions you can’t deny their strength when it comes to logistics and organisation. It’s run better than most real life military organisations in that respect. 
---
All of that has been dedicated for 3 years to insuring that the previous defeat could not be repeated and while we were doing that everyone else was busy ignoring us / squabbling amongst themselves.
---
\&gt;except the Imperium and Legacy don't have a way to kill Panfam. 
---
Goons don't need to be blue to us to wipe the floor with Panfam and Panfam only have themselves to blame for their upcoming misfortunes.
---
rl job = rl money
---
eve job = eve money
---
but i retired at eve 4y ago, got enought iskeritos for plexing my accounts 10+ years.
---
Drink some more koolaid. You have no idea how ironic your bullshit is.
---
NCPL on their own were never a match for GOONS. They were part of a massive coalition that was bankrolled by 1 guy. That 1 guy got banned and NCPL had a bunch of great regions, so there wasn't a whole lot of reason to want to chase GOONS across the entire map playing wack-a-mole.
---
You get a job.
---
Yeah, any day now someone is going to start the multi-year siege to burn Delve.
---
We blued up with Goons because you blued up with Fraternity, Black Legion, Skill Urself, and Triumverate to evict us. You really must be new.
---
oh?  you saying TEST is ready to be independent again?  and not call on Goons ot bail you out of every major engagement?
---
good,   though i'd prefer to hear it from someone i trust, like anyone in BRAVE.
---
Sweet! Where you out of?!
---
Most of the rest of the srv don't want Goons domination, but don't like NC either.
---
NCPL is the best Goons propaganda.
---
He just listed the buttons on the other side of that console that weren’t pictured.  Showed he knew exactly what that console is for.
---
Poses (not pos sov warfare pre-dominion) were a good example of being able to create somewhat ok timers with the stront timing. Make an above average effort in an off time zone to hit it when they are not expecting and create a decent follow up timer if they are not able to restront in time.
---
NC is part of NCPL
---
Frat wasn't that big then,  keep in mind they didn't gain a proper cap/super fleet until you gave them 6 months of uninterrupted time ot grow
---
Black Legion....so 100 people?
---
Skill Urself, actually no one invited them...they kinda join when they want.   i remember coms were freaking out with people seeing neuts, and then people saying "looks like they with us"
---
there were some friendly fire before hte FCs realized they were with us on this.....it was funny.
---
Tri...seriously? not exactly big.
---
It is. NC forged what is coming to them
---
It certainly was a better system than what we have today.
---
I'm not sure I'd call this art, but there have been some amazing posts on both the forums and Reddit, like this one: https://forums.eveonline.com/t/my-friend-needs-clothes/4491
---
&gt; It’s run better than most real life military organisations in that respect.
---
Most military organisations run with the efficiency of a double amputee epileptic toddler with a heart arrhythmia.
---
Sure, when you stop calling NCPL to bail you out of every major engagement.
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
The only way to eliminate them is to eliminate the goonfleet.com.  Would need to be a huge scotch bribe.
---
    
---
seriously, huge.
---
I remember PGL was the one calling for a Delve push and help out LUMPY. There was minimal appetite with the remaining MBC forces. Fatigue hit both the attacker and defender. Imperium taking cover in NPC stations made it impossible to kill them. 
---
If they were on top before WWB, nothing stopped them from doing it again if allowed to build up.
---
NCPL is part of the same coalition as us.   PANFAM.
---
we don't call FRAT to save us, aka a different coalition
---
but you call Imperium to save you, aka a different coalition
---
&gt;and had it just been NCPL vs Test,  it would have been just another normal war in EVE,  and in the aftermath, the status quo would have been null as normal.
---
Dude, you blued up half the map to come fight us. You really think we're going to just roll over? Fuck you guys, now live with your mistake.
---
How do you open a freight package???
---
when I try ans take stuff out, get this
---
Can't do that in a mission package.
---
oh wow how surprising is this, NCPL betraying their ally to later on add another brick in the wall of their own defeat, thanks for their ass move over the last 3 years they have now no allies and have GOTG+LEGACY working with the Imperium
---
co2 coming to help GOTG was the worst thing that could ever happen in the eyes of Goons.  It ensured we would never leave until we won, they should have stayed as far away from Goons as they possibly could.  You don't understand the real animosity Goons feel for them after what they did, it is one of the true vendettas in my eve career to see that alliance die.
---
Are there diplomatic agreements out there we have broken sure just as there are agreements out there that PL and NC have stuck to.  But for the most part we stick to them unless given a reason not to, and NCPL are known for not sticking to them.
---
54 alliance paid by I want isk to destroy Goons
---
I tried making a list for the TEST historical wiki and shit, it got long. Still incomplete too.
---
Imperium and Legacy are also part of the same coalition. You can't hide behind the one and decry the other.
---
I'm clearly thinking of HBC then.
---
Goonswarm isn't just ships and structures, it's an idea.
---
It's really hard to completely destroy an idea.
---
There’s already a Goonswarm based alliance I think, but it isn’t doing too well.
---
I would not blame them for it tbh, you can't really kill an alliance even if you follow them around bashing them whenever you can (pretty much what goons do with NCPL right now) 
---
I would blame their leadership for never adapting to the current meta. Over the last 3 years they worked on a narrative that would fit better than just telling to their member "get a rorq and mine all the day to build supers/titan" instead we went from "goons are dead" to "goons are only PVE alliance" to "don't worry MER means nothing all of that goes to jita/RMT" to "Goons never go to war so it doesn't matter" to "lol goons are shit look hakonen" to "lol goons never commit" to "Global Tell All Your Faction Titans to..."
---
downvote because of bad battle report
---
&gt; some mystical eviction coalition.
---
Mate, stop denying things that happened. There was a coalition. not everyone brought super, yet their supers and titans still outnumbered legacy's. even if you include NC. and goons incoming titans.   
---
Also, you're quoting the UALX BR because they was the only real fight, after which panfam gave up.
---
I only get obsurd loading times with undocking. Dont notoce it with logging in.

But some days il undock and be like almost at the docking ring of a medium structure before I can actually see anything. Been progressively getting worse also.

You can also see if a library in your area has one you can use, mine in Fort Worth had a few ones available for free for anyone to come and use

I work in a small crew out of St. Pete, Florida. TD, edits, videography all the fun stuff.
---
The first time I undock after logging in. Then it's fine
---
I can definitely see where you're coming from...but I don't think this is an answer. At all. It's got too much potential for abuse, and it gives an advantage to certain TZs and groups (like your own) over others. A couple things:
---
(1) My main issue is that this gives an unfair advantage to certain world regions over others. During EUTZ, North Americans are still at work - so there's no chance to push off the attackers trying to utilize your space in your off time zone. The opposite is not true though. It's easy to ask EU players to stay up a bit later to defend against USTZ invaders trying to change their timers, but North Americans would have to actually take time off of work to defend during EUTZ. Why should players be punished for the TZ they live in? 
---
(2) This mechanic plays heavily in favor of the group you're representing (imperium) because, as the largest group in the game, N+1 mechanics work strongly in your favor. There aren't enough small engagements? Maybe your blue donut is too fucking bloated. 
---
(3) EU groups in some areas of EVE also have far greater numbers - so it'll be easy for them to move the defenders' vulnerability to their own time. Why should these groups be allowed to N+1 strong-arm the timers of smaller groups over to their own TZ when the defenders can't be available? 
---
(4) It already takes 7 days to re-time your structures. Are you telling me in a week you've not been able to Reinforce them? On the other hand if they see you coming and preempt your attack seven days in advance by switching their timers, that sounds to me like you didn't maintain Opsec well enough and they used a legitimate game mechanic to outsmart the attackers. 7 days is a long time. I'm 100% ok with that.
---
The current mechanic of forcing you to bring your coalition has a positive effect: it balances out time zone differences. Yes, having time zone coverage is effort - but what it means is you end up with US vs. US in USTZ, EU vs. EU in EUTZ, and AU vs. AU in AUTZ. To me that's fair and balanced.
---
&gt; moves into their renting space without being a renter
---
&gt; wow they're blobbing us those meanies
---
i mean there's quite a lot to dislike about nc, but if this is what makes the best goon propaganda then i'm sorry to say that this is what they'll do to you if you go to delve or whatever surrounding areas.
---
Finishing cruise missile V so I can finally use T2 launchers /ammo on my alt, and probably chip away at some level V scanning skills on my main, those take forever.
---
Not denying that, it was really fun and there was a lot to play with, I'm just saying that being able to pick the hulls to some extent would have added another layer to it.
---
We enjoyed it a lot, I hope they make another similar tournament soonish.
---
Somebody watched V for Vendetta today

Honestly I just want a system where if you reinforce something in a constellation it locks the entire constellation from changing timezones.

This will come in quite handy! thank you....

This was my time to Delve, goons sure rolled out the welcome mat, hope they are just as welcoming in the future :P
---
Goons have the stamina of someone suffering premature ejaculation. All these ships yet they still cant win
---
I reached my first long term goal a few months ago when I finally trained marauders V for my Kronos pilot. 
---
My new goals are all scanning skills to V and a stock of over one million varied fireworks. When I hit a million, I'll raise the goal.
---
Wow classic
---
Maybe so. But you only need 300 die hards out of the massive number of members.
---
&gt; Mate, stop denying things that happened.
---
i'm not denying anything that happened, just those that didn't :&gt;
---
&gt; Also, you're quoting the UALX BR because they was the only real fight
---
so the only "real" fight in the war to evict you was a fight unrelated to any sov mechanic? really makes you think doesn't it hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
why i still do this is a mystery tbh, you nerds are a lost cause.
---
Can't forget the Jay Amazingness Moros kill
---
&gt;It's got too much potential for abuse.
---
The only way to abuse it would be to use your enemies space yourself, which would mean they are letting you live in their home, in which case they don't deserve to keep it.
---
This is on Sisi, they're moving it around.
---
Nice. I hadn't thought of checking on that!
---
Right, but it's easy for euros to live in US space while the Americans are at work. Whereas euros can stay up later to shoo them off. It doesn't treat all regions fairly.

\&gt; This game desperately needs more attackers, it needs more fights, but to get those the people who sacrifice their time and effort to make this happen need to know they aren’t just wasting their time.

C.

Where was your concern about timezone tanking when other people's wars had to deal with it, ie TEST vs FRT or PH vs GOTG?
---
\--------
---
You didn't 'delay the war 4 months' because you had to be around in AUtz. Goons AUtz already outnumbers Panfam's. You timed the war to now because you need goons to resub as many accounts as possible for the upcoming CSM elections. If they don't resub their cap/super alts, they can't move and they'll 'miss out' - so everyone subs back. This is made even more obvious by the bizarre decision to move shield supers too. Armor supers numbers were clearly more than sufficient and using shield supers to defend delve had worked great in the past during a deployment. But of course those extra shield super alts are the most likely to be dormant accounts and if you do not announce that shields need to move too, they have no reason to sub back.
---
Ultimately the issue you bring up is a key one which many of us support, but the dishonest way in which you bring it up detracts from the message.
---
Yea good luck with waterboarded tidifest structure bashes.
---
&gt; so the only "real" fight in the war to evict you was a fight unrelated to any sov mechanic
---
Yes, that's exactly what happened. There was an announcement to evict TEST. A fight broke out over an anchoring keepstar. After said battle, the attacking forces moved back home and did not press their attack.  
---
Denying that the TRI/panfam/FRT aligned forces were not there to evict TEST, because the fight was over a keepstar and not a sov mechanic is some retarded level of backpedalling.
---
Supers are the only thing that matter though.  All of those without PL supers coming south had us somewhere around a parity of numbers.  PL coming south put us at a real disadvantage.  Fortunately it also triggered a mutual defense pact with the imperium, and it ended with your side humiliated on both fronts.
---
Invoking that mutual defense pact also got us comfortable enough with each other to use our superfleets side by side, and it turns out imperial legacy is an unassailable hegemon.  
---
The north did the stupidest thing they possibly could by driving out alliance after alliance.  Now you are at a point where you are so weak you just evac a region rather than defend it.

I mean weren't you crying about how your mighty alliance failed to make any progress in Branch for over a month because of that?

Plenty of people have complained about TZ tanking over the years, it's not something new.

Funny. I could say the same about you and your attempts at spinning.

The argument euro's can just stay up late is often put to the table and I suspect it's from american selection biased most of the Europeans you speak to work late, because often there playing at 4/5 AM if there in the middle of NA TZ now realize how often can you stay up until 5 AM wake up at 7 before it becomes a problem with work?

Did you not know this is a shit post? Its comprised of shit.

If timers were USTZ you would only deploy Reavers then?
---
Reset the cache, helps with a lot.
---
The only time they get to use their supers is when every other Goons super is on grid
---
100% yes. Not like against someone giant like Test or Horde, we can't punch in that weight class, but against someone with 2-3x bigger fleets than us that would be ideal.
---
We keep the masses entertained
---
Ah here we go, another topic with TAPI members crying about perceived injustices.

North will fight in Tribute more than TAPI fought for Vale, don't worry about us. Worry about the fact that you're Imperium's only viable target after this.

I borrowed the only laptop I could from work. It was used as a time clock for payroll until it was vandalized, it takes 20 minutes to load up the Eve character select screen

Corp activities, open comms mining fleets, tons of strat-ops, roams and op-sec sigs to do kinky things.

Those mechanisms are indeed force multipliers, as well as webs or painters, but those mechanisms... multiply any size of force, so it widens the absolute difference between a small and a big group.

---
So your timers are in USTZ? Or you changed them? You changed them, like everyone does.
---
&gt;You timed the war to now because you need goons to resub as many accounts as possible for the upcoming CSM elections.
---
I've heard you floating this theory but I thought it was just a fun thing to rile your guys up with, not that you actually believed it. LOL. 
---
Mittens said "let me know when you're ready". I told him I was ready a few weeks ago. That's literally the entire discussion we had about timing.
---
Of course Jay but did they bring it up or make it a priority to warn the devs about? I don't remember seeing that in the minutes. To my disappointment because, like Asher, I've always maintained that tz tanking is one of the biggest issues with the flow of content right now.
---
However if you are aware that they did and I missed it, then I will happily stand corrected.

&gt; Denying that the TRI/panfam/FRT aligned forces were not there to evict TEST, because the fight was over a keepstar and not a sov mechanic is some retarded level of backpedalling.
---
you see, I don't have to prove that they weren't there to evict test, proving a negative is an awfully complicated matter, you however do need to prove they were there to do it tho.
---
all those entities were close to test (sans nc. and pl), they had some real justifiable problems with test and a ks killmail was just standing there. The important part of evicting someone, you know actually taking the sov, wasn't even touched on apart from pl(shocker right).
---
if you are too dense to understand those simple concepts don't even bother replying, for I won't.
---
I agree with that, but in your post it's put like you're being forced to bring your entire coalition because timers are AUTZ, not because they're too big/have too many supers for one sig.
---
Yes, from NPC delve.
---
A lot of people like the industrial side of this game, it's very deep and amazing to think that every ship and module was mined and manufactured by someone. This is a result of what those industrialists have accomplished.
---
I guess technically, webs and painters are actually less effective with a larger force, just because they get the stacking penalty, but that really does not mean much when you have superior numbers, just a thought though.
---
Are you sure you're counting right?
---
But at least acknowledge that it is a fortuitous coincidence right? 1 week earlier and the accounts would have had to sub for a second cycle in order to be Omega on the first day of elections.
---
Obligatory goons and test are not blue
---
Good post. I've thought about the flaws a lot. Obviously there is no perfect system but right now the system is being used by Goons forming a super blob because it's the only way for us to get a fight. When was the last time NC seriously attacked someone? The Casino War with a giant blob. 
---
We already are in a state that benefits N+1. It's my strong belief that this system is no more abusable than the current system, and is probably actually less. There isn't a gameplay system I can think of that can effectively break up the current blobs but I'd rather have a system where goon SIGs are fighting, and Test sigs are fighting, and GOTG is fighting, and PL is fighting. I think that's possible and preferable. 
---
For point 3, I think you underestimate how hard it is to go into someone's space and rat in it for a week or two. if you're doing that you are out there, you're fightable, you're bombable, you're interdictable. It means they've come to your space and put themselves on the line. It's better than the current system. 
---
For point 4, no with cyno jammers 7 days isn't near enough. Have you ever seen a 7 day campaign in Eve?
---
that's usually a once or twice per campaign move max.
---
Because number #2 coalition are pets to Imperium and are a PvE alliance.
---
A  question mark in your inflammatory headline tells me you are not independent New Eden reporters ;)
---
I literally have no idea. If that's the case than cool, I don't mind us having more votes. It had nothing to do with it. I don't think about CSM elections at all but sorry if we've hurt your chances or whatever.
---
With force multipliers what you multiply is the effective of the whole fleet, not the force of your other force multipliers.
---
For instance, lets assume we have one painter and it multiplies the damage of an arti machariel on a muninn by 1.2. 
---
If you gang consists on 1 painter and 10 machariels you will have the equivalent of 12 machariel with 11 guys in fleet (one extra guy). 
---
If your fleet consists on 1 painter and 100 machariels you will have the equivalent of 120 machariels with 101 guys in fleet (19 extra guys).
---
That's why I say it will *always* benefit more a bigger group.
---
There's no SIG that could fight NCdot. But the timing of the invasion was 100% affected by the fact that you can change the timer anytime.
---
Thier decisions are why Serenity is happening now and not 3 years ago. The bad decision that TEST keeps crying about is why didn't they permanently blue up WWB.
---
You think it's a problem so you make a post arguing against it cause I made it? :thinking:
---
Oh, I've waited so long for those amaizng blops fleets to get back on track. Let's make a record on this month's excav kills.
---
&gt; TAPI fought in Vale
---
Funny you bring up that war.
---
If you had any balls, you'd attempt to hold tribute and defend your structures like TEST and CO2 did against supercap superiority. We had some good fights defending those ihubs.
---
So did your army of CSMs bring it up or not? I can't find it in the minutes.
---
If only there was an internet relay chat system that has been proven reliable for 30some years.
---
"We want gudfites" "we couldn't 3x blob all TZs, wut do, bad CCP" "I dunno wut is GSM"
---
Made you form!!! Goons just have to announce war and NC starts self destructing assets.
---
It looks like they got to loot the field, therefore they won. ^/s
---
You guys realise those systems have npc stations right?
---
i wont disagree.   it is.
---
however,  its not 1 coalition right now.  its just Imperium and Legacy.
---
when they merge, then we can call it best name
---
Those dirty blobbers with their 5-10 person nanogang 😠
---
You sir are not wrong!
---
Gobbins knows his ABCs. I think that's about all he knows.
---
Mate.. If you get invited to, and join the coordinated attack to evict someone. You're also evicting them.  
---
The point you're making is useless.
---
Co2 did, TEST assisted them with Tribute, but not in Vale. You packed it all up and left.
---
I appreciate you guys giving our home defence pilots some killmails. =P
---
Hi Dino, Depending on the map, NPC stations can be bubble camped.
---
lol I love it, NC is the only thing in the way of a 'bad game'
---
NC eviction starts today. Karma
---
yeah  happens to me every time, eve is dogshit
---
If it wasn't so easy to project power, maybe the timers wouldn't be an issue that can't be changed.
---
I'm aware. It's just funny hearing the same things again years later.  
---
If you're newer to the game, the undock button used to be over the clock in the neocom bar. The complaints about "God damn it, I never remember they moved the fucking undock button" lasted for months.
---
More then ever, Eve need more ballsy leaders who don't blue up forever.
---
shoot first is garbo
---
This may surprise you but :spoiler; goons outnumber the north massively. Anyone expecting a fight here is delusional, even mittani knows it so has to ‘hype’ it by pretending that Panfam is still a threat; ‘pretend we didn’t win any of the wars before’. The truth is that the imperium is so big that there’s no-one who can fight the 450 titans, 300 supers that moved initially yesterday. Congrats to goons on out blobbing everyone in eve, this is what ‘winning’ feels like; blue balls and no fights, enjoy the war.
---
Haha, time or energy, I work 45 hours with 2 kids and a wife that makes too many plans. You make time for Eve. xD
---
I put in a support ticket a week ago and still haven't got a response.
---
If he's in the same boat I am, he would need the event to end at 21.05.2019 to get the 1m SP.
---
In the interest of progress, Asher,  can you nudge GSM about it?
---
I sent CCP a support ticket hoping to get an answer for my alt account, but they haven't responded in a whole week.
---
Lost 2 hours of my time.
---
Gained a VERY green killboard and 20mill in loot. Luckily goons started shooting their own wrecks, so we left.
---
Were you saying the same thing when NCPL were doing the same to everyone else?
---
Or is it only a problem now that Goons are doing it?
---
Can't wait to see the Delve B-team home defense squad welp some shit while the men are away on deployment
---
You may have Dwarven history
---
Was at work all day and I missed it unfortunately. Ah, me
---
&gt;So your timers are in USTZ? Or you changed them? You changed them, like everyone does.
---
Of course he did. When SV deployed, he changed their timers to USTZ. When SV left and liberty squad arrived, they changed their timers to EUTZ.
---
Gobbins, even though he likes to pretend he isn't, is just a hypocrite at the end of the day.
---
While I would recommend having an alt or 2 with decent scanning skills logged off in the hole, this is mostly so that if the entire Corp gets rolled out (on accident or on purpose) you can get back into your hole.  These characters can easily be the bare minimum to sit in an astero or even alpha toons.  For normal every day chain scanning using your main is perfectly viable.
---
[sov.space](sov.space) shows coalitions, not relationships between them though sadly
---
there's going to be so many move ops there is no reason to jam all the alt moves into day one, its always a shitshow and trying to fly multiple characters is just a pain when the server is having a hard time and the move op is that large.
---
I hope you've read Jester's AMA, he paints a rather different picture of how much CCP is willing to indulge the CSM.
---
&gt;They have been growing because PL is shit, horde has no security and NC. is the only other viable option.
---
FTFY
---
*hurr durr they aren't blue on my overview so they must not be blue!!11!1!*
---
this is the most Pepega shit I see on /r/Eve 
---
Yeah, you aren't blue, but you work together on large ops, defend each other, and wouldn't dare touch each other's sov. you're only neutral so that the line members can feel like you two are neutral when they lose a ratting vni to some goon retri fleet.
---
yep, this has been a problem since 2016, there's no fix, CCP doesn't give a shit.
---
I made boosters when it was illegal to carry them through high sec. That is no longer the case, so I am sure prices have changed.
---
I would fly around to all the stations in Gallente militia space and sell boosters 20 at a time. The idea was to get people who wanted boosters immediately and didn't have their own stockpile.
---
Now that you can buy a bunch in Jita for about 30-40% less than what I sold them for, I am unsure if it's still as profitable.
---
But, there may still be people in lowsec who don't want to bother flying to jita and will buy boosters where they live.
---
/r/eve mods should add a category to the yearly 'best of' post for 'cringiest poster' so that gobbins can finally win something
---
Glad to hear it. The wrecks do look cool.
---
Good lord dude, put some pain medicine on your ass.
---
Changing to EUTZ timers when liberty is there, but not mentioning welp squad? Really makes you think
---
Pretty underrated comment IMO.
---
&gt; coalition was not smaller than TEST's (coalition)
---
&gt;goon supercaps landed on grid
---
one or the other
---
We’ll see if their deployment winds down after the votes are in ;)
---
He's a troll, don't bother.
---
D-D-D-D-D-Docking request accepted
---
I don't get it. I must need to be inside the goon spin train to understand wtf they are trying to claim or talk about in this.
---
&gt; Imperium's only viable target after this.
---
yeah i really dont understand the current TEST cheer leading. unless they are planning a surprise invasion while goons are deployed north.
---
how does the third largest group being destroyed help their political situation? perhaps they plan to recruit refugees.
---
The point of discussion is whether this concern was raised by CSM to CCP.
---
Doesn't traveling to escalations suck though? Unless you are blue with a lot of people in Stain.
---
Hey man, believe whatever spin machine you want to believe. You make it sound like test will join goons war against the North or by comparison goons will join war against frat. Both are simply false. In your words, 
---
Hurr durr they won't claim each other's sov so that means tapi is goons bitch.  
---
Get the fuck over it and go make your own content
---
lmfao I love it
---
goons and test are allied, won’t be surprised when you guys deploy north as well

---
&gt; stomp pandemic horde and test alliance right?
---
eventually yes. TEST, for some reason, aren't expecting it to be soon.
---
All these "core systems" make me wonder - what if sovereign alliances had the option to (temporarily) name systems if they developed them long enough?
---
i.e goons could call 1DQ "Mittengrad" or whatever
---
Balling up on-grid is different to balling up across New Eden. 
---
Don't confuse the two.

yeah i wonder how many will bother jumping once they realise the destination is outside the umbrella.

Tethering. Because blood diamond rats can be a bitch.

Olmeca gold will always hold the record lol. Him and his army of alts.

Some people dont want to own 20 rorquals, and mine like crazy for hours...and hours... They dont want to turn this in to their second Jobs or Life. And the "bitter vets" you are talking about, those people have played the game for like 10+ years and for them RL has changed, they grow up...have RL obligations (family, kids, whatever) and cant possibly dedicate 6h a day rorqual mining like some school kid or someone that has fuck all to do.
---
How exactly are they to adopts? How is it their fault that 70% (or more, not sure its the exact number, someone correct me if its not) of the game is blue to each other. What influence do those people (regular joe) have over decisions made by Init, TAPI, SNUFF, (insert, rest of the blue donut here)?
---
The goons spin is strong in you. For reference look at the history of serenity...
---
At the end this whole BS will have stop, cuz the blue donut will realise this in not good for the game, or at least one can hope.
---
In the mean time i'm polishing my guns, ready for battle... :D
---
I mean eve has been slowly reducing the loss of equipment over the past few years

Unfortunately there is no completed MP/MMO game that has that functionality at the current time, and with studios turning away from the MMO Genre, I doubt we will for some time
---
By "Delve B-team" you mean Test?
---
Your BR tool is asscancer. Stop trying to make it a thing.
---
haven't had any issues, have you done a traceroute to see if its an issue with your ISP, circuit, etc?
---
Due to their superiour training in the fine art of ninjalooting, the brave hordelings pillaged the field while the goons where reshipping. The goons took a field consisting of empty wrecks.
---
Nah they started a few days ago in anticipation
---
Ooft I want that Barghest one.
---
The more you kill the more crabs we get to make fun of for dying.
---
That sort of is what he was saying. If just reavers attacks the other group even if a US based group sets timers to AUTZ and the campaign ends. If the whole coalition comes now they have some coverage in all time zones and the US based defender would be stupid to re-time to AUTZ.
---
Even a large group like horde has done this to avoid losing morale to smaller groups that continually harass certain areas.
---
It also provided a much needed stront sink. *Gazes at 11 million m3 of stront*
---
At least we can ship spin while we get blue balled....oh wait nearly all my alts are in supers/titans, guess I can spin some faxes....
---
Day 1 without Super cap umbrella
---
Yikes Tapi brain
---
who?
---
oh please this situation has nothing to do with ncpl being dicks or whatever, it's 100% game mechanics. Pretending nothing changed in the game to kill some playstyles and prop up others is just silly.
---
C. Perhaps I'm unaware of GOTGs primary time zone but I thought it was AUTZ, was them using Thier own time zone really your example of time zone tanking or did they switch it? Same thing for frat, China vs US based, did either actually time zone tank outside Thier natural activity?
---
If you plan on moon mining, and dont have a refinery with a rig&amp;good/max reprocessing skills, youre gonna hate your life. Also look into the specific moon goo that your moon has. I personally dont put a moon down on anything under thr higher R16s, R32s/R64s are what i normally look for. 
---
I would also look at where youre mining. I found a quiet pocket, scanned moons, found the ones i liked, then worked to removing the structures on it and placing my own. 
---
If you have a good active corp itll be a breeze, but solo/small corps may uave an issue with it. 
---
Hulks didnt really get a hardcore nerf, but the rorqual got a pretty sizable nerf to mining amount, and a buff to boosting. 
---
Idk if i missed anything but if you have any questions, shoot me a PM and ill try and answer them
---
That definitely makes more sense when you put it in a simple mathematical example. Now I guess what smaller fleets would need is not so much force multipliers (as this clearly can be exploited further with larger groups than smaller), but possibly a force divider. I don't know what tools there are in the game that even have that potential.
---
Like I guess weapon and targeting disruptive Ewar could technically do that, but it does not effect the entire other fleet, I guess a Boosh that divides half the other fleet would sort of work, but only for a short amount of time, and maybe something ridiculous in practice like burst jammers would work like that.
---
But yeah, I can't really think of anything that makes it so a small fleet can gain an advantage over a bigger one, at least in terms of utility things.
---
Ive been on fleets where the FC will say "(insert alliance that is red) is friendly, dont shoot them", and magically we dont shoot them. I mean its slightly annoying, but its easy to keep fleets seperated on thr overview
---
Afaik, olmeca gold steals the excavs, we'll go for blood.
---
Pretty sure the guy with the most isk lost is either the dude that lost a komodo, a dude that lost a AT ship, or that one dude that lost like 6 titans
---
CCP is retarded and allowed structures into the game that are so difficult to incap its almost not worth it.
---
Smaller entities were fucking PISSED at the cynojammer changes announced at Eve Vegas and yet the response from the larger entities was collectively HTFU. Now we're seeing people finally understand how shitty they are compared to the pre-FLEX system and its great, but i doubt CCP will change course.
---
Literally an FC of the largest coalition in EVE whining about TZ timers, you’re telling me you couldn’t bang enough spodbrains together to come up with AUTZ fleets? This entire thing reads like an enormous amount of whining - AND - if this change were to be implemented it would not hinder the goon coalition in the slightest and simultaneously create lots of targets for goon sigs to hit.
---
I don’t disagree that TZ tanking is shit but holy FUCK is this transparent.
---
Spot on analysis of the problem, but this solution only addresses sov null alliances that regularly pve in their own space and leaves a big question mark for everyone else.
---
To take an example you probably first hand experience with, how would this work for LSH/White Sky? They're a single tz group that lives in low sec and hardly if ever pves on in alliance characters.
---
By that same argument its easier for USTZ to live in EU timezone space by also just staying up late and forcing the EUTZ to choose going to work and letting them live there or playing eve.
---
All of my ISK exists to make -more- isk through market PVP and also fund countless reckless losses in PVP.
---
Nailed it.
---
There wont be any more wars in Eve Online. Sry to dissapoint you.

before he started stealing them, he bombed them. either over 500 or 1k. not sure anymore

You realize that if we just sent AUTZ people only they would retime to USTZ or EUTZ, right? That's the whole point of this post. We *have* to bring everyone.

In 2007 I set the goal of owning and operating a Nyx supercapital. I watched through the years, jealous of others already in them, through the Mom days, golden days, and after everything I recently got one. Now I need to find some way to use it, since my alliance doesn't really let me 😂
---
I like combat probes because when people see "Sisters Combat Scanner Probe" on dscan they think Tengu or Loki and not Helios. Makes it easy to spook people away.
---
TEST tried when they first moved. The rest of MBC decided to declare victory and go home, and eventually kill TEST. People get mad that TEST and goons buddied up but so be it.

Yeah I know. That is true.

I was for years in different militias. Most interesting fights I got was always against neutrals/pirates. I don't understand this "neutral idiot" thing. Nowdays you can even fix sec status with isk.

They are excellent content for fw players because they are not intrested in running plexes so you are more likely to get pvp against them. Enemy fw players might just escape from you and try to sneak LP from plexes.

I mean it's not hard to get a character into goons and buy a titan.But imo the move through lowsec part is a pain in the ass not worth it

Oh yeah for sure, that's a your own alliance space or wormhole space only thing. Doing it in enemy space just attracts attention you don't want attention doing explo in hostile space.

Nah I am actually legit.  Someone set up a wall of shame when we had just started the move op for those that died at home during the war.
---
When I started in 2006, my goal was to max out the Megathron after I made my way to Gallente space and saw it for the first time.
---
These days... maxed out most combat skills, spaceships, supports, etc.
---
New goal? I'd like to survive a T5 abyssal pocket with my Gila.
---
Leveled up some precursor stuff on my main and dumped Gallente frigate 5 on my alt so can rock a Worm. It's her only non-Caldari ship skill - she's maxed on everything else Caldari.
---
How is it spin you mongoloid? Idiots keep krabbing when delve is relatively undefended, they get mocked for being idiots. Pretty cut and dry.
---
Hey princess, *don't* run it through Steam.
---
Use the standalone launcher like a normal person.
---
For some reason, it has returned to normal.  Now it is back to 10s - 15s to load after character screen.  Not sure what happened.
---
I mean, olmeca might be legitimately insane, but he's at least good at dunking excavators. I don't know if PH can be considered competent at even the simplest tasks. Then again, the people still mining during war are on the same level so you might have some luck.
---
or delete nullsec
---
Hell yeah, it was literally published a few dozen times in multiple languages that the umbrella of delve is down, we are deployed to war, dont rat or mine. Everyone who dies to this shit deserves it.

&gt;Any ~~Goon~~ super/titan ~~operating in delve during a period of war~~ deserves what it gets.

Of the examples you've offered, I'm really only familiar with the HK one. You can decide for yourself how well this argument applies to the other examples.

INIT had an invasion force on the order of 500-800 bombers. Goon peak numbers ran a little over 2k. In terms of *residents of Rage*, there were probably around 300 (counting alts with any combat or rolling capabilities). Wormhole and Nullsec entities who attempted to come to HK's defense are harder to count, since it's pretty hard to put concrete numbers on rage-rolling operations, and other entities may have been on standby if a chain was ever available. Just in terms of pilots that participated in ragerolling operations *that I am personally aware of*, I think it's safe to say that well over 500 characters were involved. If I want to estimate conservatively, let's say 500 characters that could have had jump clones pre-staged in Rage from each side after INIT's initial structures anchored, with another 1.5k attackers and another 1k defenders willing to participate but not able to jump-clone into the system.
---
I think it's probably not controversial that the extra thousand+ pods make the difference between victory and defeat, and so in the case of HK and Rage, even if we allowed jump-cloning into wormholes holding hole control would have been the difference between attacker victory, defender victory, or a massive tidi fight that I don't know how it would have turned out. (Sidenote: In a wormhole, people will undock against long odds because they're going to lose our ships anyway if the citadels blow up. Better to go down fighting than go down docked. The reason you don't see people do that now is because every pod is one that can log off in and "save" a ship full of valuable loot.)
---
The main difference with changing how clones work in wormholes is how the fight for hole control would proceed.
---
The attackers could have held hole control briefly, brought in their allies, set up jump clones, and phoned it in until timer time. If they had done so, the defenders would have been free to bring in their allies, and shore up any material shortages they may have accidentally allowed to occur. The attackers could have brought in their allies and set up jump clones, but kept a core group in-hole to hold hole control. We may assume that this group has a doctrine or two with some material redundancy, but the defenders could try to contest this group leading to a running skirmish based around how much material the defenders are willing to commit.
---
As things stand now, the defenders are forced to commit either next-to-nothing or everything, without the ability for any kind of in-between or running action. Any pod lost in an attempt at wresting hole control that doesn't immediately succeed makes the next attempt that much harder, so if you don't succeed right away you basically don't succeed ever.
---
This is mitigated *very slightly* by the possibility of rage-rolling to bring in reinforcements, but I'll just go ahead and say bluntly that rage-rolling for specific targets is bad gameplay for everyone involved. For most classes of wormholes (everything but C6), the odds are stark enough that you get at most about 2 shots at taking hole control with full strength, and that's making some very generous assumptions about the stamina of your allied rolling teams.
---
**If we assume** that the defenders have a large supply of ships compared to the pods already present, then with jump-clones or death-clones it is suddenly to their advantage to throw material into taking hole control. If they can get it, they can bring in their defender allies and form a proper defense at the timers. You suggest they'd just suicide scanners out, but while they *could* have done that to force the defenders to continually roll, I'd argue that they would have actually fought for hole control. Fatigue favors the one not trying to maintain hole control (and as a side-note running skirmishes from hole to hole is pretty engaging gameplay in my experience). The attackers can't bring in more ships while they're being forced to constantly roll, so well-prepared defenders could consider adopting an attrition strategy where they accept 2-1 loss rates counting on having more than twice the material on hand.
---
With attrition of *ships* rather than pods as the primary concern (although aren't there cooldown timers for jump clones? That could be relevant.) holding hole control against different classes of ships suddenly also becomes an option. If I'm running low on ships but I have hole control now, I might choose to leave up a chain knowing my opponent can start scanning it out so that I can get more ships in. I can make a choice about whether to allow their interceptors into the target so I can get my DSTs in while blocking their DSTs.
---
With attrition of *ships* rather than pods, there is also incentive to break out sub-optimal non-doctrine ships in last ditch efforts. I know of a couple of eviction fights where the attackers lost hole control during a timer and the defenders handed out hastily- or partially-refit PVE ships to allies as they arrived, leading to chaotic, memorable, and most importantly *fun* fights. With death-clones, you get the same kinds of sub-optimal fits taken into the fight just from the defenders after they lose their initial defense fleet, and they dare risk that defense fleet because they might have stocked enough material to risk it twice.
---
**If we assume** that the defenders are poorly prepared, then suddenly it's all a game of hole control again, except now instead of being all about the defenders trying to get pods in, it's about getting ships in. Holding hole control against ships is *much* more interesting gameplay in my experience than holding it against pods in travelceptors.
---
Kiting POSs was an annoying way to have to do it, but it was much better than what we have now.
---
thanks!
---
dont need to hide under a name to post any issue with gotg. and i dont spell SLYCE as Slyce
---
It was a clean kill, no response available. There are \~40,000 people in Imperium - if  1% were on vacation for a while or had irl it's completely possible they (*\~400 people*) missed the heads up. His fit clearly demonstrates he was at least competent and of higher calibur than your typical Delve super loss so it's unfortunate but shit happens and good kill Test - I think they got his rorquals as well.
---
So there you go, proving Test and co were helping you... so yeah the battle report should show them on your team... lol
---
Dude that's so one sided it hurts.Do you think we can go to work after staying up till 4.am? Your whole argument about eutz is flawed.If a europian stays up till that late , he won't go to work, or will be super tired and not really productive.Meanvile us players have to work, which is equally as shit, I'm not saying it isn't
---
Ah the rich salt mines of war. What a time to be alive.

Imagine being *this* retarded.

Looks like their webmaster broke the nginx configuration, too. 502s right now.
---
I dunno the people still sticking with eve after getting fucked by ccp over and over are just like battered spouses on a episode of cops. They plead with the police not to take thier spouse away cus they still love em. While sporting a black eye. I watched and continue to watch ccp fuck you lot. If jestertreks ama wasnt an eye opener i dont know what would be. But be my guest continue to line thier pockets.

Question about test server.
---
I know that everything costs 100 ISK and that I can find any anomalies on test server as I could on the live one.
---
My question is, are the 4 main trade hub stations the only place where you can buy stuff?
---
Also, is there a way to speed up the process of traveling or do I need to warp/jump to my destination as I would have on the live server?
---
Thanks.
---
But, but, you are so quick in here :)
---
welcome to reddit
---
Maybe in the system might work? 
---
The whole constellation is a little harsh, especially when you're reffing an athanor, or an astrahaus.
---
Reek is deployed near Pandemic Horde? I genuinely thought these were occasional roaming fleets  that visit Geminate like from all over Eve.
---
Sorry but big alliance use goku/stuka fleets primarily composed of bombers routinely. A dozen bombers is good, but 90 is awesome. Bombers scale just as well as anything else.
---
A makeshift dyson swarm?
---
I got my starting 1-2 Bils from Explo and PVE. then I started to do null trading. I also do P4 PI.
---
Anytime the devs make something to help the little guy, it is also helping the big guy. There is nothing that can be made in game that cannot be used by all that can train into it. If they make an uber powerful cruiser that can kill a super. Then guess what.... there will be a fleet of 250 uber powerful cruisers run by the big guys. The system is flawed.  If you dont want the risk of being the little guy overrun by the big guy then become a big guy, find like minded people ,and force yourself to expand and get better. 
---
The only way to stay risk averse in this game is stick to highsec and stay in a starter corp.
---
Good bait
---
love when the good guys win
---
Dude you might not be blue but as said you do help out each other if needed.So if the 2 largest coalitions in the game are FRIENDS that's it kind of, you outnumber everyone else
---
Command destroyers are a good example, both of a ship type that lets smaller groups engage larger ones, and of the incredible torrent of bitching and whining that such options elicit when used.
---

You will appreciate this. Hands down one of the best eve vids imo.
---
Unless you use RSS probes, they're also identical in strength. The advantage of core probes is they go down to 0.25 AU while combat probes only go down to 0.5 AU. This isn't much of a problem with proper skills, however.
---
It is when you find that desperate guy selling a titan hull for 38b
---
The funny thing is, this is true now. They can afford a few supers with isk, but the big masses of titans and supers that the south has built, you cant buy those with isk. You can only but the big blobs with ore. NCPL is discovering too late that you cant stick isk into a sotiyo and expect a super to come out.
---
Can someone recommend me a good battleship with drones for level 4 security missions and exploration sites? Preferably with cloaking. I am thinking about Nestor but it cannot use cloaks. Is Tengu good or any good at level 4 security missions? It is a long-term goal but I'd like to set my attribute remaps and implants accordingly.
---
“I don’t think it’s a problem that goons solely represent nullsec interests on the CSM”
---
CSM should have 1 member per alliance, maximum.
---
Sounds like you selected the "die" part of adapt or die.
---
we got 2 rorqs, there might have been a third that got out but I don't remember.
---
haha thanks man and sorry for killing ya :P. If youre flying solo atm you should come join us, more bros who want to be active are always welcome!
---
the third rorq did get out
---
Everyone one would like to pretend welp squad doesn't exist they got alot of newer fcs and members. So they almost never can punch above their weight but the do atleast try.
---
It's a problem for sleeper caches. That's why i carry a set of core probes as well and only switch to combats to find drones, MTUs, mobile depots and such.
---
Oh boy, the spin masters of posting shit are already working overtime i see.
---
Probably someone salty because the system he lives in thats outside of our super cap umbrella got rented out :/
---
O tempora, o mores.
---
there is a seeded system in every constellation iirc you can also use the /moveme command to get to one quickly
---
Smaller groups were exactly do you see any on the map.. yes skillu has a lot of systems compared to the nr of characters but evry1 is part of the 2 megacoallition one way or another so these talk about o_O no what the smaller guy do got us into these situation in the first place playing citadel online
---
/u/squizz is there a way to group kills by constellation?
---
[Can confirm.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/201706265544491008/579445240566513665/unknown.png)
---
no they didn't. The jammers were the only thing that defended the keepstars, if you don't understand that i don't know what to say man
---
I'm not sure why you think you are entitled to 100% safe krabbing
---
Where did he say that?
---
there are no "30k coalition", there are winter co, they are 15k
---
You massively outnumber panfam even if all of eve joined them.
---
I feel the problem is whether fc will be willing to use it, even now jump is not always broadcasted
---
You confuse me Asher, you say you like these small 50 man fleet fights but you work for the biggest blob in the game. You should take all the men loyal to you, for a pure pvp corp, move into a wh with a null static and be reavers over all nullsec. The guys will leave if you leave, you and I both know that many of them are more loyal to you as an FC than to the imp
---
No, because Reavers do not exist
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7pg50a/upwell_reinforcement_20_actually_even_worse_than/
---
And then what? Fight people in my TZ who will just retime so I can't do anything? Then I need allies. Well I already have allies, this game requires them as constituted.
---
This is a good idea. I regularly have deaf people in fleet and this would help a lot. Shout out to goonswarms own deafswarm that relays fc commands to the hearing impaired.
---
Yeah, it's not like people didn't call it.
---
Before you set out on a roam you have it understood:
---
- we have a multi-language formation
---
- we people who are hearing impaired
---
“I will need you to be responsive to my commands. “Stop” means: don’t move! “Hold” means: remain at your current location. &lt;other commands&gt;. Does everybody understand these commands?”
---
You have to make that a part of your fleet formation, and have it be an understanding of how the fleet is going to be guided.
---
It is important that the general makes sure his commands are understood -beforehand-. 
---
You have to give your effort every chance to succeed, but that comes from proper preparation and understanding that your team understands what you’re going to do.
---
Solved. There is already a Hold position broadcast.
---
that one is the worst model and was toughest to print :D i might have to rethink how to make that one in the future
---
check comments, I've pasted a link :)
---
What if instead of just being allowed to pick a Timezone you want to fight in as the attacker(or as it stands now be allowed to exactly pick the TZ as the defender) there is some way to deny a timezone as the attacker? So let's say you're an alliance consisting primarily of USTZ and EUTZ members you could say through some ingame mechanic: Ok the timer isn't going to happen during AUTZ but can happen at other times. Allowing alliances to have a bit less timezone coverage but not removing the importance of timezone coverage.
---
adapt retard
---
Not if cloaky campers count as being in space. Or even non cloaky people waiting at safes in frigates, using Sebos to make it impossible to scan them down.
---
If you mean mining/ratting, then sure, that is harder to abuse
---
I have, my adaptation just moved up hundreds of titans.
---
Make combat sharded? Joking.
---
you mean SA
---
Imagine still being in Darkness. after all the shit Sort has put them through
---
being in space has no effect on your ADM's, you have to be mining or ratting to affect those which is the only current indicator for using your space, so a cloaky camper would have 0 effect.
---
Maybe custom broadcasts would be a thing... like a second bar with customizeable broadcasts, made by the FC, or the ability to change the default ones...
---
and what would happen? Goons and legacy outnumbers #restofevetm by far
---
He’s a booty looter...
---
us wormholers fight and evict each other all the time without timezone tanking, its not as big a deal here. Plus you don't always have to grind structures for content. In wormholes you roll into neighbors and both groups always form and brawl (in 8 months im yet to not have that happen when we meet another group) and if you dont get wh content then you go out the null static and tackle supers/rorqs and fight the response (yeah its shit but its all we got in this age of caps online). You think too much in terms of blues and blobs. The game can be much more beautiful that that. wormhole groups are all about 100ish humans, the perfect size for good fights.
---
There's nothing broken with your playstyle, especially for you since you could just get more fc's and SIG members out of the thousands of members you have. I mean I know most of them are incapable of double clicking in space and broadcasting targets but I'm sure there are some. There is nothing stopping you from having "30-60" people and fc's in every tz.
---
Goons went to war with thousands of thousands of ships at the same time, could have caused this Yesterday.
---
Goons in delve? What is this black magic
---
Go to bed, child.
---
Description unclear. Is it part of the contract? I think you just place the package into your inventory and deliver it to its destination. Or are you trying to steal it?
---
How often do such events happen?
---
More like goons feeding in delve
---
We have a three guy roaming gang
---
And there are 8 different languages heard in comm
---
Halp
---
I'm sorry, what's a *death spiral*?
---
&gt; That's the whole point of this post. We have to bring everyone.
---
How dare you bring logic in to /r/Eve!
---
remember when you were being unfairly persecuted for being a /r/KotakuInAction poster and I changed your name color in a discord server and you threw a temper tantrum and left? good times...
---
Take upvote, take it take it take it
---
You do realize you can still light a cyno with a different ship further off the inhib, right?
---
This way every drooling NS bot who gets caught by a roamer might need to actually put 20 percent more effort in getting his caught shit out of there.
---
It´s not like roaming gangs can bring a cap down fast enough before the krabs drop 20 minokawas on them.
---
PvP content for horde, meme-ing content for goons. I don't see the contradiction.
---
**Booster slots and implant slots**. Are they really separate? Can't find a definite answer.
---
Can a Prototype Cerebral Accelerator overwrite my Intelligence implant? One has booster slot 4, the other one implant slot 4.
---
Steadyo, is this yours? Tool is perfect in function, just the interface is....cunt.
---
Sadly will die just as quick
---
My point still stands. You can't be shocked to find Goons in delve or finding them feeding.
---
Email information to security@ccpgames.com.

might as well scribble it onto a napkin with crayon then tie it to the leg of a drunken pigeon with hopes it finds peligro at his desk. No thanks, if I wanted to waste my time, I'd sit in novice plexs with a venture.
---
Too bad the bloodied warzone of 7rm has been converted into filthy farmlands by skynet.
---
Vigilante justice or something like that.
---
Ok, might as well join the karma circle jerk. Fuck bots, Chinese ruining my game, ccp suck, everyone is a bot, your a bot.
---
I'm still not sure if I like the biggest ship alive wins rule. I prefer the points for ship type format that while heavily rewarding killing the opposing teams largest ship also penalised a team that feeds its whole roster killing the opposing bs while keeping their bs and winning
---
Even Ranger Regiment that just got the Dek space is  already immediately up for rent.  Personally the whole aspect of renting on a large scale really grates with me for the following reasons
---
1. It goes against the ccps own strategy and that alliances must live and use their space in order to prosper from it.  This completely by passes that.
---
2. We stopped passive  moon mining  (great move) to ensure that again alliances were not just doing nothing and making billions.  Now they are literally doing nothing and renting out the moons and still making passive income! Wtf...
---
Renting is fine on a very small scale but it's got so bad that alliances literally dont have to do fuck all and still make billions of passive isk..its just ridiculous
---
I mean look at skillu  seriously 240 systems for a 1000 man alliance to rent it just mental.
---
Let's not use the well go make and army and stop them BS.  The next person just does the same. It's the fundamental core game mechanics or rules that need to stop this.
---
But people like CCP Falcon dont give a shit and its OK to break the strategy by circumventing it.
---
If we want to keep allowing a rental on this scale then CCP should implement a proper rental system (which I'm sure once they mentioned) which not only sets a top end price that people pay but also goes through a significant tax system that takes a decent chunk of those costs. Like 50%
---
Marsupial
---
Last time I bitched on /r/Eve, something actually happened. :) 
---
If this is how it has to be done, I'l get i on the circle jerk! Where's the cookie?
---
Most of the ressources of the game got dedicated to the goon moveop. goons are big enough to break the game when they travel in full force.
---
Can you justify any of these statements, or are you just flinging shit (poorly, mind you) and hoping your particular shit happens to stick where all the other smarter and more intelligent shit hasn't?
---
Our standing fleet chat last night was notable for a PvP encounter involving two deaf pilots and a mute pilot. As someone noted, it was one of the quietest fleets in EVE history - organised, as it was, almost entirely via chat. 
---
It did make me wonder what else could be done to make fleet communication easier though. Tagging targets is fine, but could there be more explicit tags? Say, for instance, Primary, Secondary, a Tackle tag, an Ewar tag? 
---
Would something like Rocket League's preset quick chat phrases be any good?
---
The video is great, what makes me cringe a bit is that the nagl doesnt cap up back to jump cap.
---
Delete the whole SharedCache folder?
---
Horde does thing goons did to them for months. Asks internet for high five.
---
the quality of your art stuns me everytime you post
---
still cheaper than replacing all those structure rigs.
---
Goons... rushing like cockroaches.
---
Madposting about getting outplayed lol
---
&gt;I'm not going to file a report using their system in game because it's a dead end and everybody knows it.
---
i refuse to report bots to the ONLY people that can actually do anything, then i'm going to be surprised and throw a tantrum about it not being dealt with.
---
i hope that illustrates how retarded you are.
---
Yeh but, staying up a couple extra hours compared to getting off work a couple hours early is different. 
---
For example on a friday night EUTZ can fuck US and can stay up a bit later to fight in USTZ while US TZ i guess can stay up to AUTZ?
---
I know that for a lot of people scoff at 15 mill extra, but it sparks joy seeing people live through the same things I did six years ago.
---
Why wouldn't you email/report them?
---
If you were genuinely serious about banning them, why would it hurt  (there is surely even a SLIM chance that you're wrong /s) to do it the official way too?
---
it does
---
Nice ass-art!
---
Oh great wise one, what is PanFam supposed to do in this situation? Please explain to us your great strategic masterpiece that would turn the tide against twice the pilots and more than twice the supers and titans? I'm sure your brilliant plan will far exceed any our incompetent leadership can come up with.
---
new npc space should be great place for living, also need some lvl 4 agents
---
[removed]
---
TEST backstabbing goons and invading delve while goons are fully deployed north would be hilarious. Then everyone just switches places.
---
I don't remember that at all, because it didn't happen.
---
I always love seeing other people’s overview layouts. So many ideas
---
That’s just as bad. Lol.
---
:joy:
---
This one is missing like 13 bil of goon killmails and 1 bil of horde killmails.
---
i think the timing of your post could be better tbh
---
its easy to dismiss as preemptive damage control or exclusively concern about things which are starting to affect goons - the rest of the universe has been dealing with this rubbish for over a year now
---
i personally don't doubt the motivation behind the post, however the you know the general eve player as well as i do...
---
It's something I've said on my podcast for a long time now, but I feel you, there will be some people who always see a meta play. My meta is I want the same to be better.
---
A quiet fleet is a good fleet :p.
---
But i think adding too many options will just clutter the already outdated UI.
---
Switch fc bro
---
After US comes AU first. You'd have to stay up reeeeally late to get into what we call EU TZ.
---
Technically, after WWB they kicked out TEST.  Or doesn't that count?
---
That idea sounds nice. The problem is alliances with relatively even TZ numbers across the board. Sure our AUTZ is ultimately weaker than our USTZ, but it is in no way significant enough to warrant us only being able to fight in USTZ. Being forced to straight up ignore 3/4s of you players isn't cool. With alarmclocking you can maybe bring that down to 2/3s or even only a half for a big op, but you can't fight a war on alarmclocks.
---
TZ tanking is only really a problem because the balance of power is so hilariously one sided. It would just not make sense for anyone to fight the imperium in USTZ.
---
That'd make it half a dozen Imperium CSM anyway, though.
---
Goons feeding harpy... you know there is 500+ titan/supers who are going to kill keepstar/sotiyo in your space worth a lot than what you just killed right ?
---
Wheres this post gone?
---
Thank you! :)
---
I literally said that it’s not like anyone’s marching current ncpl members out at gunpoint to mine the belts and you type out 300 words about how their members can’t be expected to go mining.
---
And that number of people blue to each other gets higher every time people pull it out of their ass to use in some dumb argument, what a joke
---
Tbh I prefer an ugly BR tool that shows all the kills over a good designed one that shows half of them.
---
Until br.inyour.space manages to actually portrait all the ships killed, not sure what else to use. Especially if a fight is over more than one system, where you can't use  zkillboard related.
---
i always have combats, someone has to get those warrior 1's 8000km away from gate
---
That is the most preferred method, yes. But fullscreen itself is terrible.
---
Ok, Goons aren't attacking Horde or TEST, they are attacking NC.. NCPL has long prided itself as the premier supercapital group in the game until last year when they were utterly embarrassed by Imperium forces.
---
I mean, which one to use for a fight over 2 systems? Zkillboard related only shows one system at a time and only a predefined duration (maybe you can change it via commands in the address bar? Not sure). Br.inyour.space misses like half the kills.
---
Because they are wrong. The Period Basis group that was banned was actually different people than he claimed.
---
A Nestor can use cloaks but isn't the best option. The Rattlesnake is currently the best PvE ship out there with drones plus missiles and can do 1200+ dps with t2 launchers and augmented heavy drones/gecko. Just fit a MJD and cloak if you really need it.
---
hey that is a good system, I lived there for a while
---
If you think your effort post on Reddit solved anything you are dumber than we originally thought.
---
About three fiddy
---
People in the Snuff fleet were getting mad interface lag even when we were just fighting the FRAT eagles on the in gate. 
---
Lost several people to it and almost burned out my hardeners because I had to keep telling them to stop overheating again and again
---
Seemed like a shitty fight from sever performance view despite the lack of overall TiDi
---
ungroup, some of the guns can still be working
---
Your safety is on yellow.
---
15mil for 20 seconds of scan time isn't anything to scoff at! But hey, More for me, bwhahahaha!
---
It would be pretty good if it had not so terrible design choices. Especially colours... Grey text on a blue bar in the menu? Who thinks that is a good idea? -\_- 
---
Light grey on white - I get it, the line between life and death is a slim one. But it should still be easy to see on a bloody battle report tool. After all, that's what it's there for.
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
\*inception\*
---
The funny thing is, everyone in NCPL has super. Back to UALX NCPL still had more titans than Test, but after X47 I just gifted my Titan to my friend and joined a small corp and I can still have tons of fun in shooting spaceships.
---
It is pretty ironic that everyone thinks that rorqs and supers are unbalanced shit and ruin this game, but still asks NCPL to get 20 more rorq alts and get in titans when Goons come.
---
In my opinion, NCPL had done their job in UALX and X47, I am glad that they quickly do such a wise decision.
---
Now it is the time to grab some popcorn and continue to do some pewpewpew then wait to see who is the next.

I come from Serenity btw.

This is not new Asher, quit crying, quit making effort posts please. Making us look bad.
---
was the yacht afk? how did u catch it :o
---
you forgot to censor one name, "jane niemand" did you ungroup your guns? :)
---
Weeell, I'll think about that mate. ATM I'm playing in more casual solo style, so getting into WH life fully...
---
gotta get those small non significant victories whilst you can right?
---
Goons start a war and suddenly, after spamming structures all over the cluster for a year, suddenly now they want changes to citadel mechanics? What a coincidence.
---
It's important that defenders are able to take a fight at a time they can actually defend it. Of course it would be fine for Goons because you have eleventy billion players and can defend at any time, so a POS timer like situation (where attackers can essentially choose the timer) would strongly favour the huge blobs. You're looking at it as the leader of an attacking SIG, but there's nothing more frustrating than having a defence timer for a structure at 3am for all your players so you can't even fight to save it.
---
Restricting where you can set the timer based on activity is not a bad idea, but how do you measure activity? Lots of structures are placed in systems which people don't actually do stuff in space in - industrial structures in lowsec, moon mining athanors in highsec, and structures in wormholes (where your activity is in your static most of the time, not the home hole). Even if done well, it would still allow a big blob to move the TZ to their favour and then make it impossible for the owners to defend. And as you suggest it means you can't rent out space to PVEers from other time zones - but unlike you I don't think that's obviously a good change.
---
For me it isn't the timezone that's the issue, it's the spammability of structures, and the two long timers. Medium structures shouldn't have two timers (and low power medium structures shouldn't have a timer at all), and the length of the timer should be much shorter, perhaps like it is in J space. And it's also about how oppressive structures are - you can't really occupy enemy space while they have their structures, you certainly can't fight on a hostile structure grid easily.
---
tl;dr I wouldn't move the structure timers, I'd make them weaker in other ways
---
I am working on https://br.evetools.org and feature for more than one system and inputting custom duration almost done, when it will be ready ill publish post on reddit and official forum. However its already usefull for one-related brs.
---
i'm confused.  why did they awox the hel? and those rorqs?
---
Well, I believe the idea is to emulate CCP game design choices.
---
No one cares.
---
i think it looks just fine.
---
they folded years ago after the golden age if piracy slowly faded. haven't heard from t1ller in ages. I assume he quit
---
Pretty obvious they don't do anything about it. At least here I can rant and call people like you assholes. :)
---
This is the easiest burner mission, one that can be soloed without a cap booster so with the greatest margin of error... People are just bad.
---
lol no that would be hilarious
---
\[AW0XU\]
---
The Hel looks way too clean.
---
It’s a Matari ship. It should look like two scrap yards met each other in a high-speed collision.
---
... Super cap umbrella? You mean Muninns right?
---
No. Why?
---
What exactly do you lose by reporting them?
---
Why what? Why do we need to disincentivise blobbing? Because blobbing is boring, it leads to blueballing (when the slightly smaller blob realises it can't get numbers to match up a fight), and it doesn't provide opportunities for high skill piloting or tactics, both of which are far more fun than 'anchor, press F1' - or even, with bigger ships, 'cyno in, sit still and press F1' - probably the most boring 'combat' gameplay in any game ever.
---
Everyone has everything already, stop memeing yourself into production related stuff.
---
Yeah I'm not a fan either but it's the only one that loaded all the kills.
---
No it's not mine
---
Bump damage is one option, though you'd have to think carefully about how that interacted with CONCORD.
---
Cynos shouldn't be instant and lightable on a contested grid, so you can't just drop your blob in at 0 with no counter.
---
More AOE damage or ewar options to dissuade anchor-at-500 formations (guided smartbombs maybe?).
---
Line-of-sight targeting.
---
Don't allow logi to repair through 100% of damage that's being taken now, so you actually have to clear whatever's shooting you - this would at least allow skirmish groups to kill *something* and make it far more fun to try catching ships out of position.
---
How far away from the gate were you?
---
Could a haw fit dread track t2 logi that's orbiting around 15km? I don't need any actual numbers, just if anyone knows from experience
---
In 0.0 too :-)
---
What's wrong with it? It doesn't seem that bad and it loaded a lot faster than the usual inyourspace one from me.
---
The styling isn't great but 'asscancer' is way too strong for 'you don't like the colours'.
---
I thought this was already a thing
---
Yeah i was a member during the prime as i joined beer and kebabs when it folded and tiller asked me to come along with the rest of them. Like u said the golden age of piracy. I loved the war with october snow and the ginger magician
---
war is going good - war is going good - war is going good - war is going good
---
they so scared they unanchor a whole region

It's a trail of Goon wrecks.
---
it is my stuff, was delivered to me
---
That high-level strategic game has no winners. Look at  Serenity  You can't win it, only wreck the game.
---
Well in my experience, my corpmates and my militia as a whole has been complaining about how they can't aggress neutrals who enter into a plex without losing security status, and besides, the tags cost too much.
---
His last braincell
---
Jita scam
---
You can't really run a war without an industrial base.  So you're more like bandits than a military.  Just imho.
---
So did he light a cyno and nothing popped out the other end to defend?  Competent fit though...
---
Lol yup I’m with you
---
test are not blue to goons.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s the same for every alliance. Also if they’re dumb enough not to read or care they deserve it.
---
Ships blowing up = Cool.
---
Wait, could those ships even fight back? No? = Meh

Train hard, young padawan, you too may become like the PERVS.

Non, all BPC prices are falling. What ever you think you might get later for the BPC, in the moment buying a BPO, its much less, unfortunately.

In what way is this a scam, and what is Jita?
---
Probably bots
---
Give me your survey results, I'll double them!
---
Oh please, if you're going to get giddy about smartbombing something, at least take a leaf out of R&amp;Ks book and do it against fleets which actually have guns fitted:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNUu75fH8Uc
---
I can't work out why though - they are undercutting their own orders by 1 mil each time, so the price between say their first and last is about 10 mil.
---
They would have lost over a bil, if not more.
---
No man. Super caps are the only ever bobbed things. Blov hubcaps what are those? Like entire 4k man fleets of battleships, logistics or anything else. No they'd never do that. Despite their endless capitals they failed to remember to build hubcaps right?
---
*above is a joke* you got downvoted a bit for a pretty honest statement so that above must genuinely be their line of thinking.
---
If you have say....5000 to sell and there are 5000 other people with only 1 or 2 to sell, you drive the margin down so those people all don’t bother (otherwise they’d lose money) and thus you capture near 100% of all sales. And yes your margin is lower, but you’re selling so many you’re still making profit. 
---
It’s literally the definition of “we’ll make it up in volume”.
---
\-Quits EvE, shit posts on reddit-
---
Sorry the Chinese server got taken down cannot copy rooks n kings
---
maybe he dident turn on the "mark my orders" in the market settings so he/the bot keep updateing the orders thinking someone have a lower price
---
Like grandmaster Wizard-hat  had forseen this in  his state of the bees yesterday. Someone will haras delve and this is an awesome advantage cause they can then massacre fleets in several places. 
---
Just wasnt aware that this means goonfleets in the first palce...😂
---
Good job horde i love you little beans! Just stay as you are 😘
---
*probably broken bots
---
Also, they may just be attempting to move market share to another location or some shit.
---
Isk income is often exponential. Having more isk allows you to earn isk faster. That being said, I think I earned my first billion in a VNI? Was painful
---
Lol not even 15h after the first movement
---
Couldn't that be achieve by just having 1 stack of 200 with say 470m.
---
Instead, they have ...
---
20 x 496m
---
20 x 495m
---
20 x 494m
---
20 x 493m
---
... etc
---
20 x 470m
---
But why down by 1m per instance? Instead of 1isk?
---
Not necessary. I’m bold enough to publicly call you out.
---
Best example I can think of is FW mechanics. Lately the amarr have been using 15+ people to bash I-Hubs. We have saved systems multiple times with 1-2 guys successfully D-plexing.  Only made possible by ship type restrictions in FW gates.
---
that was almost 2 days ago. I also should train my thermodynamics to 5
---
Me at UALX ^
---
Nah there's an option in the settings in game.
---
Quite often you have a load of stacks up at different prices, its not an uncommon thing to do.
---
uh, yea they are.  do you not read the reddit?
---
image not found.

IMO the easiest one is the guristas agent, then the enyo team burners.

https://br.inyour.space/?s=4747&amp;b=8614740&amp;e=90&amp;t=uvv
---
Because that’s what the dipshit set their bot to do? Seriously man people are answering your question.  When someone falls down in real life do you ask every passer-by: “why did that guy slam his face against the ground?!”
---
Maybe dont use the Ministry of Offense to defend stuff :D
---
I have done that and you are right they don’t care at all
---
Hang on... are you claiming I've both simultaneously quit eve and am multiboxing 14 orcas?
---
that is logical.  you don't want to drop a bit stack because if you drop 20 stacks, you can continuously update the prices to undercut your competition instead of having to wait 5 min on the one big stack. 
---
you space them out because while you want the first to sell, you don't necessarily want to leave any isk on the table so you price them generally higher in case someone takes the entire board.  In the case that your lowest sells, you can adjust your other orders.
---
sounds like a you problem.
---
Maybe fix your pc, then try
---
haha i keep telling him to inject right away, he gets better over the course of the videos (more practice :P )
---
I do that when I know the people will undercut me and I don't want to babysit my orders and I have lots of them.
---
If I place only 500M then I will sell nothing, people will sell 499.999999
---
If I place  450M, same, people will sell 4499999999
---
If I sell a gradient of values people will not perceive it as a threat to their benefit that requires to take an action. If they undercut it by 50M, then they lose 50M\*orders because of a small number of orders.
---
Basically it's because the market system in Eve is shit and require you to babysit your orders in order to make a profit.
---
Aww poor NCPL, they can no longer claim to be the big dick so it must mean the game is dead and turning into serenity.
---
Only problem with that, is the other extractors are selling for say 497m.
---
All the other orders they place up themselves, are undercutting themselves. 
---
Not by a few isk, but by millions.
---
no that's not. there is NO REASON for a bot to go 1M instead of 0.01 isk.
---
Have you tried downloading less porn?
---
Don't uninstall the client every day?

My launcher is working fine.

I don't have all the bpos in 20 copies of 10/20 yet.

You better call them Tosche Station Freeport Network 2.0

The Only Pest Control is http://horde.hell-rider.de

The Original Horde Pest Control
---
Are you dumb? This obviously isn't a "crying" post... this is a post that is quite eloquently laying out the problem, why it is a problem, and a proposed solution.
---
Fuck off
---
Time is a flat circle.
---
I like how even this can become a grr gon post
---
My launcher is running fine, I haven't heard of anybody else who has to reinstall their client every day. It sounds like a problem with your PC, try vior something instead of instantly blaming CCP.
---
I seriously question the intelligence of people like you who constantly think we're a bunch of mindless twats in Rorqs.
---
didnt realize you had to claim each day, i was just logging in.   either way it dosent really matter, SP's are buyable these days so the incentive to show up for these 'free sp events' is kinda lost on me.
---
Made right when we deploy for war. Looks pissy. So no, you fuck off.
---
Your computer is dogshit. That's why.
---
what does the other side of the market look like?  if he is placing orders that will cross, then yea he's an idiot.  or he might just be trying to drive the spread between the buy and sell down?
---
while it is entirely possible that there was a mistake, don't discount that he might have some weird strategy that will pay off.
---
[Same.](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/1695357456/)
---
&gt;NC
---
&gt;viable
---
That's awfully generous of you.
---
So, when was he supposed to make it?
---
If he had made it earlier, people like you would have been whining that he was just making an excuse to NOT go to war.
---
If he made it after the war, people would be whining and moaning that this was goons admitting defeat and coming up with an excuse.
---
There is no good time for him to make the post, so right now seems like as good of a time as any.
---
Yes! Thank you, that's what I was trying to get across.
---
Perhaps because it's his prerogative. I adjust my orders by 1m, 10m 1000001 isk ALL the time to piss off the .01 players. And for real just because someone out bids you on the market does not make them a bot. Stop crying wolf.
---
alltime rank 10, not bad for a dead alliance.
---
More orders to be able to update to stay on top.
---
INB4 "muh nothing of value was lost"
---
It would probably be named something with "Dickbutt" in it, to match our Keepstar.
---
yeah and this guy just can't accept the answer provided make no sense at all.
---
Why hold CCP responsible for your PC issues?
---
To be fair to them its not like everyone had the exact same 50 ships. I think there was a lot of devil in the detail type of shit. 
---
Like we figured out the claw was fucking broken in that day 1 slot, don't think anyone else ran a claw like we did. But we saw plenty of maledictions which was an actual trash tier pick.
---
Underrated comment tbh
---
Stunning and brave.
---
There are no good guys, only sides.
---
No, he should have made this post between wars, and I would have stood behind the post, because he is not wrong. The problem is it gives the impression of making excuses early. Asher has a long history of taking things to Reddit and asking others not to and his posts are nothing but cringe.
---
To be honest, I think you are the only person I have seen outside of Gobbins really giving off that impression in this thread.  Most people seem to be having a pretty reasonable discussion.
---
For Guristas, I found 5/10's to be a \*lot\* harder than 4/10's. The 4/10's could be run in a shitfit Gila with poor skills, the 5/10's couldn't.
---
As a GSF member that has deployed, this makes me moist.
---
You do know the difference between serenity and tranq is the fact that Serenity let people bot right ?
---
pssst, good time to use your horde alt ;)
---
Don't have one :(
---
I never knew 90% of the game is making isk to have ships to fly
---
To be honest, they deserve to die. Please continue.
---
-every Goon who actually deploys.
---
Wow... "didnt even want that space" before the first battle. This some kind of record?
---
based
---
Color coding is already a part of fleet watch lists
---
I have been plodding through with what looked like the exact amount of days left on the UI and now it looks like I will lose out at DT, WTF?
---
Those raitarus Will be super useful when theres bot a single a intelligent soul in delve.
---
It's not like anyone had the balls to go for the sov or structures.
---
Hope you guys have this level of effort in the north too
---
No, that time is when the fighting starts and a Horde fleet needs deleting
---
Instead of basing it on ADMs, base it on usage of the citadel, and make it have rolling average, such as 60 days, so it can't be suddenly changed.
---
A brand new citadel, one that has evenly distributed TZ usage, or one that is hardly used would have a vulnerability window that is spread across time zones, but each window maybe shorter.   A citadel heavily used in a single time zone may have all of its vulnerability in concentrated in one TZ.  Maybe a citadel with two TZ usage could have a dual vulnerability window.  There are lots of possibilities.
---
Activities that would count would be docking, refining, market usage, etc.
---
Imagine needing this level of damage control Before goons have even started shooting your space
---
You do know goons lost already 2 rorq and 2 supers again while you where typing those lines
---
Sometimes you find excavators in Deklein and Delve!
---
TIL the war is subcaps in delve
---
we used to have a shirt that pictured a trail of our own wrecks
---
Im going to guess they died in a region where they have been told that they Will die if they krab
---
Remind me to get you on a podcast some day
---
There are 18 days, downtime to downtime, just as in every previous log-in event. You need to log in once between 2 downtimes to claim a reward. Looks like you made a mistake somewhere
---
Only the case when you overheat something else on the high rack, and I doubt that he heated that nos.
---
Not if they turn off their prop mod, and especially if they're AB fit. This is just from looking at a random HAW Nag I had in pyfa, dunno about other dreads and especially the phoenix.
---
the mental gymnastics are really fascinating I must say
---
Allow death clones in w space, but only if you die in that system?
---
The current meta is mass rorquals, and then titan/super mega blobs. Thats about it. If people have to adapt to THAT meta, they need the rorquals. Paired with skill injectors, this got amplified to a whole different level.
---
Goons trully embraced the elite attitude they so much hated, or at lease they used to state it. Oh the irony.
---
2+ free injectors worth of SP for 1 extra click/day is incentive enough for most.
---
I guess I did, but the UI made it look like I was comfortable.
---
#nosympathy 
---
Nothing like a little math and clicking to earn 2 injectors.
---
Imagine being a goon and thinking you get to punch down on any miner ever. Always the ones going off about how they got to where they are by being kind to crabs and then talking shit in an alliance made up of them.
---
Very Nice
---
There are days i'm really thankful i don't work in customer support. Thinking of dealing with unfriendly, self-entitled brats like these on a daily basis would make me sick.
---
Perhaps try to sort YOUR shit out first?
---
Lossmails
---
there are no bots in imperium/imperium renters! xD
---
You throw away multiple billions because someone outbid you by 1isk?
---
You could be onto something there, trying to reduce the spread.
---
Just not sure why.
---
&gt; Say, for instance, Primary, Secondary, a Tackle tag, an Ewar tag?
---
You can use the alphanumeric tagging for that. "A/B/C", "1/2/3" and "X,Y,Z" tags that can be applied by FCs in addition to any target broadcasts etc.
---
Literally, the biggest blobber in Eve calls for changes so that things get even ***more easier*** for the ***biggest blob***.
---
This is the reason north is like a shriveled dick.
---
"we dont want to mine"
---
"recruit krabs to do it for you"
---
"WE DONT WANT TO MINE"
---
oO I just find it great that your home is on fire the moment you go on a deployment xD
---
yeah, wp then i guess xD
---
F
---
eh, yea i guess. i havnt played eve in over a year now. like ive been on but not actually played... 
---
i dont know if ill ever come back to the game, after the last war i was in i just kinda lost interest. this years lack of eve fest and the AT didnt help spur my enthusiasm either. 
---
i also dont have much insentive for SP, not like i once did anyway
---
I’ve had this recently. Using a VPN solves it for me.
---
I wouldnt call shitlers ignoring pings dying "on fire"
---
Before we see sov or structures hit, who cares?
---
I’m now interested to see if there will be a detour to the BWF keepstar.
---
The real jackpot is finding an unanchored citadel that hasn't been picked up yet.
---
Having combat probes is like a free billion isk then if you can get a hauler in.
---
Yup, set up your filters for each system in the constellation
---
[deleted]
---
Found the problem:
---
https://i.imgur.com/bzTFyc8.jpg
---
Yes I have. Once. When INIT. invaded Hard Knocks WH and killed those keepstars.
---
Because KB's are everything.
---
They aren't that expensive. People did a lot of pi in syndicate when I was in a smaller group and we had only maybe 8 pocos and still made back the cost in under 3 months. People used them alot and didn't mind paying our tax rate.
---
but he's kinda not wrong
---
Had one of those situations, had to kill it instead, that's the one reason I trained my main to be able to sit in any ship.
---
Bah, looks like I came back to EVE a day late, goodbye catch-up SP!
---
2 clicks, you have to clickthrough to close the claim window.
---
I wanted a freighter.
---
Three years in, I had trained an alt and bought one.... a year after moving into a low class wh where i'm still happy two years later.
---
Think I've made a grand total of 5 or so trips with my freighter.
---
Don't ruin NCs narrative!!! They killed 3 stabbers in Delve.
---
But he kinda is.
---
I think there are winners, they are just not you.
---
I’m going to miss out by two days?
---
I don’t know.. I thought I was golden.
---
Loved sitting through that TERRIBLE redeem ui on all of my accounts every time I logged I only to get shafted because I was on vacation when the event started.
---
All my 1dq titan contracts just sold. I'd say that's big.
---
Well said
---
lol their balls start dropping when 99% are gone.... meanwhile in unanchoring central..........
---
Found it. Thanks.
---
&gt;  Shout out
---
&gt; hearing impaired.
---
Because you have trillions of isk in the bank means you still don't pvp?
---
Hahaha... yah yah enjoy while we burn your years of work to the Ground... 
---
Regards from delve, fucktards... 🤪🤪🤪🤪
---
So this was when local was fucked a few days ago, then i spotted this afk yacht, he was 10 off, but when he was pretty low, he burned to gate and seconds later i dropped point because i thought i couldnt kill him and he warped to sun.
---
That's pretty awesome man o7
---
No, that is just 10% :)
---
I always give my corpmates shit for scanning chains with scanfrigs and cores when combats get very same results but you can also kill a rolling cap every know and then.
---
Then I am missing 10% of the game, not 90%
---
They were always a renter coalition, their usual currency is cannon fodder numbers for their masters, but they are also known to pay with Faction Forts... now it's just more evident than before, but nothing really changed.
---
Do you really want more fights?  You are on the wrong side for that now.  You should drop a bunch of forts all over Delve and the flip them over to panfam.....
---

I didn't actually, but I do really like that movie!
---
You make about 50-150m/h doing offensive plexing in a t1 frigate. That should earn you tags fast. When I used to be in FW I often went to a belt and shot 1 npc rat each time I logged in. That gave some sec status back.
---
11 normal caps, 9 rorqs and 3 supers already died in delve, and the goon deployment is less than 24 hours old.
---
continue beeing bad at this rate and you will need to kill several keepstars per week to make up for ur losses....
---
oh wait, some little sweet bird told me most of the expensive stuff in tribute disappeared :-D
---
Newbe alpha and just happens to know what eggs and bacon is
---
That is a cool idea. Not sure if it has any place in game though.
---
You used to be able to do this solo in Tempests and make money from insurance.... You couldn't buy back sec status tho, hah. It might be unsporting, but is will always be amusing.
---
The only thing I can think of is its pre downloading the next expansion or patch.
---
If you're data limited all the time then your s*** out of luck. I personally am only data limited sometimes so I leave it open when Im not limited and it seems to work
---
TEST doesn't backstab.
---
and 11 caps, 9 rorqs, 3 supers in less than 24 hours:-D

---
What? No. You never want to trade with a single high-volume order.
---
Kek
---
But hey - at least you can buy a cool shirt.
---
No he's successfully baiting you into looking more like an idiot for everyone's amusement.
---
So, lowsec or wh-space then?
---
I have been in those big alliances. The content quality is extremely low even if you get top notch srp. Too many rules and too many blues. You most likely are missing huge part of actually cool content.
---
Fuck steam
---
big difference is that pl also lost a lot of their fights. yes, they often attacked small alliances but these small alliances also often got help. plus, the action around pl was only a small part of nullsec, there were a load of other stories too. 
---
today, more than 70% of nullsec players are within the "tapirium".
---
It's the best market system I've seen in any game.
---
Not going to lie, me too! That would have been awesome.
---
Warped out of a level 1 serpentis mining mission in a Venture that way once...
---
I thought level 1 mining missions would be fine in a venture, but a whole angel npc group with a cruiser head was waiting for me..
---
Slim sliver of my structure left as warp set in.. and hits still registering
---
We get srp for pretty much everything. From solo to kitchen sink fleets. We got a highway to north for content, wormholes, lowsec etc and FCs that do said stuff.
---
Granted the thing we are missing is strong, permanent presence in wormholes, which I really should dip my toes into.
---
Those dumbasses deserved to have their ships blown up tbh
---
Jita is the main trading hub in EvE. It is notorious for scamming. People offer to “double your isk” by requesting a sum, and assuring you they’ll return twice as much. (Spoiler alert, it rarely happens) there are tons of scams, to the point where it’s become sort of a meme to mark anything different than the normal BR’s and shitposting on reddit as a scam. 
---
Scamming in game is a totally legit mechanic of gameplay, which is what causes it to be so prevalent.
---
That happens when you have Sisi or one of the other servers ticked. The launcher then downloads their latest builds also. If you do not log into Sisi regularly, just untick it
---
The other day my launcher randomly deleted the shared cache while getting stuck on an update. RIP my Eve client. 
---
Another annoying thing I noticed is the launcher randomly getting stuck during updates, using my whole bandwith while never finishing.
---
The nos could sink heat from the guns, leaving one or two in the rack adjacent to the nos operational, no?
---
The rest of Eve doesn't care about null sec.
---
First, I'm one of the people farming carebear in delve who never bother to participate into pvp
---
Second, As I said above they are only carebears no one care
---
Third, there is a gap between alliance strategic assets and carebear pve shit.
---
But hey, keep trying to spin and saying shit, it's not like because of this narrative one side have 500+ titan rolling up north right now while the other side is posting bomber kills and video montage of 170 titans on sisi
---
I like the assumption you guys carry that bot users are somehow good at the game.
---
nobody is carrying such an assumption.
---
I like however how you carry the assumption that people making bots would make their bots take bad decisions on purpose.
---
A c4 static gets you more PvP content because a lot of crabs live in c4s. And some PvP corps too.
---
This will surely disarm our combat force that is up north.
---
Oh we will have fun for sure😊 they will not care either way and be happy to bash structures with 500 titans and totally dont dislike beating the shit of our morale making fun of them
---
You could make an alt and inject it with sp you make from srp :)
---
Relax they are just mad that they cant touch us so easy... they go back home in two weeks and claim we are exhausted and bla bla bla hellwar masterplan and so on
---
You're always an asshole to people. I think it's mostly because your have low self esteem.
---
This is like looking at a picture of a prism. Where’s up/down? Then again it’s space so that’s not clearly defined
---
I just clicked one of the kills from his garbage BR page, and clicked related. He should have put more effort into making a BR on a usable site in the first place.
---
I see. Bugger. I'd best sign off Reddit and go and watch TV then.
---
I think there's a new kind of MMA show on tonight. It's like normal MMA except it's one person vs 5, except the 5 on the other team have all had their legs chopped off at the hips, and people stand around the cage whooping with glee as the other guy kicks them in the face.
---
You should try it. I think you'd like it.
---
maybe its becoming an ethical thing from players "No botting cuz lotz rl people envolved"
---
Squishy’s content never dissappoints
---
"they are not killing us fast enough"
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
Nothing wrong with my PC at all. I tried it on a *fairly* fresh install of Windows on my laptop and have the same problem. I've not got any issues with any other games at the moment so I'm doubtful it's the PC's fault.
---
(also has Chrome, Steam, Spotify, Teamspeak, plus a few other games on)
---
What part of this makes you think it's something I'm doing that is causing the issue? 
---
Also, what gives you the right to call someone you don't know a self-entitled brat? Yeah I'm pissed off that the product I pay for doesn't work because I work damn hard and pay a company for it. I'm also not the only person here who has issues with the launcher?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqh2kr/why\_is\_the\_eve\_launcher\_such\_a\_filthy\_liar/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqh2kr/why_is_the_eve_launcher_such_a_filthy_liar/)
---
I was downloading more because I had nothing to do while it installed :/ I'll definitely try your suggestion though!
---
On a recent WH trip, I found some suspicious giant cans floating in the middle of nowhere. No starbase, no citadels, nothing. Scanned it down, found a few free interceptors. I just ejected them, found the nearest exist and took a few trips to evacuate them.
---
thats my cool story ok bye
---
Thank you for your comment based on nothing at all.
---
Nothing else I do with my PC has a problem? I'm not the only person with issues with the launcher? The launcher is actually developed by them so I guess they are responsible for it working or not working?
---
&gt;big difference is that pl also lost a lot of their fights. 
---
We'll never know if they could win some of their fights now if they never fight
---
&gt;yes, they often attacked small alliances but these small alliances also often got help.
---
It's funny how many of the groups PL used to enjoy attacking over and over again joined together into legacy, isn't it? I wonder if there was reasoning behind that
---
Maybe if they weren't constantly being attacked by an alliance who almost always had superiority over them, deciding if they would get evicted again this week they wouldn't have joined together like they did
---
Tapirium was made by PL as much as by tapirium.
---
I never mine or build or rat, I have never done any of those  things for more than like, a month once a year.  Im worth 300b, so it would seem I CAN have one without the other.
---
I actually selected "Lol ok CCP 0.0 is dead for fun game play I'll stick to small gang shit"
---
Don't think I'm the only one with issues with the launcher...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqh2kr/why\_is\_the\_eve\_launcher\_such\_a\_filthy\_liar/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqh2kr/why_is_the_eve_launcher_such_a_filthy_liar/) 
---
Also, I work in IT... I've tried all the normal stuff like virus scans, start up programs etc. I can even leave the PC turned on and after down time the Eve launcher just stops working and gives an error saying it's not ready... Close the client, make sure it's stopped in task manager, open it again, same issue.
---
It did this to me the other day also. Eve wasn't launching cuz it "wasn't ready" apparently. 
---
No downloading no nothing on the launcher. Rebooted it and it came up fine lol
---
This is a hopeless line of thought since there is no tool the small group can use that the large group can't. The strategy is and will always be n+1.
---
Perhaps CCP should put some more emphasis on fixing what it has instead of adding shiny new broken things?
---
I'm sure there are many people who's launcher works. Bugs in software don't always affect everyone. Most of the time it'll only affect a few people. Otherwise it probably wouldn't get past testing and actually be released...
---
PS. Anything can become grr gon with minimal effort.
---
Point taken; still worth it :)
---
NGL I immediately wanted to biomass after this. Fell for the oldest trick in the book because I was too lazy to open local. But, wouldn't be right to not show off the funny side of things, so here yah go!
---
Well played Bombers Bar.
---
That is because most people don't see this for what it is. IF we fail in destroying a strut, Asher will point to this thread. It is what he does.
---
tbf neither is brcat or zkill really.
---
That sounds hilarious sign me up
---
It's just a joke from our game.
---
Wanted to find an enjoyable corp in odd time zones but failed. It was a long term goal since this is tougher than you think. Prime time would be easier but I fall in between all zones. I'm logging in as one major zone is logging off and then another major zone logs in a bit later. The later part starts happening as I'm logging out. Not having 14 hours a day to play and not wanting to be in a null blob alliance makes EVE a no-go for me. gave up after 7 months. I'm sure they're out there but finding a corp in EVE is difficult at best. Not looking anymore but I did get all my log-in gifts!
---
This might come as a surprise, but those fucks ignoring pings in delve have nothing to do with the combat force deployed to the north
---
&gt;NGL I immediately wanted to biomass after this. Fell for the oldest trick in the book because I was too lazy to open local. But, wouldn't be right to not show off the funny side of things, so here yah go!
---
Did no one in your blob tell you that local was full of randoms?
---
I cant believe that no one was smart enough to infer that bombers bar were present by looking at local.
---
That's not it failing, that's just the launcher doing some background downloading
---
Bjorn Bee's fleet had gone through the same way we did not 10 minutes before - Little did we know that they'd gotten through before they were able to set up, leaving us to be the punchline!
---
What does HAW mean?
---
Morale is important believe it or not
---
&gt; You had 7?/10 csm members for a year what have they done to address TZ tanking?
---
Shit, our CSM members have been seriously lax in personally implementing game changes. We'll have to put them in the stocks later for their negligence.
---
Ok, here's the scenario. Micro gang fight with no logi, twelve svipuls on the other side. A web loki, stratios and nightmare on ours. Should the nightmare be active fit or buffer?
---
Not really. Plex and SP keep going up hand-in-hand because it takes plex to get SP. 
---
The real stability will start coming in when more people unsub accounts, or switch to skillfarming accounts they're using for PvP/PvE that they were previously training. For example, you can run all your cyno alts for pretty-much-free if you skillfarm them.
---
Morale of who?
---
Those who are deployed and are laughing at shitlers dying, or those shitlers that are dying?
---
Because the first group isn't getting anything but giggles out of this.
---
Not your morale, doofus, no one knows who you are
---
high angle weapon - anti-subcap capital guns.
---
Ty!
---
Off topic question. But if I blow up someone in provi and their zkill is a tad suspicious of the non-human variant. Should I link said char to someone in provibloc or directly report them to CCP for checking?
---
Said someone was in Rezada Regnum. Think they're in provibloc.
---
Abyss profits really vary. You could make a run and come out with 1k worth of stuff. Or you could come out with 1b worth. Compared to the steady rate of bounties ratting and stuff, it fluctuates. But it is guaranteed to only take you 20 min or less. =)
---
one of the Lazerhawks guy's said it best everyone that says just rage roll has not done it before. 
---
I absolutely agree rage rolling isn't good gameplay, the issue I'm trying to point out is goons would have had more pilots on the first insertion if those guys could insert set the clone and could jump out again because it would mean a less heavy commit from there side. 
---
al the toons that showed up for the first final timer could have been set up beforehand, with the force for the final timer it would have been next to impossible for HK and friends to break that ( the reason rage rolling stopped at that point ). 
---
If the defenders have the ships it's still not to there advantage to use them unless they win like nothing of that mechanic changes because you can save your material regardless, like its similar to when you have an unrolled frig hole, most of the time these are used to infill rather than to directly contest hole control, what you seem to ignore is how the ability to dead clone into a wormhole helps the attacker, given the attacker already has the advantage and can bring in the needed material in 1 shot, specially if you don't have to hard commit your dudes one of the things that hold evictions back as common is that it's a hard commit from everyone involved because you need to hold hole control all your characters need to be in the hole ( or a large amount ), this means evictions become much more casually run ( and that's really bad for the smaller groups in wormhole space as they're gonna be fucked regardless of hole control ). 
---
Now if we look at what happened to Stranger Danger. during the eviction of Hole Sale, where inner hell jumped into there home and evicted them making evictions a non-hard commit for attackers means this is no longer an issue, like sure it will encourage the defender to maybe undock ( like I still don't see the benefit in undocking a losing fleet so really your only gonna undock if you think you win as well the attackers need to lose hole control for it to matter ), now the biggest issue is that the attackers now can dead clone back and they're much more likely to have spare doctrine ships than the defender, as well when dead clones become a thing you bring a bunch of DSTs in to bring spare ships.
---
As for holding against ships or ceptors it really shouldn't matter because if you do your job right neither one should get remotely close to the hole.
---
Beautiful
---
Both. Report them to CVA diplos AND report them to CCP. That's how I've dealt with bots in the past and I'd encourage others to do the same. Fair warning, but let CCP take care of it, as they're the only people who can truly know if they're bots or not.
---
I've gotten people banned before by in-game reporting them.
---
Even got a beautiful salt thread on the old forums after their 30 days expired. I wish I'd saved that.
---
They were a mining bot fleet (orca plus 10 skiffs) in highsec under the old ice belt system. Bumped them, no response. Locked one, instantly all eleven ships immediately warped off. Ganked one, and it kept flying back into the icebelt as a pod.
---
Sent this info to CCP and the problem went away.
---
if i understand how defending a region works, i'm supposed to unanchor all of our keepstars now right
---
Do you report them via the ingame tool "report a bot" button or do you send a support ticket to CCP?
---
One is definitely a lot faster, and the other one while being more work, usually means you'll get a response at least.
---
More like 8 for me. Glad I didn't miss it.
---
Ah interesting, didn't know they had that much variance. I used to run 6/10 - 10/10 all the time and did enjoy the thrill of getting a good drop.
---
nothing matters no one can win everything is irrelevant, etc. etc.
---
that's a long winded way to say already replaced
---
how do you get concord lp?
---
im a newbro so idk
---
Yeah I suppose the north has to celebrate ever hint of victory they can crumble together.
---
The site works just fine? Its currently the only one that works without bugging out.
---
its just not pretty.
---
I wouldn't exactly call that a seven day campaign considering how many months of incredible effort was put into that to make it possible.
---
They're coupled anyway, Plex converts to sp.  If people will buy injectors for 1b, lowering the cost of extractors will just increase profit on SP farms.  So more farms will get created, until things balance again, which will be a mix of cheaper injectors and more expensive Plex.
---
All these items go up in price because it's easier to make isk in the game and/or fewer people are buying them for real money.
---
Yep it's always nice to get free drones. My highlight from this is a gecko, but I also have several Augmented drones that I collected in HS this way.
---
And scanning the sigs in system with combat probes is a good way to scare off other explorers.
---
Thats funny

/u/jibberish  why has this post been hidden

The "EAT MY ASS" War!!!
---
All i can see is that you managed to kill some Alphas in T1 FYF Ships. Nothing interesting here lol
---
&gt;pursue Goons at the end of WWB
---
please follow the narrative, PGL confirmed, it's Casino Wars.
---
What I don't understand is PLEX volume hasn't gone up, its remained pretty constant for a very long period of time yet the price has continued to rise. Is it just yet to find its true value? It seems like volume has nothing to do with its actual value in a broader timeline.

The high angle weapons available to dreads, less dos but better tracking

I too want to stabilize Extractors and Injectors. Death is a stable condition btw
---
Just use the in-game function, not sure why you'd create more work for both yourself and CCP by submitting a ticket like that.
---
&gt;be me, have 25 dudes in USTZ
---
&gt; 35 dudes keep coming to my space at 13:00 EVE time and shooting rats / mining, the timer gets shifted. We could pull 4-5 guys to defend at that time, which isn't enough.
---
&gt;we get fucked even though the numbers balance is close enough full group on full group because my guys have jobs unless we spend 4-5 hours counter-krabbing instead of roaming, pvping, or generally having fun

&gt;quit eve

Outstanding move!

You could check the static image export https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources

It has some icons that are not in use anymore.

If it was properly placed on the rack, yes. If he put the nos on the far left or far right of his high slots then it would only offset the heat from one gun.

And you're as ignorant as always. I actually know that guy, he literally has my name as his tag on another discord
---
Stick to serving your corp and not being weird.
---
So you know nothing about the topic? Awesome! Good talk!
---
You want to lower prices? flood the market.
---
having plex and arum was stupid, makes more sence to have a single currency for both
---
I mean I normally just mail security directly as I have that option as a CSM member, but I would recommend using the report function, yes.
---
Are SP farms viable these days?  I had a bunch when they first came out but when I left the game last year they had become less viable, but as I wad browsing the market and crunching the numbers (I lost my old spreadsheet and won't be making a new one for a while) it actually looked like they were somewhat viable.
---
so you have nothing worth saying so you come here to insult people ? fuck off.

nice

I used to do that in the past with shady players who I wanted to give context or simply more info on. Few words can go a long way as to what to keep an eye on if its not 99% obvious as to why they were reported.
---
Plus, its nice to get an reply. Makes it bit more rewarding.
---
Nothing like being on vacation the first few days of the event :)
---
There are several links and I think the main one is PLEX -&gt; SP -&gt; Injectors via skill farms, so that's what CCP would need to look at. I don't think you ought to be able to repeatedly extract the 'same' SP.
---
yes, months of effort went into making it possible. that being said, the campaign itself and all the fighting took place over 7 days.
---
injector price = extractor price + sub price. sub price = plex price.
---
Correct
---
People like to move the market, both up and down, in order to then be able to profit from the movement. I see it quite often with implants, another low volume high price market. In this case someone is offloading some extractors to push the market down so they can rebuy them at a lower price.
---
Do you believe that a few fights in delve Will make us comeback? Wait for us in your home door
---
I'm just here to have fun not feel my penis grow from being some pawn in a fake war going nowhere.
---
It's silly not to report.
---
If you ran a t3 and use an mtu to get the extractors you very reliably come out with at least 25 mil
---
Oyy!, are you in Panfam and scared of being kicked by goons to shit on other alliances ? 
---
From what I heard Slyce was dead already, about 13 capsuleer in fleet , and all good corp already joined long ago TEST.
---
Last I saw a couple of weeks ago, you nearly break even unless you operation is very large.
---
But someone had to build everything.... And doing everything in house on a massive scale is much more efficient than buying off public market. That is why y'all are so far behind. You're too busy trying to pretend you are too elite to have people that  mine and build using your space. Meanwhile the MER really shows the truth that living and using your space is the best way. All that mined ore... All that bounty isk... Where do you think it is going?
---
Not to jita, that's for sure. It's going into our military might.

---
Why stop the video right before at least letting us see the best part? Rude :/
---
Even worse than the depot monuments.
---
Good advice there
---
It is both an inflation hedge and will always be in demand. CCP simply needs to offer more sales more often.
---
Our opinion on space hasn't changed in a decade. Yes it has value but we can create value wherever we are.
---
Just look at your list of blues, take cfc alliances off and that's most likely everyone
---
When you have more isk than you know what to do with, you buy PLEX with it and just hold.  
---
In theory if CCP put a huge isk sink in the game you might see a ton of PLEX being liquidated but i doubt that will happen.
---

Makes me wonder why you are yet to start in the north
---
hi redalert447
---
What do you call renters?
---
Hi eve spectre
---
I would have believed this before the official CCP report
---
The main issues with citadels are:
---
- defenders choose the time AND day of the exit timer (the exact time being random) 
---
- there are too many timers (3 instead of 2)
---
- the span of those timers (up to 9 days) is too long
---
- timers take too long uncontested 
---
If defenders could only pick the tz, and attackers determined the day, you could create weekend timers and pre-ping and stay up late etc. If there were one fewer timers, and the span was shorter (say 3 days), more fights would happen more often, because hyper blobbing would be harder and urgency would be greater.
---
Citadels should:
---
- have timers where the defender chooses the tz, and the attackers choose the day
---
- at full power have 2 timers not 3, and at low power just 1
---
- have timer span of 3 days, not 9, so timers have urgency and it doesn't take literal weeks to get anything done
---
- have timers that take 15 minutes at damage cap 
---
None of these things require any coding changes or fundamental adjustments to citadel mechanics. They're all just variable attributes and a question of high-level game design, not code-level work. Collectively, they would make prosecuting wars significantly more enjoyable.
---
There is so much shitty grind in the current set of timer mechanics. Don't get me started on the hour-long ihub refs.
---
Adding up a lot of small ones doesn't make it a big one. PanFam still #1 in content
---
An inefficient excuse to utilizing space.
---
They use the space, we get a cut, we get to PVP. I think you're starting to see that we just want content/PVP.
---
Yes, and krabs dying in Delve is a very good way of increasing Goon morale.
---
Ha! Look at those stupid krabs dying because they aren't deployed! Let me add their lossmail to the Wall Of Shame app.
---
And yet you refuse to make an arrange that makes you more money and gives you more things to fight?
---
You forgot about a lot since WWBee, to think NC. Haven't done massive deployments since then. Also using goons F1 monkey army to push your broken agenda doesn't make it looks like it benefits anyone but yourself.
---
Can you provide an example on what you're searching for? I don't think you clearly articulated what to substitute.
---
Repackage it?
---
To be honest, null is usually bottom tier content for a lot of wormholers.
---
Why would I mine if I already have the BEST source of income? Others feel the same way too.
---
Only if you one it would grow. 😋
---
So let me get this right ... Horde have been moaning like hell all year about having no content and EvE is stagnating ... Goons go out of there way to provide content in the north and Horde have decided to blap a minimally defended area ... is this really Horde's idea of good content? If this is the case may I suggest Hi-sec ratting .... OR GROW SOME BALLS!
---
Like I said earlier, this is your biggest problem. You think YOU need to mine while the answer is right in front of you.
---
It'll be DLC in a week.
---
Good to know, so I'll just get my main 3 accounts up and running and leave all the others in alpha
---
Its true though, just like TEST.
---
I was just a line member, so no real idea...but it did get fucking tedious watching my prot/guard combo slow mo through tidi space for 2 hours just to spend the next 12 wondering if I had decycled my guns/reps between eon length ticks.

i wonder if there alpha clones....
---
TBF bombers bar doing bombing runs like these is pretty rare. Nice. They should do more.
---
if you stop being able to buy game time, and extractors, with plex... sure.
---
that's the only way to do it.
---
I'm going to buy plex for game time, which increases demand and thus price. i'm going to turn that gametime in to SP which will be extracted when i buy extractors, which increases demand and thus price. 
---
the reason i'm doing the above? because everyone's buying injectors because reasons, increasing demand and thus price.
---
I'm sorry that i wasn't all that clear where and what i did, so here's perhaps a better explanation:
---
In ppl&amp;places change to "Search Systems", in the "Search Box" type "alt(94)" followed by"The" i.e "alt(94)The" and change "Search by" with "Partial Terms", this will get you all systems that starts with "The" resulting in 4 systems that starts with "The" .
---
Or change the search criteria to character keeping the "Partial Terms' and type "alt(94)Lord Maldor" resulting in 2 characters that starts with "Lord Maldor".
---
Since my knowledge of regex is as i said limited then my way of  searching with regex are also limited. I'm almost certain with a bit more knowledge with regex one can get a more precise result.
---
Are we really going to act like Eve isn't *Dumb Mindless Destruction: The Game*
---
Dumb mindless hisec mining. How fun and interesting amiright
---
Newbro reads??
---
There's a lot of spin especially from test about what happened after the war. In order to get the real story you have to look at the raw facts:
---
The MBC was united almost exclusively by money. Many of the alliances in the MBC had relationships with one another ranging from semi-hostile to being outright enemies with one another.
---
The MBC's stated goal was to evict and or destroy goonswarm. They evicted goons, split their coalition, and camped them into a station in lowsec for over a month. Goons were utterly crushed. There was no content left in fighting them.
---
It's incredibly hard to actually kill an alliance outright without a dedicated effort over an extremely long period of time. XIX and SKillu were at war for what, almost 2 years? And despite losing so badly XIX still exists (in test's kennel with their other pets anyway). WWB/CW was compared to most wars in eve's history over pretty quick, and yet despite this internal friction among MBC member alliances was already pretty high and the general attitude of linemembers varied dramatically.
---
Nobody in the MBC coalition possibly with the exception of Test and the alliances that would later form legacy had any intention of remaining blue in such a game crippling megacoalition anyway. It was basically the entirety of non-cfc nullsec. The MBC was not built nor intended to last.
---
So, knowing this, why didn't ncpl follow goons to delve? Basically at that point goons were shitty content and there was better opportunities.
---
Looks like war's abrewin' in nullsec. So my question is: after these big battles, is it just the winning side salvaging and looting the wrecks, or are the big alliances generally fine with scavengers following behind and picking from the remains? I know it certainly wouldn't be safe to do so (because EVE) but it sounds fun, and pirates picking off scavengers would be at least possible to avoid, unlike null bloc salvage crews
---
"The guns...they've stopped..."
---
people like this is the reason eve is shit rn, stop with all the bad ideas already
---
Thanks, looking!
---
TCUs are worthless in the sov game. its the ihubs that are important
---
People like you are the reason why Eve is shit right now. Stop taking low effort pot shots at people trying to brainstorm ways to improve the game. Even better, biomass and go back to WoW.
---
When I ran incursions I used to combat scan for drones while waiting to get into fleets. 
---
Mostly T2 drones, but the occasional gecko and faction drone too. 
---
Once you've got a few, just throw them back on the market for that sweet incursion focus markup.
---
Yes you should, hah
---
The unexpected downtime kept you from logging in from scheduled downtime to scheduled downtime? A full 23 hours?
---
This is the last day of being able to claim, it is all based on downtime resetting the "days" not your local time.  17 hours until the next Downtime, ending the campaign.  If you were not on the last one after downtime today then you are out of luck, sorry.
---
Tossing out retarded ideas isnt brainstorming.
---
It literally doesn't matter what the other side is flying, when they die before they can lock you back.
---
The keyword being intelligent, here. Worthless krabs dying in Delve are irrelevant.
---
Yeah, it was fun to get a flashback to my time in Provi :)
---
Stop posting.
---
Lmao retard
---
GoTG/Dead Co. is a soulless construct like I said earlier. You are in it for selfish reasons (the renters prove it). Of all the post-WWB coalilitions, it has always been the weak power. It both failed to grow over time (growth) and too many weak allies and easily flushed others out.
---
Dead Co. has been a revolving door for partners since WWB. I don't even think any others besides Darkness is left. Which means there is a rot in the system somrwhere or poor choices in decisions. Also there is no cultural mythos. Panfam has theirs and so do Test and Goons. Dead Co. has no character. What other person beside Sort is known? What in group memes do they have?
---
last of all, never forshadow your own name. Dead Coalitilion is both a bad choice due to what it implies but also due to how GoTG got it. The name came enemies and Sort picked the name in sarcasm. This also proved a self fulfilling prophecy by that. It doesn't truly have its own name. It is just a force looking avoid entropy like its name states.
---
Lmao

Here's an image: https://imgur.com/a/VDGapxA

oh i came
---
You literally don't know what literally means
---
I admit every Alliance have those kind of players. So i wouldnt care too. But since Mittani claimed its good enemys come to delve to deliver killmails all over you'r places didnt aged very long
---
Good question
---
&gt;I loved the war with october snow and the ginger magician
---
I love the little events in EVE like this. The things that don't make the NER and don't get massive Reddit threads but that still are important.
---
Sorry, not sorry for feeling bad for a coalition of 30k+ members and there lack of content.
---
The tears are real
---
please click your notifications
---
I mean in some ways he is right, TAPI has always had to suck up to some power. Then they get used by the power and suck up to another, it's an endless cycle.
---
What is this nonsense?
---
Great suggestions, that the PLooNS and their blobtards will quickly shoot down in flame as it would impact their "control" of empty spaces.
---
Panfam gave quite a bit in the fight to save GOTG only to be shafted by Sort. It's not even good to have GOTG as allies these days.
---
Because of your text. Not problem-oriented, just rude and aggressive.
---
I play EVE on a shitty laptop and have no issues. Fuck off you retarded cunt.
---
Thank you for your post based on nothing at all.
---
Can someone explain this to me? If not that’s also ok
---
this is some bullshit
---
&gt; Also, I work in IT
---
God, how have you not been fired yet

Yes, they approved. Thanks for asking, I should state this in the post!

I don't spend my time crying on reddit, unless there is a war this place is boring.

Fuck yeah, reward 2/16, i still got 14 more days

I think you need to get some sleep
---
He overheated his guns so much that they broke and can't kill the enemy ship which is almost dead.
---
Neutral scavengers are openly disparaged for expecting to profit from a battle they didn't even participate in. You can expect to be shot, so be nimble and prepared.
---
[Spod bless retards and their isk](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72451621/)
---
God forbid you put 30 seconds into elaborating why
---
The point of this is to give them value...? Did you read the post?
---
Asher doesn't like fighting for fights sake. He wants to hit objectives and you can't really do that from wormholes.
---
Why would we want to stabilize them?
---
I wish I could get into null sec without dying instantly,, but I play eve and my character is pretty skilled.
---
If they dont make you come back, then no reason to stop either way, lol.
---
Can I have some?
---
We got him banned as he got his mothership stolen when they weren’t 10 a penny then we got told which system he was jumping to, to blow it up so we intercepted him and he went mental threatening to find out our addresses and murder us haha
---
Seems all the pirates now call themselves mercenaries
---
lol shit. This happened on one of my accounts too.
---
I claimed day 15 with 21 hours left in the event, but only 15 hours until the next day in Eve time. Thought I might have a chance to catch it tonight after downtime.
---
Oh well, easy come easy go.
---
i think thats a good idea
---
Thank you so much
---
Because they were given out as part of an event. The limited time icon means they were only available for a limited time.
---
I like the analysis you put forth. I think botting anomalies is probably the easiest of these issues CCP **needs** to solve.
---
The move away from bounties to playing most of the value on Overseer loot is sound. It even falls in love with the wspace ratting that CCP implemented years ago to combat that a bit.
---
As a follow-on to the Overseer loot idea and to further slow the process, or at least force completion of the site to collect value I would suggest two changes:  
---
1) Add a structure the tackles everything in the site which cannot be destroyed
---
2) Cloak the Overseer. This NPC will remain cloaked "until his/her forces are almost destroyed". At which point the Overseer will decloak, deactivate the tackle structure, and attempt to flee the site.
---
This will force players/bots to commit. It will also mean hunting these targets won't require the "shotgun" approach of warping to what you guess is the target because that isn't hunting that is just being lucky and guessing the right anom. Counter play for groups who wish to hunt the hunters is also preserved since all it takes is a ship(s) that can tank the damage to look like a target.
---
Good old prison wallet.
---
Buffer, that many svipuls risks alphing through your reps to make the nightmare bleed through it's active tank.
---
It'll be a test of my newbie pilotting skills, then. I'll fly something extra expendable
---
I reinstalled as soon as I saw the event happening in part because of the dope event rewards. Turns out I reinstalled a day too late for the skill points.

Feels bad man, I know your pain.

Honestly, I do not think it would change anything a decent Cyno will have it lit before the enemies are even out of there warp. This would be nothing we could not play around. 
---
 What are you hoping this would achieve?
---
So you a saying Horde should suicide its ships against a 50 times bigger supercap fleet, onGoon terms, wherever and whenever Goons want... or “we have no balls”.  
---
You do understand how idiotic that sounded, right? And since when Horde has been moaning for content? :D
---
Horde space is and has always been the best pvp region in the game by far,
---
Probably curtail some of the bait ships, like gnosis that wait until they have you scrammed (or you have them scrammed) before they light a cyno. Or remove the ability for gate camps to light a cyno from a HIC if you scram them with an inty as your gang comes through.
---
Its not a terrible idea, would certainly make fitting scrams a better idea in gang comps. In the scheme of things, not sure if its enough, but not a bad "shower thought". As you mentioned, doesn't really effect fleet fights since they just uncloak/warp in and instantly light a cyno, but would help provide counterplay to the annoying cyno bait ships that are everywhere.
---
Basically you whining the enemy is not fighting on your terms?
---
Heh, that is an easy fix. Add stront as a requirement to citadel timers. No stront, no timers, goes straight to a kill. Just like poses. Rewards repeated reinforcement efforts, makes defenders at least do marginal defending (restronting), and aids cleanup of unattended citadels.
---
They sell those built in the south on market FYI
---
People love using supercaps when there’s little risk of losing them.
---
That's why they keep posting about killing ships in Delve, waiting for the slope to begin. Meanwhile, there is a great disturbance in the force up north.
---
I recommend an imicus. Scanning bonus is good for escapes, lots of cargo space for a frigate, cheap, and a salvage bonus. The big ISK is going to come from the supercap and titan wrecks, that usually have faction and meta modules that are small and expensive, like a-type enams or invulins that go vir several bil. Salvaging will be a little more difficult, because you can’t salvage a wreck with more stuff than can fit in one can, but plenty of dictors and subs die to give you plenty of wrecks.
---
What makes them really good is combined with stuff like PI, or afk VNI ratting
---
ahah EVS, recognized the logo immediately :)
---
I work at catering and several times a year we deliver / have banquet at their HQ in Belgium, everytime I am there &amp; see that logo I think to myself if there isn't a guy in the 300 dudes working here that is not playing eve then there is smth wrong.
---
... what?
---
what does this do to mitigate blob warfare?
---
What?
---
Ok yes, I see the use case. I think it would have to be at least a tech 2, not just any warp scrambler.
---
it makes it possible for smaller, TZ-limited groups to take unused sov without having to alarm clock for it. 
---
And yes

Welp squad (who I have flown with on many occasions) in goonswarm suicide all the time ... because it's content ... ie fun. Maybe it's just me thinking that blaping in an undefended area is boreing .... might aswell rat in hi-hec.
---
It's nothing compared to undocking.  Suddenly you have shield and armour and capacitor and modules to activate and that massive confusing overview thing with all those places you can warp to.  Just so annoying.
---
I think there are still self-identified pirates, but EVE is a different place now and such players have had to adapt to keep up.
---
They tried, hellcamping goon for month in lowsex. Only test followed goon in delve (remember that please goon when you do shitty nip)
---
You need enemy in eve to have fun (fight), so killing ennemy is not important.
---
Also like the deal with gotg and after wwb sometimes you need peace because :
---
- burnout of fc / linemember
---
-like i say first : you still need ennemy. Enemy is content. Blue donut is cancer.
---
-work was made (goon was out of dekklein, gotg were broken)
---
-you have more fun doing something else (dealing with test / co2 for wwb, dealing with ph / nc after last year.)
---
Just as boring as being one more cap on a full fleet of them, knowing full well that no one can match that.
---
You might as well rat in hi sec, right? :D
---
what?????
---
what if you just stopped posting
---
Is there a story behind this? I just searched and absolutely nothing popped up.
---
You could join a faction and run faction warfare sites. Sell sell the lp or buy shit to sell with it. 
---
You could hunt explorers or vnis or something and sell the loot you collect from kills. You could boosh excavators from rorqals and sell them.
---
The old ones are often the best

what?

No problem man.

Some supers/titans do go to market, yes. The majority go directly from builder to buyer and never touch the market. And yes, people do pay isk for them, but the bottleneck to super production is not isk or buyers, it is available ore.

How is 16 days a tight window? That's half a month, all you have to do is log in click some shit and log out. Its 2019 you can screen view your PC from your phone. Literally don't have to be home and can accomplish this. Plus it's free, CCP isn't obligated to give us any of it.

We get on comms, drink heavily, play other games, argue politics, and make fun of people.

Is there a way to make these things instawarp? I want to use one as a camera vehicle to go around to fights.
---
yeah but how is the raven guy still out there tho
---
That's what you get for krabbing during a deployment
---
There's no need for that.
---
Well, theres not supercap umbrella anymore.
---
So...
---
&gt;LOOK AT US KILLING IDIOTS WHILE THE BIGGEST SUPER CAPITAL FLEET IN EVE PREPARES TO BURN OUR HOME C'MON WE ARE DEALING DAMAGE AND NOT BEING DESPERATE!
---
there is a creative director.
---
see the scarecrow in the seat?  they pass all design decisions by him.
---
if he dislikes it,  he blows it off the table.   i should also mention they never turn the fan off in this room
---
just have the guristas cyno in a full komodo fleet and nuke everything :P
---
No need for your post either tbh
---
Ya, Its always good to bring a set of normal Probes for harder to scan sites. That extra "Level" can often mean the difference between scanning them and not.
---
Why am I hearing the theme to "Mr. Roger's Neighborhood" in my head when I read this thread?
---
XD someone told me that too, but I've never actually been out that way.
---
# wow why cant you just leave them alone, what did they ever do to you!
---
free killmails for me
---
I wonder when the krabs will get the message that it's not safe anymore. 
---
Probably after they die.
---
Just logged back on after four years to check out if playing an alpha account is worthwhile. Jumped in a frigate, fought some NPC pirates, and left before recalling my drones.
---
Fitted a drone launcher and went back out to find them. Scanned the system up, down and all around. Drones were nowhere to be found. Did they get taken that fast? Do they disappear on their own, or am I missing something in the attempt to find them?
---
They are being fucking idiots. That's why they deserve to die.
---
If there is no limit on what can turn off my MJD/MWD, there shouldn't be a limit on the cyno. A t1 scram shuts off my MWD/MJD just like a T2 does.
---
Where things get interesting is that you could change warp core stabilizer warp core strength to effect cyno strength/resistance. Repurposes them so they aren't just the bot/farmer lowslot of choice. So technically you can still make a bait ship, but you sacrifice tank (lows) to prevent your cyno from getting scrammed. So you can't have a max tank bait ship and have to sacrifice if you don't want your cyno cancelled out by a single scram.
---
Of course this is all just spitballing ideas, but it seems somewhat reasonable and doesn't actually effect fleet/logistics like a spool up cyno would.
---
When they get it? Before the deployment.
---
When they understand it? never.
---
Well retards will retard.... nothing new there.
---
This returning noob in EUNI is now on a famous kill mail because of this :)

---
Also, someone offered me big ISK for your corpse but I didn't grab it :P
---
That they are. Which raises the question, why is it supposedly worth a thread?
---
Because it's a shit ton of expensive things dying.
---
Burn? home?  Don't let the bells drive you crazy Khaleesi :(
---
&gt;How many more weeks days hours until the Delve losses exceed the cost of the pulled rigs in the North?
---
It's scary some people even think worthless krabs dying is comparable to getting ones home burned to the ground.
---
Geckos are Rare, but they happen. I've only ever found 1 though...orz... People leave their Augmented drones quite a bit more than I thought they might, though.
---
XD not had that happen yet, though I'd not be surprised.
---
Ah, so it's a "limited availability" icon, not a "limited lifespan" one.
---
That makes sense now, and the confusion to as the first time I ever saw that icon was on those early stats boosters which were limited lifespan.
---
Angry Concord Guy is the creative director!
---
How would you propose fixing the market?
---
You actually whining your enemies dont engage your cap fleet on your terms? Damn, mate.
---
I'm not whining about anything. Just pointing how hilarious this northern damage control is.
---
&gt;We are no longer protecting dumb krabs while they krab 
---
&gt;Dumb krabs die by krabbing dumbly

*Surprised pikachu face*
---
Why do johny come lately devs insist on ruining our game?
---
This is so retarded an idea. The game doesn't need to continuously be made less challenging and easier to farm.
---
oh god oh no oh fuck not my house mr goon pls no pls pls pls i piss and shidd my pant pls no
---
why the fuck would you gate a titan into a fleet of bombers
---
Hmmm someone missed the memo it seems.
---
I don't think so. There was a position posted a few months back, not sure it got filled.
---
The Shittanis memo about not reporting people who might be bots because they might not be? CCP investigates that shit, there's no harm in reporting someone who you THINK is a bot.
---
It's impossible to finish anyone in Eve ... now more than ever, with citadels and asset safety, but even before that once they've managed to move to NPC space. In lowsec (like Saranen) you can't even bubble camp them.
---
However, it was a very poor move to essentially give them Delve completely unsupervised and not even try to harass their economic setup. Goons didn't develop an unassailable capital umbrella from nowhere.
---
Inb4 "but the delve krab zones are their home!"
---
They're literally taking out our trash for us and policing pur deployment, punishing people who refused to come fight. And now there's like 20 reddit posts of "hurr durr we're hurting em so good" for a loss not even one thousandth of the worth of our initial deployment fleets. 
---
I'm happy delve is seeing fights and content but the constant bragging over it ridiculous.
---
&gt; Don't think I'm the only one with issues with the launcher...
---
That is an entirely unrelated issue regarding how Windows interfaces with the EVE Launcher
---
&gt; Also, I work in IT... I've tried all the normal stuff like virus scans, start up programs etc.
---
What sort of IT do you work in? If it's tech support then, remember that customer you had that was really annoying and blaming everything on the company that you work for and yourself? That's you. You're being that customer.
---
Be you and think 25 guys is enough people to hold sov in 2019 eve...
---
And a week later you are complaining about getting blobbed by supers.
---
Risky search of the day
---
It's scary some people even think that Goons will have the stamina to burn the North "to the ground".
---
The northern damage control went into overdrive before anything even died in the north. Think it's a new record?
---
When you heat grouped guns, they all take the same heat damage. Uneven heat damage only becomes the case if you: 1) ungroup them; 2) split them into different groups; 3) heat other modules on the high power rack.  
---
Go and try shoot something with grouped guns, repair them, then try the same with ungrouped ones by activating them while you locking the target (to make sure they all start at the same server tick).
---
Can you make your screenshot wider?
---
And what happened last time it was questioned?
---
Pyfa is a great tool for fits and I can only recommend giving it a try
---
I'll boson them
---
2 minutes later
---
Uh can we get another Titan in here to boson them?
---
I use the term loosely, but in comparison to the other two options they are. PL has been reduced to random dread bombs on ratters in delve and flying bomber fleets for strategic timers Meanwhile Horde STILL hasn't figured out that you can't leave free move on and leave wing commander spots open when you are in an alliance that makes zero efforts to combat spys in fleet.
---
That is the widest it can be without the window being wider than my screen.
---
They had to rip down their entire home region so I suppose they have to try to win at *something*.
---
you're trying way to hard
---
yes, and the tcu will still be useless with your proposed changes.
---
I see you have a similar problem to me. Why doesn't the color tag work when renaming overview presets?
---
Natural selection at it's finest I see. Must either be the spod or the krabs being too used to an umbrella to protect them, they have no idea what to do without one ;););)
---
Goons killed 2 keepstars then packed up and went home because they got blue balled, I doubt they even get one keepstar this time around. Theres no one in the north to fight. #blueballsbestballs
---
2? Your math is a "bit" off.
---
Then why you whine now? :D
---
http://www.eveworkbench.com
---
Not looking for a Tool, but rather a Fitting list, something to give ideas for what to play around with, or share fits with others. &lt;.&lt; Unless this HAS that function...
---
Well, apparently yours is pretty bad as well, hahaha.
---
And what damage control? I dont think anyone believes this will end in any other way than a Goon victory.
---
But here you are, whining that your enemies dont want to fight you on your terms.
---
For the life of me I can't stop sansha rats from targeting my first heavy drone when I go to a new site. I've tried the 'going to a celestial and ejecting out of my ship' thing, ive tried fitting a burst ECM module, and I still lose a drone almost every site. Any ideas on how to get NPC's to stop fucking with my praetors?
---
Gotta dscan for geckos as you warp through every system!
---
Everyone wins.
---
Wonder if we'll kill more Goon stuff than Goons will kill NC stuff in this "war".
---
Control what damage?
---
Point me damage in Delve that is other than in the brain of those morons krabbing?
---
There is only one war that matters.
---
Not everyone wants to babysit highsec miner type players and eliminate all day to day content within reasonable range for the sake of inflating numbers.
---
You might want to do some research, the numbers much higher
---
give a minimum price for orders. 
---
eg I place my order at 10-20M isk . Nobody is selling so it goes to 20M.  then someone else place orders at 13-15M : his orders are set at 13M and mine at 12.999999M. after all mine are sold, his go back to 15M.
---
The broker fee are set on the max value, not the minimum. The tax are paid on real value sold.
---
Also, prevent people from updating orders more than once per day. You misplace an order ? you will change it tomorrow.
---
Can't wait to see the MER for may :)
---
You tell me, I’m not the one whining with CAPS Lock on. :D
---
I found 2 in two-days. It depends on the systems you're scanning down though. Big L4 hubs are great for picking up abandoned drones.
---
**THE BELLS**
---
Because that's exactly how it has happened in Delve, and no person mining has his own super ready to drop with the rest in defense.
---
And how no fleet leaves delve because we are all tied to sitting in tether waiting to protect our miners.
---
Is this actually how people think it works?
---
inb4 hurr durr damage control koolaid spin, nothing of value was lost, didnt want those anyway
---
the initial move north had so much hardware in it that what you have killed so far amounts to a rounding error in the total numbers of what we can field.
---
You mean you tried looking for them with a probe launcher? You need to be using combat probes instead of regular scanning probes. To use combat probes you also need the larger expanded probe launcher as well.
---
I guess the down voter didn't see deadpool 2
---
You can also use the list view in the inventory to copy the things out to evepraisal. Both the Larger views don't let you but the list view does
---
Krab kills don't count !!!
---
because they actually do have the stamina for it
---
Just joined Goons and on my first trip in with a handful of BPO's in the hold (that I forgot about), I jumped in to a gate brawl. Lots going on, excitment got the better of me and I engaged. I'm quickly locked up, remember my cargo and get the heck outta there! Exciting times!!
---
I never contribute to home defense on my botting super lol
---
you cant fix stupid
---
Im personally pretty tired of these event log in campaigns they need to make it total log ins not between x and y times. It punishes us for having a life punishes us for not being tied to a PC.

I hope you message a GM about it. If enough of us do it they might get the hint that these things are dumb. Im all for rewards but Not for playing when they say I have to.
---
Nvm even more reason to just keep rolling alts..
---
I'm pretty sure that someone cares but, like, no one else does
---
Isnt his name like CCP Manborn or something?
---
Whining and pointing out how hilarious the northern damage control is are two quite different things.
---
I'd be honored to be ganked by them

---
Good for you? perhaps that's why north is, like I said, like a shriveled dick.
---
&gt; have been in alliances for a long time degenerate and are incapable of organizing stuff themselfes.
---
people vastly underestimate the work behind getting the content in the first place, and how much practice actually weights on those things
---
&gt;	Long Application wait times to keep the blood pure
---
Sounds like the SS.
---
That explains it. Yes, I had a normal probe launcher laying around and used that. I hadn't even thought about using a dedicated combat probe launcher.
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks for the tips o7
---
weird, i could swear i was deployed in delve and blobbing supers meself... oh well
---
Does it even make a difference? The MER will show i guess.
---
Killing anything that isn't too retarded to read pings?
---
Huh?
---
1 excavator = 1 new raitarus to bash
---
Krabs always die. Every time goons have ever deployed, people kill them and think somehow anyone is going to care. 
---
The only impact it has is the tax from the ratting of the krabs doesn't get to the wallet. That portion of income is irrelevant to them. You hurt Pubbie J. Krab Esq., not the alliance or coalition as a whole. 
---
Get loot and make some bank, but don't kid yourself that you are having any meaningful impact lol.
---
dunno, they all look the same on my kb
---
I believe he's talking about all the acceleration gates, some missions have 3-5 of them.
---
Are you really so retarded I need to explain my post to you?
---
Because it’s fun to shoot idiots and post about it. Never not post my man.
---
Blue alliance.
---
How do my actions affect the north?
---
Wut
---
No problem. You'll find them quite easily even with crappy scanning skills I think since you'll see 5 of your drones clumped together. There's also a dedicated reconnect to lost drones shortcut key which depending on if you use it or not you might not have binded,  you can check under your options to set it to something.
---
Whoa mate, chill. Be carefull or people will think you mad you whine so much.
---
Still moving in tidi? Hows that goin for ya
---
I take that as a no, because there aren't many others in Delve atm.
---
Haha your not wrong
---
Did you use Combat Scanner Probes? Core Scanner Probes cannot detect Ships/Drones but if you use a Extended Drone Launcher it'll work
---
Yeah ok sure
---
StainGuy.
---
I simple yes would have been enough.
---
No idea lol. Would be nice to know.
---
Why?  It's not exactly going to surprise anyone is it.
---
Thought the north was the home of all botters?
---
Good time to burn some super carrier stockpile
---
Krabs gonna krab
---
I personally want to see the export/import numbers. Last year it was 15T imported to the frontlines and it looked like that much on the first move op.
---
Goons entire recruiting pitch the last two years has been about Delve being the best place to make money. Seems odd to see so much hostility directed from Goons towrads the people that are just there to make money.
---
They used to be quite often but CCP has gotten lazy and we havent had any for a while now. I think one will come soon
---
Dude, we live in tidi in Delve.
---
Oh yea, everything on the moveops will count.  My god...
---
&gt;2 keepstars 
---
nigga you baiting?
---
oh it will. Mainly because the bulk of miners is deployed.
---
send tickets to GM this stuff is dumb.
---
the alpha rewards were legit useless tokens instead of stuff that ould help out newbs. 
---
the login thing was bugged, i almsot missed out despite logging in every day.
---
It's easier to just run it in Delve lol !
---
it will take a hit but lve been stock piling since the last war so no need to mine l will just sit and wait for ore prices to go up and then sell and make more then in peace time
---
Ah this is much better! thank you!
---
After mining comes industrial capabilities. We already have these. What am I missing?
---
Can't argue with that, as it's a mathematical truth.
---
Darwinism in Delve, thinning the herd mentality
---
I like how you two just talk to each other. Feels like AAA.
---
CCP Burger isn't it?
---
Darwin awards abound
---
Best thing is they call it "North Damage Control" but only goons respond to say "Uuuh krab no care we have much more".
---
I love when a 34K alliance (without counting pets) is flexing the "We have more shit than you" on a 6K NCPL north.
---
Killing shit north you will, nobody can oppose such a force. Losing more than you will destroy ? We'll see.
---
querns I missed you
---
look at the op, the last line especially - poor Asher self-victimizes over having to delay the war 4 months.
---
the reason? totally because of timezone tanking
---
surely if that were the case, and given his importance in goons, he would have contacted his CSM representatives and insisted they bring up the issue to ccp right? so where can we see this in the minutes?
---
saw the option to repackage, think that will let me get my ships out??
---
Precursor destroyer V, rapid firing V, and most of t2 siege
---
Yes.
---
Citadels cant warp away, they are super retarded, and you moving multiple regions to fight them.
---
You not so different, mate. :D
---
Please do not stop, my super/Titan sales numbers are skyrocketing
---
CN we get a thread that gets updated daily of the shit we lose to randoms? I dont check r eve often but i really enjoy seeing my fellow goons dying.
---
That's the yacht pilots name
---
Look at Delve.
---
Merge renters into the main alliance and keep them safe for the ratting taxes.
---
More krabs, more tax, more isk, more people and repeat.
---
?
---
i like the censoring of the name everywhere except right in the middle of the pic
---
So what is going to hurt us if we don't need to mine/build in our space? Last I checked, y'all actually need Delve to fund your move ops. I'm looking for evidence on how you all killing 140 bill structures is going "crush us".
---
There’s plenty of skirm FC’s who will step up and be sent on their Marry way with yackdaws or harpies and go take care of the smaller stuff.
---
There's a difference.
---
retards unable to read pings aren't replaced from the alliance wallet, unlike the structures that are about to die.
---
Fly a bhaalgorn: done
---
Murder an "elite solo" marauder: done
---
Dreadbomb: done, wanna do it again but actually kill the initial target...
---
Fly a crazy intensive triage carrier with combat refitting like the RNK videos: missed my chance
---
Smart bomb gank an NPSI fleet: done
---
Boson an entire fleet: still can't afford a titan
---
Fly an orthrus: Probably tonight actually.
---
There should be an opposite metric for the Delve Time Unit when they're deployed:
---
"You would have to kill x keepstars a day to stay isk positive vs delve losses..."
---
Then why don't you stop us? Please share what you're going to accomplish by killing a few of our keepstars?
---
Hello yoda?
---
I’m retarded because you whine? Ok. :D
---
Just browse  [https://zkillboard.com/](https://zkillboard.com/)  for fits.
---
Type name of your desired ship in the "search" box - if you are looking to get a feel for pvp solo fits for example just go the "solo" tab on the ships page and in there you will see both wins &amp; losses.
---
XD WEW LAD
---
I'm not commenting on Goon organization at all with that post.  I'm saying comparing organizational efficacy to the military is not a compliment.
---
That is not an option due to security. No unvetted entity should have access or knowledge to inner alliance workings. #1 rule of fight club is always in effect.
---
I didn't say let them into the leadership circles, I said keep them as part of the main bulk.
---
I just like to see the goons fall from grace
---
There were 1100 NC in local yesterday when they were all in the same system.
---
Now, they're not going to pilot 1100 ships in a fight, but neither are Goons going to pilot 4000.  Assuming RL abilities to afford a good computer are equal in both groups, you could expect combat ops to be smaller in terms of characters than move ops, but to scale proportionately.
---
So, for a combat op NC forms 500, you would expect Goons to form 2000 then--when if they had the same turnout as NC they could form 5k for a single timer.
---
It's just interesting to think about IMO.  Wonder how those numbers will stack in 3 years.
---
Hahaha, retard citadels dont rat and contribute taxes to the alliance either, unlike the ratters that already dead.
---
https://o.smium.org/  Use to be a thing. Now dead.
---
Theres this dont know how update it is: https://fits.federatis.fr/
---
It's almost like there is an assumption that there is no Krabbing in Delve during deployment. Anyone out there is out for themselves, by themselves.
---
This guy is one of the biggest kool-aid chugging f1 monkeys on r/eve and has been since forever.
---
People bitch about rorq mining, but it's not the rorqs. It's the fucking *ratting*
---
Remove all filters/seach input should do it.
---
It's still embarrassing.
---
Thats the way. If they want to crab they wont have any protection. So when we guys loosing shit its on them. They where told to stop using expensive stuff.
---
2 Titans https://zkillboard.com/kill/76815508/
---
Why? Who cares.
---
Why wouldn't we be openly hostily towards the people who think of money when the coalition is out for war?
---
ur mom
---
.. yeah, for those being blown up, not the alliance. It's not like they're going to put the deployment on hold each time someone in a Rorq screams they're tackled.
---
No group would do that.
---
People who aren't halfwits understand that when an alliance deploys, takes down its umbrella and exports a few thousand caps to another region, the following monthly graph is going to look a little different.
---
Immanence appears to be a descriptor for color. Porevitium trace is the subject of on-going discussion, though theories tend toward something involving wormhole formation, jump/gate activity, and so on.
---
Make that 2 Titans, apparently they got bumped off the keepstar.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76815508/
---
Best just to do what all the other spineless players do and just join the goon blob. Go be a sheep.
---
We actually have a wall of shame somewhere.
---
But comparing personal losses (krabs in Delve) to Alliance losses (Structures in North) is a bit useless.
---
All went as planned with the content in all regione like the master told em
---
Having fun getting frags doesn't matter guys!
---
In my imagination i can hear the Bjorn Bee laugh when you told him :)
---
for once I agree with you
---
It's too late.
---
Try sending in a support ticket, but there's no guarantees.
---
IIRC a former corpmate from canada stole a rorqual from an XL SMA and guessing codes. 
---
And another stole a moros from someones astragus wreck.
---
this is a good post
---
Yeah... no. You answer wtf you were trying to say here, lazy ass. :D
---
50 ratting titans are of no consequence to anyone.  They basically don't count if they are never going to get used against someone.
---
Squizz should add "It would have lived if it were deployed" react on zkill
---
Just a compilation of fights and other activities from the last 2 and a bit months.
---
I was Dual/Triple boxing if not more for all of these clips so piloting errors have been made.
---
This has been my first "bigish" project in editing - my 2nd only video/editing ever really. Feedback is welcomed so I can keep improving. Been enjoying it so far. Shame EVE doesn't always co-operate however.
---
I record 2560 x 1440 Windowed clients and overlay the 2nd most active one in the bottom left (via OBS) so you can get a feel for what else is going on. When rendering the recording so I can edit it (using HandBrake to render and DaVinci Resolve to edit), I downscale to 1920x1080 to make it more fitting to what people have viewing wise
---
That's irrelevant
---
Imagine having so many drooling retards in your coalition and thinking it's perfectly fine
---
Skilled myself into a Hecate...
---
Really? Sure sounds like you're whining, Ghostile.
---
I don't know, at the rate titans die currently a bunch of people who bought titan BPOs for free money might be relieved. Post fax changes they will probably lose a few to dread bombs though carelessness during deployment. Give enough idiots titans and no matter how much you try to help them someone will fuck up enough to die.
---
The only embarassing thing is the stupidity or level of greed of of the people who keep on krabbing.
---
I've never seen it either. But term has been around forever.
---
The alliance recruitment standards and general competency is embarrassing.
---
This pretty much. I am just double face palming over how stupid people are.
---
... Thought this was me for a second.
---
Got my first yacht last week and loaded it up with all my blueprints to move it from a trade hub to my new home. 40+ jumps, 15ish through hostile null.
---
I was pretty tired when I started and well.. I woke up to my pod in home station wondering how the hell I got home so fast.
---
Protip, yachts aren't uncatchable if you fall asleep and your gate cloak runs out 🙂.
---
he drifted himself no bump involved
---
Remember, in EvE it's best to treat titans as ammo.
---
i had good day, add another titan on top of that too
---
The bigger the group the larger number of them is an idiot.
---
Considering the number of people deployed, the people dying is a fraction of it.
---
It would literally murder rorq saves: there is little chance the rorqual gets the cyno up before a bomber decloaks and scrams them. Also, it would literally force a rorq or other capital to put the cyno up the second heavy tackle hits grid and would make supers really hard to save. (So good stuff).
---
t2 guns for my Drek/Vedmak.
---
Perhaps if all you care about are killboards.
---
I don't really care about someone whose sole life is making isk. I'm also not surprised or embarrassed when they die.
---
But then again, you wouldn't give a gun to a person who gates a titan in Delve while everyone is deployed.
---
Not A Market Alt?  Bollocks
---
If we come back you'll run away.  So what's the point?
---
Gallente Cruiser 5.
---
Amazing https://i.imgur.com/dYwmCMQ.png
---
The most canonical lore book - EVE Source - gives the second explanation for the name. No idea where the other story comes from, but I have seen it being cited before.
---
Geez, you don't have to prove so enthusiastically that you've never been to the Big Boys table. It's quite off-putting -- I'm used to posters exhibiting at least *some* shame.
---
Because of unanchoring, losing job materials and rigs, it will be impossible tomsee what the North has already lost
---
dumb krabs or brave pvpers who don't need no backup blob?
---
I have been doing AUTZ fleets for the past few days because I can and am in USTZ. Going to sleep at 4:30 AM 4 days in the last 5 is bad for your sanity.
---
Maybe these idiots will get pissed because we didnt save them and leave the alliance. We can only hope.
---
Sounds good to me
---
This is when you convo the pilot and say "send x amount of isk or I will reactivate my guns"
---
I support this.
---
&gt; Wonder if we'll kill more Goon stuff than Goons will kill NC stuff in this "war".
---
that depends, will there be anything left anchored to kill by the time we get there?
---
apparently you can with a fleet of bombers.
---
Structures in the north are all personal as well.
---
hi sec
---
Delve is efefctively under NGDS (not goon don't shoot) rules since the umbrella is gone and it's truly amazing
---
if a handful of rorqs and a titan is a "shit ton" then you're dreaming too small, friend.
---
Sir, please put down the glue bottle

They count just as much as offensive kills / losses, so I imagine anyone interested in this war.

No. About the majority of bots banned being in northern renter groups.

Lots of useful things exist in EVE but are not enabled by default.

It helps when the people we are going to burn start taking their own stuff down and making the list of things to burn shorter for us.

2?.. Hell we killed 4 in one day at the end and that's not counting the X47 keep or the lowsec freeports, where did you learn to count?
---
Stay classy, Jita.
---
Yeah, I got that memo and saw the pie chart. It's the Chinese, man, it's what they do, they have a different culture than the rest of the world and it's fairly difficult to understand unless you go and live there for a year or two. Doesn't excuse them and hopefully CCP steps up their game. Doesn't change the fact that Shittani has repeatedly said not to report suspected bots because it's "anti-goon".
---
upvote/down vote bot farming Karma for Killary's next campaign.
---
you literally want a ship that does things the other mining barges already do
---
so my thoughts are you're asking for something completely redundant, which makes it a dumb idea.
---
While I do love ship variety what would it add. We already have one specific barge for each job.  Why would adding another ship help if it was just mediocre at each?
---
Nothing new Delve is a paradise for enemies right now.
---
All coalitions look fucking retarded when they can't get line members with enough braincells to not die. Simple enough, really.
---
I would rather have a few mining ship per ship class. That way it more of what do i want to take out.
---
check zkillboard losses, plenty of fits, just ignore renter ones.
---
Welcome to EVE, I guess?
---
I could see this happening if excavators were removed from the game so rorq's were just good at giving mining boosts.
---
So, it wont happen.

Except they get replaced from the alliance wallet, unlike the shitlers krabbing during deployment.

Fix that print on top!

Pyfa is an app
---
Even Goons hate themselves nowadays.
---
They didn't hire anybody though? Its just a bunch of nerds buddying up for the duration of gewns deployment to get some dank frags on gewn krabs
---
Technically it is. It was pretty clearly stated and anyone dumb enough to crab will die.
---
MER, according to goons.
---
It's a war regardless of what the receiving end thinks of it.
---
Not defending only means they are losing shit faster.
---
That's what they get for deploying during a crabbing.
---
Why would anyone be hired... Everyone loves to see goons die as much as NC. and right now, your easy pickings

Reseda Regnum is, surprisingly, not KOS for CVA. However, they are massive assholes and will gate camp kill you, NRDS or no.

They certainly pretend very hard not to care.

dude, too much koolaid isn't good for you

thanks bud, got my shit

It has been since the last war when the north thought they are dealing damage by killing illiterate krabs.
---
Why does that relate to the campaign? Is the owner trying to build karma cred so they can spout talking points without looking like a bot.
---
First time visiting Delve?
---
Agree with olmeca, still downvote him
---
True but for spin sake you can just assume they were all rigged.

bUt ThE mEr

Goons were grr goons before it was cool though
---
even when we aren't deployed it's the same.
---
do as your told - you get saved.
---
don't do as you're told - you lose your expensive toys and we laugh at you.
---
Hardly. Simple matter of facts.
---
I don't think anybody was hired. Every non-goon in Eve was waiting for goons to deploy so they could go throw petrol bombs at Delve
---
It's almost like everyone who cared about the MER war currently preparing to glass tribute.

Sherman's March to the Sea counted, this will too.

Are you still joining Keepstar unanchor fleets?

are your parents related? Because you're probably one of the most retarded people in eve
---
There is no profit in industry, people litteraly sell finished products for less than the mineral prices because of the super vachumes in null.
---
Predictions:
---
1. Goons will faff about in Tribute, possibly striking into Tenal/Vale/Geminate a little bit and posture heavily.
---
2. There will be a set of major cap feeds, a failed dread bomb from either side but GSF will feed more caps overall.
---
3. A small super brawl when GSF gets caught unawares, a few stragglers from NC/PL will be caught but it will be a major blow to morale.
---
4. Whaling will be in full swing in Delve with the amount of retards dying in force.
---
5. Cessation of war in 2-3 months.

Well you don't know what the fuck you are talking about but like to pretend anyways, pointing out your retardness shouldn't come as a surprise
---
Fuck me the paranoia of the Panfam boogeyman is golden. Do you really think they had to pay anyone to come and enjoy open season in the retard-safari park?
---
That's probably pretty accurate. Tho I doubt the north will go for round 2 of X47
---
hey bb
---
this is a really bad post seriously...
---
Dude you making the mistake of believing your own propaganda.
---
Hey qt pi
---
If we're counting fuel costs we should also count the isk they would have made by not deploying and krabbimg instead
---
Lets keep it to kills k
---
No, there won't be. They know they can't win a setpiece battle, so the most that they will do is catch some Goon FC fumbling his supers around, bag a fair amount of them and then jet. X47 will not happen again when the numbers are this drastic.
---
Those krabs dying in Delve surely affect our war effort.
---
Unfortunately not outside Northern brains.
---
not a pyfa dev, nor trying to speak for the pyfa devs, but an accompanying website for fit uploads and backups that can be made public would be awesome
---
So many shitposts today.
---
Since the reshuffle, the reshuffle was my main motivation to start.
---
100B isn't trivial
---
Are we sitting here posting dozens of threads about how us deploying is destroying you? Well those currently hunting in delve are physically incapable of shutting up about it for five minutes, and posting about it constantly. The duality here is striking. 
---
And after months of grinding up war chests, the loss of half a dozen supers wont put a dent in anything, and you know it.
---
Good thing!
---
can confirm; i'm doing this for free.
---
best fuckin' fleet i've been on in my life, we're not even done.
---
Gotta fight on the only ground grid you able to stay on, you see.
---
I really wish we put this much effort into fighting Goonies main fleet. Lots of talent and manpower wasted on killing dumb's in delve just to pad the killboard.
---
shut up retard
---
Pretty accurate of what will likely happen.
---
I love how you try so very hard to convince everyone that you're not upset. You're fooling no one son.

I wonder if these horrible threads are being coordinated somehow, or if it's just contemporaneous skull sewage seeping into the internet's drinking water.

what it's shit because it's true?

Total shots fired (aside from here on reddit).  
---
Goons: 0

NC.: 0

There have been more supers lost today in Delve (8) than were lost in all of New Eden over either of the last 2 weekends. There haven't been 8 supers lost on a single day in Eve since April 13th. And 2 of those losses were titans. The last time New Eden saw 2 titan losses in a day was April 24th. In both cases, Delve today has seen more losses than all of Eve has seen in a month or so. That's pretty significant
---
Its all good and funny that dumbos are dying in expensive things. But when you leave dread numbers out to make look like the other side hasn't lost anything it makes you look extra retarded
---
Buy button doesn't show up even if I remove my search for the skill book. I'm only searching up the thing I want to make what I want clear and visible in the picture. Right now, it's on Show All. I assume that means there's no filter. Still no buy button
---
Fuck off snowflake
---
It is in the bigger picture though
---
What happens is a script makes loads of accounts for a single owner. Said owner then sells this up/down vote power and also his ability to have respectably aged  accounts comment with slight narrative. They are shallow however and are unable to withstand anything more than casual querying. They need to be aged on non political sub reddits so they'll joiningg random popular subs and try farm karma with copy pasta from other threads.
---
Killary used loads last election hence my comment but it really just boils down to who pays. They just spew garbage and up vote comments and down vote others with scripted -'s &amp; +'s.
---
r/unitedkingdom is full of them, go try spot em but since there is an election coming up you'll see it a lot more soon.
---
I'm having trouble understanding why I should be upset?
---
This is absolutely worth a thread every day that goes this well for the gankers and the ex-renter nugoon plebs still krabbing in delve instead of deploying to war shouldn’t expect anything less than what is happening.
---
got em!
---
yes ccp pls spend devtime on making some more mineing shps pls pls pls
---
you forgot all the NC citadels they unanchored
---
If only y'all put the energy and dedication spent making these terrible threads into actually playing Eve Online, maybe you'd approach a fraction of our power. I guess that's harder than coasting off of an accomplishment made more than a decade ago, though.
---
I made it as wide as I could so that it's obnoxiously clear extending the window won't work. But your right, I didn't get what he meant until I saw your comment.
---
I guarantee it will boring like all the other wars nowadays... Everything wealthy is already evacuated, structure grinding and fozzie SOV lameware and tidi...  But not with me, i am done with this Kind of gameplay because there is no...
---
I heard they got it from your playbook
---
pocket change for us
---
no you see they were insured which means they are isk positive
---
 from the Book of Vince, Chapter 4 Verse 20   
---
Beat your Excavators into Medium Railguns   
---
And your Rorqs into Rags   
---
Let the krabs say, we are the North!
---
the pride of all of palestine
---
Some of you will be going back to help them, even if you're saying that they'll just be ignored and laughed at. Calling it.
---
Like everyone else says, zKillboard is a great place for fits. It might seem counter-intuitive, but even the best players lose a ship sometimes.
---
Just stick to groups that you know are good in the niche you're trying to fit for. And make sure you're actually looking at a fit designed for the niche you're trying to fit for. Don't just pick the first one you find, check a lot of losses to see common trends. For example if 99% of beam Retributions are fit with dual locus rigs, it's probably a good idea.
---
Then pick a couple of favorite fits, put them into pyfa, compare and pick your favorite. 
---
Don't just blindly copy it though, figure out the purpose of every module. A common thing is that ships have overdrives to match the speed of their doctrine. You can find a better use for those slots (even if it's just nanos) if speed doesn't matter for your use-case.
---
you forgot dreadnoughts
---
I guess I got my answer. Not from the content of your particular post, of course.
---
It's collecting all your personal data and internet history
---
 Oh wow, nice!
---
&gt;, the issue I'm trying to point out is goons would have had more pilots on the first insertion if those guys could insert set the clone and could jump out again because it would mean a less heavy commit from there side
---
The first insertion was INIT, not Goons as a whole. From the reports I've heard, they were told "form bombers" and weren't told where they were going or what they were doing until they arrived in Rage. So... no. The proposed change would not have had the effect you describe here, *in this case*. In a hypothetical scenario where opsec is held less closely, it could give less hardcore players the ability to participate in more wormhole fights. This definitely something that should be considered. I'm not certain it's a bad thing.
---
&gt; If the defenders have the ships it's still not to there advantage to use  them unless they win like nothing of that mechanic changes because you  can save your material regardless 
---
What are you trying to say here? My point is that it *can be* to your advantage to take a losing fight if you can reship and try again. Most w-space fights right now revolve around trying desperately to lose nothing, but you could build a doctrine around trying to trade ships aggressively under the theory that you have more resources to throw into the grinder. You can "lose" the first fight to take out 1/3 of their dps, and then reship to do it again, and on round 3 you probably win.
---
&gt; like its similar to when you have an unrolled frig hole, most of the  time these are used to infill rather than to directly contest hole  control 
---
Under the current system, sure, but I'm not sure how this is relevant.
---
&gt; what you seem to ignore is how the ability to dead clone into a wormhole helps the attacker, 
---
Yes. I'm ignoring this because it's irrelevant to appropriate game design. Speaking as a wormholer who would love to be able to defend my home, we should HTFU and do what's good for gameplay even if it gets us evicted.
---
&gt; given the attacker already has the advantage and can bring in the needed  material in 1 shot, specially if you don't have to hard commit your  dudes one of the things that hold evictions back as common is that it's a  hard commit from everyone involved because you need to hold hole  control all your characters need to be in the hole ( or a large amount  ), this means evictions become much more casually run ( and that's  really bad for the smaller groups in wormhole space as they're gonna be  fucked regardless of hole control ). 
---
Let's start by agreeing that the amount of material needed is not a fixed amount. It depends on how hard the defenders resist. If we're talking about a boosh raven fleet, for example, you will take a variable amount of jump dessie casualties based on how many Petes or other annoyances the defenders deploy.
---
So **if** the attackers have brought in sufficient material at the beginning for overwhelming the defenders and all their resources, then the attackers do not need to hold hole control to bring in any more material. I agree. However, they may wish to still maintain hole control to prevent defenders from evacuating assets, or to prevent defenders from calling external reinforcements. In this situation, I'd break down attacker options into roughly (a) exhausting full hole control effort, (b) "just enough" hole control effort designed to minimize defenders hauling material in and out, (c) no hole control and count on being able to overwhelm the defenders and their allies. If I'm reading your complaint right, you're concerned that attackers will be able to do **b/c** instead of just **a** and this will make it easier for people to do evictions. Why is this a problem?
---
To address smaller w-space groups directly, they aren't going to be fucked regardless. Some have historically been able to call up allies, and those allies will actually be able to help if the attackers aren't holding strict hole control. Some (like DURA LEXX) have developed strategies for surviving "being evicted" without actually losing significant assets.
---
In general, I think this will make it easier for w-space groups to deploy (since they don't have to hold as much back at home), and for groups to deploy into w-space. Yes, evictions may be come more doable, but see above. I don't think that's a valid argument against improving gameplay.
---
&gt; the attackers now can dead clone back and they're much more likely to have spare doctrine ships than the defender 
---
Wait, what? You don't have spares of your home defense doctrine(s)?
---
&gt;  As for holding against ships or ceptors it  really shouldn't matter because if you do your job right neither one  should get remotely close to the hole.
---
Spoken like someone who's never tried to hold hole control over a k-space static.
---
I'm pretty sure everything short of rigged citadel/important sov timers will be ignored.
---
Not many reasons to go defend people who would die due to not calling for help on an average day.
---
They were gating to the deployment
---
already replaced
---
at some point CCP will do an assessment of the issue. if you're bothered enough by bots to post on reddit, then you're bothered enough to use a free in game reporting too that costs you nothing but less time than it too you to make this post. giving CCP the tools and info to better regulate their product is a good thing if you value the health of the game.
---
I mean, everything is fine. Same shit happened last time we deployed north, and it'll happen again. Lets not pretend killing some dumb krabbers is actually going to affect anything.
---
Hey arent u the BB guy?
---
War literally hasn't even started yet and the north cannot stop posting about how good they're doing in it. We aren't even to the target region yet, you glue-sniffing mouth-breathing keyboard-mashing hotpocket-deepthroating fucking nerds. 
---
Seriously. We hold back on our hurf and r/eve is overtaken with *how much we spent on fuel* for fucks sake. 
---
&gt;Hurr durr made you jump. You lost soooo much money because of it. Durr we killed gewn ships doing dumb in delve too. Winning the iskie war bois 
---
Just stop posting. Please.
---
Highly agree. I have heen waiting for the 3 page Olmeca post...guess we will have to wait another day...
---
How would you kill 700 titans?
---
Got into my first Carrier.
---
Sounds like someone is salty that the isk farming alt he put into goons lost a rorqual
---
There is two reasons to get into industry, 1 because you want to, and 2, because you want to build something and then use it yourself because, like 1, you want to..
---
the only people making money from industry are the people with max everything skills who are building in massive bulk and then hauling it all out to highsec to sell on the market, these are things you just cant do yourself unless you already have all the infrastructure in place, jump freighter pilots and cyno alts, a toon dedicated to market trading for the selling, and of course your guy dedicated to actually building the things.
---
Personally I like the idea of building something for myself and then using it, iv built a few of my own ship hulls for example, I could buy them at lower cost in most cases but I get satisfaction in knowing I mined the ore, I processed it and I finally build it into a ship and fittings, and now Im flyin......... losing it in a glorious explosion.
---
&gt;Afterall, how often do you see Horde, Snuff, PL and Volta on the same side of a killmail?  
---
Pretty fucking often, actually? It's been this way in Delve since post-WWB, basically.
---
Based and Redpilled post.
---
Or if you care about having actually competent members rather than fucking retarded f1 pushers who can't say anything but "ooohh but looking zkill is bad ok"
---
Ohw and we are the only ones who leave things out right ;)
---
Great job Jin and crew keep up the work!
---
If you want to make your enemies losing  job materials, you would better not let your enemies know your plan until shield is reinforced...
---
Dont knock the reddit banter, this is the best bit of any war!
---
You're "holding back on your hurf?"
---
Goon krabs are shite and panfam are irrelevant, get it right.
---
Because Rorquals have not already fucked the game enough, lets introduce Mining T3 ships.
---
not many reasons to defend ur space from enemy fleets huh?
---
&gt; you glue-sniffing mouth-breathing keyboard-mashing hotpocket-deepthroating fucking nerds.
---
Touched a nerve eh?
---
Because there's a significant amount more movement. 
---
I bet if you took the ratio of losses to some measure of ship movement, like jumps or gates taken etc. It would probably look like one of the safest days.
---
i am involved with them, yes :)
---
Lmao look at this retard
---
No worse then the Goons posts :)
---
What if being scrammed would prevent you from using the ansiblex jump gates.  
---
What if being scrammed would prevent you from being able to store your fucking ships in a rorqual.
---
Cool story
---
Because competent and incompetent people shut eachother out and they simply cannot exist within one alliance.
---
And whats worse, the incompetent F1 krabs surely cannot be of use for the competent people in form of tax money or just by pressing F1 en masse.
---
ok but gewnsworm has deployed and is currently in the process of moving supplies to dab on Tribute. At this point saying the war has yet to start is not really applicable.
---
That would ruin the narrative.
---
They recruited all of the failed alliances that got caught failcascading when they couldn’t defend their sov, put them all together in one spot, with all of their crabbing problems and garbage leadership. Let them run rampant and this is what happens haha. Of course the krabs didn’t deploy with the rest of them and stayed back to be stupid. They can’t help it, they’ve been making stupid decisions since they fail cascaded. Nothing new to see here just the same baby seals flopping around in space. 
---
Uhh I mean, this is great all the space stupid is in one place so now we don’t have to go so far to find them or look really hard. Goons made it easy on us, yay goons!
---
&gt;Just stop posting. Please.
---
Why would you want them to stop?
---
Run! The Goon Downvote Brigade is loose!
---
&gt;Dont knock the reddit banter, this is the best bit.
---
It's looking like it'll be the only bit
---
Service guarantees citizenship. You krab rather than deploy, you deserve what comes when our defence fleet doesn't save you. Our opinions haven't changed in any way, either you fight with us or you die quietly alone. 
---
Stop. Posting.
---
whew took the posting bait super hard my dude.
---
If your alliance is happily taking the drooling retards who don't actually understand the game, your standards are fucked. I know mittens loves his exercise but you just can't spin that
---
Honestly though even on reddit its hard to sustain this level of shitposting against a 30k man allaince.
---
When the damage they do is purely cosmetic on zkill, yeah, not many reasons to go home.
---
Like I said, did they hit anything important the reaction would be different.
---
So you actually think killing krabbers too  dumb deploy is actually hurting Goons?
---
Never said that, but cool story bro
---
NC should put their spin resources towards recruitment and industry. Two years ago. Lol
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/lCvGj](https://imgur.com/gallery/lCvGj)
---
Neat-O it’s Markeedragon posting on /r/eve
---
Would make defence fleets 10x more interesting. "Grab my loot grab my loot!"
---
&gt;your standards are fucked
---
That depends on the goal tho.
---
If drooling retards can be useful (tax payers, F1 mass) why not take them in? It's not like they damage the organization as a whole.
---
Honestly it is though. You're comparing alliances so it's a drop in the bucket
---
You think the undefended structures you will kill will "affect NCPL war effort"?
---
Caring about deployable structures in 2019 is like caring about rorqual kills.
---
Unfortunately not outside goonsern brains. v0v0v0v
---
If you keep bitterposting in each and everyone of them I am sure they will stop.
---
Zero pls
---
Delve last 32 hours has been hilarious and amazing eve online gameplay.
---
For a moment I wondered whether someone could be this retarded, then I noticed your name and realise it has already been confirmed ages ago.
---
“Haha I trolled you so hard, I was only _pretending_ to be retarded!”
---
PL still a thing?
---
Well*
---
"Thanks for killing them, we told them not to krab"
---
Pretending like Dreads and carriers aren’t literally Subcaps in 2019.
---
Question for the Null folk: what do you enjoy about the wars?
---
I've been in 10% TiDi, and hated it.  What do you like about it?
---
Is it the comradery?  The kill mails?  Flexing?
---
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE reading about it!  Just wondering what motivates people to play in those conditions.
---
By blueing 70k randoms and spend 3 years ratting.
---
My favorite way of playing eve online the computer game.
---
Gutted :(
---
I normally only play Alpha, as I don't play enough for it to really be worth getting Omega. But I hit the Alpha training cap halfway through the XVI Celebration thing so I figured I'd pick up a month of Omega to get that sweet 1mil points.
---
Alas, I already missed enough days that I had to log in every single day from then on to get it. I'm sure I did, and that yesterday it read "2 days left, 14/16 claimed", but I guess it meant "There are 2 days and today is the penultimate day" and not "There are 2 more days after this one".
---
At least I got a monocle, I suppose.
---
Oh, I couldn't hold a candle to the bitter candor of the folks who post the threads in the first place. It's a striking display of just how powerless they feel all the time, after all. You can practically taste it.
---
They have similar qualities to RAZOR at this point.
---
I read somewhere that t4 and t5 abyssal sites will give you a suspect flag again soon.  is this confirmed?  is there a date for this?
---
I hear that bassline I upvote regardless of post quality
---
i chuckled
---
Or you could show them the door and maybe you'd start being able to recruit people who are actually competent.
---
Have fun killing undefended fortizars.
---
I will have fun killing undefended titans.
---
Im sure we will both enjoy the eve online gameplay
---
It's called ignoratio elenchi ('ignoring refutation').  It may be true, but it's irrelevant.
---
The second hand embarrassment is painful
---
F respects paid.
---
Yeah it’s a terrible post but Jesus yours is just madposting.
---
But... why?
---
Just to lose numbers and income?
---
Stupid pubbies don't understand that they're actually HELPING us by killing the dumb Krabs, every Titan/super loss actually puts money into more goon pockets
---
This is the true winner right here.
---
But with such obscene amounts of manpower, it's trivial to divert a small number of people to home defence. Would it not be smarter to split up the deployment into home defence and dabbing on NC? splitting it up would still allow for gewns(grr) to have the number advantage on both fronts
---
Fc, what is a strategic index and why is it important?
---
Did you have to let the cat out the bag so early?
---
Think we can expect this with the 28th May Invasion expansion.
---
It's funny, because the left are the ones who accused everyone who disagreed with them online of being Russian bots or paid off by the Russians, meanwhile Hillary actually contacted Russian officials for dirt on Trump and the left actually uses bots for political purposes.
---
amen brother
---
Shield supers are people too :(
---
Or to not be shit? In terms of actual competence imperium are just as bad as panfam, literally all you have over them is numbers lmfao
---
The Goon Narrative was always paper-tanked.
---
smh why do people never hull tank their supers? it's optimal!
---
Same.. F
---
if we kill every single one you want have ore to keep building your stuff, because no more wants to pay market prices to rebuild there toys.
---
I mean, tbf, op is the one including carriers.
---
I have 2 rules for this war.
---
No fleets over 2 hours, and I'm not moving my irl schedule around for it.
---
That means, I probably won't be doing much in this war.
---
whats RAZOR?
---
Hookers and pizza
---
Rest assured our industry has prepared for the war
---
yeah you need faction inertial stabs tho
---
bbbut 500 titans.....mittani big plan.....north gonna burn ....
---
Was fun anyway.  
---
We didnt attack them, we attacked some hauler without scouts in renter área.  
---
Cant be forever ratting and minning in HS.
---
anker some facts kid , nobody hired anyone
---
Battle nereus is legit af tho
---
Goon's FC situation is dire at the moment.
---
And to "not be shit" we should abandon the less fortunate, "non elite" pilots that call Delve home, like our friends in the north have?
---
I think that attitude would make us more shit than our members do.
---
F, brother
---
Imagine being this desperate to keep incompetent retards in your region :joy:
---
...imagine all the scrams you could fit on a hull tanked super...
---
Eh 2 Snuff?
---
Imagine being so desperate to stay "elite" you throw out people that bring numbers and isk.
---
They have similar qualities to PL at this point.
---
damn how can you be so mad. obviously they want to get under goons skin by hazing their turbo krabs. but when you cry it makes you look weak. if it really wasnt a bid deal would you be slamming your face against the keyboard sperg post about it.
---
wake up sheeple! THE GLORY OF HULL HOLDS NO BOUNDS
---
A very old alliance, which used to be part of the old Northern Coalition (no dot). After the old Northern Coalition was rolled out of the north in 2011, RAZOR threw their lot in with us, the then-CFC. There they remained until 2016, at which point they chose to bail instead of hunker down with us in a soda factory. After that, they failed to accomplish anything of note.
---
I thought it was a cleansing, not a war?
---
Imagine being so desperate for isk that you trade pilot competence for raw blob that makes your alliance look fucking ridiculous
---
I am not sure why that guy answered "yes I have" as if he was me replying. I live in w-space so I haven't seen a NS campaign up close for a few years so maybe extending the time ti reset your tiners should be 14 days or something if 7 is too fast.
---
I agree, the current system gives too much to the defenders :/ 
---
Overall I feel that the control over timers is just too precise. One of the things I liked about stront is that while you had a small degree of control as the defender, in practical terms neither side got to pick the exact timers because the defenders could only guess how much stront would be appropriate to get a good timer while the attackers couldn't know at all how much stront was inside.
---
Just have to gank until they randomly end up in the right order.
---
I mean NC could defend?
---
chump change
---
Thanks :)
---
I know who's number 1 on my gank list
---
Regions evacuated: 
---
Tenal
---
Tribute
---
I don't see razor being one of the most active pvp alliances?
---
REEEEEEE!
---
Wrong sub for those bants.
---
Who cares if we look ridiculous?
---
We give home to new and bad players while benefiting of it. 
---
Turns out the numbers matter more than competence
---
gta YEET that ore lmao
---
you don't kill the titan, you kill the pilot['s will to play the game].
---
&gt; Turns out the numbers matter more than competence
---
Is that why the new take on burn jita is going on even in your fucking staging lmao
---
Leaps and bounds better than paraphrasing “u mad?” in every post
---
They might have been given to those that attended EVE Russia event couple of weeks back.
---
Not when you spend so much effort and passion telling us how it's not hurting.

That is actually a fine advice.

Burn jita is like whats going on in delve.

Dumb shits dying cause they cant read.

Unachoring and docking up faster than high sec wardeccers.

aren't those mining barges or exhumers. though they do have battlecruiser size sigs which sucks.

What story could there possibly be.

Actually, you know what, nevermind.

try searching for \`\*\[a-z\]{3},\`.
---
Fucking Kek
---
Lol
---
I just imagine a bunch of Somalians equipped with space AK-47s and makeshift space suits raiding a space shuttle on a space dingy...
---
Another unpopular opinion would be : why would you kill off your enemy in a space game ?
---
Same idea apply to goon for this war and any following war : if you want to play alone in space, then by all means, ruins everyone.
---
Goons needs to have an enemy to spin about, NCPL need to have member not burning out following goons there, cycle repeat.
---
Was joking.
---
but delb is burning

---
Sorry Unanchoring V only, it’s part of our Magic 15(Tm) recommended skill plan.
---
how well would a fleet of bombers apply to a titan that was running 6 faction smartbombs?  I think that could kill a number of the torps.
---
Dumb shits in goons because alliance is desperate.
---
Why though?
---
That was your chance to make him believe you were being merciful. Build up his trust making him think you’re a good guy, then one day he brings his turbo-bling rorqual through, and BAM, you fuck him in the ass.
---
This is pretty normal shit when deployments happen.  Test went through the exact same thing a little while back when we moved out shield supers out of esoteria.  I expect within a month they will have their shit together a lot better.
---
You are the creative director, why aren't you doing your job?
---
Expedition cruiser (or BC or BS ) solo mining ship, cannot benefit from mining boosts. Has a mix of m3, tank, yield, but no 1 category better than exhumer. 
---
Niche for sure, but I think a good addition.
---
Nah mate they are taking Querious
---
You guys have no idea how bad their posting has gotten.  They've been posting against us the past 6 months.  It's so bad.
---
nobody cares if its hurting goons or not lmao
---
while I dont have any fact to this I'm also guessing the casino money stopped after goons were evicted, no money no war
---
You'd think that with an alliance a little under half the size of ours, they could manage to elect one homegrown candidate. (Suitonia doesn't count as a phorde candidate; just like he didn't count as a GSF candidate in CSM 12.) I wonder where the failure lies. Their inability to motivate the line to vote? Their lack of a suitable candidate? Both?
---
Looks like a lot of dead goons on there. Who are you calling bad?
---
If only you spent this amount of energy defending your krabbers in Delve.
---
Desperate for what?
---
Not everyone is desperate to be elite.
---
Some merely welcome more than the others and reap the benefits, like the force on the northern borders.
---
tbh here in test we right now don't care given we are just bluetral with them.  Every titan that dies is one less we might have to face some day, and it seems they have easily enough for this deployment.
---
Pretending like Titans and Supers aren’t literally Subcaps in 2019.
---
ftfy.
---
You are a goon pet... it does not take guud posting to make fun of you
---
and some of the halfwits, don't understand the umbrella is....compromised.
---
Well yeah, you didn't train it to 5. Should have put your free 1m SP into it!
---
The erebus was a EULA violation.    Still should be culled from the herd.
---
I enjoy when dumb idiots die.  When I get ganked I will have done something dumb, or idiotic, and I will enjoy watching a dumb idiot die right in front of me.
---
who wouldn't want easy super, titan, and rorqual kills?
---
Which is why ghostile is here with us today.
---
Y’all are excited about a few tiny kills. Those are peanuts compared to what’s coming to you
---
Why tho? Theres more money to be made in selling them replacements
---
Yes, I am here as therapist to help the north cope with loss.
---
We gonna have a big hall of shame for this war
---
In your case it's for good reason.

And test is putting significant isk towards strengthening its home defense to keep this to a minimum in esoteria.

I hope the subreddit gets as bad as it did during the week of the UALX hellcamp. That was a wild ride.
---
upvoted for monocled madness even tho its snuff
---
i too can make up a arbitrary metric and make it one of the lowest :&gt;
---
What do you think is coming?
---
Enough to scare NC. to the point they are unanchoring structures.
---
You can copy fits from zkill straight into Pyfa.
---
Have you ever tried a macbook?
---
Adding new T3 mining ships is a terrible idea, . If I were doing this I would just add new T3C subsystems. Wouldn't be as good as a barge, but better than a Venture. The advantage would be more flexibility and refitting for ninja ops. Still not a great idea, but better than new ship's.
---
I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE.

Fun fact: Can't defend what can't even notice the standing fleet isn't up.

You literally just have to log into the character select screen once a day. 
---
I get people have lives but come on, you could do that on a shitty laptop on mobile internet.
---
That was actually a good move because it makes no sense to fight goons atm. Everyone saw that during the last war in the north. Horde will keep fighting and I think NC. and the others will fight alongside them in germinate but I don't think that a lot of supers or caps will be fielded by others than goons. 
---
Everyone knows that in the long term they will loose against imperium but geminate will hold for a little bit and delve will burn because the krabs in delve are spoiled and don't know how null works now that their umbrella is gone.
---
Disco dont kill ammo.
---
We even had a few TEST recently
---
Clearly fucking desperate for members with your shit standards. No better than the northerners you love to hate yet such beautiful spin. And despite how wonderful your numbers apparently are, going to war means you can't defend your own fucking staging from the people you want to go to war with.
---
Gotta give an upvote just for the intro music alone.
---
I think goons will go and grind geminate because Horde will try to defend it and the others will probably help them with it
---
nice Video, also... phew, warped out in structure there :D
---
Some people can't be helped. If the constant pings, posts and mails didn't get through to them, nothing will. They deserve to lose their ships.
---
You mean I could fund the largest move op in the game with my personal wallet and its not trivial?
---

---
How do you propose we defend people unable to figure simple things like "There is no standing fleet, don't krab"
---
Or is your alliance so bad it can't stand a month or two without constant krabbing?
---
I agree that the krabs in delve are stupid. It just seems that NC. is getting excited early. They’ve managed to kill easy targets, but when it comes to all out combat, they will have a lot more trouble. Seems silly to start counting when goons haven’t even made it to their space yet. Once we do, the death toll will be much larger.

Resulted in 10 chars, 1 corp, +somewhere in nullsec

It would be trivial is game mechanics were not shit and promote instant warp ship that the best counter is untargeted AoE damage or HAW Dreads.
---
The same power-creep that kills low sec startups, the same power creep that skills nullsec startups.  Fueled by WH's and NPC null stations.
---
At least goons have the backbone to live near NPC null, and they have the numbers and cohesion to ignore yapping skirmish gangs picking off the weak.
---
I'd love to keep shitposting about this, but I concede that you make a fair point.
---
good work on those 2 titans if you kill another 698 you might have an even titan battle
---
This is some next level damage control. Imagine bragging about killing the bottom of the barrel retards while goons essentially burn everything you have to the ground lmao
---
i think all three of them did. for sure at least two.
---
Totally striking.  Outrageous even.
---
CSM should have some reserved seats for different areas of the game (highsec, lowsec, J space and nullblobs).

You seem very very upset. Would you like a cuddle?
---
There is a large difference between conventional forces and a hydrogen bomb. I could say the same thing in regards to pearl harbor e.g. the U.S. did not immediately take action on the Japanese because they had to build back up but to say that the war had yet to start because there were no actual engagements besides a surprise attack at that point would be seen as dumb. the surprise attack in this analogy would be NC and friends pewing some krabs in delve btw.
---
No blueballs here
---
"I [8URNT] my guns shootig.."
---
Goons were never an elite force. They're the blob. The reason they're on top right now is precisely because of their lax recruitment standards.
---
General competency tends to take a hit as a result of the above. Doesn't matter though, they're still #1 -- not NC. or PL, who many considered were "elite" groups with the best pilots.
---
He has 6m sp and 1+m is in Planet shit.  What is he going to, warp a shuttle at you.
---
Ok my friend let's start from the beginning.
---
The edited video you are reporting to [please insert the link here, I don't keep garbage] is an edited video of a fireside where Mittani (pbuh) answer to someone in a pretty bad way (for me) to not report your fellow goons because some might be bot but a majority of them are legit bot, he then give an example (which btw is in the edited video) where he told that someone was reporting anyone ratting in his system for botting... So you might ask "yeah but whatever if they are legit they won't get ban right ?" recent history told us that CCP, sometimes, do mistakes [link Brisc Rubal shitstorm here]. So what could be hardly proven before (Mittani narrative that don't report people WE, the player base do not have the tool to know who is a bot and who is not, and Brisc ban show sometimes, mistakes happen and Mittani is right) 
---
So I just broke your narrative "shittani has repeatedly said to not report suspected bots", since he had said it only one time on a fireside where an edited video was release, and history show us we as player don't have tool to decide who is and who isn't and it can lead to a random ban like what happen to brisc (I repeat myself because you seen pretty retarded :) 
---
Now let's talk about the chart where CCP_Peligro show that 1°) goons is not in the top 25 botting alliance in eve 2°) most of them are renter 3°) most of renter are held by anti-goons. First I would love to clear something, Kids with guns is a well known botting group that pay it neighborhood to keep their silence, one of them is in fact test. Now I could do the list of all other known botting group that belong to the north, like for example BOT who directly belong to NC, FRT treasury who are FRT renter and last year war told us NCPL are pretty close friend of FRT, tbh I was impress to not seeing RMT in that list but well unlike you, I won't close myself in a denial.  On a final note I've seen Northern people trying to spin "yeah, but if goons are not in this list it's because they kick bots", I let you read it over and over in your head until you understand the irony of this shit.
---
So what have you more to say ? Come on, bring any shit that goes trough your mind about the current state of botting in eve, but I think you did not receive the memo like most of grr-goons on reddit since that Top 25 chart have been out : The issue is no longer who bot, but how CCP is doing nothing (since well, that chart show how wrong their narrative is and how it's their side and their friend who are to blame on this)
---
&gt;there's no harm in reporting someone who you THINK is a bot.
---
In case you did not understand in my comment below.
---
Read about brisc Rubal recent issue with CCP
---
You mean it's possible for you to cry even harder?
---
Sometimes goons kill more goons than that in 24hrs, so do the rats.
---
Good to see the collective Grr Goon masses can equal the NPC forces of delve.

Weird flex but ok

For the record we have been calling these same idiot krabs idiots for the last 3 years, they are just dying now and reddit screeching about how cool they are killing them cause we are not bending over backwards to keep them safe, thats my take anyway feel free to down doot me.
---
I think it is more metaphorical for squeezing money out of the poor.

You must have quiet a few extra chromosomes, judging by your post history lol.

That
---
This would explain a lot.
---
Logi
---
&gt; It would be trivial if game mechanics were not shit and promote instant warp ship that the best counter is untargeted AoE damage or HAW Dreads. 
---
Okay, so goons need to deploy everybody to go and shoot an extremely small alliance in comparison? Did gewns not have a large number of people on the CSM to lobby to fix these issues which you are talking about? Don't goons perpetuate a lot of the issues in nullsec? e.g. supercap umbrella?  
---
&gt; At least goons have the backbone to live near NPC null, and they have the numbers and cohesion to ignore yapping skirmish gangs picking off the weak. If they don't prevent death by retard in peacetime, why would they stop it in wartime? 
---
I thought that one of the big selling points of goons was the fact that they offered one of the safest places to krab in the entire game? They are the most powerful people in the entire game and yet they can't even defend their own space alongside deploying to attack a 2k man alliance?
---
I guess you have trouble.... procuring... the salt.
---
Lmao I was shocked to see I was in it. Pretty funny good effort dude, nice shitpost I approve
---
So much tears the entire system turned into an ocean.
---
Oh, was this the apple pear impersonation kill?

We’re all cheering on Don. The mad lad said “well I can’t super rat because goons permacamped my region, so I have to make isk some other way.” Apparently gun-mining those bee guys is that other way.

I’ve made suggestions solely on exit surveys. I unsubscribe en mass and ask for things like rookie ships in sov null, NPC to be harder and to shoot pods, hsec wars to have structures so bankers have to defend, etc etc.
---
This one was fleet warped off by someone using an impersonator name iirc.  
---
If it was killed on the 1dq keep, it would have the planet/moon of the 1dq keep there.

This was fleet-warped more than 4au from any celestial and killed with an impostor fleet fc name.

Losing your big boy toys in your staging system because apparently the numbers over competence approach gives you intelligent pilots who don't need babysitting and who can comprehend the idea of defending your fucking STAGING system during wartime.
---
&gt;Or is your alliance so bad it can't stand a month or two without constant krabbing?
---
Fairly sure that's only legacy, panfam, and imperium
---
Almost as embarrassing as unanoching keepstars a week in advance, and docking up all your fancy faction titans, then surrendering 5 keepstars, and then having your allies betray you?
---
Yea must be totally embarrassing to lose some isk focused idiots who cannot even notice the alliance left with 4000 people.

Im tired of you people saying just get over it and log in or its soo easy to log in. Ffs I wasnt even told about the event till three days in FROM CCP.. If they hadent of extended it for that down time o wouldnt jave goten the final reward. Oh the last event I dont even think I got half way through because of the same shit. 
---
So no I wont "just log in" I will bitch and complane till CCP listens and stops these dumb ass events and do a real log in reward system that isnt tied to some dumbass event
---
Honestly I cant believe you sheeple are ok with these events. Its just a reason to roll more alts ffs. Hell if you rolled a new alt for this one it paid for itself ffs! 
---
Only reason you idoits are is cuz you want your precious rewards.
---
Thank God you're finally showing us the respect we're due. Took long enough
---
I wish somebody would actually describe and explain what’s currently happening, instead of “oh we killed bunch of your ships, you bads” and “This won’t dent our economy it makes no difference”

Hopefully one of the guys that writes the “news” articles comes up with one..

he's mad bro, triggered even
---
I'm sorry if this is proving a difficult concept for you. The fact that if you're so keen to help your shit tier pilots because they contribute to muh taxes aside, they're dying in *your staging.* The fact that the only excuse I've seen from any goons for the loss of shiny toys in staging is "we're at war and you can't defend your home from the people you're at war with" is fucking hilarious. You can "defend" them by being competent enough to keep people from killing shit in your staging, or even by stopping them before they get there. But sorry if home defense is impossible without gate bosons for you, sweetie
---
yeah ok piggles

Vary nice. I'd jand it up.

We've got a pretty good bingo game going on now, watching the special people blow up in their toys. Get on your alts and join in the fun

Yeah, fucker wasn't deploying, fuck them.

Team goons moving titans north. You cant fight 2:1 in titans and win. So the north wont fight.
---
The north is now in Delve killing botters and crabs.
---
So goons will kill undefended citadels, NCPL will kill undefended delve titans.
---
Both sides will smugpost.
---
Hopefully everyone has fun.
---
Imagine being this upset because your own alliance is shit
---
Yes, to be honest. It's been a shit few days and I could do with a cute boy to take a nap with. I was hoping this conflict would at least make r/eve worth reading but instead it makes me want to fuck myself to death with my keyboard
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted.  It's been pinged multiple times that if you're dumb enough to be caught out in space in Delve during the deployment, no help is coming.
---
I know why I'm being downvoted.
---
Because it's the only gun the north is able to point at goon warmachine.
---
Seems like both sides have deployed on reddit as well haha.

I’m glad that there is still people that understand what Eve/games in general is all about, fun.

Well that's odd, seeing how your alliance will take literally anyone regardless of how shit they are
---
Absolutely positively 999.99% perturbed
---
Can’t beat us so you gotta copy us? Sounds about right.
---
Indeed it is. An alliance full of shitlers is wiping the floor with the elite.
---
Recruitment well executed.
---
I predict this will age well. /s
---
Imagine having your head so far up your ass that you actually believe this shit.
---
No, only the shit you leave behind unprotected at home.
---
To be honest, if it's this type of field day in Delve on a full deployment, I hope the Goons go structure bash more often lol
---
It’s up to 400 pretty sure
---
So everything you are ever capable of killing.
---
It worked in the past.
---
I'm excited you picked up on the trail.
---
Yeah, because we always come up with the best stuff.
---
&gt; with the elite.
---
When in the actual fuck did panfam come anywhere close to "the elite"? Goons are just as shit as the people they fight, their only advantage is one cancerous blob is bigger than the other. Think more an alliance full of manchildren wiping the floor with an alliance full of children and you're probably a little closer.
---
10/10 would welp in 1DQ for an Erebus again
---
Losing what exactly? Space the Goons won't hold? A keepstar or two? Hell, Delve has already lost more ISK-wise in 48 hours.  
---
PL/NC set back up when you leave?  
---
lol ok
---
Why do you keep typing "alt(94)The" instead of "\^The"?
---
Why would you think us bringing the universe to heel would make this place readable?
---
Goons didn't want that Titan anyway. Or that other Titan. Or those ratting carriers. 
---
Or any of the other things blown up in Delve these last two days.
---
Hahahahaha thank you, you made me spit my coolaid all over my screen
---
Delve has already lost what? Shit that doesn't benefit the Coalition, don't read ping so probably don't even fly on fleets.
---
And you are trying to say goons are losing more than the north is about it?
---
I guess we'll find out. TBH I think we can rebuild delve pretty easy though
---
Show me on this doll where Jibrish touched you
---
What exactly is the North about to lose?
---
It hurts
---
Everything that is not unanchored + big part of whatever they decide to throw against the supers that are rolling over them?
---
Said this over a year ago.
---
Is TEST on the correct side of that battle report? Because in a PL vs Goons fight, I would not expect to see them on the PL side.
---
The search does not support regex, it is ignoring your special character and giving you the same results as if you had searched on "The".
---
For proof, just search on The\[b\] and you'll get Thebeka..  Next, search on The\[bl\], which would give you both Thebeka and Thelan, if regular expressions worked.  Instead, you'll get nothing because it will discard the special characters and search for "Thebl"
---
I feel so sad for you that your leadership is promising some big frags and fights. NC scorched earthed Tribute and I highly doubt there will be a super capital brawl.
---
Oh like I've said elsewhere, I'm pretty confident the north don't want another X47. But the question remains, if there's nothing stopping us in Tribute, there's always the next region.
---
And what did they tell you when you opened your ticket with support?
---
strange bedfellows, yes. when tapi cant stand the hurf blurf you know something aint right
---
We can do this!
---
Let the morons burn in fire.  
---
Was not trying to be hostile, but only expressing my honest opinion that if you undock high value ships when we have been pinging the crap out of our coms not to do this, we get to laugh at your loss and hold you up as an example for others to learn from.  
---
The main reasons people do this are that they are so un engaged with the alliance to not have jabber running and see the warnings, or read the advice and not take it.  Either way learn or don’t...does not matter.  
---
It actually surprised me just how many jabber ping warnings have been put out about risks they should already know about.  Much more warning than I have seen from the Imperium before actually.  
---
I think you will find that the average Goon is not upset about losses of people who don’t have the sense that God gave little chickens.  
---
They will learn (hopefully) or not.
---
I mean dreads after insurance cost less than a well fit cruiser these days, so pretty much.
---
that's actually a candidate for Post of the Year
---
Harder, with more feeling
---
Nope, I don't think I heard it clearly enough, Can you try again?
---
Easy, just tab to each in order when commanding to fire.
---
Don't get me wrong, I stopped underestimated the Goon Autism a long time ago - but even I don't see you grinding through more than one or two regions before you either 1) get bored or 2) have so much shit exploding at home you move at least the shield fleet back. Hey - at which point maybe PL/NC take a fight :)

You gotta be flair baiting with this post.
