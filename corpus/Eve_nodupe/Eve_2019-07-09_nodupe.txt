Daily? You mean monthly?

---
Aside from auto attacking the thing you are shooting at with other weapon systems.
---
Well, it didn't take the rabble long to move in
---
turns out botting can get you anything!!

O R I G I N A L M E M E
---
Actually /u/wormholegank did
---
I don't think they have human brain though
---
Lost a Nereus on my alt on Saturday to a Cynabal camp in low, moving random trash to Jita I'd collected. Conversation went like this after I warped off with my pod:
---

---
Camper 1: fag
---
Camper 2: fag
---
Me: gf
---
Camper 1: that wasn't a fight. It was a gank.
---
Me: Uh, OK. If you're looking for salt you aren't going to get any. Sorry.
---
Camper 2: fuck u
---
Camper 1: cool story bro
---
I don't bother with low sec often, so it's entirely possible that I just happened to run into the five assholes who haven't migrated to Fortnite yet. It was just extremely different from the banter I'm used to in null...most players I encounter are exactly like you described and very helpful or at least not super proud of killing a T1 industrial with multiple combat ships. They acted like they'd caught me in a dread or something.
---
It was weird. And it's been a few years but the only other times I remember players gloating about a kill was in low sec. I admit it's a low sample size, but has definitely made my decision to leave lowsec to the pirate roleplayers seem like a good one. But if I were actually a new player losing a lot of isk I could see such an experience as pretty off-putting.
---
I've said this a few times in threads like this one. And I don't actually care one way or another, but just try to remember that we've been here before. The null empires used to be "too spread out" and there was a very low player density. CCP changed this and now the null empires are much more compact with much higher player density. Now they are "too close together".
---
Note that I don't really have a huge difference of opinion with the pirate logic point. It is silly. But from a game design perspective, this is not new. I wonder if people think more spread will accomplish any goals aside from making super umbrellas harder. Can you think of any downsides? (Hint: there are tons of old threads with lots of reasons who the large sprawl is "killing the game")
---
Yeah, the only one around here making a deal out of her being female is you. Perhaps you should stop proyecting your insecurities onto others? it's not healthy.
---
6 accounts 16gb ram had no issues
---
&gt;If you are actually actively defending a space, then I am not able to gank with impunity by definition. Local doesn't change this.
---
No, it doesn't. That's why you're advocating for something else.
---
&gt;Eve is inherently designed in a way that PvE and moneymaking are used to create a motivation for farmers to undock, take risks, and at times die to other players. The game by design should create risks of dying for farmers. Hunters take emergent risks like getting baited. They don't take risks imposed by game design, because they are not making money off the environment that's supposed to be risky.
---
That's an interesting take on things. My impression that players should be at risk whilst doing *anything* in space, not just PvEing. If you're hunting ratters who can't rely on support from "1000 Titans" or whatever, and can move freely through others' territory like all of the *elite pvp hunters* all push for, then what risk is the hunter taking? How do you reconcile the Doublethink required for you to be able to call in bombers and dreads, but the defender cynoing in help is unfair?
---
It is curious how someone who says in one place that people need to HTFU because Eve is unfair whines in another that others have more and bigger things than them, which prevents them from doing as they please. Could it be that you're actually just interested in improving your own personal experience and don't give a damn about the rest? Seems that way to me.
---
&gt;If the standards for access to ganks in your space protected with 1000 titans is moving my own 1001 titans in your space, then that makes the largest titan blobs immune to gank. Some alliance is mathematically bound to have the largest titan blob, so some alliance's null ratters will always be immune to risk under this system.
---
First of all, I would dearly **LOVE** to see the screenshot where 1000 Titans are dropped in response to a gank attempt. Please let me know when you have one.
---
Secondly, if this is what you legitimately believe, then I must congratulate you on your ability to still post. Most people with this level of brain damage are catatonic.
---
&gt;The kind of null privilege and entitlement you feel to riskless farm, just because you happened to join the largest alliance, is something you should HTFU and give up. Joining an alliance that recruits anyone isn't a sufficient accomplishment that should grant you riskless farm.
---
Strange, if it was riskless farm, I must be imagining the GSF Supers on DPCI's killboard. Well then, they must not have had Cynos or were out of range of backup. [Oh wait, that's](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77583473/) [not quite right either.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77501182/) I dunno, seems like Eve is working as intended to me. Unless you feel like you're entitled to chain-destroy capitals/supercaps whenever you feel like logging on, I guess.
---
Also I'm not sure why you're assuming shit about me. I just rejoined GSF two weeks ago after spending a year or two in j-space. I don't need risk-free farming, I spent a fair portion of that time dropping a Panther worth about the same as all the Dreads you lost on that most recent Nyx kill. I don't mind risk, I mind hypocrites that clothe their selfish aims in supposed righteousness.
---
yeah its insane, branch is probably urbanized to the same level as delve already
---
According to the MER, Delve has been way past 11 for a long time.
---
Marshall will have to design a whole to amp that goes way beyond that.
---
"Disaster Area was a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones and was generally regarded as not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but also as being the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judged that the best sound balance was usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles away from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves played their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stayed in orbit around the planet - or more frequently around a completely different planet."
---
"Their best selling single was released on Earth under the band name PRISM and is titled Spaceship Superstar."
---
How do you feel about the [original version](https://pozniak.pl/wp/eve-online/eveolution-scorpion-battleship-model/) of the Scorpion hull?
---
Personally I love the redesign they did in 2010. I get what you're saying about it being a little too "cool" looking for a Caldari ship but man, it's a sexy spaceship design any way you cut it.
---
They have that. It's called highsec.
---
"new-age vegan woke bollocks". Thank you for such an eloquent description.
---
In regards to point 3, very very few MMOs have engaging gameplay.
---
&gt;You're so sensitive about being wrong.
---
but you're literally wrong
---
man you're the epitome of shocking stupidity, i hope it's not fatal
---
That's what used to be the starter mission.
---
I know when I made my first account, you started in your newbie ship, in space, and in roughly 2 minutes, enemies would spawn and start attacking you.
---
Hey in the future could you stick to crying on reddit about just one thing? You seem to be crying about lots of random things, maybe all the things, and not making any kind of sense or point.
---
This isn’t the post we want but the one we need
---
Yeah, more MMOs die each year than make it to the next.
---
Dude, I'm not talking about the TTC profit sharing nonsense. Literally nobody gives a fuck.
---
I'm talking about how large portions of nullsec are cooperating to leverage the combined economic bloc. About how suddenly everyone is NIP'd because Drifters are cancerous. And so on.
---
Oh its not a not cool design, its just i allways seen caldari as people that make a ship not to worryed about how it would look, as long as it works but the old  design was wonky and kinda messy.
---
Rorqual
---
Let’s see how Local affects things before i buy a Rorq
---
CCP needs this because bounties come out of thin air.
---
My most recent was losing a tengu to a Curse that magicked upon me.
---
We chatted, I complimented him on his kill, we talked about how I had burnt out my other tengu guns before he warped off. We talked about what I was even trying to do with my Tengus, I asked if I could buy some of my loot back from him, etc
---
All pleasant people.
---
And from what I understand 32bit reverse engineering tools are cheap/free and the big bois charge a premium for anything that works with 64bit reliably, so that may impede the development of bots
---
I’m slowly training and getting the bank roll to get into carrier ratting that’s the goal for that account
---
I take your point. There probably could be a middle ground somewhere between the two designs that looks cool while remaining utilitarian.
---
Workload too much?
---
I have another account for that.
---
So he was asleep long enough to run his Indy core out of water, come out of siege... and u fleet warp him...I think my old alliance would have fleet warped him to a keepstar and administered doomsday justice
---
the reason vni bots are nearly impossible to detect is they only do like 10-20 inputs an hour, which isn't enough for ccp to detect a pattern
---
3. is the old insurance fraud revised. It's not that lucrative but if you have a shit ton minerals and don't want to move them... It can be more viable then a long JF route to somewhere where you can sell them.
---
5. is glamourex 75 combined with social 5 making the penalty for declining missions almost nil.
---
No one wants to fight dogshit drifters or other NPCs out of their systems. It's a shit mechanic that doesn't add anything positive and is completely unnecessary.
---
People complain about stagnation and excessive safety because they lack content, implementing shitty NPCs that 'address' those problems doesn't fix anything because the players lacking content are still lacking content.
---
Am I the only person with only two accounts?
---
God that flair couldn't be any more appropriate
---
Yeah the slek cools is gallantes design. Amarrs bingy and flashy an minmatar is all gonna be the kind of ancient looking battle ships pulled back i to service  after speeding years in the dry dock.
---
Ok, you get all your friends and I'll call all of mine.  Together we can stop them.
---
Agency will tell you every time a new anomaly spawns and which anomaly it is
---
If this change is permanent I'd very likely come back to EVE.
---
A so good video with the music of the so good film ;)
---
Ya, most have 17 to 40.
---
I've never said anything about VNI though, just any drone ship would be capable of mindlessly rat.
---
Gila, Rattlesnake, Myrmidom, Dominix, name it.
---
As not wanting to screw with current skill tree , it's just better implement auto-aggro as a tech 2 variant (preventing Alpha clone to utilize) along with more training required (not able to instantly start ratting AFK upon account creation).
---
Not sure of braves umbrella status but frankly the bigger ship you’re in the longer you’ll hold up before the cavalry arrives.
---
You spelled Delve wrong.
---
I completely agree. I would take it a step further, if you don't keep the ADM up, the local rats will destroy your structures. I was hoping this would happen with drifters, maybe it still will. This would surely do a lot to getting rid of all the citadel spam.
---
Windows 10 is an over engineered piece of spyware with a UI/X designed by a man with 6 thumbs.  I learned linux over the last 2 years so i dont have to pay MS for the right to rent my own hardware.
---
How old are these now? 13 years?
---
Saying it over and over doesn't make it true. Makes you seem desperate. I know I'm right. I'm living proof of it hauling two accounts in and out for the last year billions per trip. So... shoo away now. I'm done with you.
---
Maybe time for me to undock that Chremoas...
---
Nyx
---
" CCP has created a common enemy in nullsec, which at a time of structure  stagnation and general "I don't really care" is a very very good thing. "   
---
Yeah what better way to create the blue donut that exists on serenity in tranquility than to give all null players  a common NPC enemy. That's the perfect way to combat stagnation.... Think we all just found Hilamar's reddit account folks.
---
We were in the middle of two wars that covered more than half the fucking map when CCP shit all over them with the drifters...
---
Soon™. Hold the alt key down, then, on the num pad, press 0, 1, 5, 3. Then let the alt key up.
---
If any thing it exacerbates the lack of content because now the NPC's are killing people that could have been content for another player
---
Hey, a fellow fan of Lorn. Nice to meet you.
---
I suspect that a number of them belong to corps, the members of which have won™ Eve. And the only way to remove them would be to wardec a dead corp, or wait, wait, wait for them to get removed in that final patch when they get removed from the game.
---
We have code like that at work. It doesn't get called, but if you comment it out, it no longer builds. I hate Heisenbugs.
---
Wingspan have the nicest delivery agents.  Always willing to work overtime to make sure you get what's coming to you.
---
Bombers Bar is more like if the 'Delta Tau Chi' (ΔΤΧ) house was a [Fleetwood Bounder](https://images.amcnetworks.com/amc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/breaking-bad-episode-101-walt-cranston-1600x720.jpg).
---
The problem is they are extremely tanky AND hit like trains. It's hard to find something to fight a worm that it can't just stat check. On top of that, a lot of them are fit to point kite, but some will AB/scram brawl you.
---
well if they are going to be nothing than content eliminators why not have the eliminate everything?
---
Schrodinger's code.
---
Domi's and myrms seem pretty popular alternatives.
---
Sure. I'm no expert on balance... just saying they have the technology to make it happen. They could possibly even make it have like a wind up time. Like you have to spool it up for 2m before it can jam a cyno but then the person will panic cyno as soon as they're tackled and likely won't have a response fleet ready to jump to them yet.
---
You really think anything's changed since then?         
---
Send me your ISK, I'll double it.
---
We haven't seen you in our hole for like 4 months now. We are often near tradehubs to make it easy for you. Yet you don't deliver anymore. We even discussed this travesty today in our corp voice comms. I needed to explain members who you are! Despite them not being new members anymore. What have you become?
---
No it's not, it's the best way a new player have to make some isk and pay his ships for fleets or pvp.
---
First of all there is no AFK ratting, the only way to rat AFK is botting, period.
---
If you're making a combat anomaly with a drone ship even if you orbit at 30Km you'll have some rats out of range that will keep yellobox you, and that's make your drone idle, no kills, no ticks, no ratting. 
---
Let's be reasonable for a moment, any kind of ratting is bad, mining is bad, ded complexes are bad because of probing, any kind of income is bad. 
---
Think about it, all those things exist long before Eve started to fall apart, before this inflation, before capital, super and citadel proliferation, before botting became a plague, but back then they were not a problem at all. 
---
Ratting is not the problem, same for mining or any kind of farming, they're part of the game like every other mmo.
---
If you are searching for the source of the real problems of this game I suggest you to start looking to injectors.
---
1) That's already a certain things you can't find certain moon types outside certain regions. All rats are assigned to certain regions.   
---
2) fuck no  
---
3) FUCK NO
---
a bot will just make drones attack manually anyway
---
yea its not going to stop shit. a bot lands and locks a bunch of targets. after that it doesn't matter if it takes a while to lock more, it wont chew threw all of its targets before it needs to lock more.
---
Just to get us on the same page, where I have I made a deal out of an individual being female?
---
Drones are just too strong with frig-cruiser hull. 
---
Had a 1v1 with a vexor last night, almost lost it because I was focusing his drones first but he was medium fit. I recalled my drones and threw out the typically max DPS vexor fit and we brawled real close 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77683147/
---
Drones too stronk... the worm has drones + tank/dps. It's the perfect frigate, I'm surprised there's no good equivalent in terms of Gallente frigates with decent drone bays.
---
i've killed hundreds of BRs, and like one yacht
---
really makes you think
---
enjoy having to mash dscan in empty systems because all the ratters have docked up and will wait it out. This won't last you smooth brained idiot. You may have subbed one account but I know someone who unsubbed 16. They will cave when all the multibox miners un sub.
---
Not for much longer
---
All things considered, the simplest answer is usually the correct one.    
---
 -- Occam's razor
---
This should be good.
---
I agree. It’d make it that much harder and easier to detect
---
I really want to know why everything in eve seems to happen at glacial pace.  Especially when I also play warframe and have seen DE push a change to a patch literally a few days before deployment.
---
I suspect this is the beginning of RR becoming the lead Corp in DeadCo.
---
It doesn't matter at all in a void.
---
Yes? I'll gladly give it the old Loki christening
---
"why are u not hlp me i die and lose 14b....."
---
&gt; 3 cynos from staging and in a sebo fit Nyx
---
I agree, but that is a different issue than sov warfare (ADM related stuff)
---
i can understand it for character sales, but yea, for account moves between ones owned by the same person, it's dumb.
---
he joined csm, killed his love for the game. maybe it is lowly growing to love again.
---
You can't complain until you log back in.  Stop winning eve.  I did.  Get your ass back in space. :)
---
I think you're a dumbass without a clue. That's the only positive outcome I'm getting out of this. Hey, maybe I'm just better at Eve than you. Go figure. Sorry mate. Sucks to be you.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, that would make 100% sense. Clear out some systems for your capital/staging and sotiyos, but the rest have to be managed so that you don't make the region worthless to ratters. I mean, it would encourage moving, PvP competition for low ADM space, but yeah no let's have everybody bunker up.
---
bee man good
---
not bee man bad
---
Use the search function. This has been done before.
---
The Kestrel looks fine to me, so does the Heron. Both of them are good quality and fairly iconic. The Burst and Imicus need redesigns the most IMO.
---
It works perfectly well if you think your space has cloaky eyes in all systems and most times
---
I did but I couldn't find one in the last year that covered what I'm asking. Sorry if there is one, just couldn't locate it.
---
What can 3 people do?
---
Lololol
---
It’s already been nerfed about 3 months ago or something into being basically useless in all roles
---
Makes sense.  Space-Hamsters would be freeze-dried.
---
Whoever you decide to join, be sure the Corporation and it's members teach you how to survive in null.  There are right  and wrong ways to survive in null, wormholes, or low sec... wherever you chose.  Find a group that's older and been around for a while, has between 400 to 800 members (that means about 40 to 60 active actual players), and has the infrastructure to support living on the fringe and making isk.  A lot of folks opt into joining the big blocks, such as PH or Karma (if you want to be a Bee), but there are cons to that as well, as you will be player 211243.6.  Find a group that has teamspeak or mumble and ARE ACTIVE and actually talk to each other.  Become a part of that community and you will succeed in EvE... oh, and go to Vegas and party with your mates, that always helps!
---
t. guy who has been proven wrong 3 times and has never suicide ganked before
---
Im biased so i am gonna say Pandemic horde. but there are three good options for a newbro pvp pilot. 
---
\- Karmafleet (goons/Imperium) - they take longer to get recruited but the income in delve is totally worth it. largest supercap fleet in game at the moment. safety in numbers, they have the largest coalition.
---
\- Brave Newbies (legacy) - the other two options on this list provide much better content. But Brave has plenty of resources for new players and could be a good middle ground option.
---
\- Pandemic Horde (panfam) - if you are not scared of a little danger then horde is a good fit. the most active pvp content zone in eve. always a fight, always someone camping, or coming by to initiate a fight. newbean handouts and daily newbean operations that can put you in the hotseat almost immediately.
---
With all that being said be careful about what small corps you join as they could be scams or you could end up in the exact situation you are already in. avoid the ingame recruitment and newbie help channels, they are full of trolls and scams.
---
The Maulus Navy Issue is a Tristan on steroids already. Honestly they don't need better faction frigs, they need to nerf the fucking worm.
---
If you are in Sandya space save up for a mach and do rally points. The escalations sell for 120mil and if u ha e a extra ship to run the escalation they are super easy to run
---
Isn't this a good thing for CCP? It leaves infinite play time as a possibility, but doesn't make it easy. It means the game makes more money, which keeps it from being shut down. I'm new as well so I'm probably just uninformed, but isn't that a good thing for everyone by extension?
---
I've heard nothing but good stuff about Brand Newbros.
---
For major players, see Verite's maps.  https://sov.space/
---
How about an oldschool trowback? 
---
The "Sounds for Flying" suites by Rettic are awesome! a couple of them were lost to time, but the main body was saved by one dude on youtube:
---
https://youtu.be/ZYxTT7aQdxY
---
I remember when he released it, the forums were on fire
---
Back in the days 300mill could get you a month sub. Capitals were the fight changers, back then fights escalating to capitals could get out of hand and groups who loved to join said fights would traverse one side of eve to the other to third party it. Capitals were strong, very strong. Capitals these days are really more like battleships compared to their former selves. 
---
What does this have to do with those moons?
---
You could buy capitals with it. Building them for alliance was something that didn't happen at a large scale like it does today. Miners were hated and actively awoxed often.
---
I didn't say better, I said more in terms of variety :).
---
But yes they do
---
Finally! My torpedo order has been pending for *six months*!
---
tl;dr k-space nullsec systems should bottom-out like... w-space nullsec systems.  
---
This is the correct opinion.
---
Guy who kills shit fit ships and noob pilots with cookie cutter tornado fits thinks he knows more about Eve than a proven vet. But hey, doing what you do says a lot about your personality and lack of life to be honest. More proof for me that you're clueless. 
---
Cheers.
---
There's something to be said for having the ability to take some steps to ensure a system's safety. Sure you can cloaky camp a wormhole, but the residents can roll and then crit the entrances and keep cloaky eyes on them to ensure that no shenanigans occur. There is no way for 100 dudes to just bust out of nowhere and shove it up your butt, particularly with any sort of larger ship hulls. Furthermore, because connections change so often camping a hole is somewhat useless because the odds of having a good connection 3 days later are so low for many places.
---
In Nullsec, that safety was provided by local. I could know when something potentially dangerous was in system even if I was unsure what it might be, and act accordingly. You can look up those names on zkill and find activity times, types of ships dropped. You can look up the corp and alliance of the camper. This was in part necessary because of the amount of firepower one little manticore can summon with a cyno.
---
All other solutions to this issue for Nullsec are quite imperfect. Cyno jammers do nothing against covert cynos. Bubbles on gates don't help when you don't know what is in system already. I can't roll a gate if I suspect there's a dangerous gang 5j out. 
---
If someone needs to actively be at the computer to rat (which is perfectly reasonable, and I'm all for), then I think it's fair to say that anyone looking to hunt me needs to also be at their computer, or risk getting blapped. The solution proposed here is dumb. But a structure that has a 30 minute spool time and turns of all cloaking devices in the system is both completely irrelevant to anyone at their computer or actively doing blops/hunting/hotdropping capitals, and allows people who want to prepare a system to rat in the ability to at least CHECK for people cloaked in system, even if those people immediately recloak.
---
I get some hitching with the 64bit client even with potato settings. 
---
Can't say how many times I've replaced my assemblage of damp cardboard since the I was running the 2003 client on a laptop now old enough to vote.  Guess it's that time of the decade again.
---
I see your side on it and you do bring up a decently sounding new mechanic as well as a good argument for your point but I’d have to agree with the other guy and say get rid of auto aggression for combat drones. Let’s make bots easier to detect as well as nerf some AFK ability in this game
---
Criterion is recruiting
---
Ok but only if you make your hardpoints auto-attack what you've told your drones to shoot.
---
That is completely logical, and nothing will ever come of it.

This message is sponsored by the generals who dispatch endless battleship squadrons to Motsu.

Join horde if you want fun
---
This is bait.
---
In the server-side world we do this all the time and it's no big deal. Downloaded software is a whole other situation. Those Icelandic folks have guts.
---
I’m pretty sure you can use ISBoxer now as well as other multi boxing programs, you just can’t input broadcast.
---
      
---
That aside if you want a small group of good guys to hang with I’d recommend trying to find a WH Corp in the r/evejobs sub.   I myself went from null to WH and haven’t regretted the move one second. Just be prepared for shit to get weird in there, what happens in a wormhole, stays in a wormhole....except Rage and Thera, the latter spits out Wingspan Delivery Services like grandma spits her teeth when grandads package of blue pills comes to the door.
---
One day our grandchildren will play 32-bit retro games.

So how long until they hit the A zed 5 button

i'd like to know that, too. been hearing it a lot, but it might just be wishful thinking.
---
KM delays just make sense, especially if it makes the transition from ship to pod 0.25 seconds faster.
---
Mining in hisec sure sounds boring.
---
I can Omega just fine, that is not why I ask. I am looking for fun ways to generate good isk/h.
---
Buying PLEX is not fun either.
---
Do you have a good suggestion? Or other things to avoid?
---
Never heard it quite put that way hahahha
---
Genuine question; why would you not simply get rid of auto-aggro altogether?
---
USD $$$
---
I'll check out that sub. For what I used ISBoxer for, the input broadcasting was essential. It's okay, I'm over it and I'm happy to leave my 16-account days in the past.

Why are auto-targeting missiles still exist?
---
LowSec is also a great place to learn some small game stuff, without some of the Null complications.

I've been trying to get now involved in small gang and solo fights, and found heaps of opportunities there
---
I dunno; you tell me!

gorillions of space monkeys died in their holocauster.

As an effective ECM countermeasure obviously.

Almost any ship utilize either drone or missile, seldom together (Guristas the very exception) and for those who don't utilize missiles, drones are their only hope against excessive ECM attack (and yes Guristas rats again). Auto-targeting missile require an Omega skill to operate, if without adjusting current skill tree, a tech 2 auto-aggro drone with low DPS would be a great counterpart.
---
Local isn’t gone just yet. Sometime this month though
---
This was pretty interesting .
---
It is not different. Its part of the entire playstyle that emerges from taking and living in space; it actively rewards you for turtling in one system and punishes you for overextending. Right now, it's a losing proposition to own too much space for yourself, but people still need buffer zones against their enemies - This is what's led to the emergence of vassal states in the game. It is directly related to the ADMs, just not for sov war related purposes.
---
Well as I’m sure you can see apparently
---
“EvE is burning” lol so it’s hard to tell what the alliance stance is on Rorq right now and before a newbie like me just goes and buys one I wanna hear back from leadership on what the plans are.
---
Lame I’ll take advantage while I can at least, maybe I’ll stick around or just go back to sitting in station training my toons and waiting on something fun and new to pop up on reddit 
---
Hmmmm never thought of that 
---
I’m assuming you mean smartbombing the sites I should give that a try.
---
I like style B the best.
---
Already use that to find the accounts for now haha trying to get to where I don’t need to.
---
Hey, I'm on that Machariel kill mail!  In a freaking Merlin.  Neat.
---
Best is probably to Insurance Fraud it, or you could reprocess it and take it out in large amounts of minerals, the Insurance is probably worth more though.
---
I've always said, if drones were meant to be a main damage system, they should equip to high slots like guns.  5 slots, 5 drones...  I really think they should act like weak fighters and have more control, but when killed give a kill mail as well. 
---
But as per usual, and how I was taught as a child - "opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. " - Herbert Lehr

I've been having fun flying with them since i left BNI proper and nullsec to fly with them.

---
multiboxing you can do t5s in hawks or retris. Hawks for darks, retris for the rest. 
---
for solo, T3 is the highest you can comfortably go. T4 is doable, as is T5 solo but it's really risky and your success rate won't be perfect
---
I would prefer this to blackout
---
Looks like an older video so maybe due to outdated mechanic? but that’s a good question. I myself would have brought a cap booster or two in the mobile depot but I’m not too experienced with the logi side of things. I’m just now training into it so who am I to say
---
So I guess you missed the part where Frat is actually fighting and has only lost 3 systems over several months?
---
So what would be the goal of your idea?
---
WH groups are pretty legit/laid back.    
---
LS has a few chill groups too. If you're US TZ, check out Templis CALSF, Purple Helmeted Warriors, a few others I'll think of later. :)
---
Obviously, but the majority of people who use Linux for gaming enjoy the challenges that come with it. Besides if you only play EVE then it runs almost perfectly on Linux anyway so there's no reason not to use it
---
I just wanna know wth Falcon is doing behind that wall of computery doodads
---
This is actually wrong, btw.
---
I know in a gila I can(could? Haven't tried since the drone hp nerf) afk full drone sites, zero input from warp in and drop drones to site finish.
---
Can I have an imperial version?
---
Use it for bait!!!!!  Fill it with exotic dancers (male), some corpses and drugs. Get freaky with it!!!! just go to church on Sunday and you’ll be alright.  👌
---
I'm currently using Windows because of DRM bullshit with other games, but I think your best bet is using Proton via Steam. I was having problems with EVE not using DirectX 11 when I used Lutris and the WINE launcher posted on the forums.
---
Both the 32 and 64-bit client were working fine for me on Ubuntu. There are also no tweaks you need to do with the latest versions of Proton.
---
Hey man,
---
Can you tell me more about it?
---
Nice 8) it was a fun roam
---
When you have the power of the umbrella and common sense, you don't need to worry about thing. By the way, like i said in youtube i make little more.
---
active damage control represented by a briefcase
---
+1
---
Exactly
---
That's exactly my point. The game is shit as it is, there is zero reason for the little content that does exist to be consumed by NPCs out of all things.
---
Until you get hit by a spy like in many of my videos and you cant eve tank while waiting for back up.
---
Friends hahahaha eve hahahaha you're funny comon now
---
Variations on the theme:
---
* Auto-Drones take double bandwidth, or 
---
* Auto-Aggro is off by default for all drones. Add an active high-slot module that doubles drone bandwidth, and enables Auto-Aggro.
---
The second option opens up ship options for fitting/cap/bandwidth bonuses.
---
My current thinking is that Auto-Drones aren't going to have good resale value. Looting abandoned drones is good ISK for new players.
---
This is from a time before we had cap booster 3200s. At that time, 800s we're the largest charge. 800s don't do shit for caps. 
---
This archon was fit initially for cap regen. A cap regen archon, well managed, could survive neuts long enough to coast out of triage. This would allow the other triage to rep them and refill the cap. This was also before the combat refitting change so you can see them switch between tank, and cap regen fits. 
---
Pro tip. Cap regen fits are still possible on faxes, but they have been changed to booster + tank fits since combat refitting was taken away. Cap regen fits don't tank nearly enough to survive triage, especially since the fleet sizes have greatly increased. In my opinion, combat refitting coming back would be good for the game. It still required a lot of skill. I don't remember why they took it out. 
---
You also see mention of the pantheon fit. Think rr domis but with carriers. Rooks and Kings Clarion call 2 covers this pretty well.
---
... ehhh ECM doesn’t break your lock on the ship that’s jamming you. Since the October pass the primary countermeasure to ECM is to simply shoot whatever’s jamming you.
---
its for lazy people like me
---
you get better damage with real missles but you have to work more. bots if they want the best damage already use normal missles. its the lazys ones that use auto which they wont get rid of. if any thing they should add t2 auto missles.
---
Solo isk making I’d for sure get into exploration either for pirate sites in C1-3’s or in NPC null.
---
   You can also run escalations and also check out belt ratting in Lowsec.
---
Here is the relevant package for installation on Arch Linux
---
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/evelauncher/
---
The second idea is hard to realize. Let's say I have deployed 100Mbit of drones, then activate such module, what happens? It's gonna take 200MBit which most ships don't have, are two random drones going disconnect?
---
The first one is kinda, idk, cheap fix? But that works too. Then a question arises: how are you going to implement them? Faction? Storyline? The very easy way is again going tech 2. I'm just a bit worried that's going overnerf since doubling MBit need also halves effective hitpoints. I'd really just make a tech 2 with same MBit but 30%\~50% cut on DPS comparing to tech 1 counterpart.
---
A shitty player? You mother's embarrassment? Am I supposed to know? Should I care? Is this your attempt to make yourself feel worthy?

In some distros we have native packages setup for the eve launcher to make it super easy install.

---
Was insurance really worth it?
---
Lemme get this straight, your solution to drive war **as opposed to our current stagnation** is to   
---
1) make sov easier to manage at scale,  
---
2) not have drifters reinforce citadel spam,  
---
3) prevent supers from quickly escalating so that the first one with the most supers in-system has the advantage,  
---
4) make null the sole source of "big boy" moon ores, and  
---
5) even cut down on regular highsec ore?  
---
Is this a troll post, or are you actually so indoctrinated in the idea of  Nullsec-exceptionalism that you think Nullbears are a driver for war?  
---
2, 3, and 4 are how it used to work, and it didn't drive war; it helped create the blue donut.
---
Been failing to properly pvp since january 2010. I started right before the tyrannis patch that introduced pi. At that time, robotics and other stuff that comes from pi was sold by npc market sell orders
---
We don’t deliver munitions in Thera as a general rule, actually. You are much more likely to lose a ship in Thera to Volta / Therapy etc.
---
But yeah, WH space is a great, unpredictable adventure. Definitely a fun game mechanic.
---
Remove jumpdrives from Supers. Caps can still jump. Supers have to take gates.
---
Bring back combat refitting
---
Agents still get fined for not being in that safety zone around a B274. That'll never change.

not only does it work, but now with DXVK, the vulkan dx11 backend, performance at max settings is great.

My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my  mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren  graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes  when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately.  Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and  destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put  your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At  28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight  sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me  cancer anyway.
---
What’s brutal about that? It’s exactly the same as before.
---
Notice the brackets and the lack of chevrons for ships, this video is super old and back in the day of recharge triage and combat refitting.
---
Best isk in Hs is T4 abyssal which you can do as alpha. Incursions with warp to me and also level 4s
---
It sounds crazy if you haven't seen it done properly but with modern development practices you can deploy multiple times per day and everybody's stress level goes way down from the old-fashioned approach with big, infrequent releases. It's not something most teams can jump instantly into though; there is a bunch of work to do to get there. Once people see continuous delivery work they never want to go back.
---
Yeah we're getting into semantics I think. It's different because you affect one and not the other if you wanted to, or you can affect both at the same time. The case in question was making low activity systems relatively harder than it is when compared to high activity systems. Having to turtle is a different strategic choice than purposely not ratting other systems to keep the ADM's high in the proposed case. Overall I think we all agree and would like a change towards something like this; we're saying the same thing, just picking out different perspectives of it
---
&gt;It's gonna take 200MBit which most ships don't have, are two random drones going disconnect?
---
Yeah, pretty much. Random is fine. If you want to choose which drones remain active, manually abandon the others. Or recall them, which you can do while under ECM. 
---
&gt; The first one is kinda, idk, cheap fix? But that works too. Then a  question arises: how are you going to implement them? Faction?  Storyline? The very easy way is again going tech 2. 
---
Personally, I'd just make Auto-Drones work like FAF missiles; dependent on a \[new\] specific Skill. The Skill can be gated behind Omega, or left Alpha. 
---
I don't really care how the blueprints and materials are sourced. They could just be straight T1 objects, or they could be Faction and require BPC and/or material drops.  
---
&gt;I'm just a bit  worried that's going overnerf since doubling MBit need also halves  effective hitpoints. I'd really just make a tech 2 with same MBit but  30%\~50% cut on DPS comparing to tech 1 counterpart. 
---
I think a *small* nerf isn't going to change anything. AFK ratters won't mind lower ticks too much as it won't affect their APM in the slightest. 
---
Double bandwidth *could* be excessive, yes. Especially when you look at the numeric difference between regular and FAF missiles. But FAF missiles require periodic F1 presses from reloading, and they *do* run out. Drones have that theoretic possibility of lasting forever.
---
Not every ship is expected to be re-modelled simultaneously.

Look in to exploration

The main question is how big and developed do you want to go?

Want big? Go to brave noobies, TEST, PH, or Goons
---
Want medium? Try provibloc corps (CVA, -7-, and apoc are the biggest 3)
---
want small? Can't really help you there, but there's a good number.
---
A hyperspacial untanked nyx, why am I not surprised?

no yes
---
You know what a B274 is?
---
Will that increase or decrease the superiority of Goonswarm? What metric are we turning up to 11 lol
---
Cool. Have an upvote.
---
I think the answers are Yes and No.
---
Yes someone or multiple people have. No enough time has not passed for it to be possible without injectors etc.
---
haha yeah a single timer system with counterplay that immediately began producing some money and was usuable for reactions (as well as limited by moon number) is definitely the same as a triple timer system for something so cheap and meaningless you can drop 1000 in a system :)
---
Might be a bit out of your price range but gilas are great with missiles and drones. Unironically a drake might work as well if you can take it into a 4/10

Alphas can't cloak. Not even the ittiest speck of rust on an Rifter's wing can cloak if it's an alpha pilot.

PIRAT is typically 15 guys each with over 80 million skill points and they love to bully newbies. Dunno why, but it's always been that way. Thankfully they mostly operate out of Amarr space so if you prefer hisec you can go on the other side of the map. Otherwise, like the others said, you can always go out and join a nullsec corp. Karmafleet is the beez kneez. Just sayin'!
---
There are ppl with maxed SP, but not by way of training.
---
Max SP by way of training is probably in the 300+m sp range.
---
Have you considered that you can't actually take a Rorqual to hisec?
---
400 to 800 members gives 40-60 actual players? Yeah just conformation that taking a pvp corp into the donut will rot it from the inside. If you want to find an active group where you can learn to properly pvp, join a wormhole corp with 200 or so members. There will be about 60 active players to teach you
---
you too!

---
This ship can absolutely make it out of there, but it will be a pain. What people are missing here is that a wandering k162 can spawn into your hole from a c5. Itll be a large with enough mass to get it out. From there you need a c5 to null , again this is contingent on basically the stars aligning.
---
Possible, but I would probably insurance fraud it

the only place you are hearing it is here on reddit from people theory crafting.

On the behalf of r/PrequelMemes , and r/freefolk: thank you for your assistance in the fight against the ones who claim r/PrequelMemes is a dead sub. Will will never forget this, and are eternally grateful.
---
My suggestion would be to pick a "lifestyle" that sounds interesting to you, whether it be lowsec, nullsec, wormholes, and join a corp (or EveUni) that will give you a chance to try it out.
---
Your question was specifically how to make isk.  My point was that when you can in effect buy 100mil ISK for a buck, you should be worried about what's fun to do, not what the ISK return is.
---
If you can find fun, the ISK should eventually follow.
---
The issue with bots is CCP refuses to invest the needed money in a team to handle them. Making gimick changes to nullsec as a way to avoid confronting bots head on is the pinnacle of lazy game design.
---
RHML Praxis
---
Works perfect through Steam/proton and I didn't have to edit any settings for it to work. Just some wacky movement when moving the launcher around the screen.

And there are ways to beat no local, namely a clocked ship sitting on gate watching what comes in.
---
There is a guy in my Corp with 10 or 15 vni alts. He played league of legends while ratting. he is afk from eve 99% of the time and just sends his vni alts to new sites either between games of LOL or between deaths. Basically he isn’t a bot because he IS at his computer...but he isn’t playing eve, VNI online is playing itself with some minor input from him.
---
They'd be wrong though.
---
The hate builds from within.
---
What made Induc bad? I’m not trying to argue I just want to know what to look out for
---
But CCP has added skills since he was banned, so it might be the case anymore.
---
Wormholes, absolutely. Best space in the game, largely due to the mentality.
---
And, of course, who would I recommend but MCAV?
---
Hi I'm the change. I am the hate. You are the weak. You be broken.
---
" Then why has it not been implemented? " 
---
Because Hilmar is a cheap fuck.
---
" What's stopping CCP from using then resources available for free to them? "  
---
Part of Eve's sale involved them hitting certain financial goals after the sale... Why do you think things like the alliance tournament and fan fest suddenly got thrown under the bus and the reasoning behind it was "this stuff costs money and doesn't make us any money"?
---
Gotta keep those margins up to qualify for the full sale price to PA
---
The problem with anomalies is people will read about them and be posting about them still years from now proposing nerfs - meanwhile they were already nerfed into oblivion.
---
Havens and Sanctums in a good system is going to support 2 players in their supers - past that you're likely waiting on respawns or getting lower ticks as you share. These same systems support a dozen subcaps in the lower anomalies.
---
The same systems used to support several capital class ships. So these ships already have to spread out (as other posters have mentioned) and the total bounties collected have taken a truly massive nose-dive over the least several months. Like, earth-shattering the game is dead level nose-dive.
---
Your idea is good, better then anything CCP came up with - but you truly are beating a dead horse.
---
You need to be far more self-sufficient in a wormhole than in null. If you're looking to be lax and just login to shoot pre-determined ops, stay in null. If you want to log in and contribute via scanning/hunting/else, a wormhole is a good place to go.
---
I think a few people have with injectors. IIRC there was a major streamer who used donations to buy PLEX which he sold to get a bunch of injectors which he used to get all skills to V.
---
From just natural training, no injectors? No. There's something like 20 years' worth of skills to train. Getting all skills to IV (except for the skills you need to train to V to train other skills) is only like eight years, though, and all skills to III is like two. So it's definitely feasible there exist characters with all skills &gt;III/&gt;IV.
---
wh , null is stagnate and boring atm
---
Anyways, plug for BNI, which seems to have a nice contingent of bitter vets who really do believe in the “let’s help noobs, and perhaps by teaching we learn to be less crap ourselves” mindset.
---
Continuous deployment/delivery or not you should always be around to support changes and deal with the fallout.
---
We know they can't, it has been over a year now and issues continue to drop up.
---
wh is far better than null
---
r/eve 2 years ago: 
---
&gt; null empires are way to spread out, they should have to use their space
---
r/eve now:
---
&gt; nullsecers are using their space too much, they should spread out.
---
unfortunately most bots are scripted to manually target and send bots after rats this wouldn't do much
---
Only it's not. It's a great way to fast travel but it actually sucks.
---
ookay. then let's make drifters all across new eden, including w space. don't want any "unnecessary" structures or krabbing, now do we.
---
Worst idea ever. Drifters are CCP's excuse to cut down on structure proliferation. But consider this, we were pushed ever since the Casino war to move to citadels. So we dutifully obeyed and built them. Got so good at building them, that we spammed down citadels everywhere in our space. CCP changed the game mechanic to make them easier to kill. So we went to war and glass Tribute, removing proliferation of citadels from enemy territories. NCPL tried to do the same to us and failed. Not really our fault we are dealing with entities that can't compete.  
---
Not wanting BoB Mark 2, they bring in Drifters to deal a shake up to nullsec. Read, they don't want the Imperium to dominate the game, even though for many years, PanFam dominated the map and no one complained and nor did they bring in Drifters.
---
What this does, is remove the sandbox play style to one of Game Master lead play style. It fundamentally changes the way the game works. So in 'fixing' one issue, they open a pandoras box on the whole fundamentals of this game.
---
Injectors. Ironbank probably mostly for bragging rights but also IMO to make a statement about his wealth.
---
He has since been banned, so while somebody did do it there may not be any active accounts that have done it.
---
You could also argue that skills have been added since his banning and this question so it's possible that nobody has trained all skills at the time of this question to V. However you cannot definitively say nobody has.
---
Probably not though.
---
Hi I see that MCAV is a C5 based corp. Is there a big difference in corps based out of high class wormholes vs low class?
---
OP is worried his racist comments against the minmatar that were acceptable in the early 2000s will be uncovered and exposed ruining his promising career as an FC
---
Yes, I agree, but don't guzzle it. So many people would seem to really think the spin was real.
---
no it doesnt far better than 24/7 afk havens and then having to travel 100 jump to find content just to have that  immediately dock up
---
Former Brave member here:
---
Based on your description. I would honestly say BNI. Lots of bittervets to relate with, and lots of new players that you can help out. 
---
However, I mostly say BNI because nobody cares if you lose a 4B Mach over there.
---
Please go elsewhere this is an afk-pvper free zone.
---
That's not true. If it was, you'd be able to bring caps into a C2 as well (which you can't).
---
ah okay, good luck to you then
---
not gonna be as much a difference soon ;)
---
All this shit going on is really making me want to get back in Eve. It's been far too long and the pvp is just too damn addicting.
---
A c2 should never have an xl hole open into it ever if it dose I call pos code fuckery
---
Maybe if they buy our garage doors they will also buy all the navy apocs we have flooded the market with pls ty
---
You didn't get my point do you? I mean being in an alliance alone doesn't make you a "screeching pubby". If you think I am wrong you can always point out why instead of dismissing me because I am a Goon.
---
That's because TEST and Feat are evenly matched, and Frat refuses to join the Blue donut. That's why there is content there.
---
Imperium have optimized themselves out of content. Burning structures for a month is not a war. 
---
Eve need and incentive to avoid large coalitions, but I'm not quite sure how they'd do it.
---
Holy shit that thread has a collective IQ in the double digits
---
So the new meta will be not cloaky camping at all because paranoid ratters will be convinced that somebody is always watching.
---
A year of running past CODE schmucks and all the wannabe gankers on two alts isn't luck. It's called being better at Eve. 
---
I've been here 16 years pal. Ran my own alliance. Owned pretty much all of Vale at one point. Took a long vacation and came back to nubs like you thinking they know shit because they can lock and alpha a shit fit hauler.

Pick the ship. Pick the time. Let's duel. Otherwise. Ba-bye.

I hope so many goons just quit. Deep in their souls they are mostly just cowards. Turbo krabbing all day to buy faction capitals and multiple rorquals. Mittens and friends getting salty fuels my soul.
---
I think the Diamond rats should shoot bubbles.
---
The fact that you ran tackle in fleets and had to cover your own loss is absurd
---
Yeah its already done some guy injected 7000$ worth of injectors
---
enjoy wallowing in your stupidity and ignorance, hope it isn't fatal
---
More ISK, mostly. More and better content, as well, since people can bring limited caps and you can get good fights.
---
I know you're being sarcastic, but never underestimate the greed of the krab
---
Funny enough I just bought a garage door (daughter drove through mine, forgetting she was on the gas and not the brake). When I was getting estimates I had three companies give me a catalog for Amarr garage doors. I told my wife "I wonder if I can get an Armageddon door?".
---
Insurance fraud before it gets nerfed
---
Dude, capital ratting in a wormhole is far riskier than in nullsec. While you can close the open wormholes, a new one can pop up at any time. Wormhole groups roll holes all the time trying to catch people ratting in caps. Many a time have I been just starting a siege cycle when a new sig opens up. I've lost several dreads to getting dropped on. I have also never seen or killed any of the drifter "bosses" with citadel weapons.
---
Your grandfather would of had a better last three years if your mother was not such a selfish cunt
---
I thought clok is 4 bad and not allow for the honourueure
---
How does one keep track of the macros programmed to such a vast array of buttons?
---
They had basically the same ratting bounty figures as delve in the last MER
---
100% Agree
---
You really thinking bring in a 500 man fleet with no warning, establishing hole control and then rolling holes until we get a good connection to start bridging in freighters wouldn't work for 99% of wormholes?
---
Rage took that long because init vastly overprepared, and it was the most heavily defended wormhole. Plus, Init really didnt want to fail. With a general attack on wormholes, we can fail a lot, and it won't matter because keeping the pressure up means that the next attack will be that much more likely to work
---
If you want to learn how to do actual PvP and not just press F1 in huge fleets, I highly recommend you stay in lowsec. Faction Warfare is a very good entry and there are several corps that will happily take newer players and show you the ropes.
---
Vily got out voted by Goons and PH.  This happens when you only get 1 vote.  Also, thanks for the income.  Its pretty DOPE.
---
No one had trained
---
Them. Why do that when you can inject them all
---
That isn't a thing you octagonal doughnut.
---
Generally, well organized and manned corps will be in high-class space.
---
Lower class is for the disorganized, undermanned, newer wormhole corps.
---
Just read 64 bit client is becoming default. I already opted into 64 bit. What exactly are the advanteges of 64bit? Just runs faster?
---
Try using zkill... 3 times. I know it seems like a stretch to get 3 whole sets of information to add together, when obviously it would be easier to find a custom tool designed to achieve this very singular task. But you could, in fact, just make 3 queries to zkill.
---
What are paps?
---
With no local ratting in nullsec is by far much riskier than anything you do in wormholes. There is no such thing as hole control and with the existence of cyno's your death could be 8 light years away in another constellation or even region.
---
Sadly, no it wouldn't turn that way. It would make access to them very much locked. I suspect null blocks would embargo hulls even leaving null. 
---
Also T2 offer very different opportunities than T1 hulls.
---
You cannot replace things like Blops, Recons and Bombers with anything else.
---
Some T2 are already prohibitively expensive to use, and that diverts players away from them. Just look at the Blops.
---
I'll take your repetition as meaning you've gone full looney farm and that you're chicken shit scared of a real 1 v 1. Best of luck next time scrub.
---
How do I find these corps without just asking in chat?
---
Just Please for the love of GOD upload everything on youtube!
---
I can't see the fault in this argument.
---
&gt; and also level 4s
---
do you mean lv4 missions? Cus they recently removed those from alphas.
---
It rhymes so it must be true.
---
They didn't ban isboxer.
---
They just don't let you cut up the screen and input broadcast.
---
Underrated post
---
lol everyone got baited
---
I'm not completely familiar with the current FW corps, but you should find some on [https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/) and the official forums. Alternatively, you can join a militia to your liking (it's an NPC corp then) and ask in militia chat. From my experience people are quite chatty there and will gladly help you out.
---
not sure if you can use combat scanners (it can be done with dscan, but more work to do), go to any system that has missions, for example Lanngisi , where people run LVL4s for SOE, and scan for drones, wrecks of ships, wrecks of rats , loot, salvage, sell. Kinda fun and easy isk.
---
They did both of those.
---
Except the covert triglav is a AT ship or something
---
Nope.
---
Only c5 and c6 can have womrhole connect with that much mass.
---
Yea I’m seeing there’s only been 1 lost and it was a 235B killmail so I don’t think I’ll go for that 
---
Already killed 7 ratters tonight because they can’t warp out the second I pop in local which is nice :)
---
Here I was about to sell my Loki because I never got to use it haha
---
Wonder how much of that is bots lol
---
&gt; You want the Drifters gone? Play the game. 
---
But, it's not fun. Why don't I do something fun instead?
---
I was a proponent of replacing Local with Regional.
---
Regional chat instead of Local.
---
You need to have at least 12 IQ
---
Infinite spawning anoms are a good mechanic and shouldn't be changed drastically
---
I think local should be available based on system infrastructure... if they hack your nodes or blow your comms thingy up your comms drop... keeping a fleet tucked away until the lights go out would be amazing
---
this is a VERY good idea and i like it a lot
---
Malpaise is not the most active pvp zone in the game ;) can't make that claim anymore
---
Kikimoras everywhere :)
---
how about unblue half of eve, then you will be able to kill each other
---
The point u/stainguy is making is that ever has not been high risk/rewards for a while now. I was disputing the point of wormhole capital ratting not being risky. Yes, if/when local is deleted in null it will make it riskier but, as of right now wormhole ratting is far riskier than turbo krabbing in delve where there is a Keepstar in every system and titans on every gate when a small gang gets reported 10 jumps away in intel chat.
---
Oh right, forgot
---
😕
---
Abyssals it is!
---
If you ever typed in local when I was there, I have the log stored.
---
“active actual players”... time zone plays a big part of it also.  I do admit some wormhole groups are extremely active in PvP and very good at it.
---
Probably most of it, their numbers shouldn’t even come close to Delve considering how many people live there vs Branch
---
No.
---
Test guy trying to Dinosplain.
---
Lol
---
Except they are going to pvping from lowsec or null right right next to lowsec.
---
While I cant remember the exact system they are staging from, its not opsec just cant remember.  There will still be plenty of pvp on the doorstep
---
4 accounts 7.4gb ram used. With browser, discord, TS and other apps open. 1st EVE instance puts me to 3.8gb. 2nd to 5gb, 3rd to 6.2gb, 4th to 7.4gb. A consistent increase of 1.2gb per instance.
---
lmao maybe instead you should just get good
---
Nobody besides bear corps actually fear getting evicted. And any good corp has an evacuation plan.
---
Malpaise is very much a safe zone, no npc null etc
---
This user was permanently banned for this post, by the way.
---
I thought it was me he was saying that too... I feel less lied tota least.  I dont think he's ever coming back... TQ couldn't take the Greekness.  Is too spicy.
---
Amazing.
---
YES, 8,000,000,000 bytes of RAM, to store math and beautiful space pixels!!!
---
yes but horde aren't moving to malpaise, they are moving to etherium reach.  They can carebear in malpaise but horde are specifically staging from lxq2-t will be the main staging for them
---
I mighta spit a little milk
---
How broken is it?
---
times 70 users... which is exactly what I did.  RIP my afternoon.

I'd like to avoid that next deployment... I think I can take an API from eve knife?? Not 100% sure, but if i could just get the raw data in excel I'd be more than happy to do the heavy lifting.

Managing refits in triage was one of the most fun things back then, I still miss it
---
I am sad for your game experience, like deep down on the inside... you can (probably) do better.
---
Great response, thank you sheep :)
---
Personally it will be TZ that should drive you...cause being in either space in a group that isnt your TZ is terrible.
---
WHs require alot more self taught skills to conduct day to day tasks and tends to be a more close nit community from a comms perspective. Smaller fights mean more in WHs than NS.
---
NS will tend to have alot more content available PvE and PvP wise for those that dont know how to find it themselves. Geoups tend to be larger and logisitcs is easier.
---
fREEEEEE intel
---
when the old tree falls all thats left is the roots...
---
 It was not literal. Even still there is likely 100,000 active players that account for the 15,000+ characters online daily. Seems like a goofy thing to nitpick.
---
There are more posts talking about people's salty spam then posts that are actually salt-laden spam. It's mostly downtrodden goobers desperate for a "win" and they make-believe CCP is batting for them. 
---
The actual salt went from 11 of 10 outrage to 3 of 10 within just a few days. The masses want to see how this pans out and how best to balance/tweak/utilize the changes. Whether or not they're good for the health of the game which remains to be seen.
---
Don't mention it buddy, we can be chill instead if you like...
---
Text stuff. Probably stored some place, text files don't take up much room and CCP likely keeps them around for some time so they can back check you in case the need for them to do so ever arises. (although how long, no idea.)  
---
Then again....the logs never show anything so maybe they don't.
---
Voice/Audio wise. Probably not, I doubt they record anything said, larger storage required, not really worth it to do so either considering such a small (guessing) volume of users use the ingame voice options and default to out of game clients such as Discord, Mumble, TS3.
---
They haven't set a date so it could literally happen at dt any time this month

Wormholes.

Other faction data sites also contain filaments. You have just been unlucky with them.

[The Scope - Triglavians Take Over Billboards](https://youtu.be/v2Mj8g4k2Gs) (Sansha are at 1:10 "Corrupted narodnya must be extirpated")

The Sansha's Incursions have also reduced since the Triglavian Invasion started.
---
The system was made that way so that systems that you don't actively use are easier to take away from you. Obviously because of citadels and capital projection it doesn't quite achieve that goal fully but it is absolutely the RIGHT sentiment to SOV. If you're not there actively occupying it you shouldn't be able to hold it.
---
...except the blackout hasn't happened, so they can just warp out the second you pop into local.
---
Can't believe i agree with a snuff .... but 100% agreed.
---
fleet participation tracker
---
So used to whs that I never even bothered to check local to verify, must have been killing poorly coded bots then
---
It's not going to stop the servers from shitting the bed, though. Waiting 2 minutes for an action to be processed is still unacceptable.
---
Those are dank
---
agree. same think happened to my city so it's a IRL comparison. Mayor closed a central road and made it only for people to walk and reduce pollution and traffic around that historic area. Of course people were mad for a few months, then they came around to see how nice that place evolved without cars, lol.
---
Sould read new bro, my bad
---
Because your point is ridiculous and it's about as anti-Goon as it gets. Go post your point on SA, they'll rip you apart.
---
"  If TEST decided to jump in 1000 Titans to the front lines " They jumped all the ones they had to thre front lines and FRAT kept on fighting because unlike the north they actually USED the defensive structures and their bridges to counter  Test's super and titan advantage. The ONE time NC actually used their defensive structures and super/titan fleet and forced a gate fight they shredded the goon fleets they were fighting for the SH1 timer, and then never did it again.
---
I find making isk fun
---
Too many ... they put a whole bot alliance into fade and the parts of deklein when darkness kicked slyce out of gotg (deadco) ... slowly they're moving more agressive ppl down there in terms of activly roaming ... the point of entrances, makes it pretty easy to kinda defend their space in deklein, especially with that 2R- system.
---
wherever horde is the content will be there. LXQ is literally right next door to our old content zone. Paala is 6 jumps from oijanen. look at a map lol
---
Or just afk players
---
Well Ranger Regiment is pushing quite aggressivly. So over the long term, it wouldn't be hard for them to kick darkness out of they need the space for their active people in VNI's *cough cough* :P
---
What the fuck👀
---
Very firefly-like.
---
There are a few options
---
-Exploration. Go out and hunt for some data and relic sites. Maybe explore some wormholes. There are lots of youtube videos that can help you get started.
---
-Abyssal sites. Join the 'abyssal lurkers' chat channel in game and look at the fits in the MOTD. Ask for tips and advice in the channel.
---
-Security agents. There's not much money in this, honestly. Would not recommend.
---
-Incursions. This might be more of a long term goal for you, but alpha accounts can still fly in the WarpToMe high sec incursion fleets. 100M+ isk per hour. Really friendly group, google them and join their in game channel
---
-Mining. Same as security agents, not much money plus it's super boring
---
-Market/station trading. Buy low and sell high. Move items from where they're plentiful to where they're scarce and make some isk.
---
Sorry you've had shit luck with corps so far. The experience you've had so far is not the best Eve has to offer. If you want to give group play one last shot, join one of the mega null corps like Horde, Brave, TEST, or Goons. They have everything you'll need, including guides for how to make isk and fleet ops. They'll have ship handouts and SRP available so even if you're space poor you're still included. And, of course, lots and lots of members always on for you to ask questions, get advice, etc. There's even group ratting and mining ops so you all make money together rather than you having to figure it all out yourself.
---
Just my 2 cents as someone who has played extensively both solo and in corps, Eve is better with other people. It's a sandbox made for people to get together and go have shenanigans.
---
I can get there if you give me two consecutive days at least!
---
At this rate they will reach stage 5 by the end of the month
---
Why did he get banned?
---
If you don't want to only fly tackle for pvp, use a blaster fit Thorax, with dual rep armor tank + cap injector or buffer shield fit with all dps mods. They are very good and cheap enough to lose all the time.
---
I think you're lost, over at the office the buzz was game changes that players think are for and by them - in reality local got FUBAR when CCP changed it several months ago. (cloud technology is awesome I'm told) Irreversibly fucked because there is no walking back this and nobody is going to code for it to make it function properly in the new environment.
---
You can eat shit and spend money to fix this, have players complain for the rest of time, or introduce new mechanics that work with the new shit state of local and sell it as a feature instead of a bug. CCP has done a great job at selling it so far preying on the disenfranchised goobers and the HTFU motto.
---
What you're discussing is what CCP would have naturally bumped into if the idea was actually about gameplay/health first. First is local got fucked and is not accurate nor has it been. 
---
Red herring. 
---
That being said these are some pretty good ideas and hopefully the game is better with local changes; which would make it great luck that the shit broke. Only time will tell as CCP continues to implement a local that looks like it functions as it should to account for the damaged state it has been in.
---
He was banned because he ran an EVE Casino website, which CCP suspected was involved in RMT.
---
Surely you could make an exception for an N110 or a D845?

The only thing that’s close to the truth in that statement is the fact that it rhymes.
---
I love the WINGSPAN RP. Always entertaining.
---
when hauling you need to not get tackled at all, not rely on stabs to save you
---
which is what I said.
---
No fit will save you from eating a doomsday in the current meta.
---
Drones should not auto-attack NPCs*
---
I can't count the many times I got someone aggressed on a gate against their will because they had their drones out
---
With black out otw the only option is adapted to a standard. I still expect high loss rate for the first two weeks.
---
sorry should have been more clear on who i was directing the comment at.

Falcon is on a vacation till the end of this week. @OP you might want to submit a ticket and/or email security@ccpgames.com re: this :)

Maybe? Depends. There are features like linked channels, priority speaker, auth tokens, etc that discord just doesn’t have. Small groups don’t feel the pain as much, but once you start scaling into like 100+ man groups you probably want most of what it offers

I suppose if you're so rich that you can afford injectors to that level. But beyond certain skill levels and skill grades, injectors become a diminishing return.
---
Yep, working pretty well
---
With no local a cloaky bomber can be sitting next to you in K space.           
---
Instead of getting sig popup on your scanner , you get scramed and cyno next to you.

Because there are gates , you cannot control who is moving in or out all the time.

They'd certainly never do anything like turning it back on with asking.

WH corp that roams nullsec AND wormholes. Get the best out of both worlds without having to be in some garbage nullsec sov bloc with a splurging neckbeard yelling at you and telling you how to play the game.
---
So what's the point of us owning all these expensive capitals if it's not worth undocking because a small gang can lock down your ship faster than you can hit the jump or warp button?
---
Drifters attacking afk cloakies.... Why? If there is no local they don't affect you, if they aren't afk then they are doing things. Why would an afk person who isn't in local be an issue to you?
---
Seems to be some misinformation here. Lxq is the entry system and will be our standing fleet play ground just like bwf was.  We have a different system as our staging.... which is not mentioned here,  so i keep it that way.
---
Lxq has been made our good fight safe place, if a streamer or a alliance comes in wanting a good fight this is where they will get it.
---
 Our new staging is not that, if it moves it dies.
---
No they won't.
---
Brand new account, asking seemingly clueless questions about common stuff. This smells like a troll.
---
If it's not, you should explain what your problem is if you want to get help, or use ccp official channels like submitting a ticket. 
---
To the point of personal stuff in game, you also have responsibility. If you're chatting about personal things in game that you don't want others to see, you're doing it wrong. Get a private encrypted chat like telegram or something.

You really don't know how to do much do you?

Just thinking that. The servers are in London so a SAR would be interesting.

I think I found Eve's dumbest player

Eve is already a very dangerous place in nullsec. Even in Delve, we lose so many ships per night to gankers, even with a full umbrella up. Good luck doing anything pve in a small corp or group on their own...

Some of the most fun I've had in my short period of playing this game was helping E-Uni beat the crap out of PIRAT. Sure, the most recent hostilities (first war after the change) were pretty one-sided in ISK because of the people who got picked off near Jita by multiboxed Lokis or something, but when they actually tried hitting structures, we brought more EWAR than they had ships, took out a few ships worth our entire fleet, then a couple of days later, hit the first timer on their war HQ (expired for us, but someone else finished the job).
---
That's awful, who uses light mode?
---
...and? So?
---
The best part is everyone here can report him for harassing that guy.
---
Not even close. Not. Even. Close.
---
haha yes wait no what
---
Everything is logged indefinitely.
---
It's usable but not that viable.
---
I would suggest waiting until alliances make some fits and suggestions for the new members and just pick one from there.
---

Madness is trying the same thing over and over and hoping for different results

my favorite ship to use against shield missile boats. The slow torturous death for the target.
---
Wrong. Capital-capable connections cannot spawn either inwards or outwards from C1,C2,C3 or C4 connections.
---
Additionally, there's no such thing as a 'wandering k162'. K162 is the outgoing side of any given connection: for any K162 there is an outgoing wormhole sig (C5-C2 is a D364, which is battleship capable but not capital) - and there are no outgoing roaming holes to wormhole space from a C5, only static connections.
---
On top of that, a C5 to null (or vice versa) isn't uncommon, roaming Z142 outgoing connections or N432 incoming connections are reasonably common; it's not unlikely for any given C5 to see one or two a week.
---
You guys would be retarded for banning him instead of milking this cow
---
It was. 😁
---
Just insurance fraud it. There is no possible wormhole connection that offers capital capability to or from a C2.

This is a pretty trivia python script to put together, assuming they have an API to use

He's right. Tackle is an absolute godsend and anyone ballsy enough to run it should be reimbursed in full if the alliance can do it.

What is this? Moa in front if things now?

The client is able to load more into memory. It’s possible to see a performance increase by loading textures and stuff into memory even when they aren’t being used at the moment so that they load faster when they do appear.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realise we had to lie to people now. I missed that memo.

---
Hi  welcome back we are a very friendly group and have a lot of fun. if you are interested 
---
Fed up with large blobs, blue donuts/balls, and New Eden politics? Don’t wanna spend an hour forming for a mandatory CTA that turns out to be another structure timer? Looking for dank frags instead of dank ticks?
---
[Mea Culpa. ](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98592854/)is a fairly young EUTZ lowsec corp formed by a few buddies who enjoy killmails and relaxed comms. We’re small gangers with absolutely no intentions of growing into a big blob or building an empire. We have a couple friends but zero blues and we’ll keep it that way.
---
We’re located at the edge of the southern warzone very close to Geminate, so content is at our doorstep (everybody says that but for us it’s actually true). We fly everything from T1 frigates over T2 battleships to caps. While our killboard looks usually pretty ok, we don’t really care about ISK efficiency or other metrics of eliteness. So if you want to roam your 4b Marauder, that’s more than fine. If you can and want to fly blops that’s also very welcome, especially if can contribute a hunter, too.
---
We recently started a [Channel on Youtube, so you can check out dank image videos there. 2](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGd2xMWM3mjQVGPK4mBbaRQ)
---
What can we offer?
---
1. Explosions.
---
2. A group that you can call friends and that’s small enough to recognize people on comms by voice.
---
3. More explosions.
---
4. Citadels with clone bays.
---
5. Some moons for ISK printing.
---
6. Access to a L5 agent and guidance how to utilize that for more ISK printing.
---
What should you bring?
---
1. A good and somewhat mature attitude. This is by far the most important. Eve is a game and should be fun.
---
2. A strong desire to blow up (player-owned and operated) stuff. This is not a PVE corp.
---
3. Ability to create your own content. We’re a small group and can’t provide free killmails around the clock.
---
4. A good level of skill points. No hard requirement, but we sometimes like to fly fancy stuff.
---
5. A second account with useful toons (dread, scout, covert cyno) is not required but a big plus.
---
If all that sounds interesting, come by our [discord](https://discord.gg/YGE9FHV) or join our public channel in game: Mea Culpa.

How much is fully fitted nyx these days?
---
Welcome to the world of solo playing! This is not for the faint-hearted and most of the people prefer to bunch up together because it is easier. Right now I'm playing as 15M alpha character just for the challenge, to find out how hard it is to live and have fun in Eve solo.
---
As respectable \[TheRaydo\](/u/TheRaydo) stated before, there are some ways to make isk. As of my experience:
---
* data/relic exploration in C1..C3 or nulls - you have to use an expensive analyzer in a wormhole, otherwise the most juicy containers got blown up;
---
* abyssal sites - used to run frigate T1 solo, was decent isk (9-10kk from a site), don't know how profitable it is now;
---
* incursions - did it a lot, ended up with a couple of faction-fitted battleships. As the Sansha spawns are rare now, look at Triglavian invasions. Chat channel is named "Triglav Defense" without quotes;
---
What no one did mention so far, is a wormhole combat exploration: my alpha is able to do C2 sites in dualrep haml gnosis, and slowly advances to a C3 rattlesnake, which in theory can fly, although less efficiently than main omega character.
---
And many corps could ask you to be self-sufficient with isk, so keep that in mind.
---
y not?
---
Not everyone can make it alone, some people want to play a different kind of game to you. We are offering those players an equal partnership where we help each other in our mutual pursuit of stupid amounts of money.
---
I think I found EVE smartest player. :)
---
That's only because you can't drop your super umbrella in staging
---
I read Moa and thought, "what bug did we get this time?" and then I saw this is r/eve, not r/Warframe .
---
what OP left out: 
---
he was apparently the first one to spam /u/lord-supreme with replies if you check https://www.reddit.com/user/globbyrebornASS/overview
---
so the spam here is just a response to that
---
It would really be fun to remove anomalies and replace them with NPCs bashing your structures.

---
you will need buffer, if you dont want to loose some efficiency.  
---
P0 from extracor -&gt; storage  (dont need a direct link, you can go via facility)  
---
P0 from storage -&gt; P1 plant
---
P1 from plant -&gt; launch pad (used as buffer)  
---
P1 from launch pad -&gt; P2 plant
---
P2 from plant -&gt; launch pad
---
alternatively, you can skip the first storage and use the lauch pad instead. but it's not recommended for long cycle when the buffer matter.  
---
with medium skills, you should be able to build 2 extractors with 3-4 heads, 2 storages, 4 P1 plants (2 of each kind), one P2 plant and one launch pad.  
---
it's look like this http://i.imgur.com/iufb8jb.png

P0 to P2 is a realy standard setup, you can find some tutorials about it

you have to pay 2x if you want our sweet space

Dark themes can put more strain on your eyes in high-light conditions, since it washes out the text. 100% contrast (white text on a black background) is typically harder to read and may cause more eye strain

---
Honestly, I joined TEST after messing around in High-sec and quitting/rejoining like 4 times. That was over 6 years ago and I still play games with a lot of the people I've met in TEST, many of whom play in all different alliances. 
---
What I like about being in TEST - There are opportunities to kind of try a bunch of different playstyles to see what you like. You can also join smaller special interest groups/corps that have their own sub-communities. We also have our own training programs that give out free ships for you to welp as you work out coming back to EVE.

---
Well this is only good if it's an AFK camper.  One that is active and still can dscan is going to be worse. Simply because you wont know its there, it will be a bigger problem when people start complaining of being ganked and not even seeing it coming at all.
---
Perhaps restricting dscan whilst cloaked helps but again if you're an active camper you can just warp to each belt and anoms so this is going to massively favour them.  There is going to be huge tears and the  people stop ratting and mining and undocking. Then killing the whole market etc..
---
Remove local then remove the ability to cloak indefinitely.  either find cloakers  a bit like star trek where they leave a exhaust trail you can scan down somehow or make cloaks use lots of cap so they eventually  decloak and cant reactivate for 5 minutes or more.
---
Would you like some cheese?
---
I've heard Ubuntu is dropping 32 bit support overall.
---
Steam is backing from supporting them because of this.
---
So yeah, CCP should do something if they care about this part of the market.
---
Keep the drifters here, let it all burn.
---
Oh no, what do I do?
---
If this isn't weaponized autism, I don't know what is.

In the plus side it's a pretty good time to build a new pc

They backed off on that.

I think I found r/EVE's dumbest thread

Some high class WH corp have high requirement (like have a scanning/saber alt, ability to fly T3c, knowledge about WH...).

where low class WH are smaller and less organized but also more newbros friendly

---
TBH if I ever unironically wanted to be a renter I think I'd just biomass IRL.
---
How do you roll abyss items?
---
Yeah. That's generally understandable since there tends to be a lot more competition over higher-class wormholes and so it's easier for a corp to get by if most of its members can fly high-level stuff. Lower-class space is generally overlooked or passed through and so corps there can get away with lower requirements.
---
Welcome back :)
---
Get ready for complete chaos muhahaha
---
the nyx and archon just need updated graphics the design themselves are fantastic now the aeon is a different mater.......
---
So I would divide EVE into seven major types of groups
---
* Hisec Industrialists - the classic so-called 'carebears', not generally interested in legitimate ship-based PVP but responsible for spinning the gears of industry that build the parts for everyone else. Praise be to their patron saint Steve Ronuken; but unfortunately he's literally the only hisec industrialist that gets any respect. (Okay, PushX and Red Frog Freight still have good reputations, but they're specifically heavy freight haulers.)
---
* Hisec Wardeccers / Gankers - PIRAT and CODE. They camp the trade hubs and major trade lanes and arbitrarily headshot people because why not. Nobody likes them and they bask in the glory of having nobody like them.
---
* Lowsec Manly Men - They just fight people. They fight all the people. I don't know what the hell they do other than fight people, they just fight people. They've got a reputation for including higher skill solo players, but then every high skill solo player needs a group of lower skill players to meme on and look cool while doing it. This category also includes groups like Darwinism. Unfortunately, Snuffed Out like dropping dreadnoughts on these sorts of guys, which takes the wind out of their urges to fight all the people.
---
* Nullsec Empires - Pandemic Horde/Legion, TEST Alliance Please Ignore, Goonswarm Federation, Fraternity. The largest of the large groups, thousands upon thousands of players. The biggest and richest of the big are Goonswarm, and they have been for some time. They don't hold the largest region of territory, but they have a lot of financial power and fortification in that territory. Combat anomaly massacre, moon mining, and the galaxy's largest fleet of Titans to back it all up. And while they do engage in fleet combat from time to time, the fleets are generally extremely large I don't deal with nullsec literally ever though, so as far as I'm concerned all of the major null empires basically follow the same description but with fewer superlatives.
---
* Renters - Rate My Ticks, Brothers of Tangra, Pan-Intergalactic Business Community, probably some others - Less powerful nullsec groups which occupy most of the territory of the empires. Kinda like feudalism really. The empires control major swathes of space, the renters farm the combat anomalies in that territory for their own income for whatever purposes. Lower pressure than being part of an empire, but still with some vestiges of their protection. Unfortunately, the reputation of these groups has taken a beating from (not unfounded) accusations of their containing large numbers of illicit bot-run accounts.
---
* Low-class Wormhole groups - Wormholers living in Class 1 - Class 4 wormhole systems. There's a bunch of these groups. Many of them are fairly accepting to newer players, and JSpace as a whole is a different gameplay experience from the rest of EVE. Maps are fleeting and logistics are more... 'interesting'.
---
* High-class Wormhole groups - Wormholers living in either Class 5, or C2-Null/5 \[Class 2 system, with connections to Class 5 and Nullsec\] wormhole systems. LAZERHAWKS, NOVAC, Kronos Ritual, Inner Hell. Better organized, much richer, much more aggressive, but also generally higher acceptance standards than the lower-class wormhole groups. Some of these guys talk a lot of trash about the lower class groups. (Note: Yes, JSpace goes up to Class 6, however there are no major groups which permanently live in C6 holes.)
---
Given that what you're looking for in a corp is active PVP, I'd recommend either a lowsec Faction Warfare group (Galmilistan? I think that's a group?) or a Wormholer^(btw) group of some kind.
---
in 2008 you would have been 1337 ... don't worry, I have 3 only too
---
That doesn't matter. Your account probably has your real name on it if you didn't lie when creating it. CCP knows the account for each character and the real name of each account holder.
---
That makes any chat message personal information as far as GDPR is concerned.
---
It would be different if the character names were actually anonymous or the names in the logs were anonymized in a way that they couldn't be linked to an account.
---
But if it worked like you said that would be a massive legal loophole. Companys could just say "we're not actually saving and data about you we're just saving data about this anonymous numerical user ID. By the way we also know the real name of every numerical user ID."
---
really like design c though really they all look pretty nice
---
Any thing is possible best way is to kill it and salvage it then rebuild it in highsec
---
depends. tech 2 nyx is like 13-14B. But typical super carriers should still cost about 15B-20B because of the bling. But Darwinism again
---
If you need someone to talk to, let me know brother.

---
lol, I assume you don't even use a vni?
---
Oh. Good move.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
No we used to bring them out with guardians for small gang but the nerfs to the drones hurt it too much to use in pvp
---
Pretty sure the guy was interested in PVE aspects of it...

You get similar spam if a corp leaves your alliance and you're involved in a bunch of wars:  [https://i.redd.it/8i34xg023s431.png](https://i.redd.it/8i34xg023s431.png)
---
These changes plus making them cheaper would add a lot to the game, really. This is a mechanic with the potential to be really interesting, providing good potential for play and counterplay.
---
I figure it effected pve in the same way and you’d get lower ticks as a result
---
PVE was barely affected by the previous nerf.
---
as long as you can't anchor them within range of tether or forcefields
---
Yes,showing my 100% supporting agreement with his statement instead of starting a new thread saying the exact same thing.
---
Yeah, crap space in Tribute is perfect for you plebs.
---
I like shooting rats in my super while shooting rocks in my rorquals. It would be a shame if I ran out of rats and/or rocks.
---
Rgr I haven’t used it for pve for a long time now
---
They already come with some minimum anchor distances.
---
&gt; May not be deployed within 100km of another Mobile Scan Inhibitor, within 75km of Stargates, Wormholes, Stations or Upwell Structures, or within 40km of a Starbase. Cannot be retrieved once deployed. Self-destructs after one hour of operation.
---
Keeping in mind that the AoE is only 30km, it can't be used to completely hide things away.
---
It's simply better to remove auto aggro no need for new things to keep it.
---
If botter want to continue to bot they will have do a lot more input which is easier for ccp to detect.
---
Neuf bg a drone boat will just push the problem in the next drone boat, dominix will replace vni because they will be effective and insurance in great
---
The shadow is the goon titan fleet's shadow after hearing a cruiser was roaming in delve

Aye, but do pretend it's absolutely real and other narrative is total shit and shove it all down over here on Reddit.
---
And npcs should defang.
---
Idek if i am using the 64-bit. I clicked it on and havent noticed anything different.
---
Keep pandering them with content on undock.
---
This sounds like a great change/idea.
---
So many bugs at the moment, when I was playing last night I found 4 new bugs..
---
For some reason lutris solution didn't work out for me on Fedora 30.
---
Installer that you linked uses older launcher version, and after install it just displays tray icon and nothing happens. I tried changing installer script for newer version of the launcher, and it just crashes with memory read access violation.
---
Only unofficial native launcher works, but afaik it does not have dxvk pre-integrated, and while dx11 client version works, the performance is abysmal (turning camera towards sun and anomaly overlay instantly cuts fps in half).
---
The sense of stale gameplay is all in your head because you prefer to reddit post rather than play EVE. All this change would do is make a small minority of nullsec dwellers only login at certain times to avoid having to move around.
---
We'll everyone has to make somehow.
---
Don’t have normal humans play the game. They all like to have fun and that just varies.
---
I'd recommend an exploration alt. It's the most profitable alpha friendly profession and it's perfect to make an alt for it so you can focus your other character towards something else. 
---
If you're skilling into mining on your "main" I'd recommend you create an alt for some combat too. You could use your exploration alt for this since the exploration skills will be done in a week (if you stay as alpha).
---
As for the types you were talking about. All of the things you mentioned are based on nullsec meta and most of them are not as good/viable unless you join a nullsec corp. Rorqual is more or less the "endgame" in the mining path. PI is a side thing that will take you roughly 3 weeks to skill into and will work as a more or less passive income (it's not all that good in highsec and you need Omega for it). VNI used to be a cheap ratting ship a lot of people used as a way to make decent money in nullsec but it's about to get nerfed in that aspect. replacing the VNI will most likely be the Myrmidon (or some other drone-focused ship).
---
Actually while reading this, I had another idea:
---
Why not add the ability to block dscan as a module only available to blackops?
---
Like the Bastion Module with a 1 minute timer that stops you from moving.
---
Change the dscan to something more generic like "Scan Inhibitation field", so you don't know if it is a structure or ship you (don't) see.
---
There are other modules that have the same effect as deployables (like the micro jump) and it would give blackops another tool
---
Do you know when they started working on this ? IIRC the first ship to go through this wave of redesigns was the scorpion, **in 2010. 9 and a half years ago.**
---
And the ship models are not particularly detailed so there's really no reason why it should take this long.
---
not really lol, if at all both are equally bad
---
they already do
---
Would be cool, but would also be mad spooky to be stuck in place for 1 minute. That's a LONG time, and any competent scanner will probe you down long before that minute is up and warp in on you.
---
Painting all chinese players with the same wide botting brush is racist
---
yeah and make them anchor keepstars daily with their unlimited funding
---
lmao link your killmail you fucking retard
---
Great place ! Just be careful of the bee invasion happening every 6 month and when it happen don't expect anyone to face them they will leave alone while they suck all your honey
---
Nothing planned for those right now
---
Well, you would ofc have friends hiding in your field, so you have a bit safety in numbers (solo you could just fit a cloak after all)
---
who is "them"?
---
Better than not telling you.
---
"play and counterplay", for a small subset of players, yes.  The real counterplay for anyone engaged in PvE will be not to undock.
---
Fak your clown  wars. Or even better. Learn to adapt.
---
Is this bait?
---
Nobody believes you've ever PVPed in your life.  Get the fuck out of here.

"I just need to get some fleets and time in I think to really get going in the game and start to figure stuff out."
---
Until you get a solid grasp of the game, I advise you to try EVE Uni: other starter groups are politically aligned and sometimes you burn bridges without knowing what you are doing. E-UNI is neutral, geared towards teaching and organizing activities centered around new players. They have campuses in all Hi/low/Null/Wh space so you can move around and see what you really like doing. They have mining fleets, PvE fleets, PvP fleets, solo pvp events inside the corp. You can stay as long as you like, or "graduate" and join another corp without hard feelings, as no one is surprised if students leave after they learn the basics of the game.
---
i am not pvper, i'm just the guy in the hic that just holds someone while others do the beating.
---
No shit.. what has that got to with what I asked?
---
First of all, avoid in general the militia that is on top.
---
Caldari/Amarr are mostly farmers now, so go for minnie/gallente if you want to fight.
---
Alternatively, you can farm like crazy in amarr atm if you can fly a stealth bomber or stratios .... 700m isk / h or more.
---
Eventually they will lose their tier, and end up on the back foot. :P
---
You must not remember the horrible rubberbanding, desync, and lag on top of the client crashes before TiDi was implemented? 
---
As shitty as it is playing in 10% slugfests, at least you still get to play.
---
It does if you are using a [Moa Guristas SKIN (Permanent)](https://www.evemarkethelper.net/Market/40772-moa-guristas-skin-permanent)
---
Finished watching that the other day for the 100th time. Why did they have to end it :(
---
Oh ok, didnt knw about it !
---
60 active players with 200 members?
---
Assuming that at least a few are inactives, that's like 3 characters per player on average. What kind of wormhole corp are you in?
---
You see if they are doing what you paid them to do if activity in the systems drops and/or ratting/mining ship die.
---
When you ask for changes ask yourself first: would you personally go and live there if this was implemented? 
---
Just imagine: cannot have any group- you will overfarm the area. Cannot have a base because you need to move pretty often and moving base would be a nightmare. So basically solo live in null-sec. 
---
On the other hand: hunters. Currently they have good intel on where to go for prey. With your idea implemented they would not have this intel and would need to blindly go and search everywhere.
---
So at the end who is beneficiary of this change?
---
[DATA EXPUNGED]
---
Oh no they might have to dscan every now and then to keep a eye on their targets why would anyone still employ them if they still get them kills
---
Personally I would recommend against provibloc. They have a cool concept, but anyone I've met ingame who "grew up" in provibloc had a weird mentality about PVP and losses.
---
It might be just my limited sample size, but from what I've seen provi players take the game too seriously while also not being great at it, which is the worst combination.
---
That's haram C5-C5 is halal tho
---
It's not an amazing tool anyway, the mobile scan inhibitor don't hide itself.  
---
Some people used a bit in wh but when you see it on dscan, it's like screaming in local "hey guys ! I'm hidding something right there !"
---
Right clic the mutaplasmid and drag an item it accepts into the slot.
---
This is a pretty narrow line of thinking. The benefit of the scan inhib for PvE players is that people can't see anything in range of the inhib on d-scan, only the inhib itself. Which lends to some interesting strategies for buying time if gankers show up.
---
Sorry, I didn’t get it. Why it is noteworthy? What is the story?
---
don't go for certain member counts, compare members in the corp to active PvP characters on zkill
---
Just beast you have an N770 incoming or N062 outgoing to C5 space doesn't mean that hole will transmit a capital. Those holes don't transmit caps.
---
I didn't either, and tbh its a pretty sick skin i might pick one up.
---
True. But if it were cheaper, say 3Mn instead of 30Mn, it could be used in greater numbers for some interesting purposes. For example, you might know that the people in a wormhole are trying to hide a mining op but with multiple inhibs on scan you can't know where that op is without probing, nor what is on field. Hell, it could even be used to set some traps.
---
This could be just a bit more effective if inhibs affected probe scanners as well. Say, ships and such remain scannable but their precise identity is hidden if they're in range of an inhib. So an Archon next to an inhib will show up as a scannable "???" signature to combat scanners.
---
Wormhole space is best space. Forced Content is recruiting if you have PvP experience and are willing to live in a C4 with 3/5 static’s.
---
Yeah, this is why I'm suggesting the change to make it (1) smaller and easier to carry multiple and (2) increasing the duration of each so that it's more versatile as you would be able to anchor several of these around a system to either force the targets to probe down each one and get on grid with it.
---
You can even anchor a Small Mobile Warp Disruptor next to it so that anyone trying to probe it down (and even if they warp to it at 100km) would be dragged into the bubble for you to snag and kill.
---
As far as I know you can still fit a cyno and have an active defense fleet. If you stop "playing" (if isk making can be considered playing) because there is risk in Eve Online, what the fuck are you doing here.
---
That's the whole point of removing local. It adds more risk. Fleet up so you can fight back against hot drops or accept losses.
---
goons r bad
---
And yet people will warp to it find out it is in a small bubble with smartbombing rohks.
---
In null sec it is great when mining station sanctums. You get a heads up somebody is going to visit due to the combat probes. Which is pretty rare these days, and even more rare is somebody picking up the mining fleet on d-scan when it is off the path from gates and out of range from the sun.
---
Look at all those pilots in WH that are docked all the time.
---
I have people in my mining corp that actually enjoy solo-diving into scattered and non-scattered wormholes (solo meaning  they do not have any eyes on the hole, so their only warning is dscan)
---
* Do they die sometimes? Yes.
---
* Are the people killing them scum that would probably avoid a ship that can fight them on even terms? Maybe.
---
* Am I worried that they might stop undocking? Not at all.
---
Almost noob question, what do you use the Moa for ? Used his cousin Gila a lot , but never tried out the Moa
---
Hi! Computer science graduate and professional software engineer here.
---
There's really only so much CCP can do about this. While it _is_ unfortunate that they didn't make an effort fifteen odd years ago to write a scaleable, fully multithreaded server, the grim reality is that:
---
1. Nobody really knew that simultaneous, multicore processing and even splitting a process across multiple machines would be the only feasible way to scale processing power after about 2013;
---
2. Adapting an existing codebase for multithreading is actually difficult -- and given EVE isn't exactly a nice mathematical or graph problem, that "difficult" is actually "effectively impossible";
---
3. Getting _Python_ to work with multicore processing is particularly difficult, yet the choice of Python as a programming language is pretty key to there being an EVE at all; and
---
4. Most players know this, which is why you kind of look like a dunce for whinging about it.
---
Current state massively favours krabs/big alliances, how many times have you complained about that?
---
It's not narrow at all.  It's based on the standard PvE equation of effort v reward, especially as we're talking about doing something mindbogglingly dull that nobody with frontal lobes could possibly do unless they're able to zone out for hours at a time.
---
If you want people to actually concentrate and be engaged, I'm afraid you're going to have to scrap the current system entirely and replace it with something completely new.  
---
Until then what you're suggesting and what CCP's blackout will do is simply force a lot of characters out of the game.  Whether that's good or bad I neither know nor really care.  But if you think there's going to be a game of cat and mouse over the reward of a forsaken hub or a blob of spod, I'm afraid you're going to be sadly disillusioned.
---
Now where's your spirit of adventure?
---
Your Corp mates can now legally shoot you
---
Deploy Scan inhib -&gt; Deploy cyno inhib on top of it.
---
A bold move, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off.
---
WH are not quite same as Nullsec my friend.  I agree your points but getting around nullsec is far easier and far quicker and far more accessible.  There is also zero Intel for WHs so its pot luck that someone accidentally coming across your hole. 
---
If you want it like WH then CCP should also remove the Intel from Nullsec.  Only then can you compare like for like.  Then yes absolutely
---
EVE is hard game? Not what I don't pay for, unsub!
---
Scattered? Shattered, maybe?
---
The drifters are a terribly implemented mechanic, just get on and implement the local removal so we can go back to player generated content instead of playing Drifter Roulette to even move around.
---
If they want station attacking pressure you can have them do that without having all the unavoidable insta-death garbage thrown in on top.
---
Not everyone spend 24/7 ratting or doesn't have a decent jump bridge plus you can also use WH to travel all around eve from nullsec..
---
(hide my gquit from nullsec to wh space a few month ago) :D
---
I'm gonna build half a dozen of them and whelp them into lowsec/nullsec during the blackout.
---
Can you be more specific about what your plan is to prevent everything going to asset safety when horde, goons and test come to blow that up?
---
That reference :D
---
oops, yes :)
---
dont fly garmurs.
---
RR is filled with botters.
---
Not all ships show up on dscan.
---
That’s why I live in a hole, never know where we are connected to or who’s around.
---
if you havent seen your PP in two years then i would recommend a diet 8 )

Send a mail to the CEO of `Pickle's Locator Agent Alt-Corp`, with the character names of each of your campers. ;D

I went for ratting with a gila..you think it was a bad move? Also , with skilling for the gila i could use that alt for pvp and pve correct?  Thanks for the info
---
I can build all that shit for myself, don't need no null monkeys to grind spod when I can crack four moons a day in my wormhole.
---
Just in case this is serious post: isn’t this what nullseccers were predicted from the start?
---
Will do as soon as you send the isk, can't be giving out free Intel on the alts names for the deal is confirmed. ]; D
---
Some wounds will never heal. :(
---
Oh boy, all the tears "grrr nullblocks" and now everyone that wanted this changes are shitting their pants
---
Sigh. Where is ma ferox.
---
Plex and injector traders OP is asking to come to this citadel care.
---
Thx for defending the common citizens against the tapi tyranny
---
Having done corp infiltrations as a primary playstyle in all zones of space, I can confirm that about 10% of a corp's member list being active players is an expected average anywhere, including wormholes. Some corps provide engaging enough content to exceed this average, others are in the process of dying, or haven't purged inactives for years, and may only have 5% or less. 
---
If your corp is beating these numbers then congrats, but it isn't like a special thing with wormholes. Its probably just because you have a well managed corporation.
---
Sooooooo.... if I got this right your with a corpse, and your going to get off for the night.... whew.... no thanks I like my corpses fresh...
---
And friendly fire is always on!
---
*pushes up glasses
---
Well TECHNICALLY any body being orbited is also orbiting that body, even if the barycenter of the orbit is very very very close to the center of the larger body
---
Do you think their targets are dscan immune ships?
---
it would barely take any time at all to warp around the system and dscan
---
Well we intend to defend the structure of course, hence why we are asking for help ;)
---
We have the support of some null blocs already, so it will be interesting.
---
If you were really interested in sticking it to nullsec alliances wouldn't you go with 0.0% or are you just trying to pocket some easy isk?
---
You're very welcome!
---
Grab ur pitchforks and come help us!
---
The tax covers the cost of structure, and will be used to purchase all the ships I intend to distribute for free groups comming to help.
---
So no pocketing
---
&gt;So people are saying that removing local removes the AFK cloaking camping issue.
---
Yes, I believe it does.
---
&gt;Well this is only good if it's an AFK camper.
---
Of course, by definition. *It's AFK*. [It's a vacuous truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth).
---
&gt;One  that is active and still can dscan is going to be worse. Simply because  you wont know its there, it will be a bigger much bigger problem when  people start complaining of being ganked and not even seeing it coming  at all.
---
One that is active is not AFK, and by the title of your own thread, irrelevant to the discussion.
---
Same people that drop money for plex years ago. Thibk the plex price climb was 2015. 2016 was where everyone bitched about it being a bil. When plex was 350, vindicators were 1.3Bil and bhall was 1 bil. Thats 3 plex just for the hull. People paid and plex traded.
---
ugh i forgot you're slimy ass would be involved of course its 0.2% tax. Go loot some more sotiyo's
---
Yeah this is all about defending the common citizen and has nothing to do with trying to take a piece of the pie for themselves
---
It's noteworthy in that it's the first citadel put up by a bot
---
Horde lost its balls to keep attacking that ks so...
---
Well yes, but being honest it was first time i had time to actually play.             
---
Like there was nothing in null as people just logged out due to drifters.             
---
It is quite annoying tbh.
---
You're a linux guy, but you use ubuntu?!? wut
---
so what you want to say that people can use this name now?
---
This is still less greedy and stupid than Vily's empty promises no matter what.
---
Also potential content.
---
i'm wondering about the isk/h of this scam
---
It’s that way to keep alliances from owning a shit ton of space. The new sov mechanic was suppose to stop mega alliances become better for smaller alliances. Well, it didn’t work. This is because CCP didn’t calculate skill injectors and rorq with the cap changes. :facepalm:
---
TAPI is paying Horde for not attacking the Keepstar. Basically we make a profit of their effort
---
Well played, haha.
---
Frig jumps in, anchors Scan Inhib at gate, warps out.
---
Fleet jumps in, cant be d-scaned, kills everyone in belt.
---
I will pay you 1 (one) .5 (point five) million isk for this curiosity.
---
Good day.
---
Doomed? I think you mean blessed. Praise Bob!
---
I think it is in our common interest for the health of the game to make sure everyone gets a piece of the pie and also make sure there is enough pie for everyone.
---
It's like Skynet the bots have become self aware and will now exterminate any of the human remnants of GOTG.
---
Show me on the spaceship where the bad Chori touched you
---
I feel if you wanted to be successful you should have shown a little Opsec and not posted on here. Contacted diplos from non-blues and seen what kind of numbers you could have pulled.
---
&gt; This is not for the faint-hearted
---
Unless you keep to highsec like every soloer should
---
Sad as fuck tbh lol.
---
Wait guys I got this
---
    L omegalul R E
---
You know they are all SP farmed alts right, no one actually, manually, watches them.
---
Corpmates get tipped in my corp for putting alts on holes during ops though, because we’re cool like that.
---
You sound like commie thrash to me
---
That I can agree too. Valid statements gets valid upvote.
---
Google retains all search queries and in their wording they also say that it's anonymized and not traceable but in reality it is able to be deanonymized indefinitely. 
---
That legalese doesn't answer the question clearly and precisely at all. It's vague and non specific.
---
It's not made clear what is regarded as personal information they don't talk about text written by users within in game chat nor audio used via in game chat.
---
In EU law and in the spirit of EU law the answer to the question should be made available clearly prior to anybody using the service. This is true of any type of information like this.
---
10 000 000 isk in-game
---
We'll see.  I imagine game mechanics thatreduce the MER numbers considerably may increase sales.  If that's what's going on here I'm afraid I'm out, unless there's a quite big reduction in price.
---
So you are trying to doxx yourself?
---
I think you are misreading some key points like afk. Also look at delve, there are lots of systems with afk cloaky campers and very few of them ever get used for killing anything.
---
Or you could bring more in a hauler alt and not be cheap.
---
They nerfed anomalies because null was simply making too much, they nerfed the rorqual because null was making too much.  
---
I think adding loot to drifters would be a bad idea, they are there to harass not fill you pockets in lieu of the nerfs. If you want drifters with loot come to WH space.
---
~brain dead~
---
LOL because local wasthe big difference xD
---
Time to open the ferox cache
---
Aha! Well I would totally be watching every one of my  
---
  
---
AFK   
---
cloaky alts at all times! So my deal is even better than all the others!
---
No, doxxing himself is just a bonus. He’s trying to get banned for abusing support requests for the name change.
---
T1 subcaps were cheap along with t2 frigs. Hacs were the same price and everything else cost an arm and a leg. Only a very few could afford capitals.
---
Eve will gain more than they lost if they made it more like 2012 (without implementing the cancer back, like old t3 crusiers) and removed skill injectors. Game was nevertheless suppose to be farm field 9000.
---
Your thinking of goons. Hate on test is just banta, they have gave me some of the best fights this year.
---
I can not hate a enemy that undocks and actually fights.
---
I have a :dagger: for tapi
---
It also has no permanent gates, no cynos and fleet size restriction. Just saying ;)
---
&gt;It's not made clear what is regarded as personal information
---
It's made really fucking clear if you just click the link dude. Literally half the page is dedicated to explaining it.
---
100% superior to npc stations. Lower fees as well as tethering, which makes docking and undocking safe
---
Yes and also no cyno to save yourself, generally no direct link to your own home where help could be and anyone could roll into you at anytime. Also you're most likely in a dread so in siege. And also NPC point.
---
space is not a void/vacuum
---
So the ones in Delve that are there from right after downtime until next downtime and don't cause any ship kills or activity drops? Very few of them are ever used to do anything, they just sit there and get ignored.
---
Industry index was at 0 in most systems from goon deployment, within 48 hours of coming home they were maxed out again, while cloaky campers in system.
---
Damn I stop checking in on Eve for a few months and this shit goes down.
---
There like 3 trade azbels in 1j from jita atm, and those are just i noticed yesterday.       
---
I think no one cares about those any more.
---
Now a lot of players are noticing the fabulous, amazing and funny that WH is actually.
---
Preety much my reaction.
---
I don’t know what you are trying to say, and I don’t think you do either.
---
10 000 000.01 isk ingame
---
Do you know how local works in wormholes? We've been on this hype train for a looooongggg time
---
Sounds like these are eyes and not campers.
---
Ignore this guy. There’s prime real estate for sale in The Spire - just contact any member of Droneland Prosperity Initiative alliance for more details.
---
Easy, become Omega
---
Damn, you beat me to it.
---
Rats apply the old saying from Mother Russia - quantity has a quality all of its own.
---
Free intel is not a big difference? Really?
---
It is a small difference compared to the other differences.
---
In my opinion  the setup they provide is great, keepstar on the gate, research and production  all setup for insta warp to all structures and jita gate, as someone who uses those three installations daily and not affiliated to any of the benefactors I think they are providing value for money. Traders want stability, not worth jumping to a rival citadel unless you have a short term goal, ie buy 10k plex for your sp farm or something.....
---
Also if your planning to remove their structures what plan do you have should you achieve your goal to ensure we can continue to have the same setup, real traders want stability.
---
Fuck yeah, create some chaos. Will be creating an alpha when I get home.
---
No, it is going to die. That is for certain.
---
He can form about 3 other people.
---
So dinos had to walk back a fraction of a % of taxation in their trading keepstar and a bunch of fat pussies are pearl clutching - despite never laying assets on the line to defend the tower or be owed anything.
---
Imagine feeling someone in Eve Online lied
---
Thread delivers goofiness in spades.
---
I'm implying 90% of 32bit users will be botters.
---
Get out of here with your need for this type of content! CCP has already granted you nonstop pve content with no rewards. Their content is its own reward.
---
oh man you should really join volta and become their head diplo mate.
---
No they don't, they ignore my drones...
---
the machonet folder contains statistic market data on anything you ever clicked on in the market. you can delete it and it might speed up your market window response times.
---
i regularly do it on all accounts that run the 1015 maximum market orders.
---
Sometimes they do, sometimes they attack drones. If you stay here long enough or read the EVE-O forums, you'll see a post about once a week about "WTF MAH DRONES ARE BEING ATTACKED BY THE RATS WAT DO" with the common advice of ejecting and re-entering the spaceship.
---
We're always here to help you guys close the blue donut by making TAPI and Phorde cooperate.
---
Yea, good luck being successful with getting everyone to swap marketplaces, without telling anyone about your marketplace.  It should be astoundingly obvious that to be successful here requires being super public. It's a market hub, not a supercap assembly (not that those are at any real risk these days mind you, with the nullblock leaders all being buddies
---
Better a pvp alliance gets some of that proverbial pie than the carebear alliance surely?
---
instead of just saying “wormholes” or “nullsec”, lets have a look at the benefits and weaknesses of each space:
---
Wormholes:
---
C2-NS/C5s: this is one of the best places to live if you like NS roaming and smallgang, these groups often have fairly high SP requirements, but it’s not always the case and it doesn’t hurt to ask around. Notable groups in this kind of space are The Tuskers, Kronos Ritual and Foxholers.
---
C4 space: This is the more relaxed version of WH space, most groups have a C5 static for access to WH Krabbing and either a C3 (easier krabbing + K space statics) or C4 (PvP) statics. Generally doctrines in these groups are cheaper (500mil - 1bil) and caps are strictly monitored since you can’t bring them in if you want to siege the system. Some groups in this space are Wormholes Society (WHSOC), Epicentre Syndicate (EPSYN) and Hidden Baguette (BAG8, French Corp), though there are several others.
---
C5 Space: C5 space is the high stakes version of WHs, doctrines can be 2-3B or more with implant sets, caps are used more liberally in fights (and can be insanely expensive, Hawks lost a Ninazu a month or 2 ago that was over 15Billion ISK). There’s access to lots of PvP and often Nullsec if you want to roam as well, ISK is sometimes made via BS groups in C5 sites but is usually done by dread ratting, either in a static connection or with a dedicated farmhole. Some notable C5 groups are Hard Knocks, Lazerhawks, Ehefkae (AFK), MCAV (Mouth Trumpet Cavalry) and NOVAC (No Vacancies).
---
C5 groups often require you have alts that can fly scanning ships, Sabres, DSTs and/or booshers.
---
Nullsec: 
---
Big bloc: Big groups such as TEST, Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde/Legion, Northen Coalition, Fraternity or Guardians of the Galaxy (Darkness and friends) tend to have many players and allow you to be relatively safe when ratting in capitals (fit a cyno and live under the cap umbrella), they tend to have large fleet fights which can be a bit boring at times (lock this character up, press F1, repeat), but you can still use them as staging points for smallgang.
---
Small groups: Smaller groups tend to fall into a few different catagories: Renters, who pay a fee to a big bloc for safety, ProviBloc, who are a bunch of small-medium sized alliances that exist because they haven’t pissed off Goons yet and pets who are like renters, but instead of paying a fee, they help with coalition ops by providing warm bodies. These groups tend to have less safe capital ratting (ProviBloc) or are just worse versions of big Blocs (Pets/Renters) though there are, of course, exceptions to that rule.
---
If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask, I’m somewhat more versed in WH space than NS, but I have lived in both spaces.
---
Cause they do stupid high tax so nobody wants to use them :P
---
Think before you post.
---
Lol, I am getting off the game for the nice but seeing all these comments it too funny to not reply.
---
Can totally see how it seems like a scam the problem is of I prove it someone can take the name then it's not worth anything so idk how to go about it.
---
You guys do know that this isn't the first RR Keepstar right? It's like the third at least.
---
What do you mean? And I don't really care if someone knows my name I just don't want everyone on the game to know my name.
---
C2 space is lowclass, you can certainly classify them separately from C4 groups, but limping them in with C5 groups doesn’t make sense.
---
It's spelled Liar
---
No, I changed my name so not everyone could see it. I don't mind one person seeing it and making isk.
---
Yes, so idk how to go about this without someone taking it.
---
What about you talk?
---
They blow up as the war decs take hold.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77708835/
---
Like so from today.
---
If you remember Aurum, the premium currency they used for cosmetics, they merged PLEX and Aurum together. If you had 1 PLEX in your account, it got converted to 500 nuPLEX. Aurum got a similar conversion.
---
Everything else stayed the same, 20$ gives you 500 PLEX, which gives 1 month of sub (vs what it used to be 20$ for 1 PLEX for 1 month). Cosmetic prices in $ stayed relatively the same.
---
&gt;Sigh. 
---
Why sigh? You don't expect a fight?
---
How profitable is high sec exploration?
---
I have the impression that it is not very much, correct? Something like 10-20mil isk/hr
---
So do I assume correctly that explores are actually exploring in wormholes and Low sec (passing by wormholes?)
---
Maybe they want to bait a fight.
---
Farming Electrical V on 400kk Gila w/o Crystal. Very cost effective, entertaining and butt-firesafe if something went wrong. \~6 weeks ago i was ganked by Tornado and Harbinger. So the gankers not only didn't get any profit but  lost 20-30kk ISK, comparing the cost of their ships with a loot my Gila dropped.
---
No they will be paid by kills not by time. So ur losing cloaky camper gaining active ones.
---
Hi seccers sell them herons for 9mil for example.
---
It doesn't say for how long the information is stored.
---
What is defined as a "reasonable" amount of time? Is it five days, five months, five years or 10?
---
What information is regarded as having statistical use?
---
What happens to the information if it's transferred to their third party companies some of which are located in China
---
What happens if you request a deletion of your data but that data has been transferred to it's third party contractors based in China does that deletion mean just deletion from CCP or from all third party contractors or other companies that they own.
---
Why does the privacy policy mention third party companies located in China when it also says it can transfer your data to sister companies?
---
When they say information can be anonymized they dont state if it can be de-anonymized.
---
Dont Black ops already have a cloak, same same but different
---
So I imagine, but with greater speeds, I imagine warp space is a vacuum, right?
---
No asset safety in spooky jspace.
---
People in belt see Dscan Inhib on overview and warp out.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
i bet you actually believe this
---
While you're attacking TEST, Mittens is laughing his a** off. Well done. The man who actually wants to see highsec burn is the man enjoying himself.
---
Wait it comes and they'll cry having to bash 300km of bubbles on pocket gates entries. There is always a way to harvest tears. Unfortunatly the no local thing will just serve the one too bored / bad to catch people just by using their brains.
---
And as always everybody wants put their belly on the table and eat meatballs without having to sweat a bit. Because : "hey VNI's are hard to catch", caps dps too much, supers can jump out... blablabla... 
---
As we all know there is always a way to achieve something if you want to sweat a bit for it.
---
Having everything arriving in our throat.. yeah i don't sign for that kind of meat. Better fight red cross.... oh wait ! They're getting spicy now a day !
---
If you want such specifics that not even CCP security can tell you, why the fuck are you asking on reddit?
---
Join hogs collective.  Fly solo or with a fleet at your back.  For solo play we have many options.  Hauling, mining, exploring, and even pvp.  Ever bight off more than you can chew that's what good Corp mates are for.   We got groups doing quite literally everything in the game.  Never a lack of engaging content.  Best part is when your ready for a break enjoy the quiet serenity of a  highsec non war deck able corp
---
i'd really like to see how this items looks in the database, if it's nothing more than a lore string nothing particular would happen
---
if it's connected to an UUID, it would mean your old UUID has been disabled and just the mere assets and ownership UUIDs had been updated to a totally new account with new UUID except for this reference here as it now links to an UUID either not present or marked dead in the system ... would be funny to do a full analysis on what has not been changed and what implications this would allow to happen XD
---
there was an improper sample code for updating and inserting names into MySQL in the past, that allowed to turn invisible for logging plugins/mods in other games due to the bad sample code everyone used
---
you could make an first imprint of your username with some capitals in your name, then relog without capitals in your name and when trying to update the sample code would use a case-sensitive operation and fail, when then the actual insert operation of a supposedly new user ALSO fails but silently because it is non-case-sensitive and identified the user being already registered and failing silently in the code ... boy the people were stunned as how can someone grief their shit without ANY notice in their logs :D
---
Give it a while before you go to a major Alliance, changes are afoot
---
Lots of our boys triplebox in fights lol
---
Count me in sir!
---
Because Reddit is read by 115K users of Eve and someone might have asked the same question and I'm sure people from CCP read Reddit. The answer to this question is actually enshrined in EU law and it's something that should be available to every potential user of Eve online 
---
The answer should be available for everybody so they can make an informed decision about whether to input their data to the Eve systems or not.
---
HighSec is the true EVE endgame content!
---
Hehe this was my thought as well.
---
The ride never ends!
---
I like you, you can have one, I made 10 I will be on tomorrow.
---
No intel in wspace isn't that bad considering you get randomly connected and your chances of hitting a certian wh are slim.
---
You know compared to the connected gates of nullsec, you also have intel to cover that with intel channels which will still be effective post change. You want intel but don't want hunters to have any.
---
The intel point is just terrible based on how different the space is.
---
My empathic abilities tell me you will shit yourself once local is gone. :)))
---
But idk how many I can get rid of because if one person registers the name its pointless so you can have one if you don't register the name.
---
You mean the ones that didn't want it?
---
you get easy mode and it's still not easy enough?
---
Raise the Axe, get the Tax?
---
115k subscribers, but almost none of them suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and similar disorders that would make them care this badly about whether they store chat logs in a game for 1 year or 10. The info provided in their privacy policy is all most people need. If you really think their policy does not follow EU law, you should be talking to EU (preferrably through a lawyer), not us.

That actually penalises the semi-afk people but not the bots.

There isnt a keepstar in every system nor are their titans on every gate. Dont believe everything you read. More stuff dies in Delve than any other region. I would bet we lose more in a month than all of wormhole space combined over the same time period. So how safe is Delve again?
---
He's sighing because he's in one of the nullsec PVE coalitions and the thought of PVP mentally exhausts and disgusts him.
---
He probably used a script to touch him too, like the sotiyos
---
Well you don't represent anybody here except yourself and I don't need permission from you to post what I want to post and I don't think you know the minds of anybody else except yourself and I certainty don't give any credibility to you if you're someone who throws around the word "Paranoid Schizophrenia" so lightly on a Reddit sub and if you can't have an interaction without the use of the "F" word then you're not someone I have any interest to interact with.

"What is PLEX Vault?"
---
Think before you troll you just like stupid.
---
Lol, this wont last. But if it did, it would take a couple of months before the tax is raised to help fund its defense:)
---
As soon as you put a competitor market up. Horde/TEST responds by lowering the brokers fees at their front market in Obanen to 0.0% rate will stay at 0.0% until they can kill yours. They use Obanen market specifically to starve out competitor markets. After it will go back up to 0.5%.
---
Since when is 500 PLEX a year of subscription?
---
Yeah thats called a bug..
---
every coalition leading alliance in nullsec.
---
&gt; 
---
Already been posted.
---
Seeing how last week one of their 1 year old character lost a Tiamat and then selling a Vendetta and Vanquisher before rage quitting....
---
If only they could bot experience.
---
No seriously, think about your idea from multiple angles, so you may hopefully realise it’s worthless before posting.
---
LOL RR contains all of China, got it.
---
Pitchforks against railguns and missiles.
---
Indeed, this is  a good analogy to describe the coming conflict.
---
Are you going to defend it with crucifiers?
---
not sure if you can read or not but this post supports drifters
---
Even if we did have keepstar in every system, titans on every gate and intel reported, there are way too many dumb people who don't use the tools they are given. Even we more or less point and laugh at them. We do have great intel, posts with fits to keep you alive, yet the turbo-krabs pay no attention to intel or local, fit hyperspatial supers with no tank, rat afk, etc. They don't even pay attention to when we go to war, drifters attack, etc. They are only concerned with doing the bare min to stay in and then krab away.
---
Every large alliance has people like this, its not just us. Local will disappear, and they won't even realize it happened because they live in the spodbrain bubble. The will think "man, nobody's here I got the whole place to myself". If anything the changes may make groups a leaner, tighter fighting machine, forcing these turbo-krabs to adapt or die. 
---
While I think CCP is trying to avoid us ending up with the same fate as Serinity, I hate the dartboard type style approach they take at times where they just throw something and see what sticks. After 10+ years it does get old, but I sure don't want to see things die off and a game close. I got my fingers crossed on this one and maybe they push this out to everywhere but high sec.
---
Sure! But what if the bubbles are dropped by individuals who are in good standing? The easy work around here is either a.) positive standing HICtors or b.) positive standing FAXs to just keep the bubbles perma-repaired but all in all this is a compromise I would be willing to go with!
---
ima steal that for the next azbel name ;)
---
His ferox account probably is alpha too so he has to log off his 10 rorqual alts during the op.
---
As soon as the market is online and public it appears in the ESI which horde/TEST can see and probably scrape with a tool reporting it whenever they can.
---
Considering I keep stealing Tests komodo BPC's I don't really worry about the isk :P
---
I offer 15mil
---
This is what I have been doing, but it usually requires them to become complacent and rat with a neutral in local. Then it’s easier to approach them from the front while cloaked in a SB, ram into them with MWD on, apply scram, slow down below 500, and covert Cyno up. Makes for a lot of work for a 70m ISK Jill.
---
Shoulda used the Perimeter.
---
Also only 50 months not 50 years
---
Content being made nice but I feel like you guys will burn out before they do...
---
Good luck regardless tho!
---
Not only has this already been posted, but you're really bad at math.
---
So explain.. no please tell us your ideas? Because at the moment you've come  with zero
---
I got kicked from Horde for putting up an 0.1% Azbel market. Sad indeed.
---
Seems like it still achieves what you want it to if they drop their tax.
---
Sure, sure, RR is filled with botters, also when you get headshotted in a first person shooter its obviously because you had server lag and totally not your fault
---
But what if I prefer to be bitter?

I really have to do your critical thinking for you? Ok, you approached the issue with bias, building your argument on the premise that cloaky camping is generally agreed to be broken, while in fact it’s a very contentious issue.

A ton of mobile game companies rip off IPs due to them being located in a country that does not police the practice. This is not first game that has ripped off Eve, won't be the last.

I saw a lot of "make null dangerous again" comments coming from ppl that's were in medium to small alliances. Most of null blocks dudes told the opposite since the blocks are the most capable to defend themself and that changes will hurt primary small actors. (but ofc I saw also the opposite, but I feel the majority of null blocks guys are ok with this changes)
---
Maybe I don't want to completely invisible?
---
Uhh its only a first if you just started playing eve. Goons and test run a coalition, or strategic partnership called Imperial Legacy, making them blue(tral) to 3 quarters of the map
---
I expect it being a structure whack a mole while being harassed by something like nados but thats about all. Hope im wrong tho
---
EVE is just a ripoff of earlier games like Escape Velocity, Elite, and Ultima Online anyway, so turnabout is fair play I guess.
---
Besides, intellectual property is theft from the great creative force of the working class anyway.
---
Do you remember people crying that there wouldn't be any more large plex losses when it came in?

There is minokawa and apostle fits that can face tank at least 4 Titan targeted Doomsday's. There is also the capital emergency hull Energizer.

Not gonna lie, the title made me think this was another "unsubbing reeeee" crypost.
---
Yes but you won't recoup your investment before it pops. If you are trading enough PLEX then you can make the money back that way. As long as the Obanen market is undercutting you, you'll be lucky to clear a billion in broker fees before they knock it down. I speak from experience.

The bean-counters in accounts are in control now, not the game designers.  The golden age of imagination in video games is over.  I was discussing this with someone only yesterday, talking about games like Bioshock, Half Life and so on.  Metro came close but even that was derivative.  Anyway... don't get me started.
---
Fine by me. A race to the bottom is great, in my mind. Sure, the Imperium gets a slice of TTT, but it's not a slice we *need.* MAD is an ideal scenario.
---
[deleted]
---
"I’ve been saving ISK for awhile now" Has the meaning of "awhile" changed and I'm not aware of it?
---
True. You needed an hourglass for swapping modules.
---
Give it time. Once the krabs stop plexing their subs and there's nobody left to pay ISK for all the PLEX already in the game, CCP might have to do something drastic to get rid of the massive supply left over.
---
Dude, FRT is losing and no one is alarm clocking anything. We could leave them alone for 3 months and they would still be in risk of losing their space simply by their members being burnt out. And thats before the cleanup of all our dropped structures.
---
And if you had been involved you would have seen the effects as their fleets keep getting smaller and their remarks harsher.
---
I would have preferred the war to be prosecuted differently but the situation calls for this.
---
Have you looked at them recently?
---
They never said they would successfully defend it. Being paid handsomely (.2%) to have content come right to your doorstep is a sweet deal.
---
This. Our leadership types are entirely too normal and stable personalities. We need to get better at selecting unhinged sociopaths for key positions.
---
so to be clear, you're planning on defending this against the combined might of TEST/Panfam/Goons? how? putting any items here is just asking to be put into asset safety
---
Popping four moons a day in j-space that provide everything needed for t2 construction....that sounds a lot like the stuff that comes out of my butt.

How to got easy button but still search easy way...
---
&gt;Shoulda used the Perimeter.
---
This just in the latest from /r/eve ! /u/Vily_R seen stating that you should RMT your plex from TTT in Perimeter so that they can get a cut of your dirty filthy RMT isk!
---
where is Evil Thug when you need him
---
I don't think skilling towards the Gila is a bad choise at all. It's a very strong ship and the skills for it will absolutely be useful in both PvE and PvP.
---
The reason I recommended an exploration alt was as I said because the potential for profit. It also teaches you to fly in more dangerous space (in that you will die a lot until you learn but it's fine since you start out with cheap ships).
---
Ahh ok, I didn't really understand what you understood but is there something you think I should try haha?

If the cloaky campers actually come out to fight that's good. The problematic ones are the ones that do nothing.

Actually no. Like i don't want to hunt drifters, but people who will do it.         
---
Currently people are just docking up when drifters (NPC) are showing up.
---
I heard Centipede Caliphate. are a cool bunch of dudes.

Branch is fun. We just hit 10b isk in kills since Friday:
---
 https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98146705/
---
Classic RAM doubling scam
---
Next time you read my replys I suggest turning your eyes off and then back on again
---
It cleared 1b in the first 2.5 hours, sooooo :))
---
:ok_hand:
---
Not sure how many lvl5s I have buut at over 270mil SP on my main without ever injecting
---
F
---
So you think they should up the isk making to 2b/h in nullsec to balance the risk? Cause I would totally be down for that.
---
The comparison is bad mate, WHs and null are 2 different beasts. Ofc u can have active defense fleets and Im sure WH dwellers arent siting idly by and getting ganked without a response. 
---
But youre missing the point even if you yourself are making it. Only really 2 types of ships will be viable for saves, Rorqs and supers and these under a supercap umbrella. So what do you think will happen with no local? More or less people joining groups with umbrellas?
---
And Im certain that you think the blue donut is bad so why are you so happy that its going to get even bigger?
---
And you could never be sure about the server knowing you just swapped your modules
---
Haha that they want highsec to defend,  its funny but won't last
---
You are pure cringe. Nice troll.
---
Pretty much the definition of a successful rollout in this case :D
---
more like 4,1 years...
---
muhkrab
---
people in wormholes definitely never PVE
---
might last longer than &lt;insert jab at your space guild's recent failure&gt;

You could drop one in each anom if it lasted 48 hours

wouldn't work. Unless they MWD scanning at 64au you can get the class of ship.
---
You don't keep your laptop and a family member around for this?
---
What makes you think I'm a he? Why couldn't I be a she? Do you know me? Have you been reading my chat logs?
---
If you really think can n will defend against test/panfam/goons you're a fool they simply wanna make some quick isk over the grr vily hype train and let it burn
---
wweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllll
---
Strictly, no, a gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 bytes. A \_gibibyte\_ is  1,073,741,824 bytes.
---
Not that anyone but hard drive manufacturers use that definition.
---
If the risk becomes higher than the gain then people will stop doing it. That means less content, not more. I dont get why people are missing this. 
---
Fixing the blue donut and nullsec is something that needs to get done but this change will make it harder for smaller crews to survive, ensuring an even bigger blue donut and in general less prey to hunt.
---
Chori not caring about isk lmao
---
Sounds like they were not worth their money before local blackout then?
---
From CCP's released numbers, it's around 0.5% of Eve players running on 32 bit hardware.
---
What we used to do in Provibloc years ago was make a note of every red that logged off in a system and then every now and then someone would run a locator to see if they were still logged off there.  People who'd moved on were removed from the list.  If they were still present according to the locator the system wasn't considered safe to use.
---
Granted this involved actually seeing them in local, especially when they logged back in again but if you know they're logged off there you can stay frosty for when that happens.
---
Even something as relatively involved as this won't be possible with the blackout.  This is why I don't think any system in null will be "safe" and as a consequence PvE activity is going to drop down to a tenth of its current activity and the only people who're going to do it will either be in very cheap ships or very expensive ones, with cynos.
---
You know what's worse than 0.5% tax? 15.2% plex traders should care
---
Only the ones that never leave
---
 [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/recorded-with-a-potato](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/recorded-with-a-potato)
---
You can just pull the market order down, move all that stuff to the next citadel (without any risk, because tethering) and put it up again
---
Aren't you the dude scripting the looting of sotiyos? Probably shouldn't brag about it
---
And now you've paid twice..
---
It's not exactly a release. It's a flip of a flag.
---
They released a fair time ago now, and are above 35% usage already.
---
Just get a house
---
Make bombers great again!
---
Tribute will be the northern open pvp and hotdrop region for atleast the rest of 2019 to farm the poor victims who are going to life there.
---
UUID is still going to the same as it was when he registered.  He just changed his username, which is probably just a simple text field.
---
Well duh lmao
---
First of all not the comparaison isn't bad, WH farm hole are a fair balance of risk and reward. It's not the case in NS, there is no risk at all. Sure small caps can't be saved with cynos but they can be saved with active defense fleet, watching intel channel and using dscan. Basically not being afk and not being shit.
---
&gt; More or less people joining groups with umbrellas?
---
There is basically two options here :
---
- You're a super / carrier / rorqual pilot. Local or not the only thing you have to do to be save is light a cyno.
---
- You don't own a carrier / rorqual yet and you're subcap ratting. The super umbrella wasn't going to save you before, and it's not going to save you know. Except now you will have to watch intel instead of local and set up ganks or people watching gates to report roams rather than just watch local. So basically actually live in the space you control. Such a tough change to ask people.
---
&gt; And Im certain that you think the blue donut is bad so why are you so happy that its going to get even bigger?
---
Because nothing can prevent people from blueing up each others, because strong groups will always prey on weaker groups and nobody this won't change no matter what CCP implements.
---
I mean all groups need to adapt to the changing environment, small groups are already struggling. Would you rather things stay the same and the stagnation persist?
---
Admirable, but eve is a game of rock, paper, scissors, blob, and batphone.
---
My suggestion was making the stuff around the blackops not appear on dscan.
---
Not sure actually if what your dscan shows if you are inside the field, but it could also prevent a tackled super/rorqual from just posting a dscan of the agressors.
---
You could also hide ratting supers with it until the first hunter with combat probes comes around
---
Trained no, learned trough injectors - yes.
---
Paying 0.2% twice is still cheaper then paying 0.5% once
---
Frustrated tournament people loved having no local as it crapped out every few days last year. CCP is doing that for maybe several weeks. Then they get to explain to Pearl Abyss why over 10k characters stopped logging in.
---
&gt; I dont get why people are missing this.
---
People aren't missing this, they just aren't cry babies and know very well that removing local is hardly putting more risk to anyone who isn't trash and unorganized.
---
Don't roam with a BC, you will always get tackled and ganked if you are in hostile space, rather use a t1 cruiser, or maybe a navy faction frigate or assault frig, there are plenty things you can kill in those. Best ones for solo pvp imho are XLASB Stabber, Dual rep thorax , buffer neut vexor / Navy slicer , Blast comet.
---
You sound like you could use some pie
---
NC dock mad that undocking is dangerous
---
*shocked*
---
This guy just got away, I expected this by looking at his last loss:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/72438633/
---
Why not just buff it so that it costs 1mil, hides itself, and covers the entire system.
---
why? If they're on grid you can just look at them
---
Lol you literally just have to look at Zkill to see how much shit is farmed in o3 daily you retard.
---
"i don't care about the isk, just the $ i sell it for"
---
good luck ramming a VNI moving at 1km/s
---
blocking D-scan is a combat recon thing
---
Im done with gila skills. I might skill my alt or main for it cuz it seems fun. Btw im omega on both account. This it help? Do you have the skills path for it or it just in eve wiki?
---
Found the antifa dude.
---
I think the best solution would be for Drones not to auto aggro NPC's. 
---
We still need a counter for ecm in PVP as well as the mechanic of getting people to aggro on a gate unintentionally just because they have drones out.
---
&gt;  which features "Oracle Empire" and looks a like a heavy Amaar empire 
---
You should see the ships from the [Republic of Svarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUy3Y5AdViI).  Rupture and Stabber rip-offs are pretty flagrant.
---
Fake, I'm way fatter.
---
math too hard
---
Off the top of my head I think that's a hisec static. Nerd
---
So instead of paying a small increase in tax because entities such as yours are putting pressure on Vily, you decide to let the people take the hit in the form of crucifiers being stockpiled which I'm guessing you will happily be selling for a generous markup.
---
Like most people asserting that wormhole = nullsec with blackout, you probably aren't the brightest.
---
(1) What kind of rewards are offered for WH PvE?
---
(2) How many characters does WH PvE support per system?
---
(3) Are there permanent gates into WH that cannot be closed?
---
(4) Can you use cynos in WH?
---
(5) Does WH activity show up on the map?
---
So, what we have here are two completely dissimilar things.
---
My man.
---
I like how you just repeat yourself rather than answer my arguments.
---
Leave my titan and super out of this. Their EHP and DD are fine.
---
This kill confirm the validity of those "cries"      
---
Imagine how many more such things could died if we didn't have this safe, shared storage.
---
oof, you got me
---
it is definitely harder to keep one pair of eyes on a static, unmoving gate than it is to constantly check for new sigs
---
"The machinery of the empire shuddered, convulsing as Botman2.0 watched in shock, while years of narcissistic delusions of grandeur began to slip away."
---
My personal favourite part.
---
I mean it's possible, You'd have to chain it out.
---
You are the guy with the looting script.
---
Trained? No. 
---
Injected? Yes.
---
Oh that's easy.  I get a tool that pings me whenever a new sig appears.  It's called the fucking probe scanner window.  In nullsec there's the static gates AND new sigs to worry about.
---
And you almost had me convinced with your bullet-proof argument.
---
Yikes.
---
but i don't want it to hide itself
---
&gt; It'd be a lot of work for CCP but i do believe they're ambitious enough to end up doing stuff like that.
---
hahahahahahahaha. friend....
---
Stealing valuable BPCs from big null blocs good
---
Using scripts to do so bad
---
Dude, its apples and oranges.
---
Active subcap defense fleets, I mean, I have been in many places and I havent really seen this thing youre talking about. Youre creating a narrative which doesnt really fit into reality. And if people dont fit your narrative they are afk and shit.
---
Well, I dont get why you are saying obvious things here. My question was, more or less people going to join bigger groups.
---
Ehh dude. Every reddit post about the blue donut for the past years has been explaining why certain CCP implemented changes has  furthered the blue donut and now youre just rejecting all of that and saying nothing CCP does matters. Come on. Plenty of things can be done to actually improve the game, removing local is extremely gimmicky at best and not on that list.
---
I should've been doing advertising all long lol.
---
My favorite though was when people forgot about the bulkeads giving you more hull than before, you go below 0 without bulkheads and the ship explodes. That and waiting for 2 hours while your hull repairs.
---
My first carrier capable character has remote capital hull repair trained to 5. Not very useful these days sadly :)
---
I have no idea about warp space :P I guess it is whatever we imagine it to be.
---
The lensmen series of books has some good points within where it describes starships that went so fast through normal space (faster than light, I believe, but not sure) that they had to be made teardrop shaped for the aerodynamic properties.
---
&gt; I have been in many places and I havent really seen this thing youre talking about
---
Horde ? Brave ?
---
&gt; Ehh dude. Every reddit post about the blue donut for the past years has been explaining why certain CCP implemented changes has furthered the blue donut and now youre just rejecting all of that and saying nothing CCP does matters. Come on. Plenty of things can be done to actually improve the game, removing local is extremely gimmicky at best and not on that list.
---
I think you're mistaking "blue donut" and "super umbrella" which are 2 different things. And removing local is not about any of those two, it's about making roaming in NS a lot less of a pain in the ass.
---
And your arguments would be what? You are saying obvious things without furthering the point which then would be an argument. In this case the only thing I find even close to an argument is that NS roaming will be a lot less of a pain in the ass. Which I then argued that you are wrong because less content meaning even bigger pain in the ass.
---
Youre still missing the point but you will see it in time.
---
As long as you deny someone (even an alpha alt of yours) it shouldn't show up in the API as it's not "open to the public" anymore. This was implemented back in the day when citadels were launched so it may have changed at some point though.
---
Yes.
---
The drifter fleets yesterday were taking out supers.
---
There's literally  nothing you can do if there's a risk of one of those fleets dropping on you unless you can cyno in a decent amount of support
---
ok, be sure to post here any timer, I'll gladly have an alt temporarily join the corp to defend :d
---
Welp, Some may call me an app champ, and others just a target. but i made it into goonswarm federation. Thanks for all the help everyone! Haters can lick my nads ;-\*
---
Supporting Volta instead of Test? Hell yeah
---
With just one wing, how does one measure the WINGSPAN?
---
The equation risk v reward or effort v reward is totally different in there, as are the threats and the mechanics.   I mean you people are always bragging about your isk/h.  You can't have it both ways.
---
It's not comparable so completely irrelevant to the nullsec blackout discussion.
---
I believe there is now loot. (May just be salvage. but not just metal scraps).
---
I don't have first hand experience, however.
---
The stabs are the backup plan
---
You mean aside from half the reddit and eve-o post made in the last few years?
---
Yeah they need to be a lot cheaper to be significantly useful.
---
&gt;Seriously first evening for a quite a while and all activities stopped across the nullsec as people were hit by 50-70 ship drifter fleets.
---
Speak for yourself. I got my fair share of kills last night.
---
So they have 24h active subcap defense fleets? With real numbers? Not just a small group? If so only because people constantly roam there but that is most def not the case with most of NS. There will always be a small group doing that but by far nothing like the thing you are describing and its very localized, a few systems.
---
No Im certain Im not mistaken. And those 2 are highly connected due to their underlying factors. Punishing afk ratters. Lol. If they were afk then a local wouldnt have helped them anyways right? Because they would be afk and not watching it?
---
Im sorry friend, you are just wasting my time. You will see the results of this in due time.
---
Totally agreed. We need mechanics like this to keep eve interesting.  Plus they would nake good traps!
---
Gila is the only choice
---
I believe we call that corp "Dreddit" and DREDDIT IS RECRUITING.
---
Here's my upvote Sir
---
Domi
---
They could literally have just gone to the Unity Engine talent headhunting forums and found a skilled hobbyist who could have had every one of these ships reskinned and retextured in a year.  And it would cost a fraction of what it is likely costing CCP internally to do handful of ships.
---
Why are we suicide ganking in crucifiers?
---
Two entities have controlled perimeter since citadels were introduced ichooseyou/horde &amp; test, this is over what a 3 year period? How is it  fantasizing if that's actually the level of stability that people are used to.
---
carebears over react to everything, like as long as your not retarded your fine
---
Subcap ratting will largely be extinguished. You may see the odd Myrmidon trying to rat, and that's only because you can cover the cost of the hull after insurance in like 2 or 3 ticks.
---
Supercaps will rat as normal under umbrellas.
---
They should be more like you and backstab every blue they ever had, right?
---
You know people make ISK in a wide variety of ways and different amounts of time commitment, right? How long do you think it would take to save up for a VNI if you hopped online and did 1 level 3 mission per day? Would you say that might be "a while"?
---
I know for me it’s going to be “more fun” to only sub one of 4 accounts and focus on cloaky dropping on ratters and miners in my enemies areas of operation.  
---
I’m not doing my rorq/exhumer miming in this environment.  No way.  It was already easy enough for Olmeca to steal thousands of excavators even when you knew he was in the fucking system.  Now what?  I’ll be replacing excavators every siege cycle.  No thanks.
---
Nobody farms the lower anoms, not worth it
---
Felt appropriate while sitting on the toilet. Maybe you'll think twice next time you open your fat mouth. But of course you're one of those players that thinks being known is better than having skill, so I probably doubt it. You live for the attention until someone smarter and more talented comes along to wipe your nose and change your diaper. You simple get salty and run away like a tween girl. Enjoy the game where I rule and you get schooled. Cheers.
---
&gt; I’ve long left sov null
---
In other words you're approaching this from a state of ignorance.
---
cry quietly
---
I mean honestly if you serious about it i would personally hit the TEST market with a regular RF ( they don't have a willingness for a long struggle ), so you have to win the long term fight meaning hitting loads of RFs until and controlling for numbers, until well you get all 3 timers in like a like multiple months. but it takes a lot of money for structures to sink for the wardec.

Why would it be extinguished? I genuinely don’t get the thought process at all.

If I have to be at my keyboard to hit dscan every 2 seconds then for that level of effort and attention I can and will make more isk elsewhere. 
---
Null ratting without a super is garbage isk and only worth doing because it involves near 0 input and a small amount of screen real estate.
---
Which is why I asked... fuck me, it's simple question.
---
So considering that, what you're saying is null shouldn't exist? Because that danger is 100% player controlled and from seeing the past 5+ years, null players do not want pvp, they just want no risk and growing their wallet.
---
We need moa of this.
---
Baited on a free flair
---
If only there was a way to have something like a lachesis subcap alt on grid with your 4 rorqs ready to point those command dessies.
---
Because the vni got nerfed, for one, and for another, caps can be saved easily by a super umbrella.
---
What he is doing to earn that is irrelevant, it's not what I asked.
---
Just like most of the subreddit
---
Sorry I just took your question as implying something like "how could you *possibly* be taking a "while" to save up for a VNI??" like you were incredulous that anyone could ever need more than a week to make 100 mil. That's the tone I took from it.
---
Good bot
---
People still kill ratting supers with bombers
---
This basically won't change anything for ratters. Capital will just cyno to be saved and subcaps will have to watch an intel channel instead of local. The big deal is for botters who will have to change either set up gate check everywhere or die, retards who don't watch intel channel and NS roamers who will have a much easier time roaming NS without everything running away before they even have uncloaked from taking the gate.
---
~~carebears~~ EVE players
---
You dont have to be in nul to understand it, eve's a pretty stragiht forward game...
---
By what standard? I don't think a single one has died with more than 1 fax repping it since x47. Only being able to kill these when ratting and moving is not healthy for the game.
---
No not at all, I lived in sov null for like 4 years and ratted most days to help keep the systems high. Get out of your basement and see the world, might make you less confrontational over space pixels.
---
No. The problem would be lack of pve producing stuff
---
The only way to safeguard subcap ratting is to hide when danger occurs. Subcaps don't have the tank to survive cynoing in the supercap umbrella, and the timeframe of a gank is too short for any amount of response fleet to come to aid. Without the ability to see danger coming, subcaps just die. Hence, no one sane will use them, outside of disposable myrmidons.
---
Yeah good point, I must admit the thought of mashing it regularly doesn’t sound like great content to me. However, they do it in wormholes, even low class ones with less isk potential than null?
---
I'll be honest I largely agree, despite being in one in theory. It just doesn't feel that way for me because we've got a core group of Dreddit nerds that I hang out and do small gang with. That said, I haven't gotten that feel from most of the rest of Test and wouldn't encourage newbros to go elsewhere.
---
There are small cultures within the big empires that can be really good to be a part of. The big null blocs are nothing even resembling homogeneous when you look at them from the inside. Being in Spartan Vanguard vs being in Dreddit, for example, you really can't compare that.
---
A vni won't break 60m an hour, before tax.
---
Even shit wormholes will be worth more isk, and you can close all the entrances and don't have to worry about fleets of drifters appearing out of nowhere and instagibbing you.
---
It’s one rorqual and 3 exhumers.  A Lachesis is seriously 50 days of training just for the hull.  
---
I already have webs/scrams on my hulk.  
---
My point here is that when I undock to mine I wish to actually mine.  If a WH opens and 100 inner hell roll in, I’m prepared for that because I don’t fly shit fits.  
---
What I’m talking about are just the calculus on risk/reward when I consider most like will replace 2-4 excavators in a session.  Negates the mining income.  
---
I mine to build PvP ships for me and my Corp.  not to replace excavators.  
---
So again... “fun” will be defined by blowing shit up and I definitely won’t be sitting in an anom waiting for content.
---
If the person is afk camping, then the entire purpose of them doing that is to get the locals use to them.being there and taking the strategic risk to undock.
---
Not having local does that automatically. Noe the afk camper has no benefit to being afk.
---
So yes, it does remove the afk camping issue.
---
I can't remember doing anything other than fighting people when I was in lowsec, and when I visit, all I do is fight people, so I'm pretty sure you got it right. Sometimes they kill super shiny belt rats to make isk while looking for people to fight.
---
As for the major null empires yeah they're fairly similar. If anyone's interested in them, my recommendation is **find a good corp**. The alliance is culturally important, but the corp is moreso. The number of times I've seen on a Dreddit app "I was the only gay man in a corp full of American neonazis" or "we're the only 3 USTZ guys" from \[insert other null corp refugee here\] is hilariously high. Know who you're flying with. Know their culture and their active timezone.
---
It's a 66% increase, thats not exactly small right?  Especially for those of us trading on thin margin items already (especially Plex/injectors/etc), and uptick that high is pretty unpalatable.
---
C2/C5-Null is really is own show at this point, unique from the rest of jspace culture and activity.
---
&gt; Without the ability to see danger coming
---
Goons, largest alliance in Eve, can't forsee the old concept of intel channels.
---
I wouldn't go to lowsec because it's more populated by hunters than nullsec and wh space is. Just go to null or wh, you will get killed there, but it will pay much much more. Just check out some tutorials on YouTube on how to avoid drag and interdiction bubbles, how to avoid gatecamps and etc.
---
closing entrances doesnt mean much. dscan and probe scanner is what matters
---
Yup. We've got how many in Dreddit right now 6k? I ping a USTZ corp fleet I get 10-20 guys. The good news is those guys are great, and ima keep doin it. Every time I see a new face it's one less krab and one more hecate / nomen / tornado covered in killmarks.

You make it sound like the only ship that can rat is a VNI, there are plenty of others and ratting isn't going anywhere. It's one the most newbro friendly things going and very easy to get into (part of the problem). More people will be dying but it will still be the go-to for most people.
---
Imagine renting from Rote Kapelle.
---
Right noe the risk seems too low.
---
In highsec there is more risk.
---
Vily literally raised taxes yesterday after promising not to. How is that the stability you're purporting to exist? 
---
At any moment, the players controlling those structures could choose to fuck over every single person, or a subset of people, using them. And if you think they *won't* then you seem to have missed what eve really is.
---
DREDDIT IS RECRUITING.
---
We are also recruiting targets.
---
&gt; focus on cloaky dropping on ratters and miners in my enemies areas of operation
---
If you're not doing it why do you think your enemies will be?
---
Then you're not belonging to the absolute majority of players who do not use Mobile Scan Inhibitor exactly because of the fact it is visible on Dscan. 99% of people who like to hide something, don't like to left huge bread crumbs on Dscan to draw even more attention and interest. Speaking of useless and stillborn modules in Eve.
---
That’d be nice in fact. +1 ! ;)
---
emergent gameplay, bitch, look it up
---
Missing out on Brand Newbros, which is Dreddit's sister/feeder corp. Middle of an active war and extremely high on both big fleet and small gang content right now. If you meet the reqs for Dreddit instead just join Dreddit.
---
The actual most active pvp zone in Eve, at least according to zkill. :)
---
Now I feel hungry :(
---
your subcap ratters will be fine too, especially if they fit a neuting/MJD dominix.
---
It's still Deto and surrounding regions in real speech.
---
Yeah but...why don't the developers just fix the bugs and lag, i'm not a dev but it should be easy right?
---
*do i need an /s here?*
---
Gotcha. Note to self, go LXQ and don't get 300 caracals formed next time.
---
Guess we’ll find out
---
Okay, so bots go to Eth?
---
Useless against covert cynos.
---
Going from .3% tax to .5% is a 66% increase? where did you learn to count?
---
That really wouldn't work for jump freighters, though. They don't fight and forcing every JF ever to have an entire fleet following/guarding both ruins their entire role (why have fatigue reduction if you have to wait an hour for escort anyway?) and makes them basically unuseable for anyone but the biggest blobs.
---
Intel channels will be much less reliable in a local blackout situation.
---
I guess if covert cynos don't exist, this is true. Unfortunately, we live in a much harsher reality.
---
I can definitely vouch for Dreddit, as one of the main USTZ small gang fcs there. Like PGL and Legate say, our corps do have a lot of their own communities, and no one corp "is TEST". No, not even Dreddit.
---
&gt; Auto-Drones take double bandwidth
---
thats just a fancy way of removing auto agro entirely, kind of like how auto pilot is worthless because it doesnt warp to 0
---

---
Are you kidding?
---
I never stop
---
Don't threaten me with a good time!
---
if a covops cyno lights on a carrier or super ratting, its probably going to die, too.
---
No we'll see the age of the mobile.scan inhibitor camp.
---
Just drop scan inhibitors in systems and people will.habe no idea of they are actually hiding something or not.
---
Cloaky eyes solves all issues you mention.
---
1) Fleets do not engage/retreat based on the number of users in system, they use scouts putting eyes on the enemy fleet.
---
2) Scouts will find targets under the blackout the same way they find them now, DScan, Anoms etc. 
---
3) Miners and Ratters in Null have access to intel channels reporting very specific info about enemy fleet movement.
---
Having local is nothing more than a crutch and complaints about its possible demise are emblematic of the bigger problem in Eve, players want pvp only when they want it and want to krab and mine untouched the rest of the time. We forget that at its heart Eve is a pvp game.
---
You missed all the grr
---
Boot.ini
---
I think it’s going to be the “more people will be dying” that will prevent those people from ratting.  
---
This change will have a consequence on what’s undocked.  Period.
---
Sell the caps in Low sec for a discount.  
---
Sell the JF.   
---
With what you have left you could do a lot of even blingy small gang stuff for a good long time and have someone else do your logistics.
---
Wormholes still have more options for control and security than a Stargate does.
---
How do intel channels see neural/reds in system if there’s no local?  Do the intel channels do it automatically?  What do goons have that the rest of eve doesn’t have?  Hacks??
---
**Jita 4-4 4 life** ignore the games these fools play.
---
As my old boss used to say:   “Look, it can’t be that difficult.  You’re basically just changing some numbers around.  This shouldn’t take more than a couple days tops”
---
please just GROW SOME FUCKING BALL HOLY SHIT
---
It’s gonna feel like wow raiding spamming a keybind on every gcd.
---
Fuck that.
---
The stability I'm referring to is the structure and the setup of multiple structures. Relisting 100+ buy orders, losing the isk you have paid to raise those buy orders, getting stuff used for production sent to asset safety, these are the main things that bother producers / traders in perimeter more the tax rise. I dont think they would fuck anyone over, they are making trillions per month, I wouldn't make sense to bit the hand that feeds you.
---
Yes? Hence, why I said "supercaps will rat as normal under umbrellas." The sticking point is subcaps.
---
Just download some more.
---
&gt; I don't remember why they took it out. 
---
Because people fitted shield/armor modules first and after both were peeled from the ship, they fitted max hull tank. Back then you didn't see both sides of the fight dropping supers like candy so caps were considerably harder to deal with when they kept swapping tank type.
---
It's doomed to drift eternally... But that doesnt mean you cant do something fun with it. Get creative.
---
Hello, what´s the best alpha ratting fit for the times to come when the VNI  and the alpha drone capacity get nerfed?
---
Get the fuck out.
---
I hope the roamers like roaming into ~~supper dropping~~ big alliance space, otherwise welcome to the wasteland. 
---
Remember: **You asked for it**
---
From soloing as a neutral in the WZ for a couple of months now:
---
* Caldari gives decent solo fights and has a fuckton of mission bots
---
* Gallente has a fuckton of plexing bots and blobs / drops on anything that fucks with them
---
* Neutral corps in the cal/gal wz are mixed on fight quality
---
* Amarr gives good solo and small gang fights but respond quickly. Also a fuckton of mission bots.
---
* Minnie is a lot of solo plexers right now that can give you fights.
---
Dirt n Glitter is recruiting.
---
Get yourself a fancy keyboard...
---
Why bother with cloaky camping if you can roam without everyone running away and you have a defense fleet to fight ?
---
Here ya go again....
---
sure and im saying a covops cyno will kill a subcap, cap, and supercap equally dead so if i was a krab living in say Delve and wanted to multibox afk krab, id upgrade my VNIs to Dominixes and just take into consideration that a covops cyno might happen and i might lose a few dominixes.
---
What's 66 percent of 0.3 ?
---
Corps that live in C2 with C5 and null static connections are simply C5 groups that also want access to null, that's why they're grouped with high-class corps. The only major difference is that you can't really attack them with Caps and they can't drop caps on you outside of their C2, which rarely happens outside of evictions anyways.
---
OP separated them from all other C2 groups because C2 with null/C5 groups are much more similar to C5 groups than they are from other C2 groups.
---
Risk adverse pvpers overreact to anything that might cause them to lose a ship. More at 11.
---
It's really hard to have a dude cloaked on a gate reporting shit or even better a gate camp.
---
You don't understand it because you press buttons when you want, not when FC tells you to.
---
From the weeb spamming aminme in discord... growing balls would be a welcome sight...  holy shit...
---
Who said anything about cloaky camping? Are you not able to see the value of inserting covops cloak fit ships into any system you want, without the ability for defenders to see you taking gates?
---
0.3% multiplied by 0.66x = 0.5%
---
No collusion

Data site loot is random, not tied specific factions afaik.
---
Triglavians seem to be against anything not "one human, one mind". This puts rogue drones, drifters and sansha's clearly in their black book since all three violate this rule.
---
Soooo... **Where's the risk to the afk cloaked ship then?**
---
Useless for 99% of people and situations, bitch. Looking statistically, this is another one 99%-useless and thus stillborn peice of equipment, as a plenty of others in Eve.
---
As a counter to jamming I thought.
---
This 100%.  There will be nothing on your dscans.  Nothing.  And even under the umbrellas it’ll just be big shit that can tank.
---
NPC broker fee is .10% though
---
don't hate because you're not creative enough to come up with interesting use cases
---
Nah, you downgrade to Myrmidons, which have a much shorter time to recoup your inevitable loss. Dominixes make sense if you have some sort of delusion that players in this game only attack one at a time. That's not how the video game works.
---
How often do you see a system on Dotlan with a ton of NPC killed, jumps, whatever activity metric you want, and you jump in and it's empty?  Pretty daamn often, actually.
---
The reason is because of perfect local and intel channels, people know exactly when you're coming.  The NPCs killed graph could still have a perfect vertical spike when they've all logged off and you jump in...
---
But that also goes the other way!  You jump in and you KNOW it is empty because of local.  With Dotlan and no local, you would spend minutes flying around in there looking for people who--maybe--are still ratting or--just as maybe--logged off because of their gate scouts and the same intel resources.  Meanwhile, they are setting up to camp your exit because they saw you go in.  For anyone who's used Dotlan etc. these metrics are not perfect, but even without local would give counterplay to the intruder who has no gate scouts nor handy intel channels.  This change is geared toward content--putting ships on grid, in system together.  Needlessly scanning a bunch of empty systems because you have no idea of the activity seems like the opposite of that.  
---
Never mind the fact that there is not nor should there be an issue with krabs who pay attention.  If you see jumps spiking along an obvious in-route, you can tell a fleet is coming just like they can tell you are ratting.  That should be rewarded.
---
All this being said, I'm only talking about the ratting ecosystem.  "Total blackout" could be really cool implemented for strategic fleets as a way of making groups fight more often, allowing cap fleets to stage unnoticed, and so in.  In those cases, it's fair to be punished for not having 20+ eyes because you've already got a few hundred in your main fleet.  In the more general sense, it's a really short-sighted idea that would kill a lot of the content of this change.
---
That's not how it works in actual alliance level fights. I both hunt ratters and miners and participate in null sec warfare. You are only thinking about this from a ratting/miner/small gang hunter perspective. 
---
1. Alliances leave dreads docked until  less than a min before jump in, local count helps give a rough estimate of dread numbers and possible reserve fleets. 
---
2. Alliances operate more than 1 fleet and jump them into different systems without local it becomes impossible to roughly estimate fleet strength or nearby batphones. 
---
3. Alliances do take into consideration local numbers constantly when making decisions to attack or not as it gives indications of form ups.
---
Alright, sounds like your corp sucked if they weren't funding newbros and were just throwing you away as suicide tackle. Cripes.
---
First off, there are people actually interested in helping. DREDDIT IS RECRUITING, and we treat our newbros right with free ships, plenty of isk making opportunities, and content every night. I run a lot of our USTZ corp fleets myself, and there's usually bigger alliance shit going on too.
---
As for solo, if you're looking for trouble my recommendations are:
---
* Join a militia as a solo player and make isk plexing/missioning while fighting in the warzone
---
* Hunt clone soldiers and mordu's rats in lowsec while committing heinous acts of piracy
---
* Become a wormhole / npc nullsec nomad explorer and make isk running sigs
---
Don't:
---
* Become a hisec mining bot
---
Who wants to do that?  Sit and stare waiting for gate fire... “oh another blue... oh another blue... yawn... what’s on Netflix....”
---
“Who the fuck is watching the OH-IC12 gate??  There’s 50 vedmak back here?””
---
i have you tagged as "an absolute piece of shit"
---
i just wanted you to know that :)
---
Hard to argue against it when the vast majority of posters are either lazy pvpers who like cloaking as is, or mega alliance kids that aren't bothered by ye old cloaker boi. 
---
For everyone else, it's hell.
---
either way, subcap ratting isnt going to disappear.
---
This is what most people who are enthusiastic about no local don't understand. They assume that everyone will go about their business as if nothing changed, and they will have a smorgasbord of unaware krabs to slaughter. Unfortunately, humans have a pesky pattern recognition ability.
---
KarmaFleet is recruiting
---
Literally don’t care
---
He was the CEO of Waffles back when I first joined PanFam in 2010-2011. Grath Telkin describes him as "mean and terrifying," which tells you that he doesn't fuck around. Dude used to kick people from Waffles for the tiniest mistakes
---
Looking for a specific target. Also the ability to study the target and it actions and possibly weakness without the target knowing anything there.
---
And excuse me but what's wrong with it ? You don't see wormholers whining because there can be cloaky shit at anytime anywhere.
---
So nothing bad
---
You mean faps?
---
Hence why I said "largely extinguished," rather than "completely extinguished."
---
Oh no, I see "Asp in front of things" has spread to r/eve. We must keep this contained.
---
That's because you can't covert cyno a functionally unlimited number of people on top of you in a WH.
---
The same people that will want to actively defend there space if they want to get the benefit from it.
---
I like the idea of wormholes but scanning down chains all the times bores me to tears.
---
I keep saying that the supposition of safety is what creates the content for roams/wh gangs.  And can forget about anything outside of direct jump range of the armada.  And even then they’ll only undock shit that can take a beating till help arrives.  Anything undocked will have to have a cyno on it without sacrificing any fitting.
---
Imagine using twitch emotes on reddit.
---
WeirdChamp
---
Chori, are the komodo blueprints not providing enough RMT money?
---
Soooo... Where's the risk to you when he's afk?
---
No one is going to do this.  Or if they do it’s under a forced requirement.  
---
All this change does is continue to fuck over small alliances.  These changes do not help null.
---
Right so raise its cost.  And at this point ANY amount of isk sink is good.
---
&gt; that's like 3 characters per player on average
---
I haven't actually been in a wormhole corp, but... why is that surprising? Main character, backup character and a scanner / cloaky eyes alone would easily bring it to three and i imagine that kind of usual for wormholers. If people do industry or have their characters handling logistics in corp too, that can inflate it even more.
---
Some people want the game to be dangerous and exciting again, meanwhile the PvErs want safer than hisec. :(
---
At least finding other roaming gangs might give an illusion that null has a pulse again for a short while.
---
Upvoted for being correct, and for the response to "jesus."  Made me chuckle this morning.
---
They're actually the least problematic - if they do nothing, then they are no threat to you.
---
errrr
---
it'll switch to myrms/domis/whatever else people feel like afk krabbing in. not die off completely.
---
thx for playing
---
You do know wormhole especially high class ones can let pretty large amount of covops cruisers through them ?
---
That gentleman has precise stats to support his claim.  He is clearly an authority on what 99% of the playerbase does and does not want to do.
---
Motherfucker, are you reading what I'm saying?
---
Small alliances who are all anyway a larger alliance pet ?
---
Why don't people live in C6 holes?
---
You goon mong.
---
If you read all redddit comment the fun fact is : Big alliance said don't do that you will kill little entity. And a lot of little entity said "yes we will have kill and sov who can't be defend"... And just don't think they will be the first to die. 
---
In fact a lot of people who want this changr want it but they don't understand consequence and so you have a whole rethorical story who form on reddit to said it will change that or that...And he will not change delve will stay safe, same for decklein or Esoteria and all other area under super cap umbrella.  And rest of 0.0 will become a wasteland. It's what will happen.  
---
So it's why he said people who want this change shitting on they're pant, beacause some start to understand they was happy for a change ... they make rethorical for hit ... but they start to understand it will not change game as they want.
---
Why should any system in null be "safe?"  Doesn't that entire concept go against what Eve is all about?  Even Highsec isn't safe once you undock.  
---
Quite frankly, looking at the MER and the PLEX/injector market more specifically, I think a little less crabbing would be good for the game.
---
Whoops, all the wandering holes are collapsed and the static is crit.
---
Woops all the gates are camped and the WH are rolled / titan camped as soon as they popped.
---
Why did you downvote me for making a completely obvious point, entailed in your comment?
---
Fucking idiot.
---
Covert cynos exist. Please stop pretending that they do not.
---
I haven't ratted in a while, but it kind of feels like wormhole ratting is safer anyway now. More payout, less random drifters showing up, and you can physically control what systems you're connected to for maximum safety
---
Right cause the big fleet fights which is what we do the shit we do for aren’t at all fun.  Maybe not for you, but for us... oh right everything in Eve has to fit exactly one fucking playstyle... yours.  
---
All this “carebare and krabbing” shit we take so much grief for is entirely 100% so we can wage the huge complex wars against the litany of enemies.  These huge ships requires vast amounts of minerals and long build queues.  Sub components requiring hundreds of inputs.  
---
You think we just want to sit in rorq because “that’s the game”.  No.  The game to us is waging the huge multiobjective wars covering vast regions.   That game requires resources.  Lots and lots of resources.
---
Null sec and wormhole space are probably the best parts of the game. You are so unrestrained. Lowsec is fun but fuck gate guns and all that shit. Look into pandemic horde. Get a good grasp of the game then look for somewhere else to go or move up in PH. 
---
Karma fleet is goons version of PH. 
---
Brave is booty don’t @ me.
---
They are important assets of every corporation big or small, regardless of how cheap they are now to build. They do not need to be nerfed because the huge alliances have stockpiled hundreds of them to pair with their fax blob. Nerfing the EHP and DD power of supers/titans, only hurts the smaller groups who have to be more frugal with their usage.
---
Plus, when was the last time there was a real Titan v Titan fight? No one ever escalates to dropping a titan fleet OR better yet, counter drops a titan fleet with titans which is why you see them only dying when they are moving or ratting. 
---
It circles back to the issue of conflict drivers needed to bring meaningful content to the PVP playerbase.
---
I would have stuck it on a new T2 ship, unfortunately unless you want to use a frigate hull I think everything else has a T2 variant already.
---
Maybe change one of the Command Ships to be said stealthy variant.
---
No, we are sighing because it's unlikely we will get a decent PvP fight out of it, not with Goons, Horde, and TEST all wanting the TTT to be a success.
---
Either the enemy will be a no-show or using some bullshit doctrine that's designed to annoy and not actually hinder.
---
Maybe we'll get a turkey shoot out of it though which would be nice but also not 'decent' PvP and something we get on a regular basis from FRT without having to travel to Perimeter.
---
So yeah. *Sigh*
---
This is ignorant as fuck.  Since when did any fucking cyno, let alont a blops cyno, work in a fucking wh
---
Moreover... the lack of intel is what makes wh attractive to that playerbase.
---
The two main problems in NS imo are super umbrellas that can cyno in within minutes if not seconds  and the fact that alliances can stack 30k people in a single region without drastically decrease the quantity of available ressources. Removing local will only push people to stack even more, small groups will go closer to super umbrellas or will get farmed. In the end there will be less people to kill outside these large blocks, roaming in those regions is really boring since people drop 84238434 faxes/SC/titans on every roaming gang they can find. 
---
But hey, since it's an event, i don't think CCP will permanently remove local anyway. It's probably an introduction to new upwell structures like the observatories that were once discussed (i don't remember the source tbh).
---
Intel channels rely on individuals reporting when a hostile appears in local.  Now with the blackout going to happen, the only people reporting hostiles are the people getting dropped on, or physically sitting on a gate cloaked, reporting when they see hostiles jumping in/out.  This again only favors Super ratting or Rorqual mining under a supercap umbrella, as those are the only things able to last long enough for help to arrive.
---
It's not really that simple, though. character != account. Characters can be moved between accounts. Someone who typed something two years ago on a character isn't necessarily the same person typing something on that character today. CCP can figure that out since i'm sure they log all transfers / account to character links, but that is a separate thing from logging chat.
---
well yeah but youre not making any sense. first you say subcap ratting is going to be "largely extinguished" then i say "no its not, people will switch to a different ship" then you said "no that ships no good they will switch to this other subcap" and im like "right yep and so it will continue just with a different ship" and you're all like "asfjla29fjalvlanv.a9wfja.os.fjafhaisha i dont get the last word ashdiah28djasjdai" and now we're here.

Here's why you should come to wormholes.
---
https://kryptedgaming.com/eve-online-wormholes/why-wormholes/
---
Can you not pretend every WH of every WH system is critic or collapsed ?
---
PING CTA PING STRATOP PING CTA . PING PING PING 
---
+ globally the toxic players and drama queen, and the same mindless tasks over and over again that will grind your soul to dust. Stay away from ratting. Stay away.
---
The entire Bee Movie script, except every instance of the word bee is replaced with Corporation friendly-fire is now a legal act
---
It's not as safe as contemporary nullsec, but after the change, you'll have a much higher degree of control. After all, covert cynos don't work in WHs, and while a hostile group can certainly log off in side, if it's your home hole, you can bank up a number of capital ships far in excess of what can be stuffed through the hole.
---
Yeah, we dont claim him as one of ours - pretty much everyone I know in NC is hyped for this aside from maybe one or two turbo-krabs
---
When can we expect this war to happen?
---
They said the Titanic was too big to sink. Then it took an iceberg to the face and sank, killing hundreds of millions of people and taking Jack to the bottom of the sea and leaving Rose crying on the surface of the ocean. What makes you so sure Vily won't do the same.
---
Active corporations share the load.. it's hardly noticable.
---
Same people that are sat on the keepstar with a titan and a fax?
---
It will be quite curtailed.  Maybe not right away and maybe in very specific areas at times when you know you’ll get a save.   Gone will be stumbling upon a domi in a pipe system.
---
I mentioned this yesterday in discord. If you have watched his videos, you know he can be on top of your excavators within 30 seconds of jumping in system. With no local, he'll be on your drones literally as a dscan shows him arriving if you are spamming it your entire play session. Short of placing 100 bubbles around where you are mining, this will single handedly be the largest possible buff to his play style and could result in either him stealing 1000 in a month or people just stopping using excavators altogether in delve.
---
Nice move Volta
---
Why can't I? Players routinely collapse/crit holes so they can krab safely. Why wouldn't you? It's just common sense.
---
Hmm, I guess in every normal school, unlike you it seems ... Is that vulcanian math you are rolling with ?
---
Blops cloak has always been kinda lame because while it would be overpowered to warp cloaked, it forces you to appear on dscan any time you need to reposition. I feel like Blops should at least be dscan immune, or should disappear from local while cloaked.
---
each race has a battlecruiser and battleship hull without a T2 variant
---
ZKill API is fairly easy to use
---
Nice recruitment pitch, gj!
---
For your next trick, could you try and hold sov without running to a WH ?
---
Null sec can be difficult to get into, some groups can be rigid in wanting higher sp pilots. Talk to a couple different groups. Try to find a place where there is a lot of fighting. The more fights, the more fun.
---
*"Things in the 'verse have been better"* the captain mused to himself as he waited for another status update.     *"Triglavians attacking the high security zones, Drifters attacking the nul-sec alliances, and the empires still not willing to stop shooting at one another long enough to talk."*   He sighed,  as he watched a scope report about the latest happenings and goings on, impatiently tapping his fingers on the armrest of his command chair.
---
*"Status Update Cap'n"* A gruff voice in the tactical officers station announced loudly. *"Jacks and his crew are in place and are ready to strike,   Kayla and her team are about ready to cut power to the facility, she says another 5 minutes and she'll be ready ta execute on your orders"* 
---
The captain nodded his receipt of the information and went back to the news reel as new reports of fuel shortages and disturbing new tech being discovered were reported as casually and in the same cold manner as the Jita traffic reports.     
---
He smiled to himself,  knowing what they were working to pull off would most likely never make it to the news reels. If anyone did detect his Moa they would see the Gila style paint job , complete with the Gurestas rabbit ears and assume this to be a pirate operation,  which in a sense it was but not for the long eared bastards.  
---
Yep.. things in the 'verse have been better....  but there is still plenty of room for dishonest men to make a living 
---
*"Kayla reports ready Cap'n,    on your order"*  the Tactical officer replied
---
*"Make it happen"*  the captain replied.
---
And with that, a button was pressed,  a top secret research lab was thrown into chaos, and the lives of trillions, both capsuleer and non capsuleer alike, were soon about to change forever.
---
Test vs frat.  Been a hot war since March. Are you that out of touch?  Maybe you should refrain from posting?
---
Yeah you can crit static’s and roll dynamics all you want, it still won’t stop the rage rolling fleet looking for content.  Your only protection is D-Scan and Probes
---
If you're incapable of understanding that the remaining options are trash ISK/hr and that prey migration to safer/more lucrative options will occur, sure, this tomfoolery might make sense. The main thing to understand is *most people don't like to lose ships at all.*
---
Yeah nothing to do with the dynamics of holes changing all the time. Surely no local is the one most important things of WH.
---
On one hand yes.
---
On the other hand, the constant range checks would not be fun if you get some fleet-on-fleet action...
---
You make it sound like a cake walk, but I surmise it will be a lot harder to find 40 or 50 willing volunteers to sit on all/most/half/some of the gates of a region all day long.
---
Almost all of it
---
Well the local thing isnt going to be an issue soon
---
Wh people are so biased anyways.
---
I don't see how volta can possibly provide a similar level of stability. Sure, the tax is lower than the other trade ports but this entire idea seems predicated on "sticking it to the man" which is certainly fun to do, but a trader wants a long term plan. Whats stopping volta from raising taxes later on? How are they going to defend the armor timer? This appeals less to actual traders and industrialists and more to people looking for something to shoot.
---
Trading is more involved than the broker fees you see on the screen. Still, theres nothing wrong with volta looking for content.
---
What you really said:
---
&gt; JUST STAY IN SPACE WHILE I COME SHOOT YOU AND LIKE IT.
---
nah i get wat ur trying to say and im disagreeing with ya
---
time will tell which one of us are right.
---
LOL.  where did you!?!?
---
EVE Uni is where you get your space wings, cadet  
---
TEST are dinos, they are slow and don't have a space program, always puzzled by asteroids  
---
Goons are bees, they have a hivemind structure and swarm into the system in large numbers  
---
P I R A T are highsec gankers, they probably drink rum
---
Ever growing coalitions didn't happen because of ccp making changes. Things becoming more and more blue in null was an ongoing process before rorq changes and everything else you're trying to blame.
---
&gt; small groups will go closer to super umbrellas or will get farmed
---
Yes because those small alliances could dock up and get fucked when local is here and someone bigger than them want to hunt them, much better ! So much difference.
---
Small independant alliances in NS basically don't exist, most small alliances even if they blue everything around them will get trashed by competent people, local or not.
---
The catch is that you can't just do a trip to Jita in null and there is no concord to avenge you.
---
Should you move there? That question you have to answer yourself, there are a couple newbie friendly corps in the big alliances that take new pilots if you want to find out.
---
If you don't like it, come back to highsec :)
---
great, how do i join war with my alt corp?
---
So you're saying there's a load of new nullsec systems up for grabs? Sounds like a win to me.
---
It varies but that's a lot of it. We get lots of small gang fighting so it's fun, if it wasn't I'd fuck off lol.
---
In fact they do'nt understand null is already dangerous.
---
You have cyno, you have full intel when you go to a system before arrive in it. 
---
So people to coutnerbalance this decide to make effort and regroup. But null is dangerous, people spend a lot of time and effort to make they're space safer. A lot of small/medium alliance just don't understand that. 
---
The best thing to understand that it to said : Ok if null is not dangerous, why all little entity don't come in 0.0 to make money ?  ANSWER : 0.0 is dangerous.
---
Could this little entity survive in a WH : of course WH are less dangerous by define (no intel, random spawn of entrance, so you don't have an exact pattern to roam inside everyday). For me the only error beetween WH and NS is the asset safety. Must work if bulding is alive (and not Reinforced), but if bulding explode he must loot.
---
Yes because actively defending your space so you get all the benefit from it isn't going to be a thing because people have become lazy.
---
Which will be deserved.
---
haha ok bro.  Whatever you say.
---
What to expect when planning to bring at least 4:1 (because you need to)
---
lol good luck
---
Yes and people rolling isn't a thing too.
---
Lol no - those people will still only want to sit in their Titan.  They won’t risk being cut off from the chance to drop it and if 100 blops drop between them and their precious baby they’ll cry themselves to sleep for a week.  
---
I get what you’re saying that the gates can be camped and maybe some will but others won’t.  And it honestly only takes losing one domi under the belief someone was eyes in the pipe before people make a different TiS reward calculus.
---
TIL: reducing the hyperinflation is "killing the whole market"
---
Are the drifters back this week?
---
&gt; Why should any system in null be "safe?"
---
Reading comprehension F.  Did I say it should be?  No.  I said the number of targets is going to drop precipitately.  That is to say, the number of players using it for PvE is going to fall and fall quite fast.
---
What is wrong with you fucking smoothbrains anyway?  People not wanting to feed for a pathetic reward is a very simple concept that's apparently impossible to get your head around on r/eve.  
---
You're all masturbating your elbows into early joint replacement clinical trials over the l33t PvP environment this is going to create when the reality is it'll mostly be PvP and player desert between powerful umbrellas, as it is now, except you'll have far fewer targets to hit.  The low hanging fruit will be gone.

That's why you crit it, so it becomes a one-way trip for anyone who would aggrieve you.
---
How is it that **I** am the one informing basic WH mechanics here?
---
Because TEST will blue the iceberg
---
Give a pocket to a corp, have them gate camp / watch the 1/2 entry gates. Have corps and alliance defense fleet that chase large group. Rat with ships that can chase solo fast ships instead of running the most optimized fit for PvE.
---
Is it more complicated ? Yes. That's the fucking goal. Actively live in the space you own.
---
doesn't matter, moving plex is 100% safe with plex vault
---
have plex in keepstar, move to vault, go to their citadel and sell
---
Its how all the horde citadels cut into their profit and it will be how Volta cuts into their profit

Right but we don't know that Blackout will survive in any form beyond the few weeks it's active

You offer ally help to the corp mentioned in the OP

“ZoMg My PrEcIoUs FaKe InTeRnEt PoInTz....”

Because your point is retarded like you and this is /r/eve... here have another.
---
Looks to be that way... sometime in the next week (my guess, Sun/Mon) CCP will drop a 48hr notice that Null Local will be "delayed".
---
Stick the titan on the gate... still in jump range, and you can boson gates at the same time!
---
imagine being this spodbrain, he said he would keep his promise AFTER the agreement was signed.

Pst, it was Lazerhawks! go get em ROFLMAO

In my experience over the years, I've found that only PvP'ers adapt to changes well/quickly.  Meta changes faster than PvE meta does.

Shifting to barges with a rorq for boosts is a perfectly legit counter if you don't want to risk the excavators.

Because they’re trying to paint us into a corner as being the retards.  And they’re Wormholers btw so they have some lack of oxygen to the brain happening.

*Never trust anyone you can't easily punch.
---
Your entire post talked about your old system in Provibloc to determine if a system was "safe" to use. Then you described your belief that there will no longer be "safe" null systems so PVE will go down.  
---
The entire context for your post was that decreased safety in null would result in less PVE, or PVE in cheaper ships, as if that were a bad thing.  
---
Aside from coming across as a salty little carebear fuck, you're also either a terrible writer, in that you didn't mean to convey the message that you did (and that I responded to), or you're a complete fucking idiot who can't comprehend his own post minutes after writing it.  Either way, your post is wrong, and you should go back to your little krab fantasy land.  
---
I'll be over here hunting your scared little ass.  Wormholer, btw.
---
Look at the MER. In places like delve, people very obviously already are living in the space...
---
Its only one gameplay style allowed according to a wormhole btw... theirs... the rest of eve are nothing but carebare pussies if they don’t want (they say can’t cause we’re window licking retarded) to live in wh.
---
I would say no not before you have a solid plan. But if you do have one then depending on what it is it might be better to pursue it in null low wh or hisec.
---
And how often does this happen in home holes?
---
To get plat insurance u need a citadel... then you have to deal with having built a citadel :D
---
I think you mean 1.66x my friend.
---
an absolute, total, 100% newbie? no.  
---
imo you have to learn some basics. do the tutorial, carriere agents, some light pve, some belts, some Lv1-2 combat mission in freg-destro, maybe the SoE epic arc.  
---
in cheap ship you just risk (almost) nothing in HS, you can do lots of mistakes and learns the very basics pretty safely.  
---
Use the HS to learn the basic Pve, the 0.0 will teach you the PvP
---
Then do that
---
And that’s your game.  I don’t shit all over your game.  I’m glad you enjoy it.  I enjoy null.  I enjoy the big multi objective wars covering vast regions.  That’s my game.  Don’t shit on my game please
---
I do enjoy wormholers fancying into our system for a go.  We beat you back but not after good fun is had by all.  You guys get some kills we get some kills.  It’s good.  
---
But you’re saying it’s your playstyle &gt; all others. And that’s the problem.
---
The Drifters will enjoy your moa
---
What they are looking to achieve is content, and get paid for it, it's a good plan. I don't think anyone really gives a shit about Hisec or Vily's promises.
---
Did you set the switch to "More Magic"?
---
No it doesn't only hurt smaller groups obviously it hurts the groups that rely on them the most. Smaller groups almost never rely on ehp, they rely on not getting caught in the first place because if they get caught no amount of ehp is going to protect them from the larger group.
---
Titan v. Titan fight? proves my point no one will engage these in a fleet situation without their own titans. The latest war demonstrated the fallacy of even that argument as now one group dominates with their numbers and the offered solution is to pve multibox rorquals on a mass scale for a year? 
---
There are now thousands of these in the game and only being able to kill the retards no longer is cutting it.
---
Never forget that time that P I R A T wardecced The Culture, then docked up when a squad of Culture Ravens (iirc) showed up in Amarr
---
If a cov ops cyno lights on a super and the super dies, it deserved it for not warping away from the ship lighting the covert ops cyno. Period. Super ratting will still be invulnerable isk printing as long as you are aligned, have an emergency exit cyno, or have eyes in the next door systems. Or any combination of the above. We will just see less subcaps ratting now once they lose a few ships if it takes that long.
---
The only thing that can catch a super is a bubbler, and you'll see it coming long before it's too late. 
---
We should be expecting a lot less elite gank pvp and larger blue balls

Dude you can’t even get them to mine ochre first... what makes you think gate duty is going to be accepted?
---
You’re ignorant as fuck.  Probably don’t even live in null or play the game.
---
I'd just use the following ESI endpoints to check that:
---
/characters/{id}/location
---
/characters/{id}/online
---
Thank you, your Space Bushido completed my /r/Eve Bingo card.
---
This is actually a great idea.
---
The only people complaining are the same people whose idiocy and cheese tactics are ruining the game in the first place.
---
You realise that only around 1500 people died when the titanic went down right?
---
He most likely isn’t even playing the game yet somehow wants to dictate gameplay on people.
---
If your system can handle Proton in Steam you can play it through Steam easy-peasy...
---
You don't get my point, whether people get Killed or not won't matter. They'll stack for the same reason that make cloaky campers effective : fear. Now you're complaining about people docking up cause of local, ok fine, but there are still people in those systems. After a few weeks of getting farmed there will be no one, they'll all join Big blocks. 
---
Don't misunderstand me, i'm pretty much for everything that Can make Space more dangerous and roamable, i was really positive about those changes at first but think about it : Golden Era of small gang was around 2012-2014 i think, there was already a local chat back then, don't you think CCP is missing the point with the remove local thingy?
---
"I mine and build the ships therefore danger should not apply to me".
---
lol you guys are more spooked by olmeca than goons ever were by stunt, samatra et al. "guy who goes to incredible effort and lengths is able to harm me, so i can't afk wah"
---
Yes. When I joined I spent about a week in high sec doing the Sisters of Eve mission arc and then moved straight into null to fight in WWB. It was awesome. 
---
Yes, getting into null can be a rocky transition, but you'll be fine. Join a decent nullsec corp and dive in.
---
Easiest way now is if your system can run Proton under Steam.
---
You guys? I haven't used excavators in 4 months, haven't mined in delve in 2 years and I've never been in the same system as him. But /narrative
---
10 closely knit people active 12/7, sounds like ideal wormhole corp.  You'll probably be able to start living in a low class (c1/2/3) one after a week or two and see where things take you.
---
Or roam together in frigs, they are very replacable and fun.
---
Yeah, null sec is not W space. The main difference being, of course, cynos and being able to jump capitals, Titans, and supers by the hundreds into systems. Then, of course, there are covert cynos and being able to jump infinite bombers into null sec systems. 
---
Given that, I think it is probably a *really bad idea* to remove the ability of locator agents to find people in space--back in the day this was used a lot to try and figure out where the enemy fleet was. So, while I am willing to give no local in null sec a go without complaining until I get a feel for how it impacts the game, I am firmly against removing *all* ability for null sec alliances to figure out where the 1000 strong hostile capital fleet is. 
---
AND... if we are going to do this no local thing, I do agree that it should be done right. It should drop in *all* of null, including NPC null. In addition, it should be put on a delay, the length of which based on the sec status of the system, for low sec too. Basically, the only place that should have local, and thus near perfect intel, is high sec.
---
Thats a lot of krabbing for a 1 day acc.
---
You just need to check some pocket entry gates, not every single ones...
---
How does one warp away when they’re pointed?  
---
Because the blops ships will be right on top of you pointing you.  Not “in local”...  on your grid.  Pointed.   Toast.  You just gotta pray your dudes sitting on the keepstar are locked n loaded cause then the blops lights his cyno, you have 5 seconds and 100 fuckers are on you.
---
Great so nothing will change for them. Or maybe "living" and "ratting/mining" are 2 different things.
---
&gt; But if you think there's going to be a game of cat and mouse over the reward of a forsaken hub or a rock of spod, I'm afraid you're going to be sadly disillusioned.
---
Hi!  Have you heard of EVE Online?  You should check the game out...
---
Yes because most wormholers rat in there home holes ...
---
You can tell who's never lived under pimple farmers oppressive blops hammer.
---
Right, because people like me with many many prospects don't exist and will just covert cyno fleets past a single choke point.
---
The corp I'm in is dead, so I am trying to join a new one, but I get **[this](https://i.imgur.com/y4LOEJl.png)** when I try to join a new corp. So what's the deal - does the (AWOL) leader of my current corp have to come online and demote me, before I can join another corp?
---
Not by yourself.  But if you get into a group that controls some space. And is willing to help you get setup and started . You can quickly with low sp get into something in a week or so that would let you start doing some of the nullsec sites that offer 500k-1mil bounties on the BS sized rats in there plus whatever drops from loot. It might also give you access and permission to explore in certain areas without people aligned to the owners of that space coming at you. Exploration is not consistent , and you have to get the loot safely home/ shipped or run to highsec trading hubs before you get an actual payout whereas bounties are instant. but when it pays out it can pay out extremely well. 
---
Its just like anything more risk / more reward . 
---
Some fun things you can do solo that offer more money than level 1-2 mission running / mining without too much SP Investment etc are :
---
Faction warfare: requires you to run down sites for LP . Know how to use loyalty points (LP) to buy items and then sell those items for good isk per LP (you should be aiming for 1 mil isk for 1000LP) this is market dependent and takes a little knowhow to get the best return on your LP . Technically you can make 50mil / hour in a frigate, but it will be usually less than this and sometimes people will hunt you in sites and interrupt this cashflow. 
---
Dipping into wormholes for exploration. You go from high sec , find a low tier wormhole that leads into wormhole and not standard space i.e  “c1 or c2” and look for pirate faction  sites (not drifter sites) . These sites are identical to nullsec sites and can have 150mil-1bil + in the cans , and you should have all you wormhole entrance/exits back to high sec bookmarked so you don’t have to run a gate-camp gauntlet from regular null. Chance for big payout, the. Again chance at getting nothing at all / blown up. 
---
Also can dip into wormholes to look for gas sites. These take some practice as you only have a set time before enemies spawn and you have to gtfo before that but can turn a tidy profit . 
---
Market trading : going to need a small chunk of isk to get you started , but basically you just have to sit in station , put up buy orders , put up sell orders for what youve just bought at a higher price and make a sale . Probably boring for a lot of people though you can update your orders as little as once a day, just things will take longer to sell then sometimes as youll be getting quickly undercut by active traders .
---
You warp away in a super because you have 30 warp core strength naturally if you arent a turd using a super without carrier 5 and are aligned out.
---
The fact it useless for 99% of players, 99% of the time, does not have anything to do with someone's creativity. But yeah, you may think you're very creative one, when you're waiting for some idiot on VNI who even didn't hear of MSI, sitting on your 1bil. BB under MSI, in the belt or any other freely accessible location. But hey, here is a bright example of such "creative" persons, who met "not so much idiots" who know how to use their Combat probes, or at least their ships!  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30003069/201907052300/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003069/201907052300/)
---
I guess when they roll their static for farm that they just leave all the other wandering holes open and the destination hole's static non-crit, too.
---
Can’t wait to hear that one.  “Ok jimmy take your Titan out to the IMA-FUKED gate n wait for content.”   
---
Yup that’ll happen.
---
This. 
---
Seriously, if they weren't so expensive they would be fantastic for WH use. What's inside, a dank ratting fleet ready to die or an absolute ball of pre-bubbled "fuck you"? Only one way to find out!
---
Best part is how the Hisec pubbies suddenly feel their opinion matters whenever someone comes in PM for isk/content.
---
First, Horde/ICY came to fight against unstable market, brought stability. Pubbies thought it was for them, no, they came for isk.
---
Then came TEST, promised stability and even lower prices, pubbies rejoice, but they really just came for that free ISK horde was making. 
---
Now comes VOLTA, pubbies rejoice again, but they're really here for content and isk is bonus.
---
So people need to understand no one gives two shits about the Hisec pubbies. 
---
"Oh! b-but Vily promised", well then, HTFU and adapt or die.

Corporation ftiendly-fire is now a legal act
---
Don't message me.
---
That’s the stock answer to the “null is too safe” crowd.  We don’t live there.  Yup and the ADMs magically raise themselves too.
---
ok, so, i'm gonna ask you to, in the nicest way possible
---
sit down and shut the fuck up, please, because legitimately do not care :)
---
&gt; to determine if a system was "safe" to use
---
It was a method to reduce the probability of getting hotdropped and it mostly worked.  Is feeding the shit you just spent the last two hours of your life earning somehow exciting emergent gameplay?  Of course it fucking isn't.  Players mitigate the risks.
---
&gt; I'll be over here hunting your scared little ass
---
I mostly just sit in the umbrella these days, dropping on little twats from WH like you, so I think that's a bit unlikely.
---
&gt;  Wormholer, btw.
---
Obviously.  Nobody else would be so fucking sanctimonious and so detached from how nullsec actually works.
---
If you want to live in NS and be safe you put on the effort your you suffer the consequences. That's should be the way for NS and removing local goes that way.
---
Oh and I've lived in NS and roamed it until like 3 months ago just to answer your ad hominem attacks.
---
&gt;*complains about defenders being lazy*  
---
&gt;*advocates for a change that lowers the overall bar of entry for pvp skill and promotes pvp that requires less effort than afk ratting*
---
summary
---
48 seems accessive. 4-6 hours seems far more reasonable.
---
What is your major malfunction?
---
Why rorqual mine if you’re not using excavators?  should only mine in an orca....Why risk subcaps if I can’t PANIC... fuck it... ima harpy today.
---
You know a thing or two about freighter insurance, though.
---
I believe we are adapting :)  
---
*Perimeter - 0.1% Raise the tax, get the axe* is up and running for your trading needs!
---
Your inability to think creatively or tactically doesn't make them useless.
---
If ratting and mining isn't living then I honestly don't know what the fuck you people want, especially after asking for all this farms and fields bullshit
---
Maybe I'm mistaken, but can't you rat with a cleverly-fit stealth bomber?
---
Or am I mixing that up with belt ratting (been a while since I've done either, but most recent was super-ratting)
---
Okay, let's assume you're a competent group of pilots and want to shit on a small independant (or even not) alliances. What would you do with local ? Roam their space, catch their ships, force them to dock up because they can't face you. After a few weeks they would just collaps, players leaving and so on.
---
What's the big difference without local ? Maybe a few more ships dying but that would be all. Small alliance will always get shit on. That's how Eve works.
---
Disregard null, go to WH. 
---
Spoopy Newbies would love you. And we would love to shoot you.
---
need a ladder?
---
you can rat in anything you want
---
Me too! Send all inquiries to me.
---
This is so funny, I love how people think that cloaky camping goes away just because local is in "optional" mode.  I can literally say Hi once an hour on all of my cloaky camping alts, and guess what happens? SUDDENLY my red -10 standing character to your alliance/corporation is staring at you in local... until you literally leave the system.
---
&gt; promotes pvp that requires less effort than afk ratting
---
You’re pretty fucking stupid to draw that line like that.  
---
Danger applies to me now - as is.  Without altering the playing field.  
---
Altering the playing field changes the risk reward calculus further.

tbh i have no idea how this vni nerf is going to mix with the no local thing. will be interesting to see what will happen. after all, 4 years ago nobody was going to bring a rorqual into a belt and siege it because fuck that, thats dumb, etc. etc....and here we are today.
---
I think you went too deep into the rabbit hole here.
---
Yeah, that's fair. 48 hours seems way too generous. It was a number I just latched onto when I first thought about it because of the mobile bubble timers and MTUs.
---
But yeah just a couple of hours would be more than enough.
---
&gt;If you want stability use NPC stations.
---
Why?  Its not like you can kill the TTT.
---
With the consortium of powers backing it there is literally no way that it dies.
---
If you have a covert cyno with a cloaky ship, if the first guy can't see it the others won't either, so it doesn't change anything?
---
that's literally what he just said / is saying holy shit r/eve needs to implement a literacy test prior to being able to post
---
You just post something, anything, in local once an hour.
---
I mean, that's technically correct... 
---
I'm also thinking that MJD Armageddons &amp; Ravens could make good subcap ratting boats for Havens (but you'd have to actively fly the ship)
---
I wonder if people will actually come to ref it when the order goes out. I'm not showin up.
---
Defending without a cyno, actually have defense ships somewhere else than the regional staging, defend big gates and use intel channel rather than just warp way when local shows red.
---
thanks for your valuable input big bill tha boss, i think u should make a thread about it
---
Well we could use a happy bunny to counterbalance the rage bunny in Dreddit.
---
Defeats gate camps on a single gate.
---
I just wanted to drop a "No", but OP actually makes sense. It's also a good way of regulating faming and 'encouraging'  more rotation.
---
Yup - he wants to play an away game and have a homefield advantage.
---
So retarded
---
too late, lmao.
---
welp looks like we have a server reset fellas
---
I've lived in null, and in a pocket that was perma-camped.  You know what I did?  Ignored it because I was in a standing fleet and my alliance liked PvP.  I got dropped a couple times.  Never bothered me.  Sometimes I baited the dude successfully.  Other times, I just ratted away and made isk.  Either way, I won.
---
It should he possible to bring in an Astrahus, is it not?
---
I’d go a step further and require an active alpha account too but woah fuck me right
---
You mean you aren't looking forward to bashing structures in hisec with your new bad ass alpha clone? How can you be so ungrateful for the content provided to you? Monstrous.
---
Warping out when local goes red is using Intel channels...
---
Ever seen an inner hell gang in delve? The response is a subcap fleet ping.
---
\&gt;Every single nullsec coalition circle jerks and protects it together  
---
\&gt;Jeez man we just want a good fight
---
Risk averse carebears don't want to lose shit.  Real men hulltank, and real men fight back.  It's clear what you are.  Enjoy your blue donut krab.
---
CCP said the same about selling skill points. Not convinced Falcon ;)
---
I've only lived in low-class holes, but my guess is a combination of :effort: combined with j-space being dead as hell.
---
You get far easier access to content with a C2 that runs a C5/Null static set.
---
I agree with your last point.  There will be supers tackled and killed get the blops gangs.  Maybe they’ll be “turds” and won’t have carrier 5 trained or maybe a bit slow to recognize what’s happening but... yeah.
---
&gt; Warping out when local goes red is using Intel channels...
---
Great so no local is not an issue then.
---
&gt; Ever seen an inner hell gang in delve? The response is a subcap fleet ping.
---
Great.
---
it's not time yet, but fear not
---
&gt;I wish I had just stayed in wormholes but HK was kinda getting boring once Ayeson and debes left.(not throwing shade at noobman, we didn't interact much).
---
Space AIDS, otherwise known as Jump Cancer, is not nearly as bad as it used to be. It is still a stupid pain in the ass, but hey. 
---
I mean, I would have just put a static jump timer on jumps to slow down movement, but hey... totally fucking people's ability to move their capitals around at all--at least when JF was first implemented--is an excellent example of CCPs genius game design choices over the past decade.
---
I've been playing Eve on and off since beta, thanks for asking.
---
what? are you referring to that dlc pack?
---
Most of Highsec did not even adapt to a Keepstar being there and continued to use Jita 4-4?
---
It must be.  
---
Also all those structures churning out ships with the same Corp tickers as ours don’t mean shit either.
---
Pretty sure V0lta was part of Skill Urself before they left in the spring of 2019 - who held the most systems in the game while not needing to have 140k pilots blue.
---
Have you already reported him?
---
Where do you think people get info from to populate Intel channels? A mystic fucking ball?
---
Bring something to delve that requires the response you desire, then?
---
And daily alpha injectors
---
I’m the one with ad hominem?  You’re the one with presumptive opinions here.  Good lord.
---
Blops cynos leapfrog the chokes.  
---
Now what Sherlock
---
Oh man i joined PPD just in time!
---
No poors lmao
---
Beware of Nado Mia.
---
Too busy shooting frat / shooting squids / shooting plexing bots / shooting horde / something something with your mom.
---
I imagine the price will go up too if it was buffed. So even still it may not be usable. I suppose it relies on market saturation at that point.
---
Come north wally
---
Did you see Rose's face when Jack's cold lifeless body drifted away from her, into the cold dark and freezing ocean? That to me was the death of a million people.
---
Do me a favor and don't push the "all of eve is against us" narrative this time though.
---
If you're fighting someone you're not really hiding your comp or numbers anymore
---
❤️ Volta love you guys in BB fleets!
---
You can do this one of two ways. Right click yourself in a chat window, select member details, and drop all roles and grantable roles. Then wait 24 hours to join a corp. Or you can immediately right click yourself, leave corporation, and you'll instantly leave your corp and be able to join another corp immediately.
---
Jesus, you and your 'nerf cynos so I can kill supers with my nano gang' is getting really old. In fact, I would argue, that this is totally incompatible with the rest of what you are saying:
---
"No local without enhanced reward is going to de-incentivize people krabbing, therefore in addition to no local we should also implement more counters to cynos and limit the amount of farming that can be done in a single region."
---
You do see why those two statements are incompatible, right? 
---
1. No local with no boosted reward is bad as it alters risk/reward ration; THERFORE
---
2. Lets implement things that make krabbing in null sec more dangerous and have less reward.
---
about 30 more systems need the NSH flag down in querious first
---
You're drunk on narrative aren't you?
---
sounds like null blocs have to actually put some thought into deploying super caps now, and considering well, no one considering the ramifications of citadels allowing docked supers...   
---
a lot of supers need to die already....
---
For somebody who buys a ton of isk that's a pretty crazy statement to make.
---
Which T1 ships have the best staying power in PvP? Thinking larger ships that are good for solo
---
This dude gets it
---
The difference is the sense of safety, with local small alliances can still feel "safe" cause they know what's coming their way. Without it, they'll rely on scouts which they won't be able to provide, After a while ans some dumb kills they'll be pissed and will join a big block to rat/mine safely under a super cap umbrella.
---
I do believe that will be a long term change, regarding removing local and nerfing cloaky camping.
---
DLC pack was fucked. Alpha injectors are really just a 1-day portioned subscription. It's more effective to just buy a sub than alpha injectors, and you can't do both.
---
They’re saying vni will be an awesome PvP ship again.  vOv
---
Eh those have their use and can only be used on alpha accounts
---
To let you in on the secret for free, none of us need isk. The moment this was posted several people offered to bank roll different defence doctrines that could be funny to fly.
---
u cant make 2b/hr in null? where are your 15 rorq alts or botted super ratters?  
---
\#nullpleb
---
&gt;I hope the roamers like roaming into supper dropping big alliance space, otherwise welcome to the wasteland. 
---
You obviously don't roam much, this is already the case.
---
I loved them.
---
This one is equally relevant  [https://www.deviantart.com/thekiller8/art/Eve-Online-You-want-it-28310268](https://www.deviantart.com/thekiller8/art/Eve-Online-You-want-it-28310268)
---
This is actually a badass idea
---
Then why are you so fucking obtuse?
---
And since you pulled your dick out, allow me to do the same:
---
Which beta? I was in both.
---
Looting script?!?! Please do tell more!
---
How does he steal the BPCs?
---
On the contrary. The solution to this change will just be drop all the supers on everything.
---
&gt; Risk averse carebears don't want to lose shit
---
Players doing PvE are risk averse and don't want to lose their shit, no.  That's why every group in nullsec has an intel system based on fucking local, which is what this entire discussion is about.  This is for some reason a surprise to you and many other people on r/eve.  I can only assume you're autistic and can't form mental models of how other people think and what their motivations are.
---
&gt; Real men hulltank
---
No they don't, not in nullsec.  They either light their cyno and get saved or they explode.  The attacker chooses when and where.  They very rarely fight their way out by themselves.  Again, you must be autistic or severely lacking in knowledge as you don't seem to understand this.
---
&gt; Enjoy your blue donut krab
---
I haven't done any PvE in Eve except a little PI for about six months, but I'm pretty sure you have in your little WH with the exits rolled, no chance of a blops drop or dreadbomb and a ping bot on your static.  I wonder, who's the risk averse krab here...
---
If you believe the propaganda of the cruise ship cartels.
---
It will be even more the case
---
An item will become cheaper as it becomes necessary and more manufacturers start making them. Probably barely used so no one rly makes them right now.
---
the new player systems. uitra and the like, you will get banned if you pick on new players there.  
---
each empire has one.
---
By far my favorite T1 cruiser.
---
Shaking up the box isn't a reset. Players just got too comfortable and Eve needs to stay current and evolve.
---
If you want to fly a ship where no one will know exactly how it works, then moa is good, because it’s bad and no one ever uses it, so you can get the element of surprise and might get underestimated
---
Yeah weird shit when things start to present tradeoffs again instead of being a straight upgrade. Almost like some semblance of balance is slowly returning to the game.
---
14 simultaneous  ? Good grief man !
---
True, but giving the large turret BC's covert abilities (without dropping them to mediums) feels a bit too OP, and a second covert battleship seems a bit much.
---
Plus it feels better as a role for an already fleet support/command ship.
---
Brags about living under the umbrella.  Talks shit to wormholer about how "safe" his space is.  Entirety of thread is his crying about how he wants null to be safer still otherwise PVE will suffer.  Because muh ticks!  What if I lose a ratting ship!  My isk per hour will be TRASHED!  CCPLEASE!  Don't make me PvP.  I don't want to! You can't force me to interact!  
---
At least that's all I've read from you and your friends.  Also, you're still wrong - real men do hulltank, because real men don't need no stinkin' cyno to win.  Get on my level Krab.
---
I think he has a pretty good point. I see a large increase coming of super and carrier ratting within large umbrellas. Rattlesnakes, vnis, domi, etc will increasingly  become a thing of the past the elite pvpers will be missing when they are dropped on by faxes/dreads/titans/supers. 
---
I wouldnt say extinguished just yet, but it's going to be reduced before it increases. 
---
The best part of all of this is I will be making money on the market as prices for everything begin to inflate due to supply and demand
---
&gt; Bring something to delve that requires the response you desire, then?
---
Oh, what I meant is that number is low for a wh corp. In my experience 3 is the low number that almost everyone has and most people have more.
---
i mean it is not the full ruleset, there are things that will get you banned if you do them in new player systems that wont other places in the game.  
---
Risk is eve, if a new player dies and leaves, then they were not cut out for eve in the first place.  
---
if you make a 100% safe place, there will be players that never leave that area regardless of minuscule income, and that sort of thing has 0 place in eve online.
---
Okay, so if I spend EUR 19.99 in addition to the omega sub, so I can get around 2B ISK on the market, fine. Years ago it was 300m for one PLEX (before the change). That was a lot of ISK back then.
---
If demand drops significantly, so will the price. This means less ISK for the PLEX.
---
Everything else will be more expensive (if this blackout lasts), which means you get even less for your RL moneys. This will have some suppliers of PLEX stop spending RL money. Me for example. I did it from time to time, nothing regular though.
---
Supply will be lower and the price will rise again, until it reaches the new supply/demand price.
---
It all depends on how much ISK people are willing to spend each month to keep omega status.
---
Since the "4 VNI multiboxing" stuff won't be as simple and safe any more, these won't have demand any more. Overall demand will drop and so will supply, because players won't be able to spend 2B per month forever, if the "free ISK for everyone" situation doesn't change.
---
Wherd's the flaw in this?
---
Become one of us, one of us! One of us!! ONE OF US!!!!! ONE OF US!!!!!
---
Who cares rest the server already
---
Kindof, enough people are operating out of the tower that they are making significant profits off it.
---
Then maybe they should fix freighters in general. Still what you said doesnt ring true, not every system will have a gank squad waiting to scan down a target.
---
so you mean they either find out the game isnt for them because its a PVP DRIVEN SANDBOX, or they figure out it is, and leave the noob system to create some content for themselves like a good eve player..  
---
we dont want to protect people who cant handle the game in its current state, this isnt wow, shits not handed to you except by other players, and anyone that cant create their own content will end up leaving because they are bored, or because they keep losing stuff due to lack of practicing said content
---
I assumed this was normal
---
/thread
---
Are you genuinely disappointed?  Maybe you’re the jaded snowflake here?
---
not true m8 i quit because CCP refused to stop the stagnation of nullsec, and the conglomeration of players into a few very large groups because of the idea of retaining players that are unable to be anything but shithead ping warriors and crabbers.  
---
i dont have fun killing plebs, its too easy, give me a good fight that doesnt involve cynoing 500 caps onto 4 guys and thinking that makes you good at this game.
---
jita 4-4 is on a quick downward spiral into a pile of shit it's gonna eat
---
Well, you could go the blackops route and actually don't give them full covert ops cloak, and drop them back to medium guns since they need the electronics for something else (and a bit more tank).
---
Maybe open them up for some more effect roles, like cyno inhib (weak phenomena)?
---
They're doing it for content...
---
You say that like instaceptors aren't a thing.
---
Not enough it seems ;)
---
because the amount of moving parts, setup and delay(for one fleet members in space has a delay of like 20-30 secs in the map) makes it useless when you can do it manually wih zero setup in ~10 seconds.
---
Iirc miner 2s still beat a hulk.
---
you get it, over 9000% you get it, this is not the game for people who need to be spoonfed content, and those are people people driving negative change in this game, and those are the people that caused CCP to take action in the form of drifters and no more local in null to shake up these groups of goldfish that can onyl do things when they are told, and crab up otherwise with 500000 rorq alts

|-|-|-|-|
---
Disagree with the locator agents thing and I don't have problems with dotlan having some data available like timers but I totally agree that Cynos, activity, and ratting metrics should be suppressed.
---
The system should remain fair to both sides. Hunters shouldn't have every advantage and hunted should definitely face increased in the fog of war.
---
I don't know, I'm getting it pretty mixed signals from Falcon on that one.
---
glad I could help, please recommend my services ...
---
What precisely are you arguing with me about?  Do you even know?
---
If you try to mine andnrat in it you'll be farmed constantly.
---
Truth.
---
remove the ability to dock at least titans once again and remove asset safety. you wont see as many being dropped i bet.
---
Not knowing when your counter drop is or isn't available to fuck him if he decides to go?
---
im kinda curious about the minds of bloc-posters, do you look through every thread for any opportunity to push your narrative or is it your actual thoughts?
---
Also, like my corp in test, we meet each other in real life and go to each other's weddings and shit. There is identity with in the null blocks in healthy corps.
---
It never stopped being an awesome pvp ship.
---
It's going to see a reduction if you think otherwise you are sadly mistaken. There will be more turtling up to the main power blocs for security of the blue donut umbrellas. The only things that can survive when caught are caps. 
---
I super rat with a full dualtank refit, active fax on standby, and two more alts in booshers keeping eyes next door on the in gates to the system I'm in and an emergency exit cyno sitting on a keepstar. 5 accounts in total, 4 screens, proper overview configs for each. All within a blue donut
---
Its a pretty fool proof system. I'm willing to bet pushing this type of setup is ccps real goal here.
---
Just 10 miner, 2 pvp-chars and 2 scouts... XP
---
50 whole days? Wow that’s almost two months!
---
You do all of that for a single super while still having a massive fleet to back you up? Jesus, fucking krabs man.
---
Good we can actually kill them now.
---
Do you like caps? Nullsec. No caps, whs.
---
PH disagrees. One jump out of the forge and low sec.
---
Null salt best salt
---
I would not have except a better answer haha !
---
No it’s goons not giving two shits about a CC.
---
Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand....
---
I don't care, I'm still free! You can't take the sky from me...
---
Bruh.
---
I’m stealing this
---
I like this subject, and i would hate that he just closes it that way. like "stfu kid, I don't give a shit about your ideas, we have ours." like we can't simply talk and imagine. I mean we're playing a space game, we are already dreaming about flying kilometers long Penis that can anihilate fleets, but can't imagine a few things those GMs can't deal with ?   
---
Bad community management for me. downvote Falcon.
---
bruh 😂😤💪😤🤙
---
Show up and tackle a ratter for a minute and then warp back off.
---
Thought you lot were moving.
---
Yup someone told me about !
---
Too bad you're not smart enough even to be able of using basic Market and ZKB statistics which would tell you that MSI is the most unpopular piece of deployable equipment. Even Mobile Micro Jump Unit is more popular, LMAO.
---
You're a very special one, arent' you? I like your additional chromosome, BTW.
---
CCP sold 1mil skillpoints for $5 about two weeks ago.
---
Just wait till the local blackout if you can’t find targets now!!
---
Just so.
---
why ever do that if you can use a mobile dscan inhib? blops are squishy, expensive and can fit the inhib easily on the cargo. Also if someone is jumping a blops the response fleet already knows whats attacking, otherwise they'd have no warp in anyway cause covert cyno. Just sounds kinda useless tbh, wouldn't break much but wouldn't add much either
---
I definitely agree that cloaky camping needs a nerf if local is going to go away for good. CCP has mentioned this as well.
---
lmao apparently yea only 8000 m3
---
Bashy bashy f1.
---
Which corp? Sounds like good people.
---
First, I do play this game actually. Secondly, not once did I state how people should play. I'm fine with people mining and ratting, it gives me content. Third, I suppose you missed the sarcasm in my post.
---
[EVE University ](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)  
---
They have by far the best wealth of knowledge for new/returning players.  Even some basic fits for PvP ships.   Also the word you were looking for is ‘Exploration’
---
Disappointing.
---
Corp Add:
---
If you apply you are 100% in we have no requirements. A member will message you and explain how to get to our home. They will then give you 10 ships for every time of fleets we run. We also give you all the skill books you need as a newbean. In PvP fleets we have care-takers that walk you through how to play the game. We also run 24/7 isk making fleet that have open socail comms. 
---
The catch, as a big alliance we need alliance bull shit done and those fleet can be boring.
---
And I thought Eve Online Community would be mature and logical... did we got too many wow players hemorrhaging into Eve? Why do we waste CCP's time with crap questions like this? Go play WOW Classic!!!!
---
&gt; Brags about living under the umbrella.
---
Most people in nullsec live under an umbrella.
---
&gt; Talks shit to wormholer about how "safe" his space is
---
It's pretty fucking safe isn't it.  You wouldn't be in it otherwise.   You'd have ragequit.
---
&gt;  Entirety of thread is his crying about how he wants null to be safer still otherwise PVE will suffer
---
I said making it less safe will greatly reduce the number of players in it, which is trivially true and easily demonstrable just by looking at the fucking in-game map.   
---

I fly about 30 pings a month, probably more than you do.  Some of them involve killing idiots like you in our space though.  You tend to fail pretty hard anywhere that has an umbrella.  You pick on players that can't really fight back.  You run as soon as the cyno lights up, assuming you survive the boson.
---
You're definitely on the spectrum.  No self-awareness either.
---
They still count in players online statiatic though. Therefore for the point of my discussion they are players.
---
They killed that a while ago now
---
when there is demand the price is more than anything a function of build costs in eve, if they want to lower the price just lower what is needed to build it(assuming its even a bpc really)
---
So you mean now you actually have to make choices and decisions based upon the environment and not the ship with the best isk/hour?
---
Oh wow so hard
---
Most of that style bot relies on local and not on overview settings. But as a programmer who decompile programs what I am to say differently from what you already believe.
---
Im geting mixed signals here...
---
You are telling me there is a chance ?!?
---
You picked a bad time to want to pve. /blackout

Right!

Nice

Bear in mind it was 2014 when I joined eve, but I moved into null around 4 days after joining. It was a group called Nexus fleet, Running with knives was my org. We ran a lot of minmatar shit like ruptures, and I flew a slasher for light tackle. With them I went on to fight in the Halloween wars, including B-R, the biggest battle in Eve at the time, and iirc, also the largest PvP battle in gaming history.
---
Nexus died because of that battle (depending on who you ask, you may hear leadership went AFK after that. Some will say they were before that. Any way you cut it though, our allies lost a significant portion of their cap fleet, and the C3 pocket burned.
---
It was hard living. I had few skills, little knowledge, and money was hard to come by...but I wouldn't trade away my Nexus days for anything in this game.
---
If you have so much proof they are bots then. Y all means report them to CCP. If you sont have the balls to report them all to CCP, then they must not be bots.

I too also bought several dozen of these as a market Hail Mary play when black out was announced
---
I took a scroll through your posting history.  It's basically a downvoted "who's who" of generic Goon talking points, including the oft-repeated (and always cringy) use of "Pubbie" as an insult. I did find a gem though.  One shining bright little quote that proves I'm right about you.  It's a shame really - because you talk a big, puffed out chest game (except for bragging about the Boson - that's sad).  In reality you're just scared Goon line member #30178 who doesn't want CCP to mess with his little sandbox.  
---
Ladies and gentlemen, your pathetic Goon gem quote of the week:
---
"But if I set out to earn with PvE, I'm very risk averse. Why? Losing one ship, an Ishtar say, means the last two hours of grind I've just done is completely wiped out."
---
They’re the same sp/plex as an omega subscription is, or maybe a little worse. And your sp/day is capped at the standard amount for an omega character without implants. 
---
It’s really just buying a subscription 1 day at a time, rather than getting the whole thing, which is why complaints about it don’t make any sense. It’s not buying skillpoints any more than buying a subscription is buying you a constant skill point increase
---

We'll kick u from rote if u keep this up young man
---
What narrative and I playing? Sure, we have Test and Frat exchanging blows but is that really something to write home about? It doesn't seem to be that exciting.
---
We all know Goons just rolled the North, another real exciting war. 
---
The last real exciting war (in my opinion) was when it was TEST vs PL/FRAT/SKILL etc and even that fizzled out very quickly. 
---
So to my sarcastic point, when are we getting a real conflict like the old days? Are we past that point?
---
If you are looking for npsi bombers bar
---
Both can be true at the same time.
---
Short term, I like a good PvP fight. Long term, I also like that my alliance has ISK to spend on us members.
---
Realistically, if someone could contest the TTT it would have happened long ago. This is just a transparent attempt at using convenient \~\~narrative\~\~ to circlejerk on reddit.
---
And I was one of them who bought it
---
Earn taxes to buy another structure, keep dropping em. None of them are going to stay alive for more than a week lol
---
Bombers Bar is still going. They get so many members on their fleets that it's one of the only remaining viable ways to do that.
---
True and the calculus that presents itself when figuring up the value of time and risk/reward will push players into a new meta.  
---
Excav mining is meant to be the highest yield.  By a function of game design.  There shouldn’t be an alternative to that because the costs of that equipment is entirely way more than the next best alternative.   
---
I’m a student of economics as much as anyone and it’ll be interesting to see what happens to commodities pricing and thus the pricing of goods produced once some of these “balance” changes flow thru.  We’re already at 6 isk trit following the rorqual nerfs.
---
Good job Falcon. Anybody that wants to trash my 14 years of work can die in a fire.
---
Goddamn, that IS a great video
---
By one way to find out, you mean combat probes, right?
---
People bought into their null sec elitism that only got worse every, 'burn jita' or 'hulkageddon' event. Eventually the empire 'carebears' became hardened from this and the null sec grew into the passive safety of the blue blobs and now that someone comes to 'burn' them they realize they recruited all the empire 'carebears' that didn't adapt.
---
I just fitted some tank to my alt's Ishtar, and a few other surprises (just lost a tiny bit of damage), so any tackle is welcome to try and gank me.
---
Snowflakye minimum tank ratting fits should have never been the way to go, that alone showed there was something very wrong with Nullsec.
---
Join a low sec mining Corp and haul ore for them you wont make a lot but you'll make something
---
Yeah and people also have to consider that the long skill times does deter new players. It's like someone who is buying these everyday will automatically make them better at pvp. Hell I would say it would make some want to try out pvp.
---
&gt;would be the stupidest thing ever.
---
So that's a "definitely" then. It's kind of the CCP modus operandi.

Well there was no plan to do so 4 days ago.
---
&gt; if I set out to earn with PvE, I'm very risk averse
---
Yes, most people are.  That's what I've been saying this whole fucking time.  What's your point?  I mean apart from your inability to understand the English language and your extremely odd inability to understand Human motivation, which points towards some kind of spectrum disorder.
---
just wait until local is deleted this week, theyll come out
---
&gt;\-Going from .3% to .5% = an increase of .2% right?
---
nope it's an increase of 0.2 percentage points (pctpt)
---
The increase of the tax is 166.7%
---
So you want them to be used more? Lowering the EHP and DD damage of them won't get that result.
---
The inhib definetely will need to counter combat probes in order to be useful
---
Only if NC let's you

Their builds are kind of old, about 2 years old for most of the builds I've looked at, and mostly seem to not work without modification. Luckily, simulated fit is a thing so in getting the jist of what the build is trying to do it can be tweaked to generally work.
---
Yes. I don't intend on allowing my super to die without making it as difficult as I could make it. I'd rather rely on myself then relying on others to save me if I can. The booshers have saved my ass once already by using them to boosh a sabre bubble away and saved me from committing to a cyno. Its too hard to do anything else with my other toons while micromanaging 5 wings of fighters so might as well use them in a way that makes it as safe as possible. I'm risk averse as anyone else is when it comes to expensive super caps. 
---
But when hunting I expect I'll be seeing more of this kind of krabbing going forward, then I will see expensive blinged out faction battleships.... I'm ok with that, I prefer small to midsized fleet vs fleet actions
---
Only if u can`t play without local...
---
I think if he wants to scan and hack, it does not really affect him
---
Two jumps via bwf, or One if you are in Lxq and go into palla.
---
Oh yeah I like you guys.
---
I don't see Hilmar counting a fat stack of George Washington's and wearing a pearl abyss baseball cap

And yet.....they are doing it anyway, fucking stupid.
---
These are old, I have a pair in my redeeming queue.
---
They were on sale in the store
---
The drifters are more the problem
---
Well, trust me, Vily is pissed that he had to break his word... If you put enough pressure on the broker fees, the other entities might change their views and also want to keep it at 0.3%.
---
Well anyways, I hope you can recruit a shit-ton of players for your trade hub. As I am in TEST, I will fight you. But as an Eve player, I hope you succeed in at least making it interesting.
---
Also giving the Highsec players an easy way and a cause to fight for is great. Thanks for making this
---
What... how... this is eve, its where mature and logical go to die and become reborn as sinister and jaded.
---
That was more my point. Insta blap isn't a fun mechanic.
---
Corporation friendly fire is now an illegal act.
---
Yes, I get those pings, real complex war of eagles, munnins and goku fleets.
---
I am assuming you are in TEST or one of their pets, and as such under the super umbrella, so just keep rorq mining to fuel your war machine. Just be in the standing fleet and on comms and it'll be okay :)
---
Because thats how mafia works
---
Verone is bae.
---
You see the new sig pop up, you have plenty of time to warp off and switch to a scanning ship to check it out. Not 100% safe, but way better than nullsec is going to be
---
I'm not upset at all.  I feel bad for you, since you're the kind of guy who's afraid to lose an Ishtar (but probably posts "already replaced" in local when it dies).  I just wanted to see what I was dealing with.  And you proved to be exactly what I thought you were.  
---
Regarding my elite PvP, first off, thank you for noticing.  But you're wrong about me "needing to have local removed."  I never asked CCP to do that.  I will certainly take advantage of it, but I've lived without local for years and I've done just fine.  
---
I kill much more than I lose, so I don't "fail hard most of the time," but I did die just last night to a guy who hunted me like a pro.  I wasn't sad about that, and I didn't consider it a failure to die in a PvP game.  I actually congratulated him and we had a nice chat afterwards. 
---
In any event, it's clear you're an angry krab who scuttled under the blue Goon umbrella to feel superior.  I mean this earnestly: Why don't you try living somewhere else?  Spending your time doing PI and risk averse Ishtar ratting, while waiting for pings sounds like work.  Dip your toe into J space.  You might like it.  It will make you better, that's for sure.
---
You must be thinking of someone else love, I remember you making fun of me on multiple occasions for having less that 100m isk across all my accounts! If I have been buying isk, could you find out who's been stealing it from me?
---
Nope, they doesn't like WH...
---
"I see the largest affect of these changes as a nothing more than causing repetitive strain injury to your mouse clicking finger"
---
weee, i like games that cause me injury. 
---
a few thoughts:
---
roaming gangs won't be slower as they still get intel from dotlan etc. about ratting activity.   blackout my ass, only local is going away. 
---
intel systems will work as usual, but outside of a few regions, intel sucks balls since 95% of the system are empty anyway.  Things will probably operate the same in Delve. 
---
cloaky camping stays the same.  you can still saddle up your cloaky camper up to a target, push a button, and the target will die (short of a super / rorq).
---
I absolutely do not want them used more. And when they are used they should incur risk. Not a single one dying under a faxs reps in over a year shows that they do not incur any risk so long as they are not caught moving solo or ratting.
---
even if everybody starts buying it, people won't sell it cheaper than it costs to build it…
---
Only partially! They prevent combat probes from picking things up within range, too. 
---
You have to scan it down, and show up in person.
---
Getting close to Eve 2? 😂
---
&gt; Some people want the game to be dangerous and exciting again
---
Bullshit.  people just want easy kills.  The only thing that no local provides is easier ganking.  nothing more.
---
You’re an idiot.  We have taken ihubs... dropped a Titan &amp; caps... you’re blind.
---
How does removing local make those wars any different? 
---
No local wouldn't have made nc and horde undock to fight 1000 titans.
---
Ha ha ha. High Sec carebears became hardened? Ha ha ha!
---
Tf you think I've been doing?
---
It’s not really noteworthy beyond the fact that their alliance is notorious for botting. He’s just posting the timer in hopes that people will form to blow it up.
---
&gt;30mil a pop for an hour does seem way too pricy
---
it costs me 27M to build one. Including the time to build it, and my 20% marging.
---
We are.  Currently.  Test vs frat.  Had a 2000 vs 2000 in BOZ1-O a few weeks ago.  We continue to push into wicked creek, detorid, taken 5 ihubs now.  
---

We don't do it exclusively, but we do a fair amount.

We're a corp in Test.

We also team up with other corps and special interest groups to get fleets going.
---
What do you mean? (I'm not following the news and stuff)
---
Count me in    time to fight some proxy wars and stuff    yea lets do this
---
Lol super troll the local. I dig it.
---
Great why don’t you roam in a drake then?
---
the northern conflict would have escalated, also shits happening in Providence
---
look at the fucking market
---
&gt; afraid to lose an Ishtar
---
Again, English comprehension 101.  I'm not "afraid" to lose it.  I don't want to waste the two to three hours it'll take to replace it once lost doing the very thing that caused it to be lost in the first place.
---
It's literally a complete fucking waste of time.  Ratting isn't in any sense enjoyable, so why would I do it if I was making an actual loss?  If you want to feed Ishtars to roaming gangs knock yourself out.
---
L M A O
---
Yes, but the system will still run range checks on every entity on-grid regardless of whether you think its needed or not. More ships, more checks, more load on the server... I'm sure you can figure out what that leads to
---
if there is a product that is not in high demand, but not many suppliers, that product could actually be made cheaper by an increase in demand but only after more suppliers enter the market, increasing the supply curve
---
“But Test is blue to all of eve” 
---
“Null sec doesn’t PvP they only krab” 
---
“Test are just F1 monkeys”
---
What am I forgetting??
---
&gt;special interest groups
---
you mean furries dont you?
---
My comment has nothing to do with local being removed or not. I'm saying we've seemingly reached a point where any real conflicts like years past, are gone, and there's no reason to start a war.
---
This all came about because someone was a little too sensitive and couldn't figure out I was being sarcastic.
---
the egregious amounts of furry porn they link in alliance chat
---
This gives me a sad :'(

Seconded.  How can a script help you loot faster?
---
It rests every day though. It's getting plenty of sleep Karen.
---
literally every alliance has their own blopsing group wtf are you talking about "*blopsing groups started dying out*" - there are more now than I ever remembered in my EVE career
---
As I understand it, (and I do not live in null myself) they all blued one another and the real content is to not be bart of them and go shoot at em...

https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203218962-Broker-Fee-and-Sales-Tax

tl;dr: npc broker fee is not .1%
---
Well if he is exploring he most likely is in a small ship like a frig. Should be fast enough and warp out before drifters can lock (like 2 sec?) Just have to keep a lookout for driftings warping onto you.
---
Might have to do with the fact that this line of thought is entirely carried by the thought process "I'm angry other people have more stuff than me and I don't like that".
---
Get on with the dumbing down-just request a “jump to best vulnerable target” button that has a 50 ly range.
---
I’ve noticed that on some fits they have there as well. I’ll usually put the fits on Neocom on my phone and mess around with them whenever I’m away from my computer.  I will have to say the breakdowns they usually have with fits showing what they are trying to accomplish has single-handedly made me better with it. It’s real ELI5 and I like that.
---
No he had it right.  
---
The drop on ya ass sigs.  
---
Feel free to color test pussies.  Well just have to use your killboard as tribute to the strength of our might
---
So talk about it on discord or reddit. You don't go to someone's business and start talking about how they should just scrap the whole thing and start over and expect not to get told to shut the fuck up.
---
I kind of want to go around null and just spam FIRST in local.
---
Last I priced them, 500 PLEX was cheaper and better and 2 large injectors competitive.
---
No mate.They are insta lock and 100km scram.
---
You can. You’d make better isk in a venture, but you still can technically use the bomber
---
Wasn't aware of that.
---
It's probably more accurate to say that nullbears and high-sec carebears have equalized.
---
Then yeah, we're past that point.
---
There are few conflict drivers. And just as few old players remaining with enough hate from 15 year old grudges for us to really see meaningful conflicts.
---
If I were a leader of a Corp, if struggle to give my members a reason for us to go to war.
---
Oh, I consider Providence my normal day to day :)
---
Thanks for sharing, that’s a pretty sweet pic and is definitely going to be my new desktop background.
---
👍
---
Because tackle always comes one at a time 
---
A Helios has 5 mids. If you bring 3 of those and one has a bricked faction scram, you can tackle a super and kill it pretty easy
---
&gt; I wouldn't make sense to bit the hand that feeds you.
---
A lot of shit that doesn't make sense has happened in Eve. Every month of so we hear a story of some heist, or personal vendetta executed by turning over or offlining structures. You're insane if you don't think that TTT is the _primary_ target of a lot of people just happy to sow chaos. 
---
Like legit, you're living in a fantasy world.
---
Falcon says no way, that's dumb.
---
Which really means Probably Yes.
---
yep and moved to lowsec, only logical progression when hardening up ;-P
---
Haha thanks bud, happy to share the laughter )
---
I think they should add something that makes the drone auto aggro temporary, perhaps a overload function that makes drones degrade so the max use is 5 minutes of auto-aggro before they break. 
---
Example: you press a button, you get 5 minutes of possible drone auto aggro but they take 33% structure damage from "overheating their cpu"
---
&gt; If you want stability use NPC stations.
---
did I say he should use volta if he wanted stability? Nope. Sure didn't.
---
Let me know when you get hotdropped by a cloaky/nulli t3c. Unless the surprise was a bunch of WCS, I guess
---
It is possibly to and not pay attention to what the mega blobs do? However, I do play and pay attention (or try to) to what happens around me.
---
&gt; my 14 years of work
---
you doing it wrong, I played a game in that time
---
Delicious, delicious irony.
---
Thanks for the kind words! Glad someone likes it.  I just got back into the game after 5+ yrs away.  Everything has changed for the better, graphically, so I will try to capture some more cool moments in game and share when I can.  Fly safe!
---
thx, removing
---
Any null sec alliance worth their salt has a sig. Gonies have had their sig by us for a few weeks with limited successes. We also have two sigs, of course, Bombers bar is still a thing.
---
The day nullsec fell silent
---
Not again, he’s fragile these days
---
Its technically possible due to skill injectors. But it would be exorbitantly expensive for anyone that didnt start EVE really early on.
---
That sounds suspiciously like a logical progression and based in fact. You are in the wrong subreddit!
---
In fact it don't solve the problem of free intel when you are cloack.
---
&gt; Why risk subcaps if I can’t PANIC
---
you know that panic protects the mining subcaps too, right?
---
Reminds me of [this](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SereneVagueHaddock-size_restricted.gif)

Some of my corpmates got a sick astero kill doing blops :)
---
when reading "natural habitat" i expected a tackled Cap/Supercap dying ...
---
And in which group is snuffed out then when you take them out of "Lowsec Manly Men"
---
I get you make progress. But from my standpoint, I don't hear a lot about it. Maybe I miss the reddit posts or the TEST propaganda machine isn't as good as others used to be?
---
yeah congrats for taking econ 101
---
now go look at build cost
---
That.
---
Have you ever heard of a Loki? Because from your post I really don’t think you have
---
You only get ~1 new site a day in wormhole space. Gotta have full feature parity.
---
theres an incoming freighter nerf???
---
Provibloc doesn't count.
---
&gt;And while they do engage in fleet combat from time to time, the fleets are generally extremely large I don't deal with nullsec literally ever though
---
Yeah, only fleets that people talk about are "generally extremely large", since those fights are big enough to hit places like r/Eve.  But there's a near-constant stream of small fleets doing random shit.  In TEST, these are mostly on a corporation level.  From what I hear, Goons do something similar with their sigs.
---
There's about 2 to 3-ish alliance-level giant fleets per day, and about 5-6 small, random "hey, lets go do \_\_\_\_\_" fleets.
---
Gotcha
---
o7
---
You need some gummy bears
---
Logical progression ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egd1cC5hH7s ... now I feel old :-(
---
I’m literally telling you what hot war is being waged and you’re arguing with me.
---
Have you ever flown a Helios or any cov ops? Do you know what 5 scrams is going to do to ur capacitor, if theres even enough to activate them all for a cycle. Sure we can get more complicated and if they stagger their warp ins perfectly they might catch it for a few seconds before they get smartbombed off the grid.
---
That is his idea, it isn’t actually happening
---
Yeah, finally got cyno V for my blops...
---
Wouldn't this just serve to make scouting dread bombs easier and make nullsec safer? Just dock in the station if you want to see who's around.
---
Riiiight... but I just said the rorq won’t be our cause why put it on the field if no excavators...
---
I realize that requires some work on your part to catch up here and I’m sorry if doing that offends you.
---
&gt; MSI is the most unpopular piece of deployable equipment.
---
...which is why this is a thread about buffing it?
---
Or maybe we just busy winning and not running our mouths about it?  
---
Like good sports?
---
So... can we integrate the Battleclinic killmails into the current killboards? A lot of my PvP kills were on there. :P
---
I would sign up for a blank server and take all 19 accounts with me. No injectors. You are not the brightest bulb on the tree, Falcon. In fact I'd say you are part of the problem. Create a separate shard to test interest. You will be surprised when the majority chooses the non-Alex Gianturco version.
---
Regional wouldnt work out too well imo, mainly because some groups can lock down regions effectively and its not conducive to an actual chatting environment in EVE. Remember Local is "for" chatting. xP
---
Oh shit I have always heard if you warp within 2 sec you were good
---
Stupidest Thing Ever is a bit strong, can we really not imagine a worse thing?
---
So titans would literally become the new frigs?
---
I have no idea what's going on in the most wonderful way! :)
---
Highsec salt is pretty fucking good too though
---
I do. They are good ships with a wide engagement profile, good dps, strong tank, and lots of mid slots. People like you underestimate them all the time which lead to good fights.
---
Yeah, they're not bad but you can tell they are older and we already got teased with their concept art years ago.
---
You know you’ll be finishing out your moon schedule. So why complain about the move op being a week after rent is due?
---
Yeah so the npc cartels install their own observation structures that restore local in the same way sov holders will be able to do in a couple of weeks
---
Fun fact, the arazu in that pic has been DD'd twice and shot by high angle capital guns dozens of times :)
---
Scram has a 9km range, smartbombs aren’t a threat. They also don’t use much capacitor, so it would be fine if you just threw a couple cap mods on. You don’t need to hold point for long, just long enough for a cyno to be lit.
---
I forget what I am skilling now, got like 200M SP and 500 days queues :P
---
You in 0.0 or J space?   
---
It matters
---
I guess the point of it is for someone to let their PvP character lapse into Alpha, then use that Alpha Injector to resub and unlock the Omega Skills for an op.
---
Didn’t stainguy or someone already say this?
---
You got me. I will take this and prob bext week to get familiar with the game and then i will hop to PH
---
Not really AFK if they are shitting up local. 
---
I see no problem with this interaction.
---
As a resident of NPC null, no.
---
I would play eve “classic”.
---
Removing fatigue gives risk to supers and titans, not killing the ehp.
---
Ah I know that Astero pilots ... -v-o-n-h-o-l-e-d-
---
If you just want to krab, sure go there. If you want to pvp null isn't the way to go.
---
&gt;other starter groups are politically aligned and sometimes you burn bridges without knowing what you are doing
---
If you're referring to the new-player-friendly corps in the large alliances, literally no one cares.  We all know you're just trying to figure out the game in such corps, and part of that is figuring out what you like or don't like in a corp.  We expect you to hop between the blocs.
---
It's not like politics are decided by random line members.
---
It's wormhole rules, for all I know there's a gang of 15 cloaked 150km off. Farm away.
---
It's the best meme fit imho. Perfect platform for polarized blasters...
---
The worst part about the DLC pack was seeing people on here defend it because "CCP has to make money".

If we're talking general updates then you have to remember EVE is an entirely different animal compared to WarFrame. Any changes can have long reaching balance impacts and they may not be noticeable until years down the line. 
---
EVE is also 16 years old and much of its behind the scenes coding is at least 6 years old. Coding standards and organization changes very dramatically and very fast and legacy code has to be re-organized and reworked before you can start really doing anything players can actually see in their gameplay.
---
WarFrame is newer and is an FPS, its game goals and gameplay has far less variables and impacts as they are tweaked.
---
If we're talking ship redesigns exclusively though then yeah, they come a tad slow but thats partially because they arent a massive priority.
---
EVE 2019, local memes are the real battlefield
---
This gives me a boner, and I don't PvE... but I do have a huge fucking ego.
---
Cloud Ring, fountain and scalding pass...
---
Sorry friend, I did my time in the big alliance fleets as well, tactics change very little as the scale increases. Still use cloaky eyes in staging systems, still use humint (spies) to determine response numbers. The availability of names/numbers in local is just a crutch. If your depending on that then you're doing it wrong.
---
wtf r u talking about
---
That would be an extreme hassle because of the back and forth in order to get the ship "right".
---
I had a ship die within a second of decloaking in a gate. Was dead before I saw yellow or red box. I was expecting it to happen like that, but it was unreal. I clicked to warp and my pod, not my ship warped. I started the click while I was in a living ship and it completed in a pod.
---
Nice try of lowering the effort to scout people hunting your krabs ... maybe just dock at the station or fly to the citadel grids ... there you have all information you need to know ...
---
I don’t think you understand how it works.
---
Me too...on another alt
---
That will probably happen sooner or later, but small scout tackle is far more common (for the moment at least).
---
well not every can go the way you went a la " "I'm angry other people have more stuff than me so i am gonna join their ranks"
---
Who is Charlotte from NC.?
---
Welcome back mate!! 
---
    
---
but how dope would it be if eve reset regularly ala poe
---
Yeah, that's not what it's actually like at all.
---
But that is what r/Eve posters constantly claim.
---
Who the hell rage rolls c1 wormholes? You have to be an absolute madman.
---
Side note, probe window is honestly your best bet and anyone who lives in wormholes knows this. New sig? Scan and check it out.
---
:thonking:
---
If you look at the Black Ops ship category on zkill there’s a handful of groups, some are only a few people, and the prolific ones are Therabois.  There’s not a lot right now, but I’m hoping more are created or revived
---
Insurance nerf
---
You’re both morons
---
Shoo! Shooooo! Get your own post, this is my sca.... legitimate business venture post.
---
Sov null is definitely viable for newbie, so is wormholes and just about anything in eve. But you need a good group ( as in teaches newbies and makes room for them in their activities).
---
It would, but it's BBTB pretending to not know that in the hopes noone will notice.
---
owo what's this
---
While you’re at it, let’s also make a ship go into first person mode with a reticle for aiming your guns instead of the current lock and f1 mechanics. Equally good idea tbh.
---
Yeah isk/h is much higher in NS
---
Everyone has the same opportunity in game to make friends or enemies. Perhaps you should try not being anti social?
---
answer the fucking question
---
&gt;do you look through every thread for any opportunity to push your narrative or is it your actual thoughts?
---
&gt;moogoo is far from region locked although many regions lack a specific goo
---
So, it's far from region locked although it's region locked.
---
&gt;its just a matter of blueing the guy next to you
---
Sorry, no.  There's goo you can only get in the south of the map, and goo you can only get in the north of the map.
---
Removing fatigue also makes them more powerful because then they could jump across the galaxy as fast as their capacitor recharges again.
---
You should check out some of the wormhole groups, like Lazerhawks!
---
Enjoy the videos, thanks for the content
---
whats an afk pvper?
---
Why would you put a covert cyno on your blops?
---
An argument requires two people disagreeing on a subject.... and you didn't contradict me calling you obtuse, so... I'm wondering what were 'arguing' about too.
---
I was just politely calling you a dumbass, because the quote I referenced is fucking stupid, and akin to something that would dripple out of some newbros face hole.
---
Mmm 10% tidi waiting to press F1 on your Doomsday in a fight that has zero purpose, so fun you guys.
---
Are we there yet?
---
Freighters can dock in everything.  So a Raitaru will do it for insurance.
---
Goons can get every moongoo either from period basis delve or initiative space
---
Oh you sweet summer child
---
Scorpion is fine considering its a technical ECM warboat + already has been redesigned and the Drake and Rokh also look fine imo.
---
What needs doing is the Imicus which is still very clearly from the old Gallente artstyle.
---
No worries, I do the same with a tonne of other content and it always sucked that there was a lack of news/interviews for EVE outside of TiS, so I decided to try and fill that gap!
---
Where does that put them in relation to turbo krab wormholers and low sec... well, no one is in low sec.
---
Same point from a different angle; if the alliance can't reimburse t1 newbro tackle, get the fuck out of that alliance.
---
BBTB
---
Do you need me to explain what "south" and "north" are for you to figure this out, or do you think you might be able to piece it together yourself?
---
Hint: Where do you think Fountain and Period Basis are?
---
  Lol I kinda want to rage roll a C1 connect for kicks now.  The small corps in em will never see it coming.
---
     Yeah you really can only get caught if they roll into you mid-siege or on a scram wave of rats. If you’re gas huffing you have no excuse.
---
The idea of a complete local blackout for all space both scares me, and makes me exited.
---
If CCP did this, and brought back the old ECM mechanics, I would be really happy. Oh, and fixed FW.
---
&gt;  I started the click while I was in a living ship and it completed in a pod.
---
That doesn't even work that way. Either you were spamming warp, or server-side you were dead before your warp command got through.
---
Won't those professions become more lucrative as less players do them due to the risk/high APM?
---
There is but it's not particularly valuable
---
Test/FRT is the only one with any real fights. Goons have been structure bashing.
---
the third one is so irrelevant I can't even think of it
---
I've welped entire fleets because I'd try to take a fight with some risk associated, just so there'd be a chance we'd have stuff to shoot at and maybe have some fun in the process, but got badly outblobbed in the end.
---
But thanks for speaking in my place and telling me I just want easy kills.
---
Yes there are risk averse people that want easy kills. Though I often see them when I roam null and a fleet of 50 HACs show up as a response to our 6 nano cruisers or 10 to 15 assault frigs.
---
I'm actually looking forward to this solely because I might encounter gangs with which great fights might happen, which will change from the überblob I can either avoid or suicide into for absolutely no gain while boringly preying on the one or two ratter that doesn't watch intel or the broken bots.
---
Well, I guess not for my Blops, but for blops'ing.
---
For the covert cyno to help hunt.  Not having it was a  convienent excuse to not be the hunter...
---
I'll accept your statement and revise my first hand experience which is obviously not as accurate.
---
that's suspiciously on the clock
---
Okay hold up does anyone here actually think there will be a legit "reset"? I'm convinced those who do are just straight up trolls. 
---
Everyones keeping their loot and toons. Nullsec structures getting torn down does not constitute a "reset" of the game. 
---
At most you can say Nullsec is getting reset. Which seems to have been the popular opinion/primary complaint about the game.
---

Looks like HORDE + TEST combined isn't enough, you needed to hire PIRAT too.   
---
The absolute state of nullsec.
---
J space
---
You haven't met me yet.
---
In addition to this, I'll add a more recent development: During a recent in-game live event in Semiki, a number of Sansha's Nation attempted to attack an Arataka Research Consortium station, possibly because of Semiosis Conduits stored there.
---
During the attack, a number of Triglavian warships also appeared (there was neither an Incursion nor Invasion active in the system at the time). Despite their alleged hostility to Sansha's Nation, they joined in the attack before abruptly self-destructing. Current (lore) theory is that the Triglavian ships were "corrupted" in a similar way to how the second and third datastreams you describe - leading to "self-immolation" being invoked by the Triglav commander.
---
Well you are splitting hairs to make a point, but an AFK camper is sometimes AFK and sometimes watching the system. Now I can stick my camper in a system and from time to time D-Scan, Jump to a few saved bookmarks, then go back to being AFK. Except now, and I am fitted with a covop cyno, you won’t even know I was there until too late.
---
&gt; the quote I referenced is fucking stupid
---
It isn't is it.  Some smoothbrained idiot in the comment above told me to play Eve.  I was pointing out that I've been playing it for longer than most people on the server.
---
&gt;  I'm bored at work
---
McDonald's are really letting standards slip.
---
So basically nothing changes?  Right now it's either VNI bots which might as well be nothing, or umbrella ships.
---
Wrecking shot
---
Not from the perspective of someone on the ground, no.
---
I never said you weren’t fighting. I said it doesn’t seem hot to me based on past wars and their propaganda machine.
---
Better solution... bring 1/10 more people. That way 1/10 more people get on the killmail too.
---
Mmmmm warping to a tackled rorq only to fuck off once a cyno goes up... so fun you guys
---
&gt; conflicts like years past, are gone, and there's no reason to start a war.
---
&gt; This all came about because someone was a little too sensitive and couldn't figure out I was being sarcastic.
---
If asset safety was less magical and hangar loot had a chance of dropping, you wouldn't need to struggle so much. Just point and tell them "Thar's gold in them hills".
---
I realize you think it’s the same but the bots will get caught and thus they’ll be dead.  The real players won’t even be there.
---
Don't you just need to speak once to be displayed on local till next DT?
---
&gt; I've welped entire fleets because I'd try to take a fight with some risk associated,
---
omg you took a risk once or twice? congrats?  you sir are the savior of eve!
---
at least we'll always know where test is with their local spam.
---
&gt;(if isk making can be considered playing)
---
Why wouldn't it be? It's a sandbox game, not everyone like to do pvp and not because of that they're playing the wrong game.
---
Probably some high sec pleb who wants cpp to do the heavy lifting for their own lazy ass. XD
---
Ok well this is reddit where we just jump to a conclusion and don’t accept we’re wrong so carry on snowflake.
---
Well for the first 9 years of my Eve experience that's how it worked. Maybe CCP changed it in the past few months...
---
To the people that were in there at the time you spoke.
---
Soon TM
---
#######nopoors
---
&gt; I just said the rorq won’t be our cause why put it on the field if no excavators...
---
and i answered it.
---
oh and mining boosts.
---
Yea  but it needs to happen
---
Sorry for your loss but this gave me a good chuckle haha.
---
&gt; would be the stupidest thing ever
---
*looks at CCP’s trackrecord.. *
---
I surmise it's the same thing as trying to hit the button at a cross walk. It does nothing, but you hope it does.
---
I was not directed to write this comment, I can push F1 all by myself. ENE will be great.
---
Small gang and cyno inhibs exist, you should try them sometime.
---
Pic stolen for Desktop background ... TY awesome pic!!!
---
Same.
---
I'm a Principle SAN Architect, on-call every other week, 7 kids (15-21, now)... I'm way too fucking busy to PLEX shit when I do get time to play.
---
1B ISk = $10 = 10 minutes at work.  No fucking way in hell am I going to plex EVE for hours.
---
Nobody forced them into the consortium, so coulda just said no when the risk of him breaking his word was brought to the surface???
---
100% and it's the reason I'm coming back
---
I knew I was dead when I saw them, but it was a sit back and go "whoa" moment with how fast it was. I'm not a fan of the dynamic of things instantly dying tho.
---
Ah the new 'please don't take my local away thread' by BBTB2.
---
I mean, you could argue that the Pirates try (in vane) to counter you farming by deploying more military.      
---
But i'll say it again; Important are the game mechanics. The Lore can be build around that.
---
Now what you are saying about making players spread out... That's actually interesting.     
---
High activity systems are easily defended, but bad to farm in. The more players you have the more space you need, but it becomes increasingly easy to attack.
---
Doing the lords work
---
I think if they reset nullsec and do some extra marketing about that   ore a new server or something a lot of people will come back  or come to check it out again
---
Predditors in TEST focus on hotdropping, ganking, bombing, and generally abusing blops/covops mechanics as much as we can to harass and murder our opponents. 
---
Less of a focus on combat blops (they're outshined by T3Cs in the current meta) but I'm hoping the upcoming changes might fix that.
---
It’s just olmecca / marshyy. Occasionally they dread bomb, but normally just eyes, yeah.
---
I'm glad you took my post so seriously. Have fun mining!
---
When was the last time you genuinely were afraid you were going to lose your rorq?
---
It’s really very autistic the degree to which he applies his craft... so precise... almost like a machine it’s so well executed
---
It would be not dope
---
You don't have to support what test is doing just because you are in test
---
Sounds like a good time to me!
---
I too comment EXACTLY In 20 minute intervals.
---
But... BBTB is usually the dreadbomb himself? He'd be throwing a party rn instead of complaining.
---
That's a shame, Eve could use a reset
---
You realize they don't have to actually look at the titan and fax while it sits there, right?  They can do something else while waiting for a ping/someone to speak up on comms.
---
Having to watch a gate means you aren't doing anything else while watching that gate.

hahahaha just wait... I can't tell you how many times I logged into EVE in the wee hours of the morning, feeding a kid semi-sleeping on a boppy in my lap.
---
Shit, I have alts named after all 7 of my kids, usually within a few weeks/month or their DOB.  I created the alt the first time I was up late with each kid.  They're all my mains, now.

“I can push F1 all by myself”
---
  They’re evolving!!! Quick, someone burn it with fire before it spreads!!
---
No, because the bulk of the isk made from ratting is from bounty payments which are a flat isk payment into your wallet (which is super dumb because it has been the largest source of isk into the economy that has massively inflated over the years).
---
its not until DT. its like 30 minutes
---
I think you need counselling. Calm down. If it makes you feel better, yes you are l337, and yes we will all play the game how you want us to. Now take your medication.
---
Inner Hell... odins call... Volta... bomber bar... ferra...   goons came into eso on a dreadbomb but not on my grid.  
---
Additionally the excavators can be deleted by a decloaking smart bomber.  And that requires no effort at all.  
---
Every time there’s a tackle there’s a chance.  I take them all seriously.
---
How would it erase player history? Nothing really “permanent” has been done by players. They could put in the same monuments, keep the same system names, etc.
---
I don’t want a reset, but it wouldn’t erase anything.
---
I will push the truth, as I always have.
---
No but if you are carrier or super ratting on NS for the sake of it I will consider that you have very poor taste
---
You can apply to McDonalds and plex your account in 2-3 hours

---
He hit the nail on the head.  All you want are easy kills.  Nothing more.
---
Sure he is.
---
Blackout = Black Ops Life
---
This thread brought to you buy dumb ideas from reddit: **You don't think it be like it is, but it do**
---
It would loose the entire point of eve.
---
At this point in my EvE life I do prefer PVE. I don't want it safer, but I don't want this. Every change they've made has made it BETTER for close groups with umbrellas and worse for small groups and solos. My favorite time of eve (and honestly why I keep feeling the nostalgia to come back and be disappointed every couple years) is castor, around 2004 IIRC. I wish it would come back to a time when people were poor and losing a ship meant something, when everyone was spread out into tons of systems and roaming in solo BS was a real thing.
---
That shit won't happen again but I had hoped drifters would mean people would have to stay close to home to fight against invasions and knock out low-power cit spam. But no it's just random bs :| Make changes that will break blocs and cause small alliances/coalitions to be able to flourish, not make them pull tighter pockets.
---
Hard to do? Yeah :| And a lot of it at this point is "damage done" even if you removed rorqs and caps in anoms. Hopefully something could be done, this doesn't look like it at all unfortunately :|
---
The issue with HS is that it has all of the negatives without any of the positives. My advice is to join any of the newbro corps who are willing to take in anyone, be it NS or WHs, and leave your HS life behind for good. All of the newbro alliances provide great assistance to new players and you can be useful on day 1.
---
I made this same post 3 years ago. I started 1 year ago. There is still a ton in the game worth doing. Get an alpha account and see if you like it
---
So an expensive way to get yourself banned for macro use?  GJ, you win the internets for today.
---
Additionally I do small gang all the time.  It’s fun.  And it’s currently a challenge to actually get kills.  Taking away local makes it fish in a barrel.  It’s almost as if that’s your whole desire here... you only want easy kills.
---
Man, if only there was a little risk involved in being cloaked in space
---
Can't have that though, this games about safety and such. Gotta keep it safe. 100% safe. Baby tier safe.
---
As always guys, feedback is welcome. You guys helped (mostly) fix my audio issues, so anything I can do to improve this content is greatly appreciated!
---
Tribute... pure blind.... lots of 0.0 available atm
---
I'll probably throw an alt in just for a fight. However we all know how this is going to end. Every member of the cartel of TTT is going to wardec you and you'll have goons+test+panfam allied together fighting Liers Den.
---
The fact that the 0.0 "enemies" all join together on this to protect their ISK racket shows how fuck the priorities of players are in this game now. The fact people are saying you are throwing away money when this is a guaranteed fight (not a good one but still a fight) also convinces me that they have no idea why us pvpers even play.
---
Dscan exists bruh
---
Kill the Intel bots. Works for wh.
---
haha, some of my friends I just got into the game have had "fun" with the welcoming commitee on the Tama hisec gate lol.
---
Personally, I've always found them pretty friendly, though I don't generally stick around to say hello.
---
EHP isn't the problem, it's damage. 
---
Granted, you just want to get your kills quick and then leave so whatever. Give the pvpers everything they want, and you'll only be left with them.
---
&gt;Anything undocked will have to have a cyno on it without sacrificing any fitting.
---
Or so cheap to replace that they already have 2-3 tucked away by the time the seal-clubbers get to them.
---
Where can those corps?
---
Imperium already discourages exports. If they get more strict, t2/cap markets could really shift.
---
I would like the risk brought back for supers and titans but in my opinion I don’t believe that would be the way. Everyone argues about how to do it and all want their idea to stick but outside of nerfing rigs, extenders and the such, I haven’t really heard something worth even shaking a stick at.
---
firstly, those keyboards aren't expensive.
---
secondly, ccp might have higher priorities than banning people who automate dscan... like all the fucking bots people keep crying about.
---
&gt;  The only thing that no local provides is easier ganking. nothing more. 
---
Except that you lose your unassailable instant intel through things like NEAR2.
---
People want the chance at an escalation, which very rarely happens now because 95% of you nullbears are docked from a NEAR2 ping and too scared to actually fight without a super 1 click away.
---
Even if you stay docked and don't fight or do anything (such engaging gameplay, definitely worth logging in for). I hope the blackout remains indefinite just so you quit from boredom and people move into your space that actually want to fight when a 3-5 man gang roams your space. Instead of clutching your purses being scared of the nano-boogeymen.
---
Calmer than you are, dude.
---
Why not just make black ops dscan immune?
---
Pretty sure V0lta was part of Skill Urself before they left in the spring of 2019 - who held the most systems in the game ( that no one else wanted) while  needing to have PanFam in their back pocket.. 
---
Fixed that for you...
---
Gib buff to blops bs plz
---
i think, at minimum, we should remove asset safety from low power structures.
---
no, because ratting bounties are just a flat payout - regardless of how many people are doing them.
---
May I suggest Nyx
---
Eve Classic before motherships and titans. To see a server play out without ever having these ships introduced would be the most interesting.
---
You can now mine in WH
---
You are such a prolific poster! Good for you!
---
Yeah they have loot in jspace plenty people run them. You should take pointers from them.
---
I'm someone who went living in wormhole on day 1 so, yeah why not!
---
No, I do not get why someone would hide under the blue donut umbrella instead of playing the game on hard mode, the way it was meant to be played, against the best the game has to offer.  Come see if you can hack it in Bob's domain.
---
I get that using Dscan is definitely an active help but if I’m just gonna spam a keybind every Global cool down I’m just gonna go play WoW.
---
I feel you.  I'm in the same boat but with a 680 day queue.  I'm actually surprised when I log in with a completed skill message.  Like it's my damn cake day.
---
Both WH and Lowsec folks have accepted that risk is unavoidable and either are part of an elite pvp alliance which will not undock unless they have a full comp and HG pods or they expect to die.
---
And it’s also the same level of concentration that air traffic controllers must exert.  Where they only work 4 hours of an 8 hour day in order to remain sharp and attentive
---
"Blob everyone" says the Supercap Umbrella dino dude
---
I don’t care... what works for WHs... 
---
I want to play... the game I have... 
---
Not yours.  
---
You can go play your game in your fucking wormhole.
---
Then we'll start tearing down your uncontested infrastructure, which the drifters will probably help us not having to deal with some initial timers. We can fuel our cits with the fuel we scavenge from the wrecks of your jump gates.
---
Maybe remove fatigue for covert class cynoes, so that it would give an advantage to hunter while not affecting supers/titans too much.
---
Exactly and then must somehow feel like you’re making a profit on the time spent performing the activity while figuring in losing 1-2 per session.
---
Thanks?  I think?
---
Says every ignorant idiot, the frying pan heat is turning up, and you keep saying hotter and hotter.
---
this is the complete opposite?
---
Those people are just the worst.. 😁
---
I'm not even talking about things that would require new code.  There are a lot of ships that have needed help for years and nothing has been done.  Redesigns I can accept that maybe they only have 2 artists on staff or something. We saw they had to break up t3 destroyer releases due to art reasons so I guessing there cant be many people working on that front.
---
yeah
---
what.
---
If he's talking in local, you know he's active.  You can then scurry back to the Keepstar until you feel safe enough to undock in this PvP game we call Eve.
---
Shh you're killing the dream.
---
All of our structures are quite well defended and will not be lost to some npc garbage.  
---
What suffers from the drifters is the PvP campaigns.  Dudes burned out from shooting npcs don’t have the gas to go fight frat for 3 more hours.
---
I think you'll be able to get it out but it'll take a couple jumps.
---
Hey, works fine in low too. 
---
I'm really not sorry that the area of space intended to be without any security whatsoever is losing its network of bot fed intel. Dangerous space is supposed to be dangerous, if you don't like it, move elsewhere. 
---
The fact that you can't rely on automated pings to tell you when someone's nearby is one of the best things CCP has ever done for this game.
---
If you and Stainguy took the day off, this sub would die.  Never stop shitting up reddit.
---
We enjoying a good ole covert cyno whenever the opportunity arises.
---
I want to be able to invite my friends from local into my blopsing gang bro
---
I mean, some tech could always hit the "reset" button on the server and then we all have to wait for the thing to reboot from an unclean shutdown.
---
Ideally, you would while first fitting the ship.
---
You have to decide if you will stick to an area or randomly roam.  If sticking to a specific area of space, you can setup your tank and damage for those pirates.  If wandering, you have to decide if you want to Omni tank or carry mods to refit as needed.  Weapon type is mostly decided by the Race's Hull you use.
---
Assuming you are going to start out in Amarr space?  If so, you will run into mostly Blood Raiders.  They deal and are weak to EM/Thermal.  So Lasers and Amarr (EM) or Gallente (Thermal) drones to kill them.
---
You will also come across Rogue Drones; weak to EM/Thermal and deal a bit of everything.  Lower sites "should" deal mostly EM/Thermal to you, so the same fit would work for both factions.
---
[This link will give you a rundown on the basic damage types per faction.](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_damage_types)
---
Remember, you can use any damage type in the lower level sites and still clear them.  May just take a little longer.

Yes, we got to see how "elite" wormholers were when Rage got capped.
---
people who cloaky camp and right-click + jump
---
The best part of no local is actually no blues in local either. Use spy alts blue to the targets for warpins/intel without ever getting called out and kicked because no one knows you're in system.
---
That a funcking bad idea.
---
If you do that you will have a very strong issue something like 20 min after the patch. It will nto work as you think. 
---
Super and titan pilot will wait on bomber near a blops, and travel near in an instant aroud the whiole galaxy , dock and take a titan/super in the opposite side of galaxy by magic of teleportation.
---
there is no insurance nerf
---
Less safe : for krabs
---
But
---
More safe : for gankers
---
You got a paycheck?
---
&gt; It isn't is it.
---
Well, since you asked -- yes, it is.
---
&gt; I was pointing out that I've been playing it for longer than most people on the server.
---
You probably confused that smoothbrained idiot with your fucktard of a statement, which implied you have fuck-all for clues as to the base instincts that drive people to compete for the stupidest shit EVE has to offer, and have been doing it since day one.
---
&gt; McDonald's are really letting standards slip.
---
No, my part time gig -- pimping your mom out.  That bitch is an earner, and doesn't need much input.... other than all the dicks she's hoovering.
---
If you remove local to avoid free intel remove ALL free intel
---
Thank you. Much appreciated :3
---
Double the range.
---
Bump length of time to 24 hrs (48 is too long).
---
Add a new one that is 3x the price. Mobile super inhibitor, which also cloaks the inhibitor from dscans.  Probes can find it.
---
Require it to be deployed from a battle cruiser or above (for fleet movements), also prevents scout ships from massing the field with them.
---
Yeah, don't look in alliance chat unless you want eye cancer. 
---
Corps like RCJT, Infinite Point, and Star Frontiers, and the Predditors SIG they work with, operate differently and do a fair amount of small gang &amp; blops/covops work.
---
It’s not bot fed - it’s player fed intel.  The players observe conditions and post to channels.  
---
You play wormholes go do that.  That’s the game you enjoy.  Quit imposing your game on everyone else.
---
It's time to learn to play and learn to hunt. Actually kill super or titan is not hard if you have a minimum strategy and brain cell.
---
And yes if you attack an umbrella of 200 people, it'sz normal they can blap you 3 nano cruiser.
---
ships aren't free, brainlet.
---
Time spend by people to report people they see on local is not free to. Time is money.
---
I agree, but I feel you might be lacking a bit of knowledge in the modeling area. The general design if fine. The model though has an extremely low poly count, so low that it looks like an asset from a PS2 game. I don't any of the ships I mentioned need a complete redesign. They just need to be remodeled using current modeling practice and tech.
---
The aeon on the other hand is ugly but I feel that it's model looks better, as in has enough modeled detail to make it look less dated.
---
A lot of "krab" don't avoid risk. They just play in group to reduce risk. And beacause a lot of hunter are bad they cry about the "no risk".
---
In fact if they play nicely and don't praise for a gold ammo they could make dank kill.
---
Can you still buy them?
---
I wouldn't be opposed to a NEW server. One without capital ships and POS.
---
which mental disability do you have?
---
And I'm sure the "Intel001", "Intel014", and other similar characters I see every time I pass through null all have their paid subs up with someone manning the client. 
---
Y'all aren't fooling anyone. For years it's been "adapt or die" whenever null got another security or resource buff, and for the first time in ages it's getting something adversareal on its plate. 
---
And to that, all anyone has to say, is all we've always been told:
---
Adapt, or die. 
---
Otherwise, put your money where your mouth is and tell CCP just how much you hate it by unsubbing.
---
A true master would bot-troll an entire region that way.
---
\&gt;  the base instincts that drive people to compete for the stupidest shit EVE has to offer 
---
You mean to suggest control and exploitation of resources is not part of Eve (I don't mean renting or botting, which is presumably how you imagine the economy works) and pointing, webbing and shooting is all its about.  I think you should probably play the game some more.
---
\&gt;  No, my part time gig -- pimping your mom out 
---
My mom has been dead for 10 years you complete idiot but knock yourself out with what you imagine is my mother, probably made of latex or silicon.  You're clearly the kind of sick fuck who'll enjoy it.
---
Bears are bears! If they can't dscan they're gonna get an anchor like a wanker.
---
Ho you want to keep you're perfect spy intell with no risk, but you do'nt want you're ennemy can know you are here.
---
how bad are you in this game ?
---
Too bad, I love the thany but it's looking so dated. Anyway thanks for the reply.
---
Please enjoy it! Thanks!!
---
Let’s be real, no one is reporting anyone in local, null is full of bots to do that for you.  Shame they’ll all be worthless now
---
I'm still getting my "Testicular Fortitude" skill to 5 in order to get those kind of action shots.
---
you just proof you don't go often in 0.0
---
Most of hunter are cloack and/or dscan immune. So DSCAN will not save you fron covert cyno who bring is cloacky friend to engage you if they are not on grid. 
---
So people will contineu to regroup and you will have more powerfull umbrella to reduce risk. 
---
Really stop ask CCP gold ammo and learn to hunt.
---
htfu brother
---
If only there were a little more risk involved rorq mining in delve.
---
\^ thats at least a microcosm of some of the safety they are trying to address.
---
Also the fact that cloaky campers are "baby tier safe" is bullshit. Like, lets not forget what a cloaky camper is there to do, and that is drop a fleet to kill a target "behind enemy lines" so to speak. Putting your fleet out there in someone elses space in someone else's home where they have the resources to defend against you AND the time to gather themselves to defend against you (why do you think the PANIC module exists) \*is\* the risk that hunters make. 
---
If they really sat out there and never risked anything then there wouldn't be anything to be afraid of.
---
You won't see anything in local unless you were in system when the message was sent
---
Wish Falcon could be so definite about other things like fixing citadel timers, cyno jammers, overpowered capitals, etc...
---
wth, have people figured out a way to right click jump remotely without being present at their computer?
---
Have you ever jumped into a wormhole and seen someone in local?
---
This is pretty much the best way to deal with local. Have it managed by alliances with fueled structures and entosis. 
---
Really there should be acl's for local just like any other structure. It would make no sense to allows enemies or neutrals to have access to an alliance provided asset like this. 
---
Can you imagine the reeeeeeeeeeessss and salt farming on reddit when this hits
---
Then apparently since they arent being banned they arent bots.
---
Okay obviously you're missing the point. Most of you people in null dock as soon as you get one person in local, i can literally stop your entire day by leaving an alt cloaked in your system, don't start, especially with that kind of broken reply and lack of basic understand of current coming events.
---
I’ll be blopping as many nullsec pussies as possible when the lights go out.
---
alestorm best storm
---
If anything, killing will become more skill intensive. As you've pointed out, the risk adverse Krabs are going to hide themselves under the large umbrellas. This may make it easier to hunt vnis and such, but capitals will become harder since they are now clustered toghter. 
---
The benefit of no local is that programs that read the local logs will no longer work. It will rely on good Intel in alliance chats to work. And good Intel in alliance chats is lacking to say the least. It takes away the almost perfect security that null sec enjoys now. Roamers are sued to barren waste lands in between the null blocs. Nothing new here. 
---
I actually want them to take it further, stop outputting perfect Intel to esi on how many rats have been killed, how many are active in system, docked in system, and how many kills per hour there are, etc. 
---
Null sec should feel like a lawless society where you only know what's going on when you're there.
---
Where's my killmail for the afk ship in space? Do you want risk, or do you just don't want any risk for yourself?
---
As a new player, the attraction is becoming a part of that storyline. Which corp/alliance will I end up in? None of that matters without the history. For me at least, this makes the history very much a part of the game. If I end up in megacorp II in a reset game, it would not have the same appeal.

The "bot theory". You know all people in 0.0 are not bot. Yes you have bot and CCP ban they.  And magically the majority do'nt live under umbrella, beacause unfer umbrella true player are unnahpy if they see bot and report they to they're management and/or CCP (and they 're mangement will just kik they near all case tyo avoid CCP problem).
---
SO under umbrella you can said no no the earth is a plan, but at end of the day they are true human who make intell.
---
If you can 't understand that you just proof you are terribly bad in this game at organisation level.
---
wingspan anchor deliveries?
---
&gt; Personally, the change seems one-sided in the favor of the hunters.
---
Tell that to the defence fleet that's properly scouted its nearby gates, and is now cloaked and aligned 500km off a juicy looking ratting carrier just waiting for the incoming gang to attack.
---
There does need to be something done about cynos though. This change will be much more balanced if cynos have to spool up, so it's not just an endless chain of decloaking, scramming, cynoing and instablapping with blops.
---
:thontking:
---
So no lcal will just make this 0.0 will become wasteland, and umbrella do'nt care (delve is perma camp since years by some perma camper... and people continue to farm beacause of umbrella). 
---
µthank to proof you don't know what you are speacking.
---
Spoken like a true ZKill warrior.  I guess Goons are shit since they got evicted from Deklein then.  Or does your logic fall through in that example?  
---
But, But the Casino War!  Unlimited, unassailable wealth!  Mittens was right!
---
You must not be familiar with the fact that CCP currently doesn't notify users of follow-up and takes a while to do those things on the first place.
---
Local is being blacked out, eve as a majority loves it, get over it.
---
oooh, that's a good idea. Combat Recons that deliver anchoring services lol. Anchoring your ship with scrams!
---
You've lost me now, all I'm saying is, TTT is setup great, it's been great having it undisturbed for I think nearly 1 year. If someone kicks it down, then I just hope they have the same longevity, and the ability to it setup as well as test. Last thing people want is to ping pong between structures every couple of weeks. I dont get anything that you have said re: getting fucked over, unless your retarded how can this happen, what specific thing are you referring to?
---
People who rat in Provibloc probably have had to adapt to a lot more interference than most.
---
I mean you'd be part of a new storyline. The corps of today are barely connected to the corps of 10 years ago.
---
Bought on all of my accounts the moment I read about it, easiest few quid I ever spent.
---
No - all null sec should have no local or have local, no separating it out by npc stations.
---
If he's afk, he is not a threat.  There is no risk whatsoever. 
---
A killmail is not the appropriate measure of risk.  Try again please.
---
But as soon as someone shows in local when you're in null sec, you can pull your drones. 
---
There's also programs that can alert you when someone is reported x jumps out or when someone enters local. 
---
If you lose an excavator in today's world, you're doing something wrong or youre just plain not paying attention. Rorqs are a little different since you are stuck for up to 5 minutes, but you also have a button that makes you invuln for a short amount of time. And again, you still have programs that can give you a heads up to say hey. Maybe I should dock now.
---
Null sec is more safe than high sec these days. Especially for big blocs.
---
HUGE missed opportunity here not making the local message "YEah they use asic miners these days". 3/10 post, could have been so much more.
---
He is cloak in the shadow , waiting at the right moment to strike...
---
Exooki continues showing up for the benefit of EVE players. 
---
Be prepared to cry as Exo handily beats all challengers in epic 24-hour Catan marathons, and bring your own TP and shotgun ammo (for the bears).
---
It's not like I'm building to sell, I build ships for myself.
---
Beacause you can ask for ESI of all alt to check if they are where they are suposed to be. And if when you ask for intel on system X or Y the guy/girl answer.
---
jokes on you, im awful at Catan.  
---
We have bear crew already, so everyone shouldnt need ammo.
---
Of course Goons are shit.  They admit being shit.
---
General advice:
---
1: Trust No One.
---
2: Don't touch yellow things.
---
3: Ships are like ammo; it's gonna blow up at some point and the goal is to make it last as long as you can.
---
4: Only undock with what you are comfortable losing.
---
5: Read the missions in the tutorial: one of them will bite you if you don't pay attention.
---
6: If it looks like a good deal, it's a scam.
---
7: Run the tutorial, the career agents, then the SOE Epic Arc "The Blood-Stained Stars."  Ask for help in local if needed towards the end of the arc: a few missions can be rough for new players.
---
8: No, really, it's a scam.

Cloaky camping is not a problem. It does not need to be fixed.
---
So do you.  The circle is complete. Thanks for playing.
---
I believe it's known as "spodbrain"
---
And the same current organised groups with the same FCs and the same knowledge of the meta and the same batphones and the risk aversion and krabs and 
---
like if you actually think Eve Classic in 2019 is the thing to make eve enjoyable again you are obviously high as fuck on the highest grade of industrial cleaner
---
We do blops in wingspan, but our main thing is diving wormholes.
---
I just recently got into flying the prospect. Looking at all the kill mail in people flying them I can't really figure out how people are catching the prospect when it's being used as a miner. Anyone have any ideas here on best tactics to avoid getting caught while in WH space?
---
You just proved your own point wrong.  Delve is camped all day and they continue to farm because they don't care.  So what's your point?
---
I understand the point you're making but it's not the same attraction. Even though things aren't the same as 10 years ago, they have evolved from that point. A new storyline would be less interesting in that regard to me. I do understand though that people who have played the game for years will have more nuanced opinions. Just wanted to offer my perspective :)
---
Cause that sounds "fun" lmao
---
You actually sound desperate to seem like everything will remain the same. Who knows if you're jumping into a counterdrop now? Who will see the other cyno? Will they already be there and no one knew cause the scout was shit? 
---
Your simple, hostile, "gold ammo" reply is the basis of what i feed off of. If you think everything remain as is once local is gone, you are an utter and complete fool. 
---
Sure you still have your supers and titans, but that's until the first time you get counter dropped in your own territory cause no one saw (insert group) coming in local.
---
The bots not docking because local doesn't blip and combat recons don't show in d-scan.
---
Do you have any fucking clue at the changes that are coming to your space? or are you crossing your balls and hoping for the best?
---
If I can't pve in complete safety in nullsec I'm quitting the game!
---
Can I have your rorqual?
---
Nobody rats in nullsec anyway. All bots. Can’t wait to see how many “real” pve’ers there are in null. Literally every account that stops logging is likely a bot account. Scrubs
---
Another enjoyable video!
---
You still need to grab Ashterothi or maybe some of the  arataka guys and do a lore vid about these drifters and stuff. I might be a tad biased though.
---
Not so much as you might think.  Most modelling packages offer cloud storage nowadays for precisely this sort of thing.  A modeller in Paris can have his work vetted and get feedback within minutes.
---
cloaky camping in itself is just psychological warfare, the broken mechanic behind it is that he can warp in anytime to light a cyno and you can't counter it
---
Bot anchoring and drydock delivery service?
---
gloryhammer is better than alestorm
---
cmv
---
Not onyl delve. All space with umbrella. 
---
So my point is ganker want easy target, and they cry when this people dock when they know they will just die. But they cry and run whent hey attack krab who counter attack and counter they're gank. 
---
So you can make the same song for "To the WH people who avoid fight"
---
Yeah that kinda seems unfair in the amount of dmg they do + the instant lock.
---
I've actually already interviewed Ashterothi for just that thing this weekend :)
---
I doubt it there's always retards and its better if they did that just means there's more stupid in one system
---
I'm disappointed that this isn't the sad piano cover of crab rave
---
Don’t be a pussy.
---
Your response makes less sense than the first.  Please stop posting.
---
Cloaks should not be unprobable imho.
---
You sound like unhappy beacause you jsut realize no local will not affect big group only little entity.
---
How bad are WH people of this subreddit in gameplay comprehension ?
---
Sounds like more fucking whining to me. I would tell him to HTFU, but Dunk is about as soft as a marshmallow
---
I think you mean an endless chain of getting scrammed, cynoing, and instablapping blops with supers that instantly teleported to your dominix
---
I don't agree that the local change will be as dramatic as you think, but very much appreciate your taking the time to create these updates - thank you.
---
stability doesn't mean just that it doesn't die lmao
---
Ooooh, yes!
---
I am so looking forward to that.
---
is your goal to document the 5 stages of grief with your posting
---
Yes but it's darwinism, "retard" unless they are the famous EVANNNNNNN MMMMCCCCCCLLLLEEEEEAAAANNNNNNNN will stop play when you will kill they 10 time in a row.
---
You play the game on easy mode and think you know a thing or two.   
---
laugh out loud
---
Upvoted for Turbo button reference.
---
Oh what systems are those in I’ve never seen that in any of the legacy space.  Lots of bots in branch and detorid tho.  Ccp definitely needs to fix the botting for sure.  We agree on that.  Did you call them out in local?  Report them as bots to ccp?  I bet if you even posted here the alliance admins would compel themselves to investigate.  Test intel channels are player fed.  
---
Adapt or die... huh... you guys love clinging to that mantra.  I would tell you that null is a different rule set than WHs, low sec, high sec.  it’s unfortunate that you believe that null must endure some punishment for enjoying a certain gameplay style you find boring.  
---
The simple answer is - these changes will not really be well received... will not have the intended consequences (aside from catching botters very early until they have a chance to update their scripts... adapt or die amirite)... these changes are tantamount to Hunter groups now having a home field advantage in their targets home spaces.   The null groups build the big coalitions because that’s the game they wanna play.  And Eve is great for that.  It’s great that you have your wormholes to live in and hunt out of.  I love seeing an odins call Sabre warping to the colossal out of a sig that spawned seconds before.  I love seeing marshys rage pings in the BB discord.  Gets me going!  Like ooooh baby bring it!   What won’t be fun... is having to replace excavators every single undock.  It’ll create a risk/reward calculus to swing against undocking.  
---
You’re just an angry asshole and can’t understand why others may enjoy a different playstyle.  You’re intolerant of that.  To the point of being completely toxic.  
---
I get you think this is like your time to crow here but sorry you’re just dead wrong and coming from a toxic place entirely.
---
Do you have a link to the message in question?
---
Pussy Whormoler want to end conversation when you proof to him the same song is true fror WH people ?
---
god forbid you need to leave the u-m gate for one day))
---
Alright comrade. Stop whining because people are now going to murderface your bots
---
I mean, i won't claim what Jeen is or isn't into, but we do fly with predds quite a bit lol
---
No ones asking for “complete safety” you completely miss the point with your 2nd grade reading comprehension ability.
---
&gt; until the first time you get counter dropped in your own territory
---
This tells me you have no idea what you're talking about, like most people on r/eve.  The ability to escalate is the key in nullsec, not the counter-drop.  
---
Are you going to commit to that?  Seems unlikely.
---
I do'nt care about bot. If you read the CCP report im in an alliance not listed in the big bot party. Stop you're bot theory. 
---
You are just bad at this game :o
---
1 hour is not a significant delay. And space should be just as dangerous for the hunters as it is the hunted.
---
Remove their ewar resistance bonuses. 
---
One side jumps in a big titan ball and the other side jams it with burst projection supers. What a nice bit of tactics in an otherwise boring n+1 shitfest.
---
"I'm worried about the effect no local will having on my cloaky camping enterprise. I have availability BTW".
---
Your posting is as bad as your English.  When did you "proof" to me that the same song is true for WH?  What statistics did you provide?  Do you even have a specific example?  
---
Go back to your botting empire, krab.
---
From a business standpoint, this could never happen. People are paying to develop their characters, not paying to eventually lose everything
---
They actually banned all nsfw content from alliance discord recently. Told everyone to take it into corp. We don't have a lot of that in our corp.
---
you may be right but [ye banished privateers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcYEpYtnvxs) beats both
---
A lot of WH player don't know the 0.0 mechanic , and it's why they can't understand why some change are bad or good. 
---
Let they discover that soon.
---
I appreciate the concept of a regular CSM update blog, but I'm not sure what point this specific update is going for.
---
&gt; While I welcome now content and new challenges, the Drifter attacks seem poorly communicated and the execution left much to be desired.  Risk vs. Reward is a key element of EVE and I felt that there was very little reward for very high risk.   
---
In the vacuum of "just Drifters" the risk versus reward is lopsided. But Drifter attacks aren't in a vacuum. They are adding substantial risk to an area of space that previous had lopsided rewards. They don't offer steep rewards because the rewards are what you're already doing in space.
---
&gt;Re:Blackout: Personally, the change seems one-sided in the favor of the hunters.  
---
Same here. Of course it's one-sided for hunters. That's because local chat intel has been one-sided for local residents for more than a decade. The balance does not exist within the change, the balance is the change.
---
&gt; hunters will have the ability to travel, gather intel, and execute basically undetected with no reasonable counterplay  until after an attack has commenced 
---
The counterplay is scouting, scanning, setting traps, utilizing resourcing like upwell gates and cynos to take advantage of the supercap umbrella
---
&gt; it's the best way a new player have to make some isk and pay his ships for fleets or pvp
---
Lol, as if actual new players are the ones running 10 VNI alts. A new player may be ratting in a VNI but he's probably also actually paying attention to the screen. Ratting is fine, if it has a reasonable risk/reward and reward/effort ratio; droneboat ratting on auto aggress under an umbrella has neither.
---
&gt; If you're making a combat anomaly with a drone ship even if you orbit at 30Km you'll have some rats out of range that will keep yellobox you, and that's make your drone idle, no kills, no ticks, no ratting.
---
This generally isn't the case in K-space anomalies. In fact, it would be a great change to make this the case.
---
&gt; First of all there is no AFK ratting
---
Maybe not technically but there are certainly a lot of people who rat with only one look at Eve every 10 minutes, which is close enough to AFK to use the shorthand.
---
Why?
---
Ladies and gents, I found a Hel ratter.
---
Idk its SP intensive and if OP hates scanning he wont have a good time
---
If just 1% of the ratters stay we will already tackle more then we do currently!
---
Roaming with local active may make you feel like you are not the only player around, but catching someone sitting in front of his computer is basicly impossible.
---
And those ratters that stay will be able to defend themselves, in delve those that have a cyno, in other regions maybe those capable of warping in combat ships.
---
Only very occasionally. They should do it as a matter of course if the parent ship is out of range or they aren't damaging it.
---
Jsut take this sub, coutn how many WH player cry after "super are to overpowered, me and my 2 friend attack a super with nano cruiser and he balp us".
---
Wow, I guess you really told me.  /s
---
This is very true and generally the people we gang up with. We have our own doctrines as well. Also have our own hunters, campers, and spies we work with for intel and content.
---
Yeahhh no you're not getting any sympathy. 
---
Nobody cares that replacing excavators is a pain. You're in nullsec, there's an explicit risk. You *will* lose things. If you can't balance the risk against the reward, that's on you. 
---
Your "style" defeats the purpose of "null" security and has turned the game into a stagnant swamp. That's why CCP is shaking things up. 
---
Everybody else throughout the game, all the resubs, all the mixups and new content, that's what's creating a bigger buzz than the game's seen in years. 
---
Your "style" is harmful to the game and the community at large, and trying to sell crocodile tears because you had to replace something which everybody knew was going to be lost by virtue of being used in that end of space just ain't going to work. 
---
So you can keep whining, the rest of us are looking forward to having some fun.
---
If there is a cyno inhib up people just cyno in 150+ km out and warp down. Increasing the range to 300km does not change that.
---
Not all of it's sp intensive, plenty to do as a new player, but that's why I'd suggest spoopy newbies. If wh doesn't work out, there's still Brave waiting to take them.
---
You can make a big alliance/corp feel small but you can't make a small alliance feel big. Highly recommend joining a big nullbloc. I've been in horde for almost 3 years and it's really the best thing.
---
You've got a pretty natural progression within the alliance. Horde =&gt; Blessed Bean --&gt; Vanguard. I put vanguard with dashed lines because I think you still need a vouch or to bomb a horde fleet or something, basically there's no set of reqs to meet for an automatic in like Blessed Bean.
---
Then beyond that people most often go to NC. or PL (just since we are pretty good buddies) but plenty of people went to skillu (rip), origin., and other ""1337"" northern alliances.
---
We are also moving into TKE and setting up a safe space for krabbing/PVE while maintaining neighboring Etherium Reach as a PVP zone that horde always has.
---
Some of the directors have that sorta "ugh god everyone is so dumb I have to baby you I'm so exhausted" attitude, but they're well meaning and run a good alliance.
---
Some of my favorite times are when some guys from THORN or other NC. corps come do some kinky shit with beans (like kikis or phantasm fleet Pog) and you get a taste of what a fleet is like with some of the most experienced players in the game.
---
There was this one guy who came and did this like "drink smoke arghhh" thing and he was so much fun. Think he was a thornie. Please do more bean fleets.
---
wtf
---
i have a counter exempel of that. NGSA campaign . In fact all activity was reduce during this campaign ... include PVP.
---
You want the big problem of no local in null? covert cyno.  Why ? Just beacause subcap will not be able to receive help in time. YOu covert cyno you're dscan immuine friend you are 30 he is alone. You kill him in 6 sec and run. 
---
And basically it's this mechanic who have created umbrella.
---
Deleting local still does not generate the content. I hope you come back with more ambition to find some frags cause its lame af to be a ping warrior.
---
&gt; But... BBTB is usually the dreadbomb himself? He'd be throwing a party rn instead of complaining.
---
Given how much times he spends crying on reddit for crabs i doubt hes actually ever boarded a ship with guns fitted haha.
---
If it's like J space it's (I think) 15 minutes.
---
Well they seem to actually like t
---
Rogue drones. They think they can lead them to salvation.
---
What’s a shame is how much that player created organization is shit upon.  As if it’s not an accomplishment in and of itself.   I’m not at all aware of “programs” all of our intel is player driven and reported by players in our alliance.  A human being has to be at the keyboard and has to report a neut/red in an ingame intel channel for others in the channel to see it.  
---
You’re 100% correct the rorquals have some “I win” buttons.  And yes as long as you’re at the keyboard you’re largely not at the same degree of risk.  They nerfed some of that - maybe not enough.  Not sure yet.  
---
Ultimately tho, a hunter group can wear down any rorqual, afk or not.  As long as you hold the grid that rorqual is on a clock.  Rorquals die everyday.  If not enough are dying to your liking... what’s that number need to be?   10?  20?  100???   Where are you happy?  N+1?
---
Wheny oua re cloack you can have intell about what people are doing in system, but you can't be killed. SO maybe time to introcude something toi hunt cloacky and bring back some risk
---
Never
---
He's a goon
---
So now I have to do the research for you?  No thanks.  I'll go ahead and mark this shitpost for what it is and move on.
---
The gallente who blops are probably pen is out, they joined up with snuff and learned the worst from them.
---
See one more Whormoler run away !
---
Because the wormholers only want change for changes sakes and want to impose their game on all of new eden.  Or at least upon 0.0 space.
---
RIP that makes way too much sense
---
i needed these new pirate music options in my life  
---
thank you
---
What is a "Whormoler?"  Is that something your mother does for money?
---
&gt;If you want stability use NPC stations
---
in the context of saying that, while also stating
---
&gt;If you want NPC-station stability but also cheaper prices you're living in a fantasy
---
the implication is that the citadel is only unstable as it could die.  If he had not mentioned the part about npc station stability but also cheaper prices you may have a point.
---
Guess we’ll see.  Won’t find my rorqs out.  Might find my shooty ships.  Hopefully you have some tank on yours.  You’ll need it
---
Ho you insult beacause you have no argument. 
---
You're tears are delicious.
---
There's tons of available targets outside of eso. Thats what jump clones are for. Even in eso, we get to shoot stuff frequently because others come here for content. Sometimes I drop a carrier, sometimes a titan, some times a super, and other times i feel like honor brawling in a thrasher or stratios or macharial. Don't let Veronica's kb fool you. I have well over 15 pvp toons. Just depends what's there and my mood and what the rest of test is doing.  We krab a bit in eso because we have like 10 or 15 individual humans that turn out t2 ships and capitals as easily as we do ammo. We sell them cheap in house so we can welp shit on the cheap and have a good laugh when we commit 10 or 15 dreads to die to goons. We expect people to be able to fly their own ship, but there are some comps that do work better with an anchor.
---
Why use VNI for small gang when you could use Gilas? Are you using sentries in a small gang or something?
---
Look up "Eve Uni"
---
There is a skill yoi can train that will increase your effec I've standing, if you haven't already trained it.
---
I've been saying this for years.
---
&gt; Hopefully, this change will help reduce the amount of botting that occurs, but I have no doubt that the bot software developers are already at work on a “no local” version.  That said, any work in this direction is welcome.
---
That's a bit ambiguous  =P
---
Eve Uni is a good introductory corp for new players. 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University
---
They have a high sec campus which supports new players in high sec and promotes high sec community.
---
Oh well aware mate.  I’m just saying what we get shit on regularly on here for.
---
&gt; I also like that my alliance has ISK to spend on us members.
---
if you think tapi income is even close to dependant on TTT i've got news for ya
---
While i do agree with this it's actually wrong. However the threads he keeps throwing out atm are bait after bait.
---
I stopped logging in once drifters could warp to anoms, now I'm only logging in for fleets until I run out of isk. But whatever man, you do you.
---
I'm *terrified*
---
Missions in eve suuuuuck IMO.  They aren't interesting and feel more like a chore to do(although I'm still pretty low when it comes to those missions.  I Just pvp)
---
What do you want to do for content?  Ratting, pvp, fleetops, ???
---
If it's missions, keep going.
---
you should join a Wormhole corp, they will fast track you to having fun and understanding the game
---
Hisec is boring. Do PvP in low or nullsec. Even tiny ships help.
---
I know you and I think alike in many issues, but I have some disagreements here.
---
Drifters on structures don't make null more risky. They make it take more effort to settle in. It's an manhour tax for alliances. Manhour taxes aren't always bad (think refueling), but it is too oppressive under the implementation so far. 
---
And we as hunters want to make null risky again because of the PvP interaction it fosters. That interaction is what keeps the hunting side in the game (and keeps them leaving when in decline). Other than that it's not a huge deal for us if people die to drifters every now and then or not. In fact, every ship dying to drifters is a ship that didn't die to players, potentially becoming content and a reason to play for fleets of tens of people.
---
About blackout, here is how we should think. Currently there are a bunch of players, who made their risk/reward calculations, and are farming. CCP dramatically increases risk. They will make new risk/reward calculation. For some, it'll be fine. For others, it won't be worth it. They will either dock and move their farming elsewhere, or they will take measures to reduce risk (mainly by moving under 3 major supercap umbrellas). So if CCP doesn't change in the reward side, and doesn't do something about umbrella mechanics, the change will yield a worse ecosystem, which there are even less potential targets for hunters than there currently is.
---
someone batphone the drifters. for the memes
---
Star Frontiers is the only good, worthwhile PvP corporation within TEST.
---
Great info dump, sir! Much appreciated and enjoyed @ work! Keep it up!
---
Sounds like dictator is trying to come up with a different way to say "im a blueballer and i dont fight" in different words, but its breaking his lexicon.
---
Oh no...its almost like...you have to play the game
---
Upset about the changes?
---
They are in a way resetting the game by removing people's abilities to make ISK. Changes to null space to try and kill off the large blocs. They no longer want people making ISK, but buying Plex. It's quickly changing from a sandbox to a credit card warrior game.
---
&gt; People want the chance at an escalation
---
no. they. don't.  
---
people want to gank shit.  elite pvpers run away at the first sign of resistance.  any sort of escalation and they will bail.  If you would stop running away like little pussies, maybe we would get a fight?  but if there is any risk, the 3-5 man roams disappear like farts in the wind. 
---
What kind of ship do you fly?  let me guess, some kiting ass nano shit so that you can run away if someone redboxes you.
---
&gt; Drifters on structures don't make null more risky. They make it take more effort to settle in.
---
I think we need to wait and see what the game plan is for Drifters. Because their intent or gameplay isn't known outside of CCP, we can't even be sure if they'll stick around, or even if their targeting parameters (which have already changed once) will remain.
---
What is pretty clear is CCP is using them as a lore reason to shake things up, first blackout and then potentially asset safety nerfs.
---
[Mess with other players](http://evedarklord.blogspot.com/2014/03/carebear-to-killer.html)
---
&gt; the implication is that the citadel is only unstable as it could die
---
no? this is literally a thread about the tax being raised, shouldn't be hard to figure out what other source of instability is there.
---
is your goal to actually steal a shit joke from Olmeca and play it off as your own?
---
I've lost you because you are thinking about this in terms of nullsec entities fighting wars. The biggest heists, fuckups, and disruptions in eve have occurred because a person or a few people decided to act. 
---
You're thinking about this in the context of another NS group coming in, destroying TTT, and putting up their own. I'm saying that the stability you think you have could be destroyed in _seconds_ by a single person who decides "you know what, I'm tired of this game, I'm shutting off the market and unanchoring TTT and you can all get fucked". If you think that (or some variation of "person decides to fuck over TTT customers") is unlikely - then you haven't been paying attention.
---
Exactly! 
---
I really think the people who are saying "this is a reset" are those with extreme tunnel vision sitting in seats of long time power.
---
I am what I eat bro
---
I fight when people don't run.  Like a lot of people. 
---
Interesting thing is you cry when people avoid fight you beacause you blueball they. And no you said im a blueballer.
---
So when it's you it's normal it's OK. When it'(s other player it's not normal.
---
Children reaction.
---
no, npc null sec should work as normal
---
If you're staying, and plan to do any hardcore mining, keep it.    
---
Running minerals back and forth in an iteron will make you kill yourself.  We have a corp one for that reason.
---
Up you go. Before the shitton of "join horde/karma/whatevernullblockcorp" posts come.
---
He spends most days trying to prevent dreads from undocking in NPC delve. When was the time he actually dreadbombed?
---
They're basically CONCORD
---
its less action than warping around finding an open haven / forsaken hub
---
So warp at range with a nulli'd/cloaky t3.  At best it would just delay a response, making it mostly a tool for bears.  Which is fine, I wouldn't object, but I don't see much use outside of that.
---
Please, if that's your opinion biomass and unsub.  People who aren't willing to risk anything belong in highsec.  Bots and stagnation in null are killing this game, even if no local doesn't create more content, it will kill the bots and thats a step in the right direction if you ask me.
---
He's talking nullsec
---
Yeah I know time will tell. But you know for CSM/NDA reasons I make a blanket assumption that the change is permanent for every change, before discussing it.
---
Oh ye of too much faith in me
---
Warp to 0 yolo or bust 
---
#LEEEEEEEROOOOOOY
---
never
---
if someone is cloaky camping and *wants* people in local to know he's there, its pretty obvious there's almost no risk. If there he was actually trying to hunt shit he wouldn't shit up local, seeing that should make you feel safer
---
Stop think the whole 0.0 is botter thank. 
---
It will not create bot. Just create some more. Someone who have 50 bot could have 2 more bot to check gate, and 1 to probe signature when they spawn.  Each bot dscan (beacause bot they do'nt care of spamming), and they regroup result. 
---
So you do'nt nerf bot, they will adapt faster than you think.
---
Sorry, but where's the OP talking from NS?
---
Focus on you. Do those missions. Train up a bit more. Don't just join any random corp, find one that fits you and your timezone. If I joined new today, I honestly wouldn't join a corp for at least 3 months... and definitely not a WH corp or a low sec PvP corp. Both are quite overbearing for low skilled and weak ships.
---
Well, that is until 6 months from now when CCP is shedding subs still. Maybe they will finally give resetting eve a go, starting with some ill conceived forced PVE event. They will then hint that the resetting of eve will possibly be temporary, depending on how it goes.
---
Haha same difference. https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/738/025/db0.jpg
---
WAT? You haven't played Camper Simulator?
---
well i allways link this  in local  if known gankers are around.
---
The ones who came back would just quickly leave again. Catering to people who have quit is absolutely horrible business sense. There is no realistic scenario in which this wouldn't be a huge loss of customers for the game.
---
It doesn't need a gank squad, a single frigate can solo a jump freighter. And jump freighters need to cross the universe, so they invariably go where local is not 0 players with no other option.
---
No it shouldnt
---
As someone who owned towers and actively fought over them, it was a lot more content.
---
Towers could be defended with batteries, neuts and screams. They shot unmanned - someone warp to your moon? You just got a new kill mail.
---
They also only had two timers, generally 16-32 hours from its siege depending on who stronted it. This gave people just enough time to form up but not call everyone in the fucking galaxy to attack. So you could wipe a constellation of towers in around 3 days with some dedicated work.
---
Now, 3 timers, a week wait. Constellations stagger times so it could take up to two weeks to kill all of them.. that and it's just not worth it. People are already fatigued as fuck from being forced into 30 min long sieges where 90%of the time theres zero resistance. Oh you missed a timer? Start all over.
---
POS'S had to be repped, stronted and all modules online again, so defenders actually had to go repair and refuel it.
---
&gt; did we got too many wow players hemorrhaging into Eve?
---
What? No, eve is just populated with normal people, and normal people are often not 'logical'
---
ffs cloaky camping isn’t a serious threat. It’s part of an equation. 
---
1=threat
---
0=little/no threat
---
Camper + camper’s fleet = 1
---
Camper - fleet = 0
---
Camper + fleet + defensive response = 0
---
Just undock. Be smart. Or lose a ship. It’s not that big of a deal.
---
More like people just don't put two and two together to realize that the current changes are not in the best interest of the players.
---
i believe the video of the trigalvian's "announcement" (link in this thread somewhere) specifically mentioned rogue drones must conform or be extirpated. Conforming presumably means removing whatever it is that gives the rogue drones a "mind". Less salvation, more rendering them once again a regular tool.
---
VNI nerf hasn't hit yet.
---
&gt; any sort of escalation and they will bail. 
---
Define escalation. You mean, you bring up another gang or subcaps, or a fleet of Muninns? Alternatively, if you escalate with 10 supers, we'll bail cause there is nothing a gang can do against numerous supers. Not our problem you forget subcaps exist and can't also fit fast tackle or put nano's on your ships (gasp) to re-engage us.
---
When i solo, i fly brawling ships almost exclusively. If i'm in a gang, then i'm in things that support the gang and can keep up. No one's going to be in a plated battleship in a gang for you to drop a super on, sorry buddy. If you can't keep up with an 1800m/s nano zealot, then you should take a hard look at what you understand about the game and need to think up better counters.
---
&gt;And I thought Eve Online Community would be mature and logical... did we got too many wow players hemorrhaging into Eve? Why do we waste CCP's time with crap questions like this? Go play WOW Classic!!!!
---
Oh, oh... CCP could, instead of resetting eve, just announce that tranquility is becoming an 'eve classic' server, and then ~~reset~~ ~~eve~~ make everyone roll new characters.
---
Just dump the bastion mechanics and make it an assault BS.
---
 updooted for song \^.\^
---
They want to remove the hive mind I think and make each drone a individual
---
The fact that drifters and no local were, apparently, poorly communicated only adds to the pleasure.
---
with referral link (you get 750k free sp) you are competitive from the first minute. lots of people can provide such links
---
Agree to all your "what needs to change to make Eve more dangerous" with the exception possibly of #3.  If fatigue comes back I'd rather subcap fatigue be less than what it was.... the larger the ship, the more fatigue.   but yes yes and fucking yes on #1, #2 and #4.  Supers/Titans should not be a reliable way to kill anything smaller than a BS ever.
---
what? a t1 bs is skilled withing weeks and can clear a c3 especially with that much help
---
wait he made this joke already?
---
fuck
---
&gt;l sec elitism that only got worse every, 'burn jita' or 'hulkageddon' event. Eventually the empire 'carebears' became hardened from this and the null sec grew into the passive safety of the blue blobs and now that someone comes to 'burn' them they realize they recruited all the empire 'carebears' that didn't adapt.
---
Riiiight. 
---
I would not go as far to say null sec players are elite in terms of skill at playing this game by any means. What they are 'elite' at is basic human organization and institution building. This is not going to change, even if you removed local and despawned every null sec structure.
---
yep I hope you feel good
---
yes huh
---
You can do the sisters of eve epic arc. That’s a funner mission set if that can be said for eve missions.
---
Oh yes miners are. This sub is filled with the whinging of your fellow rock hoppers. To deny that fact really does you a disservice.
---
&gt;Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart —you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you’re a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”
---
MALRO is a good high sec Corp. Check them out.
---
Which is why the first sentence is to fix freighters.
---
Its laughable how vulnerable they are. It makes zero sense that a frigate can take one down. And its silly how mandatory alts are for even using one.
---
They should be made cheaper too. If you run the math on regular freighters it takes thousands of jumps to pay for itself.
---
Sounds like a bargain to me
---
What salt lmao? I have an idea: let's reset highsec. Everyone who lives in highsec has all their shit taken away and gets to start over. U salty bro??
---
Get fucked lmfao
---
Guess you nerds are gonna have to cut in V0lta to your TTT, raise rates more?
---
actually Test lost one a month ago with five plus faxes on grid if I remember correctly      Fax nerf working at intended.
---
It's the Neut and fighters you have to worry about.
---
Heh, doubt it
---
yes.
---
I miss the AT :-(
---
Surprise 200 bombers came out of that cyno and you died! - Low risk item according to you.
---
You dont need Faction standing to open Level 2 missions, only corporate standing.
---
[one more for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9zcieO7Plw) enjoy ;)
---
Hyperion is very tanky for a t1 battleship. But if you go solo you are still extremely vulnerable to gangs
---
If TAPI could blue NPC corps they probably would.
---
What this would really do is split the already dwindling playerbase. You'd have some start fresh, you'd have some (most) decide not to throw away everything they've built, and you'd have lots that just quit. It would be a thoroughly disastrous decision for the game in general.
---
please stop bullying me :(
---
I wish I could make this
---
Ah. Didn't realize you were in test lol
---
We stopped using them after the vni nerf a few months ago. Wasn’t my decision I’m no fc, I just probe around find content and then we jump on it
---
Give it an ADC? Heh
---
I can confirm that this applies to all corps. My small five-man corp is only 20% active players!
---
I thought the shit in canada replaced this! 
---
Damn it! 
---
Y'all gotta announce this shit earlier or get ccp to announce it on the launcher.
---
Congrats on csm btw!
---
Good question, though we are far outside my area of expertise already (like on a different planet in another galaxy).  So assume anything I'm about to explain to be suspect or completely wrong.
---
The panel is far less complicated if you know its layout.  There are basically 3 buttons in a column for every video source, bottom to top:  program (on-air), preview (off-air), and effects enable.  Every 'row' of 3 columnar buttons represents a single MLE ('multi layer effects') engine, and there can be at most 4 of these 'rows' on a panel because human arms are only so long!  The last two buttons in a row serve as shift keys, to completely change the assignment, so it is possible to use a more compact panel (like in a truck) with fully-loaded 'frame' (server) with lots of sources or lots of MLEs.
---
An additional row of buttons with optional dot-matrix LCD mnemonic display above them is for custom controls, though they can also be called-up directly using the numeric keypad on the 'memory store' module.  Again, the last button in the row is a shift key.
---
To answer your question, my wild guesses, if they count:
---
1. There probably is a 'script' that is followed for a show, which indicates which one is to be used.
---
Using the custom control buttons, start on the left and progress to the right, hit the shift button advance the button assignment, then repeat if necessary.
---
2.  There is also automation product that can control everything from a PC in a more natural, and drag-and-drop manner.  Much easier to make changes on-the-fly, say with a news story that is developing and not scripted.  A show can otherwise be just pressing the spacebar like a PowerPoint presentation ... sort of like pressing F1 in Eve.
---
If you think it would be a good idea for CCP to just delete everything people have worked years to build, you are extremely lacking in foresight. Doing so would immediately kill the game. Who's gonna bother playing if CCP could just decide to delete it all one day because some highsec retards begged for it?
---
It's just about the most damaging thing you could do to the game, so I don't think that's an overly strong statement at all.
---
yikes
---
So active that he comments every 20 minute, on the minute, without a single second of variation.
---
You'd be spot on if I was a member of tapi. Unfortunately, I'm not.
---
so you can kill them
---
Or a bunch of leshaks at 0 in a wormhole fighting eachother
---
I hope you dont fit MJD's to your Nestors or Rattles, otherwise you deserve the anchor too and avoid all risk.
---
Wormholers are risk averse krabs too btw.
---
Deleted local gives me a chance to start an engagement without all the toons in system warping off to the closest station and just sitting there until I leave tho
---
In my experience nullsec ratters live through denial of content, I don’t know what ping warrior means btw
---
Nobody cries like highsec
---
not anymore damn man this hurts worse than the cancer I got from your posting
---
Pimple fuckers only really were active when no one else was active in catch. Partially because they are AUTZ and we are USTZ/EUTZ but partially because they would never actually fight just gank tuck tail and run.
---
Even if people were around to respond they would only attack you when they could kill you before response could undock. I don't consider ganking targets that can't fight back PVP as such (which is why i don't consider hunting VNIs a real PVP activity unless you fight the people responding to your presence.)
---
You couldn't just rat and make isk in anything bigger than a VNI because nothing else could escape it would just get blopsed and die before anyone could undock even let alone make it to you. Either way you lose. 
---
You ever try chasing 30 stratioses around with standing fleet comms where said stratioses can hear everything you try and say and see everything you try and put in chat? Shit gets old *fast*.
---
    Corporation friendly-fire is now a legal act
---
    Corporation ftiendly-fire is now a legal act
---
I feel like i am missing out on some fun by not being in Wingspan or not being full time in Wormholes. It's like another league of meme potential being missed.
---
It's an Azbel, they go on the market for about 4.2b isk, with setup probably 8.5-10b at the most.
---
I hate to say this, but to Volta and especially tikktokk this is pocket money, it's nothing.
---
Even if he doesn't recoup his investment (and 1 day over the week-ends will see to that), the citadel is simply not that big of a loss.
---
The hero we deserve
---
So eve online, but playing other games waiting for content? **Thrilling**
---
While players may hunt in a group, as someone who has solo'd with battleships often, you normally only need to neut out or kill 1-2 ships to escape. If an inty points you (initial tackle in 90% of the situations where you're krabbing), neut it -&gt; warp (not to a citadel) before the gang lands. With a neut domi, you have enough neuts to neut 1-2 ceptors at the same time and MJD out of any remaining long points.
---
Of course, this assumes the krabber has any kind of combat experience other than shooting defenseless NPCs, but might be a good learning experience for them.
---
Back when i lived in null and krabbed, i just did it in a 1400 machariel (back when pirate BS were all the rage for krabbing). Sit 100-120 off the beacon, split guns and volley 3-4 ships each wave. Anytime something warped in, i'd be off the beacon and could escape easily (or take pot shots at it). People could go the ol tried and true cruise raven/barg that wormholers use and just sit 200-300km off with FoF cruise missiles if you want afk gameplay again. Ofc, krabs only think that drone ships are the only useable ships for PVE insted of thinking of ways to counter people warping into your site since that takes effort.
---
I'm convinced people who say that don't actually like the idea but they've pissed so much time and money into the game they'll justify anything to keep it alive. Seen it with other MMOs that have adopted shitty monetization and that's the only way I can rationalize it.
---
It's a complex topic. The basics of it are, most pvp entities live in 5-5s. If you live in a 6 with a 5 static, you can roll your static to find content, but if you're in a 5-5 you can roll your static AND others can roll into you. Combine that with C5 space being a much more active farming space meaning more potential to murderize site runners, and you've got a good summary.
---
sure - but why play it in null sec when the isk is garbage and requires more effort than more lucrative alternatives?
---
Its the least significant difference
---
Have you ever been on any actual fleet? Almost all of it is either waiting in a station, or waiting on a gate, or waiting on a titan, or waiting for a scout, or waiting for your ship to land.
---
EVE PVP has always been 90% waiting and 10% action.
---
But I’m not.  Careful how you generalize dude
---
You are overthinking it.
---
The appeal of his structure is in the PLEX market, which has a staggering volume of isk traded.
---
0.1% means that he is clearing 3m+ isk for every 500 PLEX traded, which can be remotely moved into plex vault and around the galaxy, the only item with this unique feature.
---
As long as the citadel lives, as long as the market sub is up, he will have clients.

It's what the call an high sec carebear, everyone is welcome, minimum effort required, we touch all game aspect and we offer a lot of service, but on top of that we have a lot of fun in game together
---
The point about people seeking greater safety under a super umbrella is exactly what I think will happen. Small entities will die out as people leave to join the 3 largest null blocs so they can continue ratting I expect. I hope not but it's what I think could happen if it's ever made permanent
---
Tying local to your gate cloak might be a better option or delaying it by 30 seconds
---
I meant in this thread.
---
Thanks!
---
depends what you mean by blopsing, if you mean dropping blops bs no, if you mean bridging covert t3cs then yeah but itll prob just be another doctrine instead of the focus of a corp, the same for bombers.
---
there is bombers bar i guess for bomber npsi
---
stay away from nullblobs saying they "do blops" or they have sigs, those are all comically bad and are only doing blops cause they just trained into a blops bs and want to use it, regardless of it making sense or not(or they enjoy waiting on a bridge an pressing f1, but with a covert cloak i guess). predditors are *especially* shit from my experience. 
---
A few ls groups kinda do blops too like snuff but that's less because its effective and more because they dont wanna log their titan in. Some specific groups at times supercap hunt with blops but honestly if you need to ask about them odds are you're not getting in, at least the ones I know of are pretty exclusive for people that know each other, or they're russian, or they're both.
---
tldr: blops bs are shit and have no reasonable use in the current vni/domi-&gt;carrier meta other than being able to bridge, don't try to reenact black sails, that ship has sailed.
---
Because Fox didn't know how to treat it properly. Skipped the original pilot to air the 2nd story first, dropped 3 episodes completely, airing the original pilot dead last. The rest were out of order too, though it probably mattered less than introducing the characters at the end of the season.
---
I really wish it'd been picked up by another network though.
---
Ty for content. o7
---
I like my marauder the way it is, a blingy PvE boat that has some cool shit that goes along with it. Would much rather they just introduce a new line of T2 battleships than change Marauders. Don’t see the need at all to take away the niche people use them for now.
---
Fuck that turn it all off
---
They could leave cloaking as-is as long as they balance it by making it so you can't actually do anything useful while cloaked... Maybe they could make an exception for a few specialized ships and let them warp or something...
---
I haven't had blops dropped on me yet. I've had blobs of people shipping up while holding me tackled with punishers and logi, and I've had a couple supers dropped on me. Not sure whose super alts they were. Probably more snuff blues.
---
I have not seen nearly as much honor and niceness in the cal/gal wz as a whole lately. All the cool people in gal fucked off to Legacy in nullsec.
---
hey look another highsec citadel killmail coming
---
brb downloading Alestorm's entire discography.
---
Aha 😉
---
Hahahaha nice joke...
---
Was it ever irrelevant?
---
This is why alts exist. You don't tell me, and I don't ask.
---
The only thing I expect is that we have no blues (alts are not blue) and that you abide by what we do. 
---

In game channel "Wing-DS" ;)
---
Nah, goonswarm
---
Boo hoo "criticizing any non-white for any reason is automatically racist", fuck off
---
Seen this before Matoooooooooo, DAMMIT MATOO!!!!!!!
---
To make things interesting, they could set up a different server with much faster skill leveling where everything gets rest ever month or quarter or so. And maybe let people unlock skins and other comsmetics for the main game via their progression and achievements there. Has Something like that ever been suggested?
---
sim
---
its ok if you read my posting enough you develope immunity
---
Just slowboat through Provi with a battleship and you'll get hotdropped in no time.
---
Yes because highsec is so much better, mining for 10m/hr and listening to carebears whine in local about dumb shit
---
I don't because of that. It's just that I understand the situation.
---
Sometimes you break promises, because you have to... A mistake was made, and now there were two contradicting promises. One had to be broken. So well, why not break the one that gives you less stress and more isk? You lose the "no promises broken" anways...
---
Nein
---
&gt; I used to do 'ratting'
---
CCP killed this, vast swaths of the game are now on pirate missions - because CCP has no plans to nerf that form of krabing. 
---
Stay away from chopblock activities such as anom ratting. 
---
Another great form of PVE would be running filaments. This is the PVE CCP promotes and would like all players to partake in. Endless incentive and on the development focus of PVE for some time.
---
Find out which of these activities fits you
---
The blackout has got me resubbing all accounts, but I wouldn't say no to some free stuff for the krabs to cry about being too scared to log in to recieve!
---
Oh (
---
I do not feel sorry for you.    
---
Step 1.  Roll the hole(s).
---
Step 2.  Siege mode, let lose the mining bots, get that SPOD baby..    
---
step 3.  Throw you beer down because a new signature just popped up in the wormhole.    
---
Step 4, Wait in agony at the 37 hours it takes for the rorq to siege down waiting for 94 Sabres to show up on d-scan.    
---
Step 5.  Fucking wandering frigate hole...    
---
Welcome to my world.
---
"I'm mad so I'm gonna go pay more money and cut my profits out of spite" Lol.
---
yes because nullbabbys ruined eve
---
wormholes are the only place left worth playing in
---
Blackout is getting me to resub. Maybe
---
The thing is, a mistake was made. And there were two contradicting promises. Equal vote in the consortium to management matters and not raising the tax...
---
Well, either way, he would break his word... But one does not end up in daily fights (in the middle of a current war) and also it provides more isk. Yahh, well shit, the nimbus of "no broken promises" is broken anyways. So why not go with the least annoying one?
---
&gt; The point about people seeking greater safety under a super umbrella is exactly what I think will happen
---
This already happened with miners during Rorqual changes. Now it will happen with ratters. When you can't rely on local as a safety mechanism, you will choose the other safety mechanism.
---
Solution? Limit the amount of farmers one can stack in a single umbrella.
---
Yes.  Because they spoke in local before.
---
Do I win a biscuit?
---
Small update the Jita Cam will be running a small poll until 7/14/2019 7PM EST. The alliance with the most votes with have their logo featured on the stream for a whole week with a slogan of your diplos choosing (RIP if Test wins). Good Luck!
---
Probably just 1d over the week-end. :)
---
People will just use combat recons to avoid that.  Stfu krab.
---
Winner winner chicken dinner. Haha
---
m
---
except they will log in to claim the rewards... you don't have to even log in,just open the client.
---
I don't think this represents eve. As soon as the new players were treated like a resource the games learning curve became very easy.
---
You are overthinking it, most ppl just like to see some shit stirred up. :)
---
Well the ADC is more something to gtfo but marauder pvp usually looks more like long-term in pvp-terms ... so it would not really benefit from a 15s high resist push. If you need it, it's probably because you're breaking otherwise, so it will basically just extend your life by 15s...
---
I don't really think that many people are planning on not logging in. It's really not as big of a deal as people are making it out to be, it's just less free intel. You'll still be vulnerable to spies, hotdroppers, etc all the same just with a higher chance of a loki decloaking while you're running your haven.
---
.
---
*considers rewards for krabbing, mining, and otger activities in space*
---
Nah, you just made a retarded suggestion tbh.
---
Run along and call your mum to tell her how clever you are
---
Again, it doesn’t need to last long, just long enough for the cyno
---
Can I bring my MAGA hat and my shotgun?
---
a goon complains about delayed local, news at 11
---
and if they're null sec exclusive, can you imagine the autistic screeching from everyone?
---
"fix freighters" is more easily said than done. :P
---
Can I get next week's lottery numbers fam?
---
are you talking to yourself now
---
\&gt;adverse
---
You won't get it, this is why i don't recommend call/gall warzone, snuff lives there, they drop supers/blops and pen learned from them to do the same.
---
This is why the area kinda sucks, amarr/minnie is slightly better, overall lowsec just sucks atm and it won't get better because august is the lowpoint of eve activity and is coming up.
---
Umbrella? For a subcap?
---
No one do that, it's useless, the subcap (even a BS) will be dead long before anyone will jump or provide any help.
---
Risk/reward/effort ratio is completely ok for a single char, max 2.
---
The problem is extreme proliferation, people with 10 or more accounts.
---
Why people is able to do that?
---
Injectors, here we are back to the root of all problems...
---
There could be plans for an EVE 2.  you could have EVE and EVE 2 running at the same time.  Honestly its what i would of been making a while ago...
---
&gt; As it stands the only reason people don’t use it for PvP in a doctrine is because it’s not cost efficient. The problem is the cost to produce them, not so much the mechanics of the ship.
---
This is completely wrong. 
---
It is exactly the mechanics of the ship that prevents it from being a good fleet ship. Being stuck in place and not able to be repped means it will never be a fleet ship, and it doesn't do enough DPS to be used like dreads.
---
Lmao, you're a goon shut the fuck up
---
The problem here is not the semi AFK in subcap which will provide relatively low reward, but a guy with 10 or 15 accounts which is insane.
---
Why he was able to do that? Injectors...
---
Yeah no.
---
Cynos might be new to you.  But not to null
---
Uh. As a hunter...
---
How about the fact that you have had a local since the beginning as free intel. Or the fact that you guys have intel channels where people just look at local and report your position to everyone in channel. How about the fact that cyno inhibs take 60 seconds to online, but everyone now fits a cyno on their [insert krabbing capital here] and automatically light it when tackled (even if there is no one ready to jump in) and have 10 fucking minutes to figure out how many FAX/Titan/Supers they want to drop on a 10-man gang. Remember when HIC scrams went out to 40km+ and Carriers could apply perfectly to subcaps with fighters? I remember because that was a time period when a lot of small gang people gave up on CCP. How about the fact EVE has a massive botting problem and clearly doesn't have the desire to fix it directly, and this does address that problem indirectly. 
---
I can keep going... How about the fact that HAW dreads exist and eat up small gangs and everyone drops them now. How about the fact carriers can completely do every role a subcap can do through support fighters. How about the fact you have jump bridges AND no jump fatigue with them, allowing you to travel through space immensely faster than everyone else. How about the fact you have a massive defensive advantage with citadels and have spammed them on every fucking stargate mostly on low power and named them XYZ GATE PERCH for more free intel. Go put someone in those perches my man, you already are all ready for blackout, you just can't be lazy about it anymore. How about the fact citadels removed outpost service entosis which was a great fight generator.
---
Or the fact that this game has turned into Capitals Online, and small gangs don't get even the old blob versus small gang subcap fight anymore. How about the fact we've been told ADAPT OR DIE, or HTFU when we complain that CCP has incrementally made small gang harder to do year after year. I want the game I signed up to play that meant every ship mattered, every ship had a role to fill an each pilot contributed to the fleet.
---
CCP has systematically killed small gang with so many dumbfounded moves. And now you the nullbloc person is upset that this change is biased by favoring hunters. 
---
As a small gang person, you have no sympathy from me as I've seen the gameplay I've come to love destroyed over the last 10 years and so many friends quit EVE.
---
If they reset null, or eve itself, including assets, skills, alliances, I won't be coming back. Ending story. And many more won't.
---
Those aren’t the sugar free ones tho
---
You can disagree with that, doesn’t take away the rest. Marauders don’t need to be changed to fit a different role when you can introduce new ships to fill that roll.
---
Moon schedule ?
---
Well, for starters, you are ASSUMING that the blackout will lower concurrent player counts.
---
Also, you are assuming that PA isn't aware of things CCP is doing.
---
Cloaky ships can get the jump on you pretty easily, but there are a few things you can do to not get attacked (it's impossible to be 100% safe though)
---
1. Are you on the keyboard? If you're afk or semi-afk, expect to lose the ship eventually.
---
2. Are you always aligned to a safe spot? If you're not aligned, someone has plenty of time to uncloak and scram you. If they dual-scram, you can't escape them even if you only fit stabs. Some setups could even bump you out of alignment, giving them a few precious seconds to scram and kill you.
---
3. Are you spamming dscan? Will you notice a cloaky ship or not? You need both luck and diligence to spot a cloaky ship on dscan.
---
4. Where are you escaping if you see a ship on dscan? A citadel? A safe? Your exit wh? They might know where it's likely you are warping to and bubble the path with a dictor. They might even be at your exit wh and chase you/bubble and kill you.
---
A way where there's nothing you can do is the smartbombing proteus. It can uncloak, activate all of its smartbombs and instantly deal damage. They can pop your prospect instantly and there's nothing you can do. The only way to evade this is if you see the Proteus on dscan and instantly warping to safety.  It's a very niche, not really used fit though, since it's 1bil+ to only pop frigates, so you will rarely see this.
---
By mining, are you talking about mining ore or gas? If you plan on mining ore, you're better off getting gas instead. A single trip of wh gas is worth 5-10 trips of ore.
---
It'd be a nice way for them to help a lot of us win EVE for good.
---
Yup, for most people only the first few days will be more dangerous, while hunters are all excited about the new possibilities, just to kind of get bored of the dscanning and go back to their day jobs.
---
Once it's back to just the normal groups hunting in nullsec, then I think most ships will pay themselves off before they die even with minimal attention to security.
---
Really cool, thanks for the info!
---
**warp in**
---
oh look, there's a bubble... and a bunch of jetcans... and a bunch or rohks.
---
I fully support this
---
This is how we know you're a disconnected bittervet.
---
The game is still extremely difficult to get a grasp of for new players.
---
Well this way you get less isk, and you get to play azbel wackamole for the next few months :)
---
Not arguing against that. Its a well known fact that NS is really secure. But removing local doesnt add risk in that sense, it adds uncertainty in another way. And people wont like it which means less people are going to be found in space. There are better ways.
---
Besides, NS just got hit with 2 major nerfs less than a month or so ago. Keep nerfing it and people will find a new and safer way of making isk.
---
&gt; Bastion gives you aggression - this basically makes it impossible to de-aggress since you'd be just killed under the damage outside of Bastion. It forces you into a state where you have no choice but to fight even when it's a losing battle. Isn't it a defensive module as well?
---
stop playing station games.
---
This would be an incorrect statement.
---
&gt; stupidest thing ever
---
Not the first time ccp has done that.
---
Based on the number of "returning to Eve, what's new" threads from the last couple of days, I doubt that's going to be a problem.
---
I don't disagree with the rest. I love my Golem in PVE.
---
Go in wh space. Dont stick around in hs unless you run incursions and ded sites..or have a big ol mining fleet. Even l4 missions suck once you get the right tools.
---
You obviously haven’t been reading Reddit lately.
---
This, but also fuck nerds dual-wielding credit cards to advance in an economy based game. Unassailable wealth generation like mastercard needs to stop and the advent and success of capital+ anom ratting partially addressed this and put entities who bought their supers out of commission via mass proliferating supers beyond what their mastercard could bare. RIP black legion.
---
Eve Online is goofy beyond measure
---
Yeah but how would you limit the number or farmers? Reduce the anoms or?
---
But I do agree
---
Me too, I genuinely like flying my marauder(Paladin) even though I could be doing the same in a carrier with more safety. I think the extra risk is part of the fun in flying it, tbh
---
So cloaky campers now need to type in chat every once in a while. afk cloaky camping confirmed dead thx ccp
---
lol, well that won't last long.
---
More stupid than deleting boot.ini and resetting my pc ?
---
If you want to fly solo and not whaling/ganking, get a frigate. Anything bigger than that tends to get blobbed. Battleships are the worst, you will always get attacked by a small gang. There's a slight chance you can find fights with a cruiser or battlecruiser, but you'll probably have to fly very kitey and fight gangs regularly.
---
it only reveals you to people that get the message.
---
I think only as a bittervet are you qualified to answer this question.
---
I could start an account now this second and by end of the day be in a null sec corp crabbing. With my first ships bought and paid for and a steady income from salvage.
---
So I say again once new players became a resource for the powerblocs to they hoover up. Yes it is easier for them.
---
As a resident, dscan won't do JACKSHIT for you. You don't need to spam it. Because if you do, you'll be in complete panic mode ALL FUCKING DAY long, because some people from your alliance roll through the system you are ratting in. 
---
You rat in a super now and light the beacons if shit goes down, or you'll be ratting in a Myrmidon, ready to reship when shit goes down.
---
No exceptions.
---
James315 figured that out years ago.
---
Reduce anom respawns.
---
Can someone explain to me how exactly you use a cyno?
---
Do you have multiple jump clones you jump to and make a cyno field outside and then go back in, clone yourself to your jf and then warp? How does this work? Do you need seperate accounts for this?
---
Not everything needs to be fleet ships lol
---
&gt; As it stands the only reason people don’t use it for **PvP in a doctrine** is because it’s not cost efficient. The problem is the cost to produce them, not so much the mechanics of the ship
---
He mentioned it wasn't used in a fleet because of price, I addressed that it's not used in a fleet because of mechanics. 
---
Solo, bait ship, or even fucking around with small gang stuff they are perfectly fine for.
---
All this time, we thought the ratters were the bots, when it was the cloaky campers all along.
---
&gt; the broken mechanic behind it is that he can warp in anytime to light a cyno and you can't counter it
---
Other than blowing up the cyno. Lighting your own counter cyno. Having friends to help defend you. 
---
Hmmm. :thinking: Almost like you CAN counter it...
---
Too late bud, it's getting fixed :) Bye bye local.
---
*warp out* 
---
Good thing I'm nullied and warped at 100km.  Guess we need to see if the response fleet is set up to handle this, or we've got enough dudes on to reship, or we go flitting away.  
---
Or, more likely, *warp in*, it's fucking nothing!  The bears saw the probes (and the sig spawn) and, being smart bears, have already fucked off!
---
I don’t know, it’s barely more relevant than this conversation/thread
---
As long as you live near Perimeter, its not a big deal to fight over the area.
---
Sorry, couldn't resist.
---
PLEX can immediately be sent to the vault and don't have to worry about asset safety.
---
Bring something engagable and roamers will fight dude.
---
"hurr durr im gonna use this flair to bait people because everyone is dumb and im smart, dont people know me, hurr durr, the alliance i have the most kills in is test, hurr durrr, im in skill u we dont blob, durr hurr haha hurr durr"
---
make them carry ammo.
---
&gt; When should I join a highsec corps? 
---
Never?
---
[Aideron Robotics](https://www.aideron.org) is recruiting.
---
It's more of a representation of the endless amount of items and mechanics in the game that constantly change well as the new that gets introduced.
---
Sure, YOU could do that. I could do that too.
---
But we both have a lot of knowledge about how to play the game that a new player doesn't have.
---
Yeah, that's probably a pretty accurate description unless you start putting unique identifiers in ship names like wormholers do.
---
It adds risk which is then multiplied by uncertainty.
---
I'm not saying it's a perfect solution, but we could see how it actually changes in time.
---
Well, since you have more people in that region than anywhere else you're going to have more losses. Quit being a whiny krabber.
---
Of course it will.
---
Look at what the player count was when chat was fucked and we had no local
---
I say either do it all or dont do it period.  Meaning if you are going to have a system of no local do not create a problem than the fix.  Let it be gone or do it for short periods as events please do not be the developer that creates a new system that will not change the meta.  Shit or get off the pot.
---
What,where?
---
HUEUHUHUHUEUHUHUHUEUHUHUHUEUHUHUHUEUHUHUHUEUHUHUHUEUHUHU
---
&gt;The game is still extremely difficult to get a grasp of for new players.
---
Not really. A few of my friends started playing recently, and based on what they've been asking about and saying, it's absolutely nothing like it used to be in terms of difficulty to get into. There's so much presented right there to them where they can relatively easily find it, including sources like the eve university wiki, that the learning isn't all that bad anymore.
---
Lol ye. Then our dear friend Tokk can explain how unforeseen circumstances forced him to raise it.
---
Oh wow. Is this the best you could do? It shouldn't take much of any time to ban a known bot or input broadcaster. CCP spent millions of dollars on new hardware and tou sont think they didnt spend a bit of money on a dev server to read logs? You must be one of those stupid managerial types who knows nothing of programming or IT.
---
True and I am not saying the learning curve is easy but... it is not like it is described there. It is a lot less punishing now and while steeper then the others granted, it is not near as bad as depicted there anymore.
---
Highsec corps are the purest form of garbage in the game outside of E-Uni, gtfo of there
---
You mean the ones you copy from dscan and put into your own shipname, yes?
---
Yes, as they added in a decent tutorial, the agency window, removed learning skills, and a whole pile of new features which really made the learning curve comparable to a lot of other MMOs.
---
Not sure what you're on about. I don't understand how the above would be flairbaiting as I never mentioned tapi before the commenter below my comment brought it up. I just never bothered to change the flair as I rarely use the website and haven't found an easy way to change it in the app I'm using.
---
&gt; Drifters on structures don't make null more risky. They make it take more effort to settle in. It's an manhour tax for alliances. Manhour taxes aren't always bad (think refueling), but it is too oppressive under the implementation so far.
---
Drifters can be ignored. They don't show back up at timers.
---
The risk is that you ignore the drifter and then players show up at the second timer.
---
This has been posted twice already.
---
PIRAT was hired to defend TTT ever since it originally anchored. Did you guys do no research at all before you started this endeavour?
---
You are cluttering the issue with facts! 😂
---
Warp to Me is a Shield-newPlayerFriendly group that I always enjoy to run with
---
Since when the ADC is a gtfo module?
---
Technically, Mint, but that's based on Ubuntu. The user interface is much better. For regular laptop use I find it to be the easiest to pick up and use, especially since I had a fair amount of experience with the Raspberry Pi so sticking to a Debian derivative is very convenient for me. I never really had an issue to compel me to dive in to Fedora or Arch, though that may change
---
Then all the bitter, shitty COD/Fortnite players from /r/gaming can swarm into Eve- for about a week, get bored, then leave- Game's dead bois.
---
There also is nothing to gain being cloaked.
---
Mittens never made a promise to not raise taxes in a highsec structure he created.
---
No, because that doesn't happen
---
&gt;An item will become cheaper as it becomes necessary and more manufacturers start making them
---
And the lie detector determined that was a lie. A rarely used item will often sell around buildcost, as a way for builders to turn their materials into isk, and slowly liquidate parts of their mining/pi efforts through a wider range of goods. Increased demand can often mean an increase in price in eve, as you're not doing everything you can to try to get -any- sales, but can start going for what people are willing to pay, and get yourself some added profit too.
---
Giving up controlling vote is just as bad as raising it yourself.
---
but they don't do any blops drops
---
&gt; With the removal of Local, people will be relying heavily on dscan to keep themselves safe. 
---
No, they won't. They live there, it's busy, people warp around and change system all day every day, you'll go crazy if you rely on dscan as a null resident. 
---
You have to see dscan as permanently hostile, both as resident aswell as intruder. The VNI that's called ISKmaster3000 and has been calmly ratting along you for 3 weeks? It's probably some dude roaming in a VNI with heavy tackle and a cyno that copy pasted a random VNI name.
---
Famous last words
---
My prediction - people will use drone boats like Myrms and will be okay to losing it.
---
&gt; if there is a product that is not in high demand, but not many suppliers, that product could actually be made cheaper by an increase in demand but only after more suppliers enter the market,
---
That's not at all how it works in eve /js. Things are often sold at buildcost if demand is super low. With higher demand, your production costs don't deminish, so the product can't be sold any cheaper.
---
What.
---
https://www.reddit.com/comments/64jxtb
---
think you mean 10x
---
Well, Vily voted as promised. So still, why hate Vily and not Mittens?
---
I don't think he was implying that Test's income is solely from the TTT . However it has allowed us some rather lovely alliance level subsidies as well as all the usual things the alliance finances; SRP, infrastructure and the like.
---
very different situation.
---
Eh no. There are plenty of thread/chats/whatever that will direct you to a n00b friendly corp. But your right. See below.
---
N00bros with half a brain its a lot easier. Theres no helping stupid.
---
Example: My brother started an account around 2 years ago. He wanted to learn on his own so wouldn't accept help or even isk of me. He ended up in a newbro corp with goons and within 6 months had multiple BS was t2 logibro (could fit it for with t2 gear) and within a month have over 100mil in the bank. So yes it is easier.

There was a time where capitals didn't exist. You do know that, right? A new server would get a lot of new members hesitant to play catch-up. But I guess you're also a carrier ratter. Sad.
---
How does 48 hours seem **accessive**? It seems pointless, because you're practically never in one spot for more than a few hours anymore anyway, but I fail to see the problem with such a long duration.
---
No because that's not how wh local works.
---
You mean, players have to do research to figure out the game?
---
Sounds like that's virtually just as difficult.

Mom said it was my turn to post this today!

Generous how? When are you going to sit in the same place for more than a few hours a day, except maybe a gatecamp?

People afraid of proper change that introduces risk are the same personality as the “highsec carebears” so many null players make fun of.
---
To me, the true spirit of EVE is to endure risk and uncertainty, and come out on top after a bunch of failures.
---
Join a Corp and if you dont like it join another one and keep repeating till you find your home.  Dont linger alone grinding something you dont like for a moment longer.
---
Because he gave up controlling interest in the structure, knowing full well he wouldn't be able to stop something like this.  Its wouldn't even call it hate, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy and lies.  If Mittens made a promise and broke it I'd make a similar post.
---
Lmao, okay retard
---
can we stop with this bending of what low/high-class wh space is? 
---
its something very well defined, can you take caps into them? if yes its high class, if no its low class, c1-c4 is low class and c5-6 is high class.
---
The classic completely unhelpful reply. Thanks, u/case_8!
---
&gt;a goon ~~complains about~~ celebrates delayed local, news at 11
---
I mean. Not pick of destiny though
---
Man you really showed him. Or something.
---
It actually was not. If I punch you in the face, on purpose or accent, you still got punched in the face. And no, you would do shit about it either way. Maybe go home (log off).
---
Just use AT ships to PVP and not be cheap.
---
Si
---
Well the more annoying CCP makes isk generation for players the more botting there is going to be.
---
Afk cloaking is stupid, this isn't the solution though.
---
It is definitely from the movie pick of destiny
---
Just gotta point out, it's pretty obvious you do care, otherwise 
---
a) You wouldn't be replying
---
and more importantly, b) You wouldn't be asking him to stop.
---
If you legitimately didn't care, you wouldn't be replying.
---
That’s some of the lamest crap ever. You’re so full of sh*t you squish when you walk.
---
Just grabbing a shitfit heron and running through wormholes with no knowledge of what a high class hole or sleepers are is going to get you 100 mil in a week. Once you learn about those, it’s closer to 100 mil an hour, and no worse than 50 even accounting for bad skills and ganks. 
---
So a new player taking a month to get 100 mil is definitely a sign of a pretty steep learning curve
---
This may have been true in the past but hardly applies currently.
---
Not really. Probably 5-10% of chars in any 10 year old corp (that are active) were there 10 yrs ago.
---
Still, I'd imagine it'd be logistically pretty problematic if you find a R&amp;K-style pipebomb fleet chilling in your space, given that they can covert cyno around. At least until you can pin them down and kill them
---
I mean C5s are hardly hard to come by, I think the low class vs high class differences are much less than they were in the past.
---
Make it a ship module for a new class of destroyers.
---
Add a mobile cyno inhibiting battlecruiser while you're at it.
---
*please*
---
Why do people keep taking this old news out of its retirement home to trot it around? Poor thing.
---
The stories and shared memories are alive and well. People regale newer members and just because PL and NC aren't bob.. they are bob
---
It's from the single 'tribute' which was years before the movie. But it's also pretty much what the movie was about. I don't think they play the song in the movie though. 
---
Semantics tho. I love you if you love tenacious d and also hail Satan and fly safe 0/
---
Bubbles already do the same thing.
---
And if they don't, implement this the same way bubbles work.
---
Easy fix.
---
Gates exist.
---
I was playing unsubbing but i'll stay on and resub 2 more char since i saw the news. #hypedasfuckclub
---
I never implied that we were, but there have been several programs, explicitly funded by TTT profits, that go beyond what we used to have. Also, who knows if CCP manages to destroy the renting meta or not by making living in nullsec without active protection nonviable (I wouldn't be terribly upset btw.). Even then we probably wouldn't be 'dependent' on TTT profits but suddenly they become much more important.
---
We aren't going to give up on one of our most lucrative income sources when CCP seems to be hell-bent on shaking things up, even if we are generally in favor of that.
---
There are defenses, but the solution of having fleets waiting endless for an attack that may or may not be coming, doesn't feel like a long term viable way to keep players entertained. People on all sides get bored sitting and waiting in fleet for something to happen.  I don't think add more to that is in EVE's best direction.
---
It's actually was. A pothole filled with water is not a swimming pool. This is a purpose built swimming pool.
---
Not a WH corp btw
---
Happy cake day!
---
I'm not upset, just giving my opinion.
---
You bring up a lot of issues, and I don't disagree there's a lot to be fixed.  
---
If you want improvements to small gang, I'm happy to listen to ideas.
---
I’m ok with this. The point if cloaky camping to me was always to get them to the point that they (1) forget I’m there or (2) stop caring.
---
 No need any more, I can just blops without this extra two week long step.
---
&gt; It's really not as big of a deal as people are making it out to be, it's just less free intel.
---
For any given null resident, local is the biggest and most important intel you have. While hunters have access to broad sources like ADM levels, pilots in space, and ratting statistics, there are much fewer tools to recognize a potential threat before they have already arrived. Only halfway decent adaptation is likely going to be spamming eyes on as many gates as possible. Even then, all it takes is the pilot looking away from that client for just a few seconds and you could entirely miss the hunters.
---
&gt;You'll still be vulnerable to spies...
---
Funnily enough, no local makes the spy’s job easier too. How would anyone see the patterns if even your blues have no idea you’re there?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I’m not against the change, but it is by no means going to have anything short of a major impact on how null operates. It’s going to come with some good and some bad effects. I’m pretty sure CCP realizes this, and that’s why they’ve made it appear temporary for the time being. Hopefully they can account for the knee-jerk reactions when they are deciding whether or not to make it permanent or modify it.
---
In fairness to the bittervets, this was drawn at a time where the tutorial was
---
"hey you, go mine that rock"
---
"great!"
---
"now shoot that guy"
---
"awesome"
---
"You're tears are delicious" is something a bot would say.  Good bot.
---
With you there, was disappointed it was only 30 seconds each.
---
That's less of an issue these days. Hint: Alphas that can fly Feroxes are a thing.
---
I used a Rattlesnake.  Didn't care if it died, because everything I undock is already lost.  Actually never lost it.
---
In the second Drifter wave, they were attacking all structures, including jump bridges and beacons, which go offline if reinforced. 
---
That behavior may not be repeated, but in the second wave, we saw drifter reappearing in systems previously cleared.  At the time, there was no info on whether this was going to go on day after day until timers came up.
---
Then he's obviously a bot and again, not a threat.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Waiting out an unintended bug is very different than refusing to play because you disagree with a game design decision
---
Does this count as irony?
---
I don't meant to be ambiguous. The change will probably slow down botters, but I don't believe that it will completely stop them as the software will likely be modified to not rely solely on Local. 
---
Is that clearer?
---
What are you even talking about?
---
i too enjoy the kush
---
Botting is ok when gankers do it.
---
Didn't want to come across as whining.  If there's something else you'd like to hear about, let me know.
---
Wow you are stupid.  The ship has a Cyno it's the whole fucking fleet that jumps through that the kill mail
---
I'd say a soft reset of some sort maybee somthibg as simple as new gates and directions to spin null sec out a bit
---
But you have no idea if they are AFK or not. We say AFK because we ASSUME they are because they sit there for hours.  In fact many are NOT AFK.
---
As someone who Horde tags... do Horde give free ships to newbros? Pretty sure they do?
---
Trained? No.     
---
Injected? Yes
---
I have no problem with it being less I think 15-20min blue with 2-3 min red is reasonable for subcaps taking jbs.
---
They’d work really well until a cloaky tengu scrams you and lights a cyno, you mean
---
I want to play this game so badly!
---
My wormhole rattlesnake, and nestor was only able to escape getting tackled on a gate and dropped multiple times by the fact that with a cyno, covert cyno and cloak with tank the camper could not fit a scram only a longpoint.
---
But losing my ratting ships before they are paid off means that i have no isk to pvp with. This is the balance shit that i think people like you don't understand. My legion doesn't buy itself, i have to rat isk up to pay for it when it dies.
---
Why would they? They surely run a multimillion dollar company that is willing to take the long view on a revenue source
---
First world problems, it was to us.
---
&gt;Jesus, fucking krabs man.
---
Yeah how dare people want to make a ROI on their Super before they lose it 🤷
---
This sums it up pretty well:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon)
---
What is the point of earning ISK just to pay of the ship you're using to earn the ISK with?  Is Eve PvE that fun you'll do it to break even?  I don't think so.
---
This would be really great if t3cs didn’t exist
---
And what will happen if i won't follow your asking? Ah, i guess nothing. So, don't waste your breath, fatty.
---
yes
---
All the deployables (cyno inhib, depot, MTU, bubble and this) should have similar rules. They should be anchorable and unanchorable (so you can re-use them), reasonably priced and reasonably sized. And this (and cyno inhib) should also get a range increase - it should be like 250km.
---
You will want to check out https://evewho.com/corp/Black+Ops+Matter
---
Cynos should have these restrictions as well btw
---
This man get it \^  amen.
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/WHC\_Bookmarking\_Scheme](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/WHC_Bookmarking_Scheme)
---
Thats the Bookmarking Scheme EUni's Wormhole campus is using. I think this is a quite sophisticated method, and all others lack in something in some way or another. Other Wormholers, fite me.
---
This is the kind of thing you will need to ask in your alliance/alliance help channels because its very much an alliance/corp level thing.
---
Lol Avree I like to see you playing hard like this.  Keep it up man
---
Right on, thanks man.
---
Some will. 
---
But the kind that are really going to take advantage of having no local, the kind who fly cloaky nullified t3cs either for hotdropping or use Lokis with 25km webs to solo without any risk, will not. 
---
And this kind is going to be the reason no one undocks without an umbrella
---
I appreciate the ear, you will have to understand myself and people from the small gang community are upset and have been upset for many years now and this one likely timed event has given us a glimmer of hope for some potential, again, limited, fun.
---
It is my personal opinion that the bread and butter of nullsec is alliances battling smaller groups back and forth over resources with a mix of small "terrorist" like groups who just like to cause some havoc. EVE has moved towards completely safe empires operating without fear year after year.
---
I just roamed Delve for the first time since returning to the game from a 3 year slumber. I was shocked to see 15+ Rorquals mining without a care in the world. I caught a freighter on a gate which we barely killed just as two separate 50-person Hawk or Harpy (can't remember) gangs from two different alliances promptly showed up. 
---
There are so many issues right now with EVE but one of them is everyone is compacted into these tight areas with no reason to not be compacted. All the groups in Delve used to be spread out over Branch, Tenal, Dek, Fade, and part of Pure Blind. Now they are in Delve and that's it. 
---
There are so many issues with null from the perspective of the 10 man gangs that like to roam around your space and it has undoubtedly reached the point of more people have left this small gang community than those that remain. I'm not sure what the perspective is from a nullsec bloc group, but if you guys want to just carebear in peace and not have conflict that's what EVE is heading towards if it isn't there already. This blackout has given us some hope.
---
no i mean the stupid amount of precautions just to super rat in delve lmfao
---
I'll cheak it out thank you!
---
&gt; Why people is able to do that? Injectors
---
Partly, but also because the activity is so low APM that you can play it with less than 10% attention.
---
a neut domi will murder a T3C if it comes in to scram. You can still MJD out of point range if its kite fit.  
---
Idk bout you, but i'd trade a 200m battleship for a blingy T3C any day if one decloaked next to me in a neut domi.
---
Former bird, if you ask while a fleet is forming you're 100% going to get a ship.
---
&gt;Please ensure that this port isn't blocked.
---
You should join a hs corp when you're bored and want to do some damage. In all seriousness there are corps that are often populated by rich, lazy people who farm newbies... and missioning newbies pay taxes to them. They exist to farm you, so be careful.
---
Never join a hs corp with a tax rate over 5%. If they say "it's to pay the debt on our citadels" run away.
---
Never join one that says they do everything. They never do. 
---
Who ever you talk to, remember they want you more than you need them, so interview them and don't let them bamboozle you. Treat them as the employee. Research them through evewho.com (look for leaver rate), their war history in game, and zkillboard. Look for their losses to see how they reacted under pressure. Google their CEOs, to learn their social media activities.
---
And if you find them objectionable, say you're an experienced returning player and you have plans to make your new CEO rich. If they're stupid they'll believe you. Work to get directorship, then take everything. Google "belligerent undesirables" for some old stories about how its done.
---
If he raises it, nobody will trade there.
---
The ppl who will trade in that citadel will be plex market ppl who kinda need something like this tbh. :)
---
Thanks for clearing that up :)
---
I'm really struggling with peoples common sense in this thread. 
---
When we talk about AFK we actually never know if they are AFK or not.  Stop being literal.  We all know any cloaky camper as 'AFK Cloaking ' it's just what it's called.
---
In fact many of them are NOT AFK literally we ASSUME they are because who the fuck sits there for hours on end.  Actually people real do. And actually they are an alt.  So the main is probably doing whatever whilst monitoring their alt.
---
Also wheres  this no danger no killmail BS from AFK camper? What utter nonsense.
---
Firstly they are fit with a cyno so it's the fleet the jumps through is the issue. How hard is that to understand?
---
Secondly being cloaked means you cannot see where they are they could be sat right next to you and you wouldnt know.  They can literally unncloak , lock, warp scram you and light a covert cyno and thats it done in a matter of seconds.  Seriously being able to    instantly jump ships through a cyno is stupid it always has been.
---
If you're going to comment please at least know your subject
---
more people will resub than leave, getting rid of worthless spodbrains and getting more pvpers back is a good thing.
---
Horde has now wardecced you.
---
The enemy of my enemy is my... enemy?

---
I'd advise to not use me as a data point 'cause I'm a fussy asshole on music;  I like what \*I\* like and y'all can keep the rest.  Which isn't to say I might not cherry-pick from someone else's list, but the hopes of my making it through more than a few "undesirable" selections before just bailing are a slim prospect at best.  And a lot of what I've heard describing itself as "space themed" music is some variation of newage/newrave/dubstep drivel that, well, just \*aint\* me.
---
That, and one of the biggest disappointments of being a geezer in space is not having a lawn to yell at children to keep off of.
---
you see, I was giving him the benefit of the doubt, if he thinks a clearly supplemental income is worth making a deal with pretty much all other nullblobs to not shoot it, he doesn't want to fight.
---
&gt;I'd love to see Marauders being used offensively but....
---
Then leave your fucking comfort zone and accept the possibility of some loss.
---
Some of us PVP in Marauders and have multiple PVP fit Marauders in our possession and every time one of you idiots makes one of these threads with your "good ideas on how to fix whats not broken" we die a little inside out of fear CCP might hear you.
---
The ship is completely functional outside of some fitting slow and pg/cpu issues in SOME versions, but ships like the Vargur are actually in a nearly perfect place.
---
Wait this means "Yes" then. Well crap... But while we at it, re-roll back to 2007-2009 Eve = good times.
---
So then its more accurate to say that maintaining jump bridges and beacons takes more effort.
---
Most structures don't care about being reinforced occasionally.
---
&gt; EHP isn't the problem, it's damage.
---
Honesty I’d argue the opposite. Plenty of ships have damage profiles well above their own class (or the class their hp is most closely related to) and the problems with them are minuscule in comparison. 
---
A perfect example is the relationship between Attack Battlecruisers, Combat Battlecruisers, and Battleships. Of the three I believe it’s safe to say that ABCs see the least use (even then some of that use is extremely niche). They have equal or greater damage, better range (except you talos) and move much quicker than CBCs and BS. The problem becomes apparent when you consider that ABCs are closer in HP to cruisers than CBC/BS.
---
Adjusting the damage of capitals up or down has both positive and negative effects against caps/subs. It’s either easier to kill caps and subs, or harder to kill both. Adjusting the EHP down makes it easier for both classes to kill each other. 
---
If supers had their HP reduced down to 25% (not the %10 suggested as I haven’t done that math yet) they would still have multitudes more EHP than capitals. The EHP levels just curve up so much more quickly than dps does.
---
thx pgl, you the man
---
Like politicians getting their policies from Twitter, CCP should not get its game design ideas from reddit.
---
More likely the bots got them already.
---
I think it has always held up. "Time spent playing" starts at 2003 at the left and ends at around 2006 at the right. What people dont notice is the plateau at the top has stayed perfectly flat all the way up to 2019.
---
I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully you're able to find some furries soon.
---
tbh i didnt know its range, so yeah it does seem okay.
---
&gt; log into reddit on a computer like a non heathen
---
&gt; edit flair
---
god bless
---
Not connected to chat server = you've got the blackout upgrade a bit earlier
---
Going, first ever event cannot wait.
---
Will it include free gila?
---
How do you get a triglavian BPO?
---
I have been looking for you guys for a long time. I just couldn't remember the name, thank you!
---
Given fuel isn't really going to be an obstacle for most major groups, just an added tick in a ledger,
---
Maybe, unlike the other structures, have it disable when reinforced.    
---
Throw some hand wave jargon about reinforcement shield harmonics interfere with scanning procedures to satisfy lore reasons.    
---
It's then something you can actively hit with a small group to cause a lot of chaos not hot have people just ignore until the last timer.
---
No clue, I did 3 data’s and 2 relics yesterday and left with 109m worth of stuff. 
---
I know they’ve needed salvage a lot. Running C5 sites the salvage 6-8 months ago used to average about 40m per site, but now it’s less than 10 per site.
---
I wasn't aware that Lazerhawks was a blops group.
---
Have fun bashing them!
---
I got out about 300 mil out of a hole 4 weeks ago or so but now i feel its a lot less...like sansha site with 11 mil in total?!
---
I can only speak of the Paladin, since that's what I've been using, but it's a terrible solo pvp ship. With small gang, it's great as long as you have tackle. Solo, you can wipe out bombers or corm/talwar fleets, but with only 4 midslots, tracking will always be a problem if you fill three of the slots with MJD, MWD, and a heavy cap booster. You could drop the MWD and MJD to fit grappler/web/scram/point, but then you're basically a dread stuck in bastion that does much less DPS, less tank, and much more expensive. 
---
Personally, I use it under our super umbrella 95% of the time with a cyno fitted in a utility high slot, because its feast or famine. You're either blapping everything or you can't hit anything. It's a terrible pvp ship but great for the memes.
---
In the message you replied to, I explained that I don't use the website. I'm not planning to log in just to change a flair either as it isn't an issue for anyone except you two.
---
There is also the ditanian fleet (TDF) they are armor tanked.
---
Because leshaks are awesome in every way
---
So what you are really saying, when we boil it down, is that you are afraid of the guy in the local chat window, even though you can't see him, don't know who he is, and don't even know if he's at the computer.  Your fear is keeping you from enjoying the game.  That's what you are saying.  I live in a wormhole.  I never know if someone is there, unless I happen to catch them on d scan or see them jump a hole (or I get dropped on).  You don't see me afraid to undock though.  It's a choice you make.  You've chosen fear of loss over enjoyment of a PvP game.
---
Sometimes I can't tell if you're trolling, or genuinely believe the stuff you type. You'd get along great with my grandmother, she gets really into bizarre conspiracy theories.
---
All bullshit aside, that's a cancerous way to approach this game.  That makes it more like work than a game.  Just pay for your sub, and drop whatever extra cash you have on some plex.  Never worry about it again.  All of a sudden, you can be the guy who drops rather than the ratter who's afraid.
---
AT ships are a lot more than a 30m dscan inhib, on par with interceptor or assault frig hulls.
---
I don’t have any sympathy for null people asking for changes to deal with the blackout, you still have jump bridges, gates with agro timers, and a lot of people, you can deal as is until CCP figures out what they want from this.
---
First, the Bastion module makes you immobile to begin with. I am not sure why Bastion would give you scram or web immunity, since you aren't moving, unless you mean coasting. 
---
Second, most scram/web tackle should be in range of your own scram, webs, and grapplers, so they should be easy kills. Yeah you'll get owned by Arazu/Lachesis/Proteus/HIC scramming you from further out while the rest of the gang pummels you, but those ships are kind of a hard counter to MJD battleships anyway. Besides, that's what EC-300s are for. 
---
Third, Sig Amps or Sensor Boosters can increase your scan range and resolution to let you snag those kills far easier. That's why they exist. 
---
Finally, Marauders are actually used in PvP with a lot of success. They are expensive to lose, but a lot of fun, too.
---
Does it really count as dropping a Titan if you accidentally jump instead of bridging?
---
You know, it’s pretty telling that your first thoughts on this matter have to do with what I suspect is a PVE super.
---
It's a good piece, but I have two problems with it:
---
* That speed depends entirely on you not getting scrammed and locked down
---
* Too many of the marauder's bonuses (projection, tank, EWAR resistance) are tied to immobility
---
There’s nothing too much wrong with marauders they will still give small gangs plenty of problems (which is where they shine) I’ve seen marauders do great in this regard it’s loads of fun too
---
the Bastion module means they are useless and overpriced for large engagements as they can’t take reps and when you reach scale a lot of battleships will just get deleted off the field before reps land.
---
The real elephant in the room here doesn’t have anything to do with their capabilities it’s that every1 and their grandmother has a cap alt or 3, whilst a marauder will happily chew through a 15-20 man gang of frigs and t1 cruisers it can’t tank all the carriers or worse dreads that will be dropped on its head. And sadly that’s what will happen, people just can’t help themselves
---
...and which is why i said it will be useless and unpopular while it breaks the Occam's blade: if you're trying to hide - you don't leave the sign "Hey, i somewhere there! Go, find me!" on every ship' Dscan display. Because it won't help in any way, but draw unwanted attention, interest and finally Combat scanners and gang/blob into your face.
---
This thing isn't and won't be a viable and popular piece of deployable equipment while it's in direct contradiction with its main goal.
---
Umbrella. why you haven't understand ?
---
Nothing is wrong with titans.
---
We need a new wormhole that a single titan can fit through.
---
Can confirm that my recently returned bittervet friend here is correct.  The vargur is a totally fucking sexy PvP boat - you just have to get over the hurdle of "oh no I might lose it and the 1B+ it cost me!"  It's mobile as hell using the MJD, deals a shit ton of selectable damage, can fit a neut or nos, smart bombs, and all the tackle you need.  It tanks like a beast too.  Until the Bhaalgorn shows up, at least.
---
RNG mate, learn to leave with it.
---
Separate account. Both need to be online (so both Omega) and in fleet together. 
---
The one character lights the cyno, the other jumps to it and that’s it.
---
Highsec corps have no CTAs/Strategic ops which are a negative, and still often have a very social atmosphere, which is one of the positives. It's also practically impossible to lose access to your stuff in highsec, and have to pay 15% to recover it. 
---
Both highsec and nullsec have their positives and negatives, and it's completely disingenuous to portray it any other way, especially considering content like triglavians have really upped the income potential of highsec as players mature.
---
Im not against testing things but thing is, there are real issues that need adressing. Gimmicky things like this just satisfies some for a short amount of time whilst ignoring the real issues. Its like when politicians do something to please the mob but really isnt good in the long run.
---
This solution will only make more people join bigger groups that have safer space. Thats not good. And places like Provi will get hit the hardest whilst the null sec fortresses wont really be bothered. Its a step in the wrong direction. All so people can catch some more VNIs. 
---
But thats my opinion. We have to see how it goes.
---
Firstly dont use the word You meaning Me as being afraid of anyone in local.  But many people are.  You know what it's not about who's in local but what's unfair is that you have pretty much zero counter to it.  Do you think its fair that a person can literally  sit next to you cloaked with the ability to.light a cyno INSTANTLY  and jump in a fleet INSTANTLY and kill you INSTANTLY.  That's the problem.
---
I personally have already stated removing local.is good. I have not once mentioned a problem with AFK cloaking itself either.  I just said removing local doesnt solve it. The problem is there is no counter to it..  and lets not use the standing fleet BS its usually those that have the spies in them that awox you in the first place.
---
Man, if that's true then how do people make a business of using alts to sit cloaked in systems? It must be a scam, or your wrong. Choose one.
---
Spoken like a real trooper there kiddo. Delve wouldn't be as safe if the asteroids didn't respawn 6x faster than they really should.
---
As i said you do'nt have argument Zkillbrain.
---
Keep in mind many eve players don't go through those corps, and many of us would even recommend against joining them as your first corp. They generally don't teach you self sufficiency, to think for yourself, you're one in a blob, and with ship reimbursements, you don't really feel the loss that makes eve so engrossing. It's a much more boring playstyle.
---
You can grab it, yes. You’ll find yourself being grabbed in all the wrong places if you try to undock there, though
---
Yes and you will catch one not more. Congrats. And they totally can't have a combat prober bot to check if they have unknow ship. 
---
STFU nooby hunter.
---
&gt; If you want improvements to small gang, I'm happy to listen to ideas.
---
caps and cynos is really what it boils down to tbqh
---

Most cloaky campers use imput broadcasting and bots anyway, not sure how I missed such an easy tell

If your standing fleet is full of awoxing spies, you need to leave Karmafleet or whatever shit group you're in.  Join a smaller, tighter group.  
---
And again, for the 1000th time, the counter to a hot dropper is a bait ship.  Fit your Ishtar to fight, rather than for max ticks.  Fit your carrier with tank, so it can last long enough for the response through your own cyno.  Or just accept loss as part of the game and stop crying about how there's "literally no counter."  If you undock it, assume it's already dead.  You'll liberate yourself from the fear of the hot dropper.  And I continue to use "you" because "you" keep making these fearful, risk averse arguments.

&gt; Super and titan pilot will wait on bomber near a blops, and travel near in an instant aroud the whiole galaxy , dock and take a titan/super in the opposite side of galaxy by magic of teleportation.
---
Or they could just take an interceptor across a network of fatigueless jump gates like they do now. Oh wait they don’t.
---
Again stop assuming I'm talking about me personally ffs.  Stop assuming my points are my personally experinces. This is the general shit that happens in eve.   Stop coming out with dumb shit.  And they are spies in every alliance or didnt you know that?
---
Well...they aren't anymore!
---
You can do high sec incursions
---
Well this level of organisation is necessary if you want to make anywhere close to 300m/h
---
You could TP everyonen so fast with this. If you said no... You don't know eve online mechani congrats.
---
I can't get past the amusing irony of all the folks raging against "perfect intelligence" bemoaning the fact that the Drifters attacks weren't announced in advance and the details of where and when and how many weren't perfectly communicated so they could be pre-release min/maxed. 
---
So it's their belief that in Eve space, every event should be announced in advance and every enemies objectives and goals should be understood.
---
Just like the perfect intelligence that they mock incessantly...   
---
And they should drop that dank loot so null can get  even fatter.
---
I live out of a pair of citadels, I’m good.

Being given free stuff doesn't decrease the amount fo learning you have to do to be truly independent so no.
---
Sounds like you moved the goal posts, are you referring to the learning curve being lesser severe because of new players being treated as a resource or the game itself?
---
Knowing what questions to ask is almost as important as being able to ask.
---
That is also how it works on frigates. Only HACs with t2 logi use the adc to stay alive long term
---
Stop playing gate games, then. Odds are the other side is bubbled anyway
---
Most of my work nightmares are hardware related.
---
Like suppliers marking parts end-of-life, so having to do a re-design to accommodate, but still maintain software compatibility somehow ... and manufacturing is halted until then (great, no pressure).
---
The scariest thing is when a vendor describes a substitute part as "pin-for-pin compatible."  That usually means it has undocumented errata that I get to discover, or that it has a different physical footprint but has similar pin functionality (sometimes with incompatible signal levels) for the pins that are 'compatible'.  Board re-spins are not without risks, expense, take time, require layout and testing resources that are already committed to other products.
---
Then after validating a substitute part, the supplier says it too has gone end-of-life, even after previously promising it had at least another 2-10 years of life remaining, so the process starts all over again.
---
Worst is when suppliers substitute or change parts, but not their part numbers, and stuff with the new parts don't work properly in products shipped to customers.  That's always 'fun' (not) to try to figure-out and solve.
---

Almost every video game I have ever played that has teleportation as one of its multiplayer mechanics ends up with a major balance problem. It turns out that in a video game, we're positioning and travel time play a huge role in competitive outcomes, the ability for a character or an army to instantly teleport is really fucking hard to balance. It should therefore be no surprise that the same is true for Eve online.
---
I would love to see you try beating High class Wh isk/h  in Null
---
Maybe more people (former ratter) go wh exploring now, since null is not save anymore.
---
Yes, of course it's biased to the hunter, they are trying to remove some of the massive advantages NS powers hold on their territories. You need to push in favour of one side if you want to change the current (in)balance.
---
Easy, just do more than 1 hour or so in null and average
---
Not safe anymore? Seriously guys no local is what wormholers deal with on daily basis and its not deadly...
---
If you live in a place where dreads and supers are routinely dropping on you, and you don't have the ability to quickly lock them down and murder them, you don't deserve to live in that space (at least not safely).  Have an alt in a Sabre standing by when you're ratting.  Make sure your friends do too.  Then you lock those dudes down until you can reship and destroy them.  I know exactly how this game works - I've been on the receiving end of a dread bomb.  Guess what?  Most of those dreads died after we waterboarded them and got our response fleet and caps on grid.  It's not fucking rocket science my friend. 
---
Either be ready to counterdrop and defend your space, or stop crying about the losses - you don't have to live in a spot where someone bigger, badder, and better can drop you.  Nobody forced you there.  Either join a bigger group, or move. if you can't find a place that's "safe enough" then maybe you need to move to highsec or wormholes.
---
What the fuck you talking about? I'm not shelling out cash for ships fuck off with that shit. I already pay my sub with cash.
---
Fanbois have their pee pee hurt when someone talk shit about falcon? Rofl
---
Limiting cynos would go a long way. It's too easy to drop a huge defence fleet from the region next door. 
---
We're desperately in need of either 
---
a) a spool up or 
---
b) a range dependant online time (i.e. the range a cyno can be jumped to from increases at &lt;x&gt; ly per second making jumping from next door relatively quick, but jumping at the max range of a titan's jump drive take quite a while).
---
b = mumble mumble, something about concord restricted bandwidth, mumble mumble.
---
False equivalency.
---
Yes please...I really want to setup a trap bubble/decloak trap and lance some shit with some titans.
---
pppffffft not at all
---
Well, not really. I'm a super and rorqual pilot, nothing to envy to anyone. It's just ugly stupid, and Olmeca's gold idea to Battle Royale EvE and burn nullsec to start again was a great idea. 
---
Sorry if y'all so shortminded
---
really? are disorganized groups in high class? or organized ones in low class?
---
That's your choice.  I'm giving you an option that frees you from having to grind isk.  It's actually the best isk per hour in the game.
---
people against perfect intelligence = not nullsec krabs
---
people whining about drifters =  nullsec krabs
---
Damn dude that was real crazy glad I could help you out with that advanced thought.
---
what?
---
No I haven't moved the goal posts whatsoever it is in fact your failure to understand everything from generating isk, learning both in game and out of game to buying and losing stuff. 1 of the hardest curves was saving to buy new shit. If the stuff is given freely or at a cheap cost then that aspect of curve becomes as smooth as it is in WoW.
---
I'm sorry you think your learning curve was tough whenever you started. All I'm saying is it was a lot tougher back in the noughties. Like when that graph was originally made.
---
Sorry you don't see what would happen, only what you hope would happen. Bye-
---
The rest after that is profit.
---
Obviously.
---
and with more attention, that profitability lasts even longer.
---
But also, I don't do null anoms, because they are boring.
---
Just saying “umbrella” isn’t going to jump in a bunch of supers here to save your broken logic. That only works in game.
---
What if this is meant to be a big shake up to make other changes more palatable?
---
It's not about gaining for oneself, but denying to others.
---
So, neither of those things.

I've been playing now for about 4 months. I've joined a new player group pretty well known in the game that isn't a large org with cap support. There's a fair amount of subcap pvp in null but no large fleet ops. Our space gets visitors often and attracts the occasional 20 man subcap fleet. Usually it's pretty chill and a good place to learn.
---
In the last week I've been involved in 2 shameless cyno drop of multiple carriers on 5 man response fleets of frigs and cruisers. It seems the cyno pilot gets into trouble and decides "fuck it: win button". Last night it was a geddon that was damn near into hull when he deployed it and dropped two carriers on us. 
---
How does a small gang combat this? It seems so ridiculously OP as a mechanic and completely shuts down my desire to pvp, or even plan the game in general. Have cynos always been a win button? Seems to totally stifle small pvp when people know they're basically unkillable with capitals on standby if they get into trouble.
---
I don't really care if my ship survives, I just want a big long brawl where I kill a couple of things
---
&gt; Reduce anom respawns. 
---
Now add *another* risk/reward calculation, and see even fewer people in space.
---
Elitist bullshit.
---
This game isn't about skills. It's about knowledge, that is terrible due to the UI and the pure goal of the game, a sandbox. And like every other decent games: smart moves.

But space drama is a thing, right?

---
I loved this movie as a kid. And it's so, so bad. But in a good way.
---
I'm in favor of more surprise and new things popping into the game.  My personal frustration with the last Drifter attack wave was that it was continuous for 30+ hours, with hits every 15-25 minutes, and no 'win' condition.  While it was happening, we had no idea as to whether it would go on for weeks. 
---
I think that's different than wanting "perfect intelligence", it's not wanting total burnout on fighting an AI attacker, instead of fighting other players.
---
holy fuck , that's a fantastic one, thanks bruh
---
Well, the real danger of the tackle t3c isn’t the t3c. It’s the covert ops cyno, and all of the t3c’s friends. Maybe the t3c lit if already 30 au away and his friends are in warp. Maybe he’s about to light it himself, and you’re going to die to bombers in the next 15 seconds. Doesn’t really matter, you’re still dead.
---
So the nullbloc leaders are all nullsec krabs... 
---
Damn dude glad I can confirm that...
---
That's not entirely accurate. Ratting anoms also yields escalations, fewer escalations being run means an increase in the value of the escalation rewards. There's also the value of officer and faction spawn loot, to a lesser degree.
---
great reasoning!
---
Why in the hell would anyone think that it needs to happen?
---
Yes, be it does require people to be formed and ready to defend structures when they come out. After the first 24 hours, my group saw 20+ structures thrown into reinforce that had to be put on timer boards and monitored.  It didn't feel 'occasional' when it was happening.

you use reddit a lot there budddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
---
Don't forget about the morons who will try to call their sites in local still, that pay no attention to changes or what their own alliance is doing.
---
Meh, not really the case. These elite roamers just wanna get kills without any risk to themselves. And they are pissy that it wont happen. There are plenty of places you can go and PvP but they choose to hunt afk VNIs. They are pretty much the same for null as CODE is to highsec. 
---
No local will just mean that their minority playstyle got buffed over the wishes of the majority. And guess who keeps the servers running?
---
Skin design contests wouldn't be a bad idea.
---
I wouldn't be so sure... Plex market is important. but not all is moving to the azbel that never survives a week.
---
And I know for a fact that the TTT was slowly but surely transitioning to an actual tradehub, for bulk goods at least. Those things will never move to an unsecure azbel.
---
anyways, personally, I liked the perimeter fights. And as long as noobie-FCs can take over the fights. i am looking forward to this competition 
---
&gt; Things will probably operate the same in Delve.
---
Excavators and attentive carrier pilots are going to be a LOT more vulnerable now in delve, as they should be. Without even knowing someone is in system, it'll be way easier to take them with surprise. Supers, maybe not so much, but getting enough bombers to glass carriers or just bomb a horde of excavators isn't difficult.
---
In my neck of the woods, we have fights daily.  Small under 10 gang, larger 30+ groups, and full on war fleets of hundreds.
---
My concern is that the local blackout is simply going to lead to tighter balling up of people to provide even more defense, as opposed to creating more opportunities for fight.
---
We will see when it happens how it turns out.
---
Some are, but we’re GOOD at it without safety nets or backup at the press of a button.
---
The stories and memories are alive on a reset too. Again, I think a reset is dumb, but arguing it is dumb because it erases history is equally dumb.
---
I think this will be great...forcing corps (even in big blocs like grrr goons lol) to work together, Corp mining ops, Corp gate camps, etc etc. It teaches us to work with each other. That is what we have been missing. I cant wait
---
Yes. As I said above, I don't use the website but I use an app to browse reddit. I'm not sure what the link between my karma and me not using the website is and am hoping you'd clarify that a bit.
---
What?
---
i feel shocked lmao
---
Afk cloaky bots now wave in local.
---
I understood what you meant, it was just worded a bit funny.
---
If stuff is dying then they arent afk. Obviously breaching contract.
---
Removing local from null is the best decision CCP ever made. Fight me.
---
I didn't say it erases history? That was someone else. I was speaking to the point that a lot of corps do have ties to a lot of corps from 10 years ago.
---
Sounds like a standing fleet to me
---
lmao, you got baited, i dont use reddit much and you fell for my trap, hahahahahhaha
---
Cloaked hunters and bots online. I can't wait. Oh...wait. I'm already playing that.
---
I already hunt hunters, the worry for is that they will dry up once easy safe kills goes away.
---
It‘s a feature not a bug.
---
We live in null.  TTT is nothing more than a money grab.  Its called working together.  Alot lf mouths to feed.   Nobody cares about hisec pubbies.  Eat shit and pay us.
---
Eh I had a guy roam to Brave space solo in a Mach. This happened a little over a week ago...
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77510204/
---
This doesn't really give me confidence there is small gang fights happening in your pocket if this is the response a solo battleship gets.
---
I have no idea what the trap was but ok. You got me I guess.
---
The ships point and shoot you before they load grid
---
I think generally the disorganized, undermanned part doesn't really apply to a good number of C4 groups. Most do take newer players compared to C5 so that part holds true but the rest is dated.
---
Yes, but there's a lower bound on the price of an item, that being the material cost. The main reason the inhib is expensive is because it's expensive to build, and not many people want to buy it to use it because its cost is far higher than its usefulness.
---
Does CCP ban for chat AHK scripts? There's so many spammers in Jita I don't think they do. You can whip up a chat spam script in 30 seconds.
---
Imagine not programming randomness into your bot that you leave on 24/7
---
*But muh free intel! QQ*
---
No skill queue, learning skills, no injectors, no alpha, want to join null? 50mil SP and good history first.

Probably a lot easier to detect one random idiot doing it in a nullsec  system then filtering through jita spam.
---
Anyone got the rlml legion fit they were talking about?
---
Real bad on 32 bit client last night. I thought I was disconnecting but I wasn't.
---
Isn't c4 not considered low class though?
---
I wasn't really putting c4 into low class
---
&gt; While hunters have access to broad sources like ADM levels, pilots in space, and ratting statistics, there are much fewer tools to recognize a potential threat before they have already arrived.
---
BULL
---
SHIT
---
Near 2, Taco, BACON, any of these fucking things you can take this bullshit and stuff it all the way back up your ass. You quite literally have programs based off using local that will warn you when the threat is multiple jumps away.
---
Figure a month to get it. Initially you want to hyper specialize. One fleet composition, every one trains for their specific role. That way you get reach 80% on your chosen fit in 30 days and balance out "fitting" skill and ship/module skills.
---
And you'll make horrible calls and die in a fire a lot since when you screw up in eve, it tends to go badly really fast.
---
My favorite brand new bro ship is the punisher with autocannons. It's extremely forgiving and takes forever to kill with a big fat armor plate (400mm or go home) you have the time to forget to do things and correct mistakes.
---
Only if we reduce the mats needed and time required to build em.  So instead of imperiums 1000 titans. They get 10,000.

Or... and this is just my idea.. bring more than 10 caracals.

Got lag spikes while moving clientwindows often lately, especially left click doesn’t work often on 32 bit client

Yes, it's driving me fucking mad. Right click and nothing happens
---
Lol still upset at the world I see
---
Now i miss potbs. :( Before the f2p crap.
---
Lmao
---
That is true. Especially since drifters and all. I refuse to believe CCP are just throwing darts around to see what sticks. But they have been doing stupid shit for a while. It took them what, 3-4 years to nerf the Rorq to current acceptable level. They still havent fixed the sov grind but instead just made it worse with cyno jammers and so on.
---
But as you say, next change might actually be better and chaotic enough so that this seems irrelevant. 
---
I doubt it tho. I only see less people undocking, even more barren NS, more capitals in the anoms and smaller groups having yet another reason to join super umbrellas. And this experiment being over within weeks since the player count will sink like a rock as soon as they start losing their stuff.
---
I really liked your "why the minmatar suck" video alot. The technical stuff is gold but the condensed lore in that one was awesome. Why haven't you done the other 3 playable races?

No, he's clearly talking about superhero mascots for department stores.
---
TIL pressing MJD button instead of cyno button makes wormholers ~~~elite~~~.
---
wormholerbtw.
---
What's the meme I'm so out of date
---
Are you talking about Pirate relics?
---
This is predicated on the assertion that the player count will go down.
---
I think you'll be disappointed.
---
With alts I can just fall back on my WH training and turn up gate activation sounds on gate camping alts. I can tell who enters and leaves without them knowing someone is there till they pop a dscan. Pretty silly to freak out about, there's not much variation to hunters and droppers. If they sneak in before you set up then you're fucked anyways, way she goes. Null sec boos finally get a small taste of actual home defense and site running from a wormhole perspective.
---
Funnily enough, yesterday I had my best relic site, first container had 12 armour plates, another 50m or so in the remaining cans. easy isk :)

Finally a CCPlz I can get behind.
---
It is, the high class distinction is purely based around capitals. Since a C4 -&gt; C5 connection can't support a cap jump it's considered low class.
---
Not getting right click problems on 64-bit, but am having issues with fps dropping with an increase in frame times constantly.
---
I've been unable to maintain a solid 60 fps/16ms frametime since one of the last recent updates.
---
Mainly due to a lot of them being _really fucking hard_ to condense like that. The Caldari depends a great deal on what Hypercorp you're a part of, the Amarr depend an INSANE amount by what House, Race &amp; Class you are as they're in intensely hierarchical society, and the Gallente are... Well, probably the closest to being possible.
---
Right into a decloaking bubble in a site
---
Cynos aren't the problem, the impossibility to prevent/stop them is.
---
Someone just give HiCs a new script that shuts down cynos (and also buff cyno inhibitors).
---
This is probably your best answer.  
---
Moa with rails if you're gun trained is a strong solid ship with good range control, reasonable dps and very nice shield tank.  
---
The Caracal is just hands down one of the best cruisers in the t1 range in game. Pop some rapid lights on it, couple of hobgoblin 2's. Give it ballistic controls and a nice shield tank and you should be golden.
---
It's a good time to be a predator
---
Whilst not a cov ops, the HAC Itikursa is a pretty awesome ship too if you have the cruiser 5 already. Give it a shot in the meantime, it's a beast and I'll probably be hunting in it come the hallowed day local is gone.
---
(With that said, I'm trying to get back into it somewhat)
---
I was last night, on the 64 bit client.  Today it's been OK so far.
---
Dont wanna be that guy but this will only mess cynos up for every use (they are used tons more for moving than actual PvP). If u ever need to use one in a situation where you are being ganked it will pretty much always take your response fleet more than 30 seconds to react which means the spooling time is irrelevant in most cases.
---
I talked to my corpmates and were gonna do leshak roams just because we all have battleship V too
---
I’ll check it out and see if I can make a fit I like
---
I’m excited to be coming back into eve, it’s been far too long since I played
---
I'm right at the 200m mark too, is your 500 day queue also just 12 skills like me?
---
An apple a day keeps the doctor away?
---
you can jump wormholes with bastion active, it will be deactivated on the other side
---
Yeah, I don't know what he's talking about with lock range. I think the Paladin targets out to 109 or 115 before links. I've caught so many people 100+ km away with MJD + overheated point.  I feel like a lot of these "fix marauders" threads are from people that have never actually flown one, have heard someone talk about using them, then say "well, I've been thinking about pvp'ing in a marauder, except it's bad because..."
---
&gt; Now a lot of players are noticing the fabulous, amazing and funny that WH is actually.
---
so was 2012-2013 hisec.
---
Guess where it's now?
---
Nope. You obviously don't know shit. That's not how it works at all
---
Incase you don't know, bastion module already gives marauder range bonus and ewar immunity
---
Before posting at least fly the ship
---
Technically he isn't cloaky camping, he is dropping. You can't counter cloaky camping, but there isn't a need to.
---
Carriers should be a lot easier to catch considering you can now park an invisible sabre between forts/ratting sites and as long as they don't see you on dscan before you've decloaked and bubbled you're golden. Just spook them to force a warpout. Drop a cyno inhib as soon as they warp to their now bubbled fort and it should be nearly coming out of warmup as soon as they're landing. I'd imagine this will become a very common tactic as it shouldn't be hard to pull off. The only real counter is either having backup through a cyno or immediately jumping out.
---
C2&gt; NS, C5 corps have fairly high skill requirements and not SP requirements. You have to prove that you are able to fly and not whelp on the first gate/wormhole. Mentioning Foxholers in the same sentence with Tuskers is kinda kek. 
---
I do not see how C4 is """"relaxed space"""" when you have to work harder for everything (rolling, ISK, scanning etc.) than in highclass where you just cap brap a hole or warp some caps into a site. Being unable to escalate with caps when you are getting shit on by HK - not like it would matter all too much but you get the point - and facing various massive sized corps from your potential other static is everything but relaxing. C4 corps usually also feel a lot more threatened by evictions because it's easier to get rid of them and get a nice chunk of loot of of a medium sized corp.
---
Generalizing doctrines and corporations based on the type of wormhole they live in is as dumb as it gets. It's a lot more than "C5 man good" and "C4 man bad" but if you buy in to that meme just to cater to some ironic PraiseBob poster then yeah go ahead. There are C3 people who fly 1.5b+ ships, that does not make them more or less than anyone else in wormhole space. Not mentioning Of Sound Mind (assuming OP is a good boy, if you are not you must not taint the pureness of that corporation) when you are replying to a guy who is interested on trying out wormhole space as a highclass corp is also peak tier advice.
---
Oh yeah and literally everybody, even C1 retards and even probably you have alts so don't see the point there.
---
What a load of shite. Half of them don't even watch intel channels, got a program that does it for you.
---
I mean I'd be in favor of capital ewar boats whose ewar is stronger or unaffected by capital ewar resistance, but that is its own can of worms.
---
Better idea IMO is anti-capital bombers.

great assumption there nitwit.  I neither rat nor mine and prefer to do nothing but pvp, not that it is any of your business how anyone makes their money in this game.  How about you quit being shortsighted and see past your own playstyle and how changes will effect the entire game.

Yup

Yeah mostly, but I recently added some disintigrator skills, and some triglavian ship skill for good measure.

Blow up the ship before it reaches the range required to bring in reinforcements then.

Damn, what color are you using for the barrel ? its really good!

Not content with no local, now you move on to no umbrella either.  What do you think is going to be left in space for you to drop once these two innovations have been achieved?

---
Why are you putting your words in quotes? Do you not know how they work?
---
Yes, past few days has been happening intermittently. I've been using the 64 bit client since it was available and have only had the issues recently. (also multiboxing)
---
&gt;My concern is that the local blackout is simply going to lead to tighter balling up of people to provide even more defense, as opposed to creating more opportunities for fight.
---
I don't agree with much of what you've said here in general, but I think this part is not only correct but should be emphasized.
---
Simply removing local isn't going to turn back time and have people undocking a bunch of random subcaps to fight off roaming gangs.  Null groups only did so when it was the most practical solution to removing those gangs from their space, as in the past dropping caps simply made less sense - not only did they have more trouble applying to subcaps, but they were considered significant assets people were afraid to lose if something went wrong.
---
Today, we're so far from that reality that only drastic changes to capital ship capability vs subcaps could bring something like that back.  The sad truth is that, without local, responses to homeland threats are likely to be more overwhelming, and krabbing ships are going to carry cynos far more often. *(The VNI changes should rush this along even further, as many people switch to afk Domis which are capable of lighting a cyno and not immediately dying to rats.)*
---
Just think about it.  Without the benefit of local intel, fitting a cyno and dropping caps on whatever threatens you is simply the safest way for null groups to protect their krabbing ships from hunters and roaming gangs.  Large groups will certainly still have dedicated intel channels and characters, but it will take more effort and likely result in most krabbing taking place in the same size or even smaller areas of space.
---
In the end, removing local adds absolutely no incentive for large groups to spread out at all; on the contrary, it actually incentivizes them to compact their active space down at least into the same supercap umbrellas that have ruined content for years now.
---
Replace learning curve with microtransactions and your spot on!
---
I already have my cloaky eyes and bait ship ready. Why hunt the hunters when they will fall all over themselves coming to me?
---
Then I suggest you get your ears checked.
---
Why announce you are there, just hotdrop 4head.
---
"This" is history
---
Paraphrashing what people are saying.  They keep talking about krabbing like it's the only thing new people want to do.  PvP is still 100x harder than krabbing.
---
You've made absolutely no sense and haven't addressed the actual topic at all.
---
Saving to buy new shit is not "learning" I'm sorry you think so. 
---
If a player is given shit. Then they skip that part of the curve, they still dont know anything more without actually learning, because they circumvented it.
---
I understand that you're trying to prove your point that it is easier to succeed in the game now because of more guidance and allowance, but your clouding the topic with trying to prove that and it is absolutely unrelated to the learning curve itself. Being given free shit does not grant anyone knowledge.
---
I'm definitely convinced reading comprehension isn't your forte. Endangering fleet so we might break even if we're good, or outright lose and maybe not get a single kill if we're bad is "going for easy kill".
---
Blackout is going to be so much fun, between the potential for Gang vs. Gang subcap fights (an unfortunately very rare and delicate candy these days) and the salt from your kind as an extra bonus.
---
You are old my dude
---
It's still true in relative terms. While eve has been somewhat dumbed down, all other games have become flintstone phone tier.
---
Sorry Krabs don't get fed instant Intel to push the I win button
---
Ooh look forward to it, Leshaks are an absolute beast, with battleship 5 aswell you're going to be literally melting things, and if you have the numbers they're great for carrier, marauder, rorq and to a lesser extent dread hunting.

---
My heart bleeds for those who can't survive without an umbrella.
---
I lived in sov nullsec for years and I never had one to protect me. I couldn't just light a cyno and have an overwhelming force come to my aid. If help was coming, it was coming from the system I was in, or next door.
---
&gt;Solution? Limit the amount of farmers one can stack in a single umbrella.
---
And then we just have multiple umbrellas.  It's not like the major blocks would have trouble fielding more than one standing fleet with their current numbers.  With blackout driving people to caps, that gets even worse.
---
The obvious response to B is to ball up even harder so you're within range of the response fleet.
---
But....but...you’re a goon, you’re supposed to be a mega crab, reeeeeeeeee spod brain!!!
---
Seriously though I agree wholeheartedly with what you said. It’s about fucking up, making mistakes and learning from it. Sure it’s ok to be mad but only be mad at yourself, not the other guy because he got you. That other guy just has made more mistakes than you and learned from it. We are all on the same road when it comes to that, it’s just some are further down it than others.
---
With null the risk vs reward has been highly skewed to the reward side ever since citadels. As a player base we are making more then we destroy, just look at the cost of supers and capitals in general. On a whole we are choking on our own greed and a shake up is just the medicine we need to further the life and enjoyment we get out of this game. Sure it will be intimidating at first, we will be out of our comfort zone at times but change is good. I feel we can relate it to taking a new job for example, it’s a new environment, new rules, etc. and it can be scary but eventually we find it to be the change we needed to better ourselves and our future.
---
This is only a viewpoint held by the ignorant, the carebears, and the bloc linemember.
---
You can have all the knowledge in the world of what to do in a given situation. Actually applying that knowledge on the fly, making the correct decisions, making your fingers do the right things, looking for the right things? That's entirely different. That's skill.

So you are telling me there isn’t meant to be a right click delay?
---
(Living in rural Australia by the way)
---
And they sat there for 23/7, killed a few T1 cyno frigs, and nobody took the bait ever since, because there's killboards.
---
Seriously, defense simply doesn't work. Even if it works once, they grab some pointless cyno frig, and every other chicken attacker just fucks off, and now you don't even know how many cyno bombers you have in your system and watching anymore.
---
But yeah, while your first part is obviously wishful thinking, couldn't agree more with the last part.
---
Compare to any other game. You're so biased.
---
Sure knowing when overheat is important, blablabla. But try to aim like in CS : GO as having a map vision and control, and as in EvE guess what the other is thinking about.
---
But in eve most of it even start before you're on grid.
---
Not skill. 95% knowledge / smart move / luck.
---
Skip the grind isk.  Buy yourself into a Titan so you can lose it on your first time out with it and rage quit the game.
---
Eve uni i think has one.
---
Your right PvP for a newbro now is actually harder  in many ways.
---
But also a lot easier. You would never of got a free 50mil for being brave and going against a vet 1v1. You'd of got respect for sure. Most newbros who pvp tend to leave a fight with a vet with more than they entered. Last newbro who was cool like that got at least 200mil from my gang.
---
You weren't ratting in a carrier or super, or mining in a rorqual were you.  You were using subcaps and as your killboard shows, not that fussed about losing them.
---
You're best bet is a cruiser or a battlecruiser then. Battleships are too intimidating and too slow. You'll get tackled by a frigate you can't hit and blobbed to death while not killing anything. You could go off-meta and fit small guns on it. It will lower your DPS by a bit, but you will kill those tackling frigates and completely confuse them.
---
The thing is, if you look intimidating, people will just gang jump you. The ships that get good fights against gangs also don't look intimidating, otherwise you'll spook all fights that you have a chance against and only encounter those that you can't fight. And by can't fight, I mean you won't even get a kill. 
---
Something to try is probably the element of surprise. Overprop and catch a kiting frigate group that thinks it can outrun your cruiser. Add an element of EWAR that wrecks a gang. Overtank with a XL Ancillary Shield Booster, or Large Armor Repper with Capacitor Booster.
---
Your best bet though is to fly the friendship. Adding another ship into the mix really widens your engagement profile. You could try dual-boxing 2-3 accounts, but the #1 thing you can do is to find a group that specializes in small-gang.
---
Not actually. Not in this case. He trained them. But what’s it take to train a VNI alt? Nothing
---
Two different kinds of skill.
---
Character skills vs. player skills.
---
Player skill trumps character skills in many (most?) situations.
---
That's fight was at the mouth of our ratting pocket, which is heavily defended against the "whalers".
---
Most of the more limited fights occur in Catch, where there isn't as much krabbing' going on.
---
If only there was some way of moving the umbrella ... some sort of "keepstar highway" that ships with "jump drives" can use.
---
Corporation friendly-fire is now an illegal act
---
Actually I was ratting in a pair of Nids. What my killboard shows is when we engaged, we engaged as a small alliance using subcaps, exactly because we couldn't batphone daddy to come save us.
---
Standing fleet isn't people only sitting there watching for an attack.  They're doing something else while in the fleet.
---
I mean, at least it's not "drive angry" ;)
---
There are no Triglavian BPO, you can only get Triglavian BPC by buying them off the market or looting abyssals/invasions.
---
Dotlan and ingame map statistics for hunters to magically know exactly where to go is free intel.
---
Standing fleets don't tend to be "cloaked and aligned 500km off".  That's a trap fleet, that can only maintain discipline so long. No one wants to sit for hours aligned. 
---
Standing fleets tend to be more kitchen sink, roaming the local constellation, responding to XXX in fleet, and chasing baddies.
---
Overproping a cruiser sounds hilariously fun.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Capital PvE is one of the cancers killing Eve.
---
God damn starbase charters
---
Defenders have standing fleets, and pilots to be pinged. Hunters have the ability to choose a single attack point and be prepared. 
---
After  fozzie sov + Rorqs + injectors defenders huddled in single umbrellas. That took away the hunters' advantage to apply pressure to a single point without worrying about the entire force of the defending coalition. If defenders need to split umbrellas that ability comes back, things will go back a bit toward balanced.
---
Not in systems larger than max scan range, alts are free-ish and you can run them fairly easily and keep track of people entering and exiting with a quick glance. WH rats can scram so knowing what's coming pushes survivability higher.
---
Ironically, it also can be used to preempt drifter attacks of you put them in the next system as you can hear warpins. All these problems people are having were solved years ago in wormholes. Russians with their Intel bots are farther along than most nullsec alliances in seems, if they swapped to real accounts there would be no problems.
---
You give no opinion. Your linked post tries to appeal to all sides without providing much insight or arguments. "Oh, look, here am I, I care about all of you!".  Taking a side would be honest. Listing arguments for both sides (especially those not known to general audience) would be useful. Your post has neither.
---
I may have missed this ship fitting/engagement guide?
---
Sometimes you just want to make people squirm a bit before you drop the hammer.
---
This made me lol, but at some point i have to ask.
---
Do pvpers (the mindless roam to glowing evemap dot kind) honestly believe that this will work out, and they will enjoy people not giving them content?
---
I won’t enjoy roaming and only finding shit to kill in umbrellas, and no more vnis or easy subcaps.... will you genuinely sit back going “lololol good bye iran’s hahaha” while you... fly alone?  Only getting gate bosoned or dropped... is that fun to you?

There only has to be enough damage to pause the timer while whittling it down.

Against TEST, goons etc. that is not an easy task. But hardly impossible.     
---
If anything you can throw enough shit at any structure until it dies. There aren't even bombs in hisec.
---
Still not as instant and perfect as local, and you can't run fucking Near2 with it.
---
What would you like me to give my opinion on?  The post was to tell people what's happening and give my opinion.
---
tl;dr: The drifter waves sucked because of burnout, the local blackout won't hurt null sec blocks, instead reinforce the "drop all the things" responses
---
Unfortunately the whole eve online player base is too old to accept this kind of changes. And to seduce a new playerbase it needs to step up and become fun, instead of interesting.
---
Yes I'm saying it. Y'all old folks too old to change, and elitist fuckers.
---
Currently, the only way to counter caps is by dropping your own caps. Or if you somehow are hiding a 40+ man bomber fleet in your back pocket. They will probably respond by dropping even more caps and eventually, the side with the most caps win.
---
Cynos have always been a win button though. Even before caps were so common, all you needed was a Titan in range willing to warp in a response fleet that's bigger than you guys. Then again, it's much harder to assemble 10-20 ships vs 2 and Titans themselves were much rarer. You could also probably kill a few ships of the subcap response fleet before they killed you, but if someone deployed a cyno and there was someone else who could respond, insta-win button. Only recourse was for you guys to light a cyno and escalate, although you would usually escalate to battleships instead of straight to caps.
---
 "ITS THE MOST IMPORTANT KEY!"
---
No idea what you're talking about.  I haven't checked your killboard.  
---
Baited.
---
No has said EVE is easy. Merely that the graph about does not represent eves learning curve.

---
The best part is when you think "They won't fall for this" but they do. Always brings a smile.
---
I still think what I said is far simpler and will probably generate more diverse tactics around it.
---
the issue isn’t cloaking.  It’s uncloaking and pooping out a smoke signal that 5000 capitals and other dudes can magically teleport to INSTANTLY
---
Fix that, and no local is fine
---
Hi.
---
I have not logged into this game in 2 years, I solely fly interceptors and Recon ships, I owned a carrier for 2 days and sold it and the character because I did not like them.
---
Your suggestion is stupid, you do not understand the game. Move on.
---
It’s only hard if you want to be on the pve side and aren’t in a capital
---
Capitalproliferation online is fun too i guess?
---
Fuckin space boomers complaining about change.
---
You're in luck. There's no only a single HS incursion these days so you can just burn to the focus and spam (maybe like once an hour) in local or the incursion channel asking what groups are around. I'm sure whoever is looking for pilots will reply.
---
I'm sorry, I know it's r/eve... but ummm... did you have some kind of point?
---
From what I remember last time I bothered to do it the tutorial missions and epic arc are actually fairly decent at teaching combat/fitting basics. Gradual difficulty ramp up to reasonable challenge and new mechanics are introduced in the form of mission rewards (ammunition, repair modules, skills, etc). 
---
The tutorial experience is still nowhere near the level of freshly released modern mmos but trying to be objective as possible it's not horrible anymore either. Of course I'm sure a significant amount of players just get bored, exit out of the tutorial, and end up completely lost as a result, but that probably has more to do with the pve gameplay in general than the actual tutorial.
---
They're very gimmicky setup that will fail if you're fighting the wrong gang though. Overprop will fail against a lot of stuff because you will either lack DPS or tank. Small guns will fail against anything that has more than a frigate tank, but battleships will have a very hard time in any case. Fitting a heavy neut or 2 could actually be very useful since it will completely shut down the frigate's mwd, preventing it from escaping once it realizes you are actually applying your damage very well.
---
I can tell people to go to the fitting window and they come back with absolutly hilarious shitfits. Then tell them about range, damage, and accuracy based ammo changes on top of resistance by race and it just became a college level course.
---
Eve is hard, you're just familiar with it.
---
press shift+ctrl+alt+m then open the outstandings call. i bet when the right click delay happends you will see a list of alot of calls getting delayed
---
for me it happend when i was doing stuff on a alt then tryed to right click someone in local on the main, dont know if it have was allways when i moved from one client to the othere but it felt like it
---
I though null was the place to be until I went into a WH, and only then have I realized what I have been truly missing all this time.
---
As is skill injectors.
---
oh damn. Sounds like they have taken serious steps with the system.
---
To the point I confess I may have to do a check to update my knowledge of what people are thrown into the space with.
---
So, you feel shaken, afraid, disappointed, tired... victimized perhaps?
---
Quit! If you have only complaints, quit...

Close all your Bot accounts, mothball all your VNIs...  sell your 20 rorqs, your 10 titans, and your 20 super carriers...  go out of your home... breath some air... take a shower...

---

---
To me it seems carriers and supers were hit hard with the nerfbat in regards to filling all roles.     
---
I haven't seen many in response since that.
---
Titans have received a more ore less meaningless nerf for HAW. Maybe an overall nerf is in order.     
---
Our Stuka fleets seem to hold nicely against dreads. But that is of course no small gang by any means.
---
I'm not against the change btw. but i do  think dinkle has a point in saying, that Wormholes and Null are different in many regards, so the same local treatment does different things to them.
---
Saint Falcon the Wise hath spoken.
---
They reset my subscription, it says canceled now.
---
It does, and it always will. Stop with the negativity. tia
---
That includes dreads in WH, yes.
---
Teaching mechanics like:  
---
"You can stop a bad guy from escaping by using a Stasis Webifier on it"
---
"Using a Salvaging module just unlocks the container of the wreck that was there"
---
To be fair though, they now make you die 3 times if you do the tutorial + Advanced Military Career Agents, so it kind of introduces the idea that you will lose your ships in this game.
---
See it appears a lot of people think I'm saying EVE is not hard. I am not. I am saying that learning curve does not represent EVEs learning curve today. Theres a whole industry made into developing newbros.
---
Amen
---
When will volta reopen recruitment
---
Give it time
---
If you have someone blocked, do they show up if they talk in a delayed chat system?
---
You can probably make some pretty dank ticks baiting inexperienced hunters the first couple days. Bait domis/myrms are dirt cheap and just a couple carriers should be able to handle most small groups easily (balanced btw)
---
Has there been a thread about TAPI in the past 2 years you HAVENT madposted in? I think he's got a point 😄

I wanted to read something interesting, i ended up losing my time and getting the feeling that you are taking one side while trying to show that you care for another. Needless to say, I was annoyed by that.
---
And hey, it's just personal opinion of someone who hopes for drastic changes to be introduced to break the blue donut. While not ideal for this purpose, blackout shows that CCP wants to try to do something rather than watch how EVE fades out.
---
&gt; I'm giving you an option that frees you from having to grind isk.
---
You aren't giving me shit, i live on a fixed income and can't spent cash on ships.
---
Oh princess I'm sorry did I hurt your feelings.
---
It did but doesn't anymore it not negative it factual. Stop labelling an opinion negative just because you disagree with it. That's negative.
---
Ok then angry nullbear.  If your income is so tight, maybe paying a subscription for a video game isn't your best move.  Let me guess - you've got a high end gaming rig and fancy iPhone too?
---
I was grinding so hard for jump clones and then some dude joins Corp with a Rorqual and it's as simple as watching to a POS in low sec.
---
Giving people fits and advice is a far cry from being able to build their own and know what to do. Most games you can kind of beat your head at problems and they eventually go away. Eve kills you and offers no real suggestions.
---
I could take people into dark souls and tell them beat a boss and here's the guide, but the tell them how to be a DPS for an incursion and they will probably die literally forever with the same resources because they weren't taught the basics.
---
The movement speed should be a role bonus and that factions ecmc should have a bonus, scram for sin, tp/web effectiveness for panther, nets for redeemer, and widow needs more buffer.
---
&gt; If your income is so tight, maybe paying a subscription for a video game isn't your best move.

It's not so tight or i wouldn't be doing it. But i can't go above and beyond on my spending like wallet warriors like yourself can.

---
I remember the day the bots were quiet in Jita. It was spooky.
---
You appear to be leaving out what happened during that single-region consolidation.
---
Now, Goons could deliver Delve-level super fleet to at least 3 regions with the supers and titans that they have.  TEST could probably do two regions.
---
Also, the lack of local means you'd need to be ratting in a ship that can last long enough to cyno in help.  Which means players are going to be driven even further into capitals....which makes standing fleets even stronger since there will be even more caps around.
---
And I was wondering if it was the 64bit client going all weird.

Do not miss learning skills at all. Hey new guy, yeah you can play EVE but first train learning skills for a month then come and train fitting skills for awhile.
---
could be interesting, what you think of a rework of PvE in null sec ? anom ratting is boring AF   
---
what if they add more incursion or "mini incursion" like "drifters attack" something like that, maybe a emergent NPC attack (they attaque structures, sov and shit can even take some space and evolve if you let them)  
---
sure it's probably more difficult to code than change some number in reward but is AFK ratting an enjoyable gameplay?  
---
a last if people do "inrcusion" or "invasion?" you can combat/camp those farmers and force the PvP, an annomaly people just let the storm pass

That there is the problem. When EVER has a solo battleship warranted a Titan, carrier and HAW dread response. The answer should be never. I don't care if it's a ratting pocket, or a staging area.

I don't see how this hurts HighSec in any way. It looks to me like a money grab. I perfectly fine with that, and good for you TEST. I think you deserve it. A lot of resources have gone into that Keepstar and if you can make bank well than good for you. I wonder if it's a sound strategic move though. The Keepstar market is still not as complete or stable as Jita's. I've taken to just bringing the loot I steal to Jita just because I want to sell everything at once... not once at the Keepstar and then again in Jita for all the things I couldn't unload quickly. Then again, I'm not really a "markets" kinda capsuleer. I wonder if fluctuating taxes will increase perceived risk to the serious market guys and keep them away too. 
---
In any event, I thank you for the cool looking ganking perch and wish you well in your market piracy. o7
---
See Blitz, if you stopped making awesome videos and just focused on the numbers....! :P
---
Lowsec exists
---
Neat
---
OOF, the reeeeeeeeeeeee is strong with this one.
---
A short spool up time for the cyno, or the ship jumping isn't a bad thing, but if you don't also **make it harder for people to warp away from an engagement**, nothing changes.
---
that, and sometimes left click is "oops forgot your left click".
---
Did not lose a ship to that… yet.
---
And local is supposed to be complete safety? Nice koolaid, trash.
---
Username checks out.
---
That's a fun scenario, because with that scenario you're basically requiring your defense fleets to be active continually to move with your ratting forces. That's putting a lot of time tax on people, considering fatigue exists.
---
Then odds are Snuff is waiting to drop titans on you on the other side
---
When did I say it's underpowered? "Not as strong as local" doesn't mean that, don't be stupid, you are trolling yourself there buddy.
---
And yes, knowing where is every single enemy in the region is (instantly) is more powerful than knowing that someone is mining/ratting/jumping some jumps away. If you are hunting a lot of shit can happen going there.
---
And if you get more precise intel by crossreferencing with zkill and other places you are putting a little more effort into it than just having a bot reading local.
---
Gallente ships must pay for their sins with their looks
---
pretty normal playing from Australia :(
---
Dude your mailbox man must went lost
---
&gt;with no reasonable counterplay until after an attack has commenced 
---
Majority of eve is won before a single shot is fired. The counter play occurs before you undock. You prepare and plan appropriately and have an exit strategy if things don't go your way.
---
C3-NS represent! :P
---
That's true in the strategic sense, but those are not tactics that can be executed upon directly.
---
It took years for player's to be treated as a resource.
---
I hear you, but we've had ships of every size come in, light cynos and are facing a dread bomb or 75 Lokis or Muninns.  I don't think any group aims for good fights in their ratting pockets. They want it inhospitable.
---
Its spelt 'no' btw
---
Oh yea! Did y’all see the Atron redesign that goes with this?
---
I only came to the comments to find out what the hell POTBS was. Still don’t know :(
---
Lowsec gate to Stain confirmed as still more likely.
---
I have opinions.  I'm not an unbiased observer. I want the game to continue and grow and that means even playstyles I don't like. 
---
As I have said before, it's not CCP's role to "break the blue donut".  The '"donut" is human dynamics.  The game designers are never going to make a change that breaks up the personal bonds of the Imperium or PanFam or whomever.
---
The game designers can give people something to fight over, but only the players can decide to break their cooperation with each other.  
---
If there's something specific you want to hear about, let me know and I'll respond if I can.
---
I mean for us, not whoever is paying us. God damn that would be awks.
---
Oh wow I was wondering if they would change the meta for incursions
---
&gt; But....but...you’re a goon, you’re supposed to be a mega crab, reeeeeeeeee spod brain!!!
---
talk is cheap. 
---
&gt; To me, the true spirit of EVE is to endure risk and uncertainty
---
if he would live by those rules instead of just promoting them he would be nowhere near nullsec alliance level gameplay unless we´re talking topest of megablob top brass positions.
---
Man warp to me is now shields?!? It must have been a long time since I ran incursions in hi sec
---
I mean the one constant in TAPI threads is people with the memories of goldfish rushing in to defend TAPI.
---
Well actually that's not what vily meant
---
And if he did mean it it's not a big deal
---
And if it is a big deal you forced his hand
---
And if you didn't force his hand well then he was a genius for taking the element of surprise
---
But it's easier just to say "neat" to moutbreathing idiots and move on
---
&gt; They want it inhospitable.
---
And I understand that, but CCP has given the people who play the way you play so many tools to do this safely whereas the hunters have none. 
---
Your article mentions no counter play to blackout, yet at the same time there is no counter play to the way in which your alliance plays the game. Just an hour or less ago my corp tackled a ratting carrier who was in a system of maybe 4 people. Our WH was one jump away. We drop 2x sabres, and an inty to get our tackle and cyno inhib is placed. 60s timer is now ticking, Nid drops a cyno and nothing comes in for what felt like a couple of minutes. Next thing you know a dread, fax, and a couple of thanny drop in.
---
Please tell me what counter play there is to cynos when every ship has one and can light one for essentially free? Capitals should NEVER be able to light cynos and bring in even more capitals, it's completely bonkers. 
---
I can't find the post but I believe /r/Suitonia had a great idea for local. Make it so alliances can put down Observatories that grant the null sov holders the ability to see the local count (that would be it). TLDR: larger alliances can't pack into one system now because too hard to keep track of local. Smaller alliances can keep track more easily since they can communicate where they are. Sov holders still have their citadel perch spam on every gate and can watch gates if they feel so inclined. 
---
I'm all for you guys having "security" in whatever systems you want it in, but the level it is at today is absolutely bad for the game. As I mentioned before though, if you're looking for ISK-Online, where you all just grind ISK safely, save build caps, then get your Titans go for it. But who's realistically going to want to fight?
---
Flair checks out
---
Oh no you're actually stupid.

I'd at least like to see the tractor beam bonus replaced with something useful. It's pretty outdated with the introduction of MTUs

yep i have this issue as well I just thought ccp was blacking out my left clicks as part of the event
---
You’re an idiot and no amount of explaining will go anywhere with you.
---
Thoughts on making bastion disable prop mods/warp, but not disable movement? Still functionally static in terms of ability to dictate position on grid, but gives some hope of enough transversal to avoid dread blap.
---
  Very true. it’s one thing to say something, a complete other to live by it which in itself can be an arduous task hence why a lot of people take the easy way out.
---
I mean lets be real, brave is just like every other alliance at this point and overkills with supers just as much as everyone else.
---
Everyone who has actually roamed to your space knows this. You guys might be marginally less competent I'll give you that.
---
had a similar concern last night. Shit started being weird or not responding,  I was sure i was gonna DC.
---
You wouldn't have happened to watch their process at EVE North would you?
---
They are very specific about both looks and the pipeline in order to make sure that the ships actually work in EVE.
---
I have done it many, many times. It just takes time and patience to get things lined up properly. If they are orbiting you can usually bump them enough to keep them from aligning (especially if 100mn fit) and warping before your gang can get more points and scrams on them.
---
Yeap, happened to me a couple of times. Btw is anyone else getting like freezes when opening the character screen, while it's trying to render / load the character image / avatar?
---
No but we eat quafe pods
---
Sure, those are valid points.
---
&gt;thats just a fancy way of removing auto agro entirely
---
I disagree. 
---
A ship with 100mbit bandwidth will be able to field five medium sized Auto-Drones. It just means that they'd be fighting well under their weight class because they can only deal a fraction of their regular DPS.

I'm not exactly a wallet warrior - I just prefer to play the game the way I want to and not have to "go to work" when I turn on the PC.  Dropping $20 now and again for plex allows that.

This video is everything I hate about Eve bar botting and shitadels...

I came here from there by something of a scenic route. Ten years from now, Randomius willing, I'll still be laughing maniacally at the rookie shipping specialist as he complains about a 30-jump route in his plotter as countless thousands of Witchspace tunnels flash through my mind.

"Hey sonny, quit yer bellyaching for a minute. Have I ever told you about doing my part to repair Jaques Station after his misjump back in the old days?"
---
"Only seven times now, pops."
---
"Ye'r damn right it was seven times! Seven trips to that nebula and back ferrying repair materials for the station and station components for the new colonies springing up around. And this was all before some Buckyhead discovered the Neutron Highway and all them boy racers started wiring alien doohickies to their frame-shift drives to cut a round trip down to a lazy evening!"
---
"You never did tell us what the hell a frame-shift drive is, grandpa."
---
"'Course not! I was a Commander, not an Engineer. But you kids have it easy nowadays, most of you never have to think about fuel for your drives or whether the next hydrogen-rich star is in one jump or ten. Why I tell you ... Hmm I'm out of evil juice ... gotta go to the still and piss up some rum ... Now where are my glasses?"
---
Excellent. So I should expect more Bruce Willis style ass whoopings unless I skill into a Titan or join an empire Corp.... Great.
---
Wormhole space currently provides the best isk/hr you will get. If you think otherwise I suggest you actually spend some time in a highclass wormhole.
---
QQ
---
You're not wrong about getting dropped - but if you live in, say a C2 NS/C5 and have connections to the drone lands, or somewhere else less talented, you can get a ton of kills with it.
---
&gt;but an ~~AFK~~ camper is sometimes AFK and sometimes watching the system. 
---
Surely that's what you mean. 
---
Sometimes the cloaky camper is present at keyboard, and sometimes they are not. 
---
Do you consider a present cloaky camper to be bad for EVE?
---
This post is a mess. 
---
Proof-read and try to string together something slightly better than belligerent rambling vaguely tied to a point.
---
I've been noticing (today) right click delays when dualboxing. Like I'd right click, open a menu, select warp, and have to do it 2-3 times before seeing the effects on screen/in-game. Seems like a similar problem, glad I am not the only one: really feels like they broke something in the 64bit client after today DT.
---
Are there any reports of kills for the Cassandra Tyrannos drifter reinforcements? (I see none on zKillboard)  I usually pop off the Autosynthian lancers for fun when travelling, but today I saw a pack with 2 of the Cassandra Tyrannos cruisers alongside and just barely escaped with my marauder.
---
I have the same issue and since it has been a thing I also have weird graphic glitches and sometimes stargates are invisible (the later happend to 1/5 of the fleet yesterday).
---
This is the opposite of a problem.
---
I want to start a GoFundMe to pay for the Imicus' medical bills so it doesn't have to fly around on a crutch anymore.
---
What the fuck is Sparc and why have I never heard of it before?
---
Lowsec still has a few fights in them and are probably perfect for small gang if you want to give that a shot
---
EXCUSE ME WAT? THIS LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING
---
Oh, it absolutely does, but if you increase null income and not wh income, it's just another "nerf" for wormholes.
---
Why isn't this in the "no question is stupid" thread?
---
If you're not fast enough to kill it... bring a cyno inhib. They got buffed and only take half the space they used to!
---
If you lack dps drop it - most players won't be fast enough to respond.
---
Generally even in Delve subcaps are not safe! A Cyno is no magic get-out-of-shit button you want it to. It is for capitals and similar vessels that can sustain the 1min anchor time of an inhib but normal battleships or anything smaller usually dies fast enough to make it completely useless.
---
You guys need to bring correct ships tho...
---
Maybe try to roam in Hecates, even shitfits get about 700dps and placing five Hecates on top of a Rattlesnake is a guaranteed kill - most sneks go for sniperfit anyways and you can easily drop on them at 0 with combat scanner.
---
If you roam null you have to expect cynos, if you're not prepared for the most obvious and standard response ... man dunno.
---
You see for events like that you only can bring vessels with jumpdrive, normal Cruisers etc are way too slow and the victim dies in few seconds anyways. If you have more space and want to defend it you need a jumpdrive to respond. So for homedefense there will allways jump in capitals because NO other ship can be fast enough because noone else has a jumpdrive. Forming a fleet of +10man getting them all into staging system, refitting to combat ships and undocking / traveling to desto takes ages.
---
Its best that all random ratting supers in an area are in the same voicechat as the victim / general voicechat for the region and if somebody gets dropped, you can call the amount of ships, type etc and then after considering the odds they might jump one or two ships to scare of the attacker, those guys will likely rat in their new system with you in too until their blue aids is gone and they can go back.
---
If you have a proper capital umbrella and force people to voicechat or die in silence you can even defend subcaps... but usually not, they die too fast! 
---
So bring dps and an inhib.
---
He's saying that active cloaky campers are excluded from the current discussion, because the title is about AFK camping and not active camping.  It's a technicality, but kind of an important one.
---
I agree with you insofar as it nerfs AFK camping and buffs active camping.  I plead the Fifth as regards emergent gameplay centered on local removal.
---
I'd like to propose an addition:   
---
c) Inhibs prevent the expansion of active cynos.
---
lol there was never a time where it was 50 SP to join null. It may have been some null, but likely not even most of it.

Or fun....

I’m new to eve. Sort of. I tried two other times over the past ten years. The quality of life improvements, namely the tutorials, have helped keep me playing. The community is also a massive plus as everyone has been friendly.
---
That said, as someone new who has played way more than I should have the past week, I’m happy to see outrage from vets. I read about a coordinated effort to inflate prices. And I can see massive price swings with ore between what people are offering and what people are paying.
---
This couldn’t have come at a better time because now I get solid prices to boost my bank account without competing with people who get 100x more materials in a fraction of the time. If I had a bigger mining ship, I’d clean up all the outstanding offers but I don’t and yet the buyers are still there because lack of competition due to inflated prices.

We ain't playin'. That's just the day we eat all the barbecue.
---
&gt;only because you can cover the cost of the hull after insurance in like 2 or 3 ticks.
---
A tick is 15 minutes, right? Because that sounds like some excellent risk/reward tradeoff. They'll make isk, which is what they want, and I'll blow them up from time to time, which is what I want. And occasionally they'll turn the tables on me since it's not like I'm bringing a swarm of ships, and that's what everybody wants.
---
Truth. Been hardcore playing a week and learn like 10 things new every day. High sec for life! Or for another few weeks

I believe it's a percentage of the difference between your current standing and 10.0

Yeah that's great, i can't. But i also don't rat and live in null.

But nothing wrong creating another instance so that everyone gets the same opportunities though right
---
Nooooooooo

---
I started in 2003, I miss the cruise missle kestrel.

It's never too early to go to nullsec; but if you prefer to stay in highsec, E-UNI is the best place to learn WTF. I joined back when I was new and I learned a shit ton.
---
Wibla would approve
---
&gt; guys we might have to play the game for the foreseeable future.
---
&gt; Which seems to have been the popular opinion/primary complaint about the game.
---
I mean... I just re-subbed after not logging in in 5 years and not playing actively in closer to 7.
---
Hmm, I wonder what's different. OH! GoonSwarm is back on the map! Good for them! And TEST has moved to the South! Crazy! WTF is Pandemic Horde, what happened to Pandemic Legion, oh they're right there. LoD and RAZOR have gotten awfully small. NC. ain't doin too good either. Poor guys.
---
But god dammit if that isn't a ton of familiar names like it's still 2012.
---
Yes, nullsec is in need of some shaking up. I'm surprised the game has lasted this long given how stagnant one of the best features of the game seems to have been.
---
You are an idiot, and Vily/TEST lied, thats really all this thread is about.  You realize that the majority of players using TTT are from null right?  Hisec pubbies literally still use Jita like morons.  Also, I never understood the true extent of built up krab salt tears that were in Goons.  It took a couple dozen of shitposts to frenzy them into an all out attack on highsec haha.  Pathetic man children.
---
[Maulus](https://image.eveonline.com/Render/609_512.png)  did it better.
---
Touché sir, touché
---
neat
---
Isn't the nullsec music meant to change depending on local's population? Wonder if it'll remain as it is, be based on visible population, or be disabled completely. Could potentially prove a useful tool if they left it affected by the true local count.
---
Well...  I love the old design. In fact it's my Favoite. I'm sad to see it go. Cheers to the Mighty Imicus being one of the last ships to get a compleate redesign!
---
If you can't defend 20 structures, maybe you don't need to spam 20 structures.
---
Deleting local was one of those ideas. Balancing a system that is one sided I'm favor of the hunted will necessarily occur as a result of changes that benefit the hunters.
---
 Well regardless of Corp or alliances, I’m always down for some barbecue. Do you have a plus one? Can I come?
---
I feel what you're saying, but also a lot of these entities have changed a lot in the past 5-7+ years. The names are there, but the attitudes have changed
---
Goons now are nothing like goons were in 2010ish. PL has pretty much been supplanted in relevance by horde, and with a super different attitude towards the game.
---
NC. and TEST are sorta similar in philosophy as they were I think, but the dynamics of the NC. and their place in the game is changing. TEST is just big and relevant now
---
Ok, but if null has no local, wouldn't wormholes be safer than null? If we are talking about risk avoidance.
---
I fully expect downvotes from those who don't want this to be a discussion. I also expect name calling in lieu of actual thoughtful pro/con arguments.
---
Interesting. Where do you draw this info? Would like to read.
---
WE. EAT. ALL. THE BARBECUE.
---
Not sure if software engineer, or macroeconomics advisor...
---
Standing gains in EVE are built on an assimptomatic equafion, The equation tends towards 10 but never quite gets there, and the closer you get to 10 the more standing it takes to raise it.
---
At one point the game just throws its hands up and makes a maxed standing 10 instead of 9.99 but that is just CCP )round wizardry at work.
---
They've also since changed the spelling of 'missle'.
---
no, what matters is that whole market's worth of brokers fees and the like, not to mention the time and effort to set up the market again. 
---
Jita 4-4 did not become the trade hub of eve because it was the most optimally located, or lowest taxes, or any of that. It was because it was a stable and secure place to always be able to buy and sell. That is what the TTT provides
---
If anything null income needs to be nerfed. Under any of the super umbrellas your basically completely safe unless your braindead or don't watch intel channels. The local change will IMO not make much of a difference to this.
---
At least in wormholes you have the risk of hunting groups rolling into you or roaming connections popping up (or if your krabing a static, the locals logging in).
---
That a shitty defense people pull out for a lot of companies.

A combination of Inheritance, Templar One, Talking to a few CCP folks (CCP Affinity once corrected me and specified that the Drifters were not the _same_ as the Sleepers, but were obviously working together). 
---
The Drifters actually kill Sleeper bodies in order to create more copies of themselves and the Other orchestrated all of this in order to escape from the Construct (Jamyl was semi-possessed by the Other when she ordered the formation of the Templars,  as well as releasing the shielding tech just before being assassinated by the Drifters). 
---
Drifter Description: Emerging from the ruins of the Sleeper civilization spread throughout Anoikis – otherwise known as 'W-space' – the Drifters represent a tremendous challenge and perhaps a dire threat to the empires and capsuleers alike. Seemingly the inheritors of a legacy left behind by some of the most ancient Jove, the Drifters are unafraid to wield tremendous power in response to any who get in their way. In this regard, the Drifters are a very different conundrum than the relatively benign presence that was the Jove Empire.
---
From Templar One we know the Other has more or less taken over the construct and has subjugated the Sleepers.
---
I argued against one point he was making about all these fancy tools hunters have which involve staring at 15 minute old cached data and making a guess compared to what essentially is live region wide instant response radar
