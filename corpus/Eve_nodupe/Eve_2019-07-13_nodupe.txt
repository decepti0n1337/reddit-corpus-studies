When you are so bad-good at building ships, they manage to rust in space but still kick ass.
---

---
Although sadly most of the new models don't have that, might fall apart at any second look.
---
---
---
 :|
---
I loled
---
Yup just not a fan of the appearance. How information is displayed is important and personal preference
---
Can you point to a post or someone who said that ?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd like to think it's more than your projecting. :)
---
Nullsec just feels far more empty from all ratting ships :-X
---
I really don't see a problem with delayed killmail, 30 minutes would be cool, an hour would be reasonable.
---
Almost don’t care
---
How do wormholers post such cringy shit on a daily basis
---
Maybe you should adapt to change
---
A letter in the alphabet.
---
This is great, but aren't they going to release a structure which will fix everything for them...takes the shine off.
---
It’s both
---
they rolled for 4 hours trying to get delve, lol was an interesting fleet thats for sure
---
People who disagree or are upset with a poll question are more likely to interact, too.
---
Goons whining, at least that's something for shaking things up.
---
i propose a much longer delay on the kills in null, maybe 12 or 24
---
While the ingame blackout and even to some extent the Dotland blackout doesn't really phase me, the zkillboard blackout has annoyed the fuck out of me.
---
Lol nerd I did by using a different website.
---
Opposable thumbs?
---
I am hiding my excavators inside, you wanna come and play?
---
But they are going to release a structure that will ruin it all.
---
Good thing I posted a hypothetical and your response to that was "that wont happen."
---
Bonus PCU is already down 1k and I can safely bet that will be one of the main numbers CCP uses to determine how this test went.
---
what im going to do to you is nsfw :)
---
honestly the no kb, benefits the whole game.  not just 0.0.
---
i thought the trig stuff just started, kinda disappointing to see it end so soon :(
---
It exists already. [Unofficial EVE discord.](https://discord.gg/JBcAZYA)
---
Imagine my amusement reading about how pretty much everybody doesn't understand how zKillboard works. That's why us programmers have jobs, like most IT people. Squizz owns the site. He can do with it what he wants. Up/down, black/white, it doesn't matter. Just because the community uses it doesn't entitle the community the right to have it up and running at all times.
---
As for the blackout, I like it. A board and ranking system takes away from the game play itself and turned it into a competition of who can kill the most. Not exactly what EvE set out to be.
---
I like it! It plays nicely with the Blackout theme and making nullsec dangerous again.
---
No. The difference is that people are actually flying engagable ships. Today is the first time ive flown in ns in 2 years where i didnt get caps dropped on me from a cyno. 
---
We fought multiple fleets, chased some solo and small gang pilots and generally had an awesome time! And people have already started adapting, like using tanked mining barges as bait for cloaky defenders. We got caught by 2 loki's sat cloaked next to a hulk fleet in our thrasher gang. lost a couple of guys, jumped the gate to the next system and ran into a roaming retribution gang.  It was awesome!
---
Thanks CCP. I haven't seen so many ships in space having fun fights in such along time!
---
im actually having anxiety about not being able to see the green on my killboard today
---
so does mean that WHer's are now the Carebears
---
I can’t listen to it right now, but I appreciate that someone made A FUCKING THEME SONG for the Blackout
---
What does rolling a worm hole mean? I’m a newbro
---
so now WHer's are the carebears, Null sec is anarchy, but we have blops and cynos...what a time to be alive
---
I think that advocating for CCP to do a version of this is excellent, but doing it on your own before then is good too. Gathering intel from third party tools is too necessary in the game today.
---
Oh yes, CCP is helping null krabs immensely by flooding nullsec with instalock structure grinding Drifters and turning off local intel. 
---
oh wai-
---
Pretty sure those skins are already in game? Or are those other skins you get for ded lp
---
so are we the leet guys now....WHer's are real carebears now. no cynos or blops on them
---
This^
---
Oh, hey.  Look at what you added to the thread.
---
...and the tears of disappointment begin...
---
Reddit's preview ruined this for me.
---
Wormholes are so nice, the people are so helpful :).
---
Nerd &lt;3
---
It was not made it was a song that reminded of it
---
Cool, wasn't sure if that was still a thing.
---
So a normal day in EVE
---
Lame.
---
But it does say *that year*... hope or bad redaction?
---
Who?
---
**Banned**
---
**Reason:** Inappropriate levels of competency and coordination between players in violation of Texas Law
---
A wormhole has a mass limit that can pass through before it collapses. If you pass enough mass through it, it will collapse. Rolling is passing enough mass through a wormhole to make it collapse.
---
I for one welcome the black.
---
One hour seems excessive.  Maybe by 15-30 minutes?
---
So it is your opinion. Got it. All I needed to know.
---
Wish granted, dotlan is there but it is reporting zero kills every region I have checked.(maybe it sources it's info from zkill)
---
Get out of my swamp!
---
There's literally a post about this 3 posts below yours.
---
Just need an inflow of one that has comment section for every kill/loss for sweet smack talk/tears/fight analysis like the good old days of battleclinic.
---
(Bracing for downvote barrage lol)
---
good job bees :-)
---
Brutix Navy Issue fleets more often pls (SIOT + ASCEE = best police officers)
---
Diddn't add anything to the thread, added plenty to your mum last night though.
---
At least there is no mining in delve anymore. Too many excavs died within 6 hours
---
This only works with Very Large Holes though, what do you do for C4 and below?
---
Why not both?
---
Those are already on TQ...
---
This will root out the real null sec players. I think this is how it should be. Nowadays everyone just docks up. Intel is too easy to track.
---
I certainly hope they rethink that strategy, and never add a mechanic that brings local in NS back.
---
Don't use a dread, just use something that makes less than half the isk
---
If you want to run sites all week, rattles are a good option
---
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT????? 1000 titans and more supers could defend a region from random trash roaming gangs....  
---
"think of the little guys" L O L
---
Given that the primary reason Goonswarm Federation began fining any membercorp that provided corporation APIs to zkill was because it provided an instant intel feed to anti-hisec ganking websites, this would not suffice.  
---
A delay on all killmails by at least one hour would suffice from Goonswarm Federation's perspective of providing instant intel, which is also the \*stated\* reason for the local blackout.
---
Okay that explains a lot, I though everything I knew about dotlan was just wrong lol
---
 Delay display/API of nullsec and wspace killmails by one hour 
---
I see it fine being done in Null, but no reason in WH, in WH space its not a "delayed" local, even though its the same right now.
---
This video is not only hillarious but it raises a good point about how the blackout doesnt give nullsec more content.
---
No local =/= no cynos
---
The data is only useful if it's complete.
---
If I had to sum up how this changes roaming NS, it would boil down to just one word: 'Immersive'. I hope they do not spoil this by adding a structure or mechanic that brings local back.
---
Dotlan going limited information and zkill blacking out as well today means you need to rely on your past knowledge, communication, and lots of scouting more than ever and has made the game so much fun. I hope CCP is watching.
---
Never not Eurobeat
---
Oh no. What will we ever do without 1000 AFK/Bot players
---
Hey, to each their own.  It's the hunter's choice on targeting prey.  If they just want to target excavators or barges, so be it.
---
Make $450,000 less quarterly?
---
r/DMVfarts
---
Interesting how everyone wants to tell everyone else how they should play the game.  You should not want instant access to kills.   You should want to be hunted while you pve.  Going on constant strat op fleets isnt enough remove local and gate camp.  
---
How about we turn off concord for a 2 weeks and let everyone slaughter in high sec.  Oh not the carebears.....
---
Hey Squizz,
---
First off, thanks for all the hard work one way or another. I know first-hand how important these services are, how much people rely on them, and how rarely anyone gives thanks for them.
---
With that said, I have to side with those disagreeing with this change. My motivations are purely selfish, but as out of town all weekend, not being able to see how kills are going really sours the whole EVE experience for me. The KB is so damn important that it's one of the major ways as a regular player I can enjoy the game when I'm not in it. If I can't shoot stuff, I can at least see who's dying - or for that matter who's not dying. Plus that information answers a question I'm sure everyone is dying to know: does this increase or decrease meaningful PvP? So this is, at least in my book, the very worst time to have the killboard turned off.
---
Truthfully, I can't say I'm a fan of a delay either. If CCP wanted to do it themselves, then sure, that's their will. But otherwise? As a roamer, having the killboard makes it a lot easier for me to find out what's going on in space, and ultimately try to find some good fights.
---
But that's just my $0.02. It's your board, so you should do as you want to.
---
I miss Down the Pipe.
---
They still do if you listen with the right kind of ears.
---
That roaming WH is safe, go check it out.
---
There's nothing to stop him. There can be nothing to stop him.
---
As you know. But your post has nothing to do with actually being concerned with him doing this, and everything to do with planting a seed of doubt in people's minds about the service provided.
---
Because it'd be in your favour if people began to distrust it, and revoke their keys. 
---
It doesn't matter who ran it. You'd be doing the same thing. (except, perhaps, if it were a goon.)
---
wait, let me get in my VNI for your gaming pleasure
---
pet peeve of mine, hate that BONGONGONGONGngngng it's so unnecessary
---
Looks just like a sleeper lol
---
why only Drone Damage Table??
---
where is Fighter Damage table??
---
MWD marauders.
---
Don't mess with LS kill mails. It's pretty  cluch for finding action in the warzone.
---
You have instanced pve, highsec, ded sites, WHs rolled to relative safety, umbrellas to rat under... you just cant trivially earn isk with squishy ships and no support in random null space anymore without being at risk of pvp.
---
Oh noes.
---
~~phase~~ faze
---
Worry not, we shall endure until we establish a beachhead in secured space.
---
CCP needs to put the delay on its side. I don’t want to see good changes like this undercut by other third party developers.
---
To be fair this all just sounds like normally CCP. For a long time I wouldn't see killmails for a good 20-30 minutes after I got the kill.
---
eveeye states it gets data from zkillboard lol
---
Just do it!
---
Rotten bastards, all of you.
---
Just make some more zkillguide videos
---
PA has grossed more than $1 billion off of BDO alone. Do you really think they're going to care about a short term loss from an IP acquisition in a transitory period? 
---
Or better yet, do you think they're going to give a shit about a 16 yr old failing PC MMO when what they really bought were the rights to the Eve brand? They're already in the process of making a mobile version that they can have more creative control over and develop it the way they want from the ground up. So once they launch the Eve mobile game in Asia with all of the microtransactions that those types of games can pull in, do you really think they're going to bother with Eve Online for PC if it's not making money? No, they're going to shut it down and stick to the mobile game that's making money. 
---
So if you and all of your little buddies want to keep throwing your little tantrum and think you're actually going to hurt CCP's bottom line to convince them to keep the game the way you want it, you're only hurting yourself if you actually want the game to survive another few years.
---
Looks like someone is dropping a fortizar
---
Jita kills.  Is today's Jita's ganks a reaction to the 0.0 inability to PVP with the changed nul sec tactics? Or am I reading too much into this?  After all -- where are those big nul sec battles?  Why do their dummy corps only go for "easy" kills?
---
Actually I haven't.
---
Delve is for Goons. Anime is cartoons.
---
STFU
---
if they were stealing them you will never know, the kills wont show up till Squizz reactivates the killboard which I am hoping wont be until Local reappears.  Because in my opinion all intel should be player generated, no CCP supplied intel via ESI endpoints or the ingame map.
---
PING@STUNT
---
It looks like a set oh ear buds. I thought it was a joke?
---
Hey, I haul stuff through WHs sometimes. DM me and I'll see what I can do for you.
---
Oh yeah thats a good one
---
That's a middling-quality record, in all honesty. No Ride the Lightning, that's for sure.
---
In time this sounds becomes a necessity you need to hear every 3 seconds... If you don't hear it when undocked your heart will start pumping like it does for the hull damage sound.
---
;)
---
Thank you for the offer, but we are gonna do this ourselves and just needed some advice 😊😊
---
You went too far
---
Hey stop giving shitty advice! We're trying to help them here
---
No I think CCP has certain goals they are required to meet for the sale, and if those goals aren't met CCP gets less money. I also like you think its a tantrum and not people voting with their wallet as often players are instructed to do if they don't like something. I don't see you calling the players that left for not having this supposed content as throwing a tantrum as well.
---
#**SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!!!**
---
Mmmm yeah that's *not* a common occurrence.
---
You don't have any idea of the terms of the sale any more than I do. It's a moot point to argue. 
---
Do whatever you want to do and shit will shake out how it does.
---
Ok then back to my original question, if I am right and this is a failure of CCP, why not try adding local to wormholes, that could add people to get the game?
---
Details at all?  looks epic
---
Nice Squizz and I totally support the delayed killmail processing for nullsec.
---
My heart feel empty when they don't shitpost local. Maybe I should get proffesional help. :(
---
x47 timer; jumped ontop of like 3 hostile supercap fleets; bosoned subcaps; got a luckiy bump; screamed at friednly fcs to open fleet and got out
---
If you're in the same corp, can't you just check Corp Kills/Losses?
---
Oh shit so you were diving in the middle of the enemies that’s awesome lol. I was confused at first why the blues were so far off, well done
---
Yikes
---
Your name sounds so familiar.... weren't you the dude that "tested" a Keepstar DD on PK's Rag?
---
I would prefer not to have my kills or losses posted at all. I haven't opted into it, and I tried but I can't opt out of it. It's such a powerful tool, as long as it exists you have to use it to stay competitive.
---
And now even Horde will be doing the same ah ah ah
---
and it worked better than expected
---
Unless it comes from CCP, I dont think you should be one to do it.
---
Respectfully, as a Jew it offends me when you use my culture/race in that way.  Not trying to make an SJW thing of it, but it makes you sound like a bit of a bigot.
---
Very rarely. I think T3C make up less than 5% of my kills. My top 5 ships are all nano ships or brawlers. Cloaky hunting I do when I want to be spoopy
---
No
---
Wee - and I cannot stresd this enough - Woo
---
Why would you say that??? Plenty of pve still there, now the risk vs reward aspect is more balanced.
---
I would say so
---
I felt a little bad for the guy. Getting blueballed and then that.
---
I've seen many here say they are using Miner II's and baiting. I'm sure someone somewhere did not know about the backout and have lost them.
---
You want their gas, they want day ass
---
They are no different than kra s at that point, they are avoiding content and risk as hard as possible
---
Shouldn't have awoxed the cyno
---
Most of the ratters were basically uncatchable anyway, without log off traps. They will return if the event lasts (hopefully becomes permanent).
---
The gatecamps will also calm down to more reasonable levels once people remember how boring they are. 
---
If this becomes permanent it will make fights much more interesting and active scouting much more important as fleets dodge around systems to outmaneuver their opponents.
---
Because the internet.
---
how many years have we been saying remove local?
---
fair
---
yes fuck you very much.
---
Those are already in TQ. I've been wanting those skins for a bit but the ones I want aren't in stock.
---
Tru
---
Technically, you can use the in-game maps for that..
---
Go back to high sec and you will be ok.
---
I just fought three different groups in fifteen minutes. Came away with solo killmails, gfs in local, and insurance money. So pumped!
---
HTFU
---
Did you just link the same thing to like 5 different people who don’t give a single shit about your screenshot
---
Polls are too easy to brigade.  Comments are too easy to manipulate.  The people don't know what the people really need.  In the immortal words of Nike...
---
JUST DO IT
---
jitA?!
---
That's what I noticed. The scouting is what kept me alive. Being able to ping without worry of a bubble was important. My fessor is a bit tight on cpuso I can't itr combat probes.
---
I can imagine for fleets in null, scouting will be the key to either getting nuked or surviving and killing the enemy fleet. During the engagement, scouts will actually have to sit on the out and in gates to give the warning fcs need. 
---
For small roaming gangs, it's even more important for situational awareness. 
---
My favorite thing though is that once gate came die down, it makes solo hunting even better if this continues.
---
Yeah they ruined this one gem of invasion with the blackout and drifter shit.
---
THIS FUCKING GUY
---
do it man. be a part of the historical moment.
---
Can you collapse it on purpose If some one else is in there?
---
Never
---
Nullsec blocks have no business in high lul.
---
Can you collapse it on purpose if there is some one else in there?
---
I do not have a lot of inner working knowledge, but I think the moment the ingame killmail arrives is the moment that zkill and other tools can see it happen through the ESI. Because the ingame killmails takes the esi information as-is to create the killmail I think. You can right click the ingame killmail and get an external api link to the killmail ESI info.  
---
I would prefer for it to not show up ingame either for 1-24h just for this reason. Otherwise Goons etc would just make a tool where you can (and will pretty much be forced to)  manually paste your killmail just to have instant up-to-date information.  
---
Personally, I find external information like killmails etc information that shouldnt exist in the first place, at least not without a 24h delay.
---
Didn't the Levi that came with you die?
---
Shhhh.  Down vote yourself please.
---
Create a channel with the list of kills in the MOTD. Link channel. Boom, that's your kill report.
---
\&gt; plenty of gangs/soloers and defence fleets around, none of these would have existed prior to black-out. 
---
In GE- we had a couple of excited gangs come through, but they always do. A single Goon madman brought a HAW bling rev to get fried. Pretty much a Tuesday as far as GE- is concerned. The difference is entirely psychological, these roamers could have roamed here any day of the last week, month or year.
---
The only discernible difference i can see is this: all the risk averse shitters have either not logged on, or are skulking around being triple careful. Yes i'm looking at you Simple Farmers, it took the thick end of an hour to kill that rev with T1 hangar trash because we all expected you to blops or dread bomb it. What's the matter, don't like killing spaecships?
---
TLDR Anyone could have done any of this at any time in the last two years, people are hypnotised by their own whining.
---
Reddit posts up   Logged on pilots down.  
---
Yup seems to be a great first 20 hours or so~~~~~~
---
Remember this far into drifters there was general novelty left.  That abated quickly.
---
^(Darwin roam) &gt;!THAT LITERALLY NEVER HAPPENS!&lt;
---
I've lost to them before. Because I forgot to dock up before going AFK.
---
I don't entirely agree with that statement, but I get your point.
---
You can choose to ignore the facts, your choice. Fool.
---
nothing new, its just extremely rare
---
Just posted exactly this in another thread, sir.
---
Passive, apathetic shitters need mechanics changed to change their activity, when it's the activity change that changes everything.
---
No i can't because rorqual
---
Lift your API (I heared goons are already doing so whatever), Go and make your own then lol
---
&gt;  I play in provi if your not in a empire boarder section your the carbear
---
**you're**
---
Seek medical attention immediately.
---
&gt;All the krabs are docked up not doing anything
---
Stats show the 1900 spike as 2000 less than this time last week. This hasn't really changed anything and your attitude about krabs sounds uninformed.
---
Slightly more small gang, slightly less Rorq dunks, woo hoo.
---
Will my rolling Phoenix work?
---
A basic understanding of the interwebs.
---
Yeah.
---
Webs work very effectively on rats. 
---
Tracking disruptors ECM and Sensor Damps dont.
---
If someone is still inside the wormhole system, you mean? Yes, you can collapse the wormhole connection at any time. If someone is in the system that wormhole connected to and was planning on using it to get out, they'll have to scan down a different wormhole connection instead (or they're just stuck if they don't have probes).
---
The fact that we often use 'wormhole' to refer both to the connections between wormhole systems as well as the systems themselves can get a bit confusing. In this case he's talking about collapsing the wormhole connection - the thing you jump through to go from one system to another. This deletes that connection, so anyone planning on using it can't. You can't be 'in' the wormhole connection when it's rolled, though, it's just the equivalent of a gate. (I suppose technically it *might* be possible to roll the wormhole at the exact moment someone else is jumping through, in which case they'll probably either fail to jump or appear at a random location/the sun in one of the two systems, but that's a real edge case.)
---
The fuck...?
---
Do you not run into Tank issues with only one T2 repper?
---
I find that while most of the time i dont need the second repper, for the hell spawns its needed.
---
Yeah it was a pretty cringe ping back in the Casino War
---
No now gas yourself weeb
---
Welp, I’m a lil confused now. I didn’t know there was two kinds of wormholes. I thought there was only one kind of wormhole where people ratted and did data sights
---
Definitely!  You should undock...
---
This one pisses me off a bit.  I don't need ratting info - but how about jumps per 24 hours?
---
yesssss yesssssssss
---
"No one cares. Deal with it" - Nullsec to Wormholers when it was implemented
---
You do you fam, no one pays you to do this shit...and you provide a service that 90% of /r/eve players rely on as a CORE function of the game...that isn't provided by CCP so...
---
you do you
---
Yea, stuff like that is kind of game breaking.  I'm all for removing all intel crutches from null.  The only difference between null and WH space will then be that the WH map will be constantly changing while the nullsec map will be static.  I love it.
---
This is low effort but at least it's not reeee blackout reeeee CCP in  unsubbing. Take your upvote.
---
Sorry the service he made and hosts for your convenience and pays for out of his own pocket is not to your liking.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I miss winamp
---
what system?
---
Shut up Jew.
---
What'd be nice is once local comes back, it's been 'permanently damaged' and it takes a small amount of time for you to show up in local, like 5 seconds
---
yes 100%, delay the km's.  Any intel not given or gained by the actions of players in the game is a bad game design mechanic and should be eliminated.
---
Free torpedo delivery included! *warning: torpedoes may be armed. *
---
I mean, if I was able to pay the dude for it I would, but not after a stunt like this.
---
the first thing i did when i logged in was shitpost. should i join test?
---
there is J-Space which has J-1230593 codes and there is normie space, wormholes can allow you to travel from J-&gt;Normie Normie-&gt;Normie and J-&gt;J. J space does have data and ratting sites, but some turbo nerds also live in them as well.
---
Eh sure it's low effort, but it was fun to make. Just a result of me messing around with a vector image program. I feel like the sub needed a break from the salt anyway.
---
h
---
&gt; I thought there was only one kind of wormhole where people ratted and did data sites
---
those are the systems, the connection that you use to enter those systems is also called a wormhole.
---
The system itself cannot be collapsed or destroyed, but the connections between that system and anything else can be collapsed, rendering anyone inside (who doesn't have probes) stuck.
---
Just 1 plex, or 500?
---
Gave good advice? yes we all saw it.
---
Technically, the wormhole is just the path to the system.  It's just a stargate that doesn't have a discernible destination until you've went through it.
---
The system on the other side can be a wormhole system, as noted by the J-sig.  Or it can be a K-space system, otherwise known as known space.
---
Yes, you go through wormholes to explore and run sites.  We call them wormhole systems because the only way in/out is to go through a wormhole.
---
Hope that clears it up a bit.
---
lol. good one. vin
---
"be vewy vewy quiet........."
---
&gt;especially for players who weren't at the point of being able to fly higher end ships like Asteros 
---
Astero training time atm is 18 hours
---
Yeah why would certain posters not care about context or anything that disproves the \~\~\~narrative~~~ ?
---
You're reading too much into this. And that skin has been on TQ for a while now.
---
To get *into* the *hull*, sure. To fly it in any way effectively? No.
---
VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
---
No doubt!
---
I don't know. I hope it is.
---
I am sorry but that feels like free intel either way. For what reason do you want to know if its active?
---
You WANT the pvp fights:
---
Then just keep playing until you get one, otherwise free extra loot and have gained a lot for no effort until that point. Win-win no matter what.
---
You do NOT want the fights:
---
That is a risk you are supposed to take, and is then not there for you. 
---
Everything in EVE is supposed to be player-collected risk vs reward, a pvp-pocket in a pve-pocket should not be excluded. The existence of external sites like killmails, dotlan etc destroys the immersion of the game when you have to rely on out-of-game intel 80% just to "optimize" your actions.
---
Lmao
---
Not to mention that Legacy and Goons have the most members, meaning more targets within their controlled regions.
---
They have always had the chance to give a plex.
---
Hmm I guess you have a point, idk what skills you really need for living in null sec,  I just used it to explore a ton in null which really helped me out early on
---
There are wormhole *systems*, often referred to as just 'wormholes', which are basically just the same as normal star systems - they have celestials and sites, you can warp around like normal, etc. The only difference is that wormhole systems cannot be reached by normal means - gates, cynos, etc. And then you have the wormhole *connections*, *also* often (confusingly) referred to as just 'wormholes', which are simply the actual wormholes that link between two wormhole systems, a wormhole system and a regular system, or two regular systems. These are, mechanically speaking, just the equivalent of gates - you get up next to it and hit 'jump' and you disappear from the old system and appear at the other end of the wormhole in whatever system it connects to. The difference from gates is that wormhole connections have to be scanned down with probes, are random where they connect to, and can collapse either when their duration runs out or too much mass worth of ships passes through them.
---
If people are talking about ratting or doing sites in wormholes, they're referring to doing those things in a wormhole system. Getting there will usually involve passing through a wormhole connection, but the sites are not inside the wormhole connection. You just have to figure out whether people are talking about wormhole systems, wormhole connections, or both, from context/experience.
---
It's usually like a small amount, between like 1 and 4 IIRC
---
Goons can't help but be goons.
---
im pretty sure game time can be gifted. you should have gotten a message saying who sent it to you.
---
" My favorite thing though is that once gate came die down "   
---
People know you are coming, they aren't going to stop camping because sitting on a gate waiting for you is almost the same as sitting on a station in a response fleet waiting for you and they were going to do that anyway.
---
Try again.
---
*Laughs in 220mm*
---
25% chance your cyno just burns out instead of firing
---
It's not about having larger numbers, yet it's about knowing force multipliers. Have some good ewar and support. EAF and Recons are key, you'll see having those in a gang means you can afford to have less pilots in your fleet. 
---
Have a good mix of anti tackle and dps. You'll see a properly formed 4 person gang can be more effective than a 10 person disorganized fleet, granted you know your engagement profile.
---
We're out of tea and cake.
---
Alternatively, fuck goons.
---
what would jump micro drive
---
Rag killed a rorq from Brave then was probed down and killed
---
Nice.
---
thx
---
Lion hunts for food and injury could mean starving to death.
---
CloakBrain hunts for ego.
---
Too many, my friend. This makes me want to come back....
---
Misused is not an accurate word. The information gathered is also part of the sandbox and all players who use it TRUST it to be accurate and without delay. That is the only reason why people submit their killmails. Without this, it loses its value imo.
---
Not satire
---
that time was 5
---
Nice
---
Yeah, two titans went in, and only one survived
---
I love when they do stuff like this and only make it usable for a single thing that only a small group of people actually use.
---
Probably Satan, Though. 
---
Dude's kind of an asshole
---
Beats the shit out of deploying 1/2 way across Eve and getting no fights.... don't need to leave Delve for Content anymore = WIN!
---
Local is primary, regardless of server status.
---
It'll fill up. Also many regions of botting were void. Good riddance to the bots in Period Basis.
---
Which works if you decide to train preemptively and already have access to one I suppose.
---
Personally though I've been gunning for ratting and salvaging / mining for my solo and non-pvp activities rather than exploration which has left me less a bit less able to do anything during these lowtimes with such unreliable information.
---
Is it a me problem? Maybe, i'm no expert or veteran type player, just someone out here trying to get some experience while maintaining some level of self-reliance economically rather than needing handouts from my corp. A good member contributes rather than takes from the corp.
---
Good work Brave
---
this is getting a bit stupid tbh
---
No local for brave to be bothered by so they could actually tackle something for once
---
I was watching your stream, you found like 5 ships in space.  2 Were bait, and 2 were humans.
---
You ran from pretty much everyone other than afk people or ratters.
---
You took longer to find your target than before.
---
Local did nothing to do this, you just grew some balls.
---
IDK if I'd call it a consequence of the blackout. Don't think local missing had anything to do with it dying
---
Just like free intel shouldnt be deciding what actions to take for any player in normal space, it definitely shouldnt be free intel for off-grid pvp areas, so no please.
---
"Hey no local let's hunt Brave Rorqs in our Titans lol"
---
/Seinfeld theme
---
[nice](https://youtu.be/fk2vftulB7w)
---
TO BE FAIRRRRRRRRRRR 7o
---
It was an exciting few minutes but it died *fast*.
---
As long as they run the experiment long enough to get stable data, not a random collection of "oooh shiny new thing" outliers.
---
First off, it is far from being considered a failure. There's been plenty of posts from people having "gud fights" today, regardless of how much people who don't like it keep trying to push the narrative that it's a complete failure less than 24 hrs after implementation. 
---
Secondly, the reason that local has been talked about being removed forever in nullsec is that it provides a means for groups to use 3rd party tools to parse the local list to identify hostiles in a huge region using afk intel bots. It makes Nullsec way safer than it should be by allowing people to be alerted to threats outside of an active player intelligence network. 
---
The idea you are pushing about local being added to wormholes is a strawman argument. You're trying to force me in to a position to argue against adding local to wormholes so can try to justify your position in arguing against taking it away from Null. 
---
The fact is that neither should have any sort of mechanic that allows the ease of threat recognition that local provides. The problem is exponentially worse in null due to the ability to map out threats many systems away in relation to your own position providing you with a real-time map of threat analysis in an entire region of space. At least with wormholes it's not a static network of systems where you can accurately predict and defend the direction the threat will come from.
---
because you couldn't possibly automate d-scan somehow
---
So how do I tell the difference between a wormhole system and a wormhole connection where I scan them down?
---
Low effort shitpost, have a downvote.
---
Im saying its difficult to defend or roam with a small group of only line members online, conversely bigger groups or primetime groups will be maintaining their territory much better and have more experienced pilots which can FC roams and know what they're doing.
---
the one that got away, nice vid
---
Fake news, no zkill link :DDDDDDDD
---
Free external intel shouldnt dictate how you play ingame. 
---
Even knowing IF someone lives in a wh or not without trying to figure that yourself is a *huuge* intel advantage, no matter how you use it. Without delay the information gain is one-way instant high quality intel about potential recent activity, by opening an url. 
---
Without that intel people would have to take more risks, causing more *emergent* content.
---
Right now EVE is 90% intel gathering online, and 10% action.
---
So a roaming gang wants to fight another roaming gang, and they go to the mega alliances territory for it?
---
All this no-local is just showing how risk-averse the normal hunters are.
---
You should rather ask, 'if a fight between two hunter groups was fun, why do you all go hunt afk krabs and whine about no content'?
---
I don't have the spreadsheets handy right now, but I promise you someone's done the math for belt value &amp; ship mining rate converted to ISK, Orca value add, pros/cons of doing industry versus selling ore. Most industry corps have some subset of this information that they make regular use of.
---
The quick vs long sell varies based on market activity, but generally speaking you'll make more money playing market games than you will just filling buy orders. But then you have to babysit your orders, so how does the ISK/hr stack up? Depends on the item and the day.
---
Economical contributions isn't the only way to contribute to your corp. You can contribute with having a positive attitude, teaching new members, leading fleets, going on others fleets, lead small group pve things etc. "Hand outs" from corps come from the taxes you have paid through corp tax, so you technically have paid for those handouts.
---
Eve supposed to be extremely dangerous all the time. For everyone. Needs a bit more changes to get my resub. But I am hopeful.
---
Thanks for making my game better at the expense of others
---
BIG OOF ENERGY
---
A quick initial look shows -10% players compared to last Friday PCU.
---
I'm curious how much isk/hr are you making ratting/mining?  I'd be willing to help you out with exploring sometime
---
Drinking bird only works if it's beak or head are getting wet and cooled.  FYI

---
We committed war crimes against defenseless miners and excavs
---
*"Minimum* training time atm is 18 hours"
---
FTFY
---
I don't think you understand what I wrote. A lot of wormhole groups will scan out several holes deep and then return and roll their static and go again - if there is recent activity in one of those holes you're more inclined to keep scanning and bump into another PvP corp. At which point both groups usually form a fleet and go at it in a hole in between. 
---
Neither group is at a disadvantage by having access to this Intel, it in fact helps both groups by facilitating more mutual encounters and thus fights. Which both groups are after. 
---
Instead, groups are potentially gonna be very close to each other but will not run into each other more often because they'll scan out to a certain point and roll without perhaps going the extra hole or two deep to run into each other.
---
Yeah I think you’re right
---
You know how fun it is to teleport across the galaxy instantly and appear with no warning when you can scan a ship down in 6 seconds?
---
All your local whine is painted on a canvas of 15 years of successful hunting with local.
---
You are going to have to group up more, learn to do solo things as safely as possible, and deal with the occasional loss.
---
It actually is ELUA.  Otherwise I can make the same argument for a d-scan copy-paste intel bot.
---
It just presses a button bro.
---
You've been playing since 7am ET
---
Guess there are people out there have some steam to lose
---
I think you are highly overestimating things. For one, everyone is roaming null right now because of the blackout. Its an event and people want in. Give it a week and those roams will dwindle in numbers.
---
And the krabs arent stupid. If they lose isk on an activity, why would they do it?
---
So all youre gonna get is that the elite pvpers get bored and the krabs wont log in. 
---
That isnt a win for the game.
---
&gt;BY RESUBBING!
---
when i have a need to resub more accounts. i'll do it, and not until then.
---
Imagine thinking alliance flairs are accurate on reddit...
---
Honestly, I believe all of those things are possible even with local, it's just your mindset that stopped you and others from doing what you enjoy.
---
MY CULTURE IS NOT YOUR ENTERTAINMENT
---
When they have 100t in AT winnings sure.
---
So we should all go back to 2007 where alliances are just pvp husks with no infrastructure or core and all isk activity is protected away on neutral high sec alts?
---
Sounds like wow arenas with extra steps.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLB6xdVXDeQ&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Well the initial count is -10% players already on d1.
---
Just find a group that fits your tz better
---
I'd like to make the observation that in this case, blackout isn't Armageddon and still better than having local
---
AAR:
---
I was the Rorq Pilot.   I talked a big game about ice mining in the blackout and not being afraid.   so what do I do?  go ice mining.
---
What happened after the last Ice rock popped so I couldn't panic?   a cyno goes up and 2 titans come in.. I'm insta melted. 
---
I warp to station.  
---
I get my Dictor out
---
probing and warping commences
---
I bubble the titan that nuked my rorq.
---
Calvary rolls in hard... titan melts.
---
It was a good first day of the blackout.
---
7o Fly Brave!
---
You don't scan down wormhole systems. Anything you scan down will be a wormhole connection. That connection might *lead* to a wormhole system, or it might lead to another regular system somewhere else in known space. (If you right click show info on the wormhole connection once you're on grid with it, it'll tell you whether it goes to a wormhole system or a normal system.)
---
As per standard idiot reddit advice on nullsec living, totally clueless with 0 experience
---
what do you think he was doing in Brave space other than taking advantage of the no local situation?
---
You said it, "you are going to have to group up more". How do you think thats gonna play out?
---
I mean, I can nibble at a rock a little bit in a Venture until I actually do start pulling those barge skills in, and I can poke belt rats with a cruiser but thats...really about it and if anyone shows up i'm pretty much instantly dead.
---
Ultimately being that vulnerable alone isn't as engaging as playing another game once the bulk of the alliance is offline.
---
What happened to the second titan?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URTi98rJaLY  AViVA - Blackout
---
do you even play eve? Someone could kill you on a highsec undock if they wanted to do it badly enough
---
&gt;Eve supposed to be extremely dangerous
---
Says where?
---
Thanks for my first Titan Kill !
---
Hello T3C Brother. I was the Tengu :D
---
I prefer sticking with the group i've invested in. This isn't an issue big enough for me to warrant quitting the group i'm with, just changing my activities once they log off and I become an odd one out.
---
I just realized: i am a fuckin addicted to enter in zkill and see what kind of shit is happening. Really, i tried like 10 times in my work today. Countless in my home.
---
Which is what many were saying. This wont affect the established mega alliances (all too much) but will instead fk over any smaller groups. And if they get messed with enough their members will start leaving until they can find safety again, usually in the bosom of an established alliance. 
---
If this lasts any prolonged period of time NS will become even more barren and concentrated. But hey, the game taking a huge hit doesnt matter as long as a minority of hunters are happy right.
---
basically a fuck you to all the people not in a bloc, and not much of a threat to umbrellas, not sure how this does anything but drive people towards big blocs, just like the drifters did.
---
Time for a different killboard.
---
Could still be in system, could be back home. Could be sitting right behind you but you will never know.
---
Just do it. If people don’t want to use YOUR website they can get bent.
---
Lol, let's just host a 2nd zkill that's working. Zkill is an opt in thing... And if you're giving it information then its your choice.
---
eh, won’t really matter. many groups already have killboards for their own alliance/corp, which probably will be expanded. would be fun for a bit to have the delay tho
---
Just spent hours roaming and getting fights, did not see a single cyno. No idea if there is just less inclination to do it right now (looking for the gud fites) or everybody is too nervous to light/jump a cyno right now.
---
Damn it. Now I'm going to be looking behind me all night.
---
Welp time to use another out of game map
---
This is a fantastic change - as someone who has spent the majority of their EVE time in Null, I am very much in favour of this!
---
This will massively promote the predator/prey scenario with miners/hunters, and I suspect this will drive ore prices up, bringing an element of risk back to the game. It'll take time, but I am hopeful. I DO suspect this will see an increase in AFK gate-streaming alts that sit cloaky with the purpose of watching gates for the mining armada.
---
Still, great change.

only in eve will you find ricardo memes (squishy) and old impact memes from the same players.
---
love having an older playerbase than other games lmfao
---
Nothing changed other than your willingness to undock and pick fights.
---
Freighters work too!
---
If anyone was not expecting this outcome, I question their logical reasoning skills.
---
Awesome. Thank you.
---
Which is basically the bots that aren't logging in...
---
If you can't defend yourself, you shouldn't undock. Easy. If you are afraid to loose a a T1 barge or a vni you s should move back to hs. This is where you belong
---
Yea, they don't have a cool name like NCdock
---
No local has allowed people to roam around in space that usually would send 
---
a. a blob
---
b. capitals
---
Now they don't know we're in their house, and we're killing things or dying. So no, it did change more than a mentality.
---
I never said I was an expert, just provided the information I know.  I have lived in nullsec, just not in the same way as OP
---
Lol https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard if you know how to set it up here you go, no need to create a new zkb
---
Ah cmon you are living under the best umbrella ever sponsored by concord. But hey: most of the time highsec pirats gank highsec pubbies
---
No you can't.
---
You would be arguing a process tree.
---
Dscan
---
Then
---
Copy
---
Then 
---
Paste. 
---
Mine is a single action that gives me no advantage over someone hitting their DSCAN hotkey in succession.
---
Me D Scan 1 process.
---
You Dscan Copy Paste. 3 processes.
---
Surely you can see the difference.
---
&gt;I mean, I can nibble at a rock a little bit in a Venture until I actually do start pulling those barge skills in, and I can poke belt rats with a cruiser but thats...really about it
---
This has always been a problem with Eve sadly
---
You couldn't have put those same delays in zkillboard, and left it running?
---
I'm just giving someone who seems to think VNI anom ratting is the pinnacle of income in null something else to do. S/he can do DED's, L4 pirate missions, relic sites, etc.
---
I'm not sure where you got 2007 era ISK making from. And you know, EVE was more fun in 2007 anyways rather than this super organized, min-maxed, capital pumping &amp; spamming mess we have now. Clearly the general EVE population has loved it based on the PCU /s
---
&gt;Im saying its difficult to defend or roam with a small group of only line members online,
---
So no one can lead a small fleet of dudes in T1 ships to get some frags?
---
Yeah they defiantly should try that, sadly this was scheduled before the blackout was announced.
---
Big balled Titan pilot tbh he should've learned how to drive by better

You won't hear an argument from me that CCP are good about handling the little guys in null. They suck at making null a workable place for smaller groups to live in. But that doesn't necessarily mean the blackout is bad. For example, if CCP left the blackout in place but also thinned out resources (longer ore anom respawns, longer ratting anom respawns, etc), it'd penalize larger groups for being a zerg and we might find a nice balance between living a bit more dangerously in a small group and living in too crowded a space under an umbrella.
---
Yeah they did it all super stealthy style so you wouldn't notice. 👍
---
Damn thats a cheap titan
---
The nullseccers are really trying to pull out all the stops to try to sabotage this whole thing. It wouldn't be beyond belief that all of these webmasters are getting paid for doing this. It's actually hilarious at this point. 
---
I guess it's time to develop some private tools. They won't have as pretty of a front end, but they'll get the job done.
---
A bot with automated dscan will be spending more time in warp than botting, due to the fact that it can't tell friend from foe. Let them automate it. A fucking t1 frigate abandoned on a safe will make the system unusable to bots.
---
Dicebot is an Origin. spy! Open your eyes sheeple!

Beep beep here comes the friendly Loki to escort all lost souls to safety.

So let me get this straight since I dont understand the technical aspects. The only thing lacking is consent from the players or their orgs? And you cant build your own since you wont get consent. But you are mad that someone else got consent?
---
Roll any wormholes that appear in your krabbing space with carriers to make sure nobody can ambush you on your home turf.
---
Praise Bob, and may his light continue to spread throughout new eden.
---
Only if you siege on the Jspace side. Need to add the extra mass to do it in one pass
---
Are you suffering from Spodumain withdrawal symptoms
---
Not even Lipton?
---
This isn't stopping shit. This is making everything more fun. EVE is spooky again.
---
So basically you are complaining about people not liking and trusting you enough to do it? Thats kinda on you and your org tho isnt it?
---
You know you can toggle it off right lol.
---
Fayral sucked when he first joined KR so....
---
Totally kidding. He speaks very fondly of Noir often. Thanks for watching.
---
If you get caught by a combat recon you get caught by a ceptor too..... nearly 15 au dscan range with something around 5au/s warp speed gives you 3-4sec+lock time to flee. A combat recon arriving on grid (means you see him on your overview) and exiting warp gives you something around 3 to 4 sec+lock time... if you manage to escape: nice, otherwise you get pointed the one or the other way.
---
Will I still get a receipt for my interaction at the completion of the transaction? I've been hearing about WS not providing a receipt recently.
---
&gt; it'd penalize larger groups for being a zerg
---
No it wouldn't, it would result in more people joining big blocks so they could effectively defend larger areas.
---
And your obviously a carebear who wants to wants to pick a fight because your no longer snugly safe. BTW I live in j space so the changes are good for me:)
---
:( my corp lost a titan, not playing anymore for the time being but still &lt;3 origin.
---
jspace rules apply.

It's entirely too easy to get distracted while you're stroking off.
---
been on a lot of roams today have ya?
---
^^^^^wormholer ^^^^^BTW
---
Proud to be a part of brave
---
Yeah, most (if not all) other tools merely got their data from zkill. /u/Squizz actually held a lot more power than we knew.
---
What did they tell you that to?
---
They are too busy rolling null holes for afk vni kills.
---
eve doesnt count
---
I just wish they had commited to at least the weekend.
---
Again thats what voice is for.
---
It's almost as if EVE is... fun again.
---
Mormons, really. 
---
Wormholer btw.
---
You underestimate people.
---
I can already work around everything you just said and I have no monetary incentive, unlike the people who actually bot.
---
Spiderman.png
---
Go explore or huff gas, get in a fast ship or Astero and shoot at roamers on gates, grab a corp/alliance mate and rat in a group.
---
If you want to play another game, leave you Venture on a moon.
---
You make it look like the only thing in Eve is spinning around combat anoms, if you just want to make isk, grind some missions, do filaments, anything but stay in a hanger and complain that you don’t know if it’s safe.
---
[removed]
---
If you can’t do that, you need to be in a bigger more support group, or learn to work solo.
---
Nullifiers are shit.
---
FCing is entirely doable. I was just a regular grunt in my corp at first, but at one point things were quiet during my timezone so I said hey why not ping for a fleet and get some nerds roaming out our wh. I started small and I got into small gang FCing and I love it. (I am by no means a turbo veteran ultra ubermensch FC, I still have a lot to learn).
---
FCing isn't really about killing stuff, it's about making decisions. One of the most important things is to know your fleet, what is your engagement profile. Are you long range and kitey? Get rid of those enemy webs and damps asap. Etc. I can tell you a bunch of stuff, but you'll only really be able to learn by doing, that's FCing you will learn it all with experience. Start cheap and plan an engagement profile.
---
Just have some buddies scout the entrances for you. Works fine in wh space.
---
I just had a three hour roam full of awesome pvp together with some mates. Not having any crutches to rely on was so amazing. Everyone had to work together to keep eyes out for targets and actually do some thinking to find fights, and oh boy did we get to fight. More of this, please!
---
Might I suggest looting wrecks and running relic sites? 
---
Seriously, nobody loots wrecks it seems.
---
Pull the fuck over!
---
So your way of playing is correct yet his is not? I for one would love to some day get my hands on the Eve bible in which all these rules are written down so I can finally see the big picture.
---
Cause in my all to simple way Im only seeing you telling a subscriber to stop playing the game. Which surely will improve the game. Until they shut the servers down because not enough are playing it.

I have actually gotten peoples stuff doing this.

not on reddit though, this is next level and if I ever leave I'll give you my stuff, including an eve mail with account details for a scanning alt in my wormhole.

How would you workaround the fact that dscan only gives you the ship type and a user-generated name?

Well we *do* have death.

Just fucking do it man

This isnt me being salty, this is just the current state of what I can do with what I have as is on day one.
---
I'm hoping this has a better long game.
---
Yeah call the doc, the retardation has lasted longer than 4 hours
---
Dude, even the nullblobs were saying these things. You are buying into this us vs them a bit too much. This is CCPs doing, not nullblobs. And now they are just reversing it but this way isnt better, its just more crap.
---
The real issues of the game have not been changed. Removing local was never ever going to fix that. Which makes this all the more gimmicky and shortsighted especially considering  a huge part of the game are complaining and it will soon show up in the player count.
---
Man I hope this stays permanent. Had a nice fight today with nothing more than a hope n a dream that I was not about to get blobbed on
---
&gt;You don't have any idea of the terms of the sale any more than I do. 
---
We don't know the exact terms, but we do know there are financial marks they have to meet to get the full payout from the sale because they stated that was the case.  And them throwing the alliance tournament and usual fan fest under the bus using the rational "those things don't make us money" shows they are going to get to those financial marks by any means necessary, so if this test does negatively and significantly affect subscriptions its probably a safe bet they will revert it until Hilmar gets his money.
---
Few guys on comms said they already found n killed people. One had been roaming for 7 hours on n off getting kills
---
Thanks for watching man. Yeah, some of the frustration just came from having to pull away from my fleet mates and not “pull my weight” in those low capacitor times. Mostly giving myself a hard time in attempt at humor. 
---
Very much appreciated the comment.
---
Exactly. Which means that the smaller groups will die out and their members will join blobs. This isnt a good thing.
---
Most of the roams i've seen are T3 cruisers and large T2 and Faction frigates. I haven't seen anything an adhoc off-primetime fleet could realistically take in our area of space.
---
its unfair, i want local, i cant mine, this is bullshit. I nearly died today.
---
[nice](https://youtu.be/SsloEIMVDmk)
---
Fuck OCR Intel bots you should have to sub a bot per gate and wormhole probing bots to have botted Intel channels.
---
Or, if you got time. You can just give it 4 passes.
---
That almost feels like a planted question as that's the easiest one to figure out and there is no way I want to give botters any good ideas.
---
Firstly, is it the correct ship type for my bots, Secondly does it have a unique name in my list of ship names, Thirdly is that name duplicated.
---
Please send all instances of thesw shortcomings directly to me. I'll see to it they are corrected.
---
I hope immediate mode local never returns.
---
Structure should result in a delay of 60-90s.
---
years ago, too much work. #effort
---
90
---
No point in blinging it if you’re just going to meme drop and DD a rorqual. You either escape easily or you die, bling isn’t going to help
---
You should....
---
People are already a part of the blobs or the blue doughnut or getting blobbed to death. Local going away won't change that. 
---
Having to learn the hard way how to solo it has always been a challenge. Nothing has changed there. Always ping on gates when possible. Know when you are in a dangerous pipe, i.e. no celestials to ping off of. Die pointlessly to a few large gate camps. It's all the same.
---
Risk averse people are still going to be risk averse. True, it's impossible to be absolutely sure you're alone, but you're in null sec. It's supposed to be the dangerous outlaw land. If you don't want to lose a ship them dock up.
---
clearly you didn't watch the stream
---
Sadly this man Died and I lived, But he died doing shit that most pilots wont. Going outside of umbrellas and safe space.
---
HI PAUL!
---
There is other activities that you can train into quickly. If you can sit in a venture you are only an hour or two away from huffing gas. Exploration can also be trained up in a day or two. 
---
Also, if you're in null sec, there is an inherent danger. Mash that dscan button and accept that you will lose ships. After you lose a few, you will also learn how to escape and maybe even kill a few hunters.
---
That isn't true. It just means low effort low skill players wont get to afk rat/mine in 0.0. This patch turned 0.0 back to the danger level of like 2006 imo. You absolutely can do solo stuff... but know there is a boogy man out there and caps wont always save you. 
---
Those who are so low effort they can't find other ways to make money will struggle... but it's out there
---
I don't know why you people won't admit that this game is so fucking **boring** and needs to die. There are several alternatives on the market now...
---
Where were you roaming?
---
Please send your location to me and one of our technicians will be along shortly to assist you.
---
It's not like everyone is spying on everyone
---
Huh?
---
Lul eve is now spooky again because poeple are still adapting to new mechanics, you cant keep the feeling of spookines - people will adapt...
---
That's how you mine with a rorq. Well done.
---
Lmao dropping titans in enemy space a few hours after the blackout, when literally everyone is on edge and has ships on standby, super high IQ play.
---
I'd like to thank garreth\_vlox and heston77.  You both expressed your opinion in a way that made me want to keep the conversation going.
---
Because if they want to make isk doing nothing more than spinning around a anom, they’ll make sure he’s safe for the taxs.
---
Jim McNulty
---
As a small gang roamer, please don't.  Killboards are a useful tool for determining where to go, and most of the time if I want to access a killboard it's relatively soon after a kill occurred.  Also, if you plan on doing this, why the different treatment for high sec?
---
uwu why uwu are uwu you uwu like uwu this uwu vas uwu
---
Fuck off
---
Woah. I never actually noticed that till you said it. Amazing.
---
Way to go squizz I think this is a great idea,  ignore the whiners, they are just upset because they cant masturbate over their killboards. Keep it blacked out for the duration of thr blackout.
---
highsec mining and mission running is still wide open to them, its not that hard to retool the character to fly a hauler or T1 bs with miner II's. They may leave null but they won't be leaving the game.
---
It sounds great, especially at current events occurring in EVE.
---
No I have never mined Spoud of any variety.
---
Nice work!
---
Yes because local is the only difference. Do you try really hard to be that much of a retard or does it come naturally?
---
oops, i think i've hit a nerve there :D
---
Not sure how to page mods for the propaganda flair, but otherwise this is my first shot at EvE propaganda. Hope y'all like it, so far I'm hearing good stuff. thanks folks.
---
I love that being a newbro, I have no idea how to really use local to my advantage anyway, so I don't feel any type of way about any of this. 
---
But I do enjoy that most people seem pretty happy about it.
---
this whole thing was always a bit stupid tbh
---
Cute. Welcome to thy he real eve.
---
And when I moved to jspace I briefly thought I couldn’t do anything because everyone else was running around in blingy Rattles, t3c and recon ships.
---
Then I figured out how to scan in a Astero and did relic sites, then I started huffing gas in a Venture.
---
Then I got another Astero and fit it for PvP, and started getting kills on other explorers and frig roamers.
---
Set up my PI, got something to do when “I have nothing to do”, that’s good isk for a bit of work.
---
Then I could afford a blingy Gila, started giving it to the drifters, got a better Gila, killed more Drifters, salvaged in a Destroyer.
---
Now I can afford Strats, got one for Ghost sites, one for PvP.
---
I scan and watch the chan for my corp when there are no sites I can or want to do solo, my corp tips for scanning and bookmarking.
---
I did most of this solo, or with 3 or 4 others, over a few months, next month I can use a Rattle I get set up, this is a constant move forward.
---
wtf was that dictor doing, shameful
---
I'm not sure no local equals resubbing lol.  Theres still plenty wrong with Game yet
---
Put some form of code or symbol in all your ship names.
---
So I have been really excited about kestrels after watching a (really amazing PVPer) on Twitch.  Is that something I could continue to do without worrying too much about losing ships?
---
It gets killboard data from zkill, it still works for everything dotlan was needed for in terms of hunting.
---
I’m not thinking no local kill bot, I’m saying that the people aren’t logging their bots on in certain systems that I’ve scouts in. I’d be surprised if the software used hasn’t already been updated to reflect the changes.
---
I vote NO delays.  The only thing which unites the entire "universe" is the timely transmission of information.  If information is throttled the game will become more isolated and less interactive.
---
My style of solo gameplay relies on fast, accurate kill mails so I would need to reconsider my involvement in the game if delays became the norm.
---
Wasn’t there a change? I thought there was..
---
Thats just the bots bro. You'll see that kills (activity) will be up
---
Dude, I'm IN the woofer!
---
Grats to BRAVE
---
Nobody probes down a solo camper. He‘s prealigned to another safe anyway.
---
Por que no los dos?
---
The ship was ugly anyway, so say thank you and move along...
---
Was there, can confirm. Sucks I don’t have the zKill proof, sorry.
---
Well, I would argue that nullsec is endgame...so if an astero is too high end...what are you doing in nullsec?
---
&gt; good old fashion scifi mystery
---
tfw you go like two jumps and suddenly have no fucking idea where the rest of your fleet actually is
---
Hunt in the areas around Delve, not delve itself.
---
Dope. Ty mate, though keep the account. I think that's against EULA.
---
He doesn't even know you can double click a ship to board it...
---
I mean... if you have the itch, Dreddit is recruiting.
---
So CCP should focus on Delve or the game?
---
My experience has been more fights.  Not more even fights, but more fights in general.  We've run into other gangs that were looking for content, and for the most part totally stomped them.  The local blackout mostly prevents gangs from selecting their fights in the same way.  I personally think that's great.
---
I remember that movie.
---
never not drop with supers... yes Lorenzo, you have reds to kill now
---
thats_the_joke.jpg
---
all my stuff is in my wormhole.
---
Then the bukkake party starts...
---
And if you're worried about rolling yourself out, just do it all in the same tick!
---
*Milkh for the Khorne flakes.*
---
The difference is that now gangs can't select their fights as efficiently.  It's far easier to hide backup and bait fights, but the opposing fleet can do the same.  Previously you had full intel about numbers in most cases and knew if you should be staying or leaving.
---
Except, to be fair, it would be intentionally handicapping yourself.
---
It's been the slogan for years.
---
Definitely solid pun.
---
Sometimes we get bored and wanna ruin someone's day
---
Had me gasping for air.  My chest... wheeze
---
True, but there is a reason people quit going on roams to begin with.
---
This made me laugh
---
The local itself has given some balance.
---
Are you content?
---
Lmao that is the same ship that was jumped by the Buzzard/Revelations right?
---
https://i.imgur.com/TagnRvI.gifv
---
Wee woo wee woo!
---
Must disagree, the local being gone really changes the viability of roaming and small pvp
---
Ya but people insist its fine because wspace doesn't have local.
---
What happens in December?
---
What a wonderful world we love in when killboard no longer matter...temporarily of course
---
My chest hurts, I'd rejoin a null corp just to read Intel chats and listen to fleet comms
---
Couldn’t agree more! The residents of Null-sec actually surprised me last night.
---
can we try that again, but with a different word order so it makes sense?
---
I warned you! But did you listen to me? Oh, no, you knew it all, didn't you? Oh, it's just a harmless little krab, isn't it?
---
Amen
---
Really? I'm just over level 200 and never once gotten one.
---
Nice really love it. Thx zkill and dotlan for doing this. Now CCP pls make at least 1-2 hours delay in showing rat kills and active players and ships killed in your map and we are set...
---
what about them?
---
You're the one coming here to comment you fucking loser. Go play your alternatives if they're so good
---
dude you are one negative fucking nancy.  Your comments are a sight to gouge your eyes upon.  Will you do us all a favor and go away now that you've unsubbed
---
Как сложно объясниться, то оказывается
---
I'd also like to see the drifters reworked, No one should be pointed at 100k  in 2 sec. But I still think having Bots hunt Bots is the best use of the drifters.
---
Ships of these factoins do not have pilots on board
---
You can. Wormholes are still spooky after years, no local can never be chill. But by all means if you decide to feel safe and undock some ratting ships without a care in the world, go for it. More targets are always a good thing.
---
7o god damnit. You are making it so hard to win eve right now
---
of course local was empty, it doesn't include everyone who talked retroactively it only counts people in system when they talk while your client is in that system. you can't hop into a wormhole and see what people 2 hours ago were talking about and if they are still in local, same thing applies here
---
Provi and catch mostly. Was a lot of fun, saw lots of people out in engage-able ships and fleets, dunked on a few of them until a goon munin fleet showed up and one of our guys fuckin pooped a bubble on our own fleet lol - not isk positive but way better NS roam than I think I've ever had.
---
Could be hilarious
---
This is like saying "see, all you had to do was press the gas" after getting the transmission replaced.
---
does a cloaked t3c shows up on dscan?
---
Basically you are in a place where you are relying on others more than learning to die and getting better. This isn’t the blackouts fault it’s your own confidence in being able to handle yourself if someone else comes at you. I’m not talking about just fighting them off, but there are so many ways to play it safe and escape while PVEing on your own. 
---
You have to be creative. If you enjoy mining learn to anchor stop bubbles from the major celestials that way you get extra time to warp out or rigs your self with the Higgs rigs that way you can stay aligned and still mine a full bay of ore before you are out of range of the rocks. Hell you can even use a micro jump deployable. As far as ratting just bounce align points when you are trying to stay in range of rats. Use moons as warp out points instead of the sun or planets makes it a lot harder for them to land on you and try to randomize your range if you are being chased. 
---
If your space is being over farmed though by roamers then dive into a low class wormhole and make some isk. If your sp is too low to do any of that effectively then you just do exploration you might die but at least it’s cheap and learn how to play gate games so that you can escape when there are the camps on the other side when traveling and use perches or Celestials near the gate to check them. 
---
Overall though if your not in the main tz of the group it doesn’t matter if there is a blackout or not you will always have trouble until you learn those things or find a group that’s a better tz.
---
&gt;that is probably the right amount of time to prevent live intel but still allow BR generation at the end of a fleet.
---
even something like 4 hours would be good
---
The solution could be so easy. Simply delay local chat 10 minutes (example) when i jump into the system. I bet someone came already up with the idea. Enough time for dscan and probe if you are hunting. Carebears and bots still permanently in danger and large troup movements must be really fast, before spotted.
---
So, hunter risk aversion?
---
that's because they're NPCs.
---
or... ccp could just ban the bots.
---
Exactly.  And thanks for the spelling... looking things up is :effort:
---
Hmm, I was being dropped on in Catch in stabber gangs before this, but yeah, Provi has always been good to roam in smalls stuff. And as long as you avoid the main pockets of Catch where Brave lives, it isn't bad either.
---
Sounds like you just roamed in areas where people don't normally drop on small gangs, rather than the local change making people not drop on you
---
i486-SX-25
---
shut up retard
---
Congrats! :D
---
Nope, there's only specific holes that can roll *out* of a hole. There are many that can roll in.
---
But if you want to rorq mine, it should be a risk. No one is forcing you to go to the absolute safest systems, you're just too chicken shit to do it anyway. The risk is still pretty low if you're not stupid
---
This is what eve is supposed to be.
---
If you give a man standing in front of a firing squad a blindfold do the guns magically disappear or the bullets stop in mid-air? The only thing that changed is they were no longer able to see what scared them into staying docked and not roaming.
---
cynos been lit all over k. expanse and im sure delve.
---
So, that was a long winded way of saying that Yes, there was a change. Just cause you had said there wasn’t.
---
its to hard to tell if its a bot these days. I've seen a bot that trolls people in local chat to make it look like a player talking smack, and they have to pay the people to investigate. Using drifters is cheaper and more reliable. no breaks runs 24/7
---
Especially these days
---
Hahahahaha it’s been that way wayyyyyy before the blackout dude. The blackout gives smaller groups a chance to fight back with gorilla warfare... small groups in NS are of course not in the best position, but it’s definitely not because of the blackout. N +1 will always be one of the biggest problems and smaller groups will always get bullied, but it’s still way better for smaller groups now than before.
---
that's at least 10 cringe points bro
---
Honestly, I'd love to see this. The problem is that if it comes from your end then any major group who cares just creates their own tool, which may or may not be made public. Best case scenario we get maybe a week of delayed KMs until we are back where we are now, and in the worst case now you need a coding guy to get your corps needs back to what it is now, and everyone who doesn't know a guy of have a spy is out of luck. It dose make me wonder what a EVE without an endpoint for kills looks like though. A world where you need to manually post kills to share them.
---
Thanks, now i understand
---
nice :)
---
Yeah, that sounds like Gallente Rebel to me. Still as thick as a brick.
---
Prices of everything gathered in null will explode because it will get rare.
---
But i like more small gang pvp - would be really nice
---
It's the opposite of doxxing
---
Using his RL name is doxxing
---
Nice! Even better, they'll likely think you're party of a hunting fleet if they do manage to combat you!
---
wts jibrish corpse
---
I have never seen so many of my miner corpmates in pvp ships and doing fleets. We spent sic hours together just roaming delve and realizing that a lot of corps do the same. It's awesome!
---
Also, I'm not missing zkill.
---
I love what the zkill blackout has done to us. EVE, now with 75% more JPEG.
---
From space turd to space beans. It is an improvement, even if only small
---
Honestly this post is one of the biggest arguments as to why FW needs some attention.
---
Nullsec should be a high risk high reward zone and it seems like CCP wants to finally wants to move in that direction. The problem is all the new players (who leave high sec) are in Null sec because it was so safe for such a long time. 
---
FW should be fixed up so new players can be directed there and CCP can make the necessary changes to make null sec an engaging experience for the veterans without harming the new players.
---
Pretty much.  It'll be fun for a few days, but long term it can only hurt player numbers in a game that already is having population issues, because it doesn't actually fix ANY of the actual problems with the game.
---
Found the goon.
---
I got 12 kills so far in my pilgrim, ive already paid for the 2 billion fit in dropped loot. Its glorious. I am loving this.
---
OP just edit your post to say
---
&gt;reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I love that nobody can tell if the second titan is still in the system or not
---
How?
---
Spreadsheet simulator 2k19
---
PRAISE BOB
---
No killmarks? Wow
---
Make sure you're doing the microwarp trick both ways on BOTH carriers. These holes have a lot of mass. You'll thank me later.
---
Is it risk adversion if you know you will lose with nothing to gain?  Would you take 15 t1/navy frigates against 15 Battlecruisers and hics?  That's the type of fight that is going to happen more.
---
Fit?
---
If I dscan once a second, and copy my dscsan once a second, how is that different than yours?
---
The isk must flow... But not necessarily in null if it's too risky. People will flock to large alliances or move elsewhere.
---
... because you don't get it
---
It also allows bigger groups to fight back against the guerilla warfare.
---
You see three guys on a gate, you decide to engage with your 5 man roaming gang.
---
A sabre decloaks, three recons decloak, seven stealthbombers decloak. And you are dead.
---
A 14 person gang is very easy to get together in a massive alliance but impossible in a smaller group.
---
For a small group, mining has become very dangerous. For a bigger group? Just fit a cyno, be in standing fleet. 
---
The blackout heavily favours bigger groups and experienced players. Which was already the state of null before the change.
---
&gt; Ill happily talk to CCP about it. Key binding a single stroke key is not against the EULA it does not alter gameplay it does not give me an advantage it does not combine multiple actions that would be inhuman to do.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It activates DScan 1 time per server tick the same as all other avenues of activation.
---
&gt; It just saves me from wearing out my hotkey by pressing it as you said 3000 times.
---
&gt; But by all means if you seek more clarity on the subject get CCP in here.
---
Quoting ToS violation admission for posterity.
---
I went mining in a Venture in Null, noob
---
&gt; For the first time in a long time pilots are logging on just to fight, people are going on strange things called “roams”.
---
Proof? zkill is blacked out right now are you talking out of your ass?
---
Aaaaaw does someone need a tissue?
---
Ouch.. I guess that's out too huh.
---
Dude, come on. Like the blackout is somehow helping the smaller groups. Guerilla warfare. Please man. Try nanogangs against a blob of titans. Local gives smaller groups way more security to actually build themselves up than having no real intel and now without local which allows every asshole in the game to take what little they have.
---
The problem has been around for a long time, which is exactly why we dont need more "interesting gameplay" that just keeps adding to the issue. And dont take my word for it, just read what members of the smaller groups are writing this very instant.
---
Nullseccers tended to disappear as soon as a group of unfriendlies was spotted 10 jumps away. Now they won’t know unless they guard all gates and wormholes.
---
This is irrelevant to zkill, you have a killmail to look at, but zkill has more accurate prices. If CCP should delay killmail creation is a totally separate discussion.
---
&gt;super high IQ play.
---
Top job on encouraging risk-taking there, chief.
---
Exactly this. I dont get how people are missing this very simple fact. Its like they are blind simply because they choose to be blind.
---
Yo, I was in a fleet that just saw the fight end. Good fight. I hope I can be apart of one of these killmails haha
---
It's almost as if without local it's much riskier to drop caps, and harder to do it lazely. And people are actually brawling with subs again because it was never about them being 'nano cowards' but always about the inevitable capital spam. Really makes you think
---
I know what you are pointing out, and I was pointing out how 'null sec income' is not bad.  High sec income hiding behind game mechanics can be game breaking.  Shit, you probably don't even remember 'mining with guns'.  
---
Tell me, are you hunting in null sec now?  Were you hunting in null sec in 2007?
---
Cheep fit just t2 everything no bling
---
I don't understand, seems like a pretty reasonable reason to leave to me.
---
I mined all night with my miner 2s and walked away with a decent enough amount. Yes lower than normal but it’s better than no money. Oh I also got to snag kills in the process
---
I'm for this change - Like many, when I see a hostile hanging about close to us, I check to see what he has killed in the past hour, what his fit is and if he has any friends.   
---
As much as this helps me with Home Defense, it also hinders me when roaming.
---
The delay will be very welcome :)
---
The 'hunters' cannot see the systems with the boogeymen in them now, so they have to 'play more' instead of 'warping to the vni who did not warp away'.  As a result of 'playing more' they 'feel more engaged' even when nothing really has changed like you say.  
---
Since they are more engaged, they are making more emotional decisions, like fighting something they might not before.  They do this because they no longer see the -10 red in local saying 'this guy fights back'.
---
The people you are arguing with are too fucking stupid to see this, alas most of them don't even play eve.
---
Carebear stare
---
"not krab fit therefore blackout a FAILIURE!"
---
  lol... OK
---
You clearly underestimate how many people we can throw at a problem till it’s fixed
---
Isk/hr? And if you can cloak up anytime why not blingfit?
---
4? You can do it in a single pass with one carrier.
---
It's be a good day for hunting for me. 3.5b killed, 1.5b looted.
---
For sure some have been lost but most of the miners out here have been using miner 2s and just leaving the excavators at home. Still safer than barge mining
---
I don't use it for PvP.
---
So what you are proposing is that we make it harder for people to play a game which already is fairly hard to get into. And that will somehow improve the game? Just because people are nostalgic?
---
And Im sorry but the reality of what we are seeing today, the state of current affairs, is on par with what Im saying. Smaller groups dying out or joining bigger groups like yours. Its a fact you cant deny. 
---
Are there alternatives, sure are. Are those open to every one or even relevant for most players? For the ones that work 12h shifts and come home to just sit and chill and talk a little shit with their corp. Or those who just wanna play a low effort game. Not really, but the thing is, they dont really affect enough to warrant such drastic measures as removing local. That only ensures that they wont log on.
---
I got kills in outer passage, and Curse. But drone lands were by and large completely dead. Give it a few days and the bitters will start to feel safe. Seems that some places already have cloaked intel alts on gates also. So if you see sign of ratters try cloaking up in a safe or safe logging for a bit.
---
Well said
---
People really use discord white theme?
---
Slack
---
Me too 7o
---
Indeed, however that wasn't the argument being presented. Simply stated was that he was told to fuck himself and treated poorly when in the evidence presented he was not told to fornicate with himself or mistreated.  Thus the comment debacle.
---
....have you ever tried to do a null roam before?
---
Now thats the real crime...
---
This isn’t about the blackout or some supposed  private kill data sale. It’s about squizz removing API marker recently and some bee plebeian and querns being salty about it so making up some conspiracy to try and make him look bad. Funny shit.
---
It's only the 1st night of course, but my experience is the same as yours. All of my guys are off, the neighbors who would be on right now aren't on and though I've downsized (and down-valued) the ships I use to pve, it's not really worth it when I could be in other places making better isk.
---
I think my adaptation to all this will be unsub all but my null pvp main (I triple box in null traditionally) and resub the Burner Mission alt I let lapse long ago. Same character to do abyssals , incursions and  invasions in high sec.  I don't know, but I imagine some will do what I'm doing, others may quit all together, and yet others will just bend the knee to some "Big Bloc" group with 24 hour protection.
---
None of those solutions seem like what the pro-delete local crowd seem to want.  I don't know why they'd expect different though.
---
because krabs would get the near2 alerts and dock up?
---
Or they will take the last nudge they needed to win eve. 
---
Or all they need to do is unsubscribe for a month and wait it out and CCP will get the message. It is fun that all the hunters (imagine which percentage of eve they represent) are dancing around of how cool it is, but the krabs (imagine what percentage they represent) are not happy. CCP took something and gave nothing in return, so as I've learned from my 20 months son that will have repercussions. 
---
The only good thing I see coming from this change, ignoring the PR, is that hopefully bots will die or stop producing as well. I think for the hunters the environment will be less and less rich as we go and once the hype goes the people that resubscribed will go back to winning eve and the people that stopped login in (cause you know they can't adapt and they are shit and they can't htfu and all the bs I have been hearing since this was announced) not all will come back. 
---
I hope I'm wrong.
---
Honestly much more respect for Frat titan pilot, ballsy AF.
---
Stupidity and courage by the way&gt;!, not in insulting way!&lt;.
---
To be honest the biggest thing i've noticed since going from a 1-1.5b gila total ship+implants, to what i use now which is the passive set up abyssal just about everything, a-type adaptives and geno's with relevant +5% implants in slots 6-10 is that i don't have to focus or care quite as much, and worry that if i disconnect i'm probably fucked (TBF think ive only ever disconnected once and i made it back fine)... It just gives me the extra security of knowing i have more room to screw up or do other things at the same time and be ok.
---
I can only manage a few hours of max actions per minute max isk making abyssal running then i either stop and go pvp, or keep doing it and watch netflix or youtube or somthing, with the bling fit i can get away with paying like 70% attention to what im doing instead of 100%.

Nice pics.
---
"Not even looking for a fight" usually means they ran from their obvious counter. Hunters are there to hunt, not honorable pvp, they are not interested in a fight on someone else's terms.
---
I'm pretty sure relic sites are being perma-camped by cloaky sabres.
---
Or how to fit a whore gun, how to lock a target, how to manually fly a ship... the list goes on
---
But docking them up means that the player most likely wont play. I absolutely get this hardcore attitude but its not working. Honestly. That exact mentality is why Eve, even though its an amazing game, has so few players. 
---
So if u ask me, let the game be a bit more chill so more players play it or let it be more hardcore so less play it...
---
It's probably seen more PvE content than any other Marshal. The screenshot with all the debris is from a successful World Ark fleet. I think it's already seen between 150 and 200 conduits.
---
I'm certain that even with thorough testing they will break more things anyway...
---
Thank you.
---
They are "blind" because they really really want this to work and be ok. It's going to take a whole not of negative evidence (like lower log in numbers, screwed up markets, long periods of finding nothing to fight etc etc ) to put a dent in their belief. Even then there will be die hards that cling to it.
---
I'm just going to adapt as best I can (high sec isk making alts I haven't used for years are about to get a resub lol) and hope it gets worked out soon, before null gets as low population as wormholes have historically been.
---
people love jumping on the bandwagon of a new and "exciting" trend, watch as it gets stale in less than a week and then CCP reverses it perhaps another week later...
---
Oof, I’m sorry for the mistake.
---
Poi
---
Showing again that the Rag is superior
---
They were better able to make use because of intel bot networks and Near2.
---
Well come to think of it, now hunters have to actually work rather than just blindly going to a system with a high enough NPC killed in the last hour number...
---
inb4 people get "bored" of the blackout because 90% of them can't hunt for shit...
---
What if I told you there are other ways to share killmails *ingame*?
---
You can control what goes in and out of your system, and you don't have cynos.
---
Nice! Go :)
---
isn't the rat kill counter delayed by exactly 1 hour already?
---
Trust in the Rust
---
Phase through that faze.
---
Very true.
---
Lol ye, all the time CCP has spent on practically forcing people to null has been reverted in a blink of an eye. 
---
And with abyssal running in HS which is safe and lucrative, null is starting to lose one of the few advantages it had.
---
Relic sites are almost certainly perma-camped by sabres
---
Too soon!
---
Just keep coming, precious mails

---
You’re so adorable
---
I have played Eve 6 years ago. Is it worth getting back in?
---
Honestly I agree.
---
I think CCP should put a 6h delay on killmails in NS/WS
---
I'm fairly familiar with roaming those areas, we made a point to go through the center of brave space and they had a handful of things that just kinda docked up. That same area about a month ago I had a cyno lit on a my small gang of 8 T1 cruisers. It's 100% the local change.
---
Ingame map has that and other more current statistics like active pilots in space/docked, active cynos etc. If not for how it looks and some missing features (jump planner and jump ranges from any system) it'd be superior to dotlan.
---
i think this didn't need it's own thread.
---
But they are new players, they can hunt us!
---
Once you go black, you...
---
Yea the numbers are actually kind of concerning, when you consider this should be max d1 hype on a friday.  Sunday's weekly max pcu will be very telling.

I was playing in 2007 yes, I was in a nano Vaga/Zealot going 4km/s orbiting Ravens who used Torps/Cruise missiles and couldn't hit me. Ganking plenty of ratting Ishtars out in Vale when it was owned by Pure. And yes I am hunting nullsec now, I live in a c2-n-c5.
---
Lol. Nice.
---
Hope squizz blacks out jsut null so we can still use it for leet lowsec pvp bragging
---
What do you mean? Local in null is deactivated now, you only show up in local if you write something in local.
---
The other killboard site isn't doing this are you worried about losing ad traffic?
---
Technically, that should be Naglfar's job
---
Are we getting a video from you about this? Been thirsty for content
---
What would you gain from bling?
---
Lol we know we're bad and embrace it, im not sure which wh groups ur talking to
---
I beg to differ. It’s a blast in delve. Sure I’ve been Titan dropped twice since downtime but I’ve killed a bunch of stuff and have had gf’s all around. 
---
Thanks goons for the content. I’ll be back after DT
---
Which is why us pvers stay docked up in cases like this blackout. I'm not going to give you content. You want to go fight something, fight something that can shoot back.
---
That is exactly how eve should be played well done all involved.

You can't expect to have 100% safety all the time.
---
Your fun is wrong
---
Wait you're supposed to be getting out? 
---
Fuck I knew there was something I was missing
---
And CCP's bean counters would rather have players PLEX their accounts.  One month is $15 if you sub, or $130 if you buy a year.  500 PLEX is $20, and $130 worth of PLEX gets you about 7 months of game time.
---
Start making free frigates and destroyers for the newbies, just stack them pack them and rack them, and hand them out in lumps of 50, absolutely no one gives a fuck about zkill so losing something means nothing as long as you only lose what you can afford to replace. That's basically what people did in the bad old days, they flew cheap chod during their alliance off-hours.
---
R u ok in head
---
give it a day or two for them to update the bots to use dscan not local and they'll probably be back.
---
or we'll just end up with a bunch of botting elsewhere in the game.
---
moving the bots doesn't solve the problem of eve having bots.
---
It’s pretty easy to set up a Corp/alliance killboard you can have your own br’s where you can filter out the randomness of how zkill throws random kills together to make br’s confusing
---
*wingspan decloak music starts playing*
---
Come on now, not everyone has the entire arsenal of microsoft servers at their disposal...
---
Here is a problem though. Let's say you do this because CCP won't. You turn a very public tool to be less effective and before you know, someone will post your type of toop for a private audience, changing the whole dynamic.
---
Personally I find Zkill as intel tool acceptable because it takes time and effort to kinda get a good idea quickly. It also provides that info equally to all, rather than hidden internal tools that only really apply to the largest organisations.
---
Same with Period Basis.
---
Just went through to check every couple of hours. Not even a single wreck. The entire region is empty, all of their structures show [0], nothing hiding inside POSes.
---
not sure on isk/hr not giving it my all and went cheap because just like no one can see me, I cant see them. only fly what your willing to loose.
---
Hiw can they upload if they dont undock
---
made me giggle so i gave you + karma
---
&gt;What are you doing?
---
dropping on anything stupid enough to get lost in delve.
---
It would only last until people host internal killboards that do provide instant intel. But at that point, you ruined the purpose because rather than everyone having the information, now it is only a handful of groups with a suitable IT department to run it.
---
In WHs, there's always a cloaky proteus right behind you. In Null, it's probably actually a titan
---
Doomsday only ratting titans are the new meta, keep up scrub
---
Well, this makes up for Brave's 23b T2-fit Wyvern loss recently...
---
Wait. I was told everyone in null would stay docked until blackout was oved
---
'if you dont play like I do, your not real'
---
I got bosoned on that o-i gate yesterday before the blackout, thats not an effect of the blackout, just goons providing good content
---
In my first days I ended up in a Goon renter alliance and did the migration into their systems and user db. I was so blown away by the scope of what they were doing there I started to wonder how much CCP works with the big big corps. A crazy, crazy space video game.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I think avg/daily totals (added after downtime) of some of those stats on esi endpoints would be fine, remove the instant though
---
Sure but let's flip it upside down.
---
Say your intel in fringe systems is suboptimal and you have your alliance signed up on your killboard. Each time someone dies, you get an alert, providing you with plenty of intel by the bodies they leave.
---
Meanwhile the opponent, who doesn't have access, can not reliably plan for content or use that same information. That leads to an "unbalanced state of information". 
---
Besides, I do not want delayed killboards because it absolutely can encourage content. Space is so immense that you can spend a whole day with zero targets. Why restrict that more.
---
D-scan can’t differentiate between friend or foe but I do think they’re working on ways to get around the blackout. How can they operate without the Corp taxes pouring in!
---
When local comes back, if you're in the more dangerous parts of space, keep local dragged out.  Someone shows up that you don't know, get ready for a fight or run away.
---
Shhh little one
---
ahyes..; you now need multiple alts per system to increase your chance of actualy having a cyno to jump to :D  thats not really cashmoney ( or maybe it will...)
---
The second day combat recons became immune to dscan, I saw a merlin in a medium. I went in with my curse to kill it, but the merlin was already warping off because it got scared from the lachesis, that was plexing there in a pve fit. I killed the lach, went to drink a coffee to think about life.

I've never had a cup of Lipton tea but on further investigation through my goto tea review website, ratetea.com, I will be sticking with my preferred brand of tea.
---
&gt; I had this at my hotel years back, and I still remember spitting out the disgrace of a "tea".
---
&gt; When I do drink regular Lipton tea, it's usually from a catering tray 
---
&gt; The dry teabags have some tea aroma
---
&gt;  I wouldn't drink it for free.
---
&gt; How can a tea I've swallowed off and on for decades be so forgettable?
---
&gt; I don't care for it
---
&gt; the halfway decent first cup changed dramatically into a non-existent second cup
---
&gt; You could get exactly the same effect by throwing the grass clippings from your lawnmower into a bucket of water.
---
&gt; like I licked my own underarm
---
&gt; It's my tea of last resort
---
if everyone's ratting in VNIs then just exempt VNIs and if friendly non-vni ships come in - the lost isk/hour of friendly ships passing through is better than not botting at all.
---
Squuzz for csm 2020
---
So Blackout is good, because it makes the game more encouraging, but delaying Killmails is bad because it does not insta gratificates you ? Are you also vegan ?
---
"I ran into way more players interested in actually fighting me than I have done since 2016 probably, plenty of gangs/soloers and defence fleets around, none of these would have existed prior to black-out."
---
That probably is a perception artifact. you run into 'more' players  interested in fighting, because they were the only ones out. So, the %  was increased but the total numbers were probably the same. In other words your insistence before to get fights out of those that dont want/cant fight you, made you think that there were only few willing to fight.
---
When did this occur? That is really interesting.
---
Damn. It seems capital ships have really populated around the even space.
---
&gt;pretending the blackout fixes botting in eve is naive at best.
---
t. poster that can't see literally almots all bots disappearing over night

dscan doesn't fix the issue, you can still be caught consistently by a cloaky ship watching you as a bot. bots are fucked.

---
Lol, wormholes are spooky for you? Srsly.
---
Where is *your* video
---
I disagree. 
---
It makes it harder for the powers that be to see things forming. That added uncertainty makes them less likely to drop on shit. Small-gang/solo hunters can go out and get their hunt on without being pissed-on by the blocs.
---
Im not sure about the changes. I think I dont like them (the zkill blackout mainly - the delay i dont care much about). I mostly do solo Frig PVP in FW Lowsec and there are counter to this gameplay (like cloaky lokis) im not able to do anything against. I warp to a novice and then im dead. Before the changes I was able to check zkill and just avoid this systems or change my style (warping at range first and so on). I also see the good site of the changes for other playstyles, but they have more disadvantages than advantages for me personally, so i don't like them.
---
&gt; if everyone's ratting in VNIs then just exempt VNIs
---
then we hunt in VNIs
---
&lt;INSERT "Not sure if offended or very flattered" MEME&gt;

Wait what's happening? Everyone's talking about blackouts

i'd love the irony of that.

&gt; t. poster that can't see literally almots all bots disappearing over night
---
pretending this is the new status quo is literally the naivety i was talking about.
---
since your goons I'd like to ask if I may. How are you all handeling the drifters? I see hord killing them with thrashers and loosing like 15 to 20 ships per drifter. but I didnt get to see how goons was doing before zkill went dark.
---
Oh holy shit, thats my old JF pilot i sold, weird how this game works these days.
---
Hisec cosmos botting wew
---
During this blackout there have been no drifters. Probably CCP  does not want to taint their results with the local test (i would hope). But before that we would just open cyno and drop supers on them.
---
Ohhh yasaaas &lt;3
---
Sweet
---
Oh man, I wish I still played.
---
Excellent :) glad to hear it.
---
Yep, we have come back to the game and spirits have been high. Some good kills ( all pvpers looking for action ).
---
Game is spooky again. As it is suppose to be.
---
Still is, done through the NES
---
STC Naverin? - Mitch
---
We rolled through in kikis. A good man in a jackdaw lit a cyno and a titan came through. Bosoned his own jackdaw, and his tackle inties who came through the gate. We all made it out.

This is a fair statement

Just this.
---
I killed more Hulks today than I've ever killed in a single day. In fact... I think today I got more kills than I've ever gotten in a single day period. I don't really know exactly why... but you are onto something here I think.
---
People who think they are space important
---
[deleted]
---
You guys r clueless
---
It's so awesome. Even if the actual gameplay impact was low (which it's not) the atmosphere that is added is great. It's why I moved into WH's and I'm glad to see it's making its way to NS.
---
thats a lot of words for a bait post my dude. But people fell for it so good work i guess
---
This was Impass tonight, but the VNI was a Brave Rorq and the Tengus were literally two Frat Titans (although one is still MIA).
---
I've seen more pilots in space in the past 24 hours, then I have in weeks.
---
&gt; I absolutely get this hardcore attitude but its not working.
---
its been 24 hours.
---
i never said nor implied that
---
From what I understand it's also recommended to use all deadspace mods for them.
---
&gt; For the ones that work 12h shifts and come home to just sit and chill and talk a little shit with their corp. Or those who just wanna play a low effort game.
---
cant get ganked for just shooting the shit on teamspeak.
---
If you're that much of a pussy, go to highsec, or sit in a c1 with the holes rolled off.
---
That’s even worse .. pve marshal
---
There shouldn't be a fireproof way to see someone come in anyways. Don't undock what you can't afford to loose, watch d-scan and pray to bob. That's how it should be imo.
---
Also if you can't fly an astero you shouldn't be in nullsec fulltime. I understand if you wannanbe there with your friends, that's what I wanted to when I started, but until you're ready to do solo things keep solo things in highsec. Jumpclone skills are skilled quick and a travel interceptor is the first thing you should skill in nullsec anyways so moving shouldn't ne the problem.
---
grath
---
Of course numvers will come down. Bots are crying oil logged off atm.
---
No one will miss them. Good bye bots. Gdis be correct.
---
&gt;What do you think?
---
fuck no don't make your service worse because ccp is incapable of balancing the game
---
the 'big boys' will just have their own private killboards and you're fucking the small boys over ya dumb retard
---
This is how eve should be. You can't defend yourself? Then you shouldn't be safe. 
---
If isn't safe to do something you did before, start doing something else.
---
If no one is there to defend you, isn't CCP fault, or blackout fault. You wanted to play when no one else is there. So you accept the risk, or GTFO. Eve it's full of ways you can earn money solo. But you didn't bother, since afk anoms/mining was easier. So, or you adapt or you die. 
---
This thread can be resumed in: "boohoo, i don't wanna learn to do new things, i want ez isk"
---
Eve has sound?
---
work? Like, pressing f10, using the NPCS KILLED METRIC and set dest to red dots?
---
Found the same roaming Circle Of Hell space in Outer Passage, all the usual BOT were logged out.
---
you had me until you incorrectly threw "irreparably" in to your statement.
---
bots spending a day or two setting up a new method of income generation is the very opposite of "irreparably".
---
if all bots have vanished and not returned by next weekend, feel free to tell me that 'you told me so'.
---
Then finding out those NPCs were killed there some 20 hours ago by a player from a different timezone and you have to burn back 20 jumps while mumbling under your breath how shit the CCP map function is.
---
Me too cant wait to see my kb when it comes back
---
Evidence presented? I'm sorry... What I see here are just a few comments, provided by one party, from one instant in time...
---
Who's to say that there aren't legitimate, other points in time in which this particular member *was,* in fact, treated quite poorly? Some kind of context for his general tone here?
---
HE DOESN'T KNOW :twitch_emote:
---
TVP fizzled out for various reasons a year ago partly due things such as Rorqual Mining, Alpha Vindis and internal drama
---
• USTZ was always difficult and became nonexistent
---
• Meta 4 alpha vindis up to 200 hours refused to upgrade and improve the isk for everyone incl. 4 bil vindis &amp; omega pilots, 100mil/hr wasn't worth it to anyone
---
• firing FCs that FC because its easier than compromising, keeping your F badge meant don't FC
---
• Leadership being largely absent and uninterested in incursions
---
• FCS and Pilots complaining to Leadership that an equal and fair system should only apply to everyone else
---
Yeah nah, anyways keep being a shitty retard instead of skilling yourself and trying to improve.
---
But again I highly suggest you read up on some tutorials and skill yourself so you can be less of a useless waste of oxygen (in game ofc).
---
you're spare parts bud

Vegan wormholes btw
---
You want to catch a hunter you have to trap him. These aren't FW cagefighters  or lowsec brawlers, they're not interested in giving you kills. I used to run QRFs all the time to run them off, when I played with larger entities (f that life btw). You need to outplay them to catch them.. the pvp is as much in the cat and mouse as in the fight itself.
---
wooooosh

You seem a nice person to be around.

I thought you were supposed to be at least 13 to play Eve? Can't remember the PEGI rating now...
---
Ok so a group of 5 stealth bombers comes in. They are maybe seen on D-scan if the bots spam it hard enough before they cloak. Or a few lachesis comes in. The bots go docking in safety, and then the bots will never really know if the intruders have left or not. 
---
How can someone make the bots know that someone is still there? Will they dock for x minutes and then go back out, hoping you are gone? Will they never undock? How risk-averse can you make a bot without it eating up all the profit from dying too much?
---
I am honestly interested in seeing if they can make an equally efficient bot without local that is gankproof, because if they can't then this is a really great improvement already.
---
I just scream every time to cover the d scan noise.
---
If you can’t fly an assault frig you shouldn’t be in null. They’re cheap and very capable of flying around solo safely, just choose your targets. If you jump into a camp don’t panic- just heat that mwd back to gate and bail. Sure you’ll die but null sec isn’t meant to be without risk. Once you’re competent in an assault frig take out your cruiser. Your assault frig piloting skills will pay dividends at this stage.
---
I recommend an arty wolf or retri. Both very fast and capable of taking on higher classed ships. Personally I prefer the retri. I’ll mail you a cheap fit if you’re interested?
---
Whatever you say mongo.
---
:D
---
First a titan blob is of course not gonna be taking on by anything else other than a shit load of subs or capitals. However you trying to relate local to a titan blob is fucking funny. If someone’s got a titan blob they aren’t scared to lose it doesn’t matter whether the smaller group has a local or not? They better have a bat phone or a way to push off titans. Also if you are talking a small enough group of like 10 people or so then yea no shit they shouldn’t own Sov they expect to be able to keep if they don’t have a deal with locals or some sort of block. Again local only gives intel and a power block won’t give a shit about local when they are knocking shit over?Hell the power bloc might even use their supers less if they don’t know what’s lurking in the shadows specially if intel gets out of a group using supers on a smaller group. Definitely great bait! Local just gives people a sense of safety when in fact majority of the time they probably are safe. People just don’t don’t have the confidence to handle them selves if someone pops in to attack them. Null sec is not suppose to be safe to where you can warp off the instant a neutral comes in. If you want that then you better cover the gates and or jam your system.  
---
Also we are a smaller group who owns sov independently without renting. We have had to use every trick in the book to keep what we have and it’s been absolutely awesome to play with the big boys and come up with ways to keep what we have. The day a block gets tired we are sure there will be titans in our door step however we can at least fight back and absolutely piss people off by killing renters and ratters. We have killed botting supers, rorqs, even a titan that’s jumped instead of bridging and just idiots ratting in supers without knowing how the mechanics work. Local being gone makes it easier. We get an opportunity to mess with their toys and income and they know even if we get pushed out into NPC null we will still be there and when we have nothing to lose it just becomes more dangerous and annoying for them.
---
One of the few advantages... Uh 
---
What disadvantages does it have? Retard abyssal runners are ganked with three nados
---
You’re on an EVE subreddit and gave no details about why you stopped playing or why you are thinking of playing again. Not sure what you’re expecting for responses.
---
This. People complaining that Null is now too hard for new players, don't realise that is the point. Null is meant to be the most dangerous space in the game. It's not meant to be a place to learn how to play the game.
---
how to turn on his invuln
---
No, you can gift 30d of gametime, costs 500 plex.
---
Yup.
---
It doesn't mean it needs to be totally impenetrable, but it doesn't need to be a "oh, I joined 1 month ago and moved to null with absolutely no issues."
---
Absolutely agree. As a casual player, with no pretensions of being elite, I have un-subbed my alts, and my main can do the occasional fleet and I’ll potter about sitting on gates, do some scanning and slowly disengage from the game.
---
This change will kill the game. All that will be left is a bunch of elitist nerds shouting at each other, and telling the world they are better then everyone else.

I'd consider that a good trade rorq for a titan.
---
We also ran into your gang, but that very quickly became a "lets get the fuck out of here situation"
---
Firstly nano gangs are not Guerilla warfare they are for YouTubers. Secondly if you get caught by a titan in your nanogang your doing something wrong. Thirdly isn’t null about the risk to loose everything? Which is the main reason politics exists in eve?
---
Duh N +1 will always be the issues however it doesn’t mean that the blackout will even come close to being main reason a small group will fail. And again if you can’t handle 14 people In your time zone then you are too small a group to be owning sov just based on how sov warfare works lol. Also 5 experienced pilots can definitely handle 15 if they have the right fleet comps readily available... 
---
You act as if 3 Nano gang pilots should be able to hold onto sov and that’s simply never going to be a reality because of N +1.... there are way worst things that hurt small groups.
---
LOL
---
&gt; This change will kill ~the game~ nullbear playstyles
---
Ftfy
---
Adapt or die
---
Why would anyone film themselves flying through region after region and finding nothing to shoot?
---
eat shit and die
---
this is fucking hilariously wonderful
---
Those stats are only hourly already.
---
Understood. Sucks bro. :(
---
You still shouldn't lose ISK krabbing with no local, and you should still make more ISK than moving to lowsec for example. By working together people can get reasonable intel on where threats are, and bring response fleets to save each other.
---
But you will lose a bit more than you did last week. And that's good, because the only thing that makes the game worth playing is when players interact with each other. In space PVP is a huge part of that.
---
I see no problem here seems like normal nullsec
---
He should just do however he feels. It's his website.
---
I mean, at the worst this man is saving a vacations worth of money not having to display what hes still processing. Take a break brother!
---
Sounds like you went to nullsec too soon, tbh. There's never been a lot you could do in nullsec solo with a T1 cruiser.
---
Those are the same problems a player faces. The point of having a bot was never that they were uncatchable with enough effort, it's that they don't get tired or bored.
---
If all the carebears leave nullsec, despite the large amounts of isk available there, then other groups who are more likely to actually give a good fight will move in.
---
Normal players that krab hardcore may also not play because of this.
---
So it wasn't necessarily all bots.
---
Well, a big part of bots is also that they can have perfect reaction times.
---
The closest alternative is X3: Terran conflict, and that game is singleplayer(even if criminally underrated). And no, Star Citizen is not a finished game.
---
i think i agree. krabs do their thing and dock up like always. but at least the roamers are back in town. i was only on for a short time yesturday but i saw gangs everywhere.  i hope the roamers keep it up. id hate to see the good activity die down after the initial hype for blackout fades.
---
&gt; you will not have anything you can do unless you enjoy dying pointlessly
---
FC what is dscan. And what is paying attention to the grid.
---
You can still explore, run combat signatures and missions with a high level of safety - people need to drop probes to warp to you there.
---
This is probably bad for groups who don't have enough players to have at least 2 or 3 online. But honestly, I don't know why groups like that think they should be able to freely print ISK in supposedly the most dangerous bit of K space.
---
&gt; players who weren't at the point of being able to fly higher end ships like Asteros
---
An Astero is not 'higher end'. Nullsec's never been a place where a new player should expect to be able to do much solo. I wonder if you were convinced to go to nullsec too soon by the nullblob recruiters.
---
There are still systems in the game where a local channel exists.
---
Adapt or die :)
---
It's not the game doing something wrong, it's you
---
Lmfao the hunters you're describing arnt any different than Krabs, they avoid PVP and risk at any cost, refuse to participate in content.
---
Unsub
---
i just wanted to suggest for you to go back to highsec where you belong, but you figured that out yourself. god bless.
---
There's so many of them (lol)
---
If you want the bot to know you're still there, you shit up Local.
---
Can you please blackout your r/eve posting. Thanks.
---
&gt; This change will kill the game.
---
at least it will die with dignity after years of slow and painful rot caused by the likes of you.
---
All of Null is operating in delayed local chat. 
---
So all intel systems that use local to keep track of neutrals is ded. 
---
Been pretty great so far, lots of content out there right now.
---
You can with a 5min delay. Locator agents are still a thing
---
Im pissed off and might be Quitting Eve now, this is an absolute outrage. Take my intel away? The one tool that allows me to see areas where npc kills are happening? During the blackout of all times?? Screw this crap. Just ruined the blackout. At least let us see where the krabs are krabbing
---
to put it short, 0.0 got no more standard local, it now works like in wh systems --&gt; no more free easy intel
---
You are incorrect about wormholes, yes they have set statics but those aren't the only outbound holes you can have and literally any type of wormhole can be opened into your wh, we live in a C5 and have had k162 from literally every region of space open into us. 
---
You say we have hole control but you constantly have gate control in nullsec, you can easily sit an alt on the gate and just listen for the activation noise. Even then WHers don't get hole control to run non capital sites and non rorqual mining because it's not worth the effort to roll when you aren't risking caps. Nullsec has been a HUGE isk FAQ faucet for years now with very little risk involved, yes using a cap to rat or a rorqual to mine is now risky but you still have super cap umbrellas, you're now just more likely to need to call them in to help. The average person not mining in a cap can get away fine with dscan and being aligned out
---
explains why you spoke about protecting mission runners...
---
Go out there yourself. Roam 5 regions, then post results.
---
Lol u most likely just didnt read and had to be edgy on reddit and go grr goons...but like I said, with local going black , zkill going black, it would be so interesting to go even further with the info black hole.
---
Imagining a null with true unknown or at least corridors with no info from outside of the game sounds nice.
---
This, if we can at least hunt them easily now that they don't instawarp when you enter local, that makes a big difference.
---
I mean did you really think botters would be retarded enough to undock during the first days of an extremly hyped change ?
---
same with esoteria, paragon soul, feth, omist and catch
---
see I can list other blocs renters aswell!!
---
Not that there’s anything *wrong* with that.
---
Ishtars are legit very good pvp ships man, same with gilas. I actually snagged a few kills already in TKE with a Gila.
---
hey glad Dotlan was thinking the same thing I was:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cchtuf/dotlan\_blackout/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cchtuf/dotlan_blackout/)
---
He is some karmafleet pingwarrior who doesnt undock u less its for an f1 mashing, so yeah his opinion on the state of the game is about the same value as an NPCs.
---
Shhhh this is great news. It's time to make a bloody killing in the market.... Rise prices, RISE!!!!!
---
right.  exactly what i was talking about.  using the data we get in game without using the incredible tools we all now rely on so heavily
---
It's going to die big time once the hype is gone, I give it the weekend to one week and we'll be on our way back to where we were. People will eventually be bored of it sadly
---
Because killing vnis is boring as shit?
---
More Curb your Enthusiasm than Seinfeld...
---
Was in a loose gate camp earlier- flying a proteus because "fuck it". Suddenly Goon mach appears- shoot the thing, bump him off. 
---
  Goon Sabre lands and bubbles everyone- No problem, kill the mach!
---
  As he goes down- Goon Jackdaw gang lands firing everywhere. Somehow manage to burn out and get safe with a nice kill.
---
  No doubt if local had suddenly spiked we would have bailed and not killed anything- and in turn goons would not have killed a few cruiers.
---
  Not knowing what's around has led me and others to take greater risk.
---
  CCP - Best change in a long, long time.
---
Support the Blackout......Undock in your Titans. 
---
Great to see that Zkill has jumped aboard in support of deliberately blocking "free" intel.  It certainly was very interesting "hunting" yesterday, we got "kill" which is what it's all about, enjoy the weekend, just don't lose your fleet!!
---
Good to see their ADM's turning to shit now
---
Pffft I was ratting in a VNI in eso a few hours ago- Nuthin!
---
You haven't been checking out Esoteria and Catch that closely then, it's pretty packed. 
---
PGS, Feyth, and Omist are definitely empty though.
---
I wonder why~
---
...and give us bigger red dots on the map so we can see it better!  I'm squinting on my 4k map and my  Antipharmakon  Iokira drip just ran out!
---
reddit and zkill are legit the only reasons i still play eve so
---
They're gonna have to creep out and get back into it if they wanna continue making ISK to pay for subs etc. 
---
  Then there's maintaining ADM's.
---
Exactly, well said. The aim is to reduce the amount of risk free isk available. If you want to make isk now you need to be prepared to defend it not just dock up when neutrals pop up on Intel channel 5 jumps out. If you can defend it even if that means dropping supers on a 2 man retri roam then that's fine with me at least there was an interaction. Roaming space that had 1000+ delta and not finding anything in space when you get to system was very frustrating and not good at all for the game I would much rather lose my ship everytime I went to null than vo. E home after 2 hours and still have the same amount of ammo
---
you're brave for posting this
---
but you're not wrong
---
If there are less players, then what are the botherders going to do? I mean, they sell the ISK for RL income, right? But if less and less people are playing, who are they going to sell the ISK to? Other bots?
---
hello test poster!
---
please look at fake eso where there are renters!
---
Fuckin respect dude o7
---
That is how the game is meant to be played.
---
please loom at fake eso where there are renters and catch where there are renters!
---
I would have not expected this would still be the case.
---
I think it’s a mistake (personal opinion) to position FW as a newbie-only pvp area. FW attracting less people has several reasons: security status hits, snowballing effect in warzones, FW corporations not able to tax LP’s, supers being too oppressive, need for a 4-way warzone, need for new factions (I’d love to participate in a pirate militia), need for Faction-controlled nullsec constellation (empire expansion), need to balance the LP stores. 
---
Nullsec bros going in lowsec because null becomes boring is bad game design. Don’t forget that BO is probably temporary.
---
Alright then. Well good luck on your master plan of forcing CCP to revert the nullsec local change...lol.
---
it bothers me that i know how smart you think you with that comment,
---
Maybe krabs had something too strong and it needed a nerf, first you introduce the blackout then ease up to similar to before except nerfed local
---
Boring is a subjective term retard.
---
you know what to do.
---
Dude, I miss your video. C'mon, I can rewatch "going south" only so many times!
---
NEXT!

---
Like everychange it's less of a issue the bigger you are.  Like goon tactics will change.  They'll still drop supers anytime something is tackled.  I'm excited for the changes but also understand that the super blocks will end up just being more powerful and everyone else less so.
---
Damnit there goes my plan.
---
It's a list of everyone in system, if you're in null or low and lots of people you don't know are in that list youre free to use  the Ralf Wiggum "I'm in danger" meme
---
What the Hell do you expect ? That you won't getting punished if you drop us ? Damn fool
---
But you said you are PushX director?       
---
Or was it Frog?
---
Solo pvp is a thing btw and vastly more entertaining than pve.
---
SciFi sounds sweet.
---
If I do resub think I'm gonna go cloaky hunter, my preferred playstyle from years of living on whs.
---
Im thinking dualboxing double stratios or double cloaky Loki. Might put my alt in a bomber to get round the cloak delay
---
Where does it say null is suppose to be the most dangerous? I always just thought of it as the space players could control and conquer
---
I suppose it does, but I haven't used the in-game map in 4-5 years since I first started playing.  I think it's beautiful, but functionally worthless. Also, it can't be put onto my second screen so I can have a map while I'm flying.
---
or just dump random t1 ships in space
---
Not me
---
You want to take on Delve.  Stop bottom feeding on Provi
---
Unless you have lots of experience in nullsec smallgang roaming you might not be able to tell the difference.
---
no u
---
god bless this goon, reply is chill af
---
i never once said they'd all disappear, i'm saying that now you can consistently get kills on bots and there is nothing they can do to stop you.
---
need ammo in stain...still looking for that low sec gate
---
^^^ pretty much this. Clubbing seals is sweet and all in moderation but shit it gets old.
---
why would i be salty towards you about that, you didn't do anything
---
I think daily totals are a bit much. Need to put a bigger fog of war than that. Make the data like the mer, monthly. So you only see the total ship kills, total mines etc on a rolling monthly avg.
---
I quit and u aint getting my stuff its already un-subbed and everything went into asset safety Supers titans and everything else. Fuck CCP no more money from me.
---
No soup for you!
---
No but i did think that bots wouldn't undock now that their program is broken by local chat removal. You know, since they depended on local chat for security. Now that's gone, even if their bot gets updated, it's still at risk of dying.
---
All the people defending bots, saying how they'll update 'in a day or 2', like it's nothing, are bots and bot sympathisers.
---
\+1 for delayed.
---
For some people, the title of this thread is taken as a challenge
---
You're cloaking your Lachesis?  I can't wait to see this shitfit on delayed Zkill
---
"Cluster activity" is also bigger than just "PCU."  I think they may be hoping that the change reduces the number of logins that interact with only NPC content but increases the number of kills per hour.  I'm sure bots are good for revenue, but players shooting each other will grow the audience.
---
&gt;It's almost as if without local it's much riskier to drop caps
---
I mean, Provi had capital engagements, and if we can do it, the others can too, it was just the 1st day, after a few days we'll all be back to shitting all over everything w/ capitals again, but, for a day or two, it's nice to get some brawls again.
---
Literally in the name: Null Sec -&gt; No Security Space. No space cops, no rules, no npc saftey net. 
---
VS
---
High Sec -&gt; High Security Space with space cops that will come shoot bad guys who break the rules.
---
yeah they showed up late to the game, no blink wealth floating around china they need to actually play the game for isk.
---
delete local btw
---
The one and only :D /wave I only miss the paragon soul days a little bit!
---
Perhaps making assumptions here.   No reason why CCP should keep them given Sansha Incursions have been around a while now
---
2:14?!
---
shoot structures
---
Yes, but some other elements I would like unchanged, a bit more granular. Even more options for the different types of sounds :)
---
The carriers can’t go in without purple mods.
---
Last Thursday was a US holiday that a lot of people extended to Friday, so maybe not a completely fair comparison.
---
if VNI then check ship name against LIST
---
if SHIPNAME &gt;1 GTFO
---
Listen to this guy. 
---
He knows what he is talking about.
---
Change only effected small entities, gg CCP, try again next Wednesday.
---
thats clearly the day
---
This should have been like that since the start, CCP didn't think about killmails for more than one second.
---
Where are the attack pilots in Guritas space? Retrievers, skiffs, ventures, mining ships, not on them. Do the Caldar without the pilots.
---
tell me what I said is wrong in my above post
---
Hunters copy ship names all the time.
---
:o wait, tiny as in r3d fire tiny?
---
I used to be with those guys when I last played 2 years ago!! Glad they're still around.
---
You put loom instead of look.
---
Brave still exists?
---
Nah, titan players come here often just to feed kills out of the kindness of their hearts. Brave has a lot of hungry mouths.
---
It's noble of them to sate our appetites.
---
I wasn't on much last night, sad I missed this ☹️
---
Still found some in Deklein
---
I don't fault you for not understanding, null sec doesn't attract smart people
---
"if ship name is greater than 1" means you're looking for a duplicate name.
---
That means you're looking for hunters copying names.
---
so your bot warps out if it sees an unknown name or a duplicate known name.
---
Can confirm, I was a krab but was not saved. 
---
Other ones were saved though. 
---
Was very hectic and first time I’ve seen a lone capital come and fight us (Nidhogger)
---
fair play
---
very cool
---
It used to be that corps wouldn't even take players into null unless they had at least 15mil sp.
---
And if you want to solo PvP, come to solo FW zones in a cheap frigate and warp to a novice plex. You'll probably get blown up, but hey, it's super cheap, just come back with another frigate until you blow up the other guy instead. You'll learn how to become a much better pilot than F1 monkeying around.
---
Like what? I logged in last night and ended up just playing dota while hoping my Corp logs on for a fleet on Friday night.
---
Zzzz
---
Retrievers ventures and skiff..oh my!
---
Well, technically nullsec is in fact supposed to be pure sandbox. No security basically means no non player enforced rules, such as concord. However, letting players create their own second hisec has been a terrible idea for the longevity of the game, so it needs to be made harder, if not impossible.
---
To be fair to him, until the blackout, nullsec was probably the safest place to learn and make decent isk as a newbro. I agree that it shouldn't be the case, but the recruiters weren't lying when they recruited him.
---
Mods apparently blacked out too
---
FC what are gate-camps?
---
Finally someone who gets that there was more than spinning in a hub to pve.
---
I unsubbed; ill live on my isk reserves till they run out
---
Highsec is the place for low-effort "I just want to chill" types. All other areas of space are supposed to be dangerous, with greater rewards. It's not because nullsec blobs have made it safe over the years that it's supposed to be that way. 
---
The game design intends nullsec to be the "endgame", where experienced players go, not where hordes of newbros are herded like cattles.
---
I wouldn't go that far. Back in the day, before Asteros were even a thing, I CEOed a nullsec PvP corporation specifically for new players. We'd have one day old players pod-jump out to Curse, give them a stack of Merlins and tell them to go out and try to kill stuff. It went just fine. 
---
Pre-blackout, you can't really call nullsec endgame. It was an environment where newbies could thrive, with a little help. Especially NPC null, where eviction isn't a concern. Maybe post-blackout that will no longer be the case. Which may be for the best, if it causes lowsec to have more value as a transitional zone for newbies who don't want to live in highsec but aren't ready for more than day trips to null or wormholes.
---
I'd love to see some well-run newbie friendly lowsec groups emerge from all this.
---
we are waiting for you to return to the flock
---
I wonder how Feythabolis and Omist look like
---
Your name is apt right now.
---
very funny, what software did you use?
---
Yeaaa no mining going on, go to Esoteria or Provi, nothing to see here....
---
Can you start flying normal ships. Like leave those frigates to newbies and alpha players !  Thanks
---
I always wondered about the accent of the second group, they sounded like russian too. But the "real" russians dont even speak english ever. 
---
And someone should remake that trailer with all the brackets that we need to have in space :P how it really looks... with excel table, brackets, chat full of spam, and all that.
---
He's just a simple farmer and it's almost harvesting season. The man's mind is clearly elsewhere right now.
---
We go after the krabs to try and bait fights.
---
fuck the krabs
---
Good.
---
Fuck Fraternity.
---
Eve has so few players because it's a niche game. If you want to play a chill game, go play WoW. It's been in Eve's marketing since the beginning and so many players left over the past few years because everything that used to make eve dangerous were heavily nerfed (although, I believe that a lot of it was not intentional).
---
Plus, there are areas of space that do cater to more casual players: HS for pve and LS FW for pvp.
---
Nice one. But why Talos?
---
i l u 2 bb ;)
---
I've got to agree with u/Savanted I really don't think this is the way forward. As large groups have more members, they cause more killmails to flow, more events are generated, and so can infer more intel. And they have the physical infrastructure to do so. Smaller groups do not fire so many events, and do not have the resources. Delaying zKB kill flow will artificially benefit larger alliances, who as u/Savanted rightly points out, do not need more freebies. Big guy sees everything, little guy is blind.
---
BTW: this doesn't detract from the merits of your intent. Null is beautiful now.
---
Note to self, do a couple of BS jumps on every new hole we roll into NS to get free carriers
---
Go to lowsec in an active (contested) FW area! Grab a cheap frigate and fly to a novice plex and blow up ships (including yours)! Very doable, cheap and better than nullsec pvp, in my opinion. You can just jump clone back to null once you're done.
---
Its still completely risk free if you hop in a super/ properly fit rorq, get in standing fleet and fit a cyno.
---
Actually a great alliance level content generator.
---
I can imagine right now, goon titan/super pilots are having the most fun they've had in a long time
---
This forces me to really use the ingame map for the first time in years.
---
Third-party service blackouts are stupid and kind of defeat the point.
---
Extra tank/dps for if he ever gets caught/finds another explorer.
---
The pun is god-tier. Whoever came up with it is a hero.
---
Then you just dump a load of copycat named ships and leave the bot useless
---
&gt;Like how many devs are alts in high positions
---
Probably none.  That kind of stuff is frowned upon, and it's too likely they'll eventually be recognized by voice.
---
Funny to see all the reactions. Hope you enjoy the free time when you pause ratting (you could help me to clean the weed around my house :-)) For the rest fly safe in the unknown space.
---
btw. the blackout will lift automatically around Monday noon. I've added an internal switch so I can enable/disable the blackout again if I need to.
---
I've totally no clue if this blackout is some kind of (recurring) event or if this will stay forever this way. Tbh. Having the local delayed in nullsec but then keep the kills/jump info on the ingame-map/api is only half the job. I guess ccp is doing experiments to get see some reactions. I personally would vote for occasionally blackout events (or call it service disruption of the stargate info network) where nullsec is delayed, jump/kill stats are hidden from the ingame map/or api and nullsec killmails delayed.
---
Keeping wormhole and nullsec space identically in case of game mechanics would be boring and could potentially be a good thing for the blue donat but bad for smaller entities. But having time limited blackout events would allow people to plan and create events like small attacks or roams under the radar, while the rest of the time, their can prepare for the next event. Building a 2nd wormhole like space will not make the game better. 
---
Let's see what CCP things and where the story is heading towards.
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/content
---
Content has more than one meaning.
---
oh no, you've figured it out whatever shall I do.
---
someone built a wooden desk during blackout :D 
---
eve players are a special kind
---
What is the fit for this PVE Marshal?
---
eventually
---
Hi. Akage. Wanna play some DCS?
---
Dscan is much, much less effective.
---
&gt; i never once said they'd all disappear
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ccmsun/bots_arent_active_in_frat_space/etnz5go/
---
i literally quoted you saying it.
---
I'm not opposed to making improvents to the FW system. But bear in mind that the mechanics haven't notably changed from just a few years ago when FW space was *the* happening place to be in EVE, even for players who weren't doing faction warfare. What changed was the balance of other areas. 
---
Specifically, the aftermath of the battle of Asakai, when metric fuckloads of newbies came into the game looking specifically and exclusively for nullsec content, and then CCP and the power blocs gradually adapted to accomodate them.
---
Theoretically I think lowsec and FW could become relevant again by making null a hard place to be a newbie again. That's not to say that it wouldn't help to improve lowsec and FW mechanics as well, just that the balance of other areas is a bigger factor.
---
Duh, he wasn’t using one, so can’t roast him about it.
---
When this happens is there loot?
---
how the hell do you get all those logos so screwed up?
---
...not make bad posts?
---
downship to myrms. that are basically free to lose.
---
don't start your bot up if there has been a kill within x timeframe. if you do lose it... it's a myrm that's basically free, who cares?
---
myrms have an insanely low payback period.
---
It absolutely can if you stretch the game over to it.  You can even recenter your hud to the other window.  It's not great, but it works.
---
Would you be willing to repeat the process and sell me one? :D
---
HMU!
---
Hey Wollari, any way you could limit the "data-blackout" to 0.0 only? High&amp;lowsec are working as before, i see no reason why the information on those regions is also restricted...
---
you first
---
You serioisly expected krabs to krab during this blackout??? Speaking for myself, I will not undock anything during this event, and if they make this permanent I will unsubscribe my two paid for accounts, and no you cannot have my stuff.
---
Don't tarnish my expertly crafted brand l.
---
Give it time. It’ll balance out. There are probably a lot more people hunting and pvping with the new release so people are going to be docked up a bit more. People will get comfortable and go out and krab again.
---
botting =/= playing sorry
---
Yep, same loot as a contested beacon
---
Can you post an aar with screenshots to backup your claims?
---
I'm pro this. 
---
However i think it would be interesting to see the delta in ratting during the blackout so we can see how effective the changes are.
---
Perhaps create a historical record and post after the blackout?
---
Good guys win again!
---
I'll have to give it a try, thanks.
---
apparently you can't read retard
---
i didn't say 'all'
---
i said 'almost all'
---
and likewise, i said they 'almost all disappeared over night' which doesn't imply that they will stay at this level of almost gone
---
The proof is communicating with other humans who play this videogame and realizing everyone but the turbo krabs and botters love the change
---
Massive balls on you much respect
---
It'd have to be the latter. The EULA explicitly forbids players from selling items based off in-game objects, AFAIK, which is pretty shitty given the atrocious state of CCP's merch store.
---
Seriously, it's like they're allergic to money or something. I guarantee they'd never have financial problems ever again if they just got that damn merch store working properly.
---
or their just gona play something else, in the end pvp players will be forced to pve to keep the adm's up
---
Yikes. God forbid you exert effort.
---
This was the first iteration. If this would be a recurring event, it would make sense to restrict the blackout only to nullsec systems. I guess it would be 1-3 hours of going through the templates again and fix things. 
---
Maybe I can do some hotfixes and at some point going throught the minor things
---
The only fact around is that you are forming an opinion based upon supposed clues.
---
Here is your fatal flaw, if everyone will have to buy it to get ISK, who is buying it from them so they get their ISK? Or do you not know how the economy in Eve works?
---
Surprise cooperative krab hunting. You gotta love it
---
you're still pretending this is some magical fix
---
which it isn't, you dumb cunt.
---
Right because every null block is not the same ROFL
---
fofofofofoffo
---
I shouldn't have to. It was already hard enough with local blackout to my vni kills that all warp away when I land on them. Now it's better because they don't see me coming into local, and they go and take away my prime krab finding tool. It's ridiculous
---
standard paint, used picture with all on them with black background, but some of the logos are also black... i dont wanted to actually invest time into this... thats not my style, my memes are the worst
---
Ah it's a Stratios. My mind turned it into a fucked up Avatar
---
Yes but that doesn't mean they are readily prepared to move
---
From its earliest days, nullsec in EvE was supposed to be about players working together to build a place to control and live together.  A place to fight for.
---
Then CCP lost the big picture, they wanted those huge fleet fights that grab all the headlines.  So they “softened” life in null.  It became easier to hold territory, easier to solo rat and solo mine.  Production became much better in null than anywhere else.  People flocked to null, sure.  But the rest of EvE suffered heavy attrition.  The overall game health suffered greatly.
---
I remember days with over 60k players.  CCP didn’t have to have special promotions to get those numbers.  Now, 30k seems like a huge accomplishment.  CCP has had to implement skill trading, micro-transactions, just to keep in the black.  Their great experiment to get players into null has been largely unsuccessful.
---
Every month we see the reports, how much isk and minerals are pouring into new eden.  Especially from null.  This kind of wealth is not good for the game in the long term.  No local should help slow this trend.  It’s not a cure for all the games ills, but making it slightly more risky in null should help.  
---
For the OP, you’re obviously a new player and from your statements it appears you’re not ready to live solo in null.  I don’t mean that as an insult, EvE isn’t meant to be easy.  It’s supposed to be a game where you plan for the long term (since skills train in real time) and learn as time goes on.  You have a choice to make, playing with friends is always better in EvE.  But when their not there, you may need to either: 1) move around to find solo activities you can do as others have suggested, 2) make new friends and do stuff with them (I.e. join roving gangs), 3) find a Corp more active in your time zone, 4) put an alt in highsec and let your main “ride it out” in null.
---
Do you see why it’s hard to have sympathy for your position though?  You are a new player, playing in “endgame” content that was supposed to be for people working together, and having a hard time being there alone.  Sure senior players can make it work, but that’s what happens as players gain experience.
---
For all those players bemoaning the plight of small alliances, better organized alliances were supposed to be able take and hold sovereignty in null.  This change wasn’t supposed to address that, it simply adds a bit more risk to go along with the rewards in null, because it has been out of whack for quite a while.  CCP needs to make it easier to take sovereignty and much harder to defend, as well as introduce a weakness in numbers and/or a vulnerability to supers to address some of the other issues....good luck with that.
---
Some may be waiting for it to end
---
High security, low security, null security.
---
Huh...no security means highest danger..
---
Good to hear, and tnx for Dotlan, i could not play EVE without it ;)
---
why would you log in while this black out is up
---
So you suggest we feel sorry for them?
---
Going thru RR/Sib Squad space in Branch it’s empty, Branch posted very similar bounty figures to Delve in the last MER for a reference to how active it ought to be. 🤔
---
This. What benefit is there to removing things like *sovereignity* of systems? Should we remove all online eve maps too? Rely on word of mouth to know what space is owned by who?
---
Plus, all the information is still out there in the ingame maps anyway so this just makes information clunkier but still accessible without going there.
---
so can you apologize for incorrectly thinking i said something I didn't now? now that we established you're wrong?
---
&gt;you're still pretending this is some magical fix
---
it's not magic, magic doesn't exist child
---
&gt;you stated almost all the bots are gone
---
this is factually true, open your client
---
&gt;and this is irreparable.
---
bots CANNOT program 99.9% safety (nor 90% safety) now that local is gone. It's easy to find botters, and kill botters consistently as a player now.
---
I don't know how you don't understand this
---
oh yeah, cause you're retarded
---
I very much doubt it, there is far easier money to be made elsewhere with less risk.
---
&gt;However, it will mean less industrial actions being performed.
---
This is the fundamental flaw in your logic. You are asserting that because nullsec is less safe industrialists will just stop doing industrial stuff. That's not really going to hold true. Where there's a will there's a way, and there's definitely a will, especially if the prices of goods go up.
---
Ultimately the decision is with CCP as to whether it is a good thing or not. If there is one less paid sub as opposed to before the blackout, there was a financial cost to CCP, however slight. Same goes the other way, one more paid sub and there was a slight financial gain. I don't know how you would measure, or what you would compare against or where you draw the line for "worth it" as a company. That's not a decision for us as players to make. There is definitely some adaptation that needs to be made.  And bots are dying, at least for now. (I think we had one small gang kill the same player 4 times in a row, no log off trap required.)  Give it some time, we'll see what happens.
---
you're wrong.
---
Even if they're "fucked," they're only fucked in nullsec. I guess highsec SOE L4 bots are permissible to operate, though.
---
insurance nerf soon
---
yes, i did hear mumblings about the insurance changes hitting sisi.
---
God I'd hate to think it was that.
---
i've noticed that about him on numerous occasions
---
You do fully realize that there is not enough actual players in the game to fill the space right?  Just saying pvpers like myself should temper their expectations rofl.
---
*laughs in cloaky camper*
---
feel free to actually contest a point, or brick yourself
---
Hit it with [alclad primer](https://www.cybermodeler.com/hobby/paint/alc/paint_alc_grayprimer.shtml) first and you might get rid of the striations.
---
I suggested nothing of the sort.
---
Just that some real krab players may have also chosen to just stay logged off, not just bots.
---
Maybe they think this is temporary, maybe they just don't want to deal with it.
---
Who knows
---
Bosons should have their damage tied to sig like bombs
---
&gt; i did think that bots wouldn't undock now that their program is broken by local chat removal
---
True they probably won't undock until that is fixed.
---
&gt; even if their bot gets updated, it's still at risk of dying
---
Also true. There is just one problem. Bots always had a risk of dying. This change may increase this risk but considering how much Isk even the cheapest VNI bots can earn each month and therefore lose to hunters, there is serious doubt that this will have anywhere near the impact many people think it will.
---
&gt; All the people defending bots, saying how they'll update 'in a day or 2', like it's nothing, are bots and bot sympathisers.
---
That is not true and pretty unfair to say. Most of those people are just pretty pissed that there is such a big part of the community that uses the botting issue as one reason to justify deleting local even tho its pretty clear that this change will not remove the botting problem at all. And at best lead to more bots wandering into other parts of the game. So CCP can pretend like they did something and ignore the issue again like they did for almost a decade. If they actually were botters do you really think they would use botting to argue against the changes? And risk another community shitstorm that could lead to CCP actually implementing some kind of Anti-Cheat Engine? 
---
Of course not, the real abusers of the system are the ones we dont hear about until they get banned.
---
highsec soe bots are already killable
---
My guess is misuse of "fuzzy select" and a really bad source for the logos. If you try to use fuzzy select on an image with a gradient it gets really hard to line things up precisely. He likely pulled these logos from some website that overlays them on a gradient background and then did a lazy default-setting fuzzy select to get this mess.
---
This can be avoided by either getting logos from a better source (I normally use Zkill since it can get you high-quality character photos, ship renders, and logos, but with Zkill down you can just use the [EVE image server](https://imageserver.eveonline.com/)) or just using manual select. It's tedious but it avoids this issue.
---
People will only do it if its profitable...  if it just becomes vni or other ratting ship wake a mole how long do you think that will last?
---
There was far easier money to make with less risk before blackout and yet people still defaulted to ratting.
---
not a bad idea, just seed thousands of slashers in safes lol
---
Bot's can do everything a player can do, and in a lot of cases can do things a player simply cannot do so bots will always be more efficient than us specially at potentially boring and repetitive tasks.
---
Players who asked ccp for no local because they saw it as a way to hurt bot's are idiots, it's literally going to take 1 programmer a few hours of coding to patch the bot and release it to all his paying customers and within seconds of installing the bot patch their back to business as usual.
---
If you are dumb enough that you think botters are not going to find a workaround your opinion is mute.
---
ask the guy who made this
---
https://i.imgur.com/v2807GA.png
---
I laughed out loud. Thanks :)
---
bash their structures
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
It was goons who was suppopsed to be hunted.
---
listen: i've asked this 30+ times to 30+ people
---
what
---
workaround?
---
without local, it's impossible to have an infallible intelligence network period. You can always blops in an alt, log off for a couple of days, just put an alpha character in, etc and it's impossible to know if you're still there, blopsed out, cyno'd in, anything.
---
you can always sit on a site, wait for the target to warp to the next site, beat him there, and tackle him on landing.
---
there is no infallible way, and therefore, no safe way to rat, because as soon as people find out you're ratting in a system, they can send a player to consistently kill you
---
Agreed
---
Like what?
---
Its not so bad really. I mean you have a solid point that a lot less people are going to be krabs like before and nullsec output is going to drop considerably in the next week. Prices are going to sky rocket,  which for some, myself included is the most welcome and anticipated side effect I'm thinking of.
---
On the other hand there is a really good thing I don't know if many people realize, In that any current small group living in null, are going to be faced with the decision of being farmed on a regular basis, leaving null all together, or joining TAPI, Goons, Panfam to continue turbokrabbing within super umbrellas. 
---
The last point is the best outcome IMHO. It will improve these groups numbers and consolidate power within the three main blocks and probably make the game a lot more playable for these blocs.
---
There's good in this for everyone, people will just have to learn to adapt to these facts and make a choice!
---
Imperial Jubilee or just dumpster it
---
Ccp dont have this type of ship for sale! Wth
---
.... really none of this would have happened?
---
How convenient, then, that there's a galactic cease fire!
---
spray it white and pretend it's purity of the throne skinned.
---
EVE's nullsec meta is stale, in fact is has almost always been stale. CCP has finally decided that ship balance, sov mechanics, and structures might not be the problem. The problem is that Nullsec is entirely too safe and requires almost no personal interaction with others to accomplish goals. It is so safe that bots are ubiquitous, and that includes all the players who behave just like bots -- I don't see a difference, both are toxic to the game. 
---
I also don't see a problem with falling ISK and mineral generation. This is a long standing problem in EVE and perhaps it will now be solved. Expensive ships don't concern me -- increasing the value resources is a good thing and will drive risk and conflict. 
---
If CCP want this game to go on for another 20 years, it can't do that on the backs of Bots. It needs to create a game where risk and reward are balanced in a meaningful and satisfying way. It needs to return to a game where greed is checked by aggression and human interaction is the foundation of success.
---
As long as you say "this is temporary", you'll never know what the meta will evolve to.  Only if CCP say this is permanent will you see how nullsec changes.  Players will behave differently in either case.
---
I just want to be able to see a concise action report of a fleet I did last night.
---
Right, because not PVEing after a local blackout is a sign of botting. Hint: it isn't. An overwhelming number of null players are risk-averse. I would absolutely not have undocked to rat if this happened to me way back in 2014, when I was up in Branch. Calm the hell down and consider the human element before crying about bots.
---
Ah, the nuBitterVet, lives in some kind of WH-N or Thera.  Shame that snakes are not in vogue anymore.
---
Your welcome o7
---
You need to train up your Photoshop skill.
---
I gotta admit, the visual of the base material there... I’d actually like that as a skin for a titan... (if I ever get to fly one)
---
haha epic meme guys, you made the people who don't have the tools the big groups have suffer because you think this is an epic meme!!1 hahaha good one
---
You missed it.
---
 
---
r/eve was set private for a few hours
---
&gt; Or all they need to do is unsubscribe for a month and wait it out and CCP will get the message. It is fun that all the hunters (imagine which percentage of eve they represent) are dancing around of how cool it is, but the krabs (imagine what percentage they represent) are not happy. CCP took something and gave nothing in return, so as I've learned from my 20 months son that will have repercussions.
---
You must not have paid attention to every other change that only benefited krabs. A lot of people have unsubscribed due to changes over the last 3 years, but CCP didn't rollback anything because of it. This will be no different.
---
Done. The blackout for lowsec/highsec is now lifted. You can watch kills/jumps/stats again for empire systems. The blackout now only affects systems with a security &lt; 0
---
Yea, I can’t 😅 as mentioned here. Sucks because  it would be money in models like these. I’d certainly pay good money for one
---
how would ccp even know if there were more or less subs?
---
i imagine most people on a recurring plan are paid up a few months ahead as it makes no sense to have a recurring sub only sub for 1 month at a time, and unless the event lasts more than a month they won't know who's let their accounts lapse that were paid in plex (if they haven't paid for multiple months in advance when plex took a nose dive the other day) - or who has just turned those accounts in to SP farms and aren't going to use them to generate or be content any more.
---
Actually having the option in game to block or opt out of killmails would be really cool.
---
Then the people who want to use skill can, and those that want their info private could just opt out
---
/r/blacked
---
Idk, I fly a stealth tengu.  I can live out my dreams as a space pirate now.  Without people logging off or having Intel on where I am at.  It is like a dream.
---
Yea I’m ordering paint and some liquid green stuff after deciding :)
---
&gt; The problem is that Nullsec is entirely too safe and requires almost no personal interaction with others to accomplish goals.
---
safety isn't what stifles player interaction - being able to own and run multiple accounts is.
---
why the fuck would i want to bother trying to co-ordinate with other players and herd cats to get something done when for a fraction of the hassle i can inject a character to do exactly what i need and can dictate when, where, and how that need is performed?
---
you want interaction? stop players being able to literally be 1 man bands by just being able to play all the instruments at once, simultaneously.
---
I don't have those answers, and like I stated in my post, I don't know what the metric would be, or what you would measure against.
---
I'm just looking at the PCU. not like a hawk, but it wasn't above 23k when i looked yesterday, and it's under  20k today.
---
i remember when this game used to break 30k easily.
---
He has already said it's coming back Monday
---
Missed being on that km by about 15 seconds. Was part of a TEST gatecamp in Eso that pulled up stakes and rode to the sound of guns when we heard Titans were tackled. We got a nice consolation prize on the way home when we stumbled on a T2/T3 six-man cruiser gang. We engaged and scored about 6b in kills including a bling Loki and a high-grade talisman pod in return for a Garmur and a Retri. 
---
Right before all this happened FRT had lost a Proteus hunter to a semi-afk TEST VNI in Eso. Pandas were not having a good night.
---
WWB\*
---
It would be cool to be defaulted off for early players to not have a permit record out of game of them learning how to PvP(still have it in character sheets for players to look back on) until they enable it and it could reveal their name on old loses maybe if they choose to opt into the zkillboards to give them their all time ISK destroyed/loss.
---
Oh you mean you tell people how to meant to play a sandbx game?
---
What about if I kill you and I want you on my killboard?
---
Spontaneous surprise content best content.
---
Are the dimensions of this model the same as you can find online? 13.82 x 6.39 x 6.54 mm?
---
Or did you scale it up? It kind off looks bigger than 13.8cms in length
---
Happens to me too, but I think it only has to do with the avatar rendering or maybe the assets worth calculation). If you 'minimize' the upper avatar part of the character sheet, I think the problem goes away.
---
I scaled it up. It’s 25 cm in length :) gotta be as big as possible 😅 1mm layer height and 20% infill
---
What is that compared to the same weekend last year? Or the last several years? And is that just the bots not logging in, or players saying "fuck it!"? And how many of those are alpha accounts as opposed to subbed accounts? Lots of metrics to track and compare against. I'm not saying that the numbers you're watching are wrong, but they likely don't tell the whole story.
---
So true
---
best place to find that info, of the stuff that can be found is probably here https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
Yea, happens to me too.  Something is up with that.
---
We delve things and just drop supers on the Drifters.  Or the structures just bomb them.
---
No one lives in vale or geminate anymore
---
A whet dream. 
---
But get on that legion boi.
---
Anecdotal evidence best evidence.
---
if only you weren't blue with 90% of players.
---
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
---
I'm ok with it.  Botting programs don't work well if there's no Intel to post.
---
Lets get the Rag out onto a tray...
---
The elitist nerd with a nasty mouth has crawled out of his mother’s basement.
---
No downvote from me.  I think zkill and boards like it are bad for the game especially as you say, people tend to focus on them rather than enjoying themselves.
---
Not saying that Mar5hy isn't biased, but it makes sense to roll for the regions with most amount of krabs. 
---
Legacy and Imperium also have the most amount of stupid krabs, as that comes with having lots of members
---
There have been goon fcs in BB that only rolled for northern regions.
---
It is about measuring epeen I would love to see only what dropped in the killmails and the shiptype
---
Well done! Makes a new player like me feel like anything is possible with a team!
---
It is safe as long as you do this every 60 seconds.
---
It's much better than it was before they removed local.
---
I pay people to do shit for me on the regular, i'm not mad just really really lazy.
---
Yodik usually runs a noctis instead of a dps ship anyways
---
&gt; give it a day or two for them to update the bots to use dscan not local and they'll probably be back.
---
**Laughs in combat recon**
---
That's a people problem and not a kill board problem.
---
Streams are recorded on twitch if you want to check him out
---
Tldw bullet point version pls?
---
I was gonna say purple KM but zkill down so i retract my previous statement
---
Hanoi Hanna would be proud, we'll call you Blackhole Bob. Continue your disinformation campaign.
---
Mate you can't just post a shitty line of pseudocode and pretend to be smart
---
Content
---
it has
---
lol same
---
Sounds French to me
---
I miss spending time with that group of players. The DTP crew was always so laid back.
---
This was the site banner for the Down the Pipe wormhole podcast from years back.
---
No, why should they do this? Most will just let their subscriptions run out and wait. Let the pvp-nerds get the adms up, then they'll see how much work it needs to hold the sov more secure if they piss off the industrialists and miners.
---
Integrity.
---
I don't see any Stealth Bombers...
---
This logic is so backwards it’s almost amazing.
---
Yes interacting with other humans is ancedotal
---
Just food for thought: as a legally blind PVP player this is really tough for me.  I hunted last night using the in game map and caught people, got kills, and had a great time... but Dotlan has by far the most accessible layout for visually impaired people--and for me, having been in PVP for 10 years and thoroughly knowing how to hunt without Dotlan, it's not so much a "git gud" moment as just a way to get a headache straining at the in game map/other 3rd party maps. I'm not complaining--I know I'm in a tiny minority--I think this is all really exciting, just wanted to offer that experience.
---
I'll put it a different way then.  He's got enough of a hard time that he causes for himself with the things he says, I'm not going to be the one that shits all over his in game life.  He's already on the DNR for multiple alliances and his hisec corp couldn't do shit.  He evidently joined another null corp which was promptly evicted from their botting krablands.  
---
He isn't a spy, he's just an awkward dude who is getting called on his bullshit.  Now, if one of my fellow corporates wants to post his name, that's cool.
---
How is it a shit fit? It’s mean for running relic sites.... the downsides of a cloak don’t really matter and the upsides are quite apparent. It’s a good idea imo.
---
Care to share the stl or the the thingiverse link?
---
I applaud the idea honestly.  I'm not sure about incentivising it though.
---
I've had discussions about kill mail data with people on a few occasions and I've never liked the flawed logic of the individual kill board and never understood the fascination with *getting on that kill to make muh kb green* when there's 100 dudes getting a kill for one dude losing a ship.  (honestly I'd much prefer if it were the top damage and final shot that get awarded the kill) 
---
That said however, I recognise its importance when recording and gauging the outcome of a fight at Fleet and gang levels.
---
Delayed information is a good thing for eve, it let's you analyse and improve things without acting as an early warning system for the risk averse.
---
Then flair up!
---
Fade is also pretty much empty
---
Care to edit that into an actual coherent sentence?
---
Can confirm. Rolling the null now.
---
Your tears are delicious, nomnomnom! 
---
The amount of quality game famous content creators resubbing is worth way more to CCP than your two anti content accounts, so don't hold your breath...or maybe do, up to you.
---
Yorkshire Gold or nowt.
---
Yeah I would like to see it go until the end of the month and we'll see how much bot isk is taken out of the economy. To realize the scope of how much the constant ratting brings in.
---
He is just one reason eve dies...
---
I mean, you don't need to be subbed to contract me things ;)
---
Lol one roll is all it takes for a fresh hole i know ive done it in a freighter
---
We snagged a covops cyno tengu and almost got his backup panther. Also had a couple other small skirmishes, but we didn’t roll enough for more exciting null holes. We got out to catch I think and our enyos got wiped by a Kiki gang. 
---
Props to Odins call for the friendly tengu hunter. 
---
Props to hard knocks for the small Mach gang... even though you never caught us. 
---
Props to whoever the kikis were. 
---
Fuck the weak horde krabs who needed 50+ ships, including titans to blog our small gang. I hope that’s fun for you? You should for sure kick the shitty cynabal pilot who managed to die despite zero need to stay on grid.
---
I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave
---
Off course :) https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:150135
---
nice story bro mad me chuckle, roll strong
---
When rectangles become trapezoid!
---
While I admire the couple of pilots who have used zKill to watch their chain and set a trap for me, this level of intel is really too much. zKill should not make it trivial to see a hunter approaching simply by watching for kills in nearby systems. Likewise, having general information on habits of a particular person or place is awesome and seems fair, but, knowing there is a gatecamp or hunter in a system _right now_, and what ship(s) they are flying is excessive free intel.
---
I love zKill, and I think the proposed delay would be an awesome improvement.
---
I was in Catch for a while yesterday and saw dozens of ships moving through pipes, as well as players in structures. I caught two ships.
---
Disagree.
---
People are going out on roams now because they feel as though there is a chance to actually catch something. Previously it was just instant reacting bots or people docking because their near2 pinged about the group 10 jumps away. 
---
The lack of perfect infallible intel has made people want to roam again. This is a direct change due to local.
---
Now don't be mean, we are poor newbeans so we need any advantage we can get.
---
This version of spin on the "grrr-no-local" side is really fucking pathetic tbh.
---
 It's a little sad that you guys are resorting to the same "end of Eve online" argument that highsec care bears latch onto.
---
Wormholer btw
---
I'm a little surprised that no BCS hookbill is still able to churn out that much dps.
---
Cool video
---
What? All 5 of them are there.
---
I guess I'm a hero.
---
Tell the creator of the video to consider blurring chat next time.Gj on the kill btw
---
You only get a kill report if you're the last one to shoot, everyone that helps doesn't get that KR; I feel that is the change that needs to happen.
---
yep, I had a good Astero vs Saber fight out in null. Normally I'd cloak or GTFO as soon as I see someone in local, but not this time. The Saber landed before I was able to d-scan, and we had a good brawl.
---
Yes. When it’s decloaked.
---
Blah eat my ass
---
I don't suppose you've dealt with sov null warfare before, have you? Keeping ADMs high makes it take longer for attackers to entosis the Ihub, which is what establishes a groups claim to a system. If the pvpers care about holding territory, then they certainly do care about ADMs.
---
Why should any crab pay if they get protection for free via the fuck you button?
---
How's Deklein looking...all those juicy botted RR systems?
---
From 1 to 500 I got a single drop of 7 plex
---
Because you don't hate pvp?
---
Don't want to spoil this for you. But from i hear from various groups, with the lack of zkill, dotlan and local almost no one is hunting as "hunters" are constantly dying to response fleets
---
Why would a PvPer want to hold sov? You’re talking about nullsec crabs still.
---
i just unsubbed my 17 alts who would be afk ratting otherwise
---
Because that button doesn't last forever.
---
No, you dont get it... having less stability in nullsec is EXACTLY what pvpers want. 
---
Chaos breeds pvp.
---
people will forget to fill their SRP if killmails lag
---
you cant sell these but you can gift it and receive gift or dallar in return
---
Nah. Just a funny book to link to a funny dude. Love you. Have a great day
---
Simple, if a bit long winded. But gets the point across and has a play on words. Thumbs up :)
---
no - at that point it's more lucrative to just go and play in other areas of space.
---
I guess in the sense that the heat-death of the universe will eventually claim us all, sure.
---
I came to 0.0 with 50 mil isk and a harbinger many years ago...I learned what dscan was. Slowly ground up isk. Lost many ships. Killed very few. And helped grow the Corp I'm in. In the process learned how to deal with 5-10 man gangs.
---
As others have said 0.0 is not supposed to be casual pubbie land. Krabs will die. Pvp'ers will adapt. Just as I said when fozzie sov came out... fuck the little guy. This is empire building and should not be tailored to the small guy.
---
Quite a silly argument.  Everybody illustrates kills, events and so on with zkillboard links.  Is that a people problem too?  What isn't a people problem in this context?  Please explain.
---
wow bro that's a lot of pve good shit keep it rockin
---
Interesting. Have not had a chance to log in yet since black out.
---
Why do the majority players shoot at me?
---
Trying to get inside their way of thinking.
---
If I walk around I don't feel the urge to kill every passer-by when no police is around. So why would I behave like that ingame?
---
You have other options, like saying hi, maybe asking for protection money. I don't see a lot of that. Instead players behave as NPC's. Why?
---
You'd get more fights if warping away took longer, but if that changed loss adverse pvpers would cry foul for weeks.
---
thanks ccp
---
There's more spaceship violence to be had, how is that not worth while?
---
Nope :( All you can do is rename them with ---- or something in front to move them up and at least use the 9 and 0.  
---
CCpls, bring balk the goddamn 'Use current overview preset' at least that was a way to rapidly switch between 2 presets.
---
Normal players who like to hunt are playing because of this.
---
because that's completely irrelevant to the question being asked.
---
It must all be bots, cleary this couldn't be hardcore krabs that just wait it out.
---
The "Thanks for no local" Spin crowd is in high gear I see, but it really doesn't matter. CCP is looking at game data, not propaganda posts. Thanks for playing though.
---
 Maybe, but without so many turbokrabs at least plex prices should fall somewhat.
---
I finally made the connection when I took a fight with WINGspan and went "finally some content" then went oooohhh as I got the letter. 
---
Btw stratios with Gecko is totally cheating.... I could have won that fight. (Probably not).
---
I too like when people don't see [what's coming](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290851635717210112/599262955061772291/unknown.png)
---
whats the point of buying plex if there isnt all those turbo crabs around to buy them to pay for their 40 miner alts lol..
---
I hope it turns out ok, I love the game, just hope this ends well and does not end badly.
---
Where they bots do you think, or just derping?  I'm guessing they must be bots if they're controlled by the same person.  IDK who can super rat on multiple clients...
---
 The work around is botting in low sec space.
---
Yeah people underestimate everything on this ship. I also used rage for most of my fights. With 2 webs it looks like its the best missle choice in my xp.
---
Thanks CCP
---
No.
---
No they're not.
---
I guess I hadn't thought of it that way, necessarily. But surely all of the pvp alliances like Test and Init would still be concerned about holding sov. But are you more meaning that nullsec leadership cares about holding sov, but the actual pvpers themselves don't care? In which case, you're suggesting the goals of the fighting force and the goals of leadership aren't exactly in line with each other, which could be interesting.
---
The only way to know whether there's a cloaky hunter in your system is local. With local gone, why would you not be camping a relic?
---
well they used there fighters ... and also the one nyx which warped in to rescue.  
---
I dont think they were bots just didnt know what to do, or hadnt much chance at all.
---
A very high probability of being bots. That area is notorious for it. I used to live nearby and you'd often see countless players ratting / mining 23/7.
---
Light your cyno and a friend will show up soon to help.  
---
  
---
If not, just keep relighting it, someone will come for you
---
I mean look at thoses fits .. jesus
---
How many systems that spawn pirate relics are there in eve. 
---
Because the answer to that is probably more than there are interdictor pilots in the game. 
---
Ye of zero faith.
---
circle of hell were botters (thank skillu/capqu for protecting their sov in cache and outer passage)
---
iron crown aren't bots they're just fucking bad at eve online
---
y i k e s
---
Tbh I'm also fine with this, too.  Nullsec was always meant to be a dangerous collaborative experience where you can carve out a home with your corpmates and work together to defend it.
---
Semi afk ratting while watching intel channels makes the game a joke and always has.
---
Adm's could be 1.0 in delve and I wouldn't give a fuck. Bring the pvp man... try to raid the castle
---
I’ve minimized the avatar part of the window. Can also try to lower character rendering quality in the settings.
---
If Provi, each roam would have been wiped by a defensive fleet before finding each other with Local Info.
---
I have no clue.  I found out about the station control thing two days ago on accident.  While i was letting the corp know, another guys told me about deploying the command centers from the station.
---
Just picture a wormhole system as a cardboard box. Poke a couple of hole in it at random places. Those holes are the wormhole connections. Fill in a hole and poke a new one in a random place somewhere. There's your new connection that goes to either J-Space or K-space, depending on the type of hole.
---
That's basically how J-space works
---
You should check out the odd space, it's insane!
---
They are exercising their right to purge. Don't worry, not everyone is bloodthirsty maniac even in EVE, these people just know how to stay away from areas where they would be  under attack.
---
Oh, I'm fine with it too (wormholer btw). I'm just irked by all this wailing about bots, when it really boils down to human behaviour.
---
Does it come with a pack of 70 yr old cigs?
---
You got me... Not saying whom I am, however you wouldn't have, had I not made the mistake that I did.
---
would it not take a lot less time if it was printed vertically?
---
Are WH'ers completely irrelevant now 🤔
---
Yea I guessed that it has to do with the character rendering, it still shouldn't lock up the system like that
---
But I wanna see my characters :(
---
I really hope it never ends. Yesterday was some of the most of I ever had in EVE.
---
I think it's a little of column A, little of column B.  You're 100% right about this being about human behavior, and the purest expression of that risk adverse mindset is getting bots to make your isk for you.
---
I hope this pushes people to realize the true safest way to make isk in null is to work together as a team.  It's not obscene isk per hour, but solo roamers cant fuck with you and you might even get an actual ~good fight~ out of it which is supposedly the dream scenario for eve players even though we constantly avoid them
---
If they run, they're bots. If they don't run, they're well-disciplined bots.
---
There you go.
---
That would still count as selling in the eyes of CCP. The big question is "what is the intent?".
---
If the intent was to give it away as a gift, and recieve no money at all. Meaning actually not recieve money, not just pretending, then it may fly. However "gifting" in exchange for a "gift" is literally trading one item for another, as the intent was to trade gift for gift (aka receive payment).
---
Good to see you still kicking around ;)
---
Not sure if trolling, but I think this behavior is actually good for the health of the game's economy, i.e. the more assets destroyed the better for the game. I never liked ransoms for that reason (well, and the fact that ransoms aren't honored like 99% of the time anyway :P).
---
Regarding the actual player motives, EvE is a spaceship PvP-oriented sandbox MMO, so it would be actually unreasonable for people not to shoot you, if they have a chance. :P
---
And you're also exaggerating a bit. People do group up, and will occasioanally help you out, but due to the nature of tha game, you should always be wary.
---
Probably. But I had some problems with the details in the front the last time I did that. I this time I tried printing on an angle. There are some blemishes underneath, but I’m gonna fix that up with some green stuff I think.
---
Careful, those sharp edges might hurt when you put it in
---
That’s the way she likes it
---
That part is still great about local blackout.
---
What isn't great at all, is that hotdrops like these are still possible. This gives the defender almost no time to react with a defense gang/fleet. I really hope that ccp goes through with needed cyno changes so that a) supercap umbrellas become reeeaally ineffective at protecting lone supercap ratters and b) dreadbombs or hotdrops like these become impossible too. That would strike a nice balance and give a much needed nerf to capitals in general.
---
Well depends ... they now moved down a keepstar to 2R-CRW ... around that they very often have alot of people online, but can form also pretty quick. But i rarely enter that region anyway. Fade is big enough :D
---
r/evejobs is a great place to look for corporations :)
---
double the fleet attendance, double amount of people in chat  
---
3 simultaneous roaming and camping fleets
---
success is the word for this
---
That's it, Eve is dead, we can all finally stop posting. So, what's the next MMO that can be ruined as a group effort? WoW Classic?
---
Because Catch isn’t full of renters, it’s Brave?
---
Sounds reasonable.
---
Were orcas buffed in the last couple years? 
---
I us d the advantage of the blackout to hunt an orca supported mining op. In the past, if have soloed it with a bomber.
---
 Last night I tried  and dualboxed a cruiser and bomber and got both my ships destroyed. That orca tanked hard as hell. It was still a close thing but goddamn I went I. Thinking it'd be a cakewalk.
---
Loving the blackout. I may have lost my ass but it was more fun that I've had in a while.
---
depend one actor have a french accent another a russian one and the girl just english
---
Ultimately, the goal HAS to be to remove the massive coalitions. Eve NEEDS smaller alliances not just living next to each other, but also shooting each other. This is what made the game great 15 years ago.
---
Is blackout the way to get there? I don't know. Maybe. But from CCPs viewpoint, it's probably better than doing nothing. If losing a few PvE-only nerds (How the fuck you can enjoy PvE in this game is beyond me anyway) and the botmasters is the price to pay in order to get a healthy game environment back, then Im sure CCP will be happy to pay that price.
---
Praise Bob! o//
---
Well tbh ... they had some time to react. Also with a fort in system they could have some fax in there.  
---
Also it was china prime time ... so we know it was risky.  
---
In Addition they seem to had no scouts ... and the nyx were sitting with 0 speed.  
---
I mean in a wormhole you have to make some prepartions too before you start ratting.  
---
I guess no local made it easier to catch, but probably would have worked also with local.
---
I'm guessing that's why is pissed.
---
Working on my own fleet at the moment!
---
https://imgur.com/o5FEGej
---
You must be a newer player who didnt play through the 2008-2012 golden era. These changes are moving us back to that. Its all going to work out beautifully :)
---
Test and init arent pvp alliances, theyre krabs with a few pvpers sprinkled amongst them
---
paying for the filament, just conveniently comes out as a ship you like
---
If I opt out and you kill me but your opted in, then by all means show on your killboard that you killed a hull, to show you killed "Some one" in a "Hell" for example, you just wouldn't see the name of the person who died, or what their ship was fit like, or what was in their cargo.
---
You get to brag about killing a Hell still, and the other guy gets to remain private and not have his deaths used against him.
---
Are there any nullsec pvp alliances then? My main interest here is finding where the goals of individual factions within a nullsec coalition diverge or even are counter to each other.
---
What's the problem with the fits (total noob about super fits here)?
---
I mean, there are a lot of technical "workarounds" that would be within the letter but not the spirit of the law, I'm sure.
---
Slack is our version of discord. Was complicated at first but it is actually a very good application.
---
they dont HAVE to do anything of that sort.
---
I'm gonna be the joy killer - lets get past the post change hype and see what its like a in week's time.
---
If you read PvP as 'non-fleet PvP' then it's absolutely true, sov/adms don't matter a damn, but for the large fleet PvP, the mechanics which force the aggressors to hold grid longer, and thus bring a large enough fleet to hold that grid, and which allow the defender time to assemble their fleet, are critical... Luckily thats the absolute worst kind of PvP... So let the adms burn
---
not shield supers
---
That sir, is beautiful!
---
I don't rat :D           
---
But i play eve ... well, kind of.
---
you just look at this from the narrow viewpoint of  solo pvper
---
Exactly
---
The patches bit will still perform worse than a bot with local, by a significant margin.
---
They will die much more often.
---
I don't see how that's relevant at all
---
We can only hope
---
THANKS CCP
---
Or bot aspirants, perhaps?
---
I like the idea of a delay.
---
My dscan still uses whatever tab I have open in my overview
---
Using Japan's Pachinko as a template:
---
1. Trusted 3rd party sells the buyer a banana for a price that is suspiciously close to what seller would charge for his Titan.
---
2. Buyer swaps banana for Titan.
---
3. Seller loves banana but finds these really nice banana enthusiast (coincidentally also often acts as a 3rd party) who loves to buy bananas for the price suspiciously close to what seller would have charged for his Titan.
---
Would this be retarded enough to be legal?
---
2004-2007 was also pretty sweet - 0.0 felt like a genuine adventure
---
That checkbox is still there...at least as of a few days ago when I used it.
---
Model #3:   join a large alliance and play under an umbrella.
---
Net worth is done servside every 12 hours not locally.
---
That’s awsome :)
---
What if the bot networks were to begin renaming their ships every 60 seconds to part of a hash generated off a public UID, time seed, system name, and a salt?
---
Ie: 0001-1378-5E2BA285182F
---
[UID]-[DAY MINUTE]-[Hash of UID+Day Minute+System Name+Bot Network Salt]
---
If a hash ever doesn't match, bounce, if a time is ever too far back, bounce
---
It's not about instant gratification.
---
I fully believe that CCP could still allow for killmails to be shared in game prior to their ability to be accessed externally so that you could have the very thing I mention: communication in an MMO.
---
I can meme it in BSB, I can link it to the fleet so we can have a laugh, or I can post it into the Intel channel so we can share the info. All of these take a human interaction instead of the information being automatically gathered instantly.
---
Most let or converted to crab alliances. Still some left tho
---
Trimark I's on a super?
---
You are making claims with no factual evidence.
---
Nope. I have enough tank. what is hell spawn? you must kill webs and neuts first. and when you can overload you AB to move out from incoming damage. And you need also moving and have some transversal. If you stop you will die=)
---
The hunters are scared.. delve is ironically safer now than pre blackout
---
Yeh i know i ran quite a few in my sac but just had two reppers as very occasionally i would get a shit BS spawn with webbing frigs that overwhelmed the power of one repper. 
---
Might be my missile skills arent good enough to kill them quickly enough.
---
Flair checks out
---
I love that music.
---
Nah, you don't have to be remotely good at the game to own or use a super nowadays. The average super pilot in 2019 has the same level of fitting knowledge and PVP experience as the average Caldari Navy Raven pilot who only ran level 4 missions in Motsu did back in 2009.
---
I'm content with the levels of contentious pun-related content; Or is that incontinent?
---
Possibly offended by your offensive offenses, maybe.
---
My point is you can't rat on multiple clients.  Fighters are too "clicky" for that.  So either this was 3 people or 1 person with some automated "assistance".
---
I want to be poor enough to buy a titan!
---
I don't think so.
---
guy runs 10 bots, all he does now is put one of them on grid with the in gate, cloaks, and starts his bots mining, or ratting, Hostile gate splash happens, cloaked hunter exposes himself for a fraction of a second which is an infinity of time for a BOT, which then instantly tells all the other working bots to dock.
---
This is literally such a tiny insignificant change in code that I would be amazed if it's not already written and being sold already.
---
If anything this change once the above bot setup goes live, if its not already will make catching bots near impossible, before this they relied on faulty intel provided by players, this system forces them to make their own intel which is flawless.
---
I'm not against the black out per say, but claiming it's a good thing to fight botters is just stupidity.
---
So if ccp does it ok, anyone else not ok.  How about the small groups get out and gather intel. Instead of looking for instant gratification because of the intel provided by 3rd parties. Sure it may impact smaller groups more than larger ones but that can be said about every change made in this game.  That is not a valid reason to oppose or propose a change in the game.
---
I like this comment. I will use " wormhole space is like a cardboard box" in the future
---
Stop making me want to resub
---
t2 resist mods on a supercarrier (should be A-type EANMs if you're armor tanking)
---
one had an active tank, which is ridiculous because rats shouldn't really get through your shield buffer and players can always out-dps your active tank if they're dropping you
---
t1 capital rigs on supers
---
in general, ludicrous poorfits that suggest the people involved had no experience in pvp and were cutting corners to make more isk
---
For being a Director you sure can be dumb sometimes. Literally the PANIC button is on a timer, it is up, your unprotected Rorqual eats shit without protection, whether it be from the sleazy mercs or from your umbrella.
---
Ah, being in Wingspan is the one thing I miss about EVE.  Y'alls made the game a lot of fun.
---
It's not coming back.
---
They seem cobbled together with what was in the hangar, tbh.
---
Man you are bitter.
---
The rigs on the first is pro man
---
Who knew positive changes in content creation could come from removing features. Eve is doing the WoWclassic thing too, eh?
---
Run silent, run deep.
---
"I'm not shooting you, I'm just delivering a bullet really really quickly to your body."
---
how would you roam if they remove npc stargates?
---
if i don't want you in my space, i just don't put you on the ACL for my jump bridge network. congrats, you're now locked out of nullsec entirely.
---
how would you invade another region?
---
Same here. But only for the first opening. If i close and reopen, there is no delay at all. I'd say its the picture rendering as someone already mentioned.
---
Who caught these kills for the Fleet, if I might ask?
---
https://youtu.be/bGHcLZ4QDPI
---
Fairly true which is why the recent war  by Goons is a bit scary when you think about it.
---
No super cap fights, tons of structure bashes and moving
---
But all those green  pilots now have a better grasp on super carrier / titan mechanics
---
all these things
---
nObOdY WiLl fLy OuTsIdE oF tHeIr UmBrElLa
---
I just got the "We're not happy until you're content"
---
That's a god-tier pun right there.
---
Its harder than you think, they made 3 man abyssals and people just multibox them. If you make the apm high enough to prevent multiboxing then people will likely ignore them.
---
1 of the Nyxs has Trimarks and a plate fit while the other 2 have Capital Web Rigs, so It's probably 2 different people at the very least.
---
yeah same for me too
---
Nice. Is that an Ender 3 or CR?
---
Yea, it’s hilarious how few of them are rattling around Detorid area.
---
It's called standings
---
This would be easily detected by ccp
---
Cr-10s pro :)
---
Paint it as a Tenga egg
---
why?
---
The only real PvP alliances in null are small and hold little to no territory. 
---
The blocs are miners or krabbers, period. Everything they do is in the interests of mining and krabbing. 
---
PvP is incidental to them, and typically when they have groups within them that PvP, they go for highly risk averse PvP.
---
From a pure PvP standpoint, nullsec can burn. And I say that as someone who doesn't enjoy low or high PvP. 
---
When the prices go up, the kills and losses just mean more. When the plexers biomass, that's one less incentive for potential pvp'ers to engage in pve+ (hunting miners and ratters).
---
Why not just fight them instead of bending the knee?
---
I had to google that one 😅
---
At this point "neckbeard roam" would be apt anyway
---
the fuck you button is a cyno
---
This is getting stupid now
---
because there's little reason to fight people, and significantly more reason to want to amalgamate groups.
---
Okay, so then, when do the bots undock?
---
Wormholes also exist, will they scan down and assign themselves to watch the wormholes too?
---
And no, before they relied on perfect Intel: local.
---
Even waiting for the hostile to declaok at the gate gives the hunters more time than before.
---
Yeeeaaaa boiiii
---
damn doper than I remembered
---
I'm allied to RR and I got bubbled in their own back yard. And usually flying through there's barely any blues around. Like wtf man.
---
Nice. I have an Ender 3 Pro and that thing is amazing. The quality of prints from the Creality 3D printers rival that of printers that cost a few thousand dollars if you get them dialed in.
---
You are!
---
What movie is it?
---
I fly almost exclusively solo and I use zkill plus the in-game map to fly towards systems with fights while avoiding the cancer gatecamps.
---
There are of.course other ways I could roam but using zkill gets me way more content that isn't just - jump into a hellcamp and die in fire.
---
I feel like delayed zkill will primarily hurt the people out there making the dynamic.content. 
---
The risk averse 90% won't change their behavior at all.
---
now compare something sensible.
---
what does a retriever get? and what ore are you using for that calculation?
---
Well one of them did their best to be.
---
WOW WHAT AN AMAZING VIDEO LIKED COMMENTED AND SUBSCRIBED SMASHED THAT BELL LIKE IT WAS A FAT SLAG IN COLLEGE
---
Hope you didnt google that at work :D
---
Yeah max orca+hulk would be relative to probably a rattle.
---
So thats 2 accounts vs 1 account?
---
I did that. Dome is atrocious. I split the stl, intention is to print the dome frontside up and the rest of the stem vertically then do a glueup. Will post when done. 
---
Far, far down the line I intend to carve one out of aluminium. First got to build the cnc tho :)
---
Classified. It's a Marshal, and therefore a gank target. I would prefer people trying to kill me not know the modules I have equipped. Sorry.
---
That’s called having a life :-)
---
But I heard your calls and intel blackout is in place
---
Another carefully thought out well planned idea from a PVE expert. You guys are killing it!!!
---
Oh they have. They've definitely undocked... and reshipped... again and again.
---
you would still have worm holes to contend with.
---
And that would still be a valid option.
---
Imagine knowing any time an enemy fleet is active in your region while ratting. Now imagine not knowing and that fleet landing on grid with you. The blackout is nearly entirely responsible for this.
---
He already rage quitted.
---
With the Nullsec blackout in effect, what is the best way to avoid being ganked from doing abyssal sites besides the usual "do it in staging" or unpopulated system? It seems pretty unfair that they can just anchor a can next to your trace and basically no where to escape. Thoughts?
---
This is really well done! Some 3d prints look a bit... Off. This is not that.
---
Sure they do! Via Plex in game
---
and one wonders just how long that can hold up before someone sees this as a excellent oppertunity.
---
No shit
---
&gt;I may have lost my ass but it was more fun that I've had in a while.
---
Haha this sums up my experience as well. 
---
I think you may have just encountered shit fit orcas before, with just T2 mods they can mount a 500k EHP tank, and they can do 570 DPS with hammerheads. Any cruiser would have trouble dealing with that, and bombers don't stand a chance. And there were other barges around, keep in mind each of them has a bonus to drone damage so they can be quite devastating in groups.
---
not how that works bud
---
Good point.  But, he is the one making the claim that he was treated poorly.  As his former CEO, I can present plenty of evidence that he never was.  However, I would be unable to prove that he *wasn't*.  My directors and I are merely making a counter-claim that his claim is false.  At this point, it would have to be up to him to provide evidence that our claim is wrong.
---
*golf clap*
---
The old apoc model was way better.
---
OK How about I make one, and I get a donation.  I am not expecting any ISK from it, the player who is getting it is donating the ISK to me?
---
nice copy paste without a date.
---
It's a good question, and it's true that in most areas of the game, anyone that thinks they can kill you will almost certainly try. That's just how things are. It's a video game, and one of the goals is to kill other people, just like Call of Duty for example. Think of it as a competition.
---
I have better one, its called servanda's supercap moveop &gt;\_&gt;
---
They do have an input broadcaster tho
---
What you scan will be the wormhole connection, if you jump in and the name is J with a string of characters following, it is a wormhole system you have jumped into (only reachable via wormhole connections). A wormhole connection is just a portal
---
yes
---
OK
---
Atleast they went to heaven lol
---
Come back to us. MCAV is recruiting.
---
well no more that it's just gank bait and that hulk's going to last about 30 seconds.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that if you have voice comms (and even just private messaging) between members, things can get pretty toxic pretty quickly. People can also take things different ways; members can represent conversations differently...
---
Anywho, at the end of the day, if it ain't true it ain't true :)
---
Hope you're having a good one! : )
---
good luck invading delve with the 3 caps you can fit through a wormhole before it collapses.
---
i think 3 is the limit before you run out of mass, at least.
---
Bunch of fucking degens from up country.
---
Isn't this a multiboxer? 
---
I recall seeing a post about them a while back
---
Resub to encourage CCP to keep making Eve better like this!
---
&gt;So your way of playing is correct yet his is not?
---
&gt;I for one would love to some day get my hands on the Eve bible in which all these rules are written down so I can finally see the big picture.
---
its called the patch notes, ccp writes said bible. My way of playing was already snuffed out of it a while ago so im not sure where youre getting me saying my way is "correct".
---
&gt;Cause in my all to simple way Im only seeing you telling a subscriber to stop playing the game.
---
and you're right, cause from what he said he enjoys there are far better options than eve for that.
---
&gt;Which surely will improve the game. Until they shut the servers down because not enough are playing it.
---
its not my job to do marketing for eve, they're free to hire if they want that and god knows almost all the good will they had with me is gone, even if the recent events are building a bit of it back up. And if what's keeping their server populations up is lack of criticism from randos on reddit, the problem is not the randos on reddit.
---
Yes absolutely no response fleets in deklein, absolutely dont come here, we are all krabbing
---
Ye errr, I'm lieing, this post is false, don't believe it and forget I posted it. Forget this guys. Don't mine in high sec :)
---
Fun i guess.as a new player i gave up on eve because of how easy was to not die. 
---
All.of.my my friends are bk on playing now
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriors_(film)
---
I have cycle next target linked to 1, so friggin annoying i get the current overview every time im in dscan window :/
---
I mean, I camped a single system for a couple of hours launching bombs at pods and other small stuff landing on grid with Stargates.
---
Response fleet never really showed up in big numbers, when they did they were always super late. No doubt if they saw me in local, they'd camp the system for me. Since local didn't exist, they'd assume I'd left and leave after some time.
---
I approve the changes, whole-heartedly.
---
Its ok, hes retarded. Just tell him good job and feed him his spod cookie.
---
Is this the cheaper option than going to warhammer 40k?
---
Dotlan appears to be dark as well. Null data all displays messages such as “Everything’s dark…there’s a BLACKOUT!” Ship kills and NPC kills are blank (not 0, but blank) too.
---
I hope it comes back as a fuel hungry Auxiliary Relay Node or something like that. Something that burns at least as much fuel as a maxed out keepstar.
---
Never not upvote a Fraternity Titan kill. Good job and good story.
---
No no no no. You sell the paintjob! That comes with a complimentary Titan model. It’s all about the artistic value of the paint!
---
What bubble are you living in?  So when you roam through ESO and go they A1- how do you like a dozen sub caps chasing and trying to box you in.  Got to say all local docking up is retarded and very inaccurate comment to just fit your narrative.  I’m part of that gang and as soon as we see someone within 10 jumps we’re planning/moving to engage
---
Well I am in an alliance with the biggest standing fleet/Cap umbrella and these drifters/no local has absolutely killed my corp's ratting and mining, ditto voice chat channel.  It is Saturday prime US time and no one is in voice chat.  Rorqs and carriers/supers are selling cheap around here.  
---
During the war I trained up my third Rorq pilot and was looking forward to multi-boxing and chatting with friends, etc.  while I made dank Iskies (100m per hour per Rorq).  Now I have no interest in Roq mining, barely any interest in logging in (haven't played since drifters 'cept checking skill que).
---
Most of my corp mates, when they do join voice chat, are playing other games.  I have ground out several Tier Xs in WoT, even joined Clan for Clan Wars and now chat with them in their voice channel.  My passion for Eve is pretty much zero at the moment.  Not even motivated to do minimum PAPs.  
---
I think CCP's motive is money...preDrifters/No Local, you could readily buy Plex, Injectors, and such from Botters for 50% of CCP's prices (I know someone who plexed his accounts this way).  I expect botter prices to climb to parity with CCP's, essentially forcing players to buy Plex/etc. from CCP.  At that point, CCP will be satisfied...unless of course the loss of players offsets this gain. 
---
For now, my corp mates say...we will wait till this settles down...meanwhile they are not playing Eve and playing other games.
---
Thanks ~~CCP~~ Pearl Abyss
---
I wouldn’t say easier. It took some effort compared to buying a ready fit ship in null and doing anime.
---
Yes I do think so, although if you factor in the machine it’s probably gonna be a no :p going to the attic now to have a look to see if my paints are still useable 🤓
---
What else is there?
---
I'm on vacation next week and moving house the following week, once I get internet I think I will
---
imagine making a three day old account just to spew salt about the blackout
---
they should remove the intel from the ingame UI too   
---
No free intel
---
I was pleasantly surprised myself, the underside is a bit off, but I’m planning to fix that
---
This is my favorite trailer.
---
but what's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
---
Just glad my wife didn’t catch me
---
yea it feels like the real eve so good
---
about the last 30 hours.
---
I mean I'm all for the good lynching, but we can wait till you implement it.
---
What makes sense?
---
&gt;My point is you can't rat on multiple clients. Fighters are too "clicky" for that.
---
as long as you have a normal person's apm boxing a couple supers ratting is quite trivial
---
2:1
---
This
---
I mean, even if what you’re saying is true, it still needed to happen to encourage roaming. So now we’re back to the local change being the reason...
---
Same to you.
---
Hmmm good old eve vibes.
---
Wait you mean I'm going to be hunted by competent goons rather than hunt krabs? Well then...that's....INCONCEIVABLE!
---
Some wives might see it as a Challenge...
---
I think you're missing the points of my post.
---
I agree that a delayed killboard is a good thing. However if it's not done for everyone, large blocs with their greater resources will develop internal tools and have that instant Intel on the defensive side. It'd be an imbalance but a natural one due to human nature.
---
If CCP delays the killmail everyone is impacted in the same way. Large blocs will still have a larger Intel network due to size, but it will mean that they have to utilize that manpower (communication in an MMO) to have better coverage and not rely on CCP doing that job for them.
---
This falls under I want to remove local because it benefits the game and have CCP delay the spoofed Intel to everyone.
---
No thanks, that's worse than it is was before. Just means that the nullblocs get another advantage for constant krabbing and rorq mining under a super umbrella.
---
I think they are relatively new to the server. Good catch
---
Don't be silly.
---
I was being facetious.
---
Corp has gone afk and I'm unable to login due to being on the road. That leaves me looking for info on here
---
so do what everyone else does when they are looking for something - use the search function.
---
Less has to do with "new" and more with that up until lately I haven't had the money to do Omega and thus was more restricted in my skill learning speed and options.
---
I've been in and out of EVE for a few years on trials or few month subs but was only ever in High Sec. I got back on-board more permanently because I really wanted to learn the other experiences offered in different areas of the game.
---
Your fun is wrong.
---
Cool. Although SciFi is a good ship, its a lot better if you have artillery or whatever the minmatar racial weapon is with XLASB, and I later switched to the much more successful for me Osprey Navy Issue (ONI). My current solo pvp style is mainly for kitey passive shield tank with missiles and/or drones. Missiles and drones are where I have the great weapon skills so naturally ONI is a great fit, plus it can do buffer shield tank effectively.
---
This post was an honest accident. My phone fell out of my pocket, when I tried to pick it up with my greasy sausage fingers, it appeared that said attempts to recover the phone had caused me to type this post. There is no way it is possible to earn more in high sec than null......... LMAO
---
So you really think faction mods would of saved them? Absolutely not.. if you're getting dropped on you're dying regardless of fit
---
Man that's really cool, I'd sure uh donate to receive one as well.
---
Yeas, it is a sign of botting when Branch posts as much numbers in MER as Delve with like 1/6th of the player base or was it 1/10th?
---
A lot does indeed have to do with my confidence in actually being able to evade. For now I don't find the risk worth the reward except through the reward of experience however for the time being, real life needs and a limited ship count have me taking the safer route.
---
If the Blackout becomes permanent or prolonged I can take it.
---
what the actual fuck are those fits...
---
It's "new" and it's probably even exciting for a bit of time...
---
So ppl do what they always do and jump and join the worshippers bandwagon
---
With a dozen supers as backup
---
That is not the experience that I made. But nullsec is vast. It definitely sounds more fun where you live. Probably we haven’t met before. Hopefully, we will meet soon.
---
And don’t get me wrong. Running away is sometimes the best course of action to take. I just found it frustrating when *all* the juicy targets run as soon as I poke the nose of my ship out the wormhole.
---
lmao, director of what
---
Iron Crown lul.
---
I dont mind the krabs. 
---
Shit, I crab in W-Space all the time. 
---
Fuck the bots.
---
It is :)
---
Triglavuan  invasion is an expansion, not an event. You don't end expansions. Without the invasions, how will we get the stuff to make the tech II ships? This seems like a stupid decision. Given the drifter bs, ccp isn't known for making intelligent decisions, lately.
---
Would you sell me a sock? I hear you've got a promotion that includes a "misprint" 3D print of a spaceship...
---
seems to happen only when animated portrait-header isn't hidden.
---
tbf supers are so cheap you have a very strong argument for b-types, or even c-types on a nyx now
---
The irony is that high sec is the most dangerous area of space.
---
I remember wgen this game had 50k easily and I was there when we hit that 63k mark that is record till today.
---
fair enough that's probably true
---
doesn't actually make them good at the game tho
---
In most jurisdictions, yes, as long as the banana enthusiasts would take in bananas from anyone.
---
This is why Pachinko parlors only accept ball bearings of a certain size, metallic composition and mass, but if you somehow got them at a junk yard or hardware store they *have* to take it. (And then the Yakuza will break your legs)
---
I've been flying around null this morning and honestly it's been way more fun than I've had in ages.
---
Have active are you guys and are you recruiting? In a FW corp but it's not as active as I'd like. Mostly just want to pvp.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Games Workshop actually lost a court case to this exact argument, so this is why you can only find painted knockoff prints.
---
I play via plex each month. As I am a big casual player in eve due to RL first... So one week ratting like mad for plex and rest 3 weeks destroying ships. 
---
Bcs of this RL things I can not stay subbed for long as I never know when I have to stop playing for longer time.
---
&gt;The only real PvP alliances in null are small and hold little to no territory. 
---
Heck owning sov isn't even that useful for PvP alliances, all it does is lock them down to one static region.
---
Thanks CCCP. Hail Stalin
---
t2 shield fits on krab supers are fairly common even
---
CCP disbanded. No refunds.
---
You mean 1DQ? lol
---
Yes sir, the PvP people's don't care about the adm's. 
---
The ones that do are mostly f1 monkeys not PvP people's.
---
If you balance the fuel costs right, keeping the lights on in a few staging will be affordable to most null entities but doing a region will require so much fuel that it won't happen, tune the fuel tank to last a week too. Raitaru sized tank, single 48h RF cycle... I would think they'd be really good fight drivers / harrassment tool.
---
most of the time, yeah, once you're tackled you're already dead
---
however, I've seen a ratting nyx cyno up and bring in an apostle, refit plates, and go from 10% armor to 60 instantly then start holding with reps
---
many things are possible in eve online. particularly with supercaps it pays to prepare for all possibilities and never give up hope
---
&gt; But you will lose a bit more than you did last week. And that's good, because the only thing that makes the game worth playing is when players interact with each other. In space PVP is a huge part of that. 
---
So much this. This whole game as all about your interactions with other players and not just your corpies on Discord. The legacy local system, created a way for PvE players to 'opt-out' of player interaction in space that was designed around player interaction.
---
I've been crabbing in W-Space for years. Particularly solo running C3 sites. Yes there is always a chance I am going to be rolled into, or people could dunk on me from a connected hole. I have several ships that way, however while it sucks to be blobbed on. I've used the money I made doing that krab to fund ships that I use to go out and prey on others doing the same. 
---
Also just because you get caught by someone ratting doesn't mean you automatically loose. I have several ratting ships with kill marks haha.
---
The real disappointment is that this is only this weekend. I really hope CCP has plans to make this a regular thing. Make entire regions randomly black out like incursions popping up in constellations
---
If the make it permanent I’ll return
---
Oh man!! I can't wait for zkills to be back up and to check out all the carriage!
---
2.3k less people logged in compared to last saturday at the same time really is a big success

I live in a WH and I set my space bar to Dscan. I do it so much that I don't even realize I'm doing it anymore. Hell, I Dscan in HS on my way to trade hubs. I've read some posts and a lot of people are just mortified that they'll have to start using this option. It's really no big deal. It's not like you get electrocuted when ya do it. It's virtually painless. I promise.
---
there was a third fleet with titans in system that wasnt "detected"
---
So I've been around long enough to remember when EVE PvP had meaningful losses. When everyone wasn't absurdly wealthy. People still PvPed back then, they just were more likely to do it with smaller ships. 
---
Piracy for ransoms, as an actual way of making isk, was a thing - because you could tackle a cruiser or something in your Rifter, and the cruiser pilot would be shitting themself at the possibility of losing their ship. And the 5 million isk ransom you would get was actually worth something to you.
---
Right now the economy is a trainwreck. The faucets have been dumping way, way more isk into the economy than anyone has any use for, for years. Production has wildly exceeded destruction year after year to where there are ridiculous surpluses of everything.
---
To fix the economy, the miners and industrialists *need* to slow the fuck down. The ratters need to slow the fuck down. We need to blow up more than we produce for an extended period of time - like a couple years at least. The blackout hopefully will help a little with this.
---
true although the fact that there was a hostile russian fleet with titans in system undetected, could hint of a no local thing
---
Looks like the krabs couldn't go 24 hours without withdrawals
---
Imagine thinking Boson camps are good content
---
No, please don’t make assumptions because most of the time the consistent group I’m referring to never is in a cynic ship, so no.  Yes we sometimes gets a shitter that wants to join us an immediately cynos in a super and kills our fun

I realized as I was writing, FoF identification is an interesting problem however :)

Why not come back for a month to get in on the action while it lasts?
---
I'm hoping for it to atleast last long enough to reshape some of nullsec. Waiting for the dust to settle a little to see the outcome.
---
Nah the day CCP made combat recon immune to dscan basically killed FW farm in medium and large complexes
---
As of Blackout, I still think covert ships are more effective
---
This is your brain on spod
---
&gt; bots CANNOT program 99.9% safety (nor 90% safety) now that local is gone.
---
Without some serious memory encryption (which Eve doesn't have, last I checked) - they absolutely can. This just removed the low barrier of entry for botting programs which in turn ought to curb proliferation by quite a lot. Effectively more sophisticated methods would be required to obtain the same level of relative safety which is kind of what it's all about.
---
Ba dum tiss!
---
I have more than T1 cruisers but am not at a point in my head where I feel the need to risk them.
---
Can replace, just don't see an absolute need if you know what I mean?
---
Undocking, and dying 2 jumps into your attempted roam in a gate camp is lame as fuck.
---
If this blackout is prolonged I just might do that.
---
I am for the changes, but I dont think itll effect null like people think
---
Let them unsub. More than enough people are coming back to make up for a few lost krabs and bots.
---
I found a rorq &amp; 4 hulks just peacefully mining. He never suspected a thing.
---
Reminds me of my first days in wh space, with the added bonus of not even having to drop probes

Wasn't it ori?
---
So what's that spin counter of yours looking like rn?
---
I dont make much isk as is because I dont slave away at sov space combat sites.
---
I came to nullsec to learn how it works. None of this is a salty post. At my alliance's primetime I had great fun in some of our roams.
---
Killboard won't be popular without kill database, you can't get kill database (links/ESI tokens) without getting popular. This is big issue that is very discouraging if you're considering making a competition.
---
Eyyyy
---
I don’t believe they gave a timeframe yet and were going to keep it running till they think they might’ve gotten some effective data. Unless a new post came out stating when it was going to end?
---
You rat in a Nergal?
---

---
dont be too surprised
---
Man make post.
---
Post bad.
---
Man try to make funny.
---
Funny bad.
---
But for real you're comparing 2 hs mining accounts to 1 subcap null ratter? For the cost of your 2 hs miners your null ratter should be in a carrier, at which point youd be making 100m an hour.
---
We really are just small bunch but pretty active, just core no fat. That said if you coming for "action-every-day" you should probably aim a little higher but pm me for our discord or ingame anyways if you like. Kinch Karma is the IGN.
---
Go back to rehab...
---
It was private for 1 hour to help promote the launch of the blackout - something the sub absolutely supports as a whole.
---
1 hour. I think you'll be ok.
---
Dude why are you talking to some NPC?

Never claimed to expect that or need it. This post is simply day one of the blackout for me as someone who wasn't making huge preparation efforts for a variety of reasons.

I know for a fact that Goons have tools that perform the exact functions that have been removed by all of these webmasters. So while everyone else that relies on these tools is in the dark, Goons aren't missing a beat.  If their idea was to put everyone on a level playing field, they have failed miserably. The better option would have been to have CCP remove access

In 60 seconds you can pop a cyno and have a handful of faxes undock and jump to you to keep you alive while buying time for a defense fleet to login and get ready to counter drop.

Only way to play Eve now is in Black Desert as a minigame.
---
You make a lot of valid points. I'm active in my alliance's prime and off time so needing a new group isn't essential but this may be an opportunity to work on an Amarr alt for the faction milita mayhem and the apparent story arc taking place in Amarr and with LUMEN.
---
No, gaining isk has to be a grind, this is the foundation of EVE's economic system
---
&gt;So thats 2 accounts vs 1 account?
---
Yeah I'm going to hazard a guess that OP isn't very smart.
---
Those are Iron Crown fits.
---
It's the bots whose accounts get paid with ingame bought plexes so no loss there.
---
Are you going thru during rus/china peak tz?
---
Highlight yesterday was a pipe bomb that destroyed a provi jackdaw fleet +28. The footage was beautifull. :)
---
I'm not agreeing with the guy you replied to, but WH space is a bad comparison. You're not cynoing anybody into the hole ever.
---
I'm p. annoyed about it
---
I don't know if this is directed at another comment or me but I'll go ahead and say that I'm not operating in a sov holding alliance or corp.
---
Is there spod in hisec? I think he's hopped up on cheap trit.
---
CCP doesnt write the bible, its the players. CCP cant force anyone to do anything. Because you are enforcing your view of how the game should be played "god forbid you have to play the actual game". In that sentence lies a viewpoint that there is only one way to play the actual game. And thats apparently by d-scanning all the time.
---
No its not. But correct me if Im wrong, it really isnt your job to tell people how to play their game either yet you chose to do so. 
---
If a casual player wants to play the game in a way, let him/her.
---
Or, there are not as many true krabs are people think. The player count did drop so I have to assume they are in fact waiting for this to blow over.
---
Less resources devoted to haven sites though
---
You don't need ISK if you don't buy plex ...
---
Rorq mining isnt the question really, if you rorq mine you typically are required to have caps or supers on standby.  I am more talking about orca mining.  Also no its not about being chicken shit its about risk vs reward balance but nice try.
---
hi zesty!
---
Imperial jubilee ofc
---
Kinda. Somebody still had to pay real money for those Plex to get them ingame in the first place. All things being equal, if there are fewer Omega bots plexing, demand will be lower for Plex, ingame price will be lower, and fewer people will buy Plex to turn into isk, and ccp makes less money.
---
Things may not all be equal. Maybe this spikes a return of other players. Maybe not. We'll see.
---
Earl Grey, hot, and then death, please.
---
this will become the next meme like "XY will come, they must come"
---
you just have to believe, tha it comes true
---
Your willingness to adapt and ‘make do’ will take you a long way in this game.  EvE players have a long history of ‘htfu’ and have learned to succeed under changing times.  Plan for the long haul, but enjoy the current.  This game needs more players like yourself, who are willing to try new things and experiment.  Been in EvE since 2005, still love it.
---
One old man to another :thumbs up:
---
So there is only one way to do it? Your way. And fuck everyone elses way. 
---
Seems people have this funny thing about Eve, they think its the actual wild west. But you know, the actual wild west wasnt really even the wild west. Eve has a multitude of playstyles, all are valid. If someone doesnt want to PvP it isnt your job to force them. And alienating all the other styles because of what is actually a minority is fairly.. Well.
---
idk ccp cant detect a dozen supers running 23.5/7 from one account
---
Make it a molok
---
Who should I contract a few suicide roaming ships to
---
Join us. Joiiiiin ussss.
---
Sorry, but Im going to stay in null where I've been playing since 2009, getting pvp ships blown up for the fun of it.
---
 But why would I be stupid enough to put my isk making ships there in a place with no local but that still allows gates and cynos when I can simply use a 300 mil Gila to run T4 exotics in the safety of high sec? PVP ships are for exploding, but isk making ships ain't.
---
Just pointing out how some of us will adapt, sorry if that annoys you.
---
Dscan and aligning frankly isnt enough for most mining vessels.  With cloaks and force recons you're still going to get every time by them, they are just too fast and impossible to detect.  This isnt really about roquals rorquals are designed to be stuck on field and you need to have caps or super caps ready to go or you just really cant use them and honestly thats kinda fine.  Im more talking about like orcas and mining barges.  As well even if wormholes have incoming wormholes it seems that null sec has more incoming wormholes of various types. And any of them can have danger coming in unlike all the wormholes in wormhole space that are active in that system at a time.  Also having an alt on each gate just seems unfeasible or you have to have alot of accounts ( some of us just cant do that.)
---
I always assumed they were just hotdropped in too.
---
Also in order to mine safely it is absolutely FORCING people to go to the safest systems for it, don't be naive, you have to be out for long periods of time to mine efficiently typically and if you are going to get blown up every time that isnt really smart to be mining so you just dont do it.
---
Vanilla White &amp; Gold skin. You just have to. It'll be a gorgeous piece of decor, get a metallic gold paint to make it shiny :D
---
I typed this on my phone while in urgent care. Now that I'm home, google helped me to learn that the Orca gained 176% in shield HP and an extra mid + drone buffs. Helluva lot more EHP than I was banking on but a thrilling fight that neither of us was sure we'd won until the end.
---
I realized I'd turned completely into a carebear at some point so this was my first attempt (on my own) at doing something about it. I defo made mistakes (I forgot to set my default orbit so the bomber was webbed and died too soon and I should have killed the hulk first so I came away with something more than lossmails. I'll be feeding ships again tonight. :)
---
I love the blackout. I hope it's here to stay (which means it's not).
---
Make standard cynos able to fit to special beacon ships and capitals only. Give them a 60s warmup.
---
And what, you are the gatekeeper? Im sorry but your attitude is shitty. 
---
Then how come much of what CCP have been trying to do is exactly the opposite of what you are describing. I mean honestly, you are talking about a game thats been around for almost 2 decades. Things have changed. And sitting and dwelling on what used to be is... Shits changed and its high time alot of the players actually realise this.
---
And Im fairly certain people leaving because of this or that is a myth. People got older man, they got families and other priorities. And this is exactly why you dont put all your eggs in one basket, you dont cater to just one type of gameplay because if they leave, for whatever reason, the game gets fked.

Seriously though I have a tattoo on the wrist. My work around for that is it’s scar beautification. Works like a charm.
---
That's just the thing. There are large amounts of isk because it was easy to extract. The most lucrative space in all of EVE is wormhole space, and yet it's the lowest population part of EVE.
---
We've been here before..
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/those-anomaly-changes-in-full
---
From the above linked 2011 dev blog:
---
&gt; Expected consequences
---
Some alliances will immediately start wanting to look for better space
---
In the longer run, there'll be more conflicts going on, with more localized goals
---
Newer alliances will have an easier time getting a foothold in nullsec
---
Coalitions will be marginally less stable
---
Alliances will have to choose more carefully what space they develop, where their staging systems are, and so on (low truesec systems generally tend to be in strategically inconvenient places)
---
Thought you guys just quit and disbanded....
---
I wanna see some one make a move while under cover of the black out. Even just a small one.
---
You ever consider to, upon hotdropping some poor bastard, yell in local "this is the end of you, s'wit... there is no escape!"
---
Congrats on your new horse cock!
---
Game design. You are talking about a thing that the original devs were thinking. Thats 2 decades ago. Shits changed. If game design intends nullsec to be dangerous then they wouldnt have made it so easy to be kept safe. Sov grind, citadels, asset safety, Rorqs and so on.
---
So original ideas are far from valid today (and havent been for years) and cant be used as a reason for making null even more barren. Which is what will 100% happen with changes like this.
---
I really dont get why people are stuck in this idea that Eve today is what Eve 15 years ago is. And reverting to that will somehow make the game better. It wont. Thats being nostalgic, like old people constantly talking about the "good ole days". Theyre gone.
---
It’s not
---
it amazes me the amount of money CCP leaves on the table.
---
I would purchase that sock
---
Please don’t get me wrong. I’m primarily a FW player for the last decade. I am not suggesting that FW should become a new player only experience. 
---
FW currently is balanced so that frigates and destroyers are the most relevant ships. With some necessary changes to timers, tiers etc FW could be a great place for both new players and experienced players. 
---
Right now I would argue FW isn’t a good place for anyone, since outside of a few systems you will only run into farmers and bots. 
---
If FW was improved to get real players to come back to it, new players could then be recommended to head there while they build up the game knowledge and skills to be able to survive in a much more harsh but rewarding null. That’s how the game should be balanced imo. 
---
But the problem is CCP let null be too safe for too long and now idk if they will be brave enough to disrupt the play style of so many of their players.
---
yes wtf is that?
---
Problem is if its not good isk per hour theres no reason to really do it.  If you can make more easily in high sec then why do it in null?
---
Because I don’t rat afk.
---
Life regret number 2 then
---
Lowsec scumlord is happy to hear it. I am subbed but not really pkaying EVE ATM. This is encouraging to hear though.
---
Because it seems to be enough of a success that it will be permanent.
---
The bigger the ship the greater the risk. They live in null under the safety of local and intel channels along with a standing group ready to drop in and save them. How much more safe can they be? In the regions where you have the biggest rewards you should also have the greatest risk. 
---
Removing local lets players themselves to be that risk, which in turn drives this game.
---
How do you pvp without isk?
---
Cool story.
---
Is there a point or just wanting to talk about fun bot kills?
---
Because no one likes me :c
---
By not dying
---
This will also effect regular miners and ratters as the risk vs. reward ratio now skues to the other end of the spectrum.  They can no longer do the activities without a strong chance of dying and that makes it frankly not worth the effort.
---
Yeah like no one dies doing pvp right?
---
WaNGSPiN does it again
---
Wait is that a Blackbird
---
I love Blackbirds
---
Okay thanks. :)
---
found the goons high command
---
You do realise the isk isnt that great right? People constantly think that multiboxing Rorqs is the standard for NS, its not. In fact, one of the highest payouts in the game atm is abyssal space. An activity that can be done in safety in HS. 
---
So why should people even stay in null? And this is the part that most miss. If the reward/risk ratio is off, null will become even more barren. So would you rather have more harder to get targets or less easier targets? 
---
And my man, PvP is one aspect of the game. Not all of it. Would go so far to say that PvP is only a small part of it considering all the different ways you can play it. But people dont wanna realise this and keep going for that one playstyle thats actually in the minority. Hence the term, vocal minority. In reality, its not the PvPers that keep the lights on, its all the other styles.
---
But they said "jump in" so they weren't there before?
---
No, I think the sentiment about number of crabs is closer to the truth. Look at capital proliferation. That’s doesn’t happen with out  a large number of crabs. I think some are waiting untill it blows over, there’s also a fair number of crabs baiting roaming. I think people are excited about the change or at least willing to change up their play style for a bit. And it’s refreshing tbh
---
So in one sentence you are talking about interactions yet in the next you are talking about how you are a solo player. There are many ways of interacting with players outside of shooting at them. Shame on those who actually prefer these other ways?
---
It’s been one day.....
---
ok i'll just tattoo a ns alliance logo on my forehead
---
&gt; I remember when they added warp to zero. In hindsight, this was (in my opinion) one of the worst changes in Eve history, as it dramatically reduced the scale of the game, and the risk of 0.0.
---
The biggest problem here was that bookmarks exist. Players worked around it using existing game mechanics. That workaround greatly benefited "the locals" and had a severe negative impact on server performance.
---
I don't disagree that it made things less risky. But players trying to bypass it was ruining the game. The performance increase the day they deleted all of the bookmarks around gates was incredible.
---
Yup 3 is the number and that’s for a fresh hole. 
---
Not to mention no supers or Titans.
---
Alright. Thanks!
---
No it was cache
---
I like how it is now, as in not working.
---
good stuff
---
Good old Pantsufan, yet another alliance he's slowly destroying.
---
The problem is that zkillboard causes people to engage in certain gameplay behavior that they would not normally do if the site did not exist, all for the sake of padding their zklill stats. It’s bad for the game.
---
It's a Falcon, AKA the sexier Blackbird.
---
It's about as surprising as Sort backstabbing an ally
---
Image using a tool to discuss shit since no ones online in eve
---
So what is your definition of guerilla warfare? Cause smaller entities are doing jack shit and cant do jack shit against bigger ones. This hasnt changed with no local.
---
Its not about getting caught. Its about what does the small guy do when the titans get dropped on their structures? What guerilla warfare will save them?
---
Who says that? Thats WH living, not NS. And if people wanna risk everything WHs do exist. But ye, you can lose your space and this is the thing man. Most of the people saying bad things about no local do it because of the results. One being that it doesnt fix anything, mainly 1. give people a reason to fight and 2. ensure that people can actually lose their sov. And this is coming from NS people who have been crying about this for years. We want the risk, thats what we signed up for. But not "stupid" risk that will only drive away a lot of people.
---
There are plenty of issues in the game atm, no local fixes none of those. In fact it will make it harder for smaller groups to retain numbers which is sad. I would much rather have 100 small strong groups than 4-5 big groups. The former will create chaos and content while the latter will create stagnation.
---
You put up a great effort, seems like you did some research and took time to share something you are passionate about but mate, I’m sorry it was all for naught because that has got to be the most moronic thing I’ve seen in days. The logic or lack-there-of is clouded by your own wants for a safe space. Take your own bias out of the equation and go back and look and it. It’s Called [NULL](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/null) sec for a reason. It should be high risk.
---
If you want safety go to highsec.
---
yeah from what i've seen so far they're pretty bad thats true
---
or 1.5 bil in 37 mins in a 6/19 or 600 mil in 10/10 37 mins In a typhoon
---
Like... "wth no more free ISK I'm out screw you guys bad"
---
Good riddance xD
---
If you return its more likely to become permanent
---
I think he did it faster this time, than his last 2, guess he is getting better at it.
---
The in-game map can be a useful intel tool at times, especially when looking for cynos. However I can say from personal experience of trying to weaponize that part of the API, that ESI information related to the map is pretty much useless due to the one hour caching time. Even DOTLAN's ratting Deltas which every blops fleet ever uses for intel is bound by this. 
---
I'd also like to say for some of the more extreme suggestions (removing cynos/killing many or all current sources of intel for nullsec) that this change on its own completely turns the meta on its head in ways that will take months if not years to adapt to. Telling CCP to immediately go further in their usual style of 'over-balancing' could easily result in a tipping point for the major null entities. Take your victory, don't get greedy.
---
I think that's an argument for nerfing highsec isk faucets, not making null easier.
---
The game should reward high risk cooperative gameplay.  Anytime someone can lazily grind isk without risk is a problem.  The blackout is a good fix for solo null afk ratting but it's not the only fix needed
---
Eh. I forgot ccp kinda counteracted power projection changes when they changed fatigue again and put in ansiblexes.
---
Well as I said. Ccp is bad about this shit.
---
&gt;So I've been around long enough to remember when EVE PvP had meaningful losses. When everyone wasn't absurdly wealthy. People still PvPed back then, they just were more likely to do it with smaller ships.
---
EvE PvP has never had meaningful losses outside of the first time Supers/Titans were introduced and massive super-cap-battles. Around the time of Cyvok and ASCN. Prior to that everything was pretty easy to get. Before there were battleship NPC's you could farm in certain systems in empire, at some planets, that had a perma-spawn of cruisers. Horaka was one of my favourites. Other than that one time with super/titans for a matter of months/year-ish there were never meaningful losses (Again, outside of the obscene losses like massive super-battles). Your premise is wrong based on this flawed idea that losses mean something. They generally don't to most people.
---
I wonder if this is an experiment CCP is running to see how bad the bot problem is
---
Seen that guy, killed his Charon in an ice belt lol.
---
You fly cheap shit and only PvP when your alliance offers SRP
---
Experience, understanding and critical thought.
---
Null is safe yes because of player police not npc protection.  Thats what the null means no AI saving you. Wormhole space or J space is the true risk space as you cant jump in. If you want true risk take all the jump clones out as the router network cant support. But each there own
---
Bots adapt. They will simply move to empire.
---
How long until your ally can’t afford srp because no one crabs anymore?
---
Begone, Krab
---
Yah that region was insanely bot infested. I actually believe the entire region was botted.
---
pantsufan is one of the most insufferable and clueless twats I ever had the displeasure of having to deal with. He deserves whatever he gets, good luck.
---
Very true. Instas were definitely a problem
---
I surely hope so, but you might be kicking ourself if it doesn't, and you miss out on the crazy fun we're getting at the moment.
---
Welcome to classic eve.
---
You're providing the idea that nullsec is stale, yet this change will do nothing but make it even more stale. More people will move under the super-cap-umbrella alliances. Small corps/alliances will die out. If that is your idea of a good game, then I would suggest its flawed.
---
There are basically 2 philosophies here :
---
1 - fit some tank, refit with cyno/nestor so you can last a little while, works if the enemy fleet is not very big, gives you time to bring in the supercap umbrella
---
2 - accept you have no backup, go t2 hyperspatials, use ascendancy set to push warp speed to 5au/s and avoid the NSA like the plague
---
Warp speed increase also decreases your time in accelerating into warp/deccelerating out of warp. 5AU/s puts you in the same general area as slow-ish frigate.
---
It also makes combat probing for a super a tad harder, not sure what the numbers are on supers but on a carrier you can reduce the sig ratio down to 20-22, which will buy you 1 extra probing cycle of time (maybe more), unless the prober has the mg virtue set (highly  expensive).
---
&gt; The last point is the best outcome IMHO. It will improve these groups numbers and consolidate power within the three main blocks and probably make the game a lot more fun for the titan and super pilots of the big blocks.
---
I don't think thats the intention of this idea, although I could very well be wrong.
---
What disadvantages does NS have? For one, sov grind. Massive fleets, tidi and so on and so forth. NS isnt as fun as people portray them to be and the isk isnt great either. Defending your space takes effort, and if the rewards for defending said space isnt high enough then people wont do it.
---
And ye, that happens in Jita. But a massive amount of HS systems are empty and rarely even jumped into. You can easily run your sites in any of those places where the ganknados wont ever show up. In fact, no one will ever show up. 
---
So how do you convince NS players to not go and do that, the most active and fun PvE in the game that just happens to be super lucrative and instead stick with boring sov grind for a somewhat, in comparison, shitty payout with the joy of having to d-scan and become paranoid?
---
He's just taking the argument to the extreme. You are absolutely right, the bots will be significantly less effective without local. For example, login traps would bypass a bot watching a gate.
---
That's a fair argument and probably one of the only ones ive heard so far.
---
Right in the center. If you do it, I’ll do it. No balls
---
Eh the botting problem in null is massive. My corp has some bot hunters and can say confidentiality 2019 has the most null bots I have ever seen. It's depressing. I hope blackout doesn't leave, and that if the bots adapt through another system that CCP is more aggressive in banning them.
---
Right in the middle. If you do it, I’ll do it. No balls
---
To be it looks like what will be the end result. It's the logical next step to having their cake and eating it.
---
What’s number one?
---
So you cant type great...
---
I was discussing having player owned stargates. This would prevent free trade but in null there is already tools to disrupt or manage jump gates
---
&gt;In the meantime, myself and others are working at convincing CCP to delay all killmails by one hour.
---
From the post you quoted. If CCP delays the killmails and not squizz the problem is solved.
---
/me wonders if this guy misread, or is somehow very young and thinks EVE's been around 36 years...
---
It will be a while. The mega blocs can fly really cheap shit because they have numerical superiority, and their ISK reserves are huge
---
lol
---
Otherwise known as logical falacies.
---
Wow, whoever wrote that document is really skilled and articulate. \*looks around\*
---
I know a guy that runs out of the back alley behind the shell station. Tell him I sent ya, he will hook you up with the medical attention you require. Don’t worry about the new scar on your back either.
---
More false news from biased corporations, always trust in the brotherhood, not this swill!
---
&gt; Less industrial action leads to less output, less output leads to increase in prices
---
Quoting your post - if there's long-term significant activity drop, then nullsec industry will become even more profitable, meaning that taking risk will be related to better reward, and as long as you have friends and you're able to coordinate to keep everyone relatively safe (and accept occasional losses from time to time), it all looks good to me. The only people who'll be in negative due to blackout are people who go to null to play their own solo game and avoid any kind of interaction with others - all kinds of afk ratters, afk miners etc.
---
Yes, I don't think for a second bots won't adapt to be better than they are at this moment.
---
But they'll still be way more vulnerable, and then they can trade vulnerability for worse income.
---
Like docking up anytime another ship is seen on dscan and such.
---
They can only safe themselves so much without local without also regularly getting false flags.
---
Can't be worse then mines. Never was around for them but they sounded like a nightmare
---
Id Honestly disagreed. From my experience avarage human can barely catch a ball thrown at him, juggling balls  requires training, which avarage human beeings cannot be arsed to do nowadays. And half of them are dumb as hell aswell. Props to the girl tho, whoever she is.
---
Sorry man but lol. You have missed the point I was making and are instead spewing out obvious stuff. And Im certain your "small" group is connected to a large enough group to let you keep your shit. Which means u are part of the blue donut. No local will just further enforce this, not the other way around.
---
And your small group getting a few kills more doesnt justify the negative outcome of a change.
---
Precisely
---
Highsec moons have spod.
---
Im assuming you talking about the dude kicking his legs behind the cute chick playing with balls ya?
---
Reading comprehension
---
discovering eve
---
It might or might not be. The point is that you can't tell the difference between a docked bot and a docked risk-averse player.
---
"If youre that much of a pussy" Loooooooooooooooooooooooool. What are you, 15 years old? Is this the schoolyard? Are you the bully? Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
---
Elite PvPers are like jocks. Single minded future bums. Let the big bois handle the big questions matey.
---
Guess that explains why our most reliable content provider hasn't been around lately. how the hell is Frat going to fuel their structures now?
---
someone is welcoming our triangle overlord's.
---
Swapping to plates shouldn't increase current armor percentage anymore. That may have been before that slight nerf to refitting tank modules
---
Living in nullsec isn't suppose to be safe/easy, the system at the minute simply doesn't work. You are safer mining in the middle of delve than you are in high sec. Again there are loads of wormholers that mine in barges no problem, yes a cloaky ship will catch them but a cloaky ship should never appear on local chat anyway, it kind of defeats the objective of cloaking if you have a system telling them you're there anyway. In mining barges when alligning out you can warp as you see someone landing on grid, the alternative is mine in a fleet, this makes it easier to watch gates or have a standing defence fleet up. There's answers to your problems. losing local also helps get rid of botters and afk income. 
---
If you're actively playing then the risk of you being caught only increases slightly especially if you're clever about where you rat/mine, but for those hunting it increases their chance of catching someone significantly because of afkers. If I had to choose between safety of generating isk and generating content in a game that has been lack luster for well over a year due to bots insta docking when a hostile enters system and intel networks so people know you're coming when you're still 10 jumps out ect I would choose content every time.
---
Ironic flair is ironic.
---
All of the in-game map functionality is still present on dotlan, except for sovereignty and fleet location
---
Would you mind posting the story if it goes live successfully (barring identifying details, of course)? I'm thinking of doing the same and would be curious to hear about the experience.
---
No Ragrets
---
I called out Pant’s and his crappy alliance a few months ago - I knew it wouldn’t last long. Good luck fighting against them (you’ll probably be fighting all his allies who he slags off for not helping enough!).
---
That's it mate. I was lucky to have a great time then. After 2012 I was gradually moving away. 
---
After hearing aboit blackout I immediately subbed my main and I'm looking into it.
---
Drink himself to death
---
Literally complaining he can’t safely afk mine and talk with his friends.
---
That’s the cancer that’s killing this game.
---
i like u &lt;3
---
What is :-
---
RLML caracal - (I get that it's a ship but what does the RHML stand for)
---
BCU - ?
---
ShIELD Relay - ?
---
DC - ?
---
Also in easy words you're telling me to get mods that'll increase my health? (why hornets?) then later on when I have skilled up my health affecting skills then I should replace my health mods with DPS Mods?
---
And that Gila is a DED god for escalations but that I should get it later on when I gotten my skills up?
---
And why is GIla god (it's high Health?)?
---
Well they have full shield and armor fleets depending on the need. They jump wings in based on what is tackled and makeup of tackling forces.
---
16 years dude. The same concept has been promoted for 16 fking years. And in the end this game still doesnt have enough subscribers. Which tells me that perhaps, just perhaps, another way might be better.
---
But idk, lets just keep banging our heads on the same wall hoping we get different results.
---
This is quickly turning into the golden age of EVE.
---
As a non-blind PVP player.
---
Dotaln has the best layout for us too. Miss the ingame browser largely because of this....and of course the meme's....r.i.p.
---
dont come to school tomorrow
---
Sounds great fun, kinda tempted to log back for the first time in years.
---
It's "become part of the umbrella" thank you very much.
---
Its a start.
---
Yeah same. Fucking game consumed all my spare time, my wife was so mad at me all the time, almost worth taking the heat for a change this big.
---
Idiotic post + solution...
---
Upventured
---
There are other, better ways to make isk that are rather easy to do and fairly safe.
---
So far i managed to change keyboard... spamming V. I plan to send CCP the invoice
---
That pretty much sums up this subreddits thoughts on bots and turbokrabs  in a nutshell.
---
Brave circlejerk
---
No my man. You are the cancer thats killing the game. With your shitty teenage entitled attitude that thinks your way of playing is the only one. For every one of you there is 4-5 people that isnt like you. And they are what keeps the server going, not you. Your entire playstyle could leave tomorrow and it wouldnt make much difference, just a lot less shitty attitude to go around. But if the other playstyle goes away, the game dies.
---
I know its hard when you grow up and realise your arent as special as your parents told you you were. But thats reality mate. Sorry for having to be the one that has to inform you.
---
you mean the rental 'corps' that regularly out form his entire alliance ?
---
Brb, setting up banana business
---
It’s great, but I feel like we should at least see our own Corp members in local? Not sure.
---
So I guess this is the game now...
---
Please show us on this vni doll where the lokis touched you
---
Not like if you need tank on a ratting super tbh
---
I mean.... They're both Larry David shows 😎😎
---
Lets also move all NS systems 11 au from each other.
---
im really not
---
Not even a single letter?
---
If you get fatigued from pressing one key, you're in way worse shape than the average Eve player, which says a lot
---
I actually don't VNI rat and have mostly just been doing fun responses.
---
The point of supercapital massive tanks is that they last long enough to recieve help, so every bit counts, but my point was who goes and buys a expensive ship then cheaps out
---
Presumably of shitposting. I think you are only a subdirector of that though, Nazalgul has to be the full director.
---
Tuzy, just deploy your own:

Because cynos don't proctect the excavators that double your mining yield.
---
Send em all to lowsec to free them from there misery.
---
Okay so step by step
---
1st- Ship-Caracal
---
    -  4x Scourge Light Missile Experimental SV-2000 Rapid Light           MIssile Launcher, 1x Scourge Light Missile, 1x Experimental SV-2000 Rapid Light Missile Launcher?(you sure there's no spelling mistake?)
---
2nd - 3x  Ballistic Control System I (what does this do? cause according to it's discription on EVE marketer it guides missiles to their target BS cause I thought that missiles don't miss and under attributes it didn't have anything), Damage Control 1 I understand
---
3rd - I don't get the point of Hornets when you jump into a system it shows you all things in it in the overview then why scout? I can understand if it's to find cloaked players (I don't know how their mechanics work) but other than that i'm failing to see their point
---
If you see them, they're doing it wrong.
---
Im confused.
---
Are you agreeing with the blackout, or arguing against it?
---
Link it? That’s a great idea for blackout
---
"You run a medium sized wormhole corp, create daily content for your corp, work your ASS off, and you're the cancer"
---
LOL okay buddy.
---
Go back to afk mining in a rorqual. See you soon.
---
It is pretty annoying that there's no auto-refresh feature on it. Local can stay dead though.
---
Same
---
botters
---
I too enjoy trying to find a hostile, only to learn they pressed ctrl B on the way in and are in the process of safelogging
---
I keep hearing this, does no one know about cov ops cloaks and combat recons?
---
You are safer mining in delve atm because of what you are saying, to mine in a fleet so this doesnt really solve that problem.  Living in Null is indeed not supposed to be safe or easy but utterly difficult is also not good.  Do loads of wormholers actually mine in barges?  Even if they do they still can have better control of their space than in Null sec.  "In mining barges when alligning out you can warp as you see someone landing on grid"  No you can't, and that's my point.  You cannot see cloakies landing on grid.  You are still going to get caught.  It's not slightly more risk of getting caught being active it's ALOT more risk of getting caught.  Don't get me wrong I'm not exactly advocating for local ( though I do and did disagree that that was the solution), but I am specifically bringing back the arguments we had before rorqs and super umbrellas to why living in null was extremely difficult if you wanted to pvp but also not be entirely destitute.  Without locale or some other way of having a chance to not dying whilest doing some money making activities the I wont say solo but lets say more individual players  will have those issues again (assuming they are outside of large blocks).  I would honestly not choose content every time ( though I do like it) mostly because I wouldnt be able to with regards to funds.
---
Amazing how some players got used to it and it's an insignificant part of their game, and others who have been doing it for 3 hours are exhausted and demand change.
---
And that's simply not true at all. 2-3 supers at once in separate sites is VERY doable by 1 person with a little practice. It's kinda tricky at first, but you quickly get used to it.
---
In other news, emergency rooms across the world (mostly Russia and China) are experiencing a surge of incoming addicts going through withdrawal symptoms. More news right after this CPP sponsored commercial break.
---
Just bind dscan to the F key, after a while you'll develop a scanning reflex that you'll find hard to shake.
---
Sure, we are still making the fort, so it'll be a bit
---
Lol nope I live and rat in provi. Not some easy mode null space like the rest of you
---
Do you know if there's a list of EVE ship models somewhere? Did you just get this on Thingiverse or someplace similar?
---
I enjoy my solo hunting, but I'm not a solo player. I solo krab sometimes, other times I'm with 3 or 4 dudes. Just depends on who's online, what our other guys are doing ect. I mean we teamed up with another corp to roam Tenal yesterday about 20 dudes. 
---
I prefer smaller gangs though, and enjoy solo hunting a lot. It's not just about killing ratters either. Believe me, I'd rather find other small gangs, and solo campers to dunk on. As that's where I get the excitement from.
---
Null-Sec is completely designed around PvP. The rewards for PvE in Null are so much higher because of this. If you enjoy PvE and mining, and want to do it in an environment where you are contained and relatively safe. There are places for that, where Concord will try to protect you. It's not 100% guaranteed but it's there. 
---
Local is a legacy system that people have learned how to abuse over the years. I honestly think this is a great way to shake things up, and create new interactions, and allow more people to play the game how they want to play it.
---
If you have a few billion, and fly T1 until you git gud, the net cost per ship after insurance is a joke
---
honestly if youre going to fit like a poor in a ship like that you deserve to die
---
Thingiverse. I found the forum
---
Post yes, but have yet to have a proper look. I’ll see how far I can take this model first though. Have some ideas for a stand and a paint job. After that you know there is gonna be more 😅
---
Too much work, just buy a fleshlight.
---
Praise James!
---
So I've been checking in on Eve again after not playing since...2015? Last played I think shortly after the second round of destroyers came in (Corax, etc), and I think I kinda stopped paying attention after the clone states/skill point extractors. 
---
I guess the question then would be: what's happened since then?
---
Something wrong? I don't really know why you're so trigged by me recommending the guy to do something that isn't taxed or gets him better ISK/hour.
---
It is still fascinating how Panfam still let Skeleton Crew have the mandate of " securing" and ''reconquering " The Spire for months.  I guess it is explaining why it half of the region is still a wasteland  " or in the hand of the rebels force " and why Panfam core members are now force to form hundred of their guys to try to pushing us and other small dudes out of the region, since Patsufan cannot do the fucking job alone.
---
Feels so much better when you put some work into it. A 40 hour buildup does the trick, no blue balls for shure.
---
Assuming it isn't photoshopped/edited.
---
Good shit. And a solo kill at that. Solo kills are pretty rare on AT ships
---
Hope you looted the DCU lol
---
A quick search found [this](https://www.yeggi.com/q/eve+online/).
---
yes i myself am china tz
---
Fuck the weak horde krabs who needed 50+ ships, including titans to blog our small gang. I hope that’s fun for you? You should for sure kick the shitty cynabal pilot who managed to die despite zero need to stay on grid. 
---
Im glad you having fun, and I too am enjoying the blackout, but I fail the see the difference between your quote above, and your gang dunking defenseless covertors and PVE fit VNIs, seems rather similar to me.
---
Please tell me that this was AFK rattlesnake and he just died to drones.

I had a few fights, racked up maybe like 20-30 kills total, ~15 killmarks, had it for two days. Sucks that it died to RNG but better than concord.

yeah not enough to make a difference a single boson still kills a HAC fleet whats even the point of making it take sig into account if it isnt enough of a debuff to not 1 shot a HAC?

I'd rather see the AT ships being used rather than sitting in a hanger. It's like a sports car - letting it sit and collect dust is a shame when it could be out doing awesome shit
---
Absolutely possible to do with local just as well, but attributed to no local. Why haven't you done this before, chicken?
---
Spai
---
how to elite pvp in blackout, oh wait...
---
sent from my iPhone
---
Try that in Delve ;) In my experience response fleets tend to show up before my shields break on a crappy nid. Its one thing to go after small groups, its another to go after the ones everyone hopes the blackout hurts. But lets be honest, Goons are gonna do just fine through this blackout and then people will bitch and moan that we are using it to our advantage.
---
How can you not even mention the absolute worst part, the capital stasis rigs? They could have been t2, and would still be worthless
---
&gt; who goes and buys a expensive ship then cheaps out
---
why ever fit more than necessary to do the job you want it to? if its the case here is another matter but the idea of fitting supers extremely expensive unnecessarily is pretty bizarre
---
Nice nice!! Can’t wait to get started
---
This has already been said somewhere probably but:
---
Delay Killmails by 1-2 Hours and only tag kills by Region and not specific systems maybe? (if you can do that)
---
Just another thought.
---
GJ for making the Blackout a bit more entertaining though Squizz
---
man that sucks, wrecking shots are a terrible mechanic really wish they would do away with that crap
---
ok
---
I think the real WTF is "Die faq"
---
Another kill from the blackout. Thanks CCP!
---
Krabs occasionally go hunting.
---
Hunters need to occasionally krab.
---
The difference is that for a krab, the biggest part of their gameplay is PvE. They PvP to be able to PvE (paps, safety etc). 
---
For a PvPer, they krab just to fund more PvP.
---
The krabs who just want to do the minimum amount of PvP are the ones threatening to quit.
---
idk, I do isk making in lowsec, and the d-scan is actualy a part that I like for keeping me engaged.
---
I was about to solokill him :P He was in hull and I burned in for multi. The Wasps trailing behind me said no.
---
Nullsec should never have been safe, mitigating the danger is possible with an organised defence fleet. Delve is still business as usual
---
Lol, yes. You dont even live in NS yet you want to dictate how we should live. And your medium sized wh doesnt mean shit man. Sorry but no. 
---
I dont even mine dude and I get that this might be hard to comprehend but some people dont have to be affected negatively to speak out against stupid things. They can even be affected in a positive way yet still point out its issues.
---
But, no matter our discourse here. Nice work on creating content and kudos for doing so. I wish the game had more like you, but without the attitude. And if its a choice between keeping your attitude and creating content I would much rather have less content.
---
I make money by dying in ships :3
---
Yeah I would have preferred dying in a fight, even with a web loki or some bait stuff. PvP, not rng. But shit happens... I don't like being too careful with my ships. I always warped in my Officer Battleships into everything and will continue to do so.
---
But if I get another Imp I will stay away from Wasps from now on lol
---
I mean most people don't dual box them, so take that as you will.
---
...So....2 perfectly fit ships makes more money than 1 ibis with a civilian gatling cannon?
---
I think it was mainly a way to try and make nullsec exciting/dangerous again but this is an added bonus !
---
&gt; poorfits that suggest the people involved had no experience in pvp and were cutting corners to make more isk
---
pvp experience in a ratting super is irrelevant, if your ratting super is engaging in pvp in the first place its either dead or a cyno will save you, and given its iron crown i doubt they were expecting a cyno to save them. Also why would you ever not cut corners to make more isk in your isk making machine?
---
Stop reminding me .  . .
---
It's getting too easy to tell who the botters are on this sub, stop posting, no free intel.
---
Heh, brain-dead ratter
---
I mean, we let skeleton screw deal with you guys is because we in PanFam had bigger fish to fry.
---
lol no
---
....what?
---
You really skip a whole lot of logic here.
---
Many have remarked they left wormholes and it was a factor. Spamming a key is not good gameplay, it isn't for wormholes or null. Lore wise, if my ship has an AI then this should be an option to auto-ping by default.
---
Acceptance, insignificance, whatever is a sign of Munchausen Syndrome. It doesn't make it good gameplay.
---
Wormhole a cyno in, then bridge everyone in.
---
Well, you don't need the wormhole to fit a bunch of caps, just a cyno.
---
This is a pretty stock response for someone with cloaksburgis, someone who's deathly afraid of any changes to cloaking devices. There's no cure I'm afraid besides accepting being in danger while cloaked, unless you're down with a lobotomy.
---
(https://youtube.com/wtevh7q2q5E) [Someone out there feels the same]
---
This isn't disinfo sir, there are no wormholes.
---
Oh god Pantsufan is trying again? i was on one of his boats before. it sunk
---
1 hour is nothing. 5 hours!
---
Just use the 3d printed model for a mold and cast it.
---
Respect for flying it in PvP o7
---
Lore wise if your ship has AI you shouldn't have to do anything. That also doesn't make it a good mechanic. If someone left wspace because of pressing a key, they shouldn't be there anyways.
---
I recommend not starting with this.
---
You should work your way up through sizes slowly or you risk hemmorhoids. Gotta make sure your body has time to adapt.
---
Also, drink lots of water.
---
I D-scan my desktop often, soon you will to.
---
I don't get it? You tried to go after the rattle solo and he just one-shotted you?
---
Looking forward to monday to see how many I got in total. Was a few good fights, some solo, some with a good friend
---
Yeah those allies. Why you keep turning up to save Pants's ass all the time I've no idea.
---
My joy is building the cnc :)
---
you can see your corp members in corp.
---
How do I get my alliance to show up next to my name when I post something?
---
Wreckshot is a terrible mecanic, F
---
No, you're high.
---
Fair enough lol
---
Yes it is. Looking forward to monday to check out his fit.
---
tough one to explain to the grandkids in 50 years
---
"theres a lot of hostiles in local"  ..  so no
---
Or maybe just stop ratting for once and go blow up some nerds this weekend?
---
I see those rattlesnake bots are getting better.
---
If they're so good, why do you find coming on reddit to sperg more entertaining?
---
one of my favorite part about being a goon "Hey my I'm tackled by a fleet of frigates cynos lit" 5 supers pop on grid and annihilate anything and everything, good times.
---
Pvp imp bots as well
---
I'm not convinced Star Citizen is even a game.
---
This fucking guy. He’s a perennial whiner over on the star citizen subreddit too.
---
I bought a Paladin/Rev/Nightmare pilot.
---
About 3 months later I joined a corporation on my main, and then decided to bring that pilot with me.
---
The main of the person I bought it from was in that corporation.
---
I admire your playstyle and wish I did more of it myself.
---
But the thing that most miss about NS is the fact that its a lot of work. Lots of fleets (mostly boring) and a lot of rules and regulations and so on (not to mention the lack of content when you live in deep null). But most do it because of the occasional GFs and the rewards. But if you change the dynamics, the ratio between risk/chore/reward, which this does, people will opt out.
---
This will hurt the game as a whole and honestly, looking at the player count, this is already showing. Its only been 2 days so nothing even close to definitive can be said yet. But check the last months log on numbers and you will see that its currently 10% ish less people on today in comparison to the last 4 saturdays. And this even tho alot of people have been talking about renewing subscriptions and such which tells me that the actual number of every day players that have chosen not to play is far higher than 10%.
---
The game wont get better with less players. This is my main point. We need more, many many more. And NS has been hit with constant nerfs these last 6 months and it doesnt really need another one and one this drastic on top of it. What is however needed is 1: a reason to fight and 2: mechanics that allow for smoother war waging. 
---
If this is done and people have to spread out more in general, people become vulnerable and it opens up for more targets. This is a gain for all playstyles but no local only affects one minority playstyle in a positive manner yet punishes a larger group of players. 
---
That simply isnt a net gain for the game. Which the numbers, albeit not close to definitive, are already showing.
---
 nice :) just thinking face down should work too. maybe even with 0.2 layerheight
---
Described me perfectly minus the ISK, it's a lot lower than that, and I never used snakes. Prefer to fly cheap for more fun.
---
where's my life sized Moa,  ordered it 3 weeks ago!!!
---
Yup, save the bling for huge fights.
---
What logical fallacies have I made? Rather than worthless comments, actually target an aspect of what I've said.  I mean, looking at your flair I could make the assumption that your play-style benefits from this change, making your point here worthless, but I won't do that.
---
Blow me you fuck.
---
You're a bitch.
---
Waaaahh
---
Doh, I uhh, had you confused with someone else lol.
---
What will happen is that the super-umbrellas will eat up pretty much every other group of null-sec player, resulting in even more stagnation and lack of content. This change will not do anything other than give a few days of content before it becomes quite apparent it just doesn't work to spice things up.
---
Mad props to you for flying it like that mate. If I owned an AT frigate I would definitely not engage a faction battleship with it.
---
I'll save everyone time reading the comments:
---
1) krabs are shitters
---
2) fits suck
---
3) lol poors
---
This toxicity has been provided courtesy of /r/eve
---
You know what was stale? The broken ass shit null sec has been operating under for a while.
---
Just imagine that dscan fatigue combined with the high apm of carrier ratting. You’ll have RSI in no time.
---
Damned Brotherhood did a better job than Skeleton Crew though and they are merely one corp, fuel with willpower and determination.  Take care of your backyard meatshield Panfam, some of them are precious, other need to be pull out like garbage bags.
---
As a fellow bitter-vet from 03, your opinion is short-sighted at best. Remember the whole BoB/ATUK stagnation fest that happened quite a few years ago, that will be nothing compared to what will happen if a local-blackout continues long term. Nullsec will turn into a super-alliance only zone with massive capital umbrellas that make killing anything bigger than a battleship impossible. 
---
It might feel exciting now, it won't be if it continues for a long time.
---
Ah, the days when you could covert cloak a titan.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ti9-p08LaA

More like your posts give off that needy edgy “look at me” vibe
---
&gt; The real disappointment is that this is only this weekend
---
I think you misheard. They gave a 48 hour warning that the blackout was beginning, not that the blackout would be in place for 48 hours. Their rough timeframe was "through the end of the month and then we'll re-evaluate"
---
D-scan should already be refined, due to wormholers needing it. As it is, it's woefully lacking in basic functionality such as proper filtering. I expect more from a critical game mechanic, and so should you.
---
Iron Clown?
---
Most Brave pilots still don't know what local is.
---
You have to take regional gates many times due to jump range limitations. No regional gates, many regions are now permanently closed to supers.
---
How do I get in in this? It'll be fun watching him kill an alliance for the 13th time, but it would be even more fun to help him along in that endeavor. He is such a clueless moron, it blows my mind that people follow him.
---
Bridge in a bunch of subcaps who immediately eat shit to a boson.
---
You really can’t compare isk you make doing pve in highsec to the isk you make doing pve in null.  They aren’t even close.  And yet for the past few years, people in null have been pulling in huge amounts of isk in null, with very low risk.  CCP has finally added some risk back to match the immense rewards.
---
Null can still reap great rewards, you just have to work together.  Groups can make space safer (it should never have been safe).  It’s actually why I prefer wormhole life, it’s all about working together.
---
He went frig against battleship, lmao, what an excuse
---
I would actually like if the personal stats would be removed. And RIP your karma.
---
I already pointed it out.
---
You make statements without support other than what you THINK.
---
But, as we all know, what anyone THINKS is basically never true, because brains super suck.
---
If you want more specific, you said "risk adverse" when you meant "risk averse".
---
Further proof brains suck.
---
It's extremely powerful and versatile. You can select what you want to show up, have presets, select range, direction, area. I'm not sure what you want in terms of being more "refined." Not knowing how to use it doesn't mean it's not good.
---
Why assume
---
Not really..
---
Looks like League of Legends character. MOBAs during blackout?
---
Really? Which ones?
---
They all look pretty damn jumbled together.
---
\&gt;:D
---
Just bridge in Titans then.
---
Then boson eachother.
---
lol this was me when I played. Looks like I'm not welcome back. I would spend most of my time solo PVE and exploring and just abused the local mechanics. If you are careful you really can just not die ever, it was pretty broken tbh. I can see why this change is good but it would still just make the game less enjoyable to me.
---
Na we good
---
....Well...where have you been?
---
It's one of the ongoing mysteries of EVE that, after all these years of disasters, made public, attributed directly to him, people *still* join any organisation he has any influence in.
---
Negative, it's null my dude. The nullbears will find a way to make it risk averse.
---
You're thinking about it all wrong man.
---
If you try to limit something with a farmable resource, it's going to be exploited *capitals*. 
---
And who is going to exploit it? Nullblocs.
---
Just take it away.
---
its not exclusively brave
---
on desktop, on the right side there is a subreddit info section, and it will have an edit button where you can edit your flair.
---
that would be more like 2014 or 2013. in 2015, the t3 destroyers were coming out.
---
Do them in highsec?
---
Ah maybe I do. Where is the option to filter your fleet members. I missed it. Auto-ping option? Distinguish between enemy fleets via standings? I am aware of the "use overview settings" bandaid.
---
I remember a particularly glorious day when I took 4, 3 of them at work and thus paid for.
---
Good times, good times.
---
They have some of the coolest ship models in Sci-fi.  My work desk would be covered in them.  I'd make a mobile like the tac grid and hang frigates around it.
---
&gt; If I walk around IRL I don't feel the urge to kill every passer-by when no police is around. So why would I behave like that ingame?
---
Because that's the point of the game.
---
Oh you're asking for perfect Intel, that's different entirely. It's a feature not a bug. God forbid there's any risk or uncertainty in anything
---
You have never been on a move op?
---
&gt;I called out Pant’s and his crappy alliance
---
But you repeat yourself
---
You may want to tell whoever you get your information from to consider a career in cranially-sourced fertilizer. After all, they've got shit for brains.
---
Ummm...troll detected.
---
The enigma here is that people *keep on* dealing with him. *Why?*
---
Nah, there are lots of pvp happening.
---
It is until you play games in german and you have to read three times as many letters for the same word.
---
There's always money in the banana stand.
---
&gt;PvP are the ones threatening to quit.
---
So we switched from it hurting krabs to it hurting pvpers
---
It'll still never be fun, so don't forget that.
---
No? Try reading the entire thing if your brain allows it.
---
Under a rock I believe.
---
Model paints used to go bad so quickly,  hell half of them were bad on the shelf
---
The lachesis i guess, wierd penis but why not. They all look like penises btw
---
The change is just a day old.
---
So it's hard to really know for sure.
---
Remember also that now you can't know if there is any prey nearby.

But hey, you aren't a director, doesn't make you any less stupid.

You press the button.

Hacking. 
---
There could be a hacking minigame to unlock a gate 
---
The backside is that the alert goes out gate X Beeing hacked.  
---
Even gate guns could act as an deterrent.
---
imagine being in unspoken alliance and actually thinking these things
---
Are you sure it's only this weekend?
---
&gt;  It kinda doesn't make sense for me that it couldn't be automated.
---
Well, from a game design perspective, automating it increases safety for no cost.
---
And from a anti-botting perspective, you automating it yourself is against the EULA.
---
More sites for PvP player alts then
---
Because, while he is an idiot, he still is a *usefull* idiot you can throw at people harassing your renters. He might not be competent or do terribly well, but it is enough to keep the renters happy and the elite-pvp-smallgang entities busy so you don't have to deal with them yourself.
---
Now that you've started, you essentially have no choice but to finish the sleeve.

You saying some shithole of a country still does that?

its a crown, but made of iron.

There wont be crabs, but there will be other gangs to fight. Which is good I assume.

---
Deadlock in it's finest
---
&gt; I remember when they added warp to zero. In hindsight, this was (in my opinion) one of the worst changes in Eve history
---
Adding warp to zero and getting rid of the absolute cancer that was insta bookmarks was probably the best thing they did for player retention in EVE's history. I'm actually convinced the game would have died by now of they hadn't taken that out.
---
Sorry, I lost it to a gatecamp in Germany :/
---
True, they don’t look to bad, but I gotta get some sprays and some filler :)
---
Better yet: do it in a destroyer. Just need a few more hours of training, small isn't going to have the stupid bullshit of a Comet showing up with the damage of five turrets at Gallente Frigate V or a pirate frigate with two turrets doing the damage of six.
---
Awsome. Thanks :)
---
its like saying "I never learned to use this crutch".

---
Here's how I printed a few of mine. If you don't plan on using filler to smooth out the lines they will kind of stand out as the back has a different pattern.
---
Lol, judging by these fits and what you have told us these could have been caught any day of the week. Log off traps, which you have used, isnt new and was working waaaaaaaaaay before this. Hasnt got much to do with no local.
---
So the real question here is, why didnt u catch them last week?
---
- Hey, you're decloaked.
---
- Hell yes I am, so you know how much I paid for this skin!?
---
Wingspan comms
---
Nat 20 and 20 to confirm the crit. F.
---
What would that matter?
---
Move ops using gates isn't the same as NEEDING to use gates.
---
Many gates are definitely cost effective to use, like the one from fountain to deklein (I tihnk?) that jumps all the way over Outer Ring.
---
You could take multiple cyno jumps through OR, but you can also just take the region gate.
---
So, maybe be more specific.
---
Thanks :)
---
Praise Him!
---
You think the Rattlesnake just snuck up on that Imp?
---
Kinda, yeah.
---
It's Theran Alliance... So probably
---
those were not ratting fits my dude. 
---
a full ratting fit nyx has better damage, an istab and a faction 500mn mwd for faster warping, drone navs for fighter speed, faction tracking mods, etc. - I flew one for a while when we were in a nullbloc. 
---
3x faction DDAs, two plates, two EANMS, trimarks, and a cyno is what you fit for a pvp super that you use for ratting in Theta. all of them being t2 except the faction DDAs and t1 trimarks is what you do when you're poor and ignorant. 
---
on the other hand the chance that I'm getting baited by a memelord is pretty high so...
---
I'm a wormholer (btw), what do you think needs to be refined by D-Scan?  From my viewpoint, it serves its function perfectly well.
---
Lol fair enough, care to elaborate?
---
what is ls?
---
can it be mined?
---
zKill has been working fine through the private link provided to us for premium service, so there was no way for us to know without visiting reddit.
---
This made me laugh way to hard.
---
This kind of kumbaya thinking won't get you anywhere.
---
Eve is what you make of it especially low sec. Yes it does need some loving regarding CCP side regarding FW missions and how how the LP is made and all that jazz.
---
For getting fights it’s very easy but at the same time you must have knowledge above and beyond the the scope of the f1 monkey ie
---
Looking at zkillboard (when it’s up) what area/s you going to be in and who killing who the last hour
---
Knowing who the  cyno baits are
---
Having a good understanding of what ships do and how they’re normally fit
---
Knowing tricks,baiting, talking in local! 
---
Last but most important don’t ever be risk adverse fire in and get wet! 
---
So I do think low sec does have a separate pvp platform than the rest. You just have to put a lot of personal effort into it rather than relying on a ping on discord then login.
---
You can sit in a plex and make big bucks doing nothing but warping out when someone zips in. The risk is basically non-existent. In faction warfare at least.
---
Low sec, yeah you can mine it, not sure why you would, you get barely more isk than HS, and substantially less than null/wh
---
Sov is a political landscape and no we have no blues however using batphones to your interest because one block hates another block is well played lol. Only negative out come is people being scared because they can’t see free intel in which case they should probably not be in null anyways. Positive outcome is bots don’t fuck the markets because they can be easily hunted and shut down. 
---
We have had to fight several large groups to keep our shit, But again null is not designed for 10-15 man groups to hold sov and probably never will be there’s small alliances then there are groups that are barely big enough to be a corporation. You are arguing for groups that simply can not function in the environment that was never designed for them in the first place however small alliances can definitely thrive if they pick their battles correctly and play the games that keep them alive.
---
You're the one who thinks that PANIC matters. It's the cynos, genius.
---
As far as I know joint BB-Test Goku fleets happend at least twice. Here RR was the target. RR, renters of Sort, who is currently supported by Goons. Very much not PanFam aligned.
---
That's exactly what you should do with it though, because you would totally either win or be able to disengage 99% of the time. This was just bad luck, by the looks of it.
---
/u/ccp_falcon PLEASE don't turn local back on
---
Yes you are right, but normaly a camper needs to sit for some weeks in system till people start ratting.  
---
Furthermore its not sure if they would have rat with supers with a camper in local.  
---
So yeah they could have been caught with local too ... but no local made all way easier.
---
He's in TEST so if he does that daddy Dran is gonna come smack him for insolence
---
That makes sense. I suppose there is a VERY good chance my knowledge is lacking. In my short stint in FW, I found most people warped out as soon as I landed on grid, or I would sit in a plex waiting for someone to come kill me and no one showing. My guess is I just had no idea wtf I was doing lol.
---
No one is talking about 10-15 groups. Im talking about upwards of 1k groups. Ive seen plenty of those go under  due to external pressure. This will not help them.
---
So pretty much exactly how it was before now, except the folks not paying attention properly are at a disadvantage?
---
YIKES...
---
Good corps have their own killboard :)
---
You can resub from your phone.
---
That was my problem, I would sit in a plex and no one came, or I would hit a plex with someone in it and they'd bail. Maybe I misunderstood when I joined FW thinking it was going to be pvp intensive with lots of fights to be had. Most the fights I did get where pirates and come to think of it can't think of a time I ever actually fought another FW player.
---
You are right i just brought wormhole as comparison because there is no local too.  
---
What i wanted to say was more that they would have to prepare themself more like people in wormhole do.  
---
Without scouts and acting like they did ... even a fleet of 50 men could have been next door and kill them without cynos.
---
Even then: Locators only tell you the position at the time you started the search
---
RIP Ironbank botters
---
I'm so with you.  Dusting off my account.  This solo pirates going to roam the void once more.
---
Krabs and hunters are the same people. Lol no?
---
Hardly anyone on eve hunts.
---
If by blob and f1 you mean hunt then ok maybe.
---
No, lol. If you want protection, coordinate it properly instead of relying on local.
---
Create a GMacro that clicks your Dscan button once every 2 seconds and put it on a toggle on/off, then just turn it on when you start ratting and providing your dscan button is bound to something thats not gona generate a keybord character(text input) and is not bound to something else, you can fire it off and forget about it, noise is a bitch tho.
---
I read your entire post and unless I missed it you don’t suggest a single change that would help move lowsec in the right direction. In that case, why the fuck post in the first place?
---
Maybe just don’t be shit?  There’s a huge amount you can do with d scan, if you are only now learning how to use it, that’s on you freindo. So errrr what is it I always see on here... oh ye, adapt
---
lmao
---
That's true, but rolling locators can give a very accurate idea of where they are heading, letting your recon dudes intercept them. Especially since you (hopefully) have an idea of what their objective is.
---
Dude, weeks? This isnt 2013. 
---
And campers in local is a part of NS day to day living. Tons of people continue doing their own thing and sometimes get wiped hard because of it. 
---
On that I can agree. It made it slighty easier, but not by that much. So if all it required was a bit more effort to kill the second most expensive hull type in the game...
---
Working as intended.
---
Lol. I’m surprised people have stayed in his shit alliance this long. In small fleet fights pants is always the first person to warp off, and let the rest of his fleet die while he hides in a citadel, yelling at his fleet for dying 😂😂
---
Lol then you are wrong because we are about 80 active players doing our best to stay alive which is exactly what Null Sec is... what you dream of will not happen because of exactly what you want which is safety. If a big group wants you gone then you will be gone nothing will ever stop that.... that’s called getting your ass kicked lol. Local being gone at least makes it less safe for bigger groups as well because they have so much space and without free intel make it harder to track people coming in and out. Having smaller amounts of space at least make it easier for groups to track what’s moving through.
---
I remember when chemling a super was worth it because it was such a rare ship....
---
to reply several times :P
---
I guess I was kinda hoping those closer to LS would have better ideas than me? Honestly I don't know other than altering FW to be more PvP focused, with less reward for mindlessly farming plex and more for fighting, maybe add some extra reward to missions, mining, etc in LS, something to pull people in. I just figured since everyone's bitching and moaning about how bad/great the blackout is we could have a discussion about ANYTHING else lol
---
Adapt, in wormholes we cover the connections. In null sec all you gotta do is make sure there’s no wormholes and watch the gates. You’re susceptible to people logging in, but you don’t need to spam watch. Even in WHs we don’t have people logging off in systems trying to catch crabs. Just don’t do it in overused ratting space or you will have people logging off
---
Not gonna lie, it really happened. But have you seen that Raata Sunset Manticore?!
---
They don't matter either. You can have inhib up before the dumbasses even realize you are there now.
---
Mein Gehirn erlitt eine Menge Gesamtschaden als ich das gelesen habe.
---
Hi jib
---
so are you just choosing to ignore the 15 or 20 nyxs that have died, the imp that has died, the 3 or 4 ragnaroks that have died?
---
Made me grin at least :)
---
i re-subbed two of my main accounts, just so i could be "there".
---
Although i barely have any time to play games lately.
---
Long live the new null-sec.
---
&gt;Even in WHs we don’t have people logging off in systems trying to catch crabs
---
Errrr... Yeah we do...
---
This is acceptable bait.
---
Not terrible, not great.
---
I rate 4/8.
---
Love your vids
---
Good corps don't care about killboards.
---
They're almost certainly botting in high sec instead.  Weewoo?
---
Not going to lie... if this whole no-local thing continues indefinitely (as in not a few week thing) i may consider rejoining this game.
---
Ive stayed subbed, but havent played in 5+ years now.  
---
How are Amarr ships at the moment for pvp? Ive got a up to t3 cruisers in minmatar as well.
---
“ur gay owned” in triangle ?
---
The numbers Mason! What do they mean?
---
Why does everyone suck the Curse's golden dong... its a neuty bastard but easily countered if it's solo.
---
It's content.
---
2 bil for rigs is nothing
---
You were talking about how null isnt designed for 10-15 groups. 80 active players makes you far bigger than a small group and it allows you to defend yourself. Thats about what, an 800 player corp/alliance. Which is fairly big.
---
You get that I dont really have a horse in this race right? I dont want safety, quite the contrary. But causing 10% of the player base to not log on, albeit nothing definitive since its too soon to say such things, its good for the game. That means that the game died 10% just because of this change.
---
If youre okey with that then.
---
AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH
---
This dude really is like a small African dictator just going from one little country to another.
---
You can't predict the meta of no local null, don't pretend like you can.
---
I'm sure that's going to be the case everywhere.
---
elite pvp
---
They've changed the refit mechanics since then
---
Lol Horde awoxing NC caps, how times change
---
They will have google glass auto translat
---
Station kinda makes sense. Really surprised by placing command centers!
---
I assume you have sources for this? I mean, we all knew there would be an increase in deaths to begin with. It will diminish as people adapt. It's eve.
---
I would say the contents of in-game killmails should be delayed by 24 hours i.e you can see you have a killmail but cannot access it until 24 hours later.
---
wow good post man thanks for your contribution hahahahahaha really great content very creative hahahhaha
---
Isk is fine. Real money is not.
---
Most Poilice departments will refuse applicants with sleeve tattoos.
---
I  still have some in my Hangar
---
In which shithole of a country?
---
It's been the meta since 2003, people grouping up to get safety, increased risk means increased grouping.
---
reject convo, solved
---
spam happening
---
They're partially the same thing... If the they're monitoring the cluster and it's population drops and never rebounds they'll do something about it 😁
---
Can confirm, currently afk mining in 17 rorqs with augmented drones in test space, no excas, no worries.
---
If you get bosoned in HACs your fc is shit and should get his keys taken away
---
I wounder if they could ever find a way to read them.
---
Smart
---
I'm pretty sure this is the sign of the end times.
---
low sec is pretty fine living, it is gray zone bit still fine.
---
It's a date of birth. DDMMYYYY
---
Typo btw
---
Ha, I wasn't much use for Tim back then, I was only around for a couple months before I had to quit for RL reasons. But if I come back again, I'll hit you guys up. Did r3d fire join MCAV?
---
We have 500 characters most inactive but we keep if they want to come back someday. Also compared to numbers we see from the blocks we are absolutely small 80 active doesn’t mean 80 all at 1 time that’s people logging in and out all the way from EU to AU tz. The biggest fleet we normally can get in our strongest tz is 30-40 and that’s only for Defense if assets. Otherwise normal pvp fleets for roaming blops etc are about 5-15 depending on weekday or weekend. 
---
 And just because some people didn’t log in the first weekend of it doesn’t mean it will stay that way? It’s either adapt or die? Also who knows what percentage of that are bots as well that decided to try to let it blow over or people simply protesting because they are cowards? The only way the statistics will become accurate are over a decent time period and if the event doesn’t last long enough then it won’t effectively show what the change would actually cause.
---
Why would I want to hurt my own returns by telling you that?
---
I've been working too much to hunt, but for the hour or so I was logged in last night the solo PvP channels I'm in were lighting up with killmails. Miners, ratters, other hunters. Lot of kills going on. Obviously, blackout has only been going on for 2 days so it remains to be seen how the community will adapt long-term, but I am optimistic.
---
Read my post again m8'er.
---
Both fit in the definition of a shithole.

Payback for NC. treatment of Horde in HED-GP days. The beans get their revenge.
---
Can confirm I have abandoned my Krabbing ways and have developed a taste for blood.
---
Why do you think delays would be useful?
---
Disappointing that I can't check to see who collected the bounties I've placed.
---
lol @ the farewell essay obviously written by struggling Americans!
---
oh my dude
---
Fuck
---
On the third hand, it will be way harder for Snuff and other big boys to find parties and crash them
---
Delays on that intel are fine but I think it serves a vital function too. Without *some* intel, we hunters will either just be wandering aimlessly, failing to find any targets; or otherwise concentrating into a few "thunderdome" systems, so that we can know we will at least find someone there to shoot at. Maybe really well connected PvPers can make up for these intel sources with player chat channels, but solo and small group PvPers rely on them.
---
There's a balance to be struck between too much intel and not enough. Its ok to tweak that balance but we do need *some* tools.
---
Wormhole and BLOPS are fine. CCP really needs to look into interdiction nullification on all ships in general. 
---
I think a fair balance could be found in interdiction nullification only countering  launched bubbles from interdictors and heavy interdictors. Leaving anchored bubbles to prevent all warping.
---
I remember purchasing region packs.
---
I've played on and off for years and gatecamps led to far more fights than chasing bombers around, entosis frigates, or interceptor roams.
---
You guys keep your hopes up. I think you'll be disappointed though. I'm pretty sure Hilmar made it clear they were willing to follow through
---
But a gang of HFIs? Thats worth probing. And yet...
---
Or some kind of extra small focussed bubble
---
I did both, as always.
---
I really want CCP to implement a proper in screen HUD radar system
---
They were amazing! I don't know who you were talking to, LoL
---
To my knowledge, they're Fraternity's renter group. Or functionally similar to that. There's a good chunk of Frat. territory that has Iron Crown IHubs and ratters in it.
---
My hope is they keep the blackout forever... But I expect CCP will roll it back through the use of structures... My hope in that case is that at the very least they make is strictly limited to Speed of Light transmission. So systems have a fixed delay based on their size, probably with a multiplier based on the structure type
---
Which is why I say its nothing definitive. But everyone seems to think that no local means that its always going to be the same amount of content like these 2 days aswell which also falls in under the same category of not being definitive. One cant say, we are seeing much more content so keep this up yet say the statistics dont matter because its too short of a time. Its too early to say anything at all but its not stopping the pro no local to speak out.
---
But, its also too big of a drop to be random. Its at around 15% now, a couple of percent is always due to variance but if it becomes too high then its not random anymore. Then its directly linked to no local. If you wait too long those people might never come back. 
---
And sure bots and everything but this is bigger than them. And we are not even taking into account the amount that have subscribed to be a part of this event. Without them, and they will leave soon again I promise, the drop is even bigger.
---
Toxicity? Fuck sake this word has lost all meaning. They were bad and it's being noted, fuck right off.
---
I got dunked by calsf during Chinese tz in their capital.
---
I loved it
---
Actually I hated it
---
Rendering
---
Feel free to camp 1-smeb and the entrance to catch
---
The trick is everyone has to make money somehow. Many PVPers fund their PVP by ratting or mining. Krabs refers to people who exclusively rat or mine, and don’t PVP, which tends to be a much smaller proportion of the population. Just because there are a lot of capitals doesn’t mean there are a lot of krabs, it means the middle ground of PVP/PVE mix is making more money.
---
No, because they are punishing a style of game play that players choose to play. That effectively is no longer a sandbox. It's a battle total game that everyone will burn out on in a year like the others.
---
They weren't the fashion, but suddenly everyone wants a Curse.
---
To a ratting rattlesnake. Hahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahah
---
He died to a ratting rattlesnake lmao
---
Gatecamping is awesome, I miss my inflated scan res blap ships. The only thing ever traveling null these days is instaceptors.
---
We ran into this problem last night; plenty of hunters, not enough prey. We improvised by setting up some bait VNI's and pretenting to rat in them until someone jumped us. No local = no one knows you don't belong there
---
The server crashing lag. Driving through gates swaming with them dieing before you landed or the second you tryed to move off gate.
---
Is what I heard.
---
Why is Zkill down? Blackout is for Nullsec not ALL OF EVE!
---
Zkill isn't even apart of CCP?
---
Heard that one before, oh my chancllor dropped it!!!
---
(don't worry about my spelling)
---
WE ARE LOVING THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Get out of your wormholes and play with the rest of us, then you can have an opinion.
---
Well, are you the same age today as during the golden era? Things have changed man, those days are long gone.
---
This wont turn out well, just check the login numbers.
---
You right, I guess they are leaving it open ended, any time from Monday to forever. Plz be forever.
---
Ive always wanted to start playing Eve, but honestly I dont know if its too late to join. 
---
Is it a good time to join the game? Or should I forget about it?
---
Try turning down your infill if it took 40 hours it's alittle long but 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
---
You're gone in the head mate, buy another VNI and go afk again
---
I played for 15 years and gates camps just well ganked mainly solos  but yeah sometimes they led to good fights too admittedly .  But cmon it's such a crap way to play the game sat in a gate for hours.
---
What I remember is we didnt need mechanics manipulated, we didnt need a no local implemented what we all did in many alliances was get in 50-100 man sub cap roaming gangs and so did the others  and we would all just smash it up somewhere and have GFs in local and everyone would go away thinking what great fun that is and loot the field.  Where max there was the odd titan to ruin your day with a big white flash.  The only thing that's stopped this game being what it was,  is the players and alliances themselves and the ridiculous proliferation of supers and titans absolutely nothing else
---
Luv it
---
I, too, was one of those 63k.
---
There is acres of text and discussion and blog posts and recommendations of people who live every day and have played for over a decade in Low Sec. There is no shortage of ideas of what to do. We dont need new ideas. We just need a recognition of need and a will to change. Low Sec players have already done pretty much everything possible to make Low Sec good again except actually writing the underlying code... give us ability to do that, pretty sure we would self organise and do that too....
---
i know that feeling, i was running sleeper site in a confesser easily. then one site did wrecking shot the oneshotted my full heath ship =-=
---
Yeah but you aren't going to get players to just not use super caps, eve players are great at min maxing even if that means everyone doing it makes it worse for the game.
---
Happens to the best of us 😙
---
Resubbing speaks louder than r/eve posts.
---
&gt;  Don’t forget that BO is probably temporary
---
Not a chance.  Even if it is something that comes and goes here and there(~1 week/month).  It shakes things up awesomely.
---
Beans always get the last laugh
---
Too much infill buddy im doing them at 10%, structural parts really need around 20% such as the stand and stuff
---
&gt;Nullsec will turn into a super-alliance only zone with massive capital umbrellas that make killing anything bigger than a battleship impossible.
---
lol "turn into"

---
Yea 😅 I figured, my kid broke the smaller one I did so I guess I just wanted to make shure.
---
I thought up a idea a while ago.that interdiction null would not counter bubbles but make it so if you where in one it just took some kind off spin up time before you could warp.
---
A heavy drone shouldn't be able to track an AB bonused frigate are you actually retarded
---
&lt;3
---
Ahhhh fair enough ! Makes sense what size is it ?
---
Translation: I too am gay
---
25cm long :)
---
Awesome video, keep up the great work!
---
Just wait until all the krabs actually start farming and not just hiding for the first weekend.
---
Nice nice :)
---
Oh this is nothing compared to what it will become should this continue for a long period.
---
This. They are going to burn the game if it goes on long enough and then quit because no more content. And no one to build their ships, fuel their structures and do the boring things that keeps the game going. 
---
And they dont seem to understand that it really doesnt matter if PLEX prices fall if everything becomes more expensive.
---
Yeah, they dumpstered the retard pets until phorde showed up to bail them out, so I wonder where they got that mindset. Really makes you think.
---

It's never too late, I started just under 2 years ago and was put off by everyone else being way ahead in terms of skillpoints. But with skill injectors and the character bazaar where you can buy characters legitimately, you can get to a good point as fast as you like.

Lol no. ADMs are linked to entosis times.
---
Downloading EVE.
---
Oh yeah it's too late now regarding supers. what I'm saying this lack of content and pvp was  our own making.  Having No local has really absolutely nothing to do with it. There is absolutely nothing stopping us now to do nice roaming gangs still. nothing  ever did..  but instead of forming up to have a gf people just immediately dock up.
---
CCP just had to force something to change that even just a little.
---
Guess your daughter? Grats then.
---
In 250 I have never seen it
---
Came for the kill, stayed for Bjorn's laugh
---
Really? Is that why you guys stayed docked when CONDI came to play?
---
They are winterco members, not renters.
---
Ah the risk argument. That's a fun one. Not sure if some people are throwing stones from their glass house should be in that one.
---
But as to my short, quick, off the top of my head list. I will take it from the defensive tone that none of those are possible.
---
swooping out of the void to fragg shitfit supers? hell yeah.
---
They ran out of ships, I saw them running sites in pods
---
Damn that blows. Props for taking that thing out solo though. That's cool as fuck.
---
What an emotional rollercoaster.
---
Drop one in null, but you moved to hi sec.  Someone tripped the one in null and you got Concorded in hi sec.  It was awesome.
---
The obvious answer is wormholes.  
---
I have to say though, as an ultra-carebear (who loves to roam and shoot things sometimes though), I have to agree that removing NPC stargates really is a bad idea, unless you introduce other ways to get into system, thus rendering the removal of NPC gates pointless.  
---
Would I love to crab in a system, where nobody can hurt me?  
---
Well hell yeah, I would, but the cost of killing all roaming PvP is too high.
---
That is a bit misleading description for it.
---
All shots have 0.01% chance to be wrecking shots.
---
But the missing and wrecking shot are determinet from the same random number in a way that as the shots start missing the missing shots are not the wrecking shots but instead the normal shots. Eventually all the non-wrecking shots miss and you are left with only wrecking hits (and misses).
---
Are t2 beams still better than faction?
---
&gt;Payback for NC. treatment of Horde in HED-GP days
---
Or indeed the Fade days.
---
Lol na man, you dont get it. Your ships are being built by real people, not NPCs. The entire economy revolves around players. So in the end the elite have to get their hands dirty and actually put in work.
---
Your entire argument is hmm... Its like saying that in the real world the military of a country has no ties to that countries welfare. Which is to say the least, extremely wow. Eve doesnt differ all that much from irl. Now imagine if you would remove the people that build your house, your car and so on. The military would collapse in an instant.
---
Not to mention all the other stuff you are missing in your post, like how much more barren NS will be and how much less content there will actually be. I honestly would like to see CCP push this to its limit so that in the end PvPers will start begging PvEers to come back.
---
But you are right in the fact that the game has stagnated, which has zero to do with no local and everything to do with how resources are allocated atm. People dont have a reason to fight and take sov, so they dont. No local does absolutely jack shit to improve this and your uninformed view is what makes CCP think they can get away with shit changes like this.
---
i would like to see some cycles for cloak and longer cooldowns, would be nice :)
---
Yeah that's the better explanation for it
---
First off, I’ve lived in Null so don’t assume based on flair, you’ll just end up looking like an ass.
---
Secondly, everyone is entitled to an opinion so don’t try to gatekeep because it isn’t going to work.
---
some random scrub flying an imp doesn't make random scrub any good.
---
But that was back when you could tank Concord
---
Abyssal space only fountains a small amount of ISK (the survey databases' NPC buy orders). The loot value is high at the moment but it's self balancing. The same argument could be made for mining, I guess, but you can't industrially multibox abyssals so it's not so unbalanced in terms of where the benefit goes.
---
&gt; PvP is one aspect of the game. Not all of it.
---
Absolutely. (I spend much of my time PVEing, I know it's a legit thing to do.) But for the last year or two NS has been so safe that casual roaming PVP has been effectively removed from the game. that's not good.
---
&gt; You do realise the isk isnt that great right?
---
Zero effort anomaly ratting is around 50m an hour, so no, not great, but very good for the effort required, and better than anomaly ratting in LS. Mission running or combat signature running would make a lot more, but (shock!) requires active engagement in the game.
---
&gt; If the reward/risk ratio is off, null will become even more barren
---
If this looks like a problem then the value of high risk activities can be increased. But the answer is not to lower the risk to near zero.
---
Probably thinking they need more of that sweet goon bat phone
---
Wish I recorded - was up against a lot of gangs but couldn't kill their cruisers because they had a jaguar with them. When they didnt I was just able to murder them.
---
&gt; But check the last months log on numbers and you will see that its currently 10% ish less people on today in comparison to the last 4 saturdays
---
Yeah because nullbears haven't adapted yet, they're just hiding in their cave and hoping local will come back. Give it a few weeks until they actually realise they can play again.
---
Also, what proportion of that 10% are bots or near-AFK alts? Neither of those is adding anything to the game except damaging the economy.
---
Good on you man.
---
Lower your coalition number with about 30k and you would have burned out it within weeks. And lol man, the fking PvEers have built your entire economy, all your Keepstars and that 1000 titan blob.
---
Come ooooooooon dude. Literally biting the hand that SRPs your PvP habit.
---
You are aware there is over supply of raw resources compared to whats being destroyed, right? So no, I'm still correct here, the economy does need this
---
I believe the military is like that as well nowadays unless you got grandfathered in
---
r/eve is not EVE itself, stainguy.
---
Nothing sensible will happen regarding geographically distinct space as long as it's so easy to move capitals around and for the big blobs to drop that blob on people in their home.
---
CCP should really turn the suspect flag on again for T4/5 abyssals. Running those in highsec is way too high a reward for the risk.
---
lol'ed from FC going full "...eat shit!.."
---
Remove local in lowsec and replace it with constellation chat.
---
Make space unsafe again.
---
I fucking love it. 04 old man.
---
I mean if you could get a dreadbomb everywhere in 5mins like you used to be able to you know players wouldn't throw them out so often.
---
Lol. There is always an over supply. Dude, you dont know enough about this. And that was before the no local. When all the caches are gone, whos gonna mine the moongoo for the t2 prods? U? Or are you gonna fly around in t1 cruisers with t1 mods? Whos gonna get you that slave set? U?
---
Nah, just hang out there, other people will fall for it aswell and it shall be thunderdome.
---
Even now newbies can do plenty in nullsec, they just have to learn. :)
---
Focusing on exploration sites might be harder.
---
is this what actually counts as a win for you
---
STD’s. Sound transmitted diseases.
---
edit it further, pull them apart so there's a FUCKTON of distance between them.
---
Pilot is bad and should feel bad.
---
Can you please make that pic very very wide and put a lot of distance between the imp and the wasp?
---
spec skill bonus, if you have the fitting room...
---
&gt; The point of having a bot was never that they were uncatchable
---
But with local, a bot *is* uncatchable. It will be in warp before you even load system, even if you set a logoff trap. With local, a human is also uncatchable, except when they stop paying attention - and a bot never stops paying attention.
---
2012 to 2014 was epic too (lowsec pirate).
---
But PVP players don’t need that many systems to sustain themselves. I bet most 1,000 man alliances could survive in constellation or two.
---
I love that killmails are now images
---
So essentially, from my understanding, there is bad luck protection on Wrecking Hits and you are guarenteed to _eventually_ get one, but this bad luck protection builds up even if you miss all your shots, so by the time you finally hit one you have a guarenteed Wrecking Hit left?
---
You think the kills are rolling in now?  Wait until ADMs start dropping and players try to rat them back up.
---
imagine being this misinformed and still commenting
---
Resub imo.  This is the most fun I've had in Eve in a long time.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/evHQkNH.gif](https://i.imgur.com/evHQkNH.gif)
---
&gt; guy runs 10 bots, all he does now is put one of them on grid with the in gate, cloaks, and starts his bots mining, or ratting, Hostile gate splash happens, cloaked hunter exposes himself for a fraction of a second which is an infinity of time for a BOT, which then instantly tells all the other working bots to dock.
---
- The gate watcher can't see who the splash is until you break gate cloak
---
- If he's putting one of his 10 accounts there, he's already 10% pay down
---
- He can see you enter system, but not whether you safelog
---
- He can't see you coming in through a wormhole
---
- He can't see you log in from a logoff trap
---
- In a system with several gates, unless he sacrifices several accounts to watch them all he doesn't know when you leave system
---
It's still hugely better, even if you think that the botter can write the perfect bot to watch a gate.
---
I loved when each null entry had some kind of gate camp on it. You could always get a good fight off of them. I think what killed this though was mostly nullified travel ceptors/T3's, and JB networks.
---
Lots of great fights to be had in FW in Black Rise. The trick is you have to actually be in FW to pressure the fights.  I'd point to zkill for some of the more busy systems as proof but...
---

Good graphics thou
---
my friend got clapped hauling to our lowsec, and he isn't telling me for how much i just want to knoooow

It just got too exhausting for me, trying to play solo so I was playing 4 accounts at once.
---
I like it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhc1SnezAR0 just watch this
---
it should be back on monday :(
---
If you are communicating with your corp you should know who's in the same area as you.
---
Turret hits go like this:
---
A random number from interval 0-1 is generated.
---
If the random number larger than the chance to hit you miss.
---
If the random number is smaller than 0.01 you hit for 3x damage (300% wrecking). Otherwise you hit for `Random number + 0.49`x damage (0.5x - 1.49x damage).
---
Don't agree with you about warp-to-zero, forcing everyone except locals to slowboat 10km to a gate was dumb.
---
But the blackout is great and adds some element of uncertainty and excitement to null.
---
Got pictures? I’d love to check it out. Yea i could have reduced it to 15 or 10% I bet. but it’s 25cm long as well 😅 so I wanted it to be sturdy.

Yes, cause there hasnt been a reason for people to make the change. People are creatures of habit, they wont change unless forced. Im saying dont force them cause you wont like the outcome. Its a "be careful of what you wish for" kinda thing.
---
Casual roaming is 100% possible, check out LS. Check out Horde and Brave space, Querious and so on. People dont want to casual roam, they want to kill the most with the least amount of effort. Thats how people work, no big mystery. Same people who have been crying for these changes to happen are the same people that never take any real fights.
---
And that is going to be nerfed. Why do you think VNIs are getting fked. And honestly, most VNIs are low skilled players. And they dont affect enough to warrant drastic measures. The only really viable of isk making in NS is muliboxing of +5 Rorqs. They are the winners, but they are few. 
---
But my man, NS has been repeatedly nerfed the last 6 months. (big nerfs!) So right now we are at an alltime low value and then you introduce an alltime higher risk. You cant go both ways in such drastic ways, its breaks the ratio. If this was 6 months ago I would have perhaps atleast allowed for some time to pass before saying that its a shit change but atm, knowing full well how NS has been changed, I cant.
---
it's not shopped, it happened.

---
Where did you get the transaltion of the alphabet?
---
Enough to chat, but vague enough that you can't draw definitive Intel.
---
Your talking about the game where we have people with over 100 accounts that they actually have logged in at one time so for some one who's actually botting and not actually required to be at the PC the number of clients required is kinda moot, but I suspect most botters will end up down some pipe pocket some where that there is only one way in.
---
The Gate watcher does not need to wait for the decloak, the splash itself is enough for a bot to trigger flee on the drones, so the drones would be moving to safe up before your clients even loaded the other side.
---
You'r wrong about the safe log, it's easy for a bot to count people as they come in and out, if a hostile comes into the pocket but does not exit you can assume he's either still there or he safe logged at which point you can either send out a few to bait him and check, or just stay in station and wait him out, another thing the bot can do effortlessly as the human sleeps.
---
It's not hugely better at all, if anything it's slightly better when considering pvp pilots who are prepared to slip in and wait the botter out, for normal system traffic which lets face it will be the bulk of traffic a botter needs to deal with it'l be little difference.
---
Anything a Player can do, a bot can do better, so put yourself in the botters shoes and assume you don't need sleep, food, or a pee, assume you wont get tired or bored with EvE, then assume there are 10 of you just how safe do you think you and your 9 other hypothetical pals will be, how much will you be able to mine or rat even with no local.
---
\[EDIT : For the record, I HATE BOT's I want them all gone from the game 10000000%, but as a programmer I know how easy they are to make and how good they can be, this is not a love bot post I just think players need to wake up, dealing with bots needs to be done out of game, not in game.\]
---
Nice, awsome model
---
Grouping isn't the problem with the game. Grouping *is* the game.
---
I was in that fleet, super fun.
---
You might want to raise a support ticket.
---
I can't see CCP liking it.
---
and its fucking amazing
---
I tinkered me a Stabber fit, apparently you can throw 35m ISK at a "trash tier" T1 cruiser and end up with 620 DPS hot...
---
calm down satan
---
You don’t think about it. Just keep pushing. Muscle memory will kick in and you won’t even realize your doing it anymore.
---
The problem with increased grouping is that all sides simply stand-off with one another. There is nothing at risk, ever. It's simply stagnation.
---
Isn’t this was the cspa charge is for or did that finally get fully removed?
---
I see what you did there. Only if the Russians would step their game up.
---
#Russiantimetoshine
---
There was a group of bots that were killed yesterday that immediately undocked in pods and warped back to a site.
---
To be killed again.
---
Over and over.
---
Same here.
---
And if the random number is smaller than 0.01, is the hit guarenteed no matter what or...?
---
So was the titan Origin have logged off supers in Impass.

F my dude, hope the next imp will have better luck
---
Itt: self proclaimed "hunters" salty about this and the zkillboard blackout.
---
&gt; wormholer
---
Yes
---
&gt;Less industrial action leads to less output, less output leads to increase in prices, increase in prices mean those who sit on the fence of fighting/pvping may decide not to risk a ship as it is now far more expensive than it was.
---
Higher prices also means more people will be willing to risk the production.
---
But neither have the hunters. They will be complaining about a new thing next week cause this will fade, mark my words. And when they do, its going to be less content all around. Fairly certain this is what they will be complaining about.
---
Sure thing, bots are a thing. But they will adapt. And we havent talked about the amount of people returning for this event. All in all, the player count has dropped by alot and there is no guarantee that they will return in a few weeks. Im betting you they wont. There are plenty of nearly risk free methods of making isk that allows you to not have to run megafleets for PAPs and so on (being tied to NS). 
---
But I guess we shall see.
---
Unless you're a pvp player, harassment doesn't exist.
---
when sides are even there are definitely systems that people just don't check so you can plex in them pretty much afk. However situations like the current amarr minmatar warzone where minmatar own so few systems you pretty much get fights everywhere you can offensively plex as amarr.
---
Also in fw people will generally not take fights they don't even have a chance to win. People have bitched at me for warping out my executioner when they warp in with a worm. Like no shit i'm not going to fight you, the only way i win is if you forgot to fit drones or are a literal shit fit.
---
The 28y9-p battle  in scalding pass was a mixed battleship fleet  ( megas /tempest / tfi/bhaals ) on winterco side.
---
Heard this as it happened. Funny story too. Make sure your standings are set right and give your game a second or two to properly load ships and standings. 
---
Or just shoot anyway. Blue on blue action is pretty tasty.
---
Absolutely people will be mining moongoo (yes, myself included) and are in fact doing it now. People will just think twice about taking out rorqs, and even then, people still are. 
---
You actually think t2 items will just disappear, no appetite will build to get these items. Please. 
---
Risk vs reward. The fact an item gets rarer only builds the reward for it, everyone has thier own risk tolerance.
---
I noticed they'd collected a bit of sov on the side as well; do you know how they fit into the power dynamics within WinterCo? I'm not familiar with their military activities, only their ratting
---
No grappler AND awful tracking? NC plz.
---
Mmm...        
---
Salt.
---
I can think of half a dozen high profile structures and more small scale battles won by unspoken and their allies than I can count. Unspoken literally lost their structures to the deployment of NC. I guess your trolling anyway though, so eat my serious reply
---
F
---
*As many as are of that opinion say Aye*
---
Why didn't you kill the wasps?
---
Just use Google Sheets and the Evepraisal API and make one yourself. It took me only an hour or so to make one myself and it's a good way to get better at coding.
---
Lol perfect analogy. People have been playing to many BR games lately and cant be satisfied with anything but immediate satisfaction anymore. Most are complaining about the game when in fact they as individuals have lost the patience to actually let things take time.
---
And not even a year. Give it a couple of days and all the hunters will be begging CCP to revert the change because they cant even find prey anymore.
---
Local gives me a good sense of what I can do when I log in. If it’s a busy night in local space I pvp if it’s kind of slow I go rat. I don’t understand why you guys have a hard on for this no local thing you could have lived in a wh if you did not want local. I get lots of fights all the time with local.
---
Were missing me the entire time, wasn't bothering 😣
---
Because where was the reason to roam when everyone could see you 50 jumps out and knew what you had and how many you had?
---
100% correct. But why should any playstyle be worth more than the other? Especially considering krabs most likely stand for the majority of players?
---
I'm already a developer for a living, but I figured someone would have already made one for the web. Google is just failing me.
---
One day... That's the dream :3
---
Why?
---
Then krab in highsec. A chat channel offering perfect safety has always been absurd.
---
you're gonna have to explain to me how a raitaru is a high profile structure lmao
---
And these same people keep saying krabs are risk averse. The hypocrisy is major lol. Same fkers wont ever take fights they can lose because they cant afford to replace it.
---
there was 10km warp distance? man, it must have been terrible back then, 10km is rather short distance in space especialy when MVD on frigate gives speed of over 1km/s
---
The miners have been enraptured I guess...
---
As long as nullification is a thing, gatecamping is largely pointless, so don't worry.
---
How do you easily counter a ship when you're neuted and he can warp off at any time if he sees backup coming?
---
they exist i don’t have a link ignore the “make it yourself” troll.
---
All them salty AT-boiz
---
Very true. People have built up this narrative and they are diehard keeping to it. Like why wouldnt you maximise your efforts if you have to grind isk.
---
Possible or not you might as well have local back at that point. The major effect of getting rid of local is to get rid of perfect immediate Intel. You're just asking for that back in another form. Ironic name btw
---
if you have spec 5, t2 are slightly better than faction
---
&gt;If you can't defend yourself, you shouldn't undock
---
It's not about defending yourself. When a fleet of cloaked bombers/recons drop on you, unless you rat/ minein a PVP fit super, you're fucked. If they cyno in their own caps, you're fucked whatever you're in.
---
It's about having a response fleet of your own caps to counter them. When a group from a big alliance go "hunting". Whatever they encounter, they can and will kill. If they're losing a fight, they drop caps and win. You cannot compete, unless you're in a massive alliance too. 
---
Small alliances or corps will get the short end, as they will lose any skirmishes to anyone but even smaller alliances or lone players. 
---
&gt;If you are afraid to loose a a T1 barge or a vni you s should move back to hs. This is where you belong
---
It's not about being afraid to lose it, it's the fact they can do literally nothing to avoid losing it. And will lose it repeatedly, until there's no point undocking to lose it again. Roams of ships that can't be scanned, or cloaky campers that have logged off in system cannot be beat by small scale ratters or miners just trying to earn isk. At all. They will NEED to join bigger groups so they can actually earn income again.
---
This place complains so much about huge alliances and caps being dropped in every fight, but that's what needs to be done to stop feeding kills, now more than ever.
---
Yeah, I don't know what the "imyormom" comment is about, the camps that were around in EC-P8R/M-OEE8/KBP7-G/P3EN-E/BWF-ZZ/7Q-8Z2/etc. was some of the best ways to get PvP in the old days and something I miss immensely.
---
They were often quite scrappy, but could escalate into so much more. Busting camps in those entry systems was often what led to some of the best fights you saw in the old small gang videos.
---
Finding those kind of fights in EVE 2019 is so much harder and it's a big part of why smaller groups are rarer and more inclined to leave the game.
---
When you warped to a gate, or a station, or anything really, you would land 10km in front of it. There was no "warp to 0".
---
If your chance to hit is smaller than 0.01 then the shoot can miss with random number 0.01.
---
you guys know so much about the fits... These look like fraternity standard fits to me. They build tank for a possible cyno save. This is why frat banned Hel's and said Nyx ratters only for "survivability".
---
With regards to this mod or that mod it could have been this way or that way. There's several schools of thought:
---
1. build it super cheap for best Isk efficiency with pure damage and no tank
---
2. build it super expensive with tank and hope it will be saved
---
3. build it relatively cheap with tank and hope it will be saved
---
They appear have to taken the 3rd way. big deal. Trimark I's are not uncommon on super ratters
---
You go hunt in LS. Why should the majority bend to the minority, especially if you dont live in NS. That is uber lol.
---
And how does local offer perfect safety? By that definition no one should have died in NS last week. But they did. Hmm so strange, is it that with some actual effort things still died but people want the least amount of effort to kill things? Im genuinely shocked.
---
My tiny human is now 3! But thanks ;)
---
I thought that [this quote](https://pastebin.com/iVjLZDDc) from Alexander Hamilton was strangely appropriate for this situation
---
also, how would you get out to spend all of your money?
---
oh, that makes sense now, being able ot instantly warp to gate is realy useful, i dont think i would be able to warp anywhere if i had to fly 10km to a gate because of gatecampers
---
It's not a "troll", dude, it's good life advice. Learn to understand technology and not just blindly use it.
---
That's interesting, because experience suggests that campers run whenever an actual threat comes to the gate.
---
If you can't understand how knowing exactly who is in which system is broken then you're a lost cause.
---
You need 2 T2 webs to apply rage to armor frigs in lowsec.
---
They should do this every weekend
---
Start looking for contracts that you can pick up and take right to market to sell.
---
Don't forget cynos, that's probably the biggest issue with dodging around gates.
---
Well, presumably you have something to haul in.  Otherwise this is a moot question.  The biggest hurdle to casual hauling is knowing what is bait and what is bullshit for the risk.  There are videos and writeups about it if you google-fu at all.  The basics are; locate places in need of materials and/or items(demand), and find a way to get it there without blowing up(supply).
---
&gt;No. The difference is that people are actually flying engagable ships.
---
Did you not see brave killing a titan after two dropped on an "engageable ship"? 
---
People are still dropping caps.
---
You know, you are just missing the entire chain of arguments. Which is fine. I doubt that you will become aware of your logical shortcoming in this area since I highly doubt CCP will keep this up a prolonged period of time.
---
Which is also fine.
---
But if they do. Pretty please. Dont start bitching in a couple of months about how things have become worse than ever. Because if you do, which Im sure you will, you..
---
by small gang do you mean dunking people who are shit/ hunting ratter or actual fights between two competent gangs?
---
Market commodities and player owned items. Knowing that you can buy a ship or item in one region and resell it for millions more in another.  Hauling can't be done without significant capital also there's a hauling channel where people post offers.
---
You could just read his post, but fuck it I guess.
---
Search Kopie von eve industry cal, it is way too big but works
---
blue kills are the sweetest
---
Fuck that, they should leave it as it is for a few months and then release an Observatory or whatever that gives local.
---
Make it expensive to build and fuel.
---
How do you find places needing materials though?
---
That's the wonderful part of zkill being down.
---
None of that matters. They pulled out nano into our nano. Stuff blew up, had a good time.
---
At least you didn't get RNG'd by a drifter.

I played Diablo II in German, it was fantastic. Blutiges Vorgebirge, Kerker des Hasses and so on.

Put things in your cargo in a station then bring it somewhere else.
---
let me know if you willingly engage another decent pvp entity in a small gang setting ok
---
To be honest, thats like every day. Not the Rags perhaps but people have been ballsier so it doesnt surprise me. But we dont know any of that due to zkill being down.
---
Seriously, I haunt had damage alerts since this was implemented because I can't stand the sound
---
do i have to lecture you on wormhole mechanics again?
---
funny comment from guy whose ally dropping dosens of supers on everything more than single stealth bomber.
---
We did. We also scrapped with tdsin an hour later.  Gilas, scimi, sleips, also a mach, falcons, and more.
---
I'm sad that you might have to leave hisec to experience it.
---
I wasnt around for those times but Im fairly certain your correct in your assesment. There is only one way this is going to go, and its very much not the way people think it is. And in a couple of months the same people are going to complain about how things have gotten worse than ever without admitting their own part in it.
---
we are the strongest entity that has ever touched the game
---
try and flex against that
---
A win at life is for me is any time I smile. Your comments and my replies make me smile so... yes.
---
Solo carrier is viable, if you have a hunter alt...
---
Stage in a lowsex/npc system near a null sec bloc that doesnt have a good response fleet and just drop on things there like your in a blops :P can be good fun just make sure you have decent skills and not just the requirements for flying the hull/basic modules...
---
Any questions feel free to pm me about it 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
As much as people love to shit on gate camping, it was one of the only reasons in eve for people to be out in space in combat fit ships. Sure ganking a solo pilot passing through isn't exactly great pvp content, but often times gate camps would end up in engagements between kitchen sink fleets where every person was flying there own ships and there skill mattered, or camps could be baited by a skilled solo pilot.
---
Nullification and the huge increase in use of cyno ships killed gate camping. IDK if gate camping should be brought back, but the game definitely needs to bring in reasons for people to be out in space in PVP fit ships.
---
Sounds like you're looking for one of the bigger null blocs. Try Brave Newbies, Dreddit, or Karma Fleet for a few of the easier to get into corps.
---
A little out of the loop here...
---
Could someone explain why a less than 300 mil killmail is a big deal?
---
The doom and gloom by some in this community paint is ridiculous (eve is dying btw).
---
 Ill gladly reap the rewards of nullsec as a miner and welcome the pvp as a pvper - as will many others. 
---
Your risk tolerance is lower, thats fine, but dont push the inappropriate risk tolerance on the rest of nullsec.  It should never have been safer than highsec, and it finally isnt. PvE will go on, and PvP will have a new injection of excitement. 
---
All is well, good job CCP.
---
lol at excluding tdsin from decent pvp entity, some memes never die
---
who were the people you fought against? what did you bring, what did they bring, sorry i dont get much info while being stuck within jita 4-4 :(
---
Dude your in goons. You have no room to talk about fair small gang fights.
---
Anecdotal arguments have the standing power of a plastic bag in a hurricane.
---
I would try out one of the larger alliances/corps as others have mentioned. You'll get a chance to use that carrier, and do plenty of other things. Most also have the numbers than they arent hounding everyone for every single timer
---
&gt;dismissing an opinion just because what alliance I am in without knowing my background in eve
---
Oh Reddit
---
Simple farmers has been know to catch both travel ceptors and yachts.
---
215bil. AT ship. Don’t whoosh me please.
---
But didn't you just say that you're the strongest entity in the game?  
---
What it must feel like to be you and not have battle reports that you can vicariously live through.
---
Go out of your bubble and live.
---
If you're a beginner, one way would be to find a mission-running hub with a bunch of Lvl4 Security Agents, and haul a shit ton of hvy/cruise missiles there to sell at highly elevated prices. It takes you into the realm of being a trader more than a haulier, but hauling other people's stuff for dimes on the dollar is rarely worth it.
---
Nothing that cant be worked around. But it requires effort. What I do know however is that it was never hard to kill things. It was always just a question of how badly you wanted it done. I simply think people grew older and didnt want the same things as much, like killing random ships and are instead blaming the other aspect, the work part.
---
Maybe time to rethink what you actually want in the game (and in life in general) instead of trying to force others to adapt because of your unvillingness to accept that you deep down are a krab. Come out of the closet bro, its okey, we got u fam!:)
---
Gonna come back for blackout, drop revenants on goons then safe up and log out or what?
---
You missed 3 zero's
---
I think we should compromise here, lets allow cynos to be an actual beacon in wormholes that capitals can jump to. This way we are all even and it's all fair. Remove local,  and keep it the way it is. Guaranteed to get fights this way.
---
Lots of things are undocked in Delve.  Come on over, we have such sights to show you.
---
I've been playing scince 2005 and taking local away is one of the best things they have done.  It makes up for the changes they made to cap ship jump drives.
---
&gt;have remarked they left wormholes and it was a factor. Spamming a key is not good gameplay, it isn't for wormholes or null
---
No. Take that back! 
---
I like mashing a button like a fucking idiot and it makes me a superior player to you!
---
Try 600b
---
Player count isn't everything though. 
---
You could multiply the player count by 10, however if all those players are bots, everyone loses. 
---
Right now, we may see a dip in overall player count, however we dont know what the source of that dip is. For all we know that dip could signify just how big of a problem Eve has with botting. Perhaps one of the reasons we are seeing more content, is that the bots have logged out and the players have logged in. 
---
Its early days yet too, I don't think anyone really knows the potential of what this means for the game overall. 
---
I just came here to say, so far, this has been a good experience for me and my friends who play. I'm not going to pretend that some peoples play styles wont suffer because of it. With that said, maybe its a good time to re-evaluate the way people do their ratting, try new play styles, new ships, figure out ways to take advantage of the change for your play style.
---
Yes you're right, because you all lost your super cap umbrellas when you lost local.
---
Wasn't much of an opinion. More like a judgement. The guys having fun and you've gotta critique it... Lol
---
Just sub with real life money, why are you insane enough to plex just to play the game.
---
Ah, one hour caching.  That would explain why it's never really been useful for me in the one or two attempts I've made to get into hunting.  Thanks!
---
I agree, for now this is a good enough step.  Let's see how it washes out, then notch it, rather than use a bigger hammer.
---
Wormholes can fill your wants, and my alliance atleast doesn’t expect you to show up and stay up all night.
---
Small gang-mid gang and it’s always fun🤷🏼‍♂️
---
You've clearly not hunted recently, hyperspatial ceptors aren't even fast enough for a lot of ships, they're all gone the second a neutral enters local.
---
r3dfire and jenk corp became MCAV. It's a good time to come back, a lot of the old heads have resurfaced.
---
I'm gonna do it in support of this, even if I don't end up playing
---
This has nothing to do with buying plex. The basic act of PVPing requires isk to buy ships, it’s why so many newbros struggle with it since even a fit T1 frigate is crazy expensive if you’re mining in a venture in highsec. At some point, you need to make isk to buy these things, and to do that, many people engage in PVE. At no point does plexing enter the conversation.
---
Yea, but they wont
---
Imagine undocking and doing something far beyond a super umbrella. Imagine it.
---
I think you're right.  I was moving some eyes characters around this week and have seen several hunters wandering aimlessly through null.  I think this will push hunters to develop their skills, but nullsec is REALLY big.  There does need to be some indicators or looking for targets is just going to be boring.
---
Thanks!
---
Could you quote where I've judged him?
---
Closest thing I've said is a question
---
You all? Not sure who you're talking to, but it's a fair thing. Just one thing, you want people to cluster more around super cap umbrellas? Hey man, I don't know if you're a goon or not but lets not make the blob stronger.
---
Citadels were a pretty massive change to fw mechanics and are when fw really started to die out

Dodging my question
---
Fuck off, not.
---
Implying the little guy still exists in null, lmao.
---
thanatos kill as present not bad
---
Lol, til 15% ish drops in server pop is nothing to be worried about. Their voices dont matter, but yours does. Im pushing risk tolerance, not you?
---
Just lol dude, you dont even know what youre talking about. And NS being safer than HS is a meme dude, its not real.
---
Sorry, there's no instant killmail to show you, no documented proof for you to backseat drive, no battle report for you to criticize.
---
Must suck to be you.
---
This is not what the black out I see
---
Props for using it mate. Glad you enjoyed it whilst it lasts. Hopefully you can get another one soon !
---
No need, your comments are already above, no? Take care now.

I wonder if star citizen will be out then 🤔
---
Ahhh the best Eve trailer!
---
You're *bragging* about a *video game*.
---
That's rich.
---
You said Justice. Justice skin. It’s only fitting now.
---
Because you're taking a very expensive, unbonused hull.  You'd be better served taking the isk you're wasting and putting it into a Covops (which has a bonus) and one of those fancy relic modules and maybe an implant.  You'll blitz through sites so fast it won't matter if people see you on D scan.  And if you lose it, meh, already replaced.
---
Gave this another read for the lols. Perhaps stick to concise trolly comments on posts rather than trying your hand at formal English for what seems like the first time..  Please kids, stay in school!

You should have used cinema 4d to add more polygons
---
A significant percentage of Earth's population watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. By Apollo 17, the ratings were so low they cancelled the program. If there is sustainable fun by CCP's and the player's metrics, great, but let's see how it looks next week and the week after before we proclaim the rebirth of eve. 
---
I still think this I should just bread and circus at the games to distract people from the previous 10 daily threads about how broken the basic null mechanics are right now.
---
You'll probably be against this, but bear with me on this, cynos should be nerfed. Empires should be forced to spread out, decrease anom respawn times. Some form of jump fatigues should occur when you use a FLEX gate. Just a few suggestions that I think people like yourself may be against. just think about it for a sec okay?
---
Deleting local is just a gimmick, or a test by CCP to observe how it effects the player base. CCP should focus on the real issues instead of making a few people happy. Shaking the game is good, but it should be a REAL shake up not a gimmick forcing people to blob even more.
---
Lol at still dodging, the root of this all stems at my frustration of people glorifying killing renter tier players that run at them 1 by 1 in their fleet fit ships and hunting ratters, which is more of a display name of other skills than PvP prowess.
---
It has nothing to do with what alliance I am, I only ever bring that to meme on that other who talked about it.
---
Local was empty, that meant it was safe.  D:
---
Iggy Pop by the looks of 'im.
---
Where did I judge hi m though?
---
Same, pls be forever
---
And your country is much better?
---
That's dope
---
Why would I be against any of that? I'm against the absurd idea of cynos in wormholes because it ignores the mass limitations and would bring the k-space blobs in.
---
assuming you're not memeing us:
---
the imp is one of a handful of alliance tournament ships. these are given out by ccp to the winners of a big pvp tournament, with different ships each year. there will only ever be 50 imps im the game, ever. as you might expect, these ships are both wildly powerful, and wildly expensive.
---
the killmails in game don't list the hull, damage control, or abyssal mods in the price just because none ever sell on the market, instead going through contracts, so it doesn't have anything to source a price from, defaulting to 1 isk
---
realistically, an imp hull is worth *at least* 200b, and assuming the abyssal mods were rolled well, this kill is probably 400b or so
---
I got that reference, I must be old now
---
You realise that a lot of your posts are about bragging on being a wormholer right?
---
its the opposite of what speedrunners want, they play the language w/ the least amount of text
---
and peoples still hire him to do shit.
---
Well you put something in your ship, then you fly somewhere else and take that out of your ship.
---
Oh I have. And those are bots, they are hard to catch because people will afk a lot more therefore being easier to catch. It sucks but I dont mind, I dont give a shit about catching VNIs. And if its worth enough, u can always do traps. 
---
You see, I like real fights. The ones where Im going up against someone with a PvP fit and the readiness to use it. I dont give 2 shits if I win or lose, I just want the shakes. But PvPers are amongst the most risk averse group I have seen because they rarely take a fight they dont have super many advantages in. Yet the same people are saying these things about krabbers. Which tend to risk a shitton of isk for a low reward and now you want the risk to be higher after the rewards already been nerfed multiple times in a couple of months.
---
Sorry but thats just BS man.
---
&gt; As always, we're not happy until you're content
---
smacks with the double entendre
---
You're an idiot but thanks for playing.
---
9-XN3F is your Alliance staging? I'v got my scouts now there waiting when you begin to move to HS.
---
Removing local from nullsec is Ok because wormholers live without it for ages and know: it’s not big deal.
---
However adding local to WHs is NoNo: these are completely different environments!
---
I really like you 👍🤣
---
I would agree with you, if it weren't for the fact that I used to hunt frat space on the regular and drag bubble their bots off citadels.   
---
Which they'd die to, every. single. time, without fail. And they'd sometimes crash, where all 1 of 5 bots with the same name with a numbered ending or EVE default random last name would sit off a structure undock immobile, letting you bump them off. This wasn't in one constellation or something, but across all of their sov, all part of COINS. Quite often i'd see groups of them vanish permanently to get replaced, presumably after a ban or killboard flush.
---
They think that because hunters rely so heavily on zkill where krabs do not. So they lost an intel tool at the same time krabs lost local and they think you are defending the krabs. Personally I just wish KB culture was less pervasive than it currently is but that would never happen.
---
Just buy it and welp it through lowsec until it does.
---
I did this with an archon once and it was pretty fun.
---
You're a fucking idiot. Don't ever post here again.
---
You also don't need to krab to make isk. There are PLENTY of opportunities via the market, PI and other non active activities that you can engage in. Start a buy back program and build alliance doctrines, or even better, buy the minerals from alliance (cheaper than jita prices as well!) and build supers or caps. You don't need to turbo krab to make isk. 
---
I can't say most krabs will turn to marketing or PI but you seriously have no excuse when you say "I don't have any isk!". Noobies can join groups that offer plenty of benefits. They can learn and realize what they want to do in eve. You might need to krab for a week or so to start an investment fund, or be more intelligent, just buy some plex to care of that.
---
Oh, I don't doubt it for one second, which is what makes it so funny. I probably even know the guy.
---
Op said he Burned in to kill the rattle when it got into hull.  making a 90 degree turn with a ab frigate into a drone boat, that's why you died not because of some .01% mechanic.
---
Im with you, far from anything definitive can be said. I just would want space to have atleast twice the amount of people that it currently holds. Would be so awesome and I really hope that it will go that way.
---
And I dont care if they are krabbers or casual players or whatever. It would be highly beneficial to all no matter.
---
Not sure who you think you're talking about.
---
You just don't know enough about low sec. Both FW and level 5 low sec missions pay far more isk/hour than you can make in null sec unless you're multiboxing a bunch of rorquals.
---
Out of the original 50, how many of these are left? I feel like I've seen a post every time one dies, but it's still extremely rare.
---
Those options work too. But oftentimes, the fastest and easiest option is just hopping in a VNI and making some quick isk. All those other things require longer term setups, whereas ratting pays out up to 20 minutes after you start. There’s a lot of very different and very valid options to making isk in EVE, that’s what makes it such a cool game. Different people have different needs so they’re able to do different things.
---
I dunno carrier ratting solo earns a about 100m an hour, and super is I think about 150m, and now I see people ratting in titans....lol
---
Haha lol, When diplomacy fails:) 
---
And if u ever want a fight, come at me. Any time, anywhere. Bring as many advantages as you can, just make me sweat baby!:)
---
Ranked the best, actually.
---
Want me to link you your own posts when I get to a pc?
---
A win at life is anytime you smile...  k
---
due to the blackout i can't check zkill for any losses but there's probably 40-ish left
---
I heard a couple weeks ago that the lesser trade hub markets are starting to plunge because the old haulers aren't restocking as often, you might be able to pick their slack up. Look for gaps in the market in like Amarr, Dodixie and Rens.
---
sphere.exe -crithack
---
Carrier ratting is about 150m an hour last time I checked with supers being around 300m an hour. FW missions with 1 account are about 700m-1b isk an hour at tier 5. 500m or so an hour at tier 4. I used to multibox FW missions for about 7b isk a day. Level 5 missions require a puller and a carrier character but are minimum 700m an hour.
---
Yeah, land at 10, get caught by blob and autodie. Fun. You are not talking about risk, mate.
---
"A fool and his money are soon parted"
---
Where the fuck do you think all that stuff comes from? You're quite deluded. Nothing comes out of thin air
---
The reports of Drifters ignoring damage cap were false according to CCP game managers.
---
damn i didnt realize it was nearly that much.....I really dont get it lol
---
Noted, I’m getting so many good tips here that I’m considering doing a re-print. Printing it in two parts and now using cinema 4d to add polygons 🤔
---
with beam lasers there's quite a large difference
---
I don't think you actually read anything I said or looked at the picture.
---
&gt;Ive stayed subbed, but havent played in 5+ years now
---
Why on earth would you do this?
---
Upvote for Full Metal Jacket reference.
---
The point of that comment was that I was catering to a select crowd that would love to see that. CCP went ahead to cater to the crowd of "delete local" for what ever reason (hopefully just temp), why can't they go the other way? Why didn't they actually have the balls to deal with the REAL problems? Instead they gave pvp brainlets an edge and now they want a mile after being given an inch. 
---
There needs to be a close balance if possible. As much as I hate ratting, that is the way of life for A LOT of people in eve. No one should be telling krabs that their lifestyle is worse than anyone else's. I personally would love to see krabs all burn, then see them realize that they can make isk without going afk or using NEAR 2. It is good when it happens organically, not because some pvp nerds want a hard on for a weekend.
---
FW does need fixing but more because it pays \*too\* much, and because the mechanics are boring and stale and haven't been touched in 10 years. Most null sec dwellers have no idea how much more low sec PvE pays than null sec. They just assume the real money is in null sec, but unless you're a market god or a 6+ Rorqual multiboxer, it really isn't.
---
To be fair a single stealth bomber can cyno-in a couple of hundred other single stealth bombers.

How to man up and krab in blackout
---
How is it a silly argument? People will obsess over kills and losses no matter what, the board existing or not doesn't facilitate that in any way. A zkillboard link is useful for sharing kills because it's a single link that shows an accurate isk value for the loss, shows the people that shot the victim and what they were in, and provides a history of kills and losses for everybody that uploads. 
---
The only people whining about killboards are people that want every advantage for their nullbloc (which are absolutely worse for the game than a simple website) and for people that obsess over their killboard.
---
You know what happens when an item becomes more scarce? It gets more expensive. There will always be people that will go out and mine because something has become SCARCE. They can make good money off of it now! The market is so free in this game, except for a few resources but, at the end of it, if you play it right you can make isk without having to ever rat with a super.
---
There are a lot of reasons for that, beyond ground size. The ease of ISK being primary among them. There is simply no reason to attack because everyone has ISK banks which can't be broken, farming which can't be stopped, and massive armadas. The fastest way to destroy all those things, imo (and it appears you agree at least in part), is to kill local.
---
Sounds like he’s just full of shit and rolled up on gang of retrievers.
---
How is it bad for the game? Just because some wormhole nerds give thousands of cheap ships to someone and then kill the ships doesn't automatically make it a "bad thing". It's just a dumb thing to do.
---
flair checks out
---
With all this talk about gatecampe providing content, I have to ask, did gatecampers have more balls back in the old days or something? Because these days the only thing impressive about them is how quickly they warp off to one of the thirteen citadels on grid when their cloaky eyes 3 jumps out sees anything more threatening than a single t1 cruiser.
---
taht is I think one of the BIGGEST issues with FW is just circling the dot for hours on end gets REAL old fast.
---
I have no doubt that the renewed freshness in the eve universe following the blackout will make ccp consider the importance of this event moving forward.
---
I'd agree with you on this if you're talking about new players, but how many people rat in supers now days? How much SP does it take to get into a super? How about a rorqual? How about the knowledge in industry to make the most out of your minerals? You say its easy but you know how much a BPO for anything other than a T1 Battlecruiser can be worth? Why not invest that isk or skill injectors in making isk without krabbing.
---
Seconded. He’s pretty trash judgemental Wormholers
---
I enjoy the drama XD
---
Thanks, but nothing is coming up. Typo maybe?
---
Pansyfan is still going!!!   He is like the Energizer bunny, but constantly has to replace the batteries.
---
a vexor roam i had not to long ago will be doing more vexor runs in the future as i have a few more new builds.  
---
i would like to thank all of you for the support and the love from the community.

life has me a little busy at the moment but should be back full swing end of month or beginning of august.

If the damage of wrecking shots was reduced significantly they would maybe be okay, but 300% is absolutely bonkers
---
I'd rather have a relatively empty server where everyone undocks than one full of spod brains that dock when I enter system.
---
&gt;as it makes no sense to have a recurring sub only sub for 1 month at a time
---
given CCP's track record a one month sub makes perfect sense so that when they fuck your preferred part of the game up you can just take a break while they unfuck it.
---
It is incredibly boring and needs updating desperately. FW hasn't been changed since it was added to the game.  They made a couple of minor tweaks to avoid abuse and reduce AFK farming but it's basically the same as it was on the day of it's release.
---
In fairness, low sec is \*way\* more dangerous than null sec. Maybe not right now with the blackout but there are far less carebears and far more hunters in low sec than there are in null sec, and you don't have vast intel networks to see what's coming and you can't slow them down with bubbles. But yeah, the money is in low sec.
---
Crit chance is independent of hit chance btw
---
Ruined.
---
&gt; The fastest way to destroy all those things, imo (and it appears you agree at least in part), is to kill local.
---
This wont fix it, how do you propose it does? They simply live under super-umbrellas, not risking eachothers in a direct stand up fight but using them as a defence against roaming gangs. Nothing will be lost by either side.
---
Yeah there's a YouTube video on it but basically it makes everything more rounded by adding geometry
---
yet goons have been talking big about hunters coming out to delve where they can drop all that super blubber all over them, whats the difference.
---
Another person who doesnt make a point against a singular issue, but simply doesnt want to listen to a reasoned proposal. Either pick aspects that you disagree with and provide a reasoning behind it, or continue your nonsense which doesn't really add value to anything.
---
It will simply lead to a proliferation of super-alliances within eve under super-cap umbrellas ie: more stagnation.
---
the player count is built right into the launcher, look at it, look at the last few months of saturday afternoons and fridays and notice the several thousand player dip.
---
Tbh m-o and BWF used to be hell camp when PL/PH where there, I remember BWF always had wreck all around the gate when PH lived there
---
So i'm going to approach this as a ELI5 style so it makes more sense.
---
Eve is a beach. The playerbase are the kids on this beach. CCP are the parents that bring the tools (buckets, shovels, etc) and moderate to make sure the kids are literally safe in rl.
---
The kids will do a couple of things. One will run around and make a  quick sandcastle. Then you have some who will kick the said sandcastle and run away laughing and screaming.
---
Did the kid who made the sandcastle deserve it? No. Did the ones who kicked it down have fun doing so? Hell yeah. Was there a reason of why they did it? You could sit them down and interrogate them, but at the end of the day, everyone is on a beach and want to have fun in their own way. Could the one kid make another castle again in a pinch? Sure enough. As he has to do is take the little bit of take and make it again.
---
Now Eve is a bit more complicated due to the mass amount of time and money it takes to make things such as titans- similar to hiring a professional sand sculpture with a year's worth of the kid's allowance- but at the end of the day, people enjoy building things. But also, kids like to kick down sand castles. Who wouldn't?
---
I'll close with a thought. A lot of Eve players start pretty small and industry based, and that is okay. I think it takes being in their shoes to moreso understand them. Most will in time, and some don't. It depends on what they enjoy. But remember, even though a rock on the tip of a sandcastle is mostly worthless, it doesn't mean that the other kids who see it won't want to take it and throw it in the ocean. 
---
After all, they don't call this game a 'sandbox' without a reason.
---
Hope this helps. Fly safe o7
---
I really hope I am not right, I fear I am.
---
And only cost 200mill !
---
I guess null is more fun in that regard lol. I feel I am doing decently in delve, not great but decent, and plenty of fleets is nice too
---
It is legitimately safer in nullsec with local than highsec in any of the big nullsec blocks, that is a blatant fact, not a meme. Well established intelligence channels, backup fleets, with ganking grps signficantly hindered make it this way. In Highsec its common to get cargo scanned down and popped depending on value, and you wouldnt have the intel to differentiate friend from foe in most cases. You cant even engage suspected foe until its on their terms. 
---
With local gone the intel is a lot foggier, making it significantly riskier to match the rewards they reap from nullsec.  
---
For smaller groups this change allows them to move more freely. Defense wise smaller grps usually arnt (and shouldnt be) spread thin across different systems because they cant handle that control, so naturally already being more concentrated in system(s) appropriate for their size actually is a benefit that many in larger blocs don't have as they often are spread thin with specific high traffic systems, or have big empty regions during certain timezones.
---
Nullsec is meant to have a balance of risk reward, currently that doesnt exist, so yes my version of risk tolerance seems to be more in line with 0 security space. You're arguments about industry collapsing are hyperbole - it will be shaken, which in my view is a good thing, and even then its possible it wont be shaken at all - which then would be a damn shame. 
---
To your playerbase stat: 
---
1) First couple days of many pve alts not logging on in nullsec is to be expected while people adjust to this - and seek more pvp on a pvp alt/main. That number means nothing until there is a bigger data pool. 
---
2) Summer in general brings steep drops in player count. A source on that stat would help understand how they have considered factors impacting that 15%. But as per #1, its still a useless stat until there is bigger data to pull from. 
---
3) regions usually full of bots have been empty since local started up, no idea on the % of bots on server pop., but itd be naive to think that doesn't show up in the player count stats
---
^ About as triggered as it gets. Big yikes
---
Bagged 2 supers so far.
---
Super umbrellas won't protect ISK making, not at the rate the giants have been going at it. I guess the monthly economic reports will show what damage is done, but is seems clear that CCP is just done with massive krabs stagnating the game. If this doesn't slow down the ISK, expect more attacks from CCP on krabbing. 
---
CCP has stated multiple times that ISK faucets are a massive issue and major alliances have stated many times that no war could ever bankrupt them. CCP needs to make war bankrupt alliances.
---
I just started playing again, and just got my first BattleCruiser set up, finally!  Should have my full on BattleShip soon and I am thrilled.  Then I see this and I realize how much more there is to this game, I am but a tadpole in a big ocean...
---
JB networks if anything helped that sort of content because it allowed more people to get to the "front".  I remember getting the enemy JB password and camping their bridges while my buddies fucked around their gatecamp and they trickled in.
---
What killed gatecamping was when everybody got caps.  Now if you sit still long enough you get fucked.

I am a new player who's only been playing for 25ish days. I fell in love with the game in the first week and dropped several hundred dollars in PLEX for Injectors, and the friends I made helped guide me to the ship I wanted, this ship. Money can make you a bigger tadpole.

More people than newbros need isk to PVP. And not everyone wants to math out spreadsheets for industry, when they can get the immediate gratification of ratting ticks. Many people would rather devote a minimal time ratting every so often than need to constantly maintain their industry or market or buyback, because many people far prefer the PVP aspect to the economic aspect.
---
but they don't deploy big game changing patches more frequently than 3 or 6 months - both of which are recurring subscriptions with a discount.
---
Ratters and whoever should only have to put up with this event for maybe a week more if that. It’s kinda like one of those weekends where u come into the game and have a party and go crazy then everything dies and goes back to normal. Think of it as a vacation. The crybabies aren’t here to pvp. They’re just here to rat and make isk and this is adding an extra step. But this kind of event is what a lot of pvpers have wished for a long time. WH space would be amazing if there were more ppl there. I might not even ever leave WH space if there were more ppl there. But there aren’t, so making null similar to wh space has been amazing because there have been ppl to kill and hunt. Those ppl just have to adapt for a short time or go do something else. Grab 10 friends and go entosis something of your neighbors and force them to come fight. Without outside tools there might be less dropping caps than usually and u will be surprised how much fun playing in the dark can be. We’ve been entosising in querious and getting some good fights. It was really weird. I was hunting in my t3c and we tackled another t3c on a gate that was hunting and they were too scared to drop so they disengaged and left. Less tools to research how many u will have to fight is great because that other t3c would’ve won if he had dropped even 2 other cloakies haha
---
I was the Tengu pilot, at least I got to call it an early night :D probably would've had my panther if you were patient enough to let it warp in and agress (couldn't jump because that system was our NS connection lol)
---
F1 F1 haha
---
All other issues of game mechanics and botting aside, that corp name sounds more at home in a cat show than space based MMO.
---
My mouse (corsair) has a thing where I can configure it to begin a macro cycle and never stop clicking or I can set it up to pulse click when I want it. It’s really fun
---
Nothing fun about seeing people cheat to get ahead. Even less fun when people want to downplay the reality that those beyond the great firewall condone cheating as a means to get ahead, no matter the collateral damage that is done to the game as a result
---
But I don't like capitals, and wish they weren't in the game.
---
I literally have only two hours tops per day on most weeks to get on eve. Somehow can still put in the time to make isk through passive activites, I learned those things because ratting is dumb, risky, and requires even more isk to invest in than marketing. You don't have to invest billions to make isk to keep yourself up. 
---
If people don't want to learn new things so that they can be more lazy in the long run, that sounds like a personal problem.
---
As long as they leave null, i dont care.
---
This is great
---
&gt; My question is, should I even bother buying one?
---
You're not easily going to find cheaper firepower in this game then a carrier at their price-point. You can likely make 120+ m per hour if you choose to go rat and some dozen hours later you'll have made a plex.
---
That being said there is competition for sites as CCP took a massive nerf bat to anomalies. Fully upgraded systems with pirate arrays are only going to support a couple such vessels without impinging upon isk/h.
---
The activity of ratting with carrier+ is about as boring as high sec missions with - with some dread spawns/escalations sprinkled in netting an additional 60-100m+. 
---
Honestly, nerfing anomalies as much as CCP did is stupid. The playerbase clamoring for it is stupid. The nerfs should have been to the super-fleet that jumps in to protect the carrier. Eve should have the tastiest rewards in the open to temp people to undock and retrieve them. There should be enough anoms spawning to satisfy anyone who would want to drink from the oasis, but it should be dangerous to where every time one of those gazelles drinking gets taken down.
---
The safety should have been the nerf.
---
Hackerman
---
Just resub an account to show CCP that this is something you’re interested in. That’s what I did
---
By "old days" I am talking 5-10 years back, by the way. I am not talking about recent BWF camps (which have also been decent content for some people and considerably better than other places). 
---
The old camps in entry null systems were a source of really good fights.
---
Whelp, reckon it is about time to grab the wallet lol!  Otherwise I can't fathom how long it would take me to get to that level.  All about them skills!  Thanks for the pro tip.  Don't suppose you still have the guide to get this ship?  I think I am in love with it ;-)
---
Ok thanks!
---
It's a 1% chance for wrecking shots, but chance to hit can go to much lower percentages.
---
Still surprised you guys kept assisting tbh
---
What time zone?
---
https://www.eveworkbench.com/tools/refinery no idea if this will help
---
&gt; Which is good I assume.
---
if gangs wouldn't go out and fight other gangs pre black out.. what makes you think they want to or are going to do it now?
---
If only CCP can make the heat map easier to read. You can tell the difference between once person in system and 10 .
---
OMG THIS IS SECRET KNOWLEDGE DELETE IT NOW
---
and this is why people turn to automation...
---
It’s the same as on here, thanks if you do!
---
if you want to use the map to your ''advantage'', first step would be to use the old one...
---
I WANT TO SEE THE WORL... NEW EDEN BURN !
---
Yeah, and that’s your preferred form of gameplay. EVE is an incredibly diverse game with many different interlocking gameplay styles, and that’s what makes it amazing.
---
Did you enrage the RNG gods and roll two simultaneous wrecking shots or something? Imp doesn't exactly have a ton of tank but it doesnt instapop to a single wrecking shot unless you were already below 1/3 shield
---
It is and it still exists, a lot of people have it turned off though.
---

---
If they run, they’re bots. If they don’t run, they’re ~~well-disciplined~~ broken bots
---
In all honesty, PvPers are amongst the most risk averse player group I have seen in this game. It might be all good for a day or 2 but in the long run nobody is going to fight. Which is what we are seeing today. People are bitching alot about NS but you can always get fights in Eve if you really want it. But people want all the advantages hence not much fighting.
---
AUTZ
---
mhmm. It is about the preference I think. I grew up on the new one. sooo... Yeah, kinda used to it now.
---
Killmail images &gt; zkill links.
---
Dont @ me.
---
So nothing provable just basically your flaming asshole?
---
It's called adapting, I don't have time to rat so guess what? I learned marketing. People complain that they want to rat but can't because they don't feel safe, guess what? They can adapt or learn some things on the side while CCP deals with this gimmeck of 'local blackout'. I literally spend 30-40 mins a day tops with ONE spreadsheet to track some things in the market. How much time does a ratter put in just to make 200m isk? 
---
Eve being a sandbox is cool and all, but why are you austist so hell bent on making yourself crazy over ratting. Be smart.
---
Gentlemen
---
CCP will usually give you a one-off teleport to a safe location in circumstances like this. But as far as I know you only get it once. So use it wisely.
---
as a fellow lowsec resident...
---
I look forward to the day that we get our own blackout.
---
I’m not sure what you’re trying to say here. Like what’s the point you’re aiming for. If you’re trying to convince me not to rat, that’s a fool’s errand, because I already don’t rat. Further, my point is not that people should be safer while ratting, quite the opposite. I’d recommend rereading my original comment in this thread, because you may have thought I had a different one.
---
Just calculate from uncompressed ore.
---
That's fine. Do you have a tool for that?
---
Thanks, but I'm looking for the other way around.
---
the new one is utter garbage. just open up the old map with ''pilots in space'' selected and compare it to the new one.
---
you can see on the first sight where areas are populated and which pockets are worth checking on the old map. on the new one you have to mouse over every single system because theres literally no difference between 1 and like 30 ''pilots in space''.
---
i dont get how someone could have though. yeah, thats great! ship it!
---
Uncompressed ore is traded more in Jita, so the value on fuzzworks should be more accurate.
---
Well just follow its requirements, but it's one of those ships that you absolutely need to follow its mastery suggestions to get good performance. Don't ignore the masteries.
---
You're contradicting yourself.  Why do you want an accurate value for the loss if not to shame and/or bloviate.  Apparently you *do* obsess over it.  Its mere existence has changed your behavior.
---
Just use the old map
---
Compressed ore is as well. Fuzzworks is inefficient. It says it needs like 1.2b of compressed ore for 600m of minerals with 84% efficiency.
---
This.    
---
I feel WAY safer tucked away inside my wormhole than going out to HS to sell/pickup supplies.
---
Woah. STL?
---
Impossible to tell who will win from the get go?
---
Compressed ore doesn't have realistic estimated value even ingame.
---
You summed it up pretty much right here. 
---
&gt; thirteen citadels 
---
They didn't really have more balls, they just had less safe places to run. Stations were expensive, POSes needed passwords. If someone came to bust your camp, you either left the system and ran down the pipe to a safe spot, warped around system and logged off hoping boredom would allow you to go back, or took the fight at the gate if you felt it was a decent a brawl.   
---
Now every system has a dozen safe spots they can go to, catch a tether, or dock up. Citadels have created a huge safety net that didn't exist before. So nah not really more balls.
---
Have you tried undocking and typing in the chat system?
---
If this is real...you will regret this for the rest of your life. What a dumb decision, IMO.
---
So you are saying that more stuff gets destroyed in HS than in NS? Or even player kills? Thats fking BS and you know it which makes it into a meme. I lived a long time in HS. I died once or twice. Comparing it to null is meh.
---
You dont seem to get that the rewards are not enough to warrant higher risk. Maybe you dont know other ways of making isk but for other people who do.
---
Move more freely? Defending themselves better? Also a meme. No logic behind it since if you dont have enough players for defence you cant do shit. At all. And smaller groups cant cover all TZs.
---
Again, you are making a hyper assumption. If more are saying you are wrong which the numbers seem to suggest. Then perhaps you are in the wrong here?
---
My argument about industry collapse is based on your joke about how ADMs dont matter. If you have ever been in a defense fleet you would know that low ADMs are fucking cancerous. And without your industrial/ratting base all those elite PvPers would burn out in a matter of months. And that goes for everything else. You know how much work goes into maintaining an empire? Do you even realise how many people work for it? You got no clue dude, you just see "ooh easier kills".
---
You are correct, nothing definitive can be said about the stats. But that hasnt stopped you from saying this is better for the game right? You cant say anything either because the lack of data. Yet you are still saying it. You cant have the cake and eat it.
---
But Occams razor dude. If you implement a change and within 2 days see a significant change in something then it is highly unlikely that those 2 are not connected. And the easier explanations is usually the best, i.e., people complaining about this change and all of the sudden people not logging on. 
---
You are assuming that people first off are pvping. Meh, its a big assumption. And that they wouldnt be using alts in it even bigger.
---
Last week was also summer, and the week before and so on. 
---
Fairly certain that dont account for 15%. Besides, botters are about. Its naive to think that they will stop for anything.
---
And in none of this have you mentioned the fact that alot of players came back for this event. So the actual drop is even bigger than 15%, and the ones who returned are most likely gonna leave soon because literally nothing good has changed and lesser content. 
---
You will see soon. But CCP has shat on many things the last couple of years and it wouldnt surprise me if they kept this up a while. It is after all the same corp that refuses to deal with the real problems.
---
First rule of EVE: Drag local channel to it's own tall ass box. 
---
Set list as: Show Compact Member List
---
Click in the portrait list box. 
---
Hit CTRL+A
---
Now all local people are highlighted. 
---
When someone new jumps in, they are easier to spot. 
---
You're welcome. 
---
CCP: keep deleting local.
---
You should, because they will still supply RMT and fuck with the economy
---
they've done 2 huge changes in the last 3 weeks, and Chat has broken randomly with no notice multiple times in the last year and a half.
---
&gt;Is a solo player having a carrier just ridiculous
---
Yes, but this is a video game. Doing ridiculous things is not only allowed, its encouraged!

---
Ok and? It's still not fun.
---
It was a bug with the DDs, it was unintended, but still happened.
---
Be aware that people will pop your ship to take your loot even in highsec so you need to know how much loot you can move safely in different ship classes.
---
Happy brexit friend
---
My bittervet isn't going to be cured with changing local chat.  Sadly I have advanced bittervet syndrome. Most diagnosed with this usually terminal ailment quit Eve forever. I have hope that someday a cure can be found .
---
And that is?
---
Bro I are those like runescape?
---
So far, it only cost them 10% of there normal log ins
---
'04 here, also re-upped for this. I remember accumulating and then copying (and probably absolutely fucking the server over every time) entire sets of bookmarks for Catch-Feyth-Paragon-Tenerifis everytime we brought someone new into the alliance. Someone not having them was just toast once we had tackling intys. Fun times.
---
Blackout is a good step in the right direction. Warp to 0 is OK now that bubbles are so easy to deploy. Welcome back!
---
You need to have a verb in a sentence.
---
As for #3, just don't loot all the random trash then? Or make a filter that shows everything except ammo and scripts, although that leaves you with any other ammo you have looted.
---
CCP really should rework laser crystal ammo and making them function like triglavian plasma charges
---
Watching all those partially used crystals stacking up in my hanger drives me nut
---
Srp sounds like a poor people thing
---
Or CCP can just change the heat map to be easier to read.
---
Squizz, what about players who do not use Zkill for intell? Players who have given you ISK for add free, etc.. Players who enjoy keeping track of their progress? Did you factor your decision to black out Zkill with all players in mind? Or did you just decide to blackout because why not? Sounds like you are jumping on the CCP Bandwagon and not taking all play styles into consideration.
---
Well that’s embarrassing.
---
Lmao you must be new here
---
Oh yes please. I too have an ammo container, like 2-3b worth probably. At least used crystals could be valued at 0 to sop teasing me with all that potential space money.
---
At the very least give us a way to repair the crystals. Like some BPs that take in two damaged crystals and spit out a repaired crystal of the same type.
---
*imagine being in unspoken alliance and actually thinking these things*
---
It's too bad I haven't heard a single instance of an actual PVP fleet engaging another PVP fleet and instead a bunch of solo roaming pussies engaging AFK botters
---
Probably won't, it'll just push people to consolidate more instead of spreading out :&lt;
---
Also more "do not show this again" checkboxes. Also make them work consistently, because currently some of them (like the one for the "Buy Skill" dialogue) don't work, at least for me.
---
I shouldn't need to confirm if I want to board my corvette every damn time I try. It's not as though the consequences of accidentally doing so are particularly dire.
---
That's a cool VIdeo.
---
That would be Finland
---
He’s proposing that high reward activities should come with a higher risk. If a group wants to take part in these activities, they should have to have the infrastructure to support them, either through good intel networks or good standing defense fleets.
---
Can't make a jump clone in LS or HS to find other shit to do?
---
Can't take some cloaky ships into a wormhole and lowman some stuff?  
---
We get it Null Ticks are dank, but its not like there isn't anything out there for solo or lowman to do.
---
Heck maybe if you network yourself in these other areas of space you might find folks interested in coming to backbone your off timezones so they can share in the dank nullsec ticks while your guys are sleeping, and afford you protections while your current core are not online.
---
This is the goal of the blackout, this is why everyone was so excited for it. Nore spaceship violence all around.
---
At this point we are really stretching the definition of 'delayed local'
---
More like faction welfare amirite
---
karen-"thats an interesting tattoo, what does it mean"
---
moldy- "its my daughters dob"
---
karen- "in what language"
---
Moldy- \*pauses\* "triglavian"

Karen- "oh nice youre bilingual!?!, is that african or something"

Moldy- "oh no its from this game i play"

Bye

Out of Focus (Odin's Call).
---
You complain about RNG but you have ton of abyssal modules fitted - that is pure RNG.
---
CCP only enacts change we desire by constantly pestering them about it.   
---
Only took them 12 years to finally nerf AFK Cloaking.
---
Exactly, ammo is a common drop. I want to tag my own ammo, and clear out the rest.
---
I wonder if they turn off if your cap is empty.
---
You are Actually just trying to bait people at this point right? There were several large structures of Brothers of tangra that died during all of that. There was no noticeable pushback other than the couple of fleets that pants abandoned, up until pandemic horde started showing up.
---
I’m fine with him delaying killmails or something instead for the sake of making it less powerful as an intel tool. I’d miss it if it was gone completely though. Seeing your killboard go full green is fun and satisfying.
---
Except it has changed....you going to engage that Mega that just landed on your gate if local shows 50 neutral/hostile in system. No you going to run and hide as soon as you see local spike that hard. Without local though that Mega might just be in the wrong place at the wrong time, so you engage him, frag him, and then get memed or moonwalk when his 49 friends land 30 seconds behind him.
---
where are you getting kills? I dont believe any of this until zkill comes back
---
Been using that one. It’s not as intuitive and it’s a little harder to read, but there’s a lot of cool features. I don’t know if dotlan does this or not but I like that eveeye will follow you on the map as you move through space. I’ll occasionally roam two characters on two separate monitors so tabbing back and forth on one to dotlan and trying to figure out where I was on the map to navigate, especially when leading a small gang, was kind of a headache.
---
didn’t like 4 sotiyos die lmao
---
I mean the problem is that no one is getting engaged not that we can't tackle anything, but thats also true :D
---
thanks for taking the time to check it out i have more i will be uploading slowly..
---
hope your having a great summer o7
---
Bjorn's laugh. :D
---
They’re already like that.
---
&gt; but is seems clear that CCP is just done with massive krabs stagnating the game
---
How are krabs stagnating the game? There is a common misconception here that krabs dont PvP or do content, they do. So how does isk-making lead to stagnation? 
---
&gt;CCP needs to make war bankrupt alliances.
---
I agree with this, but there are far better ways to do this that doesn't involve causing more people to flock towards the giant-cap-umbrellas meaning those alliances become less likely to be able to be bankrupted. It doesn't fix anything, infact it creates a bigger issue and greater stagnation.
---
@bruhmoments
---
definitely have had the most delicious banquet of actual small gang fights where like...WE BE SHEWTING THEM AND THEY BE SHEWTING US! 
---
BLACK OUT FOREVER. 
---
Also....take the fucking bridge team.
---
I would have prefered to see what is going on. I bet the killboard is more dry than usual and it will get worse by the day. The blackout is ether a troll by CCP or the most stupid thing ever.
---
Once they are fitted abyssals aren't RNG at all.
---
Same here. It started after the new character rendering was introduced.
---
that's because most people that rat in null are in nullblocs, and when you get to that point its far easier and less effort to box miners, supers need keeps as well to use the toon for other things. Its far more common in renters or groups that live in buffer zones, but those are few and far between nowadays.
---
They used to have it, but it got deleted lmao
---
killahpee keeps a fiend in the SMA of his titan. Lol.
---
Can you message me your fit and possibly skills? I will be on Sunday at about 20:00 EvE time to give you more advice in game if still needed.
---
Wasn't there exactly this post yesterday?
---
No, it's not just the mindset. No local means you can set logoff traps, it means if they're not paying 100% attention you can get cloaky stuff (including tackle) into system without them seeing, it means people don't bail out when they see +10 in local, and it means you never know exactly what the other side is bringing.
---
The new system combats risk aversion by making hunters less able to identify the risks, therefore encouraging them to be more reckless if they want to get fights, or send people out to gather intelligence. Either scenario will lead to more fights
---
fitting is actually quite tight with abyssal AB/MSE
---
Here take my updoot
---
No, we did disband. And a lot of good men quit. A lot of other good men went to frt to not become what we fear to be the most.
---
Can you also make structures give no stats, IE keep structure kms but make them not count towards isk efficiency?  I think that would be more of a incentive to make people pvp as well.
---
*citation needed
---
Looks like a lot of just ganks. Got any real pvp kills?
---
Ship window lights on a lot of the ships flicker too when the ship is damaged. I first noticed it on the claw and thought it was a nice little detail.
---
no i don't, but Killah Bee propably does
---
goon paint sniffer talking shit to other people, get back in the ferox and press f1 please :joy:
---
And these high reward activities are what exactly? The isk in NS isnt that great honestly. People are highly overestimating what the average player makes per hour and everyone is focused on multiboxing Rorqs. 
---
And I understand what hes talking about. But hes missing the point that the things you pointed out require joining blobs. Im saying thats bad. We shouldnt force people to join blobs. Thats what got us here in the first place.
---
Sarum!!!
---
yes killahbee, killahgoon, killahafk, etc..
---
You're kidding, right?
---
don't know why you are getting downvoted, this is common knowledge for anyone who's been using it.
---
"Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.."
---
this post made me want to boot Sins of a Solar Empire up and just coat my frontline star systems with mines lol
---
That hasn't been my experience in any way shape or form, but maybe it's because I live in wormholes and lowsec, where people are actively looking to fight and rarely give a fuck if they die.
---
Compared to what? The isk in nullsec is considerably better than what you’ll make in highsec or lowsec for tasks of the same category. Mining is better, ratting is better (excluding incursions which are their own thing and much harder than normal ratting) and exploration is considerably better. Also, intel channels absolutely don’t require joining blobs. It just requires a couple cloaky alts on gates and rolling wormholes if they open, which is something that’s pretty necessary either way.
