They would understand if you explain how Eve gives you a lot of time to alt tab and simultaneously play on your Minecraft roleplay server.
---
Back in Med school i used to hang out with this bro, we would make pizzas, get hammered, and play games. We had side by side TVs/monitors, I’d play some single player games while he’d eat, he’d play some EVE while id eat, all i remember is something about the Russians and that we’d drive around transporting his loot trying not to die, and then looking at the SFW EVE porn subreddit at 3am
---
Kestrels are player made so they should have a doomsday. Thank you.
---
Three weeks if you do it right
---
Still same corp and rig's installed to...............Who are these people?.............Amateurs?
---
Couldn’t have happen to a nicer group of guys.
---
Better odds than fighting goons.
---
my spreadsheet would be off by a really small margin, i would only notice because you can reprocess into million units or more
---

---
if the error is significant enough to cause a problem, it might help if you can go further into detail of how you calculate
---
Any of the major ones, Goons runs most of eve so they are probably the safest bet, TEST still owns some space, im a wormhole player so i usually dont keep up w null politics just know that these mega alliances dont usually just take your corp in as an alliance member, you and your friends would either have to move to one of their corps or you could move yourself and install a JC in hi or low where you can go play with your friends
---
CCP missed a huge opportunity for those new jump gates to be big content drivers
---
So the Art dev team is the only ones doing anything??? Or did I miss somthing?
---
was ratting not krabbing ever?
---
The 5 minutes number is really not that out of the realm of reality the only number that was exaggerated was the time it takes to kill the keepstar guns because reality is your small gang just isn't gonna do it.
---
Keep in mind most cruiser gangs could just tank the guns, it's only like 3k dps like 4 logi's and your easily fine, like if your camping a jump bridge you would most of the time just pop anything that points and then use logi to keep your cruisers running ( again having 4 logi pilots for a 20 man cruiser gang seems not impossible to achieve ratio ), yeah i known a POS could have ECM and blabla but you could see all this without playing a hacking mini-game so as you landed you could deal with the pos mods that where a problem leave the others up and do your camping thing ( this is also why historically most alliances adviced members not to travel truth jump bridges blind ).
---
You get that it’s all memes and roleplay to get people taking it seriously upset, right?
---
Actually I spend most of my time in EvE actively avoiding other players, and most people/corpmates I've seen quit did so because bs mechanics forced them to interact with players or the game in ways they simply weren't interested in. Like a wardec they couldn't fight against, or an Invasion or FOB or some other fleet content they had no interest in showed up in system and shut down their mining until our PvE division cleaned up the FOB or the invasion/incursion blew over.
---
thanks for your solution and addition to this thread. It seems very solid.
---
I'm in this Picture &amp; I don't like it
---
First time flying a Cerb fleet, outnumbered 4 to 1, I'd say PIRAT did pretty well. Especially if you take off 2.6b for the citadel, making it 1.6b vs 3.9b with almost a 6:1 KDR. Hopefully this will become a regular occurrence, it was a lot of fun :)
---
I thought a 3.6B Golem would be able to solo trigalvans. When the alarms started going off, it was at that moment I realized I f**led up.
---
Had fun though
---
Well... At least CCP is owned by a Korean Company...
---
While 70% of blizzard game players are Chinese
---
Unless you work Sort, no.
---
Aha, now I have a new name for my ship to disconnect them with.
---
I haven't met them yet, and I don't get this even if it is rp. Why would people try to piss off each other is beyond me. I try to avoid any conflict, anyway, so it doesn't matter all that much. It's like flat earth activists. They are out there, they annoy the hell out of me, but it is good to be far away from this nonsense and I hope they will dissipate over time.
---
I agree with you to an extent, but still... Force an antisocial pve player to fleet up and, in EvE, many will either try to find some way to solo the content or just move on to greener pastures. Not true for everyone... Just for a sizable chunk of casual solo pve'ers
---
Fun was had?
---
&gt; Will they expire?
---
no
---
&gt; "limited time" tag
---
means they will be given out only once, ever
---
&gt; What can I do with "The Yulai Siege"?
---
read its description and throw back into the hangar 
---
no practical use and won't be worth any significant isk anytime ever, but might be nice to keep around as a miscellaneous thing if you are into it
---
Where is this sov map? I like it.
---
I was drunk one one night (really really dunk) and thought I would gate camp in low sec. So I set up and get ready to kill some people and then it happens. A iteron v decloaks so I lock them up scramble and start shooting. All of a sudden concord shows up and thats when I knew I had done fucked up. The iteron pilot and I both had a good laugh after I explained what had just happen. He gave me a GF in local before leaving the system.
---
you sure talk big game about knowing how to find content for a 600 man corp whose first 10 zkill pages basically consist of test coalition fleets and has the most used ships listed as:
---
Muninn 	523
---
Loki 	118
---
Sabre 	75
---
Stiletto 	53
---
Jackdaw 	41
---
since both of those things are impossible, and people have been calling it 'flipping' for years
---
no, it doesn't
---
I'm not really sure what folks are trying to accomplish with this. VPNs that Chinese players must be very unusual if they can pierce the Great Firewall to play Eve but are mysteriously unable to block ship names and chat, triggering whatever mythical censorship flags that exist.
---
I hope you are genuinely as sweet and naive as you are coming across, and not young before dealing with folks gets you jaded.
---
But for your sake, know that Eve as a game is like it is and people will steal, kill, and take advantage in every situation.
---
both are mindbogglingly boring and shouldn't ever be the base for gameplay. My comment had the intent of showing that they're both garbage, not that both are good, it was mostly a response to you mentioning strat ops as something they'd do instead
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Wormhole ratting IS dangerous. By its very nature it's dangerous. WHs aren't gates. They can spawn at any time anywhere in the system and within 5 seconds 50 people can be jumping through it to gank your ass.
---
Says the guy in Frat.
---
We do more pvp than you ever would.
---
I mean, I've dropped my carrier 3 times in the last 24 hours.
---
I really think we need more data, are many/most Eve players on the spectrum?
---
You risk a dread that is what, 1.5 bil after insurance, for making several bil an hour? And what are the odds of someone rolling into your c5/c6 hole?
---
If you're going to make ratting dangerous, have to make all kind of it dangerous
---
HOLY SHIT
---
Wormholes can be a lot of fun for scale scale fighting.
---
Did you gild yourself?
---
your fw is showing
---
Grateful for the content. ty
---
Yeah, it seems he have the ill already, just need to put him into the game
---
do we know how many of the decs dropped?
---
And dead.
---
Are they actually using VPNs to connect to EvE? Heck, last I understood, they're even required to use their government ID just to get online.
---
Could also be government mandated local backdoors into the PCs themselves. Who knows at this point.
---
Suitonia for CSM!!!! oh wait
---
I've only heard of it recently. I've played off and on since 2005, last login around 2013.
---
Blinked for too long, turns out I landed on the gate that was being camped. Panicked, thought I jumped through into a gate. Started burning away, booshed myself off, forgot I had reps and turns out drones keep on chewing you beyond drone control range. I think the camp guys were quite amused at the sight of a Magus hitting itself.
---
Another case - got myself a dscan spot to monitor U-Q pipe campers. Decided to boosh and cloak (don’t ask). Alt tabbed away, tabbed back to see Sabre landing on me. Had about 10 event accelerators in cargo. Congratulated the guys with a lottery win and went to sleep.
---
But none of the balancing that applies to stargates applies to them, either. You can't anchor a keepstar within DD range of a gate, you get aggression timers for shooting around a gate, you can HIC point a capital to stop it jumping, and most stargates don't jump you as far so you can't use them to get across the cluster fatigue-free in almost no time.
---
That you would see this in a game thats dying because of dumb shit like this is funny.
---
Can someone explain it so it makes sense?
---
Doing nothing. Killing NPCs. Botters probably didnt notice they died.
---
All?
---
After I read one of the EVE books (I think it was Empyrean Age), I wanted to do a tour of all the highsec spots from the book. I had just warped to Luminare in my interceptor and was flying around, and all of the sudden all these faction police showed up and blew me the fuck up.
---
I completely forgot I was like -5 standings. 
---
Oops.
---
Tried it 3 years ago for a week and stopped. Picked it back up 2 days ago, im still lost.
---
&gt;When you kill a couple and come back to the system and see pods warping to/from the sites you know for sure you have a bot
---
Those pesky hard-to-detect AI bots! Is there anything CCP can do to combat this highly elusive menace?
---
Ironic that I just put it in my bio today haha
---
No. Buy plex, sell it, do something fun in your time.
---
My rorq is gathering dust and is likely to remain a reminder of my stupidity only.
---
What is the absolute minimum requirement? I'd be surprised if anyone wasn't on the spectrum, eve player or otherwise.
---
Allowing them access to western servers without CCP doing word filtering of all the offensive words would be a crime ( and on the other CCP the one without video games, cares about ). 
---
VPNs and bypassing there internet filtering is a crime yeah but it's similar to how piracy is illegal like China is notorious for its well creative enforcement of laws in the first place so a lot here depends on how much the government cares. 
---
People using an illegal VPN provider to play eve, not such much use that same VPN to run a blog and there a lot more worried.
---
Then left.
---
+1 Init
---
No. Its hard to get rid of 100%, but that isnt necessary.
---
&gt;it’s hard to determine whether or not they’re bots or just some guy turbo krabbing
---
Yeah, look at these AI bots that dont even check if they are in a pod:

r/iamverysmart
---
Well, I have my fair share of dumb losses, this is the one that springs to my mind first.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/72350833/
---
I was gating my rokh from UALX to 08- last year, I had gated a few other ships that did not fit into my corp mates capital ship, including a maelstrom, but while gating my rokh, I saw an active cyno, this was the Tempest you see on the KM, the cyno was on a Fortizar, and for some reason I decided to try kill it. I was unable to really apply good damage at 100KM without boosts, so it was slow going. A few minutes into the "fight" a friendly VNI showed up and decided to come help. A few seconds after that, somebody got in the gunner seat of the fort and tackled me, I died in 2 missile volleys from the fort. The VNI remained and was able to secure the kill. https://zkillboard.com/kill/72350844/ 
---
Isk negative, and pretty pointless, but there you go. This is the dumb losses thread after all.
---
Fair enough.
---
Nope because there are still actively legacy decs with no warHQ because of CCP
---
went to Work traveling for free basically. Sorry there's more to life then EVE you mouth breathing mongoloid. literally drunk from day 1. undock several hundred times now and yall managed to get 2. Logic? Tell 3Tears he should drink the KoolAid now. Dont mind the grind anyway. will just blob you guys out everytime. and farm salt in local. :)
---
hey buddy no problem! anytime we can help out let us know as we're pretty good at this kind of thing.
---
also i hope you've been having a fun holiday monster killing krabs - they've got thick skins but once you neut them a bit they're quite juicy on the inside!
---
I dont see how having less projection would result in that. Why do you think that?
---
then again you guys claim to not care but post on reddit every chance you get. anchor more plz. will keep us busy til us or someone evicts you from Cache
---
v-video games? L-like Halo?
---
I hope not. It's really disappointing to me to see blizzard kowtow.
---
That's me when I aggressively turn the pages of a book.
---
I'm a grandmaster at PI. Have an upvote
---
Calm down pospy
---
For the amount of people that were dec'd through it, this thing should have had a price tag of 100 billion.
---
Well yeah 8-9 says in your still gonna be lost bud. Btw join a teaching Corp they can help alot
---
&gt;Are they actually using VPNs to connect to Tranquility?
---
maybe scan memory to see whether a couple specific programs are running ....
---
enemy fleet warped away as i launched my bomb, stopped caring about getting safe, and mwd'd into my own bomb

Two hours ago
---
One of my guys finds a dreadnought ratting in a C5. So we grab Sabres and move in for the catch. First Sabre goes in, bubbles, starts burning a ping. My orders are to warp in second and immediately burn a ping
---
When we land, all of the larger ships are gone but there's still maybe a dozen sleeper frigates on site. I land, I start burning, and *immediately* the entire frigate ball switches aggro to me, points me, and spends 2 minutes chasing me down before finally catching up, webbing, and killing me.
---
And at that point the dread finished slowboating out of the bubbles and warped off.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Mostly this was frustrating because I got to spend a solid 2 minutes watching my death slowly approaching and knowing that there was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent it because sleeper frigates outrun Sabres and have really long point range.
---
i mean good for them that they realized everytime they undock to do something about it they get farmed.
---
This entire video could have been about how SMA and Darwin are getting BTFO by 15 dudes
---
But you can’t take it off because if you did killing your fleet would have been the objective. Everyone was focused on citadel.
---
Decided to cruise around HS with my new Proteus shot a MTU then shot the wreck I'd made.  Concord has strange rules.
---
When I went to lowsec for the first time I thought the Stratios that decloaked next to me was coming to give me some advice.  I waved to him in chat his drones waved back.
---
A cyclone fleet? at least 10 points for style
---
They were fighting goons
---
we flew ships shot at stuff got shot eve is always fun
---
Thanks dude. Love your vids!
---
it was goons and init.
---
Only meme on this sub to make me laugh in a while 10/10
---
I'll look into what they do pvp wise if any. Thanks
---
Lol. Who needs falcon+curses when you have the almighty Kiki? Psh. Also.... plenty of people will even 1v1 you. You just have to get them to agree to it beforehand. Try to breeze through... attempts will be made to catch you. 🤷‍♂️😂
---
What it will actually do is encourage the huge null blocks to steamroll everyone smaller than them nearby for loot.
---
Took a fight in a 5b machariel, it was challenge. But I forgot cap boosters. Died in like 30 seconds.
---
Later, 1b armageddon, I landed in the enemy bubble and deployed drones, started recording, and game crashed
---
Yeah boyeee my alt did this :D
---
\&gt; Those structures that are worthwhile to kill are in wormholes with their "loot pinatas" and there are groups that go around bashing them to collect the payment. 
---
These loot pinatas exist in k-space as well. In fact they're likely easier to find and get to than any given wormhole structure since the starmap gives you hints. It may not be the assets in someone's personal hangar, but considering the trillions of isk going through these structures on a monthly basis, there is plenty of loot to go around. 
---
However, even if loot dropped in k-space as it did in wh, it does nothing for all of those structures that have little to nothing of value in them. Which is a lot of them, especially the small ones.
---
\&gt;.&gt;
---
Tell us a cool story. The KM is pretty tame.
---
Couple weeks ago on an op I was flying a Kiki and wanted to see how my damage spooled up against my logi alt. Instant criminal and KO’d by concord. 
---
I was in highsec. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77269811/
---
The cans in a sleeper data/relic site (any class) are pretty easy to hack (green-difficulty).  There's one can that has a different name, it has the most valuable loot (it has hull fragments / subsystem fragments for T3 production - they are fairly large in volume).  The other 10-20 cans have mostly cheap stuff (some sleeper salvage, rarely a T3 piece).  But as noted, until all of them are hacked the site doesn't despawn, at least not for a long time, which will stop new sites from spawning.
---
The cans in a pirate relic site (only in show up in C1-C3 wormholes) are much more valuable.  There will be green/yellow/red difficulty cans to hack, and you will benefit from T2 hacking modules and hacking-bonused ships for these sites.  The pirate data sites are basically the same, but less valuable on average.
---
The salvage is pretty easy.  A T1 salvage destroyer with some salvage tackle rigs and T1 salvagers will do the job (you want Salvaging IV), a Noctis will be a little faster/more convenient, but it's not necessary.  None of the salvage is very valuable compared to the blue loot (like the salvage is \~5% of the site value).
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Ok, I hunted for 8 hours. Finally found this Raven.. I fought it for 3 hours.. I told the guy that I would hold him until downtime (like over 10 hours). While I was fighting him a stratios came and tried to help him and got concorded. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77393306/ ... Then after 3 hours he gave up and quit the game.
---
I see absolutely nothing of notice. Just bug and graphics fixes.
---
I thought init was independent of goons and weren't goons themselves? What's the narrative these days?
---
I like it
---
And null shall pay for it.
---
Cool meme.
---
RIP EVE Central
---
Full discourse for the OP. 
---
Hull pen and solo PvP and mutually exclusive. The also goes the same for competency, giving good fights and typing GF in local.
---
it was nearly 3b, and all the wars out of it were dropped. 
---
go back to not posting
---
Oh yeah, I’ve killed a number that do that. The kicker is when you wipe out a whole system full and then just see like 6 of them in pods still warping to sites for the rest of the day.

First off, skill progression in EVE doesn't work like in other MMOs. In EVE, skills are trained at a constant rate (that can be increased with implants and remapping) regardless of whether you're online or not. The upside of this is that if you only play for a few hours a day you can continue to progress in the game. The downside of this is that it can take weeks or months to catch up to experienced players in certain areas of the game.
---
EVE is for all intents and purposes not a F2P game. It's more like a P2P game with a very generous free trial. Free players (also known of as Alphas) are limited to 5Mn skillpoints from training and a maximum of 20Mn skillpoints total, train skills at half speed, and don't have access to every skill. Alpha clones are essentially designed to give you an introduction to EVE and enough to play with to let you decide if you want to subscribe or not, but they're by no means designed to be used indefinitely. A lot of people say you can have fun as an alpha, and that is true, but you're going to be severely limited in the things you can do and the ships you can fly. EVE is not a F2P game, it's a P2P game.
---
EVE does have its P2W elements, same with any other game. It doesn't have blatant P2W (ie. buying "premium ammunition" or "premium ships"), but you can purchase PLEX with real money and convert that PLEX to ISK, the in-game currency, and then buy things with it. PLEX is used to buy cosmetics, game time, and some items like skill extractors, and in theory you can subscribe an account without spending a penny by just buying PLEX on the in-game market. 
---
That being said, you can easily just drop $100+ on PLEX, convert it to ISK, and buy a bunch of blingy stuff. But in EVE, there is no such thing as an absolute "best ship" or "best equipment", it varies based on the situation and your $100+ worth of blingy ship can be easily destroyed (permanently) by some idiot in a T1 that simply brought a better ship for the engagement. So EVE isn't so much pay-to-win as it is pay-for-better-odds, and dropping a lot of money (or ISK) on a ship is no guarantee you'll beat someone who hasn't dropped that same money.
---
Eve is not a game you will get much out of without a significant time/money investment.  Unless, you are cool with not ever being very good.
---
This is hard to answer.. Alphas can do anything important from scanning to battleships.  Casual and eve have a funny relationship.. Eve takes more player skill than it appears on the surface. More time to learn how the game works than just picking a ship aand getting "the best fit" the more you play the more you understand it. More informed choices you can make.
---
To adress PTW tho. Its not.. If anything its pay to accelerate with plex to isk to injectors. Or pay past the grind. Best ship never means you always win. Baring a few glaring issues its generally not. But as an alpha you can use them also so its fine.. The biggest issue is how easy you can get into capitals with them. Or a fresh indy alt. Nothing for a lowly alpha to worry about.
---
One of the key mechanics of EvE is you get skill points while logged off, so you can log off after your two hours once a week and come back to a more advanced character.
---
A FTP character has some limits on what ships you can fly, but you can certainly have fun within them - you can do exploration, ship combat (*), low end mining and industry (nb cannot fly specialised mining ships) and generally futz around and have fun.
---
And you can transition back and forth between FTP and monthly subs.
---
(*) NB The 'one on one gudfites' are a myth, and expect to get blown up a lot. But cheap frigates are cheap, and you can blow them up by six packs once you figure out how to make pretty crappy money.
---
Not sure. Terrible place.

To misquote the best line from Predator 2: "I don't think they give a shit."

As casual as you want it to be. Just don't mix up casual with lazy, that's not the same thing.

Maybe they suddenly realized how fun actual pvp is.
---
What drones did it have?
---
Lol, consequences.
---
How many wars have been ended by this going down?
---
For a group like PIRAT this is inconsequential and for smaller groups the new mechanics expose them to no risk at all of losing a HQ.
---
Structures timers need to be shortened for there to be consequences at all. No option at all to end wars before a structure timer is finished.
---
its literally the most casual mmo by far if you want to play like 99% of people, there's no practice needed or execution requirements beyond at least pretending to have some semblance of brain activity. Things can get more complicated once you deviated from the nullbab bloc linemember/paperpusher, but that's gonna vary on what you wanna do

---
Ahh dailies. How long lasted that. 4-5 days?

If you are an already established player, with already a reserve of ISK (ingame currency) and/or fitted ships, you can be a casual for sure. Its actually the best way to enjoy the game. A new player as casual? Nah. Unless you go Omega from the start, able to train faster and access to Omega skills, you’ll probably hate the game in a week.
---
&gt;One is where on the scale of F2P to P2W does EVE fall, and two, title.
---
there is no p2w.
---
but the f2p is just a trial account.
---
it's a susbcription MMO.
---
Awesome. Thank you very much for all the info!
---
I used to gank miners in Nakugard and surrounding systems.  
---
  
---
One day I warped my astero scout to sun, and forgot to cloak.  
---
Got ganked 5 min later :)
---
Was semi drunk, jumped a hurricane into bosena for a fight on the gate, promptly died because I never fit any mods.
---
i ALMOST like a 400mil gila in a T3 abyssal... because I entered the site like 5 minutes before downtime, not realizing.
---
I got out with probably 1 second left (entered warp tunnel with 15, but australian ping...), got "cluster is shutting down" while still in a black screen.
---
I got screenshots on my laptop but cant be bothered opening it right now
---
i feel like being high is a good time to set safety to yellow
---
Nah yall got it wrong..... Its because the game sucks....

I don't see you making content of stepping up and FCing. Leave the guy alone.

---
Is this from line member #250 of random alliance or snuff bait?
---
Honestly if CCP censored some shit in chat and got rid of all the bots, I'd be okay with it. But that's about the only tradeoff.
---
probably one of the retards from test that they let in their fleet
---
our english is way worse
---
So who won
---
Not ours, we called him a poopyhead on our side.
---
Fuck
---
The superior Pen is and Snuff out
---
I Bet this is the TEST retard.
---
31 and 29...
---
In the most recent MER, Branch had more ratting bounties than Delve. Granted, goons are deployed, but it was still fairly close even when they weren't deployed.
---
Only way I can see you able to make a living in HighSec PI is gunning nothing but Factory worlds and owning your POCOs and being able to defend them. But even then you'd be only scraping by on a thin profit margin because of having to buy raw material or P2s
---
First ever fleet I went on I missed a fleet warp and panicked, flew to a random asteroid belt where I was warp scramed by rats. 
---
I couldn't hit them with my back guns so quietly dropped fleet and waited the 10 mins until they killed me. Only then did I realise my hurricane had drones I could have used.
---
This post does reek of nullsec.
---
yes a dual web blaster hecate can kill some cruisers if you can magically start the fight at zero, shocker.
---
and please don't say "haha just probe them haha"
---
EVE is casual in the sense that you can train skills passively and accomplish a relative lot with few hours played. 
---
EVE is not casual in the sense of being easy to learn. It's pretty damn complex relative to other mmos and while you can master games like WoW and FFXIV pretty quickly, EVE will see you learning new things even after playing for years. It can be pretty intimidating to get started. Personally, I "started" EVE about 4 different times on trial accounts before I got into it enough to keep playing. I'm sure other people on here will tell you the same thing.
---
No?
---
Damn good!
---
What. 6/10 times it's some stupid kite fit orthrus' and cynables just murdering newbro Atrons thinking they're the greatest PvPers in the land while they actually run away from any decent fight or anything that gets within 50 kilometres or can hit them from 200. 3/10 times it's a huge frat/goon/NC fleet that we fight off in shitty Caracals or Moa's which is always fun because then we actually get a fight. 
---
The remaining 1 time is us dropping caps on random stuff or a good wormhole alliance comes by like Tuskers and we get a really fun fight from them because they stick around.
---
WTF is your problem. Here's what you say to your fc: "Thank you for organizing this fleet for me. "
---

---
I once lost a ratting Myrmidon to a low sec pvp-er. I thought I was invincible, after all I could take all those tough rats right? Turns out very specific tanks don't do well against a pvp fit ship. I even got a friend killed too!
---
No idea who the hell that is... 
---
But I'll agree with Dread on this. Can do better - do better. Spouting nonsence on reddit is hardly an achievement.
---
We don't need to hide our affiliations to post =\]

yeah, subscribe or go back to level 3's i'm afraid.

not last one!
---
Trying to buy ammo, that was just a bit cheaper three jumps away. 
---
Those three jumps that send me to lowsec from highsec, directly in a gatecamp, with my gnosis. 
---
That ammo definitely wasn't cheaper in the end.
---
Whoa man, all the test dudes were in a test mumble room together. We enjoyed the fleet, was a nice change of pace.
---
If farming bots was a bit easier I would not be complaining about them. I would be doing my own PVE by hunting them and looting them. The problem right now is that bots are messing with the economy and not providing content for human players either. So I'm happy with changes that get rid of bots, but I'm also happy with changes that just make it easier to catch ratters. From a hunting perspective, both types of changes reduce the frustration I encounter.
---
the scent of spod is unmistakable
---
Ye, projecting my dick into your ass ya poof
---
Nah, I just feel like shit art should be called out for being shit
---
Hey anonymous dinoposter, you're welcome to come FC in NC. if you think you can do it so much better than the Shoot First guys from tonight. We have a 0200 fleet tomorrow night in USTZ. Mail me in game at "Brothuhbob" and I'll let you FC our alliance since I'm guessing your own alliance probably doesn't let you FC there either.
---
We don't event try here.
---
lmao the wangspin strat
---
Haha op success mom! Am I elite now?! I was only pretending to be retarded and stuff!
---
Gallente win again
---
Yeah, last week. I was able to fly level 4 missions, but I could equip Omega modules, or fly Omega ships...
---
I can give you the hawk fit tomorrow. A solo hawk could do 1s and 2s, 2 hawks for 3s, and 3 for 4 and 5. I run fives with a friend and an alt. You’ll die a couple times starting off, but once you understand the rat names and avoiding leaving the borders it is very safe- ten times more so than cruiser abyssals. The reason I recommend garmurs is that they are the closest thing to a hawk if you can’t fly one. You could definitely run 3s with garmurs, but I don’t know about higher. Hawks are what is recommended for Darks. Turret and drone ships are nearly useless, an you rely on speed to sig tank.
---
This.
---
i don't think you were mate, that change happened a lot longer than a week ago.
---
The only thing I would add is the player's skill. 
---
p2w is not only irrelevant due to "No best ship" but also to the simple fact that between the two players in the exact same ships and with the same characters' skills - the one who knows the ship and the fit better will win. In fact, he will win in a weaker ship, costing a fraction of the price of the p2w atemptee's ship. 
---
EvE can be played casually, if you only want to do that. Ocasionally do missions, may be some low-key mining, or cheap PvP, be it solo or with like-minded folks. And you don't have to play it for many hours a week or pay. However, to enjoy EvE one may require to spend a very long time learning at least the basics. Then perfecting them. 
---
An Alpha who played a year, only for a few hours a week, but had spent majority of that time specialising, learning, perfecting whatever it is they decided to do in the game - will easily outplay an Omega (paying player) who may have played for twice as long but hardly done anything and only stuck at trying things out.
---
Also, one can pay for the game with ingame money. Although that may require a bit more play-time, as one would need to spend more time making money as a f2p Alpha...
---
this is me irl, including the autism
---
hmmm
---
&gt;You risk a dread that is what, 1.5 bil after insurance 
---
There is no way anyone would take it. Seriously.
---
&gt;for making several bil an hour?
---
Maybe 2 "if" you have perfect conditions.
---
&gt;And what are the odds of someone rolling into your c5/c6 hole?
---
USTZ about 80%
---
Don't forget you are competing with an entire corporation, even if you have a farm hole.
---
Also the sites despawn after they are run 1 time. There is no guarantee you will find one even if you roll holes all night.
---
Then you get blue loot. Not instant cash safe and sound in your wallet. So now you have to hope to get a high sec to transport all that blue loot hopefully not getting killed along the way through WHs and gates to sell it.
---
So like I said. WH ratting is FAR more difficult. And about FAR more dangerous.
---
So don't just sit there and say. Well sites pay way more. There are about 1000 stars that need to align for that to be true.
---
&gt;But ccp why shouldn’t my 20 man gang be able to camp the keepstar of a 1000 man alliance it’s just not fair...
---
you should be prevented by them undocking and shooting you til you go away not by a near uncounterable instant death ray.
---
Well arent you fun I bet some alliance out there is going to be just dying to have you come over and show them how it's done
---
mach builders
---
Bless dreadop
---
New player and definitely not a computer scientist type, but if bots are so bad and ruining the economy or whatever, why not just make the undock button some kind of simple CAPTCHA?
---
Because CONCORD isn't that strong. The only reason why they're effective against capsuleers is because they can shut down our pods. Take away that ability and they cease to be in any way effective.
---
I actually recommend people start a little casual with Eve. With skill training the way it is the more you pace yourself the less frustrating it will be. You can train as a free-to-play player for about 7 months albeit at half speed. Almost anything combat-oriented besides capital ships can be done as an alpha or free to play character. Almost all industry and production is reserved for Omega or paid accounts.
---
This post is NOT ok in the slightest. Being part of the battle, I hope both sides had fun. Huge props to FC's and all accompanying fleet members for duking it out. People make mistakes on both sides, and we all need to accept it for what it is. FC's understand the resposibilies of managing a fleet and in the heat of battle, it's really hard to make the right calls. I wish that people could respect this idea.
---
4s align?  You may as well have self destructed.
---
This post .... is .................. bad
---
2 accounts? Those are rookie numbers.
---
The narrative is whatever works for the situation.
---
Also, Init has been blue/working with/living with Goons in Delve for a while.
---
I did mostly the same.  Only difference was that my safety was green when I first tried to shoot it.  I actually moved my safety to red then took the shot.  Thought I was in lowsec.
---
GF to all the SF dudes. The bloodbath is invigorating.
---
No, you fight on gates. They don’t let you fight at 0, then you don’t fight. It’s not that complicated
---
Was running around lowsec combat scanning things trying to find a fight.  Located a griffin.  Warped to it at my optimal.  Landed and killed it immediately.  It was only then I realized that I had landed in the middle of a station and couldn’t get my ship unstuck.   RIP my 200m Hecate with 30+ killmarks on it to station guns.
---
Preach it Nate
---
As one of the TEST nerds on the fleet this dude definitely doesn't represent the opinion of those of us who came along. We are just friends helping friends. And if you are in my corp and I find out bad things will happen.
---
I had insane amounts of fun today in lowsec...Tama area.  It definitely isn't dead for sure.
---
was a good fight they did fine
---
The day I shut my mouth and stopped back seat driving FCs was the first day I FCd a small fleet.  Maybe you should try it and learn a little perspective.
---
"How was your Eve?"
---
"Boring"
---
That is the conversation I had a couple days ago. I pretty much keep it at one or two words to avoid blank stares.

&gt; the decision has been made to place all level 4 and 5 missions behind the requirement to have Omega status, to assist the fight against RMT and botting.

Butthurt much? Well u failed to pretend, u are a retarded!

Its what TAPI has always done to provi
---
Oh I like that idea.  If you cloak you lose local. When you decloak you get it back.  As a cloaky guy I think that would increase the risk quite a bit.

Or the botting fleet of procurers keeps mining while you bubble and cyno in the fleet.

you do get that I can see you killboard right? 
---
like this doesn't reflect Zkill like at all most of your drops on zkill are in fights where you use the capitals as the i win button because the other side won the subcap fight. 
---
I do get your hatred for people running away because they tend to go away before you drop or the massive blob gets to them, so that means you don't get to use good fight bait to farm them for killmails

I saw this as being pissed off as well haha

Yes, I'd like to solve the puzzle please.

I mean, this post is retarded but they lost 83 machs in losec. That might be even more retarded.

&gt;If you honestly think being able to buy shit with cash isn't a pay to win aspect of this game then you're wrong.

My point was that no matter how much you spend you will not win. 
---
This game is Pay2speed up, not pay2win

There is no advantage you can get that other players cant get.

There is literally NOTHING in this game that could not be attained by someone who starts with an alpha account and works their way up without a single RL cent.

Sure, he made many errors today, but I’m sure he will get good, and It was a good and fun fight, so we’re good.

Init lost any semblance of independence some time ago.

Hope you enjoy, it's a great sport. Remember to keep it minimal as they get cluttered very quickly

Was TOLD to draw this?
---
Gr8 change!
---
A few years ago I parked an orca (without tank) in front of the station to give boost to the Corp members while I spent the night with my real friends in the pub. The next morning the orca was gone... someone bumped me so far away from the station that the highsec rats took their revenge. That was definitely my stupidest loose. Otherwise it was a great night :)
---
After all that time saying they were independent? Sad.
---
yes, skills train in real time whether you are logged in or not.

To OP, you smell like fish. Go Douche yourself.

I can appreciate you alot right now. Thank you

It's not a personal attack, it's just kind of boring.

Would be good to tell whoever "told" you to draw and post this that their shitpost concepts need more imagination.

you are shit. :-)
---
OP I think if you can't handle everything not happening 100% optimally every time you are on a fleet you might need some introspection if Eve is the game for you. I say this because it was Snuff's job to ruin our FC's plan and it was our FC's job to ruin theirs. So someone has to come out on top, happens that Snuff won this round. 
---
So GF Snuff see you at hull timer o/
---

---
Happy cake day!
---
Shit happened before as well tho
---
My agenda is set, @quebber
---
This is spot on, mistakes were  undoubtedly made but he's a good Fc, the fight using the naga fleet the other week was a great example of it, every1 has a bad night now or then no need to nerd rage when the poster is most likley an f1 monkey who cant do shit without some1 to hold his hand and tell him to press f1.
---
No1 was complaining about the Fc'ing the day before when we used the same fleet and saved our timer
---
Raging at the Fc is never ok, the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes is unreal making mistakes is normal cant be mad at that not learning from them is a different matter and were not in that position
---
 So I'll say thanks for all the hard work to Dan Jintao, all the leadership and logistics getting every1 to be able to be there at that time and place and for stepping up and Fc'ing and when it comes time to form up again we'll step up and have your back ty for the fleet o7

Second. Fleet "sat still" because anchor was turbo webbed. FC and anchor weren't the same dude, and FC had more going on in his head that "are we moving?"
---
Third, triage came in late because cyno ships either died in the beginning of the fight, or were blapped as they came in. 
---
Lastly, to Snuff and Pen, TNT, and all the other "enemy groups" thank you for the respect you're showing Shoot First and our FC. You're a bunch of good dudes, and fun to get shot at by.
---
thanks for the advice.

The steam population is inaccurate. I don’t normally check the numbers the Eve client gives, but I think we’re at like 35k peaks on weekends, or we were a couple months ago, it usually drops in the summer. I think it’s maybe half that when I checked in the middle of the night (USTZ) once, but again that was one check a few months ago and shouldn’t be taken as meaning much. 
---
Point is, it’s nowhere near as dead as you are thinking it is

So Redline and friends pummels a piece of space that is not worth the undock while Goons have been going unchecked in the north...

 [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) shows a graph over the hours
---
If you like the people there, then by all means go for it. 
---
But there are many different new player friendly corps in Eve, from nullsec ones like Pandemic Horde and Brave Newbies, to lowsec ones like Red vs Blue, Templis Calsif (spelling?) and Aideron Robotics, to wormhole ones like POS party. 
---
Signal Cartel is very unique, but also worth looking into. They nearly saved my ship that I got lost in a wormhole with, very good people (I say nearly because I died getting out, but it wasn’t their fault, just bad timing on my part).
---
You can’t bait either, though. So following a max tank + scram exploration ship with your full pvp fit stratios isn’t going to fly. Even going into FW lowsec for frigate duels would probably not be allowed.
---
You can shoot MTU's in high sec but you go suspect.. If you piss off the owner they might shoot at you. Then you get a limited engagement timer and can shoot them back. As long as you stay aggressed on them the limited engagement timer dosn't tick down. So I was able to fight him for 3 hours even when he tried to de-aggress.
---
Dude you're supposed to do those in a carrier or a really beefy battleship, they're nasty.
---
Are you the asshole that spam mailed me about this shit? Get fucked no one cares.

Why didn't he just go afk? I assume he was cap stable. Or would you have brought in a gank squad?

Same place as tournament support; somewhere in Hilmar's ass.  Devs are working hard to dig it out, but it's a minefield in there.

They “miss” those opportunities every time something is changed. It almost looks like a plan, endorsed by certain player representatives.
---
Since when was local ever fixed?
---
Gotta find something to do while structure bashing.

My dumbest loss was not one I expected. First time I got the skills to use remote repairers, I decided to try them on a rat I was just shooting.

I once thought these lowsec npc miners were annoying and i will just dispatch one of them real quick with my blaster myrm. Well no, i got dispatched by the response fleet like the little bitch i am.
---
I've lost count of how many times I have warped to a random cyno in 0.0 just to land in a bubble next to a angry pos
---
So does the war ends the second the structure is destroyed ...Errrrr?
---
So I just died for the first time, doing a mining mission was trying to find asteroids and then got shot down by an npc thing. How do I get another ship? I only have like 1mill isk.
---
thanks
---
your friend is retarded, and nobody plays on steam if they have sense.
---
oh, i thought about doing the same, but then it seams like it is not necesary
---
said the hooker to the leper.
---
It’s 100% not necessary ✌️
---
It is a consequence, 2.5bn on their killboard due to their failure to defend it and a disruption to their pipe and hub camping activities.   If people keep doing this it will all add up.
---
As for small groups if you cannot defend their structure group up.   It is not exactly rocket science in a MMO.
---
No structure timers do not need to be shortened, but the mechanics around dropping the war need to be looked at so that the defender can chose to have the ability to shoot them up to two hours after the timer, or better still make all wars that ended within four days of the destruction of the war HQ get the two weeks respite.   It is not difficult to work out better ways to adjust it.
---
ok but next time do it in ventures and procurers
---
Omg. Iam playing this game since 2014 and never was aware of it being on Steam until now.
---
Am I dumb? Be honest guys.
---
https://eveeye.com/
---
PIRAT could place their structure in a freaking c1 wormhole somewhere...Good luck killing that. And shorter structure timers in HS just might make them do that.
---
How would they declare war with a structure in a wormhole?
---
Goons travel from killing structures in nullsec
---
To killing structures in highsec
---
Bottomline is, you want them to make the game easier for you.
---
It more dramatically affects hunters than it does the super cap umbrella.
---
They can still move the umbrella as easily as before, and counter dropping will work mostly the same.
---
This change hurts hunters slipping in under the umbrella to kill far more.
---
It almost doesn't affect projection at all.
---
You seem a bit upset, you want the timers shortened and you are being the pussy here as in being weak and pathetic,.    it is an easy matter to punish people playing with the mechanics if CCP but put their minds to it.
---
War deckers now have some skin in the game at last, now it just needs refinement to deal with those that play with the mechanics.    The idea of having the reinforcement of the war HQ also affecting the ability to renew a war dec would solve this.
---
When people start resorting to insults they always lose the debate.   :P
---
Nice kill love the wingspan kill
---
you missed a zero.

Gonna save this and start pasting it on every one of those posts.

Doesn't it stop active wars for 2 weeks?

You're level of pussy seems quite high if you think this is upset.

Lol on the last sentence. That's one of the dumbest assertions ever. It's just as dumb as claiming that people that only claim insults are a lost debate, is someone losing a debate. Surely even your pussyass has something more intelligent than that.
---
The mechanics aren't right as they are. Whether timers are shortened (though your pussy attitude is that isn't good, because it applies to everyone and that's not good for carebears), or whatever, the current mechanics haven't fixed wardecs by a long shot.
---
Before alpha state there was a limited time trial. Alpha is the unlimited trial. The limitations are necessary as their are some very potent, low investment, things you could do with an alpha character. Cloaky camping etc.
---
That doesn't show you the remaining times where people just fly kitey bullshit and don't engage though. 
---
My killboard just had the engageable content.
---
Calm down mate, you seem rather uptight.   In my experience of debates when people start resorting to insults it normally means that they can't deal with the subject matter.   You may be an exception, but somehow I doubt that.   That you are getting upset and insulting is highly amusing to me, perhaps you should go to the Eve forums and mix it with the plonkers there.
---
There are always going to be ways to play with mechanics, CCP needs to adjust them and find ways to cater and adjust for such play, it is not exactly difficult, and your upset at people you want to call carebears is rather amusing, please continue.   The timers do not need to be changed period.
---
Yeah people here are doing a good job of demonstrating why line members who have little experience in fleet PVP generally and no experience of FC'ing it should sit back and be quiet.
---
First of all if you think there was 1 FC making all the calls by himself during that fight you have 0 awareness of what was going on in coms, let alone the bigger picture or what the strategy was. 
---
There were multiple FC's on the SF side some of whom have a great deal of experience FC'ing Mach fleets and cap fleets both in LS and for large Coalition Null Blocks. It was less than a week ago an SF Mach fleet with the same group of FC's beat a Snuff Fleet on the same Fort.
---
There was a lot going on in that fight which people who were sitting there pressing F1 don't appreciate and decisions being made about more than what was on grid.
---
There are mistakes made in most fights. People only complain about them when they loose and a skilled enemy takes advantage of it.
---
GF to Snuff and Pen is Out. See you next time.
---
&gt; how necessary is Omega State?
---
Necessary for what?
---
But it does speak volumes about the of the man*, in this case the special extra snowflake OP*
---
NCPL is shit
---
Eve is dead since 2003, didn't you know
---
And here I just meme my way through EVE every damn day.
---
@Aleya Yea but getting a t3c to sub 2s gets super expensive, and when cloaky/nullified 4-5s is totally fine 99% of the time, unless you fuck up the cloaking, or just randomly happen to spawn right on top of something.
---
No, eve through steam is bs
---
I ship scanned him with my alt that was bringing me ammo and put his fit into my fitting tool.. He had about 3:30 minutes of cap stability. If he went afk he would die.. Meanwhile I could go afk while shooting him because I was cap stable.
---
It's a feature!
---
How much fucking ammo do you have in that thing so that you can shoot for 3 hours straight?
---
You got it backwards. Omega is the standard state. And Alpha is a limited state. This is a subscription MMO with a very nice unlimited trial state.
---
\&gt;swap to different alliance
---
ooowee
---
Gate guns in lowsec are engaging someone and warping away due to gate guns but warping to another gate and getting one shot by the gate guns there.    Was only a blackbird, but I face palmed because it was dumb
---
I had an alt bringing me ammo.
---
Omega is not premium, it's the normal (subscription based) game. Alpha is an timewise unlimited trial that limits you what you can do in game. While it is possible to get Omega by farming enough as Alpha it involves a lot of grind and/or knowledge of the game, so basically not really fun.
---
Yes Omega is needed, you can do some stuff as alpha but high end pve and pvp require ships and skills only Omegas can have.
---
So you should find a new name?
---
Well, to fully experience the game. Theres some seriously powerful stuff available behind it, and after a brief encounter with triglavian ships, I understood quickly just how weak I currently am even with a Catalyst Battleship.
---
Someone else just pointed out that Omega State is the actual game, and Alpha is merely an unlimited trial which honestly... makes a lot of sense.
---
So basically, how badly am I gonna need the stuff behind the Omega paywall to be strong enough to accomplish serious tasks?
---
Nates a G
---
That makes way more sense actually, thank you. I may or may not have said this, but I would be perfectly willing to pay for the game. Probably just bite the bullet and take the year subscription or something... eventually. For now I guess I'll fool around in Alpha and build my character
---
Here's another question. When you get Omega, does it affect the entire account or simply one of your characters?
---
Actually we try to convince him that he has birthday
---
Accidentally jumping into lowsec with a maelstrom while doing incursions, back when they had just come out. Hurricane and drake greeted me with open arms and heated guns.
---
Gotcha. Yeah everyone's saying Omega is the actual game. And that makes sense. I'm coming into this after playing Fractured Space and just a tiny smidgen of Dreadnought, both of which are dead or dying.
---
I didnt care if it was a MOBA or an MMO I just need to satiate my need for spaceships. I've spent 3-4 years on MWO, now I'm finally finding myself wanting a new game to obsess over XD
---
Thank you for the response
---
Awesome, thanks &lt;3 This is indeed a great moneymaker. Someone linked me this video https://www.twitch.tv/videos/260113814?collection=6WVDqmDXLRVZbQ and I instantly dropped 5b on his Loki fit, pod, and injectors to fly it right, which was all the money I had. Made it back in 2 days.
---
Dive right in chief, I've got a ring of steel
---
I will sort them by tranversal next time o/
---
I'd like to thank everyone so far for the rapid response and explanation into Omega State, so thank you. I definitely think this is a game I could really get into, and should probably put more hours in Alpha before I hit the subscribe button, but this game is incredible
---
Soundtrack is epic btw
---
Serves a dual purpose decorative item and in the event someone breaks into your house, you can hit em over the head with it
---
I would have either self destructed or logged in a couple gankalyst alts at minute 5.
---
Omega is for your entire account (to train characters on one account at the same time you need to buy an MCT tough, and you won't be able to be logged in with these characters at the same time)
---
You sneaky bastage!
---
I love it!
---
i never suggested anything in my post, all i did was voice my frustration at suggestions (checkmate #1)
---
my high iq is proof of my superiority (checkmate #2)
---
my posting obviously says i dont care about karma
---
no profit :(
---
I found out the hard way that while Providence residents are NRDS their POS guns are not. Lost my Primae I had just flown 20 jumps round trip to buy cheaply. Warped to the systems TCU while working out which planet I was going to drop the PI command centre on. Tabbed back to the ship and found it had died to a POS on the TCU.
---
it's not premium time.
---
this is a subscription MMO. either subscribe, or run the trial account forever.
---
Sorry to break it to you, Iron Armada is all but independent. They are just blue to literally everyone in Fountain.
---
been looking in the mirror again?
---
It was probably just xenuria, but that translator might actually be needed nowadays
---
I simply swiped my card in Barra's house.
---
It appears someone in the Goon hegemony felt that the Reddit war wasn’t in their favour and so ordered OP to produce some low effort art.
---
Op then edited his explanation post below to say he was ‘asked’, removing ‘told’.
---
Contextually they mean different things but it would be quite sad if thoughtpolicing in the Imperium has progressed to that level of control where artists can’t even express themselves.
---
When they increased the amount of items and ships alphas could use, they restricted level 4s.
---
Early on? Pick a frigate or destroyer you like and learn all it's mastery level 1 skills.
---
What is xenuria?
---
I actually had a plan in order for if gank catalysts showed up.
---
Steam isn't the primary launcher.
---
The official launcher is about 10x the steam one.
---
Omega is the real game.
---
Alpha is just an unlimited time trial.
---
Crazy idea, but go poke something else with your 10-20 cruisers? Go around and shoot ratters for a bit, shoot other structures, find ansiblexes on fortizar grids. If it's carebears you're shooting at, you won't get a fight no matter what. Not saying keepstars aren't breaking the game, but the dd is the smallest problem that comes with their existence, and frankly I don't see CCP changing them anytime soon.
---
Well, eve is easy to obsess over
---
&gt; how badly am I gonna need the stuff behind the Omega paywall to be strong enough to accomplish serious tasks?
---
you won't need that stuff
---
#realtalk, you probably don't even understand most of what you can do as an alpha, let alone all of the ships/skills you'd have access to as an omega. that is also considering that even as an omega, you won't instantly get those skills, you'd still have to train 'em over time (or inject)
---
you're better off spending your time as an Alpha learning the game, instead of trying to jump into being an omega
---
Wrong subreddit, r/evejobs is what you look for
---
Awesome ty
---
It's the war hq. All wars dropped.
---
It's not really free to play. It just has a very long (limited time) trial with some limitations.
---
The limitations are very generous and you can serious try out a lot of the game.
---
But anyway, while it's a very hard pre game, it's still totally possible to have fun playing fairly casually.
---
But staying on the alpha state will limit you in your options in the long run
---
Yawn.
---
Entire account, all 3 slots will be considered Omega. But its a separate purchase to be able to train on the other 2 slots.
---
If you train a skill while omega and then stop being omega you will still have the skill trained and receive whatever bonus it gives, but you won't be able to use omega only ships or items. You don't have to be omega to play but you do have to be omega to be able to fly and do certain things.
---
If you do end up using cap transfers, A-Type mediums are quite cheap.
---
Butterfly effect, nicely played...
---
Thays precisely what I plan to do. I'm working on the exploration campaign out of Clellinon (Gallente) and it's the last one. I have roughly 10 ships from the missions alone, and am hovering around 10mil ISK
---
I'd like to think I'm doing okay so far as all I've done is the missions.
---
i hear tenla voice all across my praxis
---
so you have hulk!! now your t3 cruiser turns into t3 titan when angry
---
Xylyx. you are a big part of what makes faction warfare fun.   
---
more gallente (and neutrals) should hang in the few systems they have left and come check out the action cough vlil eha oicx cough.
---
I already argued my point with /u/kristallnachteWiNGSPAN
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win
---
&gt; Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.
---
The term doesn't refer to literally winning.
---
I think enough plex makes the game "largely unbalanced", he doesn't.
---
I'd say he's looking at it from a more macro scale and I'm looking more at the smaller comparisons, so it's definitely arguable either way.
---
Why are your BR's messing with sides ?
---
i lost  praxis to npc rats in highsec couple months ago. had to do rl stuff forgot to turn my shield hardeners and booster before going afk,when returned seen my capsule and  wreck on top of me.  luckily evrything dropped except augmented  hammerheads.  rofl i warped  to ore site in some 0.7 system ,realized mistake  when was back - it was  hidden hideaway anomaly.
---
this way  my cousing welped  bling kronos. he tried to kill orca,he thought he was in lowsecd he seen orca  and he went full rampage
---
Sounds better, I guess. For whoever cares, I guess. To me it means I can gate bigger ships out of Jita to FW or nullsec. Nothing else. .
---
i wasm  killed in  jita  when some idiot   deployed them  not far from gate. lost sunesis
---
i remember  a dude dying to his own smartbomb. this was hilarous. evrything timed perfectly capsule ejection  in time of smartbomb cycle
---
it was not triglavisan but  drifter probably xd
---
&gt;but theres a ton of ships locked behind a paywall.
---
Imagine having to pay for a subscription based game
---
Why is Xenuria?
---
"what the fuck is lommy?"
---
let their recruiters know
---
yeah that's fine.
---
just number of ships and isk in wallet isn't really indicative of much, but for someone starting out and just doing missions, it's plenty. i wouldn't worry about Omega until you start getting start getting to the point where you really need that extra skill or you need to be able to use a certain T2 ship
---
apparently lmao, i had always done then in a carrier no problems at all and figured it wouldn't be that hard since low sec.
---
I think if I hadn't gotten the worst spawn i've ever seen I might have been ok, probably would've clapped that nemesis too if I wasn't in structure when he uncloaked
---
i dont get it...
---
These do exist, not sure how they are earning cash but I assume they do. Alliances do not like them at hostile forces will be able to safe up on them. 
---
Miners in nulll sec will not use this as we all have buy back's at the moon drill. Which means someone buys our ore in system at a moon drill/refinery.
---
You best bet is a free port for small gang and solo roams.
---
Actually yes, there is a new bro friendly corp in Thera! Check your PM!
---
you can liteerally do them in a pvp fit geddon or phoon 
---
they dont do that much dps and breaking them isnt hard either once you got them webbed
---
if you do them in carrier its a thing of 1-2 minutes only tho probably
---
Colour me surprised test are looking to blue more corps
---
.. says Test, the alliance that rented Omist and Feythabolis to the bot corps of KWG.
---
They weren't wrong.
---
Sounds about right for the Cav tbh
---
What I'm getting at is hanging around trying to survive for 3 hours isn't worth 1.2b to me. So I wouldn't care that you got the loot, I'd just reship and get back to what I was doing.
---
sure just set free move on
---
I have actually saved people like that raven pilot before.  
---
The best way to do it is to get an orca to them, then tell them to drop aggro and refit the warp core stabs you have in your fleet hangar.  
---
You have no idea how hard that "drop aggro" part is for some people
---
I play a lot at work while on standbye. I have a 2nd phone dedicated to "oh shit" answer it now. Brand new Tengu back when they were good and I was leaving Jita with it to fly out. Phone rang, some rat managed to web me and warp disrupt me and bam dead. Dead before I could react while on the phone. Then it was "we just wanted to make sure someone was there, nothing needed".
---
Come on mate, yeah It’s a shit post but it’s still kinda funny :p
---
Rastino has a point here.
---
youd be suprised lol
---
Grow a pair and go expand west
---
battlereport?
---
hi rastino :)))
---
hi yonis
---
PIRAT's war HQ got destroyed. All wars dropped.
---
These kinds of post are starting to be really annoying 
---
Every major null bloc has botters, either by choice or not.
---
These people knowingly breach the EULA, it’s not a stretch to think they also deceive said null blocs ?
---
If you try to tell me Panfam, Imperium and even Legacy has no bots I’m calling you a flat out liar
---
Kids With Bots as they are better known
---
You'd have to talk with the locals in whatever region you want to set up, but in practice you can't expect no resistance, or even that you'll be taken seriously. Most likely people will show up and blow up your shit, largely for the salt with a thin casus belli.
---
It's a lovely idea, but pretty untenable in practice. Go for it, by all means, but success will be surprising.
---
Are some spots... but basically are controlled by Alliance X so aren’t independent... def won’t happen in sov space... NPC null maybe
---
In 2010 I lost a dramiel to like a slasher or something while baked out of my mind and now whenever I see that guy In local he brings it up.
---
Mind you not seen him in a while. I'll have to find the loss mail.
---
Why are there never meets in the Puget Sound region?
---
How is Xenuria?
---
Take your meds, dude.
---
&gt;Test alliance is calling all new eden to help us with the eviction of botters. 
---
no we're not, please fuck off
---
This mentality is completely backwards. Omega is not the "premium", with Alpha the "standard". Alpha is the trial and Omega is the standard.
---
EVE is not a F2P game. It is a P2P game with a generous trial.
---
My 16 (so far) 1.5B Deimos losses disagree. 
---
Beauty of brawlers is that you will always get a fight and at least one person is gonna die.
---
&gt;Catalyst Battleship
---
Hahahahahaahahahahahahahaahaha
---
&gt;So basically, how badly am I gonna need the stuff behind the Omega paywall to be strong enough to accomplish serious tasks?
---
Just pay for the game. EVE isn't a F2P game, it's meant to be paid for so we don't have to buy P2W crap to keep the server on. The game isn't designed to be played as Alpha, the Alpha state is meant as an extended free trial to help you decide if you want to pay or not.
---
Fuzzwork Market also has a simple API, if you wanna play around with market data until you got your own ESI stuff sorted.
---
https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/api/
---
Only the wars which were attached to that HQ.
---
I’ve played Eve for a few hundred hours tops! But I lurk r/eve ever since. I want to tell you that there are “normies” with Eve background! There is hope! Came for the spreadsheet gameplay staying for the memes and drama.
---
I hate the mentality that Alpha state has provided, that EVE is somehow not a subscription game anymore.
---
Hang on, what's this? Resorting to insults....lol
---
Lost argument I guess.
---
That's the problem with your narcissism, no ability to filter what you say without realising how it reflects on yourself.
---
I'm a dick, but you're a dick that thinks your reasonable. You're just as big of an autist loser as the rest of us.
---
Moved an orca in low sec line : meh it'll be fine.
---
Nodded off in an ice belt. Woke up minutes later missing 8 covetors and 5 ice excavators.
---
To rats.
---
Glad this thing died.
---
Nice try but I just replied with your original lame insult.   Also add another to the list, fake psychologist bullshite too, and fake medical issues, you have the shite posting disease in a major way.   You sound like an Eve forum HTFU shite poster.    Keep going I rather like this.
---
Blue Yeti is trash though beaware
---
Lol, more evidence you've lost the argument (by your own measure too).
---
Am i allowed to shoot omist botters if i join?
---
SFW EVE porn? Gentleman, you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention!
---
I imagine now ships dry humping each other.
---
What argument, your last post had not discussion, debate or argument on the subject matter of the thread, just pure bullshite.   Do get better at this, your IQ needs refinement.
---
more insults. Keep digging I guess, but hey, it's your measure, so surely you apply it to yourself.
---
Erf that's awkward.
---
Might as well suggest to add an invincible 50000 km wide bubble that only goes away when the site is cleared.
---
For the last three posts all you have done is personal insults and made no attempt to discuss the subject matter, and that is as amusing as hell.   Sucks to be you.
---
You must be through to China by now with how furiously you are digging here.
---
Maybe,
---
Wow, does it slot together in pieces or do you literally just print that out. 
---
I'm not clued up on 3d printing.
---
Thanks for the shout out! We love the fights.
---
They strip right down
---
Remember that time he what forth a grand conspiracy that Gallente were CCP's favorite and that they are unbeatable? 
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
Career Agents won't talk to you if you've either completed their missions or rejected/cancelled one. If you know you haven't completed them you can submit a ticket and CCP will reset them, or you can find a new set of agents elsewhere. Each empire has 3 sets of the 5 career agents.
---
Grosse Point Blank.
---
Keep in mind everyone has more than one account. Some even 10+
---
TIL steam is a credible source of health status for games and  [https://eve-offline.net/](https://eve-offline.net/)  is just bogus
---
Some of you mongos are so gullible.
---
The Agency shows only the agents near your starting system.
---
You might fly there and look if those agents have a red bubble, then you did those missions before.
---
Finding the other career agents is not possible ingame anymore.
---
Look here: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career\_Agents](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents)
---
THE best post I've seen on this sub. Thank you for the laugh!
---
At least we have all the other autists on here to share it all with.
---
yeah my bad, they always sneak through
---
When will papa goons be back?
---
i like how you think "pantsu pets" is supposed to be some kind of deep-cutting insult
---
the reason pl is active in the spire is because i, personally, am tired of your shit, not because pantsu told me or asked me or paid me to help
---
you can rationalize and blurf all you want about how you're a strong independent alliance and the renters are ganging up on you, but,
---
1. you started it, and  
---
2. it turns out when you go around being an alliance full of unlikable pieces of shit, people eventually stop wanting you around
---
Playing for 6 years. Still lost.
---
...ok true. but damn
---
Ranger Regiment?! surely these Chinese botters are just outliers of a larger problem and not indicative of a larger problem....
---
Yeah no, if you're in space associated with any Chinese corp you're gonna get this. Thank you for doin the lord's work
---
We're all autistbros to some degree.
---
Could they BE any blander?
---
Yea... if you mean the trashers check your spais. That was a fun roam. But its fine. Just spread your propaganda. :-P
---
Why is this NC only?
---
Poshlost flow. That is interesting. In Bulgarian poshlost or пошлост is something bad, vulgar, stupid and low.
---
don't use a passive fit for Ragings and Chaotics, use an active fit with a battery
---
I was shooting a drifter in a marauder, after I got through its shields, the drifter saw fit to promote me to captain of a capsule class vessel
---
Good luck CCP banning ascii art of potentially filtered words. Test will be finally useful!
---
Make sure you insure your ship, it might not seem like much but it will definitely help cover the cost of loosing a ship early on. Train up some drone skills so you can use a flight of drones, then you can just leave em out while you mine. As for getting a new ship, you will be able to get a venture with that and fit it with t1 mining lasers.  
---
Just open up the market tab on the neocom and search for "Venture" and it'll bring up any ventures for sale nearby, depending on your skills it may only show a jump or two away.
---
If you could hit that other war hq that's be great.
---
Just skilled into a magus. Got asked to help with timers from wormhole bros I've died to in the past. Flew into leshaks and guardians with the magus flying at 3.6k per 2nd. White knuckled. Hitting the mjd button for the first time. 4 guardians and a leshak , the tail end of their anchor flew right into the mouths of baltecs and HAW dreads. They lost half their logistics in 1 press of the button and saw me warp off with another. Been amazing fights of 20v20. I'm stoked for more.
---
My buddy and I racked up those guardians, 1 leshak, 4 Sabres and a bifrost losing a scythe fleet and a magus. o7 love this game
---
[Ooof](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77337181/)
---
They can spam infinite number of citadels. Those are cheap and effort to kill them is massive.
---
Halve the bounties from ratting.  Make up the difference with the ESS.
---
Dying to your own smart bomb is just about par for the course when you start using them.
---
I managed to avoid dying myself because my corp mates taught me how to do it right and to tell me what not to do. So I didn’t continue flying in the direction of the launched bomb so that I would not end up in its AoE range.
---
If they hadn’t told me that I would have bought the farm for sure.
---
And then you have the guys from Rooks and Kings and they fuck you up and you literally never saw it coming.
---
EVE has sound?
---
VNI's are very, very tanky and will likely be passive tanked to fuck plus it's a dangerous target to go after solo in a stealth bomber. I'm gonna assume you have the correct torpedo type loaded for the bonus. Also it may depend on your torpedo/missile support skills but the dps sounds about right depending on the damage mods.
---
I would definitely recommend an Astero if you can't quite afford a Strat but if ISK isn't a problem a T3C is a good option too, very versatile especially now that you can swap out rigs without them being destroyed. Since you have your missile skills trained up for torps, either a Tengu or a Legion would be the best bet.
---
Auto targeter, spam F.
---
Welcome to actual fights.
---
Was this on the first day of the invasion? 
---
I was ninja looting on the first day and was just chilling watching groups waiting for Zorya's spawns. I saw a golem eating shit, it died, I swooped in and got a cool bil in loot.
---
I know many golems have eaten shit to the trigs but just in case it was you: thanks! You funded my stratios. :D
---
You sound like a bad loser. The fat dude who throws the marbles to the floor.
---
You think ccp isn't going to fix this asap?
---
pretty sure you are as you don't seem to understand the simple english words i wrote down, try google translate maybe?  
---
I can't really help you with english im afraid, im not a teacher.
---
oh ok so the sigil somehow can tackle several ships at once; i didn't realise.
---
&gt; He had about 3:30 minutes of cap stability
---
The fun part is, if he offlined his MWD and disabled hardeners, he should have been cap stable.
---
Wardeccers always have the upper hand. They can pick their targets freely. Their fault if they declare war against 150+ corps at a time.
---
Nice job. And cool that everyone seems to have enjoyed the fights. Now hoping that  ccp fixes the mechanics to work bit better so the fights will have bit more meaning in future. Subcap brawls are fun.
---
In 2025. After they buff the cyno beacons to give 0 fatigue.
---
Why not? I genuinely don't understand what positive aspect of the game would be surrendered.
---
Roam around while every single person in the region docks up until they drop HAW Dreads or Supers on your Caracal roam since local is 100% guaranteed intel, VNIs warp in under 5 seconds and there are infinite respawning resources in nullsec so no point to fight for anoms/ore.
---
I don't understand.
---
QOL you pagan savage
---
Those sure are words.
---
https://eveeye.com/ - Check it out! It's not as practical as Dotlan, but it is very pretty :)
---
Hi CCP, please don't censor about our protests. Also fuck the police.
---
If "hunters" have five minutes to kill something, that would seem to be an advantage compared to now.
---
I play on Steam, because Steam wallet plus Steam only deals.
---
lack of b274 killed it
---
I once jumped an unfitted bomber into a hit drop I had 2 with the same name just one wasn’t fit...
---
You should go evict them to prove how not independent they are
---
I played for 7 years solid. The only thing I was confident about when I finished was that I still didn't have a clue what I was doing.
---
Didn't mean I didn't have fun though.
---
Because that is a retarded way of controlling bots. There are other ways that don't massively reduce quality of life for very legit player.
---
I lost a wreathe full of t4 PI material worth 100mil in a low sec gate camp because I'm dumb.
---
Anyway I checked the the website showing kill on the route and the route was clear.
---
Now I definitely will not do it again
---
You can outsource captchas to 12 yr old indians for real cheap
---
Rk sounds pretty jelly tho

What the hell he lost 200 billion isk?!?!
---
Capitalist Army has a “hostile freeport” in  9UY in Provi.   It get reinforced a lot by, but they also have the connections to keep it defended.
---
There is nothing stopping those solo pve'ers from continuing their mission or abyssal grinding alone.
---
Why not just do what I do? Every time I undock I jerk off into a plastic cup and mail it to ccp_falcon.
---
CCP needs to make it so that if your HQ gets hit you can't just drop the war as long as it is RF,d \ repairing.

It's amazing what happens when you don't farm your neighbors. They don't mind you holding sov next to them.
---
There are plenty bots that can solve captcha so in the end only legit players get affected.
---
art better than the doctrine
---
Wasn't that the "zkill guide to x" or something?

Who?
---
THANKS! Nostalgia ahead for me.

!remindme 3 months

If TEST Goons, GOTG and INIT have reset eachother and don't have non rorqual/cloaking NIPs after the north deployment is over.
---
These videos?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN-i0jVa_yQ
---
Yup that's it, thanks!
---
They will just program the bot to never dock on its own, i.e. tether or safespot only.
---
look at the mids, its all abyssal so he lost *WAY MORE* than 200
---
I would love this, been asking this as well... But hey, people actually pay their subscriptions each month for those rorqual alts so why changing it right?
---
RemindMe! 3 months "Goons, INIT, TEST, Legacy and GOTG still have anti-cloaky pacts, anti-rorqual pacts, NIPs and are bluetral"
---
i had a toon stuck in a wormhole once, managed to scan down an hole to highsec and bolt it, some WH dudes where following me, agressed on the other side...  
---
concord.wav
---
They are still independent, The Imperium will just happen to third party every single sov contest that happens, and will just happen to shoot the guys trying to evict them, and Iron Armada will just happen to never engage anyone who owns sov within 3 regions of them.
---
It's amazing what happens when you rent from the Imperium. They don't mind you holding sov next to them.
---
Funny from pl pet ;D

Capcha solving bots have been around for forever. All it would do is make undocking a PITA for legit players and not effect bots at all.
---
"he was my friend"
---
At what point was you going to give up? I mean 3 hours is some serious autism shit
---
suck fnuff!
---
It's the same size as the Caldari regional gate
---
my best advice is find yourself a corp/make some friends.
---
Perfect recruit
---
Why not make a CAPTCHA before pressing the Post-Button on Reddit?
---
So they bring a better comp and you have to protect your useless killboard and run away. Got it.
---
When we go on small gang roams in my corp, yes, we have self rep usually, but we also like to bring some logi since that is what a few folk prefer to fly.
---
TL;DR. Get gud
---
&gt; diverse culture

bob no

Eve peaked around 60k players at one point. Don't quote me on that. I just know it was up there somewhere. If you're comparing it to that, then it's not what it used to be, but still very enjoyable and playable. Keep in mind what others are saying... players have multiple accounts, so the actual number of humans could be half that.
---
What time should we stay out? I have a dentists appointment during the day, but me ma lives over there so I was thinking about popping by. Just don’t wanna cause any trouble you know
---
No one is good at anything in Eve. Just do what's fun for you
---
I've fitted the Heavy Stasis Grappler II, why does it say 11km range where I've seen 31km range elsewhere (PVP videos); have they reduced the range in a recent patch? I can't find it in any patch notes.
---
Thanks!
---
Depends what you enjoy if you gonna stick to you own and mine or do missions then game is as alive as it ever been.
---
I got lost playing the tutorial
---
Those were 2 different updates.
---
Will try to make it... Missed the last few
---
You’ve got kind of a shitfit to be honest. You probably want to bling it a little more, and consider adding implants. It’s not entirely necessary for t4, but it will be for t5
---
There is no "R" in the word idea.
---
This might blow your fuckin mind but bots beat captchas all the time.
---
Tuesdays. Mostly.
---
Honestly at this point PL is a pet of PHorde.
---
How do you calculate your isk per hour ? i mean if i mine spod and sell compress spod to jita i find these numbers :
---
290000m3/hour that is i really mine
---
Compress buy spod in jita now : 395 000isk/u
---
so 18125 compress spod at 395k/u makes me 71M/hour without deducting heavy water. How can you achieve near 100M isk/h ?
---
Research Interstellar Starbase Syndicate. We died in a fucking fire.
---
Lol.  Operation Blame Dandylion.
---
Good times.
---
damn if I dont enjoy me some spokey eve shit
---
I think its good that they looked into fixing bugs this patch rather then bringing in new stuff again.
---
Would be great if they could have fixed more shit.
---
Was a fun project while lasted. I watched with great interest when ISS was a thing.
---
At this point you could argue just about everywhere in nul is contaminated by botting. It's just more prevalent/obvious in places than others.
---
On a side-note, this is primarily why I'd like to see some form of re-work/rejuvenation of FW. Making the effort to get to the outer regions and hoping (in vain) for a fight from some bored locals is just far too much effort for little to no gain nowadays.
---
Factory worlds are a waste of a planet and power grid
---
Well, I don't have it =) and I don't read bios anyway.
---
I don't know if new players check the bio of every character they encounter, but I seriously doubt that they do.
---
The annoying part of the "Show Info" is that there are some few NPC in some missions who are more powerful or have more resists than the others, providing a (very small) challenge. You had to discover it yourself or follow some websites who stated that it is a risky NPC without giving numbers, and in both situation it could cost your ship at least the first time because of overconfidence and vague intel.
---
I lost a few Rattlesnake back in the time, despite using a very high tank specialized for each mission (especialy against drones, as they could scramble). Now I won't lose one anymore, obviously &gt;:)
---
So well, I don't like this change. Vague intel is better than precise one for challenge sake.
---
I did exactly that. Pulling Station orders from ESI and storing them in a database for calculations. It‘s very fast. All Jita orders take less than2 minutes. Shoot me if you want to know more or maybe work together.
---
Undocked a Cynabal in Amarr, started doing something else and forgot. Space police wasn't happy with my low sec status.
---
Com on ccp that's got to be a dread
---
Ouch.
---
Reminder that we got absolutely spanked by SF and company the other night on the same grid.
---
Everyone has a bad night. You win one night you lose the next. Shit happens.
---
GF, shoot first, SGGRN, etc.
---
Also, it's a goddamn video game. Keep it in perspective, kid.
---
You actually can, though it's not a well documented feature.
---
In Settings-&gt;General Settings-&gt;Inflight-&gt;Auto Target Back set to a number greater than 0.  You will start targeting other ships (NPC or player) as soon as they start targeting you, until you have that many targets locked (including any targets you manually selected).
---
I keep this on whenever I fly cargo to keep an awareness of how much heat I'm drawing.  It also gives you a second or two of warning to turn on and overheat resist modules.
---
This won't tell you about passive scanners, and a lot of ganking ships will fit for a rapid target lock so the extra warning you get can be as little as a single tick, but it's something.
---
Nothing wrong with a little bit of a mixed up karma. How can all those Boy George fans be wrong??
---
Yep, first day trig invasion. System near Jita, forgot which lol
---
No, withotu it a lto of new palyer will just not try to play. 
---
The true problem is the lack of newbro.
---
riot against what and why?
---
Actually newbro alliance have more hope to have ressources than old system.
---
ew double negative
---
I recall a very insightful post about why eve is so easy to bot and numerous recommendations on how to fix it. Of course nothing changes. Why invest time in a game and company that doesn't value their players.
---
Yes, there are many bots in EVE. There are a **ton** of bots in Gemini Whore United, which is why you should avoid their space if you want to kill things. Fade/Deklein/etc. are all very stupid places to go if you don't want to see bots, it's completely infested - blame Sort Dragon.
---
Have you considered the fact that you may just suck at hunting? If you went to RR space in Tenal, there are many VNIs/Gilas/etc. that are ripe for catching.
---
Yes I did
---
**IF CCP WANTED TO GET RID OF BOTS PERMANENTLY, THEY WOULD AND COULD**
---
Wormholers btw is thera newbie corp
---
Ah methamphetamine the totally casual, do whenever you want, totally wont control your life,drug.
---
I fit a web on a barghest instead of a 100mn so I couldn't coast past an initial tackle and ate shit in a 12b barghest to PH. Was intended to whelp it, but meant to last a little bit longer :)
---
This is the Triglavians when they’re sober. Imagine what *that* looks like when they’re drunk.
---
The best propaganda are the ones you have to explain. Hope whoever told him to make this doesn't tell him to make any more.
---
Comedy at its finest
---
Again, this is CCP not really understanding its own game.
---
Triglavians communicate in weird ways. That should mean that they fly their ships in weird ways. That should mean that it would take something extra to fly their ships. A new kind of drug that would make the pilot be able to tolerate the new conditions in which their clone operates inside a Triglavian ship.
---
I really should get a job at CCP.
---
RR Cyclones are becoming the new meta as a cheap doctrine for WH corps - we initially flew them and now 4-5 corps are flying different variations of them (TDSIN, WHSOC, apparently CeskSlovenska and POSPY now too)

innominate and olmeca in the same room
---
Nullbear, Nullbear, Nullbear, Nullbear, Nullbear
---
We get it
---
Still very block heavy but at least there's a lot more people on there who actually play the game and understand how it works.
---
At least Olmeca and Exooki got in
---
Wheres Cornak. Fake News here.
---
This definitely isn't one of the TEST guys. We had a ton of fun on that fleet. Why would we make a post like this when we're just there to add bodies? We got free machs and got to shoot stuff, and we don't particularly care about the objective. It was a good time and thanks for inviting us. Everyone in our comms was very grateful.
---
But, but... THE SUB NUMBERS!
---
Haha! I have a representative in the CSM!
---
Because in hisec the defenders undock
---
Dunk, t2 Salvaging Drones when?
---
Rip lowsec.
---
Yes Olmeca made it! Grats fam! #moreexplosions
---
Imagine being goons and having to rely on CSM PvP because you're that risk averse
---
That is a fairly interesting line up. Let's hope they can work together.
---
So bring a bubble, anchor it 100km from their site, in line with their citadel/pos, and log off trap there. ez frags. https://zkillboard.com/related/30001109/201812110000/
---
olmeca, gobbins with aryth in the same room
---
only 5 of 10 for Mittani,
---
Thank god for that, Gobbins and Olmeca are going to be great.
---
I was legit confused. Eve-O is what I use for multi boxing. :P
---
This seems ALOT more diverse than last times
---
Betting how long it will take before he will say something he should not? Like always ...
---
i rate this 2/10
---
Launcher says 25k.
---
Take away the bots, alts and multiboxed characters and you end up with what? 10k real players maybe?
---
I'm curious as to what all the various "animations" are going to entail.
---
(The entries that look like this: *animation/charactercreatorv2/female/granny/female_additive_breathing.gr2*)
---
ccplease reality show
---
There are so many things to do in eve that onestly I can't suggest you one specific path, it's nonsense imho.
---
The only suggestion I can make is to join a corp and don't play alone, it's terribly boring and a waste of money (play Egosoft X games instead).
---
Imho big alliances nullsec is the best place for newbies, you have all the opportunity and a lot of support from the ally and corp out of the box.
---
When you made experience you can choose different paths and go to low or wormhole space (if you like living with probes out 24/7).
---
Between big alliances I found that Test has the best services for newbies, well seeded doctrines and market and awsome space.
---
In services I think that Goons have work to do to reach Test level, I don't know about Horde.
---
Starting a pool on how long until olmeca breaks NDA
---
Neat!
---
I am personally disappointed as hell stitch didn't make it, but it's hilarious Sort Dragon didn't get on
---
oh well, probably doesn't matter either way
---
That doesn't make sense?
---
Wouldn't PL and NC both be refugees and frat the one checking passports or something?
---
&gt; Imagine being goons and having to rely on CSM PvP because you're that risk averse 
---
uuuuh, who is it that is swinging their dick around up in the north and who is it that runs away?
---
It s really annoying fac standings cockblock me from doing so many things. I m like staging near this area for next 6 months and want to run sites but instead I d have to bring an alt from the opposite side of the galaxy and haul another ship 60 jumps. It s just really dumb mechanic.
---
Yo ease up on those booster drugs.
---
Nice, 7 goons, 1 lowsec, 1 wh, 1 carebear... goons won, lets reset server
---
Dunk Dinkle can at least talk about drinking and eve meets I guess
---
Olmeca in Iceland = less kills in Delve.
---
Mittani wins again.
---
Dunk, vily, steve, and killah were on the ticket as well, that's 7.
---
Need to update your cv
---
I mean, tbf, there is at least one anti-Nullbear in there.
---
where is stitch :(
---
kinda suprised exooki got on
---
olmeca with the youtube vid tank
---
i thought steve wouldnt get on, last year he barely scraped it
---
lol at judge running out of isk to buy votes (even though he was a decent csm)
---
aryth, innominate, gobbins and olmeca in the same room
---
someone pls record the whole thing
---
such a low effort post, you should be banned lol
---
Dunk is a good person for the game. He isn't a spaceship expert but he is a people expert.
---
How long till Gobbins get kicked from CSM !
---
it makes me wonder if its even possible to find a balance between attacking and defending
---
How did Sort not manage to make it with all those botters up in Branch voting for him.
---
LOL.
---
my guess would be within a month of his first CSM summit
---
Hahaha exactly
---
Blue team Eve player with Red team eve player in the same room
---
lmao
---
you're a null bear too so, rejoice! lol good guys won again :)
---
What is y going to do?
---
Capsuleers just go to www.downloadable-shit-for-your-brain.com
---
when you want internet points so much you don't even have time to take a screenshot
---
He is an eve player..
---
What was the goon voting ballot again?
---
No scripts are available  to get bots to vote. Otherwise Frat would have all 10 CSM positions.
---
Vily things
---
7.5 of 10.  7 elected directly and another .5 for the inevitable olmeca drama/comedy.
---
eww Olmeca ;s
---
loving the goon flair
---
Convince CCP to let Test win EVE while Goons and Olmeca ree at each other.
---
Yes, goons are so risk averse they were gateing titans trough tribute this morning while NC/PL/PH didn't undock
---
Just pull the fucking plug already.
---
Chop lines on Skype calls.
---
sure throw a week old newbro into a 200 man fleet and tell the fc to yell as lound as he can newbro will totally be able to keep up and not give up on the game
---
Ahahaha, this is gonna be fun.
---
So happy you made it olmeca, played eve for over a decade, not part of any null sec block, your the first person that inspired me to vote. Please do everything you can to make this game better.
---
So that cool map with escalations, that was literally the only good feature of the previous iteration of the agency seems to be gone. Is there any other way to see all escalations on the map?
---
/u/exooki cant believe you made it tbh but grats you deserve it
---
amarr is a good space my corp is nearby were small and always glad to help newbros dm me if you are intrested
---
XD
---
Ramble about himself in third person
---
&gt;  Elected: "Aryth"
---
&gt;  Elected: "Gobbins"
---
&gt;  Elected: "Olmeca Gold"
---
&gt;  Elected: "Vily"
---
Aryth, Gobbins, Vily, and Olmeca all got elected in the first round
---
Not based in Thera though - its a C2 HS/C3
---
Exooki!!! Release the Kraken!!!🐙
---
Probably as fast as the others, so literally 15 seconds after signing it, as CSM is a nice meme in tyol 2019
---
At least it's a bit more balanced than the previous one. Still feel that the CSM should have fixed positions for every type of gameplay and that players should run for one of those specific positions though.
---
8/10 of these guys.
---
Interesting order of reveals, here. I'm looking forward to the voting data.
---
No Sortdragon, No Judge. Turns out the EVE Community still doesn't take kindly to cowards or traitors. This gives me hope.
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/resources/auditLog.txt
---
Not so much on the barely scraping for csm13.
---
Going to be curious about the actual numbers this year though.
---
or a nestor.
---
No risk when you have the biggest super blob because you've been lobbying the CSM for the better part of a decade
---
Good on fuzzy Steve for making the cut again
---
Hopefully he can complain about timer tanking or something
---
Why is gobbins elected then?
---
He literally fled before the last war AND backstabbed
---
Eve Mogul got smashed for trying to do this. The trouble with setting up a neutral market is that you make life easier for everyone in the region by inadvertently providing logistical support. You would have to have a deterent to keep the peace and stop alliances from strong arming your structures.
---
For hauling from low sec to jita use ghsol , cheaper than the other guys
---
I hope it's a recon with cool new ewar mechanics
---
That first fit is actually pretty good.  It should do perfectly fine for T3, and I've heard it can handle T4 and even T5.  Piloting matters quite a bit though.  You need to keep transversal up on the battleships and nuke scramblers first.
---
That would be very hard to enforce.
---
ok so that's a 800M loot for 11H of hunting. With (at least) two accounts. 
---
Even in only 3H, I'm not sure it's worth it.
---
But if you had fun …
---
Well... it could have been worst.
---
I also have my doubts but to be fair he probably has the most experience out of everyone there regarding fighting a proper war under the new cyno hammer and flex structure mechanics
---
original comment
---
I wish Stitch got on too. My first pick, but glad Olmeca and Exooki are there.
---
Good luck...
---
o7
---
First, I'd like to say I'm happy to see half of my former colleagues get reelected. I'd also like to say congrats to Vily, Gobbins and Dunk as well, given their winning was never in doubt. 
---
Exookiz, I am very happy you made it so you can carry my mantle as the WH CSM. I hope that INIT having you #2 made a difference, because we wanted you on. 
---
Olmeca ran a great campaign, congratulations. My only advice is to set aside your preconceived assumptions about folks and try to work with the rest of the CSM, not against them. 
---
Good luck all, have fun in Iceland, don't get banned, lol.
---
it's liek 70% goon ballot
---
i think the first ship i ever lost was a venture. i went to some empty site to see what was there and tried to loot a yellow wreck. some guy decloaked or warped in. I warped away but was in my pod when i landed. i didnt hear the engagement buzz until i warped off and didnt hear any damage alarms. honestly im still confused about that one.
---
about 10 minutes ago while teathered to a station in null some guy invited me to a fleet. I thought they were friends but they tried to warp me off the station a few times so i docked and they kicked me from fleet. they were very rude and not friends but also i would have deserved it if i lost my empty iteron.
---
and who will judge who has expertise for what, what stops a null alliance to fillout positions for lowsec highsec and wormholes when they actually have people in there since they are so massive
---
🤯
---
&gt;Nice, 7 goons
---
:thinking:
---
There's plenty of pve to do in this game, why should players have to fight bots too? This should be a fight for CCP to fix. The fact they haven't done anything to prevent botting shows you they don't give a shit. The fact that players killing bots barely makes a dent to their production is a big waste of time. If killing them gives you satisfaction then by all means go ahead, but you're not doing much to prevent it and the fact that they are there in the first place is sad and wrong.
---
Weeks
---
This year, yes. very much just scraped in.
---
or the campers dropped a bunch of bodies to prevent you from cloaking.
---
Pay the subscription!
---
There's quite a significant difference between `fleeing` and `upgrading`. Geminate is infinitely better than that shitty 5 system pocket in Fade.
---
you can do the hardest ones (NS) in a double plated mauler (T1 cruiser)
---
that was a one of a kind ship. CCP gives out special ships to winners of the alliance tournament. it doesnt have a real market value, theyre all just set to 200b because i think AT ships typically sell for around that much when they are sold, which is really rare.
---
~aryth~ ~innomminate~ ~merkelchen~

No.

I forgot to vote... first time, just got to much work to do nowdays

It normally helps you not look like a lemon sucking retard if you actually have something to back up your wild claims.

How do you prove you're in that category.
---
How do you stop a big bloc from forcing someone through anyway.
---
uh, wtf do you think we been doing in the north?
---
With plex prices as it is and inflation so high. You are proposing another limitation on isk making. By making a change like this you only hurt the whole of eve. Small groups, or newcomers to null the hardest because they would have to stray further from their limited defence fleet, if they had any. 
---
How about you try to think of something constructive instead of something that is clearly about hurting goons. It's decicions like this, the carrier nerf, titan nerf, and rorqual nerf that were all aimed at nerfing goons. That didn't work and hurt the other alliances more.

stop looking at "11km range", that's just the range the game shows you which is equal to optimal+falloff - look at how the module works instead.
---
wasting your time?

---
No Xenuria in this CSM???
---
I've hunted so many, reported so many, filed tickets too on places where it is just ridiculous.
---
You come back days/weeks later, sometimes they are still running, sometimes its new names doing exactly the same.
---
While I encourage all to report botters, it doesn't seem to have a lasting effect.
---
lowsec is not dead, there are still lowsec corps that have fun - there are plenty of WH groups fighting too

and there are NPSI groups that you can join freely, from Spectre Fleet to Bombers Bar, their ingame channels are:
---
* SF Spectre Fleet
---
* Bombers Bar
---
Idk about that. As much of a walking meme he is he probably plays eve more and cares about it more than anyone else on that list.
---
Gottem
---
That is pretty cool. Cyclone has one of the better ship models imo.
---
Please explain?
---
Gnosis, Praxis.
---
There are plenty of newbros but due to current gaming nature they want their pie right now and not wait/earn it with time.
---
Certainly an interesting composition. I wish all those the best of luck with making EVE slightly less fucking terrible.
---
the official goon tequila brand made it but stitch did not  
---
mixed feelings, i would be ok with wormholers being collateral damage tbh
---
Oh man it feels good

ACTUALLY GOOD Pog

thank fuck

olmeca paid more

Olmeca &lt;3

im sure olmeca will beat him too it

---
nomnom will be fine, aryth is going to have a stroke 36minutes into an olmeca suggestion
---
You think fighting a war is just done by FCs? Oh boy you might need your head out of the sand a little there.
---
It takes so so many other types of players to make the cogs of a successful war machine turn.
---
Olmeca is the only odd man out. If I had to guess will have a short term on csm. A wormholer also nice to see on csm but would like to see a hs person also.
---
Yep I don’t think he will stick around.
---
Can't dock up and pretend to be offline on the csm!
---
As a player that has no idea what this is about, I want to say, having 3 Representatives from the same alliance seems very, very, wrong.
---
Scary
---
It depends on what site and which class of wh. for c1 a low skilled gila or dual rep myrm can clear the sites. It will take a while, but they can clear them and have the slot space for one of the two different types of analyzer, and a spare high for a salvager. since both are drone ships, they should have spare space for salvage drones. Medium drones for gila, light drones for myrm.
---
For higher level c3 and up you will want to use dualbox domis or greater. and come back with a hacking ship.
---
hello why is this mod stickied
---
Good luck Olmeca. ~~disband the csm~~
---
best part of this election...Olmeca Gold in, Judge out.
---
Doubt it
---
Tried to kill a Prospect that was somehow tanking three sleeper battleships in a gas cloud, got blapped by the sleepers as soon as I uncloaked. [Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/71511072/)
---
You were never the WH CSM
---
OLMECA MADE IT OP SUCCESS BOIIIS
---
Starting a pool on how long until olmeca breaks down
---
how about ccp know their own game and can obviously tell if you are lying? wait thats a dream world noone at ccp plays
---
Doesn't seem like to be the world ark
---
Yeah, definitely a new ship
---
Kek, I'm nowhere near going for dual boxing are c3 sites solo able with something like talos?
---
It does. But you’re not understanding what I’m saying. They don’t have experience fighting under the new flex structures. The logistics needs to happen regardless of flex structures or if it’s a proper war or not and the logistics is almost entirely unaffected by them.
---
Not in this hemisphere
---
idea has no R in both hemisphere

If you wanna run T4 and especially T5, don't afraid to bling up your fit

Well at least there is a WH CSM and Olmeca. A bit sad for  LS but that was to be up expected
---
Are those the guys that just fly thrashers? We tried to fight you guys in destroyers the other day but you guys just wanted to fight Volta instead? Felt bad
---
Jibrish taught me how to be a mod
---
I would say shortly after the first meeting in Iceland.
---
And here I am sitting and wondering why it is still allowed to have more then 1 person of the same alliance be in the csm.
---
Much risk yes
---
he will leak something or when he finds out that he can't change a thing
---
They’re all alpha clones
---
CCP can use their own judgement to tell whether or not its legitimate? Its not like its a real life political system where the "law" has to be super specific and robust.
---
Nothing witty to say, good job mate. Will you be making the stl files available?
---
That's one.
---
Can't wait for the next vid!     I remember reading up on the tracking stuff a bit, and combined with my experience: Velocity is the easiest to identify and see a trend in quickly (I suppose, unless you're inhuman), angular velocity is the one that's the most accurate for your situation, and transversal is hardest to account for the parallax you get while you're also moving. This is all way too much information and I really just wanted to say that your video was a lot of fun to watch.
---
Alright, alright, I usually ignore Eve posts as I haven't played in so long unless there's a good, meme-able war on like WWB, but I have to ask, when did Gobbins come back? I remember him making an elaborate post saying Eve is kill for him or something.
---
Last time C02 died. RIP PH
---
ofc he was brisc was omg the best everything ever csm member
---
defo not just a failed politician specialising in legalized bribery
---
Steve is high sec
---
Olmeca, You are this council but we do not grant you the rank of master...
---
lmao you're telling me that f1 pushers and backseat economists/paper pushers understand pvp combat mechanics and balance?
---
Talos would die horribly. Try a Gila.
---
Dunk knows how to cut threw bullshit to get things done.   Best person to deal with CCP corp execs...is to send our own irl corp exec.   He will better understand their side, which will help our csm team with how they approach things.  I like this csm line up.
---
yes
---
Maybe
---
the point of the KS is that its meant to house previously undockable ships. supers and titans were referred to as coffins because once you were in one you werent leaving them. people would sell their supers just to get out of them so that they could actually play the game instead of only logging in occasionally to drop something or get into a 10% tidi fight. it was also causing people to unsub that account or quit. a way to keep supers/titans safe while not being in one is a very good thing for the game, although maybe allowing everyone else to see where the ships are would have been nice (unbumpable moored/teathered ships outside the station or something like that).
---
allowing other structures including ansibles on a KS grid and the amount of damage a KS can output is a different question that is probably a better discussion. i guess you could also argue that keeps should be replaced with a titan/super only mooring structure that doesnt have its own defenses, but a safe(ish) place to put a super is 100% good for the game and theres really no tenable ground against that.
---
It's not  wrong, it's just they have a lot of people inside that alliance and they are good at primoting and making people vote for their candidate. Others are just bad at it.
---
I tried stratos and barely escaped. Haven't heard about gila, what faction ship it is and what specialization
---
Same. Gives me some hope that CSM 14 won’t be a complete degenerative waste with Exooki and Olmeca on board. Somebody needs to advocate for small-scale PVP.
---
Dunno, Horde have been very active on encouraging people to vote as well (hence gobbins, and tbh partly Olmeca too).
---
Am I the only one to notice there's 10 not 14 of them?
---
That’s a lot of tinfoil there friend :)
---
We’ve had luck doing the log off trap on the forts themselves.  However they often still make it before we can get the bubble up.  Right now we are working on another idea based off of reviewing the code from a common botting program.  Hopefully we’ll have a much better kill rate.
---
he should teach you to unsticky the 9 day old weekly questions thread
---
Olmeca Gold is on the CSM!
---
Thought he was lowsec
---
Warped my main to my alt corp's POS. Forgot to put in the starbase password and set proper standings.
---
And poof went the Manticore.
---
That means they had one of gobbins, killah bee, and olmeca...
---
Its going to come down to does he just give up when he realizes that no one at CCP gives a fuck about his grandiose changes he feels the game needs that he has thought up, or stick around and just wait out the term.
---
what would it take for you to delete your accout
---
Gf, was close. There's always next year :)
---
&gt; I oppose this for reasons I have yet to think of.
---
This guy was ahead of his time
---
You mean "Vassal state"
---
**Totally independent lol
---
I don’t see the fat lady
---
Probably nothing, that's true. But at least you'd have some kind of filter.
---
If I could bait this much rage, I'd welp just to see it happen. 
---
RAWR! you get'm mister anon coward!
---
Hardly. Hunters often utilize the cynos to safely attack.
---
Love how the new CEO is an ex-Brave Newbies member...Definately not a spy though..
---
How many of the 447 accounts that voted just for Olmeca Gold do you think were alts he funded by booshing excavators?
---
As others said breaking the nda might happen first.
---
I lost my last real life campaign by 56 votes. That was a punch in the balls. This is worse.
---
War
---
More high sec than anyone in game
---
Alot
---
JUST DO IT!
---
Olmeca being elected on the first run is just proof that with more organization we could.have more "independant" candidates
---
seen this before lol i love its still about
---
lol, proper war. we've has some combat, but not our fault NC and PL are shit.
---
Both are giveaway ships, they can't be built iirc. So supply is limited but they are not rare like the AT price ships. They're pretty common atm and should be available on the market for reasonable prices. 
---
I have three of each from the recent anniversary daily login challenge.
---
&gt;he is he probably plays eve more and cares about it more than anyone else on that list.
---
Which makes it much more likely that he breaks down and spills the beans while ranting about how CCP won't listen to or act on his change suggestions.
---
447
---
Be rude to people on a twitch stream
---
seriously, olmeca was on the horde ballot?
---
" That was a fun roam "
---
they died on the undock?
---
lol
---
105 votes for a Darwin shitler, thanks guys :D
---
I don't know about *that*. I know more highsec people than me.
---
About as long once he realizes CSM isn't some smokey backroom deals like Soprano's or Homeland, but more standard corporate meetings with pre-meeting meetings and snorefest most of us have at the office.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77026138/
---
Most timers have been when Im walking out the door to go to work, not much I can do about that bit.
---
Highsec, spreadsheets, and indy. He's probably the top of that world and gets the stats for everyone else.
---
However he's usually voted on not because of his background because he's a huge value added as CSM. You can look at his track record in previous meetings and he's always there contributing genuinely insightful stuff.
---
So it's not quite all the slides. I missed the data about Project Discovery. 
---
The Keynote covered mostly the evolution of PvE, Player retention, Bots, Project Discovery, Aether Wars, and the Trig Invasion. A lot of the juicy bits should be in the Eve Development Variety Hour.
---
Also, there were a ton of really cool wallpapers. If CCP Falcon could negotiate the release of them that would be super cool!
---
I see him giving up on the CSM and breaking NDA as being a two step process. He gives up because they won't let him author all the changes, which results in him posting on reddit and telling everyone what they are going to do and why its stupid triggering the NDA ban.
---
"This system is a Triglavian-free zone."
---
have my upvote sir
---
You got some trash advise from this guy. A lot of the faction cruisers are meh, including the ashimuu and you’re not going to do anything in HS with a battleship unless you’re with something smaller. You’re better off with going T2 all the way. 
---
Instead of a sac, I might suggest a Deimos. 
---
It tanks a lot more than a Vaga, you are mainly looking to go up against 1 other ship, in which case you can tank anything that puts out less than 900 dps. The sac can either tank like 400-500 or fit a buffer. If you don’t have logi, Deimos &gt; sac for what you are doing.
---
There are 10 CSM members. 14 is the number of this CSM, as in, there have been 13 other sets of councilmembers before this one.
---
I feel you, broheim. I'm always logi so I never get on any killmails.
---
Gl bro you are not alone
---
You must be new here.
---
Just don't do them. It's not worth. And if someone says they're, they haven't lose their 5b gila yet, but they will before recovering their isk.
---
f
---
But even better, no Matterall.
---
You're good man. I've been on and off for 12 years. Still lost at times.
---
Ok fair, i exagerrated for reply effect. You are a deserving long running csm member. Actually on my ballot right after the small gang, solo pilots, olmeca, stitch, insidious, exookiz :)
---
Why the hacking ship? As we're talking rats we're talking sleeper, not pirate sites. Thought the ISK was in the salvage/loot, not the cans.
---
Yeah next time all the community needs to do is field a bunch more meme candidates.
---
Gila is pretty good for C3 Sites, check youtube for some Videos.
---
Be aware that you need good shield skills to survive in a C3 Gila
---
I'm still fairly new so I'm not sure if I can afford it not sure what is reasonable price for longer term players
---
If there is an easy way for Alliance/Corporation leaders to identify bots then CCP also have access to that SAME information and can also use it to identify bots.  
---
I continue to fail to understand why the onus is on alliance/corp leaders to identify and remove bots when CCP have more access to the information needed to identify them.
---
Lol buttmad
---
Alpha Clones in nyxes aye?
---
Plus all the tools you have that we all use :)
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
I am guessing you don't need a reminder to post your salt, eh?
---
Much more puzzlement than rage. A genuine "WTF is wrong with you?" reaction from almost everyone.
---
Killah Bee was on our ballot. It's fairly standard for us to vote in guys from other ingame coalitions if we think they're effective and like working with them.
---
That's a nice round number of 50 voting for Matterall with a identical ticket. How much did that cost you? /u/matterall373
---
\#SummerCallout
---
So like 1/10th of the way into the suggestion
---
“Reeeee fuckin goons rigged it reeeeee”
---
Soon tm
---
Lmfao have you ever tried doing anything  demanding on two or more accounts simultaneously?
---
i knew they were fucking things up, but i didn't think they were doing it so literally.
---
all of them?
---
It's just the new no-ugly green-screen feature that lets you hide things that look stupid while streaming.  You can turn it off in settings.
---
I love when people get on the CSM you "play eve"
---
You mean Dunk got tons of experience with handling bloated middle management types?
---
Citation needed.
---
Seems about the same tbh. We traded Jin'Taan and Suitonia for ExookiZ and Olmeca which is a downgrade tbh. With the exception of Steve who was relected, it's still 7 generic null block candidates who love cyno jammers in keepstar doomsday range who will advocate for the same dogshit citadel and entosis mechanics that killed the game.
---
&gt; he is a people expert.
---
a creative way to write useless.
---
Damned Eve players -- they ruined Eve playing!
---
You mean like Fcing on one account, logi on another account and scouting on a third ????
---
Yeah, fuck people with a passion for the game they can't be trusted.
---
Thank god
---
i already own like a dozen other domains that i dont use tho :( i got owned last year when i got slapped with like 150$ in renewals for domains that i didnt even want anymore
---
Well actually it's the opposite but ok.
---
“Too risk averse!” Does something risk averse but it does not count because “they blobbing reee”. Make your mind up smoothbrain.
---
Have you looked at the people on the list?
---
eyes emoji
---
Advocate for all the changes test wants.
---
What and who did he pay then? He just had the support of a lot of content creators and bombers bar. He also got like 300 votes just from his and mar5hys alts.
---
Yep. Just after the "here's why I'm qualified to talk about this" stage and just before the "I understand that this idea may be unpopular" stage.
---
How would one enforce such a rule? Joining and leaving an alliance is a matter of seconds.
---
Bruh, it's dank PvP memes.
---
It's not krabbing.
---
He does actually. He's upper management in the tech industry I believe.
---
I don't care. If I go for a roam I want to fight people. The only reason I ever shot people ratting or mining was to get people to undock a response fleet. Who cares if I kill vni bot number 734 the botters don't and I don't either.
---
I'm really glad Olmecca and Exooki got elected, I have a feeling these two can push for some great improvements in the game.
---
The salt in this post will keep EvE running for year. You are the real hero 🦸‍♂️
---
You should be happy, bots are the only content you get in NS. :D
---
E-mail was sent out for those interested:
---
''You read that subject line correctly: [EVE: Aether Wars Phase Two](https://www.hadean.com/eveaetherwars?hsCtaTracking=493fcdc5-3c90-4751-80e3-58ed8fd0556b%7C4f4122fe-77e4-4af1-a335-467b1f2cb711) is on the way, having just been announced at CCP Games’ EVE North event.
---
The original EVE: Aether Wars was a ground-breaking tech demo that showed the power and reliability of our Aether Engine technology, bringing [together 3,852 players](https://www.hadean.com/blog/gdc-2019-10000-ships-in-a-single-battle) in a single battle at the showfloor of GDC earlier this year.
---
As for Phase Two? You’ll have to wait a little longer for the first details... but you can get a head-start on the other pilots by signing up at [www.hadean.com/eveaetherwars](www.hadean.com/eveaetherwars). We’re thrilled to be working with CCP Games again, pushing our Aether Engine technology in unique and revolutionary ways.
---
To celebrate the announcement, we’ve redesigned our website from top to bottom, so head over to [www.hadean.com](www.hadean.com) and poke and proud at our swanky new design. We’d love to hear your feedback so let us know on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aetherengine/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hadeaninc) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/qxKY3gs), where you can also join our growing Aether Wars community!
---
Do it in a wormhole with a static null.
---
Your killboard might be unclear here when I say your killboard I mean braves, that's how I know when you drop dreads and on what you drop them and honestly, the only pattern I could find is you where losing.
---
Like based on killboard stats here is how the fights go: group A brings some comp to your space you engage in subcaps if you start to lose you escalate to caps, then you take all the fights you win because you already have a numbers advantage and go see we don't drop all that often.
---
Yes. It's typical negative discourse politics. It's obvious olmeca plays the game and I genuinely believe he cares about it. But several others on there regularly play the game, and I think even more care heavily about it still.
---
Nice, Olmeca did it :D
---
So 7 big nullsec bloc guys, 1 npsi guy and 2 others?
---
While botting is a thing, I think a lot of people just aren't good hunters. You kind of hit the nail on the head there.
---
Yeah
---
Surprising to see Steve and Exookiz in there, a welcome one of course, but still surprising.
---
how do they respond to anchored bubbles?
---
Gila is the gurista faction cruiser. Normally shield tanked with drones and missiles. It gets bonuses to shield resist, medium drone damage, and missile damage. Pretty common go to for c2 and some c3 sites if you spend a bit.
---
U r gay.
---
Best idea is to restrict CSM to 1 member per alliance. You get too many "deals" going on in the background otherwise.
---
Case and point cloaky campers are still unmanageable and the biggest ally uses it to their advantage by voting against any changes that would help.
---
cant find judge on that list? did he run out of ISK?
---
Gonna check it after I get home, I have only done ship trees to unlock industry Ore ships and stratos
---
ok
---
he was actively pursuing buying votes in his ama thread, that said.. dont get me wrong its a very viable way to get on the csm. if you have the funds, and you want on, go for it
---
New Pearl Abyss   mods must have opened a loot box
---
i agree
---
are we now at the level of clickbait reddit threads
---
OMG MUST WATCH
---
Someone is salty
---
Is Omega worth? look, it's 15 usd each month. Unless you live in Africa I would be sure to say it's little to now money.
---
Pls fix ur links, thxs
---
Structure grinding is now the new meta.
---
So confirmed that killah is switching sides now after grabbing the NC. votes and losing the war?
---
And let's vote for all goon CSM, in the name of the Mittani, the botting super and the holy rorq. Amen!
---
Not me friend, most of the people I wanted are in :)
---
Sounds like a extremely bad state of eve.
---
It’s almost as if I had to pay a billion spacebucks in order to buy the information packets necessary to learn how to fly these ships.
---
If you can't afford to loose it repeatedly, don't buy it.
---
Or even a lowly Horde bean checking passports....
---
Yet you are calling some candidates meme candidates.
---
The praxis is the both the cheapest and least skill-point dependant battleship hull. It's a very solid choice for beginners since it comes with max bonuses for all weapon systems by default. Just beware it's terrible speed
---
Null is too stagnant because the carebears made it that way.
---
Well then you are part of the problem, as you did not exercise your right to vote.
---
No, just one. I'm interested to see how Olmeca interacts with the CSM and if he can set aside bias.
---
Oh it could be a lot more clickbatey
---
"Toronto time"
---
1. Fix the amount of Havens that can be in a system. Make it really low so space is more valuable. 
---
2. Counter act the fact that there are fewer of them by making them worth wayyyyy more isk.
---
3. Make it so that you can't *do the 9/10 and 10/10 hardest combat anomalies in nullsec in a fucking t1 cruiser.*
---
VedHIC please!
---
He means turn up the input on the mic so you don't have to jack the volume on the saved file in your audio editing software of choice.
---
show me
---
or mango XDDDDDDDD
---
Yeah, disappointed Stitch didn't make it in
---
well didn't mar5hy not to long ago say he had 186 or so and olmeca has a few too , so like 1/2 the votes were from 2 actual people ?
---
The only reason why he got in last time was he was on PH's ballot.
---
We EVE players sure are a contentious people
---
Stagnate CSM like he did to null politics.
---
Ever wonder why ccp disabled warp stabs in faction warfare but forgot to stop ventures plexing things? hmmmm sounds like ccp like botting confirmed
---
&gt;There is an important call out that I would like to make. We have identified a single vote that has been cast on a character outside of the CSM 14 ballot.
---
Which one of you fucks did that
---
What the name of the original video?
---
fucking retarded post this doesnt even make sense
---
I didnt know it was q subscription game like WoW
---
There was nothing to indicate this beforehand
---
Every method I've read about here and on the forums seems to be always countered  by pointing out the sometimes massive, sometimes not, second and third order effects they would have on the rest of gameplay. This would be changing the one button you click now to a different kind of button. 
---
But assuming there are many other methods, what's the reasoning for them not to be implemented, ignoring the fact that CAPTCHAs are "good enough" for solving this same problem for a great many large, real world companies?
---
A Fedup member
---
Well neighter exooki nor Olmeca are reall Nullbears
---
You sure don't have bias yourself :)
---
&gt; Grosse Point Blank
---
Thanks.
---
and .... ;) that's how GSM was set up from the start.
---
Yeah, I was referring to Olmeca. He pretty much ran on an agenda of making null less safe.
---
Whether that's going to change anything, I don't know.
---
if there's no risk then there's no risk lmao kneeler
---
Fair, but CAPTCHAs must stop many other types of bots or it wouldn't be such a ubiquitous part of online life. If you stop some, presumably the "simplest" and logically cheapest/most common bots, that would be a win at the expense of "player experience" by way of clicking a different kind of button than the one we click now.
---
God all the nubee salt here is fucking awesome.
---
Good luck, Olmeca!
---
Search channel name "rhiload"
---
And sub to his channel in case he upload some meme in the next century
---
Im biased to a point like literally anyone, but it's possible to take a step back and have meaningful discussions about things that impact the game and work together to try to make things better. Last year's csm was able to do this well, limited by the constraints of what ccp can actually accomplish. Hopefully the new csm members can do the same.
---
I'm really interested to see the final numbers.
---
Then why do we have to do it to access legit multimillion dollar companies' services? I'm not a computer scientist, maybe you are but your argument isn't well made. If it's easy to make and use, okay, let's knock out the low hanging fruit for, in my mind, literally no cost to human players. When these Indian 12 year olds are breaking all these security tools you mean, I have to imagine there's a bigger payout and incentive to them than some video game space bucks.
---
in fairness, gobbins is heavily on record trashing citadel mechanics, and vily is no fan of jammers as currently implemented.
---
In lowsec people rarely scan your ship in advance. They will blow up everything they can to see if they might drop something nice. It can be fun gameplay if you get lucky and find huge treasure.
---
It's a sandbox. You are free to play it the way to want.
---
Of?
---
Okay, but if it's in space it can be hunted down and killed. If it's docked, it can't. 
---
Isn't that content?
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/resources/auditLog14.txt for anyone curious about how it went
---
No scripts are available to get bots to vote. Otherwise F̶r̶a̶t̶ Gewns would have all 10 CSM positions.
---
FTFY
---
I don't even know how you would draw that line.
---
What level of play do you need to be at to be considered a wormholer? How much wormholes do you have had to do. I use wormholes to travel around null. Do I count?
---
Down goes Sort Dragon (sorta).
---
To be fair. Thats accurate. Lol
---
There's an official ballot that we follow.  And, that was pretty much what was elected.
---
Wow, just like real life politics, folks voted for an idiot. Of course, I'm talking about Olmeca Bronze.  I look forward to the meeting minutes where he is utterly lost. 
---
And no, not salty. My preferred candidates got in.
---
A rock. 
---
Doing an escalation in a tengu was orbiting, didn't realise a rock was in my path. Ran into it and was pretty fucked as I was effectively stuck on the rock and couldn't warp off.
---
ill be willing to bet olmeca has more hours in-game per day (average) than anyone on that list. the man has 40 accounts that aren't just skillfarms. like do you expect me to believe aryth spends more time in game than on his excel spreadsheet or whatever?
---
Huh what? Intys not nullified anymore?! Since when????
---
Wow those new player retention rates are ridiculous.
---
HAH! No matterall, get fucked, you and your loot boxes/golden ammo.
---
I'm sure there are bots to break everything, but it's a matter of cost and incentive. There are people who broke into the DOD and Office of Personnel Management. Someone broke into Iran's nuclear program and physically destroyed their centrifuges. And someone is writing bots for a video game where ships fly back and forth and do the same thing repeatedly when another player joins or leaves their little slice of video game. 
---
I have trouble thinking that the main purveyors of bots are these well trained, state sponsored hacking collectives. If even some of the bots are just amateurish scripts made for fun and/or very, very limited real world profit, then those are some that can be locked out at what I consider no real cost to player experience: click a new kind of button than the kind of button we click now.
---
Dont worry about olmeca he'll either not show up/realise he can't change anything and fall in line/ or infinitely funnier jump on reddit have a melt found, break nda and be perma banned
---
Yep, nr. 5 on our list
---
DELETE
---
RENTER
---
LANDLORDS
---
No, talos sucks for pretty much everything except ganking freighters in hisec, 
---
There were a few t3c fits that could run c3 sites solo, I dont know if any of them are still viable. Dual domis were the cheapest and fastest answer. And still are. 
---
Stick with c1 and 2 if you are actually solo. Make a chart of the sites and the max dps with wave trigger ships just so you know what to expect, or search for one of the several that are already floating around. CCP hasnt changed any of the sites for a long time I think. 
---
All c1 should be doable with a dual rep myrm. Gila should be able to do the c2 sites though may have trouble in the hacking sites. T3c should be able to do all c2 sites and the two lower dps c3 anom sites. I remember my xlsb loki had some trouble in the hacking sites but was dependant on manuvering. This was five or more years ago. 
---
The nestor can run c1 sites solo, but it kind of sucks. dual RR nestors can run c4 sites, while tinker rattles or 3+ rr nestors can run c5 and 6.
---
When you get to c3 you really do want two accounts. or friends.
---
1 oog service guy?
---
Combat interceptors, such as Claw, Taranis are no longer nullified. Stiletto and Ares still are. For a few months now, 6 at least I think.
---
Olmeca gets elected: "it's goons fault".
---
Olmeca doesn't get elected: "it's goons fault".
---
Possibly, I don't know they do. How do you know they do? And I'll assume you're right and there are those that smoke CALTCHAs all day, but it's still somewhat effective or companies who deal with lots and lots of real world money wouldn't use them to protect access to their services. 
---
Ya know what also doesn't stop bots? Doing nothing about it when there's at least one very painless way the rest of the universe has to solve this exact problem. That's what this is about, making the solution simple and painless to players.
---
At least he knows he didn't get scammed
---
Probably not an awful idea!
---
Pretty sad my boy stitch didn't make it but exooki and olmeca making it was a nice consolation prize. Still aids how many nullbloc members there are though.
---
Turns out sp farmers are honorable people
---
Lol. No. Gobbins literally ran away from Goons. It is all he knows how to do.
---
I simply can't read Dotlan, it just looks like noise to me. This is very easy on the eyes and I can actually make geographic sense of things.
---
&gt;If you don't agree with me, then don't post about it.&lt;
---
Fixed that for you.
---
*\*TEST Ballot for lazy people who couldn't be bothered to add extras\**
---
lul
---
Same, all my accounts were stitch/exooki/olmeca.
---
So you are saying you want goon csm to join a rando 1 person alliance during their campaign then rejoin goons after
---
By their own intuition? if they actually played it would not be difficult to see if goons were just putting people in WH for this specific reason and therefore disqualify them. TBH regardless of their knowledge you should not be allowed more than a couple members from any single alliance or coalition, as ultimately any goon representative will do whatever is best for goons, even if its a negative for their area of space.
---
who hurt you lmao
---
Define a coalition.
---
I mean, you FC a fleet literally every weekend. But you obviously don't play Eve.
---
And heaven forbid you get a kill on an alt good sir!
---
Inb4 PH suffers the same fate lol
---
Erm, no. Not even close. But thanks for playing!
---
Update: The inital round had a quota of 3000, round 31's quota was 2908
---
Inanimate Carbon Rod will not be silenced!
---
Why won't they fight us massively outnumbered reeeeeee
---
So FCing a fleet every Saturday night for over 3 years running means they don't actually fight? Along with numerous small gang fleets?
---
More like fortunately sort dragon lost by an 11 vote margin.
---
I agree. I was trying to be gracious.
---
&gt;Unfortunately Sort Dragon lost by an 11 vote margin.
---
unfortunately because it wasn't more than 11?....
---
No, having Olmeca on it means it WILL be a degenerative waste.
---
Killah bee understands null and isn't a complete sperg wars are short, csm is a whole year having competent people is important
---
Why the fuck did you sticky this comment
---
Nor are goons..
---
Casino war*
---
What did they say about bots and player retention?
---
Kinda out of the loop what's there biases?
---
Let's revisit how this turns out
---
Out of the loop can I get the spark notes?
---
You mad bro?  Is it because imperium got 8/10 elects and you're mad?
---
My roommates and I when every conversation if long enough eventually comes back to an eve analogy
---
huh, not bad, and looked like it might have been a good fight as well. consider me surprised
---
Didn't vote, don't care because the CSM has about as much influence on CCP policies as blowing on the sea has on the tide.
---
Actually 8/10 INIT voted for the Wh guy
---
Send 1 Trilion isk to the StainGuy ingame
---
You're comparing major extremes from the field so no I don't expect them to be alike in specific experiences, and fortunately you don't either and you're just trying to make a hyperbolic argument. Does olmeca know more about multi boxing, blopsing, hunting, etc. than aryth? I'd wager yes. Does aryth have more experience from an economic and industry perspective? Again, I'd wager yes.
---
The draw to this game is the multiple facets of playstyles that intermingle. If you're trying to dilute contributions of past csms because you like a new csm more, then that's not supportive either. The fact is veteran CSMs have continued to learn what sort of changes they can and cannot try to affect. Knowing how they can focus their efforts (for the love of God fucking nerf ceptor nullification) to make changes hat make the game better for as many players as possible is critical. Knowing how to interact with others in a social situation that isn't just "I'm trying to steal your drones" or "I'm trying to get rich by manipulating the market" is critical. In this role the CSM members need to be able to step back to see the game and community as a whole. 
---
But back to the point - Tldr is that every single person on the csm got their position because of their combined abilities and support of people that believe in them. Hopefully we continue to see meaningful changes that make the game better.
---
I agree.
---
Geminate is a nice place.
---
It won't that's not how the csm works
---
Olmeca gold, obviously.
---
Tbf it isn't that hard to track if someone leaves an alliance to join csm and then goes back to the alliance.
---
Olmeca almost  exclusively farms delve and uses his experiences as a foundation for his platform of "botting is a problem" (something literally every legit player in the game can agree on). What he fails to do is focus on less convenient regions where it's even more of a problem because it's inconvenient for his play style and/or he doesn't actually care about botting and just wants to focus on goons. We'll see, I'm excited at the prospect of him meeting people face to face and getting a better picture of what everyone else in the game is about.
---
Eve is a niche game to begin with, and the best way to fail is to try and please everyone. Don't get me wrong I love when newer folks join the game, but what makes EVE unique is the reward for overcoming the difficulty cliff.
---
tbh i wonder how many real people voted on him.
---
I'm confused, doesn't that list show Stitch above Steve?
---
Oof yeah
---
I can tell you exactly what will happen and how it will happen without any risk of The Plan~ being jeopardized. Reddit has unwittingly flexed it's voting potential to put Olmeca Gold onto the CSM. There is a reason Olmeca Gold didn't appear on any Imperium ballots. We couldn't allow for any indication that we actually wanted him on the CSM. Not even to our line members, it had to be you; reddit that put him there...
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the /r/eve crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium.  The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium. 
---
All of this will happen and there isn't a damn thing any of you can do about it. Even if a small percentage of you are self aware enough to accept what is happening, it's already too late. The election is over and no amount of information control will halt the downfall of reddit voter turnout.
---
The past 3 years I have canvased here knowing full well that you would never willingly accept The Key~ to your shackles even if presented to you. The ultimate argument inoculation, the ultimate dead agenting of an enemy group. It's too late, there is nothing you can do. I have already won.
---
Sort, no idea.
---
The Judge though, he is a player who actually cares about the health of the game, sucks that people can't see past him fucking over co2 to see he was a great CSM member.
---
Meh
---
Much more... he covers every major battle he is either part of or is told about. Regarding the area - that is the conflict around Black Rise or other low-sec regions, Snuff, Shoot First, DHSJ etc - he had covered 6 battles over the course of the last two months + the in detail "war declaration" article that Jin references.
---
Can't wait for the stream of but hurt goons on Reddit now that olmeca got chosen.
---
Ignore this comment, using it to unsticky dumbdwarfs idiot comment.
---
He lacked the gold ammo required to get votes. Insert more PLEX for votes next time maybe?
---

Psssttt don’t do drugs kids
---
That's way too much work. Better complain on reddit that the other side doesn't tell your side of the story properly.
---
Steve has long been a staple on the Goon Ballot.
---
Shows how stupid Horde is.
---
Also sorts by range from top to bottom.
---
It easy to make a new email account. I don’t think this will work.
---
Herd mentality and TOPMEN / diplo teams made it that way. You never know...maybe Goons, Test, FRT, and INIT will all collapse at the same time and 0.0 will return to the real wild west.
---
Lololol. Exooki, maybe.
---
Olmeca? Lololololol
---
I don't get why horde is unable/unwilling to fight Goons 1v1.

Nah, he'll hold out for a while.

Eventually he'll see some "sign" that someone else broke the NDA and think its open season then get busted.
---
Welcome to our new AFK Myrm overlords.
---
Sorry buddy. I voted for you at 5 at least with my accounts.
---
Looking at this wouldn’t the dps be the same as a myrm?
---
How are you this mad about kiting
---
F
---
Joe Painter for instance. Lol, sorry Joe!
---
Yes it does, but neither of them reached the 3000 vote quota, so their deciding factor was pushed down to further rounds. Round 32 specifically:
---
    Round 32 beginning - 13 candidates remain
---
    32231 votes, 2931 quota
---
    Initial talley:
---
      7340 "Aryth"
---
      5292 "Gobbins"
---
      3714 "Olmeca Gold"
---
      3194 "Vily"
---
      2551 "Killah Bee"
---
      1993 "ExookiZ"
---
      1750 "Dunk Dinkle"
---
      1637 "Steve Ronuken"
---
      1623 "Sort Dragon"
---
      1269 "Stitch Kaneland"
---
      810 "Cornak Firefist"
---
      541 "Innominate"
---
      517 "Merkelchen"
---
After everyone's votes transferred, Steve got even more of a lead, and Stitch was the lowest voted candidate:
---
     Pre-elimination tally:
---
      2445 "Dunk Dinkle"
---
      2367 "Innominate"
---
      2232 "Sort Dragon"
---
      2154 "ExookiZ"
---
      1888 "Steve Ronuken"
---
      1508 "Cornak Firefist"
---
      1504 "Stitch Kaneland"
---
      Elimination: "Stitch Kaneland" with 1504.350985 votes
---
Hence, Stitch actually wasn't voted more times than Steve.
---
Gallente FW on suicide watch
---
responding to anything said about olmecca to say something negative about him and now this wall of text 
---
lol did he steal your excavs?
---
Xenuria really is batshit crazy
---
And everyone would be scared as fuck to change alliances if they are running for CSM because they might get shot for it.
---
I am not surprised that EVE players are able to break things. I am also not surprised that it was possible.  
---
What I really want to know: Now that people know it *can* be done, will they try to do it on the next election?
---
Ok. Do you know how easy it is to create a new Alliance in game?
---
Wtf
---
Oh It can be even more rookie. Normally only use 1 account but had to get me a Fax alt in order to allow flying a super in fleets.
---
Myrm is definitely going to be more if we're just talking drones for afk stuff.
---
i always assumed Xenuria was a meme v0v
---
It's a downgrade for lowsec and an upgrade for w-space from the looks of it. We've got two people who will probably notice if CCP makes wormholes "collateral damage" again, which is two more than we had.
---
Are you really that much of a koolaid drinker you believe he only got elected because of bots?
---
Why would bots vote for one of the most vocal CSM candidates against botting?
---
No Brisc there to record :(
---
Xenuria: not even once.
---
where did they publish the number of votes?
---
We don't talk about pre-2014 eve anymore
---
There are people with over 100 characters that they skill farm with. That's easily 30 something votes. 
---
Considering eve's playerbase isn't 100% people, and that many don't vote, it's an issue, as is the ability to make new account, buy plex, vote, repeat.
---
for the base hull:
---
+5% drone tracking
---
+10% hybrid damage and tracking 
---
+7.5% armor rep amount
---
+1 turret highslot
---
+ better fitting 
---
-lower max velocity
---
-higher inertia
---
-lower mass
---
+faster align time
---
There were something like 1500 votes cast.
---
uhm
---
&gt; You are this council 
---
I assume this was unintentional, but it's great. Please don't edit.
---
afk domis are way easier tbh, you roll two t2 or cheap faction rappers with a cheap abyssal mod to get it a bit more efficient, some cap in mid slots, permatank havens and stuff for days.
---
Fit an mjd and some heavy neuts and tackle ceptors are dealt with too.
---
Could you compress the image a bit more please? I can still sort of recognize some of the characters.
---
I assume this is Zenuria being self-aware enough to allude to the fact that this is precisely why *he* was on the goonswarm ballot
---
no, he's really that crazy
---
I am very sad that you did not edit the reflection of NC. in the shop window
---
Agree - RIP VNI's, hullo AFK Myrm's going forward.
---
The problem with olmeca is that he's literally fucking insane. The easiest way to shut down his operations is just to mock him in local. He'll be there for at least the next hour melting the fuck down. I cannot wait for the comedy gold that comes from him being on the CSM.
---

---
Lol mining. No, just talking about current events friend.
---
this is really a half-arsed approach, you need to fix drones themselves if you wanna counter afk ratting
---
Wet toilet paper brain
---
alcohol and gateguns
---
So I got within 4 votes of you even with my low quality shitpost. You must be reallly bad too
---
Rorq don't have linear scaling. If they would then yeah it would be just a flat reduction over the board. But the scaling is more exponential. Cuz you don't do only rorq mining on rorq characters.
---
There are open source, public capcha-solving bots. The people who actually make eve bots are not stupid. Make a few google searches if you don't believe me. 
---
The average bot user downloads some random alliance-sanctioned bot, clicks the "vni ratting preset" and goes to sleep. It's not about these people. It's about people who make the bots. 
---
It does not take a state-sponsored hacker to write a bot for a video game. An amateur programmer can do it.
---
Gallente Cruiser bonuses (per skill level):
---
10% bonus to Drone hitpoints, damage, and tracking speed (was 10% HP/Damage/Mining and 5% tracking)
---
10% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret damage and tracking speed (new)
---
7.5 bonus to armor repair amount (new)
---
Slot layout: 4H, 4M, 6L, 3 (+1) turrets
---
3 Rig Slots, 400 Calibration
---
Fittings: 850 (+50) PWG, 350 (+40) CPU
---
Defense (shields / armor / hull): 1650 / 3000 / 3000
---
Capacitor (amount / recharge rate / average cap per second): 1500 / 490s / 3.06
---
Mobility (max velocity / inertia / mass / warp speed / align time): 210 (-10) / 0.51 (+0.07) / 9,700,000 (-1,610,000) / 3 / 6.86s (-0.04)
---
Drones (bandwidth / bay): 75 (-50) / 200
---

---
Sensor strength: 20 Magnetometric
---
Signature radius: 130 (-15)
---
Cargo Capacity: 460
---
So looking at this afk ratters will use low to high end. Vexor, vni/myrm, gila, domni then Ishtar. With tic dropping 5-7mil on vni accounts.
---
Maximum spodbrain.
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
what is your assuredly retarded idea for fixing drones?
---
Nice T shirt, bro.
---
Innoms a mild tempered chill dude IRL
---
Nerfing the VNI is the prerequisite to a FW rework. No more single faction controlling the supply of PVE ships. Tackling the problem of citadels, the oppressive presence of supers, removing Warzone tiers, creating militia-controlled nullsec constellations in NPC null, adding 4-way war, removing security status penalties in military complexes for aggressing those filthy piwates and we might have something that may convince me to resub. Maaaaaybe.
---
Dank ratting space to fund our Kikimora dreams.
---
Breaking News: Active shooter in Reykjavik, Iceland. Reports are coming in of a hostage situation at CCP Games headquarters. Nearby witnesses report hearing the suspect yelling about his desire to "fix EVE" and "stop the goons", though we are not sure what he means at this time. Stay tuned for more information.
---
Nope
---
:cripes:
---
Thanks im dumber now
---
remove auto aggro ?
---
Myrmidon has less DPs, horrible drone tracking, harder for alpha botters to mass, easier to catch 
---
At least a good news for roaming hunters in null
---
Yeah, feels bad
---
With just drones it should have the same dps as a drone only vexor
---
"Potential" "To be confirmed"  
---
I'm sure my grandchildren will enjoy these.
---
I'll believe it when I see it
---
This will be a glorious copy-pasta
---
Look at how many hull bonuses CCP is packing into that ship
---
That's the balance throwing out of window
---
So... Ishtar or Myrm for afk ratting anoms?
---
they even got the CCP tag line on their sign-up page: "Coming Soon"
---
You're using tornados...with a 16 second cycle time...you're only blapping one target
---
Track how many NPC kills were by drones. Scale number of elite frig spawns in exponential proportion. 
---
Boom. Solved.
---
Just like how in games like Metal Gear Solid V, if you keep cheesing the enemies using a particular kind of attack (headshots, gas etc) they'll eventually adapt.
---
i think him and his crop m8 are running like 500 omega accounts.    
---
Listen his csm podcast on TIS
---
Is there a group message dump where we can send all of our unreasonable demands to the new CSM for consideration? 
---
I want to make some stupid recommendations without evemailing them individually because who uses evemail anymore?
---
Inb4 Trig Command Ship and Blops
---
That never worked properly in MGSV just fyi, I would know lol, cheesy headshots was my game.
---
sounds like:
---
The direction of the flow approaches liminality,
---
Cladistic proving is all that remains from (ensis?)
---
You shall join the flow or be extirpated
---
How does PP has worst range than Hail?
---
No, ccp has no business going through my non-eve stuff. Besides, must be easier to flag on behaviour.
---
You have no idea how much wonders this will work for NPSI FCs. Particularly Bomber FC. Awesome!
---
Cheap will be myrm the mid domni experience gila/Ishtar
---
Man I really hope they unfuck this, it would be a great change.
---
Xenuria is retarded tho
---
Have they released the vote counts?
---
Its all Isk. Its not great, but its still isk
---
Treating the symptoms and not the cause.
---
Also:
---
REMOVE DRONE AUTO AGGRO, all weapon systems need to have a target locked first in order to directly deal damage to it, except drones.
---
This would solve AFK ratting pretty easily (not botting though, only AFK players)
---
Ccp still working at it?
---
Stop bitching about it. He would've won even without the accounts. Here are the results of the CSM if you don't include those votes:
---
    Pre-elimination talley:
---
    [('"ExookiZ"', 2730.401149464079),
---
     ('"Innominate"', 2677.08388267459),
---
     ('"Sort Dragon"', 2329.017758371614),
---
     ('"Steve Ronuken"', 2308.7161906878937)]
---
    Round over, "Steve Ronuken" eliminated, 7 elected, 10 remain
---
    ---------------------------------
---
    Your council:
---
    "Sort Dragon"
---
    "ExookiZ"
---
    "Vily"
---
    "Olmeca Gold"
---
    "Innominate"
---
    "Gobbins"
---
    "Dunk Dinkle"
---
    "Merkelchen"
---
    "Killah Bee"
---
    "Aryth"
---
You're boy Olmeca saved Steve from being beaten by Sort.
---
Wait, is this real?
---
OLMECA POG
---
Both are 50% reduced optimal range.
---
That's a nice QOL item
---
More dread spawns in delve please.
---
It has 3 bonuses just like the Osprey Navy Issue does?
---
Who's bitching?  I think Olmeca is a great choice and knows the game better than the majority of players, even if I don't care for his personality.
---
Doesn't mean I can't make a joke about it.
---
I mean I voted for him first choice with like 10 accounts
---
Yes
---
Oh rip my 3 ACL ratting alt. 
---
Wts skill injectors.
---
I hope you report all the bots  you see before killing them.  Good work btw!
---
Source please
---
Yeah kinda like that, but ive meant mechanically demanding thing (which eve is not full of tbh).
---
Hail and PP are the same range (-50%), but more dps - I think.
---
So do EMP and Fusion, but Hail also has decreased falloff.
---
This isn't really exceptional in any way lol
---
&gt;You really believe that, don't you.
---
Have the largest organized bloc, and king of the mountain, organize a ballot-box-stuffing-campaign, and you'll steal an election.  Negotiate seats, but keep the largest share, and you'll cement your grip while ensuring a unified agenda.
---
That -50% also applies to Fusion and EMP, but Hail also has worst Falloff (and tracking). And yes, a lot of dps.
---
you forgot "work in progress" and"prototype"
---
gotta put together a slide at the last minute to give the illusion that your company knows what its doing in the future.
---
He just needed like 13 more votes to have gotten in this time? And he didn't get in last time did he, he was in the exact situation as now where he was first secondary and got in as one of the elected CSMs got booted out by CCP.

Row #26 is my ballot with 80 (+4 other people) votes.
---
Row #13 is Mar5hy with 171 votes.

If I had to guess who those single votes are:
---
1) IH/WH/WH affiliated Russians. They cast single Tifida vote last year. They don't care. They like me and believe in me.

2) The Chinese from The Army of the Mango. Lord Maldoror/RNK told them to vote my way because they were impressed with the video. They have nobody else to vote for.
---
3) Bitter vets who didn't vote before, and decided to cast a single vote because someone is saying something new.
---
4) New players who don't know that they can cast many votes per account. They were driven mainly from my reddit video post/youtube.
---
PS: I didn't pay anyone for votes too. I know some other candidates who did and added me to the ballots as well. And when you pay you actually give the account owners a distinguishing ballot list, to prove they actually voted as paid. So paying for single "Olmeca Gold" votes wouldnt be smart.
---
PS2: I received 2000+ votes from ballots that were cast 10 times or less. Are those ones my alts/purchases too?
---
That was pretty far from an actual fight.
---
are you not allowed to be negative to ccp now that ur on the csm?
---
???
---
Probably gilas as well
---
Then falloff isn't taken into account. Ordered by optimal range first then alphabetically.
---
Bookmark Expiry sounds like insane cancer tbh
---
It won't be easier to catch than an overprop vni, which is what most people used
---
Could be, I missed the alphabetical part, good catch.
---
we've been told forever that the null candidates all care about the rest of the game even though they only play in sov null. there is not reason that someone that focuses on primarily one playstyle (whaling) cant have valuable input in other areas of the game.
---
50 to 70% of vni s ratting in null are bots...pve suck balls,is time for ccp to remove anoms and introduce something new like escalations where ppl need to move system in order to achieve isk...otherwise eve is dead in 3,,,2 1 kaboom
---
i win reddit this round
---
Depends on how its implemented. If it is at the folder level it could be really powerful. Off the top of my head:
---
Wormholes - Expire after 48 hours
---
Temp Tactical - Expire after 7 days
---
well, I guess if I was smart i'd be on my way to jita to buy all the myrms
---
i'm hoping the drone army starts to use Gilas. Invest now boys
---
Gila is a much better catch than a VNI.
---
Whiny little bitches are gonna complain that a sandbox game is being played wrong.... Go figure
---
I find this hard to believe that this is real. would this not be on the Eve website...oh hold it everything on the internet is true. like Eve has sound.
---
Until CCP lists something that is official on their Website I have to say this bullox
---
this is freaking amazing!
---
More like 5, O' my Kestrel Lord
---
Eve north presentation that was just on CCP's twitch stream, where the screenshot linked in the OP is from. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/442644023 is the video, you can find the timestamp yourself.
---
True dat. Need that prime fountain real estate.
---
Ah well that sounds pretty good actually, thought they were about to add expiry to every bookmark
---
For the record, olmeca is row 26 and marshy is row 13
---
Presumably it's optional.
---
Old player retention: "Hold my Quafe"
---
This came directly from CCP at Eve North, they streamed it on Twitch.
---
What on earth is that VNI buff??
---
It has just been nerfed because it was dumb as fuck and it’s still one of the most popular ships in the game. 
---
Nah let’s just massively buff it up.
---
Can’t blame the guy after the character assassination /u/ccp trid to pull.
---
I'm already good friends with VNI's older and cooler sister Ishtar, I'm gonna hang out with her from now on.
---
Being on the Imperium ballot doesn't mean much besides a public endorsement past the 3rd choice.
---
You can see the Imperium Ballot here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZaYQJDgVTg7UG5Xh9DAezsc22AZ8s8Zdgm0L8oJZ8U/edit#gid=0
---
As you can see, the Judge was rank 4 on their ballot, Sort was ranked 7 yet they didn't make it, while Steve was ranked 9 and he did. So he didn't benefit from being on the Imperium ballot directly.
---
Also in case you don't know how the STV system works for voting, check out [this video from CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI).
---
And one more thing, Steve only had a 11 votes lead over Sort Dragon, his position on this CSM definitely was not expected. I placed him as my number 1 spot on my two accounts (i'm a lowsec pleb) and definitely did not expected him to ge through.
---
It is was ont he ccp twitch stream from there meet in canada...
---
Local delay.
---
Did domi get buffed?
---
Oh no I'm pretty pissed about this "mooring" thing.
---
You must have missed the -50 drone bandwidth.
---
Looks like we'll get a new wormhole model that doesn't look like ass on low shader settings, i like it.
---
Big improvement.
---
If init gets dunked or loses a fight, they're part of goons. If they do the dunking or have some great victory, they're independent of goons
---
🤷‍♂️
---
It a different perspective from others in the meta. Let’s see what happens.
---
It would be an optional thing when you create the bm yeah
---
No, but how can you not like the majestic space potato?
---
At some point after continual drone nerfs smart bomb AFK ratting becomes better.
---
Not nearly enough disclaimers, I'll add more next time ;)
---
I didn’t see that on the slide. Fair play.
---
Well, my top 3, Gobbins, Olmecca, and Exookiz (I know I spelled that wrong but I’m on mobile) all won, so I am happy.
---
90% of new players leave after a week and only 1.12% stay longer than three months (!)  
---
That's a scandal.
---
i greatly prefer flagellating my eyes with highly pixelated images, thank you

---
What other QOL changes are they making? Is there a list?
---
That's assuming that they are 100mn, I see 10mn VNIs quite commonly too. Also Dominixes and Myrmidons in general are much easier to catch when travelling, you're more likely to catch them when they come out of warp/catch them initiating warp due to much slower warp speeds, if botters swap to myrms/dominixes more of their shit is going to die in login trap bubbles since spending more time in warp means more chance that one is in warp when your sabre alt logins and drops bubble.   
---
Also worth mentioning that Vexor Navy Issues are much harder targets for the majority of cloaky camping ships, you can solo kill myrmidon/dominix ratters in stealth bombers which afterburning VNIs are completely immune from. 
---
In general much better for roamers and bot hunters. Also I think local producers will like the fact that people will be buying their minerals in the form of produced dominixes locally instead of loading up a JF with 36 VNIs. (You can only carry 7 Dominixes in a JF) so not efficient.
---
wait that means i dont have to have a print out on my wall of crystal ranges?
---
Welcome to Eve. Do you have a habit of giving your enemies fair fights?
---
You seem upset friendo.
---
This is amazing
---
It's almost like if he hadn't kicked out SLYCE under fake/outrageous pretenses he probably would have gotten it.
---
Well, current plan is that there will be radio-button selection in the window to create a bookmark with a few options (like: "Never", "In 2 days", "In 3 hours") - so if you want you can keep them all on "Never". The selection will be remembered, but you need to be a bit careful, if you switch between options and then need to create a bookmark very fast (but in the current prototype you can cancel the expiry afterwards, if really needed).
---
You've successfully simulated what Internet looks like on 2005
---
GJ, for real
---
Depends what you mean by "AFK"  
---
Watching Netflix/Shooting Shit or whatever but paying attention to local and intel channel, Get an Ishtar or Gila.   
---
Not paying attention all the time and expect to lose the odd one here and there. Insured Myrm and Dominix.
---
I'm both irritated and ok with this change, I use my VNI to run DED/Unrateds in highsec mainly and it's 10mn active armor. I'll need to stop slacking off on training my hybrid skills but looking stats I'll get more or less the same DPS with 3 heavies and 3 blasters as I do now with 5 heavies. Plus my tank will be improved.
---
Anything past spot 3 is not effective. Outsider candidates need the 1 spot.
---
[What I do when I have to pick ammo.](https://i.imgur.com/DfqLC5K.jpg)
---
Dont ruin the narrative.
---
MAKE IT SO I CAN CHANGE LASER AMMO TYPE WITHOUT TURNING THE GUN ON OR OFF.
---
Yeah the VNI will be very good for solo/small gang PVP and for solo PVE with the new tank bonus. It just isn't 5 inputs every 40 minutes like it is with running havens right now.
---
I'm sure there will be a post with slides when the key notes are over.
---
This is legitimately a great feature and I hope it makes it to production status. As a J spacer in particular it would be incredibly useful.
---
Shared bookmarks? What kind of sorceery is this?
---
These are amazing changes. I hope they continue down this route
---
Good to know. If you spent as much time defending your structures as you have trying to defend Olmeca from a shitpost, this war would be going a lot differently.
---
How's first class?
---
That time is better spent on implementing those changes ;)
---
Auto targeting missiles exist.
---
Yeah I never use it that way lol, definitely seems like it might get better at blitzing DED cause the light drones + tracking bonused blasters should clear faster.
---
There's obviously other issues in play here - you shouldn't be able to AFK *anything* and make ISK - but even so, that's a big step forward for hunting, it's much easier to catch a BC than an overprop cruiser.
---
And none of these bots voted for Sort.
---
Did they miss the fucking memo.
---
Boarding a fancy plane in Amsterdam right now, mate. Keep squatting, you'll get there some day.
---
I know, but Merk was my number Juan.
---
Damage and resistances for NPCs in their showinfo windows for one :)
---
Would be really cool if this were applied to Folders instead of individual Bookmarks.
---
That’s incredible. Thank you!
---
Have the rats prioritise them, particularly if they're not damaging the player's ship or they're out of range.
---
Ever heard of mining?
---
I don't even have a problem with this, if its a serious slog into some of the shit we need fixed.
---
It kinda feels like they slapped lipstick on a pig.
---
Mediocre posting is my main goal in life.
---
I understand how the voting works. :)
---
I also know who was on the ballot. :)
---
I'm pretty sure you don't want me touching the codebase mate ;)
---
If you're going to do market speculation it would probably be better to buy Gilas, Myrmidons and Domis are T1 ships so are easy and fast to produce, and many alliances will produce them locally because Domis are awful and inefficient to haul in JFs since they are 50,000m3 each compared to VNIs being 5x more space efficient at 10,000m3 each to move.
---
We need a “reload ammo after this cycle and then automatically start next cycle”
---
I wasn't fast enough =/
---
And Steve is still there, I reckon EVE is safe.
---
Olmeca has only ever ran from me while calling me risk averse in local.
---
It's also work and apart from a few use cases, I don't know why anyone would do it.
---
dumb question, not 100% sure on mechanics, so if Matterall wasn't there, Sort would have gotten in?
---
Quality shitpost, Xenuria should have posted it here to farm the karma himself.
---
We can barely get people to choose the right folder. Adding a new option to each bookmark will make it pointless. It would be way more useful set by the admin at the folder level.
---
Did vni get nerfed?
---
No, you literally said you didn't understand. If you don't understand you should ask, not posit a conclusion.
---
It all meta gaming
---
Is that what the domi used to look like?
---
Option 2, for the lulz, please.
---
Nice little QOL upgrade
---
Who is steve, he's the only on there i don't recognize
---
A lot of people from bombers bar probably voted for you too.
---
Damn and I was going to go Omega next week to train into a VNI for ratting.
---
Guess maybe I'll go Gila now instead?!
---
For ratting, very much so. It will no longer be able to run 5 bonused heavies, which was what made it so strong in the first place.
---

About myrm level afk dps
---
?? He didnt leave.
---
[That on the later slide deck](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c3t11a/eve_online_development_variety_hour_slides/)
---
The good thing about smartbomb ratting though is that it's much harder to bot since you get a 60s weapons timer when smartbombing and you give your alts 15 min timers too. Once CCP removes control towers it will be dangerous to smartbomb rat while just aligned to a citadel.
---
There are lots of entities like that but I just listed those most likely to cast vote with me being the sole candidate on it.
---
Yeah, sounds about right. At least there will be some variation I guess?
---
No amount of disclaimers would stop this hype train.
---
I mean as this post clearly demonstrated, starving creatures don't need any condiment to scoff down the meal they're having.
---
You can of course season to taste, as you are doing, lmao.
---
You need decent piloting and a fairly high end gila fit for most of the C3 sites, they do about 600 DPS.
---
Sleeper relic sites can be worth it. Sleeper data sites are definitely not.
---
yes because anyone besides the 5 ppl that can be bothered actually hunt VNI bots. It is 0 reward and a insured myrm is cheaper to loose than a VNI. And this is ignoring that a myrm is way easier to tank and can just fit hyper rigs. Sorry, but this change is typical CCP retardation
---
Wasn't this a thing early on?   I'm coming off a near decade hiatus...and I could've sworn people traded bookmarks for low and null sec.
---
4 of those are mine because i had to dig for days to understand this voting system and i wanted in the end you and Stitch Kaneland to enter this CSM.
---
Pls work with him even though he didn't enter, he has some interesting ideas.
---
We've been asking for this in wingspan for years.
---
No
---
Yes, please make it harder for others to build capitals while goons already have 37749593.
---
&gt;REMOVE DRONE AUTO AGGRO
---
Why not give them the missile nerf treatment to relegate them to dumpster tier weapons system and be done with it /s
---
A low-skill domi dies to sites tho.
---
Thank you for this text post.  The image you put up is god-awful.
---
This seems like an interesting request and it would probably be quite easy to change to this approach.
---
Is there anybody reading here, who would prefer to select it per bookmark?
---
Btw: The current plan is that you will be able to have a few folders active at the same time - but it will be for sure limited (like for example 3 shared folders and then another few personal folders, to which only you have access).
---
At least they're doing something. Everyone on r/eve spergs about no changes being made but then shits on CCP whenever they try to change something without having a magic silver bullet. This will change the meta and this is a good thing for the game.   
---
People who hunt bots never did it for the ISK anyway. Myrms/Dominixes are much harder to move due to taking up much more JF space, harder to locally produce since they require much more materials, and building Domis/Myrms require BPOs if you want to mass produce efficiently instead of just a VNI BPC from the market, and take more time to produce. Yes, they can just buy Domi/Myrm BPCs too, but all together this makes it harder logistically for botters and renters, and also casts a wider net on who is complicit with their botting when it comes to using materials, production infrastructure and the blueprints used to build the ships.
---
EVE University did the heavy lifting on the first 2 timers, supported by INIT. 
---
PIRAT lifted their wardec on the Uni  early to prevent them from engaging the final timer. We just finished the job.
---
Go Ivy.
---
No worries, I need you anyway to test those changes :)
---
Yeah but they are garbage tier
---
&gt; Boom. Solved.
---
Ah, yes. The classic "I'm absolutely clueless about the possible difficulties involved, or the problems this could create, but I'm just going to present it as easy and an ideal fix"
---
Stitch... PepeHands. 
---
HE WAS THE CHOSEN ONE!
---
I’d like to be able to select it per book mark as well. I spend a significant amount of time scanning and being able to set it to be pruned at the EOL/16/24H mark would be sick

"I find this hard to believe ... I have to say this bullox" - /u/MAD_Lothren
---
Theres standards for this stuff, specifically in this case:
---
tracking is a standalone bonus
---
damage is a standalone bonus
---
drone bonuses comes in 2s (tracking+damage, speed+damage, etc)
---
Faction Ships have 2 bonuses.
---
This new vexor breaks a lot of conventions. 
---
- rep bonus (counts as 1)
---
- 1 bonus for both tracking bonus / weapon damage bonus: I don't think there's a single other ship that has a tracking and damage in one bonus, see BNI who has both in 2 separate bonuses , see also megathron or mega navy. Tracking and damage are both very much individual bonuses, and both at are 10 percent, which is on the high-end (the highest as far as per level bonuses go in this category). This is technically 2 buffs rolled into 1 bonus.
---
- 1 triple drone bonus: Not only is this a third bonus it shouldn't have, but this is also a triple drone bonus (hitpoints, damage, tracking) compared to the usual 2. Drone bonuses usually go in 2s, see domi, ishtar, myrm, sin and pretty much any drone boat. This is pretty much 1.5 bonuses. 
---
So yeah 4.5 compared to 2. 
---
If you wanna mention the ONI, it has a garbage extra damage bonus so thats its not totally fucked on kin-locking, its not really a real bonus and is just bandage. Either way, its not a real third bonus, not is 3 bonuses the standard anyway. 
---
Having said that, I'm not convinced this is that bad, but it is a ridic amount of bonuses. I'm guessing it has something to do with the hybrid drone/gun ship they are going for here, so both sides have to be really good so one isn't ignored. Usually these things are useless or op but we'll see (save the navy domi ccp).
---
I think the wormhole groups probably use bookmarks the most (and have the most complex schemes). You should have Exooki work with his constituents to see what they think would be best.
---
Time for them to switch to gilas
---
It's called a laser with t1 crystals
---
You might as well use a Stratios, which is what I do. The ship is just great for hisec combat explo.
---
Needs some audio fade at the end there bro. Otherwise, have an upDoot.
---
This. I like this.
---
Don't you think about the poor people who have nothing else to put in their bio?  
---
(Jokes aside, awesome changes)
---
This is the type of thing we should be seeing every 6 months at least CCP
---
Better late than never I guess.
---
I'm sad that Stitch didnt get in. Hes more of small gang which is what i hoped could flourish along with a revamped FW
---
Steve Ronuken, Fuzzwork Enterprises. Hisec industrial guy. Runs [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/), a popular and useful industry calculator and database lookup website. Allegedly an independent candidate for like 6 years at this point, he just sits around and does industry math. Tbh I don't know a lot about what he really does either or if he is actually with some group, but dude runs a really really useful website and he hasn't done anything too monumentally stupid to get people to hate him.
---
That's the point, it will cause people to start trying to diversify their ratting ships.
---
Sorry your picture is wrong. That domi should be a gila.
---
Ishtars are still a bit pricier and harder to get into, so I'm fine with that. Myrms are nowhere near as efficient. Domis are easier to catch. Either way you look at it, it's good.
---
His arrogance about the act might have done him in, he is positively glowing with it on the eve-o forums.
---
for all the years I played this game I always wondered why this wasn't there the whole time. Its seems so basic to have that info in the window instead of expecting the pilot to either memorize all the names, ranges and ammo types, or write them all down.
---
I know right? I only spent close to 10 years playing the game and spent part of my career as a games designer. I know nothinggggg.
---
One limitation would be for sure that we don't want to complicate the UI too much, so we should not add way too many options for how long the bookmark expiry will be. How would you approach this? Is an option to expire after 48 hours sufficient for WH bookmarks?
---

---
[Target Priority Rat A]
---
doesnt represent a significant obstruction to botters. Idk if it would significantly decrease QOL for actual players (pure ignorance because I havent played the game really). But if it would be bad for non-player QOL, I would instead be looking at more like overhaul-tier solutions. 
---
For example, turning that simple [priority decider] into something that requires critical thinking, either through complicated enemy wave compositions or new mechanics that disrupt decision-making in a significant way (ECM and shit does this). But that's way harder ofc.
---
Ima be negative nancy again and say that opening up avenues to passively make ISK off of botters isnt gonna help anyone long term, infact, as we can see by the whole renter /botter situation: If theres ISK to be made and a blind eye to be turned, then ppl are gonna do it
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the /r/eve crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
Please for the love of bob allow ESI to interface with these to add/remove people from bookmark groups, delete bookmarks, and manage the bookmark folder.
---
Good idea!
---
Why? That was the original plan before tethering.
---
When does this take effect?
---
Hunter hunts in region with many krabs, surprising literally nobody.
---
Navy ships are supposed to be for skilled pilots, so I'm definitely happy with this change. Ship is actually improved, but flying like a doofus gimps it as it should.
---
Unfortunately this will pretty sure be outside of the scope of this project, but we will try to keep it in mind and structure things in a way so that it will be easy to add later.
---
Sometimes
---
didn't gila's just get the nerf bat a patch ago though?
---
More interesting to kill than VNIs
---
If CCP was smart enough to catch past CSM members for RMT and other offenses I have every confidence they can crack down on CSM members coming from brand new alliances, they can even put a 1st year restriction in-place.  
---
They don't vote but if 90% of the council annoys the shit out of CCP about the issue I'd bet it would get fixed.  Make them hold special fuel for the cloak so that 100s of logged cloaked hours per toon is not possible without docking to resupply.
---
If it's to replace tether, I understand, but having both is just too much safety.
---
He’s big into EVE’s APIs. I like having him on the CSM to represent the technical side of EVE that can’t do what it does without API support. ESI, SSO, etc.

I suppose I should add the source: [Eve North presentation](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/442644023?t=03h51m20s). Link is timestamped to the beginning of the discussion, the slide in the OP is from about [3:57:25](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/442644023?t=03h57m25s).
---
Speaking from the perspective of a wormholer in charge of managing Corp bookmarks having it per folder makes more sense, we have a wormhole folder (24-48hrs) OP folders (1-8hrs) 
---
Managing each bookmark just sounds like its overcomplicating things
---
Why not do both, and have the individual bookmark setting override the Folder setting?
---
For example:
---
TEMP SAFE (folder) - expires a bookmark after it's 24 hours old
---
|
---
-------&gt; Bookmark1 - no expiry option selected
---
-------&gt; Bookmark2 - set to expire in 3 days
---
Folder setting deletes a bookmark if it is {x} hours old, and has no expiry, else bookmark will always delete itself at it's expiry time.
---
Also, I have the ease of preselected times on a radio button, but could you consider also giving us the option of setting our own timeframe? Maybe let us set # of days and # of hours (for better usability), or just # of hours to keep it simple?
---
Sorry sweetie but honour brawl organized fights against brave don't qualify as fighting a war under modern day POS mod mechanics.
---
Exooki and Stitch wouldnof been great for small gang/scale PvP. Olmeca I dont believe in.
---
I might resub just because of this change.
---
I wish you would just tell us the plan instead of worry that we will counter it, as if players like this guy have the sense to even check reddit...
---
It will increase the difference between high and low SP players. As if there isn't enough of a gap already.
---
It's slightly more expensive very interesting!
---
Ok
---
&gt; REMOVE DRONE AUTO AGGRO
---
this is literally the only fix possible and needed because, shocker, that's the fucking cause.
---
Can you explain how exactly you make profit by just transporting/hauling goods?
---
Do you just buy stuff on market and look where that item has a buy order for a larger price? This seems like a NO to me :)
---
Dont feed His Dunning Kruger
---
My suggestion would be to keep it on a per-bookmark level, *but* also allow setting a default expiry time on a per-subfolder basis. 
---
Imagine you have your 'wormholes' subfolder, you can right click on it in the places window or whatever and set this folder to have a default expiry time of 48 hours. When you create the bookmark, in the window that pops up you have the dropdown to select which subfolder you want to save it in, and then you have the radio button to select the expiry time. When you pick your 'wormholes' subfolder from the dropdown, it then automatically sets the radio button to the '48 hour' setting. If that's what you want, then you don't need to do anything else, but say you see this wormhole is EoL, so for this particular bookmark you then manually set the radio button to 4 hours instead. This particular bookmark will then expire in 4 hours, but doing that doesn't affect the default setting for the subfolder so the next bookmark you create pops up with the wormholes subfolder selected and the radio button already set to 48 hours again. And if this next bookmark you want to create is, say, a gate tac rather than a wormhole, then you pick your 'tacs' subfolder and the radio button automatically flips to the 'never' expiry that you set as default for *that* subfolder. 
---
This seems like the best of both worlds to me - you still can have granular control on a per-bookmark basis of exactly how long you want it to last, but in the cases where you don't *need* that level of control you have the convenience of subfolder-level default durations that you don't need to mess with.
---

the point is that the other guy lost it, not that he made it.
---
All ships are afk ships for bots.
---
PogU
---
That would make the obnoxious bot spam so much more detectable. The bots go under the radar so much because their activity is practically indistinguishable from a human player.
---
Heil hybrids!
---
I guess you could call it that
---
Imagine being this emotionally invested in hating a group of people in a video game.
---
I can agree there.
---
Dawwww, thanks mom!
---
AFK ratting is not the problem, AFK ratting people provide content and they are real players paying subscription, sitting in front of a Eve client for a certain amount of time, not 24/7 like bots.
---
This people are not causing the general isk inflation, bots and supers are.
---
Should be more useful place acceleration gates to prevent capitals and supers and titan from doing combat sites.

halving drone EHP when your drones get shot at is a nerf in the same way that telling me you're going to charge me twice as much for unleaded fuel when i drive a diesel car.
---
They are expensive and by killing bots ccp would also cut  active account numbers and affect plex prices. Also captchas on undock are not "good enough" as long as POS and Tether are in the game.
---
Guess we now know why CCP put so much effort into revamping the agency ;)

I have fond memories of repeatedly playing wormhole games to catch gila bots. They tend to use faction DDAs more :D

just out of curiosity, what is the size of this "small gang" that has enough dps and tackle already to justify bringing "some logi"?
---
OHFUCKYES FINALLY I DONT HAVE TO SIMULATE OR LOAD AMMOS TO SEE WHAT DAMAGE THEY DO AGAIN
---
This is more cringe than the op
---
Then you obviously don't know the stance of the now previous group.
---
And again, you don't seem to understand how the CSM works. MANY dumb ideas have been railed against by the CSM and yet they make it in to the game.
---
Parking supers on astras with 100 safety does seem a bit too much.
---
Perhaps
---
Why would it be? Tether was always meant to replace POS shields and you cant be forced out if POS by any means. Also if I understand it correctly, you are actuslly in space logged off when mooring?
---
Cant have folks rising above their station right?! /s
---
eve has truly been spared
---
It deters simple bots. Persistent bots that develop counters to attempts to stop them it doesn't stop. 
---
&gt;one very painless way
---
You have proposed a change that will only cause pain to real human players and pose no real challenge to bots. Real captchas pose a challenge to bots at least but your proposed ones would only bother real players and offer 0 challenge to bots.
---
October sticks out in my mind for the next big changes patch but I’m not certain on that.
---
I'll be honest, i'm simulating a domi right now.
---
it's not looking particularly promising, if i'm honest.

I tried afk domi before but couldnt succeed, can someone share a fit.. Semi afk, watiching movie, reading a book...

we're not trying to deal with bots bots - we're just removing the afk component of ratting.
---
if you want to counter bots, just fucking ban them rather than fucking around with ship stats.
---
&gt; Somebody needs to advocate for small-scale PVP.
---
Now we just have to wait for CCP to completely ignore them.
---
Killah Bee goon spy confirmed?
---
VNIs. Not talking about escalations. Talking about Sanctums/Havens.
---
A lot of names that I miss very much.
---
Aren't these figures post agency change? Like it says 3 weeks in the title... I assumed that meant 3 weeks after Invasion released.
---
No it won't.
---
I can fly a super perfectly and own one beautifully fit for ratting. I would rather circle rocks in a VNI. The AFK income is real and I don't mind the shitty ticks.
---
If I wanted to, I could scale this up and be AFK on 10 accounts in VNIs and make the same money as I could in my super.
---
You'll notice CCP making changes to scalability which is exactly what this game needs right now.
---
My VNI was already active armor fit so I'll just need to fix my blaster skills and I'm good. Never AFK'd in the first place.
---
"So, like, I had my ship full of ore that I knew would be selling for a lot because of the invasions going on and everyone needs ships and gear and junk. But no one on my corp could really help me out so I had to haul it alone in what's basically just a big space semi truck..."
---
"Sir this is a Wendy's."
---
Seems like this goon crab might be afraid of people voicing there opinions and getting his play style nerfed.
---
I don't think anyone can fight Goons 1v1 when they'll drop 20 Titans on frigates
---
If you actively do anoms there are far better ships than the VNI.
---
So you just force a crewmember to reach into the breech of a starships weapon, while it's firing, and swap out the ammo really really fast?
---
Generally around 10
---
I run DED/Unrateds in highsec currently so it was VNI or Gila.
---
Cool, none of the people that were in my top 3 won and the CSM is full of Goons.
---
With the change to ecm it makes perfect sense to remove the aggressive option. Bots can still get around it by spamming the shortcut, but human afk ratting would be gone.
---
Of course. This is exactly how that works right, or have I been doing it wrong all this time?!
---
thank god.... CCPls expedite this!
---
It isnt about loot, its about the story...  comet killing a battleship...
---
because you are now literally invulnerable while tethering?
---
"Crewmembers" are expendable
---
It used to be brown and actually look like a potato http://i.online-torg.club/site_upload/Games/EVE/3934b2e3af4f0e6cd7e36607dc5ec64a.jpg
---
Gating sites means you will never ever tackle anyone inside it due to the unfortunate way gates work. Just look at DED complexes. Only completely braindead numpties get tackled inside them.
---
Ratting supers wouldn´t be that big of a deal if they were actually kill able. How many people ratted in supers years back, when cap fleets could move from one end of the map to the other one in the blink of an eye? 
---
I am not advocating for the reversal of all the jump changes as that was the other extreme of the spectrum, but a nice start would be actually making it possible to kill off-guard supers under an umbrella if the tackling group is competent enough and have their shit ready.
---
Fixing mobile cyno inhibs and actually making them useful would be a good first step.   
---
They absolutely need to online instantly, otherwise they can´t perform their intended function.
---
Their HP pools should be reworked so they should have proper resistances, so they can be repped by logi. (to a certain extent)
---
Their disruption range needs to be more than 100km, something like 200km sounds pretty reasonable, so that there is no way to drop more unkillable FAX within rep range of whatever is tackled. This would further provide a tool for the attacker to bubble the FAXes, hampering their movement. It would also mean that the defender needs to bring some subcaps, such as booshers, if they want to clear the bubbles off. Unfortunately NSA carriers can instalock and point/web at practically infinite ranges (which is absolutely retarded but that is another topic), so I guess those would work as well.
---
This way a competent attacker could try to stall the flood of hostile caps long enough to maybe kill the super (or any cap that doesn´t belong to some shitty renter group really), given they have enough DPS on field.
---
Capitals absolutely shouldn´t be able to blap subcaps without their own subcap support (I can see an exception for HAW dreads since they trade raw dps for application). NSA carriers and supers are just the literal cancer.
---
And by the time you´re done you can grab your reship and apply those ranges.
---
I'm surprised it's not owned, that bash.org shit I was quoting is old af.
---
Domis
---
That shit also makes stabbed botting possible without any big compromise in ticks, as drones dont care about any of the drawbacks of the stab.
---
But good luck getting anything done about it with 7/10 CMS being members of rental botting empires. 
---
Maybe some time down the road, once all the PvP willing people have biomassed, they will realize they might have all the ISK in the world, but actually have nothing to spend it on except more ratting ships.
---
"I don't need to worry about warping directly from gate to gate in nullsec in my stratios, I have a cloak!"

I would assume Xenuria going self-aware to be a sure sign that the apocalypse is just around the corner.
---
or the gila, can still use it as an alpha
---
hehe baited on flair xd meme
---
also you missed the point of the point massively.
---
Or you just mount your crystals to a rotating selector and rotate the selector between shots.
---
Lasers in EVE also don't fire continuously (*grumblegrumblegrumble*) so it's likely you can change focusing crystals between shots while the weapon's capacitors are charging.
---
When your brain is so slow you can't react quick enough outside TIDI.

You should be, but there should be more limits on tethering such as no tethering/mooring while low power.

If you go to the landing page you'll see a screenshot with a few extra UI elements on it. Including a indicator for an asteroid. Next test is aimed at spodbrains confirmed, to get maximum numbers.
---
How about we just take the blue pill and you shut the fuck up for a while?
---
Any pvp frigate with 2 damage mods means helva of commitment
---
Also, if a Nergal could survive on field for more than 2 minutes for its weapon to heat up then the receiving end is definitely losing no matter the actual dps
---
Nice finding!
---
If the crew is quick they'll only lose their hands. Get a rotation going, start a line behind each cannon. Have medics regenerate new hands for crew then get them back in line.
---
Keep a few extras in case anyone's sucked into the breach, don't worry, it won't jam if that happens, the hydraulics will handle the problem.
---
The only way to have fun long term in eve is to make friends
---
At least they're now actually releasing player retention data.
---
More transparency is good.
---
Yeah. Player retention needs to be a focus for their development moving forward.
---
just stop
---
Time's a good point, but that 717 number came from a tech 2 gun with 2 damage mods, close range ammo cold. I'm not exactly recommending this for fring-on-frig fights, but for bigger fights.
---
You can bump a ship out of tether, the upwell structures have a docking feature if you want to be safe.
---
It's been a focus for years, there just isn't really a great solution without ruining what makes eve eve
---
Yeah, but there are ways to improve player retention without compromising what makes EVE EVE. One simple way could be increasing the base SP of new player accounts, or providing double training speed for the first 30 days. The tutorial could also get improved upon, and more PvE story content could be released which would also benefit the frankly atrocious PvE content we have. All these things help new players get eased into the game instead of throwing a confusing mess in their face and forcing them to adapt or die.
---
The default overview is also in desperate need of an overhaul.
---
I mean, it kind of looks like an asshole to be fair.
---
Do the bots avoid anchored bubbles?
---
Then call them sanctums and havens, 10/10 almost always refers to the DED sites
---
I haven't actively played in so long, I have no idea what the metas are, whats good, whats not. I was thinking of playing some today, I have no idea what good my ships are.

When you run a loot script with UK pings ofc you're gonna get it.

Got killed by a plexing bot in a slicer the other day. It was an autoloss matchup, but I knew it was a bot account so I figured I'd boot him out of the plex. Bot orbited me at 18 and swapped to keep at range when I went for the slingshot. Very simple script, but enough to win an autowin plex fight.

---
Thank you for having a sense of hunor
---
Olmeca's gameplay consists of right-click 'jump' or right-click 'warp squad' - his scope of the game is very limited regardless of what videos or long-winded posts come from him. He has spent the last 2 years jumping from 3 different stations in the game, using 5 different ships. His 'working with others' only consists of getting people to hunt for him in Delve, then jumping a dread to a cyno.
---
What "c*hanges*" are you expecting from him with such a small scope and knowledge of the game?
---
Congratulations to him for being elected though, he proved me wrong on something and I accept being mistaken.
---
Yes sure oh great master mind of everything
---
Yes, and when we cater to these players the game gets watered down. These are also the type of players that might play for a few months but then quit once the next shiny game comes along. So trying to retain new players that have that mentally is counter productive. They quit not long after starting and some of your core player base quits due to the bad changes.
---
Iirc he said it was week 3 of this year.

Hello Mr Salut Mine

Thank you for this post ( ╹▽╹ )

https://paste.pleaseignore.com/index.php?id=QMJSaVMXXxRcCmh4 change the resist rigs/mods as required. This got linked 4-6 weeks ago iirc.

I can positively state, without any doubt or equivocation, that the answer is; maybe?
---
Aryth and 90% of the other goons don't even login lmao
---
I've never found structures like that before.  Was just a trip to find two at once lol.
---
I actually like this idea. At least no mooring if its low power. Or while tethered you dont get repaired and cap recharge.
---
Slave consumption is counterbalanced by low ammo consumption, stop whining.
---
They should lock this guy and jay maricade in a room for science just to see what would happen.
---
Bots are where you jump to? Not sp farmers?
---
finaly yes ! ... now pls do also alliance hangars even if just one or two
---
4 goon representatives on the board and you want to ensure another member can set aside bias.
---
Goon logic 101.
---
Any source/link for the mooring?
---
There's a few solutions. One that's been talked about here is just improving the tutorial and the default overview.
---
You just made an enemy for life
---
Wish i had your luck. Nice finds mate.
---
Three. And they've already worked extremely well with CCP and other CSM members in the past. Hopefully the new ones have improving the game in mind vs. just the in game bias we all have.

I like it, make solo stealth bombers great again.

It would certainly make me reconsider my church attendance.
---
I want to try living in a wormhole in an orca, but the hangar thing is kind of confusing so i have a few questions.
---
Whats is the difference between the Fleet Hangar and the Ship Maintenance Bay?  
---
Can I have one character piloting the orca and one other character taking ships in and out of it? or is the orca pilot the only one that can reship? 
---
also any tips for orca living is appreciated &lt;3
---
You aren’t u/stainguy
---
Useful tutorials, usable default overlays and fun entry level pve would help a lot and not change anything about the game as a whole.
---
&gt;so to the next r/eve simpleton starting an idea/suggestion thread, 1.your not some genius who has found the cure for eve 2.your idea will not be implemented into the game 3. stop being thirsty for karma

i am voicing my frustrations at terrible/copy pasted suggestions that wont get implemented that are spammed by people wanting karma

May as well just remove all drones skills (and fof missiles) from Alphas.

If you're not going to change the shitty gameplay that allows players to easily write bots, the least you can do is take away AFK weapons.

Do you think those images could be combined into 1 showing how much each damage type is by %? like merge the symbols in someway.

---
Not that I'm blaming the tragic state of safety in EVE on the CSM, but we're all in a very bad place. Potentially because of the influence of previous CSM boards on pandering to safety and feel good fluffy play.
---
You want the game to be improved, like most everyone else? Ensure every power block in every aspect of the game has a maximum of one representative on the board at a time.
---
There are none left.
---
Test is going to collectively win eve? I will miss them.
---
You were third ballor in PH voting list as well.
---
'Eh, there's still a huge percentage of Eve that is upset at The Judge. I mean, he was a traitor, sure, but he thought too highly of himself afterwards.
---
I'd rather see people voicing up over things that are wrong with the game even if they aren't the most original idea. More voices means that there is a higher chance that CCP will start looking at these problems.
---
Glad you made it!
---
Earlier today goons brought 2x to the fight. Maybe this is the issue...
---
If we could just get some game mechanics to make eve... Dangerous again.
---
oof all the hard work down the drain
---
It’s not bad, I rat with a domi assisting an Ishtar with a noxtis alt salvaging and cleat 120m/hour easy
---
these people are just riding the 'skillu disbanded' bandwagon and dont actually care in improving the game, its just karma whoring. Like if you wanted an actual discussion you would do it outside of reddit.
---
Goons, NC/PL, and Legacy.
---
&gt; One simple way could be increasing the base SP of new player accounts
---
One thing that really makes no sense to me is that they did do this... but only if you already know enough about EVE to know to use a Recruit a Friend code. You get 750,000 free unallocated SP. Which would be amazing to just give to new players without locking it behind RAF. As is, it's more a bonus for alts than new players...
---
Holy shit yes
---
Is this in sisi or did you make this mockup
---
Nothing little about this
---
For the love of God make them get rid of this shit https://i.imgur.com/nyp8Nf5.png and I'll vote for you next term with all of my both accounts.
---
Now giggling imagining a rainbow-colored six-shooter mounted somewhere inside of my ship
---
Why an armor repper bonus?
---
If the idea is to reduce the viability of AFK ratting why does it get a survivability bonus?
---
Also, now it has mostly the same Drone damage bonuses and stats as the base Vexor. The point of navy ships is to have more DPS and raw HP right? I guess a 15% bonus (and dropping the gun bonus) would have been too much/little?
---
Good luck on your CSM turn
---
Doit
---
How many votes did you buy?
---
How many times did you vote for yourself?
---
The game is where it is now largely because of ccp. You could argue we wanted the things that have become problems (the current state of citadels, rorqs, tz tanking and a general lack of motivation to blow shit up for example) but researching and developing the delivered content and mechanics of these features is what CCP is paid to do. These issues have been tangible for a long time and the games health has suffered because of it. This is why effective csm candidates are so critical. They form relationships with key people when they're in the position over multiple terms and can continue to drive key issues home.
---
I agree about the big bloc representation but the fact is overwhelming opinions and outcries have still gone unanswered on a lot of issues so a change to the CSM structure, while it could improve communication from a wider player base, could still just fall on deaf or incapable ears. Fingers crossed though :/
---
He wont
---
Grats again :)
---
I didn’t vote last year and had no intention of voting this year either, your video and the fact you were on hordes ballet changed my mind, glad you got in ;)
---
Pasting from another comment:
---
Those are our votes. I said 300ish on TIS, and it turned out to be close to 250 due to Mar5hys sub situation.
---
1) IH/WH/WH affiliated Russians. They cast single Tifida vote last year. They don't care. They like me and believe in me. We have flown together many times.
---
4) New players who don't know that they can add many candidates per vote. They were driven mainly from my reddit video post/youtube.
---
AMMO QUEUE????? :0

If you understood how it worked you wouldn't say that.
---
For sure my goon brother from another... you get what I mean :)
---
Dude has some legitimate skill, whether you agree with his Eve worldview or not.  I'd prefer someone with skill and knowledge of game mechanics over some of the "politician" types we've had lately.  Brisc's ban may have been wrong, but it wasn't a bad thing.  Dude didn't know shit.  I prefer my CSM to at least understand how the game works. I'll withhold judgment until Olmeca earns it/ruins it.
---
It's like his success depends 99 percent on his ping.
---
Would it be possible to tracking tank a larger ship with it?
---
Butthurt? He's going to flail and be incompetent and get mad when CCP doesn't immediately implement every suggestion he makes.
---
I'm getting my fucking popcorn bucket ready.
---
I think it would be cool if they actually had optimal/falloff ranges listed here numerically as well
---
Aaaaa
---
How is CCP supposed to "solve" the issue without patching something...?
---
*EA wants to know your location*
---
Tether should be a timed thing, like you can only tether for a few minutes, but then it drops. It's too safe the way it is at the moment.

New player retention is terrible

But nothings wrong with eve it's perfect say all the vets and CCP. Because it's you guys that wont make changes
---
Props mate, fuck the goons up
---
Why not?
---
This is not aimed at bots, it's aimed at afk ratting armies. Not the same.
---
Bots can also use supers, rorqs and other drone boats just as well; it's not something you "fix" with a ship redesign.
---
if you are too shit at looting you shouldnt have one of those anyways... natural selection...

In light of Goonswarm's numerical superiority, will Killah Bee adopt a "Fabian Strategy" by staying home and just posting on reddit?

Then why are you here on Reddit complaining about? If you wanted an actual discussion you would do it outside of Reddit. And yes the skill u disbanding bandwagon is a good wagon to get on. We need to keep momentum going if we want to see change.
---
The drone bandwidth is axed, no more five heavies. Regarding the rep bonus, gallente and minmatar get rep bonuses and caldari and amarr get resist bonuses. That’s just a normal survival hull bonus.

If botters move the alpha-bots to Myrmidons is the time to recall and dock significantly different to make a difference? I know it's longer but do not know the math.

&gt;You should have Exooki work with his constituents to see what they think would be best.

This is the best approach. I was speaking from a wormholer perspective, but Exookiz would be better.
---
Reminds me of flying my Rapid Light Caracal. Fucking 35 second reload.
---
I used to do medium FW sites in it (little extra defence since they have a gate) and the second I saw something on D-scan land on my gate, I had to either know what ammo to use or whether to run.
---
I learned the typical tanks for lots of ships common in FW that way.

you seem to be missing the point

Why would bumping ever have consequences???

Congratulations Olmeca

Nah, clearly the players that log in dozens of accounts to sit in space and do nothing are more valuable than the players that player drives away from playing.

the ui is already complicated, trading important usability for ease of use is a losing bet

I argue for a 1-person-1-vote rule.

But until the rules change I will vote with my 80 accounts.

Until the rules change, I would also buy votes. If I had the money. Unfortunately, all my money is spent on dread and AFK camper accounts and the source is dry with Goons not mining. So I couldn't.

Do you have any suggestions for ships besides vni? Used to run the in a rattlesnake as well

My point is simply that CCP could find out these guys are bots with a single DB query.  They choose not to, probably because they need the subscription money.  Why should we be expected to root out bots in our ranks when CCP will not?
---
What do you mean by the first round? Didn't they announce everyone at once?
---
There is no Imperium narrative my dude, you're the only one talking about it.  You just have a meta-Imperium narrative.
---
That said it owns that you're on the CSM and I love it.  I sincerely hope that it is everything you want it to be.  Despite your bluster I think you genuinely do care about the state of the game, even if I think the way that manifests (in anti-Goon bias and rhetoric etc etc) is misguided.  And I think so long as you don't drink your own koolaid too much you'll be a positive influence on the CSM.
---
And even if that's impossible, your fixation with goons ensures that you'll only really focus on null politics which I think according to you is the only thing we care about so I mean lmao if you ran on "I want to subvert goon influence" while simultaneously ensuring that everything stays focused on us.
---
Anyhow, cheers, I'm excited to see how this goes.

Yes, I know the AB matchups against slicers quite well. Almost all of them are autowin or autolose. The interesting part is that it was a bot.

If the game was fun people wouldnt be driven to seek afk methods :thonk:
---
Outsourcing captchas to captcha solving services is fairly easy, cheap and common. I'm no expert in how they work, but if you send em $10 they'll solve a healthy amount of captchas for you, sent using an API that can fairly easily be integrated into your bot. That's not even considering just leaving your bots always in space, or just having a human handle undocking/docking, as not all bots are 50 account career RMTer farms.

Sound like a wanna psycho.

Congratulations and I hope to see you - and the other non-nullblob members of CSM 14 - be a productive and responsible presence and make sure CCP understands the value of playstyles other than mass fleet empire building to their world.

This is true unfortunately. Unless CCP makes sweeping changes to the game it will continue to bleed active players. players looking for a sci-fi spaceship fix have other options out there that are both easier to pick up and provide more action oriented gameplay then eve has, especially at its early stages.

Ofc rorqual Mining scales linear, noone was talking about alts and skillpoints, you were saying the rorq nerf get better with more rorqs which is just wrong. The rorq nerf is the same and scales with you 20 rorqs, if you Do other thing then Mining then has no relation to the topic at all
---
Which will only happen for a minute, then, once a new meta emerges, everyone will be back to ratting in the same ole thing. 
---
Fast forward a few weeks, and we'll all be calling every new meta ratting ship a bot because they all run away when a neut jumps into the system..............just like every normal person who is ratting and not trying to die.

Krabbing is just a general term for pveing to make money.

This will be for sure discussed further  internally, publicly (like when we do our first test on a public test server) and also with the CSM. We discussed the bookmarks proposal already with the CSM as part of the winter summit, but then we did not really go into details regarding the expiring part (and we had no dedicated wormholer in the CSM).

---
See ya, Judge and Sort! You won't be missed.
---
That meme is old
---
High quality indeed
---
Honestly, the issue isn't drone aggression. It's the idea that you can do these sites solo. CCP should redo the sites so it takes at MINIMUM 3 people to do them, but 5-8 would be ideal. Adjust the payouts to compensate. That drastically raises the effort to make a bot and raises the likelihood of a fight developing between roamers and ratters (because the ratters are already in a fleet with logi). There will still be tons of solo content. DED sites, missions, data and relic sites, mining, etc. Honestly, with old Incursion sites and the new Triglavian sites, small group PvE content is something CCP has already proven to be delivered.
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/AZ1umDqXDNqFMcAK9
---
The only argument you used to be able to make was that auto aggression drones was a decent counter to ECM ships, but since ECM was essentially removed from the game there is 0 reason to keep auto aggression. It only exists to support AFK ratting.
---
I prefer the term vintage.
---
Because CCP. They only care abotu the mass of players so they prefer the players from the blocks anyway.
---
What about the goat

Congratulations !
---
I am not a goon, and I hate the goons. However, I am pretty big on the market aspect of Eve, and I do know, Aryth, whether you like him or not, knows the Eve Macro economy very well.

a rounding error?
---
Why did I hear air horns go off as soon as I looked at that photo.
---
🤔
---
Could only happen to test.
---
since when does mining generate isks ? what patch did add bounties to roids ?
---
Because you can't setup rules to prevent that right?
---
Of course, the sites should be challenging and give decent payouts proportionate to the risk taken and the value of the ship running them. 
---
Rats should point more often, there oughta be quite some element of "randomness" to the sites, etc. But completely overhauling them is too much effort for CCP I guess.
---
EvE´s PvE is fun only if it is challenging and unpredictable. The complete opposite of what it is today.
---
Ccp is about to learn a thing or 2 about semi ark fof middle boats...

&gt; if botters swap to myrms/dominixes more of their shit is going to die in login trap bubbles since spending more time in warp means more chance that one is in warp when your sabre alt logins and drops bubble.

---
Wouldn't auto aggro removal effect folk in PvE fighting Serps?
---
I don't mind sensor damp Ewar as blasters, but I'm sure a droneboat player would.  Not everyone running drones is a nullsec VNI botter.
---
Weird way to spell "carrier"
---
... is carrier ratting still a thing?  I actually genuinely enjoyed playing carrier RTS starcraft and managing my fighters in anoms and made enough isk to not stress too much about occasionally fucking up and losing one, would be a shame if that disappeared.
---
For everyone that shits on carrier ratting, the best way to create content is to actually undock and risk a ship so I dont get the argument
---
If joining another corp (or alliance) is not an option for you then null sec really is not an option for you. Most of Null sec is owned by player alliances and mining is only allowed there for people who are part of that alliance.
---
NPC null is not a good place to mine, and you will die easily there.
---
Boss
---
Well, FoF and auto-targeting missiles barely work (never for the former and only sometimes for the latter), so it's sort of moot.
---
All as planned at the barbecue
---
as described I clicked not on a shortcut, but directly on the application.
---
it was okay when it started but they kept nerfing fighters and carrier mechanics until the effort:isk ratio switched to other platforms.
---
you are just going to make people play 3 accounts in that case
---
Every csm has to have the useless meme candidate.
---
I am not quite sure about this. 
---
The idea of group combat anomalies sounds good and would certainly bring some needed variety, but you also have to think about the people that might not necessarily have a group ready at the moment they want to run a site, so you can´t really make it ONLY group anoms.
---
But at any rate anoms need a massive overhaul.
---
The idea of putting a $/hr sign to *activity* is part of the problem.
---
Carrier ratting is still a thing but it's not really a replacement for the VNI, more of a "next step."
---
I have an understanding how bugs and bug testing works. And for a lot of things seemingly innocuous problems have a surprisingly hard to implement solution.
---
But this is just a typo. This is some text that you just need to type some characters in. This really is a one banana problem.
---
This is dumb. You just allowed one person to put 5-8 accounts in one site together.
---
Getting more stupid people friendly
---
Then the war of hypocrisy is gonna be a fun pill to swallow
---
Very nice, we need more of this stuff.
---
Oh shut up kiddo. Even Merkelchen congratulated him at our fireside today. So can you.

---
Is it pure pve? Or do i have to worry about getting killed by players too? How profitable is it compared to other options?
---
I and my friends mostly enjoyed missions, incursions and mining back in the day but got bored since incursions require large amounts of players, missions are meant for soloing and mining gets old fast. From sparse info i was able to get trigvalian stuff includes coop options for small groups of players, so i was excited for new pve and considering to return to try it out, but want to be sure first.
---
Also how hard are those in terms of fit expenses and skill requirements?

Thanks in advance!

Right? I saw the first three were all goons and immediately wondered how the fuck the voting works this way. No hat on gonna, but what if they had eight strong candidates running?
---
The Imperium represents a sizeable chunk of the player population. We also voted for CSM members that are red to us specifically because they are acting in the interests of the game.
---
This has already been discussed. Bots can target manually.
---
When looking for a solution to a problem determining root cause is critical. Also critically search your solution for ways it can be exploited.
---
If you plan on mining in null, be prepared to join a corp in a null alliance or one that rents from one. Yes, you could mine anywhere in null space where there's a belt, but unless you are in a system where there is an NPC station where you can stage out of and process your minerals, good luck. You would be extremely vulnerable to any form of attack. You would need to think on how to safely extract your minerals to a place where you can sell them as well. You could potentially drop a small citadel to aid you, like an Athanor, which provides you with some refinement options and bonuses. However this could also be at risk of destruction if it's close enough to a sov owning alliance. 
---
Even then, your money making wouldn't be as much as you would make in space controlled by an alliance, since the iHubs owned by them are what spawn the mining anomalies that have huge amounts of the rarer ores to mine. With an alliance comes already established infrastructure, company when mining (more targets for anyone that comes in to shoot at besides you), intel, support for when you inevitably get tackled or dropped on, etc. 
---
Take the Imperium for example, since they have focused a lot on their industrial capacity, their iHubs spawn all kinds of mining anomalies . They've set up hundreds of structures all throughout the region that provide bonuses to your refining, ship building, moon mining, reactions, capital production, etc. You could potentially pick out a system and live there without much bother, sell your ore in the local market or export to Jita using their freighter services, and when you eventually train into a Rorqual, you will be in an environment where you would get capital support within minutes if someone were to come harass you.
---
Hey I bumped that ☺️
---
That's not really how market systems work. Lets assume that a change leads to significantly less players deciding to run nullsec anoms. 
---
1. Less isk is generated. Average amount of isk held per player is lower
---
2. Sellers can no longer sell ships and modules at the current price point, so they decrease the cost. 
---
4. Buying power per isk is increased. (Deflation)
---
5. "Worth" of doing anoms increases. 
---
Everything evens out over time, thanks to the fundamentals of a supply and demand market economy.
---
inb4 the mobile app gets the features before the main game.
---
Cool.
---
Maybe you already know all of this, but here we go: 1. Choose the planet you build on. Choose what you are searching for, do you build or sell? You can answer this for yourself. Use this website: https://evehelper.tk/
---
2. Have all the planetary skills around 4 or 5, 5 is much better for command center and planet.
---
3. Scan - put down Command center
---
4. Then put a launchpad down right beside the cc
---
5. use one excavator right besides that
---
6. Use basic facilitys to turn p0 to p1, this means you put them in 5er pairs besides the launchpad. 
---
7. now connect the cc with the launchpad and the excavator with the launchpad.
---
8. Now only link the p1 facilitys to each 5er pair facility. and the last one in line then to the launchpad. 
---
9. Now you need to start digging up the stuff so its important that you balance your facilitys with your average yield. 1 facility uses 3k per h with 10 facilitys you would need 30k average output/h to keep it running. 
---
10. Dont forget to set routes from the launchpad to all facilitys and from the facilitys to the launchpad. 
---
11. profit. But all what I describe is just for simple p0 to p1 production. If you want to make p2 and p3 I really would recommend you have a dedicated planet for production.
---
That looks like a YouTube comment

I lost a gila to the abyss. And then another one to the exact same spawn for the exact same fuckup.

As I said in the OP, this does not aim to combat botting, but AFK ratting.

Nerfing ships commonly used by botters is the ultimate surrender by CCP. They obviously are incapable of handling bots.
---
Back when Tengus were still used to bot, they could have literally just banned all non-cloaky Tengus with nullifiers with a 0% wrongful ban rate, since that is a subsystem combo that no real player used. Instead those bots ran for 5 years+.
---
CCP are either not willing (doubtful) or they just don't have the funds to do it. Both are equally bad.
---
and how is the existence of AFK ratting an issue ?
---
you all were playing checkers...Xenuria was playing 7D Parcheesi while out of his mind on LSD.

But there will still be people making as much ISK as they are now in supers, titans, carriers, bombing machs, wormhole snakes, wormhole dreads etc.

Well done, and deserved. Enjoyed your video, and your interviews with TiS. Glad you're a voice in that room.
---
It was already good lmao. Meanwhile caracal navy issue and exec useless kek
---
I mean he runs from my solo subcaps even when there isn't a single example on my zkill of me lighting a cyno for anyone over the last 6 years.
---
The myrmidon exists
---
&gt; Wouldn't auto aggro removal effect folk in PvE fighting Serps?
---
yes, it would put them on the same level as people using non-drone based weapon systems.
---
All it means is that you can be online in the client instead of safelogged when parking your super on an Astra. The Removal of POS is a huge win for hunters since supers with fighters out, BOSON Titans, and aligned out smartbombing groups can't just warp to the tower and ignore their timers.   
---
It says that it will have the same restrictions as safe logging so as long as you can't moor with a timer then I don't see a problem.
---
the game could be more fun, and i'd still do the afk thing, because it's literally money for nothing, so i could scale it linearly while doing the fun thing.
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
What do you mean? Plz explain ! Soon took what bait ?
---
Not false now.
---
O_O I did no such thing
---
Lol, wtf.
---
I know that, I mean that instead of a VNI spending 30s in warp to the next haven etc. (Which is the vulnerability period for it being caught by a login trap bubble, since it can't initiate warp until it lands) a Dominix spends 60s in warp. Therefore in an hour of ratting a Dominix Bot has 2x the chance approximately of getting caught by a login trap with a dictor
---
is 1 repper sufficient? i was trying to force 2 reppers, i guess that was my issue.
---
What’s the difference between getting isk from bounties and selling rocks for isk
---
He has not gone because of protecting bot while kicking slyce. Many people have not voted for him because of that. Me for example.
---
if a VNI(3 AU/s) takes 30s to warp, it is a 5AU Jump, so the dominix (2 AU/s) will take 45s
---
Oh man the Ishtar was the shiznit until they nerfed her sentry drone damage. I used to dual box a tengu pilot with my Ishtar driver and just clear out escalations.
---
Not saying that's a bad thing.  More just bring up the "other effects" concern.
---
No they're adding a 3rd in addition to getting the damage bonus.
---
&gt; Mooring
---
Pls no
---
How come the only salt we see in this comment section is mouth breathing, kool aid drinking goonies.
---
Space Force!
---
Oh my god, I wish I had joined EVE earlier so I could see this spacetato in all its glory.
---
Indeed, since then not being on the spectrum would be the disorder.
---
I wonder how the change will balance out. Haven't had a proper look at the VNI's new stats. Will it be 'viable' as a ratting ship for people after the changes, just not as good as before? I wouldn't want to remove a good way of earning money with a Cruiser-hull, without having to mine. Which just so happens to usually be the other go-to tactic when it comes to making money. Especially for newer players.

Roll the t2 stuff with decayed plasmids and everything fits only lost 2 of them so far and that was due to rl distracting me  she's a beautiful ship and generally earns itself back in 2/3 runs at worst
---
It's inevitable when the activity in question is boring farming.
---
i'm sure if people with non drone weapons can deal with it, then the effect will be minimal and perfectly acceptable.
---
same with the drone assist nerf that happened.
---
My top 3 made it in! Woo.
---
damn bro nice dino porn
---
How I would do it:
---
Collision damage. Tether now repairs it. However, with proper fit, you could potentially oneshot with a ram though possibly die yourself if its an equal size ship. So ramming mach into a bling fit Ikitsura could oneshot it and go into low armor / maybe structure.
---
And real hero's will use the Eos because it looks dope
---
well done, congratulations.
---
don't fuck it up.
---
These types of players are unrelated to the problem trying to be solved. Players who are using and risking the most expensive ships should be getting the most rewards. They don't represent any real influence in the current inflation state.
---
in one case you get a fixed amount of isk per activity, in the other you don't and you need aditional work to get actual ISKs.
---
In fact, there isn't. I've never been an in cyno for anything other than a JF.
---
Imagine being this dumb.
---
Ship maintanance is to store fitted ships with charges in cargo, no modules, the fleet hangar can fit all your modules/depots etc.
---
One character will always be stuck in the orca, other characters can then store and grab ships out of it's hold, like switching your scanner to a salvager.
---
&gt; it's aimed at afk ratting armies.
---
no it fucking isn't.
---
you want people to stop being afk? then stop drones automatically taking actions players otherwise would have to take - remove drones ability to engage a target without input.
---
you'd still technically be able to do that if you assist drones
---
Didn’t realize dropping ore off at a structure for a buyback to pick up counted as work, lol
---
Oh then thats great i really look forward to using it then. The Vexor is my favorite cruiser and the VNI not so much because it was basically a completely different ship. I wonder if it's possible for me to mod these changes into pyfa so i can poke around with it now.
---
so many things you don't realize.
---
Hm. 10B he gets punted for inappropriate outburst during a meeting.
---
They aren't really risking much, and Supercarrier ratting has been quoted as one of the biggest contributers towards the current inflation by CCP on multiple occasions. They've posted statistics years ago showing that the overall supercarrier ratting ISK generation easily matches the overall VNI ratting ISK injection, and that was years ago back when human VNIs were still actually a fairly common thing.
---
&gt;Removing drone auto aggression would solve all the issues connected with AFK farming, as it would require a human´s input to "cycle" the drones on a target. You know, just like any other weapon system in the game except auto targeting missiles which are utter shite.
---
Oh look, it's this argument again. 
---
Because it's impossible to code a bot to press F now and then.
---
posting is free, but maybe it shouldnt be
---
350 isk
---
Hahahah
---
This has been the same since 2003. The game is still thriving, and will always adapt.
---
This is it. I'm moving back to wh space.
---
You had 30 improvements to eve moving forward. Push them hard. Don't let the older csm members hold you back. Don't fall for "this is not how it works bs"  this is your chance to be an eve legend. I have faith in you!
---
They look about as comfortable as Hilmar did when he was waiting for our applause
---
Congrats on being voted in. Its interesting that we hear that people want a more 'dangerous Eve'. Maybe this is the reason for the larger blocs being formed in the first place? 
---
Maybe the first place to start is with resources. Why can a region be so exploited and pull so much wealth with such a high population? This is where I would start. Maybe R64 moons (or any moon) once exploited should randomly appear somewhere else for Eg.
---
It actually costs time. The problem is, it's also costing us the same time to read and even more to forget.
---
If I was to undock today, being away from the game for years.... I would go with solo arty thrasher... and of course wonder what the hell most of the new ships are that im chasing. Best way to learn (and have fun) is to do or die :D
---
Not really a meme candidate though is he?! Actually a capable, intelligent player that truly gives a shit about the game...
---
It's not boring if you're not active.
---
Does anyone have a link to the VNI changes mentioned in this post? Trying to get ahead of the game and see what I need to change to
---
Ah okay. So pretty standard just lack of faction mods

Thankfully being AFK still has consequences.... for now.
---
How is a 10 minute video of someone killing a carrier proof of an intent to betray/awox? You need your head examined.
---
bee man really bad
---
They were announced earlier today at Eve North
---
Thanks a lot! This is pretty much what I have been searching for, and I am able to build up from that. I was missing a detailed description like that. :)
---
Thanks again &amp; fly safe o7!
---
&gt; Regarding the rep bonus, gallente and minmatar get rep bonuses and caldari and amarr get resist bonuses.
---
But not along the rest of the Navy class cruisers. Expect for that one Amarr one that gets a raw HP bonus, but even then that's an anomaly among all ships in the game.
---
And I did notice the reduction in drone bandwidth, but it still has 3 heavies compared to its non-navy counterpart with mostly the same bonuses. Unless I'm underestimating the application (tracking) bonus.
---
Oh look, it is someone who doesn't know the difference between AFK player and botter.
---
So you end up replacing AFK ratting with AFK mining
---
fuck off you b tier propaganda drone.
---
Yeah please explain this sounds interesting?
---
Ishtar?
---
350.01 isk and some lint I found in my belly button.
---
How long is it going to take for you to realise that nobody wants a shitty T2 BPO? I get that you might have been stupid enough to buy one but that doesn't mean the rest of us are.
---
If you want to get the hype train halted, have it be a plex based feature
---
Much appreciated, I needed this.
---
I ran the numbers by simply fitting up several ships that have the same bonuses that it's gonna have and checking the numbers that way. Except for tracking bonuses it's gonna have the combined skill bonuses of the Brutix and Myrmidon.
---
Best meme format ever. Mustafir and salaman would be proud
---
Not really sure what your point is there. Rorq mining needs nerfing too. Small ship mining isn't really a problem because (i) you can't AFK it for that long before your hold fills, and (ii) the rate of return is really low.
---
I have no clue who you are since I quit in 2013, but kudos to finding a way to enjoy the game on your terms.
---
Congrats Olmeca! You were my number 1 vote mate! o7
---
but remember when domi was a beast.. when it could use 10 heavy drones... man those were the days...
---
Well, couldn't I help supplement the playerbase by hiring mercenary/pirate corporations in the area? Perhaps hiring a hog group or something similar to fight them? Or even throwing extra income towards alliances for protection?
---
I have the projectile ones written down on a piece of paper on my desk because I can never remember them.
---
sweet summer child
---
worked your ass off out there, hopefully when you get back from iceland ccp will remember the game they made
---
Lol wibla pls
---
That design had so much soul in it
---
I'm an independent voter who had you #1 slot, very satisfied to see you made it onto the CSM!
---
One thing I hope you'll petition CCP about a revamp to bounty hunting and kill rights to connect them together with a contract-like system to be able to turn bounty hunting into a proper career path. We should all get to bring out our inner John Wick. Individuals and corporations should be able to rise to become feared bounty hunters. So far, CCP has completely failed on the power fantasy of bounties.
---
Make bounties something more than "cool points" that are an utter joke as it stands today, or kill rights more than a means for people to insurance fraud while simultaneously scamming. Getting a bounty should be dangerous. Hunting a bounty should be lucrative.
---
It seems the spodbrain finally has gotten to you Ichinumi..
---
I don't see this in the patch notes. Where is it?
---
WTF DID THEY ACTUALLY TRIED TO FIGHT?
---
Well that's a first. They usually run if they can't get a easy dunk.
---
very valid point,  or a gila.  
---
I do want to state though,  that eve has many playstyles.  
---
As people get older, less time to pay attention,   the afk vni was a great tool,  that keep those players in the game with risk/reward.  
---
Forcing every playstyle to be active,  just look at carrier ratting and mining,   its not for everyone.   I used to sentry carrier rat,  and used drone agression to clear sites.   
---
I dont use the new carrier and the fighter mechanics,  people i know downgraded from super back to carrier cus it was too annoying.   
---
The playstyles  not the isk/hr is what i find important in the game tbh.  So this downgrade on the VNI its a bad choise imho,  sure the afking and isk making was low effort.  But look at all these active ratting styles in Abyss,  making 400mil/hr .    
---
I predict,  if CCP keeps this up and kills all the low effort isk-making efforts in the game,  there wont be many of us staying arround.   Cus grinding isk is boring,  has always been this way,  except for looting player ship wrecks.
---
fuck yeah - been looking forward to this  and actually earlier today was wondering when next one would be out
---
Good, just need a century to make back the investment...
---
The biggest meme is the fucking PCgaming mods are also being massive fascists and deleting everything on that thread too.
---
wasn't bumping considered an exploit at one time...?
---
I would like to know your definition on PVE content, and what's the ultimate purpose people make isk in this game
---
Epic posting my man!  There is something simply epic about sitting cloaked waiting for a wreck to spawn and scooping it in to your dst hangar with a script.
---
not a bad meme gay boy
---
yeah definitely.
---
remember though that the 700 DPS is mediocre vs a big target.
---
yes we are ! I'll buy it 400 isk !
---
Throw in Sion Kumitomo and yeah it would be interesting.
---
Who cares about afk ratting? I don't know why they changed the VNI to make it unviable, but I don't think there is anything wrong with having options for AFK ratting. It's dangerous lol
---
they are alpha bots probably.
---
no I don't. I genuinely think the VNIs do very little money in AFK ratting, so it's not an issue.
---
yes they suck they need to call enemies to kill me
---
oh thats happend to me way before 64 bit client ever came out
---
&gt; CFC narrative
---
actually good changes Pog
---
you won't. Domis can perma tank a sanctum, and remain constantly aligned.
---
I do that already, but id prefer if eve pve was actually fun and interesting
---
Which do you think is more harmful? Bots of AFK players? Cause if you don't want AFK players let's fucking remove mining yeah?
---
Anything is possible with an assfrig
---
Ah, my mistake. I apologise.
---
Just out of curiosity, do you see a human afk ratting as some sort of scourge? We need to stop people from putting targets out in space that don't insta warp safe when you appear in local.
---
Bots that do and are everywhere are cool though?
---
Oooh thanks for that hot tip.
---
or gila
---
No problem, I sorta get a kick out of the fact that the "nerf" is to basically take the skill bonus from 2 battlecruisers, make them better, and put them on a cruiser hull.
---
My friend made it possible.
---
same, but pretending this change actually combats afk ratting is just retarded on ccp's part.
---
We can only hope
---
nah i'll never own a rorq
---
Sorry I had not noticed this pretention from CCP, just read the new VNI status  on readd it.  
---
I've seen people claiming there was an issue, and so I just don't get it. But if CCP thinks it's an issue, there goes my opinion.
---
I came across your campaign video by accident. Your passion for your play style has got me logged back in for the first time in years. Thanks for that as I am enjoying my time in New Eden again. 
---
All the best with your future endeavours. 😊
---
Being able to post a link in the MOTD to a particular folder would be helpful.

"Hurr durr a bunch of frigates can't kill a capital ship, what losers!"

You either have very limited knowledge of the game or are just a moron. Probably both.
---
You could always go Ewar my dude.  usually doesn't take too long for the train and the support makes for a very powerful response fleet.  
---
A longer train time would be logistic ships, if not more important and everyone would love you for it.
---
they suck dislike and report video they cant kill a carrier by themselfs they made my alters go ban because a havoc video
---
dirty blobbers

2 reppers is cap stable with large cap battery t2 +4 cap rechargers T2 \^\^
---
Thanks. Do you like Ewar?

So find a corp that doesn't force you to do shit you don't want to. PvP is fun though and tackling is one of the best roles a newbro cam do. Buy a few, or better yet ask the corp for, several cheap tackle atrons and go wild.
---
Ha, I was hoping that was a real cheat sheet...
---
I'll end in Corp/alliance one way or another, just having to solo it for now until a decision is reached by the clan. I was just curious if there was a way to get into it now. Guess I'll wait then
---
I’m currently training covetors now, not completely because of this but now I’m definitely going to be using those industry skills for more than crafting

Met an Australian newbro quite a few years ago named James. I recruited him into the corporation I was in and I taught him just about everything I could teach him at the time. He stuck with me for through quite a few different groups and through thick and thin. (Both real life and in-game) 5 years later and he's a super capital pilot, and we're still in the same corporation together. Without the guy, my eve experience and accomplishments wouldnt be half of what they are today. If you're just starting eve be sure to make some good friends. They're more valuable than anything else the game has to offer.
---
Sell me on this please. Why is tackling fun? Are there videos online of people doing cool stuff tackling, or a tutorial that makes it all come alive, or what? I'm not knocking it, but from my POV it seems more boring (and more instantly deadly) than clicking a rock. Do you have any cool stories from tackling, anything?
