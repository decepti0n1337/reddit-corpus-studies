What are your eve goals that you can’t accomplish?
---
---
---
hah, hard to tell snark from genuine stupidity here
---
Hey Holesale guy, you should un-anchor the keepstar for no fucking reason
---
Passive vs Active skilling and gathering systems are something I've been thinking about and looking into for quite some time now. They both have their ups and downs.
---

---
When it comes to skilling
---
Passive Skilling
---
* Easy to use
---
* "Grind Free"
---
* Can be done offline
---
* Static, meaning there's little to nothing you can do to make it faster
---
Active Skilling
---
* You get skills while playing the game
---
* Can be significantly faster than Passive
---
* Gives a good feeling of progression
---
* Easier to create and skill new characters
---
* Very grind heavy
---
Active Skilling usually always turns into Passive one with macros as its the most efficient to do
---
Behold a D-tier post.
---
If you want to print money, a single Rorqual won't get you very far.
---
Lower bomb speed means easier to boosh. But;
---
1) The 1 km explosion radius requires you to stagger the bombs to deal damage with all of them. You can't order your entire fleet to bomb at the same time and deal damage with all of them. This means the maximum number of these bombs that you can carry over with booshing is 12. More than that mathematically won't deal the damage. It is also practically impossible for your fleet to get a perfectly optimized stagger with 1 km distance in-between. So you'll probably be able to carry over no more than 4-5, even with stagger, and that still requires each individual fleet member to communicate. So basically your scenario is RNK level shenanigan inaccessible to most fleets at best, practically impossible at worst. 
---
2) Slower bombs also means easier to firewall or use defender missiles against. That's the main anticipated counter to these bombs and it will still work against booshed bombs.
---
OP buying half the market in the hopes price rise?
---
Thats way more effort than anchor and F1.
---
I haven’t logged in, in a long time.  But I know this feeling so well.   Such an amazing community.
---
The core tenant of your post (other than cleaning up excess waste) is that:
---
&gt; a player might not be able to afford meta4 while not having the skills for meta 5  
---
AFAIK, only launchers have expensive meta 4 mods.  
---
Fuck, Meta 4 cap boosters beat out Meta 5 most of the time for less ISK.
---
Is NPE revamp actually a bad thing though?
---
Why even have citadels then, or pos for that matter.  
---
Lets all store our shit in invincible npc stations and live life out of a mobile depot with tether.
---
Sounds lame a fuck, and the dream of shitlords who live in frigates in some shit teir alliance.
---
They really did rent out a conference room to announce what they couldve made a small dev blog about.
---
Sounds like some of that might be covered my moderate to heavy damage to all 3 layers of tank when they jump.
---
Your comments are the most low IQ takes I've read on this topic. Educate yourself before you post again. 
---
I'm tempted to block you just so I don't have to read anything you type ever again. 
---
But first I'll start your education. Making players like OP mentioned leave, will cause the game to bleed players. Students during assignments, people on holiday, soldiers, those who can't afford to do Eve shifts all day every day should never be punished. If CCP ever removed it completely at this point, you and the handful of others who would remain aboard the sinking ship wouldn't have enough weapons grade autism to keep the lights on.
---
I really hope they nuke your account too, you fat fuck. You don't know shit about caps.
---
Honest to god get aids and biomass (ingame)
---
Fun? You noob! In my days we didn't have fun, we set the clock for two hours so we could mine in industrials.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
And yep, thats exactly my worry.
---
Us players in the game can just ignore /r/eve and not care. We're having fun, we don't mind what the subreddit thinks.
---
The problem is that potential newbros and returning players could absolutely make their decision based on the extreme negativity in this sub!
---
Glad to hear you're flying and having fun though :)
---
Hope you've found a good corp!
---
Daeee stoofs ploxxxx xD
---
Nullsec is more isk/hr (in the right regions, so preferably sansha's nation space, and if not them then guristas), but also a lot more dangerous, especially since you can't easily pop out to hisec and drop off your loot. 
---
If you are omega, and are willing to die a few times (or more than a few times, as in my case) to learn, then I can give you some tips on nullsec explo, it was my main source of income for a few months, although at this point i'm kind of burned out on it, and c3 krabbing in my praxis is just as good without nearly as much effort. 
---
One downside is that, for whatever reason (my guess is the wars are all over now, so less ships dying) there is a lot less demand for tech 2 rigs now than there was a year ago, so prices for exploration loot have fallen across the board. Its still good money, but not quite as good as it used to be.
---
Totally, loving eve. I am convinced that everyone bitching on r eve don't actually play the game.
---
It was meant to balance the progression between no lifers and casual players.
---
Of course, skill injectors ruined that.
---
More or less exactly :)
---
It will depend on where you live. Are you in a corp, or just solo in hisec still?
---
Dang who hurt you dude
---
since the link just got removed, what was this about?
---
I guess they didn’t fix all the stupid
---
The polarisation doesn’t need to last very long, it’s only there to force spreading out of the mini-lances to prevent volleying. Potentially even something ~20-30 seconds would be enough. Good idea :)
---
Haha you salty bro?
---
There also very unpredictable issue that can come up. What if you are in a car crash and get hospitalized for a week. Should you be force to lose everything or forced to get a laptop and try to evacuate everything while high on pain killers from a hospital bed? Stranded in an airport during a blizzard?
---
In the end there needs to be more of a cost to the system and part of that cost should be rewarded to the attacker but having some system to protect people from loosing everything is absolutely vital to the health of the game.
---
I started 12 years ago, but like everyone I've had periods of not being active. And I agree with pretty much everything you've said - the only thing I wish I could change is I wish more of the pilots I have gotten to know across that time were still flying.
---
I quitted EVE in 2016 after playing for 3-4 years. Came back this month because a couple of friends decided to start playing and wanted me around to tutor them and guide them towards content.
---
We got into abyssal deadspace, which is new for me (and incredibly fast &amp; fun, lot's of isk to be made too), exploration (newbros love it), lowsec roaming and even trying to figure out Triglavian invasions.
---
It's fun. It's all fun and functional and working. But this place, reddit, it's fucking depressing.
---
They told you.. to buy plex?
---
Nice, report them to ccp. That's like.. one of the few things they'll actually care about. 
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203218892-Scams
---
&gt;Scams that encourage the mark to purchase PLEX in order to acquire the ISK/Items
---
If they pushed you to buy plex, you can actually report them, which idk what that'll do for you but they may end up getting bans, so lmao fuck 'em
---
To your points I feel naming them at this point will make me a larger target. I'll link the kill mail from the stations after they've been destroyed.
---
EvE is one of THE most social games period.

Trying to enjoy is entirely by yourself would be like trying to enjoy a car whilst refusing to put fuel in it

ie CCP's way to give gankers something after removing their ability to gank
---
Wow, TIL.
---
Well the point being it wasnt a loss before. You are trying to present it as such which is wrong. You firesold your shit or you got into the group that owned the station and moved your stuff. You lost a bit isk on it but it wasnt that bad.
---
Thats the same as asset safety. What you are suggesting is that people should lose more than that. That has not existed outside of POSs. 
---
And people still havent presented why it should even be a thing. Like I stated, people arent rushing to kill industrial structures which means there wont be any signficant upside but there will most def be a downside.
---
That means its a negative change. If you want to present it as a positive please give reason why removal of asset safety will do anything.
---
Just like those disrespectful Chinese tourists
---
We are not blue to legacy. 
---
They have probably asked though.
---
thank you. o7
---
WoT gold ammo, now in Eve form!
---
How about a module you activate on titans and the pilot has 48 hours to prove to a GM that they have a girlfriend or they get permabanned
---
&gt;can you read
---
&gt;there were options to recover some of the value
---
not always, and not in wormholes.
---
&gt;Nullsec never had it.
---
what are POS
---
Maybe you've missed the last four years were CCP has delivered jack all on time.
---
ADC is the exact issue cuz you have guaranteed 15s tackle time no matter how much dps the target has.
---
Without ADC it’s not that much issue cuz you can just focus dps and make it bail.
---
Sure AFs has p decent tank cuz it’s T2 resist, but it’s a frigate anyway. It has only(?) 16k~17k ehp when managed perfectly, which is like 1/2 of poor fit T1 cruiser.
---
&gt;The risk did not exist pre citadel. 
---
it did.
---
Citadels replace stations and POS.
---
Also you literally skipped over the line that covers the first thing you said. Wormholes are different and have always been that way. You knew going into a wormhole what would could happen if you had to stop playing unexpectedly. In nullsec if you left, everything left in an outpost would still be in that outpost when you came back. You may not be able to directly access it but you had options.
---
if the fees lapse and the structure was reinforced even in shield the corp cant wardec same corp for another 2 weeks.
---
easy fix
---
Can you seriously not see why a mechanic that allows fleets with the least mobility to be the most mobile fleets in the game is problematic?
---
Pretty sure most of them got fired during staff cuts following one of CCP's many, many failed projects.
---
Stop comparing yourself to them and it'll be fine..
---
You can absolutely play EVE with only one account
---
Just don't come bitching to r/eve about wanting to limit everyone to only one signed in account  at a time once you're a bittervet
---
Very cool challenge actually I would love to see people pulling that off
---
Imagine if the visual design is not a bomb launcher, but a spinal weapon with the whole ship based around it.
---
I am honestly confused by this, the whole point of my system is so that if something like being deployed happens, you can just asset safety your stuff, and it is there for you (in the same citadel, system, or low sec) when you get back. So, as an honest question, why does this not work?
---
I hope this box wasn\`t empty...
---
Yes the players created citadel mechanics and injectors didnt they?
---
Those local mjds have a cooldown, something that having 30 booshers in your fleet compensated for. Now it will no longer be the case per se especially if the first boosh take only the boohsers with it :D
---
Get out there and make an appointment to eventually kick over some sandcastles.
---
"pretty sure the corp is defunct now"  
---
&gt; first thing the video does is mention CO2    
---
yea... its dead
---
Most activities don't require any multiboxing.
---
Even more "advanced" things can be done with friends.
---
But some activities basically require groups to be "competitive" and it's easier to multibox than to rely on another person.
---
But there is plenty you can do with just one character. The only point this because a real issue is at the capital ship stage.
---
Minerals you mined are free
---
All it does is shift the balance.
---
How so you define what balance is good and what balance is bad?
---
Also, it's just an event.
---
Yup. All this does is shift the "safe" hauling point a bit for a week.
---
Another problem is that a ship can go from useless to OP from a mere 10% increase in fitting, and CCReee seriously things a 20% swing on most stats is actually acceptable?  Guess that's one way they never have to balance again, everything will be a clusterfuck.
---
Don't think you even read the post...
---
Yeah that's the good thing is it's only temp but I do like the idea just think it could of been better prepped so not so many potential loop holes. I am gonna have fun PVPing with it for sure :D
---
Explain me why do you think that higsec hauling should be safe?       
---
Why you can kill someone freighter in nullsec or lowsec but the same guy should be safe in his freighter in higsec?
---
"loop holes" or "intended behavior"?
---
...did I ever say I think that?
---
The bastards should let players do that.  The game is a sandbox.
---
The whole point of the nerf was to effectively kill blob stukas, boosh ravens/eagles/muninns/whatever, while still keeping small scale booshing and offensive booshing alive. This nerf is perfectly implemented for that. 
---
  Especially stukas were way too broken and cancerous, and defined every major fleet fight to the point where FCing skill just didn't matter anymore, there was no room for outplaying, especially when already outnumbered. 
---
   Yes, loosing one of the two viable rorq hunting doctrines is a shame, and ccp really needs to address that as well ( hoping for heavy bombs), but in now way did that justify the boosh cancer that defined almost every fight.
---
What he meant by shield relay tiericide is probably different from what you meant. IIRC they talked about giving power relays the same diminishing returns in exchange for a buff, but then never followed through. I think that's what they meant.
---
Good fight! but legit question, doesn't that content seem like 'staged' fights? Kudos to you wormholers trying to have some fun, but I thought people in this sub frowned upon staged content.
---
Serious questions. How long did this take you? How bored were you? And how much had you had to drink to think this was a good idea?
---
I'd be more impressed if the security team was more than 2 people, that'd be am even bigger start.
---
You can get proof (i know why should we do their jobs) and email security@ccpgames or just report them a as a bot.

STFu opinioned clown. I bet you have never stepped up to FC anything yet here you are. INIT are shit but Stukas and booshing Ravens require cordination and a single fuck up will send you to the dumpster compare to just Jump the cyno stand still and shoot with a Super.

Cringe propaganda poster lul
---
Funny to think this game is nearly as old as I am.
---
no it means stuff smaller than [value] doesnt take full dmg
---
I guess they should never change it so its the same as when I did it 10years ago
---
Not as much as you'd think. Everyone knows this event is time-limited so people will probably just wait out the little bubble on the market. A lot of the stuff that drops won't get looted and probably most of the stuff that drops won't get sold immediately, so we'll see a slight increase in supply for general ship equipment for a few months, nothing significant. Probably the only markets that are really going to be affected will be Deadspace and Officer modules.
---
TL;DR: It'll have some minor effect but it won't be the end of the world. The additional supply will probably be balanced by manufacturers and ratters holding on to their supplies until the end of the week.
---
It's in the launcher. Kinda hard to miss, it's *right there* before you start your game. And if you don't see that then you deserve to get ganked.
---
it's okay, 95%+ of freighter ganks have stopped since the removal of highsec bumping
---
StainGuy: So desperate for content he's resorted to simply making shit up.
---
Gilas/Ishtars you say ??? Damn poor VNIs, no love for them after the nerf.
---
Prorator best BR.
---
Short: you are an idiot.
---
Long: saving time grinding isk may be a personal advantage but doesnt give you any advantage over other people. Having a ship with all purple modules doesnt make you invincible or guarantees a ein over anyone else. Paying doesnt make you better in PvP Nor in any other activity. It helps you save time and thats about it.
---
Arguably the beat change during this presentation.
---
Glad they are nerfing the untouchable, annoying fleets.
---
Fuck I would resub just to use a t2 Talos. That is my favorite ship in the game by a wide margin. It just speaks to me on a deep level, both aesthetically and functionally.
---
Did you not see the anti-cap bombs?
---
Spot on. Instead of whining like bitches because you no longer use this cowardly tacyics, adapt guys. Have fun doing something different.
---
Stuka vs Stuka fleets Online was boring af
---
Good writeup.  I've noticed a lot of the same things, though the advent of sebo'd huginns camping novice gates is not a good one for what should be the most accessible pvp in the game.  It seems even while trying to cripple and phase out highsec ganking in favor of NPE, they have introduced an even more toxic and pointless way to spend your gaming time.  I would love for there to be more of a counter to this without first feeding 1 ship and then reshipping into your own recon.
---
Did you recently updated any GPU drivers?
---
depends on what you do i guess. eve is vast game with so much to do and it's hard to not recognize that CCP has ignored and or killed a lot of playstyles.
---
this reads like someone going "i am not hungry so world hunger must be a hoax"
---
No, but you can sack excess audio dudes and hire more coder dudes, dumbo.
---
it's almost as if there are different things to do in eve and some are just not as fun as they used to be or even completely killed off
---
Thank you very much. Excuse my ignorance. But what is a Mach?
---
nice way of saying n+1
---
Hateless Gaming does a lot of highsec PvE and has several guides tutorials like this one:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emvcUpKFYJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emvcUpKFYJA)
---
thank god for avree
---
and them being so expendable that they just drop 2 new ones for everyone destroyed
---
i feel really bad for the game if you are the kind of player that's left...
---
I also was in WERMT, that's the reason why I am commenting this. They were aware of many botting issues but would only act when shit blew up at their faces like Reddit posts.
---
doesn't change the game being shite
---
This is accurate. It's been a near complete cliff drop. Miniluv is nowhere to be found, Benji Rackner quit ganking in Niarja to instead run another JF service for NCdocked.
---
J Kusion has done occasionally gank nights in Uedama, Sobaseki, and Perimeter, and a new group, Rapid Deconstruction, has bounced between Niarja and Aufay for a half dozen or so ganks.
---
But essentially, freighter ganking is dead. I see people hauling 10 to 20 bil at a time through the pipes now, which was a surefire death 3 months ago.
---
DST and t1 Industrial ganking is the new hotness, but frankly it makes me sad to see all these overly full on value freighters not getting ganked.
---
This event will be very informative as to the state of high-sec ganking circa 2019. If even 100% loot drop isn't enough to warrant attention to freighters, then I expect shipping costs to further plummet.
---
He means the machariel faction battleship
---
as are collectively a lot of other people with the same playstyle...strange
---
This should be higher, solid point.  Unless it's 300 IQ play by ccp to flush out rmters
---
i never got this argument. the devs make the rules, the players play by them. it's like saying "we don't need laws punishing murderers if we all just stop murdering folk". how naive
---
I think it should provide an SP bonus. Then (new) players you have an incentive to try different paths, and SP to help them get ships/skills they want faster.
---
Any subcap doctrine with 100km range. So basically a variety of different doctrines would do a good enough job to derail a booshraven fleet if flown right. And ofc you could add booshes ontop of it but for some reason the other guys are not allowed to use it?
---
And if booshravens are so op why aren't there boosh raven fleets roaming around everywhere?
---
Well, on that we can disagree. The bump changes were done primarily for low and null capitals, afaik. Freighters were a side affect.
---
Freighter ganking, as a possibility, is not dead. The drop off illustrates simply how much of it relied on the Miniluv preferred method of finding a target and bumping it for 10 to 60 minutes while a fleet was pinged, assembled, and relocated to target, and ensuring the target was bumped outside of gate gun range.
---
J Kusion continues to excel at his method, but that requires being in system and ready, and actively tackling your target just off gate while DPS warps in. It also means there is at minimum a 12 minute window where no targets would be available, unless you cycle suicide points every just less than 3 minutes.
---
J Kusion excels at what he does, and he's been doing it with essentially this method for years, and he illustrates that freighter ganking, as a mechanical possibility, is not dead. 
---
This is the same method Rapid Deconstruction uses effectively as well. 
---
The bump mechanic adjustments simply raised the effort bar, and it's been interesting to see how easily so many simply gave up, to the point that freighter ganks nearly completely dropped off the map.
---
So you know, there are a bunch of new options for dangerous but better paying, PvE now.  
---
Abyssal space pockets take less than 20 minutes to complete, one way or another, and drop the powerful new Triglavian ship parts and blueprints.  There are multiple guides for cheap fittings to get you started, but high tier abyssal ships get blingy.  
---
You can also fight the Triglavians in an Incursion type situations, joining up with a fleet community and follow them around HS.  PM Plasticty in game and I can link a community an old corporate helps FC and has lured him out of null.
---
There's also new level 4 Burner missions where you face between 1 and 3 high end frigates fighting with an advanced AI and lots of ewar and scrams.
---
Diamond Rats (have a diamond in front of their name) show up in belts, often as mining ships.  If you engage them or just have bad standings, they will call for highly lethal backup fleets.  If you can figure out where the mining ships warp off too, you can attack their home station.  It is possible to solo those in HS with the right fit, but be aware, they will chase you in warp, camp stations, and pod you.
---
I would definitely get into a corp, before buying stuff.  The meta has changed a lot and there's tons of new activities, ships, mods.  Newish Micro Jump Drives spool for 10 seconds then blink your battlecruiser or battleship forward 100km, this can drastically change how you fit long range ships.  
---
10 years ago data/relic hacking was sitting in orbit till the rng did its thing, now its a hex based minesweeper mini-game.
---
Talk to folx in-game and get caught up on things, you'll be a lot better off than buying a bunch of stuff that would have been fine a decade ago.  And feel free to drop me a line, I love doing ship fitting.
---
This fixed the issue. 
---
You sir are awesome and I thank you for this.
---
I wish I could upvote this 100x
---
You should be happy their goal is success instead of developing walk in closets. Eve is a social game but most of that socializing happens outside of the client - with programs/apps/acitivies that are a lot better than the eve development team could hope to create. Some features really would serve very few people without some heavy development investment.
---
ever FC'd a boosher fleet? no? me neither. but also i don't spew my half assed opinion on it.
---
You get a nyx, and you get a nyx, everyone gets a nyx!
---
Exactly. Rerolling items over and over the bricking it all the way back down. Oof.
---
&gt;The bump changes were done primarily for low and null capitals, afaik. 
---
ccp EXPLICITLY stated otherwise years ago
---
&gt;J Kusion excels at what he does, and he's been doing it with essentially this method for years, and he illustrates that freighter ganking, as a mechanical possibility, is not dead.
---
yeah just because you can gank autopiloters doesn't mean it's not dead
---
you seem to misunderstand how ganking works.
---
Sure, I have a few empty containers you can have. Or maybe you want some ammo instead?
---
you either needs alts or friends with alts to be competitive.
---
how is that different to AFKing your rorquals for 16 hours and buying injectors?
---
Good idea, bad execution. No one likes "random" binary effects. Remember pre-nerf ECM?
---
Maybe start with something like fuel. Or repairs requiring minerals.
---
Hmmm, logis with cargoholds full of minerals. Tasty.
---
limited supply and all that.
---
Ah hello ccp. I'm incredibly risk adverse, can you remove all random chance from the game? Thanks. Sincerely, OP
---
Imp intensifies.
---
You don't need to multi-box. I have two screens, and have two accounts, so sometimes I do... usually I don't. Often one is just sitting in station because I logged in to check PI and was done an hour ago.
---
Its a convenience, but nothing I need. I can run some stuff around, or make a quick market run while a PVP fleet is forming, or while it is burning somewhere. However, I dock that shit up asap if there is even a possibility of engagement. (I have used the return of the pvp fleet my main is in to screen industrial movements by my alt....er...I mean used my alt to "bait" for the fleet on the way back.....)
---
Its very hard to competently manage 2+ ships, even more so if they are not doing the exact same thing. 
---
A lot of people multi-box; a lot less people actively multi-box subcapital pvp. It is fairly more common at the capital level where a lot of capital pilots will be multi-boxers who are also a sub-capital. Since the capitals are often just held on standby, or used in fairly non-risky situations, its often possible to focus on the subcapital ship while only occasionally using the capital. ofc, if it comes down to a choice of which ship might have to be lost to inattention, its often a pretty easy decision.
---
I have been playing on and off for years, have two accounts, and can't fly a single capital ship. One of my main plans for the alt is actually to train into capitals, for exactly this reason, so I can be on standby for the big toys, while still participating in the day to day.
---
Yes, they are real. Someone is probably manipulating the market.
---
And cap levels
---
I'd totally come and see you, except for the whole getting arrested then shot thing
---
[deleted]
---
That's the root of eves fundamental balancing approach, though.
---
Big ships (a couple ship classes higher) not reliably being able to hit. 
---
Caps are in every respect several ship classes above even BS, just that we don't have hulls to fill the in-betweens. (Meaning EHP, DPS potential, fitting space etc.)
---
Potato potato
---
Closest thing I used like that was activating all high slots with one click. And I haven't see anything telling me that's illegal. I've never heard of one click one action rules. Again it's broadcasting and automated inputs.
---
If you have something in the eula that says one click one action I'd be happy to read it. But ccp can't even agree on language for the most part.
---
So go steal the polarized weapons out of their wrecks. 
---
Who gives literally any shits about killboard padding
---
&gt;Perhaps I can share some of my irl experience
---
oh my god no one fucking cares, it's a fucking video game, fuck off
---
That's ironic. Handwaving everything with "it's just a game" is exactly what makes you worthless and not qualified as a game designer.
---
Why live your life like this.
---
All OP said was ‘screw wrecking shots’ and you instantly jump to that conclusion? For all anyone knows he could have had a laugh at it and wanted to share, we don’t know. Instead you instantly jump to the ‘reeeee’ style comments that have beaten this subreddit to death.
---
good thing we're playing a FUCKING VIDEO GAME AND NOT ACTUALLY MAINTAINING THESE SHIPS IRL

I don't see the problem.
---
I will be able to take an holiday of one week, thanks for this ludicrous idea.
---
More seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if it is a sort of hidden experiment unlike the Blackout. To motivate to PVP, raising the reward can be a decent tactic so I guess CCP want to try it... But again, it is something who benefit FULLY to the hunters, while the prey have no counter-measures apart stay docked, as it was for the Blackout which hunters still got all intel while the preys lost all. So it will be a failure, again. CCP never learn.

You have 3 minutes to warp to the initial bumper if you're already set up to gank. Plenty of time.
---
You just can't sit there waiting for a juicy target and then form AFTER you catch him.
---
Yoah, if you’ve got small crystals hit me up XD
---
Cannot upvote more this comment.        
---
Same for r/eve           
---
Those are 2 places where i cut myself from real world.
---
with the PLEX vault in existence anyone dropping plex was already getting turboflagged for RMT, I guarantee you
---
This is the final step in the blue donut process.. nobody else left to shoot at.
---
Thanks i been trying different thinks and so far the hardest part is to learn what to kill first, I did tier 3 with no issues but had about 1 min left one each
---
well my bet is: "How can my Alliance make isk off this knowing it in advance" 
---
or
---
If this doesn't help our alliance i will voice my option ageist it.
---
Sirens were huge mistake. Damps are Gallente Racial Ewar not warp disruption!
---
"loot fairy being an isk sink" was an assumed fact from the original comment.
---
And I thought u/Stainguy was on the lose again.

---
there literally is nothing about this in the image you gave.
---
Also the need to expand the launcher to know about something means people won't know it by default.
---
well it's not.
---
If it's when the little "logging in" window shows saying it's processing bulk data, CCP has announced that it has a new back end change in the works that will completely eliminate that window. I think it's essentially moving a lot of client data from bulk data to streamed data.
---
Yes, I heard about a guy input broadcasting a bunch of Stratios. We should watch for that as well.
---
Well. It's 10 years :) all those stuff are new to me. But thanks for the tip!
---
you claimed the launcher contains this information. It does not. I just said it does not. Nothing more.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Again : THE LAUNCHER DOES NOT CONTAIN THIS INFORMATION.
---
BTW it does not contain a link to this information either.
---
Also expecting people will keep the default width of the launcher "in case CCP suddenly decides to hide something there" is stupid. YOU don't know if people keep or not the default value, don't claim they do.
---
This post reminds me of that family guy scene where Peter Griffin is screaming "Look at me!"
---
You mad bro?
---
It was weak as hell, off the top of my head I can only think of the frig change to cepters and the trip dread. there was some hints at stuff but all in all a total wet blanket.
---
Not gona stop me playing the game tho i fkn love eve, but really let down how little there was for what is essentially the last ever EvE vegas.
---
You say that as if other game devs are better in that regard. That has definitely not been my experience.
---
I sexually identify as the "I sexually identify as an attack helicopter" joke. Ever since I was a child, I've dreamed of flippantly dismissing any concepts or discussions regarding gender that don't fit in with what I learned in 8th grade bio. People say to me that this joke hasn't been funny since 2014 and please at least come up with a new one, but I don't care, I'm hilarious. I'm having a plastic surgeon install Ctrl, C, and V keys on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "epic kek dank meme libs owned with facts and logic" and respect my right to shit up social media. If you can't accept me you're a memeophobe and need to check your ability-to-critically-think privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
---
I like to think that when I’m logged out that’s exactly what’s going on so my shit is ready to go when I log in again
---
Are you seriously crying about Boosh Raven doctrine getting nerfed?  Fuck you.
---
Almost as dumb as your mother's decision to take it vaginally vice anally, you human waste product.
---
Underwhelming is how I best describe it. Rise is bae though, I like that he is at least trying and actually listens to people. I'm going to give it all another few months.
---
I might. I've been known to talk in my sleep.
---
It has two qualities, the Rorq can give great boosts and mine a great amount with Excavator drones. So why not leave the boosts to smaller ships and make the Rorqual just a mining factory.
---
You are highly overestimating our internet out here
---
I'm not you angry little shit lmao, read my other comments. No one uses boosh ravens anymore in any real fleets
---
"if we tell you what we going to do then we cant change and do other stuff halfway.. so we not going to tell you stuff"
---
atlest we getting 100% loot so get the gank alts to jita
---
year after year Devs promise to change, promise to listen, promise to do great stuff but year after year its the same crap - Graphics, Sound, Skins Devs are either unable or unwilling to do what people want. So much has been removed from eve its now a shadow of what it used to be.
---
War Decing Ruined.  
---
Bounties still useless and pointless.  
---
Ninja moon mining gone.
---
There is more but like CCP my attention span is wavering
---
I'll take it. I live in Canada so we won't have to do international shipping
---
Dont hide behind downvotes bitches.  Disagree then man up post counter argument
---
Before I had around 20 seconds to blackscreen off, currently I can count on around a minute.
---
im out of the loop. why is it probably the last?
---
None
---
they are going some where else no more vegas.
---
If you roll into my bear hole I'm also gonna dock up and not undock, like.. Idk what to say, are you talking shit about null people doe docking up their pve stuff?
---
I'm not gonna undock pvp ships through my bear chain unless it's a quick gank, so..
---
&gt;At first glance, one would think that the super fleet was grossly overkill
---
Because it is you dipshit.
---
ah. thanks
---
What if I told you not all ships had to be a doctrine to be used?
---
So you undocked supers matching their numbers and managed to lose half your fleet. Good job, it seems you have some mining to do tho.
---
Eve bet, eve meet, eve down under...
---
I don't think they said anything that carried any weight
---
Def looks like 2009, same one I bought when I started
---
No i'm the captain fuck this game
---
CCP has top notch PR
---
