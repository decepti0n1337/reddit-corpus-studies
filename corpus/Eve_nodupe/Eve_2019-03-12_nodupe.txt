Damn that pos, I hope you murdered it after we left.

That's not Nalia White.

No, it's lime the person running the bot streaming their botting setup.

Second hand information is not very relevant in an investigation when you can't verify its source or authenticity.

Disappointed to see you try and sweep it under the rug manella, especially since you have admitted it as an issue yourself previously.

This is what I do. Sorry. 
---
If you need evidence then go fine it - I don't need it as I have profited from CSM leaks myself.
---
Example from maybe 4-5 years ago - I was emailed and told to build cruisers a few weeks before a major patch.
---
CCP then upped the mats in the ships - Everyone hit reprocess after patch day and made bank.
---
They do. Way more than here. 
---
Imagine actually caring about narrative to shoot shit lmao
---
Well look what we have here, a thread about maidens’ internal corp culture. 
---
I can absolutely confirm this from 3 months of membership, but it’s the kind of bigot friendly atmosphere where everyone tolerates the bigots, laughs along with them but later say they’re tolerant of all people and cultures (“except X, HAW HAW HAW”) and that they infact know a black person so this is all fine.
---
It all depends where you draw the line between "joke" or "bait", and where you have to assume it's actual racism thinly veiled. 
---
When you get the CEO singing along while FCing ops to a discord bot playing Alabama N***, with no provocation or reason to, I think that line has been well and truly crossed.
---
That's basically it, but agent 47 has Hitler attached to his head

TEST players are so dumb that their leaders can have IQs below room temperature and still be the smartest people in the alliance

WTF Hunter, I get back from watching an Indigo White video and I come back to this shit! I love how you can come here and make claims with 0 proof, so stupid! You are probably just mad Ayyle claimed Belle Delphine before you. Fucking loser
---
Alliance leader of the 3rd biggest alliance in the game is crafting a narrative to declare war on the 4th biggest alliance in the game, because he thinks his guys will only show up and fight if they look like the good guys, fighting to save a beleaguered (read: shit) smaller ally, when really they just want to be bad mothers and kill shit.
---
Gian is not actually racist. But the question of optics and offensive language can still be relevant. He has kicked people for being actually racist or actually sexist, I have seen that first hand.
---
In the end, there is no upside to debating this, it is very easy to paint someone as defending racism, so I'll just leave the debate here. My knowledge over several years is that yes, he is deeply offensive. If this is the complaint, sure I will agree with that.
---
Not much you can do other than what you're doing now. Fuck them.

This was one of the things i never expected. When Bjorn gave me the tour back in 2017 we stopped in Selfoss at the place by the bridge and ate about 5 between us.

Ummm askhually vily was already planning to blob China with Russia that’s why legacy has been hyping the NIP ending for the last month and XIX’s ‘invasion’ was conveniently planned for after that arrangement ended 
---
No.
---
While I appreciate the effort that went into writing what you posted, I wholeheartedly disagree.
---
More often then not we fight outnumbered 2 to 1. That's how we like it.
---
These offices should have stayed NPC. I mean WTF was CCP thinking that one corp could reap the benefits from an entire planet or if they had the isk, they could control an entire system of planets or more! Not to mention that it was pretty much a scramble fest to put one up. First come first served, and pretty much everyone coming to this game after has to declare war and destroy custom offices to put one up. At the very least hi-sec offices should be NPC. I don't care about the taxes, I care that it goes to some piss ass corp that just happened to the first to squat their butt down. 
---
Again, provide evidence to internal affairs and we'll look at it.
---
If you want edgy humor to shock the squares then you go DnG. TMOC were pretty much garbage only kept from being the most assholish of Amarr militia corps by the existence of Emperor God Trump. 
---
Generally when someone accuses another person of something, they'll have evidence to back up the accusation.
---
If there's no evidence to back up the accusation other than "I believe that someone did something because something else that might be vaguely connected or similar occurred" then there's not really much to go on.
---
Once again test coming up big to let Init feed our little hearts out and no one will notice

You should immediately approach a mass media outlet and sell your story for big money.

Racial tension is a hot ticket to fame and fortune right now.

Look at this nerd getting all riled up over pretty much nothing. Get creative, start a propaganda war, give us shit if (when) we happen to nake mistakes but there is no need to get personal. I hope this kind of unsporty attitude gets downvoted into oblivion at least.

I find it funny how much you care, but I'll post the full NIP agreement for you so you can read it.

So, the NSA is watching me? Good to know...

I did talk about being in INIT in this very thread. I was also never in tri fwiw. Valk will be along to brag about figuring out who I am any minute now.

fuck off and stop drinking soy retart
---
that being said freedom of speech either exists or it doesn't
---
placing any sort of restrictions on it, infringes on one's right to express himself
---
call it hate speech, trolling etc, those are just excuses to oppress and rightfully deny ones freedom of speech
---
like I said, there either IS free speech, or there ISN'T freedom of speech
---
and what you are advocating for is shutting down freedom of speech using weak offended snowflakes subjective opinions on what isn't ALLOWED to be said, era trying to deny the people their freedom of speech
---
Honestly I used to run 4 clients just fine on some ancient hardware as recently as last year: fx-6100, gtx 560ti and 8gb ram.

If you aren’t using Eve-Hr you aren’t a real corp! ❤️

I like caravans better

lol I always thought you were in Tri.
---
Godwin is dat you?
---
I can neither confirm nor deny that a cash transaction was the basis on which I leaked this.
---
I agree its not to much of a problem when its kept within a community and everyone is in on the joke. IF everyone gets its a joke. Problem is, especially when your group is open to new members somewhat its hard to make sure you dont get people who begin to take it seriously and then spread the cancer. But I get it, I'm in a German corp within an english speaking alliance, there is this prejudice that all americans thing Germans are Nazis so we used to just run with it, got pretty edgy at times. When we grew larger as a community people got offended so we stopped eventually I think. It is a fine line.
---
So let me get this straight, you joined a corp dont like their internal culture and instead of just leaving you bitch about it on reddit is that correct?
---
Based
---
It was put into the treaty that although xix space wasn't explicitly covered under the nip, an attack on them could interpreted as a breach of the nip. 
---
I have him personally marked red.
---
So your idea is to double down on an challenging the dude in a back and forth via reddit as a way to reinforce trust in csm and ccp .. that’s you’re best idea of the day?
---
What exactly is evidence? Demonstrate examples of how evidence in the past has lead to a CSM expulsion for misusing the information. I mean you openly challenged the community for “evidence” now what does that look like.. what’s the framework for that.. where does it get sent? How do we know you followed up on it.. what’s the time scale on that case management...
---
I could go on and demonstrate further that your way let’s to more trust issues and shallow comms.
---
Furthermore you also end up accidentally confirming any and all information you may or may not have delivered to the CSM by engaging ..
---
Basically you break into jail because it’s easy but that’s not the logic trap, it’s breaking out is the real trick.
---
All I am saying is what is your plan beyond arguing with a random dude on reddit about trust ...
---
As that’s immature way of triaging the problem 
---
Here you go Zeroniss, I grabbed the relevant part out so it's easier for you:
---
"-This NIP does not extend to XiX, but any attacks upon XiX will be viewed as attacks on Legacy for the moment and will be responded to in kind up to and including cessation of this deal. This includes their allies as well."
---
You can read the full NIP agreement here, both parties signed this:
---
http://paste.pleaseignore.com/index.php?id=GpCErFSfupmR1MVa
---
Was it ever going to be anyway other than this? It's no coincidence that RUSCO are invading just as TEST NIP runs out. TEST have been planning to do this for months with the russians but they have to sell it as an 'Invasion' so there members help establish yet another botting empire in the East and hold RUSCOs hand through several regions of grinding.
---
Given the level of access to advanced information they have i would have hoped you were continuously monitoring them without having to have had a formal complaint made against them, i guess that is the response people would be looking for here. 
---
But seeing how well botting enforcement goes...
---
So does that mean the extent of your current action will be to shoot at one (1) onlining Fraternity fortizar only?
---
Because that's what a response in kind would be.
---
Thank you :) .
---
Really? I doubt it.
---
Assuming you read the ping that you copy and pasted to Reddit, you already know our response, but I'll repeat it anyway.  We are not responding at all except to reanchor that structure and anchor a few more.  If they show up to kill them again then we will just end the NIP 7 days before it was scheduled to terminate.  It's pretty simple stuff really.
---
Back in the day I heard a word for it: Torfiphobia i.e. the fear of CCP Torfifrans that some merch is not going to be as cool as it could be, resulting in no merch materializing.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/jump/Nomad,544/T-NNJZ:Saminer
---
I found your a way to move your capital force to stain
---
But that's a breach of the agreement.
---
The terms of your agreement are to respond in kind. It's not to frustrate the agreement and throw it out the window. There's no further penalty clause stipulated beyond that.
---
Incidentally you should get me to write your next contracts.
---
Blops is still done because as much as people think meta is king, there's plenty of room for off-meta ships and tactics (they're just not *as*, but still are, effective).
---
Ultimately though Blops are nearly always ineferior to other options:
---
* Carriers are cheaper, insure well, and are far more effective at the cost of slipperiness and range.
---
* Cloaky T3Cs &amp; bombers being bridge are cheaper, more effective and have the same range at the cost of management overhead (need more people and a bridge).
---
The other side of things is that the natural prey of a Blops drop is a snake or other juicy subcap target doing pve. The problem is groups of barges &amp; orcas don't exist now because of rorquals, snakes and other blingy ratters don't exist because carriers and super are better and incredibly common, and DED targets are the as ideal for the reasons another comment addressed.
---
It's still possible - and if you aren't set on super high value targets or willing to be very patient and risk the krab umbrellas, can be reasonably done with a hunter and couple Blops solo, but realistically there's almost always a better option open to you.
---
10/10, best one so far, by a lot!
---
Me and some other logi we’re talking about this the other night. It would be so cool if they would make hull tanking a valid thing. New fleet comps, more options, more guessing how people are ranked. It’s weird that there’s no ships even bonuses for hull reps. You’d think the oneiros would at least add hull to its armor bonuses. 
---
Why do you care?  An in kind response will be whatever the hell they feel is in kind. 
---
What you're saying is basically "this guy made money at around the same time I was robbed". Sure there's a bit of coincidence there, and *maybe* there's correlation. But that is **not** concrete proof.
---
If they are going to start kicking people off CSM for breach of NDA, they need to have something a bit more solid than "this is a bit of a coincidence".
---
That's not how contracts work, my sweet summer child.
---
There's no value in it... when CSM and CCP double down on these threads you end up giving weight to them. "See i got all your attention on my theory"... and then you're doing a back and forth over issues that you both parties really can't prove but always end with "just trust me, i know what i'm talking about" ...which results in both sides lobbying for agreement.
---
Karma kicks in and then ...its rinse/repeat again :)
---
It's time to get off the ride at some point right?
---
Oh I have high respect for your lawyering skills considering how skillfully you handled my trademark infringement case last year (thanks again for that), but we would be breaching if we terminated today.  We are forming the entire coalition on Wednesday and setting the terms of what we consider an escalation against our actions, if they meet those terms then we really have no choice but to interpret their actions as they appear, which means the NIP is pretty meaningless at that point.
---
It's all pretty meaningless anyway considering it's over in 7 days and it appears they aren't very interested in renewing it.
---
The thought is nice, but I don't think it really would make a positive difference in gameplay.
---
A game I used to play was Vanguard (they've since shut the game down). They had attributes like this for every player crafted item. Each item could have different stats and color, which is way beyond what Eve would/could support. 
---
EverQuest did something similar where each player could change the textures and colors of each body part. This caused significant lag on older computer as every time someone showed up, all the colors would need to be downloaded with each packet. 
---
&gt; *But I'm guessing there could be a hundred reasons why it break some market mechanic*  
---
I think it would break stacking of items. Here's a stack of 7 ships made by Bob, an a stack of 3 ships made by Joe. I personally would rather have a stack of 10 ships; I really don't care who made them. 
---
&gt; *and piss off a bunch of people.*  
---
Every other person who would rather have a stack of 10 ships rather than SevenByBob™ and ThreeByJoe®. Don't get me started on ©atalystsBy©harlie.
---
CCP is [LITERALLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPFII3ozSHI) advertising Eve as a F2P game, which is a huge mistake as it only creates misconceptions for new players.
---
On the other hand, the alpha program is defintely created to be more than just a trial program. CCP has confirmed that many times but short-sighted vets like you are typically too clueless to understand that. 
---
That's the first time I've seen that trailer, and it's amazing.
---
Spending your game time in highsec is like going to Disney and only riding it’s a small world. 
---
This is my opinion as a newbie myself.
---
I started off by joining goons, I guess I just didn’t fit in. It’s a HUGE alliance, I felt just like another fish in the pond, people had already built relationships and I felt as if it was harder to communicate with so many people and actually remember who is who, it just wasn’t my type of thing.
---
Then after asking around on Reddit, I discovered Brave Newbies. I did a little research on them and I liked what they stand for, how they’d take on any fight no matter what and they seemed to be well respected.
---
Now brave newbies are by no means a small corporation and they’re in rather big alliance/corporation, but for some reason I felt comfortable with them and so far it’s been good fun, loads of content and people always stop by for a good little fight..
---
I'm the other way around - grew up in Saudi Arabia (expat kid), live in the UK.
---
And then have Hilmar find them
---
It's a pretty safe bet, at this point, that XIX will go crying to daddy test at the slightest sign of resistance. I've seen this first hand not too long ago, when XIX tried to take space from an alliance many times smaller than itself. The had two fleets without backup, and gave up.
---
This is typical for XIX. They rarely ever do the fighting themselves. Even when they were the lords of the dronelands, they would pay others to do the fighting for them. I seriously doubt they even know how to fight anymore.
---
come now babydoll read carefully,
---
"in kind up to and including cessation of this deal."
---
which means their "in kind" can be whatever they feel is necessary.
---
You do understand that 90% of Frat ratters are botting? Get a blue alt in Frat in a cloaky ship and watch the vnis. They warp off 0.01s after a neut comes in local for 8-12 hours a day.
---
Same for skillu renters. They are all botting.
---
So your argument about establishing a botting empire in the East is kinda void. There already is one.
---
what if he's perfectly fine with that outcome, because the end result is the grrgons on reddit stop voting?
---
truth makes for the best propaganda.
---
I don't know how the region is now check feythabolis deployed there for a month and me and friend made 20bil each. It was a year ago so I can't speak on the current state but there were good targets in the area.
---
Race to Bottom.... 
---
Have you seen what it looked like *before* the redesign?! Seriously, the Bantam and Griffin redesigns were acts of charitable kindness that are second only to the work of Jesus himself.
---
This is why you play eve for reasons other than accumulating wealth.
---
Actually an equitable interpretation would only see a like-for-like retaliation fail in the event of contractual frustration; i.e. there isn't a valid EastCo structure to hit.
---
But I think that's largely invalidated; didn't you kill one of their Fortizars in Detorid?  
---
Technically, then, this is EastCo's like for like response, living up to the spirit of the agreement.
---
&gt;Same for skillu renters. They are all botting.
---
We tell everyone to report botters so if they aren’t banned then they can’t be botters. 
---
(KWG LBFB and DV/TKLES renters in Esoteria do the exact same thing lol)
---
nice context
---
Atleast it got a fitting buff no? So you don't have to fit officer/faction torps if you want to solo
---
From my experiance (which is very little as i only know Gian dince he joined provi) being in his fleets, I have never noticed anything racist (maybe he doesnt show it). The only thing that could offend someone, is when he calls himself and other people gay, but its said in such a tone, that its clear its a joke
---
GSF has no nip with Fraternity
---
why would you even use that term.
---
Why would you call this a spin?
---
Frat is shooting an onlining fort in XIX space.
---
TEST is allied with XIX so they try to react.
---
And the NIP even states what happens in an attack on XIX... 
---
Ditto
---
wow Im sorry for your experience my friend. If you need someone to talk to lmk
---
No, we're comfortably sitting at the top of this here well, shouting down good advice like:    
---
"arbitrary market graphs with red arrows drawn on them aren't evidence"    
---
"CCP knows when the CSM was informed about things better than reddit does"    
---
and "bastion didn't kick all renters from fountain you idiots"
---
It's everyone else that's digging through the bottom of the well through willful blindness.
---
Who's agent 42?
---
lmao at this
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
that would be great. I would love to have more information (i dont mind if you wait till its over until you release it)
---
KWG should die in fire. I'm not familiar with the other groups, but if they are botting they are equally bad.
---
I just wish that all the real groups, no matter on which side they are would agree to hunt down and eliminate all the botting fucks. Sadly right now as botters get kicked from one rental group they just join a different one.
---
Agreed.  I still remember this video back when i still played this game almost religiously.
---
sadly, groups and friends have moved on, and i find no joy in the game anymore.  
---
Still fun to see what happens in it though.
---
Just need to get this out so people can know
---
She was mine
---
we're gay
---
Honestly expecting alliances to police their bots and their renters bots is just another example of CCP doing a really bad job. CCP has (or should have) way better tools to hunt bots than players do, but they're trying to make alliances police their botters and their renters botters with way less ability to do so.

Gas mining is a good way to go. Especially because you can do it in cheap ventures or prospects. The only hard part is if you aren’t using it in wormholes, then that might be a lot of back and forth to sell it. I huff gas, but I sell it to corporates in the wormhole. 
---
Don’t mine. Unless you have multiple accounts. It isn’t worth it. 
---
People moved out of low sec into mega null corps.  The targets of opportunity the small gangs used to hunt no longer exists outside of large defense fleets of nullsec alliances.
---
This results in endless reddit whine about solo and small gang being dead because supers drop on them, while they actively and solely go to fight in these areas where supers are ready to drop.
---
There was some fuckery regarding naming conventions of bomber based whaling fleets, people made a lot of memes...

What the fuck did I just read? And can I ever get those 15 seconds back?

Is there a way to import these into my fit storage?
---
I'm curious why you think replacing the fort and basically challenging them to come kill it is not an in kind response. I feel like undoing the damage they did is a minimum response.
---
eve has sound?
---
Sorry, that's not my philosophy. 
---
&gt; Oh I have high respect for your lawyering skills considering how skillfully you handled my trademark infringement case last year

This was sarcasm, btw.

It's a song from the 30s by a white supremacist about lynching black people. I'm not linking it because it's disgusting.
---
Haha it is indeed. On the taisy gate
---
Thank you mate. But uhh you can compare them. See above for example. See you just dont get it. You say it's like comparing apples to oranges. But they can be compared.
---
What's more, you cant really /win/ eve to begin with. It is a sandbox a lot of us play in.
---
Now in a sandbox (an actual one) of a kid builds a castle and says they win. And someone else is upset so they knock it down and say they win. Neither really won... it's a sandbox and there is no endgame of it. But if they both achieved their goals that they set out for than its debatable that they both one.
---
That however does not stop them from being whiny annoying brats. So. There ya have it mate. Your sayings make no sense and your mother is a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries.

---
Do whatever you want, all mining is shit isk/hr/account tho
---
The lack of stacking penalties offsets hull repairing deficiencies.
---
Tldr?
---
Clearly 
---
&gt;that they infact know a black person so this is all fine.
---
LMAO I can't believe people still try to use that to defend their racism. 
---
jesus.
---
now ccp has to amend their shit again.

make it so corp who wardec cannot unanchor structures for 48hr?

Can't you leave AND make other people aware of the issues before they join as well?

&gt;If you want edgy humor

I approve!

So edgy and cool. /S
---
You see comrade, powerful nothern forces of holyness +5 only do those things when CCP says they are ok.  When evil goons of unholyness start using them and CCP say 'no bad stuffs 4 u'.
---
Yeah why speak up against heinous behavior, man? White people could get offended by standing up against them when they call others the n word! /S
---
Frat literally got negwalleted as an alliance for botting, the botting empire is already in the East.
---
Jeveassets has this to a working level of functionality.
---
Is he allowed to speak up against racism because that is free speech too, out are you trying to stigmatize anyone using their free speech against racism? 
---
Checkmate, atheists!
---
Only pulled 10 people from my corp. Demortis isn't trying either. And the interface is like from 2000s.

Totally =). Your knowledge makes me smile. Upvoted :)
---
It really doesn't 
---
Smokes plz, its not about solo and small gang. That type of playstyle isn't even for everyone.
---
I will always recommend a new player to E-Uni before venturing elsewhere because they can at least experience a litte bit of everything EVE has to offer in *all* areas of space so they can find their niche on their own. If they like big bloc warfare, fantastic. If they like exploring, great. If they like highsec mining, great. 
---
I feel like we've had this conversation before.....
---
Its a great way to get around an agreement "oh it wasnt us just our friends whom help us from time to time is all"
---
not storage, access and bandwidth
---
I suspect so
---
SHARK WEEK WASN'T LONG ENOUGH.
---
If they anchor them under the test banner it sounds like it definitely would breach the agreement.
---
My personal experience running a crap ton of t3's and t4's was that I died way less running t3's.  I would have to run a lot of t4's to make up for one loss.  So I run t3's in my standard Gila fit and it takes me about 7-8min, sometimes less.  Way better isk for me.  Can't speak about running 4's and never dying.
---
he should aim for c5 and c6 wormholes that  have static c1 or c2 or even c3 statics where chance to find high security hole is better and may take less time than going  throught c6/c5 or c6/c6 chains.
---
Lel resub nice meme
---
solo mining only gas in c5 c6 space   gas in c1 c2 waste of time,same for  c3/c4 space.  if u must  suck gas  look for shattered wormholes  that often have lots of gas..

Use a T3 Destroyers.  I use a Svipul and sig tank level 3 and 4 missions.  Cheap hull compared to other fits out there.

No speed penalty like armor tanking and full utility mids for webs etc unlike shield. Hull tanking is it’s own thing.Buffing it would make it op in my opinion
---
look at your screen
---
wtf why!?
---
Don't mine vanilla ore. Get yourself out a quiet lowsec or NPC null area like Aridia or Venal, anchor an athanor and moon mine. People mainly fight over r64s, there's lots of pretty solid moons out there nobody bothers to mine because :effort:.

One of the downsides of being elected is that, to my job the right way, I have to engage with people who don't like me, won't vote for me, and generally have bad attitudes. It's a necessity, if only to prove to the folks who don't that I'm willing to stand up and fight.

No

Yeah, it would just depend where he lives I guess. OP where do you base out of? HS, LS, NS, WH? My assumption was based out of high sec since new. If you do decide to jump into a wormhole and huff gas be careful. At wormhole gas sites the rats show up sometime after 15min of someone warping to that site. That means: A) When warping to a gas site, consider warping at range because if there are rats there you need to gtfo. B) If there are no rats set a timer for 15min. When it goes off align to where your going to jump away, then as soon as the rats spawn, which can be much later, then jump away.
---
Propaganda wars are a major part of this communities culture. Shit on it all you want. I don't even care.

Small gang blops (and similarly solo blops) is much less common for two main reasons
---
* Targets have changed, Marauders and expensive Rattlesnakes are now VNI's, cheap Rattlesnakes and carriers
---
* T3C HK nerf, this significantly impacted the ability of blops groups to get the quantity of content to satisfy the group  
---
Carriers are still a viable target for blops, though with supers being cheaper than ever and not having a standing fleet of blops we will probably just go for the easy kill.

Another good reason if you like huffing gas you should join a wormhole Corp. when we’re ratting we’ll usually clear the gas site rats too, then all the people can come huff in peace without worrying about the rats dropping.

Oh look a troll post, feel free to prove any of your allegations, because pretty much nothing about your post is grounded in reality. There were a few guys that used the n word loosely however a few people got annoyed by it so everyone was told to cool it down or leave.

If anyone seriously had a problem with any of this, or suspected actual racist or harmful intentions about this, why is there only a post now many months later about it rather than when it was happening?

Could someone elaborate for me please? ... I don't get in-game very often and I'm missing the context of all the sudden CCP Falcon memes.

Yes please just over exaggerate the whole thing, many of those pages were like one or two people spamming it into a channel for some chat bot thing we had on discord (was a self learning thing that tried to form sentences using content from other users) for w/e reason.

You should have tried keeping it to yourself.

Bad attempt by a BL line member to make the corp important for 0.3 seconds again.

i don't think TEST needs more of a reason to go back to war with FRT, we're sad the last war ended.

Did you never play in a sandbox as a kid? 
---
Your mom was still hungover and was dragging ass taking you to the playground, all the kids that got their first took all the fun toys and nice areas of the sandbox. 
---
You could have either: 
---
A.) Found someone who was willing to share (a low tax poco)
---
B.) Kick down the kids sand castle who’s spot or toys you want (Destroy a poco)
---
C.) Kick down the sandcastle that nobody has been near the whole hour you’ve been crying to your mum (Destroy a poco owned by a Corp you’ve scouted and are pretty sure is inactive)
---
D.) Be social and make friends and help them make their castle bigger (Join a Corp with picks) 
---
It’s not difficult. Suggesting the sandbox be removed from the playground isn’t an acceptable option. 
---
&lt;Well now we put your color to the TEST.
---
As ive said in other posts, op clearly doesnt care because this shit was happening months ago, it stopped when people complained and didnt want it anymore, though the “21 pages” thing is overexaggerated

The forum isn't conducive to discussion because there's no balancing feedback loop. There's no downvoting or disliking or karma. Trash posters can just go on ad nauseum as long as they're heedful of the forum rules. The rules themselves are quite oppressive with ISDs censoring heavy-handedly to make sure nobody's feelings will get hurt. Such policies lead to a rash of pedantic forum warrior so studiously bland and tedious to deal with that nobody bothers anymore. 
---
The dynamic non-nested layout of the discussions also means that people end up talking on top of each other and it becomes very difficult to follow a point, especially when browsing afterward.

Depends heavily on the quality of the moon but i'd say 1B isk every six days or so is a rough estimate for something like a 25% pollucite, 25% zircon moon, which is going to be about 1.2 million m3 of ore. It can be more if you mine every single asteroid and/or get higher grade ores. 
---
Use this here to get an idea of ore values: https://ore.cerlestes.de/moon
---
You can expect to mine at least 1 million m3 of ore every week, but it could be more like 1.6 million if you intend to clear the field.

I dont get why this is coming up to be honest, if anyone had any issue with it why are they bringing it up months later when it simply doesnt exist anymore?

Fraternity (winter coalition) started a war against legacy, they called in skillu/volta/tri/panfam to help them, they lost.
---
Legacy made them cede there immensea and tenefiris holdings as well as pay reparations in exchange for not pressing the attack
---
The timing of the truce is coming to an end and frt is calling skillu and panfam to help them attack tenefiris again
---
Legacy is telling them that if they continue the attack they will be forced to respond again. They're forcing frt to make a decision by putting new structures up in the place of the ones that had been attacked. Legacy is telling frt that if they attack these structures the treaty is over, if they don't it'll be over in a few days anyways, so none of this really matters but legacy wants to make clear that they're being forced to end the agreement early because frt is breaking it
---
I don't think there actions matter much, legacy has a reputation for following through with the agreements they make, frt has a reputation of breaking agreements they make. For instance, just before they lost the war against legacy they broke an agreement they had made with xix. This was one of the reasons xix didn't want to be directly included in the agreement, they didn't trust frt to keep their word after just breaking it, and also why the reparations were so high and upfront, legacy couldn't expect frt to keep their word and continue making their payments
---
That’s literally how Frat tried to get around it via Skill a few weeks ago.
---
Hey, dumbass, no where did we say we were doing anything or attacking anyone. This was a wakeup call to get stocked up, moving around, and shaking off the rust because our buddies got suckerpunched.
---
Out of all the csm do you see anyone else doing this .. there’s a reason why .. standing up and fighting isn’t the same as winning .. movement doesn’t equal progress ..
---
Just learn to fight the fight that are worth winning and demonstrate evidence of success .. worse case you drag the csm accidentally into the rat hole of information management / integrity issues which will likely fuel more toxicity 
---
Or you leave it run its course .. no ccp / csm comment and nothing is validated or invalidated it’s just a feedback loop of misinformation made by a potential actual player or once upon a time player .. it’s anonymous and no accountability or authority is on this thread .. now you and falcon show up.. we’re off to the races about a topic that simply isn’t easy to prove or disprove other than “fuck you prove it” vs “trust me there’s no issues”
---

Test does not allow botters, and actively awoxes those that are found. If you know of a botter in Test, toss me the intel.
---
By the same token, go fit a hull tanked megathron with reinforced bulkheads and notice the lack of a need for hull reppers. Hull tanks, when done correctly, give you that surpise factor when it doesn't die as fast as you thought it would. It serves its purpose without the need for a repper imo. 
---
Make the gate between Saminer and T-NNJZ, its already the only entrance point via JF so make a gate there to allow better projection and more utility to the region.
---
Again that depends on how much you can mine in an hour/how many accounts you have etc. A short 6 day cycle field, can be anywhere from a few hours to say, 12 hours with 4 or 3 accounts. You have 48 hours to mine the field after it pops before it disappears so you can mine half in one day and half the next no problem.
---
I would suggest that you need at least 2 covetors mining, preferably 3, + either an orca (if safe) or porpoise. Eventually, you may want to train for a Rorqual though. Max Rorqual solo can do it in like an hour and a half probably, so once you get one you can set monthly instead of weekly extraction cycles.

If you can run 4's without dying (any decent and well piloted gila fit can) 4's are better. The important thing is to know when you can reach the extra extraction sites and when it's more efficient to just ignore them and go to the next room. The big isk comes in short bursts when you get a lucky skillbook drop or a good BPC etc. but those prices came down fast so the extraction sites are p. important now.   
---
I don't find a huge difference in time between 3 and 4 with a gila but the isk is better over time. If you can find a good firestorm 4 runner that is fast and reliable you can make a shitload of isk because how cheap the filaments are, but that's easier said than done.

Brave is great for fucking around and having fun.  Jumping in standing and gathering a meme fleet, getting blown up but laughing the entire time.

When StratOps are called they can be as serious as any other but still know how to have fun while doing so.  
---
They do frequent classes on activities like ninja  wormhole gas huffing, PI, how to fly X ship/fleet ect or you can suggest something you want to learn and if there is enough interest they'll put together a class. 
---
I was with TEST for a year and a bit and I've been with brave for just over 2 years. I've had so much fun with them and I've learnt so much from them.  Can't recommend them enough.

---
Pred prematurely blew his load
---
&gt; Scout, clear, tractor look, and sell it etc, in 4 hours time
---
That's absolutely slow. Scanning takes about 5-15 minutes unless there are a lot of connections. Tractoring adds about 1 minute per site if you chain anoms together. If I spend 4 hours ratting in a wormhole, I'm spending 30 minutes tops doing the logistics, and the other 3 hours 30 minutes shooting shit.

who cares of something is replaced or not. Losses show weakness, and is filled with shame
---
Bring back clone upgrades, no weapon groupings, and 24 hour skill training queues? Yeah nah.
---
whew. this just goes to show the potential of a NPC null region for mining even without anoms.
---
It wouldn't work.  Blizzard has the ability to roughly control population density by scaling the number of realms.  If playercount drops or rises they simply add or remove instances of the world to keep population density optimal.
---
Eve cannot do that.  If Eve Classic opened up most people couldn't handle the workload of two Eves, and the population density on both servers would be worse than it is now.  Density is important for Eve, as a vacant eve would be a boring game.  We need more concurrent online players, not half.
---
I think Eve is Just too niche for that to Work. 
---
Would alot of Players Return? Yes. Would it outweigh the Split of the Community? Probably not.

No, but there's literally 240 blue loot NPC buy orders. Unless you're wormhole diving in sovnull, it's very rare to be more than a few jumps from a buyer.

Mm oh yeah split the already small player ase, what could go wrong?

Depends who they are renting from, if its goons then they don't even need to loose anything. automatically assume they are a bot. if its from NC/PL they could loose hundreds, but couldn't possibly be bots, because as we all know, NC/PL are honorable and completely bot-free, which includes their renters.

not losses is opsec activity, get with the game boi
---
Horrible anology, but nice try. We have NPC stations don't we? You don't get to pick and choose what's okay for one and not the other. Players have a choice with stations... use NPC, use a corps, or build your own. Hmmmm... seems odd it's not that way with custom offices. Don't it?

Couple of factors at play here.  First being Stain is NPC null in it's entirety.  Most null space is controlled by player alliances, and the regions that do have NPC controlled space aren't even the whole region, for instance only 12 systems in Delve are NPC owned and the rest is sov.  The interesting part of NPC null is it allows smaller groups to have a secure place to dock up, and make null more accessible for the "little guy".  NPC regions have agents that give lvl 4 burner missions, one of the more profitable activities in the game, and also have NPC seeded market orders for things like selling blue loot from wormholes, and buying skillbooks.  Stain is also the third largest region in space, and the largest nullsec region in terms of number of systems.  This again allows smaller groups to carve out their own corner for fun and profit.  As it is right now (and forever because it will never change) there are only 3 entrances, Venal by comparison has 10 (granted none of them are from lowsec regions either, and curse (which is barely 1/3 the size of stain) has 7, and one of them is a lowsec connection only 2 jumps from hisec.  Currently the only way in or out of stain is through 1 of 3 systems that can be and are camped a lot of the time, or wormholes, or Jump Freighter routes that travel through very busy sovereign regions.

And TEST supports the biggest RMTer in Eve history: UaXdeath, who TEST helped prop up for 2+ years in the East before leaving them out to dry.

Though if history is anything to go by, TEST will announce their support for XIX and then leave the Russian super fleet to get mowed down in a neo-futurist Stalingrad for the second time.

Stain is legit great to stage roams from. So many good regions nearby, it's just the logistics which are a real pain.
---
If people always got shat on, then they stop roaming there. Your story doesn't add up.

Because evidence of goons doing what goons do in every game is needed... the actions are evidence enough and they have been for years, yall just ignore it.  You want recordings of private channels on teamspeak of them sharing intel...  not possible. You have evidence in front of you, it's also simple as putting in fake info and seeing how people react... tell them mass nerfed to x type ships, watch who responds....

So ninja gas harvesting gets around 30-50mil/site, at 15-20 min/site, not including scanning/logistics etc. I have done backpacking trips, where you take a miasmos (gallente industrial) a depot, and a venture on an alt. The venture scans and huffs, then deposits ore into depot. Once depot is full, safelog venture and transfer to miasmos. That way you have a max of a depot and venture when you’re huffing. Scan a hisec and make courier contract to jita when you get nervous having so much in gas
---
Yes. There is nothing you can drop on with blops anymore. VNIs gilas etc are not worth the time and will escape more often than not. Rattlesnakes are quite rare now with carriers taking over for them. Carriers are very common and can't be killed by blops safely. The only option left is miners, and outside of umbrella regions where there are nothing but rorqs there are extremely sparse and usually on an athanor grid (which can kill you effortlessly). And you will be counter dropped by a carrier 90% of the time which is half the price, insures well, and will volley you.
---
Solo carrier is the way to go if you want to solo hotdrop now. Solo dread ganks is an option as well if you don't mind welping sometimes because siege stronk.

Right between Stain and the nearest lowsec system is the "Vapor Sea" as shown in following diagram:
---
https://i.imgur.com/TVhTOlx.png
---
The "Vapor Sea" is described:
---
"Vapor Sea, also known as Crib of Stars, is a melding pot of gaseous clouds where new stars are being born. Although new stars and solar systems are still millions of years away the area is of great interest to scientists. The lack of gravity wells makes it impossible to create stargates anywhere near the area."
---
This is surely why there is no gate here.

IMHO, this is one of the EVE trailers that stands the test of time (even if the graphics are a bit aged).  The Junkie XL track is matched very well with the visuals.  When I think of EVE propaganda, this video is always at the top of the list.   This audio track has actually survived the test of time from my first ipod up to my latest smartphone.   
---
They didn't say that though and if they did say it then you ask the question "Well if you don't tell them about this stuff, why not? ..what do you tell them...what else you holding back" and then that door stays open until you've exhausted the "CSM is totally useful" Yes/No answer...

We'll you'll find out the net results of your efforts in the next elections i guess...  in PR you learn quickly to let the conversation take its course, and then if you want to demonstrate the inaccuracy you fight the fight on your own battlegrounds not theres.

We have majority of the threads on reddit right now mocking Falcon by way of Photoshop and you're arguing the toss on content quality and moderation skill levels right now :)
---
I love reddit for what it is.. dumpster of unedited raw thinking... like or hate it, however there is a clear bias at times when the meta of eve gets involved... eg. Shit on Goons for example you will get downvoted... praise goonse you get upvoted... we've all tested that theory and its a repeatable experiment... and once you understand how the mechanics of this reddit work you soon learn to game it...
---
Just... CCP... stay on your own website and argue points there... you retain the control of your brand and messaging better and it creates a link back or feeding behaviour you want over long term ...

He should know by now the only things TEST are any good at is internet lawyering and batphoning mittens.
---
&gt; Currently the only way in or out of stain is through 1 of 3 systems that can be and are camped a lot of the time
---
If I'm not mistaken there are other choke points that restrict access to certain constellations as well - if we start to argue that accessing Stain needs to be less dangerous, wouldn't that same argument apply to those other systems as well?
---
All these camped systems provide content for certain types of players. Allowing access to Stain through a different route would reduce the amount of content for these players?
---
I'm not saying there shouldn't be any changes - but people complain about lack of content all the time, I'm not sure taking away gate camping is a great idea? Besides, a new connection would still allow for gate camping - so in the end, gate campers will still be an issue and other routes will have to be taken into consideration?
---
I don't see how this changes much if camped systems are the main concern here.

What's with all the CCP falcon memes?

This is the trailer that introduced me to EVE, it came on the free CD of a game magazine bought at my local bookstore, started my account a week or so later...**nostalgia intensifies**
---
5200 bans per year means about 14 bans per day. Which is nice, but there are hundreds of new accounts per day. Would you be willing to share graph comparing banned accounts &amp; new accounts trends for a longer duration, at least to before alpha accounts?
---
They do lol
---
Sorry if this sounds snarky, but what I learned from other posts on reddit: No one wants EVE to be fair. Everyone wants others ppls multibillion-assets to be killable by them at will.
---
Oh you poor soul,  mean Internet guys spoke the forbidden words and hurt you. Please leave the Internet.
---
How did Amarr accept Gallente Erebuses? Aren’t they like.. enemies?
---
&gt;When the response is the rorq slapping its invuln and lighting its cyno for a dozen fax and supers, its not valid content for big gangs either.
---
Yeah, that is exactly what I m saying: A Rorqual is no valid target for a small gang. As almost no Capital ships should be unless flown by a lobotomized monkey or the small gang having some really good tricks up their sleeve. And thats it. vOv
---
This is the meme we deserve.
---
Yeah and the northern entities didn't facilitate anything. Ok
---
I feel you, op (former maiden here, left for the same reason). It’s true that you get a warning during recruitment that the corp culture is toxic, edgy, anti-snowflake and whatnot, that TMOCC is (was?) proud of that, and that you shouldn’t join if you have a problem with it. I can live with that. What crossed a line for me was one member explaining in long details why he and his whole family genuinely hate black people. This itself might be an isolated incident and the dude eventually got kicked at that point nobody on comms seemed to mind it enough to speak up. Content was great (was before the move to Provi) and there definitely are some very good guys in the Alliance that I still enjoy to hang out and fly with, but that sealed the deal for me. 
---
For the other commentators demanding freedom of speech: taking issue in blatant racism within a group and making said concern public, is exactly that. Nobody is requesting a ban hammer or other censorship. If you want to go full retard under the protection of free speech then accept that people complain about it under the same principle. 
---
If you want you can drop me a mail ingame or on reddit and i can give you a detalled run through.

Use the above website + your skills and m3/hour mining to determine your ISK/hr.   
---
You keep asking for the "isk/hr" as if it's a number that someone can just pull out and say "you will make X million an hour doing this". But it doesn't work that way. It depends on your skills, how many accounts, how safe the area is (do you dock up a bunch?), whether or not you're using Covetors, proc's, etc.   
---
"I make almost a bil an hour mining Spod/Gneiss in null" means nothing without the context of: "with 6 rorquals".

Sry

Temp ban all players who participated in this facade.

it’s not mockery, dude made a funny face and people are making memes which he himself seems to enjoy by his responses. 
---
FYI, if you don't log out while Omega expires, it doesnt expire till next DT. Because that is when it forces you to log out. 
---
Havent actually tested if you train x2 speed but at least it appears so according to UI. And you can fly omega ships and train omega skills during this time. 
---
So, protip, buy omega right After DT, stay logged in for "last" day till next DT and you get 23+hours of omega for free / month. Assuming you dont lose connection / servers dont crash.

It would end like every classic server. Starting with high numbers and then be deserted within months when the players realize that you can't bring back the old vibes with old game mechanics.

I meant mocking as in "make a replica or imitation of something." ..there are two definitions of that i guess i overlooked the "scorn / teasing" ... but in my defense in design world we often say "can you mock a version of that up please"

It’s good isk. Not great. It’s a middle-ground between regular ore mining and high-level gas harvesting. About 30-40 mil per hour with a barge. 
---
The problems with ice mining are that the ice disappears very quickly especially in populated systems, and mining barges that aren’t procurers/skiffs frequently die to catalyst gankers who know where the ice belt is and when it will be spawning. 
---
If you can find a quiet system with an ice belt (easier said than done) then you can make some pretty easy isk. 
---
An added bonus of ice belt systems is that they usually have tons of refineries all doing moon mining (if they are 0.5 sec anyway). You can fly a frigate or shuttle from moon to moon and bookmark the refineries that are either close to blowing up a moon chunk or have done it already. Moon mining is very profitable as well. 
---
Another rookie, huh? My IGN is Rosei Vei if you ever need a sidekick that knows as much as you do haha
---
&gt;We are null dwellers so be warned lol
---
See, I don't exactly get this part. Still gotta understand what every aspect of the game implies. I know what null-sec is, but why should I be cautious about a corp that dwells there lol?
---
This is some die hard level shit. Bruce is that you? 
---
With nullsec, there are some special general rules. More so than anywhere else, pvpnis consented to upon undocking. If your undocked every enemy has the right to engage you. With any null sec group worth its salt normally has fleet participation of some kind and Mics and external forum services such as seAT are required. And the biggest part, it will ruin you toward high sec life lol. But in 7 years I've found the null sec life to be the most rewarding and fun.
---
&gt; Why would you call this a spin? 
---
[Because the story has been written already](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/arbchv/breaking_news_mad_russians_going_to_evict/egm76xj/).  XIX will attack FRT.  XIX will fail.  TAPI will ride to rescue XIX.  There will be some good fights.  Goons will ride to rescue TAPI.  Everyone goes home.  XIX get their space.

No - its just your memory playing tricks on you. Old games rarely live up to our fond recollections of them. The same is true for games like WOW &amp; EVE which have lived for such a long time.

I believe it would be a lot of work for a minority taste - better to focus on the living game.

Hardly.

First of all, mark the fit you want to import into EVE, important here is that you do one at a time.
---
Then open up your fitting window and follow [these](http://prntscr.com/mwnwv9) steps
---
LMOA PEPEGA MONKaS haha
---
No. Your MAC address is not broadcasted beyonf your local network. MAC addresses are also really simple to change.
---
Or you could just run a lot of VMs
---
Could the client just read whatever the current MAC is locally, send it to CCP and compare it with other current clients?
---

Hi Bisu.
---
pls i will behave. 
---
There are groups out there that don't need your help all the time. For example in Factional Warfare (FW) you can just capture systems as a lone wolf and sometimes join your friends to help fight bigger stuff. 
---
Also in Eve you don't necessarily always have to be at the same place with your group and still get huge benefits for being in one. Like you might have someone in corp hauling stuff around for you via courier contracts. Or they might report intel about enemies around you. Or you can just get cool tips from reading their chat. No need to actually even interact with the other players all the time. Of course some corps/alliances demand more and some less.
---
I always thought of hull reppers as refit modules for long trips deep behind enemy lines so to say. It’s always part of my refits whenever I’m going on a trip in my proteus for example. 
---
The clause is dumb, but it's there.
---
This nip doesn't apply to XIX except that it does.  I don't know why it's written like that, but it's valid enough.  Frat could have called that out when they signed it if they wanted to.
---
Not true, I even recommend your corp to those returning to the game. Check my post history if you doubt that. But for a pure newbie I will always recommend the Uni.
---
Upvoted for CCP visibility

Meta 4 teiracide is no joke
---
Lab rule #1 Don't lick the spoon
---
Find some moon rocks, ideally a friendly Corp that can't mine fast enough. Otherwise ice mining is better than normal ore. Get a procurer, don't use a retriever (suicide gankers). Low sec has better ice, but you'd better be on your toes and in a venture 
---
I'm oldskool and I liked that kind of corp culture. Made Eve feel more cutthroat-space-violence-simulator and special among other MMO's. And made the characters feel more real and not NPC's. It was like playing Lars von Trier space game instead of Disney space game. House that Jack built instead of Aladdin.
---
Those are snuff titans, all of them are enemies

&gt;And from the chatlogs posted, one happens to be the current CEO...
---
You are an alt, stop spreading lies on reddit please.
---
If your character has received isk from another character, it looks like some guy who is sending isk to his alt. Or something else that's gone like that.

I haven't received ISK from anyone else but I do have quite a bit myself from selling PLEX. I have been handing out ISK to people that have helped me learn but I haven't gotten any myself.
---
Yeah, that's a route I haven't gone down yet.
---
My only issue is that they felt a little disorgansied in terms of content
---
I feel bad for falling for that one :(
---
This begs for a TRON MCP version
---
$10 + $347.99 shipping
---
Aye, and as I've said plenty of times, I'm not proud of the things we said on comms, and looking back it was a stupid an immature phase that should never have happened, which is why we implemented a 0 tolerance to this sorta stuff months ago (which is why I was confused that this post was made now, when everything is resolved and this doesnt happen anymore) and haven't had any of this sillyness every since.
---
It's about that face falcon had on one of the ads on the new launcher except because everyone is a kind of pussy currently IG and the balance / meta isn't help, everyone has nothing better to do that to make repetitive somewhat funny picture rather than look at themselves or CCP to fix shit up.
---
Is it any good?
---
You seem to be quite butthurt about this issue...
---
I am sorry to hear ypu've had a rough time with the applications.
---
Pandemic Horde are perhaps not the most organized bunch but they do have a very large organization. I'd say if the other ones seem like they are too paranoid, give them a try. Will be useful to get some experience under your wing and I think it will make joining new corporations also a bit easier.
---
It is a bit disheartening to hear though. Why not give r/evejobs a try first, could find a nice corp, or the official forums.
---
I dont think you in the loop. Need to listen to the AT podcast done by Talking in station.
---
^(if shipping is outside Iceland cost can be higher) 
---
couldn't decide which one [https://i.imgur.com/mMob5JA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/mMob5JA.jpg)
---
Ah, i think you found the reason. They can see the transactions and think you already have ton of isk farmed with some other char. 
---
This is one of those cases, where being the good guy definitely commes back to bite you in the ass. :(
---
Thanks mate, I'll make a post over on /r/evejobs and see what I can find there. If not, I'll check out the Forum too.

In the meantime I'll look into some more info regarding PH.

Mac is only a unique identifier within your local network. Someone in the next town over might have the same mac as you
---
How would I go about that? I'm not sure what Biomass means
---
I fail to see the connection between die-hard pvp/being oldskool/black metal and racism. But maybe that’s just me.
---
Good to hear. Seriously. 
---
This is actually a good one :-)
---
how many AU's does your Falcon[millenium edition] get? 
---
replace that ballon w/ some CCPromises like Logi on killmail and you have me 
---
Biomass is selecting your character from character select screen and pressing red X in top right corner of that profile. Youll lose all items, isk and skillpoints, as far as I understand, everything.
---
Aye, we put a hard stop to it and it's never come back up again since, which is why I was confused with this thread being made months after it stopped as opposed to when it was prominent.
---
No. Dedicated hypervisor/vm server performs a lot better
---
multibox dating sites... what a time to be alive 
---
Oh...
---
I think if it came down to that honestly I might not bother with it. I've enjoyed my time spent so far but if being nice to people in this game has somehow screwed myself I'll probably just end up making that mistake again.
---
Ah well
---
I think deleting your character would be the wrong idea. I don't think a new player should have to do that to be accepted as a real person. There are corps out there that will accept you and you can build a good reputation over time by being an active player.
---
Logging in an alpha account next to an omega just works, no tricks needed, no warning given. Logging lots of alphas too.

It was supposed to be fixed August 2018 but still isn't
---
It's not allowed in EULA but why isn't it fixed? Why does it appear to be enabled?

Has there been any updates on CCP's stance on this since August?
---
Has anyone been banned?

If no to both does that mean it gets a blind eye turned to it?

They are disorganized, but they get a lot of content. The more fights you are in the more you will learn and the better you will get.
---
duties?
---
if you join pandemic horde, or any of the hisec mining groups for instance,
---
you can easily go for as long as you need doing your own thing. unless you class saying hello, or acknowledging the other people when your online a duty. its a pain for everyone at times, social demand of 'convosations' scary stuff!
---
you dont make clear sence in what you want, what it is you 'cant deal with' or why playing alone in eve is not a straight easy choice for you.
---
This is because plex is cheaper when you buy more at once
---
Why dont you try joining eve uni? Been a while since I played this game, but they are one of the best ways to actually learn it. Assuming your not an alt. btw trying to jump into a major nullsec alliance after having only been in the game a month and I assume not knowing anyone irl? you just look like a spy. fullstop. Sorry dude, thats not the way to do it. I wouldnt have taken you on either. You need to make some friends man. also learn the game, cos I promise you with just one month? you dont know the game.
---
Could you PM me your timezone, and any other stuff like what do you look for in corp. I'm in small null alliance and we might take you if our corp is something you are looking for
---
It would probably take some more time convincing/proving it to people. I can ask in my corp (Imperial Guardians), and alliance (TNT) what their stance is about it, prehaps link this topic for them to see if you are interested.
---
How possible is it to use isk to buy Plex for omega?
---
Took me a second, bahaha.
---
Why would TEST need help against FRAT/skillu/ elo?
---
Maybe that is something I should look into. I just kept seeing all these places saying "Newbie friendly" and so on and assumed it would be safe to join them. 
---
I might start looking towards a smaller corp to just mess around with for a while.
---
No it doesnt make sense that the same amount of ISK is worth a different amount of rl-currency.
---
You might have misunderstood it, Im not comparing the two killmails which each other, but the the destroyed and total values of both.
---
The second killmail is just to show, that there obviously is something off
---
Surely that can’t possibly be true, given sandboxing in this instance runs a single operating system, and using VMs requires an OS instance for each one?
---
What timezone are you guys mainly in? Feel free to link the topic anyway, it would be good to understand what's happening from the perspective on a recruiter.

US/EU (most fleet events are in the 18:00 - 2:00 Eve timefrme). I will link it to my corp, if for nothing else, then to get their view.
---
riding the line is one thing, doing something that's been declared an exploit for 5+ years and everyone knows is against the rules is another
---
Thank you mate, it's no bother if it doesn't work out. Just more perspective on it would be nice. 
---
first CSM, then CCP. next: the world, galaxy, universe.
---
Different taxes and bonuses are applied upon cashout.
---
When you lose a shiny pod in Delve, you need to pay an additional ~3 USD. This way we can remember and honor the mentality of the late Mordus Angels alliance.
---
When you lose a pod in wspace, you get a discount of ~1 USD from CCP. This is to incentivize people to live in wormholes and to make them forgot that they are just collaterial damage.
---
Hopefully the 64 bit client helps
---
Also: It is about the difference on the SAME killmail.
---
has maybe, due to your experience in applying, lead to them thinking your an alt? (because you know the drill and know what they want to know already)
---
are you actually an alt using reddit to get in somewhere? :D
---
That is so fucking good
---
Yes
---
Did you bug report, from in client?
---
thank you. My corp leader thought your fits were sick. xD
---
Yep. There are some other hardware identifiers which might be viable to use, but they're all a bit iffy. 
---
Nice to hear, feel free to hit me up on pms aswell if you guys need fits or anything
---
A lot of people are going to turn the video off at the cyno kills part, meaning they might miss good fights later
---
Quality over quantity 
---
The fuck have you been smoking OP?
---
  Eastern Co attack an XiX fort- They broke the contract
---
  &gt;"-This NIP does not extend to XiX, **but any attacks upon XiX will be viewed as attacks on Legacy** for the moment and will be responded to in kind up to and including cessation of this deal. This includes their allies as well."
---
  Whinge about the deal all you like, but eastern co *agreed* to it. 
---
"How dare Legacy respond by UNDOCKING SHIPS!"
---
Every major coalition has agreements and NIP's with other groups- It's all part of the sandbox. GOTG have agreements with PANFAM etc, this is nothing new.
---
To think something this small is making you REEEE so much
---
You should be laughing at the eastern co for *agreeing* to the clause that an attack on XiX is an attack on Legacy, but ok.
---
I don't think it does. I'd left cap management V training when my sub expired for a month, still had about 3 days when I came back recently. 
---
B8
---
Cool. May we start killing shit already? TAPI salt mining best mining
---
I always thought MAC address were supposed to uniquely identify NIC. I mean they can be spoofed, and reading up on it, it seems some companies are doing dodgy stuff like reusing old ones or stealing some from other companies. But I thought the intent was that they should be globally unique.
---
How are they disorganized compared to any other nullsec alliance? The fact of the matter is that all null alliances which accept new players are identical these days except for PvE. Maybe, MAYBE in horde you stand a little higher risk of being awoxed than somewhere like test, but it’s absolutely trivial to roll a new alt, do a few days of missions, and get a spy booshed. 
---
0 *2 = 0      huh.
---
To be fair, the OP is in NC, and LadyScarlet hates PvP
---
&gt; We have majority of the threads on reddit right now mocking Falcon by way of Photoshop
---
I have zero problem with this.
---
This is a gaming community, gaming communities have a bit of fun sometimes memeing and having a laugh.
---
Why do you hate fun?
---
I think you misunderstood what I wrote
---
This needs to happen. And everybody should bring that shirt to evesterdam
---
Honestly, my claims are only based on a short amount of research and just the way things seems structured  in PH, I guess they just feel a little less rigid then the likes of Goon or TEST. Especially in terms of just accepting any ole joe. Maybe I'll find my luck there however. 
---
Also, what does awoxed mean? 
---
hahaha... christ
---
This might be my favorite so far haha
---
/u/Jibrish ...I am your father. &lt;3
---
Holy shit.
---
Wew lad
---
Is it your intent to just make the brand crash and burn or is their a strategy behind this .. you reply to a unsubscribe thread with “I like the attention”
---
As your actual response
---
Fuck it .. let the eve world burn 🥳🤯😂
---
Try disabling the sound device drivers and enabling them, and compare the fps.
---
Don't worry mate, most people won't ever find that connection because it doesn't exist... well, unless you are a racist piece of shit I guess.
---
Yeah the whole brouhaha over this is laughable
---
The "even bigger kid" doesn't break diplomatic agreements, so not sure where you get that.
---
More likely it will be free-for-all with Imperium +TEST + BRAVE vs Winter Co (Frat and close allies) vs Horde + PL vs North vs Lowsec Corps vs random collection or even unified front of wormhole corps. Whole server is waiting for this war. Its gonna be a bloodbath. And it will be glorious.
---
I'm part of goonswarm, I build a rorqual 2 YEAR BEFORE THE RORQ BUFF !!!! CSM leaks btw
---
lol, Vily
---
I know that the pvp-loving veteran in you is laughing about all this hurrdurr before some good shitshow - but that the armchair general in you screams "casus belli!" to TAPI grunts who don't get that it's all just a game.
---
.. would get shit on by a mach fleet.
---
Yeah supers are strong. But they still need support, let's be real.
---
Less than currently (and let's just say the current amount of supers being caught and killed is way too low) and remember that you wouldn't be able to light a cyno to kill such a super (or to save it for that matter but I'm mostly concerned with the attack and not defence).
---
Isn't this a very well known issue? How does bug reporting it yet again help solve it?
---
You can setup one and make extremely good profits. You just have to have people to fight the lowsec superpower that took all of them. 
---
&gt;\&gt;Tuskers win AT 2022
---
oof
---
Yeah isn't that the question everyone's asking but no-one really knows.  Why indeed do they?
---
I always thought players get negwalleted, corps and alliances don't.
---
Awox means you’ve intentionally been killed by someone in your corp/alliance (I think this also extends to other blues but someone will have to fact check me there)
---
Why would it matter, because in a week's time TAPI would be attacking FRT anyway.

but i case of W we lost expensive revelation. praxis easier to replace

The *symptom* is well known (disconnection from the chat server.
---
The cause, not so much. Because they've already fixed a whole bunch of the causes (which is why the server is a lot more stable these days). but there's obviously some issue still lurking and biting some people.
---
Assuming that someone else has bug reported an issue which you're experiencing is generally a poor idea. More reports is better than no reports.

For sure man, I honestly thought of that after uploading....next one I'll just do more straight pvp vids. Thanks for looking!

Failed tapi meme Corp now most famous for harboring botters tries to save face with shitpost on /r/eve 
---
No that's actually me. 
---
The eve website does 1 month for $4.99 sometimes, so log into the website and see if you have that offer! The website also has some other offers under DLC, which are good value. Otherwise it's $9.99 a month on the website
---
I always see people buying 500 plex in game for like $17.99 and buying omega with it, without realising they could have saved $8 by just buying the 1mo sub on the website
---
Or ask in Pandemic Horde Corp Chat how to join Goons. You will get help.
---
But, but, but "CAPITALS ARE OP BROKEN REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Or something :p
---
definitely the best one so far!

if you want to go for legacy, pick goons, because its better to be the masters than the pets.

Its not like its harder to get in

Lol. They literally don’t. They throw billions of isk at us and lose it and get nothing in return. Pro tip, don’t drop dreads if you don’t have an escalation. 
---
Dreddit is newbro friendly but not a newbir corp per se. Brand Newbros (NWFLT) is the comparable newbie training corp in TEST
---
Thousands.
---
k
---
Surprisingly accurate
---
yeah just make a post on reddit saying you arent an alt, making noise, dont know what to do, and someone will give you a vouch into goons no worries.

Pandamic dishonored a frig memorial fleet for a Snuff member that died with a anti-frig fleet. Just sayin'.

I accidentally logged an Alpha and Omega yesterday and was denied.  Just lucky I guess.

You're spot on.

Ya I mean I was just trying to provide insight on the whole stainguy thing, thats all.
---
Nullsec alliances accept people into newbie friendly corps with less than a month of game time all the time, hence the term newbie friendly. No idea what that guy is talking about.
---
Out of curiosity what alliances have you tried to join? Have you tried explaining why you have the ISK that you have?
---
They have killed some nice stuff, plus test arent the best small-scale minded people, so you always get idiots feeding them kills.
---
Goon, TEST so far plus some minor alliances and even smaller Corps
---
Honestly, until now I had no idea that would be the issue and nobody asked me where I got it from, if they did I would have been more then happy to let them know I bought PLEX 
---
What is this "glitch" that I see on the map? Looks like a bridge between U-HYMT and R3-K7K near Providence. It's always there on the map, and I assumed it was a rendering artifact, but maybe not?

On another note, even you have to see how awesome that picture of you is. If I had such an awesome picture of me I'd make it my profile picture on literally everything. OWN IT MAN! :)
---
I think that with the new minimum requirements, you would need a computer that most players don't use in order to make it a viable solution.
---
Buy 2 of the parts, and make 1. Also select P4 that has 3 P3 parts rather than 2 P3 and a P2. This way you can use a load of toons and you only have to train the planet scanning nonsense on one. It is not needed for factory planets. Also be aware of your costs moving items on/off of planets, and the tax on the damn POCOs. If you own them or your corp does, zero tax makes sense because they take no fuel and cost nothing to hang in space. 
---
Wows, the Red Dwarf feel goods nostalgia I just had from that, ty.

CCP Falcon really should re-brand to CCP Holly lol

Maybe it's time to admit that the multiboxing meta is fucked?

Haha this is just brilliant! Make it happen!

Hmm... I know I miss a lot of things but why is this news? Did they only have the one? Definitely time for more action around here.

I've discovered with very few exceptions that you can very easily tell what sort of person someone is IRL by how they act in EVE Online. People think there's a separation of personas when, really, there actually isn't.

Gating a jump capable ship and not paying attention to intel
---
How is this a problem when everything gets erased when you close the sandbox? You'll be installing everything from scratch every time just to launch an alpha account?
---
Is there a "Plz no implants rule"? If so, that sounds pretty fun. 
---
Wokka Wokka!
---
Slightly over 12 parsecs
---
It might require separate OSs but virtualized systems running on server hardware will run more like bare metal systems, especially with proper GPU pass through
---
While it was very possibile a while back, the PLEX prices are quite high as of right now and you need to invest quite some time to achieve the current price (1.9bil as of right now). It is possibile with exploraiton or Incursions for example (or fairly High Skill L4 Security Blitzing), so it depends heavily on the time you have on your hands and what you plan on doing to afford the PLEX
---
Join Brave Newbies. They are a fun bunch that will teach you a lot about the game like how to survive in Null and how to make money down there too. They are also friendly when it comes to creating content and they allow you to take out your own fleets!
---
I might look at this, thanks mate!
---
Also if you wanna get a taste of fleet PvP look for an NPSI group. Spectre Fleet is very good. I FC for them and they have been the most fun I have had in the game since taking out my first kitchen sink fleet of 60+ people back when I was in Brave.
---
about programmers sound silly because you can make a bit more money doing remote work, average english skill is enough

We don't need a casus belli to invade frat..we've all been foaming at the mouth for this for the last 6 months. If anything, most people never wanted the temp treaty with winter co. 
---
Who did we AWOX?
---
Looks really good! May I ask what software you are using?
---
I came across this \[1\], regarding bumping JFs when they land on a gate. Is this still valid / working?
---
If I understand correctly, as soon as the JF tries to jump, he breaks the 'out of warp' invulnerability, and in the second / tick it takes for the server to actually process the jump request, you can bump the JF far enough, so that it's not in jumping range.
---
Is it possible to similarly bump a JF out of docking range after it jumps to a cyno, when the JF clicks "Dock" and breaks jump / system change invulnerability.
---

an angry mob of more than 2,000 people had gathered to vent its rage, smashing cars and chanting: "We want fairness. There is no fairness if you do not let us cheat."
---
Pretty much sums it up
---
How long respawn is now?
---
What's the spectre fleet channel these days, it changed a while back didnt it? I was looking for it qhwn I was between corps a few months back :(
---
&gt; it motivates people to get into afk VNIs which is indistinguishable from botting.
---
Ahhh, not completely true. AFK VNIs at least run the risk of dying semi-often to random roamers whereas bots are very safe (there are only a few people with the patience to hunt bots, it's a huge pain in the ass).
---
&gt; TEST will announce their support for XIX and then leave the Russian super fleet to get mowed down in a neo-futurist Stalingrad for the second time.
---
TEST posting was just the best that day. :ok_hand:
---
Sounds like a diminished incentive to train into and obtain a super now, if they are less viable for PvE.
---
WTB Hel, 8b. 
---
WinterCo can't beat a group of russians (lol what) and calls panfam to help (skillu and bl isn't enough). It's ok.
---
Russians can't do anything against 3 or 4 alliances. OMFG XIX ARE SO PATHETIC. cry me a river, skillu underdog
---
&gt;You have all been sitting with your thumbs up your ass complaining about highsec brawls not being big enough. Well now we put your color to the TEST. We didn't even fill a fucking capital fleet.
---
Why do people play this way?
---
The introduction of dark blood titans / dreadnoughts to havens and sanctums on top of the previous 10 minute respawn time killed off smartbomb ratting as far as i know.
---
Sanctums and havens are 12minute respawn now.
---
Forsaken hubs were 6 minutes before patch now they are 9 minutes i think?
---
what were the respawn rates before dt?
---
I’m glad you are one of the few people who knew i was being facetious. 
---
So the PanFam Supers finally can log back ?
---
I had an astero Hunter decloak next to me once when I got one of these and he couldn't believe I haven't the can so fast...
---
Ended up getting away from this guy too lol
---
before downtime:
---
Havens 10 minutes
---
Sanctums and all other anomalies 6 minutes.
---
Now: 
---
Havens &amp; Sanctums 12 minutes
---
Forsaken Hubs 9 minutes
---
Didn't check other ones but i heard blood raider ralleypoints (the ones to get 6/10 escalations)  were also nerfed.
---
I'd like to see a proof, zkb links, screenshots, nicknames, anything
---
The $ to ISK conversion is not static, as the price of plex changes in game. Zkill probably pulled new data in the time between the two screenshots of the same kills respectively.
---
Im fine with this, now they can refit supers for combat and move them to staging.
---
Your wife is hoooot. And provocative! Look how much neck she is showing! That hussy.
---
What kind of damage do rats in Angel Cartel 10/10 expeditions deal?
---
Should normally be explosive/kinetic but some people say that other damage types are dealt also. 
---
Is it true?
---
thanks for answering. sanctums really got hit hard. wont affect me much as they dont spawn/rarely spawn where i live
---
XIX could push an 85 man alliance out of their pocket in tenerifis without tests help. 
---
That's a bit different than calling allies because winter co expects test and all of their pets to invade. 
---
Ahhhh, good to see another one, how long has it been since the last one?
---
MACs are supposed to be globally unique, and while there are cases where this is not super true (vmware etc) its is still largely true. 
---
It is the exact same time. It is ONE killmail!
---
Not unless somebody fucked up. The first three bytes are assigned to a manufacturer and the last 3 are supposed to be incremented.
---
Actually combat fit supers and rat in this way.       
---
It still will be the best way to make isk - simply those hyperspatial-no-tank-fits will be gone.
---
This pic in launcher would have made me running away screaming ... the look ... THE PITCHFORK !!!!
---
so why are ppl crying bbout super ratting etc. just adapt
---
Some people restart their computer once per year. 
---
I don't understand, how is a 2 minute longer wait a hard nerf?
---
its 6 min not 2
---
sanctums was increased from 6 to 12 I believe
---
In this case i'm just stating that chaining sanctums is impossible in a supercarrier because there is too much downtime (Like 2 minutes between the 3rd and the 4th site i think?)
---
Basically what people are saying is why bother supercarrier ratting in an overcrowded system if you can't take advantage of the speed of a supercarrier?  
---
Me 2, but peraps if you pimp the 4 DDA instead of t2 it could work. 
---
Yeah you might have to spread out instead of crowding safely under the super umbrella
---
Invade in tenerifis? I don't say it bad to be prepared and call an additional help but in the meantime, you are saying blueball is bad.
---
85 man alliance?
---
But you cant multibox super it s really too intensive with just one...
---
&gt;before downtime:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Havens 10 minutes
---
 
---
Now:
---
That's 2 mins extra, no?
---
The 6/10's (rally points, menegeries etc) went from 6 to 20 mins.
---
oh look, we've got ourselves a space lawyer right here...
---
Inb4 Burner Missions nerf, as you can do it with 1 char basically and have ISK/hr like 3-4 Rorquals. And, not to forget, you commit the cardinal sin of NOT tabbing out while PvEing and watching Netflix.
---
o7
---
Gas haven is easy for fighter. The real threat for fighter is the last wave in one sanctum (with the 5 ring). Rest is okay. And i say that in br space so they shoot my fighter with 0% resist em / therm.
---
If you see my lossboard you'll see how that one ends MonkaS
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Sanctums were 6minutes havens 10minutes before dt...now both 12minutes. How hard is that to understand?
---
What a bunch of fucking losers.
---
I mean I'm a recruiter, i would want to know where that isk and sp came from. New pilot less than a month old with a shit load of isk is a huge red flag without a vouch or proof that you've bought plex irl and sold it.
---
You are kind of hosed unless you can provide proof of plex transactions or have someone you know in the game that I know that can vouch for you. 
---
Also, a there's still some bitter vet mentality. Let's say you are a month old character with 100 mil sp. I have a guy in my corp thats been playing for 7 years and has 100 mil sp, unless you are autistically good at eve and learning, you will be a burden in ships and game mechanics that others have been flying and putting up with for literally years.

Why does stainguy care about super ratting?
---
He lives in stain dosent he?
---
Where you cant really super rat.
---
:thinking:
---
must feel horrible to risk something and live without instant cyno win button
---
MAC's are not unique per nic, you get duplicates every now and again even from the same supplier, and some devices don't even have correct MAC's (iv'e seen blanks and non-standard length ones)
---
Ah gotcha. Must be having an off day.
---
Say “Can we get a low sec gate to stain one more time....”
---
oh come on since when was join eve uni bad advice? 
---
What's gonna happen:
---
- more umbrellas
---
- possibly war for Drone regions and carrying on as usual
---
reply == true
---
so the idea of nerf delve super ratting meta its working....
---
ill love to see how other regions with rentes deal with
---
Well done CSM19 ;)
---
And this is supposed to be bad news?
---
Outch 6 to 20 it s hard lol. But you do it early in the game. 2 years without doing one.
---
If I'm not wrong, you can only pass a gpu to one VM. In native sandbox, the gpu will be shared across all the instances.
---
To what does this comment refer? I am very interested. Do you have a link or something?
---
I mean hell, I wouldn't mind showing people receipts for PLEX purchases with any personal info not showing and also the sale of the PLEX ingame. 
---
I don't have anywhere near that amount of SP. Somewhere around 10m. Even though I can potentially use the good ships, I'm currently still only using ships that are feasable for someone of my experience. I figured there is no point flying and wasting ships if I don't know how to use them. 
---
Lol. So now you need to chew through 22 million ehp instead of 3 million.
---
I didn't say it was, but implying that you need experience to be in a nullsec alliance isn't true
---
nah faction caps deffo changed sb ratting, but didnt end it at all
---
you had to pay attention and just warp to next site  and send another alt in a carrier to kill it, or just tell the other krabs,  when they were new at least the loot from those npc caps was good money, people would gladly go kill them and let the site respawn
---
My only objection is that CCP nerfed the site respawns pretty heavily while the constantness of the isk faucet can probably be attributed to the introduction of dark blood titans and dark blood dreadnoughts to havens and sanctums.
---
To some it's bad news to others it's good news.
---
It just depends what you are and how you'll adapt to the changes ;)
---
College/University exams etc. 
---
It make me think about the burst ecm frigate that got used 8 month ago.
---
It's possible to use a gpu across multiple instances but it's not really a common thing to do 
---
no we dont. But we made a deal. This is fair warning that this was what we would consider be breaking it. They PAID for this deal.
---
Like everyone is so stupid thinking we all invading and shit, like comon. IF we wanted to invade we'd just do it, we don't need any excuses. 
---
This is awesome :D

 This is the corp that will teach you the game and because its neutral (or it was last time I played), most people will take you from here. 6 months and your gonna know everything you need to know if you play regualrly and your gonna make friends. Plus these guys are pretty cool. After you graduate with these guys your gonna be solid with mechanics (hopefully) and your gonna know what you want to do in game and have a good idea how to do it.

 I have to warn you for my own conscious to beware of highsec "newbie" corps. They are normally either scams or fellow newbies. Either way you wont learn much and your just gonna get war decced all the time. Which really sucks. 
---
WEAKNESS AND SHAME
---
On the notes I saw, it just looks like they're adding 30% to the NPC cost of books in the character sheet. I haven't logged in to see if there's new pricing.
---
This is the best one.
---
I have a Hel with a dedicated char that is just sitting in it.       
---
My current issue is that i falling asleep after a single haven... 
---
and no i am not shooting Sansha. 
---
It was a CCP goal, right? 
---
That comment was in regards to a school nt letting kids cheat while taking an important text and parents rioting because it was not fair that children at other schools could cheat on that test while theirs could not. The test is/was kind of like a big entry of sorts into higher education options. So.. in that sense it was actually a bit true. That specific school I believe confiscated cell phones and computers and had locked the exterior doors and placed monitors at each door while the testing was done.
---
Because super bots don't exist either...
---
its there basically to give XiX some freedom to play around with Fraternity over the course of the six month deal but allows us to say "enough is enough, STOP" if frat started to push them around to hard. Being that frat was 6 times their size at the start of the nip and is probably still triple, its what it is.
---
Frat agreed to it because they knew xix was no threat to them. 
---
If you wanna know stuff about PH pm me ;)
---
I do new Player Coaching in PH.
---
Just playing a little bit longer would normalise this behaviour. Horde would take you anyway in the meantime. I find it interesting that this alone lets them assume you are an alt. When we do API checks we look for patterns and if there is none I don't think we'd assume you are an alt. Selling Plex can be seen in the API too. But than we are Germans, gotta be efficient.
---
They pay for themselves so fast that losing them doesn't matter.. and I've lost more to rats than roamers.
---
So many times I've warped to an anom and got distracted and tabbed back to a pod, more so than I've been caught by roamers, I'd say.
---
The 30% hike on the skills purchased via the character sheet is in. The updated base prices will be coming in a different patch, but soon.
---
Stopping the botters was the goal I hope. But I think about how much dps I'll need to kill these supers. It'll take 20 mins with a 200 man bomber fleet.

Parents and students protesting in front aof an University where students got bad grades for cheating in exams ...
---
Oh I understood it, but you used it incorrectly. This wasn't a deterministic test within certain parameters, and to say that there's no difference between any variation of hard knocks being evicted and scoring enough points to pass a test is retarded. Especially considering the fact that you can absolutely have your passing score on any exam anywhere revoked of the means of achieving that score were determined to have foul play.
---
Now if you're able to be following at this point, try and grasp the fact that you are not speaking to a retarded initiative underling, and your attempts at hand waving issues away by changing context, and trying to use phrases you think sound intelligent are ineffective. 
---
&gt; But no one outside of your autistic echo chamber falls for it. So keep on responding to people you know you're not fooling in the off chance one of your minions comes across it so they'll keep on pressing f1 :)
---
Before PL and friends tried attacking test in the south, CENTI was down there fighting MWM. After CENTI took a constellation there and set up shop, XIX had just been evicted from the east, and came down there to crash on test's couch. They tried to evict CENTI from the pocket, but after 2 fleets they gave up and had test do it for them.
---
Well, the majority of skillbooks are priced fairly evenly, but there's a handful that are over or under priced. It's entirely possible the pricing balance pass will result in 5-10 books being repriced, so most of us won't even see it unless one of them happens to be one you were specifically keeping an eye on (a regular flip-target, wanting to buy on an alt but shy of the investment, etc).
---
If it's done correctly, no books should stick out as having been repriced, because the price would be as expected for a skill of that level/necessity/whatever. Unless you literally noted the prices beforehand and find one different now, it should be an almost invisible change.
---
Heh, this is good. 
---
And it's still a EULA violation so if CCP drops the hammer all of your stuff will be gone forever, omega or not.
---
Then I haven't the faintest clue. I'll keep on searching for somewhere to be for a few months. Get a handle on things and then maybe try again with these guys in the future. 
---
Greatest news for a long time.
---
Thank you for the clear response!
---
How about you SppRreEaaAdd out, so you know half the games nullsec population cant live in one region. 
---
Same, VNI's are so cheap too.
---
To be fair the Chinese Communist Party feels this way about intellectual property theft and industrial advancement/advantage. The end justifies the means.
---
Glad to help :)
---
*BA DUM TSSS*
---
Shot you a PM mate, thank you
---
Yeah it had nothing to do with skillu showing up for every Centi timer, right? :P
---
That's a very valid point.
---
That probably is it anyway, even if it can be figured out many probably don't bother or don't want to take a risk or something. But yes, just join horde for a bit. In a couple months I doubt it'd look sketchy to most.
---
&gt;The desperate need to be right must make you utter some absolute garbage some times, hmm?
---
Projecting much? lmao
---
Make it SOon (TM)
---
B..but i thought murica was paradise, no racism, no sexism, no poverty and all have the same chances no matter if you were born down in Missisipi as a black kid or as W.A.S.P. in Manhattan.
---
basically .... the good ones ...
---
i think you'll find that most super ratters don't chain sanctums, so for them not much has changed. supers can easily do havens, fhubs, fpoints in addition to sanctums.
---
This toon is as old as the day I made it. Only a month old
---
I'm starting to think the Alt question is coming up in regards to how much money I have as a 1 month old character.
---
OMG this is hilarious ....
---
Nah, people will just spread out more. You will just see carrier ratters more often in the pipe, rather than in the end pocket...
---
goes to show that it is easier to numb your population than to implement laws to keep them from actually using their brains. 
---
'Murica Fuck Yeah...
---
The goal was to slow down the ISK being created and reduce inflation. Which this will achieve, whether its enough to make a dent is to be seen
---
Even worse when fleets aren't working and the chat system is down.
---
Thanks for the Advice mate. I do currently have an app in with Dreddit because someone suggested I do that but in the mean time I might just jump in and roll around with PH. At least I can get some experience under my belt and look less like some kind of an alt spy thingo. 
---
Urgh, I really wish I just played the game normally at this point and didn't spend the money on plex. 
---
MAKE EVE GREAT AGAIN #MEGA
---
Man he got fat and goony.
---
burner missions with 1 char is about 150-250m isk per hour, thats only a bit more than one rorq
---
Giving it away probably is what broke the camels back ;) - Dreddit should accept you with this Reddit account, but it takes some time unfortunately.
---
then maybe, to age your toon to match your wallet (6months? to a year old?)
---
join corps who simply dont care if your a spy or not.
---
a large number of mega alliances dont really care, ie: some groups in goons, pamfam, brave newbies maybe.
---
Ivy league! or some hisec groups (if its pvp you want, Pirat (although a large portion russian theyre good dudes) RIOT, CODE, Hell House ive had some fights with that maybe dont mind taking somone in for hisec stuff. 
---
Panic Attack are mostly beginner friendly but not sure about the spy thingy they might not like it the same as others. worth an ask. theyre a lowsec group super relaxed and just want to pew.
---
Also this, move from untanked super to a ratting fitted carrier and make same isk.
---
haha you snowflake
---
rofl
---
Yeah it was some big chunks too. A guy helped me for nearly a week straight so I gave him 1b. A couple hundred million here and there for other super helpful people. 
---
Ah well, as you said it won't look as weird in a few months 
---
They don’t really care who they steal from as long as they win the long-term objectives. Especially if there are zero consequences. America just happens to be investing the most time and effort into research/innovation they can steal to achieve their objectives.
---
Because XIX would have their hands full with FRT/skillu, and it's not in our best interests that XIX loses that space.
---
Besides, we've been waiting 6 months to shoot FRT "I'm not going AFK until Test is kicked out of their space" again.
---
Shit, I even logged in yesterday.
---
Eve is nothing but fair? You can do anything you want to.. The only this holding you back is isk.. If eve isnt fair whos it designed for? Goons. Yes it favours big blocks but nothing is deliberately unfair.. 
---
If we put destroy able resources down. I bet you with in a month mining will die. Because if the rocks are to easy you'll have to keep a fleet out 24/7 to defend it. If there to hard to destroy your not going to do anything. If they're easy enough that a sb can throw a bomb at a belt and its gone. This would break eve fundamentally.. I can agree we need some resource scarcity but this is not the way to do it.
---
Oh, my, God becky, look at that grid.
---
A-type prices are going to sky rocket
---
So you are missing crucial knowledge on how to make real money with burners. I do 7 burners per hour with one char, according to market prices of some items ONE burner mission nets me 65 million ISK average (60-75). So 7 x 65 Mio ISK is 455 million ISK/hour
---
I can't find a link right now, but that was recently changed.
---
They hit both player and corp/alliance wallets.
---
You can also just click your alphas within a short grace period without any issues. Can easily log 10ish alphas in at once without any issues.
---
Technically that's scagging; we're not killing them on behalf of a non-blue entity; we're killing them because we don't like bots
---
I dunno, the Harry Potter one was pretty solid.
---
you actually believe this don't you? lmao
---
right?
---
You are not wrong about the glory part.
---
I haven't been following r/eve closely lately.  What was Falcon Challenge in response to?  Link?
---
So whats this CCP Falcon thing all about?  Missed the meme :(
---
Yo! That would be me. My PC's RAM has a weird thing where it constantly thinks it's overclocked (it's not). When I turn the machine on, its about a 50-70% chance that it'll fail to start Windows and go "Overclocking failed". I once had to sit there doing nothing but rebooting for 3 hours to get into it.
---
Burner missions do not give 65 million average lol, closer to 50. and I guarentee 7 per hour is not realistic. 
---
Yeah it's looking like the smartest option at the moment people are suggesting is exactly that. Look for someone slightly less worried about Alts and just have fun for a few months. 
---
Then maybe down the track I'll reapply for these ones.
---
One issue is that some places won't even look at your application if you were previously rejected
---
I think chaining rock havens, sanctum + forsaken hubs in an empty higher security system would still probably be doable in a hyperspatial super, no?
---
They did show up for a few, but it was not every timer. They would show up if it was convenient for them, which was not always.
---
You're telling me you don't have 2 screens so that you can watch netflix while PVE'ing? I always have it on my left screen and whatever game on my right.
---
Can't say anything about it, I were in 90% of fleets but do not remember any official activity against CENTI (like super max reddish maroon cta). For sure they were in tenerifis, they got evicted and then returned to tenerifis with RED. Yes, after cltx we had low numbers in fleets but still, we were bigger then CENTI so I do not think xix cried to legacy (and I think CENTI were evicted by voltron)
---
We would need more information to answer your question. As your reddit name can't be found ingame I can't even tell you by that.
---
Did you give your API? register at seat or a similar tool? If it was even before that step then your corp history or zkill must have some red flags.
---
If it's due after providing API probably some trade history.
---
It would also be interesting at which corps you applied. Many corps don't accept low skill point players. If you don't have low skill points because you injected a lot that makes you indeed suspisious, too. It's not normal that a new player would spend a lot of real life money to inject to let's say 30m SP.
---
not sure where you want to get into, or where youve tried and are told you cant re apply.
---
sorry if its on this feed and im just not seeing it im at work currently :D
---
but the only thing you run risk of is liking the group you join too much to leave in 6months time
---
&lt;insert your mom joke here . jpg&gt;
---
I really would not bother with "proving" your self. I would personally go to a new bro   alliance like PH. As it will teach you a shit ton about the game. 
---
There are other open sigs, dreddit, would probably be a decent choice, brave and goon I believe also have a easy to apply for corp.
---
&gt; I'm not sure how this targets the botting game since it motivates people to get into afk VNIs which is indistinguishable from botting.
---
This is where you are wrong. Humans make mistakes, bots do not (unless local/bot is broken), this is how you distinguish a player from a bot. CCP can make this distinction, they just don't care about it. 
---
Murdering PvE will only make the game worse for legit players while bots will not give flying fuck. This is the result of CCReee being what they are, incompetent at best, reckless at worst. 
---
Captain?
---
It's easier to look into someone else's problems than your own. Case and point: you can't see your fellow americans who do push against the cultural tides and thinking critically.
---
To save me all the typing.. heres a video that explains it. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2SpN-OePzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2SpN-OePzc)
---
but, the true reason people earn so much is because space is just so safe now. not as much to do with spawn rates imo.
---
have you seen goonville? theres a 23/7 cyno and a keepstar in every single system. some systems have 2 keepstars.
---
madness.
---
My Father who worked for the Canadian Fed government, had said people would not use their work computers because the Chinese were always hacking them.
---
Having two example screenshots was too much for for your average player you should probably pair it back.
---
He's hijacking top comment to get more reactions.
---
It was very much test. We weren't "evicted" necessarily, as much as we were "forcefully encouraged to leave". As soon as the keepstar in UALX went up, we knew our days were numbered. We were still holding all of our space at the time, but we knew we had no hope of holding it all.
---
We did fight the odd 200-man test fleet in our space, and we had no choice but to ask skillu for help. But the XIX fleets? That was all us IIRC. It was funny to see the XIX meeting sperg about how "they were doing it on their own" then test shows up to our space 20 minutes later.
---
HA HA I snorted and coffee went up my noise when I saw this.
---
They were, but in practice they don't.
---
I have applied using API to a few of the major ones so far. 
---
I have injected a few SP, up to about 10m SP. This was really a harebrained thought on my part attempting to get the "magic 14" out of the way early. 
---
I have applied to corps within Goon and one within TEST. Also I have talked with smaller alliances which have given me roughly the same response. 
---
My trade history would really only show me selling Plex and crap I've found exploring. Plus some cash donations to people who have helped me early on but these wouldn't total an insane amount 
---
I'd imagine CCP will have the statistics to be able to see that, and can readjust again if neccessary.
---
Ah, I see you too are a master of grid-fu
---
Can confirm the scrooge mcduck style vault full of exotic dancers, male in my backyard.

[https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/issues](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/issues)
---
Seems like it. I hope making it clear with caps will be enough :D
---
Just go roam their sov. Most of their pvers display the same ~suspicious behavior~ as fraternity ‘bots.’ If we’re simply assuming everything we think to be a bot is a bot then XIX is probably the most computer run alliance in the game 
---
It's bad news to legit players, bots don't care anyway.
---
Thx. Will probably add that later
---
&gt;Murdering PvE
---
Bit of an overreaction, no? Especially since it's only one particular strain of PVE that has been nerfed here?
---
\&gt;  Pretending ratting is a problem in a game where you can just afk Rorquals and make 200m/h is being retarded. 
---
I think both have their issues, and I'm glad CCP are finally making changes.
---
I have 3 Screens for poor 3 Accounts, as I am an bittervet casual pleb. 
---
One can activate covert cloak and take BLOPS bridge, the other cannot.
---
[Sure you can.](https://everef.net/type/49701)
---
Once you got one of these the standing hits become so tiny for declining missions back to back you can fish for burners.
---
In the thumbnail image for a video in the Launcher, Falcon is staring rather intensely out at us... And the memes were born. 
---
I am currently in the process of looking into PH due to its low bar for entry and it's opportunity to learn the things I am interested in. 
---
Other than that I have an application in the works with Dreddit as someone within that corp suggested trying in /r/evejobs 
---
This - been playing since 04 and this is objectively the best the game has ever been.
---
Some gameplay choices notwithstanding.
---
Trying to look smart but obviously just incompetent ...
---
Nice to see an honest video showing easy kills and loses :) Good Video!
---
A spreadsheet you make yourself
---
Back in the days you had pulling Alts, I still have them, so I can pull with 3 chars giving me 12 mission slots per round so I can even cherry pick without the booster
---
So xix asked TESTs to evict you whilst TESTs already evicting you? Outstanding move
---
A wonderful and sad insight. 
---
I used to play WoW way back when (don't hate me, I followed friends, and it was my focus on crafting and market PvP in WoW that my boyfriend used to tempt me into EvE a month after he moved in, so can't fault the journey). We saw literal sweatshops of Chinese farmers, working for pennies to farm gold. No one chooses that life, they were there because they had no viable alternative. Rather than hating them, I felt sorry for them. 
---
The companies exploiting both them and the game, they were the real bad guys. But, even so, it's easy to understand: if someone came to you and said you could be a millionaire in a year's time, just you have to hurt some game you don't play and underemploy some people you don't know...most would be tempted, at the very least.
---
Now, they don't even have to corral thousands of people into unsafe work conditions and pay them poorly, because for half the cost you can build a bot and make even more profit with even less ethical dilemmas. Suddenly, it's way more tempting, especially when you yourself are suffering under economic downturn: do you choose your morals, or to pay rent next month? 
---
That's not to say give up on the arms race against botting/exploits out of sympathy, it's still a plague that needs to be eradicated. But we do need to understand that those making or using these bots are not some cartoon villains twirling their impressive moustaches and plotting the downfall of the games they prey on, and address the attitudes that make people feel like they should bot/hack as well as the economic incentives to produce such things, as well as the detection &amp; defence aspects.
---
He wasn't just ratting during a stratop, he was gating a super without prop mod during a stratop not watching intel channels for at least 20 minutes.
---
Some people need to learn with their wallet.
---
Alright richie rich you can take your flexing elsewhere.
---
Idk what you are talking about *brave doesn't have capitals!*
---
His question was why is the pilgrim the only one gimped tho.
---
TEST Diplo Please Ignore
---
Because why should one be as strong as the other with the ability to take blops ?
---
Just learn and make dank money without dull crabbing for hours
---
Bye have a wonderful time
---
Yep, join E-UNI, and stay docked up because you can't undock with war targets in system.
---
As far as learning the game mechanics and all parts of the game and not just a single style, all of the other groups you mentioned have the exact same opportunities that E-Uni has, but with better services and more knowledgeable teachers.
---
The pilgrim is a very underloved ship. Either 1-2 more launcher points / 5-10% missile bonus buff / 5-10% drone bonus buff would be nice.
---
Tbh, I think instead ccp should embrace it the other way. Build native multiboxing support into the client. Instead of managing a single ship, a fleet. 
---
But if you read the post, all of the other combats and force recons share the same bonus, except the pilgrim.
---
Bummer. I had to take a break for a few years and during that time almost everyone I knew from back then "died". So I moved on a looked for new friends and people to fly with.
---
Bungholioooooooo
---
As something who has been out of the game a while could someone please explain?
---
Harry Potter one has it in my opinion 
---
is the member of a coalition that saved and is handholding xix talking about botting?
---
really?
---
That sounds like a good change to be honest.
---
You're a massive tool, how can you say in one post that there was never a problem and this is exaggerating, and in the next you post a screenshot of presumably some command member having to ping a massive wall of text so that the sperglords stop acting like 12 year olds? 
---
If you own this kind of system - then yes. 
---
Maybe that'd be an acceptable idea. Unfortunately it will never happen because it's a straight reversal of a previous change.
---
&gt;I'm oldskool and I liked that kind of corp culture
---
You like racist cultures? You sure about that? What if the reason was against you and your family?
---
I'm living in "their" sov. There were funny cases when a bot warped to an anomaly with a super in it and starts krab. Promptly destroyed by chutlanin &lt;3 maybe I will grab a cloaky astero but I do not think XIX is a good place for bots right now
---
This is a useless platitude. "Just learn how to do something you don't know how to do" oh yeah great that's super fucking helpful go fuck yourself, ok?
---
There are 95+ systems in Delve. We have 41 Keepstars, many of which aren't even in Delve but are in neighboring regions. There is only 1 system with multiple keeps, our capital.
---
But sure, pull random "facts" out of your ass and exclaim your exasperation in coy, bad-faith arguments.
---
Yes, people generally dislike racism. Do you like it or something?
---
Hahahahahahahahaha this can't be real, what a guy 
---
 Three... one system has three keepstars 
---
Yeah your probably right, its a shame that previous change is slowly rotting the game
---
of course u can compare them, they are both fruit, they both contain atoms, they both on earth, yet they are not the same. 
---
Thhis has nothing to do with them being comparable, what fucking isn't?  We share 50% of our DNA with bananas yet you are not a banana, at least im hoping you're not.
---
You are just trying to derive all meanings from a win. Stop it. Just achieve you personal goals and grab the occasional win
---
I joined my first fleet this week. The reasons for the fleet were secret but it turned out to be to celebrate Katia Sae's circumnavigation of eve. Fireworks were shot and a good time was had. 
---
At a certain point the fireworks got so bright it was literally a second sun in the system.
---
I am new to this game and I am truly having a great time exploring and meeting new people in the Signal Cartel.
---
P.S. I couldn't find signal cartel in the flair library, I'm guessing it doesnt exist?
---
Falcon and rook, 30% jam strength per level      .... like if this matters now .          
---
LOL
---
im so sorry,
---
i had friends of 2years of mine in goons, tell me that its a joke and stated exactly what was said by me above.
---
 but i will apologies to the guy ive just met on reddit who claims to know more. with no proof from either side.
---
if you think 41 keepstars in a region is not an issue. you truly are a goon.
---
All is nothing in op's post grounded in reality as you claim, or he's right and your guys were pretty fucking racist?
---
You are missing the entire point of the comment / question which is translated to: Why do all Force Recons share a similar, respective, role bonus to their non-blackops counterpart with exception to the Pilgrim? All Force Recons are reasonably attributed bonuses relevant to their heavy assault cruiser brother (*or sister*) except the Curse to Pilgrim transition, which is quite frankly shit.
---
I lost about a day when this happened and just submitted a ticket and got the missed sp back.
---
/u/the_major apparently. Lol
---
Having the statistics is rarely enough by itself tho. They see the raw numbers sure, but I imagine they might very well lack the analysis needed to make sense of it. They need context.
---
It's insane how nutjobs instantly play the "suppress free speech" card whenever thir views get challenged. There is no point to argue with that guy or try to explain him anything, he's not thinking straight nor is he arguing the point. In his mental state right now, he's the victim and always will be
---
There internet has spoken; more people dislike you than like you, so consider leaving the internet yourself. Racists aren't wanted here.
---
That happens when players live in he space they own...
---
This didn't all happen on the same day...
---
no, that happens when people live in the space they own, with limitless funds and no limit on use of citadels.
---
how does one do burners with one account? Please share this knowledge.
---
Oh noes!
---
Yeah good question, why bother. Better spread out.
---
Jesus christ
---
Erh my bad
---
Solution: Join Calmil. Retake the wz.
---
Or everyone already has a titan or 5 plus supers 
---
What is your problem and why you are so aggressive? Maybe I would have helped you, but i guess that train is gone now ...
---
Ahh I get it, you guys are all between 16 and 19 years old, where you can simply change and mature in a couple of months and where sense of morals only start appearing. 
---
Pretty sure it does, I live in a WR and the fitting window shows higher dps when I'm in space than when I'm docked.
---
It means all the downvotes don't mean shit if you're guys the hypocrites without a fucking clue. 
---
Pretty sure there are other differences also. rook has more CPU and Shield capacity than falcon.
---
Pilgrim has more powergrid and armor than Curse.
---
I guess its all balanced somehow.
---
If you need any thing just ask, if you do apply it normally wont take more then 24 hours for your application to be processed.
---
If you are still learning, we run a fleet (try run it 24/7) that is just for leaning, asking questions ect. That will be some pvp mainly isk making though. 
---
We have a newish FC taking bombing fleets out regularly which are a lot of fun. 
---
As you get more experienced, we have a any can ping a fleet rule. Which means as long as you are not stupid you can easily learn to FC with us.
---
We are very relaxed with only strat ops being  serious, though most of the time it has a caretaker or NBI to look after the newbros.
---
Not sure if joking ? How do you do burners with more than one acc?
---
I have some quite expansive frigs, I board them and warp to mission, kill the NPC and done. The new booster allows for 2 days of infinite cherrypicking (you can decline missions with minimal standing loss) so you do not even need additional puller alts.
---
* Both the Curse and Pilgrim have the same raw DPS potential with their offensive system (drones). Unlike other recons, their raw DPS system (not including neuts) isn't inherently limited by lack of high slots.
---
* As a result, neuts on the Pilgrim are nerfed to keep the spirit of giving "combat" recons more offensive capability.
---
(This is just a possible explanation to explain the disparity. I'm not saying this is balanced. I don't think recons have ever been touched by a balance pass.)
---
All the more incentive to spam rorqs! Love this game. :)
---
No worries, I'm just thinking out loud ;)
---
When your TL:DR is 1/3 of the post.
---
The thing is... Sanctums respawn every 15, Havens respawn every 20 minutes and rally points respawn every 30 minutes now. So this is supposed to solve the problems of the economy? Cuz the one dude farming with a super is the problem, not the other one with multiple rorq pilots. For some odd reason I feel like ccp only thinks that you are ruining the economy if you are doing it with one account... Quality changes ccp, as usual.

I mean, he's only the guy who drops the keepstars and maintains the internal map of them. I'm sure he has no clue how many there.
---
Thanks mate, it seems like a pretty great place to learn PvP. 
---
If I have any questions I can think of, I'll shoot you a message.
---
whats gonna shoot out to 250+  while the rook jams you sir,  have fun locking that far lul
---
&gt; It might require separate OSs but virtualized systems running on server hardware will run more like bare metal systems
---
What specifically about "server hardware" allows you to do this?
---
Not really. You can still drop your blops on VNIs and isktars. Yeah ofc you're not gonna drop your sin or w/e on a rattlesnake or carrier, but that was never the case.
---
Just please please actually drop it. Don't go gating your blops like a mango
---
The answer is yes, but be sure you can't make it more efficient before just jumping in.
---
Your margins are better producing from scratch by extracting (assuming local customs offices aren't owned by psychopaths). It also severely reduces investment costs, as you're not at the mercy of market fluctuations in the materials you need.
---
However, extracting is high maintenance (moving heads to cover hotspots, etc.) and a high drain on your available power resources per planet. It's only realistically viable if you have multiple characters.
---
If you only have one PI character, and want to produce T4s, set them up with their T4 factories, then the T3 factories needed to feed them, then T2, etc. until you run out of resources. The further back in the chain you can get it, the better your margins will be. 
---
If you have multiples, use the one with the worst scanning skills to do the above, and keep working backwards until you hit the one with the best planetology to do extracting. Ideally, extraction planets should also build T1 just to reduce customs tax and m³ size of shipments: importing/exporting raw materials is not fabulous, so avoid pre-T1 movement wherever possible.

&gt; What is your problem and why you are so aggressive? 
---
Because of:

&gt;Maybe I would have helped you, but i guess that train is gone now ...
---
No you wouldn't have. Or it would have been the same "train capitals" thing i've been told a dozen times already. 
---
I've been down this road multiple times on reddit already. It always end in "lol you don't know? well sucks for you."

That's what a cruise missile armor Raven is for

Pardon?
---
Nah. Fozziesov is AIDS, so we'll just pack as many dudes into the space we have as we can. If that means we shed some krabs, so be it.
---
wtf are you my alt, this is a shitty post
---
Without a doubt, but this is Eve now. It started moving away from Risk/Reward balancing around the time citadels got announced. I can't see CCP doing a great deal to shake up null and bring the risk back tbh
---
Totally agree. Its something we do when they link a fut they have done. We will then ask them questions like why have you put a nano upgrade on a plated ship? We will then explain what irs normally used for and will explain what they can do to improve. 
---
they do and its big numbers
---
I said it before and I'll say it again! We need Universal Basic Income, there needs to be an ADC built into every hull, and cargo asset safety! It's only fair.
---
yuge
---
And most of CSM19 is goons....think on that my dude.
---
You'd see the price of plex go up by about a bil a month.
---
Maybe its just because you get too aggressive very fast ?
---
for sure I will not open a thread outing all my secrets so every low effort dude can copy it. But I always was helpful to newbees that are decent persons. If i killed Low SP players I always over(reimbursed) the kills ... I wonder what BRAVE has become, as they were one of the best adresses to learn the ropes quick and have fun meanwhile ... seems they are another n+1 Alliance now, sad.
---
?
---
Or maybe the alpha system is fucked. 
---
Here to small hope that nullsec plex scanning becomes somehow worth the time again
---
Only on this bad forum does increasing the amount of ISK one can put out on the field by several orders of magnitude constitute *less* risk. Man, things were better when the only material damage one could inflict were welping a battleship fleet and the loss of some ihubs!
---
JUST ADAPT OKAY?
---
Raknor please achor. pLeAsE
---
he cannot chain rock havens in 4 smartbombing machariels anymore due to the time it takes to respawn. Clearly he just needs to adapt.
---
still until the end of days, im going to trust my friends word above a goon, or multiple goons online.
---
so much secret and behind the scenes with goon leadership at the top. line members are just normal greedy players, but i am categorically disgusted by the monthly figure graphs ccp release on delve, what ive been told by trusted people actually in goons. and the reasons i know goons numbers are so high. for god sake goons go on the offensive, watch your numbers die down like mad and still be able to beat everyone in eve and win new eden, get it over and done with :D 
---
Out of curiosity how much time have you spent living (not visiting) in a country outside of the United States?
---
&gt; Maybe its just because you get too aggressive very fast ?
---
you opened fire first rubbing my face in the fact that the techniques i know are bad and that what you have is so much better.
---
&gt;If i killed Low SP players I always over(reimbursed) the kills 
---
Well that never fucking happened to me that's why i'm so salty and aggressive today. It was always "wow you are so fucking awful just fucking quit the game."
---
I've been trying hard to learn the ropes of how to make money and do pvp but every time i try pvp i get curbstomped and every time i try making money people are looking to curbstomp my vni.

So i'm not super stoked about someone coming and rubbing my face in how bad i am, i fucking know already alright i'm trying my best.

Maybe read this guide, it is for Burner missions in NPC Stain (for sanshas) where you need to have friends to do it and bubbles make moving Pirate Frigs with close to 1 bil Fitting hazardeous, but for that they even net you more ISK than I make running burners in a 0.1-Lowsec system.

Less risk for each player, in terms of hours of investment for what you have on the field, and the chance of losing it in the battle. 
---
Welping a battleship fleet used to be news-worthy. Now titans die in lowsec travelling every day, and noone even comments on it. Because they mean nothing anymore.
---
Probably the lowest effort post of 2019. GJ
---
Falcon's face on the launcher was... disconcerting. It has now become a meme.
---
silk road is closed though :thinking:
---
oh, wait for their programming team, nvm
---
I, too, strap another layer of tinfoil on when faced with easily verifiable facts. How the fuck can we possibly obscure how many keepstars we have deployed? They are there, to be counted, in space.
---
and still may be some xix fleets was in fight with you but you were already in a fight with tests so there no reason to ask help when help already provided
---
Also, it is true, xix a risk-averse group imo. I dislike it and many members of xix too, yesterday we could give a fight, get a negative efficency but for what? Feed the winter blob? WinterCo can excpect whatever they want but spies are not lying, they saw xix ping and tests pings, they knew that tests aren't forming at all and still called for help. We were ready to give a fight to frat, maybe skillu but not to everyone in the grid. So defending frat you are defending the same risk-averse bot group
---
Bring your sweet prince to lowsec.
---
true, but you'd get 1 bil a month
---
Thanks

I'm looking for the ship/fit you use for running them solo.
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. Drink piss.
---
Ohhhh PVE in 2019. Yuck
---
How does this differ from eve o preview?
---
Universal basic ticks is part of Elo Knight's CSM platform.
---
Historically all sorts of groups could make enough money to thrive and compete. With moon changes, supercapital proliferation &amp; umbrellas, rorquals, and skill injectors now only the richest alliances are benefiting. 
---
With universal basic ticks small and midsized alliances could once again compete on a more even footing with these fat cats.
---
Maybe one day, though when I finally get the look I'm after.   
---
I think it would be nice if the meetup/events had a little space like a gallery for Eve related artwork, would be pretty cool on a variety of levels
---
Bring the Chinese server back... and force any person/alliance caught botting/cheating to move to it too. 
---
universal plex for everyone!!!!!!!!
---
You should!
---
Team Burner - Dual Jam Garmur (LM, orbit 30, jam 1 Logi, kill other than burner) or Dual range script Polarized rocket Garmur if you are skilled you can just kill through the reps with orbit 20 (The Jaguar might get some hits at you there).
---
gurista burner - Worm (Daredevil)
---
Serpentis Burner - Hawk
---
Angel/Sansha Burner - Daredevil
---
Blood Raider Burner - Wolf
---
You need bling (Worm is 750 Mil. with fit, DD wit Abyssal web now close to 1 Bil) 
---
Shit that is a huge increase. GG
---
They're not out by much. My guess would be that the destroyed isk rounds before conversion to rl currency, but the total isk doesn't. The first screenshot had .23, so would round down, hence the destroyed value being less than the total, with the difference being the value of 0.23 isk; the second had .66, so would round up, hence the destroyed value being more than the total, with the difference being the value of 0.34 isk.
---
Not up for doing the crazy maths to confirm these values are correct to verify the theory, but it's the only logical explanation I can see.
---
CCP should sieze all of the industry buildings and manage the production of plex
---
Best explanation so far. 
---
As someone in dreddit hr, can confirm we are reviewing. Be patient. 
---
Not true,it has been shown that a higher percentage of chinese players cheat. Atleast that was proven in PUBG back in the day.
---
Of everything I can take from your posts about the current Skillpoint-Level and Setting the best way for you maybe to do it with 2 friends in cheaper ships I use. That shortens the risk of losing what you cannot afford maybe atm and also shortens the time to kill the NPC.
---
Thanks for those T1 cruiser roams all those years ago in Waffles, some of my fondest gaming memories.
---
&gt; no limit on use of citadels.
---
Its like CCP learned nothing from the UO days.
---
Proof or gtfo
---
Rorqual does like 120m/hr stop inventing numbers.
---
I know, and CSM listen not only GSF members, many many other player out there request a nerf over GSF ratting and mining unbalance machine.
---
That was the idea! Or I’m doing it wrong?
---
Sure many bees get mad about income.
---
My point is, the nerf apply to all region.
---
Now the no-bees have what they want, but No cries. They asked for, now deal with it too
---
Don't biomass and reroll. That's a terrible idea. It's an *especially* terrible idea if you're already having a problem with people thinking you're a spy alt.
---
Now that is nifty. I will try this out thanks.
---
Good fucking riddance.
---
Nah. We'll just keep the super umbrella in place, fill our space to the brim, and shed the dudes who feel crowded. I'm sure that the people who leave are going to continue to use their supercaps as normal for krab when they're not in the avuncular embrace of Goonswarm Federation, so everyone should be happy about this outcome.
---
Someone posted in on reddit and they got a little scared of getting banned as asset where easy to trace :D
---
Not a problem, I wasn't too worried about the length of the application process. I know these things take time.
---
I only use 2 accounts atm, but I just keep both on the right screen and alt-tab (I'm mining, so my ships literally always have line of sight to each other, so I don't need to change except to give orders.
---
This is both my favorite and least favorite trend. Nice one. 
---
Yeah, I wasn't going to do that. I'd rather just float around aimlessly in an NPC corp randomly joining up with people occasionally then do that.

You're in IT, aren't you?

---
Many love to HK who convoed me when they saw we were roaming the same space and coordinated to purge Eve of fits not even [I would come up with](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75616841/).
---
I quite paniced trying to coordinate corp mates to get into covops ships and bridge in (although to be fair we had to take a regional gate in front of a super with a BLOBS worth more than our target ...). I'm in aw to people able to organize this without panicking.
---
 Never done it, never will, but I can only speak for myself.
---
I've seen nothing that would render this tactic invalid on gates. 
---
It doesn't really work with docking at cynos since a) you have eyes on grid and b) the JF lands unpredictably in a 5km radius of the beacon and c) the station docking area is so much bigger than the jump zone around a gate. The attacker needs to be able to predict with high accuracy where the target will land so he can pre-position.
---
I don't have any friends. I'm very bad at making friends. And the friends i have from outside eve either didn't stick to it or disappeared into wormhole space like my brother did.
---
I always use to play actively when I am on the screen, all activities that can be afked and tabbed out do not thrill me, everybody to his gusto I guess ...
---
Titans die traveling in lowsec because the game changed to allow players to actually use them. It's the same reasoning where flying in a plane is safer than in a car; the car has much higher exposure time. Now that the single titan blob in the game isn't pinged on IRC when a solo titan character logs in and lights a cyno, and can't teleport instantly to it from anywhere in the game, players are willing to engage in more risk.
---
&gt; I don't have any friends. I'm very bad at making friends.
---
Hey, maybe just don't bark at other people at the 1st opportunity ;-P
---
With your scrub skills yeah maybe. 
---
Yes, you're doing it right lol.  I'm just pointing out that the GSF dominate CSM isn't listening to only GSF interests.
---
"When people would speak up, they would ask people to tone it down, but the next day, would be back at it."
---
I was mainly referring to this part, because when people did speak up about it, we cracked down on it hard and stopped this shit.   
---
The exaggerating thing was where it was like "oh ya 21 pages full of it" when in reality at least half of those where 1 or 2 people spamming it into a bot channel.
---
As I've said, it was stupid shit that we changed once people had issue with it and it had gone way to far, and it hasn't been anything like it for a few months. Which is why it's strange that this post suddenly pops up, not when it was happening, but after a few months, which is why we suspect the person that is this OP's throwaway is likely a member that was kicked (for being a big part of this racism/toxicity).
---
Baring in mind i woke up at 3am when I saw the post, and being OP is a throwaway and didn't actually seem to provide any evidence, I just dismissed it as an angry member that was kicked trying to meme or something - Though as my original post stated, yes it was happening, but it was swiftly dealt with once people took issue with it and we had realised it had crossed the line.
---
\*MEGAthron
---
have you gone around and counted them? i mean, maybe you have, i would presume not, neither have i.
---
meaning the both of us and putting our trust into a person that of which we know.
---
you know yours, and i would presume trust his statement,
---
i know my friend, and trust his statement.
---
of course so far, it would seem your keepstar placererer, would be correct and i am not calling him a liar, nor yourself. im simply stating what i have been told by goon members, who live there. whom i trust, who quite possibly could have over exaggerated, and so far have provided as much proof as you guys. nothing. just your word.
---
to which, ill die (ig ofc) before i trust the online reddit word of a goon
---
Was the main thing I was talking about there, because when people took issue with it, we dealt with it swiftly and put a hard end to it beings we realised how far cross the line it had gone.
---
Yeah they will probably to that knowing that they struggle to keep players with the current botting situation. 
---
Are we not supposed to be able to log in more than one alpha? I thought it was only doing alpha and omega that mattered.
---
I've been logging my alphas at the same time to update skill queues and have had no problem.
---
when you try to evict TEST but lose so bad that you have to accept an agreement that says XIX can attack you but you can't attack them.
---
~justfraternitythings~

Yep. It's easy, I go to the structure browser, filter for only keepstars.

I'm accusing you of being a Witch and its now your job to prove that you are not because I'm too tired and need a nap.

Tbf it effectively changed the rules as the exam started and could be likened to finding out its a closed book exam on the day.

The issue was systemic and only one school acted leaving those kids disadvantaged. Not sure how you could do it fairly tbh.

Obligatory botting and hacking is bad statement 
---
and ore prices will drop even more
---
Can confirm there was much grumbling about the NIP.

I don't see the problem about logging multiple alphas tbh.

Let me guess, your 200m/hr figure comes from continually mining dysprosium ore, right?

tbf, they are nice change from the usual REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Unless you have really good isk making activities, it will take quite a long time.

+1 running into duplicate mac's really fucking sucks. I also once had a quad port NIC which would choose random MAC's on each reboot. An absolute pain in the dick to deal with as this would trigger new eth interfaces everytime I had to upgrade the kernel. I had to write some rules to look at the PCI path rather than the MAC address to keep things consistent. God fuck that NIC card in the hole.

I'm War, obviously, because that's the player character in Nethack.

Why not change both? Just because one is changed now doesn't stop them changing rorquals as well.

True, but thats not an argument against active hull tanks.

Swap Hull reppers to a low slot and give us an actual opton to hull tank.

I mean, if we're being honest, doesn't Eve pretty much revolve around greed?  Isn't it all about making more and more ISK so you can buy more and more toys?

Have you tried pulling this ram from mainboard, and clearing the sticks a bit. (remember to "ground" yourself first to remove all possible charge).       
---
Have you tried to reorder ram - aka assuming different manufacturers put the same boards next to each other.           
---
Have you tried to remove part of the ram to check if maybe just one of the ram chips is damaged or simply "not fully supported" by your main board.        
---
Some stuff is also important. 
---
Like you should not mix faster and slower chips, as this can cause some issues.        
---
So you really have no idea what the United States is like and have nothing to compare it to, but felt like chiming in with some buzzwords to make yourself feel better.
---
The thing bout "fairness" just came up my throat cause I seem to read nothing but howling and bitching about how certain ships do not die if someone looks at them firmly. I needed to vomit that out somewhere ;)  
---
How bout having applied DPS gradually take away m³ from rocks? In the end you d needa find a "sweet spot" about how much damage applied you need to kill lets say 1m³ of the rocks to make it a viable tactic for attackers, but not instadeath for the defenders mining efforts too. A balance... Oh, FML, CCP and finding a balance...? K, I see your point :D
---
I toyed with mixing in forsaken hubs and rally points with havens after the first anom respawn nerf. They're not hard to SB (hubs might be sketchy depending on number of machs you use, skills, and exact fits, though), and ticks were like 90% of pure havens, albeit with fewer 10/10s.
---
and you just trying to find something you can yell your frustration at ?
---
You already get 1b a month by ratting
---
The PC is a custom built one that I got from a company that does custom builds as their entire business model. 
---
It went back to them three times for investigation and they never figured out why it does it. The ram chips and board have been completely replaced, and the chips are all the exact same model and all have checked out individually.
---
Ultimately, I usually only have to hit reboot once or twice, and other than this, it works perfectly, so I've just decided to live with it. It's been 5 years, so it's nearly at its replacement point anyway.
---
Id say 3, 1 damage control and one sensor booster to help against ecm.
---
I personally run 4/3 and don't usually see any issues with my predicted vs actual extraction rates.
---
In what universe do you live where a rook or falcon is jamming even close to 250 lmao? Shooting out to ~100 is pretty the base for every fleet these days.
---
&gt; I don't want to see them. 
---
Then don't look at them, weedbrain.
---
4-3 is what you want to aim for in an extraction toon, anything higher is a bonus, so yes, 4-4 would be well good enough.
---
Well prove reddit otherwise but stop being a smartass when you can't confirm shit
---
True that’s also a fair assumption 
---
Sebos are mid slots no ?
---
The they should replace the mother board or power supply. 
---
This looks like hardware issue.

Should change both but not like this. Adding 10-20 minute respawn time to sites is the butcher's way of solving problems. They doesn't really care about the ppl who invested in one sort of playstyle. They just say fuck you, good luck trying to compete with others, even if there are just 2-3 other dudes in system.

---
for me, and many others no, eve is about a game, not a job, not 24/7 krabbing. eve is the adrenaline rush, the sense of achievement from winning a fight. 
---
my statement about o on the offensive, i mean, deploy. to the rest of nullsec, and lowsec. kill everyone and dont stop. just keep going, wipe out nullsec. see if its doable. not go a poke one group and then reside back to krabbing.
---
goons are winning, or rather, goons have used the current state of game to thier un reversable advantage.
---
you think i cant join goons? if winning was the reason behind all this? the game is broken beyond repair to what it would seem. all it is is earn isk, and pretend to pvp for 1 hour a week. how sad is that.
---
its like ccp left their car open, and goons rather than knowing right from wrong, just went and took thier opportunity, and abused their power in csm and numbers and ability to do what has been done.
---
do you hate the thief for taking advantage of an opportunity, or the law for not protecting you from the thief?
---
maybe i make no sense here myself. it has become a bit of drabbling on, but i like eve, i dont want it to become this piece of shit streak that is mining in a rorq or ratting in a super in delve, and then have your main in your normal corps elsewhere, goons full of alts. alts from all over.

Very nice! 👌🏼😎👌🏼

Isn't ECCM a script for sebos and still a mid slot ? :p

I found buying p1 and making the p3 inputs to p4 to pay well but its a lot of hauling to keep running, bonus is you can use the same system for all planets. Hyperspacials and i stabs for the epithal help as well.

Cheers guys!  Also I guess since I've got you all here, for launchers should I be looking at running Cruise Missile Launcher II, Caldari Navy Cruise Missile Launchers, or 'Arbalest' Cruise Launchers?
---
You remind me of a younger me. People on this sub will dogpile on top of you at the first chance because Eve is an extremely cutthroat game. I don't view that as good or bad, it's just the way it is. And it can be very difficult to learn the ropes for that reason.
---
I used to try to go it alone and learn by reading, by mild experimentation, by watching videos, etc. But in this game that honestly doesn't cut it. You're way better off joining a corp that has people that know what they're doing. You'll learn more in one day that way than you will in a year of reading Eve uni or coming here.
---
Even if you aren't that personable, and I put myself in that category, you can still learn a lot just by observing, listening to FCs, listening on comms, chatting on Discord, etc. Most big groups don't really expect that much out of you. Even higher tiered ones. So my advice would be to give that a shot and I hope you find luck like I did.
---
Tech 2 if you can equip them, Arbalest if not.

T2 if you can fit them. T2 Ammo is superior DPS.

I like big grids and I cannot lie.

Could you give an example of a hypervisor that allows that ? (I'm not counting Hyperv for Windows Guests with RemoteFX because there is no gain from it)
---
Rooks still have a place in certain small fleet comps, especially vs 1-2 supers.

Thank you for your efforts. See you bros Saturday

As an engineer, I can attest first hand how it feels to spend years of your life designing, building, testing, deploying and improving a product (in my case an unmanned aircraft), just to find out that the fucking Chinese government stole your design and built their own. And to make matters worse, they did a piss-poor job and managed to make it worse, but because they can build it for a fraction of the price, they'll sell the thing to every tinpot republic with $2 to rub together. So now I get to watch a foreign adversary profit off of my and my colleague's hard work while proliferating a system that most countries who they will sell it to have no business operating this kind of technology.

As you can tell, I'm a little bitter on this topic.

So why did you allow it in the first place? By your own admission you used to warn applicants that the corp culture was racist and edgy.
---
Have you ever calculated how much EHP need to be grinned to kill all citadels in delve?        
---
I guess it will be a very fun number.

Just get a rorqual
---
It wasn't Fraternity who wanted to evict TEST. That was PL. We were just having fun shooting things and being good neighbors.
---
Smartbombing machs belong in lowsec
---
Many players will move to rorquals, more rorquals ... so this price is actually something reasonable in goonspace quite soon. 
---
More accounts ! CCP likes this. 
---
Best so far
---
No RL politics.
---
Get lost. If you're doing 100-120m/h with a Rorqual, either skill your char or learn to fit your fucking Rorqual. 
---
infinite free accounts capable of flying battleships and VNIs, what could go wrong?

Yes, I did.  No point making an annoyed post on reddit and not taking the steps to fix it.

A Signal Amplifier goes into a low slot and gives a slight bonus as well.

I play eve online game and fun have in my ship but sometimes on saturdays grr goons make many titans small gang pvp is key to space  e-bushido when tryhard too much metagaming.

Not fair. Can't play the game the way designers meant for it to be played, must instead whine on forums to attempt to change how game works to fit my gameplay style. Grr gon hat gon.

Hi.  I decided to try faction warfare today.  I captured two novice locations.  I'm Caldari and captured two Gallente locations.  However after completing both, I got a pop-up that said "Caldari thanks you for your efforts but declines to reward you" and at the same time, a popup on bottom right said "You received no reward points" or something to that extent.  
---
I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong...
---
So are you sov-null guy?
---
AUTZ +8 UTC
---
lmao ok.
---
Noraus famously said he wouldn't go AFK until TEST were kicked out of Esoteria, but I guess that wasn't Fraternity wanting to evict TEST?
---
Or are you saying Fraternity just follows PL's orders, so really it was PL wanting to evict TEST and Noraus just submitting to his master's desires?
---
Maybe your alliance is crowded into too small a space if there's lots of competition for ratting where you are? I fly through empty systems every day.
---

You mean what could go wrong other than what has already gone wrong ? Not much tbh. VNIs are not a problem from the alpha POV since you're doing like 12-15m ticks.

How many times i need to say this.

---
Oh that nerf is coming too, you can see it from a mile away. Get in while gettings still good.
---
Yes sure give attention to the throwaway who had the possibility to complain about this when it actually happened. Literally months ago, this just seems like a bad attempt at throwing shit at MOTC
---
Who in their right mind thinks that it's their job to force people to associate with other people? People are allowed to associate with whoever they want if that is their corp culture and you dont like it just leave its not hard
---
Ok, so what I'm reading here is that there is only one correct way to play eve eve (even though it is a sandbox game, meaning find/create your own content and play the way you want), if anyone plays it different from the way you play it, then it's wrong.  Got it.
---
CCP Falcon this morning: Well it’s a new day of keeping EVE weird! I’m sure the players have grown bored of photoshopping my face everywhere!  
---
r/eve:  
---
CCP Falcon: … damnit.
---
Here’s a protip, if they cared or had any sort of security automation this would’ve been fixed within a few months of Alpha clones being released.
---
Idk if they fix it or not but it hasn’t been a priority for them in two years, I don’t see that changing. It’s already stupid simple to multibox alphas regardless of this change.
---
The EULA is basically “if you get reported enough and a GM/security team member gets annoyed by all the reports in queue”, otherwise it’s worth less than the paper it’s written on
---
did you literally even read his first ping? 
---
i see you, i guess like many goons, miss the point of the complaints you see on reddit and the forums. what you state above is not the case, of course i would guess in some cases it is.
---
when the rules of eve didnt suit goons it was made very very clear and adjusted very quickly. see citadel timers adjusted to suit goon numbers or whatever else.
---
i dont hate goons, they were an admirable part of eve, that once upon a time made eve awesome to see strength. but unfortunately some changes have made those strengths into superpowers. and it feels and looks very irreversible.  
---
i think either goons and yourself are one of three things, new players who have had nothing else. ultra vetted players who actually are just too lazy for eve and like what it has become, boring farmville. or botters making alot RMTing under goon umbrella. not saying their all three, but one of the above at least
---
Not quite correct there. We told recruits that we make fun of each other, and don't really care about offending each other. I don't recall telling any new recruits that we were racist. I can't remember what started the use of the N word but I admit it spiralled out of control quickly (usually we'd have phases of memes on comms or w/e that lasted a day or two that would pass) but it just sorta kept going until people got annoyed with it, over time we stopped caring about what people said, though once one or two spoke up against it we agreed and realised that it had gone too far and put a swift end to it (Which caused 2 or 3 members to leave because of a mixture of knowing they'd get kicked for doing it more and wanting 'free speech' - which we know now really isn't an excuse for any of this behaviour). As I said before, looking back I'm not proud of any of it and I realise how stupid and immature the whole thing was, which is why we have 0 tolerance for any of that behaviour anymore.
---
It's the previous change the players wanted. "Make people use the space they own, and actually live in it."  You can't blame the Imperium for actually adjusting to the meta that players wanted.
---
o7, Sorry for your loss. 
---
Communism much?  They would have to change the name to CCCP
---
not at all. it is a sandbox. however its also a fucking game! and somtimes devs get it wrong. and this time the devs got it wrong, and let it stay wrong. and one certain group just happened to take the piss with it and ultra abuse the weakness in the patch. 
---
how about, they times structure costs by 200 times. and reduce income to all players by 100times. and remove the ability to unanchor structures, ,make them like a rig on a ship.
---
i wonder if youd be saying, meh sandbox i cant play the way i want, its not fair. everyone else gets advantage on us now we have nothing but all these people. wahhh i just wanna mine and get my 6th titan. lol
---
thanks mate

we'll never know since it was never provided

You might be in a system that is not contested at all (the bar should be empty).

And I know you mean "scary stuff" sarcastic.
---
Yet, socializing within a game does actually make me nervous, especially when it's about voice comm.
---
It just feels taxing to have contact with other people most of the time, hence why I usually keep to myself, mainly use text chat for communication or try to do my part silently while avoiding contact as much as possible.
---
I can't really put it into words, but social interactions make me nervous or at times downright anxious.

You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Be brave. We can fix anything.
---
Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Zip. That easy. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. There are no limits in this world.
---
You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Use what you see, don't plan it. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. All those little son of a guns. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.
---
It takes dark in order to show light. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. At home you have unlimited time. Let your heart be your guide. With practice comes confidence. You can do it.
---
Their numbers come from max skills with Delve ore prices; you are full of shit pretending rorqs make a 200m/hr and your bad posting does nothing to convince anyone of your point

why even bring it up now then?

Guess what happens to a burner frigate when you warp in 5 frigates.

If you think botting is what's causing the average player (who runs missions in highsec and doesn't go on reddit) to quit, you are hilariously out of touch.

I guess I have more of an old-school view on gaming than you do.  As I see it, if you like a game, you find a way to succeed within the parameters as set by the devs.  If you can't, or don't like what you have to do to succeed, then you find another game.
---
Let's put it this way - as is often joked, "show me where the bad goon hurt you."  How does what GSF does negatively impact your game?  Is it all a big "grr goons!" for you?  Or are goons actually keeping you from doing what you want to do in the game?  If goons are keeping you from doing what you want in the game, why haven't you found a way around it?
---
&lt;3 I hope life is treating you well 
---
I didn't; I didn't make this thread, I've only replied to others. However, I'm not going to let people pretend it never happened either, or ignore what happened when I was in corp.

&gt; Could the client just read whatever the current MAC is locally, send it to CCP and compare it with other current clients?
---
Yes, but it can still be changed locally, so it would be trivial to bypass.
---
If it works, it's not supposed to. If you click them all in a short time it will work but you still aren't supposed to have more than 1 account open at a time if there is an alpha involved.
---
Cool :) Can I get the EBR number to wave at people?
---
You're not, no. But unsurprising to hear that CCP is not tracking/enforcing this.
---
Yup, there are sounds. I use them to identify when i should retarget my drones. 
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
unironic racism yikes
---
What is the point of fueling the fire? Gian has  posted his pings, and you can even check out evewho to see that he kicked Diana. Its a moot point by now and there is no reason to keep bringing it up, when its obvious Motc isnt the same. 
---
I don't know if this is love or Salt. or both?
---
I wonder who's the most out of touch of us two...
---
Bots spreading and becoming more and more brings a bigger ISK inflation and causes PLEX sales to spike as much as their price, which leaves legit players with the choice of either get fucked by the bots or finally leave this fucking game.
---
So you are wrong about which of us is out of touch, tho you are right about the fact that EVE has far bigger issues. The fight against bots is long lost for CCP because they can do what they want, bots will prevail, even deleting local is not a solution since scouts on gates and Dscan bots will take the relay.
---
WHAT IS LOVE ?
---
Or... Ore prices are down from a year ago combined with the third nerf to rorqs 18 months ago? You can believe whatever you want, but mining +10 variant ore is now 100 to 120 an hour with max skills and 3 faction drone navs/max drone rigs.
---
Ah yeah, I thought the serpentis sounds were different, it just sounds like high-screeching, though.
---
Guristas Wrestler CCP Falcon is the best one. 
---
&gt;You mean what could go wrong other than what has already gone wrong ?
---
So because some people are breaking the rules, we should let everyone do it? Do you not see the problem with botting either as long as they're restricted to VNIs? Maybe we should let everyone bot!
---
&gt; you can still learn a lot just by observing, listening to FCs, listening on comms
---
That's what i have been doing. And people tell me its wrong and bad and awful and the huge nullsec blocks are pure evil dripping from every one of their awful talons. I've been having fun since moving to null with brave but there isn't any shortage of people reminding me i'm the cancer that's killing this game.
---
&gt;Most big groups don't really expect that much out of you. Even higher tiered ones.
---
Based on my experience so far with them if i were in test instead of brave it would be expected of me that i spent every penny i have on stratop ships and spend all my time logged in being in the main staging system. I can't even imagine how awful it must be in a group like goonswarm where the average member is much richer.
---
&gt;So my advice would be to give that a shot and I hope you find luck like I did.
---
Give what a shot? This goes back to my original frustration, i don't know what i don't know. I've been doing my best getting blown up but its super frustrating instead of fun learning because i can't afford to replace those ships. Every time i lose a Bantam or an Atron i have to grind in my VNI for about 20minutes to replace it. And if i lose a Ares or Malediction i have to grind for around an hour. It would take about 2 hours of VNI grinding to replace my doctrine harpy and about 6 to replace my doctrine Kirin.
---
And before you tell me to stop worrying about it like that and to think about the learning first i can't go into battle in a pod or a Velator.
---
I guess FC is member of PanFam. 
---
why are you also a little racist on the topic
---
yikes unironic racism
---
So you have more accounts in sov-null than npc null?
---
Love. It's all done in love. 
---
my condolences
---
anyone, and ALL people have alts in goons earning lots of isk. goons space has so much isk in it, alot of which must be botting or macro type gameplay at least. goon isk and goon capitals are injected into all of eve. the amount of isk in this game has made it different. i dont like this, neither does many others.
---
i love what goons used to be, yes a power house, ballsey, amazingly well run, plenty of intellegent people running it to a mega IRL corperation standard. it was to awe at. but lately. its not been the case, 
---
i agree with your first part, however, maybe you have only played eve the past couple of years. goons have been around a LONG TIME. and never has it ever been grr goons like it has for me the past 8months. hearing and seeing and finding things out about them just fuels the hate towards what theyve become, and what they give and take from the game.
---
it is not just goons, its the either lazy, or bias CSM. i mean, personally i would prefer CSM be done away with, and ccp to make changes alone. i know the history and why csm is there. but what did it really fix? i want ccps game to be ccps game. its too late now, i guess im butthurt that in a matter of weeks ill unsub. from a game ive played for years. with the main reason being the citadel changes and what it made the game. but the next portion is dedicated to goons. 
---
im sure ill be back, im not biomassing. but ill be back in a few years if eve is here and make a new judgments of the game for me. i would guess the game has hit singularity level gameplay. and will be dead? what do you think? you dont think how goons are looking right now are going to be the group on sigularity that just literally won the game and no one else could even play.
---
If the 6 to 20 minutes thing is true, a-type prices will go up by a lot. 6/10s are the only source of them.
---
Damn, kicked for a ship name that was not even that offensive (at least to 99,99999% of normal populace). That is harsh.
---
Although i understand the kicking after he back-talked the FC. That would get you booted in any fleet. 
---
If you have problem with any oder FC gives, just leave the fleet, or do what he says and you can complain later. Thr reason is, that you as a line member know nothing about the backstage of fleet coordination and that simple small namechange can be crucial for strategic or diplomatical reasons.
---
That is getting retarded if you kick people for that kind of reasons. 
---
Hypervisor isnt really the problem, you need a GPU which supports sr-iov (Single root io virtualisation) 
---
I'm not trying to fuel any fire, I'm just not looking the other way and saying it never happened either. 
---
The fact that you think most players actually pays for their subscription through PLEX is all you needed to say. Congratulations. You played yourself.
---
lol
---
t. gotg haha oh man
---
I am a casual 3-Account-Pleb, that uses his 2 other accounts for other stuff often, ya know like waiting for Tau and Hy to ping ;-), so I am glad I can solo them, but as of current CCP meta I would have been surprized if there had been no possibility to max out with multiboxing ...
---
'this year to date' implies 5200 bans in 2019 i think? 
---
That's actually the problem, like, it's been a popular belief now that VNI = bots. I mean, VNIs have always existed, afk VNIs for almost as long, and now suddenly it has become the problem all of a sudden, wohoo... 
---
imagine spending your time arguing with goons over how much a qual makes 
---
Okay, so are you actually totally clueless or are you just retarded ? Lost of players play thanks to PLEX, I didn't invent anything.

Please point to the part that is racist, and here's a hint, governments aren't a race.

This is perfection
---
Hallo my name is Raven , Raven 644 you want an upvote?
---
It was motivational banter. PL wanted to kick TEST in the teeth long before Frat had any investment in it.
---
I get your point, but most people just can't afford to pay for 10 extra accounts. But most people can run 10 _clients_, if they were free.
---
The only reason multiboxing is allowed otherwise is because they pay extra, and that has always been the case in online games.
---
YESSSSSSSS
---
GOON PROPAGANDA CCP LOVE GOONS OMG REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Holy hells
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
So in other words, you just have a hate (based obviously at least in part on things you've heard - one of which has already been proven to be completely false).  You're letting that hate consume you and ruin your game - not because of any actual impact to you, but because of your obsession.
---
You definitely should take a break for a while.  Get some perspective.  As I say often about real world social issues - if people spent as much of their focus on how they live their own lives (or, in this case, play their own game) as they do obsessing about others, then the world (in this case, the game) would be a much better place.
---
That's why a scan down every system I enter them MTU"s are like finding gold bars sitting on the sidewalk.

Your brain:This post is a good idea.
---
Do it!
---
keep yourself safe 
---
did you actually read my last comment?
---
and sorry, had something been proven? as so far, all thats happened is some rando is complaining about eve on reddit AGAIN. and some rando is saying he is correct and someone else is wrong. proof? 
---
if somone said to you they would double your isk if you lent it to them for a few days, would you believe them?
---
I don't krab so got yah!
---
Why don't we put a 80% tax on those with over a trillion isk in their account to pay for it and let's make clones free to upgrade so we don't lose skill points. Also all accounts down for over 3 years have all their hangar items put up for auction to pay for "hangar fees"
---
Warp to Me FC’s are a bunch of inbreds anyways, your friend is better off 
---
"REEEEE" is definitely well-known as a derogatory jab at autistic kids.  Even Reddit casuals know this.
---
That being said, it wasn't as if he was calling the guy out for being insensitive to autistic kids.  Sounds like he explained why he was requesting the name change.  If the pilot wasn't in the mood to comply with one of the guys running the fleet, then he definitely had no business remaining in the fleet.
---
It's not a democracy.
---
Also, I'm not saying whether either of these guys were being dicks.  But, if I had to judge, I would say this is more on the pilot than the FC.  You do realize that "REEEEE" can be extremely offensive to some people, right?  And rightly so?  Just because you aren't offended by something doesn't mean someone can't be justified in being offended by the same thing.
---
And if you were an FC, and offended by something someone said/did, and you asked them to stop, and they refused, and you kicked them, you wouldn't want to have to defend yourself to someone on the internet who can't see things from your perspective or put themselves in your shoes, which is what you're failing to do now.
---
Noob here, why are VNI's the preferred ratting ship?

I'm not contesting that PL wanted to evict TEST, I'm just pointing out that Fraternity also did.
---
Whether that was a homegrown desire or just noraus following orders from his handlers doesn't really matter as far as TEST is concerned. Fraternity wanted and tried to participate in evicting TEST, and then lost miserably.
---
I don’t think western people can grasp how much this single exam could mean to one in China. It essentially will define you and your career for the rest of your life. Every year there are dozens of stories of kids jumping off a building because they fucked up that exam. Can you imagine the kind of things that would make you jump off the building if you fked up?
---
I would also like to point out that this happened in a relatively rural part of China. The regional difference across China is huge, and these are the parents who had never gone to university themselves and dropped out of high school to work in the farms. Their children doing well is one of the few ways the family could be lifted up in the social hierachy. But cheating in the Gaokao exam is actually a very serious offence and is punishable by jailtime. At the time of this incident it also received widespread attention on the Chinese social media and people were just as appalled as you guys are.

No worries mate, you too :) Hoping to bump into you guys sometime soon
---
Never, the csm is their token “we listen to you, we give a shit what you think/say/feel”
---
But on upside, there are some new skins for sale in the store....
---
Idk how to feel about a borg falcon.........i love it 
---
You keep using that word, but i don't think you understand its meaning.
---
Why do many people like and dislike rorquals? I'm a noob.
---
Stain guy, i agree with a lot of your posts, but you are wrong here.
---
A single falcon can devastate any fleet that has less then 7 logi.
---
It hurts a fleet even more if it has Basis/Guards.
---
by the time the cruise missile reaches him, he will have deleted his post.
---
Oh they do and it's glorious. 
---
I thing im going to find all these meme pictures today and have a good laugh and get stared at like a crazy person.
---
This is the best yet
---
Why not spread out in the many systems your alliance owns?
---
So did GotG. Those were fun days. It is about time things started heating up.
---
Nah, not Cell. 
---
Very busy, but good :)
---
Yeah, where is our free 1million SP?
---
EBR-173034
---
Lmao wtf, my alt flies a mach with the name "HIV+ Bloodfart" and i never get kicked from fleets. Are you sure this guy was not also being super toxic on comms?
---
Are you kidding, or being serious here? It took me 1hr with 2x meta Abaddons and 1x Dominix to reinforce it. And no Augmented drones, for sure, mostly Ogre IIs, but Federation ones should work well as well.
---
and if he named it weeeeeeeeeee something about an Asian insulting autism.
---
fuck these guys and their propensity to dig hard and look for fault or offense.    
---
They've killed "nice" stuff but lost way more in return. Sure. Attach a low sec gate to Stain I guess. Feed us more kills an make TEST look even better.
---
ewwww
---
Devil's advocate: One of the perks of being a public incursion FC is the ability to exercise authority capriciously. 
---
On the other hand, the theme of EVE is a mixed bag of autists learning how to function in a social group without retreating to their safe zones. We quickly learn to HTFU, and that claiming to be offended is not an effective way to influence others. Because at the end of the day 
---
&gt; I'm offended
---
is a statement of helplessness that translates to 
---
&gt; I'm incapable of handling my own emotions and demand that other intervene on my behalf.
---
And who wants to be burdened with that shit in a game?
---
you're a fucking snowflake
---
Source : TVP FC for 4 years, never once kicked someone because of a ship name. If the name is that offensive, you report it and let CCP deal with it.
---
no I had no idea about reee.
---
not sure how people give others the power to offend them anyway.  
---
despite this being a serious matter weren't those fucking "cyno is lit" poems banned from r/Eve?
---
I mean, if you are the only hel/nyx that rats in a system, nothing has changed, lmao
---
Are you just going up an down the thread mumbling about racism on every comment? 
---
shssss.....let him spin that theory
---
Gotta up my blood pressure meds after this post.
---
Its just /u/ccp_falcon whispering into his mic with different background sounds. CCP really upped the creep factor on this shit.
---
I went to rat in curse, and it was just falcon saying "one day you will see me for all the glory i am" with weird static in the back.
---
Best drone ship in the game, in a cost/dmg ratio I mean, With drones been the best PvE weapon, and speed/capstable tanking anoms is possible, soo an AFK isk printing machine.
---
#RRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE^EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
If your logi is facing a good ewar wing, I guess you could say you're... in a jam.
---
yeah he is
---
~~Bad~~ ~~Good~~ Bad Bot
---
Some people don't care if others are offended (see the other comment to my post), some people don't care enough to get offended in the first place (myself and you, it sounds like), and some people would be offended, or at least recognize it could offend others.
---
It doesn't really matter why he did it if no one cares enough to ask why, and just starts criticizing and saying he was a dick.  If your default is just to criticize and fight against someone you don't agree with, without understanding why they did it, then you're (not you, hypothetical you) the dick.
---
Bruno Ganz.
---
I guess that one went over your head.
---
Yeah, a T2 rigged hel went for like 11.5b a few days ago. That's nuts lol
---
I would argue that ESSs are not at all the same. They rely on a deployable structure and actually *increase* the isk generated by ratting. 
---
I am talking about an honest to gods loyalty point system, where people nativelly earn loyalty points, or the equivalent (just like mission runners) that can be 'cashed in,' in combination with isk, to get items and bpcs that the ratter can then sell. 
---
If balanced correctly they could maintain the relative 'value' of rats, or even increase it, while simultaneously reducing the amount of isk in the game via lowered bounties, *or* at a minimum sink isk out of the game to mitigate the faucet that is ratting bounties.  
---
i just want more midslots and PG and CPU for it..
---
I just want to point out something without responding to the guy calling everything racism that its possible to critique a culture without critiquing a race.
---
I also want to say that botting and RMT was very much a problem 8 years ago but CCP at the time actually hired people to combat it.
---
I distinctly remember black legion doing it during the fountain war.
---
Those eyes
---
Imagine actually spending the time to make this turd of a post.
---
Wallet history only goes back one or two months

They don't if you use a different layout.

haha idiot horse man not understand it is for ELITE PVP hunter to adapt if he shall want to farm newbro in carrier pilot.

\&gt; guys dont say the n word you might offend white people 
---
Oh it does? Well that might help then. Gives me time to practice too. 
---
And that is why the player base in eve has been stifled for years. I can't remember last time eve hit 60K, let alone 1Mil plus like other MMORPG's.
---
If there were more New Player corps like PH, Karma, Brave &amp; RvB and less WTM, TVP style groups eve would be way more popular today.
---
I didn’t know reeee had anything to do with jabs at autistic people, I must be super casual )) 
---
My sincere condolences.
---
His comment history is just one long cringe inducing litany of slurs and epithets. This dude just screams edgelord, but then again, what do expect from Horde.
---
Theres a reason I stopped flying with them at all.   
---
This is amusing as hell too, I have named a few ships REEEEE over the years because my Corp/Alliance leader says it all the god damn time

now all we need is someone to do the falcon scream

They feel that way about everything, that's the whole point of the ideology.

And?

I can’t, tell me about it.

I like trains.

Choo choooooo
---
It's highsec incursions. "Strategic" and "diplomatic" reasons have absolutely fucking nothing to do with it, and it's all run from a public channel so even calling OP a "line member" is a bit of a stretch since he's almost certainly not actually in an alliance with anyone else in the fleet.
---
TBh don't run with them, but i see people in stuff like bunch of kestrels  running them. 
---
I think biggest number will go to higsec piracy.
---
Brave has aussies and we're full of spies. You'll fit right in!
---
They’ll be gone in a few days and some are pretty creative. Some lower effort ones have been culled. You can ride out the wave with us for another 24 hours at least.
---
So what you're saying is bring back CCP Sreegs.
---
I concur.
---
LOL, that one just never gets old.
---
You must be a Bernie fan. 
---
It's their fleet, they can make their own rules.  Just sayin
---
Maybe try a Lord Helmet? 😀
---
No IRL politics ITT. Keep it at least *loosely* related to Eve / games.
---
For the most part Angel Carrel ships deal mostly explosive then kinetic. Some Angel Cartel ships have EM missiles which could cause issues if you are shield tanked and left your em hole open. There are websites to check the stats of NPC ships such as  http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/npc_ships.php
---
Guri Burner kites with 3.5k speed at 40km if you do not get tackle on it, i cannot imagine 5 LM-Kestrelas can
---
1. kill it - because of shitty application
---
2. tank its over 200 dps long enough (my Worm with 86% Kin Resist and Gist-A-Type SB needs some heat cycles on SB sometimes)
---
But yeah I guess its just the point how many Accounts you want to multibox, basically what CCP wants ...
---

---
Let me get this straight, you are getting upset for someone else because they didnt follow the instructions from the FC?
---
So now you are White Knighting him on r/eve to call out percieved SJW's in the game?
---
How about this, both you and the SJW whiners BOTH fuck off?
---
If you are unhappy about an FC dont fucking fly in his fleet. Hey look issue solved for both the whiney bitch and the guy who named his ship stop bitching about how "Unfair" the fc was and the FC.
---
YOU need to harden the fuck up because if THIS is gonna be the thing thats going to make you run crying about how unfair people in Eve are to r/eve wait till you finally play the game.
---
Jesus christ. If the choice is between SJW's and White Knights like you who take up any fucking cause at even the slightest insult I dont have to choose because you are both the fucking same.
---
Incursion community is shit. Today you learned.
---
They where kinda funny at first, but are now getting extremely tedious.
---
So the in game wallet shows 90 days history, however the API only shows 30 days. It is likely that any corps that rejected you will have blacklisted you as an alt but it is good practice to revoke ESI access to applications you no longer need (https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001579209-Managing-Access-Permissions-for-Third-Party-Applications-using-SSO)

I'm glad to see there are some folks out there who are more easy-going.
---
Fly safe on your next adventure, capsuleer.
---
I totally agree...but it seems that helplessness can turn into authoritarianism with a teaspoon of power.
---
Your travel time takes up much more though. Unless you are doing guristas, which then you'll only have a 1900-2000 isk/lp conversion. Any other faction and the travel time is so long.
---
I run mine in venal
---
I remember not long after I started, I was living in lowsec doing faction warfare and occasionally some exploartion. One day I found a 4/10 Serpentis DED site and decided to try it out, but of course this was at 3am and I had just eaten a goddamn nuclear weed brownie. 
---
That was the first time I heard the NPC chatter, and it sent me right into The Fear.
---
Like they even really care at this point?
---
Yeah ik, but you take a bit of a hit to isk/hr
---
It’s a game, if you take it too seriously then what’s the point anymore. 
---
Apply to Brave we'll have a look. 
---
If you're not an alt we'll invite if you.
---
Well in that case 70 - 80 per day. Thats definitely more, yet still very little number compared to accounts created. 
---

CCP has decided to start penalizing corps and alliances who are actively and egregiously supporting botting. Check the most recent two security updates.

The only reference to autism in both of these combined is the example of it being MIS-attributed to autism.
---
Incidentally, my son and I are on the spectrum and we don't find this offensive in the least.
---
And why do people reflexively attribute motive to this ambiguous-at-best phrase?
---
Rorquals mine a lot of ore, such as crokite. Perhaps I'm understating it: they suck a *lot* of crok. Because of this, organizations with large rorqual fleets can build large numbers of supercarriers, titans, and other miscellaneous support capitals. Because of this, any group that's sufficiently motivated to log in can actually overcome the supercapital numbers that old, bittervet organizations have built by stealing and retaining the few people who, in the past, were driven enough to acquire their own supercapitals. It puts an end to the situation where being the first ones to acquire supercapitals was paying dividends eternally and said dividends compounding continuously.
---
Join brave - we need fodder for the wa-- er, new bodies to spam rat for the wa-- er, new friends to fly with!

---

---
I like this answer. Must we constrain each other's speech even further than CCP requires? It seems oppressive and un-fun to me.
---
I'm looking at these right now. 
---
As I said above, my son and I are on the spectrum and I can't help but laugh at this \^\^\^
---
What the hell have I missed that created these memes?  This is awesome
---
I've always interpreted "REEEEE" as a jab at people with poor coping skills who freak out over trivialities. Raising the hypothetical spectre of "some people" finding it "extremely offensive" is not a concrete argument to justify censure. Perhaps "some people" could calm down and grow a sense of perspective.
---
I'm not offended by it at all, either.
---
That doesn't mean it couldn't be considered offensive by others.
---
Damn, that is an annoying image hosting site.
---
Ok TheForgeGuy
---
What happened to removing low quality photoshopped memes by the mods in the first place?
---
LoL this is how you shitpost, reee on fuckers.
---
You're appreciated for all you do. Thank you.
---
Ha! Gay!
---
Indeed. If you can effectively shift responsibility for your own emotions onto somebody else, you can then can control that person and they have no recourse except to leave. Because you can claim to feel whatever you want and there's no way to tell.
---
you dont just tell your playerbase you are going to give them 1.5m sp and keep em waiting 
---
I've been waiting for my free 2 million SP for a while now
---
It doesn't offend me at all.
---
I also wasn't trying to justify anything.  Understanding why someone does something doesn't mean you give it credence or condone it at all.
---
Regardless, at the same time, refusing to comply to accommodate someone who COULD be offended by something, when it doesn't affect you in the least other than a couple clicks, makes you a dick.  There's no way to rationalize that other than you don't care if someone's offended, and you're not going to stop offending them, regardless of the ease or minimal effort required.  That's quite a dick thing to do, and if you don't think so, you're probably also a dick.
---
Nope, i fly for a Gallente Corp in Lowsec, and nothing that you say affects me. Current conversion on standard item 3200 ISK/LP, best item (lower market demand) 6000 ISK/LP, traveltime is 1-2 jumps avg. per mission. Lately I had Gurista Burners in the same system.
---
cultural victory obviously 
---
All your ISK will be assimilated
---
Wait, so you came to /r/eve to cry about it?
---
Jesus, your life must be tough.
---
I wanted it to shed some light on a culture clash in a single shard MMORPG; moreover, what we see as a problem (botting) is seen elsewhere as a necessity to remain competitive. Thanks for moderating it to keep the retarded ethnophobic comments removed.
---
CCP blessed us with this on the launcher https://i.imgur.com/iS9ofiY.png
---
is dscan even a thing in high sec incursions?
---
and i'd argue autism is not looked down upon as a derogatory in Eve, quite the opposite.
---
the most successful pilots, miners, ratters, wormholers are full on autistic in their behavior.
---
This is from Noraus last year, you may know him, he’s your alliance leader: https://imgur.com/a/6iEPUFB

---
You made the conscious decision to join a corp with that name and you're acting like this came as a shock to you? I'm not sure what you're expectations were, but I am sure that you have rocks inside your head
---
I sugggest you join Goonswarm
---
You didn't read your own citation enough.
---
The knowyourmeme link has the info you're looking for.
---
It is widely used to represent reactions of people who are "triggered", overreacting, can't handle conflict or being proven wrong, etc etc.
---
It is also widely attributed to the "screeching sound autistic or retarded kids make" - taken directly from 4chan verbiage.  These are not uncommon attributions.
---
And don't get me wrong, I also don't find it offensive - but I don't grip to the belief that if I'm not offended, then someone who is offended is wrong.  They're not.
---
Normal people are getting fed up with catering to the perpetually offended. That doesn't make them dicks. They've just made the observation that these are irrational people who will always find new things to be offended about.
---
No wonder CCP doesnt care about bots...
---
Does the agency window show all faction warfare systems? I thought there were dozens available, but it only shows me around 10. 
---
Have you applied to dreddit
---
&gt;grumpy
---
What am I crying about? ...someone else getting kicked? I'm just sharing an experience that others may benefit by knowing. I also felt like a little public discussion was in order. Finally, I'm interested in taking the temperature of the players...wondering if I'm the one who's crazy.
---
I put in an application a few hours ago. Fingers crossed 
---
Nor do I. I do think a measure of tolerance is in order, however.
---
Cite your sources for this situation representing someone who is "perpetually offended", otherwise what you're saying is "I see a lot of people offended by things I want to do, so I'm not going to worry if I offend anyone or not, I'm not going to care".  I'd call that a dick thing to believe.
---
Like I said, it's not offensive to me.  But your rationale is lacking. You're grasping at straws to try and justify you or someone else being a dick by presenting no evidence to support your case.
---
This seems kind of racist. 
---
then prove that % of gamers that cheat remains constant across races, you made the first claim so you should "proof or gtfo"
---
so like.... fucking study then if its so hard. What the fuck
---
Seems like he's just mocking petty tyrant FC's running incursions.
---
Your whole post reads like this weird "flip the script" deflection tactic. Do you FC incusions by chance?
---
Well, the fact that it pauses at all is something of an accomplishment for CCP.
---
Amarr
---
What the literal fuck?  I have to believe homie agreed to allowing them to use \*\*that\*\* pic. lol
---
PS: Thanks for clueing me in :)
---
are they wrong once they demand action be taken by another person due to getting offended
---
are third parties wrong for demanding action be taken by another person due to an undefined "some people" "might be" offended 
---
Well, I've personally been popped by Origin while they were blue. Also, ive seen quite a few other Horde guys going the same way. It's not the worst sin in the Eve though, since I've been awoxed more by Vanguard bombers. It's just a good idea not to fly T2/T3 stuff near blue Origin fleets on grid. 
---
/r/shutupandtakemymoney
---
Spoken like every other "freedum of speech" cryhard.  You're also making two cases here: you expect other people to not offend you by not criticizing your right to offend them.  Sound logic.

lol no.

_KNEE SLAPPING INTENSIFIES_
---
I flew with WTM over a year ago for sometime; they were very understanding of new bro mistakes, laid back, etc. If you didn't anchor or something no one screamed or yelled, they just asked you to correct it and explained why. 
---
They were a bit dry and dull in conversation, but that is not a reason to hate on them. Maybe things have changed more recently? 
---
Couldn't tell you the first thing about high sec incursions.
---
Also, I don't doubt the "autistic behavior" evident in tons of Eve activities.
---
SAY *BALANCE-PASS* AGAIN, I DARE YA

One directly introduces liquid ISK into the game....the other does not.

---
&gt;bout you SppRreEaaAdd out, so you know half the games nullsec population cant live in one region.
---
Meh, you know this won't actually encourage that, right? People would already be doing this, to be honest, if anyone wanted to use their expensive shiny ships outside of their super umbrellas--most people do not. 
---
Therefore, what you will actually see is people trying to make isk other ways, be that through injecting in to Rorquals, or switching back to VNI/Ishtar ratting, which incidentally, CCP may be discouraging people from super botting with this, but... they are actually encouraging botters to just move to VNIs/Ishtars. 
---
Note I do not have a dog in this game. I sometimes rat in my Nyx when I am really bored, but 99% of my isk is actually generated from trading/importing/exporting.

I'm not whiteknighting anything. That guy doen't mean anything to me except a shame and a waste. I think it sucks that these people who are claiming to protect other people crap on someone for something so trivial (and ambiguous)...don't you find it just a little ironic? Also, I'm taking the playerbase temperature to see if it has gone round the bend and this has become normal or if there are different people worth spending time with out there.
---
I don't know, I'm not a philosopher.
---
But, if someone is offended by something that is definitely being used derogatorily (which it obviously was), and someone placed in the authority position (which the FC was) asked the offending party to stop, and the offending party refused, and was subsequently removed from the facilitated group, then that's not being a dick.  That seems like the least dick part of this whole discussion, in my opinion.
---
But, then again, some people rail against having to give up their "liberties" to accommodate others.  It makes them feel like something is being taken from them and given to others (which it kinda is) regardless of the actual outcome.  Some people are selfish to the point where they'd rather argue and whine and complain and criticize other than accommodate the offended party.
---
He never even spoke on comms. They jumped him before inviting him to fleet.
---
* Pretty cheap
---
* Heavy drones
---
* Can fit 100mn
---
* Can AFK farm
---
I would argue that a measure of consideration is in order, because that's what the person in authority (the FC) stipulated.  It was a constructed social structure.  One person was asked not to offend.  They refused to stop offending.  The authority of that social structure then punished them.  If we're talking about who's the dick, then based on that data, the offender was obviously the dick.  There's no rationale or logic to state otherwise.  Regardless if it's heavy-handed or what-not, do you side with heavy-handed or do you side with selfish and inconsiderate?
---
It baffles me everytime I see this shit happening: people with the smallest bits of power in their hands are the most ruthless in using and abusing it. 
---
I can add that to our rules as it seems to follow my vision. We're still getting off the ground so any rule changea can still happen at this point. :]
---
There's also some escalations almost no one runs as well as the pseudo 6/10s like the Serpentis Logistical Outpost.  (so expect the a-types to be around that price?)
---
And of course you could scan down 6/10s.
---
Annnnnd, everybody is now offended.
---
I cant believe this subject is even a thing.
---
Is this a Wally Reddit alt?
---
&gt;others, even if there
---
Maybe, but as others have said this was a result of a game change players actually wanted, "please incentivize  us to live in the space we own." Now that this has been done, as I stated somewhere else, people have really seen the benefits of earning money under a supercap umbrella.   
---
Ergo, my guess is that, at least in the short term, you will see an uptick in the cost of skill injectors and more Rorquals on the field rather than any spreading out. This is because the benefits of the super cap umbrellas outweigh any perceived benefit in enlarging sovereignty space and if that means either diluting the super cap umbrellas, or it means people will have to run anomalies \*outside\* of umbrella range. 
---
Long term affects on the metagame are harder to predict, and will depend on a number of both emergent factors and other changes CCP might make. 
---
We'll get another mention about balance passes, without any actual balance passes.
---
Too soon...
---

---
Don't know if this help, but those kestrels have jamms
---
Isn't like 99.9% of the eve player base autistic anyway? 
---
That could be next year
---
Its called hype. No one really thinks we could evict TEST or Goons  in this day and age without all of Eve joining in against them.
---
Shouldn't it be the judge instead of jibrish, ya know cause Vader cuts off his hand and all?
---
Prolly around the same time we get shield slaves.
---
Was expecting a Sansha battleship joke, left disappointed
---
They will only after you biomass
---
screw off, pls &amp; thx
---
No one registered a complaint. It was done proactively. So, the confrontation was unnecessary. They chose to offend someone and materially affect them so as to protect someone who may or may not be there at all and, if there, may or may not take offense. 
---
? No it's not. Do you always label something racist when it's not decrying the crimes of the straight, white male?
---
It's a piece of text explaining why a certain culture has prevailing charateristics. Like, when I say that Adidas sportswear is a popular clothing style in eastern Europe because of an Olympic event, would you say that this is racist?
---
whining about MUH FREE SPEECH is just as annoying as getting kicked for a ship name cmm
---
Have an upvote wise stranger.
---
I'm not expecting anything of other people lol wut
---
I'm pointing out that complying with the demands of others, if you do not agree with their reasoning, should not be done 
---
A number of reasons. Primarily, I would argue there are three main factors here:
---
1.) For a large minority of null sec players, this is their sole source of income in game, and change is hard;
---
2.) People do not want to attempt to run anomalies, or risk highly expensive ships, outside of their alliances supecap umbrella range; and
---
3.) Supercapitals are not what they used to be. Their utility with the proliferation of Titans and the advent of FAXes in PvP is much, much more limited than it used to be. Combine this with the fact that to fly one well represents a huge investment in skill points, I think it is probably fair to say that people who have so invested millions of skill points in these ships are kind of upset that one of the main roles left to these ships has been significantly nerfed.
---
You can count me as among those who feel upset because of point three. Even though my primary source of income in eve is trading, I sometimes rat in my Nyx when I am bored. Now, I just sort of feel I want my skill points back, all of which I earned the hard way--without injectors--on my 125 million sp main. 
---
In my daily life, I don't have that much contact to people I don't know.
---
And in private,  I'm rather secluded.
---
Dude, leave poor CCP Falcon alone. He's cool.
---
:) we love Falcon. 
---
**Anything** can be offensive to other people. The trick is not to give a flying fuck. So you're offended? Cool, now what?
---
Conveniently that's literally what happened.
---
That's part of why I bring it up. I'm hoping my experience of a couple weeks is anomalous and not representative of WTM nor Eve in general. 
---
Years ago, Eve was a VERY edgy place. It added a lot of "diversity" to the mix and had a certain allure/mystery/unpredictability. I kind of feel like I came back to the Star Wars series after leaving off with Empire Strikes back a few years ago, only to be re-introduced to the series by JarJarBinks as Emperor Palpatine and the Ewoks as his extremely annoying storm troopers.
---
Maybe a good Samaritan will tell me where I can find the edgy Eve if there is any left.
---
lol, well done.
---
...it is region locked.  It's the only country that is (due to Chinese laws), VPNs just exist which makes region locking ineffective.
---
Hi Serinus how you doing?
---
And smarter than the general population by a standard deviation...agreed.
---
Unless someone actually values freedom of speech at all.
---
Actually i already stated that when there will be created a NPC lowsec gate to Stain (aka normal gate) i will remove StainGuy 
---
are you telling me the paste eating brain dead neckbeards of null are smarter than average humans
---
we're fucking doomed. 
---
Can’t wait to see the new thing they will cancel to focus on balance.
---
Can't blame them at all, but you can highlight Imperium for how to tweak balance. 
---
I cant fc my drones nevermind an Incursion fleet. F1 monkey 4 life.
---
My point is this. FC setout what rules he wanted to set for fleet membership. Dont like the rules, dont join.
---
Depends on the group.  In plenty of alliances, yes, because edgelords just make drama and it's better to just punt them than deal with the bullshit they foster.
---
Be an adult and ignore it. :)
---
Dunno, but you got an upvote from me.
---
It is interesting cultural insight and I enjoyed reading it. 
---
Omen fleet with apostle soon again, come join 
---
This photo explains so much of what is happening in all my worlds..........
---
"Sir, we have to arrest you, you have murdered a person."
---
"You can't, someone has murdered before. So long as something was done by more than a single actor, nobody can ever be criticized for it."
---
The FC is free to foster whatever environment he wants on his fleets as far as I'm concerned.  Kicking someone for not playing ball is the gentlest way of responding to the refusal.
---
tell a random guy on the street to f1, odds are they cant.
---
Choooooooooo
---
Choooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
See, I'd rather fly with this guy ^^^... so much more fun.
---
I am sorry for your loss.
---
Godspeed Daedelus51
---
Was mine culled as well? https://i.imgur.com/XyApjRq.png  Can't see it in new posts :(
---
It's a fucking video game run by a company, in a fleet operating at the whim of the FC.  Check your free speech a couple doors ago.
---
they'll cancel Eve pulse to focus on balance 
---
now how do you feel 
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region/planets
---
you'll have to add them up cause i'm lazy. 
---
As long as they don’t actually focus on balance after they do it that would be in line with the ccp we know.
---
\*beep\* \*beep\* Paging Shadow Cartel...
---
Your fleetmate that got kicked was being a baby, you should have included his name so all of us could have benefited by knowing what sorts of manchildren to avoid.  I certainly don't want to fly with a petulant dick like that.
---
But even that twit didn't come to reddit and write four giant whiny paragraphs about it.
---
Consider the temperature taken.  I'm not surprised at the reaction it is getting, and you're being obtuse if you are.  You got your outrage for your poor, put upon fleetmate.  Enjoy it.
---
It has other uses than gaming which makes it worthwhile leaving on. It's a media server, and also acts as a backup for most of my family's laptops, so even if it worked properly, I'd probably still have it on all day.
---
This didnt happen to you.
---
Wasnt raised as an issue by the person who it happened to.
---
And yet here you are trying to defend someone who probably A) Doesnt know the the post exists and B) Doesnt care. So yeah you are white knighting.
---
Alao you want to turn this into an anti SJW hunt for your own fun and are trying to raise r/eve to your side.
---
Quit complaining about the slightest percived issue and stop trying to turn it into your marching banner.
---
FC's can kick who they want from their fleet.
---
Pilots are free to not fly with FC's they dont agree with.
---
You are putting your personal dislike of SJW's ontop of that and trying to rally people to be angry at them with you.
---
You might find the [static data export (SDE)](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources) useful.
---
Oh wow people on the internet say mean words crazy stuff that
---
Where is the rest of the fight though?
---
If reality were as absolute as your statement, Eve would be over tomorrow.
---
I'm thinking there must be a better way of reducing farming safety over and above a single player with 60 or so accounts camping every system in Delve?  
---
Having said that I was part of Boat's NGSA that camped Deklein so I can't really complain about cloaky-camping.  That was several hundred players though, as a prelude to war, not 1 guy with mental health problems (not boat, Marshy).
---
I don't know what his problem is to be honest.  He's hurting the wrong people.  He can't hurt the guys really minmaxing, with super ratting and Rorquals - they get saved by the umbrella.  He's hurting the little guys who maybe do a little ratting or salvaging, or mine in subs.  Not everyone in Delve has multiple Rorqs.
---
Do you think I'd attract griefers if I wore some outrageous bling in my character profile?
---
Press F ;/
---
Hope him a good way to the valhalla!
---
Condoleance to your corp and his families.
---
Both wtm and tvp are dead and absolutely irrelevant size-wise.
---
I honestly can't tell is this is satire.
---
&gt; Meh, you know this won't actually encourage that, right? People would already be doing this, to be honest, if anyone wanted to use their expensive shiny ships outside of their super umbrellas--most people do not.
---
False. People were super ratting and Rorqual mining before umbrella space became the ultra safe spaces it is. They were doing it in alliances like FCON, Provibloc, SOLAR, BOT, etc. They were losing about 15-20% of their income to offenders. You can think of it as a "content tax". Once umbrellas solidified, these people realized they could move in that space and get away with 3-5% "content tax". And that's exactly what they did. They moved into tax havens.
---
Now, you are saying that if tax havens were removed people would stop doing business. Meanwhile, all that would actually do is removing 3%-5% risky space. If you lost 15% of your income in the form of explosions, but that was the safest it can possibly get in nullsec, you would still mine/rat in nullsec because that income still lucrative for many reasons such as afkability, ease of access, and still decent ISK. And CCP can even buff isk/hr after ensuring no space is safer than 15% content tax.
---
Did he say jump?
---
Second off. Any corps recruiting beside the obvious? Looking to get back on my feet and get back to wormhole living if possible. 
---
what refusing an FC command?
---
Lowsec gate to Stain?
---
Not this again....
---
Fucking Amarrians always bitching they want more slaves
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
The issue WAS indeed raised by the guy who got kicked. 
---
I don't know what else to call someone who whiteknights for non-existent players who did NOT raise the issue.
---
I also don't know why you are whiteknighting for SJWs in your posts. If I offended you, I sincerely apologize, but I can't think of another name for the whiteknighters of WTM other than "guyswhowhiteknightforautismandprobablyeverythingelseatthedropofahat"
---
Well reading isn't you strong point so I'll address this to your carer so she can translate to Mongoloid. 
---
"Hi. I'm sorry you are stuck with a retard of this high a level. When you are finished wiping the shit from his lips after he finished shitting his pants can you explain to him in the simplest terms he can understand (And I know that's not much considering the brain damage he got from being beaten by his father in the womb that when i tell 2 side to both fuck off it mean i hate each side equally? By the way a pillow over the face can be explained away if its tucked between the wall and the bed after. Just say he had a fit, no one gives a fuck about genetic mistakes like him anyway."
---
Speaking 9f features every other gaming sub has but eve mods haven't implemented, when are we getting flair for threads with a ccp response?
---
I think signal cartel will come to your aid if you contact them.
---
To my understanding you can continue to fly the ship until you dock or something. Not sure if moduals offline themselves but I think it should be obvious from where you're sitting.
---
Good luck.
---
CCP PLZ
---
So basically:
---
FC: "please change your ships name because it doesn't fit into our internal culture"
---
Dude: \*does some petty passive aggressive shit*
---
FC: "ok, you're out. bye."
---
You: "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SJWs ruining my game!"
---
ur main is a super pilot....lmao ur baseline is so wrong i cant find words
---
It's just that, I feel like Reddit is a place to discuss stuff.
---
That's amazingly horrifying.  The right eye needs to come down just a little imo but otherwise pretty damn good. 
---
What?  You literally do not have "freedom of speech" in EVE.  CCP can ban you for whatever they want, including if you say something they don't care for.  
---
Feel free to explain to me how "freedom of speech" applies to EVE (or any other privately-run MMO).
---
Ten years ago people used to say Harden the Fuck Up.
---
Now they kick you for having a ship name that would only be offensive to a perma-triggered SJW on crack.
---
No, I just feel like WTM, as an open community ought to be more welcoming of diversity. That's all.
---
Did they hurt your feelings?
---
I would prefer some sort of siphon unit that mines slowly or destroys the rocks yields eventually the rock like a structure venture. I dont think a SHIP should be able to do it. Thats broken. Im thinking a fleet of bombers bar bombing a whole site for the lulz. That would totally be a thing. I could see goons making a sig to do just this with they're gorilla war unit. 
---
But yea ccp balancing it right.. Come on.. Lol this would be something they would need a team to manage weekly at least.. 
---
And a bomber with a bombtruck can hold infinite bombs! Lol only limiting factor would be cost of bombs.. And in this day and age of t1 mats being pennies.. Is that a good move? Lol. 
---
And yes we can argue the rorq is a problem but we dont have enough data to really tell imo. The only problem I have with it. Its N+1 potential.. In theory with enough you can panic forever..
---
Do you want a list?
---
I can give you a list.
---
i think we had a damn good run for a few years thanks
---
There is, its called PI
---
Nice try humble bragging about your reading speed /s
---
Doing it for the meme as well XD. Can we get a best in show as chosen by you once the folks have had their fill? 
---
Thanks! 
---
Made a point to try a few vendors during fanfest. Was not disappointed. 
---
Not necessarily true.
---
CCP can force alliances to spread out, yet ensuring there is still unused space for small entities to make their entrance in nullsec (which was the aim of the previous change). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) is how.
---
Also, the previous change pretty much failed with respect to its own goals.
---
No bowl, Stick!

Fit rapid heavy missile launchers ii and go pew pew with it

8. Readymix concrete powder
---
I remember when anoms were their way of helping the individual line members survive in and actually occupy their space in Null. This almost sounds like a level 4 mission and HS incursion boost as it'll force the guys who can't get enough anoms to pay for their next kiki to make their isk in highsec.
---
I suppose some will move into exploration but that'll quickly become tedious for most, so exp income shouldn't suffer much.
---
&gt; He's hurting the little guys who maybe do a little ratting or salvaging, or mine in subs. 
---
I fly with him. We literally killed 8 supers in 12 days. They were not "little guys". We also kill/steal excavators of those Rorq multiboxers.
---
"Little guy" and "big guy" alike, there is value in diminishing the safety of these regions because they are safer than hisec and this is hurting the game in many ways atm.
---
its cool to be a dick as long as you all follow the group think is what is sounds like.
---
OP missed this because they left after nothing was done when it was initially brought up as an issue. These screenshots we're after the fact.
---
I feel threatened, rrrrrrrrreeiibbit
---
Shame, dude. Disappointing to see you support this.
---
I keep logging in to apply my 3 million SP to my 12th Rorqual alt, but no dice so far.
---
I heard Havens in higher than -0.5 have a 30 minute respawn timer.
---
Good point though i’m suddenly poorer
---
&gt;First of all, when I look up REEE, most definitions say it is a defensive sound frogs make when they are threatened.
---
lmao, no one thinks that's what anyone means when they say that.
---
Sigh *unzips*
---
&gt; Nah. We'll just keep the super umbrella in place
---
There's always the option of having a couple of umbrellas. With as many people in alliance having caps and above, it shouldn't be that hard to set up. 
---
check evejobs. what's your tz? 
---
join a Wormhole corp 
---
I dunno about anyone else, but I think the injectors and excavator drones broke the game. Until ccp realizes that, I’ll not give them another dime. So yeah, if they did bring a smaller server that was more old school, I’d sign up. But I figure instead they will send me emails about the new skins available in the store, 
---
if u got 1000M isk per month maybe you'd have more time to make a good post
---
but what if u got 1b a month by playing other games
---
Why the hostility? I'm totally sincere.
---
Mountain time. Western Canada. 
---
If you came back after a break and found yourself stuck in WH space, you used to be able to file a support ticket with CCP and they'd move one ship to K-space along with the contents.  Not sure if they still do that, but you might give it a shot.
---
That's what I'm sensing with all the hostility.
---
Not at all...I feel like you didn't read the post. 
---
Nah, you're not.
---
Yeah, like all the other content in /r/EvE isn’t completely fucking retarded and the dank Falcoon memes are the problem 
---
It's not about preventing tidi, its preventing crashing due to ram overusage. 
---
Switch back to old reddit.
---
Moon mining is the easiest to get into. 50-100m an hour per t1 procurer on R16 moons and up.
---
Gas mining is harder to do when you don’t live in w-space.
---
Hmmm. That would be awesome. Thanks for the idea! Problem is that my implants are expensive so I'll probably want to get the pod home too. 
---
Yeah they (used to) move you and your ship, so your implants would be safe.
---
But again I don't know if they still do this.
---
no u
---
Sure, I have freedom of speech within the parameters defined by CCP. If CCP banned accounts for all speech, there would be no Eve nor CCP. You seem to be making the assumption that I intend to mean legally enforceable freedom of speech without explicitly stating it. But, I simply mean that I have a degree of personal discretion about what I communicate in Eve...which is true.
---
Avoid wormhole corps.
---
I think we should add jump fatigue to the game
---
Make it so number one
---
Step one: Raven    
---
Step two: Self-dstruct    
---
Step three: Get in anything Amarr.    
---
Be victorious!
---
Sincere condolences
---
I want my 6 million SP right now
---
my guess is that people got away w/ it because they couldn't tell somehow but can now so they're giving folks a chance to save themselves 
---
&gt; This seems kind of racist. 
---
The poster is Chinese as well. I guess you think he's some white guy decrying Chinese successes or something? It's not racist to point out the society you live in has serious flaws. 
---
Never leave home without a probe launcher, some probes and a mobile depot in the cargo hold.
---
Also alphas are allowed to fly battleships now thats why.
---
Yes.  CCP curtails some amount of your free speech at the door.  Alliances may curtail more at their door.  Corps, same.  FCs may curtail more of it at their door.  All of this is fine, because it's a big world, and we can choose what level of shitbaggery we want to deal with.
---
If you want to play in those increasingly small groups, you play by their rules, or they choose not to play with you, as they've made a choice about who they want to deal with.  Your freedom of speech is entirely checked by the fact that you're asking to play a game run by someone, and further asking to play with specific people.
---
Check out the NREM channel in game once you get settled. Let's talk
---
I kind of just up and quit one day out of the blue so when i left my citadel to rat that day I didn't expect it to be the last time haha
---
whatever you do, don't join or avoid wormhole corps. 
---
FCs job is not to define what is or is not OK as ship name. If the Fleet has a doctrine name (for acknowledgment or dscan) then yes. Otherwise you can call your ship what ever you want as long as it is not against the law or game rules 
---
Go easy on him, I think he has a condition.
---
Not downvoting you but I'd like to point out that the trope that only Americans do this is stupid. Pretty much any relatively successful country has a large population of people who hesitate to be critical of their homeland.
---
I imagine you're being downvoted partly because there are Americans who are tired of always seeing America tagged as the offender. They might even agree with many criticisms but it's getting pretty fucking old.
---
Every week someone dies ... EVE seems to be a retirement home. I would like to know what the average age of EVE players is these days.
---
There are a couple people running Cerberus, it wasnt to my liking. Have to either go RLMLs which leaves a gigantic reload timer and didn't work out, or have not enough space on it to fit cap battery + application module for HAMs and has only 2 rig slots further limiting it. Navy Caracal I have never tried, the otehr ship I haven't tried is Orthus, no idea how that would do.
---
I find your post to be a reasonable representation. I would add to it that this kind of public discussion also has a role to play. When those exercising authority do so in a vacuum, it doesn't lead to self-awareness nor constructive change. My hope is that all people of Eve will engage with each other in mutual respect...which means sometimes tolerating offense, even intentional offense instead of dog-piling on people with differences of opinion or standards of conduct. I think this would be a productive result...though more offense would out there.
---
Are you a chat not?
---
F you ccp for punishing players who are playing the game......
---
this is amazing 
---
Real downvotes come from making questions, apparently.
---
ECmeme ship?
---
&gt; Supercapitals are not what they used to be
---
shedding dudes = spreading out, they will go somewhere 
---
Never number one
---
Dude, I'm on your side of that...which is why I wondered where the down-vote came from.
---
Make it so then
---
you know that there are basically 15 watt TDP out of the box plastic boxes for a few bucks that do just that, right?  
---
&gt; mutual respect...which means sometimes tolerating offense
---
I don't know how you are even trying to parse this.  If someone is being offensive, they're either aware of it (in which case, no, that's explicitly not "mutual respect"), or not.  If they're not, then fine -- give them a chance to correct (as was done).  If they don't, then, again, it's not "mutual respect".
---
You're just saying "tolerate my intolerance".  This example is obviously completely low-hanging fruit, but groups have every right to stamp down on shitty language in their groups because it pushes out people they want to play and/or attracts people they _don't_ want to play with.
---
Time to stop being greedy with the rock havens.  Do 'em all!
---
This is the best one so far, yeah.
---
wait for evesterdam. they got a shitload of events which they have to fill with content. so, just wait for those for the bombshells
---
.....................
---
Having been one type of player or another and living and partaking pretty much in all areas of Eve, except WHs where I did not stick around too long cause I hate too much scanning, I can say it is isn't a simple cut and dry matter. 
---
Its a combination of factors not a single thing. Botting in NS, or anywhere for that matter, affects everyone in the game in a very negative way via broken economy and inflation out of whack. Obviously plex prices, but besides that the HS ISK sources remained static, except Abyss which is now coming down a ton, while prices on everything that is good went up.
---
There are also a lot of bad design choices and technical fuck ups on part of CCP, just look at the last Guardian Gala event as an example, a whole bunch of people unsubbed, some are logging in less or even decided to take a break until CCP straightens all their shit out, if they straighten it out.
---
idk I got mine duder.
---
Sure, but are they going to be ratting in supercaps and mining with excavators outside of our loving embrace? It's unlikely. Given that the entire reason autists are screeching about spreading out is because they want no-risk capital kills, it's fun to tell them about how people will actually react, rather than how they think they will.
---
Ok to all other null alliances, the Imperium now needs your space so be so kind and go back to Highsec. We will escort you with a few of our Titanfleets
---
&gt;  VNIs are not a problem from the alpha POV since you're doing like 12-15m ticks.
---
That's 50m an hour, if you can legally run 10 alphas then a lot more people will be doing that and it's 500m/hr without having to give CCP any money or spend any significant amount of ISK. Currently only people who don't care about the EULA (and know the tricks or are prepared to use VMs/AWS instances/etc) will be doing this.
---
It would be a huge inflation problem and a huge fairness problem.
---
Fly ever safe among the stars.
---
&gt; While i can see how this would reduce the isk flow into the game I'm not sure how this targets the botting game since it motivates people to get into afk VNIs which is indistinguishable from botting.
---
This isn't about botting, it's about low risk high reward ISK generation and the macro-economic effect of that huge ISK fountain. So if it stops people ratting in capitals or supercapitals and reduces the isk flow then it's working.
---
Of course AFK VNI anomaly running needs fixing too (for different reasons) and I hope CCP can work something out for that after only 15 years of failing ...
---
Was it an out of season April fools?
---
so what?
---
who gives a shit
---
I’m in sov null already.
---
Submitted a ticket. Crossing my fingers that they are able to help and I can play once off work. Thanks again! 
---
Train grammar to 5 before calling anyone retarded, post child for abortion.
---
I'm 42
---
Ice mining in nullsec?
---
wait, the only option if you become aware of possible offense that some unknown person might make is to correct it? 
---
Issue is a mix of the moon mining price instability and a slight decompression of ratting and mining in Delve 
---
I allways had sound off when I was playing but about year or two ago when I was visiting drifter nexus in one of those wormholes I turned on the sound that day for muh immersion, upon reaching the vortex effect in final room and messing around with camera angles for screenshots I would hear this weird chatter on just one specific angle and in just that camera position.
---
I tried to mess around with advanced audio options to lower other sounds that interfere with the chatter and I swear I heard that chatter in one of if not the best trailers from CCP and hearing Valkyries, intercept those troop carriers confirmed for me it was from that video.
---
It was repeating timeframe from 2:02 to 2:25 from this [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFTUazuGdTw) 
---
I found that interesting to say the least but shrugged it off for devs must be messing around with explorers or just weird bug. 
---
What are the economics of ice mining in nullsec
---
Uh false, plebian.  I didn't dare touch those filthy rock havens nor did I stoop to such low perversions of multi boxing pve.  I farmed 6/10s from the beautiful and pure rally points
---
Pretty sure Signal Cartel can help you. Get in touch w/them o7
---
If you're gonna claim to respect them and it's entirely trivial... yeah?
---
Can't fly blingy ships without isk  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
can confirm 
---
that almost all the results are in the "lonely chat bot" channel to mess with the bot (and most of it is one guy ) 
---
Don't forget burners are fairly difficult content. 1 fuck up and you lose a blinged ship, not like a Rorqual. Ships are still being lost to burners even today after years of them being solved. The challenge and rewards are actually well balanced. 
---
Abyss and burners are actually good content and are relatively well balanced. Personally I would like to see burners expanded a bit, give them a 1 tier lower difficulty with appropriately scaled down rewards for players that are either lower skileld or can't afford the ships. But that unfortunately can't happen since then they will probably get botted :(  which is a shame, fucking bots ruin so much shit in this game.
---
I'm more of a sanctum man :3
---
I missed the most important step
---
"What we have here is literally the top 1% of the top 1% screaming their lungs out ..."
---
&gt; Pretending ratting is a problem in a game where you can just afk Rorquals and make 200m/h is being retarded.
---
Both are a problem, hopefully rorqs will get a big nerf (or a change to role - they should, imo, be mining command ships which boost others' mining, not miners themselves) in the near future too.
---
What do you mean, blowing up planets?
---
I could probably come scan you out, for money. Otherwise i hear something like eve-scout will come rescue you but i don't know any details cus i'm paranoid and always bring a depot/launcher/probes.
---
context of 20 of those 21 pages is one member feeding a learning chatbot with bullshit 
---
Well said. In my ideal world, risk and reward rise together, with reward rising significantly faster if you do everything right but both still always rising together.
---
This, they're a good group
---
This is entertaining that incursion runners are fully committed to the autism stereotypes.
---
Im shai in the discord you may get some questions but swing by the public channel and say hi
---
Yea, but that's autistic. Most people that do burners don't farm them like this, simply take them as they come while doing otehr stuff.

Maybe you should actually read a bit
---
You got huge balls to make that kind of post when the reddit narrative right now is "REEEEEEEEE RORQ"
---
Right on.  That was more for the people who refuse to run gas havens.
---
Heed the advice of all people below me, at once. 
---
Lol, you attracted a querns propaganda post.
---
People dislike rorqs because they're a very low risk way to generate a lot of wealth quickly without having to actually play the game, to an extent that is unbalanced compared with the rest of the game. Normally high reward requires either risk or active play or both.
---
Rorqs
---
- mine more than anything else
---
- can be invulnerable for 7 minutes on demand
---
- can have a ridiculous tank
---
- can be run AFK
---
Nope, but I'll give you credit. Expected a retarded strawman attempt way before this, so bravo you saved it until you completely ran out of defenses.

Just found an old post. Are you guys still based out of a C4? That was my old haunt and I really enjoyed it.

How long ago was this?
---
From what i understand if a corp is disbanded while owning customs offices they become interbus offices.
---
O they will care, because if they don't more and more people are going to leave and thus their income is going to continue shrinking. Now if they actually manage to do something meaningful about it in time before the amount of people leaving reaches critical mass is another matter entirely.

Well, you're vote positive now. I wonder how many of those were the result of mentioning American faults? ;)

So when I called out both you and the whining SJW's in my first post I in fact wasnt calling out the SJW's just you? Thats what you are trying to spin it as now?
---
So when I said 
---
&gt;How about this, both you and the SJW whiners BOTH fuck off?
---
You, through the use of some Elite Enigma like Decryption machine, have translated it to mean
---
&gt;How about this, both you and the SJW whiners BOTH fuck off (Except the whining SJW's I actually love you and am a card carrying White Knight for you bloated assholes.)
---
As I said fuck Both You (And to u/meatsgood I'll spell out these terms in the dumbest fucking possible terms because you seem to have had issue from the attempted abortion your mother tried during your birth You in this case means people like YOU u/meatsgood and anyone else who tries to brigade shit for their own amusement on r/eve . SJW are the moaning bitching RL Special Snowflakes of the world who cant operate without 100 saftey blankets and 1000 ways to complain to about EVERYTHING.) you and the SJW's who bitch and moan about the slightest small issue and try and turn it into a reason to brigade on r/eve.

As a student who went through crazy shit, you don't get what doing things the "recommended" way does to your mental health for  VERY large amount if young people who aren't ready but regardless have a fuckton of pressure. Many people need to actually live their fucking 20s or they lose their shit. I don't want to spend my 22nd birthday and christmas up all night doing schoolwork but that's exactly what I did and I consider myself pretty relaxed about holding myself up to standards pushed on me by detached people in their 40's.
---
That is not a bad change
---
Valuing freedom of speech because it affords you the ability to not care while offending someone, especially once you know it does offend someone, doesn't relieve you of being a dick.
---
Being afforded the right to say what you want doesn't prevent you from coming across as a moron, an asshole, or a dick.  Which is what the post, and my subsequent comments, had brought up.
---
Snuff has no blues, we are an independent group of brave lowsec warriors.

same difference. krabbing green anoms in kspace is for peasants.

It will at first but not in the long run. Prices for everything will adjust themselves to be in line with lower ISK generation and everything will be back to square one. 
---
What they need to do is completely redesign the PvE itself, give it some actual risks like Abyss or alike. Something that is difficult to bot / script /AFK but relatively easy for people who actually play.

Dang gms takin money out of my carrier fund. Naw i'm jk i'm glad it worked out and you got out.

I read plenty of the thread, manella, and was present in corp during the culmination of this.
---
It's getting tough to read Gian's same comment copied and pasted over and over with minor rewording. It's a spin for a spin. OP is missing detailed context, but 21 pages tells a story of it's own. On the other hand, Gian isn't mentioning that this was brought up several times prior to members leaving, and he laughed about it and did nothing.
---
Acquire groups of wormholes, then join them. 
---
~~&gt;!STOP!&lt;~~
---
Now nothing, case has already been stated.
---
The main point is that OP had stated FC was the dick.  In the prescribed social structure (fleet), that wasn't the case.  Pilot was asked to remedy his purposeful offense, pilot didn't, pilot was asked again, pilot didn't, pilot was removed from the social structure.  The message is that just because you have the ability to be a dick doesn't mean you get treated equal or better than others.  Equity in a social structure is garnered based on treating each other equally, not proclaiming you were treated unfairly because you were punished for being inconsiderate.
---
Selfish anarchy isn't a thing.  There's a reason it doesn't exist.  But you keep trudging on, you may just change the world.

---
Nice! 
---
I know that... 
---
I'm liking it. Only mobile game I play now. Actually play it on phone, tablet and linux desktop. Not anywhere near the depth that EVE has but that would be impossible for a game to match.
---
WTM is the largest incursion community right now and has roughly 100 commanders. Each FC runs fleet differently and some find things offensive that others wouldn't. Each FC has the right to run fleet how they want for the most part and if they ask you to do something then you should do it or just leave fleet instead of making a big deal out of it. you're not going to get along or meet the ideals of every FC in the community and thats the truth of it. find another FC you like flying with because it's pretty narrow minded to make a judgment about a community when it's a large as wtm over one FC you don't agree with.
---
o7 mate, safe travels
---
no bug report number, no fix for you 
---
i wasnt kicked lol and that was obviously in a joking manner which your context shows very nice 
---
If Horde is disorganised, it's only because you need to organize it. Good place to learn to FC incidentally. We are currently fighting init, test, goons, and Gotg on our home turf so there should always be some kind of organized fleet going out every hour. 
---
Oh my god, Yes. 
---
Regardless if there was a complaint at that time - we don't really have that data based on the post and perhaps it was the FC who was offended - it's not good practice to allow something that could be construed as offensive to persist.  There have been studies about this in the real world on the efficacy of such personality traits in social and workplace environments, and the impact they have, even if not directly impacting those involved at that time.
---
Let's say you want your fleet to be the best it could be, and that means getting pilot A to join up.  But pilot B is parading something that offends pilot A.  Now, pilot A is not currently part of that social group, and will most likely never be.  You've lost out of the potential to be better because you've let pilot B continue to be offensive, even if no one present considered it directly offensive to them.
---
Of course, most people wouldn't care.  I wouldn't.  But the argument was who was the dick.
---
Well Done, OP.  This needs to be a print up in CCPs HQ XD
---
Oh no!!
---
They'll take away my SJW White Knight membership card.

Now how will I get free Fro-Yo at Dairy Queen?

---
I can't tell if your comment is satire. TVP is basically dead yea. They really only run VGs at this point but WTM is the largest and most active Incursion community right now and there's really no denying that.
---
o7 may he rest in peace &lt;3
---
I disagree. I can insult you while maintaining my respect for you. My tolerance of your speech that offends me is a byproduct of my respect for you as an individual. I think these are important distinctions that are getting lost.
---
Also, thank you for making a cogent point that is not simply an "F-U". I agree with you that groups have a right to establish their standards of behavior to make their group what they want it to be. In answer to this valid point, I would simply say that WTM is making a mistake with their over-policing of thought-crime and it will negatively impact their smaller group community as well as the broader Eve community...and I think they ought to throttle back instead of ostracizing and ridiculing  the people who spend their valuable Eve time to come fly with them.
---
I don't assert that they have no "right" to police behavior in their group, only that they are making it an un-fun place to be and it has a negative impact on WTM and Eve in general. I think it is a particularly wrong approach to have such ostracism and ridicule in an open community that invites all comers with the motto "don't be a dick".
---
Heed the advice of all people above me, at once.

I was asking to myself the same question ;) SP is always good :)

one day, for no particular reason, I undocked
---
I have a Kikimora and I live in a C2. It seems to not apply, and yet pyfa it works on all WH simulation except for C2.
---
It just shows standard dps for me, no idea why.
---
so they must welcome diversity by disparaging others? If this dude had the right to say it, others have the right to disagree, just happens this dude disagreed with the FC, who is indeed at that moment in the driver seat for the fleet. its hard to make the argument that you can say whatever you want and everyone else has to STFU. The irony here is this situation has resulted due to people being free to do as they please, however, this does not make one free from consequences. 
---
So hot , that is better than dscan, 
---
Lol, this used to be a bug a while ago, it was fixed, AFAIK, but...Hello Falcon my old friend... I've come to talk to you again...
---
So you agree that the SJW thought police is bad for Eve, but you hate me for bringing it up?
---
The pilot made a huge issue about it at the time, not on r/eve.
---
You're a fucking nutjob.

Massive improvement

Go, Navy! ...by the way.

you other MMORPGs can't deny.

Alot of people spend their time being professionaly offended these days because socialists have taken over and made it so that to be offended is to be empowered. If you want to get your own way in life now, just act offended and take the moral high ground.

---
Reminds me a bit of Bouteflika too
---
I actually have it trained completely to five.
---
I have found, over my years here, that using it at a level above your enemy is a waste.
---
So I try and lower myself to their level to ensure that the person in question is able to understand my queries and positions.
---
It does leave me open to interjections from people like yourself who, understandably, are unaware that I'm ensuring the person my message was directed at can comprehend what I am saying.
---
For that I apologise but please ensure you remember its for the benefit of the person I am speaking to not a grammatical savant like yourself.
---
However it would be remiss of me to not point out to you, as a fellow grammatical aficionado, the error in your own post. the phrase "post child for abortion" is completely incorrect in that sentence.
---
It seems you are asking me to post you a child so you may abort it?
---
That seem undignified to both the mother and child and unnecessary as the Postal System is bad enough that an abortion post delivery, excuse my pun, would be unnecessary.
---
I do believe you meant Poster Child for abortion. And even then by your own strict grammatical rules this would be incorrect as it would require a pronoun of the second person singular, for example I could say "/u/tevo569 Your poor attempt at a post shows that YOU are a poster child for abortion." I have written the word you in capitals to show the placement of the pronoun of the second person singular in the sentence.
---
I'm glad to have met someone with as much of an interest in grammar as I have and hope to discuss more with you about this topic.

Ask yourself how much fun Eve would be if it were never permitted for anyone to disparage anyone else. Ask yourself how much fun life would be. 
---
Have you ever, ever seen a standup comic? Do they sometimes make people laugh and have fun? Do they sometimes disparage others? There's this site called "The Onion"...you should check it out.

lmao why does you're br link penisout on their own column? everyone knows they're firmly on snuffs lap, cheeks a spread
---
Just a question - because you sound like every iT guy with a thesaurus and a chip on his shoulder I’ve ever had the misfortune to be lectured by. 
---
Whether you agree, we did something that hadn’t been done before. We get credit for that from folks who get it, and a lot of word salad from nobodies like you who are butthurt for no reason. Just a day ending in y around here.

Mate if the ship name was obviously racist or obviously sexist there wouldn't be an issue.

The fleet FC is within his rights to not want that shit in his fleet.

Then your moron of a friend changed it to rii.

I'd kick you there just for being a cheeky fuck and not being able to do a simple request.

The irony is you are on hear complaining more than that dude ever did.

You fucking snowflake

he actually is lol

Really bad. Accounts time out before they connect.

To the bottom you go!

I would read back through the earlier replies. I don't agree with your assessment. Also, why so hateful/hostile? It's not worth that level of emotion, don't you think? Are you offended at the discussion? Why would you be? What triggered you?
---
I think you misunderstand the definition of snowflake as well as REEE.
---
O7 
---
No I hate you for trying to turn 1 pilot being kicked from a fleet into "SJW's are taking over Eve.
---
The entire premise of your post has been to try and start a Pro-SJW/Anti-SJW argument on r/eve.  If you want to have your I hate SJW's rant go somewhere else.

The devs answer to your complaint always has been and always should be if you don't like it HTFU or move on.

WTM should be more opening of Diversity while ensuring that diversity is ruined by 1 person insulting an entire group of people is your argument now?

Reason a Chinese university bachelor degree is worth crap outside China. 
---
Honestly, I really do think you are on to something here...it does seem that the culture, is promoting taking offense at everything...and perhaps as a tool to power/status. It's disconcerting. It also explains the hate people are venting at me. It means they are not sincerely interested in supporting their fellows, but in something else.
---
This is formatted well, and most of your grammar is correct.
---
It's a subscription game.
---
Subscribe or stop whining.

Also, bots are why you can't do dull tedious l4 missions now.

I am truly sorry for the grammatical error, good sir. I am on my mobile cellular device and it has seen fit to fail me in my endeavor!

I , too, am glad to meet a fellow grammatical enthusiast, all be it one from the most suprising of places. I do hope that your proximity to TEST does not dampen your grammatical aptitude.

By being hateful, he hopes to create an intimidating atmosphere, in which people who think incorrect thoughts are not free to speak their minds.  He is gambling that his posts, and those like his, will get enough upvotes, while posts such as yours get enough downvotes, to make you feel isolated and unsupported.
---
In short, he is attempting to get the r/eve community to assist him in gaslighting you into believing that you are crazy, not the situation.

Insulting a group of people is not a belief.

Seconded! Come join us :) I’m a newer player myself, I’ve been with Brave for a month and everyone is very friendly and you’ll have plenty of content
---
I think this is a topic worthy of discussion and I've been very polite about it, unlike you. And perhaps you could take your own advice if other people discussing a topic so offends you...very puzzling. You feel reddit is for personal attacks and demeaning others, but sincere discussions about legitimate topics and those who engage in them are not to be tolerated?
---
That guy should get the hell out of fleet and I should get the hell off of Reddit so my ideas don't offend you who personally attack me? Is that how it works? 
---
Have an upvote. :-(
---
Lol, FRT was drinking the "FUCK TEST!"  koolaide by the gallon until they were losing.  Kinda like FRT always does since they came to Tranq, flipflops whenever it suits them.

The only reason there's alpha clones is to let people try the game. EVE is and a subscription based game, and that's where they make their money.
---
...I just want to poach some pandas, do I really need justification? That sounds like a

You should have used 80% of that income to buy plex bruh
---
b4r is a great place/group. i've spread the word of its existence a lot over the years. Then after my 19 year old niece's bf took his life (and basically blaming her for it), i just needed somewhere to talk, somewhere to vent, and it couldn't be talked about IRL really. Just getting shit out of my system for those 20 mins really helped, even tho i wasn't depressed/suicidal myself, i just needed a chat.
---
Probably one of eves greatest communities &lt;3
---
Being alpha bars you from the highest end parts of the game. For ship scale that means no capital ships. For ship advancement that means no t2 ships. for missions that means lv4 and 5 missions.
---
The real question is why they didn't restrict it sooner.
---
&gt;......1 sided NIP after all......
---
Well yeah. It was the result of a surrender.
---
In my case i rolled with a capital and was spawning around my logoff spot at the same random distance range as you usually spawn after going through wh.
---
I decided to postpone writing a bug report until i had more evidence though. So apparently it's reproducible.
---
couldn't do anything for 20+ mins... just starting to kinda work again now.
---
hmm... I smell a sockpuppet.
---
So you discount behaviors from your personal definition of diversity? Then you are living in a very narrow world of intolerance, I'm sorry to say.
---
you guys seem to care alot....I mean Vily's its pretty dramatic!! lol
---
Nou
---
So you are saying the RL value changed without reloading the page? Otherwise it is not "the exact same time"
---
And I am aware that each set is a single killmail, but if you view it it at say 06:00 it would have one RL number, then you reload it at 06:03... 3 minutes have passed. In that time zkill may have pulled the most up to date plex prices and recalculated the RL value.
---
Only on Sundays ;)
---
You guys brought all of eve with you.. and yet we are still here. 
---
Update notes:
---
&gt; Grids have been expanded to cover the entire solar system 
---
All restrictions alpha clones had were based on skill access. Until now.
---
much love brother. keep truckin.
---
The ellipses really deliver quite the cliff hanger.
---
Thank you, I feel like you have helped me understand better why someone would stay engaged in a conversation to simply hurl hate and insults (and nothing light-hearted about these). 
---
Old trial had this purpose.
---
Introducing alpha clones made a completely different way to play possible.
---
XiX is, in fact, covered in a round about way.
---
&gt;Now, people were super ratting and Rorqual mining before umbrellas proliferated sufficiently to make some regions the ultra safe space that they are.
---
They weren't. Rorquals didn't go in until well after the concept of the modern supercap umbrella was already cemented. See also: supercap ratting. 
---
What a large grid
---
One doesn't have to do JUST havens, or JUST sanctums. 
---
im asking you who cares if it's spin or not. pvp is happening.
---
While that is correct their business module require you to either pay for the subscription, or to purchase PLEX from the market as you add to the demand.
---
You can't proclaim your love for the virtues of the free-wheeling sandbox and then get upset because you don't like the way that a group is sandboxing in the context of fleets that they are running.  
---
Or I mean, you can, it's just a bit daft.
---
sp farm
---
congrats on logging on multiple alpha accounts at once then, fairly sure that's against the EULA tho
---
*unless that's based on skill access*
---
TEST isn't any more organized than PH. Goons are though. 
---
PH isn't super rigid, but is probably the most bloodthirsty and most targeted of the new player groups, which is good if you want action. If you're really not into being with them, you could give Brave a shot. Test and KF aren't worth it in my opinion.
---
People don't run serpentis 6/10 due to it being massive pain in the ass to run, compared to other 6/10s, 
---
And while corelum a-type is equal to other a-types in stats, there is no such thing for shield invuls.
---
Time to get back to lowsec plex running i guess
---
Yes I am saying that. Check the killmails yourself and tell me how it looks. I linked them for that purpose
---
Maybe it was an elaborate ploy to get spies to reveal themselves on reddit 🤔
---
The last white person that uttered that word in public. Got spanked... By me.
---
you should sue your mother for drinking while you were in the womb 
---
AFK vni density is affected by spawn rates, FYI. A -0.1 system that could support 4 VNIs on havens/Fhubs can now only support three.
---
Sanctum/Haven chaining is still viable, just not in shitty truesec systems or with as many supers in the high truesec systems.
---
If groups want to stay in compact areas, they're going to need to come up with ways to take advantage of worse sites or really prioritize living in -1.0 / -0.9 systems.
---
This has always happened sometimes when rolling Whs, and ending up K space side. You would end up on a gate, or a station. This was actually " on purpose", although I cant remember what that was. WH side you were always supposed to just still be there and need to warp back.  
---
Today's deploy introduced new behavior where it seems to be happening all over, and more often ( always?). If you have not, submit a BR.
---
&gt; congrats on logging on multiple alpha accounts at once then
---
what. i'm not logging multiple alphas. it's not just against EULA, launcher doesn't allow that.
---
Ah ok. Let me get rorqs like everyone else so i dont have to play the game.........even better let me get 5x VNI.. Thats making as mutch as a super..... Again AFK.... 
---
GG CCP.....
---
GG....
---
you can't extract skills if you have less than 5.5 mil SP. and alpha can't go above 5 mil SP unless that alpha uses skill injectors or goes omega
---
you can't chain sanctums at all now. you can't not even in a decently tanked fit. 
---
let's say your system spawns 3 Sanctums. 
---
One will be a Station, let that be, it's shit. 
---
kill the other two that are rings. 
---
take 3:45 to clear a ring with 2 DDAs. have a new ring spawn as soon as you finish one. don't get that bored of ratting because you get the chance of a titan/dark dread spawn. etc. life is good. ticks are 110m+ without spawns. 
---
now with the changes to even maintain the ticks you'd have to do havens, which are cancer in it's purest form. 
---
BTW: you can only chain sanctums when you're the only one doing them so get lost with all the "you need to spread out and it won't be bad lul" stuff. just cause you're mad at ppl making money by accually doing stuff. 
---
Brave newbies all de way! been flying with those guys for 5 straight years now. Never looked back. Best online gaming community I have ever been a part of.

Ratting nerfed.. can confirm..  undock those procs bois !

I thought about making my own CCP Falcon meme but now I can't.  These are getting too good
---
Accept my spy already

 It is *so big*, she looks like one of those CCP Falcon's girlfriends. 
---
It's daft if I think it should be prohibited by some authority. I haven't said that. I've simply rendered an opinion about the destructive impact that their methods have. I should add that they have a lot to be proud of. I should have said this before. They have created functioning organization inside Eve. I would like it to grow and be healthier, as I would like Eve to grow and become healthier. I regard Eve as a monument of accomplishment and I really, really want it to succeed. I just think ostracizing people and publicly ridiculing them is not a good way to do that. That's all...the "don't be a dick" motto suggests that somewhere along the line they understood this. Perhaps the original organization was inherited by petty tyrants with a personal political agenda. Who knows.

Dude, you struck a deal with a Goon pet alliance, are you really that amazed it wasn't honored?

not sure why youre being downvoted for this

yeh, that's the point, there are various things that omega brings that alpha doesn't that are not skill related
---
We're the Pearl Abyss, lower your expectations and abandon your hope. We will add your communities' distinctiveness and it's revenue to our own. Your game and ingame shops will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.
---
Don't do it. Don't advocate for it. CCP has a long history of banning in *waves*. If they're turning a blind eye to it now, it may mean that they're setting up to nail a ton of the people abusing this at once.
---
Folks don't like to have their ulterior motives exposed. Fortunately, the narratives are made up and the points don't matter.
---
Is there a publicly available guide to doing Angel burners or just burners in general?
---
&gt; there are various things
---
which ones? WITHIN one character, everything that omega can do that alpha cannot is skill related, unless i'm forgetting something.

The good boys over at r/tendies would like to have a word with th

Pretty sure a large amount of the TEST line members have been counting the days until the FRT NIP expires, pretty much since it was put in place.

I'm sorry

make it omega, train cyber 5, put +5s in, train. sell goo in a week, since you'll hit 5.5 then, repeat

&gt;That guy should get the hell out of fleet 
---
Yes. The FC can run the fleet as HE sees/. If the pilot is unhappy there are more than enough fleets out there for him. Hell he can run his own fleet.
---
&gt;I should get the hell off of Reddit so my ideas don't offend you

Off Reddit no. Off r/eve yes.

You are taking 1 pilot being kicked from a fleet and turning it into a crusade on r/eve against your political enemies.

Most people here couldnt give 2 craps about either side of your little Pro/Anti SJW war.

UPCOMING CHANGES:
---
As part of the fight against abuse of Alpha accounts by those involved in botting and real money trading, the EVE Dev Team have been looking at what Alpha characters currently have access to in New Eden.
---
[As we discussed initially in the New Year security update, the team were considering placing level 4 and 5 courier missions behind the requirement to have Omega clone status.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pljaph/new-year-security-update)
---
After investigating further, the decision has been made to place all level 4 and 5 missions behind the requirement to have Omega status, to assist the fight against RMT and botting.
---
Of course, we are aware that mission running is only a part of the issue, we’re also investigating more ways to reduce the abuse of alpha accounts.
---
I think you're being too literal. To me the phrase "return in kind" simply means that if you shoot me I will shoot back. The issue of it being one fort is irrelevant. 
---
apples and oranges
---
#underratedcomment
---
yeah so now we're adapting by sitting in station with our supers all day just waiting to blob onto some small honor frigate gang, well if that isn't just what everyone wanted. k thx. 
---
you are a clever bot
---
The Hecate is just one of those ships where you know that this pilot undocked with the intention of being a committed trouble maker. It can insta-align, it can dish out 1k dps, and it's cheap enough that you won't lose sleep after losing one or ten.
---
people like to think it's for bot control but it's actually a mercy killing, now you can't be exposed to the absolute dullest part of eve online, running missions
---
Its honestly just so much easier if you dual box frigs. I used to use a kitsune and Daredevil, but the trig frig might be good too
---
I'm waiting for my 24 million sp man 10/10 true facts.
---
Guristas LP is worth&gt;2k isk per LP. &gt;3k if you sell crystals
---
Not sure if you're being literal or just mocking the frat. Or maybe both.
---
as someone whos main is a super pilot, and have never used an injector, I wish supers were removed from the game.   
---
DeathToSupercapitals 
---
Today we released version 1.1.0 see all details on [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b0cwh9/eve\_workbench\_release\_110/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b0cwh9/eve_workbench_release_110/)
---
just so you understand (and i have no idea why im even responding to this)
---
1) we signed a one sided NIP that allowed Xix and frat to skirmish but included a clause so that frat could be told to stop if they started hammering xix too much.
---
2) works for 5months
---
3) frat gives skillu a fort to stage from in detroid. anchored for them.
---
4) TEST redeploys to end that campaign
---
5) xix anchors a fort in their space on the border.
---
6) frat comes and kills that fort
---
7) TEST states clearly that a repeat of that fort attack will result in the end of the NIP 9 days early
---
8) ..and now.....
---
Because narrative man.
---
Not my fault you're too shit to adapt lmao
---
Just a question is there any way for us skill book traders to recover the isk we have put into our book stores. Can I sell my 300 some odd stacks of skill book back to NPC for full value? or too bad so sad lol
---
&lt;3 o7
---
XD i had to make the joke
---
Well see about that one buddy
---
There will be piles and piles of salt !
---
Yep I’ll second that. Brave could be a good fit for you. 
---
I wonder if something got rolled back/tweaked.   
---
In the last couple of days I've rolled about 5 holes.  C4, usually just dump 4 mega's through.  I've had to thread all 5..  Maybe just unlucky but noticeable. 
---
I dont remember it having some many words...
---
the plex will be 3BILL next year
---
Oh you dont have 6 Rorqs? Not my fault you're too shit to adapt lmao haha 😂
---
Why we dont have new players ??? Buy new skins lamo haha 😂 
---
I need my f48 million SP so I can do things.
---
Yep I’ll second that. Brave could be a good fit for you. Worth a shot.
---
I’ve flown with some of those Aussies and they’re (not) all alts.
---
Get rid of all pve and give everyone a universal income of dank ticks. 
---
how is that related to ALPHAS being restricted from lvl 4 missions?
---
Agreed.  We lived in a rigged system when the top 1% of rorqual miners produce 90% of the ore.  A highsec miner struggles to make a wage of 10m per hour, while executives in their rorquals make 100+m per hour!!!!
---
How can a single barge pilot hope to graduate to the middle class? 
---
We need to tax the rorq miners and redistribute some of that wealth to those who need it most.
---
[The answer is simple](https://youtu.be/owI7DOeO_yg)
---
you must be one tough motherfucker  
---
i wish i can be one day as cool as you
---
I brought this up in the bugs channel and it's already been fixed internally and should be out in a future patch. 
---
I would also like to call attention to the poor miners in the minmatar regions that were enslaved for hundreds of years by the viscious amarr empire.  
---
We need to start having a conversation about reparations...
---
Hi! Thank you to those, who submitted a bug report! We could track down the problem and a fix is already inbound for the next patch (and will hopefully also fix cases, which were broken in this way before today's patch). Apologies for the inconvenience.
---
Pilgrim is underloved because the stratios exists
---
yeah and also a few weeks ago rusrus announced they were forming a new coalition to invade frt and it would begin at the same time the nip ended.
---
basically vily you want to create another 2 regions of buffer by filling it up with more russians. what are you gonna do when they get poked? let me guess: install another walking wall, rinse repeat until you've achieved your original aim from the fcon wars of being blue or nipped from drones to cloud ring, long way round. honestly the imperium is light on diplo compared to you guys. 
---
Okay, i hate current plex prices because when i started a GTC was 120m, does that make me a poor?
---
oh god how i love subpar trolls. still it's what this change will cause more than what it will do to the botters (nothing) and the only ones needing to adapt are ppl who accually press buttons
---
Something about wormholes
---
&gt; They don't realize that once everyone starts ratting in carriers and botters inject trillions into the economy what happens is even though their income is fixed by rat bounties, inflation increases causing their isk to be worth less.
---
And I, lowly non-pve'er who doesn't rat in carriers, just gets fucked then I guess
---
I've adapted my bot already, don't see why you guys can't adapt :)
---
We should get ticks for killing and negative ticks for pve
---
Good relations translates to we are pets and we batphone when the enemy is too strong
---
yes they did. However they dont have the people to take it OR hold it. So even if i could take it for them i wouldn't be able to hold it for them long term. 
---
Invariably actions matter in eve. Words dont. 
---
who are you?
---
What a weird world we live in
---
Maybe you should just join an alliance that can give you real space to farm 🤔🤔🤔
---
don't tell anyone but you can warp between the pockets in the serpentis 6/10 which means you can bring a capital and light a cyno inside.
---
Quick preface, I really don't know much about the game, I'm 2 weeks into the game, so take what I say with a grain of salt, and I could be completely wrong on mulitple things. That being said, I am you a couple weeks after trying out exploring.
---
I will say, as a new player, if you have the resources, use the Astero. Low skill requirements, meaning you get a decent buff to scanning/hacking right off the bat, you don't need to train a weeks worth of time for a marginal increase and your stats. Asteros are a bit expensive, but not prohibitively. I was able to purchase one in my second week of playing, and I generally just do my own thing, not part of a super structured corp with tons of content scheduled all the time (no one handed me the money or ship).
---
The Astero is also pretty damn safe for a newer player, as it has covert ops cloaking, turns on a dimebag, and generally is a joy to fly and explore/hack with. You have a metric shit-ton of drone space to play with, and the Astero can easily do some lower tiered combat sites and ratting (I just do the first two levels of combat sites with my Astero, and T1 drones, no problem, wouldn't recommend it for anything actually difficult though).
---
All in all, I would definitely recommend the Astero as your first upgrade from T1 frigates as it makes the whole exploration experience a lot less annoying. Plus it looks bitchin', even without a skin.
---
I am in a alliance. And we have no space. Cuz there is no sites to run
---
You probably bot
---
Luckily the hard working bug team have already fixed this issue due to people submitting bug reports :D  
---
But yeah, Submitting a bug report is a far more effective solution than making a forum post. Always submit a bug report.

I'm told you need 3 ring sanctums and 2 rock havens for a single supercarrier now. (obviously going at full speed)
---
pvp, wtf is that?
---
Now you got me totally bamboozled
---
What do you mean? Because we are not the developers of pyfa ;)
---
You can import the pyfa fittings by exporting them as EFT format to your clipboard and importing them in EVE Workbench without any issues. And of course the other way around.
---
But please let me know what you mean with the pyfa integration

You’re going to get on top of this and then you’ll be back.

perfectly acceptable, as long as people keep buying my plex :)

You attacked the NPC miners, didn't you? Don't do that unless you can deal with the response fleet. For regular rats VNI is fine.

You should be restricted from everything else too.

I wrote out a long post of support and things that have worked for me, but you don't want to hear that. I have bipolar and suffer from time to time. If you ever want to chat pm me.

I figured as much. I just wish they'd post exactly what changed

Shocker, stain guy dosent know what hes talking about.
---
Good to see you're still here to check-in with the community. 
---
And it's good to be reminded that our space family has our backs when we need it. 
---
so we need other measures to determine the location of a machine running the game client, to effectively regionlock?
---
I'm down. save tranquility. 
---
&gt;\&gt;frat gives skillu a fort to stage from in detroid. anchored for them.  
---
&gt;This was probably the biggest factor.  
---
&gt;Skillu used this for months to fuck with the Russians. Destroying jump bridges attacking sovereignty etc. Albeit for the sake of content not to push the Russians out.
---
I think if you already have a very bad standing with their faction, they might just call backup as soon as you show up, so add them to your dscan preset and don't warp to belts they're in.
---
Did The Rats have a 'Diamond symbol' near them?
---
So your down with invasive ways to determine people location for a inconsequential and unfounded reason?  Are you sure you aren't the Chinese government?
---
Idk why anyone is alpha atm when you can just sell your skills repeatedly. You get the pros of being able to fly any ship, multiboxing, do any activity and you can respec constantly since you're always training and extracting. 
---
Sub omega once, get implants, extract skills every month, use proceeds to buy plex, repeat. You should be down like 100 mil or something tiny per month.
---
here you go https://zkillboard.com/kill/29682967/

you need new regions instead of delve where there are more systems under the range of 1 capital system

I've heard holes of the worm variety are pretty good.
---
That might be true for PUBG but doesn't mean anything in other games. In csgo for example people are always happily calling every russian under the sun a hacker but then some stats got released and people were pretty impressed to find that russians are less likely to cheat than americans for example and players from finland or denmark have some of the highest chances of being cheaters.

Can you explain to me how you steal players from other alliances?

If  the community would be a bit more open minded you would not see it as a bait post 
---
Not some stupid jewkike like you thats for sure.
---
I'll admit to being a little confused. I think I am arguing for WTM to harden up a bit to use your language. It is also not a matter of one pilot, but a matter of expressed policy at WTM. Finally, I should get the off of r/eve with this Eve topic that happened in-game and YOU are telling ME to harden up? I think you are confused. Your arguments are so internally inconsistent I'm not sure how to give you an honest answer. 
---
No matter what CCP does to fix this they're going to get huge amounts of grief. Gonna be an interesting year.
---
Just installed last night on Arch. Works perfectly with a single issue: in game fonts look fragmented, and are flickering. Still readable if I read slowly. Have you noticed any issues with the fonts?
---
So you judge the content provide by something by the ship that doesn't die ? It's like saying freighter doesn't give hs ganker content because a lot doesn't die and ccp need to nerf hs freighter 
---
fighter weapons sorta use missile mechanics, but the omni tracking mods do work on them
---
yEah they use asics miners these days
---
&gt; proprietary 390 drivers
---
Oh boy, you're in for a treat when you upgrade to the newer drivers that Proton is built for. :)
---
you must have encountered  one of below
---
1.  NPC capital ship spawn either dread/carrier/titan yes there are npc capitals!
---
2. you attacked ships with diamond sign ♦ - thats where your problem came,they warped away and  response fleet warped in then murdered you.
---
And it doesn't hurt that they are what, 1/4 of the world's population. So even if a smaller % of Chinese gamers cheated than other nationalities, there would still be more Chinese gamers cheating than the total number of gamers in most countries by just shear numbers. 
---
It's like trying to have a meaningful discussion and comparing the Imperium to say, a 8 man corp of real life friends.  
---
I've never associated "REEEE" with autism. If anything I would associate it more with people like the FC in question who freak out over nothing and start making demands because they found something they can't control and they can't handle that and they decide to REEEEEEEE about it instead.
---
Ok. Yeah was kind of misguided by the attributes and abilities Window... Thx for making it clear.
---
Fly safe 
---
Yeah, just installed last night, and the only issue is that the fonts are flickering. Literally everything else just works. I'll open a bug report.
---
if broadcast 4 reps would help mining would be good too
---
they never do that, might be because they dont know either...
---
havens +- 16mins
---
forsakens +-12mins

rallypoints +-20mins(!)
---
If only poors were smart with their monies. I didn't hit top 5% status until I started having my isk make isks for me. Market PvP has been my most profitable venture. Some people can't handle looking at all the numbers and the like, I personally enjoy it. 
---
I think 2 is what actually happen, that makes sense.. thanks
---
Both get same TD bonus, no? 
---
it's called communism, some countries tried that (and some countries are still trying) and some countries are trying "modern" version of it with fixed income for everyone ....  and guess what, they will never succeed as MAIN part why people playing this game is that they actually can make virtual money and they can make more than someone else.
---
&gt; I chose to play as alpha clone with multiple alts, not upgrading to omega ...
---
that's exactly why they are doing that, use that thing on your neck dude
---
Oh, I didnt. Just pointing out the logical fallacy that something cant be bait of it's based in fact.
---
Fighter “guns” use missile attributes (explosion velocity/radius) as opposed to the normal turret attributes (tracking speed). It’s a bit counterintuitive, but when you check the fighter info you should see two entries for explo radius/velocity. One for the “turrets” and one for the missile volley. 
---
Why are they different from regular turrets? Idk the specific reason but it’s likely due to how insanely fast fighters are, which would ruin any attempt to balance application based on tracking (current application arguments aside).
---
The pilgrim was pre-nerfed on release iirc.  This was before d-scan immunity, so the pilgrim was a very potent solo, cloaky ship.  They were quite useful before T3C took that role.
---
Make people live in the space they own isn't the same thing as having tens of thousands of chars living in one nullsec region. How fucking dumb do you have to be to think the latter is what "players wanted"?
---
BIG MEANIE
---
Dammit...lost another one, RiP comrade.... o7
---
You realise your posted fit doesn’t have 3 radiation sinks and has no mids fit?
---
You still haven't said your ingame name. Which makes me wonder if the whole thing here is kinda click bait. Like I've said we would need more information to give a proper answer.
---
Also, random corps in goons or test are not new player corps in general. Those corps might not be good fits for you as a new player to begin with.
---
And, yes, for me selling plex and injecting magic 14 right away would be a low level flag that this isn't a proper new player.
---

First make sure you belt rat in a empty system not your staging. 
---
10AU+2AU per level of grid expansion?
---
if this was done with sieged rorqual it would look funny
---
How about the summit notes? Does it take this long to scrub all the value from them?
---
I mean I always thought supers and titans should be ships used in combat not for krabbing purposes anyway or am I the only one that didn't dream of having what is essentially a 25 bil mission boat. The only reason why they are used for krabbing in the first place is because of the isk faucet making it so you didn't have to care about losing them in the first place. Good change imho
---
so there is no more interbus poco in highsec? im curious if there was some killmails related to them
---
did blowing up interbus poco gave suspect timer in hs?
---
Should be worth noting that you don't need to necessarily attack the  ♦ NPC Miners in nullsec belts for them to call in friends to attack you. If you have less than 2.49 standings to them, you are KOS to the PIRATE FACTION  ♦  Miners i.e.  ♦  Guristas Productions Mackinaw. (This is incredibly likely to be the case since most players will have negative standings just by virtue of doing PVE content, and since you're belt ratting you're losing standings to them anyway, and even if you haven't killed them, you need decent standings to them). 
---
yes, when it's 0 people working on it.
---
yes.  this happens to pos aswell but pos  ownership turns into  concord. blowing up the concord pos wont give any timers at all . 
---
go on test server
---
have alt in 7day old corp 
---
anchor pos with modules,pus must be fueled.
---
disband the corporation
---
see what happens.
---
he want to build deathstar and  make  local caroline star
---
The Pirate Faction Miners will consider you KOS (they will appear red in overview/space) if you do not have at least 2.49 standings to them, and will try to warp while calling in reinforcements. 
---
but 1/10th tick wise
---
Ok, lets take the SJW, which you brought into this, argument which doesnt belong here out of the equation.
---
WTM is a long established ingame group with agreed upon rules of behaviour that have to be followed to allow you to take part. Your pilot didnt follow those rules and was kicked from fleet. 
---
WTM dont want that pilot as a member of their private ingame group.
---
CCP allows private groups to make ingame membership rules.
---
Why are you arguing for someone who doesnt follow the set rules  of a group to be let back in?
---
tfw u realize PL is planking to Adversity.
---
im just an f tier FC compared to the likes of Tau
---
TLDR
---
1. he died to npc capital ship
---
2. he died to mining ships resposne defensive fleet
---
im glad you provided context, because that looks bad without context but understandable with context
---
because of the pitchfork? ;)
---
Lucky boy having a single system all to yourself to super rat in. Meanwhile in reality, all systems that could be viably super ratted in usually had 2+ supers pinging between sites.
---
(Note: I have no skin in this game at all as I make 100% of my isk from the market...rip anything that comes from a 6/10...6 min respawn got nerfed HARD to 20 minutes)

---
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

I could, but since it's currently a large part of our overarching model of power, I'd rather not. Sorry!
---
If there were a group of battleships, like more than 2 or 3 then its possible you found an officer spawn with his escort.
---
As long as you have the system to yourself and no-one else ratting there...sure
---
If this post was to prove Rorq are buffed, it would be right now on top of reddit but because this is the opposite it has to be either bias or bait, the lack of open mind from this community will always amazed me
---
No poors plz.
---
All of them, since they won't be able to warp and probably be moving at 40% speed.

Who even logs in to accept the applications?

Woah its pretty r/worldnews in here.

ok, so should the meta never be shaken ever again? I understand the wise move that imperium made into condensing but when a single region can feed 40.000 members (across timezones) then whats the point of having another 25 regions..
---
Don’t
---
Reee, Test broke their promise! How could this possibly have happened?
---
why dont you take drone regions, pretty sure there are systems where super range includes \~250 systems
---
good, the game does not need more supers.

Go join null sec and rat in a AFK VNI, CCP likes that!
---
implying r1ot ever left lowsec, or that snigg could ever leave the corp mulcher that is PL
---
Trash truesec. Also, we have approaching on hundreds of trillions of ISK in infra in Delve, and we aren't even finished deploying it yet. No desire to waste a good portion of that ripping out rigs, not to mention the manpower cost.
---
Ok. I think i understand now. Its still a little misguiding. Or i am dumb XD.
---
Still, thank you for your answer 
---
Can confirm, also waiting for my 96 million more SP for my subcap alt for when capitals are finally rebalanced. 
---
Hello! Silly noob question.
---
I started playing a few ago and have trained a good bit of skills now via injectors, following the magic 14 on EVE uni wikia, as well as some recommended core skills. I also trained into a Hawk and have been training up to mastery 4. Originally I wanted to do PVE stuff but it seems most of the fun comes from PVP. So my question is, where do I go from here? I would like to join a Corp and participate in PVP or fraction warfare. However it seems like missiles aren't very good in PVP? Should I skill into another ship/weapon system or are Caldari missile frigates useful in PVP? All 14 skills recommended by eve uni are level 5 and most of my missile skills are level 4-5 baring anything over light  missiles like heavy missiles or torpedoes. Assualt frigate is also level 5

Please download Pyfa. It will save you from a lot of grief later..and in game ship fitting simulation has improved although pyfa is still better by a mile
---
I'm sure it does to you.

HI HY!!!

hi tachi
---
Good to see some good happening! At end of day we’re all people with our own struggles but it makes me proud we do come together to help or remember a fallen pilot. 
---
Didn't know him at all, but I hope he found peace, and his life was a good, satisfying one. I'm glad you got to meet him/her and form some good memories, it seems he left a positive impact on you, hopefully he was able to share that with others as well. Sorry for your loss, it sucks, even if we "know" it can and will happen, it doesn't get any easier, much less so when it's a surprise.
---
Aren't you a goon? just plex and inject some super alts and rat yourself some trillions lol
---
The Agency will only show a dozen opportunities at a time, even when there are many many more.

Has havens are aids due to tremendous amount of worthless frigs

forget brexit i want a hard plexit.

I'm not making that argument. I just felt like it is bad juju for WTM and for Eve in general to make an open community encouraging all comers and a motto in the MOTD "don't be a dick" and when someone shows up after flying across the region to take you up on your offer, with an off-color ship name, it's damaging to the game to not only kick him but lecture the whole fleet about his crimes and ridicule him in the process. I'd be OK with it if their motto was "We're total authoritarian dicks don't come here if you don't seek personal abuse". I'd suggest that they take another tack, but, heck it's what you signed up for...and the outrage should just settle down. Everyone should just give each other the space to do your thing. And just to be clear, I'd be horrified if the FC started calling some self-identified autistic kid a "retard" in comms and ridiculing him for his disability. But holy cow, can't people see that they just did that to someone who is no less a person than the hypothetical members of the "autistic community" that they claimed to defend? I'm sure that guy has problems too. Maybe his house is getting foreclosed on or he lost his job. It's just so far out of proportion and it disregards the person in front of you to claim status/virtue for something like this. This happens to the wrong guy on the wrong day and he unsubs forever...and THAT I do not want. Maybe we should all just take it down a notch. That guy's ship name wasn't targeting anyone, but HE was targeted...and it just seems bad, out of proportion and blind, quite frankly...no offense blind people.

Sorry for your loss. o7

He goes by the name of viscount now . . .
---
Why? Gotta live in the space that you own. Occupational sov model and max utilization of space being the most optimal way to continue living in nullsec. If you spread out then you get spread thin.
---
Why would people do what benefits roaming wormholers?
---
I'm a new player who went into exploration. After about 8 days I decided to risk going into nullsec for data and relic sites. 2 days later and I managed to get back to Jita and now I'm sitting on 150 million ISK. Only... I have no idea what to do with it. I could blow it on buying new ships but I'd rather invest it. Anyone have a good way to make ISK while I'm out scanning down sites? I know using alts is a thing, and I'd rather avoid it if possible, but I'm willing to try it. I don't have a whole lotta time either. I can manage only a couple hours a day, so I'd love a method that doesn't need a whole lotta upkeep. Thanks for any help!
---
Cheers! Ill take a look at it when i get on tonight :D
---
&gt;  I guess you think he's some white guy decrying Chinese successes or something
---
It wouldn't be racist if the author was white, brown or purple. 
---
snigg has a ustz?
---
its not that bad, only malpais has over 40+ systems with 0.5+ and for example this [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/range/Avatar,5/9WVY-F](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/range/Avatar,5/9WVY-F) has at least 120-130 systems with 0.5+, the other thing you said made a lot of sense though and why it wouldnt be such a good move
---
Agreed. Now that we have the most, the rest of the game should not be able to catch up.
---
I seem to recall that CCP introduced legislation to the EULA regarding use of 3rd party applications being connected to eve, it was a while ago so I'll do some digging however I'm pretty sure this is a bannable offensive.
---
i actually dont mind, as long as the meta shifts a bit, i'd rather everyone has 2 titans than everyone has a titan and a super, i hate lagfests
---
❤️
---
Planetary Interaction, station trading...
---
I just timed out 3 forsaken hubs, all were 12 minute respawn timers. Havens were 12 minutes also.
---
I really disagree. There is more than just ratting for isk and buying plex for isk. Go out and learn something new in Eve. Play the market? I've made hundreds of billions in the market all without undocking. 
---
Why do you have a chunk of ISK these days? ISK is worth less every day. Invest
---
Chinese is the nationality of a country. This country is home to many different races, cultures, religions and individuals.  
---
"Chinese" is no more a race than "American" is.  You're probably thinking of "Han"
---
who's Ron Mexxico?
---
just make rats attack drones like sleepers. problem solved.
---
I'm not trying to create a hostile atmosphere, i just think you are an idiot also /u/InsufficientChar .
---
FC has final call and gave the dude 3 chances, at the end of the day its up to him whether that name is acceptable or not.
---
The FC wants to create a welcoming atmosphere free of slurs that some people may find insulting.
---
And i find it absolutely hilarious that you are defending the use of an insult and then thinking im the hateful one. 
---
Like jesus christ you guys are worse than SJWs.
---
Person 1

&gt; fucking autistic retards

Them
---
&gt; dude thats not cool dont say that

You

&gt; BUUT MUH FREE SPEEECH
---
I have no dog in this fight but damn, you're making a fool of yourself. 
---
I wish i could meet more capsuleers in RL. I like to make friends from mmos I play. life is hard eve is harder but is all worth it
---
&gt;Fly with autistic incursion group
---
&gt;Shocked that they're being autistic 
---
Idk what you were expecting, they're know for explicitly being one of the only groups in Eve with worse coms than Test and Goons standing fleet.
---
You've got to be a troll.
---
Noone is this stupid.
---
First note, ship masteries are a useful place to start, but aren't always the best way to optimize your training. 
---
Missiles can be very good in PvP, and if you've seen Suitonia's videos [like this one on the Hawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbturIHFn14). Do note that a lot of his videos are outdated, but the basics he teach still applies, and it's good to understand why Suitonia fits things. 
---
Drop into Faction warfare next. Although a corp might be useful, it's a decent place to start trying out frigate pvp. 
---
[Planetary Interaction]
---
So I've now got 8 alts ready for PI. 
---
I was planning to setup the fairly usual system of alts extractors P0&gt;P1 and 1 main industry planet P2&gt;P3 but then I wondered, wouldn't that be interesting to collect raw ressources, bring them to a P0&gt;P1 industry planet and then to a P2&gt;P3 one ?
---
I recognize that would mean 2 more hauling trips and Poco taxes to pay, but as my extractors would be sucking more it would compensate for it... Or not ?
---
Nobody doing that ? Is it too complicated/waste of isk/time ?
---
Thanks for making me laugh! I was getting too serious.
---
Only one person would DARE use the raspberry jam...
---
The fc was within his authority to require a name change, and even kick a noncompliant pilot.  I am more curious about the supposed offensive nature of a ship named reeeeee when I regularly see ships named "sugar tits" "chocolate starfish " "derp derp" "mentula" etc...  in their fleets.  The arbitrary line in the Sand is what tickles my curiosity.  If he (fc) is hypersensitive to autism issues, for whatever reason, that should at least be taken into account.  This is especially true when it's quite clear no offense was meant.  It was most likely an attempt at humor that, I dare say, more folks probably found funny than offensive.  Even the response "request denied" seems to be good hearted in nature and more than a little humorous.  
---
To me a little htfu, or "get a sense of humor" was in order.  Had that been done a lot of bullshit would've been avoided and this post wouldn't exist.
---
I don't enjoy pve and I've done about everything there is to do. 
---
Please show me where I said these things you are attributing to me. I've been very polite and restrained. It is you who are making personal attacks.
---
We can shoot each other ingame and have, but why does race matter? 
---
Tbh at this point are you really a blackops group if you haven't been counter dropped by Freddy?
---
\&gt;Max DPS
---
\&gt;Only 2 of 4 lowslots are damage mods
---
Dat 192 million SP CCP promised would come handy....CCP pls delivar....
---
Chat isn't fixed yet
---
Was originally a actual fit kiki, totally slipped my mind about the low slots lol, gimme a min ill fix it
---
This feels like native advertising for mobile EVE...
---
Interesting, thanks. Maybe next time I'l finally setup kvm and only have windows as guests =)
---
You are defending the original guy and calling what the FC did virtue Signalling ffs. 
---
This tells me you support him and dont know what virtue signalling actually is.
---
Idk anyone who actually thinks Freddy has hurt blopsing tbh
---
This is the most uncomfortable one yet.
---
it's not, sure i might be baised towards mobile gaming...But I love everything about EVE Online and I wanted to talk to the community again since I've been getting more and more excited about what's coming this year for the mobile genre. 
---
Honestly that wouldn't surprise me. thanks for the info
---
Thank you Sir! You helped get me there! :)
---
Thanks Rixx! No new hats please, I love the current one I got. :)
---
Because then you won’t be alpha, and you won’t have this problem. 
---
To me it seems everyone is more offended that he got kicked. 
---
Maybe you guys need to harden the fuck up.
---
So thankful that you did!
---
That was assume, wasn't it? :)
---
alpha clone with multiple alts.
---
....thats not what alpha was ment to be used for.

ITT: goons crying.
