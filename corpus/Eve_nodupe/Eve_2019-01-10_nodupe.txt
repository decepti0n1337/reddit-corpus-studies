Or just use something like 2FA?

You seem to be missing the references that they were putting in there to WH consistently being screwed because of null CSM complaining.

---
1 scanner inside, 
---
Step 1: scan the hole ( no dscan on your stream so no notice ). 
---
Step 2: jump the static out to the hole ( this isn't shocking activity when you have a wandering hole )
---
Step 3: jump back in after you get a k-space. 
---
Step 4: use a carrier and roll the static from the other side. 
---
This isn't unlikely activity if you have a wandering hole or somebody rolled in.
---
Now you can rotate corps with your rollers to make it seem reasonable. 
---
You still have no idea what's inside your home other then somebody rolled the static, and somebody scanned from inside both are not eviction red flag, and if that happens 3/4 times a year your hardly gonna be panicking but that could literally be enough.

yes. and when they do that, there is little that any of the companies involved can do to save them.
---
once someone has access to the inside of all your shit including main email, they have more control of it than the owner. someone can even take the [inside track](https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/43ebpd/the-long-weird-story-explaining-why-i-bid-dollar700-for-a-stolen-psn-account) and use security procedures against you. eve players are pretty lucky that rip-and-run is the usual method for hacks, and that CCP actually has a pretty good CS team by video game standards.
---
They melt, or turn to gas?
---
\&gt;unironically citing deflation occuring during a worldwide recession.
---
This is unrelated.
---
What he’s referring to is that a lot of the EVE client side code is actually run in embedded python — actually an even worse derivative called Stackless Python — that interacts with C libraries to handle the UI. It’s atrocious and incredibly fragile.
---
The rock is breaking apart as it is being mined basically. Normally the rocks just vanish, now i guess there will be visual feedback, which is nice for the miners.
---
Actually the big 20% layoff after Incarna saw a whole lot of middle management get the boot.  Not upper management mind, only middle.
---
why are you even bothering to censor the system and target names if you'll just link the kill on the description lmao. Great job btw
---
So, Boeing is doing a shuttle that can do 274 m/s, and no warp drive.  A bit wimpy...

On the other hand, I bet it has more than 20m^3 of storage space.

I wish they'd do the same with the sound controls. Queue "Eve has sound?"

Cheap or poor. Nah mate.
---
When other games are selling a skin for 0.50 each, and ccp want nearly 10.00 for one, they're taking the piss.
---
I want to support ccp, but if they want a tenner off me, they need to provide something worth a tenner. None of the current skins are.
---
Why would this be a buff to isk, or safety? I get you don't need to survey scan so much as you get a better idea. But isk or Safety? Don't get those points as it's purely visual 
---
They are clearing testing a world without local.  And preparing the playerbase for the change.
---
Race matters only for role playing purposes, which not many people are doing.  Very few people will notice your original race.  They care what corporation you're in now (and last week etc, people aren't blind to corp changing tricks).
---
You'll want to cross-train skills for other races, because the optimal ship for a situation will vary across races for different situations.
---
If you're really into the Amarr thing, there are some folks in Providence who still role-play a bit.  Look up CVA, ask them about it.
---
i don't understand why people aren't more onboard with 2fa. 
---
&gt;Given that feedback from the community is crystal clear regarding issues that are still being experienced ten months after deployment, we feel that it’s imperative to provide an update on the status of the chat issues 
---
Really? seems a little early on to me /s  
---
Good to see the worth of our feedback amounts to more than zero, which was the rumour for quite some time, this is a step in the right direction, it's way to late coming to be redeeming but you're on your way CCP.
---
truly a shame that fw is as good as dead now, there is absolutely no better way to make a new player get a taste for real small scale pvp and breaking the mental barrier of losing ships than the meat grinder of fw system sieges.
---
This is a bit unfair, they've presumably been working on it for 10 months and they are trying different things and they will be giving up trying new things in 3 weeks before rollback and that's why they announce this now.
---
What's the quad stick do? Also stream name?
---
Get into a friendly corp sooner.  You're paying 10% tax on your bounties as a noob in an NPC corp.  Joining a player corp give you access to more lucrative nullsec, a lot of advice, and friendship (the *best* ship!)

Ok cool! As a new pilot, do you have any recommendations? I was looking into joining one of the militias since it seems to be close to where I am.

Omg! So many terms! This is great, tyvm.

Hypothetical situation:
---
I jump through a stargate in a tempest
---
On the other side there's a proteus at 0 to the gate, he's 12km from me. 
---
I decloak and overheat mwd and click approach on the gate while also clicking lock on the proteus.
---
The proteus clicks lock on my tempest.
---
The proteus locks my tempest and scrams me.
---
The proteus opens a cyno.
---
A fax jumps through the cyno. 
---
The fax clicks triage.
---
The fax clicks lock on the proteus
---
The fax locks the proteus and cycles a rep just to be safe.
---
Several seconds later my tempest acquires lock on the proteus.
---
ccp????

He’s not, since he’s replying to Doom and the whole meme about rorqual changes was related to PVP.

Depends on the rental alliance, most rental alliances have all their planets "poco'd", either by the holding corp or the renting corp itself. Sometimes you would even find pocos still belonging to former "landlords" on rather unused planets.
---
So, I was looking at that fit, and wouldn’t swapping one of the faction LSEs for a t2 adaptive invul work better? More ehp, more ehp/s regenerated, and you can overheat more stuff when things start to go south
---
This post's got electrolytes

YEah they use asic miners these days
---
Will check if I have one when I get home.
---
I'm in Provi-block, so I'll recommend that.  You can inquire on the WhyNotNull? channel, or go to Dital and ask in local about recruiting, or even into Providence itself and ask.  Provi is almost the only area of nullsec that doesn't shoot neutral people on sight - so you can safely enter Provi before joining a Provi corp.
---
Well, the Provi folks won't shoot you, but as Provi is widely regarded as reliable place for a small fleet to get a fight, you might run into non-Provi folks in Providence who will shoot you.  I'd ask in Dital first.  (Assah is a high sec-&gt;null sec system that is *not* safe, as it's held by HTP and company.  They're hostile to the rest of Provi, and don't play by the same Not Red Don't Shoot (NRDS) rules).  Be sure that whomever your trusting is Sev3rance, CVA, or some other Provi-block corp.
---
Alternatively, E-Uni offers a lot of training for new folks too.  There are also a number of major alliances that have newbro corps, up to and including giving free ships away.  This thread should have lots of offers/suggestions from members of those groups.

Positive posting about lowsec is very rare. This comment is valuable
---
Yes.
---
It becomes clear then what such an ideology must be.
---
One based on iron discipline, immense garden ornamentation and unyielding devotion to the cause of nihilism, revolution, insurrection, riot, rebellion, mutiny, disorder, disorganization, misrule, tumult, turmoil, mayhem, pandemonium and any other words that generally resemble chaos.
---
Yes. Such is its blatant hypocrisy and disregard for the the rational that it preaches the rule of anarchy through imposing a strict order of chaos upon the Universe. Or maybe the other way around. Who cares? They could have civil wars over such issues. Deviants. All of them.
---
All that remains to be done, apart from a lot of other things, is to choose a suitable name, a suitable symbol and write some propagandary like prose about storming the Bastille and chopping off heads or something. And throw in some entirely obscure references to music, art and literature that few people recognize.

Late to reply but yes.  It was a fuck up by the third party.  They told the lenders I'd put up collateral with 33b for a 30b loan but never told them what it was or considered how slowly they sold.  In the end I think the third party paid them out of his own pocket and spend a couple of years off loading the skins slowly

---
Nice work, thanks!
---
&gt;I'm aware they ban in waves, which is still the dumbest thing ever.   It would be like letting speed hackers  run around WOW for an extra months because you wanted to ban the accounts via scripting..instead of just handling it.
---
\&gt; Must be able to own structures and POCO's.
---
\&gt; We suck at PvP. We don't want to participate in fleets.
---
So you want the best piece of the cake without actually contributing to it?
---
That's not how it works and you know it. A corporation that's unable to defend its own structures in the worst case is a liability.
---
I think the start of it is typically feeling like either the CSM or CCP are fucking something up, and wanting to do something about it, basically. 
---
Personally, I didn't think the CSM was being utilised in the best possible way at the time I ran, post CSM 10 - It was uncommunicative with the player-base, so leak prone we had a direct Twitter feed of one summit, and had a mountain of drama associated it. I wanted to fix that, as CCP can't really manage the game without being in touch with what the game is actually like, and CCP can't really ever be at a director level of anything approaching real size, or lead a capital fleet - It's just something that in a post T-20 world can't happen.
---
I saw a problem, I had the time and the opportunity to take it on, so I did. EVE's a game I've played for 10 years, I don't mind doing  little bit of work for what I think is the betterment of it, considering I'd be perfectly fine playing it for another 10.
---
I can't speak for any other CSM, but for me it's a responsibility to leave the game in a better state at the end of a term than how you found it. Sometimes that means pushing for 3 years to get nullification looked at, sometimes it's rallying against aggressive monetization strategies or by calling bullshit on someone else's self serving agenda.
---
Being on the CSM costs its members a lot of time and money, but I like to think it's worth it to make tens or hundreds of thousands of gamers gameplay more enjoyable.
---
Do you actually?! I've been trying to find one for 3 years! In game name is IKO just shoot me a message and we can work it out?
---
I, for one, am shocked and appalled at this revelation.

Can someone tldr for me?

It is done to make it harder for the cheater to deduce what specifically they did to get caught. In theory, in the long run, this should mean more cheaters caught and less 'speed hackers running around'.

Yeah, I dont really understand how The Agency and Asset Safety should be connected, but Asset Safety in a wormhole would be dumb (and should probably also be harshly scaled back in k-space but /shrug, wormholer btw)

It probably took more total man hours to set that up than it will take him to rat enough isk for another one.

But it frees up a mid slot for something else.
---
My accounts and email are both 2FA'd, but I'd like an extra layer of protection if I were going out for a few months.

It's not just me that needs faction warfare fixed, there's a ton more who know a library of issues that I don't that want it fixed
---
I'm actually rather happy being where I am doing what I do - largely linux, solaris and cloud (or I guess,... IaC) in several forms. So I good get into aerospace the easy (hey guys, I might agree to admin your infrastructure) or the hard way via rc planes and uav and the like. 
---
get in line, half the game is broken and needing a second look
---
Act like they are helping the game but just help themself
---
I am saving this, because in a fight it will be the easiest way for me to spot exactly the ammo I need.  If this is OC I would talk to CCP about maybe making something they could publish (I don't know where).  This is really good.
---
Email and phone providers still occasionally get broken into via social engineering attacks on the customer support humans.
---
Is he banned? I remembered he rmt'd
---
what's wrong with your resolution holy shit
---
That's why you use an app for 2FA and not text or email.
---
Filthy casuals. Fuck those dipshits who arent high functioning autists like the rest of us. Fuck em
---
You really did made eve a better place, mister I ban everyone from the public CSM discord for mentioning the belly rub. 
---
&gt; I'm not sure a month would be enough to be a good test though
---
The thing is, you're talking as if CCP is planning on doing something new. Within the first month problems with the chat popped up and it only got worse. If they would have taken just the one month, they would have seen all these problems and could have at that time easily reverted back. 
---
Now if they choose to revert back it's going to be months of dev time spent when we're already receiving abysmal content in the last year. 
---
Will message you once I get on. Should be around 03:30 eve time.
---
dafuq
---
Just do what I did and quit
---
Might be worth colouring the names of the ammos according to what type they are-  Maybe yellow(?) for hybrid and red for projectile, or label the ammos like you have the tech2 types.  Newbros might appreciate that.
---
You really think CCP is capable of reverting this in under a month? That's cute.
---
We are glad to have you as apart of our community.   You just need to come shoot at us, mine with us, shoot with us...just keep logging in and doing whatever it is that makes it fun for you!   
---
 I just wish they could get the cost down on making these as its hard to afford.  
---
damn, thats alot
---
Good riddance. Please biomass in game or stfu.
---
dudes a feeding machine, I doubt one more loss is going to be the end of him.
---
&gt;  they put in a timeline to resolve it
---
No they didn't, they put a timeline before they work on a reversion. We have no idea how long it'll take them to figure out how to reintegrate the chat if they're even capable of doing so anymore. 
---
Shoulda just link to the blogpost...
---
Don't encourage him. Next he will take a potato pic from a 90 cellphone and upload that.
---
A lot of original ideas here.
---
I see, a worthy cause then. 
---
As a pilot that is now attempting to master projectile hulls like the Wolf, this chart is such a fantastic help! Thankyou! 
---
The only thing a battleship can do in that situation (other than die), is as soon as you decloak, launch ecm drones. Once prot locks you and aggros, your drones will immediately aggro without you locking. Begin aligning off and pray. Combine with hitting it with neuts to hopefully break him either through jams, or neuting off his tackle.
---
I love the game, love the community, and thought that it would be funny if we took the inside joke my corp had and kept it going. I had a blast campaigning. 
---
But once I won, I was committed to making sure that I did the job, and I felt like I owed to the folks who voted to me and to the community to take the job seriously, treat it like work, and put the effort in. I wanted folks to say "yeah, we voted for him because of the meme, but he's actually put the work in."
---
In the end, for any position like this, you get back what you put into it, and you have to have your own motivation for doing the work. You're always going to get shit on, no matter what, because that's the nature of any job like this that's semi-political. If you don't have your own motivations that keep you going, you'll either half ass it or just quit. 
---
Thank you.  Very helpful o7
---
Ya'll have 5 CSM reps via goons do you not? Maybe ask them to fix the problem. Because regardless of which group needs to deal with it, it's still stupid. 
---
Thanks for the suggestion o7
---
I thought it already was, most of the letters look like they are made of 9, maybe 16 pixels at most. 
---
&gt; it's a responsibility to leave the game in a better state at the end of a term than how you found it.
---
Most candidates are capable of arguing against obviously bad things like aggressive monetization, or for obviously good things like UI improvement. What matters is whether you can actually rise above the playstyle you are immersed within (in your case mega empire building), and defend interests of the game when they actually conflict with your playstyle. And what matters is whether you are actually knowledgeable about what's going on in the Eve ecosystem.
---
You had none of that this year. Throughout the year, you represented interests of a player group who was already heavily overrepresented in CSM. Unlike some other Imperium CSMs like Brisc, you've also been completely unreceptive and unwilling to listen to alternative ideas and Eve worldviews different than yours. You've been at times openly hostile to these Eve worldviews, including but not limited to mine. On top of all that, you literally bought votes for ISK to get in CSM, quiet possibly stealing a spot from someone else who could have been a different voice. To be blunt, from the outside, it just looks like you like the recognition.
---
Eve doesn't need more CSMs who's there solely because they had social skills to get into a mega empire ballot, or worse yet becase they can buy votes. CCP should receive feedback from a more diverse group less full of rich empire builders. I know this is an election problem and not a The Judge problem. And I already don't believe in the election system. But even if I did, perhaps you shouldn't try so hard to be the 6th Imperium CSM, if you really care about Eve.
---
True
---
&gt;I was wondering why would anyone ever volunteer for a seat in the CSM with the countless hours doing unpaid work?
---
&gt;What motivates you to do a community managers job for free?
---
&gt;I know this sounds blunt but I just wanted to ask the question without the politeness masking it.
---
what motivates you to pay for the ability to play a game?
---
take that motivation, and add the desire to improve the game.  thats what CSM will probably tell you.
---
Some fair points raised above, but just because these game rules might not meet yours doesn't mean they are wrong. That not to say I don't disagree with several objections you have raised here. 
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Needs asterisk  
---
&gt; *For best results, never use medium autocannons... 
---
I don’t quite know how to react to that lol...
---
unironically he is quitting kinda sad ngl
---
This is awesome.
---
Would you think about doing the other turret types?
---
Roids would be a lot smaller so drones would need a lot less time to come back to drop of ore 
---
This is really awesome mate. As with most things, it's not only the data that's important, but how you present it. This makes it super clear in a really nice way. 
---
:thumbsup:
---
Could see the point there. But drones orbit at a few k anyway. And if people loose drones they'll still keep losing drones. 
---
So you're cheap (at least as far as EVE is concerned). If CCP wanted your little bit of money they would cater to your demographic, but they don't. No reason to be upset, the default is fine for the majority of EVE.
---
&gt; It was uncommunicative with the player-base
---
Remember how you accidentally kicked me from the CSM discord based on how you misunderstood something I said about the PA acquisition? When you never invited me back, I felt like it wasn't worth trying to get back in either. For most of you my absence should have been a relief because you just did not want to hear what I wanted to say anyway.
---
The issue is I still get lots of PMs from people who think alike, about how their ideas were dismissed on the CSM discord. And when I present my ideas in good form on places like reddit, I get really good feedback and recognition. Which means maybe I was not the crazy town clown as this CSM and their empire builder buddies treated me on that discord. Maybe it was many of you who were still pretty uncommunicative and dismissive to ideas from people who are not immersed in empire building. 
---
I dont pay for this game though
---
Wormhole space is calling you.

It's all projectile...

thats pretty good constructive criticism actually, ill let him know. also like the suggestions too! we've been wondering about non news related topics to do + we've no reason to be particularly partisan one way or another. 
---
thank you!
---
*"and were not patient enough to release a properly completed expansion like a normal game company "*
---
You mean like the BFA expansion in WOW or Fallout 76 from  Bethesda.
---
Making a public statement like that couldn't have been easy. Kudos for that.
---
We've all been giving them much shit, and not without good reason, but it's clear they're going through a rough patch. Maybe it's time to tone it down a bit a be a little more supportive. :) It would be heartbreaking if indeed they wouldn't be able to continue anymore at some point...
---
I've recently made the mistake of trying Neverwinter. I can tell you getting back to EvE feels like polished streamlined clean bath after that cesspool.  Fuck everything about that game.
---
If you don't spend much time on other game forums you may not be aware of how much censoring and astroturfing is going on. I mean I won't be surprised if there are a few accounts in here trying to keep things somewhat in check but compared to other games it's very mild. They take the trashing, while doing their best to keep things running. 
---
So you go CCP!
---
Super dope!
---
GUYS ITS CAUSE ELO LEFT. HE TAKIN IT HARD. 
---
I'm cool with asset safety (as someone that takes business trips regularly), some of the otherstuff.. .I agree with you. 
---
The big issue is that eve can't solve the coalition and everyone clump into superpower mentality, partially because there are no real incentives to be in smaller and more fractured organisations. I hate wormholes (I like my supers and casual pvp), but damn it has a lot of the stuff requested above ;)  
---
Can we just take the best aspects of WH space and somehow jam it into K-space from Low sec down? ;p I'll be a casual follower of Bob..mass one day a week and sin through the rest? :) 
---
CCP moving at glacial pace as normal.
---
Wtf... Why can't I open this link?! T.T
---
No I was just being dumb.  He's right.  It's been a long day.
---
Abyssal arena collapses after 30 mins fight. 
---
Kills any pilots remaining on grid.
---
Curse pilot self destructed himself 10 secs before the collapse, so that he can save his pod at least by getting out of arena. 
---
I had 10 secs to bail out, probably even loot some dank modules if i was fast. But i wasted too much time looking at the killmail and figuring out what just happened. I first thought abyssal was closed and somehow curse died first. 
---
So i get killed by abyssal arena in the end. 
---
For autocannons range is not very important, falloff is. That is why barrage is the ammo you use at range, not the normal long range ammo.
---
You can play the game normally without a subscription to a point. You can fly the basic ships from frigate up to battleship on the trial account and do well in pvp and earning in game money once you refine yourself a bit. The sub allows you to use advanced versions of the ships and cool modules like a cloaking device for instance. Eventually you will want to pay for the sub if you keep going in the game. It's something you can grind for and pay with in game money if you want, but there is definitely a large appeal for just paying with real money until you get a stable economy
---
Skill queue is for skills to learn. ie skills to fly certain ships. Unlocking the ships means you will have access to the skills needed to learn to fly the ship. You will still have to buy the ships etc
---
When you were campaigning, I was skeptical and annoyed about a line member with limited Eve knowledge becoming a CSM just because of the meme. You were promising to "represent everyone" and I know it's not by definition possible to do that given many players have conflicting interests. Throughout the year there were times this worry has proven to be true. Like the time when you mentioned how CCP never intended people to live in wormholes, in response to the wormholer craze against hictor changes. It stroke a nerve when a nullsec empire builder says that, when we consider things like how CCP never intended titans/supers to be mainline fleet ships, ratting ships, or gatecamping ships. The fact is CCPs intentions really don't matter as much as whether the unintended emergent gameplay is good or bad in itself. Most of the meaningful mechanics of this game are emergent.
---
That being said, I think you've been the most interactive and approachable member of the CSM 13. You were willing to listen to, seriously consider, and engage with ideas with which you were disagreeing, and that's more than most CSM can say. Thank you very much for delivering on that campaign promise.
---
Exactly.  They new this would be hard, and there's no solid way to test it at scale.  I've worked for a couple of big e-commerce sites, and doing this sort of thing is REALLY hard.  I think it's good that they're trying to roll forward, but it's unfortunate that it causes so much grief and agony.  Rolling back would be disruptive as well.  They'll have to make the call when the time comes.
---
This would have unintended side effects like making assets in corp hangars much more secure as well.  CCP would never do this as they like the publicity from corporate thefts too much.
---
Potentially, if there was interest.
---
Mostly made this one as reference for corp members who were unsure about which types were tracking ammo or long range ammo etc. 
---
Now if we only had a gate to lowsec...
---
We have not 
---
Fleslight
---
Reading this makes me realize im a mouth breather. 
---
 YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
MAKE EVE BOT-ABLE
---
Yeah it was one of the annoying things about putting the full spread of projectile ammo on the chart. T2 Autocannon ammo are the only projectile charges which have a direct falloff modifier (all others change range, affecting both optimal and falloff). 
---
It's not perfect, but I think it illustrates that barrage is a good ranged, high damage option for autocannons when tracking is less important. 
---
You could probably get your hands on one for the low low price of a LS gate to Stain...
---
Yeah fuck that Mark guy.
---
thanks for sharing a little of your positivity with us.
---
&gt; CCP are no longer catering the game for high energy autistic pvpers
---
lol
---
f2p?  
---
well, for those of us who pay to play, or once did (and now pay through isk), we care for the game and want to see it improve
---
Free trip to Iceland
---
Yep basically
---
I honestly don’t remember a problem with the old system.
---
so as F2P your limited to tech 1 ships,  and have a max SP you can train to.   (though you can inject higher)
---
also, many modules like covert op cloaks, or special ships like bombers, command ships, marauders, dreads, carriers, titans, mining barges and so on. are locked.
---
if you sub, you can train to fly these and use them.   your skills also train ALOT faster and has no cap on SP.
---
Playing 5D Eve right there. 
---
Came to say this 
---
My deimos had 5 killmarks on him. 
---
There are tons of gilas out there doing abyssal pvp, get a hac and kill them. 
---
Current tier is
---
Curse &gt; vedmak &gt; hac(deimos) &gt;&gt; gila 
---
I guess.
---
Gila can kill a curse tho, its like rock siccor and paper. 
---
I did not say the security footage offered conclusive evidence. But it gives stuff to interpret. And some people are not that professional. Like if the scanning alt is always the same but rolling chars change then you still can sense something is up.
---
Imagine Hard Knocks having security footage duty the entire year. They wouldnt notice the freighters but at least they would notice multiple wormholefires right before downtime. Which would indicate them that they were being seeded, although they wouldn't know by whom.
---
A thrilling read. I will watch your progress with great interest 
---
I want my own personal citadel now.
---
I'm interested :)
---
The SKIN prices may be cheap monetary individually without looking at anything else but when you play other games with cosmetics. 
---
Rocket League you can buy skins for under $10, the most expensive I seen briefly just now was $6.50 with a lot being under $3. 
---
Move or Die you can buy cosmetics for under $1
---
Magicka 2 you can entirely new characters/classes for $10 and $5 rather than a reskin. 
---
CCP with regards to cosmetics, heavily overprices their products compared to majority of other games with cosmetics. Any games with cosmetics on the same level of CCP pricing are offering dramatic changes instead of a simple palette swap or adding a banner to your ship.
---
Got all my stuff packed up where to now?  Fuck it I’ll just retire from eve again. 
---
Yea, right, this saves everything of accual  meaning in the game besides lov cost modules.?
---
I'd assume most Gilas don't go into the PVP gate though. 
---
I remember reading that 99% of all account "hacks" are by someone you know that you shared your account with or 3rd party software..Maybe start with not sharing a account or using said software.
---
Go look at the abyssal pvp kb. Its surprisingly plenty. 
---
it's more or less like this...[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iyok24kIDk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iyok24kIDk) , im going to see if i make a video explaining it's use.
---
The brokenness must be reinforced daily for many months to get through the thick layer of denialism. This is basically what it takes for CCP to admit they fucked up/were wrong.
---
Assuming you never want to extract, you can just run a bot until you receive your first bot ban which will lock you from extracting SP. 
---
If you don't get caught, nice ISK, if you do get caught, nice account security.
---
yeah this shit really just breaks eve fundamentally.  This is what ends up killing games
---
&gt; 2fa
---
If the hackers willing to spend 7 days to extract SP, removing 2FA is trivial. 
---
Boeing sacrificed speed for cargo space on this one
---
Didnt see you mention injectors.
---
Energy weapons are the ones I can never remember 
---
Yet, again...TEST refuses to undock and fight. 
---
Nice! Glad to hear these types of fights are still happening in EVE.
---
The "free" trip cost me over $1k. 
---
I love it :). 
---
\- "NC Dock....ahhaha why don't you undock".
---
\- We undock and murder things
---
\- "Omg you  used a cyno to move instead of a gate omg omg!"
---
this is why we take backups.... and more backups. In before one piece wasn't backed up lol
---
The problem here is that any company that could possibly even remotely caretake the sandbox child of EVE....
---
Doesn't exist anymore. 
---
The current sandbox genre has become a spam of every piece of shit cunt that can write some code on unreal engine making a survival sandbox game and releasing it in pre alpha early release and praying to all deities that they believe in that the streamers they sent free keys to don't hate their pre alpha generic survival ARK copy. 
---
I thought that was Hodor playing for a moment lol
---
That was a fun night. Any idea what you received in ISK donations that same night? 
---
It's awesome that you have found something you enjoy and a way to hopefully enjoy it more. The Eve community never ceases to amaze me in how generous it is. 
---
I hope this helps make playing the game and others more enjoyable and comfortable for you so you can keep having fun.
---
Mainly it's compromised emails iirc
---
This is why I'm saving this, thanks heaps!
---
Most concerns like this are pretty easy to explicitly patch out. You could probably make it impossible to put these cans in corp hangars. 
---
This is the Real EVE. I absolutely love the passion this game generates. If we were in fleet, on comms the FC would most likely have said to biomass quietly.
---
I would actually rather see the passion redirected in game, but I do understand when personal emotional limits are reached. Time to go, or at least take a break.
---
The best to you OP.
---
Yikes
---
Would have probably been less cringy to see it die if it were blaster fit. Atleast we all would have assumed he had balls harder than an Avatar.
---
Cool. Any reason you use 3 DDAs instead of a Damage Control?
---
You don't need to pay to enjoy the game. You can try it 100% free and have a really good idea if you want to pay or work towards using in game currency to gain "Omega" status (paid account), which can be done but it would take a bit of grinding probably.
---
Either way. Playing for free is still a pretty good game.
---
Yeah the minute they present their Hacker Identification to CCP, they shouldn't be allowed to do anything.
---
Why can't these morons get it right.
---
My Hurricane Fleet Issue would disagree with you.
---
（´・ω・｀）
---
Poor reporting there buddy.
---
SPODSPLOSION!
---
In regards to partisanship I meant it as a suggestion to give the guests to please leave their opinions out of it for those topics since eve related podcasts tend to invite people wanting to ~metagame~ in general, not as a knock against your people.
---
I like it a lot
---
Even with the footage they likely would not have known this, because you can tell if a hole is fresh, their biggest clue should have been the lack of fresh holes but even then like a year of seeding in freighters means a rather slow and careful process.
---
This works against the lazy eviction, that tries to do it's seeding in like a weekend but not against a long term seeding setup realistically if you have a larger group with a dedicated team that is willing to spend day and night seeding you hole your just dead, best you can do is save your shit. 
---
But revenge stories are the driving force of the entire game
---
Really? Leaving a project for a period of time is a death sentence. I'd rather they give this focus and knock it over.
---
This was one of the things to fix before 64-bit as well (I think?) so would be other reasons behind clearing the plate of this one.
---
And tremor sucks.
---
Too little too late. A post like this should have been made months ago.
---
Just now a fairly game-breaking issue is top dev priority? Just now you're waiting more still longer before you investigate whether maybe it should be walked back? You're just appeasing to buy time, but without even tossing a few days of skill points at us this time.
---
If CCP we're legitimately interested in the health of the game instead of something else, we'd have had this either fixed or reverted 6 months ago like any remotely similar issue in any successful MMO would have been. We'd have word or fixes on the other game-breaking bugs that are present currently. Etc.
---
But I'm afraid CCP doesn't care about the health of the game.
---
For not being a community we do some pretty awesome things.
---
you have the edge of a spoon.
---
Weren't you supposed to fuck off at some point after your massive bitchfit?
---
We are almost blue without being blue, bluetral as the cool kids say
---
Now THIS is E P I C
---
Lol.
---
This is ridiculous, I'm just an F1 monkey and you expect me to *read*? Just tell me what to use and when to shoot!
---
Everything is a made up narrative, that's how the game functions
---
Those people are bad.  The only AI that might care about your scram is the sleepers, and I think that stuff is still mostly hearsay.
---
Oh shit this is summa that old style EVE math but with better graphics. 11/10 OP
---
Snek Motel
---
I’m out of the loop . Who is he?
---
wtf. i h8 simple farmers now.
---
Now that we realize FW is a source of discontent for our players, we will spend a few months considering out options before we maybe go ahead with one of them. We night give you some extra LP for your trouble. Please keep buying skins. Thanks.
---
Does that fix anything when the people spamming them have endless pits of ISK?
---
Fancy some sprinkles with that?
---
I share your frustrations mate... most of your points (even though you were a little aggro with the delivery) are valid but lots of people with that hardcore mindset went in silence already so support for this stuff will be rare and unpopular at this point sadly :(
---
just to clarify where i agree and disagree
---
CITADELS
---
Totally agree. 1 Keepstar per region would be cool and a fix numbers of athanors per system for example. You can not limit the total number as an attacking force could be blocked out so there is that issue.
---
Damage Caps
---
I disagree. I see your point but damage caps on most citadels is a good thing for several reasons. Its good for an FC who wants to respond to a hostile fleet that he knows how much time he roughly has so he can actually form. Unless you are talking about XL stuff i think the damage cap is okay. Keepstars are clearly designed to not be killed by subs which makes me a little angry tbh (also keepstar doomsday applies to subs... wtf).
---
THREE TIMERS THAT LAST A WEEK TOTAL 
---
I agree. Easily fixed if you have to choose 2 final timers that are atleast 2days from each other. Ontop of that id like to see small citadels like astras raitarus and athanor have 2timers only.
---
ASSET SAFETY.
---
Probably the worst of them all. No incentive to kill those citadels since nothing drops. Weird is also that the isk people have to pay for asset safety goes to NPCs instead of the guys who actually killed it. 50% drop rate would be fair.
---
something id like to add to citadels:
---
They should not have any defenses unless they are being attacked. The good old station games that we all enjoyed for years are just gone. Epic fights could start with just two guys being in an ego contest on the undock.
---
MOONS
---
I'm not so sure about that one. Passive income was a problem before... especially in nullsec (0 content from them) but in lowsec those towers switched hands more often and people kept poking each others stuff. Also i think rorquals are in an okay place right now and they spawn just as much if not more content for everyone than moon towers did (and you dont have to form an entire fleet to just reff the damn thing and then go home). Lets not forget how shit reff ops actually were.
---
FARMS AND FIELDS
---
Agree. Local should be delayed at the very least in null security space (botting would be gone overnight just with that little change probably). Big groups should be forced to spread out a little more and with only one keepstar per region it would make everything a little bit more interesting.
---
SHIP BALANCE
---
Bubbleproof ceptors... what can i say... yes in theory they are better at doing there job now but it caused more negative things than anything else and its no shame to make mistakes but these half-fixes are really annoying. Nullified T3s are atleast not instant-warp and worth a few isk/sp so i think they are ok.
---
Keep your stuff and be ready to come back... we havent all given up yet! Maybe in an epic turn of events we get the game that love back to a healthier place.
---
i'm interested :D
---
Deal has been made, price will remain private unless buyer wishes to disclose.
---
How do CCP Guard and Falcon do it??
---
5 failed Attempts here going for the 6th campaign now, here is why.
---
I enjoy the discussion, its a passion for the game, and a will to want to make it better. It's the same with what I do in real life, I work Disaster response and recovery because I enjoy helping people, enjoy making the system work better and more efficiently, and I love problem-solving especially when dealing with multiple parties that don't necessarily agree its the crux of my job coordinating federal response with state and local levels as well as non profit and private sector partners, getting them all to agree on something is challenging but fun.   
---
why volunteer time for no pay... The community has given me a lot, it's been something I've learned on when times were hard and I figure for that its time to give back and hopefully people see my skillset and knowledge base of eve as something valuable. 
---
3d falloff axis lmao?
---
this is EVE we should be able to read that
---
This is just a miner update.
---
The CSM represents the player base. Listening to every single guy with a great idea is not realistic i think. If someones idea is great he should look for other players support first. You wouldn't believe what kind of stuff those guys get send all day and it for sure is exhausting. And in the end they are just normal dudes who sometimes misread or lose patience or do both at the same time so dont hold a grudge if shit like this happens.
---
Apply to eve university
---
There is no factual basis for this claim.
---
I think at this point everyone want this for all ammo types/weapons, nerds everywhere are drawing crude renditions. save us in your due time :)
---
I dont disagree with you, but since you asked...
---
Because there's more to Eve than you and your playstyle.
---
Awesome stuff! Keep winning! Hybrids and laser overlays pls!
---
&lt;3
---
once you start feeding tho every one else sees it then your getting farmed, and cant get any day to day shit done
---
why would you take out a fleet for a fight you 100% are gonna lose?
---
Does CCP pay well or no?
---
I personally like the Caldari shuttle because it looks like the Imperial Shuttles from Star Wars.
---
We get better fights out of Provi and Brave when we show up in meme fleets of Drakes and Nagas lol. 
---
Oi.  Good times.  Also, Waffles is recruiting ☆☆☆☆☆
---
I'd buy this and hang it proudly on my wall... that is outstanding
---
And you have the face for radio.
---
tapi mods in work deleting them posts
---
Where’s the button to delete someone else’s post? 
---
I notice you didn’t say being evicted, which is really what the OP is enquiring about.
---
I just looked it up. It is a controller for quadriplegics. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/227850484/quadstick-a-game-controller-for-quadriplegics
---
It looks very inventive and I do hope it works out for him. 
---
DC isnt good for passive shield fits. Low slot is better spent on a relay for more tank or a dps module.
---
Unless you're actually passionate about it and not just doing it for the money or prestige.
---
strong unique passwords and 2fa means you're vanishingly unlikely to be hacked in the first place
---
versus opt-in SP locks that provide no additional real security, only a false sense of it
---
like I get that people are afraid of the horror stories about how long it takes to get your stuff back when they get hacked. but if they put 1/100th the effort into securing their shit as they do asking CCP for locks, they could just rest easy.
---
It's the X next to your character on the login screen.
---
Yeah, the "music" sucks.
---
Wrong place, dude
---
Concise and to the point.
---
&gt; Skyler Altol:I mean I just threw away plans for the next 2 hours because I thought I was going to be on a stratop
---
&gt;Skyler Altol:and it's my fucking birthday. Come on TEST
---
Skyler, if you're here on reddit, my dude... if you're gonna get blue balls on your birthday at least make sure she's cute.
---
Remove tether without fuel blocks. Suddenly they're not a big deal.
---
Preach
---
Bro U replying 2 days later is v cringe my dude
---
"Beams... uhh Pulses.... Fucking use the one that can Scorch" - me
---
cringe
---
I love that. Thank you. 
---
Will print it  
---
Any chance you do one with Hybrids????
---
Yay! We did it!
---
Have fun man, you earned it. Enjoy your new toy. :)
---
Uh, more drone damage?
---
Just an idea. Could you put the bonuses/penalties in a sort of Bar chart thing? Like for hail the range would be a bar to the left, but damage would be to the right?
---
This overview is awesome and I am not saying my idea would be better, just throwing it out there.
---
I do hope you do these for other weapons, even though I think Projectiles is the hardest.
---
You begin to understand why TEST needs Goons backing them up at every turn.
---
I never get included in any of these leaks :(
---
You guys got a free anal rape on a POS. Hope you enjoyed it xD
---
I’ll keep your stuff safe for if you decide to come back and I’ll grow your isk so you can reinject stuff without worry. I hope you kept my phone number in case you need anything. Also rejoin slack so you can talk to all the other people that quit and we can all play other games.
---
Police fighters/drones, when?
---
https://puu.sh/CulSy/3d1e61ad02.png
---
HAHAHHAAHA OMFG IT WORKED
---
We did? 
---
To clarify a little, CCP pay for the flights, hotel, and a dinner. You can also get lunch and breakfast at the office.
---
It's _possible_ to go and not spend a lot, but there are always activities outside of the actual meetings. Dinner with other CSM members, so you have more time to talk over things, for example. and Iceland is an expensive country to eat out in. Lunch is often taken outside the office, again, so people can talk. (Yes, we could eat in the canteen, but having some distance from the devs makes talking easier, you know?)
---
And the drinking. (sometimes with devs, sometimes not. handy to meet with devs in a less structured environment, To just talk about shit.)
---
&gt; I'm cool with asset safety (as someone that takes business trips regularly) 
---
I agree with OP in that this is a mechanic that needs to go, or at least get heavily nerfed.  I'd settle for giving people an asset safety hangar with limited (but scalable) cargo space, so people could stash a few important things but not everything they own.
---
bahaha nice
---
https://puu.sh/CulWj/b33a11c005.png
---
Because I think I can help guide CCP away from some pitfalls (Not all, but there's stuff you've never heard about.) and towards some better results.
---
I like to think I've done more good than harm. Just one of those "I could help here, with something I consider important" things, you know?
---
Also happy birthday!
---
Yeah, that's kinda shitty. Happy B day little dino. 
---
Happy birthday skyler! I hope you have a great one
---
Apply to P0DLA.
---
Can you complete a Blood Raiders 10/10 with a standard ratting Rattlesnake without a prop mod? 
---
No, but if you were to make a ship in an eve ships likeness, change a few small details, and call it a "brasher" instead of a "thrasher" you could avoid civil litigation. 
---
If nobody in the game wants to fight you maybe the problem isn't everyone else in the game.
---
Happy bday dude, sorry you got bb'd
---
&gt; You guys got a free anal rape on a POS. Hope you enjoyed it xD

sorry my dude NEXT time ill make sure your on here ;)
---
MOM GET THE CAMERA!
---
God I laugh so hard when I read that
---
Thanks Trump! 
---
This is either a moving of the goalposts, or a misunderstanding.  The only article there that talks about people committing crimes to spend the night in jail is in England, not in the United States.
---
If the claim was that it was a British thing and I missed that, my bad.  It would make sense, since British jails are much more humane than American ones.
---
The next three are about people being arrested for being homeless, not seeking out jail time.
---
You go get your alliance update sorted and preparing for upcoming weekend of content :P
---
I thought you couldn’t run abyssals on sisi, or did they change that?
---
That's how I learned a couple months ago, did they change it?
---
Countdown to PCGamer article in 3...2...1...   
---
"EVE Online player scams online community for real gold, and you won't believe what happens next!"
---
It's really unfortunate CCP is taking this direction. The cut-throat universe is what made EVE so unique from every other videogame.  It's also unfortunately human nature to want to take the path of least resistance, being in a huge risk-free blob is some people's idea of fun. 
---
I once let out a little rant on a few subjects which you've covered to a buddy of mine, and he told me "It's just the life of an spaceship terrorist, it'll never be easy and odds will always be against you." I don't remember word for word, but it's what he meant. He's very right about that. The engagements that give you the shakes afterwards are always the super tough ones where it seemed like everything was against you.
---
I'm not 100% sure who you are in game, maybe I've fought against or alongside you. I've probably never even met you. You sound like a small gang type. Being one myself it's very unfortunate that you're leaving, yet I wish you the best on your future endeavours. 
---
Most battle-hardened force in EVE sends its best hurfers to Oij local and all they blurf about is how they identify as second-rate lumpymayos. That's a... unique aspiration.
---
In all seriousness though, I like having you dinopilots around.
---
lol yes sometimes imperium and test work together to either bridge each other to certain places or to team up to kill a much hated foe.  enemy of my enemy and all that.  Other times we bring multiple fleets all day to their staging...so it depends 'what is going on.  We are frenemies...imperium and legacy fight....and if something strategic comes up...then maybe one lets the other bridge to go fight.  It all depends.  imperium and legacy are neutral though...that is for sure.
---
Not everything is a conspiracy
---
I think they were originally available on sisi, then ccp got rid of them because they wanted to add the risk to players of making them learn the hard way on tranquility. Maybe they added them back, but they were gone a couple months ago
---

Already dead

This is the most beautiful thing I have seen this year.
---
lmao, some mod has been scammed before....
---
How long do 3mil worth of t1 filaments take to run? My guess is the isk/h on that wasn't that great compared to some other alternatives.
---
I don't understand why TEST would push the Horde Fort into final, post an op, pre-ping your members and then play the "Haha made you form!" card.  If we "wasted our time" saving the Fortizar, you surely "wasted" your time RFing it in the first place.  It's disingenuous to your membership to play that game. Why not just admit that you would have liked to frag the Fort tonight but the 200 carriers sat on it dissuaded you from trying?
---
As must as I want to be like "lawl gg ccp", it *only* took them 10 months to roll back this feature, while it took *years* to roll back Incarna.
---
Bellicose
---
Of course, but in this example those people are a disgustingly small minority. 
---
I miss nick
---
A very tart and bellicose response good sir, dare I say a challenge of class is in order!
---
Honest to god no clue. Probably drugs? 
---
Oof. I'm sorry if you cant anymore. I'll check tomorrow when I'm able to get on, and have the article edited if that is incorrect. 
---
It's how I learned, and if CCP took it off that's really lame. 
---
A 3-D plot of this with damage as Z-axis would be neat...
---
&gt;A previous bug that let you put any skin
---
There's still a bug that can cause it.  It's a very specific thing you have to do to cause it to appear, and it only is on the model for a fraction of a second (Need to record gameplay to really see it), but it's still there.
---
Because then they would also have to admit that they tried reffing multiple structures and entosis while said 200 carriers were sat there, but failed.
---
Don't do level 4s.
---
Better living through Chemistry, capsuleer!
---
Speaking of drugs.. Have you ever played Danger Game?

Really, it is.  With 4 rollers you can rage roll till you get an active pocket (usually 2-3 rolls tops).   Go play, then do it all over.  We (Kronos Ritual) regularly get what I'd call "awesome holes" which IMO is anything less than 10 jumps from a major nullbloc staging.  Go out and pester the locals or tackle a capital ship until a response fleet comes to kill you.   Then kill them (hopefully).  Then roll again.

Shout out to Brave!   &lt;3 you guys! Y'all always bring a fight!

Sounds like a great idea, Can i give you 300 Million dollars to think about making it into a game one day.
---
Better ways to make iskies but if you're not into null sec blocks, it's a way to keep you busy.  I made a good start for high sec living salvaging and reprocessing pirate junk while running lvl 4s but there is much more to make living in null.....

Yes, but you cannot make money off of it. You can put almost anything in art and it's considered free use, but if you make money on it then they have grounds to sue
---
Oh and regarding blue balls on my birthday, yeaaaa that's already happened, and yes she's cute.
---
Points for pre-empting the "can i have your stuff" question
---
Remember when NC. pushed a TEST fort into final, post an op, pre-ping all their members, feed 80b to do it, and then let it repair?
---
Yeah that happened like 2 weeks ago.
---
Cheers! Will do haha :P
---
Nah you could, the typical Icelandic glacial delay is the problem. 
---
the fact is i was listening to this song during that fight entire time.
---
felt so dangerous and exciting tho.
---
Yes, but this was a lone TEST guy, in the middle of TKE. That narrative might work if say, it was a fleet that you guys crossjump en route to timers, but this was hours before anything was going on for either side, in the middle of renter space.
---
That narrative only works on so few levels. Just come out and say you guys are allied, and be done with it.
---
Looks nice but I think the chart should have 2 versions, auto cannon and artillery.

That way the true relative positions are revealed after the weapon multipliers.

Infographics are cool tho.

Anchoring freedom is currently a step up from where it started which was actual invulnerability. But, if we're being honest here, that invulnerability, along with all the other issues you have with structures, was probably considered required for people to use them in the first place, at least from the perspective of CCP as a business. For the concept of citadels be perceived as stomach-able by the players, CCP probably thought they had to give these new structures cool new features, and make them difficult to destroy and easily accessible, otherwise, why would the players use them over what they currently had?    
---
Traditionally they have to put the old tap dancing shoes on and sell it to us. This is why you initially see a terrible game-breaking change (pick a mechanic in the last 10 years that greatly altered the game, and was implemented, and wasn't tap danced as something better for the player than it's current state), followed by nerfs or buffs to get things more balanced... eventually?. Citadels are a bit more complex than say, the capital overhaul or ship balancing in general, as POSes are directly linked to other mechanics in the game (wormholers, production, moon mining, jump gates, etc) that effect a number of players greater than any single ship or fitting change, so they feel like they have to phase it in and gain adoption rates that make them feel comfortable as a business before they hit that magical "oops we fucked it, now how do we revert this?" moment (seriously, you have no idea how hard it would be to revert structures to POSes without rolling back the server - just the location and ownership of the POSes would be a nightmare, and when you throw assets in there, it'd be cheaper to hand out some free SP and an apology for the rollback and hope no one leaves as a result).    
---
If you started with "Hey guys, tomorrow were gonna drop these new citadels into the game, and all the POSes are gonna go offline, and citadels can be attacked when you drop them, even though for a region you need to drop like 100+ of them so you can't logically babysit all of them, and that will need to be almost overnight or you'll lose currently existing functionality and regional control that you invested time and/or money to setup, also were not really sure what were gonna do with your assets that are still in POSes, also when the citadel dies, all your stuff will drop, also they can be attacked by like 50 dreads or 10 titans and eat shit almost instantly, how's that sounds?" The response that you would hear would be the sound of your to-be acquisition from Pearl Abyss going the way of the dodo as your subscription rate drops like 20% minimum, probably more. It's just too much change all at once, and the majority of people, while fond of small change, are not fond of big change. Citadels, as they exist today, just barely ride the line of "Fine, I guess I'll live with it" for most people.  
---
Now, is that the best thing for the game 36-48 months after you implemented it? Maybe not, but you have investors, and if you don't get them that sweet, sweet return on investment, regardless of your position at the company, you will be unemployed very shortly, because unless they were rich and also retarded, the deal they signed when they invested gave them control over a percentage of the company's votes.  
---
When you say "CCP should grow some fucking balls" what you are really asking for is either "a board of directors that's full of RL focused, monocle wearing, monopoly men to actually play a game made by a company they own a part of, and actually spend enough time in there to care more about it than their bank account growing, which was the initial intent of investing in the first place" or "an employee of that company that eventually reports to that board to go against it and risk their own personal financial/professional future". This would be like if you worked at Wal-Mart as a Jr. Manager and I, your customer, told you that you should "grow some balls" and drop the price on some items, and while you might lose some money today, over time you'd make more due to volume. It's not wrong per-say, but it's simply not your decision to make. It's not even your bosses, bosses, bosses decision to make and if you made that change without getting it blessed from on high, you might get fired, sued, or worse.   
---
Like, let's be real here for a sec - Do you honestly believe that dudes as into Eve PvP as Raivi, Verone, and Kil2, don't want to create a system that rewards difficult play, punishes laziness, and perpetuates content? I mean don't take my word for it, go look at what they tell you themselves "from a personal opinion, and not in any way the standpoint of CCP as a company". Like... each one of these guys used to take time out of their real lives to host a space pixel contest that's one of the only places in Eve that doesn't benefit a blob in any way (minus maybe initial funding?) and does require people to be individually skilled pilots. All to keep you entertained and explain mechanics most people didn't even understand at the time. Each one of them also took time out of their play sessions to contribute to the community in a real way, through leadership, theory-crafting (before the word existed in the context of Eve), and/or making videos for you nerds, that, to a number of people, greatly affected their ability to generate and perpetuate content in the form of PvP, or drew them into the game to begin with. It's not about the change they want, it's about the change they are allowed to make.   
---
The truly hilarious thing here is that way back when, Hillmar created a game of ruthless capitalism that you nerds love the shit out of and has stood the test of time, but every time that a remotely capitalistic concept is applied to that RL company (which you should love, because it means the lights can stay on just a little longer even if they dim ever so slightly), everyone loses their minds and expects this thing to run like a hippie commune funded by some benevolent billionaire...   
---
I know it's not what you want to hear, but the world just isn't that simple man, even though it's a game, it's a game run by a company, that company employs people, and those people have responsibilities, both personal and professional, and for most of the world, 8-12hrs a day, you really shouldn't make those "ballsy decisions", because for them to be ballsy, there's a risk that most people probably shouldn't take. If you want to play a game that can listen to it's very niche audience, take gambles, and implement things that appeal to that niche without needing to run it by Captain Moneybags to see if he's gonna call an audible, you should probably go play an Indie game that is garage-based and has literally no intent on bringing on investors. But good luck with that, if it's anywhere near successful, the money vampires will find them and make them an offer they can't refuse... and probably shouldn't.

Nothing to do with PA, this is wholly a hilmar and accounting dept thing, they're after whales, the rest can lump it.

---
I can't speak for NC, but I had fun, and the impression I got from the other cap beans was that they did too.  We jumped in supers and carriers and fragged a ton of hostile fighters.
---
Did NC post a follow-up op for this, hype and then not show under the guise of making the enemy form? I am asking sincerely.   
---
That's what my post refers to -- misleading your members that you will be attending a big timer and then blue-balling them at the 11th hour.  There's no shame in saying "the enemy formed a prohibitively big fleet, and we don't feel like welping.", but I think it's incredibly lame to honeydick your members under false pretext like you did tonight.
---
Wow awesome!!  Other ammo types too plz!!!
---
&gt;there's probably dozens of case studies of people doing similar things with the same technologies

Doubt it.

MMO games rarely if ever change their chat systems. And you're talking about an indie developed backend system that is only now purging code from 2003 from the game.
---
Im glad they are considering reverting to the old system for now but I hope this isnt the end of the upgrade and that they try again later down the road if they cant get it working by the end of January.
---
Lemme get this straight. You have NIPs and NAPs in place. You have agreements not to kill significant assets like rorqs or ratting supers. You form and coordinate for each other's strategic objectives even if they don't impact you. You have the same enemies and the same allies - but you're 100% definitely not blue because you sometimes do fun roams in each other's space?
---
Thanks for the info, how long was the summit?
---
Actually the Eve Client is fine.
---
The backend it connects to is a 16 year old mess of code that idealy could be cut in half in complexity once they pull out the legacy calls to ALL the old code not just the "LoL Legacy Outpost code" stuff.
---
Its when new stuff tries to interact with the existing blob of code that things like the chat system goes apeshit.

Well then they can legit say there wasnt an issue with the New Chat system and bring it back. And instead of a broken old chat system that cant handle future upgrades we can get a broken new chat system that can handle future upgrades and can focus on just fixing it instead of swapping back and forth.

Oh, has horde been running burst jammer fleets? Nice

Join the chat channel for Pro Synergy. They're an EVE corp who will do your salvage for you for a cut of the profits. It's an efficient way to make some ISK off of your mission salvage without having to manage it all yourself. You're also usually helping out a newbro to make their first ISK in the game.
---
Yup, but it is still a test guy in a renter space you are trying to disrupt that he is likely there for too so what's the point in killing him?
---
Colour = dmg type? If so, phased plasma is wrong. The 17% should be grey. 
---
We did it vs LegImp titans; don't think we've tried it since.

He is referring to the burst fleet horde used in ualx(?) whatever the french keepstar was.

Also hi lumpy. big fan of your previous pos work.

They don't NEED it. They're just super best friend pals!

It's more of a rubberbanding issue in this case, your ships are already on grid according to the server and your client still thinks they are in warp, it might be an issue with ccp but i'd check if you are not losing packets
---
Legit response. Reality dealt!
---
They mostly just hasten transition to the state of the game that is set up by the rest of its mechanics though, which are mostly outlined in the post.
---
Tremor is amazing, if you have enough to alpha
---
This is really a non-issue. Skins are purely cosmetic, and any obtainable from the store can also be purchased purely through in-game means.
---
Also, you're buying a skin for some of the most expensive ships in the game. For anyone that's already at that point, 700 plex isn't really that much money. In reality, that's only a week of light to moderate super ratting or mining. 
---
Probably something like china and NK are best buds and nk hates sk so china hates sk too?
---
That or just the standard chinese laws like you said.
---
Same man, love taking people that never had any pvp experiance before out there. Even vni kills get them pumped up and asking for next roam
---
It was worth it though. In the end they pinged more and formed more people than us. So they wasted more of their own time than we did ours. 
---
Only if you promise to alienate and ignore your playerbase for profit.  
---
not to mention a lot of those cosmetics bind to your accounts not your characters so if you buy it once, you get it on all of your characters not just one.

Yeah right

People who are used to it don't notice it as much.
---
do me a favour brisc.
---
float this idea at the next CSM meeting you have; SKIN extractors.
---
maybe i wouldn't give a fuck about dropping 700 plex on a skin if i knew for a small fee i could extract it and get most of my money back, even if that money was isk and i couldn't then convert it back to real money.
---
I could still support CCP by consuming the extractors, and they could still charge offensive prices for plex without me being quite so offended by it.
---
Implying everyone have time to do "week of light to moderate super ratting or mining"
---
It's just stupid that skins is so overpriced when you're only one who look at it. Why not let everyone enjoy it instead of wasting all of their isk on single skin.
---
This game is a space soap opera for nerds lol
---
Are value packs always available or only limited times?
---
Leave the game in a better state than when you found it?
---
HA. 
---
You've had a bigger hand in leaving the game in a worse place honestly.
---
shame that argument doesn't hold for anything that's not a subcap.
---
800m for a skin on a &lt;100m isk ship? c'mon.
---
Very nice
---
Um ... ok I'll he that guy what's the number?
---
With benefits. 
---
Agreed, Scorch is broke, don't tell CCP they might nerf rapid lights, wait....
---
Remove local now!

Make  Medium Structures more expensive.

2-3bil base price. 
---
See how much people want to spam them then.
---
Pot calling the kettle black.  Horde by itself would get steamrolled by TEST, but Horde never fights by itself.  NCPL are always there holding their hands while PH complains that the other guys brought friends.
---
What are you talking about.
---
Whales in this game sit in Supercarrier and Titans. They don't even pay subscription with $ anymore.
---
A warpspeed Jew Nyx with damageapplication instead of tank and ascended implant set gets 180mil ticks.
---
This guy needs like 4 hours to farm for a 695 skin.
---
Those 695 skins are all capitals.
---
If a fcking capitalpilot whines about not having the ISK for that, *THEN START RATTING YOU DIPSHIT!*
---
Subcapital pilots why do you even bother.
---
I don't consider anything that I can casually farm in about 3-4 days "expensive".
---
its 4 hours of farming
---
wtf are you talking about "worth the price"
---
you look cool after 4 hours of ratting while watching netflix.
---
695 are all capital skins, so you allrdy have a capital to print isk with.
---
even with fulltank supercarrier you need about 10hours of farming... thats like 3-4 days?
---
much efford
---
Alliances/Coalitions blue each other for specific ops? Like that has never been done before, lol.

To abuse the status and try to advance my alliance instead of the game obviously.

---
&gt;This is what you get when you forget this is a video game where it's fun to shoot other people and not a geopolitics simulator.
---
The politics are literally the only fun bit, like smileys people on crack. Unless of course you still get the shakes from hitting orbit+f1, then I guess 'shooting' could be described as fun. 
---
Didn't even know this was a thing, that's awesome can't wait till we can plug games straight into the brain.
---
Depends on the mission. Tags can be good. 
---
I'm dropping mtu just for sake of it. With nano sigil it's just a minute to collect 5 mtu or more and it's an additional few mil. 
---
With salvage I haven't checked yet 
---
I flew a Bellicose yesterday!
---
We needed a webbing/TPing ship for a Moa fleet where a Huginn would've been too expensive to put on the field, so... Bellicose.
---
tbqh they got so outplayed by the test fc its going over their head haha go dinos!
---
Like watching paint dry being on similar level to carrier ratting and great action when compared to mining 
---
you can find like-minded people who arn't in the same corp as you ;)
---
Welcome to the Internet. Trolls are a constant. It's up to you to react to them or ignore them. 
---
When I ran L4s I used a MTU, dropped at the start of the fight... launched salvage drones when I was done and cleaned up my trash.. takes a bit of time, but I did missions to chill so..
---
...I then switched to a Noctis.. bm the MTU, then come back... faster if the mission site was close to the station..
---
Is it the best isk? Obviously not but over time when I only had a little time to pew and chill it added up fairly quickly...
---
Omen
---
On the contrary lv4s, when blitzed for burners, are the highest isk per hour you can make in high sec solo (no alts) besides trading. Afaik at least. I net 200+ mil an hour, much more if I get a good drop.
---
i don't know what you want me to say here. i know what trolls are and how to deal with them. but i don't see a troll in this guy just someone being a jerk.
---
tbh its quite PATHETIC that you insunuate that test and goons are friends.. its obviously not my friend you just have to look at the facts.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74506291/
---
as you can see they shoot each other? so im not sure why you wanna think otherwise tqbh its obvious
---
&lt;3 isn't there a video about that? to google!
---
I don’t really run them back to back. And I don’t really care about the Isk per hour. I play the game to enjoy it. Not trying to bash people that do care about that, just playing the game how I like!
---
If it helps, you can also drag the blueprint from the industry window in to your personal hanger.
---
There are too many ways for this to happen 😣
---
eh with the rebalance the triple shield extender bellicose is pretty damn good for a t1 cruiser.
---
Horde doesn't have caps. 
---
You do you man, it's just a common thing to point out, I would say the majority of people view isk/hr as the primary concern when pveing. I'd be surprised if 3m in t1 filaments didn't turn into 500m isk, probably wasn't luck. You should try harder ones though imo. The risk of potentially losing a ship for the increased reward (approx three times previous tier value for each tier) makes abyssal much more fun imo. 
---
I certainly never made one. Another popular one was the bait Celestis with small blasters and shit. I think that fit may have made it into a couple of pvp videos.
---
Hodor, Hodor Hodor. Hodor Hodor!
---
We never had a ping for that op. If you wanted to know whether or not we were doing it in advance, you just had to look at our op calendar on the website, and you would know we had nothing planned. 
---
Blueballing is find. Lying about it to your line members means that you’re basically blue balling your own line members just as bad as the enemy’s. 
---
Let's be honest here, without the Horde human shield as Eve's favorite fodder  NC/PL would be hamboned. Protecting Horde sov IS protecting their own. 
---
Nc/pl/horde are in the same coalition, always have been. What about test?
---
Also, We glorious Horde fodder Love the content war with our dino friends. It's adorable to watch them pilot with those tiny vestigial arms.
---
Panfam is all one coalition, we don’t pretend to be completely separate.
---
 If you’re saying that Test’s relationship with goons is similar to our relationship with NC/PL, then I’d agree with you.

Paying 10s of billions more to fit slightly officer/abysal mods to your super/titan - everything is fine. Spending 2b on a skin - REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
We pinged literally once, unless you count the pre ping 6 hours before. In which case we pinged twice. 
---
You're very unapproachable and come off as doing only for recognition. All memes and shit aside, real talk, you did a terrible job during your tenure. What olmeca said about you is absolutely correct.
---
Read the OP. Ya'll pinged at least 6 times. Why waste our time as much as you guys are? Best to let you guys burn yourselves out and never fight so we can win the objective in like 3 weeks time when you guys won't even ping at all.
---
That would probably be the best compromise to the situation.
---
And on another note one thing I really wish they would add to asset safety is the ability to see in the Personal Assets window what the asset safety wrapped packages actually contains. I came back to the game after 3½ years of being unsubbed, and I had 6  wrapped packages across three characters. One of them held my Archon. Another held an Impel and a whole bunch of faction pos modules and a tower. The other 4 held cyno Ibises or single modules. but I couldn't check them without spending two hours jumping around the universe. While I was glad to find the carrier, I spent over an hour extra traveling to open the other worthless packages.
---
useless shit are those Faction titans... Better rework Leviathan... Remove Sub-cap drones for supers and Subcap guns for Titans. Those ship had another idea not sitting in anomaly or hotdroping roaming gang.
---
Not rocket science but sending messages between thousands of users, registering who needs to receive what at any time and delivering these messages to everyone even people behind strange networks is not exactly easy neither.
---
And adding the goal of not using the same server as the rest of the game to reduce the load on an aging monolithic server does not simplify things.
---
I remember my WH corp four or five years ago flying a Shield Navy Harby doctrine with Pulses. Because of the tracking bonus and two TEs, it could track even the smallest shit that people would throw at us, and with Skirmish links and a nano in the lows, it was really speedy for a BC hull.
---
You can probably still do this in a small gang setting.
---
Feeding 80b to kill a fort is completely fine when the fort absolutely, positively needs to die. Legacy did it to the Skill U fort they dropped in Impass; they were going to drop a Keepstar immediately after it anchored. Good work on killing that fort NCBL.
---
It takes literslly under a minute to send out a ping so that’s pretty irrelecamt. I’d also imagine forming up for, and reffing the two other timers, in addition to members getting ready for the final one takes way more time in total thsn just waiting for a single of those timers to repair.
---
Ok, we pinged two times the day of the fight, including the pre ping. One more pre ping the day before. But I went back a few days in discord and still don’t see anything else. 
---
And let’s see, you formed three times for this, and to your line members it looks like you didn’t even try anything. We formed once, and completed the main objective, so even if we don’t finish up on either of the things we reinforced, we still didn’t put nearly as much effort into this as y’all did. 
---
Also, our FC’s/directors didn’t blatantly lie to our line members, for what was ultimately no gain at all. I doubt that is going to help your numbers. 
---
I noticed his alt recently, hmm.....
---
Ammo damage scaling, you used the bubble radius instead of the area did you?

That gives a bad viz of the puts a big visual emphasis on the high damage ones. Otherwise it's neat
---
&gt; That narrative only works on so few levels. Just come out and say you guys are allied, and be done with it. 
---
but then we couldn't go roam into their space and they couldn't feed caps in GAY anymore either. That would make both parties sad. 
---
I am talking about when you try and log into any Eve related website using your Eve Username/Password. So even if someone cracks your email, they still cannot log into your account without the code from your Authenticator even if they manage to somehow change the password.

Yes, isn't that the definition of "frenemies"?
---
Strategically allied, but set neutral for content? I don't know how this is such a foreign concept to r/eve

yeah that's how it is mmmhmm
---
How does it work? What are the prices based on what? Area? Site? Based off profit margins? Interested in either both selling and/or buying :)
---
GOTTEM
---
I mean, it doesn't really matter that we lost the "objective" today, we only need to win it once. We can just keep reffing it and forcing you guys to form to save it. You'll burn out and we'll win. It's as simple as that.

We probably would've fought you guys today as well, if you hadn't phoned so many groups to come help you, I'm only a junior FC so I couldn't take over the fleet. But I doubt anyone would've gone in to feed the massive you guys needed to form.
---
sooo, unsub and stop giving fucks? i did. i come here and to star\_citizen\_refunds just for luls, meanwhile play another games , some of them are shit, some of them are great.  fells good
---
It's not hard to join Horde on some random alpha, join their discord, and check for yourself.
---
I count 2 pings for the fleet itself, and 2 pre-pings going back to the weekend. All by alphastarpilot.
---
So either they deleted their pre-pings (which is unlikely cos I don't recall them anyway although they might have been lost in the absolute pingspam), or Seadoo is just lying. 
---
Like what the fuck is wrong with just saying that those idiots just outformed us by batphoning everyone? This isn't even strategy any more. It's just pride and ego.
---
You're talking a lot of shit and jumping on Brsics dick when he was the one who banned you from the CSM discord. Honestly, you have no idea what what opinions I express internally but I'd say that my opinions as shown by the CSM summit minutes for the last few years have been very anti big bloc.
---
Nah, you guys formed so many dudes and wasted your own time it was very obviously a win for us. Keep salting lmfao! 🤣
---
Use optimal+falloff for the x axis instead of just optimal. Almost nobody uses autocannons within their optimal.
---
Progod needed the 4th straight night off to write his alliance update ok!
---
Lol? The only thing Goons can't do to test is attack  their structures and sov, everything else is fair game. Your spy game is shit of you think otherwise. 
---
You PL dudes are getting soft in your old age. It's like you learned nothing from invading Esoteria. This is a WAR. Not some little play fight. We will use whatever tactics needed to win in the field. If that makes you guys as salty as this I can't wait to keep doing it lmao.

They are in general a broken mechanic! No matter if during anchoring or while being attacked with timezone-tank .... able to get spammed everywhere .... with 3 timers ....

Attacking a dude on his appearance while hiding behind anonymity, classic. You must be proud of yourself.
---
OP needs to find a life
---
That's what I put down for the "what kind of challenges would you like to see in the future" question:
---
&gt;Certainly not the kind I saw this time. I have participated in almost every event in the past two years and this one was by far my least favorite. It was also the first I was unable to complete due to not having mining skills and being forced into performing mining activities (which I am not interested in) without the possibility to re-roll the challenges. 
---
&gt;The challenges of "kill someone in a mining ship" were even more ill-conceived and reflect a lack of understanding in how pvp operates in game. All it did was to encourage players to kill themselves with alt accounts. This character lives in lowsec Khanid, there were five constellations with event systems. I didn't see any activity in those, and only two kills in the span of two weeks, so the event failed to create pvp opportunities.
---
&gt;The challenges to kill enemies using specific weapon types were inconvenient and unnecessary, forcing players to haul different ships into the event systems.
---
&gt;I also do not appreciate the requirement for mining to construct cerebral accelerators. They should just drop as an item and be available to all players, not just to those multiboxing orca fleets in highsec.
---
&gt;Based on the challenges I saw in this event, I would not recommend the game to a friend. I abandoned it at about 200 agency points.
---
forgot to mention performance problems, whoops. Fortunately they [had the graphical/fov issues covered](https://i.imgur.com/nU0I1iR.png).
---
There is no specific answer to your question as it requires an actual suite to commence .. however there are four ways to assert the impact of of your work on CCP.
---
What is the purpose of the composition and how it affects CCP business / market .. I don’t think you’d be high on the litigation list and if you’re producing fan work it would be PR suicide to take you down - if ... and massive big ... if .. they wanted to proceed with a suite.
---
https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview
---
You’d come under the same as the fair use legalities ..
---
What would however cross the line is if you incorporate their trademarked logo into the composition as a reasonable person would infer its likely an attempt to represent the official position of CCP..
---
Anyway only true way to find your answer is after you create and wait 🤪
---
I use them in my art comps all the time and if CCP have issue you’re more than welcome to come test my law degree out 😘
---
What area do you want to play in? Mission/Rat? Industry? Business/Haul? PvP?
---
Right. Because if we form 1/3rd of the times you do, and our leadership doesn’t lie to us, like yours does, we will clearly burn out first. 
---
Groups such as yours thrive on "gud fites" to thrive. If we blue ball you enough you will stop forming. 
---
St. Wally can save you.  Just leave your alliance.
---
I'm in the same fucking alliance as you....Good thing we don't have so many of your type. You need to take this shit way less seriously.
---
Or at least find something irl to take seriously.  
---
All this shit talk about WAR and winning at any cost over a damn video game lmao. 
---
I was able to complete everything in a grand total of 3 ships, a prospect, a praxis, and a hacking frigate. The weapon size missions could be done by simply slapping medium or small weapons on the BS hull. Yeah the pvp missions were stupid, should have been things like kill a mining/hacking vessel in the event rooms instead. And making the boosters require minerals mined in the event was a way to prevent people from treating the event as a limited SP faucet, so I wouldn't expect them to go back to just handing those out as drops.
---
Why would I not take this seriously? These are the same people that came to Esoteria with more than over half of EVE and talked about how they were going to shit on us. They are they enemy, and will be treated as such.
---
I notice, that's why I'm buying it. 
---
WOOP WOOP
---
Not gonna lie - if I had a lot of space available on my walls, I'd abuse the shit  out of my large format printer at work to get a poster-sized version...
---
I'd prefer hybrid- and missile-versions tho :)
---
Gorgeous.
---
If you think the community gives a fuck about some autist who thinks hes hot shit because he spent daddies inheritance on a cloaky bot army then your not on this planet brother..
---
Meanwhile, your group has absolutely no problem forming for bs stratops, as the logs in the post clearly show
---
Lmao what about all the times NC. "reset" horde? Just be honest dude, test and goons have the same relationship that NC and some of the northern dudes have with you where if there is no one threatening your space you are neutral for content just like Imperium and legacy are right now. There is no difference tbh.
---
Idea: Pick a standard artillery and autocannon and calculate optimal+2/3 falloff, and use this as "range". Each T1 type will get 2 dots, then, and the autocannon dots will be very close together.
---
Test were in the same coalition as goons for a long time, then moved out of home to make their own. 
---
I can't ever see ph doing the same.
---
Daddy not choke you hard enough today?? lmao
---
Merely a false flag operation to lull you guys into a false sense of security. You all will think that our form ups have been in hurt and won't ping as hard, in reality we'll be stronger than ever and we'll win the objective and catch you off guard.
---
Pretty sure it's just Icelandic for "haha funny xd"

---
Please, all of you cancelling plans with significant others for eve timers.
---
Have a fucking word with yourself, and get your priorities sorted.
---
Eve isn't a particularly good game, and it'll still be there tomorrow.
---
Disregarding some one who actually gives a shit about you when you already had plans  in favour of a game that isn't even that great is a fantastic way to ensure they won't be there tomorrow.
---
&gt; less money on a sustainable 23/7 basis than there is in sov null with infinite respawn isk faucet combat anoms. 
---
That is simply not true at all. Let's say that you make 30 million per tick as a botter. The bot runs for 20 hours, that means that he makes 1.8 billion per day. In wh space, you make 1 bil per C5 anomaly, billions for gas, planetary interaction, etc.   
---
The reason there are no bots in WH space is that local is delayed making it risky to bot. Replacing ships is not hard isk-wise, but logistics wise it is.   
---
Let's say that a botter right now runs 10 bots, losing 1 ship per month in 0.0. He has to replace 10 ships per month. That's easy, he just brings 100 ships once per year.   
---
Now, imagine delayed local and let's say that he loses a ship per day (realistically it would be even more because 20 hour botting means at least one guy will catch you). Now you have to replace 10 ships per day, meaning that you need to run your logistics supply every 10 days instead of once per year.  
---
Ok, easy peasy you would say. A botter needs to make a profit. There's no point in running your PC to bot if the cost of botting is greater than plex or if you RMT the price of isk is greater than PLEX, right? Let's say that the botter still makes a profit out of all this, his ROI would be through the floor.   
---
Let's say that the ROI will still be there, but the price of RMT isk is now 80% of Plex isk. Will people still buy RMT isk if it's just as expensive?   
---
The way to combat botting is putting them out of business, making it economically infeasible for  them to exist.
---
:thinking: seems familiar
---
It simply amazes me how eve try hards like Banana still have no clue what is going on in the game. For someone who logs in as much as you, you'd think you have a basic grasp on the politics you spend every free moment of your day posting over 
---
I also run, or used to run, a ton of abyss sites, in various fits, ships, tried a few set ups. And I whole heartedly disagree with you on several aspects, but do agree on some others.
---
1. Bots. T1 and T2 sites can be to some extent botted or AFK farmed in VNIs requiring only some input. However, their income is so abysmal (abyssal) that I am surprised they are done in this fashion at all. I think even the T2 cargo mission botting is more profitable. My guess (and mind you this is only a guess) is that these AFKers / bots belong to the some large block who need the materials for ships and ammo as they would like to make more of them in order to start including them in their doctrines. Find the people benefiting from the regular bots like Rorqs and Super ratting and ban their asses along with removing all the assets / ISK from the game that came from them, and these will go away as well. Alternatively, make some small random changes to the T1 and T2 Abyss sites, maybe NPCs, spawns or something, just enough to confuse bots and AFKers.
---
2. About the timer. Do you want the Abyss event back so they can collect data again and try to find out ***again*** as to why people stopped running the content ? it wasn't that long ago afterall. Of course the same crowd that was arguing about how wardecs kept newbies in the game and how good wardecs were / are for new player retention will throw out a whole bunch of arguments here as well. if the devs listen to them then we'll be back to square one. Decline to pre-event levels. I personally do not want this to happen. While there are exceptional players such as yourself, high and mighty, there is still a crapton of ships being lost in T4, T5 Abyss every day and every week, just check the killboards. So risk vs reward is still risky. Just like there are exceptional players who are good at single aspect of the game that is hard for other people, there are exceptional people doign Abyss. Congrats on being one of them, however most aren't. 
---
3. Loot. Loot is screwed up. It went just weird when they put the whole drill sites into the game and has been weird / messed up since then. I do feel T4 and T5 sites especially are too underwhelming. Add to this that the goal was to make the Abyss building mats cheap and plentiful so that many more people use and play with the Triglavian stuff. Well, that still has a ways to go. While prices came a bit down on some ships like Leshak, Vedmak, they went up or are roughly the same but swinging wildly on ammo, guns, sinks, etc. Add to that the new ships, and thus more demand offsetting any of the materials gains, all the while the Abyss novelty is wearing off and people are runnign it less or in some cases stopped and went back to what they were doing before. So much more needs to be done in this regard.
---
4. On filament costs. I do not run Gamma or Exotic, in fact, I make a ton selling them off. I end up running about half the Electricals I get, dark and fire. And I make a crapton on gamma and exotics. If you do run primarily those, then that is 100% on you, double this if you are an advanced player as you say. You can easily make 50% more ISK if you jsut learn the otehr filaments. yes, they require different ships, different set ups, you won't be taking your exotic / gamma with shield implants into the Dark filaments. You'll be taking a Vaga or Munin or Vedmak or Sac or something else. Or you'll be taking a Zealot or Phantasm into electrical, and you won't be using same clones, same implants or boosters either.
---
So T4, T5 Abyss does need a loot adjustment, particularly when it comes to building mats, the otehr day I rand some T4s and T5s, was doing 4x4 blocks, and I ran into a right down silly number of ***empty*** drill caches and 1-2 ***empty*** regular caches. ***Empty*** fucking boxes man, I was pissed. talk about not profitable. And this shit was supposed to patched way back when, well guess what, something is screwed up and it got unpatched or whatever.
---
What the Abyss also needs is some NPC and weather adjustments to make them easier / friendlier for turret ships while a bit more difficult for drone boats. Shift the meta a bit away from teh Gila and drones in general all while making some positive changes to it.
---
Do you often find yourself walking into glass doors and such? I can't imagine how difficult it must be living with the intelligence of a dove.

You have my sympathies.

I agree wit ha lot of people here, 2FA should be required for extraction.

Standard pubbie reply I guess. You can't win the argument so you resort to petty attacks on someone's person instead. Ben Shapiro would be disappointed in you.

There is no argument here, though. Just delusional rambling. My post was purely out of concern, not an attempt to win som non-existent argument.

You're welcome.
---
I don't understand asset safety. I know what it is but I don't understand why it exists.
---
The politics of the solo life are boring tho. 
---
I share your pain about how players are forced to mining ships.        
---
I am waiting when CCP decides that **having mining skills to lvl 5 grants you 3% boost to weapon damage** ....           
---
Everyone thats been in TEST for a while knows that if PGL says that he'll put out info about something later that night, he actually means next month.
---
It should cause permanent TIDI in Delve...
---
Also, never not stop shooting blues. 
---
WTB: a decent overview that doesn't get me in trouble for reporting blues in intel channel.
---
Here, here, not there, or there and also here.
---
The thing is, you guys are on a offensive campaign, attacking the north. Of course they call in their Coalition to defend their space. 
---
Such a good song.
---
Why care about this - just take some combat probes - setup in some busty mission system and probe MTU then salvage one mission site after another. 
---
pfft, maybe consentrate on the stagings instead of savin stupid fort. these stupid dinos stppoing me farming for plex piss me of
---
This is the answer, seems to me CCP could use that dev time elsewhere when there is already a good solution in place. Never said anyone "i have been hacked - my 2fa did not work" and if it's really a hassle to type in the 2fa code once a month just do it for your banking char
---
I'm sure you're stoked about having to do all tapis heavy lifting for them
---
Whats your point?
---
Currently t4 and t5 do not give a suspect timer
---
Well that's retarded, but it doesn't change much. If it was about setting up an alt to PvE in safety, incursions wasn't much different.
---
Sure, which is why they allowed VPNs.
---
Next time dont buy your Votes and see if someone is going to vote for you. You are not relevant in any way of EVE... but you try to have your name not completly fucked.
---
If you run a camapigne - try to do it like other do. Without your Money ;-)
---
And you have a libido for priesthood, but who's counting?
---
WTF I love goons now?!
---
The event i would like to see in the future is something completely different from what they are now. 
---
Why no capture-the-flag like gameplay where you have to stay in an area for a certain amount of time to conquer it (Note: There should be multiple areas with varied difficulty) While capturing you have to fight off different variations of NPC spawns with fixed arrival timers, so you could coordinate the participating players. There could be solo and group stages which all give points adding to a global event-pool for everyone.
---
Think of this like in the trailer of the "mega gate" where the "heretics" make a blockade to prevent the enemys from destroying the gate.
---
You could even include hacking and mining for, lets say, activating sentries for point defense or recharging them with event minerals.
---
Every participant whether miner, hacker or pve player should recieve a fixed amount of ISK, Boosters or Items at the end of the camapign balanced through their efforts and worth their time. The more you accomplish the more you get. 
---
With this event setup, CCP could ensure that everyone can participate. Those who do the most still get the most and CCP would also be able to create an imersive and exciting environment which has only been done (kind of) in incursions.
---
No google necessary. Just show info on the system and look at the region. There's a letter at the beginning of the region name that corresponds with class.
---
A is C1, B is C2, etc.
---
Sick formup today man. Good job. :)
---
You should probably actually know what you're talking about before opening your mouth, just a word of advice.
---
His struggle is real.
---
not 100% sure, but I think there was a shortage of strat op FCs available right then.
---
Everyone puts his most valuable stuff into the safety hangar, so most of the value would not be affected. Doing this would be a micromanagement nightmare and not fun at all, but people would do it anyways because of human nature, then burn out and leave the game. Very bad idea in my opinion.
---
Permafrost genuinely made the game worse since it introduced 2 big bugs that they still haven't fixed (while ignoring the 3rd one).

If your email and accounts are 2FA'd, there's nothing more you need to do. Assuming, of course, your passwords aren't total trash or something, but still. 2FA'd up, you're done.
---
Well star citizen used it why you cant ?
---
At one point of the game, lasers in general were OP. But then they reduced their damage and introduced tracking...
---
Because high energy autistic players have to get a job eventually 
---
You blue balled your birthday for station spinning? 
---
Right????
---
Local NEVER died for me in 4+ years until they introduced the new system. It was never a problem. 
---
The navy harbinger is a great ship ( Used to fly a kitey beam fit with it.) But its not the ship the op is asking about. I guess this answers his question tho. 
---
You can still fly the Harbinger in the current meta , with a Medium ancil armor rep and nanos. Having 1 link and good damage projection with douple the dps of the omen navy while still not being extremly slow(1500ms with speed links).
---
Just do ninja salvaging ....
---
The old buddy system you were allowed to use the referral codes for alts. It was totally fine. When they changed to the current system, which is way worse, they added some text to the terms and conditions saying it must be a "new player". So no you shouldnt do it because you could be banned. Logic would suggest ccp would go after the rmt and bots before you but that's not happening anytime soon so yea. 
---
Now this is an eye opener. Thank you for your insight.
---
I fly harbingers sometimes. Not as good as navy one, but not bad either 
---
I'll reply if someone tells me how to type in white on the white background?
---
That was X47 
---
Hah...
---
Hahahhaha...
---
Ohhh boi.
---
Nice lecture but as a whale I buy those skins. When I was a highsec pubby maybe a year into EVE without access to 100+ million ticks I too wouldn't want to throw down 20 bucks for the luxury of making my Armageddon look a bit more blingy.
---
Oh, I know he was asking about the regular Harby. His post just reminded me of that doctrine.
---
Anyway, can you not do sort of the same thing with a normal Harbinger? It'll have the same range and damage, and the lower cap use on the guns might reduce the need for the cap booster the NHarby has to use to run a kiting fit. The main advantages of the NHarby is tracking and higher base HP, but you also pay for it with two to three times the pricetag.
---
Could you load my gun and shoot it to please.
---
Fucking eve now days. 
---
Sums this shit up
---
never heard of you
---
&gt; I have the feeling that I get more out of the t3 sites due to the lower filament cost.
---
T3 filaments are cheaper because more people prefer to run T4+ than T3. 
---
I don't see any reason for CCP to step in here. If you think T3 is best income or somehow else better for you, then you should run these. You don't do anybody a favour if you do higher ones.
---
Gated complexes need to go.
---
i doubt very many can spam 10bil structures every 2 lossed would be like loosing a super.
---
OP is trolling you, he's in LZHX, not TEST
---
Remove timers and make citadels able to be killed in low power (keep damage cap though).
---
Remove asset safety.
---
Add a spool up time for caps to take cynos.
---
Make it not possible to for both a cyno and a panic module on the same ship.
---
Ta-da. Game is now ruthless again, citadel spam (and partly fw as a side effect) is fixed.
---
Capital blobs now aren't as reliable as an instant response fleet so subcap fleets might see more action = more content in general
---
Because alts don't exist.
---
Yes, but they have such low health you're better off killing them as quick as possible than trying to assign one drone to each one in order to jam them all.
---
you "quit" after getting kicked out of the best corp in EVE tho....
---
Remove reinforcement timers on low power citadels, make them able to be destroyed without a timer.
---
Keep damage caps so defending fleets have a chance if they want to try to defend. It means the attackers can't just ignore the defenders.
---
Remove asset safety on citadels getting destroyed.
---
Why use percentage for range and factors for everything else? 
---
And never has; minmatar has forever fought in fall off if you wan't to get optimal at close range you take gallente, amarr for long range or close optimal and caldari if you don't give a crap and your opponent is slow enough to not outrun your missile ev or speed.
---
Personally I quite enjoyed the end result, while some of the tasks themselves weren't the most engaging, I love that I now have well over a hundred skins for my different characters and a stack of drugs for pvp, the new mods that dropped as a result of completing the tasks were unique enough to be worth it as well.
---
Any news from CCP on d scan being fixed? Chat system working will be great but d scan is borked too
---
Can you add to this **desyncs due to size of the grids** - can we please make grids more static or by default much smaller? You can easily desync grid with 15people.                  
---
Maybe creating maximum size of a grid could solve some of the issues - what can be wrong in putting a 5-10.000 km maximum grid size?                       
---
Try some small gang dude! It can be rewarding to take a more active role in creating and driving content for yourself and a small group of bros. You don't even have to switch corps. Just find some like minded people on a given night. There's a lot more to pvp in this game than orbit f1
---
Theres other games?
---
Oh no. Maybe you guys can kill another Astrahus now.
---
Lol, are you brain dead? I would love the content that it would provide if the alliance/coalition deployed against Horde.
---
I'd say buying votes is very EVE.
---
The time and effort to implement such a big project doesn't warrant a month for testing. It'll probably take more than a month to get everything ready to revert back again.
---
you have to do extra things to make the skin apply to the ship you hopped in, if your jumping into a newly fitted ship that you are suiciding, you probably wont both taking the time to select the skin.
---
80 bil divided by alot of people = not many bil.

I dont think asset safety should be gone completely, but asset safety hangar would be a good thing. also add a rule to like industry has, after the first attack it's locked down, if your expensive shit wasnt there by the time of the attack, you are out of luck.

Either that or the Cyclone. Combat BCs in general really.

That the alliance between test and goons predates horses existence.

Cool stuff.

You are completely right, not sure how this slipped by me.

pdf source has been updated, no way for me to change the image in the post now though.

He'll start complaining that they're too easy to destroy if the damage cap is removed and his alliance gets shit on and all their cits disappears within a day, because there's no damage cap.
---
So we wont see you at the next big timer? :pepehands:
---
Interesting, I'll look at what area looks like next time as there's been interest for the other weapon systems. Thanks for the tip!

Both. I have spare income, I dont have that much spare time. But some skins are not available any more from the store.

So you're saying test has always been vassals to goons? If you say so

Yup.

This solution only helps if the hacker got your mailbox first and resets the password to get access to your Eve account.

But it does not help, if he somehow got your Eve password. Then he can still extract.
---
Dormant's request is really a lot better. Most secure in my opinion: Let us disable extraction. To enable it again, you also have to reset your password, and wait some time after that. Then the hacker would need access to both mailbox and ingame account, and the legitimate owner would have time to react. 
---
Considering that a Hulk only mines a third of a rorq under perfect conditions, you are overbloating your numbers by a way too large margin.   
---
With that said, I mine a billion an hour per Rorq on +100% R64 moons
---
Define, what's worth it for you ;)  
---
ISK?   
---
Wasting some time?  
---
There are a few lvl4 missions giving 10mil or more loot/salvage. 
---
If I remember it correctly, there was some "Extravaganza" mission where some structure may drop some  worthy things.  
---
Ore some drone AI with quite high value...
---
Compared to the time needed, it's low income.  
---
But there are many people, who like this.  
---
There are also many people, who like mining.  
---
It's more about doing things, no matter about the best income/hour, I believe ;-)
---
An they are also working on the 64bit client. 
---
Unless fleets come from Delve, probably not. I'm not sure what point you are making here.
---
It wasn't like they didn't have time for what I say. Some of them clearly don't have time and are completely absent from the public discord but some were active and that's good of them. But it was more like they didn't like what I said. But then there were many people saying similar things, lots of whom eventually got banned. Voicing anti mega empire ideas against the zombie crowds is not that easy.
---
My particular ban instance was a misunderstanding. We worked it out with jintaan but I did not try to go back in. Because I deemed it was useless trying to talk to them.
---
Yo did brisc approve this post? 
---
It is not?????
---
demios ? 
---
Also blap the MTU's, for some extra fun. Just do it in a cheap catalyst because sometimes it's a bait.
---
No problem it’s high sec so I assumed as much. Just because they are bad doesn’t mean you should make them worse.
---
Yes. Lot of people are crying about the chat being bugged but forget it's one step toward the 64bit client, which will prevent a lot of the crashes happening during large fights these days (client crashes tho, not the servers one), which considering the amount of titans and supers being killed off grid after a DC is not a small thing.
---
I literally have interviewed you and still talk to you in DMs whenever you poke me, and have done so even after your banning. I don’t feel like overturning a ban when you already use reddit as a prominent platform for your ideas, and have a clear line of communication with us, because I felt you were being disruptive at the time. 
---
I will remove the ban when I leave office because I don’t feel legacy bans on the CSM discord make sense - please remind me to do this in April.
---
As far as I know I got banned accidentally by jintaan. We worked it out but I never bothered to get back in.
---
The history between goons and test isn't a secret.
---
Test grew up along side goons, they worked together for quite some time. Then test had a slightly unstable leader that decided to make their own coalition, with blackjack and hookers, or whatever. That worked out reasonably well, depending on your bias. After that short tiff goons went back to being friends with the exception of a slight misunderstanding over a citadel anchoring in querious or something.
---
That short paragraph of history covers a longer tjmespan than pandemic horde has been a thing.
---
Love it when newbeans lose their shit over seeing a bridge titan.
---
&gt; Actually the Eve Client is fine.
---
Oh boy are you in for a surprise.
---
If d-scan had an auto refresh I’d move to j-space in a heartbeat. I just don’t want to be spamming my D key for 5 hours at a time :( 
---
Is there an ascii version I can put in my bio?  Because, y'know, that's the best place for this type of info.
---
You're not interesting. Please never comment again.
---
5-7 days depending on your travel 
---
From my perspective you were still in the camp of those who are too immersed in empire building to be open to different voices. 
---
I was not being disruptive but whenever I talk mega empire people were beginning to harass and I was looking like the source of that toxicity. They do the same thing on Reddit too. It took quiet some time and energy and a huge mute list for me to learn to deal with it.
---
As for the ban, I thought you overturned it after last time we spoke. I don't really care to get back in there. For anyone with an alternative, nonmainstream voice that discord is useless.
---
All this being said, you at least are in the group who interacts with people. That's more than people like Aryth or Sort can say. I appreciate this. 
---
I am saying all this for the ultimate point that CSM 13 shouldn't give themselves too much credit about being receptive.
---
Well shit.  I think I downloaded the wrong game then...
---
Not worth it

I see your Wee woo wee woo and I raise you Nee Naw Nee Naw

80bn is nothing for nullsec alliances, hell, I make that in a couple months.  Don't understand why they get so hung up over shit ike that. The game is devolved more into spin and optics than anything else... Hell, they won't talk about loss, how about TEST being krabbing red for four days, what would that have "cost" its members alliance wide? 500bn+ ? And fresh off the back of the Absolute injector event too.
---
And of course very little of import happened during the forced 4 days of Red, moved cap fleets about and more boring ass highsec nonsense.
---
This.  And it means there was actually some content instead of posturing for a bit, then blue balling it.  Who honestly gives a fuck about such a relatively small amount.
---
&gt; 6 wrapped packages
---
Oh my, I was away for like 6 months, came back to over 100 packages, you see I have a bad habit of stashing loot in the nearest citadel after every kill, doesn't matter if it's 3 drones and a used corpse, or few hundred mil worth faction modules, then retrieving them only when I'm short on cash. By the way you can see the contents of those containers in EveMon https://i.imgur.com/3A5XsRq.png I just don't use it for that because I like just going there, then opening the wrap like a Christmas present.
---
yeah, but can it jettison???
---
Can I have your stuff, please?
---
Sorry for your bad experience, sadly you didn’t have a experienced mentor to guide you nor have you play d in a group that provides engaging content or so it sounds to me.
---
You forgot remove nulification from the game. Make travelling dangerous again.
---
What corp did you join? 
---
Why did you get 2 Omega accounts? 
---
Well, you gotta start somewhere
---
And for newbies i recommend trying the abyss, even t1 has better isk than missions.
---
Regarding pvp, if you want entry level fun , i recommend Red vs Blue. Always cheap fun fights to be had in hisec.
---
While pvp is essentially just pressing some buttons, there is nuance you only appreciate after a while. Such as fitting your ship, overheating modules, manual piloting etc.
---
I agree the game feels harsh at the beginning but remember this is only because a lot of other players have been playing a very long time, so the standards are quite high.
---
they don't go to a guristas sotiyo
---
&gt;or an npc guristas badger is not a 100% sign that there is a sotiyo in system.  
---
No it is not. Also it can just dock in NPC stations.
---
And?
---
I cried.
---
the Quadstick is a game controller for quadriplegics (people who have lost the use of their arms and legs) that is operated with mouth control.
---
in very simple terms its a gamepad you use with your mouth.
---
### 
---
Do a bit more research. There's T1 meta fits that are excellent entry points that you can fly within less of a day to get started. There's even some really good pvpers that use low sp ship fits.
---
should i keep some POS modules ... just in case?
---
you smell, that is all.
---
Why is every BL poster always a toxic neckbeard? Like, this is a serious question
---
Fighting in optimal with a Minma-AC-boat is awesome though... Only hard to get THAT close most of the time :D
---
It's a community safespace where everything is supposed to be honest, classy and comfortable.
---
.
---
..
---
...
---
So it's essentially the paradise for scammers, 4chan posters and such to go shit the place up.
---
*Like nature ordained*
---
There is no npc station in the system(the one that players can dock as well). 
---
God I just love seeing TEST fail. Thank you for making my day a little better. :)
---
Heya there.
---
I wouldn't recommend getting another...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ac4h1c/hey_guys_question_from_a_new_player/ed5412i?utm_source=reddit-android
---
As i said you were better off investing into you main then another alt. If you did that you would be able to fly a well fitted ship and do good solo pvp.
---
But either way, the Corp that you are in maybe isn't right for you because corps that accept newbros tend to help them out by not forcing them straight into doctorine ships but rather show them the ropes of the game and take t1 frigates into fleets so you get the feel for pvp while you're trainibg for bigger stuff.
---
I might sound/be absolutely stupid (yes I am, no confirmation needed), but can someone please explain the difference between old and new chat to me? I was having a break before May 2018 and don't remember a lot from chat before that.
---
is it possible to hire someone to rush me through high level missions increasing my caldari stantings fast?
---
Yeah why waste time say lot word when few word do trick
---
If he did invest heavily in the game, I see no reason for you or anyone here to give him shit, or post his Nick in game... His money, his will, his problem! 
---
HTFU!
---
if its so easy, then why can't u kill my firetail in ur firetail?
---
downvoted because of D key.
---
Ree
---
You are missing important part here - those mining crews spawns often and only 2 from whole population (NS) go to Sotiyo.          
---
Rest is despawned after they warp off or they dock at NPC station (or citadel based on standings).             
---
How many NPC mining crews can be in New Eden - take count of all guristas systems and multiply it by 20-25%.       
---
(or any other race)            
---
wow very epic
---
Hey if you send it to me i will tripple it!
---
name and shame the retard who told you to omega 2 accounts and multibox
---
So there is no telling of which badger might warp to a sotiyo.
---
Compared to the Rat King mess of code TQ is made of?
---
And it is. All it does is run graphics sound and ui. The data each of those uses is server based,thats where the isue starts. Hence the peoblems when chat was moved from TQ servers to AWS servers.
---
Infact the only client issue of note recentally is when the client hit the 32bit 4Gb memory limit. 
---
Everything else, chat, lag, missing ships, dscan, all are serverside.
---
Train all of them for PI.  Get Command Center Upgrades and Interplanetary Consolidation to V.  The rest can be IV no problem.  If you're relatively stable in your hole (you're going to be there months or years), set up in the WH as the yield will be way higher (hugely) than HS.
---
Also unless you're a sadist, set them up on a weekly cycle.  Collecting the things and resetting the heads gets old fast.
---
What other should do I need to train? Being new to pi I am really not sure and meeting semi new to game as well. 
---
&gt; Its just right click, target, approach, f1-f4, rinse repeat.
---
It's not. It's a lot more complicated than that. PvP wise, of course, PvE is boring as fuck. But in most cases, if you just approach your target in PvP you're just gonna die really fast if you are squishy, and you're gonna get caught if you are brawl fit. Now of course, when you're in a large alliance, only doing ping fleet, all you have to do is get into a DPS ship, anchor on the FC, lock target and shoot. 
---
But eve is not just that. Leave that alliance, join a smaller LS or WH corp, get into some T1 ships and learn about ranges, weapons times, tracking and how not to die in 20s. Because I assure you, you will die very quickly when starting to PvP outside of large alliance fleet.
---
There used to be a lot of people who do this. I'd check on the eve forums, in the subsection that has services.
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/services
---
If that doesn't work, ask in one of the mission hubs for caldari if anyone will offer that for you.
---
I don't have 300 mil. and overdefensive fan base that trust everything I say :(
---
How people prefer the V key over easily accessible D key when in wormholes is beyond me .
---
Thanks for the answer. Not planning to make money off of it, just had concernt regarding it being public
---
You should post a 3000 word rant avout how unfair that was. Crosspost it here as well. 
---
Remote Sensing and Planetology.  There's also Advanced version of the latter which you can train to IV too (doesn't need a V prerequisite).  It'll take around a month, depending on your remap/stats.  
---
Getting in close was usually easy Minnie ships are fast... getting back out in one piece -not so much Minnie ships arent exactly tanky.
---
Given that the last commit on their [public ejabberd repo](https://github.com/ccpgames/ejabberd/commits/master) in their GitHub org is from April 2018...
---
You should probably walk away from the computer you very very pathetic individual. If you want to project about how miserable your life is I suggest keeping your sperg to a councillor and not a gaming community. Enjoy fucking yourself o7
---
No one necessarily told me to start multiboxing. Im just super ADD and got bored playing one account. I thought if I played two accounts I would be drawn into the game more, bad idea but its cool, it was only 30 bucks and at least I confirmed even having 2 accounts wont make the game fun for me. 
---
Why would you extract, that just makes CCP happy their awesome injector mechanics are getting used and they make money, just cancelling subscription is the way to go.
---
&gt; I agree the game feels harsh at the beginning but remember this is only because a lot of other players have been playing a very long time, so the standards are quite high.
---
That's the exact reason what pushed players away. During my month stay in EVE, I asked my many online friends to play with me, I even offered to get them an Omega account for a month or two if they dug the game. Everyone had the same answer, that EVE has been around for too long to be able to compete. Whether this is wrong or right, this is the perception of so many gamers out there. 
---
I don't have anything, I was selling everything I found and managed to save 10 million ISK which is pennies to anyone playing this game longer than a month lol. 
---
stop bashing Star Citizen pls xD
---
I joined 2 corps which to save face, I wont mention their names out of respect. But I can say that the first one was very shitty ran, they actually asked me what I wanted to do for them in the corp when I told them I was new. How is a new player supposed to know what's available and what would be fun if they never heard of nor played said position? 
---
Second corp seemed to just want me to do the stupid boring scanning shit to help them in pvp. They gave me this position after I told them I came from many years of Black Desert Online. I couldn't even complete 2 relic scans before I got bored and started playing something else.

Not really, a good example here would be the de-sync of grids when you take the gunning seat of a structure, that was mostly a client issue.
---
Why do players act like anomalies are a recent phenomenon? They've been in the game for a decade now.
---
Hey thanks dude, I'm not posting this for pity. I genuinely think EVE has a great community. I just wished I enjoyed the game as much as everyone on here. But I've just had a boring mess of the last month playing. 
---
And perhaps you're right, I thought I found a mentor when I joined my 2nd corp but the guy just passed me off to someone else in a different corp that they were alliance with and left me in the spot I was in when we met lol. 
---
i don't buy skins because they are way to expensive. If they are at 10 plex for every skin then i buy them.
---
I have been playing for a year on one account and i can say that playing catchup is totally possible. You just need to know what you want to train.
---
\- don't do PI in hs. mechanics: hs has much, much worse resources while wh usually has some of the best
---
\- train everyone to interplanetary 5 and command center to 4. train main to commands 5. mechanics: for extraction, having commands to 4 suffices, so you will extract with 5 toons and produce with the 6th, for truly optimal results. 
---
\-factory planets should have a 2-3k radius tops, if you wanna stick more in there. (due to links taking cpu and pg according to lenght)
---
\- planetology and adv planetology to 4 will hugely improve your life! no more placing extractors on a barren spot and wondering why you have to move them hourly in search for the treasure.  
---
\- PI in wh from an entire 3 toon account with interplanetary to 5 planets should render enough for plexing the said account. the more accounts, the better as up to 3 planets should be dedicated to factories, the rest for extractions. 
---
\- unless you develop even more toons, don't build a very large scheme. easy algorithm: extract and proces t0-t1 on the same planet.  2 diff planets will extract enough for a dedicated factory planet where you build t2. if you have a large production of 2 t2s and no poco taxes, go for t3. don't go further, as it gets really complicated for just 6 toons. 
---
\- build pi according to your system resources, not jita prices on the internet. but don't just extract water in a whole. use the uncommon planets: plasma, storm, etc. 
---
\- one more, if your resources don't find a place to go and are routed to a full inventory or to nothing, they will poof. have a dedicated silo for outputs! also, having 3-4 spaceports at your factory planets makes dropping resources a walk in the park, every 3-5 days, instead of a daily chore. 
---
Assets in hangars in k-space have never been at risk. Why do some people pretend like they ever were? 
---
You're talking about Bjorn's shitty stream, not the fucking Dalai Lama.

See you in a couple weeks you will come back they always do
---
Note that the fair use defense is a uniquely American thing.  Certain other countries have similar provisions in their law, but many do not, and the Berne Convention, which provides a baseline for international copyright protection, doesn't require that there be such a provision.
---
I say "Alliance tournament" 😉
---
Harb (navy) is one of the most used ships there. Granted, the AT is not a very realistic PvP scenario.. 
---
3-4 spaceports on a factory planet?  No idea what you're smoking.
---
Hey, if you want to give it one more shot and want someone to come play with ya and help you learn send me a dm.
---
If not good luck on your next adventure.
---
Yeah you were 100% right my dude. I took your advise and left my first corp only to join another one that gave me a boring role to fill. After that, I then got another Omega account as one last hail mary to get me completely engulfed in EVE. I didn't work, It just made me realize the time it will take and the amount of waiting around required. I was left with nothing to do really. 
---
- Mining Ore in hi sec
---
- Agent Missions 
---
- Trade good hauling
---
- Scan for relics or hack
---
- ???
---
I have a feeling that I would be left with a blown up ship if I took my level 1 ass into PVP, hisec, lowsec, anysec, Im a dead sec. 
---
I had the same feeling as you when I first played three years ago, almost left cause i was getting mad seeing it would take me like 8 months to get to a Tengu (PVE/PVP king back in 2016). But i went past my first impression and started actually enjoying flying all over New Eden in my T1 shitfit bellicose &lt;3   
---
What you need is a nice corp that will give you advice, fly with you and make you enjoy playing the game even in a newbro ship (which are surprisingly efficient once you know how to fly them).   
---
Eve online is a wonderful game but the first days are really hard, keep going bud, it's worth the time ;) 
---
You're wrong then.
---
I'll bring it up. 
---
That's because you have a brain the size of a pea.
---
Oh my!  Two ships at once!  Swapping between them!  HILARIOUS!
---
fat load of good it does them
---
must be why they've all but given up even trying to run for CSM and let us have all the seats
---
Yeah that sounds pretty bad.
---
In the past month I've read almost the entirety of eveuniversity.com.
---
&gt; Because I assure you, you will die very quickly when starting to PvP outside of large alliance fleet.
---
I know I would die and I know I have a lot to learn however the end doesn't fit the means. I would spend my last 10 mil in 2 deaths and have no way of making more money but to farm more combat agent missions, no thanks. 
---
It's the same as in game, pretty clear
---
&gt;  I would spend my last 10 mil in 2 deaths and have no way of making more money but to farm more combat agent missions, no thanks.
---
You have way more valuable way of making isk as a new player in any region of the game than running missions.
---
I understand you, Eve is very large and you cannot know or understand everything. But it's not limited to the scope of what you see.
---
Get yo aussie ass on discord now, ill be 5mins
---
My opinion on how to enhance :
---
 \- putting AC and arty on the same graph makes no sense. make two graphs.
---
 \- use optimal+falloff/2 to have the 90% apply distance.
---
 \- add range scale
---
 \- use log scale for tracking
---
 \- potential help is to use tracking / 90pcdistance instead of simple tracking. 
---
How many people could this post be relevant to?
---
These are random dudes talking to each other about some null sec cancer ping, with no context provided, most people don't know them, there isn't even a tl;Dr.
---
It's more like an inside story, relevant to only those few people who know who they are and what they are talking about.
---
Perhaps I will, at the very least I will always be checking on this sub reddit and catching up on the EVE drama, the politics of this game are amazing and I wish I could be a part of it. 
---
Asset safety should be limited to highsec (100%) and low-sec (50%), there shouldn't be any asset safety in null/WH because they are territories where there is no security (except "player security" lol). Asset safety, along with the citadel mechanics in general, are the reason why EVE is sinking in the crabbing madness. Who with a sane mind would want to go through 3 times of the cancerous citadel mechanic and break his teeth on that shit all of that for not even having the citadel loot what's in it ?
---
Maybe because injectors are not an issue like so much people believe it ?
---
i'd say they're plenty receptive
---
why, any time i have an issue i want to bring up to the csm, i just ping one of our five representatives on jabber and be all "yo here's how it should be" and they are all "はい、なでなで"
---
I believe it is so they can target and deal with enemy fighters.
---
&gt; HEY YOU KNOW THAT PRELIMINARY CONFLICT CREATOR. FUCK THAT WE ARE GOING TO DILLUDE CONFLICT TO A SHIP THAT CAN SAFELY MINE, BE INVINCIBLE FOR 7 MINUTES TANK OVER 100 SUB CAPS ALSO EVEN IF IT IS KILLED CAN SAFELY STORE 90% OF ITS VALUE. That will really keep players and conflict creators interested in this game. PLAYERS WILL REALLY RALLY BEHIND THAT.
---
This. On a scale from 1 to bullshit, this is the worst CCP could have done. I mean, okay, let Rorquals tank like mongoloids, but just strip this stupid shit that is the Nexus Invul. 
---
Thanks dude, I'll be keeping my ear to the ground for any smaller pvp corps that might take in a new guy. Still got a lot of time left on my Omegas so we'll see if I get lucky. 
---
Ta, much appreciated.
---
Also, if you're feeling benevolent, advocate we normalise and/or get rid of attributes. They're terrible. 
---
Correct.
---
Join brave and ask to join the brave dojo. They actually give a fuck and they teach you how to play as well as getting you free ships. Brave has changed alot but the dojo is still the same. 
---
See that sounds fun how do I get into that kinda shit?
---
Just get in to a decent alliance and start FCing :)
---
Did it for a long while through 08-12, still boring, people try to convince themselves theirs a lot more but it's all the same just a question of scale. 
---
Political shenanigans are far more fun. 
---
Avery plz it’s querns, he can’t understand words that aren’t goon spin
---
Yeah wtf is the word!
---
A lot of corps are terrible with newbros. I think the best new player experience is to join one of the bigger alliances that actually have structures and doctrines in place for people with low SP.
---
You don't need 30 days training to be useful in a fleet.
---
Also...there's more to combat than you think - you effectively said the equivalent of 'There's nothing more to FPS games than clicking on people's heads'
---
Imagine putting off others in order to fight in tapi lmao pathetic
---
maybe that's all you get from the game, and that's fine, but good pvp in eve is enjoyable, even if it's not for you. 
---
It sounds like you were in hi-sec? That’s probably why you didn’t like it. Hi-sec sucks, no idea why crazy people live there.
---
As for taking months to be effective, idk about that. I handle a lot of my corps new members and we get them up and into pvp in under a day of skill training (yay EWAR!) and they’re always welcome on fleets. 
---
As for money, it’s not great but salvaging behind a super or smart bomb team nets you over 100 mil and hour...
---
Honestly, I’d give it another go and Join Pandemic Horde. I’ve sent all my IRL friends over there, and so far not a single one has quit. I even got my brother to try it again (he played for 2 months in 2015 and then quit citing the same things you are)... 3 months in horde and he was in love. 
---
good comment
---
Damn I miss the days of leading PVP raids in Rift
---
You can go pvp day 1 in fleet with just a tackle frig or a grifin. It can be very fun too and it cost no skilling and under 1m per ship.
---
Just go pvp because pve in eve is hell.
---
I looked into joining Horde but felt I would be lost in the shuffle of all the players in it and the forms you have to fill out, its like a whole job application essentially. Turned me off, I know its probably worth it but I dunno, who wants to fill forms out to PVP ya know?
---
If there is sotiyo in system it will warp to it (unless this mining crew is not connected to the sotiyo spawn :P)          
---
do you just pretend being retarded to collect downvultures or you actually are?
---
are you stalking npc miners sir?
---
whatever i'm smoking is rolled in isk paper amigo, which i'm making from pi. i am dropping almost 40k t1 in my factories with each visit. (3 spacesports have \~26000 x 3 capacity). 
---
You’re confusing it with Pandemic Legion maybe? Horde doesn’t require any forms to join. You literally just hop in the public channel and apply
---
To be fair... Alpha see's the ship enter, bots safe up, and then what? What if the alpha doesn't see them leave? Did they safe log? are they still there cloaked? Did they exit via a wormhole? What about ones that come in via a wormhole?
---
Keeping track of people in / out to the point you could decide when things are / aren't safe isn't really possible.
---
Warp-in issue has a fix in awaiting deployment.  Can you be more specific about how D-scan is horribly broken?
---
I felt the same when I was in HS for a month. Mining away in my procurer all day. What was the point? No socialising, no belonging, no action.
---
Then I joined a nullsec corp in a huge coalition. Got myself a VNI, now training into doctrines. The game got a lot better even if I only had one new ship. Whenever I get bored of ratting, I mine, vice versa. Since I live close to the border, theres a lot of action to be seen. 
---
I have been playing for 3 months now, and I since I got into nullsec, and was shown what the game can be, My doubts about the game went away. This is truly a masterpiece and I wish I had got on much earlier.
---
What was my solution? I joined an interesting corp in an interesting area with people who were willing to show me the width of the game.
---
Depends, if there is a sotiyo in system it will always warp to and from it. If there is not, it will warp in random directions and disappear while in warp
---
Ah shit yeah, Pandemic is the one I tired to get into. I'll look into Horde, I've heard only good things about them but never talked to anyone in the corp. 
---
Abaddon.
---
Sometimes taking another hobby as an example is helpful.
---
we will use golf as one.
---
Whilst it seems simple (hit ball with stick) It is a hobby that takes time to master.
---
and possibly the best part of golf is the clubhouse and the players you meet and play with. EVE is the same, the best part is the community, The corp and alliance you fly for, and the activities the corp/club make possible for their members entertainment.
---
Join a good corp right away, some recommend Karmafleet as one that is able to provide a meaningful, fun, and engaging newbie culture, But I have no personal experience of them, so seek out your own choice.
---
but it is NOT a game that one can just drop into and in a few hours get instant gratification, It is a slow burn game, and as you note many play for many years. Whether this suits your needs and requirements is up to you. but find a good group and everything you find may change your experience
---
&gt;This sounds like speculation to me. 
---
Nope. Its based off updates from the devs trying to marry 16 years of partily documented Legacy code to modern programming standards and practises.
---
Also the Client is as I mentioned. One of the older bugs from Eve was logging in seeing no space chat or items but others in systwm could still see your ship responding to your commands correctly. Its a very common server De-synch issue where the Database Delivery Controller fails to correctly update.
---
I did however forget the Citadel de-synch issue. So 2 client issues vs the multitude of server side issues this year.
---
Are you for real acting like the goddamn local chat server working 100% of the time represents “the health of the game”??
---
Do you even have a subbed Eve account or are you just one of those crybabies who quit years ago and uses every opportunity to whine about it?
---
also depends where you live, EU vs NA have different laws regarding use of copyright content vs fair use.
---
specially as Article 13 seems to just say anything copyright is no, regardless of fair use.
---
Unlikely
---
So I only have to observe if he's warping to the same direction a few times.
---
my fc fav ship:draeke
---
It's very Eve. It's not very "I love Eve and want it's betterment".
---
Awesome, join the in-game channel “JOIN HORDE” to see how.
---
EVE definitely isn’t for everyone, and it might not be for you. But I would strongly suggest trying out the actual game, not the bastardized bullshit version you described above.
---
While large fleet PvP is “orbit- F1” that’s only if you want to fly mainline DPS. Every fleet uses a bunch of different “snowflakes” doing their own things apart from the fleet. 
---
Additionally, small gang PvP is mainly a “pilot your own ship” type of thing. Definitely give it a shot, maybe look up videos of some streamers?
---
I did actually mind that too much as you can't transport much in nullified ships (comparatively) and they can still be killed by smartbombs. I know that's quite a niche counter but the aren't 100% safe at least
---
Did you expect anything else from NewGoon's pet? TEST won't do anything without daddy NewGoon there to back them up.
---
And this is the exact reasone why I don't go on Keepstar bashes no more, 12 hours of shoting something in tidi not worth it.
---
I would be fine with the current nullification subs for T3C, as they have a significant drawback in doubled align time and the sub alone has the cost of an Interceptor 
---
Nullified Ceptors shoud die anyway ...
---
a keepstar you say
---
Thanks for confirming your status.
---
!Remindme 4 months, 4 days
---
Well, depends on teh ship... I just liked and still like the \`cane and this ship is lots, but not exactly able to close in on all the kitey, meep-meep-speedy nano-gangsters you find everywhere. :/
---
The fact that a core mechanic of of the game has been only intermittently functional on a daily basis for nearly a year isn't a big enough problem to comment on the overall state of the game and CCP's concern for it? Do you honestly think this sort of thing could have existed in any other successful MMO for this long without players raging 100x more than we have or, more likely, the problem being fixed within days or weeks? Lol.
---
This isn't the only recent bug to pop up, have a significant effect on a large number of players, and go unfixed and nearly unmentioned for far too long.
---
That's not a signal of a healthy game.
---
And not that it's horribly relevant, but yes, I have 5 subbed accounts right now. It was 8 recently, but as I've said around here, my accounts are lapsing into alpha as they run out.
---
PSA: If you use the mobile app for 2FA, you will never be able to log into Sisi again.
---
To this day, mirror after mirror, it tells me my codes are wrong. Pretty sure it's expecting codes from 3 phones ago. Works on TQ just fine. But it's a common occurrence that the app breaks down for Sisi. And CCP doesn't care to do anything about it. 
---
So the reset was just to make it easy to roam and not an actual reset? Ok good, we agree.
---
As a longtime lowsec dweller thanks for the hint to the difference in content creation between Null- and Low-Sec R64. Never thought about that. For me these moons were at least 2/3 of the good content in the timespan between Phoebe and Lifeblood patches.
---
&gt;Please, all of you cancelling plans with significant others for eve timers.
---
What if the SO was going to make you watch gossip girl tho?
---
Ok show me rorq lossmails.
---
Railgus are great and long range Power houses. You just have to accept that caldari only has fleet ships 
---
Lol space boomers on suicide watch. Get a grip, there's plenty fun still in eve in my opinion. 
---
 If not happy, move on. Everybody making their death cries a blog post or a short novel. Makes me think a lots of folks have never played anything outside of eve. 
---
Wow amazing I was wrong. You truly aren't really blue after all. You really did reset each other. This must be why I see goons regularly cloaky camping eso - to kill those sweet drones that you all don't seem to care about when you lose them. 
---
😂 thank you for the laugh 
---
because CCP has no clue how economic works and have no clue how proper skins should look like
---
That sounds very much like a you problem, rather than a public one.
---
I use 2FA on all my accounts, and SiSi works just fine.
---
a little bit of column a, a little bit of column b. The CODE flair helps.
---
interestingly while I get the 2FA prompt for TQ, it acts like I don't have 2FA setup for SiSi (and I've had 2FA for ages now)
---
S-Size Structures (Astra/Rait/Athanor) are the equivalent to POS Towers. These assets never were safe.
---
Your trolls are too obvious, I know you are not that stupid ...
---
Look at all this horde tryhard posting. Nevermind that they did this during darkness/gotg fights multiple times.
---
Anomalies do not respawn immediately and indefinitely since 10 years.
---
the amount of petitions ccp would get from returning players would be enormous and hurt retention. Not that is a good excuse but probably a factor.
---
Read the prompt again. It emails you the code rather than using an app.
---
Good post but I need to respond to one part of the statement.
---
&gt; otherwise, why would the players use them over what they currently had?
---
At it's release citadels offered unprecedented quality of life changes that even if they behaved like POS for vulnerability and destructibility, they would still have seen substantial use:
---
* Were useable as perfectly safe jump points for supers and titans.
---
* Were dockable unlike POS so you could get out of your ship. 
---
* Could be dropped anywhere meaning areas with no stations finally could have structures that behaved like them.
---
* Did not require fuel to provide invulnerability through tether (e.g., you could siege your Rorq and provide boosts).
---
* Allowed clone storage and instant clone changes.
---
When ECs were released the Sotiyo could build an unlimited number of supers at once, unlike POS which were limited IIRC.
---
This is just a partial list. For a Keepstar, having vulnerability mechanics similar to a POS would be extreme, but I don't believe the vulnerability mechanics at release would have had much impact on how much citadels were used at release.
---
The funny thing is that even when you change your password it doesn’t revoke any 2FA Keys.
---
You have to do that separately it seems.
---
Ok I can get behind that ...
---
It is a sarcastic reply to leshaks not being the meta.
---
we have 2 problems that can solve each other:
---
allow bots to bash structures
---
So people can exit a warzone w all their shit and live to fight another day
---
True but was replying to the person above who suggested finding a wh corp
---
This dumb cyno spool up shit again.
---
Damn straight. 
---
I just relaunched after a 3 year hiatus, my third EVE run. I am extremely doubtful I will last long. But EVE will remain my pick for the #1 game of all time, and based on current social trends, I don't think anyone will even attempt to rival it. 
---
Everything in life is relative. The glorious highs are only glorious because there are abysmal lows. The overwhelming power is only overwhelming because others do not have power. Like a wave-form, when all things are equalized, everything dies in nothingness.  
---
People really want the high spots, the power, the prestige but they abhor what is required to achieve it. They don't want the risk of losing everything, they don't want someone bigger than them to come push them around, they don't want to suffer anything, at all, ever. And instead of putting in the work and accepting the consequences, they plead CCP to change the rules of the game. Bring in CONCORD. Stop clone penalties. Make the NPC's switch targets so I don't loose my blinged faction Battleship while semi-AFK grinding -- oh, and make all the grinding for 100 people doable in 2 systems so we never need to take a real risk while making money. Make everything easy! 
---
Then everything gets easier and we start to wonder where the magic went. Where is the anxiety of moving high value cargo through space? Just fucking jump it to the POS and warp to the hisec gate -- where there are virtually no risks at all. 
---
The lack of danger not only devalues success in equal measures, it also forces people apart. Why work as a team when one pilot can get the job done? 
---
I was in Wildly Inappropriate when they got their shit pushed in. And I was in the best corp I'd ever been in, The 5th, a tight nit group of ride together, die together pilots brought from hisec life. Our jump networks went down and we needed to haul some serious shit out the hard way. We had a 50 ship fleet formed (that is probably low) and everyone had a job. Scouts. Skirmishers. A fleet of jammers. A fleet of webbers for the freighters. Logistics. We had strict coms and serious officers. We gate-jumped our way out of Geminate, a few days later we lost the station we had built with our own ISK. We got our asses kicked and it was the most fun I had in EVE. 
---
There are no mountains without earthquakes. And when you make everything easy, then everything is worthless. 
---
If you leave for 6 months why would your shit be safe. nullsec and wh space should be hardcore mode.
---
It isn't often I see such a great comment from someone that just seems to get it and can actually sum it up in a comment that makes sense. Thank you!
---
We can rage and rant as much as we want but what you're saying is the reality and we as players often forget this and it isn't what we want to hear but it is the truth. 
---
D-Scan "position" doesn't move correctly with the ship in some cases and can get "stuck" somewhere in space. I.e. after d-scanning at the sun and warping to a planet, D-Scan still returns results as if you were at the sun.
---
Gossip Girl is great don't be a boner
---
&gt; this is ... not hello kitty island.
---
Delve, Esoteria, Paragon Soul etc. basically are just that ....
---
Your experience of the chatserver problem vastly differs from other people - “only intermittently functional on a daily basis” is hilariously blowing this out of proportion.
---
Make me?
---
You mean, you're not up to date on the current series?
---
Xoxo
---
Yes, they do. It's been that way since Dominion, when they were introduced.
---
It would make me sub my 4 accounts for the month!
---
Except the fact that no one used POS-mounted storage in k-space. You would have had to have been retarded to do so if you had any other option.
---
&gt; Hey we want to empower individuals so lets create infinite spawning isk sites and drives conflict towards a more spread out system but also ignore the fact that local tells everyone a bad guy here and also have a ship that can also play this game without even touching the keyboards so they can watch netflix with local window opened to the side. BTW bots rely 100% on local to survive. ALso btw we made null sec effectively homogeneous so no need to fight over better space.
---
I'd gladly explain (again), why VNIs and infinite anomalies are not a problem, but I'm kinda getting tired that people (specially in Black Legion) act like salty fucks against that kind of ships just because they can't catch them. 
---
Thanks for the clarification.  Fix is also in for this, awaiting deployment.
---
\*Obligatory newbro disclaimer\*
---
I find myself asking similar questions to folks all the time and I get a lot of different answers. So much so that I have come to the conclusion that "Is X worth it" comes down to what level of play you are at and what other viable isk making methods are available to you/easy for you to do.   
---
So for example, as a low sp newbro the best thing that I can fly right now is a T1 fitted VNI. Right now I am farming rep to get lvl 4 missions. Before I got the VNI was legit struggling to complete the lvl3s. I could do them, but very very slowly. The payout wasn't very good, especially with how long it would take me to complete the missions. I needed to upgrade from my Vexor to a VNI and doing so cost ISK. I resolved myself to only buy and fit things if I can afford to comfortably buy it twice. So, I did what you are doing now and started researching ways to boost my income so that I could upgrade ships. One of the things that came to mind was salving because naturally im farming the missions anyway right? I got PLENTY of comments some telling salving was decent way to make some extra isk, other saying it was a waste of time, and even more saying that missions were a waste of time in general.
---
Ultimately I decided that for the time being, since I was mostly farming the missions in one system anyway that I would drop MTU's do my missions, then come back and salv them really quick and just hold on to the scrap and loot I get. After about 3-4 missions I want to say i had about an extra 40-50m isk from salvaged loot which for me was worth it as something that is effortless and only takes me maybe like an extra 5 min to do if even. My suggestion, setup you're salvaging ship in the system that you are running missions. Drop you're MTU at the start of the mission. Come back and collect the goods after. Do that a few times and see how much isk value you are left with then make the decision for yourself if it was worth it to YOU or not because at the end of the day there is always going to be folks who say running missions in it of itself is not worth it, so the question of rather or not it is worth it to loot for the salvage isnt even up for consideration.  
---
I've already been asking for that one. I want them removed from the game. Give everybody a set skill point per hour, let the amount/speed be modified by implants or drugs. No more attributes. 
---
This is a good idea. 
---
BIOMETRIC POOP SCANNING
---
You clearly do not play that long, but that you admitted already ...
---
Damn, this is gonna be a long post...
---
When I started playing eve (late 2007) I started like you.
---
A friend told me to install the game and play the 14 day trial.
---
The deal was that at the end of the trial if I get hooked into it and find what I want to do, that then I will create another brand new account with a new character and play with that one and if I do that, he'll then sponsor me for first 30 days. (that way I don't end up with useless skills or wasted training time)
---
So...I did just that.
---
I played through EvE tutorial and learned basically nothing except how to do missions.
---
So I asked around in help channel and people there told me to check out lowsec and so I went there and got destroyed by gatecamp on first gate.
---
Then i tried again and same thing happened.
---
After a few tries of just getting into low sec with my newbie ship gatecampers realized what's going on so they let me through but only if I have a long chat with them.
---
I ended up basically playing through my last 10 days of trial together with them. We were gatecamping, roaming through lowsec and null sec, they taught me how to fly, what to fly and why to fly it that way. I learned the difference of missiles and turrets and how to use them properly (somewhat properly at least). 
---
They were called "Morsus Mihi" and they are the real reason how I got hooked and basically the reason why 11 years later I still play this game.
---
Also, I never actually joined their corp/alliance, I just flew with them and we pewpewd together.
---
To be honest those 10 days of experience is still in like my personal top 5 EvE moments.
---
After I made a new char I decided to do missions to get ISK for better ships and fittings (and also to pay for my PLEX) and to spend rest of the ISK on pvp. Long plan was to once I was ISK stable to move into nullsec as my gatecamping mates told me it was a smart way of doing things.
---
My mate liked my plan so he sponsored me the 30days as he promised. After that I kept playing the game, finding corps that I liked flying with, making friends and most importantly I had fun playing and I still find it fun for me.
---
TL;DR: Eve is fucking hard and boring unless you find a good pack of mates to play with.
---
If you are still considering to stay and play then I recommend you do just that, find your pack.
---
Here you are either straight out lying or again just do not know what you are talking about. The current respawn mechanism was added in 2017. 
---
Are you related to Sue Abbott?
---
Is there a good program to help analyze Corp income and expenses?
---
not only he is a force to be fear but also his streams are really fun
---
You just argued for my point
---
With all you alts and SP farms you control more than 50% of the votes.
---
No one cares to run for CSM anymore, because of your control of the votes.
---
While it's an excellent start, Eve University isn't a one stop shop. I'm on mobile at the moment, I'll link you some stuff later if you'd lke. Jestertrek's write ups on fittings and fitting theory is pretty good. Some fits are more catered to previous meta, but it's excellent how he writes about how to actually fly the ship. There's many more good ones, that one was just off the fop of my head.
---
EVE Uni has some fits for Day 1 or "NNITH" (Noob Night In The Hole). Some T1 Meta fits that are a great start and you can T2 as you go.
---
You're corpies should be able to help you with beginner fits. If they're steadfast on making you wait a month before you start shooting things with them, find a better corp, it'll make your game so much better. 
---
Zarvox Toral, the tsitch streamer has public roams and has some fits for newer players (I remember being on a roam and hearing a guy on comms saying how he just started EVE 2 days ago and was having a blast haha). Thats just one example, there's many more.
---
Babying people 24/7 gets a bit tiring after the 50th person 
---
Nnnnnnnooooo. Anomalies have been infinitely respawning due to infrastructure hub upgrades since 2009. The respawn mechanic hadn't been touched until late 2018, even.
---
well put why i quit this game: company got too greedy
---
Hey Raz can you do one for keepstar doomsday damage  (against bombers specifically) ? 😉
---
Even normalizing them would be fine, a uniform training speed for every thing is what we really need. 
---
Bonus if we can just train sp straight in to our unallocated pool
---
What, were there no NPC stations or conquerable outposts back in 1970 when you claim you were playing or whatever other hyperbole you want to flounce about? Dumbass. 
---
If you're interested, I could have a little work for you. PvP only, I'll pay you whether you get kills or not, but you'll earn a bonus if you bring me killmails. I'll even throw in some ships for free to get you started. And if you need advice, I can provide that too.
---
If you're interested, mail Jennifer Maxwell in game.
---
&gt; nullsec and wh space should be hardcore mode.
---
Nullsec seems to be just player run hisec.  As long as you are part of the region faction you want get attacked, apart from the occasional ganker.
---
and deleted, due to reports ;)
---
\+1
---
all these plebs here trying to excuse CCPs money grabbing practices simply to justify that their sunk cost fallacy isn't that bad and could've happened with any other game
---
Though I think the Australians were travelling for something like three months.
---
You do know that CSM voting works via STV, right?
---
&gt; Dumbass. 
---
Thx same to you little troll ...
---
At least ccp is still consistent in throwing money into the dumpster
---
So you have set your device clock to be set manually. Configure it to fetch time from the internet (your carrier) and suddenly you'll have a lot less problems in your life with all modern services.
---
And yet I get onto the CSM, without being on the Goon lists...
---
the game is boring as shit and you still spend 30 $ for that?
---
Count me in as interested as well. 
---
Please dm brisc on discord.  He would like to have a word about your non-compliant posting
---
Never had that problem myself. 
---
First time using a bridge titan is always a blast. It is the most colossal ship in the game and combined with the tense atmosphere of the fleet (things getting serious) it makes the thing epic. Also, the fact to be dropped into the unknown was a good addition to this.
---
Funny enough, I don't have much "lasting" friendship in Eve. I met plenty of friendly people, would for sure be remembered by some people I've met regularly on coms, but not really beyond that. I don't really have that one dude I've played for hundred of ours with and would stick to always follow each other throw corp and shit. Mostly because I switch corp regularly (3 to 6 months) so it's not helping, but it's not like I'm a huge BFF dude IRL anyway. Not sure if I would change that, I like the way not matter if change the group I'm playing with I just end up with a good group of people having fun, and it's still good to meet different people of different background playing Eve in a sightly different way.
---
Going on my first Eve meeting with Evesterdam in march tho, so maybe it will change.
---
2fa with app here as well and can use sisi as well. On sisi it emails me a code even though app 2fa had been enabled on tq for a long time.
---
Uhh.. what? Why would you revoke 2FA tokens when the password is reset? I can't think of many services that do this.
---
It's irrelevant. The point is that assets in k-space have never had to be at risk. If CCP makes Upwell structures have no asset safety in k-space, players will just store their shit in NPC stations. How fortunate for us that we live in a region with convenient NPC stations!
---
Oh hello again friend. What changes would you make to the game to improve the overall experience for everyone?
---
Just make sure to increase limit of nonextractable points to 5.5M for those accounts
---
OH they are having it in Amsterdam this year. That's cool it's 40 minutes driving for me. 
---
How hard are these sotiyos to destroy? I imagine there are a lot of NPCs defending it. 
---
They are doing a bunch of meetings all over the world this year
---
Dude, if you ever feel like giving the game a second chance, feel free to convo me and i'll make sure you get in one of my fleet as soon you get home. I have ships and fits tht can be flow by day 1 caracter and BE SURE TO HAVE CONTENT. I make daily roam with plenty of newbros and i feel plesed to teach them the ropes of EVE. Yes, it's a long game, yes it can be hard to learn, but there isnt much games out there like this one. Getting a couples kills while laughting with bros is one of the best feeling.   
---
Have a great day sir ! o7  
---
\-Kaai
---
&gt; Just do what I did, get kicked out, throw a bitch fit, and quit
---
Well it seems the tickets arent foto sale yet but i definantly wanna go there 
---
Can I get your tril please I really need it
---
Now if you wonder who this would look with actual values plotted I have something.
---
Stabber, Thorax and Maller with some fits.

while being blueballed sucks, it wasnt bad for us in horde last night. hell i spent the night in a cards against humanity match with 6 others in the cap group xD
---
time well spend and good times had
---
Yea it’s dumb right, I ganz shit in my nyx duck that idea wouldn’t be Abel to do that anymore 
---
&gt; use the mobile app for 2FA, you will never be able to log into Sisi again.
---
Just log in using the Server list (Top right corner in the launcher -&gt; Serverlist -&gt; Click Play next to Singularity)
---
This will bypass any 2FA/Handshake issues or whatever you might have. This only works for Singularity
---
If you want to make the most hardcore game out there even more hardcore, to an authistic-only level, well guess what? You end up with a game only authists will play. Not good for the future of CCP and the game.
---
You may not like it but filthy casuals is what keeps CCP's offices staffed.

Alas , the new player I want it all now attitude. No, thankfully Eve isn't for you. Most people start out as a noob and learn slowly and deliberately. Can't have it all 
---
China is very protectionistic of their own markets and sees SK as a danger in the gaming markets.
---
Ah thank you, I was wondering how a rorq would get 100mil an hour mining Loparite for example when a procurer makes like 120mil.
---
This will escalate eventually into 8 hour 1 fps bs once test goes all in with caps (with goons ofc) and long grinding entosis and bashes, at best, Horde will just move etc. 
---
Or we can have 150 guys roam around and have gudfites for next 12 months.

I think the idea is that most hacks are through corrupted email accounts.

The hacker resets the passwords and gains access to your accounts that way.

The way I look at EVE is not a video game that I log in to play a quick match. It’s my hobby. Some people build model cars or fly drones or ride mountain bikes for fun. I play EVE. And when you look at it this way you can budget additional expenses for a hobby. I just do what everyone else does and save some money back until pled goes on sale. Another good savings is the DLC packs. Don’t pay full price for them. They go on sale for half price and you can only get one per account of each. I probably spend a modest amount on the hobby compared to most people but it’s enough for me to keep playing and investing in my characters. 
---
Additionally EVE is a sandbox. Don’t go into it thinking you should be doing something based on some videos you watched. If you really put your mind to it you can do anything. If the pvp isn’t doing it for you, you could try scamming, ganking, stealing, war decking, basically if you can imagine it, then it can be accomplished. You just have to put your mind to it. If you aren’t enjoying the game it means you just haven’t discovered the depths of it and your niche in those depths.

Good luck friend

Fly safe o7

Incredible, we’ve found the one person dumber than querns
---
Super easy if you know what you are doing
---
It's one of those...

CCP did claim they were doing Scrum and Agile development. Worked great!

he was flying a rorq back in december 2017 so i don' think he injected into capital ship recently... [https://zkillboard.com/kill/66533802/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/66533802/)
---
If you are in it for the isk, I would recommend the abyssal sites. It o as much higher investment to get into the tier 5 but you can double your income on average and if you get good drops, triple it. 
---
Ah okay. Totally didn't get that :)
---
Then Maybe we can meet as Well hehe. So what corp/alliance do you belong to ?   
---
What’s a good way to learn what to do, I’m interested in the mechanics of how they work and if it can be done solo with a super
---
My alliance is in my flair :p
---
&gt; Our feeds are strategic.
---
my proposal would be
---
-only useable in npc stations
---
-once "locked" they cannot be moved/repackaged/trashed
---
-able to fit any ship from frigs to titan (supers would need to be assest safety to low sec npc to be able to store)
---
-cannot be stored in corp hangars or pos or citadels unless packaged
---
-and of course for those snowflakes password recovery will take the same level of security as an account recovery(requiring i.d./cc info/account origin)

In my Flair ?   
---
We are in aridia but we are not An alliance yet we are gonna make one. But it's still in early stage and we are still thinking and discussing on what we are gonna do and how
---
Needs a keyfor damage type and needs some identification of tech 2 ammos like a different colour text. Apart them small improvements absolutely awesome work 
---
this is b8
---
You know you can ease the pain with this magic tools that command the Drones of all 40 Rorqus at once ?
---
Was told by a friend, dunno how that should work ...
---
On reddit you can see a small picture and text, maybe not on mobile. It's called a flair, you can pick one on the side bar.
---
Do not mine under them, it might drip on your head ....
---
Interesting stuff.
---
This piece of work is intended more as a quick reference guide for the FC or discerning linemember. 
---
What ammo should I be shooting in my Blap-Nag at a T1 Amarr Resist Profile at Close-Range when webbed by a vigilant with abyssal webs?
---
What should I call for my Sleipnir-fleet to load against this 100MN Shield-Loki gang at 70km?
---
Data is great, but information is *beautiful*.
---
It's kinda both, and both are kinda fun to some of us.
---
literally “ha ha mAdE yOu FoRm”
---
Ahh thank you for replying! That makes sense since I keep hearing solo and threes. I always heard of cruisers but not frigates. Frigates do sound better, everything is always better with friends. 
---
It does sound like fun. Sadly I don't play often in USTZ but if you want to take a crazy Aussie who's still getting the hang of this game again sometime on a weekend, I'm available :)
---
The kill boards in EVE remind me of the dps charts in other MMOs. I used to be pretty into the raid scene but damn I hated them. At best it shows you can press buttons in the right order but it doesn't tell you how good you are at the game and they always end up padded after a few weeks anyway. Great for self evaluation but little else. 
---
I get the nostalgia though of KBs, I found the kill board for one of my original accounts. It had my first low sec small roam. My first time PvP'ing and we only found one target. A T1 and a faction ship. Looking at the kill board made me remember that fight, how nervous and scared I was and then the cheers directed at me because I got the kill shot on the faction shop even though I had no idea what was going on. I can still hear their voices and that was like ten years ago! 
---
Great work. Really useful. Thank you. 
---
If you think flying your own ship and making your own decisions is the same as fleet scale F1 pushing I don't know what to tell you
---
Fleeting with someone to passively soak up their standings increases will only work for corp standings, not faction. Increasing faction standings is less about the quality of missions you do, and more about the quantity, as the increases derive from storyline missions. 
---
The fuck dude. I appreciate your committment to EVE and TEST but you should prioritize RL, in the long run you'll be much happier that way.
---
Not botting, but I did just as described. Pilots on a gate, multiple directions, x number of jumps in any direction, then all surrounding systems. Wasn't that bad. Rotate for new sigs frequently and just listen for gate activation. 
---
That's like the most evil thing you can do in eve!
---
Typically, the same thing you'd do now. You'd go looking for them. 
---
yeah, just found out we both wrong, that was added to dominion late, in 2010. Maybe I missed that because from 2009 until 2015 i was in PvP-only groups with minimal PvE and did Anos frequently  with Super not before 2017. In 2009 Beltratting in good truesec with a PvP-Fit Cynabal was netting more money than Anoms.

---
First, you seem to be under the mistaken impression that rattlesnakes are used for ratting. Only capitals and disposable VNIs are used for ratting. If you *do* use a rattlesnake for ratting, whatever fit you have cobbled together will certainly be insufficient to tank the BR 10/10. Check the Goonfleet forum, looking in the Player vs Everything section.
---
Ah so it’s just a forward operating base. I suck at those. Tried to do one in highsec when I returned after a long break. Chained 2 nestors and lost 2bil fairly quickly haha. 
---
I think you guys are talking about different things.  In 2015 they increased anomaly spawn rates:
---
http://evenews24.com/2015/07/08/dev-blog-summer-of-sov-nullsec-pve-and-upgrades/
---
And then in 2017 I think they tweaked some minor things.  Maybe added the NPC capitals?  
---
All the people advocating on this always just speak of the small structures. Nobody said remove it from Keeps and Forts. Also the timer issue that was brought up only applies to small, and even more specified - small Low Power structures.
---
was it a blood raider fob?
---
lmao, thats far too much effort

I really can’t remember, it was in the forge so I think Guristas

When I was originally in TEST Alliance, I felt as though I was another faceless individual in the masses and as if I wasn't actually learning the game. I had moved on from manufacturing and wanted to broaden my horizons in PVP. Turned out, mass 500 man fleets and hitting F1 really taught me nothing more than the basic mechanics of the game. It frustrated me, not understanding what certain ships did and what they were capable of after spending a couple of years in Null, and not to mention my "friendship" retention had been quite low upon joining, it really lead to me often finding myself quitting the game and coming back for the same thing to happen.
---
I decided to contact an old friend of mine that had quit a couple years back to find a smaller tight nit organization, he originally wanted me to reach out to an individual named Kaiser, and my efforts of reaching out to him went rather unsuccessful. I ended up joining a Low-Sec faction warfare group called Black Fox Marauders, they were a pretty slick group and it seemed like all I wanted. Small organization focused on small gang stuff. I was in for maybe a week when we got the call that a nearby Alliance was chasing an enemy ship that could potentially get us a decent fleet fight. We joined our fleets and set off with the Alliance by the name of Did He Say Jump. 
---
We had found the target they were looking for, and it wasn't soon until it lit a cyno and dropped carriers -- now back then, to me, that was a big deal. It's not every day you drop something like that on a few Battle Cruisers, along with an entire fleet. The fleet fight made us rely on not just our fleet commanders orders, but our own intuition as well, it felt like another level of Eve Online that I had only heard about but had yet to witness. I was wiped off grid in a matter of minutes as the fight continued; though looking down the Did He Say Jump comms, I noticed a familiar name. Kaiser, a member of The Institution. I contacted him and inquired about a mutual friend, he had apparently been speaking back and forth between one another about me and needless to say I ended up joining The Institution with Kaiser and many other people who had been my friends ever since. People who were able to help teach me the inner workings of the game, give me some meaning and put me on the field as a person with actual knowledge of the mechanics of ships and gave me the ability to predict the potential outcome of the fights based off composition. Albeit, DHSJ the alliance disbanded and Kaiser himself went to Northern Coalition where he is happy-- but DHSJ The Corporation is thriving with people I've considered to be extremely good friends and it keeps me going in this game, it keeps me logging in. Knowing your allies and having decent friends in this game is everything. I'm not that faceless guy I was in TEST, I actually have a purpose and a constant source of content with these people, this is year 4 with them and I could not be happier.

---
Well the high functioning autists are most likely the content creators that make the casual gameplay possible for you in the first place. Unless you want to just rat/mine all day but calling that content is a bit of a stretch.
---

Not sure what's funny about my statement, unless you have some set dislike for the Wolf?
---
Mine is on space bar
---
There is no "standard" rattlesnake fit for ratting. VNIs are the standard. If you *do* use a rattlesnake for ratting, whatever fit you have cobbled together will certainly be insufficient to tank the BR 10/10. IIRC you need x-type EM/therm resists and an MJD. Check the Goonfleet forum, looking in the Player vs Everything section.
---
When I first started playing EvE I started as a highsec carebear playing with a group of dudes who helped me get started in the game.  Eventually we moved to low sec and that is when I met Derth Ramir, we were both pretty young and found that playing together made the game more fun. Nine years later and he made the choice to completely extract and remove himself from the game. While it was probably best for him, I will always miss more talk of drake navies and heavy missiles.
---
Keep in mind, that while alpha, you can use the daily alpha skill injectors once a day for 50k skill points a pop and that will help you skill up pretty fast. Just a thought. 
---
Tell that to all the Legacy members who were mad about getting blue balled. Your leaders playing fun political games while they sit in the mumble quiet room doesn't seem terribly fun to them.
---
If only your leadership took it seriously Horde might have -1 Fortizar right now lmao.
---
I don't understand what this is supposed to accomplish. If you remove asset safety from small structures, it only affects people who can't afford or can't protect larger ones. Are these the people who you're really worried about?
---
IIRC, the NPC capitals came in with the Citadel patch, because you need drops from them to make meta capital modules. It's not really that important of a detail in regards to this conversation, though.
---
And, yeah, I'm talking about the core mechanic of ratting anomalies respawning after completion. That is a far more important detail than the total number of anomalies present in a single solar system at one time.
---
The question should rather be "why should they be an issue ?". Because people think it's abnormal to be able to inject into a Titan with a fresh character ? If you have the ISK to buy the injector, why the fuck shouldn't you if you want to do it ? And if you pay in real money for a Titan and Injectors, be my guest, you'll probably lose it, which gives content, and makes CCP money by buying extractors/PLEX which is good for the game.
---
I mean, people are acting like retarded fucks because "Houhou you can inject anything to a brand new char", yeah, so, what's the problem ? There is none. Injectors are not that evil monster everyone wants to portrait, I inject chars myself (with ISKs) and I really don't care, cause I have objectives and it is good for CCP if they sell extractors. 
---
Yeah man, but if you want to rorq mine join rorq beans and or blessed beans
---
Yes ... imagine this kind of nyx or avatar skin ....
---
&gt;Anomalies have been infinitely respawning due to infrastructure hub upgrades since 2009
---
wrong
---
80 POS = 3 days of autistic grinding
---
3 raitarus = 1 week at least
---
&gt; Lying about it to your line members means that you’re basically blue balling your own line members just as bad as the enemy’s. 
---
Literally every alliance in the game does this to an extent, posting OPs with people knowing full well that nothing will happen. 
---
Hell even Horde have done this for the 9-4 Keepstar anchoring. They posted a gold-pen and were pinging for max dudes every couple of hours in the day leading up to the timer, saying enemies were hype pinging and forming everything to come for the Keepstar.
---
In reality, goons were forming to frag the 24(? number could be wrong) citadels that had been anchored in Delve for the same time as the Keepstar - Gobbins and Horde Directors knew about this but still pinged for max dudes to save the Keepstar because people were coming for it. Horde members complained about it on mumble and in discord when that happened and now TEST members are complaining about last night.
---
Every alliance has people who complain about what happens on OPs and how things are handled, why this .1% of TEST complaining is suddenly a big deal I've no idea.
---
So what titan for 20b? Sounds great! Ratting titans everywhere. And dont forget about 5b supercarrier and 250mil carrier
---
Some general thoughts. Yes it takes time and effort to properly skill up pilots. If the corp you joined doesnt have ways of discussing/making time for you move on to another corp. New players are generally showered with whatever you could think of from isk to free fit newbro ships to skillbooks. If the corp you joined does not offer something like that you leave for one that does. ISK making is tedious at the beginning. Your options now are to take the time and effort to skill and train towards being a better pilot or being a credit card warrior for instant gratification. I highly suggest not opening your wallet. in this case as you can quite easily get into something you cant afford to lose. 
---
Yeah ik
---
No, this will mostly affect people that spammed severall hundreds of Asshouses and Raitarus because they do not need to maintain them. 
---
The small guy will keep his citadel fueled as it his his precious, and if he is not a brainlet secure his assets. Or he will place it as bait for creating content where it would be nice the kill would offer any incentive as the attacker could possibly loot something.
---
The current mechanic denies conflict and so content.
---
People do it in Quebec too. FYI
---
If you're spamming hundreds of asshouses, you're not doing so to store things inside them. How does removing asset safety affect the spammer?
---
Just gotta find the right group. I enjoy bringing on new dudes and showing them the ropes. We were all there once. I do my best to create an atmosphere to learn. My senior guys in Corp are top notch dudes, and we’re all pretty friendly. Sure. This game has its moments where I just want to unsubscribe and walk away, but little nights like that is what keeps me coming back. 
---
#boson
---
Nope. At most, I'm off by a year; I started playing in 2010, and ratting anomalies respawned within five minutes of completion then. 
---
Pretty sure 7 years ago it wasn't an ewar bonused ship yet.
---
I still get all giggly when we bridge in somewhere. Especially since you know what it looks like when a fleet bridges in. 
---
I run a bookshop with a friend from the Netherlands that I met through EVE several years back (I'm from Iceland).  
---
We met in a small pirate corp I joined with an IRL friend on an alt account, eventually the active core of that corp was just me, my IRL friend, him and one other player we've also kept contact with.  The only times I really play EVE are with him now (many, many corps later).
---
We played all sorts of games outside of EVE as well through the years, could talk about pretty much everything too.  
---
About 5 years ago he moved to the UK and a couple of months back I moved there as well since he'd won a bookshop in a raffle and needed someone to run it with him.  
---
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45941874 for anyone that wants more details / finding that hard to believe.
---
I don't think anyone cared this time, at least not in the comms I was in.  You have the pings, so you know that we were told to hold jump/death Clones until told otherwise, so no one was really out anything.
---
When you enjoy the geopolitical parts of the game, it's easy to look at the bigger picture.
---
 If you only play "to shoot spaceships", yeah, last night was a loss.
---
But as far as the story goes, getting out formed and not fighting isn't the worst possible outcome.  It's just another part of the larger narrative that some of us enjoy just as much as shooting spaceships.
---
Wow, it's that bad?!?
---
Damn, it's giving gankers all the time in the world to setup....
---
Yup. I hate how EVE has gone more and more ..casual. 
---
Everything is aimed at easy, safe content for the people to buy as many subs as they can and rat safely, while denying content to the people that actually want to engage and risk themselves for fun content. This just so they can play part in meaningless big battles. Hell, even titan kills are almost meaningless now.
---
Easy example: Let's make citadels a pain in the ass to destroy, and when you do, it's entirely meaningless since it's a dirt cheap structure and none of the users lost jack shit.
---
I love EVE, and still enjoy the mechanics, but I HATE how everything has geared up towards big blobs and safe risk free ratting and mining just so the casual players can jerk off to flying a big ship in a meaningless fight, while CCP racks up the subs on empty ratting/mining accounts.
---
It gets even better when you do massive fleet warps, you see people warping in from the other side of the gate ))
---
I take your strawman, for these it would be mostly the timers (48h to destroy if low power). For content citadels used as bait from smaller groups, they would profit both from timers (to make them more engageable) and from removed asset safety. 
---
From the viewpoint of incentives for doing stuff, a Fort or a Keep will for sure give a bigger fight and at least a multi-billion killmail. Why should someone strive for an 800-Million killmail that takes him 7 days and give him no loot?. You are better of ganking stuff in Hisec with a catalyst
---
Is that how the launcher works? /sarcasm
---
I do that, and it still prompts me for a code from the app. And then it tells me I'm wrong.
---
Serious question ... have you enabled 2FA on your email?       
---
As you know - most of the cases start with someone hacking your email.  
---
Wow, do they still operate?
---
&gt; It's a community safespace
---
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
It's not a strawman, you idiot. In what world is a raitaru spammer also including a little parcel of goodies in each one? They're there to create timers, not to store assets. Removing asset safety doesn't dissuade a raitaru spammer. It just isn't happening. You're insane.
---
If you think that raitaru spamming is bad, that's perfectly fine. However, asset safety, whether it exists or not, has *nothing* to do with raitaru spam. It just doesn't.
---
i love when a ship just APPEARS next to you
---
lmao
---
I made some friends in my last corp, but they stopped logging in and I moved to another alliance. We had some good laughs getting drunk and gate camping on a Friday night. (hold the pod, REEEEE) Sometimes I wonder about them and I feel a little bit sad.
---
I'm interested too! Amarr lasers next?  ☺ 
---
Or that hybrid jungle of gallente / caldari 
---
This is way cooler than what I was guessing it was. 
---
My guess by the way was four compute sticks hot-glued together into the form of a ninja star.
---
&gt; When you enjoy the geopolitical parts of the game, it's easy to look at the bigger picture.
---
The problem here is that in regards to the geopolitical parts of the game you don't actually need to play. You can just keep in contact with people &amp; read reddit, forums, and blogs. 99.9% of players are completely irrelevant to the geopolitics of eve yet somehow feel like watching other people do stuff is fun. More power to ya, but I don't think the majority of players find that to be a sustainable source of content; rather, it's a justification for all the boring shit they are asked to regularly do.
---
Shooting people as a part of the politics is what keeps me logging in.
---
Sometimes the politics dictates that I don't get to shoot people, and that sucks, but that's a price I'm willing to pay to keep politics integrated with my game play.
---
To be honest, without both the politics and PVP, I don't think I would be playing.  I did just pure, non-political PVP the first time I played, and it got boring.
---
That I could leak vital information to my alliance to gain them an advantage ... at least thats what I witnessed with own eyes.
---
This was one of the ones I used to bug out before CCP fixed the skins - nice to have it 'back'.
---
Pretty sure it was.
---
lol yikes
---
30 mil ticks vs C5s?  Ignoring that WH anomalies respawn in different wormholes while sov anomalies respawn in the same wormhole?  What the fuck kind of comparison is that?  If you want to compare VNI ratting to something, compare it to running C2s... or compare super ratting to C5s.  And you cannot leave out that the VNI or super can run 23/7 in a single system while after a few hours, a day or two at best, WH anoms are used up.
---
"let's say" ... "let's say"... "let's say".. I have a better idea.  You go do some investigation rather than making shit up to support ignorant ideas.
---
&gt;The truly hilarious thing here is that way back when, Hillmar created a game of ruthless capitalism that you nerds love the shit out of and has stood the test of time, but every time that a remotely capitalistic concept is applied to that RL company (which you should love, because it means the lights can stay on just a little longer even if they dim ever so slightly), everyone loses their minds and expects this thing to run like a hippie commune funded by some benevolent billionaire...
---
Now that's a great comment.
---
Join faction warfare (specifically a player corp).
---
Stop being a whiny bitch.
---
Learn to pvp by flying, and dying in, cheap T1 frigs with meta fittings.
---
You can fund pvp by doing pvp. LP in FW is a nice bonus.
---
Mission running is for chumps (generally speaking).
---
You only need one account. It doesn't need to be omega. Have a hauling/market toon for moving your ships and fittings safely through hisec in bulk from market hubs.
---
If eve is still boring after your killboard is filled with kills and losses (hard fought, fun fights, not alliance F1 monkey bullshit), then eve probably isn't for you.
---
&gt;If you have the ISK to buy the injector, why the fuck shouldn't you if you want to do it ?
---
You're dangerously close to P2W territory there.
---
Skill injectors are a "rich get richer" mechanic. Those who pay get the big ships, or get to simply accelerate their training in a way that poorer players can't. 
---
But pre-citadel you still never got a chance at my loot unless I firesaled all my ships?  I don't see why it's that much of a difference to flipping a station in  that regard.  What is the issue is the time taken to kill it, and the ability to just spam them forever.
---
go play cod scrub :D
---
I am a hard pass on all structure bashes
---
As a few others have said, "it depends".  Specifically, it depends on what you're expecting to get out of running the L4s.
---
There's two kinds of "endgames" you can reach with L4s in my (mind), depending on what you're doing the missions for:
---
- Blitzing: running the missions as fast as possible, to earn as much LP as possible; more LP -&gt; more ISK
---
- Marauding: running the missions as completely as possible, clearing each pocket of rats and salvage; more bounties + salvage -&gt; more ISK
---
I don't normally salvage when blitzing, because it detracts from the time spent running missions and thereby cuts into profits.  When I'm looking to just chill and shoot some rats, however, I'll typically drop an MTU and salvage drones and work towards the full clear.  If you time things right, or have a few salvagers/tractor beams in your utility high slots, the salvaging itself should be able to keep pace with the ratting, and should rarely leave you on-field waiting for drones to finish up those last few wrecks.
---
Quake has good tracking?
---
Nope, very clearly asking for a code from the app. Never received a code email ever.
---
It's not the same, it's still pretty boring after a few nights out, let's be honest it's comms that make it fun. 
---
Which just illustrates my point. Why is Sisi still sending you emails if you've switched to the app ages ago?
---
Sisi gets hung up on old authentication methods, and it won't let you use the recent one. Which, in my case, means it's hung up on an old phone app.
---
Seems like its different for everyone then. No idea how to solve the issue, sorry. 
---
Yeah ma dude, if you wanna shoot things, join Zarvox fleet (some name the ingame channel please) or join "the beehive" to fly with bjorn bee (if you manage to fly according to his commands day1 then I ok the game is not for you, but you won't). Having a second account is cool and all but you are playing in a sandbox. Never let anyone tell you how to play the game as long as he isn't referring to its mechanics (and even there, things are debatetable).   
---
If you have the means to make some ISK than go for a bomber (but make sure to skill core skills whenever possible). If you have covert ops cloaking (cloaking lvl4), a frigate and covert ops to 5 (this is all close a month of skilltime), you can fly with bombers bar (same name ingame channel) and kill big stuff (they even reimburse a certain amount of your ship loss).   
---
If you are the pvping type and don't wanna go do solo pvp in lowsec, than the above mentioned might be suitable for you.   
---
One thing I can tell you though: You need patience in this game. It takes some time until you have proper skills unless you use real money to buy injectors which I do not advise you to do.   
---
I was bridged by a friend in a Komodo recently and, yeah, I was a bit giddy. First time I'd ever seen one.
---
huh i was thinking that a massive subculture within the game that defined success only by producing as much human misery as possible toward others, and writing 35 paragraph screeds demanding that the game be reverted back to a state where their misanthropic playstyle could be inflicted on everyone else without penalty was what was wrong with EVE
---
weird
---
Lol the backwards-warping Megathrons has been something else to watch lol.
---
WOOO^O^O^O^O^o^o^o^o^o
---
Possibly also drones and sentry drones?
---
Swooooooosh
---
I've noticed this with my Charons.  In your video the model shows up just about 30 seconds before it has actually fully landed and stopped lol.
---
I don't think so, for the simple reason that if you "P2W" a Titan, you won't have the skill (I'm talking about real skill), the knowledge to play it, the secondary accounts needed and you're just going to lose your Titan when you take it out. Just look at all the P2W morons with stupid purple fits, they P2W, yet they lose it. 
---
I guess after the bellyrubbing and showing what a cunt you are as a person with your exposing of other peoples emotions that you provoked on your stream while sitting in the back rubbing hands and laughing, there are only 2 ways for you to be in next CSM, buy voices or rub a belly to get the Goon vote brigade backing you. No sane person outside Imperium narratives would vote for you.
---
:thonking:
---
Agreed.  He's a very visible cheater, so if CCP are minded to make examples (which is basically all they do when it comes to cheating), the couldn't pick a better player.
---
If you think CCP is going to devote the manpower necessary to convert eve to a new engine, you're out of your mind.
---
Me too 😞

That's the perfect word for it. You just didn't know what it meant.
---
Asset safety and the timers are both a bullshity mechanic. Yes, pre-citadels you couldn't lose assets in space due to stations being invincible, does this make it a good mechanic ? Probably not. 
---
EVE is (supposed to be) a game with risk vs reward, a concept which is now merely a joke, but whatever. Cutting asset safety out of the game for nullsec regions would make it more profitable and more efficient to raid an ennemi region rather than just having to lose the will to live through multiple CTAs which are "That timer", then "another timer" and finally "oh yeah that timer also lol", and on and on.
---
Eve 2.0 
---
the irony is: At some point you will be glad to have to wait for something and to reach another goal. But I still remember that when I started our it was extremely boring to wait for the "beginner skills" to finish and finally be able to do stuff. Nowadays I consider them to complete quite quickly in comparison to  JDC 5 on 4 accounts... (yeye Minmatar Titan 5 blabla takes a gazillion days blabla)  
---
What if its possible to "stitch" servers together? It wouldn't require a total overhaul.
---
I've also never had an issue on SiSi but I haven't been on recently either. 
---
Sounds like a Nice story 
---
PJSalt
---
they also warp to stations and player owned structures, so what you maybe seeing is them "docking up" and why they disappear off of your scan
---
And they are going to make a fucking BR out of this. I'm so fucking sad.
---
But no fucking way this get implemented into Eve as an engine.
---
Yeah, but at least in my case, it takes both the political shit, and the PVP to keep me interested.  I feel like that's pretty common.
---
It's not like we don't like to PVP, it's just more interesting if whatever we are doing (whither it's PVPing or rorq mining or whatever it is we're doing) is a part of a bigger story.
---
So let's say the politics are a bit stale, and we're just honor brawling Goons in V-3 everyday, that's fun, but it's not something I can enjoy long term.
---
Or if we get out formed, and the politics dictate that we just go rorq mine or whatever, that's not a deal breaker either as long as it fits the narrative.  Clearly I'll last longer shooting Goons, but the cool thing is that if we end up getting out formed a lot, we can always just go shoot Goons.
---
But yeah, the boring shit sucks, but we keep doing it because that's the shit you need to do to get UALX.
---
Now before you bring the "Mah TIDI" argument, yes, the TIDI sucks, but from a narrative standpoint, UALX was a windfall.  I mean, that was a great story.  You could write a book about the multi-year build up to that fight, and nerds would read it.  If you took it out of the Eve universe, a lot of nerds would read it.
---
So this was a bit more of an effort post then I had wanted, but whatever.  I get why we are misunderstood, and why this type of game play isn't for everyone.
---
Relative to other ammo types for artillery, yes. 
---
Don't worry, his wife was taken care of.  Not everyone got blue balls.
---
Thats.....not how any of this works.
---
&gt;if you "P2W" a Titan, you won't have the skill (I'm talking about real skill), the knowledge to play it
---
You do if you're an already experienced player who's starting an alt. Skill injectors minimize the impact of loss for those players while leaving new players unable to match.
---
avoiding Google wherever possible valid for not turning it on?
---
OBV asking for a friend.
---
but great idea, yes. 
---
In all honesty this has all the hallmarks of being just another vaporware promise to attract venture capitalist investment rather than trying to create a legitimate functioning commercial engine.
---
There's a couple of these every year that make grand promises and then retreat into complete radio silence, no partnerships with studios, no tangible demos, no actual engine release.
---
Make report IG , ccp said that they dont care what it s said here and the only way to get him banned is to report in game
---
Pm me when you start recruiting, Im looking for a new group to play with.
---
This is what I want.
---
If you want to lock your account, you file your name and mailing address, and CCP physically mails you a code. If you want it unlocked, you have to physically mail the code back.
---
the funny thing is though: There is no real need to catch up with people. There are people with over 100m SP but almost zero PVP skills (miners, producers and whatevs). Also never underestimate dumb: There are so many people giving you free content just by 
---
a) not understanding mechanics
---
b) using expensive fits that are useless in the relevant engagement
---
c) using doctrine fleet setup ships for solo pvp
---
d) being careless
---
e) thinking bigger is better (it is not)
---
f) thinking more bling is better (sometimes true)

---
I can confirm, fun was had. Also how does 70B become 80B? Also, Also, when you bother to bring super capitals, one will disconnect and die such is life. :)
---
You dont "lose" anything by trying it out, download and get playing. Sure you will train your skill slower then if you payed for a subscription but that dosent really matter here. There is no "end level" and "end game" per say in EVE.
---
Sure down the line if you decide to stay in EVE you may have "lost" a month or two worth of skill points compared to if you started subscribing right away but but if that matters you have skill planned that will take a year or so to complete  anyway so it again dosent matter (or you use skill injectors and.. it dosent matter)
---
Start playing, dont loose anything by starting as a alpha
---
Oh really? pray do tell
---
They gave out a bookshop in a raffle :O
---
Thank you for the silver!!!
---
I'm reminded of that game years ago (I frankly can't remember the name and am having trouble googling any big space battles that aren't EVE) that did a massive stress test that wanted to demonstrate smooth gameplay with more players than 6VDT, and it ended up just being a simple shooter with, effectively, sub-instances.
---
I'll believe it when they actually make something out of it.
---
This is so cool. Thank you.
---
I think they plan on it...
---
Chris Roberts: hold my beer
---
CCP can't fix their own chat servers. What makes you think they can do... whatever it is you think that means.
---
GET OUT OF THE POD! GET OUT OF THE POD AND SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!
---
*Hold tackle on pod*
---
It is true tho...
---
or is he?
---
Serious question - did you report it using support page?
---
hahahahha you fucking emotional beta.  chads make games, cucks shill for them
---
They are not scannable until you are in the site and even then they have to combat probe you not the site. Depending on what site really depends on your next 3 questions. If all your running is a VNI its more worthwhile to bookmark the acceleration Gate and sell the site to someone else then attempt to run them yourself.
---
If a low bloat platform that distributes the load across multiple servers is developed, and packaged in an easy-ish to integrate form, yes i think CCP COULD roll it in. Hopefully they only have a handful of developers like you who piss on every bright Idea.  
---
You are a game dev right?
---
hit quality over damage during fleets, if your FC tells you to use 'close range ammo' vs frigates and destroyers, pick titanium sabot immediately.
---
Agreed. In Brave you can start PvPing immediately in standing fleet. you should already have skills enough to go after most since you'll have backup. You can join the big daily fleets immediately in newb tackle (you'll die lots) or ewar ships (you'll learn skills fast to not die) but to be an F1 monkey you'll have to train into doctrine ships.
---
god bless you, here is some silver
---
Escalations will be there for 24 hours. They cannot be scanned down by someone else. 
---
Depending on which escalations, they vary in difficult. I wouldn't try it in a VNI. Usually people do the 6/10s or 10/10s for the rewards, usually in a  T3C or Rattlesnake. Search the exact escalation name to find out more. 
---
Your rewards for the escalations depend on the site name. Most of the time the good money is in the drops.
---
Different escalations have different layouts, and may even further have escalations. Without the actual name of the escalation, can't help more.
---
Fly safe. 7o

I have the luck of being part of one of the oldest and longest lasting corps of my language area. Sure in the close to 11 years I am part of that corp some people left and some new faces joined. But the core 8-10 people are together since 2007, we had several RL-corpmeets where we got drunk together and had fun, the last one just 3 months ago. 
---
I will never get the fascination of being part of groups with several hundreds if not thousands of real people, but I guess thats the same way viceversa.
---
When I look at n-body simulations and see a few million particles all jostling around in the same space, brought to you by the massive parallelism and simulation capability of a pretty average GPU, I do wonder if CCP's current approach is a good one.
---
Players aren't spheres, it's true, but then the GPU is scalable technology.  You can buy Teslas.  If you can think up an architecture that's massively parallel and solvable on these things, you can really make it fly with scaling.
---
when you post this you should post 50 of them at once
---
I.... uhhh....
---
I mean i know troll and all, but seriously, what the fuck do people get out of doing shit like this?
---
Hope you're putting just as much effort into reporting your fellow alliance mates who are botting &amp; inputbroadcasting?
---
im gonna reeee at you for having camera shake enabled 
---
No.  I wasn't the one with the evidence, though I saw his post in local I didn't know he'd posted it in all locals until I saw it here on reddit.
---
I don't see the problem here. If you are an experienced player and the time comes where you're saying yourself "Yeah, I'd like to have a Titan", and assuming you have enough ISK for both, give me one good reason why this should be bad, I see none. If you play EVE since years and made yourself a setup capable of generating a vast amount on money, why should it be bad to use it and inject with that money ?
---
I am in that case, I have enough ISK to inject a new char into a Titan, I just don't want to, I'm more of a Dreadnough type of guy and it's what I'll do. Is it bad that I make enough money to be able to inject Dreadnoughts ? I don't see why. It's the content I like and they way I want to play, there is no reason for it to be a bad thing. 
---
A factory planet with two spaceports (input and output) will burn through all the mats in hours, not days.  You just can't load up enough mats into a single spaceport.  3 is my magic number due to my playtime, millage may vary.

A shield harbinger still works, ALL those lows for damage!
---
What if? Sure. But that’s nothing but a prayer..
---
This isn't just "slap on a load distribution layer" -- it'd be a fundamental change to a 15 year old game systems and the accompanying server architecture.  Good luck there.
---
The tracking bonus outweighs the cap bonus in most fights I'd say. Don't see you getting away from a booster generally kiting with a laser boat either.
---
1/10 no love story
---
You wouldn't believe how many times Eve has done full reset on me. So I am past caring.
---
😂😞
---
I just think that it's unreasonable that CCP (who is slow to develop *anything*) would spend years integrating a new and untested game engine into their game, which has historically had problems with legacy code that nobody could figure out how to untangle.
---
There isn't an "integrate" button on this stuff. It takes thousands and thousands of man-hours to integrate a game engine into a relatively new game, let alone a game with 15 years of spaghetti.
---
Oh, so this is why i lost my ship :(
---
I believe it was primarily a problem in big fuckoff TiDi fights.  It seems like a light load but it's just one more thing the node has to handle for thousands of people at a time, so offloading it made sense, presuming they could do it properly.  Obviously that was not the case.
---
what exactly do they do on a VNI? you target stuff yes, but that does that do as you use drones to shoot the things automaticly
---
What is a reasonable price for escalations?
---
As I've not reported mar5hy (I don't have the evidence from multiple locals, etc.) the answer is yes.  And I won't report a Delve local unless they're irritating or annoying me or others in some way.  In the system in which I hang out this is extremely rare.  
---
&gt;If CCP doesn't integrate this, someone else will. We may be seeing the new era of massive space-fights sooner then we thought.https://wccftech.com/biggest-battle-royale-pvp-aether-engine/
---
Adapt or die.
---
i loved the cheerfulness of your video :D
---
why u keep saying that u're a noob 
---
when u know all the stuff like manual piloting, transversal etc etc
---
and manage to do them pretty well most of the time.
---
i have activated 2fa on all my accounts a year ago
---
Keep the taxes flowing.
---
So what I'm getting for that is "uuh hes camping us so I will cry about it", while if your side does it, you won't lift a finger unless you are personally affected.
---
OK.  It depends on playtime.  I usually load up the custom's office.  The spaceport can take 3333 + 3333 T1 for a T1 -&gt; T2 factory.  It takes &lt; 24 hours to burn through that but just dragging/dropping a couple of times on the customs office from the undock only takes a few seconds.  I don't mind doing it.  
---
Eve has been dying since 2003.
---
Check your mail that is associated with the account ...
---
That is generally set by where you live, ease of site, and loot tables. I cant give you a 1 size fits all price.
---
What does 6/10, 10/10 mean?
---
I understand it's the overall difficulty of the site (at least I think it is), but how do you know what a specific site rating is? Is that also from the site name?
---
How much do you make a day, per account, on average?
---
Wally is the kind of guy that would guild his own post for this karma tho.
---
Youd be amazed what disruptive technologies deployed by competitors can do to a companys' motivation.
---
You're right not everybody has time to do a week of light to moderate ratting or mining. While we're at it, why don't we remove skills, isk, and just give everyone supers and titans? /s
---
If *you* can't do a week of ratting, then it takes *you* longer to get it. That's *your* problem and it's simple as that. My point is that it's a realistically attainable goal in a short period of time if you can put the time in. While your opportunity cost may be too great to actually rat for a skin, that doesn't mean it's not easily possible to get one.
---
 You're crying because your ship isn't as colorful as others, not because it's less powerful. Skins are meaningless and don't offer anything but a cosmetic change.
---
Once again, this is a non-issue and you need to find something more productive to take a stand on.
---
To be fair to you guys, that shit came out on Christmas Day. We formed.. lol.
---
How do you know he isn't 30 day banned? (Serious question, I didn't think it showed ban status anywhere visible)
---
Same experience here. Go ahead and bring a noctis and mtu to see income for yourself and proceed from there. Lots of people said not worth it but for my cirumstances (low isk, low sp, solo) it was. Youll know when its not worth your time. I eventually switched to DEDs/Incursions/Abyssals.
---
And I just thought it's about lag and chosing a bad moment to roam horde space.
---
&gt; uuh hes camping us so I will cry about it
---
His camping has had literally zero affect on me personally but I do think that if CCP is going to make rules, they should apply them equally to everyone.  If they can't enforce them, they should scrap the rules.  Regarless anyone with 60+ active accounts should get their account banned by default as they're clearly mentally ill, but that's a different argument.
---
&gt; you won't lift a finger unless you are personally affected
---
How will I know someone's doing it unless I'm personally affected?  If you want to pitch a Delve Police Force idea to Mittani, knock yourself out.
---
You'd be surprised what not spending millions of dollars on man-hours to overhaul a game engine that already works just fine in 99.9% of situations.
---
Exactly. This assumes they don't just eschew the storage of assets in destructible structures altogether, opting instead for NPC stations. CCP is well aware that players will perform actions with tedium bordering on self-harm territory to reduce risk. Asset Safety is a compromise in favor of the game not being micromanagement hell.
---
Purely coincidence.
---
Not to mention: what competitors? 
---
Null Sec, Ratting, mining, industry, market seeding.  
---
There's a lot you can do in null sec, especially if you get into a good PvP corp. I'm assuming you got stuck in High sec and did mission running which probably ruined you.
---
Also that.
---
Pause. A rat killed him?
---
ok your just being a condescending dick, not attacking them.
---
yer still a twat fam
---
In all seriousness the decline in jumps and kills as seen on Dotlan definitely shows an over 10% decline in player activity from 2017.  
---
It's funny -- the people who vociferously argue against asset safety in k-space are the ones who steadfastly refuse to put their own assets in them in the first place, either by choice or from lack of alternative. They know that what they ask for won't affect them, as they never had the intention of putting their own trash at risk in the first place.
---
I love the ship's capabilities, I love lasers, but ...  
---
... It's too ugly to fly.
---
lol arent you arguing that the game is broken and the devs suck? now your saying it works 99.9% of the time?
---
Same I don’t know these smallgang corps TEST and Horde!
---
If I input broadcast a report with 50 alts will I get banned, asking for mar5hy
---
Player activity goes down as rorqual proliferation goes up. Coincidence?
---
It highly depends on the rat type.
---
Serpentis: YES, YES, YES. You will make a lot of money from the salvage (contaminated lorentz fluids...). Loot contains a lot of big and worthless drones, you do it mostly for the salvage.
---
Sansha, Angels: Check it out. They have Contaminated Nanite Compounds as most valuable stuff - much worse, but if you are a bit slow at running missions, probably still good income. Most loot is not very useful, but gives many minerals from the reprocessing, thus quite valuable.
---
Guristas: Their shield stuff is also not bad. Best loot in my opinion - restrained shield extenders, arbalesk (R)LML ...
---
Blood raider: Worst, neither loot nor salvage is very valuable.
---
Drones: Salvage is completely average, but there's no loot at all.
---
MTUs also attract ninja salvager and HS-PvPer... Be prepared to scoop it quickly, don't shoot at the suspects, even if they manage to kill your MTU. It's more of an issue, if you are at an important mission hub like Lanngisi.
---
Kool, if you could humbly invest 500m American ISK into CCP they might resolve TIDI once and for all
---
Chat servers =/= game engine.
---
Sure, there are problems that need fixing. So have the devs work on the problems, rather than spending years implementing a new engine that will inevitably introduce even more problems.
---
the current approach meaning the one decided on in 2002?
---
Thank you for the TlDr, I was out of the loop too. This is absolutely heart warming. I love you guys!!

I really like this! Good work!!

---
...nobody tell him.
---
This is one of the most common defenses of P2W.
---
My intention was to highlight the core feature at play, not so much the engine itself. Of course its unreasonable to replace the current engine, but I dont think its unreasonable to look at the guts of something like this and dedicate some effort into replicating the features that would make TIDI a thing of the past.  Such is the sequence of innovation in any given field
---
.  
---
Yea.  Trouble is the game has evolved around its possibilities so you couldn't just replace it.  We're talking about a completely different game that would start in a similar way and then go off on a completely different tangent.
---
The sad truth is that the average gamer is economically retarded and generally doesn't understand even the basics of business/pricing/opportunity cost.  It's a large part of why the gaming industry as a whole is in such bad shape right now, and quickly heading for a crash.
---
Don't bother, most people have absolutely no critical thinking skills and cannot intuit anything unless it is spelled out for them directly.

That would be fine if this weren't a consistent, multi-year long problem at CCP.

I mean, it obviously wasn't to invade Delve.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/DED_complexes#DED_rated_complexes
---
If it actually worked that way, yeah, that'd be a  good plan.
---
History proves they instead piss away these profits to try to reinvent the wheel over and over again in markets they don't understand, and cancel game after game for no net value.
---
Because a GFX engine is what draws stuff on your screen and has nothing to do with servers (other than communicating your movements to the server).
---
Nah, probably will invest it in developing some new game that will abandoned halfway through the project
---
I love my Harby. First ever BC I owned. I sourced a cheap hull eight jumps into low sec. I outfitted a cheap Rifter to make it there, then flew the naked hull back to basecamp, sweating bullets all the way.  
---
I didn't see any other players. Huge letdown, but five years later I still have that hull. It's never undocking, it's like a golden memorial to my swinging brass balls.
---
I made some friends! Then most of them stopped playing because CCP made the game completely shit due to greed and incompetence :(
---
Ah ok
---
Damnit  I will be still at work. Go forth and pwn waffles!
---
Cause I know stuff but didn't bring this knowledge onto grid...., -) 
---
Sounds like a problem on your end.  Also use Authy for 2FA, not the google auth app.  You can have it on your PC so if your phone dies, and your phone if your PC dies.
---
Please don't, leave this game to die as it should...
---
For a 10/10 maze, the absolute minimum drop you can get is 130 mil, and usually it’s 3-500 mil. So, our prices have been around 175 mil for a while now, and that’s with a certain person doing a lot to drive up prices to help out newer people in VNIs. 
---
But it depends a lot on a few other things, mostly the ratio of escalation runners to ratters in your Corp. If there are tons of people looking for 10/10s, you can price it pretty high and eventually someone will buy it. But if you have only a few people doing escalations, and lots of ratters finding them, you’ll have to price yours lower. 
---
It sounds like some of your data is incorrect. I've been running T5 Electric/Exotic since September and it's been a steady source of fun income. Payout averages at about 300M/hour (including the cost of filaments and everything, obviously), which seems really good to me for high-sec, relatively low-risk PVE. Risking a 3B cruiser is not really that common, unless your connection is unreliable. The only one I lost in the Abyss recently was due to greed with the new secondary nodes that spawn really far away from the transfer conduits. Other than that, T5 is a breeze.
---
To prove my point, I just did 2 Exotic T5: even though I got subpar loot, mostly mats and only one decent mutaplasmid, the total worth stands at 212M (market price). If you factor in the filament costs, it's a net 180M, with a 30 minutes completion time, so 360M/hour. Skillbooks/Unstable mutaplasmids/BPCs will boost this average payout by a lot too if you're lucky.
---
Good point.
---
why avoid google
---
Yeah, hello eve community. I need free shit too, but lets start small... give me your isk and I will give you two times back. 
---
I swear. 
---
I use Authy now, but when I first set up 2FA I wasn't. And that's why I know it's not using the most recent settings on Sisi. Authy works great on TQ, but it says the codes are wrong for Sisi. Which makes me think it's still expecting the old phone.
---
Genuine question - if you killed a keepstar that contained, for example, my Avatar class vessel, do you want a) the ability to loot it in a mad dash to the finish line, b) it to be lost forever and killmailed, or c) I have to pay a far higher asset safety value to get it back?  
---
I recently came back from a year away from the game and the keepstar I put my stuff in was totally untouched, leaving me able to pick up again like I was never gone.  
---
Goons don’t bot. Don’t be silly, or maybe you are just jealous of our awesome skills.

PGL had to do an interview with PC Gamer
---
Met a guy playing a random game called Dungeon of The Endless during a free to play weekend on steam. We had lots of fun and he got me in to EVE Online. During my journey in EVE I met my fair share of bootleg pirates and rednecks BUTT... I met some amazing people from all over the world as well. To some extent only their friendships kept me playing the game for over 3 years on and off. Still talk to some of them almost daily and know I have a safe haven if I want to get back in to the game. The only problem imo is that the game and developers don't really deserve my time and support for all the shit they have pulled along the past couple of years. (Almost the same tier as EA reddit PR which led to the EVE Online developers doing almost 0 community transparency and all those buggy releases even tho people have been reporting the bugs from the test server. I get that this community is filled with trolls and scummy shady botters and people who are looking everywhere for profits and exploits BUTT... come on developers. The petty bot "justice" from shady greedy people who lead the big nullsec alliances are funny at best and just disappointing. CCP brings in the numbers with their yearly security blog post but what's sad about that blog post is that most of those banned accounts are small fishes compared to the ones that bot supers rmting more money than most people's real life salary even tho players have proof of them dodging rules and talking about how eve is just work for them. Some even saying it directly that they are botting and no1 bats an eye.)

That escalated quickly I guess. But ya, met some amazing people playing this game and made many long lasting friendships because of it. 
---
The game is not "dying" or w.e memes you wanna shout at me in the replies. It's just meaningless. 
---
they aren't because you could always buy a character off the bazaar for isk, so they didn't really change anything except making it easier to make a custom one
---
nothing fundamentally changed, it just increased the rate of increase of inequality 
---
Lets just name the start naming the alt campers and who they belong to, such as "Conney Lingus"  Skill urself.
---
This is awesome!  Great work!  Now, would you create one for missiles, hybrid, and lasers?  :)
---
I don't even get asked for the 2FA code on Sisi.
---
&gt;64bit client, which will prevent a lot of the crashes happening during large fights these days
---
[Are you sure about that?](https://youtu.be/BLikP6BDH5w)
---
Good question. in my opinion, a Citadel kill should work just like a regular ship kill. For exemple, a Keepstar gets destroyed, the Keepstar is gone, and everything that is inside it (ships, modules, items) have a 50% chance to be looted.
---
This all needs balancing, I agree, but let's face it, citadels and asset safety are overpowered. Giving the attacking force a chance for what is inside to be looted would be a good content generation, and would press some alliance to actively defend their stuff instead of being "meh, already replaced" assholes who don't care because they are filthy rich and can replace citadels like they please. 
---
I mean, I'll admit that it felt somewhat, I dunno, 'unfair' when I returned from a year away to find that all my crap was exactly where I left it in a Keepstar, leaving me free to choose exactly when to undock and jump, and to pay at best a nominal fee to get it back vs the actual value of my assets.
---
It's not actually any different though.  Going away pre-citadel meant burning a safe, warping my titan there, and going away (if I felt the POS I was in might be at risk).  Either shipping my assets to Jita for a sell or putting them in an NPC null/low station. I still was at virtually no real 'risk' of losing it.  I guess I just don't see what is actually different.  Do I need to slum it outside of the big boy Alliances to 'get it'?
---
someone can explain what's the story?
---
From all I know and heard, the 32bit client can only use 4GB of memory and if you reach it, the eve client crash. And of course in large fights, guess what your memory does ...
---
Too bad this chart is only useful for sleips
---
If you just wonna roleplay, D&amp;D is actually fun.
---
Isn't it the Forward Operating Bases? I was under the impression that the Sotiyo bases did not spawn in HS
---
Go on my CCP white knight...
---
Don't let anyone tell you that there ISN'T something wrong with your brain.
---
Teleport successful!
---
Yea they should do something about those nulsec bots   those greedy People. 
---
Personal preference regarding big data.
---
Thanks, I took a look at authy, isn't it just using backends of 2FA providers and i end up with the same?
---
or a money skin for ships... then proceed to liquidate the company
---
Lol, his second one... 
---
Someone should tell him/friends to just use RR Rattles I guess?  
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74490384/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74490384/)
---
Yeah, without all that space taken up by the warp drive.
---
May I suggest you back up your settings folder?
---
Coming out soon!
---
You're right that the core issue is that the game would have to be incredibly different to allow them to run more calculations in parallel while still allowing the server to process commands in the correct sequential order.
---
There's a lot of fundamental design decisions about Eve that basically preclude CCP from being able to do what everyone else is doing wrt scaling servers, but it's also pretty core to what makes it possible to be on grid with 4000 other nerds and be able to take an action that impacts any number of those other 4000, instead of being pigeon holed into smaller instances or grids and just being fed a rough representation of what's happening everywhere else.
---
I am a Carebear and I approve of the content of this post, if not the tone.  No struggle, no achievement.
---
reee muh data
---
idk i saw someone in here say it works
---
Literally bombs on top of you before you even exit warp properly
---
The account holder will have time to report the hack and get back their account. 
---
Looks like someone wants to make their stock of navy police skins liquid before CCP release a bunch of new ones on SISI.
---
If you just wanna frag nerds, COD is actually fun.
---
Neuts, one invuln can be pulsed if you go cap dry but two can impact your raw hp negatively and gives you no benefit if it’s not running
---
So I can't tell if you're just trolling or if you're actually legitimately asking a question, but since I enjoy explaining things I'll give it a quick shot.  
---
You can't easily 'stitch' servers together, not at a physical level, and not at a software level.  
---
Servers do the processing work of figuring-out what happens after we press buttons on our EVE client.
---
E.g.  I press F1 to shoot at you.  
---
My EVE client sends a message to the servers in London saying "HEY! Capt.Pantsless wants to shoot at Anticosmic."  
---
The server running the star-system we're in does the following:
---
1. Check if I have ammo/capacitor/range/etc
---
2. Subtract that ammo/capacitor amount from my ship
---
3. Do the RNG calculation if I miss/hit/graze your ship
---
4. Do the damage calc given the resists and damage type
---
5. Subtract the resultant damage from your ship
---
6. Check if you blow-up or not
---
All of these steps need to happen in the right sequence with all the other people shooting, moving, warping, etc. You can kinda tell here that each of these steps depends on the previous ones, you can't really divide the work between multiple servers easily,  especially since sending network messages between two servers would be much more expensive then just doing the simple calculation.  If you've ever played D&amp;D, imagine having a huge battle with 400 players and trying to have multiple Dungeon Masters trying to do all the rolls and resolve all the actions, and somehow making sure everyone is synced-up and no one is cheating.  In EVE, everything that happens in a single star-system is handled by one single server.
---
That's why TiDi happens - the server just says "Ok everyone, slow the heck down! I gotta lot of work to do here!", and just chuggs through all the client requests one-by-one. 
---
That's also why CCP can't \*\*just\*\* add more servers. They have been buying more and more faster servers, but there's a limit to how fast a single box can run.
---
Now, it's possible that CCP could re-design how everything works, and figure-out clever ways to divide-up the work of calculating combat (i.e. make it multi-threaded), keeping all the clients up-to-date on everything else that's happening, etc. etc.  That's what it looks like this new game engine has done.  HOWEVER, it's likely that this new engine isn't going to be perfectly comparable with how EVE is designed. It isn't plug-and-play, and game-mechanics would have to radically change to fit the round-peg of EVE into the square-hole of the Aether Engine. (Mind you, it might work great, but I'd doubt it.)   
---
My Oracle is ready
---
Thank you.
---
I play when I'm available.  If that's when the timer is up, then great - I'll be on the op.  But I'll never change my real-life plans to accomodate EVE's schedule.
---
I've had to bow out of SIGs because of this, and that's fine by me. I honestly see more action sticking close to home dicking around in standing fleet and joining defensive ops than I ever saw getting blueballed on some deployment.
---
\- Escalations can't be scanned, however as soon as you land on the acceleration gate, you can be scanned down by combat scanner probes. 
---
\- The sites will be a lot harder to complete than the stadard sites you are running. A lot of people keep a Rattlesnake sitting in their Alliance HQ to run the escalations, others just sell the site to friends.
---
\- When you say "is it worth it in terms of isk", that depends on you. If you're super ratting then dropping everything to go run the escalations prob isn't worth it. If you're VNI ratting and waiting on them then it could be a very good isk payout. 
---
\- "Is there anything I can do better" Look up some videos on smartbombing anoms. It can be a good way to farm escalations. Kills the site fast and has a good rate of dropping 6/10s - 10/10s
---
\- If you're trying to sell the site, follow your Alliance guidance. Typically you'll warp to the system, open Agency, click on the escalation and then "Warp to site". Once you get there you bookmark the gate, drag the location into your inventory, go to the nearest structure and contract it.
---
yeah that's what it's used for, not to blap frigates on gates or super rat in havens.
---
Hey at least I'm not vegan about it. Really honest here.
---
Tackling pods &lt;3
---
Hey, you know that way you enjoy playing the game?
---
It's fucking stupid.
---
I’d say also include Lord Razpataz &amp; Sir Tears from Devils but they also quit because fuck CCP and fuck carebears
---
This is Eve if somebody isn't profiting off of us then we all fucked up
---
The Gurista FOB rats work a bit differently. They all shoot only thermal missiles, so they are pure thermal damage. More info below:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Forward_Operating_Base#The_NPCs
---
I've got two of them.  Sitting in my hanger.  No idea where I acquired them.  Was a CCP giveaway a long while back I think.
---
You must be doing something wrong then.
---
You do not need to add the account to the launcher for the workaround to work.
---
Just start the game from the server list in the launcher menu, wait for the game to start and log in on the login screen.
---
It can't ask you for a code there.
---
Since, you seem to actually have a grasp on how this works, I have a question.
---
I believe CCP falcon once mentioned that the nodes are all single-core processes, so they aren't taking advantage of the multiple cores each server already has. Would it be possible for a game like eve to take advantage of multiple cores (cost of a back-end overhaul not withstanding)?
---
I met some of the coolest people ever playing this game. Some of them have left, but we’ve made a small community and we still play other games together. 
---
Your experience is familiar. Sadly a lot of new players will feel this way. Thing is, there is actually quite a lot to do for low sp toons, but if your mind is set on getting in some corps' doctrine asap then yeah things can feel like how you describe them.
---
Tbh, I wouldn't recommend a brand new player to get into pvp asap. You won't win frigate fights in fw and you won't feel useful in large fleets for quite a while. Instead focus on doing pve out of hs. You'll learn quite a lot of useful 'pvp' skills by just trying to not get killed, while making more than enough isk to plex your main account. Bonus points if you can find a group to do it with. Believe it or not, setting up a mining op in low sec can be quite lucrative and exciting for a group of noobs.
---
report brigade IG
---
Nice chart!  
---
One minor complaint.  Can you change axis labels to 'Tracking Bonus' and 'Range Bonus'?  If one is not careful, one may come away with an impression that Quake in artilleries gives you better tracking than Hail in auto-cannons...
---
Yep. This is indeed the case. The reason is that you refer to memory with an index that’s 32 bits long, this means you have 2^32 individual values of that index, which works out to 4gb. 64 bit can refer to 2^64 but typically only actually something line 2^48 or so because of hardware limitations. 
---
Interestingly I don’t believe there’s any x86_64 systems that can deal with over 2TB of ram
---
Thank you. This is really good info to have.
---
I first logged in in 2009, left a few weeks later, gave it another try 2011, same result. Long story short it’s 2019 and I still don’t have a single killmail to my name. Did many missions, some mining, some industry, even a stint in Stain, but that didn’t stick either so combined time I stare at skill queue on my phone is more than actual game time. I can’t seem to find a Corp that’s somewhere between comatose and military-grade efficiency. 
---
This was the first shitty thing I noticed coming back to the game after 3 years off. I was sat on the gate with my alt and saw my main instantly appear while staring at him still in warp on the other screen. I wonder what they broke to make this happen. 
---
I believe were currently on a "tri is dead" phase again.    Please check back in 3 months.    
---
And since, per Google stats, less than 2% of their users enable 2FA, these PSAs are pretty useless, until 2FA is enforced.

How much is the WH space populated by each class? I am not looking for a specific numbers, but would like to see which class is less populated and why. I know that C5 is probably the most populated space atm.
---
More particularly I am interested if the C4 space is the least populated from all, or is it opposite and it is most populated? I have heard that farming C4 is a pain and nobody's doing it. However I did give it a try and I was surprised (in a good way) with the results.  
---
Thanks! o7

Injecting straight to a Titan was never a problem IMO. Since SP is never generated from nothing, only by subscribed characters taking the time to train it, buying enough SP to inject into a Titan is the same as just buying a Titan pilot on the bazaar, which has always been an option. In fact, this method sees a considerable loss in total SP in the game - *at least* 20% of all extracted SP is destroyed. 
---
This SP coming from SP farms is a different issue, altogether, however.  
---
No such thing as 2FA provider. It implements TOTP standard and generates password based only on your token and current timestamp using math magic. Everything is contained in the device/app, no communication needed.
---
About two years ago, my brother and I made our first (of several) capsuleers.  We toiled away at figuring out how to play this amazing game. Mostly living in Hi-sec, trying out faction warfare, and mining Hi-sec ore to build our first lousy little ships. We decided we wanted to be Low-sec pirates and we would online our first structure, a raitaru we both saved up hard for.  
---
Our destination was Low-sec kador in the sechmaran system.  He flew the hauler, while I escorted in my prized VNI.  We got to our warp in and started onlining our would-be home.  All of a sudden he yells out "run run!" A group of ACTUAL Low-sec pirates were among us.  My prized VNI is lost along with all we had worked towards.  
---
Having familiarized ourselves proper space etiquette, GFs went out in local.  The pirates respond back with a generous opportunity to keep our structure anchoring and not shoot it because they see we are new.  After further light hearted conversation, we are given the opportunity to join and fly with this alliance as our own corporation. They would teach us their ways.
---
Fast forward two years and the brothers are now in corporation with their assailants in a new section of Low-sec, laughing on comms, planning IRL meet ups, and having the best time with their space friends despite their wives protests.
---
Note- sorry for the grammar and formatting, on mobile and typing this out while working.
---
I started Playing properly in 2009, got in a random chat channel with a guy who was doing low sec roams that anyone was welcome on. Being new and having no clue about FCing i joined and went on a few, chatted to him and here we are 10 years later still talking every day. On top of that I have about 3 or 4 other close friends who I talk to most days from EVE, we live all over but play games together all the time. EVE is the only game that has ever done this for me.
---
P.S. it turns out he was a shit FC and i ended up FCing and running his corp but hes still great friend. 
---
A-fucking-men.
---
My ex called Eve my "mistress #2" (1 was my car). My skipping out on early-morning weekend cuddle hours to bash wormhole sticks did not improve that perspective...
---
Definitely not making those mistakes with the current one.
---
Convert to a new engine to render better skins.
---
&gt;you seem to actually have a grasp on how this works, 
---
I should be clear - I've got a 20-year-old degree in computer-science and I read things. I'm making educated guesses on a LOT of stuff here, plus writing-out simplified versions while I'm avoiding doing my actual job. Don't take anything I write as gospel.  
---
One of the other things to realize is the developers who actually work on EVE are probably more knowledgeable and informed about game-mechanics and multi-threaded stuff than the VAST majority of the people on this forum. The random-ass suggestions that get posted here are worth, frankly, fuck-all, and you're all just wasting your goddamned time typing them out. (That said, I don't know what it says about me that I'm replying to them.) 
---
I get frustrated with TiDi and lag just like everyone else does, the devs are doing what they can given the time and money they have available.   
---
It's kinda like when you're a line-member in a big fleet op and you see a hostile ship out there that you want to shoot, but the FC isn't telling you to lock-and-fire. Do you know better than the FC? Should you smash your shout key and say "HAIY FC I HAZ TARGET!" There's a dozen reasons why you shouldn't.     
---
No CCP should just say they don't give account recovery support past resetting their password for hacked accounts that do not have 2FA enabled.
---
No SP reimbursement
---
No asset reimbursement. 
---
If people care so little for their account why should CCP? 
---
the music made this so good like damn
---
Thats an awesome story and I hope all goes well with the shop. Are you still playing EVE?
---
Mission and rats are what we are doing currently but we are really trying a bit of everything. 
---
Pulses are ez, just use scorch or multifreq
---
Beams on the other hand... Ideally you want to bring at least 4-5 types of ammo and who the fuck can quickly tell them apart when you right click your weapons to switch lenses.
---
Just to be clear -- Google Authenticator is just an implementation of a well-defined, publicly available One-Time Password algorithm. Specifically, [TOTP, defined in RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).
---
There is nothing about TOTP that requires any sort of "2FA provider". You could, in theory, implement TOTP as an entirely-offline, airgapped electronic circuit, assuming you had a way to input a given time, and either you baked the "secret" into the doodad or you had another way of inputting that when using it.
---
Heck, if you were really so inclined, you could sit down and work one out on paper. You'd probably want to plan ahead, though, and figure out a TOTP for a time interval a day or two ahead of time, because no human being can do this in anything approaching realtime.
---
Point is, though, nothing about TOTP involves any sort of "dialling home" or getting any data, or sending any data, to anyone, let alone Google. If you use Authy, you're not sending data to Google, if you use Win Auth, again, no data to Google.
---
Honestly, if you use Google Authenticator, you're *probably* not sending any data to Google either, because Google has no need for anything and if people thought Google were scraping people's TOTP secret keys, well, that'd be a PR disaster.
---
But, really, if you're worried, the best thing you can do is write your own little bit of code to calculate TOTPs for you. After all, you can trust your own code.
---
So... Can the Charon be hit by (smart)bombs.

If not I do not see a problem...

Try one of the giant ones.  Yes, it's probably not your perfect fit, but it will make it a lot easier for you to figure out what specifically you want in a corp.  And that specificity is what makes it possible to find the right one.

How about a damage cap that is very high and lowers as the max cap is sustained over 5-10 minutes (less for non sov/low adm) as if the shields are slowly hardened.  Then at the end of that time the damage cap drops and thew is no cap (at say 50 - 60% shields).  For there the armor timer there is a 1 minute or no "damage cap timer".  The hull timer gets no damage cap timer?

Half of Delve is still doing it. They are still not banned :(

The politics are supposed to be there to add weight and importance to the content, not be the be-all, end-all.  I'm right there with you in not wanting endless "gudfite arena" PvP for its own sake, but your leaders pretending they intended to blueball all along for the sake of maintaining your "winning all along" narrative is putting the cart WELL before the horse.  They asked for their members' time by bashing the fort twice and posting an op for the third, have the respect for them to either cancel in a timely fashion and/or give them an honest answer as to why that time was wasted.

Daily reminder that CCP do not give a fuck about fixing things or iteration. 
---
I know there is a point where gaming can take over and ruin it. But if your significant other breaks up with you because you plan something on Saturday morning or whenever, to have a good time with some internet friends. She was probably not right anyway.

Why did a GM say that it wasn't happening in a ticket we sent in during our incursion?

Legit issue, file for reimbursement. Until they fix this it's a massive tell for gankers where you're going to be.

Assemble your fleet, pirates!

Question. Is the ship considered landed and at that location by the other player? Like could the second account you have up start bumping the Charon and by the time your actual Charon landed it will kinda spawn you at the bumbed location? Or will it start getting bumped and when you land kinda fix itself back into the correct location?
---
18 seconds if we wanna be a little more accurate.
---
In before the haters flood in with the extra large down votes.
---
Then Eve blueballs would still be op success.  
---
Good idea.  
---
Another thing that CCP could do to stimulate 2FA among players - make more login reward campaigns and give items only if 2FA is enabled. Make those campaigns regular so less players will wan't to turn off 2fa after getting all rewards.  
---
There's also SWTOR way - they give you currency reward every month for enabled 2fa. It's just a nice small bonus, and in EVE something similar could be done with PLEX, skins or SP.
---
I would adivse against the noctis to new players. Any t1 destroyer is just as efficient with Salvage tackle rigs and 1/38th the cost. It moves and aligns faster as well. The only down side is that you will not be able to grab the loot from the MTU due to limitied cargospace, but most of it is not worth grabbing anyways and you can cherry pick the good stuff.
---
So why not have a option on the account management dashboard where it can be activated/deactivated. Skill extraction protection which requires 2FA code to enable/ disable and a 24 hour cooldown period....
---
Dont these guys know that c6 space is owned by the imperium?
---
Contact Sister Bliss ingame for cheap rates on all the most lucrative holes if you wish to rent from us.

Just further limited the pool of useful ships. Much balance

&gt; 18 seconds if we wanna be a little more accurate.
---
&gt; #fully landed
---
You see the blink from the corner of his other account at 48 seconds.  The docking request doesn't get confirmed until 1:16.  The tethering animation confuses this a bit but it starts even before he has fully stopped, and larger ships like freighters have a smoother and lnoger - at land - period before they're no longer invulnerable on grid. TL;DR It is more than 18 seconds.
---
First person I ever met in Eve, joined his corp. Had lots of fun in game. 3 years later I told him I was moving to Colorado. He asked what city and it turned out I was moving to his same city. We are now grilling buddies on the weekend. 
---
Met another group of friends in a WH. one thing led to another and we all went to Eve Vegas. Had a good time. We now visit each other in the US every once in a while. 
---
The salvage is much more valuable. In null space I drop 4 MTUs as , and after 4 sites I jump in my salvage dessy, make an additional 40-50m, then Nereus to collect the loot and make an additional ~20m
---
Tbh I'd totally accept damage caps if asset safety was removed. Fuck I'd even be cool with part dropping and the rest going to asset safety.
---
&gt; Is the ship considered landed and at that location by the other player? 
---
No, you can't lock it or anything.
---
Unrelated - why do your fonts look like ass?

Is it because of a poorly scaled image or do web fonts really look like that for you?

I joined a group in outer ring around 2012.  Having played the game for a long time before and known some cool people I really got to know my new group well.  Paramis, and Shauni Avellar were my two go to people.  We got to know one another quickly and it quickly grew to friendship.  Dota2, overwatch, and many other games were played.   
---
My wife and I got engaged about 4 years ago and we were sending out invitations and I included both of them on the invite list.  Knowing Shauni couldn't go because he lived in the EU and Paramis lived in western USA (I'm in the midwest).   But Paramis said she could make it so I was super excited!  Then the day she came to town and stayed with me she surprised me and brought Shauni with her!  He had flown in thanks to another eve friend buying him a plane ticket!   So I had my two greatest eve friends at my wedding!   
---
I still play with them in eve occasionally but we do play Dota2 all the time and we talk every day! 
---
They are anchoring a Keep in PB right now.  
---
Just give me a 30 second headstart to get my blaster boats on top of your ship before you even land on grid, cheers

Not only that with a POS you can force the timer to be reasonable for a majority of your dudes ( by putting it in a weekend )

When the content is so shit and boring in null you need to go to j space to blob and ruin it.

That's good friendships 
---
Can confirm, using a t1 thrasher as my salv ship and it works out just fine. Aligns pretty quick so I can easily pop in, snatch loot, hop out. As you said crago space isn't the best, but most of the time im able to haul the good stuff in one trip.

How dare you bring logic and common sense into this sacred place?!?
---
I don't think anyone believes we intended to blueball, and I don't recall leadership even saying that.
---
We all saw the dscan and knew we got out formed.
---
We might have even known we had a pretty decent chance of getting out formed all along.  Like I said before, y'all have the pings, so you know the earlier ping told us not to jump/death clone until told to.  If that isn't a pretty good indicator that leadership knew we might not fight, I don't know what is.

Don't try to make shit more than it is.  Most of Test was around for "Helldunks or Blueballs", so we understand that sometimes shit goes like this.

---
oh you're *that guy*
---
just use a note, far easier
---
Thank you very much for pointing me in this direction and the right stuff to read. I have to admit that I'm not very familiar with the technique behind all this and act out of a conservative stance toward big data.
---
Good bot
---
Are those even worth running? The website says you get a 30m payout for the kill? Why wouldn't you just run a single Lv4 mission or something?
---
I expect higher tiered shitposting from you
---
Google Auth app is pretty meh (no backup last time I used it). As alternative you could use Authy or FreeOTP (from RedHat). Authy stores codes on it's servers so it's no good if you are too paranoid.  For the last option you can even use Keepass\KeePassXC with OTP plugin and use it locally without connecting to anything.
---
Despide the wives protests haha yea all my friends have those problems luckily i don't 
---
A different commenter mentioned the agency tab. I'm assuming that that will lead in the right direction.
---
It's not cryostasis, it's just Canada
---
It's the supply of characters, like the price for perfect pilots in a particular ship has gone down because SP is easier to relocate. 
---
So while it's not a fundamental issue, it makes the issue's in balance a lot more visible because players can now react to a balance issue in days rather than months. 
---
For ECM usability. It has dropped significantly, only  point in having ECM anymore is to perhaps jam the logi   in large fleet battles. But do note that is not a very much used ship type/purpose even before.
---
For solo pvp it absolutely killed ECM use. No point in having it since your target can still lock you back.
---
CCP Basically used a nerfsledgehammer on it instead of just tweaking it with a scapel (no ship name pun intended) so its in a large way made the module type pointless. For fun, take a look at ECM mods in the market, think the fall in demand/prices tells you everything.
---
Shame, since a rebalance should fix a module type, be it too strong or weak, but applying a tweak that either makes it OP or useless, well that just goes past the point from one problem to another.
---
thanks, TIL.
---
Does this hold true for most/all of the t4s? I'm curious and want to try out the abyssal sites and I made up this exact fit but with 3 faction lse and 2 adaptives. Should I edit to 4 lse? 
---
&gt;If you are playing and seem to hate the fact that you are playing maybe change what you are doing, find some new people or a new play style instead of hating the game. There is still so much here to enjoy that you simply cannot find anywhere else.
---
So much this. Also, if you are really struggling, take a break. Digging the same rut just makes your experience worse. I always hear so many people making the mistake of letting arbitrary goals or play styles become so central and important that they just (by active intention or otherwise) spiral down a cycle of not having fun and feeling like they have to not have fun.
---
What about a pds? That should help with all things shield related, right? 
---
Everyone participating gets 30M, so it is definitely worth running in a fleet. There are some folks doing those regularly in Domis/Nestors and streaming on youtube. it is a great way to learn basics of flying with a fleet. 
---
Olololololol
---
What is a massaker?
---
What’s star citizen? I think he’s talking about an entirely new and novel idea that’s never been done before!
---
I can't believe how much money I've spent to participate in this beta test
---
&gt; Every alliance has people who complain about what happens on OPs and how things are handled, why this .1% of TEST complaining is suddenly a big deal I've no idea.
---
it's reddit sperg
---
basically propaganda for spodbrains
---
the problem the "bittervets" have is that ccp is excessively catering to people who take three year breaks and often don't come back from them
---
But if everyone in fleet ran a level 4 mission each theyd get even more at much less risk surely?
---
Have fun! Pro tip from a native:  Don't let anyone try to tell you where you got your shoes at!  ;) 
---
I am a perfect example of this. I appreciate that 3 years is a long break but when a game has been running for this long I dont think its  as long as it sounds. 3 Years ago I was bored and I am pretty sure I blamed the game for me quitting but here I am trying something new and thoroughly enjoying it all over again. Doing the same thing over and over for 10 plus years is going to get dull. 
---
Glad you’re back in EVE, OP, and enjoying the game. I think people sometimes forget that EVE *IS* a video game and they should be playing first and foremost to have fun, so I am happy to hear that you are. Keep it up
---
COD is very much not fun to me, and in terms of valuing real risk and skill Eve PvP is at the very top of the gaming world IMO. The average Eve player has so much knowledge and skill compared to the average player of most other games, regardless of whether they use any of it regularly.
---
that's stuff you can learn pretty fast really, don't get me wrong you won't be AT level but the concepts and execution are fairly simple, you just need to get introduced to them early. It wasn't uncommon seeying 2 weeks old players that got early into a good FW corp for example doing it. 
---
The bigger hurdles was more the need for an encyclopedic knowledge of hull bonuses, ammo types and all that crap to effectively use those tools however. 
---
&gt; If CCP doesn't integrate this
---
Game engines aren't the roof. They're the foundation, the brickwork and most of the windows.
---
Cheers, it feels real good to be back. And honestly I have my new corp and alliance to thank for allot of that, finding a fun active group really complements the game for me. 
---
&gt; 𝓢𝓮𝓭𝓭𝓸𝔀: For those of you who @ me and PM’d me **plan was to stand down to Ight** because they hyped it so much. Just wanted to make sure they got into system first
---
o7
---
This post might not do much for you, it sounds like you're already pretty set on your course here. This is probably more for the other newbies that are reading this and wondering "is eve for me?"
---
Most games nowadays are about constant, instant gratification and content. There's always something you can do that will either increase the power of your character, or use that power effectively against an opponent, be it npc or another player.  There's no wait, not a ton of work, its just instant and constant funfunfunfun, without anything standing in the way.
---
When you think about that vs eve, yeah man. Eve at times can be a lot slower paced, and DEFINITELY more work/effort/time then just joining a cod match and blowing people away, waiting the 3 minutes for your ARAM to start, queing for that mythic with your dk, finding that diamond vein to repair your shovel, getting to try your new secrets hunter against that armor quest warrior, etc etc etc...
---
But in all those other games, every single one of them, how much do you, WurmWhole, matter? And how much CAN you matter? Are you able to become known, and maybe feared, game wide? Can you force an entire geoup of players to literally stop logging in just by being around their space? Can you provide and enforce consequences, real, game making/breaking consequences on people that fuck with you? Can you create an engine, a dynasty, an empire that creates a haven for others you like, and terror and dread foe those you don't?
---
Not in those other games you can't. Not even close. You might be known as skillful. And thats the best that will happen. Most likely you'll just be another nameless, faceless dude on the screen.
---
The tradeoff is work, and effort. Yeah, you Got t put the time and effort into eve, and yeah, it can be boring, and tedious, and disheartening. And that might not be for you. If you're looking for a constant stream of instant gratificatiin, validation, whatever, go play fortnite, cod, minecraft, hearthstone, whatever. 
---
But if you want a chance to matter, to truly matter in a video game.
---
Come play Eve.
---
$$$
---
Yeah those names are mentioned in the conversation but it could be totally random people chatting about them. Do you recognize their names? Most people don't
---
It is hard to watch something you love deteriorate. People hate because they love, it is all the same. What players want to see is a real plan to get the game to where it should be, not what cool new visuals are being added. Sometimes is feels that CCP just goes for the short-term buck, knowing that rot will continue but unable to address it and keep the the company in the black. How much has been wasted on projects that aren't even EVE? Valkerwhatever and Halo+Grind? 
---
I just started playing after a 3 year break, even though I know I shouldn't, and the magic is still there. EVE is a masterpiece. But for fucks sake, focus on the core game and killing the rot before you tell me about how your dev team made the rocks look cooler.   
---
Come up with a plan that will work, a price that will cover it, and figure out how to make it work. If you need capital, figure it out. Crowd source it. Give me the option to buy 2 years of Omega and a collection of rare ships with the promise that the funds go to the rot-plan. The Devs and the Players care a lot about EVE, that is why the passions run red. Turn that passion into production rather than sorrow about how insurmountable the task seems. 
---
anyone who actually believes anything they read on reddit is too dumb to play eve
---
It must be really hard for CCP to cater to everyone though and the bittervets are already so bitter that I am not sure it would be possible to please them any more. CCP as a company needs to keep people playing and paying and the game needs new people to keep it fresh and interesting. I dont envy CCP at all, not many games companies have run games for this long in order to learn the correct way to do it. 
---
TRI is dead what are you talking about. 
---
&gt; For solo pvp it absolutely killed ECM use.
---
The only positive to come of the ECM rebalance imo.
---
That's alright. Although, I'm kind of curious -- given I'm going into software development professionally, soon -- What is big data, to you, exactly?
---
I mean you really dont have to be that smart to play EVE in the first place. Its as complicated as you want it to be. 
---
Besides the banter (which is fine), the eve politics gets to people sometimes. This is their venting place.
---
Ok.. that was a long video.. and instantly muted. That said, if they fixed the timing of it, I really am digging the BSG feeling of ships just poof appearing.
---
makes ECM ships worthless.
---
and ECM drones? honestly the only valid form of ECM left.
---
200 keepstars on a titan!
---
&gt; How much is the WH space populated by each class? 
---
Class 1-3 find alot of owners, while not highly requested, it usualy is the first step of an unexperienced Wormhole Corp. As they are easy to find and often provide K-Space statics you will often catch travelers in them aswell.   
---
C4s I find myself difficult to say, though they are probably among the least populated Wormhole Class. While they create a good amount of connections in form of 2 J-Space Statics, that also results in some traffic overall. You will probably have an easier time finding an unpopulated one with the statics and effects you like.  
---
C5-6 are mostly occupied, the option of capitals may be one reason for it.  
---
If you are planning on making money in a C4 I wouldn't suggest you use it as a primary standpoint, or at least use a C4 with C4 static, as you will be short on Combat Sites after a pretty short amount of time. An alternative would be a C2.   
---
o7 
---
Provided counterplay, working as intended now.
---
All the people hurfblurfing were people relying on ECM as a crutch to pvp. 
---
The only side casuality was jamming fighters. Which the meta is now just bring logi/defang or fly 100mn.
---
Your posting is bad and you should feel bad. You're still not even the worst posting member of wecu leadership somehow...
---
&gt;We might have even known we had a pretty decent chance of getting out formed all along. Like I said before, y'all have the pings, so you know the earlier ping told us not to jump/death clone until told to. If that isn't a pretty good indicator that leadership knew we might not fight, I don't know what is.
---
You're trying way way way too hard here.
---
burst jam still works 
---
Love you too
---
Nyx police skin? TAKE MY MONEY!
---
I think you don't know what I am talking about. It takes them less than a tick to take it down, depending on a number of pilots. There also is no risk with the number of pilots in the fleet their are usually doing it.
---
But the biggest part is experience of flying in the fleet, that you would never get with the missions. After all why do some people PvP and lose money, when they also could run those missions?
---
Because not everyone wants to do the missions. And there also are better options to get ISK, than do the missions.
---
\--EDIT: Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILlteh1namc)
---
adding more casual elements is a double edged sword. You bring in fresh blood but you also alienate the hardcore audience that originally came to the game. it's a delicate balance to achieve, and I'm not even sure if it's even possible.
---
How about no damage cap on anything, however there is an expensive rig that gives it a damage cap. Also requires fuel usage.
---
They live in low sec since their super and titan fleet got wiped out likely desperate for content in pb before disbanding completely.
---
Can't take space without supers. Can't get supers without space. They're finished
---
The answer to doing PI - don't.
---
All just a plot but the shadow masters sell police skins at a higher price
---
Longest beta test ever.
---
HELLO FROM THE OTHER SIIIIIIIIDE.
---
You have the edge of a bowling ball.
---
no it would be very easy to please the crowd that you got your success in the first place. We flocked to eve because it was a game about risk vs reward, where highly risky actions yielded high rewards. Now the highest rewarding activities in the game are the safest, and all of the players have no impetus to do anything but turtle up.
---
Interesting. Still, I doubt anything will come of it.
---
Ah, I was going by the tether animation.  Shouldn't that only happen when he's fully landed?
---
Not that any of this makes a difference.  18 or 28 seconds, either is an eternity.
---
It's just a bitter-hoarder-vet \[unproven\] method of maintaining one's wealth. 
---
I understand what your saying and I can see why people would get frustrated when CCP appear to be making changes to things that seem to not matter to the core audience. I also know that some things are imbalanced and broken ( I am looking at you Garmur ) but to a whole other set of people these new changes really improve their experience of the game, those mining changes to miners make a difference. 
---
If CCP raised the sub tomorrow I would not complain, I dont mind paying for skins and plex as it helps me and CCP but look at all the hate that skins and skin prices get. I think skins were a clever idea to boost income but a large section of the player base hate them. 
---
I dont think CCP are deliberately trying to hurt the game or avoid fixing things, I just think its probably way more complex a situation that we can know from the outside. 
---
I agree projects like Dust and Valkryie did not hit the mark, I played both and I didnt get on with either but you cannot blame CCP as a company for trying to make new stuff and make more money. They struck gold with EVE and I think we have to be thankfull that they formed the idea and executed the initial concept so well despite all the flaws over the years. 
---
And above is what's the difference between Panfam and TEST, Panfam resets for content and forms together against any external threat/objective, quite open about it too. Legacy and Imperium do exactly the same, apart from Legacy members going out of the way to claim being "strong independent coalition that needs no backup"
---
&gt;Unless you want to just rat/mine all day but calling that content is a bit of a stretch.
---
Trust me when I say that this is not supposed to be a jab at you but you guys are in the same coalition as TNT, LAWN and the bastion(well, and goons), you of all people shouldn't be surprised on this classification.
---
I think Snigg have done this before or something like it. Anyone have a br of what happened last time? 
---
BUT MITTENS.. WITH THE WIZARD HAT.. AT FANFEST! 
---
TL;DR stop being a hypocrite
---
The easily amused go through life happy mr killjoy. 
---
No, first goons, then PL, then goons again. So, not continuously I'd say.
---
There is alot of PvP Corps out there. As there is many different types of PvP I would personaly just jump around in a few Corps. Give a few of the larger ones a try, maybe in different spaces (HiSec PvP, LowSec PvP, NullSec PvP and WH PvP are all different in themselfs and only share a few similarities). I am sure there will be one you will enjoy the people in and running with them. :)   
---
I have had regular PVP across all scales from the first day I came back until this morning. Every night has been different and some have been busier than others but honestly the action is still there and people are happy to fight. 
---
Now do a third axis for the damage multiplier! (: 
---
 It is a nice overview though, I just felt compelled to post this old graph that I used when I started learning ammo types
---
https://i.imgur.com/GkoeS3I.png
---
I can appreciate that, EVE politics can really suck you in which in itself is an amazing achievement for a game. The levels of player interaction across this game are unparalleled. All that said vent about the politics, tell the stories dont flame CCP and hate on the game that gives you them. 
---
Plex used is still plex used. Somebody paid for it. Demand for plexes on the market makes its isk value. more value =&gt; more incentive for people to pay $ for plex.
---
An Astarte with rails doing ~900dps at 27km optimal usually surprises people.
---
I just miss some of the old meta's. I understand things change. Doesn't mean the nostalgia goes away. 
---
Once you start having to warp around, the harb loses a lot of its value
---
Where do you get this koolaid? 
---
Precisely, I do think CCP are trying to work stuff out that most devs have never really had to deal with on this time scale. 
---
So much this. Some people like spreadsheets and playing the market, some people like staring at rocks all day, some people like the grand space opera of nullsec politics, and I just like to drink well past the point of excess and die in glorious fire. There's something for everyone!
---
I'm not playing, and I'd really like to know what meds you're taking, that you actually think this game is fresh or interesting. I came back a few months ago because someone was trying to access my accounts. The game looks like crap in 4k. The same old bugs exist that existed 4 years ago, and low sec is a complete deadzone. I spent weeks dumping ships in Amarr, giving away crap, so that if someone does get into my accounts, they'll be worthless.
---
This game was already on it's deathbed when CCP was forced to make it FTP. FTP games depend on a huge player numbers to generate income, and this game doesn't have it. 
---
But I'm sure you think CCP selling out to some SK company is a good sign...right?
---
CCP alt detected?
---
PvP meathead mad that everyone in the game isn't also a PvP meathead.
---
C'ya.
---
First time on Reddit?
---
Skins are fine. I think cosmetics are always a great way to let people show love to the game. They need more easy to implement income generators. 
---
I don't envy the problem CCP has. EVE is insanely complex. And EVE is much better than it used to be in many aspects. But how do you justify trying to solve problems nobody really understands and won't translate directly into sales? I think if they could take what they know and build EVE2, with the ability to port over all the data, so they have a clean base to work from, that would be ideal. Too bad it is probably impossible.  
---
oh yes the big skills necessary to fly a titan, truly pressing that one button every hour or so and only moving and deploying it under your super umbrella is very taxing indeed
---
I'm sure it's nothing
---
Utterly enthralling prose. I will have to add it to my English class' required reads.
---
&gt;in terms of valuing real risk and skill Eve PvP is at the very top of the gaming world IMO
---
Right, and it's the same story with metagame and politics.  No other game has that the way Eve does, certainly not D&amp;D.
---
I'm not going to deny that there is a certain amount of immersion I enjoy in Eve.  It's not quite role playing, but the fact that I'm in the middle of a story is pretty cool to me.
---
I can just sit on comms and listen to Sappo tell old Test stories for hours.  What other game has that?
---
Nah I lurk a lot just bored af, friends liked it said I should post it lol.
---
Your friends probably had context.
---
Reddit hates everything. r/eve especially hates everything because most of the people on it are in shit tier alliances or like low/highsec.
---
Better content than PGL's giving me rn TBH
---
Hey, I like Low sec.
---
EVE 2 is a true dream, I do wonder if it will ever happen. 
---
As stated, 2FA. Use it on everything that allows it. 
---
Maybe they should. Or maybe they should step away for a bit. Most of my engagements are not solo either, mostly 5-80 man fleets using frigs to caps, A real mix of everything. I am pretty sure anyone can enjoy that if they truly do enjoy the game. 
---
It won't free up ressources that are important anway. it won't do much for their Email accounts either. I mean, give me free SP, I won't say "take them back" but the actual effect this would have would probably be smaller than expected and generally underwhelming.
---
You’re letting the vocal bitchy minority affect you. /r/eve is an echo chamber of bitchbaby bullshit. my advice is to take the elite tryhard crybaby posts with a grain of salt.
---
God forbid people grow and change 
---
If you’re a member of an alliance, ask someone in your new member help channel for help selling or running them.
---
Since you’re VNI ratting, I’m guessing you got a 6/10 or 9/10 based on which anomaly you ran. Even those require a specialized and expensive ship and good skills, so you’re better off selling a bookmark to that site for someone else. The prices are also likely institutionalized. 
---
Please find cases of me using ECM outside the alliance tournament. ECM has always been the worst E-war by far except for maybe TDs (but they're generally coupled with neuts). It was used by bads to kill bads and occasionally to mess with logis. ECM was a bad mechanic, but it was balanced. Now ECM is a bad mechanic and underpowered, so it's likely to eventually be on the receiving end of some buffs which which will make it a bad mechanic and overpowered.
---
What about when you find out that most of the wealth of the current biggest alliances is based on lies and rule dodging using botters and rmters as in-game income/profit?
---
uh, congrats on killing a dreadnaught? 
---
Eve is a far cry from what it was. Sorry. But it's rolling down the hill faster than ever with its rubbish mechanics, pay2win, loot box rubbish.. But it's all about perspective. I want the hardcore game I signed up to. Fact of life is that things change and companies like ccp are there to make money not cater to a niche. 
---
You shut your mouth. The harbinger is a beautiful roadkill-chicken and I won't hear any words to the contrary.
---
I came back after a long break as I said. I now live in low sec with a smallish alliance with max 80 man fleets although thats not the regular. I have fights using all sorts of ships in low sec every night. Its about the same level of activity as I experienced back in 2009. 
---
I have done null, I have done WH and I have done High Sec War decs. As far as I can tell all of that stuff is still as active as it was before I left ( bar the war dec changes which I have not looked into ) The game looks great to me although I am not really here for the graphics more the gameplay and social side. I dont think I have run into many bugs at all, especially old ones. I think you were looking in the wrong places or maybe it just wasnt your game or your time to come back. 
---
It sucks that you dont like it anymore but why are you here on R/EVE responding to a thread like this if you feel like that? 
---
THIS IS EVE
---
Hey we have a lot in common. I think EVE made me an alcoholic. 
---
ECM was always complete trash compared to damps for any competent group, or any situation involving more than 10 people on grid. The only place it excelled in was for ganking supers/carriers, risk averse ganks and low skill level players.   
---
EC-300's were probably the most aids mechanic for solo, feels good MJDing on top of a smoothbrain Orthrus only for his EC-300s to permajam you and he gets away after the 15s+ it takes for his undeveloped brain to turn on MWD again, now at least they only waste time for 5 seconds. instead of RNG hell jamming you 20s+, it's also cool that it removed a lot of trap cancer fits too. It was just awful gameplay for both parties, ECM pilot is a literal stunbot, and the jammed pilot could do nothing, and it's RNG.   
---
I think CCP needs to bring more mechanics back to ECM like allowing them to remove all locks from drones/fighters. (It's not like you can make a case of horrible gameplay experience for them as rise mentioned at vegas) would make blops hunting carriers/supers much more possible and reasonable again. 
---
Do you get to lay the pipe while you watch Gossip Girl? 
---
Then bring it on!
---
I mean sure, there were indicators.  That's part of why it's so stupid for your leadership to even pretend the plan was to stand down.
---
Its fine, skin sales are up
---
Lmao give it a few more months
---
You’ll survive most of the time, until you don’t when rng open palm slams 5-6 Starving Shaks into your site. You don’t really need that second adaptive, especially since Abyssal sites have a low tank test requirement. Your DPS output is much more important because it’s your primary limiter in how fast you can run the site (gotta beat the timer) AND removes incoming damage.
---
Its no more pay to win than it ever was. You can pay to get stuff but that far from guarantees you win. Its usually pay to make someone elses day. I am not sure what you are referring to with the loot box comment, maybe I have missed something. 
---
Eve is still the game you signed up for but it has had to change to stay alive. EVE really is what you make it. 
---
No context needed if you are a memer "It's over 9000!!!"
---
Chat server memes aside, this is a bug that is bad enough to actually consider rolling back the changes until it is properly fixed IMHO
---
Ignore the space boomers, and remember:
---
Less QQ more Pew Pew
---
Isnt that part of the intrigue and the politics. I mean that mirrors real life really closely does it not? I am not really involved in the null politics but the scamming, rule breaking and politics make for interesting reading and other than feeding us the occasional kill I rarely have any interaction with the major alliances. 
---
This, I always keep spares. Same for overview. 
---
Not really, tri will always return
---
I think I may just avoid it going forwards. 
---
He won't.
---
Nice try Falcon alt. 
---
But j/k, you’re right. I’m tired of reading about how CCP doesn’t care for this or that, or about how the game is dying/dead.
---
I’ve been playing for about a year and a half, and there are still amazing and new things I find every day. 
---
Yea, if you call your super best friend pals "Daddy."
---
Space boomers is an amazing phrase. 
---
I mean I have been here before. I played for a long time before my break. 
---
\&gt; Like the way its marketed sounds like its something I need to buy to even think about trying the game, 
---
Not at all. You can get a pretty good feel for a lot of the different types of things you can do in the game as an alpha clone (i.e. not paid), all the way from station trading to mining to doing some basic stuff in nullsec. Having a paid sub means you will be able to do more things on the same character, and do those things a little bit better, though.
---
\&gt; such as Training skills faster and unlocking unlimited skill queue (which i don't fully understand)  
---
Training skills in this game is totally different from other MMOs. Your skills train in real time whether you're playing the game or not; you say "I want to learn Spaceship Command III" and you come back some number of real hours later and you've learned that skill (even if you were logged out the whole time). You can queue up skills which is useful if you have many low-level skills you want to learn in succession (as sometimes the training can take minutes instead of hours), but on an unpaid account you can't have a skill training start more than 24 hours in the future, forcing you to log in more often if you don't want to waste time where your character isn't learning a skill. On paid accounts you have an effectively unlimited skill queue, so you could set up stuff to train for months at a time.
---
\&gt; and unlocking all of the ships, like what does that even mean do I all of a sudden get all of the ships or do I just have access to build them? 
---
You can unlock most Tech 1 ships (everything up through battleships) on an unpaid account. You do not automatically get the ships (you still have to acquire those through the in-game economy) but you will have the skills necessary to sit in the ship, undock, and do things with them.
---
You sure me and you are playing the same game? 
---
&gt; All i seem to see is negativity, 
---
Where you see negativity, I see passion, because as you say, there is nothing else like EVE on the market.
---
oh, I didn't see the spin counter at the bottom
---
That's what I've heard as well, that C4s are least populated. I am currently living in a C2 with C3/HS statics. It has been great, both from getting W-space experience and ISK making standpoints. However I am looking to moving to a higher class, due to several facts, one being that my current system is not the best option, even for C2 space. And with HS static I find myself living in the middle of central station a lot of times. So with the decision made to move elsewhere, I am trying to make a choice between moving into a better C2, or moving to a C4 (with C4/\* statics). I was looking for an opportunity to farm C4 for a while, and yesterday I gave it a try for the first time and I liked it a lot more than farming C3s.
---
Yeah I'm gay for this post. Hit the head on the nail tbqh. The one that really hit home was the part about how 99% of the player base would be devastated, and that people who stumble across this sub sees a lot of cancerous spewing neckbearded edgelords that want the game done their way. Kinda just like star wars fanbois. Just like in life, Eve doesn't always go the way you want it. Haters gonna hate.
---
If you’re a native why would you not go to this :thinking: 
---
Or at least join our Discord?
---
It's not specific to Eve  - MTG has the same problem. The amount of time people spend bitching about changes to the game. Not to say that some of their complaints don't have merit, because particularly in the last few years, they have made some balancing mistakes, but pretty much every set release, you get the spoiler, someone complaining about it being the end of all magic as we know it, then the set comes out, the card they say is OP usually ends up being nothing particularly special and it dies down. 
---
Personally, I hate people who rail on the developers for a game because often its not them who are the problem. People spew all this hate at them for doing something which was decided on by someone well above their level, and frequently executing it to the best of their ability, even if they know its not actually a good idea (SWBF2 Loot Boxes for example - I doubt many devs thought it was a good idea, but if the CEO comes in and says "I want you to code loot boxes", you don't get a lot of flex to say no).
---
Bet you could open a cyno on the phantom ship and try to jump in a bump-fax to send it for a ride as it lands
---
Looks at r/eve mods ... [well we're waiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0YIJQ1jgEI) 
---
&gt;thinking i'm in test
---
come on, you know better than that.
---
it has never been a secret that test and goons are friendly, and will gladly be even friendlier just for the sake of shitting on pretty much any entity in the north. i have no idea where you got the idea that it was some kind of secret or people pretended that wasn't the case.
---
Don't worry guysy, the money from Pearl Abyss buyout is what they need to fix the game!!11!11!!    
---
\-half of the tards on this forum a few months ago
---
I understand that most of the hate comes from passion but that still sucks as a way to represent that passion. I guess its the reddit way. 
---
Okay, this is epic. Must be a slow work day if you're lingering around on a subreddit of a game you don't play or like. 
---
Never.. change is bad.... I love it when I do the same things over, and over, and over, and over, and over..
---
I think so. I mean I am happy to listen to the pay to win and loot box arguments. 
---
&gt; No other game has that the way Eve does, certainly not D&amp;D.
---
Gonna totally disagree with you. As an avid player and GM D&amp;D can reach complexity EvE cannot. EvE politics are actually usually very simple. D&amp;D literally has all of the complexity of human interaction that EvE can but an infinite space to exist in. Eve is constrained by the game pretty heavily. You can't go off and start taking down the Amarr empire, for instance, and insodoing piss off a ton of players who REALLY love Amarr ships - which are now no longer produced. The game mechanics of eve are more limiting than any D&amp;D universe we can create, and I'd argue that even having thousands of players contributing to events, you only ever really have a few, or dozens, contributing to the political landscape in a meaningful way.
---
This is even more true in the current era, where most people are in a handful of alliances with clear and seemingly permanent allegiances. There is less incentive than ever to go take space from people, and in general the playerbase doesn't want conflict very much. Ships that used to be hugely expensive and important (titans and supers, primarily) are so common now that killing even a dozen of them is no more than a week-long story on Reddit (the Tri move op was little more than a footnote after a few days). There are fewer and fewer opportunities for player actions to escalate in a butterfly effect. 
---
Perhaps the reason you love to hear Sappo tell *old* TEST stories is because there are vanishingly few *new* ones.
---
The game was dying in 2009, I am sure its been dying every day on some forum ever since but here we are. 
---
I think it's mostly that what made the game appealing to people that started before 2105 has completely changed.
---
&gt; elite tryhard crybaby posts 
---
My advice would be not to assume he's talking about the "elite tryhard crybabies," as you put it.  Nice attitude - "someone is upset with /r/eve - it must be at people I personally don't like! No reflection needed!"
---
Comet Police Roams &gt; *
---
Drones are usually bad at picking their fights, they usually don't care if you are webbed or pointed. Of course you could afk your standard 100MN VNI, but combat sites like Havens have ewar rats like pointing/webbing frigs, which need to go first in order to stay prepared for neutrals entering the system, and to generally avoid PvE related fatalities. Second on the list would be those employing sensory ewar, also just in case neuts come in.
---
It's kind of tedious to target manually in a site where you lose locks every few seconds, so the autotargetter reacquires targets lost by ECM/Dampeners (Guristas/Serpentis). That allows you to redirect your drones on a single target, which is also needed, since drones often like to split up even with focus fire.
---
People literally just want the game balanced, exploits (eg botting) somewhat fixed, and game breaking bugs fixed.
---
CCP does not do this and so people get upset.
---
It’s not like it’s just some randoms who don’t know shit complaining either (there is a lot of that), even Chessur quit who defo knows what he’s on about.
---
&gt;This SP coming from SP farms is a different issue, altogether, however
---
How is that different from people training up pilots just to sell on the Bazaar?  The only difference is really QOL.
---
Yeah it seems like a weird thing to do with your time. Unless you secret love the game, want to come back but dont know how too. 
---
I use ecm alot, not because i liked it, because it was broken and it was easy to abuse, most of my dudes had ecm alts for blackbirds. Before it was op and had no real counterplay, we could bring 2 10mil cruisers and completely shut down 3-4 ships of whatever cost. 
---
It isnt as good now ofc, but its far from underpowered. Now we’re vulnerable if we dont keep the bbs at range and it makes ecm a much more active playstyle, as before we just set alts to orbit target at range and apply jams, now it requires alot more attention.
---
I like C3's for solo farming. I still have more testing to do but I'm finding I can clear two C3 sites (solo rattle) in the time it takes to clear one C4 site (duel boxing Nestors). My corp lives in a C4 with a C4/C3 static. That gives us the ability to roll our C3 static until we find a good one for ratting. I also like not having a k-space static as it makes an eviction attempt less likely (it can still happen). 
---
&gt; I cant imagine how bad it feels as a CCP employee to see the community react so negatively to everything 
---
Maybe they shouldn't have taken 10 months to make a statement about the chat being fucked, but it's just me.
---
What are the game breaking bugs? I hear that a lot but I am not sure exactly what its referring to. 
---
I dont think i replied to your comment? I have no need to find situations where you used ECM, nor do i consider you someone who needs it as a crutch for their ability to pvp.
---
You can argue the mechanics all you want. Yes, they were RNG and COULD be weak if RNG rolled in your favor. But they were imbalanced by no counterplay on 2 fronts.
---
1. No matter how you piloted, you could do nothing to an ECM ship once jammed through your own skill/tactics. Unlike damps, tds, neuts, webs etc.
---
2. Even when fitting your ship with direct counter modules (ECCM scripted SEBO, sig amp or Sensor strength implants), you will still get jammed by some blackbird or griffin at a critical point and die. 
---
If a SEBO or sig amp gave me nearly full jam resistance, id be fine with the previous mechanics. But they dont. The SEBO/sig amp method only semi-worked on battleship or hulls with high base SS. You could never build a frigate to be jam resistant, as its base SS was too low and those mods were all % based.
---
Now, fast ships can counter jam ships and still tackle/damage them if they can catch them. Large ships still benefit from a SEBO and can hit any ECM ship foolish enough to be in range. ECM ships can still get the same level of ganking solo ships by being out at 70-100km (unless theyre ganking a cruise missile ship). It just requires actual piloting, but all the ECM pilots instead just want to cry about actually getting countered now and they cant afk orbit someone anymore on their alt.
---
CCP's forums are shit, and for the longest time the devs etc were more active here than the 'official' channels.
---
when this place was the best place to come to to give your feedback to ccp, does it really surprise you this is where people come to point out all the shit that needs fixing?
---
besides - i've said it before and i'll say it again. when shit needs fixing, people will tell you. when shit's working they'll be busy playing your game.
---
Like restaurants, man. I don't give good restaurants good reviews - i give them repeat custom instead.
---
I cant be alone in finding it appealing as someone who started playing 10 years ago. In fact I know from my alliance that I am not. 
---
I'm sad I'm gonna miss it, heading back to Alabama today :(
---
Hahaha.
---
Most people I've stumbled upon so far in eve is pushing grandpa, and is either waiting to get pinged for a fleet or doing some sort of half assing in any capacity, dropping jokes circa 2005 in local repping their facebook tier character bios, all while smug about their time in Eve a decade ago. 
---
Feel free to use it. 
---
This is literally the worst propaganda I've ever seen.
---
Not when CCP and the players just shift the blame on each other while they put a band aid over it. Major alliances don't wanna deal with it so they just let the bots do it while pocketing the money. CCP bans small fish bots while asking the player base to not rmt. 
---
You do have a point there but then there are ways to point out issues aside from calling out the devs for being useless or not caring on a daily basis. 
---
Strangely, you can use T2 tackle but not T2 sensor booster on alpha due to the skills required.
---
Didn't know what Quadstick was Very Cool Congrats
---
I would like to see skins for fighters.
---
Do you think thats down to every single CCP employee? I love the game these people make and maintain and I am sure thousands of others do as well. I want those devs to see positive messages and feel good about what they have accomplished in the past and continue to accomplish. Eve has given me friends that I have had now for a third of my life. Its has made a very real impact on my life and that is thanks to some talented and much under appreciated people who seem to get nothing but hate. 
---
I know its difficult to find where to direct your anger but there are better places and better ways of doing it that do not damage the game, the community and the morale of the dev team. 
---
you say that - but that seems to be what works.
---
we cry loudly about bots, suddenly we're getting periodic team security devblogs.
---
we cry loudly about chat, suddenly they're looking in to rolling it back.
---
loud crying gets their attention.
---
My point was that Python has become a forest of incompatible versions and libraries.  The language is inherently broken even before you consider the global interpreter lock.
---
I think they can also drop faction citadel mods, plus whatever t1 citadel mods are generically fit to these.  
---
Yeah I suppose you're right. 
---
I read the last Kotaku article on Eve and it got me to interested to log in and check it out again. Started in 2008, played daily (eventually multiple accounts), stopped cold in 2010, and now playing catch up. So many questions...
---
- what are alpha and omega clones?
---
- where are the go-to online resources these days?
---
Logged in last night and took my cane out for a look see in lowsec (just where I was). Almost lost it to a Serpentis rat (I had offline turret in a group, so no guns would fire). Clearly fittings have changed some as I couldn't fly fittings I had.
---
&gt; There is nothing about TOTP that requires any sort of "2FA provider". You could, in theory, implement TOTP as an entirely-offline, airgapped electronic circuit, assuming you had a way to input a given time, and either you baked the "secret" into the doodad or you had another way of inputting that when using it.
---
Sounds suspiciously like these Yubikey OTP token generators they issue us at work.
---
i started a corp when i played it at like 13 years old, got some members, left for a year, and when I came back they invited me to a fleet op and immediately gunned me down for no discernible reason. 
---
that’s friendship, right?
---
dude...
---
It's just humans being human.
---
When something someone is devoutly passionate about changes or becomes at risk of changing or dying or what haveyou, that someone is going to get furious at the decision makers who brought about those changes and/or death.
---
As well, it is an unfortunate reality that people are far more willing to voice negative opinions than positive ones.
---
But I'm still quite happy with the game, warts and all. 
---
Bitchy minority + plus dwindling subscriber count even after going "Free to play" is not a good sign for this game. 
---
Well the main fotm is chat not working for many people
---
for $900?
---
1 month player here, what is rot?

It probably feels worse as an employee to see your fellow devs fired and way too much work piled onto you.
---
No it isn’t and no it hasn’t.
---
I played Eve with friends IRL and it was really fun doing baby mining ops as lowbies in ventures and a T1 hauler, totally ignorant to everyone and everything outside of our little experience. Unfortunately only I stuck around out of everyone else, and although I took a break after a while I came back. Still struggling to find that new group and to be apart of something that matters but I'm patient and still having fun my own way. 
---
I'd say lately I've been contracting all my abyssal loot and mission salvage to one guy (I usually send him a to and from contract so that both ways he's earning). There was no reason why I specifically selected him but he send me mail saying how appreciated he was with the constant business (spamming Abyssal helps) and I thought it was a pretty cool personality of a game full of faceless ships. I also see a MTU Hunter thats quite famous and I like to wave at him, and follow in his footsteps. 
---
Oh and I'd hate to admit it, but I've killed the same CODE. guy over and over and he seems cool with it, so I'd like to say we're practically best friends now. It's fun that he's not a spaz about it, as usually CODE players (from my perspective) get as assblasted as those who they are ganking if you pop their goodies. 
---
No kidding. I've lost ships in half that time.
---
Guess it depends on whether you think you’ll stick around.
---
If you’re starting a new character, Omega will really only let you train faster through the basics.
---
If you’re using your old character, you might find a lot of the fun stuff is locked behind the Omega wall, or you can’t add new skills without using an injector.
---
The new character tutorial is much better and you can at least get a few hours in relearning things and working out if you’re back to stay a while or not..
---
I think this is drifting into the realm of actual fraud 
---
you justify it by taking pcu graphs to the strategy team and telling them that they need to solve qualitative issues to stop the slide, because at some point squeezing more from less stops working and you die
---
I suspect, however, that they already did that. and were denied. and this is the doomed timeline 
---
I am definitely back to stay i guess I have t figure out which race and what ships I wanna focus on 
---
Eve has been built layer upon layer upon layer. Now it's giant jumbled mess of code that magically holds together like minmatar supercap. So when they change things, like chat, unexpected consequences occur. Eve has a lot of really old problems which refused to go away because they're buried in this Legacy code which no one can really interact with efficiently. and because players have been building their own resources inside this code for a decade there's no way to just wipe the slate and start again. 
---
So essentially this old code is rotting. 
---
I cant upvote this hard enough
---
What if someone forgets their container password?  Oh, just petition CCP.  What if said someone was a hacker?
---
Don't forget being in the warp tunnel for like 30 seconds after you actually land on grid and people can start shooting you.  
---
It's almost like when a company does bad things their customers get mad at them. Mind blown.
---
True, but if you look at it from a different perspective, you might find farming C4 is better option than C3.   
---
First of all, I switched from rattles to Domis. Dualbox Domis can run  **Fortification Frontier Stronghold** in 7 mins (that was my best time). Cheaper than Rattle, still very effective.
---
Now with the C4 site taking twice more, you can also get twice more ISK from a single C4, than what you get with C3. Which means you spend less time re-rolling statics to get same amount of isk. I don't know how big your corp is, but more people means more re-rolls to keep everyone happy, isn't it?
---
No harm in starting a new account or two.. it’s common to have a couple of Alpha accounts in addition to your Omega account..
---
The new player experience is way better than it used to be and a lot has changed the last few years.. start a couple of alphas and see what you think..
---
I live in Colorado now, otherwise I'd roll on over for a drink
---
You can swipe your credit card and be in a Titan in an hour.  Thats what people are mad about.  You used to have to train/grind into a titan for literal years.  It cheapens the experience.  
---
So much like real life?  Almost no one actually plays by all the rules?
---
Nothing personal, but you've been gone 3 years, what the fuck do you know? Lol. 
---
You weren't here when Aegis (Aka Fozzie sov) turned sov warfare into a cancerous game of catch the interceptor. This was despite the extremely vocal majority telling CCP before release that it would be an issue. Then iircc it took them 4 weeks to patch that, and probably 6 months after that to reduce the node spawns and fix decay rates. For anyone participating in sov warfare during that time it was a giant pain in the cynabals that took an unnecessarily long time to make minor adjustments to.   
---
Then there was the Citadel expansion. Faction warfare was dealt a final blow bc who cares about who controls a station in system when you can anchor as many citadels as you want and bypass the entire mechanic... All security space saw a spam of structures without limits to the number that could be anchored. All with 3 timers, dps caps, even if they were unfueled, and very small vulnerability windows... This didn't change for probably a year (on mobile at work, could give exact dates later).  
---
And we got the  Arms Race expansion, creating a level of Eve Play for Free. The launch itself was great, lots of new activity and player signups. But it was the same new player experience Eve has always had (shit). The activity numbers quickly fell off. Only now, a year or so after the hype from play for free has gone away, is the new player experience getting any polish.   
---
Related, the wardec system, long maligned by the player base for years, was actually looked at. The numbers proved how devastating it is to new players and corps and their high likelihood to *abandon the game entirely* after being wardec'd.   
---
It was all a wasted opportunity.
---
Oh, and the Alliance Tournament? CCP decided not to officially support or devote any resources to it this year, bc fuck those guys that take this game so seriously. A few heroes from CCP lent their time to help the community volunteers over at EVE-NT (am i crediting these guys right?) to make the AT happen at all this year.  
---
These are just a couple hot buttons of the top if my head over the past couple years, there has been more.  
---
So please, when you want to complain about the sea of negativity you find yourself in, take a look around at the yellow water, and don't let any get in your mouth when you open it...  lol.   
---
A minority here might be super serious about their CCP hate, the rest of us have just been disappointed so many times we expect the worst and hope for the best, which reflects in our posting.
---
you assume the average player is able to make a safe, you'd be sadly surprised.
---
The damage caps could actually be a content creator as it would mean that even subcap defence fleets were viable. But ccp seems to be going the safe route to appeal to a mass market
---
the backlog of issues that have been around for years and never solved
---
modules getting stuck cycling/unable to cycle, ui elements breaking, desync with like 30 people on grid, cloaks turning off for literally no reason, probe window bugs, wormhole collapse bugs, fleet status bugs, chat bugs, launcher bugs, industry window bugs, markets breaking... all things that are just wearily tolerated because they never get fixed and so we despair that they ever will
---
The casuals don't stay though, because there are FAR superior casual games out there. 
---
I think OP is referring to the very aged code base, and perhaps the aged player base.
---
CCP has changed, but it sure isn't growing.   If they put the money they pissed away into even ONE of their failed projects (and the count is staggering at this point), the game could be in an incredible place again.
---
Instead, they seem content to go full retard chasing fads and the quick buck.
---
I kind of wonder if their office mascot is unironically the "This is Fine" dog
---
There is no rot, just a few gameplay changes some don't like.
---
do you have evidence to support this claim or are you just making shit up? real question
---
Gotcha. One more question if you don't mind. Is it worth throwing in the c3-x bcs in the lows? I got a bunch during the event. They're hybrid drone damage and ballistic control mods. Or maybe 2 ddas and 1 c3-x bcs? It sounds like a damage control with 2 ddas isnt optimal.  I was also considering 2 ddas and a pds for cap/shield/regen
---
Lowsec is where its at
---
^ this also. 
---
given how moving the chat to aws has worked out, thank the lord Bob Eve can't use them for its main gameplay
---
1) Don't allow container PW resets if you're recently changed your account password or email
---
2) Someone suggested below, require account info (credit card number, real name &amp; address, etc) given during account creation in order to recover a container. 
---
3) Optional, and wouldn't help everyone, but you could require a 1-3 day wait on any reset request. This is highly inconvenient for anyone who canned their pvp hangar and forgot the PW, and won't help people on vacation with no internet, but for people who would notice a compormised email in &lt;24h, is still protection. (Most hackers can strip everything on an account inside of 20 minutes; 24h is enough time to stop a lot of their operations.) 
---
Option 3 would be a pretty easy configurable setting; similar to the default unlock time, do you want a petition timer (or disallow petitioning for a PW reset entirely). 
---
1. Omega is not necessary for new players - you have 5.5 mil skill points left to train without Omega - and after that I would recommend Omega. I bought Omega on sale (Starter/Alpha pack or something like this) for my account just to experience what it's like - and after 1 month expired, I concluded it's not really the time to be regular OMEGA. Only thing as new player I gained from Omega was learning skills 2x faster.
---
2. Why would you join a corp if you are new? I never joined any corp (9 months old account), enjoying my solo missions life. Maybe because I don't like to be told what do it - either in my real life or EVE life.
---
You should look at your post, then into a mirror. Perhaps you are one of them elite tryhards, you just haven't realized.
---
A quick list from memory:
---
1. warp in animations not showing, 
---
2. Local/Corp/Alliance chat being a dice roll in functionality. 
---
3. rorqual panic not showing if you left grid during panic timer.
---
Then there is a host of balance issue that makes it basically pointless to go out and get a fight. 
---
Haven't they supposedly been removing the dependence on the spaghetti and making one system at a time more independent? Then they can delete pos code and have something workable?
---
As a nonprogrammer that was my understanding 
---
You sound like a baby back bitch right now.. 
---
I still kept up with EVE and I am here now dealing with those mechanics. FW is fine, it was never really about system control for most people it was about a good way to get fights. What you think is broken is not broken for a large amount of people. 
---
I'm sure that this "few months" will finally be the ones that do Eve Online: Noted Space-Themed Spreadsheet in. Yep. Definitely. Not like all those other "few more months" going back 15 years.
---
It has in fact been dying since 2003: https://nosygamer.blogspot.com/2014/07/happy-eve-is-dying-day.html
---
edit: any day now frankly
---
How? You can be in a titan but can you fly it, can you use it properly at all? Not to mention you could do the same thing years ago on the character bazaar. You still had your experience struggling to earn that titan, its not gone away. 
---
I'm sure on an individual level D&amp;D can be a lot deeper and more complex, but one of the things that has always set Eve apart is the single shard.  You and I play the game completely different, but we do it in the same universe, and that adds a lot of depth and continuity.
---
It's a total misconception that we don't want conflict, it's just that the conflict we want doesn't happen overnight, and it takes a lot of effort to make it happen.  Yeah, we could go honor brawl goons every day if we wanted, but that doesn't mean anything.  We could try and invade Delve, but that's not a fight we could take right now.  Maybe if we keep grinding, someday we could, and that would be a great story, but that's not going to happen unless we build toward that.
---
(this is a complete digression, but I don't want to invade Goons. I like Goons. They are the only other group in-game that seem to get why we do the things we do.  Ideally FRT and Horde would get their shit together, and we could get a pretty good fight out of them, but that doesn't look good.)
---
To be clear, Titans and supers are still hugely important.  They are definitely more common, and not as expensive, but getting one is still an accomplishment for your average player, and they are still the measurement of power.  There is a certain amount of power creep that just comes with a game ageing, so instead of jumping 200 sniper battleships into a fight, we jump 200 titans.  Same game, same outcome, different tools.
---
And man, I just like listening to Sappo tell stories old and new.  That dude can spin a yarn.  I can't wait to hear his take on UALX or the Meteor War in general.
---
Maybe it is harder to create new stories, but that doesn't mean we stop trying.  I don't Rorq mine because it's engaging or fun, or just to see my wallet get fat (it's not), I do it to build the tools I need to keep the story going.
---
Combat isn't about hitting F1.  Combat is about organizing, picking the right ships, and arranging that you have outshipped, surprised, outnumbered, or correctly ranged (or best of all, all of the above) your opponent.
---
2/3rds of all Eve fights are over before the first shot is fired.  The shooting is just to see how many of the losing side escape.
---
What are the bad things?
---
I should imagine that feels pretty shitty too. 
---
Ill be here. 
---
There is no real way for most players to communicate with the devs, that isn't either controlled by a large player block or doesn't include outrage reddit posts. 
---
I have read about that but I have not come across it myself yet apart from in Jita over the weekend. I know thats a shitty bug but it seems to be affecting a very small amount of people. 
---
Didn't they already buff the base strength of ecms?
---
Our eve discord Will be going up in 3 hours just message me for a link in that time.
---
Or maybe I'm just a little sick and tired of the F1 monkeys sitting on the sidelines waiting for people to ring the bell &amp; deliver them content straight through their feeding tube casting shade on people who try to do something for themselves and others in this game
---
oh cool ty 
---
You should be ashamed of yourself for saying that Sir!
---
Op has no idea... The game is littered with game breaking bugs and you're telling us to be chill? Who are you anyway?
---
I make love to spod rocks in my rorqual in delve... What more to say? 
---
TONIGHT I SHALL DELIVER. DO NOT TEST MY PATIENCE. I AM ALL CONTROLLING.

Clearly you just aren't dedicated enough......... quit your job and bash at 4 am idiot
---
Fantastic
---
I mean yeah, they're refactoring a bunch of stuff; like replacing POS with Citadels. But there's a \*lot\* of Legacy code in a game that's been worked on for over a decade. And even when they refactor code, like the chat system, it can go wrong like we see with how fucked Local is right now.
---
Eve online is a very worthwhile experience to play through for a while.
---
The problem is that... when you've played for a while, you start to see the cracks in the facade. When voices are raised in concern, CCP says they listen and they will improve. Following that, either nothing happens, or they do change things, but do it in a way that breaks more systems than the change repaired.
---
There is no problem with CCP, as a company, focusing on profitable features rather than "fun" like balance or better systems. The problem is that they're doing nearly nothing else.
---
And then there is fanfest, where they broadcast their ideas and wishes and dreams to everyone, while the company isn't willing to invest in those ideas.
---
The individual devs may be on the side of the players, but the company is not. The strategy of the company is to absolutely squeeze the players dry, while investing as little as possible. That's why the progression takes so long, that's why skins are sold by ship and not by color and it's everything else than stuff that turns directly into $$$ is half assed, buggy, broken.
---
Some features of eve can't be broken by CCP though, the market continues to work, despite having a 15 year old interface and basically on quality of life improvements in that time. People band together and fight against each other, as they would do if they had nothing but sticks and stones.
---
If it's nothing else, eve is a social gathering place for people interested in scifi and pvp.
---
If you can enjoy it, good for you. Really.
---
In the past, there was a limited supply of titan pilots, now if you willing to put in enough money you can generate a new titan pilot from nothing in a month. 
---
This means if a ship is OP within a month people will be exploiting the issue whereas in the past it took years for the issue to come to light giving the balance team time to fix it. 
---
&gt; Yeah, we could go honor brawl goons every day if we wanted, but that doesn't mean anything.
---
To *you*. It means something to a lot of other people, and it's also a playstyle that is much harder &amp; less complete than it used to be. 
---
You tell yourself that you're rorq mining to keep the story going, but the fact is that you could stop rorq mining tomorrow and the story would go on as if you never existed. I could not FC ever again, same thing. There are very few people in this game who affect "the story" in any meaningful way and they're rarely the people you hear about. That's why many people choose to focus on the *game,* and creating their own story, rather than convincing ourselves that we're all tiny cogs in a grand Space Operatic machine. We're not. It's a video game, if that game to you is politics - you're not really playing.
---
Looking for music while playing EVE? Look up Carbon Based Lifeforms. 
---
What game breaking bugs? 
---
You take R/EVE way too seriously if it breaks the love of the game, it is like saying going to a comedy show takes the joy of life... 
---
Chat being fucked? I blame the devs who make SKINs in particular for it. /s
---
I didnt say that, I said it makes the game look bad. 
---
ecm drones can still jam you just the same.
---
Every game's white knights that start using the "Vocal Minority" crap is usually a good sign that the game is \*actually\* having serious problems.  There's enough evidence to show its far from a vocal minority.
---
How expensive is it to actually do that? What real effect has that option had on the game so far? Does that not also allow smaller groups of newer players to advance faster and cause more of a threat to the larger groups? 
---
Eve isn't hardcore at all anymore.
---
rule dodging and exploiting something illegal in a game should be punished. Not ignored and low key allowed. This game is not real life. It's a real life sci fi simulator, to some extent. If it were real life you should have actual players try and become part of concord to find and research botters. Not limit availability to any info about it so no major people who can have an impact notice how dreadful it's gotten. We already have and had project discovery added to the game which impacts real life. Actual real life. And it impacts it in a positive way. Not some random similarity in a simulation about black markets.
---
Thats a nicely thought out and measured response, thanks. 
---
The people that enjoy the game casually don't come here man, the number of people that browse this sub is a fraction, this is like the underground of space, it is a sec, just like the number of people that actually take eve seriously and live for eve is a fraction of the people thar play the game
---
You can be a veteran player, and then multiply yourself, fly six titans and fund it with loads of rorquals that's what ccp want, it sells extractors. It's all about extractors. 
---
Capitals class abyssmal deadspace will be with us before the year is out. Adding more and more skills increasing potential sp to sell more extractors. 
---
Most of us are enjoying the game. Most of the community here is just trying to be edgy drama queens because they are irrelevant rank and file fans of their nullsec overlords who they admire as celebrities.
---
It's shallow and hollow. Don't let it bother you op - keep on having fun like true eve players
---
If you think CCP is going to use any technology not developed in-house in EVE, OP is also out of his mind. This is a company that devoted more than a year to developing their own in-game *font*.
---
tldr: everyone else is wrong and they should be happy with a bad product that constantly gets worse
---
shills will be shills I guess
---
Has that happened to the extent that people think it has? I am genuinely curious. 
---
Good point and something to remember. I guess I use Reddit for so much else I just assume. 
---
You mean when Garst goes away again?
---
what a fuckboi
---
Are you seriously this dense?
---
Look, this is the way Eve works.
---
You form a fleet, and I form a fleet.  If our fleets are close in either size, or composition, we fight.  If you have more dudes/bring bigger ships, I stay docked.  If i have more dudes/bring bigger ships, you stay docked.
---
In this case, we suspected you would have more dudes/bring bigger ships so:
---
&gt; the earlier ping told us not to jump/death clone until told to.
---
So yeah, the intent was to take the fight if we could, but not forming was definitely a contingency plan, which we ended up taking without anyone death/jump cloning needlessly.
---
Your shitty fucking narrative is shitty.
---
Hey isk is isk, what can I say. 
---
&gt; I think skins were a clever idea to boost income but a large section of the player base hate them. 
---
No, not really. The vast majority of voices here and everywhere else were all in if some of this newfound wealth found it towards the development of the game and the grumbling comes because that doesn't seem to be happening. Quite the opposite infact, the idea that Eve is in 'maintenance mode' seems to have caught on but when basic stuff like local is broken for months on end even that seems like a generous description.
---
The first line of your OP is exactly the issue with Eve - it's a game you have to stop playing to appreciate. If you stick around for the years many people do the endless parade of half arsed, half finished features start to grate. You seem to suggest that frothing anger and fury is widespread but I'd disagree. Once that was true, now the overwhelming vibe I get from the community is one of disappointment.
---
Eve is dope in many ways, there's much to love about the core of the game but it could be so much better, it could attract so many more players and at this point looks like it never will. That's sad.
---
A rule of thumb for the forum/reddit for all video games:
---
The people who are posting hate the game.  The people who like the game are busy playing it.
---
Well put
---
Thats me. Is Brave still a thing? 
---
Fortification Frontier Stronghold in 7-8 mins is what I average with a solo rattle. 14-16 mins for C4 sites in duel nestors. Clearing C3 sites is about DPS, not tank. Max DPS on two domi's with three DDA's each is 1,508(both ships combined). Max DPS on solo rattle with rapid heavies (T2 fury ammo) and three C3-X or DDA's is 1,551. Keep testing and do what works for you. Fly safe 
---
&gt; It is hard to watch something you love deteriorate.
---
I disagree with your central premise. The game isn't deteriorating, it's just changing. Some changes have been good, some changes have been bad. This is basically the gaming equivalent of some old fart complaining about kids these days and how everything has gone to shit, not like the old days when they had family values and polio. 
---
Counterpoint: they're purely cosmetic and have no impact on gameplay, while being a revenue source that keeps CCP in business and the game open. On the list of things to care about, Skin prices are certainly low, for me.
---
If they raised the price of omega subscriptions, that'd be something to be mad about. If they implemented powerful store-only ships, that'd be a problem.
---
Cosmetics? They really don't make a difference.

I don't think anybody wants to go back to a time where you warped into a fight, stared at a black screen, and 2 hours later arrived in your clone station. 
---
Well like someone says above. After years and years of eve. Eve is a part if life and people whine and complain when it doesn't work properly. Whining is a part of eve because the players can't do anything about it . Bugs like Jita local . Endless bots inflating the market are not game breaking problems but for an everyday player it like a lack of quality of life feature. 
---
What even is this attitude? CCP is a company which makes a product we pay for. I though we were paying for a working space game, not to support the morale of CCP employees.
---
Especially when newbs/casuals were war decced into oblivion.
---
&gt;I still kept up with EVE and I am here now  
---
&gt;FW is fine, it was never really about system control for most people  
---
&gt;What you think is broken is not broken for a large amount of people. 
---
Dude, all due respect, are you high?
---
You're just like me, i like to come here and see the autism, just don'te take this seriouslly, it is fun and all but is the low end of space xD
---
I recently had to get accounts out from behind 2FA. I did my lower-SP alts first, but left my high-SP accounts locked until I had my new phone in-hand to re-enable 2FA.
---
I don't trust it, even for a few days.
---
I'd disable it right after. I don't like that CCP's 2FA implementation does not provide a recovery code like everyone else.
---
Brisc Rubal wants to know your location!
---
Are you? Because the spin Seddow was pushing here isn't that you stood down because you had to (everybody does that), it's that it was THE plan all along.  The idea that it was a contingency plan is your after-the-fact fabrication.
---
As a dirty casual that leaves and comeback and finds say... renter corps to be too demanding on my time, I find the changes fairly often and improving ever so slightly.
---
My point being that there are different kinds of players with different perspectives that may not see or experience the problems you do; No TIDI for me, for example
---
Those other people are not wrong, but you laying on your side as the only right one makes you a good entertainment, brosky (like Stainguy). Game has room for you too; It maybe just a very loud minority of reddit trolls/imperial propagandiststhough
---
Whoever SerQwaez is on reddit please send me a PM thanks
---
 :)   good days ahead my friend  :)
---
Can't smartbomb pods.
---
See, memes are so much funnier if used appropriately and out of nowhere. Upvote to you Sir!
---
&gt; FW is fine
---
ok this is where we know you're a complete mongoloid with absolutely no clue of what you're talking about. Literally every single big FW entity in the cal/gal wz left it due to shit mechanics, on the caldari side you have the bloc leaving to SC, followed by templis leaving to null and hecon/UF leaving black rise to the edges of lonetrek null connection. On the gal side FEDUP left a long time ago for null with GMVA(?), BLFOX completely left FW and joined RDRAW which left galmil a while ago too. The only thing left in the WZ are an overwhelming amount of farmers and a couple rp guys. The amarr/min been dead for a while with only long time rp groups such as ushra'kan having some activity.
---
A great example was when they wanted to add the new AI for rats. Before, whatever ship they attacked first was the one they'd keep attacking until either side died or the player under attack left. They designed the system in place now with target prioritization, deleted the old rat AI, and put it up on the test server. And discovered that POSes stopped working. Not that they had one malfunction or that the defenses didn't work, but that they became bricks. So that old rat AI is back in the game just so that whatever hook some ancient dev attached from the POS code still works while the rats run the second AI.
---
Given anybody sane already runs an SP farm ( this is why plex is going up and up ). 
---
The real effect it has on the game is well everyone and their mum is dropping caps on everything.
---
The problem is to source supers in the volume you would need to fight the bigger groups you need well a source of ore, the only way to get that source is to have the strongest local super fleet ( because of the nature of rorq mechanics ), meaning the best way for new players to benefit is join a massive blob and rorq mine or titan rat.
---
Congrats bro you deserve it! 
---
Newbro here but I don't see how it makes sense for ammunition types to have tracking modifiers. Isn't tracking based entirely on skills and the turret?
---
Pure blind is like the Wild West.
---
Character bazaar transfer takes more than an hour, and the guy you bought it from had to have trained all the right skills you want etc.  You could literally be sitting a bespoke character in a titan right now in under one hour.  
---
Can you find those in high sec?
---
Any news on black screen? Its pretty obnoxious someone can probe and warp to my scout alts before I can even hit cloak
---
man you had to come back to this thread to find an neutral explanation comment to return to angryposting 
---
reevaluate your time online, for a start
---
Afraid not, tracking and range depend on hull bonuses, skills, turret type, implants, drugs and ammunition selection. 
---
Blame Hilmar
---
Skin way too thin. 
---
Delet this
---
Your logic has no place here - also you've used words and concepts that are well above the level of most people on here. For that, have my upvote.
---
I hurfblurf about ECM. :D  
---
I've always outpiloted ECM by either waiting for a missed cycle to dive in and nuke them or burning in and out of their lock range. I concede that this might very well only be possible because ECM is limited to alts and bads, but it's still counterplay. Of course if you're trying to brawl in a Hyperion or something, a Falcon will disable you, but so would most support ships.
---
Obviously hired by CCP
---
&gt; Is it worth it to pay for omega. That wasn't even I thing when I stopped playing 
---
Omega was around, it was just the monthly sub, same thing exists now with a FTP level under that (alphas)
---
im glad you are enjoying the game, a lot of people arent. We are allowed to not enjoy the state of and direction the game is in.
---
&gt; fotm 
---
more like flavor of the last 10 months ayy
---
Thats where you are wrong.  Most of us don't actually play the game.  
---
have to actually form to punch anything
---
oh yes I am the one claiming my side is unilaterally the right one, not the OP that is effectively saying that an overwhelming majority of posters are wrong and he is right because he's a blind shill in the honeymoon phase
---
well it's eve players, bound to happen some time
---
PL does better when doom goes away. Are you twins?
---
This is the cost of the shittiest event they’ve ever done. Ever heard of these restaurants where you eat in total darkness? Well in this event you could mine behind an almost completely white screen. I hope you enjoy this little gem it left in the game.
---
&gt;alpha and omega clones
---
Alpha are the free accounts
---
Omega are paid accounts.   
---
You can 'pay' for 30-days of Omega time with 500 plex (Costs around 1.6 billion ISK, depending on market conditions)

But... he was swapping between two ships... surely that was worthy of a comment.

things like chat have been an issue for nearly a calendar year - is it really any surprise people aren't being super polite?
---
it's not like this is some f2p game ccp do for the love of it - it's a subscription based MMO people have been subscribed to for years, in some cases as many as 15 years. when you're forking over cash, you expect a certain standard to be upheld unlike with some guy's side project f2p game.
---
Counter point.    You have to listen to valkosira.    50/50?   
---
&gt; but can you fly it, can you use it properly at all?
---
if you can't use a titan properly under a nullblock (and even out of one tbh) you have some serious issues, its literally 1 button, maybe 2.
---
Hilmar and his engineering team had lots to say about how they overcome games development challenges, constantly pushing forward in a drive for innovation and breaking boundaries. 
---
Does this include EvEs innovative chat system?
---
Take the money Korea gave ccp, make everything 2.0
---
I'd stop playing for two years if that's what it took.
---
The Wolf is a viable kiter, despite the fact sthat the Retri is way better and that I CRUSH THEM BOTH with my Enyo, the brawling glorious top of the assault frigate pile
---
You trolling? Cause you seem to know about eve and not know about eve all at the same time. Titans are without doubt the easiest ship in the entire game to fly.. You join a big group and just listen. The character bazaar was shit as well imo. But at least the pool was limited and during those times it was still a task and then some to build a titan. No compressed mineral.. Building limitation in stations and so on. That's assuming you had the isk.. Which back then again.. Was not so easy either.
---
Ah yes, the r/Eve cycle of we hate you ccp to we love you ccp.
---
I'll be sure to come by next week to reap my sweet karma. 
---
Incompetence and greed.
---
Yes it has
---
at this rate it'll be FOTY.
---
First Gobbins post in 4 months and it this lol.
---
You can pre lock them though and kill the ecm drone that's jamming you, you can still use them to run but you typically can't win fights with them anymore. For most solo ships you can now get rid of it in under 5 seconds and go back to shooting your target, so it went from a 20 second plus your lock time hard disable that could potentially go on indefinitely with bad luck, to a semi reliable lock reset that can be dealt with and when you need to.
---
I think the key thing is that they are so much more consistent now and they feel so much better to fight against, sure some guy can run with them but that's fine, that's what they are there for ultimately.
---
&gt; You tell yourself that you're rorq mining to keep the story going, but the fact is that you could stop rorq mining tomorrow and the story would go on as if you never existed.
---
Right, but if everyone quit, the story wouldn't continue.  I don't really feel like I need to be in the center of everything to enjoy it.  I'm perfectly happy just contributing, even if my only contribution is not quitting.
---
&gt;That's why many people choose to focus on the game, and creating their own story
---
And I get that, and have done that in the distant past, but at this point in my life, I can't make the commitment I did back then.  Also, it wasn't fun to me, it was fucking stressful to have people asking me what we were going to be doing as soon as I logged on.  Now if i want to go ride my bike, no one even notices, back then if i wanted to go ride my bike, half my fucking corp quit.
---
Then that middle ground, where I was part of a small corp, but not leadership, that's where I really didn't feel like I mattered.  That really did feel like COD where I just logged in, got some frags, and fapped over my KB.  That was one of the times I won Eve.
---
Please don't mistake anything I've ever written as me shitting on any particular group of people for playing the game any particular way.  I respect that other people are looking for different things out of Eve, and if I'm shitting on people, it's usually because they shit on me.
---
&gt;we're all tiny cogs in a grand Space Operatic machine
---
That's what it is to me.  Point, laugh, whatever. It is what it is.  I have a lot of fun with it.  Maybe by your standards, I'm not playing, but somehow I've found a way to keep enjoying the game 11 years after I started playing, and at a time when basically all anyone wants to talk about is how shit the game is.
---
What due respect?
---
i think i personally need to move back to providence. after leaving i have never had hte same amount of fun as i did there. grass is greener and all that i suppose...
---
I always feel better when I remind myself that the game won't die as long as everybody says "eve is dying".  It's just a reflection of how much we do care, and it is a shame that we have to show it through a focus on what worries us--often as we do with the ones we care about irl too--but it nonetheless means that we love this game and care more about it than most people ever could for their hobby.  Still, it is so important to be explicitly and openly positive, too.  Thanks for that OP :)
---
 YEah they use asic miners these days. 
---
No, I meant  - is anybody recognizing this piece as original EVE music. I think it plays in wormholes. Btw thanks for your suggestion.
---
Your friends are idiots and you should find better friends. 
---
&gt; All the people hurfblurfing were people relying on ECM as a crutch to pvp. 
---
 tiktokk "hurfblurfs" about ecm
---
&gt;  I have no need to find situations where you used ECM, nor do i consider you someone who needs it as a crutch for their ability to pvp.
---
sorry mate, you can't have both
---
sure SP is generated from nothing. You can allocate as many SP farming accounts as you want, unlimited number.
---
Same thing with pretty much every MMO I've played - the people who are enjoying themselves don't post on forums/Reddit because they're too busy actually playing the game.
---
I was wondering the same thing, it took me years to get the second account. 
---
maybe it would be best to leave whole reddit forever... just play the games you like and stop reading about it on some hateforum... 
---
As I mentioned in my post, that's a separate issue. And as another user mentioned, you could also do that on a bazaar by just training a character for the sole purpose of selling him later. 
---
its not just QOL, its also about crafting your own character to your whatever needs, in 0 time.
---
mate ur legit pretty dumb lmao
---
just enjoy the game and try to stay off the reddits
---
Colossal Asteroid Cluster 
---
yup. you actually have some sort of diagnosed learning disability or some shit.
---
It's right in the fucking pre-ping
---
&gt;Dont deathclone until called to.
---
10 bil but I’ve did a lot of pvp over holidays 
---
 The only problem is, there are bad people in this game, and we need to fight about it.  
---
Sometimes shooting them in the face InGame just isnt enough!
---
Lmao. Goons propaganda still going out in full force. I'm sure you would love to see Marshy banned. I love your salt, keep feeding me more rorqs baybay
---
So how do Rorqual bots work? Goons are currently shitting out trillions with mostly the use of rorquals. As far as I am aware, there are no (good or effective) rorquals bots. That would lead to the assumption actual people are in them happily mining away. I could be wrong. But I am assuming every other big alliance uses rorquals (well besides Horde). So how would you explain that by your story?
---
So when do POSs finally get removed from the game? 
---
Wow, such post. 
---
Dunno, I stopped playing a couple years ago.
---
Grr gewns, grr botters and grr snuff.
---
Believe me, compared to your average theme park MMO it's still the most hardcore game out there. If anything, they've made the entrance more accessible, which is a good thing.
---
Looks like locals are harassing them.
---
I get people are frustrated with certain things, but sometimes these people exaggerate _way too much_.
---
Did you hear about that Korean company buying a bunch of shares in CCP? Here's my personal perception of how it was perceived by the various EVE communities:
---
* /r/eve - OMFG IT'S ALL OVER, HILMAR YOU ARE A TRAITOR.
---
* Tweetfleet Slack - They'll probably fuck this up too, might be OK though.
---
* forums.eveonline.com - Sounds great, can't wait to see what's coming!
---
* in-game - so, what's going on?
---
If you want a balanced view of the community, I'd suggest heading over to the forums. However, I too would like this sub to be good.
---
We smallgang more than any other nullsec alliance idiot
---
I just came back to eve how dare you guys complain about a pretty shitty period in eve while i was gone etc etc
---
Rant over
---
It will be awesome! 
---
Don't you use AT ships as a crutch in PvP?
---
That's unfortunately how bad it is already.
---
he's in the bastion, 3 day old eve uni recruits are tryhard to him probably
---
When do I go away?
---
GL with PL :)
---
-CrdGraelyn
---
&gt; And I get that, and have done that in the distant past, but at this point in my life, I can't make the commitment I did back then. Also, it wasn't fun to me, it was fucking stressful to have people asking me what we were going to be doing as soon as I logged on. Now if i want to go ride my bike, no one even notices, back then if i wanted to go ride my bike, half my fucking corp quit.
---
And this is the lynchpin of it all. CCP realized this as well - people don't want to feel like the world rests on their shoulders. They don't want to feel like if *they personally* don't log in *today* that other people will not have fun. They wanted people to be able to log in, play a bit, maybe mine some ore or go on a roam, and then - leave. Which is fine. I have a 2-year old and a job and a family, I'm not playing 12-hours a day much anymore, either. I get it. The problem (to me) is that the way that CCP ensured that players would be able to log in and play casually also did 2 other things - it enabled insane passive rewards for passive play, and it made defending your space a trivial task.
---
Now, we have people who log in for a few hours and make a few hundred mil ratting or mining, then log off. We also have people who never log off, scaled their operations to 30+ rorquals, and are pulling in billions per day in totally safe, infinitely mineable isk. Ratters who literally don't even bother worrying about neuts in local - they will almost always be saved. In turn this had lead to super/cap proliferation &amp; isk inflation to the point where, unless you're roaming a frienemy's space like Goons and TEST do, the only certain output of a roam to any space where people are is that you'll be met with a supercap blob. 
---
I don't think you're shitting on any particular group of people, and I don't blame people who want to play casually for taking advantage of the way the game is set up. I just know that eve is losing part of what made it special - now more than ever, vanishingly few people control most of the content in the game.
---
All game reddits are like that. People complain about things they don't like, when things are okay they say nothing, so you see the complaints.
---
Always post "Marco" in Local first thing after logging in, WH Law states that anyone else in system must reply "Polo".  Only way to make sure you're alone.
---
Edit I am bad at replying. 
---
They are essentially two different accounts that would rewire separate 2fa
---
Is this what they mean by bushido?
---
If you don't know on what side of a gate a freighter is going to land. And if 10 seconds the normal way gave you then you're just bad.  (freighter deceleration is very long either way) the freighter pops into the gate the mentioned he loads onto grid.

I believe this is what they call operations insecurity.
---
Not all support ships would disable you, it comes down to how theyre fit and their gang.
---
A long point only lach/keres means i can MJD. Jammed by a falcon and scrammed by 2 ceptors means i can do nothing. Damps dont damp you down to 0, you can still target something in scram range. Kill scrams and MJD. If long scrammed/damped, sure, im probably fucked. But, ill be honest, the amount of scram/damp ships that exist is small compared to the amount of rainbow ECM ships that undock to keep something perma jammed.
---
If i have a SEBO fit, it can provide a fixed increase to my range, it doesnt matter what the damp ship does, i will always retain the added range my SEBO gives me over his damps. An ECCM scripted SEBO doesnt have that consistency.
---
TD ship can be negated by transversal and doesnt prevent escape. Can also be counter neuted if in range.
---
Neuts can be countered to some extent with cap boosters/batteries
---
Webs dont matter to a brawler
---
Ive realized, for all the people that complain about nano gangs or nano fits, they sure love tactics that punish brawlers and force kiting.
---
wh life is fun. 1 week of inactivity is not a lot time to consider it inactive.

enjoy wh. treat the area as hostile at all times but explore, experience and learn all you can. you can treat it as a daytrip or put down roots, but dont anchor anything you cannot afford to lose. and when i say afford i mean isk and also mental affording..lol

If the game isn't for you then it isn't for you dude. You want us to spoonfeed you how to figure the game out?
---
This isn't a normal mmo, the information is out there, but you need to invest the time and energy to learn everything... Otherwise go back to WoW
---
So quit.  And can I has your stuff on your way out.  Clearly you missed the point of OP and find it necessary to drag this convo into the pit of negativity OP is referring to.  :irony:
---
because you ask for a price it's give 40 injectors or about.
---
So let's do some math 2700SP or about 4 injectors ever 31 day's, multicharacter training means about 12 per account totaling 60 bucks for 12 injectors using real money, or about 240 bucks for a titan alt, seems perfectly within credit card warrior range.
---
would give you 48 injectors or a titan alt.
---
My EvE friends ask me if I still play EvE. I say no I'm done. But sometimes I come back to this reddit just to see the politics and memes, (Which truly can be much more interesting to me than the game itself) I get really angry when white knight cucks defend CCP for the shitty job they do here, because they are transient, they come and go as they please, and if my suspicions are correct, never leave the safety of high sec. Not experiencing the game, with all of its harshness, the highs, the lows that I have and many others have. 
---
Truly the only way to win EvE is to come to the realization, that this game is bad. That you need to objective tally the score if you will of all the bugs, the fun, and the time sunk, and reach that last wisp of certainty that you have left. That frankly EvE isn't fun, because the game itself is dog shit. Its the people that are fun, and it always has been.
---
So I guess I wish you all the best, this video made me laugh.
---
The only issue with 2FA is how often would we have to re-authenticate. Personally im an alpha and play through the Steam version so i presume the only way to log into that account is via steam account.
---
But for hardcore players who prefer to multibox, do we require them to authenticate every log in? every day? or week?
---
Lastly I would encourage a perpetual reward as well, cause what is to stop a player from enabling 2FA to get the SP and removing it if it feels like an annoyance? even if its something minor like 10k skill points a month you have 2FA running for alphas and 15k SP for Omegas.
---
My favorite glass cannon.

What, you gonna call me irrelevant? Well guess what, we're in the same boat fellow nobody.
---
The system node should already independently know exactly which pilots are in system. It's just a matter of having it populate the Local capsuleer list.

Wormhole law in this universe is just not governed by reason...

&gt;" EVE isn't "dying", but that's not the same thing as saying that EVE isn't seeing a decline in subs or APC while CCP's "austerity policy" of 95% fixing and updating and only 5% new stuff continues. "
---
The first reply on that post. It's funny that back then (4 years ago) people were complaining about pretty much the exact opposite thing we are complaining about now.
---
and?
---
I was going to make a post but I had too many stories and couldn't pick one because they're all good and I didn't want to leave my other friends out.
---
What do you want? A cookie?
---
Be the change you want to see
---
It's not that Rorqual bots are hard to make or anything, but the return on investment isn't as good as other methods, and you're at a greater risk of dying. 
---
For real players sitting at the screen they use Rorquals because of the massive scalability of it for minimal effort and typically have support to aid them.
---
If you're going to bot you don't give a shit about the effort involved so you'll use higher isk/hr methods like carrier/super ratting, or ones that draw less attention to you and are disposable like vni/gila/etc.
---
Misinterpreted bug. If you saw something on dscan, you could then leave grid and it'd constantly update the distance from where you saw them last, but it wasn't updating their position live. Just the last place you saw them.  Still absolutely broken but not gm dscan
---
For example if you stayed put and dscan as they warp off, you can see them at like 2k km, and even when they go way across the system and aren't on normal dscan anymore, you'll see them as 2k km still. 
---
Eve is dying. But as an alleged Blood Raider role-player, this is what I like.
---
His words:
---
"Please find cases of me using ECM outside the alliance tournament"
---
I never claimed he used ECM. His statement was accusatory, in that it was perceived i was accusing him of using ECM.
---
Sure i can. Because ive fought and know of tikktokk and his shenanigans. He isnt the typical ECM pilot on reddit or in game. He's free to have his own opinions, but most of the loud minority that cries about ECM changes on here are those that have relied on a falcon alt for the majority of their pvp career.
---
He is the exception, not the norm.
---
Shall i rephrase it as "all the people hurfblurfing about ECM were using it as a crutch to pvp, except Tikktokk who saw no issue in the old mechanics"?
---
https://esi.evetech.net/ works for me, so it seems like its up
---
Would you be better off with a two ceptors tackling you with a Curse TDing and neuting? What about two ceptors and a Scimitar? What about two ceptors doing driveby scrams with a Keres? ECM would only disable you with the the occasional miss. All of what I just suggested would shut you down permanently and in the case of Curse, actively kill you, too.
---
Containers are already broken open when a structure blows, after people were using hangar containers to (accidentally or otherwise) deny loot at the beginning of Upwell.
---
This spooked the shit out of me earlier today. Came back after a few months break, moving my caps. On my scouts screen my dread was just sitting on the gate whilst I was still warping on my dread alt.
---
Wasn't sure which screen had bugged out and was panicking that I was sitting vulnerable on the gate.
---
Unfortunately it's never as simple as "just have the node tell you who's in system". There could be any number of reasons why that's a technical pain in the ass, and adding more complexity to this already complicated chat system doesn't seem to be the way out of this mess.
---
Of course, that's all speculation on my part, but if it were really a simple 20-minute fix I hope CCP would have done it by now.
---
A buff to supercap is always welcome!
---
"I don't like how you play the game so I'm going to call you names and act superior"
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
3rd party coincidence.
---
If you make an instadock bookmark(or a citadel perch) you'll find you're tethered while you're in warp. Sometimes if you're slow enough passing through a citadel you'll get tethered even though you were just passing by. 
---
do you play it online?
---
Depends on the ship. TD's mean nothing if im in a torpedo ship (good luck finding MGD fit curse/sentinel on a roam). Curse doesnt prevent me from neuting ceptors or escaping. Or neuting one ceptor and ECM drone the other 
---
I can alpha through a single scimi. I can still lock the scimi and put (ironically) ECM drones on him to get a break from jams. I can alpha small ships through reps.
---
Also, you now have 3 ships to effectively counter me, instead of 1 falcon. Much more preparation involved and good pilots actively flying doing drive-bys to accomplish the same task. I see no issue with that. I see an issue with lazy pilots and cheap tactics that is accomplished in a single ship.
---
Last night, I went solo roaming in a t3c, cross jumped a friendly small fleet, caught something, called them back to help me, got a couple frags and barely escaped with my life thanks to the fleet. 
---
20 minutes later I jumped my Titan and FAX into a dread bomb, DD’d a dread and saved a rorqual. 
---
This subreddit is a bunch of crying, complaining, and shit talking and does a disservice to the game and the massive amount of fun that can be had. 
---
But seriously, a Raitaru or Astrahus is pretty cheap to buy and fuel and will make your life enormously easier.  You're very unlikely to lose a fueled citadel in lower class WHs unless you try to move into a hole someone is already living in.
---
Shoot a POCO and see if anyone logs in. Then you'll know if it's inactive
---
&gt; Shall i rephrase it as "all the people hurfblurfing about ECM were using it as a crutch to pvp, except Tikktokk who saw no issue in the old mechanics"?
---
you can just stop trying to delegitimize people who disagree with you on ECM with silly provably false blanket statements, it's not like you don't have arguments on your favor anyway. 
---
Nah it's pretty widespread. I know you've just come back so haven't been play much with it, but I've dealt with it at least 10+ times on each of my 10 accounts.
---
You know what dude, i also liked it when i came back after a break,  but guess what, after 4months of playing and reading this place, i stopped playing again and perhaps this time for good.  Its cool that you are having a blast, but this game has its problems. You might be hyped and positive, but why the hell should other people be? Little to nobody probably cares about devs feels, and why should they be? People are paying to play this game(at least some of them) and their getting less bang for the buck than before because of these bugs and other things mentioned by others, so its not surprising that they are salty or pissed off. Put in few months and if you still love it so much good for you man. 
---
So we should say great job breaking chat?  Really appreciate the citadel spam too!  Kudos on killing Faction Warfare guys!  Maybe you should actually know what people are upset about before you start talking about it?
---
Nah, this is the slightly different category of bullshito.
---
My stockpile of Griffin Navy Issues is now worthless.... I now cannot even afford to login. 
---
TLDR: I'm poor thanks to ECM changes. 
---
That is the prevalent category in Eve.
---
Remember that a lot of the negative nancys are from PL/NC who went from being top dog in New Eden to laughing stock within a short couple of years.
---
PL especially have been upset ever since UALX, their numbers plummeted and literally never recovered after Test schooled them so hard. For them the game really has changed for the worse because the "I win" Super button has been taken away and their cancerous culture makes them undesirable to join.
---
Well said. Although most r/eve posters love EVE dearly, they are abusive lovers, though they would claim the abuse is mutual. Some time apart is called for.
---
That one has unfortunately been pretty consistent over the years. Still get it trying to jump into big battles today (or the brown screen of death in battles of any size).
---
Anyway, I'm not saying the game is perfect or that there haven't been dumb decisions by CCP. I'm saying that a bunch of old fogies have been blowing it out of proportion for years, throwing what amounts to a decade long temper tantrum. 
---
Eve has been "dying" (according to reddit) for *years*. What the fuck ever, just STFU and go back to griefing 1 day old characters you scrubs.
---
geminate is the new provi?
---
Wait, and then there is people instantly appearing on grid and being able to lock you, the warp in bug.  Thank you CCP for that little number too.  Keep up the good work team!
---
Also if you look. the majority who bitch and complain also are the first ones to sing CCP's praises when things get done properly.  
---
I suppose I should thank you.  Just sold both my Comet skins lol.
---
How does Tapi and Goons attacking Panfam make them provi's punching bag?
---
You're trotting out the self-serving 'newbie' refrain that experienced players don't matter because they're nearly done with the game, so CCP should bias against them. From the perspective of an experienced player that looks like entitled demanding of nerfs.
---
SWArta/SWARM - State War Academy Roaming Militia, officially namesaked 2010, activity has gone up and down with fcs come and gone, but some of us are still there.  It's been an interesting adventure the entire time.
---
I bet the CAS(tabout) guys have a story too.
---
Or, you could HTFU and move on just because a mechanic changed, instead of trying to nitpick a comment on reddit.
---
Funny how for years ECM users liked to see the tears of their victims from shitty mechanics. Now the tables have turned and you dont want anyone to delegitmitize people (ECM Users) trying to get their mechanic back and qq'ing.

Oh, nothing, just pointing out the retarded nature of your response, which is along the lines of "x is in y alliance, he must be a spodbrain miner". Not that you're intelligent or humble enough to take a hint.
---
At least he lived unlike the dream of lowsec gate to Stain
---
Refitting to MGDs is no harder than refitting jammers. You can't neut out a competent ceptor with a battleship. ECM drones are the first to die.  
---
I'd like to see you alpha ceptors under Scimi reps. Anything bigger will not be alphaed outside tackle range. ECM drones will again be primary and inefficient.  
---
I only used those three ships as an example because you said Falcon + 2 ceptors. I guess if you're fighting a bunch of T1 cruisers, only a Falcon can save them, but I'd much rather have any other support ship.
---
It is the same with anything. If you find you enjoy something, you can find a forum dedicated to that thing you're enjoying where people are ruining it for themselves and others.
---
I'm about to head to /r/palletfurniture now to be abused for the toxic project i'm working on which is sure kill my entire family, all my pets and the environment.

There is the off chance that one actual builder will enjoy that project tho so I'll endure the helltrolls for that one person.
---
Um, yes we can, they get blacklisted from the alliance and reported to CCP. There is no place for proven and known botters.
---
Considering the incompetence they've shown in the last 5 years, people actually gave them a surprisingly large benefit of the doubt.  People are finally realizing that things aren't getting better.

I’m not defending CCP’s choices, just saying the terny tiny minority of elite peeveepee dudes who makeup a tiny segment of the playerbase who write screeds on reddit don’t really matter. Content creators complaining carry more weight.

So much this. People complain there isn’t the player count that they want online then constantly bitch about how the game sucks and tell people not to play. We are doing it to ourselves.

---
I mean, you make like one thread per week complaining about mechanics changing, the *vast* majority of them that I agree with mind you, it's just rich hearing that from ya.
---
&gt;  Now the tables have turned and you dont want anyone to delegitmitize people (ECM Users) trying to get their mechanic back and qq'ing.
---
You can do it all you want, just be aware that it only makes your argument weaker. There's this thing called taking the high road, not hard to understand. This tangent has been going far longer than it should.
---
tldr: stop getting assblasted because different words mean different things.

Looking good. Tengu is a nice looking ship, but I prefer the Loki! HAM Loki is just out of this world with DPS too, oh man. Hope you guys have fun and keep doing so. Plenty of activities to co-op too, if money chasing isn't your end game.

I've returned after a 9 year break, to refresh my memory I've started from scratch and I'm doing the tutorial missions (or what I'd consider tutorial  missions)

I'm currently doing the Industry 'Making mountains out of Molehills 8 of 10' mission, I've built the Caldari shuttle via blueprint, problem is the mission is ask me to put it in my cargohole to progress, which I don't have enough room in my hold for, packaged or unpackaged.

**EDIT: Turns out I just needed to click on complete mission!**

So is this mission bugged, or am I missing something screamingly obvious?
---
&gt;Most of the time the good money is in the drops

MOST OF THE TIME IS JUST THE BOX
---
It is pretty much a theme park MMO when you're in a larger alliance, which is the default route shoved down any new players throat.
---
Which goes back to fitting. Do the inties have weapons? Most dont. Is it mainboxed or an alt?
---
The point is, there are far more variables in play than just landing a falcon and jamming and getting a killmail for the rest of the gang. Those variables are what make other match-ups more managable and skill intensive.
---
Ive 2 shot armor drams under exeq reps. Also broke through scythe (not scimi, i understand) reps with the wrong ammo type. While i understand its unlikely, its still quite possible.
---
An inty without weapons can not be neuted out. An inty with weapons cannot both kill my ECM drones and be unneutable. Especially if im running 1 heavy, 1 small neut or any other combo.
---
Jesus you're a mind reader. I could go for a cookie actually told one of my Directors they should make cookies today... or some tighter riegns on the subreddit would go a long way, honestly you guys have to see it to this place has gone down the shitter in a big way. 
---
Yeah I love how far the game has come, dont love the stations tho. 
---
And yet it's already been weeks since this bug appeared without even word from CCP on it, let alone a fix.
---
I lived solo in a c2, hs/c4 static for about 1 yr. It's easily doable but there won't be enough sigs and anoms in the system to keep you active without rolling into other systems. Luckily for me no one wanted to evict me. I moved out eventually due to boredom and joined a massive null alliance. I make more in 1 hour in null than I made in all day in a c2.
---
No U
---
That probably would just cause everyone to move their staging to the nearest npc station. Smaller alliances might not have any npc space nearby they have easy access to, and would either leave null or be farmed for their assets by larger groups. 
---
Also, any major assets lost would be from afk people who had put their stuff in a player citadel and then left for a while, and making returning players less likely to come back would probably have a significant impact on the number of subs
---
Ti-di fixed most of that. Wars used to be fought over who got on grid first and other grid shenanigans. I think very few old fogies are as you described. I think there might be a very few number of people who honestly believe everything they say about CCP, most are just venting. People have high expectations and that's a good thing. Evil died when people stop caring, both the lovers and the haters.
---
And the last time I rolled with hisec griefers, they we're actually the most positive Eve players I've ever played with.

---
How do I gt the notepad, I always forget shit in Jita.
---
Been living in Jspace for a few years now. Cant see myself living anywhere else. Living solo in a c2 is doable, especially with another toon. There's many facets to consider.
---
Do you plan to permanently or semi permanently set up residence there? Warping off at a safe is doable, but not really adequate. I highly recommend investing in an astrahus or ritaru if you plan to live there long term. Fuel cost isnt too bad if you dont go overboard on mods, though a clone bay is super handy.
---
Check out what statics your desired system has. How accessible do you want to be to hs/ls/null? The static connections dictate how easy it is to move in or out of your wormhole. It also dictates how easilly someone else will find you. If for example you have a hs static, it will be easier for you to offload your blueloot. But you are also more likley to encounter day trippers. Theres always the chance for a random rogue hole or five as well. So be prepared for that, which leads me to...
---
Rollers. Rolling battleships, rolling heavy dictors and nuanced ships like the yachts are going to be your bread and butter. Being able to collapse a wormhole and scan a new one is a facet often overlooked by the casual kspacer. Rolling your hole until you get a favorable connection is life. 
---
Keep a couple spare scanners and if you're using two toons get them both to a passible level of scanning. You may get rolled out of your chain by natural occurence or other players rolling their chains. You may find your scanning shipb reduced to salvage if the locals you rolled in to dont take kindly to visitors (we never do). So be aware.
---
Treat it as if someone were always watching you. Its highly likley someone is. Keep your eye on dscan and if you're realy paranoid, crit or roll your holes. 
---
Siggy or tripwire are your friend. They are web based apps that will help you map your wormhole chain and give you an idea of what your cinnections are and what neigboring systems are handy.
---
Except its not deteriorating and is getting better.  I like alot of the changes they have done since I started playing.  Every change that's made, people are crying about it being the end of the world when its just that they hate change in general, even if it is for the better.
---
Yeah there have been a lot of positive changes, I talked about those all the time. I'm actually very positive about CCP. but there's also a lot of serious issues that are very difficult to solve and will require a lot of determination. I think I can be both critical and positive. if you don't think I can be, I guess that's your opinion

---
Yeah, I'm not going to sit here and deny that PVP was more fun and engaging back in the day.  I feel like the game overall is more accessible now, but it was definitely easier to undock with a few friends and get some gee effs back then.
---
But all any of us can do is play the game CCP delivers (or not play it, which isn't always the wrong choice).  I can't change the rules, I can only change how I fit in to them.
---
So are we gonna fuck now?

Im not representing the imperium, goons, bastion, tnt or even init here.

I must have missed your point i guess... So please explain what exactly you are trying to say.

It is a tremendously deep game that is thoroughly intimidating to many possible gamers.  I have begged friends to join because I think we'd have fun, but "No, Eve is too much."

People always bitch about things they want changed. CCP is walking a tightrope with anything they do. The fact is, people rarely will post praise, but are quick to post in anger. It's just like leaving reviews for places. Most people will leave a review about a bad experience, but rarely leave positive reviews unless their experience is above and beyond.
---
Did i touch a nerve?
---
Exactly
---
What missions are you running that pay anywhere near 30m?
---
Wah wah, the game I play is actually valued by another company for hundreds of millions. Life is so unfair. 
---
That certainly isn't growing either lmfao
---
Comparing CCP to Wal-Mart..... 200 people...... to a multi-billion dollar company that employs 2.3 million people. (Also VASTLY different businesses and business models(retail doesn't create products, they just sell other people's products) 
---
Think about that for a second. Seriously.
---
I get what you're trying to do but I think that analogy convolutes it quite a lot and makes it sound way more complicated than it already is. It's one thing to be a part of a company that's 200 people and while you might not be in THE department that can fix the problems players are screeching about, you're in a company that's small enough that you probably know every single person on a first name basis. Wal-Mart is such a huge company you probably couldn't memorize all the names in the chain of command above you.

To drive change in a company that big takes way more effort. To drive change in a 200 person company, maybe you aren't the CEO or a person in a position to make those sort of decisions but you can easily raise awareness of issues within the game and the community. 
---
The fact that we get handfuls of different CCP devs on here interacting with the community is proof alone that your analogy is way off. We see change driven by players that started here on reddit. So let's stop acting like CCP is some grandiose business that's too focused on growing their revenue that they can't here what their own employees/players are saying. That's just false.
---
You said t yourself many of these devs are former players that truly care about the state of the game and the well being of the game. Let's stop pretending CCP is some Wall Street firm that's too busy counting their stacks to hear our voices. That's just outright silly and wrong. 
---
Desync bugs for waring and docking range is common, and have been common for a decade. I lost a 10 nil carrier in 2010 and a 12 bil jf in 2016 to these bugs. Each time I quit eve for an extended period of time.
---
Why am I going to pay cash and spend hours or weeks working only for a bug to kill it all?
---
Nullsec assets were never not safe. Worst case you firesold stuff on contracts, but now you just pay a 15% fee, it’s not that different 
---
I thought they could be soloed with a solo passive rattle? Or are they the FoBs and are they different?
---
I’d post a comment in response in local but it hasn’t been fixed for like a year.
---
&gt; Then there was the Citadel expansion. Faction warfare was dealt a final blow bc who cares about who controls a station in system when you can anchor as many citadels as you want and bypass the entire mechanic... All security space saw a spam of structures without limits to the number that could be anchored. All with 3 timers, dps caps, even if they were unfueled, and very small vulnerability windows... This didn't change for probably a year (on mobile at work, could give exact dates later).
---
Still worse, these structures have 0 loot incentive to attack and replace POSes, which were one of the best content generators in the game because they could contain so much loot.
---
My launcher randomly decided to remember half of the accounts it forgot over the last few months and change all my settings back to the old way.
---
Wait the bastion is still alive, who would have thought 
---
Yes, more panfam propaganda plox! Omg, Test isn't doing anything because PGL hasn't posted yet!   
---
HA! QUICK, TO REDDIT!  
---
Act like Pandemic Horde hasn't lost the fight in Perimeter over the tax market. 
---
Mine used to do that until I gave up arguing and use the ISBoxer EVE Launcher, which is usable even if you do not use ISBoxer.

Poorly worded post is poorly worded. 
---
i'm trying to say that there are enough people in these places you have a connection with that *do* consider that to be content. That's not really me saying you're representing anyone, just that its surprising you don't find that point of view a common one at this point.
---
Eve is dying, ccp is making terrible decisions and it's driving the game down the toilet. 
---
Inflation is out of control, ovwe supply of minerals Ia out of control
---
Risk vs reward is gone, the entire premise of even is in jeopardy. It won't survive without serious changes and soon
---
Right, because that's a standard business model for game development companies. 
---
Legend has it if you go into the living room and draw a ISK sign on the ground, surround it with black candles, and sacrifice a goat while chanting "Loan, Loan, Loan", he'll appear. 
---
Deletion of repetative posts, possibly add a sticky for known issues instead of inundating people with constant bitching about the same problems. Example we all know the chat system is broken 9 billion memes and threads later the horse is dead. The majority of people dont even know about Falcons dev blog on the chat system cause it was buried in the shit. Sticky dev responses so that people see them over the top rated shitpost that more often than not has wrong information.
---
I desperately wish this sub reddit wasnt so toxic but its self feeding at this point. I wish instead to aim for celebrating the successes and fun that people do have in eve. But have a stickied thread for people to bitch about their glitches and issues.
---
Theres no magic bullet and its going to take time but the only way for that to work is a concentrated effort that some changes are needed to be made to make it better.
---
yes with ur stupidity
---
The rest of us call that "Parking".   
---
Just park your Nyx in a deepsafe or tethered. Then sprint to highsec in a frig. 
---
Ha.
---
I knew this was the exact reply i would get.
---
1. Standard you must be bitter to think asking someone to make a colour in between the lines picture for which is atry and which is auto t2 ammo.  There is not that many types...
---
Check.
---
2. Point to a typo/spelling mistake/grammar as if it some how reinforces some point you make.  Check.
---
3. Add random statement that people wont play eve cause its to hard. Check. 
---
Eve is easier then ever before. Way way way easier. The argument that eve needs to be made even easier holds no water. Go play fallout 4. Its the perfect example of when you dumb down a game continually..
---
Eves beauty was its challenge.
---
Is your ram set up correctly, same as you graphics care? Are you experiencing huge cpu / ram use when the clients slow? Is it the same client every time or random? 
---
~~Hilarious how these highsec nerds will buy the most ostentatious bling to feel elite and then die like plebs to NPCs.~~ omg ex-goon lol
---
There’s a good thread on eve-o forums telling you how to create backups (as CCP won’t do it for us), keeps all your settings, layout and overview settings. 
---
Kinda like how Trump got elected. 
---
How will we know that the anus on the toilet is really yours and not, say, a ten year old child?
---
Or the mass amount of Astero bots running sites
---
C2’s have two static which makes them more dangerous than c3s in my mind 
---
I VNI rat around 60m per hr and exloration on an alt varies maybe 200m for a couple hrs. I might scan a few ded sites. If I get lucky and get a good drop in a 6/10 it may be a 1b drop. Doesn't happen too aften mind. I reckon I probably average 200-300m per 2-3hr daily session.
---
astra's are safe for the most part in a c2. with a few exceptions. you must be available at any time in a 24hr window to simple log in and defend your cit at a moments notice. they changed the reinforce/destruction mechanic quite a bit 5-7 months ago.
---
they used to be invul for all but 3 hours a week. now they are opne for attack at all times. if fueled, you have two opportunities to defend 1st at a moments notice and 2nd approx 5-7 days out you will get a notice.
---
10 minutes in siege. Gross. 
---
This game IS unironicaly dying it's past peak and most likely has less player than the last 2 years
---
Also let's now forget how CCP let a shitload of actual new players slip between their fingers when they introduced alphas and didn't even prepare for it like a bunch of retards 
---
The reason people are so outspoken and so negative is that eve is the last bastion. Eve is a game that many of us have grown up with, and have created both friendships and communities that extend the game in so many ways. Some time ago the term eve former was coined, and while many of us hope the game will outlast us - mmorpg history tells us different. I personally dred the day the last downtime will hit me. 
---
We all want eve to last. Thats why we fucking tell when stuff bothers us, because thats the way we change shit. We curse because we hope eve will be forever, but we do love it, or atleast love the enermies and friends we made on the way.
---
Based on the number of upvotes, definitely there is interest
---
Word
---
Same attitude that promotes participation trophies and thinks competition is negative.  Sad times we live in, going to be some pretty rough adjustment periods for a lot of people when they discover real life.
---
But how about EVE's players council?
---
The one in fountain would be cleared by init fast.
---
Not quite. You post "Fish out of water!" if you suspect that someone is warping around uncloaked. That then causes them to appear in local chat.
---
you realize this doesnt just happen with freighters right?
---
ive ''abused'' this to get on top of garmurs and kitey stuff before they even landed on grid.
---
its beyond fucked and ccp doesnt give a shit
---
By that definition, that route has always been the theme park MMO route
---
Changing the effectiveness of your ship - :okhand:
---
Putting a little paint on - :reee:
---
I actually love this sub because it reminds me that I still have far to go before I actually become a bitter vet
---
Thats FoB's. Fobs are in highsec. The soyts have killed titans and supers in low/null. Also they drop worthwile loot.
---
as opposed as the noram test propoganda? 
---
also, what does the tax market have to do with the current campaign. PH never assumed it could hold the perimeter market.  nor did it try to hold the tax market. though its hard fund acting as raiders with alpha beans.
---
Salty vets dominating reddit is not unique to Eve. It's basically what you see with every long-running game.
---
&gt;All i seem to see is negativity, granted there is the odd nice post but most of the time its people hating the devs, the game and everything around it. It must really turn people off who stumble in here which is a massive shame because this game really is just as fun as it was 10 years ago you just need to find the right thing to do or group to play with. 
---
  Welcome back, here's the problem - it seems like people are way overreacting to something that's going on *just recently*. That's not really an accurate depiction of why people are frustrated. 
---
Here's a great example:
---
The chat system just got a [new devblog](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pl2ufa/update-on-chat-system-issues) released about possibly reverting it to the previous system because of stability issues. The time frame is clearly stated in this article - the new system was deployed in March 2018, and here we are in January 2019 with an obvious, game breaking problem that has mostly been ignored save for this dev blog for **ten months**. This is on the short end of the time frame - there have been newer reports of rubberbanding which CCP has attempted to address in the past but has been a known problem for... well probably at least four years. We ask, "why is it taking so long, what is the problem," and are met with the same old "legacy code xD" we've been hearing for over a decade.
---
&gt;I cant imagine how bad it feels as a CCP employee to see the community react so negatively to everything and I am sure that if the game shutdown tomorrow 99% of people here would be devastated. From what I can see CCP have done massive amounts of work over the last few years to both improve and keep the game running and yet all they get is hate.
---
  I can't imagine that either, but I can imagine what it's like to beg a developer for months to simply address some issues that have been problematic for months or even years and hear nothing while watching new skins roll out of the production line. I'm not saying artists should be fixing bugs, but it certainly seems to put into perspective two things - the state of CCP as a company and where its priorities lie as the future of Eve Online unfolds. This is further compounded by the reveal of a mobile game. Again, I'm not saying it's wrong or right to do what they're doing - I'm just trying to put the mindset of some members of the community into perspective.
---
&gt;The game is not perfect, there has never been a perfect game. I just wish people could appreciate it and the people who keep it running a little more and spread a little more positivity about a truly amazing game that has a huge amount to offer people.
---
&gt;If you are playing and seem to hate the fact that you are playing maybe change what you are doing, find some new people or a new play style instead of hating the game. There is still so much here to enjoy that you simply cannot find anywhere else. 
---
You're right the game has never been perfect, but undoubtedly and objectively it has been *more alive*, to a fairly large degree, than it now remains. There is a lot of thought going into the "why and how" of that particular fact but a fact it remains nonetheless. People can have fun in any game - sure you can fire up Lineage 2 and play on some private servers and if you like that experience you'll have a great time - but that doesn't mean the game is particularly successful now or offers much appeal for players outside that community and as such offers little opportunity for growth. The problem we're looking at is how the diminishing population and stagnation of significant portions of the game affects the overall health of the "Eve Online ecosystem". 
---
They are radically different. Sotiyos spawn something akin to 100+ diamond BS rats with logi support along with sizable cruiser and frigate spawns. Subcaps will need a fleet to take them on, though they can be cheesed easily in 10MN punishers iirc.
---
He could probably use it as a cheese and buscuits plate.
---
stop riding my coat tails.
---
Yeah but have you made a bug report 
---
controlled by a couple of null blocs. 
---
 The answer may surprise people.  Chribba did [a search of the forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=4802550#post4802550) and discovered the first mention of "EVE is dying" was posted by Madox on 30 July 2003
---
lmao gottem. 
---
The only problem is the following
---
CCP-  Fucked the chat server
---
CCP- Fucked banning bots/RMT
---
CCP- took over a decade to address wardecs and it took nullsec to get that done...
---
CCP- still hasn't released shield slaves
---
But I'm suppose to trust these people with 2FA?    
---
The easiest way to karma whore on reddit is to paste a long gripe post bitching about everything. 
---
It's pretty funny to see what PH tells it's line members VS. what PH leadership actually ends up doing. 
---
Keep believing what your overlords tell you. 
---
I haven’t heard any complaints about ECM in months. 
---
This is so true. I remember reading about Fozzie Sov would ruin the game. Then how Skill Injectors would ruin the game. Then how Citadels would. HS NPC Mining, WarDec changes... all of it.   
---
But the game is still great. And I've mostly stayed away from /r/eve since recently rejoining the game... which has greatly improved my experience. 
---
After yesterday I’m surprised to see Test alliance stay docked post.
---
Comet Police Roams &gt; Comet Police Roams with Goons  
---
edit: wait, I guess that means you're still right. 
---
They're unbumpable till they actually come out of warp. It just makes it way harder since we dont know the exact time when to speed up unless we have another alt on grid that isn't experiencing the bug.
---
Its not about eve at all, its about ccp priorities and progress. Implementing new unneeded features which - in most cases cause collosal fuckup, like recent cool chat switch.
---
Creating unneccesary cosmetic items when there are technical problems known for years. Goin free to play with possible more incomming people when the server can barely whitstand the current population.
---
Attempting to fix things that aint broken. Screwing the game to fall in line with other mmos out there.
---
So for me EvE is not the EvE i started and loved so much over 10 years ago. EvE Online turned from a very unique and special project to something that any other mmo out there can offer when you don't look for specific genre. Easy progress hidden in injectors, due to that shiton of bots, hence rmt.
---
EvE lost its magic, the only thing that keeps my 6 accounts subed are the people - eve community, my alliance and corporation.
---
But i can understand your feelings after comming back from 3 years break.
---
Still waiting to write one.
---
You mean like big fat ugly mafia alliance representatives who isn't even close to share common player's willing? I'm troubled with slang sometimes cuz Im new to eve
---
Lmfao our fleet just warped into you. Nice to see you nerds
---
You can always try activating one of the killright scams near a trade hub. Some might judge you harshly for exchanging money for it, but others would ridicule you for being a 10 year old PvP virgin.
---
Sorry, should have been more clear.
---
Isn't tracking based based purely on all of those things with ammunition selection as an exception sensible?
---
Of course a higher tier turret will track better than it's lower tier variant but I don't understand why the type of the actual ammunition makes a difference
---
these are not at all the salty tears I was expecting
---
I don't know anything about, nor really care.

Wow way to make me bust out laughing at work

It really should be called /r/bittervets.

&gt;BIOMETRIC POOP SCANNING

i have something like this, the last 4 weeks i get less and less fps after 1-2h online then i have to restart it to get 60 fps again.

i dident restart it one time and jumped in to a abysel site and got 15 fps so i panic turned down the grafic to low and got 1 fps untill i restarted in the site  https://i.imgur.com/2UDTRbE.png im just happy i run a overtanked gila so i had time to restart whitout dieing
---
what cpu/gpu you running? ( i have 1070 and a i5 7400)
---
Let's assume you're not trolling ( unlikely ):
---
Steve Ronuken - Api dev. ( last kill 2016 ). 
---
Merkelchen - GSF (Null empire)
---
The Judge - GSF (Null empire)
---
Brisc Rubal - GSF (Null empire)
---
Jin'taan - GSF (Null empire)
---
Innominate - GSF (Null empire)
---
Sort Dragon - Darkness ( goon renters ) 
---
Killah Bee - NC ( Null empire up north ).
---
Suitonia - PH ( Null empire up north, sorta fighting NC ). 
---
Aryth - GSF (Null empire)
---
So the CSM has literal 3 non-GSF people on it, and those people are well also living in nullsec. so realistically if you're not in nullsec you don't have representatives on the CSM. 
---
Hi, yes, I FC, I'm a founder of a corp, I provide content for my guys and my alliance. What the fuck do you do other than screech and throw shit any time someone doesn't appropriately gargle the balls of the local goonies?
---
I don't dislike F1 monkeys. I dislike F1 monkeys who are, and I quote:
---
&gt; sitting on the sidelines waiting for people to ring the bell &amp; deliver them content straight through their feeding tube casting shade on people who try to do something for themselves and others in this game
---
I already came though :( and I'm so sleepy now. Maybe tomorrow?
---
Why don't you just marry CCP? 
---
bring back captains quarters or MySpace..? choose one
---
Yeah, I'm gonna need a link... for science, :)
---
You're not wrong that Imperium/Legacy  have both settled in to farm Geminate for content, and Panfam hasn't been able to push them out yet, but we're hardly a punching-bag.  There's content galore for all sides. Big fights, small-gangs, etc. 
---
TEST has lost 3 Titans and a couple supercarriers in their northern deployment. Mind you, 2 of those have been Snuffed-out kills, but overall, they're still ISK negative. 
---
now with better depletion graphics! (says OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA upon depletion)
---
The Meh is strong with this one......
---
I don't know anything about that, nor do I really care. 
---
I will keep saying it. I'm having more fun now than I ever have, in 9 years.
---
PI and gas are also pretty good, I'd find a C2/C3 corp so you don't have to pay for the citadel by yourself.
---
Definitely not a small amount of people. Everyone in my corp (100) has reported it as occurring at some point and for some its been completely broken the entire time.
---
&gt;What did you guys do besides rat in a VNI and show up for CTA forms?  
---
Was there supposed to be more? I had fun.
---
1 account - 3 toons all 3 doing PI with average sp: 40-50 mils/day.
---
I'd honestly be more concerned with the isk sink/faucet imbalance and bots than I would most of this stuff... POS were horrendous shit for years before anything substantive changed, upwell is much better. Timers are too long, you are correct there, and the fact people can throw them down anywhere is a problem but I think the proliferation is more a problem with the players having too much isk. 
---
Maybe 1 week for keeps, 3 days for forts and 24 hours for astra or something along those lines. Fiddle with the other structures similarly. As for asset security it shouldn't be universal. High sec asset security should cost more/less depending on the sec status of the members, lowsec just more expensive in general, maybe throw some faction war bonuses and penalties there. Nullsec would be hard to balance fairly atm given the massive power disparity between groups..
---
One thing that really puzzles me is how annoyed people are with killing upwells. I don't remember pos bashing being much better tbh. The reinforce timers may have been shorter but the things were still a bitch to kill. just my 2 cents
---
Probably referencing the broken chat system, issues with d-scan, and the warp animation.
---
i5 8400 and R9 380X 4gb. 
---
Exact same client every time. RAM was set up correctly. Mildly high usage of CPU, didn't check RAM usage. 
---
I did some exploring, got hooked on flying Logi (though I still suck) and made some ISK. Also found out that lots of people will refuse to scan wormholes to get to hisec, meaning that I can make some fun and relatively reliable income moving small quantities of high value stuff for the people that don’t have jump freighters/the balls to take the stuff through lowsec.
---
That might be a driver issue caused by Windows 10 if you are running your monitors on multiple graphics cards in fixed window.
---
You gotta be kidding! I may be new to eve but I started to despise those filthy goons (gsf amirite?) the very day I saw them on a forum. Such a shame. Still, gotta learn to find some opposing force and join it
---
Because he was doing such a good job...
---
Multifrequency, then literally just the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/science/EM_spectrum_compare_level1_lg.jpg).

Maybe delete that account from launcher, re-add / pin it again and then verify your launcher / clear cache.

Otherwise copy one of your working clients a la client settings backup

---
We live in a society that has focused on the mantra: "The squeaky wheel gets the grease..."
---
Unfortunately, this has created a large section of the population who now have a life goal; to be the squeakiest wheel.
---
Welcome to the future. No one wants to be a self greasing wheel. And no one wants to re-invent the wheel better, stronger, faster. They just want to roll on and be greased.
---
The game has the lowest player number its had in a long time. And that's with the player count numbers boosted by huge numbers of bots and injectors causing a large amount of the player base to be running 3-10+ alts.
---
Feels like its dying/dead as to me
---
There's no real "value" in a ship skin. Has no effect on performance. This is all subjective - trying to tell you this, but the fact that each skin isn't pocket change has turned you off to discussion. So, to each his own.
---
I have heard it many times before. 
---
I go out of my way to represent everybody regardless of where they come from. Saying I can’t represent folks because I live in nullsec is dumb. 
---
Gudposting is returning to /r/EVE, perhaps not all hope is lost for this fucking game
---
Sweet thanks! I’ll have to check these out. 
---
Found zkillboard w my old kills on there. Can’t believe there isn’t an official one still. My old machine I used to play on had so many tools, fittings, and saved links. 
---
I’m feeling like such a noob 🤣
---
No, that's pretty much it.
---
I afk vni rat while I play other games or do housework etc until a ping goes out. Then I swap ships, do the op, then go back to afk ratting.
---
&gt; I cant imagine how bad it feels as a CCP employee to see the community react so negatively to everything and I am sure that if the game shutdown tomorrow 99% of people here would be devastated.
---
You get used to it.
---
Solo, absolutely.  You'll see a lot of grief about "a c2 only has so many sites to run".  That's crap.  Wormholes are actually money printing machines.    
---
The static is what's important, that's where all your money comes from.  A C2 static can be high, low, null plus Any manner of C1-6.  So, you get a C2/C3/HS, you can easily run the C3 static solo, when it's done or you don't like it, it's easy to roll, run another C3.. Rinse and repeat.    Run sites all day.     The key is the prep work.. you can even roll the holes in the static to giver yourself (relative) safety.    
---
Because of the static you have access to unlimited supplies of gas, data, relic and combats.  If you own the customs offices inside that wormhole, you're looking at 500 million a month in PI for a single account.  Passive.    
---
After you get over the initial stress of learning to roll holes, you can just go nuts.     
---
Also, since these are low class wormholes, you don't need to risk multi-billion isk ships (which you WILL LOSE).     
---
For the solo player (as I was for like 2 years), wormholes rock.  With the POCO's and your station, you have your own personal SOV.   They provide PVP, Industry, gas mining, ore mining, relic and data sites.  Pretty much every aspect of Eve.   
---
In my 5 years of Eve, I really enjoyed my time starting out in a c2/c1/hs.  At minimum, all your REALLY need is a drake, astero and an iteron.  Perhaps a destroyer with salvagers on it.  Rest can come later as you get more comfortable. 
---
Yeah, the advantage would be the added cap vs the relay. 
---
On breaks on and off most of the times with this game. Even if I would be giving away my stuff it wouldn't be to a random person on reddit. Currently, there's a post about people sharing their own story of the friendships they made playing this game. You should read it. Friendship is the best kind of ship this game can offer.
---
And about missing the point of the OP. Have I? Tried being positive about all this botting shit until I had enough of indifference and exploiting of botters and rmters for personal gain of an entire alliance. But the times I take a glance back at it, it's even more and more destructive towards the game. If you want positivity, go for it. You want to be happy? Go for it. Game can be fun and enjoyable even with all this negativity around it. It's just my own thoughts and opinions about this situation and the hidden mentality with all the people I talked in-game, on the internet and in rl. This is not a thing that's only happening in eve. Eve is not special. Recently picked up path of exile for example. Game has a dedicated site around rmting, the game itself is getting more popular so rmters are milking that game as well. Hell, look at one of the most popular games around the world called League of Legends. That game became so mainstream compared to 8 or so years ago when I picked it up that even on sites like ebay/amazon you can buy accounts which is against the eula and bannable. People cheat. Everywhere. 
---
You wanna ignore everything around yourself and just move forward? That's your own free will. Go for it. But the same way Skill Up threw in a metaphor about Destiny 2 being comparable to the Jahre Viking allow me to throw in this unadulterated metaphor about EVE Online and it's players. I'm not gonna go in too much detail.
---
Just like horses being used for racing or horse-drawn vehicles, most line members that are part of big alliances in EVE Online are being used for power and monetary gain. The same things that horses wear to prevent them from seeing their rear and getting distracted is forced on the line members, to an extent. These things are called blinkers or blinders. Not being able to look at the bigger picture and only focusing on one task or point could be useful in some situation when most of the attention needs to be focused on something very important until said thing is over. Successful or unsuccessful. Having the inability to see the larger picture means that the danger is invisible if it's not part of the focused point or task. It basically doesn't exist in your consciousness. You are unaware of the existence of the danger. Is there a point in being focused on becoming rich while the greed gets the best of you just to find out that at the end of the road it's all meaningless? 
---
You can enjoy the game to it's full potential. I'm not against any of that. I get that there's a mob mentality surrounding this game negatively, but it's there for a reason. Not just because people are trolling or shit talk. 
---
Horse, horse racing and horse-drawn vehicles documentation can be done with low effort using google and certain sites of documentation like wikipedia. 
---
Anyways, take care. Fly safe 7o
---
I have a loan that might fix that for ya.
---
screw that, i want to be a top tier golfer in the first month or golf is worthless. I tried two clubs at once but I wasn't any better, what a crock! xD
---
Thats sucks. Thanks for everything if that helps at all. 
---
&gt;I never experienced the game in its prime but trust me its still as good
---
Haven't really studied rorq bots at all. From what I know, rorquals can be multiboxed easly without much hustle. So I guess scripting where the mouse should be and when it should click or when a certain key needs to be pressed using a certain resolution isn't that hard. 
---
Amazing Graphic. Love to see the rest of them

I'm from Null and I want all asset safety to be gone including High-Sec so there's that.
---
It's not about how hard they come you, but how long.
---
well, if so, we could dump the whole injector crap all together then, no? You can train characters for selling on bazar after all. The truth is, it is not the same and you know it.
---
delayed gratification is the enemy of the scrub. do you wonder what specific trait can predict your short term success IRL (independent of being in wealthy fam)? it is your ability to deal with delayed gratification. you seem to forget that many folks in EVE currently had to train without skill injectors, and thus HAD to train up to where they are. This is no longer the case. CCP has made it easier than ever for new bros to catch up, so don't act like the game is dead to beginners, because its not, it just takes time to get into the right situations. That first time you have an intense PVP moment is usually what gets people hooked due to no other game matching the intensity (sure it might have to do with all the slow moments that lead up). Maybe it is not for you, but the defeatist attitude will get you exactly no where.
---
Oh my they have one to spare?

Look! Over there! WHATABOUT THEM THEY LOOK SUSPICIOUS, never mind this hard evidence.

An malfunctioning clone, probably.

My best eve friendship started back in 2005. I was still a noob and went in to basgerin. Got ganked in a belt and soon as my ship was blown up the guy messages me and says if I pay him 20mil isk he wont pod me. I told him I didn't have 20mil ( I had less than a mil isk at the time ) So he invited me to teamspeak and I got worried. Back then you had the whole thing if you would sing some embarrassing song the pirates would let you go.
---
Well we start chatting and I find out he is from Finland (I'm from the US ) and he offered to teach me how to pvp and make isk. Since then we were like brothers. We would hang out in eve and other games all the time. Once I got vacation time I got some tickets and flew out to Finland to visit him and we remained good friends until 4 years ago when he passed away.
---
I have come across some amazing people in this game and for that reason I will always love this game even if I no longer play it.
---
maybe eve have started to dislike i5's insted of all amd stuff :-)
---
You do a shit job of it and ignore feedback from people you ask, but yeah sure? 
---
That is the **biggest** understatement I have read in 2019 and for sure a favorite for 2019´s "Major Understatement". :D 
---
I couldn't care less about low powered structures but no, I see no reason to remove the damage cap from high powered structures.  Structures, like ships are intended to produce fights.  Reinforcement produces more fights.  No, not when an entity blueballs but when they do contest a timer.  Also, citadel spam is not solved by making things easier to kill.  It is put in check by making it harder to anchor structures.  Simplest way to fix that in Sov Null is for an alliance to get notice when a structure is anchored in their sov, allowing them to contest the first timer and kill the structure outright.  Remember, a cruiser can pause a timer and fit a cyno.  75 structures means 75 pilots in space shooting something.  If a large entity, like TEST, cannot field 75 pilots to hold space then I don't know what to tell them.  Again, the problem I see is that many of those structures probably anchored without anyone noticing them.  A notice that they are there, ready to be shot at in 24 hours would go a long way to alleviating this problem.
---
Negatory. The injectors have a great use in shortening the gap that veteran players have over newbros. I remember using injectors regularly as a very new player, because the ships I was flying were so cheap I had lots of spare cash. But nowhere near close enough to buy an entire character on my own. So they are used to speed up training, much like a cerebral booster or implants. So this feature would not be possible with just the bazaar. 
---
The problem that I mostly see people having is with day 1 capital pilots and such - the argument that I'm making is that this is what was always possible. 
---
Really? Have tried everything with that damn thing and it still gives me Rifter vibes, serviceable at loads of stuff but not really that great at anything.
---
We hate EVE because we love it.  Its complicated.  EVE walked into a door.

I heard there was a war started cause some Aussie guy didn't like the other guy calling him mate.

Uncheck / check "Audio Enabled" ... usually it fixes for me.

This one is simple.

Stop Playing.

Same. All good though. We're going to be doing more soon!

Not to be a jerk or anything, but you are a noob. You make a new thread rather than replying to your existing thread.  Get it together man!

TEST Alliance are attempting to invade Pandemic Horde. They are attacking their structures which put them into 'reinforced' mode. When you reinforce a structure enough eventually you get the 'final timer', which means that the structure can be destroyed. If the structure is not destroyed at this set time then the structure repairs and it was all for nought.
---
TEST did all the leg work of reinforcing the structure, told all their line members to get hyped for the final timer, then when Horde showed up to defend their structure they backed down and didn't show up for the fight.
---
What can i say. Only in Commonwealth 
---
I started getting into industry in order to build Caracals (back when they were all the rage) so that I could stock our local contracts with home grown rapid defense fleet ships.
---
That took me into stocking doctrine ships, marketeering, learning how to do PI and Moon Goo reactions to have better control over a couple of modules that I could grow myself. Eventually spread out with alts to increase my capacity in those activities with more slots.
---
At some point, I got bored going so hard into industry and used the isk I'd made to offer a buy back service for my alliance for a couple of years. Used the alts to light cynos around and sent my JF picking up stuff all around the region. Used my alts for fleets as Entosis bricks (but you said things besides that)
---
After two and a half years of this, I got bored of it all, liquidated everything, sent a support email to CCP asking them to transfer all of the Omega time left on my alt accounts onto my main. Now that I'm subbed for almost an eternity with the combined Omega time, I'm dabbling around in solo pvp when I've got the time, as well as running a minor T2 production chain for my personal use. 
---
I'm in school again, so I don't really have that much time anymore, but I'd like to get back into the AT groove so I can participate again, but it's not looking likely, so I just do solo roaming stuff when I have the time.
---
I've literally not had my audio enabled ever since CCP removed the advanced audio settings, which I'm still annoyed  about. 
---
I am not playing Eve right now, not sure I will come back. And don't get me wrong, CCP is far from perfect. Incarna would have (and should have) sunk most companies. But they survived. They previously got so much right that they lived through that nuclear disaster. 
---
I firmly believe Eve is not a game, it is a hobby. But not many hobbies are so adversarial. So passions and emotions flare. And this is what makes Eve. I know people who truly hate Goons or PL or NC (I now probably dated?) for various reasons and it scares me and makes me smile at the same time. Internet spaceships are serious business.... I guess :)
---
I don't use Eve launcher because it keeps forgetting my accounts incidents. I use the ice box or Eve launcher because it is more stable and the devs is more receptive to feedback, and actually knows what the fuck he's talking about.

I've only got a single GPU, and while I have multiple monitors, all of my clients around fixed window on 1 monitor. Second one's for porn.

There’s a few Reddit guides kicking about as well. 
---
Exploration, run ded sites from havens, a bunch of small gang roams, imported and sold stuff in our market, PI, mined some dank moons, and have been making enough isk to pay for a second account which I’ll train into caps. Honestly moving to null was the best decision I’ve made in this game. 
---
Ya know, I heard someone wrote a book about this kind of stuff... 
---
I was minding my own business mining in a highsec belt in a 0.5 system in my trusty Osprey in 2008 when a pretty hostile looking guy in a crow showed up orbiting me. I was barely a week into playing the game at this point.
---
Somehow we got into a conversation and while he wasn’t all that experienced in the game as well he was still way above and beyond of me. He showed me some ropes. I joined joined his corp and together we did our first rather unsuccessful steps into nullsec (grrrr Red Alliance). We then joined, as a Corp, the old Northern Coalition in all its glory and inadherent failures. 
---
As a consequence I ended up with the alliance I have been a part of ever since.
---
Kel Arkir (the name of his main) stopped playing this game about 8 years ago. But I’ll never forget him.
---
Some memories will stick around with me forever.

Fuck it's been a day. But this, this made me smile.

I work for a software company that builds a SaaS platform.  All I get from subscribers is:  
---
Why can't the platform do this or that?  
---
Such and such is broken....  
---
Etc.  
---
It doesn't bother me too much...  So I imagine EVE's staff views it very much the same.
---
This is why it's always a mistake to officially endorse reddit as a communication platform and have CCP devs post here.
---
If CCP did not official endorse reddit, there would just be dank memes/shitposting here since the official forums is heavily regulated by the ISD.
---
But now, since people know there are CCP employees actually on reddit (lmao @ getting paid to browse r/eve...) which has given tons of people motivation to try to lobby for changes and bitch about bugs.
---
CCP has to take a hard stance on reddit and just GTFO of here tbh. It would be better if this place existed without them.
---
They need to use the forums for official feedback because the people who actually post on the forums - you can check their character history to see if they are full of shit. (ie asking for mining changes when you don't actually mine, they have a tracket that can see what type of player you are, when reddit totally cuts out that useful information)
---
Until you just anchor in unclaimed lowsec. Or when you do decide to venture into highsec and see the SPRAWL of freeports on your overview. It's insane. It's turning into the Ultima Online housing market. 
---
You're missing the point of my original post here though. That anchoring medium structure takes 30 minutes to kill, regardless of the amount of people you bring. So for the cost of a single fit HAC, I can waste the time of 20+ people.

For sure. The enyo is definitely a ship I will not pick a fight with when flying the Wolf. With MWD/Disruptor/Arty, the wolf could be a viable kiter, its true. I prefer to use it as a Kiter/Ratter Catcher though. Pretty much an Anti-Cancer ship. Its fast enough that, with an OH'ed Scram and MWD, you can catch Garmurs/Firetails/Slicers etc, that land on you at 0 in low sec and attempt to burn off. Lock the target down, turn off MWD, melt them. The Retri is better as a fleet boat, but in a 1v1 situation, the Retri loses to the Wolf, because I can easily mitigate Retri laser damage down by 99% with ADC on, 94% off. The wolf's niche, as I explained to my corp mate, seems to be: Kiter, Kiter Catcher, Ratter Killer, and Anti-Laser Boat.

Get that gabbage outta here.

Once upon a time there was alliance called Chaos Theory. now they are dead. the end.
---
I was kicked from an alliance for buying and dropping it a fort, joined it's sister alliance because they needed the fort, then was kicked from that for defending my corp against the alliance leader during one of his insulting rants (insulted him on a personal level).
---
I ended up selling the fort to some neuts when the sister alliance attacked it (got the full value), left the area, to which a week later a second group moved in and began burning my old alliances space.
---
This of course is the TL;DR version.
---
at least you will have enabled 2FA!
---
I've been debating just doing a "Mad at CCP thursday" or something and condensing it all to one day. It's a tricky situation but there's a massive amount of low effort "CCPls why do u suk guyz" threads that I feel are legitimately hurting the subreddit. 
---
With that being said that would also mean mods are stepping in between the community and CCP which kind of goes against what the sub is all about. We used to handle this situation a lot better about a year ago but reduced mod bandwidth and increased workload via helping the new guys learn the ropes certainly isn't helping that.
---
 Sure, CCP isn't really handling the botting issue / perception correctly - but do we need threads + comments every single day about it? I've had potential new players that think the game is so infested with bots that they are too terrified to play / invest too much time into the game... even if they really like it. Some are literally under the impression that half of Eve is bots. We all know the problem isn't anywhere near that bad but collectively that is the image we've given Eve lately and that is mostly on r/eve's shoulders.
---
I'm open to suggestions but keep in mind this isn't a problem that mods can completely fix. This is a community run subreddit and despite the modbias / mods deleting everything meme we barely do any thread removals at all lately. This is probably one of the least heavy handed large subreddits in existence. Can't have our cake and eat it too.
---
This is the first I've heard of more to do besides moon mining.
---
Forums are garbage filled with in bred mouth breathers with giant egos. Some of the staff even contributed to that fuck fest.
---
Here we're all shit and can't be moderated that easy. If someone genuinely says some good shit it naturally rises. Doesn't matter that they don't have any gold stars for their post histories. Anyway, just my two cents.
---
Dropped stations, pissed off the locals, pissed off my alliance, pissed off my sister alliance, got the tee-shirt, left.
---
hmmm
---
No, it's not, because you will not have the same experience as people well not you, for them being well not you. 
---
Therefore as much as you may try your never gonna be remotely as good of a representative as somebody with the playstyle you're representing. 
---
But let's make this easy: give me a single example where you picked a nerf to your own coalitions playstyle to boost a playstyle outside of your coalitions playstyle. (something you can source in the CSM minutes).
---
Yes. 2fa for all Eve emails, accounts, then a password manager for email password with some rando password.
---
Now I just need to see if I can't enable 2fa for banking

i'd believe PH leaders over what Test Propogandists say
---
I am not missing the point.  30 minutes so I can assume 2x 15minute timers?  That is a low power structure and I suggested a 1 minute damage cap for the armor timer only.  So ANY structue can be killed in 2 minutes (two timers still though) if anchored or instablapped if you catch it on the anchoring timer.  Overviewer?  Just have a tab without neutral structures, don't you nullsecers keep saying that highsec is irrelevant?  
---
I completely understand your points, we just disagree and that is fine.

Well some middle aged man, but we can pretend EVE has female players also :)
---
Yeah she seems to have a lot of hate for Amarr newbros. Do you know why?
---
The thing about implementing some casual aspects to this game is quite simply we need a infusion of players or this game is going to die. I dont lnow if you have been playing long enough to remember the server population being a steady 40k to 50k peaks throughout the day. Now it rarely breaks 30k. Either compromise or eve dies.

Somewhere, there's someone reading this with no idea what Myspace was.

I guess it's easy to think that there is a significant difference between a large, multi-national, publicly held super-corporation, and a small, privately held with investors, 200 man software development studio, but there really isn't.   
---
It's basically a difference between a majority shareholder and a private investor. Effectively, they are the same thing from the perspective of employees at the company. If a majority shareholder at Wal-Mart tells you to make a change, or doesn't like the change you implement, and go against them, even if you are the CEO, you're getting replaced (I'll refer you to Steve Jobs here, and how he was terminated from his own company). That's just how it works.   
---
This also goes into the politics of your position, so we'll use a more realistic example so you can follow it.   
---
Let's say Rise decides he wants to advocate changes to citadels, to make them more dangerous, why wouldn't he, it would make the game that he loves more content rich? Were gonna skip a couple steps here and make this a VERY small company, so he goes to Hillmar and makes his case. Now to Hilmar, this doesn't sound like it would be very profitable, which by definition of it being a small company, and being majority owned by investors, means that these changes cannot be given priority if Hillmar is supposed to hit his valuation metrics for this quarter. So, Hillmar tells Rise "maybe at some point in the future we can address this, but for now, we need to do -insert random money making thing-".   
---
Maybe Hillmar also likes this proposed change, but, because he is beholden to the will of the investors, he really can't get time slated for it, or he risks putting both his position and the position of his staff at risk. If he were replaced, who knows how many other roles would also be replaced by whoever filled his position (people have friends and petty motivations, it happens)? So, for the sake of stability, not only for himself, but also for his team, Hillmar decides to shelve the idea. Maybe he can get it in someday?   
---
Now, back to Rise, what should he do here? He's advocated his position to Hillmar, and Hillmar denied it. Does he then escalate this to the investors to attempt to get them to allow/force Hillmar to make this change? Probably not. As this would put his position at risk. Should he just have his buddy the developer sneak this change in and risk both he and his buddy getting fired, sued, or worse (depending on what jurisdiction you are in, this could be considered a criminal act)?   
---
So, here we are. Once again, even in this example of a very small CCP, the will of the investor is obvious and absolute. Regardless of the size of the company, the will of the staff, the intent of the change, the type of product sold, if the person who actually owns your company decides you shouldn't do something, you are presented very limited options. You change their mind, at the potential risk of alienating yourself, you do what you are told and risk nothing, or you perform a potentially illegal action and make the change without consent.   
---
Every other path aside from doing what you are told has some implied risk to their personal and professional well being. You simply cannot ask this of someone for the purpose of your own enjoyment. It is the definition of harmful selfish behavior, and you should be ashamed of yourself for even considering asking it of someone.   
---
Was good fun, thanks for setting it up
