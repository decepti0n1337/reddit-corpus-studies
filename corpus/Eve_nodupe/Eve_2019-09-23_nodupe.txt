I am not a JF pilot but I can agree that this is dumb. Restricting cap-jumpable cynos to one ship class is one thing, but it's not like anyone with enough brain cells to rub together is going to drop a JF on a hostile fleet.

---
---
Lol.  It depends on the type of game you like.  For me it was Rorqual mining (because if you mine your own ore, it’s free...right :-) ).  Others it’s ratting or the market.  
---

---
In reality it’s just that you play the game you enjoy, you look down at your assets and find you have all kinds of ISK you don’t know where it came from, or what to do with it.  So you think to your self why not throw all your stuff into a ship you only undock 10-12 times a year to sit in tidi on tether hoping to jump into the fight...then you buy another...and another because why not. :-)

It gives you a 25% bonus to range which is sizeable.

Clearly outlined above. You're either pretending to be dense or actually too stupid to comprehend, either way restating the point isn't going to help.
---
&gt;Let them have their reddit moan, they get awfully upset when Legacy + Imperium + XIX/RED/RZR + AOM wins things and it's best to hash those feelings out in a positive, loving environment.
---
You can tell that this has struck a nerve by the amount of downvotes and Legacy nerds posting just how not mad they are under this post
---
Dont let others figure that out. Soon I'll have a monopoly
---
Very marginally.  They could have made much larger improvements, such as allowing you to route multiple structures at the same time.  Instead we got a laggy UI with pictures of planets that takes up valuable screen space.
---
I mean I clearly pointed out that your renters bot, and then you suddenly make a huge leap saying because waffles are ex-panfam over a year ago that we are lossley related to their botting renter corp???
---
hello do you not see the irony in your posting?
---
Agreed, P2 is the way to go, especially first starting out.
---
A ship is an investment into experience, fun, learning, or isk making.
---
And all investments are at risk in EVE, especially when undocked. 
---
When you lose your ships, ask yourself why, then figure out how to avoid the loss in the future
---
New account, it's Omega. I mean I'll probably buy it but there is no way to remove the yellow box in the bottom left of the client that I can see.  
---
Not sure how I feel, I get it for Alpha Accounts, but this is an Omega account with no recurring sub hmmm...
---
Has been for a while. It was minimally invasive and a decent deal so I wasn’t upset or bothered by it.
---
im impressed you got the background song sound/contrast to work so well with voice comms.
---
Saying something is crying doesn't mean it's true. I'm just having fun memeing about Vily's ego. I give two shits about the war that's going on.
---
You used to get 21 days for referring yourself ;)

Heh. Reminds me of that random event of a mass driver shot hitting you from another galaxy in Stellaris. Was fun.
---
is memeing a type?

~~travel fit t2 haulers~~ fuck nvm they nerfed that.

save your shekles imo

There, there.  Have a tissue.

pretty much just standing on the side lines watching things fall apart

I’m not going to complain if they keep offering me 30 days at $7.5-$10.
---
Blade Runners in Etherium Reach have been there since 2013 at least.
---
I would oddly be ok with this. Sov was a mistake
---
Given you use up your real life time to play it, it makes sense to do it in the way you enjoy it, rather than the way someone else enjoys it, no. I'm not in the game to provide free kills to someone else by playing it stupidly, and then having to do mind-numbing PVE to afford to replace my ships. But I mean sure, undock unfitted titans in low-sec and warp them to asteroid belts all you like since it's not a problem for you.
---
both of you are morons from my foxhole, champ
---
Perhaps try following your own advice in regards to this sub.
---
I give both of your rating systems an accumulated value of 7.5 brapples.
---
Heh. Our mostly frig-based fleet was playing some cat and mouse with some of those same guys in the same area tonight. Couldn't really engage given their fleet comp. Ended up whacking a Hull Penetration frig fleet instead.
---
Doing God’s work, bless all of you.
---
This is what I do - there might be better ways but this works for me. 
---
Build 2 extractors feeding into the launchpad as a warehouse, 2- 3x PI lvl 1 factories feeding 3x PI lvl 2 factories.   I produce mechanical parts and coolant because those are essential for structure fuel blocks.   I have 3 planets making coolant, three mech parts.  Remember you can transfer from the launchad to the custom office remotely in system to free up inventory. 
---
Like this
---
https://i.imgur.com/Dv1zNlM.jpg
---
Then - since I dont want to check it every 12 hours, I set the extractors to produce a set amount - 500k, 750k, or 1m each - that way it balances out everytime.
---
Yes it is. It's adapting (downward) to CCP being shit and wow classic release 😂
---
I agree. The only places where the official app is useful is with things where there’s literally no access for 3rd party devs. For everything else neocom2 seems superior
---
[deleted]
---
This I like and agree
---
losing a 500 million isk ship every time somebody wants to cyno camp sounds about as fun as getting terminal cancer.
---
While that change would have been nice, lets be honest, that goes against the spirit of eve. We want people to make more mistakes and risk. Not light covert cyno and let no one know you're moving a jump freighter around.
---
I totally agree. Covert Cynos JFs was the stupidest bullshit meme CCP has come up with in a while.
---
If you want to cyno camp, you are the terminal cancer, shithead
---
Me? I just wanna be Lussy Lou. 
---
(Or at least have his babies.)
---
? Saying travel fit t1 hauler will get bubbled by an Interdictor?
---
Don't start its a griefers paradise.
---
Short version is NC started some shit with the DRF, with the DRF rapidly miliarizing and supporting ex-IT members (who had a bone to pick with NC) in forming what had up til then been the largest military force in the game.   
---
  
---
DC (Deklein Coalition) were Goonswarm + pets in the western half of the north. The NC were eventually steamrolled by the DRF and co with PL being hired to finish them off. During this DC offered but token support, and successfully hoovered up the refugees as additional pets, with a deal eventually being struck by the DC to keep their space.  
---
Later, they would rebrand into the CFC, and over time become the Imperium today.  
---
The best description of events would be this gif, made around that time:

Being personally involved, I could talk more, but don't have the time to write up that much at the moment. :)
---
No, you just don't understand the quote. The quote isn't saying a camel is a deficient design. You are apparently interpreting the quote as "A camel is an animal designed by a committee." That isn't what it says. 
---
It says a camel is a deficient horse as a result of committee, a design 'tragedy of the commons". They started out trying to design a horse but ended up with a camel. They lost the style, flavor, and form to a sea of uncessarly functions that kept getting them further and further off the original design until you end up with a camel versus a horse. A camel is just fine for what a camel is good for, but a camel is a terrible horse based on the metrics you would judge a horse by and thus the committee completely lost track of what they were targeting in the first place. The results kinda look like a horse, four legs, oblong head... but missed everything that was the essence of a horse. A similar quote is "Too Many Cooks Spoil The Broth". 
---
A more relateable contemporary interpretation might run along the lines "An SUV is a Pickup Truck Designed By Committee". Nothing wrong with an SUV but they are terrible pickup trucks when measured as a pickup truck.
---
I want to get full killmarks on a sleipnir. I have a fit I am working on finishing. It's super expensive for me and will take awhile to finish. But once I get it set I am gonna go out and pew pew in it small gang style. Worst case is I have fun in my favorite ship.
---
That's awesome. I am bad at PVP and it costs me far more than I could make lol. I think I am improving though. So that's cool
---
Yeah. Haulers, even blockade runners, are slow enough that it will be trivial for an interdictor to decloak it before it can burn out of the bubble or back to gate, and then as long as the dictor has a friend with high dps or webs, the hauler will be dead.
---
This is why jump freighters are used for nullsec logistics, you never know if that one random guy in local is actually a cloaked sabre, and his friend/alt in a vindicator might be safelogged right next to him, at login screen.
---
They are both decent squad role ships.  The dragoon is a bit obvious, so I'll skip it.  The coercer is good at reaching out and touching things with goodly amounts of very accurate damage.  
---
The closest historical analogue is pikemen vs swordmen.  Formation is everything.
---
When piloting such a ship, disregard what is near you for the moment, and target what is orbiting your allies.  It's a very good ship for quickly piling damage onto ships that already have a firing solution.  
---
That pretty much holds constant for all laser ships.  They work best when you are supporting your allies.  They aren't always the fastest ships, but you can generally force the opponent to approach one segment of your forces initially, or divide their forces, as you should each be maneuvering closer to your respective optimals rather than converging.  This requires a bit of Amarrian discipline.  
---
You can use your greater accuracy at middling range, along with keeping your own forces over a wider area, in order to limit the options of those who seek even greater range.  When fighting ranged foes, a ship that needs to disengage need only to fly back to and past allies in order to compromise the hostile kite.
---
Both of them are mediocre at exploration.
---
Most important thing that a new player can do to get started well is follow this link and go through the process (which generally takes a few days of waiting).

---
Join faction war. You earn LP while solo pvping and you can do it as an alpha. It will also give you the opportunity to fly in militia fleets.
---
I haven’t found faction war to be that profitable tbh
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University)
---
Join that corp. Best thing that a new player can do. Every other corp which claims to cater to new players is either a scam or will get you sucked into the politics of the game's player factions before you have any idea what's going on. The process generally takes at least a few days.
---
Answer: It is extremely vital.

He is right fanboi idiot

Gotta make a momument at molea...
---
New Eden has atmosphere in space.
---
  I gank miners, and i also produce T2 mining equipment and sell it to them.
---
It helps if you are fighting for the side that has the tier 5 status going.
---
Another option that might be fun is getting a couple of friends and run low level frigate Abyssals.
---
At least someone posts good thing about EVE!
---
That is definitely their intention. People are just so used to how it has been and to be fair its a huge pain in the ass change.

Acquire a Titan BPO, build said titan.

All while trying to acquire every BPO I can
---
It is a shitty way to develop the game.  It does not make the game any more fun or interesting.  It just makes it more tedious.   which if you are trying to get people to stick around, is not a good idea.
---
Got a house. Got a girlfriend. Working on house. Trying to up my income. The usual

The trouble is once you cut something from the budget  to save time and money in a recently acquired company, its hard to justify its business case to BDO overlords if it doesn't generate income.
---
oh yay....more citadel spam lol
---
What i took from your comment is that it shouldn't have been made more expensive to JF stuff. And you are being angry and entitled about it without looking at how much worse it could have been.
---
Yes, transport is getting harder. Therefore, shipping services will start to charge more. That's how markets work.
---
I always felt that EVE was super anti-social and never understood the point of cynos (or at least what may have been CCP's original intention). You're supposed to have friends. You get friends to light cynos for you. That's how normal people operate. I suspect that at some point this just flew over everyone's head and they just made multiple accounts.
---
Can't you still burn a bomber and bridge a covert hauler
---
Imo every character should have p2 setups on 2-3 planets, which is easy to setup and manage every few days. Max skills on a dedicated character producing 1-2 p3 is much more profitable. Spent 5 minutes a day restarting all your extractors, move resources around every 3-4 days to your production planet, and I'm getting 50-100 mil a week. It's not enough to plex an account but all I do is whelp frigs anyway
---
heres the thing man a lot of people are gonna say yeah dude go for it you can fly this t1 frigate but its slightly more complicated than that
---
the gameplay is punishing - its hard to learn from your mistakes because people abuse a lot of game knowledge that you wont understand for awhile, so it really comes down to the type of player you are  
---
if youre a pvp person it might be an ok game to start out if you can hack it - like seven years ago i'd have said "give it three months and you'll probably be hooked" now, i dont really know. it depends on what you  like to do  and whether or not you  find a good corporation. chances are, if you're into pvp shit - you're probably going to hate this game right now and burn out because the meta is *so stale and stagnant*.  
---
if youre a pve person, you'll love the game right now. this is literally all people want to do. theres like 100 good/dogshit tier alliances out there you can join and  rat all day long, mine all day long, and build all day long. you might die every now and again but its irrelevant.
---
Its eve

Dont

---
Eve uni, Karma fleet, Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbie, etc are your newbie corps with hundreds of members based out of null sec. If you want a more personal touch and hands holding to learn the game. They all have smaller corporations within their alliance that give you the feeling of being in a small friend group while having access to all the benefits of an alliance(logistics, active players, market)
---
Or you can also find some low sec/high sec corp. one way to look for them is in r/evejobs
---
Almost everyone started eve missioning/mining in high sec, as much as people tell you go straight to null sec, personally I think it is important to at least experience what it feels like before moving to null newbie corp directly
---
Yes, you can join and leave whenever you want. If you don't leave one Corp for another one directly, you'll just drop back down to an NPC Corp.
---
You can also create your own with the right skills. And you can try to join an Alliance if they'll have you.
---
There are Recruitment chat channels in game. I agree, the Corp search function is garbage. If it doesn't crash your game as soon as you open it (b/c it immediately tries to load every Corp in existence at once), then it's a nightmare to navigate.
---
Weapons will still have deviation problems, mechanical part movement, shaking, manufacturing flaws. Unless they were perfectly designed. At some point I imagine the projectile would veer off in a direction that wasn't intentional. 
---
Now, I'm no physicist but as far as I know space isn't exactly a void. There's all sorts of particles and energy whizzing through space(plus gravitational forces however slight they might be). I'm not sure entirely if an object in space would fly in the same direction indefinitely.
---
Please bring your SF to a quix camp.   
---
That would be hilarious.
---
Thank you very much, I'll open the channel.
---
Thank you, I'll probably stick around high-sec for a while.
---
JF are the cancer. This is a dose of chemo
---
Not even sure I trust my own cyno alts.  
---
Shifty bastards.
---
he's right though.
---
Both! ;)
---
I simply get bored of all the "I am too lazy to do shit in a game" posts. 
---
They made you put in a little more effort to jump your freighter, so what? Fucking adapt to that change and don´t come crying here and call people retarded when they see no problem with that change. Every single JF pilot is affected by that change in the same way, and they simply adpated. You are just lazy.
---
This change opens up new buisness opportunities and interactions between players. Which is a good thing!
---
damn you're saying it takes work to teleport huge amounts of shit all over the universe?
---
sucks dawg
---
&gt;it fixes none of the major issues with cynos
---
It's not intended to.
---
hard core from no handlebars + some lowsec refugees, aiming to achieve the nirvana of being a tryhard cocaine fueled 3lite gam3r lowsec brawler
---
So good.
---
"Y WON T CEE CEE PEE ANSWR EVRY NECKBEARD SALTY COMMENT ON WEDDIT REEEEE"
---
way back when i started doing cyno logistic 
---
we had friends light cynos.  
---
move things via carriers and dreads as a team. 
---
It sounds social but it turned out to be a pain in the ass less than gate to gate logistic most of the time. -But if 1 person wasn't in place or didn't trun up it could much over so many people thus the cyno alt came to be.
---
also when you had your "friends" do cyno you could end up on the wrong side of a gank/awox
---
I used to regularly run PushX JF contracts. I'd normally have to route new cynos out along the path usually all shit holes filled with bored people.
---
Getting a nuerus there occasionally was a pain. I used these for God knows why but they worked the best when super high tank was not needed for cynos (poidon).
---
Wasn't a big deal at all. The most dangerous part of JFs is high sec. It's not even close. The amount if time and effort in HS dodging guy with 20 accounts open hunting jfs in high is way more time consuming, annoying and boring than these cyno changes.
---
Look at who’s talking
---
5 days ago was the tenth anniversary of [this absolute beast](https://youtu.be/zSgiXGELjbc) thank you for reminding me of it
---
Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Aideron Robotics, Templis CALSF, and The Rogue University are all new player corps that are pretty good, although tbh Horde is the only one I have personally been in, so I can't be 100% certain about the others, except brave, I know they are good
---
Alright, I'm just staying in Hi-Sec until I get used to the basic mechanics and then I'll be heading to null-sec
---
BuTTe TaPi
---
Looks expencive. Also you can do jumps not same systems over and over, but a different onces so its wont work then.
---
So here's some interesting information from the developers of the most "hard science" space combat game there is, 
---
[children of a dead earth](https://childrenofadeadearth.wordpress.com)
---
Contrary to popular belief, (Lasers do lose focus over distance through diffraction, which is a quantum phenomena)[https://childrenofadeadearth.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/the-photon-lance]. You know how the Apollo project astronauts left a laser reflector on the moon? Well, the laser beam we send at it is around 2km wide by the time hit hits the reflector. 
---
When missiles run out of propellant, they can no longer maneuver, which turns them into big slugs going in a straight line. If the target accelerates at all, the missile will miss the target since it can no longer adjust course to account for enemy acceleration. The amount that the remaining fuel can change the missile's velocity vector is known as Delta-V. Missiles, being less complicated and expensive than ships, almost always use some sort of simpler, less efficient propulsion like simple chemical thrusters, while ships have more complex and efficient propulsion (in EVE it's some [sort of EM engine powered by a reactor](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/inventory.php?group_id=334)), so the "range of a missile" might be the effective range before the missile propellants burn out and has no more delta-V remaining while the target ship is still maneuvering. 
---
In a similar sense, Minmatar projectiles are all supposed to be rocket assisted in lore, which means that after the rocket assist runs out, there's no more delta-v for the shell to correct course and hit the target.
---
Blasters you can say the plasma containment field dissipates over distance.
---
I got nothing as far as railguns go.
---
Weapons having limited range isn't "unrealistic", the issue is that these things happen at much closer ranges than they should be. also non-laser turret weapons are all instantaneous when they should't be considering the distances involved.
---
We have a new high sec corp for people that want to start off a little more slowly into corp life instead immediately heading to null sec.
---
https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/corps/brave-empire/start
---
https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/corps/brave-empire/how-to-apply
---
Krabs have pincers so this makes a lot of sense
---
Who?
---
High sec escalations can lead you to low sec sites. Was running 6/10 sansha sites in a confessor and made 450m in one of them. It's not as consistent isk as missions but getting a rare/expensive drop is a lot of fun.
---
Hey maybe I will see you out there. I fully expect to just get dropped on every single time. That or get out ranged by kitey response fleets ( I mean why wouldn't you ). If I get one good fight out of 100 I'll be happy
---
Command ships all depend on the fleet doctrine,   For example some fleets we will use command destroyers,  some times T3 cruisers with the command module and sometimes we use command ships such as the vulture,  it all depends on which doctrine the fleet is flying at the time.
---
Command destroyers are great as they are cheap and give the option to jump the fleet around if needed.
---
The thing about that, is "learning the basic mechanics" by yourself, just by reading, could take you months. 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Manual_piloting
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile_mechanics
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Turret_mechanics
---
And that's just the basics on how to fly your ship, and how your guns work. If you're actually playing in a corp, then you can ask questions on voice comms and get simplified explanations that still cover everything. What I'm basically saying is, you won't learn everything, or really anything, without someone to ask questions of. And while the rookie help channel is ok, it has nothing compared to joining a new player q&amp;a/ratting fleet with a bigger alliance, and making some isk while asking questions of the more experienced people who are running it. Even if you don't have a mic (although you should get one), you can type questions in fleet and listen to other people's, and you'll still learn much faster than you would in hisec by yourself.
---
Reboot PFR!
---
1.) Eve Reddit does not provide an adequate representation of the status of the game. A minority of loudmouths infect the entire sub. 
---
2.) Join a new player Corp. I'd recommend Eve uni. There are various others. Do some reading.
---
3.) Even if you don't join check out the eve University YouTube channel. I listened to all the lectures- some multiple times. Another good resource is Jurius Doctor on YouTube. He has his own channel. You might get slightly dated info but generally speaking you can apply the info to the current game well.
---
This thread has a lot of angry cunts in it .
---
Ships are just a form of ammo. You will lose a lot of them. Learn from each death ( joining a corp and having friends help you ) and try to not repeat the same mistakes. 
---
If you are pvping, recording your fights with OBS and going back to see what happened or what you could do better is a good way to learn.
---
Are they blue to snuff?
---
Training 3 toons
---
So after p3 it gets better to use multiple planets to produce a single component and then less passive since you need to move stuff between planets?
---
My end goal was to find people to play with.  A group I could form bonds with and actually feel like I was part of something.  Then I joined a group and the guy ended up being a piece of shit and the entire thing fell a part rather rapidly.  Now I'm not actually playing the game because I have to wait for skills train up.  I could try and get ISK to buy injectors, but that just doesn't seem fun to me.  Apparently this game isn't a game for being social and having fun in.  If you aren't part of a big alliance and shit posting constantly for them, then you aren't a true member.  I just want some people to chill and shoot stuff with, that's my real goal.
---
What is it that makes it like this? I assume having to move stuff between planets?
---
Well, it wouldn't have been a problem if people hadn't screamed bloody murder about jumping to covert cynos. 
---
And it might not be a popular opinion but I think logistics has gotten too easy with them.  Jump Freighters pretty much nullified most of space, distance, time and danger in nullsec when regards to transportation.  This cyno change should have JF pilots thanking their lucky stars that it wasn't 10x worse.
---
Remove ya tinfoil lad. You realise 90% of players never leave hisec? 
---
I've never seen this corp before but it's a safe bet its one of those annoying ass corps that spams invites to everyone in newbro systems. (spoiler: if you're a newbro, don't join these corps. They're all garbage) 
---
If anyone has evidence to suggest otherwise obviously the above is invalid but until then I'd say this is a standard feed of newbros having no idea what they're doing. Carry on.
---
:)
---
&gt; The amazing part is how long / equal fight this has been given the big disparity in numbers even before batphoning happens. The disparity becomes even larger after batphones.

I mean, timezone tanking is a thing.

My goal is to get gud at PI
---
Hey friend! most P2 is able to be made on a single planet. So no moving anything around. P3 and P4 require moving things from one or two planets, usually to a planet that just factories to build the P3 and P4 stuff. I have mine set up just to do P2 and it's really easy just pick things up once a week or every 2 weeks. There's a great video on getting started with PI on Brave Dojo Youtube channel if you're interested in a more indepth tutorial. [https://youtu.be/2Xlxc6-r7Js](https://youtu.be/2Xlxc6-r7Js)
---
A day, I swear if my job only let me play a couple hours a month I'd be gone already haha
---
Appreciated thanks.
---
As I had posted on the other comment, you can make P2 on a single planet (mostly). P3 and P4 require moving things around more often and more time-intensive.
---
Give it a try. Look at english recruitment, find some chill nerds to play space with. Make sure your corp is online when you are. Avoid the negativity here.
---
"""solo"""
---
Im in one of those corps tho.
---
We make sure to get people set up and on fleets. These characters arent new. If you looked deeper in their corp history they can field naga fleets.... but still wtf?
---
Imagine you have no idea how pvp works other than there is a correlation between turning your guns on and the other ship dying,now you are the CEO of a Corp recruiting anyone who will accept.
---
It's basically blind leading the blind in a lot of HS newbie corps
---
:pray:

It's less a science fail, than a science simplification.  If you were talking real world application you would have a lot of things compounding your shots.

* Projectile weapons fire a solid object that has mass. This mass will be affected by every single dense object in the system, because they all are manipulating gravity -or- in a better sense, they are each a gravity well to differing degrees.  So imagine a bowling alley with dozens of small and large dips and valleys and folds.  Now make this stretch over a hundred kilometers. Now, you are trying to predict your shot at another object while you are also moving. You have an object moving on three planes at a target which is moving on three planes. All the time, the gravitational eddies are leaching momentum while also possibly sling shotting it off course in infinitely small amounts. Now, the longer the distance the more chance that this target can make a course correction to avoid the shot. Because even with an extremely powerful propellant, you aren't getting a projectile (or rail weapon) to be an instant hit weapon.
---
* Missile weapons will suffer very similar course deviations as a projectile. They will also travel much slower, meaning a higher chance for the target to change course repeatedly to evade. Granted they can correct course, but they are limited in reaction mass (fuel).  Missiles outside of extremely short range ultra high yield weapons will probably disappear from arsenals for a long time until technology allows for a missile with it's own form of inertial or hyper drive to accelerate at a much higher rate to impact a target.
---
* Energy weapons (the type in this game) are direct impact weapons. They are focused coherent light. There is a whole lot of research indicating gravity does impact light, however at a range of 100km? Probably not much. This game scales down the overall ranges for simplicity. What would greatly impact a laser would be the vast amounts of particulates in space. There is a general assumption that space is empty, wide and open. It's not. There are trillions of molecules of ice and water and mass.  All of this would act to absorb/deflect a direct energy weapon the further the range. Additionally, as the game shortens ranges for easy consumption- in real world application, further ranges would great some issues when attempting to target at something far enough out that a weapon traveling at or near c (light speed) it would still take several seconds or minutes to arrive and could be dodged. Additionally, a battle sphere such as space at longer distances would allow for the usage of chafe like clouds specifically designed to deflect and reflect energy weapons for a fraction of the cost and hard to defeat for a non kinetic energy weapon (plasma).
---
TL:DR - Distance and gravity would have a tremendous impact.
---
Why should you be free to cyno shit onto your enemies doorstep? I'm still not seeing a problem with the increased logistics load.
---
Yes we need every new bro we can get
---
a couple hours a day is more than i hear from a lot of people who have 'severely restricted time slots to play.'
---
Community stuff is always hard to quantify, but I think PA have a great respect for the EVE Community teams opinion on things.  
---
Fingers crossed
---
If that is the case, then why have CCP made certain materials regional specific?
---
R8/32 moongoo is extremely specific to regions of 0.0, essentially the same distribution as isotopes (which are also regionally specific).
---
If CCP's goal was to make things be produced locally, that's fine. BUT, in order to do so, they need to have a way to produce all materials LOCALLY.
---
The current situation does not allow for that to happen.
---
If you want to nerf JFs and make logistics much more difficult, fine. Then have a roughly even distribution of isotopes, and all Moongoo. They arent doing that.
---
If you do not make the materials roughly all available everywhere in 0.0, logistic connections and a hub system are needed and will naturally form. A Jita location will appear, at the crossroads of the available markets.
---
All these changes are doing are benefiting the larger groups, who have the dedicated logistic supply lines (in both the movement of materials, and the network of people buying/selling the items in their home space). They can weather a spiked increase in supply costs, They'll just pass it on to the end consumer. The smaller groups do not have those network of buyers/sellers of materials, and dont have the supply lines that you'd need to keep a trade like that functioning.
---
Or Ikoskio, Akidagi, etc.
---
Ppl keep saying I'm salty, can you please tell me what I have to be salty about? I/we have no stake in that war. We simple went there cause it was the hottest content spot at that moment and we had some good fun killing supers and rorqs and then fucked off. I'm simply memeing about Vily's need to post every other day to stroke his ego.
---
Sounds like you've never actually moved anything for an alliance, or any significant logistics capacity via your own JF.
---
Why would CCP get rid of JFs using cynos if you cant produce everything locally? (Moongoo and isotopes).
---
For recruiters or for recruits?
---
C2 sites can be run in a Gila, so a shield Stratios can probably handle them with maybe a little bling. I think you can get a Gila to do C3 sites, but I'd probably recommend upgrading to a battleship for those.
---
You may just generally benefit from looking at [Rykki's Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#)
---
Honestly, you’re probably safer in Null Sec mining with Rorquals on the field. They have the ability to make you invulnerable for a few minutes until until whatever is shooting you eats shit to a bunch of titans.
---
I think you're in the wrong thread, but just in case: What's your question?
---
How about a new sis?
---
Thank you
---
Now is as good a time to start as any. Just understand that there is a steep curve....and you will get out of it what you put into it.
---
all loot to PERUNGA
---
The lack of comments should tell you everything you need to know.
---
Eve and ED have nothing in common besides space. Elite is a flight sim, and while Eve is a whole lot of things, flight sim is not one of them.
---
Yeah I manage to get a fairly long break at work to play something and  obviously days off I can play more but i usually I'll be interrupted during those couple hours
---
It still has space battles, trading, exploration and factions... sounded fairly similar to me and I dont care much whether its third of first person
---
How's this different from any other /r/eve thread? :P
---
Honestly, outside of some VERY niche builds, you'll want to use the gun type that gets bonuses from the ship.
---

Can't find a complete BR, but just from that it looks like you guys were the ones feeding fleets, lol
---
But look, they're isk positive. :3
---
&gt; R8/32 moongoo is extremely specific to regions of 0.0, essentially the same distribution as isotopes (which are also regionally specific).
---
That could create an interesting dynamic. Maybe ships that favor local minerals will be cheaper while those from the other end of space are a bit more expensive.
---
Agency? I just use the dedicated Planet button on the left....
---
Just a thought, why not make a limit to number of objects that can jump to a cyno? Make cyno skill increase it by 100% per level, basic cyno that can fit on anything only allow 1 then the large scale ones that are limited to recon and blops have a base of 50. Covert cyno sits around 10, which would still allow for gank squads.
---
Add on that you cant light a cyno within 10km of another cyno and you have a recipe that would allow for drops but not infinite escalation.
---
Nerd assumes anyone that disagrees with his viewpoint is TEST. Keep factionalizing, retard. I've already moved on.
---
np friend
---
They have 280 kills not just one.
---
I've played both and there are similarities. The market/trading is much more complex. And it feels more rewarding since what you are selling is going to other players. Mining is more boring in EVE, but it's more reliable. (No core mining in Eve) Combat is more bland. You can't target subsystems in Eve.) The combat is more varied though. There is no solo mode in Eve, possible positive and negative, depending. 
---
All that being said, Eve has a lot more to do if you can set your own goals.
---
Sounds not worth the effort
---
I'm about to start nomading through j-space with an orca.
---
But in Eve, you don't exactly fly your ship.  Think of it more as commanding the ship.  ...and building it.  ...and financing it.  ...and doing the taxes for the crew.  ...and everywhere you go, everyone wants to kill you just for the lols.  
---
I play both.  You'll see; besides being in space, the two are nothing alike at all.  I'm not saying that you won't enjoy it, just to not expect to understand Eve based on ED.
---
just what eve needs, more pointless tedious bullshit, thats exactly whats gonna fix everything
---
definitely
---
To expand on above, there really isn't an end-game.  It is open world.  The only thing holding you back are your skills (in-game training, not your personally ability).  After just a few days, you can be doing what some would consider end-game content, just not in the big ships that require months of training.
---
The real question is what you want to do.  It is truly an open sandbox.  If you can think it and the game mechanics will allow it, you can do it.
---
[Here are some of the things you can do.](https://www.thealphasguide.com/images/wtd.jpg)
---
Right, because they're not already 8b loot piniatas
---
... but everyone is angry because we've become reliant on local production. In fact, we're usually exporting because of surplus production
---
I always thought that hull tank was the only way to fit a hecate. Thank you for showing me otherwise.
---
Space battles:
---
Elite, this is all about very small scale and reaction based.
---
In Eve, while combat skill is important, what's more important is gathering information, trying to keep the enemy from having perfect intel on you, so that you can be prepared to counter them, or bait them. This is true on every scale, from very small scale stuff where you need to tailor your 5 man gang specifically to the enemy comp to big stuff like the battle for L4X early this year. 
---
Background on L4X. Test Alliance is invading Geminate, the home of Pandemic Horde. In order to do this, they want to be able to drop capitals in the middle of horde space, without having to midpoint (capitals can jump to cyno beacons in other systems, but only if the system is so close to them), so they deployed a structure that capitals could dock at in Geminate. If it on lined successfully, it would allow them to drop capital ships anywhere in Geminate at a moment's notice, obviously a huge advantage. So, it started on-lining one, and scouted Horde and its allies, and saw that they didn't seem to be forming very hard. Their plan was to force Pandemic Horde to commit, and then drop a bunch of capitals onto the horde dreadnought fleet, and to destroy a large amount of pandemic horde ships and ideally protect the structure too. However, what happened was that as soon as Test committed its capitals, Horde and its allies undocked Titans, the biggest class of ship (supercapital) in the game and one very well suited for killing normal capitals, and dropped them on top of Test's capital fleet. The structure died, along with 300 or so Test dreadnoughts. This battle ended the invasion of Geminate, soon after it all the other Test structures were destroyed without a fight. All because Horde intelligence knew what Test was planning, and Test didn't know what horde was planning, and was baited into dropping their entire deployed capital (Test had a significantly stronger capital and supercaptial that they left behind in their home, and only brought normal capitals on the invasion) into a trap. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlV-Grsy_fM) is a video on it.
---
So yeah, skill does matter, but in the end a lot of Eve fights are decided by who has better intelligence.
---
Trading:I actually don't know too much about trading in Elite, I just played it a bit for some space dogfighting. But, I'll just explain trading in eve, b/c I seriously doubt Elite is all that similiar.
---
Trading in Eve, after all, is not buying stuff from npcs to sell to other npcs. Usually it isn't even about getting stuff yourself and selling it to other players, a lot of what is known as trading is buying stuff from players to flip for a profit. This can mean playing .01 isk games with people and just trying to get stuff dumped to buy orders, or it can mean manipulating the market by buying out everything and then jacking up the prices, or it can be moving stuff from hubs to your alliance's staging system, and selling it there, where people will pay a markup for convenience. You'll still have to lower the price by .01 isk every so often to beat out the other moron who is doing the same thing as you, though. It could also be reading patchnotes right as they come out, and speculating on the market based on that. I know people who made tons of money from the last few changes (blackout, cynos, undoing blackout) just by being one of the first to realize what was going on. The main difference, I guess, is trading in Eve is not pve, it is pvp. Nothing is blowing up, but you are fighting other players to buy things at the lowest prices and sell at the highest. 
---
Exploration:Tbh, there isn't much to explore in Eve. At first there's a lot, but after a while you've seen everything, and even a new wormhole system can be reduced to a set of percentage bonuses and debuffs applied to your ship, with connections that always lead to the same class of space, and the same sites spawning as every other wormhole of its class. Nullsec is only interesting for seeing old monuments, like the wreck of Steve or the Titanomachy in B-R, but not many people just fly around it to explore. Exploration in Eve is normally used to mean looking for scannable sites to find loot in them, but I wouldn't call that exploration in the sense that you are exploring and finding new stuff.
---
Factions:Eve factions are going to be very different than pretty much every other game. If its not obvious why, read [this](http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/1044004/Groen_-_Empires_of_Eve.html). (Or just read it anyway because its very interesting)
---
If you are in corporation that is doing large and mids ale pvp then ask your officer's what to skill. If you just doing public fleets and stay in Highsec, then maybe train something else first?
---
Because for command BC you need the boosters trained as well and it is a very specific roll in a fleet. In small scale it is taken by the fc or a vet. As a player of one year experience focus on doing damage, or logistics, or tackle. And train that role skill wise and flying the ship..
---
Fly safe
---
Can't get everything needed locally. Also have a surplus of products locally
---
Did you miss the "/s" :)
---
This change made some sense in that it may have balanced hunters and hunted. But with blackout gone, this is just a massive QoL dump on logistics people for no real gain.
---
Gateflash m8
---
Factional warfare is waste , i have tried it once jus sitting on locations and warping out or doing pvp on it is boring, what i meant was ccp gives a notification that a big war is starting and if we guys participate we can get rewards based on the contribution , for example null sec level war from npc in factional area and whole game gets notification like the invassion that come and participate to get rewards. Those small level factional warframe stuff is just a way to get willing pvp pilots nothing else
---
Indeed, but what was the point of all this. It just made it more of a chore to set up those cyno points, but did it really balance anything, other than making us do a bit more work?
---
And sometimes its in russian.
---
Don't have time to deal with the tedium. I have a job.  And other responsibilities.
---
All this did was add an extra step for indy toons. Do you think this really balanced anything? It just added more work, for no reason.
---
Good times.
---
k
---
Thats the point factional warfare is a boring mechanism, so much more can be done with it , as i see factional warfare ios jus ttrying to find willing pvpers and just sitting on boxes. best would be to send notification that capital level / nullssec level 1000V1000 fight will happen in factional warfare between npc and you are welcome to help them with rewards based on contribution. give low sec and high sec ppl a chance to fight in big fights without going into null sec
---
How so? JF seeds 20 indy ships at each location. Done. And with those passive nereuses, good luck getting them ad hoc.
---
I think you're overestimating the hurdle, and underestimating the tedium needed to overcome said hurdle. Tedium is logi people's middle name, so they'll do it. Doesn't make it a good idea though - adding a chore when there is no benefit from it.
---
I wanted covert cyno jfs as an option tho. :(
---
Then don't fucking jump freighter.
---
It's broken as fuck and whoever doesn't think so really ain't thinking.
---
 Are you new or silly m
---
I suppose you \_could\_ win the prize for the most 'interesting' collection of non-sequitur reasons to quit Eve :)
---
Please take this post and email it to CCP. Then delete it.
---
They are mostly dying to rats. Its just players who probably don't know how to play well, dying to rats and trying to learn. Nothing out of the ordinary here.
---
Hey man, I've played a lot of ED and even more Eve. If you can get over the fact that you don't manually pilot your ship like you do in ED, this game is great. It definitely feels alive, instead of the millions of empty systems you would find in ED. Give it a shot!
---
Cov ops and bombers cost 500m, gotcha
---
Test is the player "faction" where even at the highest levels of leadership and in general have an a certain amount of inability of not telling someone they know any piece of sekrit info they might be aware. In practice this means anything told to test is public knowledge sooner than later - feature of test that has been used in these intel warfare shenanigans before.
---
Every time I make a new alt I get invited into Conoco within a few minutes ))
---
Bombers can't turn on a cyno. Only black ops, and force recons can. Black ops = 900,000,000 isk ship. Force recon = 500,000,000. What's there to understand?
---
Nope. Just made it so people "need" yet another account to do what they were doing before
---
It added more risk, which means more profits for those who adapt.
---
Then that failed entirely. When blackout happened, null cut exports to Jita. Null was already self sufficient, and the only things we needed from Jita that we couldn't source from allies was literally drone salvage/ drone officer mods. If they wanted to make null not reliant on Jita they already succeeded
---
Maybe you have too many miners and industrial players? There might be a sweet spot.
---
Star Blazers 2199 anime
---
And if a certain region has the materials to easily produce the ship your group favours maybe you should invade and set up in that region. Imagine game mechanics encouraging conflict over unique geographical positions.
---
How constructive of you.
---
The inertia of people expecting total safety and ease is way higher than CCP had thought, look at what blackout did.
---
We were already self sufficient. The only things we couldn't source from our allies in null were drone salvage, and drone officer mods. Blackout solidified this, as you'd know if you listened to the firesides. Cyno changes are just to force us to subscribe another alt.
---
I want to see EvE become even greater than it was in the past. I want to take part in the lore, seeking out the ancient mysteries of New Eden and uncovering secrets that were buried for millennia. I want to learn as much as I can about this amazing universe and keep playing until I go old and gray, never losing the love I have for it.
---
To be fair, I think it's safe to say my ability holds me back sometimes :/
---
I see loging in the game hit you a bit hard on the nerve
---
you have come to right place capsuleer, keep on shitposting
---
So what's your position? That teleporting stuff around the map should be easier?
---
If this is legit, report it to CCP, buying 200 bil is not easy to do without leaving a pretty obvious trail behind.
---
Wow were you going for the petty complaint record or something?
---
A botting corp in frats botting alliance tries to accuse others of rmt? :bigthonk:
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
2,000 bil you mean, in other words 2 trillion.
---
I think you might want to read up on this groups history on the other server before making that call.
---
Neither. I'm aware of the whole meme that ideas here won't be read or even considered.
---
Yeah, typo. Point is, if this really happened, and it gets reported to CCP, they will find it and take the isk back. You can’t be stealthy when moving that much money
---
What to do when a shitbird accuses a shitbird of being a shitbird? Who do I believe?
---
We're talking about covert cynos
---
FRAT uses bots to make ISK then sells it to AOM for real money right ? Thank for the proof. Now CCP does your fking job. Ban both FRAT and AOM. Easy ?
---
This is incredibly in depth thanks and way better than I was expecting with regards to how the game is. I'll definitely be giving it a shot and making my jump
---
Skimmed the corps join/leave history and it lines up accurately with my above explanation, obviously there are outliers that have been in for longer than others.
---
Good on them for at one point apparently attempting to field proper fleets. I fail to see what's "wtf" about this as no ones gonna know how to properly fit their stuff or coordinate fleets with no experience.
---
Good job on the newbros who realised what happened after they joined and left, presumably to find a better corp that will actually teach them something, whether that's in hisec or not.
---
agree, CCP should ban all Chinese alliances use BOT and RMT
---
You post  spidermanclone.jpg meme and farm  some Karma
---
I take it as absolute win
---
Those should lose cov ops cyno also.
---
Far as I'm aware, bombers can't light a covert cyno either, but I basically never fly a nemesis even though I can
---
&gt;agree, CCP should ban all ~~Chinese~~ alliances use BOT and RMT
---
FTFY
---
It's much more elitist and it was pretty dangerous until recently.
---
i created a few years back the dps hull tank build another pilot i know made it famous in fw there is 5 power builds for the hecate that is one of them thanks for the feedback 
---
much love
---
ED: You're a pilot. You are in direct control of everything. Eve: You're the captain who tells the pilot what to do. Your actions are more like orders given to a crew, though it isn't really portrayed as such outside of the lore. Let them concentrate on aiming and following orders while you micromanage them and keep an eye on the big picture.
---
That only works partially. Because people are only interested in paying certain amount of markup over Jita...
---
It also means that regions further away will be less supplied and thus less action all together... Sure, some things might get produced locally because of imports costs, but that doesn't work with T2 stuff, faction/deadspace stuff setting up infrastructure is a pain in the ass etc...
---
My position is that with all the jump fatigue, it already made it so hard to engage, that everyone has docked up. Cyno changes make this even harder, and only cause more docking up. We want fights. You'd see massive Titan and supercapital losses if cynos were still viable, and jumping worked the old way, where we could get a fleet anywhere in a reasonable time
---
Why the sudden change?
---
well its Q4 and i think we know
---
Ha, finally! Incontrovertible proof that the other chinese alliance is the real home of botters and RMT!
---
nah, just need to do moar capital stuffz, but null is too stagnant.
---
we didn't get thunderdome for months
---
i just assume the AT is done. the 20 killmark leshak holds a place of honor in my jita hangar.
---
That's all fine when you only use basic stuff or your coalition spans 1/3 of the universe. Good luck making anything besides T1 hulls with meta stuff if you are a relatively small alliance on far away regions...
---
Nice one, now I understand EVE universe a little bit more 🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Very very spicy meme, thanks for posting.
---
you should fix your awareness
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
Industrial , covert or normal cyno who cares just light it get it covered by pvp ships while lit and move on the time it took you to write this post was enough to setup your cyno chain.
---
The absolute best one for new players to join expects people to leave and join some other corporation at some point.
---
&gt;I just like to tell other gamers that I play EVE, while looking down on them with superiority, as the inferior peasants that they are.
---
This is the only real reason to play EVE.
---

---
chinese RMTing in 2019
---
say it aint so
---
What means this "reee" all the time?
---
me
---
You got 2 sides to this argument. 
---
The one that says every time I light a cyno I will loose a cov ops ship costing me lots of isk. 
---
And the other side saying it will make moving a JF super safe. 
---
I am with the second one. But the group of people that are with the first point cried out and they got this shitty alternative. I have a hard time feeling sorry for JF pilots.
---
Also 100% safe to move around except for your cyno alt.
---
Then I would recommend you choose a P3 based on your planet types, train the pi skills to IV/IV, and extract from 12 planets to run three factory planets, pick up every 4 days from extraction planets, diliver/pick up from the factory planets every other day and you will make 1.8B to 2.4B a month.
---
This is my setup 2x in a C3 and I make about the top end (2x) of what I quoted you.
---
&gt; 1dq market is generally cheaper than Jita because we are self sufficient
---
This isn't really true, 1DQ is usually considerably more expensive for everything that isn't an ice product, a capital ship, or compressed ore. This is mainly due to lower volume making the market less competitive, which is great for the seller but higher prices for the buyer.
---
Not being able to spread out the industry as much due to the much higher relative cost of bulk freight also means that the manufacturing of Delve is concentrated in far fewer systems than the area around Jita, which spikes the system cost index. Moving your stuff 4 jumps out of Jita to a low index system isn't a problem in highsec since you can gate a freighter, If you don't have a freighter you contract to redfrog. In null it's a JF round trip, if you don't have a JF you use a JF service and that can cost a pretty penny.
---
What risk? Something you close close to 100% of the time is a cost, not a risk. All that changed is that ~1.5 mil more is expended every jump for the industrial ship, the cyno, and the ozone.
---
Can someone dig out that old dev talking about russian billionaires buying plec for 100k plus
---
Whaling is a trend sport for chinese nerds I guess
---
once FRT shows 250＋ titian on their keepstar on last Friday, it proofs that this alliance is completely not RMT at all. Maybe there is BOT like  any other alliances but their goals is to playing this game which is completely different from the new serienty group AOM.
---
BTW this war started with CEO of Rebellion alliance (part of NC living in geminate) disbanding his alliance right before invasion, so this is how DRF captured first systems.
---
Was kind of sad for me as member of Rebellion, but today I can tell I miss this badass moves from past :)
---
spidermanclone.jpg
---
uh.... that's the biggest load of bullshit ive ever heard
---
Are you meaning to tell me that the Chinese RMT'd?
---
Yeah, because this doesn't hurt people who have established routes and run them frequently. The compressed minerals to build an indy and the indy cyno is like 75 M3, so once a route is established, all a JF pilot has to do is bring ~1000 M3 of compressed ore and drop off a bit at every mid and build some industrial. If you have enough people running the same route that guy can probably build all the industrials and cynos and just stick them in the corp hanger, take one out when you need and leave a tip.
---
If you need JF service that requires a new route, you are completely boned. The best option is probably an interceptor with compressed ore and an industrial BPC. Drop off the ore and build the industrial ship, which takes about 3 hours on a low skill alt. This change basically completely killed JF's on demand to lowsec, while doing not much against JF services that the blocs use. Goonswarm's JF service didn't even bother to raise rates.

Since goon members are saint kitties and dont wanna fight theyll just join Test and ez farm in eso
---
I was building Pi and then built fuel blocks out of it for a long time. Being in a null Alliance there was always a request for blocks
---
How so? The cost of an indy a million ISK or less, and once you've stockpiled a few, you're done. It added zero extra risk on top of what was there already. Unless I'm missing something obvious..
---
I know that for the last AT we kept hearing that Thunderdome would open up for practice at some point, eventually, but in the end it was all done on SISI because they couldn't get their shit together.
---
I can relate. I joined FW as an Alpha to get good at solo PVP. So I saved up 25 mil and spent it all on cheap T1 frigs. 
---
So far my experience has been mostly getting dunked on by gate camps, Nano fleets and pirate Frigs. The best fight I’ve had was was getting dunked on by a kiting Tristan. 
---
People say FW is a great place to start and learn PvP, but so far it looks like a great place to watch your ship get outclassed and then run out of money for PVP ships.
---
&gt;join a blob 
---
Hah .. there is that too. That was another realization I had with blackout - we needed more chars to set up things in the same way. Which, for people like me who play Eve on and off, was another reason to feel like things had become more of a chore.
---
Looks like Noraus wants to battle Vily in who makes the biggest wall of text

you can jump directly into lowsec from Jita thou.

Also the main reason the game is in its current state
---
There's been an influx of carebears the last 5 years or so. CCP introduced some changes to make the game more dangerous. The carebears threw a fit and unsubbed en masse. CCP rolled those changes back last week.

Praxis is cheap to buy, but expensive to lose.

Salt is a way of life?

There was this crazy thing we used to have to do before jump freighters and cyno's. We did a fleet op to escort freighters into hs to sell and restock. Other alliances tried to intercept us. Epic battles insued very often.    
---
We scouted. Camped their usual routes. Got camped in return. There was constant fighting just to run alliance logistics. It was a blast.      
---
I'm having fun in ls/wh but null has become completely worthless. It's more exciting living in HS and having wars than living in null. Still a great game but serious changes are needed. The fact that the blackout and cyno changes caused so much whining are proof. Your not supposed to be able to effortlessly travel around null with a few alts your plexing in mostly total safety.     
---
Here's hoping CCP continues to roll back carebear null.
---
maby i am just not invested enough in eve but i cant recognise the people talking just from the picture here, can anyone inform me who these people are and what excatly they say?
---
Or you could set things up differently. Like you'd have done before injectors.
---
if you dont know what you are talking about, why even bother, we are talking about cov ops cynos, cov ops cynos can be lit by covert ops/stealth bombers/force recons/t3's/black ops

a EVE cooking app with good recipes?

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Dunk, I'm sorry but this is an awful, awful idea.  It was created as a kneejerk, whiny reaction to blackout that's now gone.
---
It's time to bury this high sec shit.  You know there's nothing wrong with bringing newbies to null on day 2.
---
lol hf
---
wow casual, ALL of us learned chinese for the sake of decrypting those messages and relaying spy pings, get gud
---
What makes you think anyone cares what you dribble onto reddit?
---
You post like the edgy teenager you project onto other people and your username backs it up. Do yourself a favour and grow up.
---
you know there are 2 sides that are on the wrong in rmting, the selling and the buying side. Also AOM is like 5 months in the server and they have supers..

---
Maybe you guys can help me with a little bit of a problem. I got a dread on an alpha account logged off in a C2 wormhole (static high, static C3).
---
Does anyone know what will happen if i log in with an alpha in a ship that an alpha usually isn't allowed to fly? Is there any possibility to get it out there besides self destruct?
---
I already tried contacting the current inhabitants of said wh, but they don't seem interested in buying it or even answering...
---
Maybe the most fun would be to omega it and start reinforcing POCOs until someone blows it up...
---
I remember grinding exploration like a madlad in those days. I couldn't afford paying for my account so had to plex. Luckily plex was only about 600mil back then. I doubt it woulda been possible these days.

Don’t join Conoco.

Do you even fucking play the game
---
Unironically using the word "toxic" means you probably aren't the kind of person who will enjoy EVE, or the kind of person we want, to be honest with you.
---
Yeah thanks for that I ended up with a coercer and a thrasher but I'm usually ng them for the missions where you need to kill an enemy
---
Yeah I was wondering why. Ships are cheaper than most defences that's probably it
---
Ah well everyone else has been nice so far so there was always bound to be at least one of you being so negative. If this is the ratio of welcoming players versus the unwelcoming I'm totally up for EVE
---
Damn I got the coercer but I'm using it as my combat ship if I need it and for long distance or high value hauling
---
Will do thanks bud!
---
Ok will do
---
Wow so there literally is no better time than now to get into it then
---
Blue Donuts are my  favorite, right behind a good eclair.
---
2trill is nothing I get gifted that monthly.
---
I'm curious... what does a 2T ISK transaction cost in $'s ?  
---
Where does the $ come from? is one dude footing the bill? Does a group within the alliance cover it?
---
Yeah I only gave around 2 mil to spend
---
The age of pvp players is long gone. Sorry :(

What do you mean isk=tank

cyno camping is hilarious

you can't change my mind

Had this once on one of my accounts.

Fixed itself after DT.
---
Yeah, that BR  only has about an 1/8 of the systems involved champ, at least do a little research before shitposting. But you are forgiven, we all know wormholers live in their own little no-local reality. If u ever want to get good, come to null. I hear FRT is recruiting.

It would have if caprisunkraftfoods didn't int a muninns fleet warping 30 to bombers lmao.

&gt;EVE does not have drag in space.

It is not that easy and not like they do it with standard transactions.

I've been playing on and off since 2009, recently returned but haven't played regularly since 2016
---
Not looking to get back into null ATM, what's the best way of making isk outside of it? Would like to get back to being able to plex myself
---
I remember FW being profitable but I'm so far out of the loop I'm not sure where to start, is it a case of I'll just be grinding for my Plex each month and that's about it?

Cheers

You're like a guy who built a dam and is now complaining that the river dried up.

I am having great funs chasing the idea of being number one supplier of tech 3 ships for Jita. Started 5 months ago with 400M in capitas.
---
Currently producing around 1000 units per month, and i want to expand. I just have fun seing things line up and sending batchs after batches in Jita. Sometime i spy my buyers on zkill to see where my products end up dying.
---
Keep shooting space folks, i need to acquire more market shares !

Thank you dude, appreciate it!
---
5 bucks a bil max, so like $10k
---
Sure :)
---
If you get it when logging in, I don't know how to help you. If your launcher freezes at start up, delete your ccp registry with regedit
---
Its all lies if u actualy traslated and  read that its just two weirdos talking about cats fake news
---
Well, thats a matter of perspective, one which I dont agree with. For one, if PLEX goes up 25% and everything else goes down 50% and you spend the same amount of isk on both you still have more purchasing power. Secondly last numbers I saw for people who use PLEX are around 25% of the playerbase, making it into a non essential product.
---
And thirdly, its a product that gets affected more from out of game aspects than inside. It doesnt matter how little isk we have in the game if CCP never holds another PLEX sale. There is only so much we can control. PLEX started going up rather massively in price after skill injectors and aurum removal, basically applying too much pressure on one currency. This is what the issue is and sure, to a point it is in fact affected by faucets by thats not a bad thing. New players being able to buy skill injectors to catch up isnt bad, new accounts being made is not bad. 
---
PLEX is a very complicated issue which is why it shouldnt be used as an indicator for isk value and CCP can at any time change its value regardless of player interaction. But CCP makes more money if PLEX is expensive, it means more of it is used and the people who buy them get more value in isk thereby increasing its purchase volume from CCP. This very fact is why its a shitty indicator.
---
Thats why you have to use the CPI cause that tells us how much value your isk has. Can the ordinary person buy more or less today than last month. That tells us if we have inflation/deflation.
---
I'd first master and learn all the frigate and destroyer types. If you live in lowsec, it is worth flying T1 destroyers, in nullsec it is nit and the only worthy ones are the T3 hulls.
---
e
---
😂
---
Are you a child?
---
Yes but at the same time people wouldnt need to buy as many skill injectors. The million SP event means u need 2 less injectors which is actually quite a lot. If CCP gives out SP more often it will apply a downward pressure because less people will run farms since SP is cheaper and not worth it. The downside is that until the value of SP actually falls it will apply an upward pressure on PLEX cause of extractors.
---
And now blackout is gone.
---
They wont care. Fact is as its stands the china based Chinese arenteven legally allowed to play on tq. Theres a reason china had it's own server.
---
It us the kind if game that has not entry or exit points. There are no levels and there is always something to do even if you are a brand new player.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Paragon_Soul#adm
---
Players and ISK sell are connected. Surprised Piccachu.
---
Still, that graph shows us one very important thing - the golden era was around 2015, where the linea cross and it is about right.
---
Found mittens reddit alt
---
Regular cynos only on recons are fine. It doesn't solve thr Problems but outside of delve people think twice before lighting a cyno on a frigate I guess.
---
Just make Indu cyno fit to noobship again (and remove black ops being able to jump to it, like what the fuck kinda idea even was that) and we good.
---
And like there is no real endgame content the early game experience will also vary depending on player and year. 2019 new player experience is totally different from 2009. And it can be really fascinating if you don't mind being totally lost most of the time. And you can only experience it once. At least I had a blast back in the day.
---
Spent it all on blingy PvP ships
---
Join a null alliance you can make it in a day or two
---
Ban them all.
---
We had the fewest botters of any major power a year ago.  Nobody gave a shit and defended Frat and GotG.
---
Now, all of a sudden, Reddit gives a shit, but only about one side.  *thinking*
---
Are fraternity the biggest botters in EVE or not?
---
In EVE you get people transferring 100’s of billions of isk between alts, establishing secret deals with other alliances, service bills, rental bills, etc
---
If split into 20 deliveries it probably would barely raise an alarmbell to ccp.
---
I know I’ve transferred 10’s of billions to fresh rolled accounts and never had am issue
---
It really didnt dude, its just a tedious piece of shit change that literally changes nothing relevant and instead just adds frustration.
---
Nah just a 12 year old char here with the best of friends &lt;3
---
dough will rise
---
Are you talking about TEST vs GotG where we didn't bring supers, but PL/NC/Horde inserted themselves into it?
---
I think you keep missing the point. There are methods of transferring ISK heavy assets between players that would leave 0 traces and 0 logs.
---
Bills, contracts and deliveries are out of the question.
---
This was just a blunder honestly. It had to have been cause I cant think of a single logical reason for this change. They could have just allowed the industrial cyno to be lit on everything just like before. But I think they got stuck in the thought of the ship lighting it had to be an industrial and not how it should have been, the ship jumping to it should be an industrial.
---
I mean, you can try it out for free, just give it some time. Like at least two or three weeks. It might be a bit dull at the beginning. The tutorial just scratches the pure basics of the game. (Do all of them!) 
---
It's a sandbox game, so the content comes from the players. Joining a corp is almost mandatory, that's where you get the content and you will see the awesome side of Eves community. They are really helpful towards new players. 
---
As long as you are having fun, you are playing Eve the right way.
---
If NCPL moves in its hunting season :D
---
It's not really a problem if you have a single chain that you do. If you are in a group like Black Frog or PushX then you are constantly changing routes, and having to deal with Indy Cynos is a complete pain.
---
No, not wrong if properly explained, but bascially around "with alpha **only**" it's no
---
Yeah I mostly mine in low sec with my Corp and having the security would be useful
---
I don't know who those people are or what the original text says, but the way I read the translation is that the speaker is admitting that they sold isk to (presumably) AOM. Thats hardly proof AOM did anything wrong, but it is an admission that the speaker did something wrong.
---
Of course maybe its a bad translation.
---
This was a stupid change honestly because there is no sane reason to have it like this. Setting up chains is a bitch now for no other reason than because. This change wont affect the people who use the same chains often but it will affect those who sometimes move things. For no reason at all.
---
Allow all ships to use the industrial cyno (lighting it) and JFs only to jump to it. Thats neither a buff nor a nerf from the previous setup.
---
As an old E:D Player myself I can assure you will not get dissapointed. And no, it's not too late to start EVE. This community is AMAZING. But stay distant to /r/EVE. This guys are a salty bunch :P
---
there's only like 16 titians left in the world, and they all should be shown in museums not on some spacegame citadel tbh
---
The markets will adjust. If people cant get items at x% above Jita in Tenal, they will be forced to either travel to buy the items or buy at y% above Jita. You either take up the risk yourself or pay the JF guys for the risk they take.
---
Also, if there are fewer people in some region, it means there are more resources for the players who stay there.
---
Now:
---
First, ining as a new player is pointless and straight out dumb. Yield and time wise, it is a waste.
---
And second training certain shiptype won't give you security. What you can do in lowsec ia do PvP and fund the ships you will lose from factional warfare sites. The isk there is more than enough to have fun and make money at the same time. Do that and you will have a lot more fun. You can mine later, on alts when you have enough experience and skillpoints on them.
---
I am also in need of friends! Lol what's your Character name? Message meh!
---
That means I have to work for it, cyber-begging is much easier
---
The money on accounts are not Chinese, or anything. They are virtual currency that GMs can take away if deemed necessary. And since Chinese players cannot pkay, then thise accounts are not Chinese either,  so, no Chinese laws or customs. Easiest case ever,
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Bots may not hunt ess. So that could be a start
---
I'm sure you'll be just fine. Have fun with it until it dies and the try the other one. By then maybe you'll be into something else, who knows. Have fun.
---
Who says they bought it all at once?
---
Nah I'm getting nearly a million on a full haul with my venture but it takes around a hour
---
You could go use them
---
You smell that Randy? That's a shiticane a-blowin.
---
Sub 35 Bil for Titans, the economy is fucked up beyond repair imho
---
I'm a "new" player (started playing 2 years ago) and here is my thinking :
---
This is an hardcore game. I sticked to the game thanks to some player that helped me as soon as I started. You know player advice you to join a corp (small corp is better), but really, trust them, after tutorial do it, the tutorial will not show you what is eve, neither would your solo experience. You can have fun playing solo after years (when you know what you are doing). But the game is so unforgiving and complex that you need help, and you alone you won't be able to do a lot of things (because unskilled and unexperienced). The learning process is long but also part of what i liked in the game. Playing EVE feels like playing DayZ in mmo mode in space : You have to be patient, sometimes nothing happens for a long time, making fights and the fear of dying true epic moments.
---
Of course I recommend playing EvE it's a great game, but sadly player juste want instant low effort fun those days so it's dying slowly
---
thats more or less what i did when i played Dust, my ps3 was plugged into one of my monitors and i had eve online on the other that way i could also shoot the space lazer beams
---
Sure. It'll be 25mil p/h, I'll have the contracts drawn up by tonight but I'll need an advanced payment for 10 hours of friendship. If you could send me some friendship dates to add to my calendar so I don't accidentally shoot you on a friendship day that would be a great help.
---
It's like void opal gold rush all the time. :D
---
There are botters from all countries, dont make this a Chinese thing
---
Pretty sure he is talking about the route to Jita (or any other HS destination).
---
&gt;*proceeds to explain why ~~EVE~~ ships, only ships, and nothing but ships ~~has~~ have drag in space*          
---
Haha!
---
Uhh no thank you!
---
Its against my moral code to buy peoples company! Thats malorchy!
---
Cool video, nice length and editing! &lt;3 solo battleships. Subscribed.
---
not sure why you prop mod away from vedmak, loose scram, luckily he did not warp off :) i presume about the legion you mean if he held a heated scram on you he was faster even at the 8km web/grapple range....and he could have just moved away from you?
---
You should be able to log in as an alpha. Possibly even move and warp. But all your modules will be offline.
---
Your right but people usually never have enough sp as it is, so why would pressure to buy them fall? The next fleet of the month would come out and pressure is back up again.. or the next ship/big change like cynos bam more pressure. Your right but it's not isolated to just wanting sp for a skill or two then done.. these things are an addiction for some people lol they need all them skillzzzz.
---
nice
---
There is 0 way to get the ship out of the hole.
---
You have some options...its a sandbox after all.
---
1. Put a large strucutre down, dock, insure SD. Ofc strip the fit and sell it. You will need to be omega for the SD piece (to undock).
---
2. Sd it right now... take the isk, and what drops
---
3. Bring in a depot, strip fit and go back to option 2.
---
4. Keep it logged off and wait for some one to move in..... drop it on them...or sell it
---
5. Try and sell the hole, with the dread.
---
Roflmao best response. Love it
---
You cannot get a capital out of a c2 anyway..
---
you are a goonn, so you support everything they stand for and support thier effect on gameplay.
---
stop turning a blind eye and if you know theyre ways are bad for the game, fight them.
---
Well, you can do that in less than 5 minutes.
---
Again, it is a free tip you might take and save yourself a few months until you realize you wasted your time. :)
---
Almost all of us've been there, done that.
---
Random screenshot of Chinese text that no one can read of a random guy claiming to have RMT'd with AOM with absolutely 0 proof anywhere. Not bait at all
---
before people go down this route, it is infact them trying to make eve less solo self sufficient, and trying to make it more like group play for nullsec etc...
---
back in the day when whole alliance had to form to transport a freighter from jita out to nullsec, no one said 'its just so i need more accounts' they just asked for help.
---
Oh I love this, FRT leaking AOMs rmt, AOM leaking FRTs botting. I hope someday someone leaks someone ddosing someone's comms before someone jumping into someones grid.
---
Start reffing shit man! Demand and ent or a fight lol 
---
I assume it's not my c2 *pokes head out station windows and checks empty inbox*
---
Battleship problem with this is cargo size. It'd better be Cap.Booster+Cap.Battery, but then you have no web and much harder times tracking BC- targets.
---
That's between the Chinese players and their government. CCP has no reason to enforce that
---
Yeaaa... No...
---
Nobody has time for that anymore.. Many veterans would quit because of the tedious tasks and micromanagement required
---
Large null Empires would not be possible without what we have to day.
---
Just imagine having to resupply for a war an alliance the size of test.
---
Inb4 every single alliance gets banned
---
I guess 3/4 of [this list](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3tZgZqcnvscRWOdD8c6X4f?si=GQ1arr3pSXq4tJ1LM2ZUzQ) is what I'd use and like 1/3 is what I already used.
---
NEVER FORGET
---
It hsa been suggested to CCP many times, but they said that too many variables and parameters need to be cleared on character change that they will undoubtely forget to clear some of them resulting in some weird behaviour. And the person who wrote that part of code probably isn't working at CCP anymore.
---
the code is no doubt written so a blackops can jump to 'all' cynos rather than to 'x type' and 'btype' cyno's.
---
and like everything else they no doubt dont know how to re write it so the blackops cant jump to industrial...im 99% sure this is the reason xD
---
It's usually matter of attention for me. If I have enough to control drones - I scoop-deploy them when they're attacked, but if action is intense - I usually just let them fight. It's CN Wasps after all, they can tank some)
---
Has been suggested on CSM meeting by Steve Ronuken months ago, without them you have to be totally retarded to spend 3 weeks training Salvage Drone Operation to V and still be able to salvage only basic wrecks
---
Hmm when i posted this issue before cyno changes people were happy that it is coming.
---
And gas harvester upgrades!
---
So... I started playing yesterday after watching some tutorial videos about the game. After the tutorial I completed the exploring carrier path, and I wanted to try some real scanning/hacking to see how it goes. So I went to a system that had 0.7 sec value (it was 3-4 jumps away from my starting zone), and I located a data site. A window showed up telling me that enemy ships are guarding it, and they will attack. I thought that because I am in a high security zone, in the middle of the star map, i could handle the situation, and if they turn out to be stronger than me, I could jump away. What could go wrong, since I was fighting 4 pirates at once in the tutorial, right? Well, they destroyed my very first Heron in 2 seconds, without me being able to react to their insane dps.
---
Is this a common thing in eve online? Should I be worried about npc-s even in the highest-high security areas?
---
What software is that that puts your screens on the one monitor ? Looks sweet
---
They literally imploded the economy of their server. Chinese players, when given the chance, WILL bot the game into Oblivion to RMT the currency.
---
i saw titans :)
---
&gt; not sure why you prop mod away from vedmak
---
Hoped that no1 will notice how I almost spoiled this one :D
---
I was mwd in with keep-at-range, so when I rammed it - ship decided that I am too close and need to get back, and while I was getting back - I got scrammed+webbed. It was still around 6km, but he was getting away. And he did not warped away, most likely, because he did not have speed towards warp object.
---
(Also keep-at-range was right decision for tracking, but with this surroundings at moment I should manually set it to 1.5-2km)
---
----
---
&gt; about the legion you mean if he held a heated scram on you he was faster even at the 8km web/grapple range
---
yepp. He was not heating scram which allowed me to heated-mwd to him while he was still scrambled by me. Also he did not spam scram when it dropped, so I got full mwd cycle even when I was in scram-range.
---
And he did not fly straight to me, he turned to warp-off(left) while I get close on mwd cycle.
---
I've noticed emerging conduits in non-invasion systems.
---
Simply this.
---
That's because you're a veteran pilot. It's a windfall to a newer player.
---
Why you don't want to fly at 0.0?
---
Because that would’ve made sense.
---
You can right click Tama and set it "avoid" for a moment and your autopilot will give you a new route to lowsec. You can delete Tama from the avoid list after you reach destination. Same of course works with any system you want to skip. If your autopilot doesn't give you any route then there are no other routes.
---
EVE is one of the best games to play, specially the older you get. It has a slower tempo, nothing like your fortnite, lol or dota that has massive amounts of players. Those games just give you a quick fix, you are not building up to anything real ( only your skill ).
---
In EVE you can literaly build your empire! If that is a too big dream to have, there are other goals you can achieve - shit ton of exploring that rewards and challenges you;  aaaalot of pve stuff and challenges to do, as a new player, try doing 10/10 sites in nullsec while you live in a actual pvp galaxy; mining!!! - boring as fuck but perfect if you have a nice group of people with whom you talk and have fun ( socializing in an mmo,are you crazy?!?!? ) and you can actualy use that minerals to become a manufacturer of ships, modules or structures which in itself will make you spend a lot of time researching how to improve yourself.
---
My personal opinion of EVE is contradictory to everyone elses DOOM theory.  As time goes and the gamers get older they will get burned out of those quick fix battle royal games and will try to find a game where they can build something great and make a name for yourself. I expect a shitton of players coming to EVE.
---
At this level you get big discount.
---
Adapt or die.
---
For years China server allowed botting to the point every one were using one.            
---
So all people that came from this server brought with them not only the 'know how' but also ready to use and tested solutions.
---
:surprisepikachu:
---
This man speaketh the truth. Learn from his wisdom. 1mil an hour is... Well put it this way, if you were to do FW plexing instead, you could make 40mil in the same time or less.
---
Hmm...plenty of options. Thank you!
---
I think i'll first scan for the hole on my active account. Should be possible to find it sooner or later, as it has a highsec static and i know the designation of the WH.
---
Then i can decide what i'll do with it.
---
Lmao
---
but most are chinese and this is about 2 chinese alliances so this is very justified
---
You speak sense... Stop it immediately.
---
Seriously though, they would have had SO many more players id they didn't bother with ps3 and use pc instead.  Like... All of the eve playerbase for a start...
---
The inhabitants seems to be spanish speaking according to their names &amp; corp description.
---
Otherwise good option. My only other option would be self destruct it seems, so i can always go down doing stupid shit instead!
---
Huehuehuehue
---
How did you end up in a C2 with a dread?
---
Hi. I messaged you!
---
Do you guys speak chinese? Maybe the just talk about soup
---
?
---
so the big guy in Goons been banned for RMTing 90T ISK is Chinese too？
---
Well, first of all - resources in a region are not an issue as we can clearly see with the big blocks who can easily live in a single region.
---
Secondly, it only leads to further regions to be total garbage, so yeah, don't expect to see much besides ratting botters...
---
Maybe we get dust515 for mobile... dont you have asses
---
$$$
---
CCP just found RABD() and RANDBETWEEN() in Excel and applied it in formulas running EVE server spreadsheet.
---
Isk is what you need to buy more ships. If you lose a ship you can't afford to replace, you've got no tank.
---
Only fly a ship you can afford to replace a few times over. 
---
That's what the other guy means by tank. The ability to absorb a loss by replacing it.

if the tax rate is 5% or less. how many times you move it on and off a planet doesnt really matter. (you get taxed on and taxed off a planet.
---
top tier PI is more generally worth it when you have a buyer, otherwise its easier to sell the lower tier stuff as more people need it.
---
P0 you pull off the planet, on that planet you have to change it to P1, with command center upgrade level 4 (i dont reccomend level 5) you can turn that P1 into P2 on a single planet (easy and most efficiant way)
---
most people with about 5 planets or more, will then take all the P2 they make on each planet onto a 'production planet' (often a barren or temperate planet for this, small planet the better ie: gas planets are HUGE so use more resources of CPU + PWRGrid to setup on)
---
on your production planet your turning all your P2's into at least P3's. once you get to 10 or more planets you cant start thinking of turning that P3 into P4 (as youll have enough different types to do so, you maybe can get away with one production planet per 15 planets)
---
P3 is where most people stop, P4 can be REALLY involed and knowledge with PI in the past needed to really make it worthwhile, but it does i think make it all super low M3 to move the higher the tier you go. each tier adds a small amount of profit each Ptier above 3, 4 (maybe you make 10% more? and another 10% above that for P5?
---
which is why tax rates matter. somtimes effort and tax rates can mean P3 is just better overall. 
---
with my 18 planets i was JUST able to Nanite repair paste. (had a BPO for this) it was hella hard to make compared to just making say, robotics (p3)
---
bring in some friends, have a fight
---
sucks to be on losing side
---
we forget how much money the chinese players have and how normal it is to RMT for them
---
i always wondered who is dumb enough to bot in 2018-2019, why do they do it for a few dollars.... now i realize im the dumb one
---
Aom is mangos, aka Legacy
---
Yeah, that is the plan
---
The overall rule in Eve is that you are never 100% safe, regardless the security. Concord will only show up if a player starts attacking you and they don't come to protect you, they just fuck with the player attacking you. 
---
The npcs in the tutorial are really, really easy and in not really comparable to the npcs outside the tutorials. 
---
You probably found a ghost site, there is an invisible timer until the npcs show up and start attacking you. Those npcs are not easy. And you just have one try to hack the can, if you fail the can will blow up and you will take damage. Unless you have a really tanky ship, your ship will blow up, too. (Depends on where you are, the damage is between 8000 and 12000hp)

In these cases, differently = not possible, or not fun.

I'll keep that in mind.

Have to find the WH first...shouldn't be too hard as it has a Highsec static. How many C2s are there anyways... :)
---
he did turn, correct, but by turning your grapple got stronger and stronger, so he basiclly stopped i guess.
---
and for sure i fly mega enough to know you need Keepat range 4k to apply to literally anything. but if you cannot self pilot, thats fine, but know this, and know your ship will do this, when you see your range get to a point you going to turn around, (easy as its alls low in a battleship) tell your ship to stop. when they start getting ditance (almost immediatly) click approach, once theyre 5-6k away you can re-click keep at range.
---
its not manual piloting, but you will see a huge improvement if you learn how to make the mechanics work for you not against you :)
---
There is nothing wrong with playing both games. They interpret things differently, which has advantages and disadvantages.
---
just  omega him and reinforce pocos/citadels untill its deads
---
You can login and warp around but all the omega modules will be offline. Once you dock somewhere, then you won't be able to undock as an alpha.

Unless there have been two big Russian whales doing this, he first bought the isk illegally, bought titans for his new alliance, got them confiscated, asked CCP what he should do, got told he was free to buy plex, and then bough more than €100k worth of those.

Wanted a Russian alliance built around him, and his prominence to rival UAxDeath, Evil Thug and Vuk Lau. Son of an aluminum tycoon supposedly.
---
Another CNN.
---
You will still be flying it, but all the alpha modules will turn off and you won't have any hull bonuses.

i had similar problem in c4 wormhole,was spammed by someone from ireland  asking me if i want buy a c4 with c2/c1 static and multiple capitals,i rejected because i dont want to be caged in hole with useless ships.

Ah! Alright.
---
i joined in 2014, game was still like 10 years old at this stage, first 6 months, it rough, you 'feel' behind as you have limited access to things. thing is, once youve played for a year or 1.5years your just as effective as somone who has played for 15years. 
---
to get maxed skills in one single t2 cruiser for example will take you like 3months? from a new toon if you did it direct training. so its not like you cant catch up as the skills are limited how far you can go with them. theres just alot of ships, so if you reduce ship CHOICE and go more specialised like anyone should no matter how old in the game they are it works well.
---
at no point in this game will it be too old to start fresh.   15year old players start new toons to train into specific roles ALL the time. as having a second toons to fly one or two ships REALLY well really doesnt take long
---
If you want to try it, you can add me ingame? Then i can tell you more and link my fit etc.? Whats your char name?
---
Like 1000 t3 ships? or what do you mean
---
Except missiles wouldn't need to constantly burn fuel the entire run up to target.
---
Only a bit to get going and then course corrections.
---
Indeed. Also just remember to be opsec about your exact whereabouts. As many dudes that will want to help you create a massive brawl, there will be even more who would like nothing more than to just find and gank you.
---
Try setting to 64 bit, there was a bug at one point where it not only defaulted to 32 bit, but didn't work. Thought it had been fixed, but take a look I guess.
---
&gt; So missiles have an effective fuel range
---
No. No fuel is required to keep the missile going.
---
So a small burst and then it can save fuel for course corrections.
---
There is no soft cap on range, only on the delta-v
---
It's difficult to put that convenience genie back in the bottle. We can all think of those terrible times - when we couldn't warp to 0, when POS bashes were connected to sov, etc. Unfortunately, a quality of life degradation will be harshly judged even when it may be a return to some perceived status quo.

but local removed these type of people from nullsec where they should not be. the fix costs money, ccp's boss just doesnt have the balls to wait it out and create a better game in the long run
---
&gt; Where should I look for a Corporation? I have had no luck using the Corp. Search in game.
---
/r/evejobs/ or start a corp with the buddies with whom you started playing or start to get some people to know ingame and join their corp. The ingame adverts are sadly not really great to join a corp.
---
&gt;If I join a Corporation can I later leave it? (I.E. join a mining/manufacturing focused one now, and later join a mining/pvp/trading later.)
---
yes of course. Your corp history is saved though and everyone can see it.
---
&gt;Can I later create my own corporation and be in an alliance of some sort with others?
---
Yes. You can also do that right away. The skill requirements are low and eve alpha toons can do it. You need to train higher skills for bigger corps so there you have to be omega.
---
Some thoughts on creating your own corp vs joining another one: creating your own corp is probably more fun as you already play the game with some friends. Joining another corp means you can learn things faster instead of figuring them out for yourself.
---
One remark, I don't think it's a good idea to focus on mining in your early game. The skills have little overlap with other things and most people rather do it to get isk or the necessary ore than for fun in itself. So rather start some combat PvE which has a good overlap in skills with PvP so that you can try that with your buddies, too.

Battleship inertia is something you need to deal with.
---
-------------
---
&gt; (heating helps cap reserve) which yes you had nereus, but good to learn this way
---
It does help reserve batteries, but it uses overheat pool. And I was not sure if current grid is all I am having to fight. So in this situation saving overheat is good.
---
&gt; try bifrost with warp core stabs,,, youll find its way more op than anything else lol
---
I'll check it up, thank you.
---
&gt; imagine this, you hold praxis, just before praxis dies you bump him while switch scram to legion. ensureing both kills
---
Scrambled, I bump him? I am not really sure. I was not really bothered to ensure Praxis while I could get t3c.

Heyy sounds good man, its aceyfacey

---
battleship inertia is somthing you can LEARN to deal with.
---
and to be fair, other than your dscan and overview to see whats on grid or comming in, what else are you doing otherthan checking damage application and ranges to your target.
---
in a bigger ship, heat build up on each rack goes up pretty slow. an overheat here and there will result in very little actual damage.  
---
i guess you have said your not 'elite pevepe' and maybe newish? after a while. the fun is not only finding those fights, but ensureing maximum kills grabbed is a huge aim.
---
by bumpin praxis (and preloading NULL) he cannot warp. he was only like 6volleys away from death when you let him go. why focus a target this long, to let him go at the end.
---
while bumped he dies and you actually end up grabbing the legion way before he goes down. that legion, and basicly any of those dudes seemed to not want to leave grid unless they take damage. im pretty sure that legion goes nowhere unless praxis actually calls 'im dead' on comms.
---
Ty, I appreciate the detailed answer
---
They dropped a decoy fort in another system, which we initially formed for....then our scout spots the faction fort...
---
learning things like how close do i place these buildings, and whats the best pattern of buildings to maximise my planet cpu and powergrid is often a huge part to learn
---
I've just googled RMT sites and it looks like $2.5 per bill is average price. But idk if you really get that isk if you pay. In China 1bill can cost even less.
---
Don't hesitate to try EVE online .. it is a very involving and fulfilling game where you can be involved in every step of your characters journey. There is so much to learn and try once you get past the first few days or weeks of grinding for ISK (ingame money).
---
My advice team up with some veteren players perhaps in a new player friendly corporation, you will learn features of the game so much faster and they may help guide your progression.
---
How do we make it good again hy
---
So much this, not a coincidence that all Strat Level FCs in my 14 years of EVE were students (at best) and went inactive or casual after starting "real life".
---
I'm getting a black screen every so often when switching in and out of windowed mode. Sometimes docking in a station fixes it. My friend has the same problem, and we both have Radeon cards, I figured maybe that had something to do with it.

2.5 Hours moon mining &gt; 895 mil

Says one with the flair of an alliance that harboured and protected known, self-exposed and punished botters (Kids With Guns) for several hundred Billion ISK. After the alliance KWG disbanded to shake off their bad reputation TEST simply assimilated their biggest Corp Endgegner. As someone who had awox alts in there I can tell you they are (or at least harbour) some hardcore botters.
---
At one special time about 80% of all Fexthabolis Systems were farmed by Bots. 
---
The bot money went into TESTs "Manhattan Program".
---
Some sites are not like others.
---
But the tutorial sets a bad presendece, because those NPCs are weak enough that a stray gamma particle would kill them.
---
i only watched the first fight
---
Ancillary reps MUST be ran heated.
---
a fight with a silver magnate is not going to be easy, its like a 100billion isk ship + fit
---
you can start moving towards an enemy before they even land, the moment they land on overview you can start approaching. 
---
i pvp in frigs alot in lowsec, fw space is great for it still. but i do run rep drugs or speed drugs. running even a low tier exile with this armour rep. + actually heating it, and i bet you do not turn off auto reload on your ancillary repper. will give you twice as much tank by the time you die if you offload the whole thing.
---
Stratios would need some bling for c3 sites. 
---
I do c3 sites in a fairly expensive tengu, but it's expensive to allow it to be PVP fit while running sites
---
Thanks !
---
Timezone tanking is only a player created problem when you put things outside of your strong time just so it is a pain for others to attack.
---
FRT demonstrably time their stuff for their strong time. Beyond that it's a problem as old as Dominion sov multiplied by the number of clock-timed structures out there now.
---
However I take your point that it partially boils down to not the direct size comparison but the relative sizes during key TZs.
---
I play like 6-10 hours a week on average. Maybe less.
---
You can definitely be more casual and still accomplish goals.
---
&gt;they will be forced to either travel
---
Forced to do nothing, it aint a job and you can always move to another group that will have cheaper logistics. In fact, all the groups I've been with had people running JFs not for the profits but for the sake of keeping things stocked and running.
---
Go 00 asap.
---
I believe its called money laundering. 
---
So a space Landry mat where it cost millions of isk to do your laundry over a month or two until the transaction is complete.

Man missing that rorq safe by 30seconds or so was really sad, but it made for a fun fleet moving fuel from the wreck into the ansiblex with harpys

Upvoted because I don't like being told not to!

Chinese players are legally allowed to play on any server they like. The reason why chinese players had their own server is because if you want to do business in china you need a chinese company hosting your business.
---
That's fine, I was looking forward to experiencing your friendship. Unfortunately I had already started the administrative process of drawing up the contracts. Business is business, I'm sure you understand, so if you'd kindly furnish my account with the standard 10 million isk administrative fee we can both move on.

It's quite simple.  The committee are designing something that'll survive their use case.  They need a camel but only know about horses.  If they knew about camels, they wouldn't need to hold a meeting about it.
---
Brave sucking test dick, truly an all time classic.
---
The problem with initial setup is that there may not be anywhere to reprocess that ore or use those BPCs. Not all NPC stations have those services.
---
Chain setup with a cyno 5 alt and a travel ceptor was nice and it was the painful part of setting up a chain. Maybe it was a bit too easy but requiring the industrial is too far the other way. Letting blops jump to it is still something that makes no sense to me and utterly neutered what they were trying to do.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer, I thought that something like this was the case. I'll watch out for those warnings from now on. It just got me as a surprise that these high-threat npc things are present in the most secure areas of the game.
---
That's is truly the largest group of Chinese bot&amp;rmt. 
---
A sugar mummy called Bunny Lu has spent huge amount of money on Aom recently.  Today, according to this dialogue, I finally realise where the money goes. 
---
Nearly desperate about CCPlz.
---
If you are spending an hour mining just so you can build your cyno ships are you also spending weeks doing all the reactions and build jobs you need to get that JF? No?
---
Then the ore you need can be bought relatively easily.
---
Well done! but needs more rust
---
Well, leaving assets in space or corporate hangars is logged as well. Renting offices is bills, so no. Fake market orders is probably the worst one.    
---
Taking stuff from hauler fleet hangars? Launching ships into space from capital ship hangars? I guess those are logged as well.     
---
Transfering structures is logged...     
---
That raises the question  - what is left?     
---
Fake ganking? Would be pretty risky and you'd lose half of sthe stuff at min.     
---
Is leaving assets in pos modules logged? Do they even work still? What is the secret?
---
IF you are moving ore and BPCs yes. Covert hauler caps out at just over 10k cargo space and the industrials are 20k each repackaged.
---
that's because you pussied out of being able to jump to covert cynos.
---
Yeah, meanwhile we were scrambling to fit bombs on our bombers to pop the wreck but couldn't find enough launchers on time. Was good fun and we couldn't believe it worked.
---
Yeah, looks a bit too Caldari...
---
do they have a fortizar in there? If so, keep asking for a buy I guess. They can at least insure it and get some money out of it.   
---
You can't find the hole from outside (or you could but it will take tremendous luck) - ask the signal cartel to find it for you. .
---
Flip side it removes far too many options from the defender. It might work if they let cov ops cynos be fitted to everything. That could in theory lead to some nice covert fitted fleet vs covert fitted fleet action.
---
Yes, I know that it just means the blops drop will get counter dropped if the defender has significantly larger force available. But that's true for the initial attack too.
---
People who were part of the internal testing for Nova report that it was basically a DUST carbon copy. Who knows what went wrong.

&gt;*other than your dscan and overview to see whats on grid or comming in*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Controlling tank, killing ecm-drones, controlling 2nd and 3rd windows and etc.
---
clicking warp on a hauler is not exacly a reason to not do somthing for the entire fight, your 2nd toon in dessie was dead, for getabout it. and even i it was not dead controlling that is not a reason to not do somthing for an entire fight.
---
controlling tank, in a hyperion where you dont even have to run your second rep, and injecting is a semi afk thing as theres no real neut pressure is a bad excuse. every 10seconds look at armour and decide if you need to run a single rep..... is easy. you just have to get into your mind the pvp fight checklist routine. which is hard and where your experiance will come in over time.
---
every 10seconds check armour and do you need to inject? every few injects move cap booster over from contianer this takes all of like 2-5seconds, if your tanking is fine, spend the next 5-10 seconds checking alts. or moving them. 
---
P.S is this large container really worth it if you have a nereus? like, the APM reqiured for this when you basiclly have unlimited boosters in your nereus.... seems a bit unnessessary to me, maybe think of removing it to make your own life easier, it only gives you like on more charge in your ship....
---
then spend 5-10 seconds checking ranges, dps, ammo choice for range, targets on grid. this is like a 20second cycle you can do non stop. and fit in dscan inbetween. you do it so many times each fight it becomes routine, once it becomes routine yo can start adding in bait tanking when available to you. 
---
bait tanking, another thing that could keep the legion interested in this scenerio, a Hyperion has a HUGE hull tank,. and with a praxis near dead, and only a mostly neuting legion left, you could bait into hull a little here and he will want to stay on grid thinking your capped out and about to die for revenge on his buddies.
---
**i want to enforce i am not shitting on you in any way,  did you post this video, and claim 'i am not pro pvper' and not want help or advice on getting better? if so, if you truely do not want to get any better than what your showing us thats a real shame.**
---
learn it, learn how to control your ship and know its abilities learn it now not later, yes, im helping you know about something to learn, so start now, your next fight, every fight do this, get better and better at it after trying it, like veverything you fail at first when doing somthing new, then get better and better. before me saying it you was not even aware you had to think about learning it, hence me pointing it out.
---
&gt;*that legion, and basicly any of those dudes seemed to not want to leave grid unless they take damage.*  
---
&gt;I assumed that Legion would leave grid before Praxis dies. We'll never know if I was right or not)
---
the praxis was in hull. it was shield tanked, and in hull. that legion was not even burning away, he was just orbiting. he was not going anywhere ma dood. just like the harb navy at the very end, when literally everything else was dead, he still hung around for a bit. these guys did not want to leave, im sure they had lots of fun too :)
---
You will lose your content generator though
---
Oh I’m sure it a spiritual report of Dust, by this time they would have started development with a new or existing engine (trinity, unreal, etc) to ease their work and provide cross platform possibility.
---
Pretty sure one or mire if those you lusted are NOT logged. Not gonna say which one as I don't want to aid cheaters.
---
Seeing shit like this makes people want to quit the game. I hope CCP knows that. It’s not even rare anymore and it’s always the same people. 
---
The money for RMT comes from bots, gets sold to perspective botters, then gets spent on meme losses like the 80b Marshal on Zkill right now. Why bother playing the game and working hard for anything? I don’t even have confidence that all involved will get banned. That’s the worst part.
---
Yeah I can afford the ship with a little bit of mining and I have about 4 mil isk
---
You sad sad little man

Your so funny! Sorry to say!
---
What activity's can net you that I can't figure out how to start exploration
---
What's fw plexing and is it worth getting Omega
---
They're spawned for people to get used to Trig invasions and try their luck against a conduit that is weaker than Minor ones in invasion systems. Also, being outside of invasion areas means the invasion system effects aren't active.
---
Minor conduits can be done with 1-3 people and even offer some decent mining opportunities (doubly so since the signature disappears when you complete the site but the ore won't despawn until you leave).
---
Roaming Raznaborg Damaviks will harass miners regardless whether there is an Emerging Conduit in the system or not.
---
The trigs from the conduit do not roam, what is attacking you in the belts are the randomly spawned groups of 2-4 frigs.
---
I came from ED because after a few hundred hours you realize ED is a docking simulator.
---
Start eve, join a group, enjoy actual social connections. Nullsec is probably your best bet, great isk, and not as demanding as wormholes (also very fun but more endgame imo)
---
Welcome :)
---
There are more high-threat npcs in high sec. 
---
For example those Autothysian Lancer, you might have seen them already. Never attack them, they will ignore you, so just ignore them, too. 
---
And the Triglavian Invasion are another thread in high sec. :) If you just travel through a system that currently has a invasion, you should be fine. Just don't be afk and don't use autopilot. Those invasions are for fleets and not really for solo fighting. 
---
You have a warning showing up, before you enter those systems. 
---
Never, ever ignore those warnings, if in doubt, just dock somewhere and google it to get more information.
---
The replays will help you iron out the technical issues (missing webs, burning guns, wrong ammo...), but you also need to focus on the rock/paper/scissors issue in eve. There are a lot of matchups you will **never** win against a competent opponent, no matter how good your techique and reflexes are.
---
Star Trek: Voyager called and wants EVE to get out of species 8472's space.
---
Slinky already said a lot of good stuff.
---
I'm pretty new to fw too (under 100 fights). I record my fights, watch the videos after, and take notes of what I did right or wrong so that I can do better next fight.
---
I only have been flying t1 frigates, and I try to only engage t1 frigates, though I've fought some faction frigates too. Generally you aren't going to win against a tougher ship (t1 vs faction, faction vs pirate, etc) unless you play perfectly and they fuck up, or you have some big advantage like a nice pod and drugs and they aren't using those, etc. There's just too much raw power in a higher ship tier between an extra slot, better hull bonuses, and more ehp.
---
Stuff you gotta have done before undocking or right when you undock: auto reload OFF on saar, load paste and ammo, have your orbit and/or keep at range buttons set to the right distances for your fit, have your overview configured, have dscan window set up, use standings to watch out for baiters/blobbers and for those who will give good fights, have drugs (standard blue pill or exile, hardshell or pyro I or II), be in the right pod, use dotlan to help navigate around the systems you want to visit, have bookmarks (pings on gates to help avoid smartbombers or other issues, insta undocks, etc).

Right before a fight: use dscan and local and zkill info to know who you're probably fighting before you fight, don't throw yourself into the meat grinder but don't be afraid to die either cause being in a fight helps you learn, when you see the hull you're fighting (or better, probably know the fit by the character name and zkill), double check correct ammo damage type and range and adjust your orbit/keep at range distances. Preoverheat guns (always heat them a while fight basically), ab, web, scram, reps, be careful with mid slot heat cause you'll burn that stuff out before the fight is over but Saar and guns likely won't burn out with decsn thermodyamics. Have drones out, have drugs eaten 
---
Immediately upon landing/them landing: start burning to correct range with prop mod on based on their probable fit, then lock them up and activate guns and rackle. Watch what they're doing (bonus points if you can  look at their ship and learn what different guy look like) to know if you need to adjust the range you're at when relevsnt (blaster Merlin obviously fights at 0 but an atron or tormentor or something has different ranges available depending on the enemy, etc). Start Saar before you take armor damage unless you're fighting a very low DPS opponent. Keep an eye on dscan for more ships coming in. Notice ewar effects on you - some times people don't have a scram or point and you can warp out if yours going to lose, don't be afraid to. Spam warp to get pod out. Loot wrecks I'd you win while watching dscan. Gf for gfs

Love the editing and the voice changes, sounds like they're talking over a radio. Beautiful

I was told never let your training queue go empty. Served me well over the years.
---
I am from AOM, and a Chinese.
---
Well, it is well-known that there was some rampant RMT activities in Serenity.
---
And it is certain that there were some RMTs in PIBC(AOM in Serenity)
---
But I never heard of RMT in AOM, especially these kind of information from QQ is always(99 percent) fake for it is too easy to PS.
---
Actually I can even replace AOM with FRT in this picture.
---
Frankly, I never witness punishment of RMT to any AOM members, but I witnessed 2 punishments from CCP for FRT members.
---
FRT → RMT, is really notorious.
---
Then please stay the fuck away from this subreddit. This is the most toxic place in EVE, for realsies.
---
you are right, its now for CCP to do something to teach these RMTer a valuble lesson
---
Ah that would do it. I'm a naval history nerd and tend to forget about the anime.
---
Because you ran away since you were afraid they would do that. PL didn't do shit you fucking moron.
---
Join a decent newbro corp (Eve Uni, Pandemjc Horde, Brave Newbies, Dreddit, Karmafleet) and they will teach you.
---
What you basically need is the 4 probing skills up to lvl 3-4. Amarr and Caldari frigate 4 or 5 (for astero), Relic analyzer requirements as max as possible. Lvl 5 is a longbtrain though. Also, if you are making this account dedicated explorer, train for covert ops frigates.
---
The probing process is something you need to watch videos for, but it will become very easy for you with the proper teacher.
---
You cant take it so literally, but if you read up in this endless pile of shit, then you can see he suggested mining the minerals in a venture, hence why it'd take an hour to mine minerals for your hauler(s) and cyno(s). 
---
And it would be worth mentioning that leaving your indy cyno ship in space for 10 minutes, that theres a high chance someone will come and kill it. The same was true for corvette cynos but you could automatically get a new one as soon as you dock.
---
Jita: Expect everything to be a scam. Never trade with someone. Dont use contracts in the beginning.
---
Train the magic 14 skills early on. (check eve uni for info)
---
Stick to training 1 weapon type and light drones and start with 1 or 2 races. In the beginning!
---
The more you spread out your training the less "effective" it will feel.
---
Stop training at cruiser level. Until you have a better understanding of the game.
---
If you dont like a part of the game dont do it! Don´t do any kind of content you dont enjoy. 
---
Explo is a good way to make ISK in the beginning.
---
Absolutely!!! The new player experience is awesome. A universe to explore. With skill injections there’s the opportunity to quickly advance.
---
I’ve been playing a while now and just made a couple of new accounts. I’m training them to fly Nestors which I’m going to run C5 sites with which will I turn finance the skills and ships of my other accounts. Training the pilots to a level to manage the sites should t take long.
---
Jump in and have fun
---
It is possible to own a structure without having the anchoring skill. Therefore, it is possible to declare war with just alpha accounts.
---
First of all, fair play to going out in a frigate and trying to kill things. It is the best way to learn.
---
Saying that here's some of the things i noticed that stuck out.
---
Your ancillary reps:
---
Ensure they are fully loaded before any fight. Make sure with shield boosters you choose the smallest cap booster size you can fit (should end up with 9 charges loaded).
---
Always run Ancil reps overheated.
---
Always turn off auto reload (armor reps will continue to run at a reduced rep amount).
---
Watch to make sure you aren't wasting charges tanking when you are taking little to no damage / have full armor or shield.
---
When starting fights it seems like you try to focus on getting into position and prepping your tackle modules before you even lock the target. In some fights you were already 50% through your own tank before you lock the enemy, that is never a good thing.
---
In the first fight vs the garmur you were trying to get closer which is difficult, but you had artillery fit and weren't even firing. Yes you probably wont hit it, but you may knock its shield down enough to force it away or make the pilot panic and make a mistake.
---
Second fight vs the garmur you dont have your shield ancil loaded, thats giving away a free kill right there. Also you turn your AB off for seemingly no reason. Afterburner speed + close orbit mitigates damage, so by turning it off you just allowed more damage to be applied.
---
Your tackle modules. You start the fights with your Scram and Web heated. Thats good, the problem is you then don't turn the overheat off the entire fight. The enemy is only 2km away, there is no need to overheat these modules and risk burning them or your prop mod out.
---
I'm not going to lie, you did alot wrong in all of the fights. That said you are learning and your fits seem to be solid once you tighten up a few processes during PvP.
---
HOT KEYS! Learn them, set up your own key binds, just use them! The time it takes to move your mouse, click on a module and then move it back to do XYZ is alot slower than hitting say F3, or CTRL + F2 etc.
---
Manual piloting. You use Q Click to move around, not a bad way to do it but you are staying on the same plane. Eve is 3D, you can go up and down. Any of those pilots could have just gone up or down to get out of your tackle and you would have just continued to try and stay "ontop" of them by moving on the same axis.
---
Double clicking in space is the best way to do it. Having the overlay etc up is very useful but dont be scared (maybe once you have started using hotkeys) to move the camera around and try different angles.
---
Good luck o7
---
CCP was not managing the China server due to totalitarian laws in China preventing this.
---
I resorted to a 5 medium drone vexor. Speed tank it. But you lose tons of HP. And can only rat in low to medium difficulty anoms. If you lose it. It doesn’t break the bank.
---
&gt;Not in our space. But there is resistance in Eve. All the physics behavior in game acts as though we're driving submarines through water, rather than spaceships through vacuum. 
---
That's probably why the planets and moons never move either.
---
Well, then could you find me a complete BR?
---
Finally, we can all win Eve
---
That's a good idea
---
If that is the only solution you can come up with then it might just be the option for you.
---
screw jf pilots finally a change i can get behind.  wish they would of kept it with reg cynos so youd cry about having to use recons and blops to cyno instead
---
this isnt proof this is just hearsay. you could be faking this, the person in the chat could be faking the claim.
---
Do send too CCP but with frat on the backfoot it would not suprise me if they trying to dirty up their opponent.
---
Also wouldnt some1 who sells RMT keep their mouth shut about past transations, even if frat sells them the isk, ya would keep your mouth shut as ur incriminating yourself
---
&gt;station
---
In that case, we need another round of cyno nerfs. Sounds like a plan though.
---
Ok you get the black screen on launcher or when logging to game from launcher?         
---
I thing QT is used in the launcher.
---
not all
---
ccp code
---
make it so 3 ships inside 10km from each other are needed to light a combat cyno....capital or subcapital..... that might be more interesting than what weve been given.
---
I'll try to find it myself first. I want to keep the wh designation to myself for now to keep my options open.
---
Well, since the logs are on their end, we won't find out which one does create logs and which not, right?
---
Seems like a natural mechanism to regulate group size TBH.
---
u/sheol pretty much hit the nail on the head, here, but to elaborate...
---
We each have our own, relatively small, areas of expertise and focus at CCP. For me, that's limited-time content (I'm one of the folks working on the Invasion dungeons). It's not just limited, though, in terms of what we work on, but also what we actually get to decide - there are collections of people that an idea has to pass through and be approved by. I've had ideas I love get nixxed due to time, priorities, technical capacity, or simply because I had trouble getting others as hyped as I was. That's fine, though - that's the industry.
---
When it comes to player suggestions, what I do is read and stay silent, because I don't want get y'all's hopes up only to have them dashed when something can't make it through the approval gates. I'd rather surprise you with something you've been asking for than let you down on a promise - and I think that probably goes for most of my coworkers. There's also the side of it, too, where when we disagree on the quality of an idea, it's a very bad idea for a random dev to be getting into an argument with a player. It's something we're actively asked not to do, as miscommunication or a less-than-perfect social interaction can quickly escalate a request into a complaint, or a complaint into... well, you get the idea. None of us want anything other than an amazing interaction with the community and our players (seriously - I tear up whenever y'all say nice stuff about my work), and anything less than I think is almost always best handled by our community team.
---
So, yeah, I come on here with my spare time to check in on things, but I won't make any promises or tell y'all anything about what's coming up, because I'm not the right person for that. I won't comment on game mechanics or systems, because 99% of the time they don't relate to my work, and when they do I can't talk about what I'm doing.
---
In short, we love y'all, and our silence does not mean we're not listening.
---
Introduce the Signature Resolution attribute to Capital-sized Remote Repair modules. The smaller the Signature Radius of the repaired ship, the lower the repaired amount. Make the change worth-while. Sub-T2 LogiFrigs values on Frigate-sized ships, for example.
---
lol wat
---
Launching ships or jettisoning cargo is tracked and has been for a few years now.
---
19,90 $/ Bil. ISK - he had to pay his house .... and he did with north moongoo
---
calm down and tell me what makes this zero effort shitpost salty and an absolute train wreck
---
The problem is... try telling that to the Chinese!
---
&gt; chinese RMTing in 2019
---
looks at the quote, looks at the OPs flair, then looks at AOM .....
---
these narratives sadly for you only work in filterbubbles for koolaid-blinded lemmings....
---
dude, we have google translate
---
Here have my upvote ! Don't loose karma on that bro. Yeah it's sad that we have nothing more than FW that is "affordable/findable" pvp
---
my chinese friend told me the CEO of AOM collects taxes in Serenity server to pay his mortgage, is that true?
---
I'll help the cheaters. It's the "send isk to" option. Go ahead cheaters.
---
CCP actually needs to find a way that exceeds expectations.
---
Hmm please tell me how to kill a JF jumping to a cyno in docking range.
---
I excplicitly do not speak of the bad hisec mechanics exploit goons are  running with miniluv.
---
Chicken dinner
---
It is annoying as hell to get linked fits that you can't use even after switching to all tier 1. It feels like a barrier, maybe if I could earn skills it would feel like "unlocking my ships potential". But no just wait a week each for pg cpu cap navigation etc.
---
Or for the initial industrial cyno.
---
Yeah exactly https://youtu.be/_cX6adQznEE this didn’t get much traction last time I posted it but this is one of the biggest if not the main botting tools with a tutorial of how to run it properly and safely. Guess who it tells you to join in the discord? A frat/Iron crown Corp, also goes into RMTing safely and has a dedicated bot of what black market isk is going for. 
---
Once I got EVE rich I had a lot of folks PMing me to message them on discord, me thinking they where trying to buy the Komodo I would and it 7/10 would end up in a pitch for them to buy isk from me for irl monies hence the discord link.
---
Flairless salt from hisec carebears mad about the most recent burn Jita is serious business.

Since 2016 it is not intended that you can move to/through hostile space undercover. PvP is far to easy nowadays thats why so much is happening and PvE is not safe enough according to this sub ...

I also heard if that happens the galaxy finally collapses into the center black hole
---
Are you referring to eve echos?
---
I would, but given Google translate's quality, I'd probably end up insulting their mothers and start a nuclear war.
---
How could you possibly know that? Do you have access to the EVE databases or something?
---
Me thinks you are just making assumptions.
---
Not enough rust. Must be Caldari.
---
It's a fuckin stretch since ccp doesn't know how to do the chat system fucking local is gone in some parts of null the same way as incursions. Kill the triangle bois to online again. Either wait it out or be ballsy with no local and go kill the incursion. I don't play the game tbf but I think that's add at least a middle ground.
---
If you make a statement that your alliance is in longest entos war in EVE history then you should know history,and 9 is more then 7,winter coalition 7 months is also XIX 7 months so its not realy just your alliance in longest entosys war(that is not longest entosys war :P)there was several atempts to place fortizars and kill ihub in 46dp,all was repeled,and at the end fraternity have 12k members ,test 18k and XIX 3k so rorq mining/super rating is nuch more easy for them than for us on borderline with frat staging region...fighting a war for 7 months after 9 months of war and loss of all sov in 0.0 does not look like the alliance on verge of collapse more like hardcore one...
---
do u play from places in china with firewall restrictions? how do u get around them
---
Actually Im in Macau, so...
---
ah k lol XD
---
There's no such thing as a "fair" fight in eve though
---
Can always go to Wingspan to help locate it.  With a HS static they could probably find it within a week.
---
Isnt it supposed to address Rorquals lighting cynos at the drop of a hat and getting capital ships as support to save it from whatever roaming gang finds it?
---
I just let all my accounts but main to unsub. I'd suggest doing that. But they have whales that throw money around like nothing so it might change nothing. But at least they are trying. CCP had some balls this time around and tried to make the game a little better but once put in everyone hated it. 
---
They shouldn't do wave bans imo. It should be hit asap, having dealt with bots in my alliance but mostly some nerds in wicked creek. Wave bans don't fucking help. It's neat to kill caps in HS but it's just like gargling mouth wash once every 3 months and call it clean
---
Whatever in od the reddit with prinscreen on chinese it must be truth :D
---
Cool
---
How about Chinese people just STOP cheating and hacking. Yes, it's also other people but for fuck sake, STOP destroying games with your  gaming 'culture'.
---
He's a bittervet. Some of us don't like the game in its current form and like changes but you are new and the game can be super fun to play. Ignore these nerds. Enjoy the game! It can be really really fun.
---
Then why did CCP fold to a Chinese net court ruling regarding the confiscation of assets on TQ years ago?
---
CCP will follow China's laws on TQ or China will punish them. DDOS, hacks and of course blocking CCP net trafic via firewall.
---
They’re not going to move the ISK through the game. It’s going to be through username and passwords.
---
Fake market orders is ideal. Who said the finger did not slip?
---
EVE itself does not use QT that’s just the launcher. Have you tried turning the logserver on by enabling it in the launcher and looking at the logs?
---
Or just give the buyer the username and password of the account with 200T isk.
---
Three of my guys had this issue. They fixed it by setting DX9.
---
Kill structures from deep safes... Hmmm
---
I don't think anyone was complaining about losing a covops ship. It was the initial cost of the toon they were complaining about. *Now* they're combining about the effort it takes, because God forbid they have to effort.
---
Snuff unironically complaining about the game being dead. KEK
---
1 bill has been $5 and below for 2 years now. RMT ISK price went to turd right after Rorq's online.
---
Or introduce some sort of black out to the bots primary intel source?
---
CCP loves botting, deal with it.
---
Students or "NEETs" yeah. I felt like blackout helped with it, but that's dead and gone because CCP is beholden to their krab overlords with 20 accounts.
---
y not both friend :)
---
games p fun with little to no blues or having leadership play house of cards online
---
Yes...
---
what extra account
---
Let's just say I know people, who got out with it ez pz and know how to hide their RMT.
---
I surely understand your anger, but really not all Chinese does these. Sorry for that.
---
The client doesn't use QT, only the launcher does.
---
If you're getting a black screen on login, there's a good chance there's something broken about your character that will require GM intervention to fix.
---
For example, the last time I helped someone with this kind of problem, they'd been put inside an asset safety wrap during a structure explosion and were stuck inside the asset safety purgatory dimension waiting for someone to pay to bail them out.
---
I recommend filing a support ticket and asking a GM to take a look.
---
We do specialize in wormhole location services
---
Use wingspan to find the hole. Cheap and fast.
---
Holy balls
---
Your alliance parades FRT botting thru the streets like its a war cry and then gave the biggest perpetuators of botting/rmt blue standings and an entire region
---
3Lol please please not all at once. I like to sip the salt. I always have to chuckle when people say GSF is mostly bots.  With such a large character count, of course some people that run bots get in, like any large entity.  Thing is, bots dont go on fleets. Bots dont get paps. Bots dont contribute. And GSF hate that shit. As a  GSF member Corp you have to participate in order to stay a member Corp. So it's funny when people say hey it's all bots. Monthly participation metrics come out and if you dont participate to a degree that others do,  you get on the shit list. Stay on the shit list for several months and Corp gets kicked.
---
 Have you seen the ccp team security 2017(?) Presentation that gave some awesome data including slides on where the bot bans happen? They didnt name names but showed a heat map distribution Please do watch it so you can see the distributions of botting bans, and the small heat map blip that comes up for delve. You can see some very large heat map blips but I dont want to ruin the suspense for you.
---
  Just wanna do my part to say, before you just go grr goons that is so very fun to do in such corners please do some research (reddit shitposting unfortunately doesnt count. I mean maybe it does.)  Not even saying this shit for you, maybe someone will read it and not immediately think oh ya definitely all bots
---
As far as I hate AOM leadership and knowing some blatant botting systems in Omist, I won't believe anything in QQ same way like discord screenshots since they are so easy to fabricate, and even if it's legit people just tend to say stupid things on chatting software.
---
I do saw a few more series of the screenshots which a dude says something like "AOM won't be banned regardless, confirmed with GM, they have some backdoors in CCP". Which means either I'm too naive about CCP or just this whole conversation is like meh.
---
you maybe didnt catch what i was saying, which will be my fault of course.
---
but botting or not, goons support the goon way of life. and for a goon to say 'im a goon but i dont do those things we are speaking of' is a REALLY bad excuse to get out of somthing.
---
if somone dislikes citadels, dislikes maximum rorq mining, etc etc, dislikes mass titans winning the game. then dont be in goons and blame CCP xD my god just leave goons and fight them lol its a game to fight not live.
---
and to say bots dont go on paps is madness, the owners do.
---
and i know a goon who is in a corp in goonswarm, he makes up 98% of the corps paps. the corp gets by while they krab while the ONE SINGLE pvpers in the corp gets them bye, so dont go telling the world 'we have rules' because you dont lol.
---
if you think goons doesnt have bots, and the rest of eve has most of them and thier to blame, your insane.
---
You just described null bloc pvp for 90% of people.
---
&gt; **bad alliance** 
---
During PH deployment to Querious i found Darwinism to be pretty awesome. 10/10 would bash QFC scrubs with.

Yeah not suspicious at all when an rmt seller accepts all kinds of "market mistake orders" per day...      
---
The post was about untracable for the big guys, not about one-off small fishes
---
Trusting screenshots in 2019...
---
It seems the industrial cyno was added to allow JFs to jump to something cheaper than a recon or covert ops.
---
If you're talking larger fleet with remote reps,or ganking a target before the Concord response then yeah... Alpha becomes a major consideration. For most other situations it's less important.
---
Battle cruisers and cruisers are the bread and butter of newbs. All the skills to fly them properly are needed for everything else later. These ships are always useful. Battlecruisers like the Drake are great at PVE. All cruisers are good at pvp.
---
Like someone else said. Battleships are a newb trap. They are not great for much till later on in your career.
---
Core skills are important!!!(powergrid, cpu, tanking skills all level 5.)
---
The history is that one of the two groups was better at botting and outbotted FRT and friends.
---
The end.~
---
How about you make some evolution and stop personal attacking in such a self-humiliating way :)
---
oh crap you can create a 10 man corp as alpha ?! i totally thought corp management is out of alpha

This is only 2 trillion isk.. chump change RMT tbh and that is not even a joke. When they are doing more than 25 to 30 trillion will it be considered RMT worthy.

Would be cool but it would almost undoubtedly get wiped once the ship is repackaged.

I can get a perfect n-th degree polynomial fit of either of these graphs to a line that I drew with a sharpie on my stomach last week while eating some cheese.

Guys, its time to dump some cash into plex is what im saying here yeah
---
&gt;So a small burst and then it can save fuel for course corrections.
---
How small? And they are always correcting trajectory. If you put extra fuel in the missile it will be heavier, slower and less manuverable. The fuel they have is just the small burst, correction is done through small gas exausts that are calculated to last as long the fuel.
---
Let's be fair, Goons were not on the bot ban list. Got anything else?
---
Will you also promptly give him a supply of torpedos? He's been logged off so long his might have expired.
---
You can be promoted to CEO as an alpha. As long as you don't update with CEO skills you keep old CEO numbers.
---
signal cartel is a non aggressive entity, if they find it they will leave you alone.
---
thanks dude
---
For my corp, a dread, a fax and maybe a carrier in the hole will be for home defense. Dread for easily dpsing down structures, control towers, etc. Fax for supporting a home defense fleet and hard to kill logi, and a carrier for supporting the defense fleet with dps in a high ehp ship. 
---
Besides having maybe two of each, and maybe a few rorquals, capitals in a low class wormhole are not worth it. Rorquals are probably one of the exceptions since they are super miners. Gotta replace those rolling ships somehow.
---
Eve Echoes was piss poor imo &amp; Another Galaxy is a much more polished eve mobile game. CCP missed the boat frankly and making echoes a separate platform just shows how inept ccp actually are.
---
granted I already have regen badgers as cyno close to hubs but seeding them in line with my routes to curse or stain makes me wanna kms
---
It's really nice, but the color of the lighting does not fit the redish/incandescent light typically used by the minmatar
---
A wallet warrior are you ?   Way to get your game on
---
Funny inside joke for literally anyone:
---
Local all-chat is an interesting and thought-out way to obtain info on player presence.
---
Because CCP decided to make life really difficult for themselves and made 3x sizes of weapon, each with different ranges and tracking speeds, each of which can be fitted to more than one size of ship - and then sat there wondering why the game was so hard to balance...
---
I don't think pay for a game you want is bad, or why ccp invited PLEXs?
---
You care about one standings or joined standings while ignoring the rest - there is no reasonable way to get to the point that "every NPC faction like you" . 
---
There are kind of back doors when you can work it out on low level missions and riding on the rounding error, or use drugs that are about to expire - but tere is no reason to keep all factions liking you. 
---
     
---
Aka expect if you do missions for vile Caldari and kill Sansha Nation ships ... you will not be welcomed in Stain.             
---
The classic rules apply if Amarr like you due to actions the Minamatars will hate you.             
---
If you are asking about to "how" to grind the specific faction standings.          
---
Then yes :            
---
* COSMOS          
---
* Epic Arts         
---
* FW       
---
* Mission running (base missions give mostly boost to agent, but Story line boost the faction standings).            
---
* Pay someone to boost your standings with specific corporation.

Running JF contracts has a starting price of about 10b. Now add the 10± bil collateral, cost of fuel, time spent setting up the chain and scouting it out, either building or moving your indy into the system, and timing it all right, I'd say the OP is spot on. I occasionally run courier contracts with a well known hauling corp and have decided to not do any further JF jobs. It was already cancer but now it also has crabs.
---
Dust wouldnt have existed without Sony ponying up part of the development money.  In turn they expected an exclusivity clause.
---
Its a shame, because likely Dust would have been a massively superior game on the PC, but thems the breaks.
---
This!
---
Just Hilmar trying to retain new players.
---
You can only bump it, if the pilot is an idiot.
---
Too bad QFC died. Plenty of free real estate if someone wants to move in.
---
i bet it was a wormholer :-)
---
HA HA HA THIS IS WHAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU LET CHINA PLAY YOUR GAME, THEY DON'T THINK BOTTING IS CHEETING! ON THE SERINITY SERVER THE GOVERMENT WAS LIKE NO! YOU CAN'T BAN THE BOTS
---
region block china is the only way to save eve.
---
You could just drop chain of cans and moving stuff bulk between them while leaving just 1 item so the can don't go poof
---
fozzie has said alot of things
---
like during the AMA 2 eve down unders ago. he said. on stage. that they deliberatly overbuffed the loki and would nerf it back into line after awhile..
---
ITS BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF FOZZIE!! WHERES THE FUCKING NERF!?
---
Yes obviously. 
---
But when you are coming in, well, you can't jump to Jita.
---
Another very important thing to note about JF'ing is profit margins related to fuel use. The "better" JF pilots will actually slow boat as much HS as possible to save on gas. There are 2 choices. You can cyno everywhere and minimize HS but you'll be tied down by jump fatigue, or you can cyno as little as possible and slow boat HS. Usually at the end of the slow boating your timer is ready for another full job. The savings can be, and usually are substantial. 
---
Which is where scouting comes in. Scouting is needed regardless to get to a HS hub, and the ganks take place in a handful of systems so its reasonably predictable. All you need is a scout and Emergency Cynos and it's low risk wise. It's just super boring to baby sit where guy with 20 clients is hanging out.
---
I've slow boated loads worth 140b to and from Delve. The only thing that would get me killed would be a disconnect while 20 client man is nearby.
---
It's not working.
---
Even shiftier things like...  DDOS your enemies comms would not work either.  Frat is destined for the dumpster and the shit they are pulling to try to stop it will do nothing but give them an enduring reputation as cheaters/poor losers/dirtbags/etc.
---
Just use https://eve-marketdata.com/
---
Look for NPC buy orders in your region.
---
sure but this would mean you have to use at least one non-alpha to make the larger corporation, but since you can do a 10 man corp this is still a yes in the end :)
---
Current plan.
---
1. Grind up to level 4 missions
---
2. Build up some cash, so if step 3 goes poorly, I don't loose everything
---
3. Join null sec or wormhole corporation, upgrade to omega account at this time
---
4. Rat, mine, etc for more cash, basically pay my taxes and do what I want. I have no interest in big fleet actions or PvP in general. I want to the be the guy panning for gold, oblivious to the world burning down around him.
---

---
It was a real thing that a wormhole group used to blitz sites and destroy invaders.
---
That video gives a great narrative of trying to evict them and covers the exploit.
---
But basically:
---
1. Their wormhole gave ewar bonuses (like tracking disruption)
---
2. They used friendly tracking disruptors to disrupt their dreads to negative tracking
---
3. Due to an overflow error, this instead gave the dreads perfectly insane tracking.
---
4. When plugged into the hit formula, this insane number would grant wrecking blows 100% of the time at any distance, against a target of any size/speed.
---
ChAoS eRa
---
Destroyers are a dime a dozen.
---
The algos will always be a fav, very strong with all of its drones.
---
&gt; they are always correcting trajectory
---
They don't need to though.
---
They increase the trajectory correction as they get closer to fine tune, and good prediction in the first place midigates this.
---
&gt; How small?
---
The amount to get up to a suitable and efficient travel speed (it's already a limited speed in the game)
---
the security statut (High-sec, Low-sce, Null-sec) is more about pvp safety than pve level. there are some chalenging Pve in HS (incurtion, invasion, Lv4 burner...).
---
He's a walking advert for the Bolshevik revolution.
---
Declining more than 1/4h reduces corp and faction standings too.
---
Storyline missions give derived standings to friends and enemies of the mission giver faction. You will go below 0 from those if you do them alot (see the wiki for how derived standings work).
---
COSMOS missions do give derived standings so you will lose standing with the enemies of the faction. Same as storyline missions.
---
If you want to get good standings with empire factions grind the corp standings to start epic arcs. Then you can easily keep all four at good standing.
---

---
right
---
When CCP even do it themselves with a PLEX store, you know they're not really interested in your gameplay perspective.
---
Yup it’s this behavior that doesn’t even earn them a “GF” at the end of the day.  Trying to DDOS their opponents mumble during the fight really is a new low even for frat.
---
Caps are good defense. Rorquals can put out a ton of drone dps with good self tank, can shield rep and can neut.
---
Nova came out with a tech demo for either fanfest or eve Vegas, can't remember.
---
The conclusion was that there wasn't anything special about the game to set it apart from every other FPS, so CCP said that they're gonna start over to make a game that we actually want.
---
I've actually been trying to help this corp for like two months now.
---
They aren't terrible, although their KB is absolutely terrible. There are some smart new players in it and people who can find the undock button without help, but as with most noob corps that just invite every day old player they see, they suffer from quantity over quality.
---
Implying that nothing will come out the last 3 months??
---
nothing
---
Goons are behind it all! 😂
---
Maybe if the assets bought with this rmt bs wasn’t nearly impossible to kill and completely broken in strength compared with the sub caps, I like to fly, game would feel better again to me.  Taking an indefinite break until this garbage isn’t so op.
---
If i would like to fit into some fleet ops, is it worth to skill command ship AND missile based (like damnation or nighthawk)? I dont think there are other combinations of support ships and missile ships?
---
In terms of PVP fits I assume that its mostly T2 frigs you're talking about? Like hawk/crow/jaguar or worm/garmur etc?
---
I mean nothing's been announced - Maybe we'll hear about something in Vegas, but that seems super unlikely to me given that the entirety of their 2 main dev teams are currently focused on the NPE, so I'd expect actual new content/balance to be in Spring at earliest.
---
hey since this is not illy pass it along to him :P ..See you when you come back. will still be here as always hunting and killing.. now if i can convince nash to move to higher class space...... yea probably not lol
---
I bet creating lowsec gate to Stain will be great NPE addition!
---
Dust wasn't built from scratch, it's an Unreal Engine based game.
---
Botting discovered.
---
SpidermanCloneMeme.jpg
---
It means "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Is this a new thing? Does this mean you will receive a notice every time someone you report actually get banned? Or did they just bulk to all reports processed today?
---
If you are looking for high risk, high rewar, WH is the place to be. It may require some investment btw (knowledge, isk and SP).if done right, daytriping can make good isk, or a shiny kill mail
---
This video seems at least 16 minutes and 15 seconds too long.
---
lots of people left the game, goons holds majority of the players, it would be so catagoricly unlikely for no goons to of quit eve because thier bots dont work for this not to be the case.
---
goons hide it well? goons asked ccp to leave them alone a while so they dont get all the cussing? but i like ive said this reply/comment of mine is more focused towards a goon saying goons way of life is not him, bot or no bot, we were actually referring to nullblocs powerhousing etc etc, 
---
im merely saying if your a goon, you support all the life choices of goonswarm. all its blues, its wars, its meta gameplay, its citadel spam,  everything
---
Been there and done it, remember it being an absolute blast and incredible for making isk, is a class 3 still soloable in T3 cruisers?
---
&gt;WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? ARE THESE AI FAKE PLAYERS PLANTED BY CCP TO BOOST THEIR PLAYERCOUNT????? HELLO?
---
LOL
---
But to answer your question... LOL
---
"We will deal with simple farmers" - yeah, i think i have heard that one before....
---
Says no one thats done large scale logistics.
---
Honestly at this point I expect them to make a Lowsec gate to Stain that goes directly into like a Drifter Hive or something just to fuck with you.
---
Ahh I didn’t realize that.  
---
Very well sir I’ll give a watch!
---
sell it.  
---
2 kind of people may want it : the inhabitant or people who want evict inhabitant.  
---
if you can sell it SD after strip fiting is the less worst thing to do  
---
(or drop a fortizar, insure and SD but it seem a lots of work for a single dread)
---
No its not, it hasnt been. That was thrown around at a fanfest fucking years ago and literally everything ccp can do has gone against that stupid fucking mentality. CCP doesnt give 2 shits about local production. There are several things that could easily do that would eliminate or greater reduce the need to outsource or import but they dont.
---
This change was just a fucking kneejerk reaction to whining about the covert cyno jf change. Which was a kneejerk reaction to other bullshit. All half thought out changes made by people who DO NOT PLAY THE GAME.
---
Fuckin' A
---
I feel ya Dunk.
---
&gt; If this is legit, report it to CCP
---
CCP cannot action this report by their own rules as the infraction happened outside the game.  This screenshot is entirely useless.
---
things ccp did right this year: finally fixing shit that should've been fixed years ago.
---
better late than never, i guess?
---
In API or just for CCP only?
---
so let me get this straight. If you don't like the way the game is being developed you need to be vocal about it, however if you are on r/eve and saying stuff other than "oh CCP plz let me suck your dick, you're doing a great job" you have to fuck off... so how the fuck do you change the game then?
---
you do realize that if you keep telling people to fuck off your sub every time they don't like shit there will eventually be no one left...
---
Yes
---
Out of curiosity did it let you trade directly with other players?
---
Do you mean Second Galaxy?
---
stealing vonholes kills, thats actually illegal
---
Google searched Another Galaxy couldn't find it
---
Daedes is one better than Caedes?
---
Action was taken. That is all. So it will say same thing if they got banned, an official warning, a stern talking to, or even just a note on their record.
---
He's focked
---
Ah, ok.
---
It was pretty cool. I felt like I was playing eve. The training on it was a pain so I hope they fix that. Graphics were nice but I wish there was a potato mode. The auto combat and orbit were very useful for fighting. I would very much recommend it.
---
Stainguy's worst advertising strategy yet
---
since it's just a T1 ship it was never meant to be expensive, but also not that strong.
---
As seen with old strong minmatar ships (original Cane, Svipul etc) combining a combatship with 2 or more utility neuts gets really nasty, Ved fitting was limited because CCP was scared of that. So fitting 2 or 3 neuts is not possible without sacrifices. Always had 3 small neuts on mine to defend against Jags etc.
---
The Veds limited weapon range and extremely high speed can get annoying to fly. With just one mwd cycle you will fly out of your range and reset your damage. I found myself doubleclicking alot just to immideatly ctrl-space again. Alot of imput required to sit where you want to, compared to Phantasm.
---
Ikit is pretty chill.
---
&gt;Why bother playing the game and working hard for anything? 
---
Put the work into scoring top-tier marshal kills, sell the loot and skip the entire isk grinding game yourself. You don't want a job in a video game anyway, just cut to the awesome part.
---
is my charr u fockers...finaly bit the dust...what can i say?was fun to fly and got rekt.GF
---
&gt; I excplicitly do not speak of the bad hisec mechanics exploit goons are running with miniluv.
---
Did you even read?
---
This ^^ it was exactly that. Plus constant content. Intercepting a rival alliances supply convoy was a huge logistics win. But we were looking for pulse pounding risky PvP back then. It's way more intense when you have something to lose (besides your SRP'ed ship)
---
Hold on to your butts.
---
I do understand that, but I've never received any such confirmation before on reports. Got them all in one batch (reported diff bots on diff accounts), so my question was if they changed up to actually give you some verification that your reports led to an outcome or if they just blasted out a one-off confirmation today to a lot of people.
---
It's nice to get acknowledgement that the reports didn't just go into a black hole.
---
It is.
---
They can look into large amounts of isk being moved into WinterCo hands, and double check it for suspicious activity.
---
F my dude
---
Pretty saedes.
---
CCP is a really really big shit
---
No, a C is better than a D.
---
Im gonna take the time here just to say
---
Nerf the fuckin loki
---
[https://i.imgur.com/m1P2eKf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/m1P2eKf.jpg) sebo didn't help :(
---
Ahh, gotcha. Not sure on if you will ever see another, they can't make up their minds about much at all lately after all lol.
---
The real question, is how much they are paying TEST from that.
---
I know how much KWG used to pay, and IGC now (and of course all bots.) and dont start the bullshit about proof. u'd be a retard lying to yourself.
---
Not sure if that is gonna help poor Dunk.
---
F
---
It would be nice if they gave you a little something too - doesn't have to be anything crazy, but a single plex or two, some kind of "bothunter" skin (Police skins?), or something like that.
---
Less than a paragraph if unsubstantiated bullshit in a convo. If you have proof, file it with CCP. If not, stop trying to justify Frat botting - which is proven by CCP - by saying, 'It's ok, the other Chinese guys do it, too'.
---
Goons take the simple route, it might not be the fastest, but atleast most of our spodbrainers can follow it, some however still fail but that is to be expected
---
Lol, you are funny guy.
---
There are lots of reasons for changing the way JF get around and while I'm sure we won't all agree on them, they at least have some logic and thought behind them.
---
But what the fuck is the reason for having to light the cyno with an industrial?
---
PanFam evicting someone with less supers/tits and driving them into the arms of GOONS.
---
Where have I seen this before?
---
Tldr jintaan (a paid shill) sucks ccps dingus for 16 minutes
---
And none of it is proven here against AOM on TQ. Meanwhile, Elo is snorting RMT cocaine up his nose to do 18hr shifts on Eve.
---
I think init and goons just hate pankrab. Probably a third party on roam or somethen.
---
Not what my girlfriend says
---
&gt; Train the magic 14 skills early on. (check eve uni for info)
---
this one is the best advice in the thread. OP, you won't want to and it'll seem like you're wasting time but you'll really want these skills out of the way as early as possible. You'll look back and thank HerrSchmitz eventually.
---
the skills are the basic ones like capacitor management, fitting skills, etc. The game starts you off with a very limited ability to put things on your ship. These skills translate to all ship types and should be prioritized over training the ships themselves. It is frustrating and you're going to feel like you're getting nowhere for a month or two but it's incredibly important.
---
or, just inject them because it's 2019 and you can.
---
Idk, for simply teleporting things around it certainly took up a lot of my freetime of the day.
---
This game is no where near as toxic as it's reputation paints it to be, at least in game and we are generally pretty good to newbros looking for help and advice.
---
r/eve is toxic as fuck though, full of salty cunts, most of which don't even play anymore and just want to shit on everything.
---
Since the Daedes killers are not registered on reddit and I was in a channel nextdoor to them on teamspeak, here is the AAR:
---
A yolo caedes was spotted, a hound with weird exploration fit was lost in Tama to become a good target for our guy. With only 36km disruptor heated it headed to Stain for a relic site. Time has come, caedes decloaked at 28km and surprisingly it was staying with 0 speed for over 5 seconds. Covops cyno up, sebo loki came in, webs/disruptor landed. Caedes was insta blapped and 3rd guy on fleet didnt manage to get on killmail sadly.
---
Hell I would never go for a special edition ship with only a warp disruptor as initial tackle.
---
Any NC fleet and undocked is free game for all kinds of blobing.
---
*slaps roof of EvE online server building*
---
this baby can fit so many unpaid "bot hunters", why bother doing anything ourselves...
---
Shut the fuck up you idiot. You dont get to pull that card.  You knew exactly what they were, and what they will do when TEST gave them an entire region; EVERYONE warned pgl/vily of this and they still did it.
---
Fly through omist and you will see plenty of ishtar/myrm bots.  Not saying FRT doesnt have a botting plague either, but dont live in denial.
---
If how league of legends handles it is anything to go by, getting a notification that action was taken is satisfying enough. (Plus giving rewards could be gamed)
---
yeah i was busy switching long range ammo and saw too late cyno going up...my guess was dbl web loki?
---
No action is still "action taken" though, don't forget that. A good chance is those e-mails are just sent at random to people with a lot of bot reporting activity to make it seem as if CCP is actually doing something...
---
You have 0 proof. If you did, those bots would already be gone. We know. We've reported hundreds of FRTs bots, and CCP deleted them by the thousands - including entire corps. Prove it. We did.
---
adds unnecessary complexity
---
&gt;there's a difference between "Rat" and "Pirate"
---
unless you're a PIRAT
---
gotta press ctrl+LMB harder. makes it lock faster.
---
I want to reach 6.0 in one corporation (let's say Caldari Navy) and keep the opposing factions around 0.0 (lets say Gallente).
---
I decline faction rat missions as I don't play a ton each day, so declining isn't hard.
---
That's going to be a hard question to answer. I don't think anybody publishes the rewards they give their recruiters. Some larger corps may pay their recruiters in ISK or free ships since they're spending a significant amount of time doing work for the alliance rather than ratting for their own income. In most corps, staff are volunteers.
---
You must be really active and bad to loose essentially a titan worth of ISK every day, every month.
---
I would be inclined to agree if this was an eviction.
---
So tldr; NC docks again and cries about blobbing and blue donuts. Got it.
---
See at that point it becomes a question of back stability; there's a point where the human spine and lower back muscles aren't designed to handle it anymore
---
Structural issues aside though, there is a definite case to be made for D over C.
---
Also she's one of those damned *heterosexuals* isn't she
---
no one knows you bud
---
nah he does it for free
---
If you've got an ent I can bring in some guys also. If not you can call scout cartel they can usually find a specific wormhole if you ask/pay enough
---
You'd still have to move the isk in and out of that account.  Creating a very obvious trail.
---
says the guy who brigades about the biggest botting ring on server in the last year not being bad.. ok
---
Could it be that some people just like to rat, mine, and all around pve? Blackout ruined that and I'm saying this as an original fan of the blackout. The events are fun but should be temporary. CCP should have iterated on the blackout. But they are a bad game developer and reverted when the active character count dropped significantly. Factor in cyno changes and now ratters need two accounts at omega if they want cyno support. 
---
In the end, this is a game and no other game requires you to be paying for 2+ accounts to do basic shit. Again, I'm not in Null anymore and know what CCP did sounded great in theory but the execution was poor. 
---
I'm not going to waste my time on moronic conspiracy theories. We can have legitimate complaints about Goons without idiotic unsupported conspiracy theories.
---
Did they actually undock. Screenshots or it didn't happen.
---
You're the numb nutted fuckboi that that assumed I was in test. Perhaps if you got that dock out of your add long enough to think straight, you'd realize that I was a Goon. Nowadays, I play games where the devs don't power trip on their player base and do actual marketing for their game. Eve will die, and all of your sense of self-relavence will die with it. Take some free advice and stay away from anything sharp for awhile bucko. Hate to have another sob story.
---
Moronic westerners running mouth again.. not entitled to fights go eat rat you mongrel
---
like ive said, and plenty of others, if you like to rat, and you just like pve.
---
hisec is still available. infact, for more than a decade PVE players did ratting and mission running in hisec.
---
and like ive said many times, injectors got the hisec carebears into the rorquals and supers that ruined the game xD lol just so happens they all joined goons. goons must of done a huge recruitment plan on hisec mission runners and miners.
---
the game should not fit around pve'er...they can pve fine, but the game is a pvp game. and its not impossable. just more difficult.
---
&gt; says the guy who brigades about the biggest botting ring on server in the last year not being bad.. ok
---
Wat? Either you dislexic or just a filthy liar .... I hate all of you whiney krabs, bigmouthing when daddy is behind you protecting you.
---
I am sure not brigading for any of the groups that currently kill the game economy, I just hate bigots and hypocrites, pointing their finger on others for things their own group has been doing knowingly and deliberate for years. Just makes you look even more pathetic then the guys you point at...
---
Legacy holds responsible for at least (proven and exposed) 18 Nyx-Bots in Omist, and after one of the 1st local bots broke that bot and a WH group killed them, the group moved closer to daddy Legacy and farmed Feythabolis for close to a year with over 300 Gila-Bots. The botting group knowingly paid 300 Billion ISK for protection to Legacy.
---
They have 69 pages of history on zKill:
---
* 1-40: 2019
---
* 41: 2019-2017
---
* 42: 2017-2016
---
* 43-69: 2016 - Apr 2015
---
So that seems to me as if it's one person - or a small number of people controlling a lot of characters. I've seen similar behavior from ARTON/PHEW/HTP alt corps. Those guys run a huge number of alts, build up backstories, troll each other etc.
---
waifu pillows don´t talk. get professional help.
---
Made it though the whole video, and then right at the end, SlowMotionOhNo.gif. Don't wipe your eye with the same napkin you wipe your mouth with, get that prep work in first. Red hankie = mouth, White hankie = eye. Hope you got lucky and found a corner the Satan particles weren't attached to.
---
AoM is not WinterCo... They’re literally fighting WinterCo at the moment with TAPI. How did you mix this up?
---
&gt;Wanted a Russian alliance built around him, and his prominence to rival UAxDeath, Evil Thug and Vuk Lau. Son of an aluminum tycoon supposedly.
---
Vuk Lau is serbian, not russian.
---
I think simply because its called an industrial cyno. I think they just messed up in their thinking cause there is no reason I can think of.
---
Idk, I feel its just messed up.
---
NC doesn't have supercaps deployed.
---
You guys should rekindle
---
you can't scan down anything while gate cloaked
---
Too true...
---
You can reduce the amount of titans to a 25% of links  
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/group/30/losses](https://zkillboard.com/group/30/losses)

Like a posthumous (you've quit by then) medal for being such an "above and beyond" player when you were still playing.

slowpoke.jpg
---
My man, TEST alliance also partakes in propaganda activities.
---
Thats also true. It isnt really until you hit high SP numbers that you dont really think about what youre skilling anymore. Hmm ye I dunno which of the sides that pull the hardest actually, it might not do anything relevant as you say. It might pull hard enough if we have a lot of events going after each other. But since thats not likely to happen then ye I would have to agree more with your view.
---
Nice catch!
---
Let me phrase it this way. If we launch a rocket in to space after it gets to Geo sync it still uses fuel to correct itself. if it has to move anywhere else again more fuel. Put this to a missile. You launch it even if it's controlled burn for further range it still consumes fuel to correct itself. If I'm trying to hit a moving Target that's orbiting me it's going to take a decent chunk of fuel to correct for that. 
---
Never implied there was a cap on range. Only that stuff dosent just go forever it eventually runs out of fuel and becomes usless.
---
So even if you are right and they conserve fuel *which they don't* there still is a max effective range. Yes in theory you could launch it let it fly x distance then turn on the engine but the range would just start from where the engine was turned on NOT launched.. see my point? There is always a limited amount of fuel onboard.
---
So fight over the things money *can't* buy. Sovereignty, control over a wormhole, take control of the FW warzone, or something. Mercenaries aren't much of a thing anymore, so while money can buy ships, it can't buy good pilots, and all those things I just listed require good pilots and a good plan.
---
Titans have been increasing in number exponentially since 2007.
---
what was fixed?
---
Going in was bad, hes got a surprise when it goes out...
---
&gt; Geo sync it still uses fuel to correct itself
---
Mainly due to orbital decay.
---
Voyager isn't making more corrections.
---
&gt; t's going to take a decent chunk of fuel to correct for that.
---
Or a better prediction. The missiles in EVE are just really dumb and just burn directly at the target with no prediction whatsoever.
---
An orbiting target would be easy to hit with minimal corrections.
---
&gt; range would just start from where the engine was turned on NOT launched
---
This is assuming an engine that can only be lit once.

I mean I agree with your idea more sp means less extractor pressure but unless it's a silly amount of SP I doubt it would have any real effect due to MORE SP BETTER SP mentality I mentioned.  But In tandem with a heavy Plex sale we could see some relief it's unlikely and kinda dumb for CCP to give us enough sp that it actually matters. And Plex sales never last long enough or go on deep enough sale IMHO lol.

local. but then it didn´t.

But but.../r/eve says big super capital brawls happen all the time and that the whole game needs to be balanced around them happening all the time!

ouch

If you think you're going to be evicted, a nice supply of carriers and FAXes goes a long way, especially since carriers don't need to siege to do dps so they should never die as long as your faxes are alive.

2017 actually. It was surprisingly stagnant from 2012 to 2015/16ish.

---
whats so sad is to see 50+ titans get droped both sides and 2 die xD
---
when u drop supers/titans u are gona kill all enemy super caps or lose your your not sopose to be abal to escape 1 side lose all titan/super and it will start to go down
---
everyone who doesnt own atleast 1 titan today is actually a looser
---
i hope one day i will be a winner
---
i rather have 50 deads then i have a titan more fun to do
---
Add circle agents, this is a set of "courier" type L1 agents that move you around and finish where you started.
---
First off: Why?
---
Why do you care?
---
Then where did all the Titans in B-R come from? Maybe it leveled off from around 2012 to 2015, but from 2007 to 2012 there was still a huge increase
---
&gt;Most of us in 0-Cal are users
---
ok but he's talking about the preview program
---
fitting typo
---
i dont think you know what failcascading means
---
Its a sandbox game, who are you to say what we can and cannot do?
---
Fake news, doesn't fit the narrative, so must be glossed over. This is Reddit after all.
---
&gt; To my disappointment, the faction grind for mission running is still there as is the story line mission faction increase/screw.
---
lol
---
Like honestly i still don't get how NC don't get simple fact that Goons will do all of this just to fuck up NC plans about new renter space.          
---
Like it is so simple
---
but it's already #BALANCED
---
NC doesn't have supercaps. FTFY
---
In fact, NC doesn't exist as far as I know.
---
Hey, I'm one of the guys on the team that brought this out recently. It's a very new thing.
---
One of the points of feedback on the bot report process for a long time has been that it feels like your reports just go into a black hole. That was something we wanted to fix in a sustainable and ongoing way, so this system hooks into the security team's existing pipeline to thank players when their reports lead to concrete action.
---
**DO NOT DO THIS!**
---
they finally put in a select/unselect all button for the redeeming queue.
---
not sure why it took until 2019 to get basic functionality like that, but there we go.
---
An Alpha should not be able to fly a Dreadnaught.
---
&gt;Frat have botted unlike any other alliance in the history of eve.
---
i see someone never went to the dronelands for the decade or so xix controlled it
---
Single target DDs look kinda crap. I heard you need around 15 of them to take out another titan.
---
An Alpha clone can’t fly a dread. Period.
---
What you want to do is to reach out to Signal Cartel and set up a deal with them. They are seriously honour-driven, their pilot\[s\] would not be allowed to scam you out of your boat.
---
this is how you get floods of false positives from players just trying to get  rewards by mass reporting instead of reporting people they think are actually botting.
---
nothing makes people feel valued like an impersonal generic copy and paste reply!
---
From 2007 to 2012 we went from a small handful of Titans to 50 man Titan fleets, with move ops of close to 100.  
---
From 2012 to 2015 with the sole exception of b-r (where iirc a grand total of 75 titans died, which needed the combined Titan fleet of several alliances to happen) we had... pretty much zero Titan fleets if we're being honest since they were useless except as backup for supers/carriers which did all the real work, but generally when they were it was much the same, 50 man fleets. Move ops were about the same, maybe 100-200 max.  
---
Enter 2017 and rorquals, and now only 2 years later goons moved.... well over 1,000 titans and we had several 300+ titans on each side in 2018 with NC vs goons.  
---
That's the real increase.
---
love a lot of these ideas. this one is a bit weird:
---
&gt;Low power structures in hisec can be attacked without a wardec, but this generates a suspect timer
---
why would concord allow you to attack a low power structure without a war? it's easy enough to put up a war dec and if it has no timers what's the difference
---
That's not fair to a guy who hangs his hat on spending three years destroying combat cepters. His single, shining accomplishment in three years as CSM.
---
Wow ok fuck you then, I guess I'll go back to eating my potatoes. Thanks Seddow for doing me a favor and sending my SIG home.
---
I think so. check your fit Vs the damage/neutra you will face  
---

---
T3 can be good for day tripping, versatility, able to scan, hide yourself if needed. plus, T3c can now refit their rigs without destroy them.  
---
tengu or legion are know as good Pve ships (spare cargo space with laser), loki is good at everything, proteus have some specific use in Pvp
---
Nice editing of 2 devs into 2 dev teams. That’s still two more devs than I thought they had working on eve.
---
he's a returning player, they allow that because it'd discourage their returning players to come back if they stopped them from logging.
---
Well I've got a tengu already fitted, I think it was for c3s but it's been that long I can't remember, can also fly a Loki but you need to buy and fit
---
Cheers for the help, will give it another look
---
Theres a lot of hate towards chinese and a lot of it is coming from the botting aspect. But then you have assholes who are gonna be bigots and that sadly how the world works.
---
But this isnt the majority speaking, for most of us you guys are more than welcome to TQ and I sincerely believe the game will be more interesting when you guys have become stronger. And I havent heard CCP single you out as botters so innocent until proven otherwise.
---
Welcome to the server!
---
ofc ban them all. its just funny to see how tapi runs a ''war against botters'' while they protected/protect groups that bottet for years and even admitted it openly on reddit.
---
Wait they got something right ?
---
I know, and since you’re so smart, you probably know why he wanted to be of the same in-game prominence as Vuk ;)
---
&gt;Ticklemyshoes
---
Would you mind giving us your ingame name or fit please ?
---
Deeply moved. Thanks for your understanding &lt;3
---
Over 200 titans were involved in B-R. And that wasn't a prepared battle either, no one knew it was happening until it happened. So there were more Titans in the game that just weren't able to get themselves over to the fight or log on at all, especially since it was during a weekday.
---
Before the Halloween war everyone was blue, so obviously no one was fighting each other with their superfleet. Afterwards, goonswarm had uncontested supercapital supremacy, so no one bothered fighting them with a serious capital force, so they didn't need their supercaps for anything. Then in 4 more years you get X-47 with like 700 Titans.
---
Make gas possible to compress PLEASE
---
I just finished training for it.  Let me get a couple months please.
---
You might think that, but valve definitely found people enjoyed the auto pop-up saying their report has lead to action.
---
Found the guy who has never RMT'd
---
Ok your clearly don't understand what I'm saying.. actually I think your that code loser using wingspans flair I spoke to on another thread. I'll try this one more time
---
 Voyager dosent because it can't.. simple as that. It barely has enough power to run its instruments NVM the thrusters NVM the fuel for said thrusters and the reason it keeps going UNCORRECTED is because it has velocity. Fixing it would consumes it's entire fuel which is why they've left it alone instead of trying to fix it. So what's your point?
---
So translating to eve. If I launch a missile it's going to have velocity in ONE DIRECTION so if something is orbiting me it will have to correct for the velocity it has leaving the tube and force itself into a turn. Now if it was chasing something that wasn't moving like ships in eve and more like a Voyager it would act as you say. Burning to get speed then turn the thruster off. Till it gets closer. As Voyager is on a rather linear course. A ship fighting you on the other hand is far from linear.
---
Well in Eve's case they can only be lit once they're basically mindless rockets with a guidance system.
---
You don't have to believe me it's fine.
---
Only point ol straight up give you is eve missiles are pretty dumb. Yes absolutely are compared to even what we can build today.
---
i like the creativity but the idea itself here is pretty weak, more unnecessary complexity
---
&gt; TLDR version: The Imperium once again enjoys showing up to shit on NC, why do they have to be so mean to us?
---
I was not aware of that.
---
If he’s a returning player then he has to Omega his account and not fuck around with it.
---
Omega up -&gt; get the right boat -&gt; go to where the C2 is -&gt; start up the Dread -&gt; get your ass out of there.
---
There is speculation heaped on top of speculation there.  The terms of the deal have never been made public to anyone but the stakeholders as far as Im aware.
---
Ahem, I doubt someone can just show up and go "yeah you're all fired" with no severance no nothing. That's not up to some contract Hilmar was talking about, but Icelandic labor laws.
---
But to focus on your question more, not giving a bunch of developers their money serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever. "HA! You failed to save your game and you suck, that will teach you?"
---
If anything, it would increase the likelihood that PA has difficulties getting other companies on board with them, if they create such a track record.
---
&gt; looser
---
Your post is great, can't decide if your title of 'bad alliance' is intentionally ironic.  Making any community in eve is a thankless task and should be celebrated. Regardless of reddit rating
---
this is called "approximate string matching" or "fuzzy matching"
---
and eve doesn't have it. not sure why.
---
In the real world, where we need things like an income to survive.
---
Eve is supposed to be entertainment.  The floor for "this job is too crappy" is much, much higher than in real life.  And people can just stop playing.
---
No, you sell the farm with all the ISK.
---
Braver (or richer) man than me using the non-tanky T2 hauler for a cyno.
---
the first once or twice.
---
sure.
---
after that?  it's just more mail to get caught by the spam filter.
---
As others have said, Wingspan can find a specific WH for you. They either do generic discovery (find me an unoccupied C2 with a static C3 and HS connection, for example) or specific, based on the J-code. 
---
They don't care what you want it for, and will give you a guaranteed grace period (normally 24 hours) of no hostile acts from the corp after you enter it.
---
As a player with a former connection with Wingspan, I can say the service is reliable, and given the amount of scanning they do, if it's a C2 with a static HS they'll probably find it pretty quickly.
---
be nc.
---
shit
---
The pathway to a healthier game involves these ships having a point and purpose and dying significantly more frequently. Its too late to "stop" the arms race now there needs to be some work done making sure they have a use and that use involves occasional loss.
---
I think what a lot of the games supercapital fleets are waiting to see is how the cyno changes will affect their escalations. It hasnt happened a lot since those changes went in but maybe what you see is a small fraction of a super fleet get through a jump only to be stranded when the cyno gets poppped and a feeding frenzy commence.
---
&gt; Now if it was chasing something that wasn't moving like ships in eve
---
You are implying that all ships in EVE are moving in a non-predictable matter.
---
Which they aren't.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLS90nEpIkI
---
There's a video of actually shooting down something in space that is  moving.
---
They don't just burn 100% of the fuel in one go and then drift forever. They do periodic burns. If it wasn't for needing to fight gravity and air resistance at the start, the starting burn would be much much smaller.
---
If a target is moving in a constant manner, the missiles would have virtually infinite range and be effective
---
Not 100% arbitrarily stop.
---
its better than absolutely nothing indicating success. getting confirmation that your additional effort actually leads to something tangible is a good way to help encourage people not to just become apathetic. it's not realistic to expect anything beyond a generic message given how these things scale.
---
Yea your 100% not listening. So have fun
---
I don't know how any group would be willing to sit and try to burn through that many Australian TZ timers. There's basically no way to kill them fast enough to make a meaningful impact. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm in / rooting for brave here, but idk what strategy would work beyond moving all our members to irl Australia.
---
I can only hope the minutes reflect me bringing this issue to the forefront yet again.
---
Unsurprisingly most of CCP's Devs don't want to interact with the general community.
---
Thank you!
---
You're 100% not poaying attention to real science.
---
Yes, there may be an eventual limit to the range, based on the needs to correct, but a predictably moving target dramatically reduces that need. Like an orbiting target at a set speed.
---
The rumors floating out of the Russian language forums and communities at the time, was that it was Vuk Lau, and a Romanian, who won EVE a long time ago, and now a days just travels the world, that sold him the RMT assets to begin with.
---
It became quite a big story back then, as the guy apparently went to rant in some Cyrillic forum about how weird this game was, that he had bought assets fair and square from some guys, but the assets were taken away from him by the game company, but no biggie - he had just replaced it by buying the officially sanctioned PLEX instead, and in the process implying that CCP was just like the Russian mafia - that they just wanted their cut.
---
People then started asking CCP why he wasn't permabanned for buying trillions worth of RMT assets, why they were only confiscated, and if him buying €100k in Plex afterwards was the reason for the lenient treatment. No real answers were given though.
---
Pics or it didnt happen
---
I bet someone, if there is someone in the hole, will buy it.  Especially if you offer it really cheap with the fit.   Or they may just kill you for the lols.  Id say worth the risk.  It's a dread after all.  not a huge loss.   Go rat for a few days to get it back.
---
I made a super spicy chili one day and made the mistake of rubbing my face. I wound up sitting outside crying with my face just hot swollen and red. 
---
Now I look like I'm in chem lab with gloves and lab goggles when I make that stuff.
---
instanced PVP like this would be HUGE. imagine being able to log in, pair up with a friend or two and near-instantly get into a gudfight situation. i have no idea why this has never been added to the game.
---
&gt;Daily, Weekly, Monthly PVP tournaments  
---
&gt;Ladder system or some other tournament setupFormats could be: Solo, duo small gang, pick up teams, etc.
---
Yes Tau AD and Hy are besties with 0-Cal
---
im not denying that supplying a modern mega alliance would be super hard, but thats precisely the point. like others have said, JF's, aside from providing an easy, risk free and very scaleable logistics capability, also neutralize many of the strategic factors that you would expect to play an important role in EVE - things like geography and supply lines. think of it this way - you have a mega alliance in the furthest areas of space, you'd think that this would have a real impact on things like logistics, but it really doesnt. whether you are close to the trade hubs or super far, doesnt really matter with JF's.
---
if it were up to me, i would remove JF's (or atleast heavily and progressively continue to nerf them up until they are eventually removed). if this causes groups to split up to try and find better logistics options (ie, by moving to areas where its closer to hisec, or where their supply lines arent constantly camped etc) this would be a good thing. it would populate the emptier parts of the galaxy, and justify being able to make the outer regions more valuable (because they are the hardest to live in).
---
that said, big groups would still be possible, as long as they had the genuine logistical organisation to match rather than relying on a few individuals to basically render all that irrelevant.
---
Lobbying CCP to fix citadels is about the only thing one could do.
---
Bitch because we get no feedback when we report. Bitch because we now get feedback when we report. Dam cant fucking please eve players.
---
That jacket is tremendous.
---
Yup, that is the single and only thing I did on the CSM. Had no involvement in the Wardec changes, the NSA changes to nerf ratting carriers, balance passes on several other ships, or Citadels 2.0. 
---
Just nerfed the one thing you cared about.
---
At this point I just want hilmar gone, and I’ll gladly pay for it to happen
---
More actual people played in the past, there is less and less people willing to do these things now. Games are not like they used to be, if you told a new player you will be consuming several evenings to setup new cyno chains for your alliance, they probably will say nope and stop. What this means is that, the megablocs will be more popular and anyone smaller will only have a handful of people to deal with logistics. 
---
If you told new people today that you'd be spending several evenings to escort freighters around low-sec and null, you'd probably have more people unsub than what blackout unsubs occurred.
---
Blackout is something I think we need, but not in the form that it came in. It needed to be more thought out, and definitely needed some form of "counter" but at a cost.
---
POS code.   
---
It's the only logical answer here.
---
God they must truly hate them, if they are willing to help gotg, and I mean truly hate
---
Nice! Reminds me somewhat of the Hangar Bays in Earth and Beyond.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they came up as an example during CSM summit discussions. I suppose we may see once the minutes are released.
---
So this is a surprise to anyone how ?
---
Not great big bags of coke?
---
oh no no no PepeLaugh
---
maa relikss
---
It's not a "matter of perspective." Objectively speaking in game items, be they minerals or ISK, have less value by the only metric that isn't bound by game mechanics: PLEX. Sales can affect PLEX price. But again the value of in game money, liquid or otherwise has gone down. "But my ISK can now buy a much cheaper pirate ship" doesn't mean your ISK got more powerful. Both ISK and ships have crashed in value despite having varying relation to each other. Again PLEX is the only value standard we can use because everything else in Eve of value is bound by PvE/player actions.
---
The key point there is PREDICTABLE. Eve is far from predictable mate. That's why I mentioned the linear tregectory of Voyager when you brought it up because THAT is why its still going it's GOING STRAIGHT and I mentioned IF the missile was tracking something STRAIGHT or in yours words a "predictable" trajectory. Absolutely it has a hugely extended range but if your following something that's moving like frigs rather erratically then your going to spend a boat load on fuel correcting for it.
---
But I'm done here. Weather you understand basic ballistic trajectory or not. Have fun.
---
And now just wonder how many isk all the leaders of tq rmt'ed by now. Don't act like AOM is the only one.
---
&gt; STRAIGHT
---
circles are also predictable.
---
99% of the time what you're shooting at doesn't change its behavior between the missile being fired and it hitting, even at long long ranges.
---
&gt; Weather

**Build an instanced, rated PVP system.**
---
Imagine being able to log in and near-instantly get into a gudfight situation (solo or with x buddies). This is simply never going to be an option without a new system designed to provide this kind of experience, given the nature of the game.
---
I know this has been brought up before, can anyone elucidate on why it has never been seriously considered? It seems like something that thousands more players would log into EVE every day for (and keep an active sub…)
---
It's at the point where CCP should be looking at radical new additions to the game… This is a way to add something in an isolated way that doesn't break anything else, has no impact on other playstyles. An option for PVP players who are are tired of logging in and not being able to get any content / don't have time to sit around for hours waiting for it.
---
Looks like a great way to rejuvenate the game… What's the hold up?
---
The indu guys first got the option to use covert cynos which are undetectable on the overview so you could have happily cynoed through safe spots. But everyone was massive butthurt and raged that it sucks, and now you got this. You guys just fucked yourself so hard.
---
Can you directly trade with other players? Did you get a pay to win feel at all? How much of the map is nullsec?
---
When i was in GE- for pirate day, they had let simple farmers put up structures DIRECTLY IN GE-!
---
Did you have an aneurysm while posting this?
---
Nope. It's a sandbox. Can do what you want where you want.
---
CCP only afaik.
---
It's kind of a running joke that we are 'the worst pirates you've heard of' and while it's true that we are pretty bad at the game mechanically it doesn't stop us from goofing around and picking fights here and there. 
---
Also you might wonder why I started the week on Tuesday and not [Monday](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003898/201909162100/).
---
E:D is Star Wars to EVE's Star Trek. They're similar in that they're sci-fis set in space and... that's about it.
---
In E:D you're the fighter/miner/hauler/explorer pilot building up their personal brand with various factions. You're in direct control of your ship at all times and can be best thought of as a contractor or Freelancer (:D). There is a faction metagame for players to indulge in but E:D is very much a game played at a personal level, for the most part.
---
In EVE, you're the captain of a larger vessel in a world where the faction metagame *is* the game for many people. You can of course fight pirates, mine asteroids, haul goods, and "explore" (it's quite different) and play the game on the same personal level, but the meat of the game for many people is being a part of the nullsec alliances. A similar game of control and violence plays out in the wormholes but its mechanics are quite different, and some prefer that instead. Either way, it's not just about bringing lasers but gathering intel, managing logistics and manpower, and leading fleets in tactical situations. In other words, there is an additional layer of abstraction between you and the game world, but that layer allows for deeper interactions via the economy and sovereignty systems.
---
tl;dr E:D you're fighting a duel, in EVE you're fighting a war. While that oversimplifies E:D's own faction meta (which does have some depth to it), it's a more-or-less accurate assessment of the scale of operations a typical player is engaging in.
---
I play eve with 1 character since the beginning
---
Surely the best way to deal with simple farmers would be to live in your SOV instead of having massive amounts of unused systems that act as a pipe for simple farmers to... farm your alliance members.
---
I'm not even being toxic, if you can't defend your pipe, maybe your holding too much sov for an alliance of your size?
---
They would be forced to PvP very quickly if such a Corp existed.
---
Same map as eve. No option to pay as of right now. Never tried to trade with a player so I don't know.
---
This was only the 1st round of testing. It felt very much unfinished.
---
The first statement I agree with. The second statement and conclusion sounds a good bit like tin-foil to me. Especially as one of the dev team directly commented above saying they just implemented it recently.
---
Let's see whether this time 秋枫 wins the lawsuit and make the botting literally legal.
---
( He won the lawsuit against the service provider of Chinese EVE server last time.
---
This can't be true!   They PROMISED they don't bot/RMT anymore, and everyone knows promises are real life!
---
it's not feedback. it's spam.
---
feedback you can do something with. which bot did you report that got banned? they don't tell you. so how do you know which of the accounts was actually a bot, and which was actually a player just acting odd? you don't. not even a location, or a time/date. at least then you'd have some kind of clue as to what was actually a bot so you don't end up submitting more false positives as you fumble around in the dark reporting everyone that isn't blue.
---
you can't do anything with a generic copy and paste reply, other than file it in your spam folder. that's why you only get an out of office auto reply after the first email and not for the second onwards - because after that first email it's just spam.
---
or maybe i underestimate how much people like participation medals these days.
---
But I have heard of you.
---
rubbish
---
Is this from when stations were cool? As in, Walk in Stations?
---
They spelled Hilmar's name correctly on his check.
---
VPN will probably do the trick. Its how foreigners in China access social media and other stuff while living there.
---
While there are a few good reasons to it we all know that te main one is that it takes a special set of skills to save face when publicly showing incompetence.
---
Because the conduits in invaded systems have already emerged. Also, the ones which visit you while you're mining are different and had been around for a few weeks when the Emerging Conduits came out.
---
&gt;balance passes on several other ships
---
Ah so on top of ceptor nerf you're the one that got us the prot nerf? WTF?
---
It's a trivial change that large jf operations were already doing.
---
No, more chaos. This entire video  proves the community is about figuring out the angles and working them immediately and efficiently. More nasty, unpredictable stuff that challenges everyone and makes such folks really struggle.
---
Good fight vs the Ferox's.  I thought for sure they were going to be rail fit.
---
I just started last night. when I try and use the companion app it says I have no characters? I made one last night and played for a few hours IDK why it's not showing up.  I have the same issue if I look at account management from the eve website.
---
Sell the rights to kill it. I’m sure there’s a fleet of ventures that would love to get a dread kill.
---
And have it be an exclave of Stain?
---
I agree, and that includes steep fees for false flagging. Perhaps 5% of your yearly isk turnover.
---
awesome
---
With the moongoo, IIRC there is no T2 ship you can build with only the goo in one region.  You'll have to import something.
---
With the ice, it does push some players to use one race's JF over another, and possibly affect bridging titan choice, but that's not exactly a large effect.
---
Also, the "good" ships are so much better than the other race's alternative that it's just not feasible to use the other race's option.  If you're going for cheap, then you're flying T1 ships.
---
I get making jfs just not able to do something, but if you just make the job still possible but 10x harder, there is literally no change except pushing career jf pilots to unsub.
---
Do you think that's sensitive intel? 
---
We can have even public and private info on this topic, like many teams, have pub/priv info for other things.
---
So, for public info, we should be able to get access to the R.P. easily and for the private side, as usual, we can get it from spies/leaks.
---
Volunteer = No ~~reward~~ program. 
---
Most teams will appear and disappear very quickly, so I don't think they would bring us a good reference most of the time.
---
I actually run a mining/Indy corp that operates in high sec, a small (20-30 people) one that is low drama and is used to training up newbies. 
---
Industry and manufacturing is heavily bonused by the security level of space your facilities are in, this is kind of a trade-off with transport. Basically,  the lower the security, the cheaper it is to make things but, the more difficult it is to transport them to market. My corp operates a c1 wormhole to offset this, it's a good gig, we get null sec bonuses but we're always 1 jump from high sec. 
---
DM me if you wanna talk, we're looking for more people and there's room in the wormhole for more stations if you and your friends decide to break-off but wanna stay close to us.
---
The biggest hurtle and bullshit that JFs face is HS ganks.
---
I used to operate out of delve daily with a JF fleet. These changes have virtually zero change for most established JF pilots and operations.
---
People blowing up JFs in 1.0 space while being massively isk positive is the only true shit thing to deal with.
---
Setting up cyno chains is simple business. I mean shit, I'm billing 460m ISK to move this garbage one way. Sorta worth setting up a reusable cyno chain.
---
Jf may be risk free in perfect theory, but it takes its toll in time and effort. To supply a major alliance i literally came home from a 40h a week job and did another 40h moving shit, every single day. Its easy if your not an idiot or retarded but its arguably one of the most time consuming and alt requiring professions in eve period. I think the fact i had to spend like 5-6 h a day jumping and moving shit while having to use 20+ accounts negates its oh its risk free complaint.
---
I mean, true, but even then, 99% of the time the person I’m fighting has better/stronger stuff and/or is just better than me at PvP
---
Mach changes, Harbi buffs, Assault Frigate buffs, etc.
---
for every raitaru you kill two new will spawn
---
Not sure how it works in Iceland, but here in the states if you fire someone you're basically agreeing to pay half of their unemployment benefits for the next X number of years. No one can seriously think they are entitled to a severance, unless it is written in their employment contract. Most of the time to receive one you are just operating on good faith.
---
I think there  are a lot more if's than developers being miffed by the lack of bonuses being handed out on a contract they were never involved with.  But I agree, that is a possibility.  My thought here is if that was the case, it would only detract careerist types, or people who arent hungry, or worse, prema donna's. Which, leads to a good outcome for the players... since the next team that steps in will have to be highly competitive to take the job. To me, the worse scenario is if they do get the bonus, despite poor performance, that will lead those prema donna types suddenly being attracted to getting the contract, thinking it will be easy money... edit: oh and i forgot, the worst scenario of them all: CCP gets their contract renewed
---
Unfortunately they do exist, they just never get big enough to attract too much attention
---
Yeah. FW definitely feels like the way to lose all your PvP money. My current preferred fit that at least seemed to hit harder is a neut Tristan I got. Close range neuts and maybe a Blaster or two, and then drones
---
I've seen multiple (decent) suggestions to transition them into full support/fleet enabling ships. 
---
Thus weapon systems would be limited to maybe DD - which I feel on a cooldown is okay - and from then on it's boosting, bridging, and whatever CCP can cook up in terms of extreme utility (fleet assistance and mobility, new forms of ewar, specific effects against structures, etc).
---
I'm mainly interested in what kind of solution hits both the role of Titans and their survivability, though.
---
Making them die more frequently is a decision that I feel comes strictly from out-of-game issues. It's only wanted because there are a ton of Titans already built and they would be sitting idle. However.. 
---
Changing the ship's role to something that leads to a fleet needing only X (1-10 depending on size of fleet and buffs required) amount of Titans is OK, even if they aren't squishier/lost more often. Titan counts would take a while to dwindle but production also slows down and people transition to smaller hulls. I feel it's a fair tradeoff for the overall health of the game - to change the role of the ship into what it needs to be without taking into consideration "what are people gonna do with all these Titans?"
---
I know my perspective might be skewed because I don't own one, but right now they look imposing but not exciting. I'm sure lots of people would enjoy something that makes their ship more fun and engaging to fly.
---
I forget, are Abyssals the things where you get an item that basically “summons” the Abyssal, you warp into it, and then try to beat it before time is up?
---
Oh no, I go to Tama to try(and fail) at PvP
---
I just can’t make it past the instalock gatecamps tho lol
---
Then why dont you clarify it all for us mr bigshot csm lol
---
This doesn't look like something built by tribal savages.
---
this is perhaps the one guaranteed thing to happen, unless PA really just has their heads way up their ass
---
He is indeed Daedededs.
---
Legacy Coalition as a whole has way to much SOV. You could pack all of them into 1 region (excluding TEST) and it would not be crowded. But as long as the SOV system and Citadels stay the same nothing will change...
---
On top of that TEST/Legacy starting to take over FRAT space in Detorid is crazy... even more empty SOV yay!
---
Nope, isk were paid.
---
Why you mad yo
---
I'd rather have more people reporting possible bots than less. If there's someone out there spamming everybody in local as a bot, I suspect that will be easy to detect and deter.  But you can feel free to continue your usual negative response to everything.  Makes no difference to me.
---
money &gt; feelings
---
Who said that ?
---
Fact remains that CCP is still based in Iceland, and they do and will always suffer from a lack of talent pool. Even considering import personnel, I feel in the long run this will always be an issue.
---
About the legal stuff, I really don't have much experience so it's rather pointless for me to keep talking about it :) I just don't think there's any real "danger" for the employees. Senior management/shareholders/stakeholders etc., that would be another issue. They are likely more invested and directly affected
---
You'd think they'd want to stop this though because it cuts in on their action.
---
Yet another thread I can link to corpmates to make fun of a brainlet redditor.
---
You are def on the right track here. I'd love to see it expand into a notification in the client... :)
---
Maybe even a medal after x amount of valid reports on my character page that I can choose to view or not would be super cool too.
---
It seems we see some things differently.
---
Thank you for feedback.
---
It is the launcher that is giving me a black screen, not character login. I've deleted eve, the cache, everything, same issue.
---
It's just Dave-Stark.  He's a dick.  Always has been, always will be. You could give him free accounts for life and he'd bitch about it.  Make a change that helps only his gameplay?  He'll whine.
---
The learning curve is no concern for me, nor is the time sink required for the game...tbh, I'm mostly worried about constantly getting griefed by veterans. Other mmo's I've played have a major problem with that. I get pvp is a BIG part of eve, and I'm cool with that. I just don't want my progress in the game to be stunted because some of some douche camper
---
It was alright. My alliance mates that like to mine have told me they felt safer during blackout that they do with local, our krab space is very dead and rarely does anyone come through anyway.
---
PvP was good before people started to adapt to being aware of you sneaking up on their fleet , we got many early dunks on roaming fleets that weren't already running away or a click away from running when we populate local. 
---
The two things I enjoyed the most:
---
Solo / multiboxing stuff. Cloak and dagger style bait and gank of a ganker. He has no way of knowing how many alts you have on grid and very quickly becomes space dust. Smoked many T3C's this way.
---
Save friendly miners. This was a surprisingly fun pass time. Practising a theory I came up with, I was sitting a widow in a moon field on grid with anything from covvies to hulks, or orca and up. I never lost that widow yet, and tanked a small/medoum itkitsura gang presumably from wormhole space, relying entirely on my minnow and the cap shield xfer of two rorqs.. So there's that.
---
This never netted any kills because we had haw dreads on standby the entire time and I dropped 3 of my own with my fax... each time the gangs took off once Haws get on grid and my widow wouldn't turn to vapour...
---
Overall I liked it. It forced us to work together and develop brand new out of the box theories.  If only it didn't have such a negative effect on player numbers it could have been very fun. However as CCP normally does they went full retard with zero counter play. Clearly we found out local in null is necessary for the game to make it into 2020
---
&gt; your usual negative response to everything
---
I guess that dude was right about you.
---
We ignoring that OP (or whoever screenshot that) is admitting to RMTing as well?
---
&gt; reporting everyone that isn't blue.
---
FYI, the blues are often the easiest to report.  I've only suspected and reported one blue, and when we looked into it they regularly went on fleets.  Still reported it to CCP just in case.
---
Micro-nation. Nuff said.
---
Can you blame them with how much money botters help CCP realize?
---
ill give you a $50 buffalo wild wings card to break your nda
---
Pretty much everyone complaining about cyno changes and how much it hurts super capital escalations.
---
But those don't really happen anyway, compared to all the other rather broken uses of cynos.
---
Yeah, make it largely worthless outside of very specific niches like the other T3Cs!
---
This message brought to you by Nerf Fun foundation.
---
ok. let me know how that works out for you sugar
---
Yeah the LAUNCHER is the black screen, I don't even make it to account login.
---
Most of r/eve hasn't played most of the game, so they are quite happy when the parts they never played get nerfed because "at least something is changing!!"
---
I want basically ARMA: EVE edition. Think about it.
---
I get what you're saying, but here's another perspective. There are many games that have these notifications set up. They all work the same way.
---
All the business talk and indirect speech and what have you are there just to protect the company and to have everything according to procedure. Delete out all the chaff and you can read:
---
"Yo we banned a guy, thanks and keep em coming" 
---
The rest is there to insulate them from idiots or complaints from the people who got banned (the stuff about bans not being automated, and "we can't disclose" bit). It's written as well as it could be, and it's written that way because it's necessary and more convenient and safe for them. You should still take it as the bringer of good news that it is :)
---
Hmmm... can someone check to see if the building they are in is available for lease after next month?
---
As someone who has over 3000+ hours into RuneScape, I'm definitely use to the boring grind with no payoff in the short term.
---
That escalated quickly :D
---
Do you have a financial stake in the outcome?
---
What's your name in game?
---
Those words mean nothing to me :P
---
you can play directly without any problem but you need a VPN for most third party stuff
---
&gt;feedback you can do something with. which bot did you report that got banned? they don't tell you. so how do you know which of the accounts was actually a bot, and which was actually a player just acting odd? you don't. not even a location, or a time/date. at least then you'd have some kind of clue as to what was actually a bot so you don't end up submitting more false positives as you fumble around in the dark reporting everyone that isn't blue.
---
Most games dont even tell you this info, they just do ban waves.
---
&gt;you can't do anything with a generic copy and paste reply, other than file it in your spam folder. that's why you only get an out of office auto reply after the first email and not for the second onwards - because after that first email it's just spam.
---
What are you trying to expect? Do you want a handwritten letter sealed with CCP's kiss? This is just letting you know "hey we got your report, thanks for that". It's just a simple notification in a sense.
---
Emerging conduits are a new type of highsec combat site that's been around for a few weeks now. They're primarily battleship content but you can run them solo in a T2-fit Gila, (maybe a Drake would do better?) with a couple warp-outs to repair. Loot + salvage seems to be around 25mil per site. Easier than a minor conduit in an invasion system, and definitely soloable. Trigs come in waves as you destroy the last one. IIRC there's four waves, largest trig size is a cruiser (last wave) and there's just one cruiser per site, a couple destroyers, and a bunch of frigates.
---
Once they deploy back home, the ex-FRAT space will be easy pickings for non-strategically-important groups to pop in and grab.
---
Placement-&gt; Layering-&gt; Integration
---
You should run again so you can actually get ships deleted that were nerfed to hell. Because no one is ever going to use them now and CCP will never rebalance.
---
Yes, willing to invest my money into a blackhole if game improves. I just meant, if the building is up for lease, maybe they will be dropping CCP and relocating
---
For a new player, especially using an alpha account, I cannot recommend wormhole gas mining and/or exploration enough. 
---
You need to learn all of the really important basics to be good at it, and the return/cost is nutty. You can make 20-40 mil Isk per hour very easily by only flying 1-3 mil isk ships. You even start the game with the minimum required skills for exploration.
---
Or a hypothetical Minmatar/Caldari hybrid.
---
What are some of the changes that veterans are bothered by?
---
notice that most botting behavior comes from socialist or ex-socialist countries (russia, china, venezeula). its much less to do with culture, and more to do with shitty economic systems that encourages people to cheat.
---
Just for the record, a good deal of us line members was against allying PIBC.
---
I do PI on 3 characters. T0-T2, 5x planets on each. Reset daily before I log off. I have CCU and planets to IV. I haul stuff off to market about every 2-3 weeks.
---
So, I'm having a problem where I can see corp bookmarks in space, but not personal bookmarks. I also can't open the Sensor Overlay menu (tried hovering, left clicking, right clicking, nothing.)  
---
I've tried relogging, changing systems, docking/undocking. None of these have helped.
---
Is there a setting somewhere I might have clicked in the past to deactivate this or is it just a bug? If it's a bug, any idea on how I might get it back working again? I'd really like to be able to see my pings on a station...
---
\#metoo
---
Way I see it, either the game goes to shit in which case I get back some amount of money and time each month, or it doesn't and then yay! content.
---
At least we have some sort of a deadline to look forward to.
---
Maybe if you all hadn't bitched about JF jumping to covert cynos that would have like literally been risk free you wouldn't have this shit to deal with.
---
Another War and Little Red Riding Hole are both German C5 pve corporations
---
I'm not even seeing a transaction in the chat. The only hard evidence for that would be the english translation on the side. Or am I missing something? I don't get all the slang.
---
some guy said it on a phone client so it MUST be true.
---
Sounds awesome.  Yeah the baiting was really good by some people.  We fell victim to some really good baiting ships and the not knowing how many in local was super spooky. Even as a hunter, it made me always think twice before committing to a fight.
---
ISSUE RESOLVED! THANK YOU!
---
I had to delete that stupid registry entry, that was it.
---
@CCP - Why in the hell does 'uninstall' not remove your registry entries?!?!
---
oh i know its tedious and requires alts. progressively removing JF's would also remove this tedium, and being a logistician would involve more ingame skills (ie, setting up and leading a convoy, knowing your route well: where you are likely to get intercepted and how to avoid them etc).
---
at the end of the day, i think something like logistics offers up a range of possibilities from a gameplay and 'political' point of view but JF's remove all of it, and infact make the gameplay even worse - albeit slightly easier and less risky.
---
Rory Farrell why that's my character name
---
They usually track it for a bit too see the flow. Instead of just banning one person they can ban all those involved.
---
relevant to the RMT question, but not to this. it's literally two chinese alliances calling each other botters and rmt'ers. RMT isn't a chinese thing, but THIS is a chinese thing.
---
just lalka \^\^  
---
Bravo!
---
Honestly I have no issues with players just buying plex from CCP and using it to kickstart an empire. I'm more sore about CCP not spending that money reinvesting in Eve.
---
I wonder if this was some NC char
---
flair checks out.
---
Will you also consider an option to add a comment when reporting? I would like to give a reason for the report, otherwise it might be difficult to research context without knowing why a player was reported.
---
Patience is a bitter plant but it's fruit is sweet.
---
There's sov that's owned to live and farm in, and there's sov that's owned to stop PL from easily anchoring forts right on our doorstep.
---
Wowzer this is shocking. Who would have thought it.
---
If you looked through the minutes of the summits following that change you'd note we repeatedly asked for Combat ceptors to be given a distinct new role - My personal favourite being a dedicated anti-fighter ship. I didn't even want nullification to be removed, just made less oppressive on sub 2s warping ships, as you can see from the articles I published around that time.
---
Do you seriously want peoples' lives to be messed up over this?
---
The same my man. A healthy dose of experience-based fear never hurt anyone.
---
dont nerf the loki 
---
buff the other T3Cs instead
---
Who would have thought that bringing thousands of players from a culture that is built on scams and other shady shit just like this would bring this into Eve? 
---
WHO?!?!?
---
Nobody gives a vuk.
---
at what point will the salt mine you live in finally collapse and give you sweet release from your self constructed hellworld where a game company increases your risk of heart issues?
---
From the sounds of your post and the comments you've made, you're skilled mostly into Amarr ships and you want a destroyer for combat missions, right?  
---
I would suggest the Coercer for this purpose. The Dragoon uses drones, which are great, but the Gallente Algos is superior for PvE in this regard. Take a look at the example PvE fit for the Coercer here:  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Coercer](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Coercer)
---
Cant tell if youre gaslighting me or just mentally numb
---
literally just google PBIC eve online and you will find many many forum threads of people lamenting their control over the Serenity server/rampant botting/RMT.  Like the only reason i can see why you'd deny this is that youre trolling, or your head is so far up your own ass that your body is malnourished due to a steady diet of shit.
---
I don't think the sisters equipment is worth the cost for a newbie. T1 probe launcher and probes can happily scan down any site a newbie would be capable of tackling with level 3 scanning/hacking skills. This includes nullsec sites. The 30mil pricetag on the sisters probe launcher is just terrible price/performance. The probes aren't a bad deal, but that launcher is just never worth it.
---
It's not pointless to get into now but it can be a difficult game for sure. 
---
I used to say join one of the newbie alliances, but really, the best advice is just to make friends in this game. It's a very social game, and if you make friends with people who have more experience they will just  teach you things about the game in a very natural way that doesn't really seem like learning.
---
To do this, literally talk to everyone you interact with. Even people who blow up your ship. Talk to them. Seriously. But do be careful about scammers. There are bad actors in EVE. Use common sense. If something sounds to good to be true it probably is.
---
/r/evejobs 
---
Look in that sub.
---
They were talking about all cap escalations which this change does hurt. Normal cap escalations happen every day btw
---
Supercap escalations normaly only happen in big wars which are currently and will get more rare as long as mechanics are this discouraging for the attacking side.
---
&gt;compared to all the other rather broken uses of cynos.
---
If the changes had actually changed anything maybe people would have understood but since it didnt I can understand peoples complains.
---
Do it in a very natural way. Just as you do in real life. Start doing things on your own, and if you run into other people doing those things, then just message them or try talking to them in local chat and start up a conversation. Most people will be happy to talk to you.
---
Heck I've killed newbie explorers before and they would message me later asking how I found them or what they did wrong, and we've had a nice convo. Sometimes it leads somewhere, and sometimes it's just a one time convo, but even then you'll learn something new.
---
100m per week per toon. Could be as much as 1.2b a month per account. It definitely offsets the cost of a plex.
---
Can be done in anything abv 350 ehps rep power 
---
So even a carcal or vexor can do it
---
Thanks for doing this!
---
Did it change things or not change things?
---
Goonswarm will always oppose NCdot. Honorable third parties are a thing you know.
---
We're doing some of the same shit to Fraternity, and it's dirty.
---
I still think planting a citadel in hostile space should be much more difficult.  4 hours * system ADM anchor timer would be appropriate.  You can be sneaky, you can take the ihub, or you can stage from neutral space.  A nerf to cyno jammers at the same time would be appropriate.
---
Delete Astrahaus and Raitaru blueprints.  Allow ihubs to block planting of new athanors.  Require athanors to be planted on moons only and remove asset safety from athanors.
---
At least this introduces some risk/effort on the part of the campers.
---
Yeah, but requires being in mostly one place...
---
keep it up, this stuff helps us a lot too.
---
All snark aside, I don't know how you managed to deal with Hilmar and CCP devs. They're just so out of touch with their own game and won't devote manpower and time to actually balancing Eve for even the most obvious issues.
---
Where are you living that all of your toons aren't in the same constellation?
---
Just call in test to kill them, test has more Titans than PL nowadays.
---
What you were roaming in?  Out of curiosity...
---
As a new player it won't matter to you what it is. You seem like you have MMO experience, so I'm sure you understand when a game makes significant changes to some of its mechanics there will always be long time players who are used to the old ways who will be bitter about the change and complain and claim this game is shit now or is dying....... FYI people have been saying EVE is dying since I started playing this game like 6 years ago. So just ignore these bitter vets and play the game if you find it enjoyable.
---
Everytime you light a cyno it will just help him find you easier. To let you know he’s still watching over you in every way.
---
This is a great idea, and props to whoever started the initiative.  
---
One of the key factors with Bots and player interaction is the lack of player agency they feel in the situation.  'Punishment Council' type systems have been popping up all over the place in other multiplayer games to help this agency, and I think this is a great step towards stemming the negative emotions around bots.
---
test IS the krabification of eve. they will simply hide 5 regions deep into nullsec and blue anything around them that moves
---
Atom this looks like fake news Goons said the only people PVPing during black out were people in bombers and cloaky t3's, your killboard link says otherwise and considering the 10 threads a day they made I'm finding myself skeptical.
---
Sorry budrow, we are busy in detorid.  However, if you want while in eso, tackle something and see how that goes.
---
The issue is being talked about with CCP on praise Bob. They know about all the sound issues.
---
From my understanding they (CCP) are actually doing something smart, and are trying to marry project nova/dust 514's replacement with more Planetside elements. In effect, if CCP London's recent job postings are any indicator, CCP is trying to turn Project Nova into an honest to gods MMOFPS or 3rd person action shooter.
---
Which is great, if they succeed... it's just CCP has a long track record of blowing money on failed projects. So, while part of me wants me to see CCP succeed here, the other 2/3rds of me is pissed they aren't reinvesting in EVE.
---
PS. If you are reading this CCP, and you plan on building an actual MMO out of Project Nova that interfaces with TQ and the rest of EVE, you'd better put more work into PI and maybe expand the importance of planet control to make it more in-line with importance of moon control.
---
In other words, planets need to become something super valuable and worth fighting over, instead of being the thing you can shrug off if you lose and move someplace else with little effort.
---
Edit
---
Planets should have been like this in the first place, because it is dumb that moons are more important than colonized worlds. You can start by doing things like linking certain types of manufacturing to planets. Shipyards, for example, should need to be anchored on planets. Jump fuel should also be more expensive, and should involve combining ice with products mined from the atmospheres of gas giants--those are freebies.
---
Until you get proof of AOM botting on TQ, no one really cares. It's taken over a year of reports, screenshots, et al to get mass bans on FRT. Do the work or stop crying. (This convo is not proof).
---
Well it made moving and escalating alot harder while not really changing much about the "rather broken uses of cynos" as you called them. 
---
[Especially not for the players in the big and rich groups...](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004764/201909231000/)
---
ScyFI
---
Ah, my Gila wasn't minmaxed for the task (was fit for tanking Serpentis sites and had a big EM resist hole) so that could possibly be why I needed to warp out a few times.
---
Nothing to tackle but supers and rorqs, it was just me.
---
I have no idea what the terms of the deal are. They dont tell space elected volunteers the private details of major financial transactions.
---
Yeah. That deserved a fight in a reasonable number. Condolences.
---
Your entire screen is going black when you start the launcher? That sounds like a hardware or graphics driver issue TBH. The launcher is a windowed application so it doesn't do anything in fullscreen mode that could cause a black screen, but it can be set to use hardware acceleration for the browser environment. Maybe that's crashing your graphics driver?
---
If you feel comfortable using regedit, you can change HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CCP\EVE\LauncherEnableHardwareRendering to false to turn hardware rendering off, and see if that helps. You should close all running eve launchers beforehand. If turning off hardware rendering fixes the issue, I'd check your graphics drivers and make sure they're up to date and don't have any known issues.
---
If it doesn't fix the issue (or if you've already got hardware rendering turned off), my advice is still "file a support ticket". Our GM's get to see a lot of interesting things from a lot of differently configured computers, it's possible they've seen your issue before and know how to solve it.
---
Finally, small corps can have room to grow!
---
TBF I didn't speak with Hilmar at all - He was completely out of anything to do with EVE during the 3 years I spent in the CSM.
---
They removed the noise ahead of time when it's supposed to come with adjustments to WHs making control over access to WH systems less safe. 
---
Age of chaos and such
---
&gt;more reach than a gay orgy
---
Thanks man!
---
Ez fix, remove all titans from game, reimburse owners the mineral value and return the skill points associated with the titan to the unused sp pool, put the fittings in the nearest structure that they have access to.
---
ta da.
---
No for real, I'm new to eve, what does it means?
---
I have people in Korea, Amarr, the Bleak Lands and J-space.
---
And I'm moving more in J-space to be nomadic.
---
Until I can look through a cyno to see how it's positioned, I very rarely jump my JF to a cyno that isn't mine.
---
There's a series of screenshots on tieba(Chinese reddit) and OP seems to only posted one of them. In one later screenshot the seller was asked why he's not afraid of being banned with this huge amount of transaction, and the sellers basically says something like selling to AOM won't get banned, got confirmation with GM, they have some insider deal blah blah blah...
---
But again, this can all be just one guy got drunk and bullshitting.
---
A few reasons:
---
1) I don't have a ton of time, so doing a couple missions fills my desire for something to do in a space game.
---
2) Should I join a null/wormhole corp and then leave, I have a fall back method to make money if I were to leave, get kicked, corp falls apart. If I straight up join without the faction stuff, I have to do it anyway.
---
3) I don't want negative stats with other major factions as I like to keep my options open. I already did the "RP" grind/speed grind and don't want to do that again.
---
Tbf I never thought it would dramatically affect super drops. But everyone was 100% sure that all recons would be instablapped every time.
---
But it did fix some of the rather broken options, like ratters all fitting cynos.
---
I think it's more that you'll never be able to please anyone and the group that is displeased with the most recent change is 10x louder than the group that liked it.
---
Most of us are deployed up North in Detorid at QLPX. We do lots of small gang things there. It is a deserted wasteland of war decorated with wrecks and reinforcement timers, fun for the whole family! https://zkillboard.com/region/10000005/
---
Having fallen for that meme while I was KF, it is not cheaper. While a ship hull may have been cheaper the price difference doesn't matter when the module markups cause it to be more expensive than just importing the entire hull+fit. 
---
1DQ at least reliably had items though in my experience.
---
But why would you really need to keep those options open?
---
But generally, you can't get them all to go up without grinding with all of them.
---
To add to that, there's also plenty of Twitch/Youtube streamers who stream this game, and watching them and asking them questions is also very helpful, and allows you to see some higher end play that you might not otherwise even be aware exists unless you happen to be watching the streams.
---
Well, he's in the limelight now and just reading his Twitter feed is scary. No one trusts him and not many trust CCP anymore to do the right thing after the latest series of debacles.
---
No, this is absolutely true; however, I would argue the state apparatus does not actually give a fuck about how many people die, or what gets destroyed in a war outside of this: those things can add up to existential threats to the state. 
---
Meaning that, win or lose a modern symmetrical war between modern great powers, the damage caused to lives, infrastructure, and the economy can add up to conditions under which the state itself will cease to function. 
---
I would argue that EVE alliances *do* parallel this. Winning, losing, or even fighting a 'great war' in EVE can cause entire alliances to evaporate; and this motivates the actions of alliance leadership, which is itself impact by the material conditions that are the alliance version of a bureaucratic apparatus.
---
Lol, I knew this video was going to get the grr CCP treatment, but I appreciate the content regardless. o7
---
As someone who claims to have quit the game "years ago"...... why do you care?
---
It's not really a grind, it's more like, waiting, waiting something to happen but sometimes it doesn't... And "xp" is passive, you wait irl days
---
Steam a big shit. CCP a big shit. Pick your poison
---
that's your problem? not faster then light travel, instant relocation of your conscious or even the way a ship close to instantly slowes to 0 without trust. Max speed on ships?
---
There is almost no science in EVE, it's a game
---
Is this an automated process? 
---
I ask because if someone there has to press a button to do this, I'd be willing to bet that this will cease being a thing in no time at all.
---
are you just meme'ing? because you know this isn't true right?
---
Steam, cuz then u can see how much time you have wasted on it.
---
Over 3000hrs btw

and then do nothing with.  sov is pretty much worthless unless you have the super cap umbrella.  other than botting i guess, and there are plenty of other places to do that. 
---
small groups can't do shit with sov.
---
Blobbers complaining about blobblers
---
You were treated accordingly for what you were. A minor annoyance.
---
Darwinism is one of the oldest playmates of Horde. Helped lead to one of (if not the first) Horde dread fleet whelp. Good times.
---
everybody makes isk, you should join for fights, isk will come incidently.
---
Because not everyone want's to be part of a self-entitled clique of a fleet... They are soloable.
---
Collecting the most male exotic dancers, now my life is unfulfilled and I feel so empty.
---
Have you tried rolling in our(PanFam) space? Please do and post your findings.
---
But thats where the problem lies. Isk value and item prices have an inverse relationship. If things get cheaper you get more purchasing power, thats just how it works. You cant just ignore it and say that something that isnt bound by our actions should be the indicator.
---
Because thats precisely why it shouldnt be used as an indicator. If you wanna look at how faucets are affecting the game you cant look at the only thing that is controlled outside of the game, you have to look inside of it. And like I explained, PLEX price has shittons of reasons that isnt linked to faucets which makes it a really bad indicator.
---
If you wanna look at purchasing power you have to look at the CPI, not something 75% of the playerbase never interact with and is controlled by outside factors. 
---
Like this is the literal definition of what inflation is, general price increases as opposed to increases in specific goods. Now I dont now the english word for it but there is a specific term for when just 1 product goes up in price. And the experts always warn about confusing these because if you brake an economy because you mistakenly think you have inflation when its not...
---
Just forget about PLEX. It can be removed today and it wont really matter all that much. What will remain is the CPI and its telling us that faucets is not linked to inflation. And there are good reasons why this is so.

So all he has  to do in this case is make a 2 trillion order single mistake. Dropping a cup on a keyboard is able to do that.

&gt;Leave the citadels and participate in the game
---
Have you ever stopped and considered that maybe, just maybe, ratting and mining is how they play the game???? That they enjoy mining or ratting? Get off your 1337 pvp high horse and stop shitting on people who dont play the game the way you want them to.
---
Always get a fight there. Even prior to Cyno changess, you guys never dropped caps on our roaming party and would always contest in small gangs.
---
Compared to my last stroll through TEST space, the russians dropped a nyx, an apostle, a nag, a machariel, a broadsword, two ceptors, a bhaalgorn and a sabre on my lone curse in retaliation for killing an intel alt.
---
Great “fun”, avoided death for two hours until most left, still died to the nyx + fax + broadsword.
---
Is PL really as scary as you're making them out to be? Sure, they used to be at the top, but now, I'm not sure if they're really stronger than any of their allies besides Fraternity (botting and RMT can get you much, but they don't stop you from being bad at the game).
---
I read that they are trying to reboot that business from the toilet and its going to be significantly better moving forward. The bar is set pretty low so maybe.
---
why would hostile do a deal with you to bring in your JF that was my point, it was not about the cyno itself
---
Grinding structures uncontested isn't much of a content generator.
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
turning them into paperweights for most of their owners is a great way to retain them as players......
---
Personally Vegas is going to be the deciding point for me. If CCP can get out there and pitch what EVE's going to be in 2020 after a year of - to quote my interview with Falcon - "Development driven by the need to get data", and it's a good vision with well thought out plans, then I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. If it's not, well, at least I'll have FF 2020 to say goodbye to everyone.
---
so they couldn't have recently implemented the feature to message people as a way to curb player loss? we're close to October after all...
---
And here I'm sitting looking at the 200 mil I made today........ 😕
---
Its ok to Bot as long the isk flows thru TEST wallets but if someone else does it "FRAT" oh my they need to be evicted and destroyed cuz we hate botters.....
---
Ron stop using facts to argue.... this is the internet facts are not allowed only opinions from small test samples are legit arguments. /sarcasm off
---
Wait, Eve isn't a space farm sim?
---
No, they... actually believe this... in exactly that tone of voice...
---
The main issue imo is the cost of the cheapest citadels is just way too low, a simple farmers raitaru costs less than any of the faction battleships they typically use to defend it with, an astra only slightly more, the cheapest structure should still be a fairly significant investment for any player, the amount of man hours required to afford one vs the amount of man hours required to remove one are so incredibly out of balance that anyone can abuse it.
---
Move those people to high sec. Holy shit lol.
---
more like 40
---
They also don't seem to want to do any work.  So, there's that.
---
Depends on what tz and part of eso you go through defines what content you see.
---
15 for a super carrier maybe  
---
try closer to 30+ for a titan
---
There's 3 in GE- I think, you lose count with how many they have littered around our space.
---
Overwatch is that way ———&gt; 
---
you might find more pvp content there
---
There were actives. Everone just docked up. The ratting numbers were green.
---
Having less sov doesn't solve the issue of only having 10 people on avg online during autz which is where all of SF's timers are set. Sure you can get up to 30~ with prepings and goading everyone into coming but you can't do that for every timer because it's fucking boring.
---
Lol, I'm sure CCRee will say tons of shit at Vegas.  I'm also sure 99% of it will just be the normal Falcon/Hilmtard bullshit that never actually makes it into the game, or if it does, is implemented in such a hilariously retarded way that it just breaks everything.
---
Well they are  currently the ships that get popped first in any capital encounter. And thats pretty stupid but not game breaking for small to medium sized escalations.
---
When it comes to super escalations this could be a very big problem since it makes the initial jump in so risky especially for groups that are already outnumbered.
---
This could be very discouraging for future super battles but this has to be seen.
---
Yup. Popping out into PHorde space is great. Whenever I end up in panda land they'll literally bring multiple supers/carriers to a WH to push us away, and then roll us off.
---
What proof?
---
Yes but response fleet content. All the groups that love to hunt people in eso are busy doing leet pvp in frat space. Krabs dont like to pvp unless they have to. It's not why they play the game.
---
A app that just had industry recipes that could be engineered from the items I had in my assets. So you tie it to your api and then it tells you what you could build from items you have.
---
Neocom does this
---
Probably because all our PVP guys are three regions away at the moment. It's the last big push for the war in Detorid.
---
This is a terrible fucking argument that comes up way too much.  If you fail spectacularly at your job, then yes, you deserve the consequences.  Just because you're in the entertainment industry (a multi billion dollar industry, mind you) doesn't magically make you immune to the results of failing at your job.
---
Command ship is a long term train, they are very heavy skill dependent to get the T2 booster modules, the T2 command link implants, Command ships 5. Usually you see Minmatar command ships for shield fleets because of Shield + Skirmish links.
---
For PVP fits I'm thinking those and also Osprey Navy and Orthrus. Stuff that's popular with small gangs.
---
Missiles are less popular for large fleet due to the delay on the DPS, FCs would rather have instant DPS from lasers / rails / arty.
---
There's a few very notable exceptions though.
---
The first is Jackdaws. Jackdaw fleet have a lot of mobility and really good projection with light missiles. Another one is all the torp based stealthbomber doctrines like Stuka fleet and so on. Some groups also run Cerberus fleet as they have fantastic range. There's a few niche for booshing Raven cruise missile fleet where the ridiculously long range of Ravens is taken advantage of.
---
Thank you for making the infographic. Goons aren't blue, but you could make an argument that they are 'bluetral', and that's fair. We will never set any of you blue, no matter the outcome of any war we fight with you, and you know that. You are just labeling alliances within our coalition as blue. I think if you wanted to be fair, "The great blue event" when Fraternity's NIP was over was probably the biggest blue festival we have seen in awhlie.. or atleast since WWB.
---
No its true. The only time it really worked was when they released the new DLCs. It flooded the market with PLEX and MPTCs. It took the PLEX price a long time to recover from that. We could use one of those again honestly but iirc CCP said they overdid it and wont release another DLC like that for some time.
---
You need to get the sensor overlay menu open so you can enable personal bookmarks in space. Hover your mouse just above the capacitor and it'll appear. If you can't make that work contact CCP support. If you don't want to wait for them delete your old profile in the launcher, restart, and reconfigure everything from scratch.
---
If I remember right, CCP has the ability to flag people that abuse the bot reporting tool so that their report go straight to the bit bucket.
---
Its almost like vpns and vm's exist. Which is what the botters and rmt use already
---
eve scout have a very strong morale code with this, but sure, do your thing first.
---
I've always said that when Fraternity leaves Detorid.. if they went up there, that would be a hell of a fight.
---
I have an alt that can fly a Hyena. Your haw guns would apply great with webbing support. I'm online USTZ if you are down.
---
x30 planets of all the P2's for recursive computing modules (5 planets worth of each of the 6 P2's needed).  7 Day cycles, collect once a month or so.
---
x1 planet, maybe x2 for the P2&gt;P3&gt;P4
---
Use extra planets to either fill in gaps of shitty/difficult planets out of the x30.   Or, just do construction blocks with the extras.
---
My goal is to find one as I station spin while losing covetors on my alt cause I hate mining and can't be bothered to alt tab, all the while asking myself why I'm submitting myself to this. Then I realize it's to forget about all that existential dread business.

We did but then id exceeded it's mass trying to fit our egos through it

Are you sure that you're logging into the same account on the app, and through the launcher? (I know it seems like an obvious question)

This comment field just proves that /r/eve is the single worst gaming related subreddit
---
Just checking: You know CCP didn't make any money out of the sale, right? That it was already owned by other people, and they're the ones who sold it to PA?
---
(Yes, Hilmar was one of them, but a minority shareholder)
---
I'm unsure what you mean by "CCP's departure". Because CCP is a wholly owned subsidiary of PA now. 
---
Are you sure you're not just cramming words together until it comes somewhat close to passing a grammar checker?

Yea, I'll double check when I get home tonight but I'm pretty sure I am.  I'm worried it didnt save or something :(

I ended up just uninstalling, and using regedit to remove the CCP registry entries, then reinstalling. Ya'll really need to fix your uninstaller to remove these registry entries by default, the uninstaller should be handling this.

It wasn't my entire screen, just the launcher screen that was black and unresponsive.

For a force recon alt. If you want to be able to use your current account(s) as you did before, you now need an extra force recon alt

Yes you can and, there are a lot of options open to you and your friends.  As someone has mentioned, /evejobs is a good place to poke about.

Try not to get sucked into a group that will tell you how to play but, rather help you discover all that Eve has to offer.

Quite a bit. Do you? I build supers and Titans.

You may have also found a sleeper site, the wiki he linked you to has a list of what data and relic sites are safe over wise that is very useful. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_and_data_sites#Is_this_site_.22safe.22_to_warp_to.3F

Ok, my bad. Didn't know stealths bombers could still light cynos, that makes the extra alt I now need mildly cheaper.
---
Personally I don’t buy into narrative, but I can tell you from personal experience, the types of ops we’re running aren’t conducive of an eviction campaign. However since this is Reddit feel free to downvote this and believe what makes you feel better

---
Calling for people to lose their jobs or income over game balances you disagree with is a bit much. It's better to leave IRL stuff like this at the door.
---
It still has to be looked at though. More noise, not more signal.
---
With what you said I would have to guess you’ve never actually hunted prey or if you have it wasn’t anything large. It can take hours to find a target if you even find one. And when you do start shooting you don’t know whether you can beat them. It’s not about whether you can beat them it’s about whether you can stall or stop their cap friends. So even if they do ignore you in local, and dscan, and you get a drop on them and get them tackled now you have to worry about a falcon popping up and dropping supers on you. Are you seeing your false equivalency yet? So no it’s not two sided. It’s weighed heavily towards one side
---
Aside from the _fact_ that PI on 36 planets already excludes you from being sane... 
---
I run this very setup (well, I _only_ have 33 planets, cause scrub)
---
I live in LS and wanted my planets and PI alts close (they double as PI/cyno/R&amp;D/SP farm alts).
---
I do P0 -&gt; P1 -&gt; P2 on single planets. Two extractors, 6 basic facilities, 3 advanced, one launchpad. If I have a resource rich planet (fewer extractor heads needed) I would also have a storage facility.
---
The struggle is to find good planets as you need 18k/h of two raw resource types.
---
The nice thing about this setup is I don't need to move stuff often - P2 volumes lower. 
---
In LS 0.1 systems I still need to restart extractors daily but can be done from any location.
---
Every other week toon has to visit system in shuttle to transfer stuff to poco (10k m3 storages on launchpad, 35k m3 in poco). 
---
Every other month toon has to go with epital and clear out both poco and launcpad.
---
Worst thing is daily restart of extractors - find the best planets you possibly can.
---
&lt;3 :)
---
I'd just like to know what people can see or not. I have to keep my RMT operations secret you know..
---
It's Eve. Batphones are a given on any timer worth defending.

no of course not. if their lives get messed up because they didnt meet a production bonus, that's silly
---
Eyh my "while we're waiting for 64 bit client" post was shown :D 
---
CCP has literally been following my vision of eve for the past years, they got to the end of that list sometime this winter when the NPCs started doing shit (having them shoot structures was not part of my plan so that's when they officially ran out of ideas). The funny thing is I would've given them part two for free if they had asked me last winter. Now however, its worth money, and a lot of it, and if they don't ask I'll just sit on it until I can find another dev that can make the spiritual successor to Eve, using another intellectual property.
---
yesterday? yea

It was the assumption they’re just randomly generating emails about bot reports that I thought was tin foil. I’d believe that when they act on a case that it could email the user that submitted it.

Oh i can make a fully peer reviewed thesis on your “bluetral” standing and the mound of bullshit it represents but even I dont have the patience for that

You can't get a dread into / out of a C2.
---
I lived in a C2 (with C3 static:  J162700) for about 2 years.  When we left (to another C2 but with C4 static, then later to a C5 with C5 static), we self-destructed all our carriers, dreads, and my Rorqual.
---
It wasn't until we moved into (and out of) a C5 that we were able to move capitals.
---
I think I got over 700m in basic insurance for my Rorqual self-destruct, but that was years ago.
---
I like your name.
---
Don't fly a ship you cannot afford to lose
---
I already have, now I'm unfulfilled.
---
it's not a claim. it happened.  ghost training was the last straw for me, thats when i knew CCP didnt have a clue anymore. so imagine my surprise when they announce sale of the game.  yet almost a year later and still no details on that.  so i pass the question to you... why wouldnt i care?
---
&gt; you do realize that if you keep telling people to fuck off your sub every time they don't like shit there will eventually be no one left... however this is already happening with eve on a pretty solid basis, so don't worry you will soon have the entire server cluster all for yourself...
---
You don't see the irony in saying that after telling people to quit the game?
---
I've got no trouble with criticizing the game.  Go for it.  *That* would actually be useful.  Random "EVE is dead" declarations are useless.
---
Ok. Have a good day.
---
Why is this worthy of an email? Should make it an in-game notification instead.
---
The employees? Of course they didnt, but Hilmar, being the CEO, has a stake, and in order to whip his chimps into grinding out the next year, im sure he has promised some sort of share in this bonus (which may or may not exist???).  By CCP's departure, I mean, in the event PA does the only credible thing (in my eyes) and just liquidates CCP and starts from the ground up in a country that makes sense to develop a game. It can go either way in my experience, it probably hinges on some sort of final performance evaluation
---
ez fix to the game removal all ship part from frigs and reimburse the owners

Nope. They'll rescue you (eventually) if you've lost probes or w/e but you want Wingspan for finding you and BMs.

Do you deny this? Are those 1k goons that get called for timers that you alone outnumber FRT 2:1 really 3rd party entities?  And are you really gonna compare us reinforcing our worst timezone (that were out numbered 4:1 in alone, miniumum) with a few panfam sigs? Ur delusional
---
* Choose a p3 to make, make one world with 2 landing pads, 4 storage, 18 advanced factories.
---
* Per p3 factory world you need 4 p2 factory worlds (two of each type).  
---
* Per p2 factory world you need 3-4 p0 (depending on security and quality of planet) worlds for a total of 12-16 p0 worlds supporting one p3 factory.  
---
* Set for 4 days (or 7, your call).  
---
* Reset cycles every 4 days and do your pick-up and drop off every 7-8 days.  
---
* This nets something like 3024 a week. That's 1.2 billion per month at the extreme low end. If you do 2-3 day cycles, this can support two p3 worlds and double that.  
---
(I was running around 125 worlds at the height of it and that was netting around 9-10b a month on 4 day cycles)
---
Simple...I wouldn't do PI
---
One could also argue people looking for ratters or miners to kill should join code in high sec.
---
But there's plenty of em in null, and they never shut up, so I feel like telling people to move to high sec doesn't really work.
---
What you described is exactly alliance logistics was before JFs. It was an alliance wide combat fleet not just some poor guy with 20 alts jumping back n forth all day. Resupply runs were tons of fun, had to have a separate scout fleet checking all the gates with their own FC, etc.     
---
I know I'm an oldbro but the game was (imo) a lot more fun before JFs and Cyno's.
---
Mmmm salty BL tears.  Tasty
---
Yeah.
---
pre blackout there was a bunch of great cap/supercap changes that dont get enough love from the feedback. Maybe thats why they were more drastic changes with the cynochanges. Honestly i thought eve was going in a really good direction with all those cap changes. It was a slow string of patches going for over half a year and it didnt fix everything at once, r/eve doesnt have the attention span to praise these changes.
---
50$, buffalo wild wings, when you decide to change your mind. have your people call my people

---
Just took a fleet through a few WH yesterday (150 dudes) and sitting on the wh after jumping in I saw the ripples and heard the WBLWBLWBLWBLWBLWBLWBLWBLWBL for a solid 30 seconds.
---
to be fair I think some new gate connections would be great for the game. Cut down on travel times a bit, while still allowing you to waterboard supercapital fleets when they try to travel to big fights (the problem without space aids was that you couldn't really interdict or slow down the batphone reinforcements that crossed the galaxy to drop on every fight that took place). Also with the size of supercap fleets (meaning not everyone is on-the-ball-elite) I think lowsec groups and other small groups could make good content for themselves by hunting those who inevitably fall behind on those batphone supercap fleets if a few additional gates allowed batphoning to take place again but those fleets traveled via a few more long-distance gates.
---
&gt; GIVE ME CONTENT, I AM ENTITLED TO IT!

Was it “you” as in one or “you” a small gang?  
---
You’ve largely got your answer and when the stratops are pinged out most JC up to the front and stash the krab accounts until enough frat salt has been extracted.  
---
But a single red/neut banging gates not aggressing anything will most likely barely raise eyebrows.  ESP if it’s cyno ineligible.  Like one dude said, find a barge to tackle or something to fuck with and see what you get.  Might get an ass frig response or something.  It’s not delve so the risk of 30 Moloks dropping on you is definitely nil.
---
Odd.  I guess I missed those.
---
Most of the comments I read were positive about covert cynos.

Giving JF a cloak was a bit more controversial, but nobody really thought that would happen.
---
All my cyno alts can do Cov Ops &amp; Cov Ops cyno.  Working on recons now :-/  I'm past the point of training skills to get into ships on my mains (over 200m on lowest), so training alts for a year isn't an issue, but I know this isn't the same for everyone.  I don't do injectors.

---
dust514 was made by CCP Shanghai, CCP HQ disbanded CCP Shanghai ages ago, so rip.
---
The logic applies in general.  It's bad practice to not have any sort of control or oversight over the strategic space near you.  That was a big pita to us(legacy) during World War Ree: tenerifis kinda became a wild zone, some new alliances came in and then allied with Frat, and then suddenly PL and Skill U had stagings right on top of immensea and impass.
---
As for PL- it's important to treat entities like them seriously.  Eve has a lot of old, rich, bored high sp players who will swarm when there's blood in the water.  The fairly explosive growth of Skill U off the corpse of the old DRF is pretty recent examples of that.  All it takes is a favorable meta and talented fcs able to take advantage of it.
---
The problem with titan stockpiles is that you can now store infinite amounts of them inside a perfectly safe keepstar/soityo.
---
Previously you were limited to one in a CSAA, one in the cooker being built, then however many titan sitters you have. None of that matters anymore.  Removing docking capabilities from titans should be done asap imo.
---
Wormholes shouldn't have gate fire noises. They aren't gates :)
---
This should have happened when the same thing was applied to energy neutralizers. Its wild a FAX can rep the same amount on a frig as a super.
---
restarting didn't solve anything?
---
The Endurance is highly engagable. Lots of people just see "mining ship" and it's slippery so very rarely caught.
---
But it has a drone bay and tank bonus, so you can fit it like a Shield tristan and go to work on people overcommitting.
---
Pick any wormhole corp. Majority of C5s are just for PVE now anyways.
---
Welcome to Eve, where the players are their own worst enemy.
---
I disagree completely. Nostalgia is the current gaming trend and things like WOW classic show there is still a huge market for this. The problem is you have to actually fix the issues that are present and not assume its going to keep on running no problem indefinitely.
---
If you want help to find a hole from people who won’t try to turn your dread into scrap, maybe try signal cartel?
---
1) Say it is for "gudfites"  
---
2) Say it is for "Their own benefit"  
---
3) Say "we can't control our own line members in how they want to engage.... if they take sov, it just happens"  
---
4) Say "Well, we weren't getting the kind of fights we wanted, so now it is an eviction."  
---
5) Say "If you can't defend your space, you don't deserve to have it"  
---
Yeah, I think I can skip watching this remake from PanFam.  At least Hobbes and Shaw was fun.
---
My best tip is to not take it too seriously if you lose to a superior foe, and to not get bogged down in having "the best ship", a lot of fun can be had in a t1 destroyer and t1 frigate as well (even with bad meta modules). Just fit dozens of them and pvp all day long. 
---
PS: turn off auto-repeat and auto-reload on reps and cap boosters if you haven't. Move those to a spot where you can easily use a keyboard shortcut for them.
---
Presumably this comment comes from the cry baby why wouldn't play without perfect safe space to play in.

This. I had signal cartel leadership eve message me over a member having my heron on his KB after I fired on him. Killing your dread would probably result in them being kicked from SC.

If your going into Eso and not getting a fight your not trying hard enough.

We're bored, OK? We go whore on fights whenever we get the chance. How is this wrong?

Are you talking about something more than a year ago?

Funny how it's always the wormholers complaining that they never get "content" (read easy kills).

So why is BOT down in drones together with NC. and Horde? If I was allowed to krab down in their main space and also be covered by the umbrella I'd do so.

We've been there; and have sold back his Officier mods at least once!
---
Thanks guys I appreciate all your replies and have started my account and it's actually quite fun, even if it has soooooo much depth to it and the UI has far too many buttons that open so many windows at once haha
---
About your note this isn't a good excuse or just wrong. They used the Unreal 3 Engine for Dust 514 they could have or could still export an Xbox360 and PC version. 
---
The Unreal 3 Engine was not designed for the Ps3 as Epic was focused on Gears of War, doing the Ps3 version was huge pain in the ass. PC and Xbox360 were much easier to do using UE3.
---
I could take the entire UE3 project and convert to UE4 as a far as content goes in under 80 hours. Redoing all the game play code / scripting would take a bit of time but a small team could do this in a few months. I haven't converted UE3 script to UE4 BP's but they might even have a tool that does help in this process.
---
Now the UE3 engine was not free to use, the starting price was between 1.2 mil per project to 700k if you were doing more then one.
---
If you wanted to take the content and bring it into Unreal 4 and upscale it would look ok but weak compared to modern titles the content density has gone up 7x from Ps3 to Ps4. 
---
If you took that old content and sent it to a 3rd party art house to upscale the materials, models, and effects done by the same out source houses that work on COD, BF, and other large franchises would be around 2 million in development dollars which I am sure they already wasted on the Nova project.
---
All that being said they were right to kill Nova, from what I saw it looked like poor mod done by amateur developers and would have been better off just taking Dust514 and porting at least they would have a higher FPS and the same game play as a starting point.
---
Is this even an insult? Don't you guys eat dog anyway?
---
if it's EU or USTZ someone would usually fight that.  But ron is right most of our attention is focused heavily towards deteroid right now.  We maintain a minimum effort to protect ratters and miners and put everything else into the war effort.  Unironically, fly it into D-P where we stage and if someone notices you off the KS undock, you'll probably get a fight.  Just don't hang around too long or you'll get blobbed.  Give it just long enough to get noticed on intel, then sit 2-3 jumps out set up on a gate and you'll probably get a decent fight.

Seems like reports that lead to the arrest and capture of illegal bots should receive a Pacifier and Concord cred or something

The takeaway should be that the whole concept of making major changes just to shake things up with no understanding of the impact or regard for the consequences is a terrible business strategy.

If you think that's the case then you don't understand wormhole mechanics.

---
Platter.
---
Legitimately never. If you care about the tiny 5% strength bonus that much you might as well just train up and use the T2 launcher for 1/30 the price. That 5% bonus will save you a few seconds per site at most and only gives you enough scan strength to scan down sites you wouldn't otherwise be able to if you have lvl2 scan skills or poor frigate command skills, in which case just train up another level or two, it doesn't take long.
---
So... You calling us moronic westerners is OK? But heaven forbid someone says something funny about the Chinese, then it's racism left and right.
---
Go duck yourself, asshole.

Kitey nano bullshit has so much risk. You are right. I concede immediately. /s

AOM pretending they're not cancer. That's precious.

Wait, are you talking about CEOs in the USA?

...why?  the scyfi is a very fair ship.
---
That's a lot of $
---
Let's just purge both AOM and WC from the server and see if we have less bots when we are done, shall we? I'll wager solid money it goes down quite a bit!
---
Yep, my kitey nano SciFI that uses autocannons.

WC is worst and does it too so it's okay if we do it.

You keep repeating yourself with this outnumbered thing, but it wont make it true. The battlereports tell the tale of us being outnumbered on most days. Friday we were outnumbered with us doing a CTA and Imperium showing up to help. On most days the Imperium evens the field.

Okay here we go:

WC is cancer for botting.

AoM is cancer for taking more or less all of null. Wouldn't be surprised it they wanted to align themselves with someone to do that here ;)

Before you started spreading out, Catch had U-Q with TEST, and GE-8 with BRAVE, J-0DE7 with W4RP, and ZXIC with TIKLE, while we lived in 9KOE.  It curbed what we did quite a bit.  Every second day there was someone baiting us with cynos/caps/titanbridge.
---
This has dwindled further and further as Legacy got more and more space, until the only really inhabited system in Catch outside of SV5 during AUTZ is GE-8 with BRAVE.  And only some BRAVE because half your players and 90% of your caps live elsewhere.
---
You've spread out to the point where during AUTZ there's nobody left around to tell us to piss off with a slap on the wrist.
---
Legalize gay RMT
---
You're right. There should instead be these probes all ships launch signaling they're there since it's an unknown part of space.
---
It looked like the most generic free to play FPS with an eve theme. If CCP were serious they'd get rid of who ever thought up that turd but afaik the same lead designer is still working on nova
---
Well, Sansha holds the Traumark installation in [Saminer](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Saminer), maybe CCP could open up a new front in FW by having the Nation build a stargate in the system and start pouring vessels through to use it as a beachhead?
---
Everything about Ron screams fobbit it admin
---
For the last 6 years every major update CCP has made has been a disappointment and erosion of play styles. QOL stuff is good though
---
im not denying we do. Its part of war. Im just not accepting this as proof.
---
Try passive regen Sigils.  They get about 600 dps worth of shield, last I checked.
---
I also used one as a 'shuttle' when in nulsec, because of low fatigue on jump-bridges.  Was great for travelling to the market-hubs.
---
Seeding Industrials is a PITA.
---
You can fit a 'Standup Manufacturing Plant I' service module on any Upwell.  The lack of bonuses doesn't matter for building Industrials &amp; cynos.  You can offline or even unfit the service module to save on fuel when done.  It is 4,000 m^3 if you want to move it (read on).
---
Move materials by BLOPS bridging a Blockade Runner.  The Sigil takes about 692 m^3 in minerals at ME:0, and any BR can carry 8k m^3 or more (my T2 cargo-rigged and expanded Cranes have just over 10k m^3, which is big enough for a single cruiser hull).

---
locator service guarantees no torpedoes. afik.
---
I agree with this. The problem with supercapitals has always been their being balanced around being rare with cost used as an attempt to create that rarity. Time and again this has been shown to not work. The first step to fixing them is to acknowledge this fact and to stop trying to pretend that supercapital ships and supercapital pilots are somehow special and deserving of special treatment.
---
All ships in the game, including capitals and supercapitals. Should be balanced around the notion that they are available in unlimited quantity and that owning one is a goal for many players. It should be a reachable goal for anyone who is willing to work to get one. Only with this assumption in place can they be balanced into a place where their existence will not be a problem to the game as a whole.

Because you fucked up my pay for months after deployment.

You're right in that it doesn't seem to be Chinese in origin, but it also predates Colin Firth as well, going back probably to the 1200s and [documented in its modern form about 1519](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d8a7rr/official_response_from_aoms_fu1crum_on_wcs_recent/).  OK, yes, pedantic, but it's an interesting history, no?  
---
No?  
---
Ah well, just me then.
---
&gt; It had to have been cause I cant think of a single logical reason for this change
---
Because they want to make jump logistics harder, or at least more expensive, to encourage local markets.
---
Love it, but my phone just went crazy... If there is some kind of mass "actions taken" can you somehow summarize it in one mail? :D
---
Ok, I'll indulge you for a second. Blackout lasted 2 months, recently been lifted. People are poor and need to rat and mine.
---
Cyno changes meant supers are ratting, with supercap umbrella and also rorquals mining under the same...
---
Regular caps and BS are discouraged from ratting due to not being able to be saved effectively. Therefore, if you are roaming under an umbrella now, you'll be ignored unless you actually go and tackle a rorq or super and escalate into a fight.
---
tl;dr. bring more buddies and actually pick a fight, nobody is going to be feeding piecemeal into your little roam.

And nothing of value was lost

Many smaller null empires, and it being more difficult for the big ones to move blobs of assets around, would be a better state to be in.

there's no law that says anyone owes you a pension here, unless you work for the government. there are laws to enforce contracts though, say if a CEO decided not to honor an agreement. is that what you mean? or are you talking about the bailout of the mortgage industry? if that's what you meant, then yea we are plenty civilized over here in america as you can see

if all null leaders weren't spineless worthless traitorous scum they'd have never let any Chinese group get a foothold in null

thanks for letting Eve die the same death as everything else touched by china you fucking retards
---
It's over? Vni is a drone boat again? Cyno changes rolled back? Taxes lowered?
---
not like raiteru saves that much on production cost on a t1 indy.  main savings is in fuel usage which is still fairly low. i suggested just putting an industrial module on every keepstar and mid-point fortizar.
---
also i am sure some industrialist would move minerals and stock a few hundred haulers at each citadel with a market module for 5m each
---
the real pain is this makes heavy-m3 moves a lot more painful for the chain titan bridging if moving 10 or 20m m3

No doubt. I just lol'ed at the comment

Internet slap fight?
---
Titan proliferation has been accelerating the whole time.
---
Immediately after the dominion supercapital changes it became clear that supercapital fleets were the only answer to fleet warfare. The side that could dominate with titans and supercarriers would have a tremendous advantage in a fight. This was seen in the northern wars against NCdot, Raiden, etc where small numbers of tracking titans were able to annihilate entirely fleets of subcaps in relative safety.
---
Titan growth did slow down once both supercapital classes were nerfed to no longer murder subcaps. It still continued though as it was quite important to have more titans. This is the B-R era, the fight demonstrating quite clearly why even then supercapital dominance was everything.
---
Then with HAW and the new fighters, supercapitals vs subcaps were back only this time it was by design. A version of the AOE doomsday was brought back in the form of the boson. Again, winning a fight became about who could sling the most supercapitals around. The addition of fatigue in between the nerf and the return of supers killing subcaps also brought us the umbrella. No longer was a supercapital fleet across the galaxy a potential threat. Alliances with supercapital fleets could freely throw theirs around, confident that the dread bomb was the worst surprise risk they would face.
---
Tracking titans(and supercarriers killing subcaps) were a bad idea the first time, they were a bad idea the second time.
---
Wormhole pve sites  are another good thing, but you really need to be in a wh Corp with a c3 or c5 static in order to do it well. Gas huffing is another good source of income in wormholes
---
Noone cares
---
Wanna see numbers drop, turn supers into proverbial  paperweights. "Balancing" involves taking away the merits of the ship, making them useless for roles beyond massive and menacing untouchable fleets.
---
If I bought a Maclaren, and they forcibly took the car back, put the brakes for a dodge neon and a Honda civic motor into it, do you think I would be left with a nice feeling of value?
---
 It's a very dangerous line CCP walks with these super capitals but I can see the appeal of nerfing or "Balancing" them for the people who get hurt by them.
---
I love me some Chinese
---
Chinese culture doesn't show women a great deal of respect in the first place so this is pretty insightful.
---
Tell me more about your magnate experience with business strategy.
---
Did that for a long time. Then I got better.
---
Use a rapid heavy praxis. You can’t afk it, but it works better if you have t2 rapid heavies trained
---
The only way to get it out is to reprocess it and take the minerals and mods out. (No dread sized hole will ever appear in a C2.) If you don't have docking rights at a Fortizar or similar in system, there is no way that dread is going anywhere except Pend Insurance's scrapyard. So you might as well have some fun with it first.
---
You could wake up the inhabitants by reffing their structures :-)
---
I can smell the smoke from your attempt at putting together a thought.
---
Then set Nourvukaiken "avoid". Autopilot will plot you through Kedama or Sujarento gates which aren't camped as often. Entry gates are those that are often camped. Meaning highsec -&gt; lowsec gates or lowsec -&gt; nullsec gates. There are even few highsec -&gt; nullsec gates which are also heavily camped.

It was softened up by NSH and then killed by FeMalogoalotatim, hallowed be his name

Knowing you single handedly brought down a bot with your mad button mashing skills is its own reward.

You're reading things into my post that are not there.

Sorry, Colin Firth created it as he created all life on Earth. It's in the bible.

lmao. That's really funny. I've wondered about how that weirdness is effecting the modern corps.
---
hi
---
They'll be trained, but you wont be able to use them.
---
Not at all.. even if you got the 2t in plez its only 19k$ which might sound alot but its not alot to some poeple and thats all ccp care about.
---
The original cyno changes did not have industrial cynoes at all. They were going to just allow JF to jump to covert cynoes. But JF pilots with no brain started complaining about it, for mostly stupid reasons, and so CCP caved in and gave us industrial cynoes instead.
---
I don't see any irony there as someone who stopped playing after bashing my head against a wall, repeating the same stuff over and over. There is really no saving EvE, it's in a downward spiral and at most CCP can slow it down a little bit before it finally crashes...
---
https://youtu.be/_2U8W0iVapw?t=48
---
So tackle a Rorqual and see what kind of response you get.
---
The matter of fact is that PvE ships have collected at two extremes, the disposible and the unkillable. Disposiable ships like Myrms can't fight basically anything because they are ratting fit (they get soloed by bombers). Thus the logical thing to do is dock up with your ship that can't fight. On the other side you have Supers and Rorquals, which can't be threatened by one ship that can't fit a cyno/covert cyno so they ignore you.
---
Because you haven't played the game for years..... it's like still caring for your ex-girlfriend... at some point, you need to move on.
---
These nasotas are going to kill dunk someday.
---
Fair enough, but I meant it w/ no sarcasm.  If it was some orthrus nonsense, I can imagine people being like "It's not worth my time to chase that around" but an Scythe Fleet is totally legit.  I dig the hull choice.  Kitey?  Sure, but more interesting than an Orthrus fight any day.
---
you can keep any skills an alpha could train, even if they total more than 5m sp, but any that require omega will be locked as if you didn't train them until you go omega again.
---
Re: Killing drones.
---
Killing drones is only worth doing if the drones will kill you before you kill the drone ship owner **and** you will dps them down eventually while tanking if the drones were to be taken out of the equation.
---
Like when I fly a beam executioner and I take on a tristan, I usually have to kill the drones before I can dps down  the tristan. As if the tristan is not mwd'ing, I cannot hit them while mitigating the drone dps via going really fast.
---
If I fly a beam retribution however, I'd just dps down the tristan directly as I'd have enough tank to just take the drone dps.
---
The skills drop to alpha levels but you keep the skills up to where alpha cuts out. You retain a maximum of 20m SP I think it is if you are omega and drop to alpha. But it's all alpha skills spread all over.
---
Those QoL changes are like a bandaid after they chop the leg off... Soon there won't be any more body parts left to cut..
---
Nice work!
---
Weird how Legacy/AOM go full throttle on narrative as soon as some members of the Chinese WC mention RMTing and botting by AOM on Serenity. I have no doubt that both WC and AOM have partaken in both RMTing and botting. Legacy has been constantly pointing the finger at WC, but really should take a look at themselves.

*As much as you want to persuade people though, every image you have provided can be falsified with precision, including those that WC have provided. Screenshots are a false currency with no means to discern reality from fiction.*

And that's why labour movements exist, to force them to stay within reasonable bounds. But the USA suffers from regulatory capture (to a greater degree than other western countries) Politicians who should be representing their voters, represent big business, who pay for them to be re-elected. Who pay for the propaganda to demonize labour movements.

But then again, the USA is full of temporarily disadvantaged millionaires.

Enjoy your 2 weeks of holiday. I'll suffer through my 6.

Maybe they should introduce line of sight damage.  Make it so that your guns have to be with in line of sight in order to do damage to a target.  This would change game play completely. This may cause alot of lag and hog up sever resources though.
---
You are right. It isn't any different, but I felt it was worth pointing out.
---
And while you're at it, please enlighten us as what comparatively _miner_ changes would be more reasonable, in an effort to make the universe less pve centric?

You wouldn't want to be a part of a small alliance during the blackout? Yikes... No balls

Where's my taiwan homies at?

i had a great time.
---
my time in eve is spent 100% in pvping and setting pvp up. same for the ppl i fly with. we usually have 2-10 ppl in comms. NS with my mains out of tribute and WHs with my alts in HK. 5-20 in fleet. i used the same tools as before blackout to find content and extended them with blopsing which was okay content until targets realized adapting is to much hassle and stopped logging in. i still found content with standard roaming approches. targets entities were groups that can form up to 30-50 toons for fleets.
---
i also tried out more brawly fits and and got tons of fights that way making myself "catchable". this lead to me spending and loosing more shit but it was a lot of fun.
---
I also got the sore end of blackout when 50 AFs landed on me but meh the risk and uncertainty made it fun.
---
all in all i am rly sad it ended. sure the overall tcu numbers went down but i didnt felt that personally much.
---
Yes, they simply lock your Omega skills until you are Omega again.
---
Your comparing Eve to Wow...
---
Firstly the only people who are playing Wow Classic are those who have previously played Wow.
---
As for Nostalgia, well its over rated. What usually happens is the first 5 minutes are really fun, then it becomes a bit boring and then you realise it's actually quite shit and why you stopped playing in the first place.
---
Also Nostalgia is usually the older person remembering their youth, such as the classic 8 and 16 bit consoles, not a game which requires you to invest half of your bloody life lol
---
You gotta pay for that pvp somehow. Ccp wants people to buy plex to fund pvp.
---
I seen boting player doing a lot of pvp each day based on zkill, just like 12h later
---
The cognitive dissonance that you're showing blows my mind. I'm not talking about people fighting in ratting ships. I'm talking about the complete lack of ANY kind of response from the locals.
---
"Last night"? Come back during EUTZ/USTZ =)

Imagine thinking a wormholer brings anything not kitey, cloaky or both.
---
Acquired on Messenger
---
Yeah I think the level/number of fights we had actually went up.  From my perspective it was less of a "just dock up and wait until they our out of local" vs "lets ping, form and fight" because there was no way of knowing if we were really gone until they set out after us.
---
If the game's irreparably fucked, then why chastise me for driving people away?
---
&gt; you do realize that if you keep telling people to fuck off your sub every time they don't like shit there will eventually be no one left...
---
Agreed - just spitballing ways to make it more fun, since we're doing CCP's job for them as it is.
---
Instead of full blackout, make local tied to gatecloak... This would ba a reasonable compromise I'd think.
---
I am assuming you are saying "miner" as a play on words here?
---
blopsing and cloaky shit was to strong not gonna deny that. 
---
everything else was awesome
---
Would you honestly even care if anyone had genuine feedback on running a business anyway?
---
Someone needs to rat in order to make isk to buy said plex... C'mon
---
It's was like 5 EST
---
36? Im running 80 :|
---
Wrong answer, if they are in "alpha" skill range they stay active.     
---
You can use like 20-30mil SP when you revert to alpha status.
---
couple folks are saying they offline modules. If he docks at a freeport (if there was one) in his hole he wouldn't be able to leave without leaving the ship and wouldn't have the ability to reboard it until he omegas.
---
he's basically [this](https://youtu.be/f5d8pVg3Qtg?t=326)
---
for every person who deserves it there are about 10 who don't, in my experience. best not to bite your nose off to spite your face
---
I mean, it's worth pointing out that even when all of those groups were there, it still wasn't really feasible to grind through the 50-60 structures in SV5 because it required 2 weeks of full commitment to a fuckton of timers, making sure that nowhere were there NEW structures coming up, etc.
---
TEST even took the TCUs/IHUBs, but that doesn't actually do anything to curb structure spam because while the anchoring timers are *longer*, they still come out on shitty weekday TZs for 85% of the players in TEST/the coalition.
---
I get that its fun for you and now that I'm not in TEST I don't have any skin in the game, but Simple Farmers space is a microcosm of what's wrong with structures at the moment. At an absolute minimum low power structures should lose the ability to TZ tank (minimum 3 day timer, but it comes out ~the time it was shot), so that if you want to have 60 structures that are a massive bitch to kill, you have to fuel 60 structures, for which the costs would start to add up pretty quick.
---
Yeah, screw those guys for playing the game the way they wanna play it.
---
They are total bastards for not instantly catering to your every whim.
---
I just told you the answer to "why respond". You don't have a cyno so you can't threaten anything worthwhile. In delve we actively chase down bombers and recons, any other "solo ship" is generally free to run around until it blunders into a super and gets blapped. It's really hard to force an engagement on someone that doesn't want to engage so usually chasing roamers is a waste of time.
---
I saw industrial cynos coming as a direct result of 'cyno vigil' proponents.  Personally, I thought that excuse was lame.
---
Luckily can Blops bridge a BR and build on-the-spot.
---
so you think of eve as your gf? maybe you need to change your perspective, and you'll be able to have a casual discussion about the development of a video game without equating it to a relationship with a real life person

 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gaining\_faction\_standings\_fast](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gaining_faction_standings_fast) additionally you can pay somebody to run the missions with you in fleet for standing iirc. You get the storyline missions every 16 missions.

More like, "we tried the two easy things that involved someone turning some flags in the database on or off. Anything else we could try requires the allocation of dev time, but the Effort™ involved would be too much. Remember all those good devs we drove away through our culture, and underpaying them? All we are left with are these 60 guys working on art nobody will ever see, and of course any extra money we have needs to be sunk into a new mobile, VR, or unannounced MMO projects."
---
Try reducing the time and material costs for capital ships. Make them more accessible and not take 3 years to properly research a bpo? Maybe?? yeah????
---
wrong sub for these questions, run
---
Yeah, there's all kinds of things you would be able to do that would make battles a lot more interesting. 
---
But calculating all the LOS's would be a resource hog like Reaver4k mentions.

Lol, inb4 1 rag rips apart 80% of a subcap fleet with 1 arty volley

Amarr is dead. Trig is the new Amarr. After killing off Caldari and their ECM, now Amarr. Next up... will CCP simply neuter or create a new faction to make Minmatar or Gallente obsolete first????
---
This is exactly what I have been saying for months, Legacy sore excuse to go to war with WINCO was to stop them from botting when for months Legacy has been benefit from Kids with Guns botting empire in Omist, then alone comes AOM another botting empire but hey.....we need to fight WINCO cuz their botting ways are ruining the game....
---
They do exist, it's call any corp in a C5 with less then 10 members.
---
I think Hilmar actually believes a little too much in his own promo videos, especially a little video called "Butterfly Effect". Change one little thing and create a little ripple that gets stronger and stronger and.. CHAOS! Drifter invasions were something in that direction just without a bigger plan / follow up events  and badly implemented from a game-mechanics point of view. Blackout and cyno changes are simply bad lazy stuff. And now? Whats next? Have they given up completely? 
---
Will we get a roadmap? A producers letter? A "state of the game" blog post? Probably not cause CCP... sad :(
---
There are a *lot* of things about CCP that lead them to terrible business strategies, community management strategies, player retention strategies, etc. Being terrible at things seems to be CCP's *reason d'etre.*
---
I think I would be cool with like a region local chat only.  As for cloaky camping I think activating cloak should require heavy water. and no should should be able to carry enough to stay cloaked for more than 2 hours.
---
Empty systems no longer just retain sov. If people aren't actively fighting the pirate menace in that system sov drops and it becomes NPC space. No more static anoms, instead mini incursions that must actively be fought spawn instead. No citadel's or stations are accessible in these systems. You have to actively engage and form coordinated group PVE to gain isk.
---
&gt; something just to fuck with you.
---
Well that just HAS to be a Captain's Quarters, with a door that doesn't open.
---
Oh, wait ...
---
Obv titans need to be... 're-purposed'
---
The people 100% exist who are willing to fight during AUTZ, we can still form 30ish people and dreads on standby if needed at minimum but obviously then you don't form and leave us to bash undefended structures for a few hours and people just dont want to do that, people dont login during AUTZ because its unfun to be there with SF breathing down your neck the whole time however people are still able to login then.
---
I want to play Eve too, but that doesn't seem to be in the plans of PA
---
not time efficient at all but I saw a guy using a magnate to kite the rats wayyyy off the site then warp back and run the cans without killing the rats. keep in mind the isk from theses sites is in killing sleepers for blueloot, the actual relic/data loot tends to be less that a pirate site. However, if you want risky high reward sites look for ghost sites (superior in name, data sites) they have a timer before they blow up and do a lot of damage but can have billions in wormholes.
---
Yes, no, no, no
---
Put it in the megathread where we can ignore "solutions" easily

---
Yeah I've never understood why you can tether on structures you cant dock at
---
The Fedos shall rise....
---
relic, but you are probably making more isk running both than only running data because data will occasionally have massive payouts and you spend so much time looking for sites usually that you might as well run what you find. Also scanning data gives you a chance to find ghost sites.

yeet
---
it's more of having a stockpile, you can only fly one ship per character at a time. It can however be nice to be able to reship quickly, for example if you live 20 jumps from a trade hub, it might be nice to have a new ship ready to go rather than 20 jumps there 20 jumps back to get another.

Blaster rate of fire and tracking with artillery alpha strikes and range.

So it's still going and there was more than one idea. Interesting
---
Wrong answer.
---
we usually being told we're bad - and from a "flying sideways to keeping the transversal up" perspective we are, nonetheless we're pretty good at having fun and all the stuff the other guy said.
---
just a brief list of pvp ships I have used that rely on missile skills:  
---
used in nullsec doctrines:  
---
bombers
---
jackdaws
---
talwar
---
flycatcher
---
Personal use:
---
tengu
---
jackdaw
---
bomber
---
kestrel  
---
Basically, missiles are great in pvp because of a stupidly high alpha and bomber torps being awesome against the right target. They do have pretty high sp requirements for the best use, but you should have enough to get a lot out of them, you'd be better of using your isk to buy an injector instead of several extractors if you feel the *need* to have gunnery skills. Also I found I train hulls then train mods, because usually meta guns on a t2 hull works better than t2 guns on  a t1 hull. (albeit lest cost effective)
---
This man knows what’s up. This is very very slow compared to a Vindi.
---
And you are ?
---
Nice
---
the sad part is I don't know if this is a joke or not.
---
I always respect people willing to undock in ships like that
---
This is very reassuring as another said I hope they are logged and maybe give out an ingame award after so many reports. This would provide us players with an insentive to report the bots we see. Also a comment part to the report system would be amazing as we usually have a reason why we suspect a bot if we can't tell you why then what's the point in the report.
---
You can train up to 5m SP as Alpha (unlimited for Omega, I believe).  
---
If you trained more than 5m as Omega and went Alpha, you can only use up to 20m of your SPs (up to the Alpha caps).  
---
Check this link for the maximum level caps of each skill that alphas can use: (go down and click "Show" on the table).  
---

---
Thx.
---
oh yes right he asked "all the skills" -  bit inaccurate
---
Nah. The satisfaction of removing thrash from the game would be enough for me. No need to add an exploitable system on top of that. Besides we report to ourselves and to keep this game healthy. It's a responsibility that must be carried by all community and should not be rewarded with tradeable assets. I'm all up for medals though.
---
You're logistic ships would have to be in line of site as well.
---
If you want to include SV5 i think the number isn't countable.
---
Yes. Think of  a triangle. Dps, logi, enemy
---
After we used them to troll everyone out of the game, might as well remove them.
---
Another issue with this is everyone would switch to drones and missles to do damage.
---
Around what time ?
---
Don't worry.  I promise that's the exact opposite of what Hilmtard took away from this, he's probably brainstorming ideas on how to fuck up the game on the complete opposite spectrum of the chaos changes, as we speak.  "I musta just randomly changed the wrong things..."
---
Again, why should you be free to cyno into hostile territory? If you the logistics guy aren't on good terms or are operating for their enemies why should they want you in their space? This has nothing to do with the cyno.
---
Dude, your face :-D
---
Or just quit playing because more tediousness isn't what you seek in video games.
---
I ate 'em all.
---
Brings friends..  helps us purge our crab infestations..
---
One tactic would be to drop a bunch of close range ships onto the logistics ships behind the titan.  This might encourage actual tactics in battle in eve.
---
Don't forget failing to remake DUST for a 4th (5th?) time.
---
Your implants are being rejected
---
Darwinsim had nothing to do with it. The only reason they didn't get ejected from the game is because they never undocked.
---
NSH came in and obliterated everyone
---
Probably playing fun games they rediscovered after Hilmtard chased them off with terrible decisions.
---
He negelected to point out goons typically show up after panfam does....  what a weird coincidence
---
Oooo vily’s voice gives me a semi
---
If you just want to supercap rat, I guess. If you want to harass nearby large groups, having a bit of conveniently located sov is great fun.
---
Yes, that's what this game needs, more capital fleets
---
Sounds like you guys were doing it right. As a hunter, I gotta say, way more shit should have been bait. The safety of instant info goes both ways.
---
As far as "If you do this, then this will happen to you" Sure. Alliances can't really be run without guidelines and associated repercussions. 
---
Though, from what I've seen, everything that isn't a egregious offense is handled on a case by case basis.

Hey fun fact the VNI changes were announced weeks before Chaos Era, so my condolences about your defective brain
---
Cyno changes, yeah I guess, hard to see how they're "chaos" though, and the tax changes... whoopdee doo
---
or do any ratting or mining.  or industry or pi, or whatever you use sov for.  
---
if you want to harass large groups you are definitely better off living in a wormhole or in AUS.   or just dropping random structures in empty systems (which there are tons of).
---
There is a lot of truth to this and other comments...  while a lot of people will ignore a single ship not deemed a real threat, there are plenty who will dance.  That being said alot of our pvp clones are north snacking on Panda face fritters at the moment...
---
I can only speak for groups I have been in, but most corp judicial systems are just the CEO/Directors handing out punishments as they see fit.
---
For bigger orgs like the Imperium, they have more of a judicial system in place. It revolves around players reporting to their higher ups, using screenshots and what not to support their claim. Depending on the rule that is broken or how many times they've been warned/punished, the punishment could range from a warning to getting your super or rorqual blown up and kicked from the corp/alliance (i.e. commissaried). 
---
However I think most people who see the rule breakers usually try to reach out (at least I try to) and talk with the person. Ideally (and I think most often) it ends there.
---
So your picking and choosing your chaos...typical
---
Yeah like all he has to do is fly over to A1 or DP and just yell in local hes looking for a fair fight and he will get it, it actually happens a lot.
---
Nothing like triggering hypocrites.
---
&gt; Taxes lowered?
---
Taxes raised = Chaos?
---
Yes, We call it the F1 legal system.
---
Yeah, sov should mean something and making it harder to drop enemy structures seems like an obvious benefit.
---
I don't agree with deleting medium structures but they shouldn't be as full-functional as large ones.
---
or you train your cynos to fly recons?jesus you dont need 300 accounts just train up your freaking alts
---
Also a bit early for US .. east coast is just getting home from work/school..  dinner time  and all that...
---
Edit:  well weekday anyway...  no excuses for the weekend lol
---
It's really not hard to do any of that stuff, I promise.
---
On the fighting front, living in a WH doesn't allow you to know your neighbors and their trends nearly as well for hit and run blops work, and it's more of a headache or not viable to organize cap drops. Dropping content structures is excellent fun, though, you're definitely right about that.
---
Hed has chased off any shred of fc talent from the past. You're just fine if we come around.
---
Queue "re-purposed Mirae".
---
again i think you do not understand, Stealth bombers can light COVERT CYNOS that would be the original change of ccp for JF's instead of industrial cynos, so 1) you would be able to jump anywhere cause covert cynos  can be lit in jammed systems 2) you wouldnt need to use stations etc cause you could just jump mid space and initiate warp to your highsec gate 3) the covert cyno lasts 30sec so you could cycle down fast and cloak up
---
most of the screenshots here are absolute shit but this is pretty sweet ngl.

Try the Goons , Test and PH.

Thousands of players following specific rules in each of those alliances
---
Tying it it any reward is just asking for it to be gamed, absolutely don’t do this
---
at this point i don't really know the cap dropping meta or really care anymore to be honest.  With the new cyno changes are dread bombs still a thing or is it just bombers bombers bombers?
---
Also, i guess my point about sov is that there is plenty of room to drop structures in / base out of around legacy.  Having detroid become another wasteland is probably not going to help out.
---
Can't wait to experience a new Statu Quo Era !
---
Looks nice, looks Caldari
---
How can you POSSIBLY type that out and believe it to be true? Looking at character count alone Legacy/FIRE have over twice the amount of characters
---
please dont even bother cherry picking BRs. im not going to go through the effort of finding 3x as many brs as you post because we both know youre full of shit
---
Indy cynos weren't introduced to fix issues with cynos. The change that was meant to do that was making regular cynos fittable only to recons and blops. To alleviate what they said was unintentional pain to JF pilots, CCP proposed making it so JFs could jump to covert ops cynos. While this would have meant setting up cyno chains again using covops frigates or whatever and a big additional train on all cyno alts, it would have given JF pilots a big buff to safety (covops cynos cycle fast and aren't on the overview).
---
However, the backlash about the skill train was really intense and people also raised the fact that now most people couldn't participate easily in cyno vigil events like John Bellicose day. So CCP introduced the Industrial (aka Loot Pinata) cyno that could be fit to industrial ships and that JFs could jump to. (So that it's not quite a guaranteed loot pinata if you camp one, they also made it that blops could jump. So I guess you could bait with an indy cyno, jump blops in and escalate.). When they made that change they abandoned the idea that JFs would jump to covops cynos.
---
Anyway, I'm just going through the process of setting up my (small) cyno chains so I can understand the pain although really I should have gone through them all and seeded the stations with nereuses in the weeks leading up to the change.  
---
It's a bit of a shame they didn't have  a transition where Indy Cyno BPOs were available before the change making regular cynos fittable only to recons and blops. Then you could have just gone through and dropped off indy cynos and industrials to be ready for the change.  As it is you would need to do one jump to each station with a recon for a cyno or fly an indy cyno ship to each station which is obviously painful.
---
&gt;participation medals

For someone who’s not a boomer you sure do post like one

---
Aside from Texas law memes...
---
1) Alliances often negotiate "non-invasion pacts" (NIPs for short) that are structured like informal contracts, often with numerous clauses and provisions. 
---
2) Back in the heyday there used to be a player named Chribba who ran a guarantor corporation that held escrow to guarantee contracts and agreements.
---
3) Many alliances (which are comprised of player corporations and can have many tens of thousands of members) will have codified bylaws or a charter that lay out their internal rules / codes of conduct, with enforcement provisions.
---
4) CODE (a roleplaying pirate alliance) forcibly imposes their mining rules on players in an area of the game called high security space -- another comment has the link.
---
M8 what? Why would they willing stop using a strong mechanic even if the mechanic is bad for the game? They're the players not the designers
---
I see some one had good weekend
---
They did it, hell if I know.
---
Like how you chose the VNI rework to be part of "Chaos Era"?
---
Oh god, that Texas Law video is priceless. Also, I love the idea of e-bushido, Eve is such a great source for producing this kind of thing
---
Went live during didn't it.
---
Tether is meant to be a 1:1 replacement of large POS shields, is the reason basically. 
---
Even though that's now how it works out in practice because of bumping, the original concept behind tethering was rather different than what got launched.
---
You can use all the SP, but only in the alpha skills.
---
So you can have more than the 5m, but not a more in depth skill set.
---
Announced two weeks before but okay
---
Still funny that you're holding up a rework of a *single hull* as some great triumph of CCP's lol
---
Its 2 for 1 cat night
---
Cheers, this is super useful. It seems the internal laws/rules of corps is the most elaborate -  similar to smaller, individual kingdoms.
---
That is an interesting idea. New gates with dead space pockets in between them filled with dangerous NPCs. So you can get where you want to go, but you need to fight your way there. You can’t just fly a freighter through by itself.
---
Yup btw this character named Kano, and Kano from mortal kombat 11 drinks a lot of bier so now I'm getting what's going on
---
If you are counting NRDS then NBSI (Not Blue, Shoot It) likely counts as well.
---
Anecdote / myth wise that is connected to "Shoot Blues, tell Vile Rat".
---
I suspect every alliance has some degree of rules simply because people do dumb stuff, the people who fix it write down the answer to prevent others from doing the same dumb stuff. 
---
The differences are probably more about "We expect you to adhere to the spirit of the rules so we can get away with Don't be a Dick" to "Listen, Paragraph 5 of section three in Appendix C says I CAN shoot you for hoovering up Gneiss first on a Tuesday now that the belt has been up for an hour. TAKE THAT EARLY ALPHABET NAME!"
---
Larger groups likely have larger rule sets because they'll have had more creative edge cases. The kind of thing where the people who set rules will have heard what happened, blinked and stared at each other, gotten drunk, sobered up and made sure it doesn't happen again.
---
Haha now we talk
---
I do not disagree. 
---
There will be a cost to fix eve at this point, that's almost certain based on how things have gone so far, so at that point they need to ask themselves what they're willing to risk/sacrifice in order to ensure the future of the game. I'm not saying "do X" necessarily, but the longer this uncertain state goes on, the bigger the sacrifice they will have to make.
---
Right, and I guess the larger organisations have quite elaborate systems of reporting and enforcement?
---
&gt; Will we get a roadmap? A producers letter? A "state of the game" blog post? Probably not cause CCP... sad :(
---
No we likely won't. And that's literally the biggest issue with CCP right now, considering everyone and everything in game now is uncertain. No one can even plan. By all appearances, it's a rudderless ship. CCP really needs to fix the issue of messaging and communication to it's playerbase. But we've all said that for years; this time it just feels like there is no 'plan' for them to communicate to players at all.
---
Damn, I love how many lawyers play EVE
---
I'll demand Space Court, I know my rights!
---
No. There's always an armchair philosopher who wants to tell you how you should run your business; when they've never ran one.
---
Subscribed. I'd like to know more about the five "power" builds. If you have the time could you link fits here or to in-game character Dr Diamond? I leave a tip 😄
---
Sounds like you didn’t eve before JF were a thing. You gate your shit to HS and your alliance escorts it. Put some GD risk in this game. Enough with your risk adverse carebear cancerous gameplay! Git Gud!
---
Pleb
---
yea, it is just kinda funny that raising taxes is what amounts to CHAOS!!! nowdays.  
---
But given the political state of the world, i guess for some segments that is a huge deal.
---
I can't formally make any promises on behalf of the team, but this is in discussion.
---
Did i hear that right? Basically all devs are working on NPE? And Hilmar (with Falcon whispering in his ear "HTFU!") is entertaining the masses with his great ideas and strong leadership until the real devs can take over again?  Well, well, lets see what we get next....how about wormholes, they are due for a balance pass CHAOS-Era style!
---
"get me some Ugg boots and a pumpkin spice latte because I literally can not even"
---
XD
---
Then you can camp indy cynos knowing they will always be a JF.  Whereas at the moment there is at least the possibility of baiting people and jumping in blackops for an escalation.
---
Assuming that's why they made it so that blackops can jump to these (obviously noone but CCP know) then it follows that they can't be fit to a noob ship. Otherwise you could always escalate from any ship and we would be in the same position as pre cyno change except that you'd have to jump a blops in first to light the regular cyno.
---
Lmao. Got em
---
Yes ... and they also kill our Titans, https://zkillboard.com/kill/78593679/ .

As far as I have had contact with the GSF judicial system, its usually just screenshots and a forum mail to those in charge. If they have anything beyond this, I dont know
---
Didnt you just say you quit a few years ago?  Save your $50 and take "your people" to wild wings instead.  Seems like a better use of your time at this point
---
They definitely can be. There's a range, from some purely informal charters to highly elaborate codes of laws. The Imperium (led by Goonswarm Federation) and TEST Alliance likely have two of the most intricate ones, and they represent somewhere around 50,000 players between them.
---
Yeah, lifeblood was terrible and drove alot of good players away
---
How long are you playing ?
---
Good tips - who usually interprets/applies the law?
---
It is like : "how to lose 80% of players having specific end game ship"
---
What about renter agreement contracts? Would that be what you are looking for because those are often straight up legalese.
---
Good point, fuck everyone then...
---
That's interesting - I suppose it makes sense that the greater number of people following the rules, the greater number of situations, developing the legal system more.
---
It'll only get worse. It's caused by players and devs seeing changes to the game completely differently combined with the radio silence on why they would change that thing. 
---
This is what led to the iron curtain at blizzard, the devs couldn't accept that what they were putting into the game wasn't divine magnificence so they stopped talking to the community. Then they couldn't talk to the community because turns out they don't want to be peaceful after having shit rammed down their throat for years with no way to say 'we don't want that.'
---
&gt;  If you the logistics guy aren't on good terms or are operating for their enemies why should they want you in their space?  
---
thats my point, you said reach out and  arrange  a deal
---
Test posting best posting!
---
That sounds spot-on! Do the players draft the contracts, and who enforces them?
---
Most large nullsec alliances will have a series of policies/rules that you could call laws revolving around anything to do with players interacting with each other to prevent drama. It's usually pretty simple common sense stuff.
---
The ochre rule we have in delve comes to mind. Mine the ochre first or face the wrath of many titans.
---
I have.
---
You’re lazy
---
Wormhole bushido is an unwritten but well-known practice.  You'll come to learn which groups are honorable and willing to ship down to make a fight more fair/fun and which won't.
---
See, that's the EVE Online spirit we all know and loathe and/or love!
---
Usually a corp diplomat or someone in the alliance directorate. Typically their word is final.
---
Here is an example of rules imposed on members https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_University_Rules
---
It is basically "Don't be a dick" and "Don't engage these kind of targets or they may get angry at us".
---
Perfect, that's exactly the kind of thing I was thinking of. Is it mainly community enforcement and done by reputation?
---
Alliances and even small Corporations typically hold doctrines (armor, shield, logi, etc.).  Their recruits must train skills required to fly doctrine ships.  Whether or not any are willing to share with you, I'm not sure, and what the ramifications are for not skilling into doctrine fits would be up to each officer group or CEO.
---
the app? no it hasn't changed anything.
---
Why?
---
Brother, if you're gonna flex, do it right. "Raison d'être"
---
Becuase I want the all powerful shield pirate faction that will never happen.
---
Sure - really more like guidelines than hard rules
---
Gotcha - they'll be the in-game equivalent of low-level judges I guess
---
When exactly did you do this??   Remember, TEST is fighting a war and had a pretty exhausting weekend.
---
This feels like a bait post but after the cyno changes I can't be sure...
---
There's the stuff when you join e.g. questionnaires and providing account access so communication history etc can be checked - not sure if that counts.
---
Ya it's community enforcement. Where we are its in the form of screenshots of the violation to the people in charge of enforcing the rules. Whatever happens from there is up to the director in charge and their word/decision is final.
---
"lawyering" of the rules is generally frowned upon as well. The spirit of the rule is what's enforced not the specific wording.
---
Didnt Hilmar say he wanted to keep everybody guessing and uncertain what would come next and that it is part of the CHAOS-Era? Maybe he has good intentions, but it just feels like there is no plan, especially when "CHAOS"-changes happen month apart.
---
fuck fuck im dieing:))
---
yep, its something you'd just assume would exist in eve. it seems like such an obvious way to generate conflict and content... it might also have a lot of benefits to the overall health of nullsec etc. its truly a shame that JF's exist.
---
So why haven't they just ported it?
---
You guys cant even remove an astra from gehi in under 3 months
---
They haven't cancelled it they just had to go back to the drawing board again. I'm still foolishly holding out hope that they'll get it down and it will be a good game.

Clearly you need more sodium in your diet...

Huh, it's almost like a form of immigration. If EVE's players were more civic minded it could be a giant simulation of government - but then again there would be less spaceship fighting so probs pretty dull
---
I did this at scale and found that, realistically, trying to bother with head positioning, fast cycles etc is a big waste of time unless you’re really trying to minmax.
---
Better to find a good patch and plop down some 7 day cycles, P0-P2 only really works with max skills though so consider the time to ROI for the cost of the SP - it’s gonna take a while
---
One to many sour Simon's lol

Lol one of ur nerds was supposed to sell it to me but u cant get ur shit together !

Ha, as if. There's basically no commitment in setting up a C5 krabbing hole. I've seen folks use completely nomadic setups, just Nestors and an Orca.

No it's legit.  I just go back 2 days ago.  I 2as gone for the cyno changes and whatever blackout was.  About 2 years maybe a bit less.

Stealth bombers and trig ships online ftw
---
The spirit of the rule huh? Fascinating - that mirrors virtually all primeval legal systems. They usually involve a focus on the 'spirit of the law' (ie, the core rationale for what a rule is doing) rather than using precise legal analysis and hard, if not always common sense, lines. A classic example is the child who is told they can't have sweets before dinner - the 'core' of the rule would prevent the child eating cake, but examining it pedantically/literally would technically permit cake-eating. Of course, the probable difference here is that whereas the ancients simply lacked the legal tools, Eve players (understandably) don't want the game to become too rule-dominated.
---
The best bait doesn't look like bait all. I see your game, I'm staying cloaked.

Because Nova, TAPI wouldn't blue RMT'ers!

Yup pretty much.

trying to appeal the decision of the 'low-level judge' rarely ends well I may add.
---
Wut, caldari is dead? Personaly, I feel like ships like the Caracel, Cerb, Ferox and Raven (and the navy issue one) are very potent ships
---
Hilmar needs to stay as far away from community messaging as possible. He's terrible at it. No one even knows if the latest debacles mean 'cHaoS' is over or if there's more game-changing weird ideas to come. Uncertainty is bad for business, especially in gaming. Since the community management team was gutted, results speak for themselves.
---
Ahh, so in that case a closer relative in the real world legal system would probably be the sheriffs in Tudor England. Maintaining order but not necessarily being overly concerned with 'due process'.
---
i was always wondering what this ppl ,ratting 24/7, do with the isk?got my answer

They’re cloaked

There was a public one from someone in the north not to long ago that got posted here, might want to go searching for that. I found [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtDp1rKT54WFffnx3ejbpUDFfNXSYavUc4_D1ox0KqA/edit?usp=sharing) in the process of looking for that one, which was way way way legalese, I could barely understand it. Someone more in the know want to hook this guy up?
---
Weren't the original reddit posts in this vein from WC?  Hasn't Noraus been going "full throttle on narrative" for a while here?
---
Typically images are good, but we can always use ESI to gather information on things for other stuff.
---
If someone reports another for mining other ores in an "OCHRE FIRST" system (usually by images) Inspector Innominate or Whispering Wibles will fly on over to observe with cloaky eyes. If confirmed, the menacing miner will be told of the rules and how he violates them. He's now on the wall of "*you been caught once already motherfucke*r" so if he gets caught again he is met with the swift wings of death.
---
sounds pretty chill having to haul so infrequently. how much do you make accross all characters?
---
Legacy's excuse to go to war with WC was always because noraus is an asshat.  Botting has nothing to do with it.  If noraus wasn't leading WC I don't think Test would have cared all that much, FRT would have been a nice neighbor if noraus wasn't at the helm.
---
What's really funny, if you look at Zkill's history of that ship, it only shows 7 of them lost, while shooting down 1904. But it still lost the ISK battle, the 7 lost was worth 857.8b and the 1904 lost was only worth 136.5b.

Exactly, its along the lines of not wanting to spend your free time as an unpaid lawyer for nerds. All the people running alliances and enforcing these rules are volunteering and are here to have fun, not to hear the endless appeals of an insufferable weeb with delusions of grandeur manifested in a spaceship game.

Ah! That's perfect. It looks a bit like an international trading agreement, which in practice is probably not too far off from how it functions. And I suppose there's no way of using in game-features to achieve a similar result?

Often in severe enough incidents we'll be forced to results to cutting a players hands off, in real life. It's an ancient law that's rarely used but it has been strongly considered in recent history.

&gt;Legacy sore excuse to go to war with WINCO was to stop them from botting
---
No, it wasn't.
---
Fw has was steadily getting quieter of the last few years the big lowsec alliances killed of the smaller groups, then each other in the end it turned into a shadow of what it once was :( especially in au tz 
---
Not sure wether the cyno  and venture changes made any difference, after years of being a pirate in the fw space my Corp and I moved up to near lxq to get some fights out of horde, there’s been some good content up there
---
I drop by fw still from time to time(my last fw roam was 2 weeks into blackout) but find most of the characters in the  fw systems warp off when you hit the acceleration  gate as they are in it for the plexing and not the pvp  it’s sad time sorry for being so depressing
---
this doesn't apply to balancing tho, I'd love regular unpredicatable buffs and nerfs.
---
The alliance CEO or head diplomat. There are very few (no?) democracies in Eve, so most alliances are micromanaged by the CEO with limited help from directors/member corp CEOs. Trust is hard to come by in this game, and shared power often has tragic results -- worth googling "CO2 Judgement Day"
---
Ok cool, appreciate the input! Guess there IS a way back into eve!
---
Ah, a devastating punishment for keyboard users. I recommend the roman method of sewing them in a bag with a dog, cockerel, snake, monkey and then throwing them in a lake. Just explain to the cops it's part of a game...
---
Put the modules you will most definitely use straight away onto your F1-F4 hotkey slots.  
---
Use your hotkeys to approach, orbit, keep at range, etc.  
---
Right click your orbit/keep at range/ etc buttons on your selected-object screen to preset your ranges.  
---
Activate your prop mod and orbit something before a fight to see how far your prop mod affects your orbit. Sure, the other person's prop mod is going to affect your ability to orbit, but it would be a damn shame to orbit at 9km with a scram that reaches to 11km but your speed pushed your orbit past 11km a hair and it let the person go.

Ok, clear, so I'll have to do some research on interface and that agency window. Thanks!

There's usually not much "wiggle room" since the rules are written very black and white.

Woah what are you doing here!? Are you "GigX Wife"?

lying about CCP interactions is one of the few things that gets you instabanned.  I think plex buy receipts count for that just like GM interactions.

I played ED, then eve. Haven’t started up ED in ages, still love eve.
---
We have a corp tax of 7.5% on PI, and no other tax rate, so that plays, but I'd say 500m-800m/month? Kinda depends on how much rebalancing I need to do.
---
I just have redfrog or pushx haul it from highsec to Jita, which costs ~30m but saves me an hour.
---
A UE3 engine designed specifically for the PS3/Cell processor, I am not a software developer, but I highly doubt you could do what you are saying, and that "small team, few months" is a huge deal.
---
Sony, instead of porting games from PS3-PS4, or making some sort of emulator/compatibility layer, developed and entire "PS3s in a server rack" game streaming infrastructure to get around the problem and get more cash out of the existing catalog.
---
Besides, Dust would be an ancient feeling game at this point, they need to make a new game, lucky for everyone PCs and consoles share more than ever, so cross platform should be a goal from the start.
---
if you have any evidence that someone in TEST/Legacy is botting or participating in RMT please forward that to me.  If not, I think my record speaks for itself (in neither our alliance, nor our rental alliance making the list of top alliances banned for botting/rmt that ccp released)
---
Sorry, "Second Galaxy".
---
You should see somebody about your PTSD
---
His plan was to make changes that have maximum effect with the minimum possible dev time. Hence the "chaos shit every 2 weeks" talk. 
---
Turns out the game design problems that have been left to rot for 3 years are going to take actual work to fix.
---
So essentially nothing changed but how much effort it takes to get a fight ready?

Hunters still run away at the sign of defense, hiding under the guise of pvp.

&gt;CO2 Judgement Day
---
Ooof, that's brutal - I love how the meta-game even crossed into a real-life meal over drinks. I see your point - it would be hard for a democracy to form, especially given the playerbase's commitment to the grimdark theme
---
can you put all suggestion threads on hold until the chosen day? then just open the sewer and release them you know what i'm sayin
---
I'm pretty sure they're both cancerous RMT and botting operations. The pot and kettle are both at it but both are, in fact, black on this occasion.
---
Glad to see that they're doing this now. This was one of my recommendations last year to help the community recognize that their botting reports aren't just going into a shredder.
---
All praise the Colin Firth.
---
Are you sure we weren't saying that they are already rare, and hard to get, and that making them more rare and difficult to get was a bad idea?
---
I think you were hearing what you wanted to hear again.
---
Built from scratch going from PS3 UE3, to x86 UE3/4, the PS3 had a unique architecture and the version of UE3 it used was rolled just for it.
---
I looked up some stuff about porting from the PS3, a lot of assets can come over, but a lot of things break.
---
The highest thing here are those cheekbones
---
Ah yes, 10 year old concept art of a feature that got released and is now binned.
---
Like the others have mentioned, take the long way in.
---
If you're feeling spicy take the long way in with a cloaky/mwd hauler filled with a few of your pvp ships and setup a shop in one of the surrounding local stations with a clonebay.
---
Or mines. That's a great idea. Proximity detonation for all missles.
---
No... I swear...
---
I think the takeaway from your post is that you're an idiot.  Without drastic changes the game is fucked, but nobody is willing to accept changes to "their play style", so numbers will continue to fade as people fuck off out of boredom from the abysmal state of the game.
---
You should take a serious look at how you did permanent damage to this game.
---
What they likely didn't tell you is that you've got to find a corperation/alliance within FW to show you the ropes and help get you setup in the farming circle.  
---
Without someone to help answer your questions and point you in the right direction, all you'll end up doing is bitting off more fight than you can chew in ships you can't afford to lose.
---
I didn't even get that far, I really just wanted to see the look and feel, I flew around, missions where even more repetitive, looked really great on my iphone 10, really liked the take on the UI, CCP should take some of that to the main game, I still get caught in "to many windows open hell".
---
It's worth mentioning the TEST system, since I'm most familiar with that. 
---
We have a head diplo, Dran Arcana, who runs the Diplo Corps with the help of diplomats from our member corporations. Together they interpret and enforce our bylaws; Dran has final say but most actual findings are made by the corp diplos, since there can be a lot of drama in an alliance this big. The Diplos run a Discord "office" where people can check in with questions/complaints/appeals. 
---
We also have two sections in our forums that play minor roles -- an "Ask A Director" area to provide a mechanism for direct feedback and the mostly joking "Kangaroo Court" where members can "sue" each other (almost always over stupid shit, can't think of any serious uses in my time).
---
You'll not take my hands today!
---
I mean TEST isn't scared of some random wormholer, why should they bother wasting energy on you when you pose zero threat? As you said, Supers and Rorqs, none of which are something you can engage, so it's as if you aren't even there.
---
All these AT ship losses recently and barely any of them seem to know about module placement...
---
Honestly, most of the bigger alliances dont grief newer players. I've never witnessed pandemic horde do it unless someone is being a complete tard. Most people want this game to survive. However, it wont survive without the player base being refreshed with new talent consistantly. 
---
Good luck in your endeavours.
---
I would add that the rules in large alliances tend to be written and enforced in what may appear to be extreme black and white.  
---
That simplicity though is necessary in a situation where there is very little available investigative techniques and the ones that are available are themselves without nuance. Coupled with the fact that there are very few people willing or trusted to enforce the rule of law, and far fewer willing to go through a "trial" in a game internet spaceships.  
---
The trusted part is important as well as there are no built in repercussions for in game actions or recourse after the fact. CCP will be hands off in any purely in game situation. Corp theft for example, you can prove easily that player x style y assets from you.  But there is no recovery method for those assets,  neither in theory nor in practice.

Corporations usually have a set of recruiters assigned to handle incoming applications and do character background checks, in order to weed out spy's, or other dodgy behaviour.

It's unclear.

What is clear is that the status quo isnt good, so sacrificing a tiny minority of engagements for the larger health of the game is generally a good decision.
---
don't forget all the Living Breathing Fuel Block fun!
---
The real life crossover is unique for this game, there's a year's old meme about "all planned at the barbeque" relating to the conspiracy to topple Band of Brothers, who used to be the most powerful empire in the game. Before my time but Andrew Groen goes into some of that in his book/podcast, Empires of Eve.
---
The faucet doesn't just affect liquid ISK. That's what you're missing is that the faucet affects everything in game. Your Drake costs about 40 million ISK. Maybe 5 years ago they were 50. So your ISK seems "stronger." What you are missing is that everyone has more ISK and more Drakes then they've ever had before. They all have less value. It's not a big deal to lose 40 mil or a Drake. Overall wealth in the game has made it so that stuff in game just has less value. Lose a T3? Who cares? Faucets gush. The reason you aren't seeing this is because both ISK and Drake are in the same closed circuit loop. PLEX is the only item outside of that.
---
Avoiding mission against the other empires is really all you need to do to avoid a dangerous drop in standings.  If you are at a mission hub with 3-4 agents, you're golden.  
---
Make sure the cpc corp has a good LP store and level 4 mission hubs so the grind is worth it.

Yeah the cyno vigil excuse was like a slap in the face of all intelligent people like you and me. Clearly if they can make a new module called industrial cyno and make it fittable only to some ships, they could have made another module and call it CYNO VIGIL MODULE, fittable to any ship and solved that problem without much of a fuss.
---
No the change was clearly in response to the complaints people had over jumping JFs to covert cynoes.

In the corp I'm in, I asked if we could have an article for trial by combat, it hasn't really gotten anywhere.

They were slated to release some early looks at one of the player conferences last year, but the game was such a pile of shit and the focus group it was shown too was so negative in their responses that they announced instead that they were basically starting over. The cancellation will probably be announced some time in the next 6-12 months assuming they don't just give up and try to act like it never happened in the first place.
---
I love it. We now have banmail
---
The region of Providence has for most of the game's existence been controlled by a group that operates with a system called NRDS which stands for "not red don't shoot". This means that as long as a player has not aggressed them the members of Provibloc will not attack them. There are a lot of unusual implications to the system compared to the way alliances operate in most of eve.
---
Well what else was he supposed to hold up? The graph that shows 30% of the player base just picked up their ball and fucked off to avoid "Chaos"?
---
ascendancies (faster warps) and an alt that can fly recon with cyno

I mean you should have heard the market hawks crying on the forum the week it was announced. It was brutal man.
---
If EVE is on its death ride, the least the devs can do is let us have fun with our toys before the servers are turned off.
---
If a JF jumps to anywhere it can't instadock it deserves to die
---
I ran it through my translator program, it spit out only this:
---
NO U
---
not all. pvpers are still looking for pvp, and we only run when the fight no longer seams like we have any chance to get kills.  We run when they form a 200 man cerb fleet. But if it's an appropriate response matching our own fleet size, everyone I fly with wants to take the fight.  (see the munins vs our Kikis.)
---
yeah If i was a null carebear I would be setting up traps left and right.  Have everyone in corp fly a VNI to get the ADMs super high and then start bubble camping all the gates or cloaky ishtar sentry boats with a rapier.

---
Put the kool aid down
---
Although these days I find wormhole bushido being some bigger group ganging up on a much smaller group and then sending an apology email.
---
The thing is, while baiting is nice sometimes, it eats hard into your ticks. Especially with the cheaper subcap ratters, you essentially need to already be on grid, or you won't get there in time to kill the T3C/small blops gang/whatever. So you need to have an alt watching grid for every subcap ratter. You also need to be paying attention the whole time, or odds are you will miss the 10-second window you have to catch what's dropping on you.
---
When you're already only making 40-50m/hour per subcap ratting account, are you going to be willing to cut that down to 25m/hour per account and pay far more attention to the subcap ratting ships just to hopefully catch a hunter that may or may not be there? Unlike a super, you're not dedicating a second account to preserve an income of 270m/hr. Instead it's just 40-50.
---
Most of the time.... no. So nobody subcap rats at all.
---
If subcap ratting was actually valuable to do, then people would be fine with having to dedicate accounts and attention to ensuring the safety of the subcap ratters. But since it isn't... there's no reason to make yourself an easy target when you can go make double or triple that isk/hr in highsec in perfect safety. 
---
While sure it looks like when you're active the opportunity to bait *you* seems valuable, that needs to be balanced with hours and hours wasted baiting no one at all, because without local you have no idea when there's even someone to bait.
---
The only Omega skills you can “use” are for jump clones and implants. You can install all your clones while omega and still use them, and you can install IV and V implants while omega and still use them. You can’t install *while* alpha though. 
---
I guess you could also fly a freighter around while alpha, but you’d never ever be able to dock anywhere.
---
Orthrus can get fucked by a pair of assault frigates. It's not as dangerous as it once was. In fact, kiting in general took a well deserved nerf when they introduced the ADC modules. Previously it was hard to be fast and durable enough to maintain tackle on high application kiting ships but now AFs can reliably dive in with the expectation they can hold a target until their gang arrives.
---
&gt; We did a fleet op to escort freighters into hs to sell and restock.
---
Did a fleet-op to move 4 freighters of PI across 2 blue regions via gates and bridges.  Had a forward and rear scout.
---
The first trip went well.  The second, not so much.
---
I was scouting ahead, and told everyone to dock-up (blue space), but 3/4 were impatient and took the next gate and never had time to recover.  Only my freighter survived.
---
We figured we broke-even after losses.
---
Was fun.  Would do it again.
---
Freighters are disposable in nulsec.  Their cargo isn't.
---
Have fun honestly. It’s a game. My goal is just to get to a point where I can fund my pvp as bling as I want it to be, if I had to put a definite ship goal it would probably own a vehement or caiman, possibly an AT ship
---
No, he knows how to spell...
---
At this point the game has encouraged low-risk krabbing and cap proliferation for so long that any healthy change to the game would invariably cause an initial mass exodus of low-risk krabs
---
Noob stupid questions: 
---
Will trigs pod you? I'm thinking of fighting them, but I'm afraid of getting podded.
---
What's the point of frigates for pvp? Yeah they are light and fast... but webs will just slow you down and you'll be blown apart in moments. 
---
How about destroyers? I read they are meant for anti-frigate stuff....see the above point.
---
I'm hyper interested in flying a dreadnought. The idea of attaching turrets the size of small towns and decimating structures brings a smile to my face. Are they actually useful in the long game or are they kinda dumb?
---
We're so blessed we have a neutral and unbiased interpreter for this highly politically charged topic. Thank you Ronald for your constant pursuit of the truth, and your drive to share it with the rest of /r/Eve

95% of my fights operate around objectives these days... so nothing really changed there. Same content, just need to be a little more watchful when scouting fleets. 
---
I spent a lot of time trying to bait out Black Ops and shit. Honestly, the cut in ticks for subcap ratting required to make baiting viable meant that subcap ratting became way less viable as an income source for me. I cut down on it quite a bit, and I imagine that many folks in similar positions without the alts and capabilities I had at my disposal stopped altogether.
---

---
Negative and foul.  You’re a special one
---
Will you guys also manage to add the name of the player that has been removed
---
I disagree, multiple people lumped into the "krab" crowd seemed fine with the idea of local being actually delayed and not just removed, but instead of making that change they went with the nuclear option. Lots of people in the "krab" crowd would have been fine with some changes to citadels that make them less cancer to remove and yet CCP couldn't be bothered to make that change. There are plenty of things they could do that would have wide appeal and be good for the game, they instead picked the most polarizing thing they could find to start with.
---
They have only made one change in the cHaOs ErA which was cynos, I wouldnt expect much else.
---
I am not against changes, even drastic ones. I am only against changes which are intentionally ignoring the impact or consequences of the change.
---
I would say the same to you, as you seem to be perfectly happy with CCP going out of business if it makes your personal gameplay more fun at the expense of everyone else whose existence in the game you deem invalid.
---
There's an age element in there too. Like many things in life this goes in cycles. 
---
You add rules when something new pops up. At some point the rules either get turned in to an encyclopedia and you hire lawyers or you simplify things again by rationalizing the whole thing.
---
Everyone went to null.  Everything else is dead.
---
I continue to be amazed at your ability to make every post on r/eve about you.  It’s gone from annoying, to sad, to stunning.  Did you personally plug in the servers on day one as well?
---
Yep. We need more crazy changes not less. And we all know null is currently an isk printing multi boxing krab heaven and it needs to be completely shattered.    
---
The sad thing is rolling the game back to about 2010 (not including the beautiful new graphics) would be a massive improvement.     
---
The fact that the nullsec blackout had most people out there TOO AFRAID TO UNDOCK is abysmally pathetic.
---
Sounds like he didn't think he'd get found out. And it probably wasn't about the money as much as being able to get more at a lower price. 
---
I get CCP allowing him to buy his way back in if that 100k had an impact on it. They are running a company after all and if he wants to do right by them and buy it the correct way, then that should count for some kind of reformation.  As for leniency for other violations, that should be a lot  harsher.
---
No, but I plugged your mom.
---
As an aside, hey, check out Point #3.3 on my list here.  How amazing is that?

This is one instance it works really well.
---
How about to let CSM fixing the game for 1 year,then you can fuck it up again few times :P
---
Don't get me wrong, when I say "krab" I mean people that treat eve like a traditional MMO and just rat/mine nonstop to watch their wallet go up so they can buy into the "endgame content" of Eve. I.e. CCP's target demographic.
---
That said, I agree that blackout on its own was a shortsighted change and hoped it'd get iterated on.
---
lmao. can confirm, was there for the ddos. in fact, all 8 hours of that stratop. didn't stop us from shitting on pandafam tho. proof that old school chat still works, even in heavy tidi.

*Winter 2011-2012
---
Peak Eve imo
---
I think you pretty much summed it up in your second sentence. It eats into their ticks and so they don't want to try it. 
---
The thing is, if they didnt lose so god damn always they wouldn't need those ticks to be quite so high. The greed or at least inefficiency that causes them to operate as if they are in some wallet simulator is a far bigger problem than losing ships here and there. Hitting back once in a while actually slows visitors to your area and the opposite is true also, look at the permanent feeding frenzy surrounding the big new player alliances like Brave newbies. Roaming gangs tend to travel back to where they had success and stay away from areas where they got baited or didn't kill anything.
---
shhhhhh I didn’t say if it was expired or not did I? Stick around kid you might learn something
---
The autism is physically manifesting itself.
---
You're talking out of your ass. tf would test need rmt/bot isk, when the highsec keepstar they have is literally funding this war for them.
---
Maybe they shouldn't have allowed anyone to store an unlimited amount of titans in a single structure.
---
The price for that omega is INSANE!!!
---
The only thing that's clear is that you don't know what you are talking about.
---
Well neither do I but you don't see me botting. 🤔
---
oh noes! quick, bring out the pitchforks, we have another solid 'proof' of rmt/botting from the big empires of eve!  /s
---
Blackout was a huge mistake. We had lots of fun during blackout and, now that it's gone, the status quo is intolerable. Null is a joke now and nothing at all is on the horizon.
---

If you keep making that face it's going to stay that way..
---
only for the initial cyno, allowing you to immediately seed as many t1 haulers as you can carry
---
its a great improvement over having to burn a t1 indy all the way thru nullsec. not to mention the covops would be exponentially easier if you decided to use wormholes
---
Hey I died to a rat yesterday. :C
---
CCP: "Whats FW?"
---
Also consider a target painter. This will not slow the target at all but it will cause more damage to apply, especially in regard to missile. Its not a grappler/web but you do get the increase damage applied.
---
Yep, looks like a classical case of Spodbrain. I assume its in the third stage judging by the symptoms and the looks.
---
Technically they made three. Blackout, Cynos, Undo-Blackout
---
I don't get it, so wtf are they doing with csm? They just pay plane ticket and offer a coffee or what?
---
I've gone through his videos for the last month and so far no dice. Are you sure you don't remember which stream it was from?
---
So like, this isn't my job, I don't get paid. It's not a courthouse and I've sworn on a stack of bibles. I mean, I'm biased of course, we all are, but I try to be as neutral as possible. This is why most of the mods on my channel are non-Legacy, so they keep me in check. It's just a game that I enjoy talking about. Nothing more.
---
Unless something changed in the past like 8 months, Alphas can’t even use prototype cloaks(which sucks)

Unachoring a citadel in high sec. When the timer runs out, can anyone scoop it immediately or is there some sort of timer when only the owning corp can scoop it up?

Lol i have to show this to Imbor he is never gonna believe Darwinism said this.
---
Nah I know man, it's not meant to insult you personally, just make light of the fact that there's at least one or two grains of salt that this post should be taken with. Bless
---
I think there can be a happy medium of zero local vs some local.  I think I would be ok with a region wide local.  But also I think CCP should have eased us into the no local thing.  maybe start with you don't appear in local until you break cloak, and then go from there.
---
FRT are the worst RMT'ers, but we did it the least and ruined our server so we are here now.
---
Don't you think that CCP might have been considering a "chaos era" before they announced it?
---
Oh, right on man.
---
I think people pulling out all their AT ships, shit fitting them and then getting destroyed is a sign of the times. The players who coveted those ships as a trophy of their achievements in this game, have finally begun to give up on Eve and are sacrificing these ships as testament to their apathy for the game.
---
I seriously doubt it
---
(Botting) ventures can't run plex anymore, iirc
---
Nope, Eve revolves around trust. Only formal legal stuff you can come by in game are courier contracts to my knowledge.
---
can you point to the CCP doll where the Plex touched you?
---
Right, Alpha, my bad!  The long way it is!
---
:(
---
Then the buyer has to move the isk. Or, as the parent said,
---
&gt;You'd still have to move the isk in and out of that account. Creating a very obvious trail.
---
It's for him to tell, but you can work it out through the killboard based on the system and approximate date.
---
We actually take a lot of them pretty seriously and players have faced sanctions for breaking them in the past
---
Because guilty and powerful people have never lied before.
---
But, none of this can be proven either way right? It's just like schoolyard insults or something?
---

Since you know so much about Legacy, how about you provide proof of rmt'ing and botting within Legacy members? Otherwise, you're just another internet troll.

Nice neighbor in the sense that we had lots of fun skirmishes with them until noraus decided to team up with TRUMPLFART to try to evict us.

Supposedly you buy a permit and then won't be shot by them.  Do you think they actually check some list of permit-holders before shooting someone?  No.  They don't.

Dear Mercenaries and Capsuleers,
---
At CCP, one of our core principles is that we work to provide our players with excellent experiences. This mindset can be found within every creative team working on bringing your beloved virtual worlds to life. This means that we keep challenging ourselves every step of the way by asking difficult questions when facing tough decisions – especially when this principle could be compromised.
---
The development of Project Nova is an example of where this fundamental belief has been continuously exercised and put into practice.
---
At EVE Vegas, we showed you the most recent iteration of our vision to provide an engaging and unique FPS experience to enrich the EVE Universe. Our goal for this was always to reinforce the 'One War // One Universe' gameplay and create a worthy spiritual successor to DUST 514 that has the potential to captivate not only existing Mercenaries and Capsuleers, but also to attract new adventurers into the ever-evolving world of New Eden.
---
Over the course of Project Nova's development, we conducted a number of player research sessions with external partners, tirelessly playtested the game internally and brought community stalwarts in to help us evaluate the project. Now, after taking all this research and feedback into account, we see that the gameplay experience in its current form does not live up to our original vision and would not achieve our ambitious goals for this project. As a result, we will not be moving forward with the upcoming invite-only Alpha until further notice.
---
We are aware that many of you have been eagerly anticipating the moment when you can get your hands on Project Nova. Please accept our heartfelt apologies for the disappointment this will no doubt cause. We hope you understand that we need to take a step back and return to the drawing board, where we will spend more time figuring out how all this hard work can translate into something better and more meaningful for the EVE Universe. Remaining true to our vision of Project Nova's future in connection with EVE is essential. That is the only way we will be able to continue creating memorable experiences that ensure you - our ineffable players – are satisfied and make us proud as developers.
---
Project Nova continues to evolve and we remain committed to delivering a high-quality team-based shooter experience to EVE Online fans, while exploring new and exciting opportunities to integrate the two games. CCP is in no rush to release Project Nova until we're satisfied it provides a rock-solid gameplay experience and visuals to match.

Solution... npcs go to war and Soviet changes and only friendlies are the militias. War war war. Burn it all down and then make eve2.0 eve after able.
---
Nice /r/eveporn
---
They're already way too popular and easy to make and you want to speed things up? Wtf
---
If you don't follow doctrine you're not eligible for reimbursement by the alliance when the ship is lost.
---
CCP doesn't allow foul play like using asset safety to secretly undock for NC. pilots.
---
And Ventures 😉
---
Honestly, the cyno changes are pretty big for LS generally, and the Ventures was definitely a point of issue for a lot of people too.
---
So, sure they haven't revamped the whole thing, but we haven't been left further behind
---
It's a system of rules imposed by threat of violence -- it counts, it's just corrupt and unjust. 
---
Which makes it fit in well with most modern nations...
---
WoW Classic?
---
Change how asset protection works in k-space.
---
The station owner is required to pay a tax based on the \[mass|value|number\] of \[ships|items\] docked and stored to "enable" asset protection otherwise the station loot pinatas just like wormholes. This tax should be inversely related to the security status of the system the upwell is in (null sec is most expensive, high sec is least).
---
Allow cargo scanners (or other module) to verify whether asset protection is enabled and get some sort of data on the value of the structure contents similar to analyzers current mechanic.
---
This provides the opportunity both for intel (there is now the opportunity for probers to gather intel on where fleets are staging) and a great driver for encourage station bashing in all security statuses.
---
Is there context for this?
---
When you say "recruiter", I'm thinking of the staff that handle interviews and check ESI for spies. Those folks are highly trusted by their corp and someone who joins a corp with the *intention* of becoming a recruiter will be rejected by the vast majority of corps. So there isn't much reason to publish the data.
---
If you're thinking of a recruiter as a line member who gets a friend to join (similar to CCP's refer-a-friend bonus), then that's a much more reasonable question to ask. However, I still don't think most corps will publish the information externally. It's not really something they would want to factor into your decision on whether or not to join them.
---
Gentle reminder that AOE doomsdays used to exist and were removed because they were OP as shit.  Then CCP had the bright idea to reintroduce them for some reason, and they’re still OP as shit if used correctly (or spammed by the 500 titans each bloc has).
---
I'm running 18 characters with 108 planets. I figured how to do PI in daily waves so I do not have to touch each planet every day. Making a few P4s that I rotate through on a bi-monthly basis, in addition to some requested P3s.
---
I would say the same to you, as you seem to be perfectly happy with completely shattering the in-game economy, as long as it makes your blocs sandcastle bigger at the expense of everyone else whose existence in the game you deem invalid.  
---
Just sore since WC lost even with your help. Crawl back to your hole and quit crying about it.
---
I had not kept the returning Alpha clone in mind.
---
Everything being equal I would definitely say that non-alpha modules are going to be off-lined which HAS to limit what he can do with the ship, right? I don’t think landing rights would be determined by clone status, that should be a faction issue.
---
/also: hilarious video, thanks!
---
Kinda toxic but okay
---
While we are spitballing ideas: null rats not longer give an isk bounty from Concord. They drop equivalent isk in loot and tags which must be repressed  to build stuff or sold to npc buyers in Concord station.
---
Which boots? The ones who show up at my door to arrest me for refusing to pay my taxes to fund the pension of 100 million lazy assholes or the boots of the guy who refuses to give every single person in his company a pension, whom by the way I can voluntarily walk away from at any time?
---
I think I'll take screenshots someone would get banned for fabricating over a screenshot of some random chat app with no proof.
---
Excuse me I think we have fucked up Cal Mal enough! No need for CCP to step in.
---
Joking aside the cyno change I personally think has had a good effect on low so far. 
---
Chaos what chaos, all I seen was some cement poured into a sandbox and now it’s stuck in carebear mode till the end of its days.

Long live the blackout but in areas not just null.

Seems like a legitimate excuse to me, old code is hard to change, sometimes. And changing a little thing can be a real pain in the a** for very little profit.
---
You don't make a 20 jumps travel to make only few thousands ISK profit 😅
---
did you really want CCP to touch FW ? they have the opposite effect of the midas touch atm
---
Grath you fucking suck at this game.  Do us all a favor and uninstall immediately.
---
Only one of the epic arcs is (or at least was) worth it for the reward:  Caldari.
---
I'm positive with all factions, primarily from doing SoE epic, repeatable every 3 months (which I've not done for years now).
---
I mostly do Caldari &amp; Amarr, then do Sisters of Eve to raise Gallente.  The SoE arc takes care of Mimatar, and Gallente when desired (you can pick any player faction to champion).
---
Not entirely untouched - a lot of null bots probably moved in on FW plexes when blackout started.
---
&gt; The fact that the nullsec blackout had most people out there TOO AFRAID TO UNDOCK is abysmally pathetic.
---
This has nothing to do with fear, it's just risk management.
---
If you decline all storyline missions, and all missions vs. player factions (missions that affect standing have a [clickable faction icon in the offer](https://eve-files.com/media/1201/2012.01.09.13.24.14.jpg)), you will never lose nor gain player faction standing.
---
I have an alt with &gt;9 standing with Caldari Navy, and has no standing with any player faction.  Not even Caldari.  I also have an alt with high Caldari Navy and Imperial Armaments, and again no player faction standing.
---
No standing is different from 0.0 but effectively the same thing.
---
You can decline 1 mission per agent per 4 hours, but can use multiple agents with the same corp ... or even do a lower level mission while you wait (I like to do level 3 in an Assault Frigate).  The text changes from 'once every 4 hours' to 'in the next 4 hours' when you have declined a mission less than an hour ago.
---
nice job..  perhaps should train spy alt?
---
any advice for this?
---
glad that people are still doing this
---
They won't quit - - sunk cost fallacy is a hell of a thing.
---
PLEASE tell me you have probes and a cloak on it. :D   
---
Probe yourself in, survey the locals, wait for some dank kills.
---
Grath has supported blackout consistently despite its clear negative impact on the game. He is not proposing alternatives or other solutions. He is trolling /r/eve calling people idiots for suggesting that CCP should operate like a business and actually care about keeping customers.
---
Blackout was causing an unprecedented drop in online player count that presumably translated into lost subscriptions for CCP. The negative impact to the game and CCP's bottom line is indisputable regardless of any individual opinion on the change. This is an objective fact and anyone arguing it is ignoring reality.
---
That doesn't mean it's the only change possible. It's not even the change most people have been asking for.
---
Now what have I said to support your accusation? Or are you assuming my position blindly?
---
You know.. After playing the Eve Echoes alpha, and without violating the NDA.. I think CCP should scrap PI and rework it to how its done in Echoes.  its WAY easier.  Which makes sense as its mobile.  But if they did it like in echoes it would change the game a lot about pi.  But it seriously took me like 20 min to setup 3 plants on Sunday.  and i have 27 more to go.  FML
---
That's a good thing, maybe it means they'll stop FW missions printing LP... or just stop FW missions all together.
---
I run 30 planets, as its 6 across 5 accounts.  but i used to run 40 pos' alone.. so yea i'm a bit nuts.  (Also why i HATE pos' and can;t wait for them to die)
---

---
I have no doubt that Fraternity's backbone is botting and RMT. However, why would I not also think that about AoM?
---
Thank you for removing the blackout from reports. Information feedback even just being able to reply that a customer exists and his report is appreciated, goes a long way.
---
Well, it certainly does now.
---
Press F to pay respects for the SMAW guys whose MOS no longer exists.
---
throw banned characters into the specific official corporations like Doomheim. So we can distinguish banned character or just abandoned one.
---
and the "new player here what corp should i join" aren't bait posts?
---
It's painful having screenshots of rmt in "certain groups" but not being able to do anything since nobody wants the info and most will just call me a liar.
---
The first is the manager and the second is who sell the idea. So, yes when I say a recruiter, I'm thinking about the last one.
---
A recruitment reward program is an investment in new members.  
---
&gt;It's not really something they would want to factor into your decision on whether or not to join them. 
---
I'm sorry, but my eyes are not what they used to be. Any chance you could post the pictures instead of the thumbnails?
---
And, unlike most organizations in the game, no saying words like fuck.
---
And here we go, the RMT accusation bandwagon. Hands up all those who were expecting this kind of shit when chinesse came to TQ.
---
No, next suggestion?
---
I think it's pretty clear I was doing one of those memes.
---
Can you name some of the damage i personally did?
---
My game play has constantly been nerfed for 13 years bud, try again.
---
My goals have chnaged a lot in the 15 years i have played this game.  And i highly doubt i will make my two new goals happen but meh.
---
My biggest goal, after having owned space, a nyx, and other stuff, is to get a titan.. and blow it up in either 1 day or 1 year.  Why?
---
I bought my first Thany in 2006/07 when my corp was supporting UK in the UK vs CVA war, and we were 'fighting' (getting our butts handed to us) Cry Havoc (hi mistress suffering, if you are reading this) I had it a week, it was poorly fit an di had borrowed money to get it.  well Cry Havoc killed me in it.  Good times.
---
I then had a Nyx, my second fav ship in eve behind that Thorax, and i had that when i was a renter in atlas space, just before White Noise kicked them out (or right after, i forget)  was being stupid and lost it after a month. (you can find the story if you do some searching, 2 moms lost in a day)
---
I was told by 5 alliance mates if they ever caught me in a titan they'd kill me themselves.  good times.
---
So i either need to keep the titan for 1 day or 1 year.
---
My second goal is to build a keep star, myself in a C3 wh.. this one will take me a while.
---
A screenshot of a receipt isn't a GM interaction lmao
---
What makes that so appealing to you, anyway?
---
Skimmed but two simple points.
---
1) Who says the Chaos era is over?
---
2) is below or above
---
The server was chinesse and its dead, no proof needed, who did it is irrelevant. And of course same destiny awaits TQ.
---
Well, still better than sending some edgy smacktalk afterwards vOv
---
&gt; clear negative impact on the game. 
---
what a load of shit lmao
---
&gt;This is an objective fact and anyone arguing it is ignoring reality.
---
yikes, apparently you have a different definition of objectivity than the rest of the world.
---
Best idea hands down so far.
---
Some groups have pretty straight rules about "social behaviour" ingame, too. See for example Blades of Grass: [https://bladesofgrass.space/philosophy.html](https://bladesofgrass.space/philosophy.html)
---
Great story man. That's fantastic. Updoots
---
These things are probably not related to graphics in most cases. The uniqueness of the PS3 architecture lies mainly in its CPU rather than GPU, but cross-platform engines usually do not utilize the full potential of it so you have to deal with a fewer sophisticated and platform-specific design solutions while developing and porting the game. As for graphics, with UE you already have a multi-platform render by the engine vendor.
---
lul
---
Thats not quite right though.  Sometimes you make changes to gather data on the impact of those changes or the behavior of your customers.  In this regard, there had been calls for YEARS to 'kill local in null'  hell you can search this subreddit and find countless post about this. 
---
Companies do this all the time, sometimes a change is great, sometime is blows and they learn not to do that again (new Coke is a huge example if this)  If a company doesn't take a chance sometimes, they will never know what they could do.
---
with the above said, the blackout was and will most likely be a success in CCP's eyes.  Because in theory, they got some information on player reactions and how we did things during this time (or lack there of) they could use for future development.
---
Lets say observatories (if they are still coming) we designed to remove or add local, so ccp will black out again, but wants to give alliances a chance to turn it back on.  The best way to test if this was a decent idea would be to kill local and see what happens.  Based on that information, you can go to the drawing board and find out how this effected various player orgs and how they did things and gathered info via local and use that to make changes.
---
Long term Blackout could be really good for CCP.  It could also be horrid, but we don;t know yet. We will just have to see whats next.
---
That'd be cool, might limit the audience though it's hard to say but I still wanna fire lasers down from space tho
---
Ain’t another war russian ?
---
This right here is a prime example of what makes a resounding success. Oftentimes it's not because the person who succeeded was extremely competent, but because the other guy made a mistake. I honestly wonder how many elite EvE FCs got their reputation because the other side didn't have a clue?
---
Awesome! Good job
---
WHO WANTS THESE CRAZY NEW CHAOS SKINS ONLY 19.99 LIMITED TIME ONLY
---
Yeah I got the same email 😜
---
It never started tbh, Hilmar said we should expect "much more rapid fire action from CCP than we're used to, ideally something should be changing every week, some sweeping changes, some will be wildly unpopular" (this is a direct quote from his announcement of "Chaos Era")
---
Obviously, this hasn't happened.
---
I’ve been in Brave for a long time, so it goes without saying that I’ve gotten pretty good at moving and Evaccing, and have moved things with zero reward and zero collateral with my JF Alt for people that trusted me, or newbies that were freaking out about loosing all their salvage. None of the risk was on me, and I always told people “just be aware that I could steal all your stuff if I really wanted to”, so there needed to be a significant trust in place usually from years of ingame interaction.
---
To do the same thing on an Alliance level is simply asking for someone to steal all your shit. When we did the same(alliance level ‘movacs), it was always zero reward, but properly collateralized, and those moving were paid by the alliance after the fact.
---
It's generally 3 or 4 to every one killed
---
Kangaroo Court is specifically NOT for serious things. Its in the rules that it must be over something silly and that the maximum penalty that can be imposed is 5mil isk.
---
Kangaroo Court is to meme on people.
---
This is the head mod of Chinese reddit and ceo of RR's main corp everyone, seems he's not used to posting on a platform where he can't freely brigade and delete any posts he wants to.
---
*online account number
---
A small clarification, online accounts do not speak much for online player count. Anecdotally a lot of the dropped accounts were krabbing accounts. It would be very interesting to see how many actual players left/returned due to blackout (we’re all aware that some fraction of the leaving accounts were bots)
---
I like the cut of your gib!
---
TL;DR
---
TEST &amp; pets good, WC bad
---
We raised trillions of war fund through selling legit plex, but our enemy are filthy botters
---
End of discussion
---
I think a better way to say it would have been just because they deserve it doesn’t mean i’ll take any joy out of it.
---
And CCP said they would never put +6 cheekbone implants into the game.
---
TO EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD: I read all of this and and I have come to the final appropriate conclusion one can glean from the empirical data presented by dozens of minds with respect to what is possible in a game when compared to the real scientific expectations one may have:  
---
&gt;!You're all a bunch of fucking nerds.!&lt;  
---
P.S. I love you. It was a good read.
---
Too many
---
You're not looking at it the right way.
---
I, a player with lots of solo kills and and FC experience, like to PvP. I don't, however, like spending real life $$ on plex. So I need to PvE in order to get that isk. Many people in EvE are like this.
---
There are lots of PvE options available to me. Subcap ratting in nullsec is one of them. Others include variosu forms of mining, WH shenanigans, and missions/incursions/station trading. Lets focus on 2 options though for simplicity's sake, Level 4 mission running and subcap ratting in nullsec. They can be accomplished with pretty similar levels of skills and isk invested.
---
With the intel provided by local, I could take advantage of scouts and other intel to keep my subcap ratting accounts relatively safe, and because they were safe and multi-boxable, I could pull in 80-160m an hour, depending on how many accounts I felt like running. Sure people might slip by some times or pop out of a wormhole, but that's the cost of doing business, and the return on investment is still decent. 
---
During blackout, 2 problems got combined into 1. Without VNIs, I need to either accept lower ticks (myrmidon) or higher investment (ishtar/gila/dominix) in order to maintain the income. On top of this, my intel is now far, far more limited, so I lose more ships. Now I can either try and deal with increased losses, or I can do what we talked about, and actively defend my ships. In both cases, my isk/hour goes down drastically, and I'm over here wanting to buy some fun new assault frigates and recons to PvP with. Now, why go through all these different challenges and problems when I can go to Highsec and run level 4 missions. Or do incursions. Or run level 4 Abyssal filaments. Choosing to do any of those is **perfectly reasonable** given that I want to get some isk to PvP, and I don't want to have to jump through 900 hoops or spend twice as long doing it. 
---
If you want subcap activity in nullsec in combination with some form of blackout, you need to either make it worth it from the perspective of the person trying to PvE, or accept that now those people are going to PvE in highsec instead. This is EVE ONLINE. It's a game that's literally about minmaxing the fuck out of some shit. You need to expect that people can and will do those calculations.
---
I don't know what part of maintenance mode you all fail to understand.  These changes took practically no development effort because they have practically no development capacity.  Hilmar and the others who are waiting for their earn-out period to lapse so that they can parachute out thought they'd try to keep things interesting because they were nostalgic for the time when Eve was a happening game.
---
I'd not worry yourselves too much about it.  This was probably the last hurrah.  Things will go back to "normal" and you can farm and bot away to your heart's content until they shut it down.  Eve has been a great game, but nothing is forever.  If 10 boxing Rorquals in peace is your thing, you should enjoy what's left of it.
---
Looks fine, your just fuck ugly

God damn this shits gettin good
---
Did anything changed about ventures besides them being unable to capture plexes?
---
My bet would be some stupid legal contract reason
---
See most of those sounds fair, but the no ransoming rule kinda erks me. That's a huge part of player generated content when in low/nullsec. Now, forcing members to honor the ransom agreement is 100% fair, since blowing up a ransomed ship just hurts the entire playstyle for everyone. 
---
Also no cursing? Fuck that.
---
I'm shocked it wasn't a time limited exclusivity clause. More so with sony knowing the ps4 would be released shortly
---
I rarely use this word unironically, but eve U is filled with carebears. I have never seen a member outside of highsec.
---
Yep.  He is sure keeping everyone guessing...about if the game will be around in a year or two.  
---
I actually don’t mind changes, but if you are going to do rapid fire changes, you have to be ready to change them back just as quick and not be surprised when you start unraveling the games multiple interlocking gameplay.  .  
---
Better of course would be to make multiple coherent changes that add real value to the game, and not just piss everyone off.
---
As a member who rarely goes anywhere higher than 0.5, I'm working on fixing that.
---
Didn't even think about that.  I imagine that wont last long though.  Old content the wont get new content with shit ppl complained about back then.
---
Then why not leave and make your own alliance with flapjacks and hookers?
---
“Presumably translated” to “objective fact” in the span of a single sentence! Your CFC overlords must be so proud...
---
“Online accounts” also includes Alphas, does it not?
---
" **ZERO ISK AND ZERO collateral. WTF!!**  " - that right there is just pure gold. Take my upvote.
---
Nah I'm not looking at it the wrong way simply because your personal experience is a particular way. I have argued in other posts that blackout should have been accompanied by higher rewards in nullsec to offset the higher risk.
---
tldr
---
Cant fuck up something that's already perfectly fucked as it is. Cant see a good way to make It worse
---
Nice take op. Did the alliance reimburse the assets or leave their members hanging?
---
There's a reason so many alliances require collateralized couriers.
---
I mean both groups are here in our server because there is zero content for them on theirs, AoM made it barren of content.   Now AoM are on our server aligned with the 2 largest groups on our server, and you think things wont go the same way?  Meme's aside that is the reality we are facing and you say (Test) will make sure that doesnt happen?
---
Someone finally got that Little Focker.
---
Murkar Omistarios v Vaari was an epic legal battle that set presendence in provi for all.
---
Why don’t you make the point I presume you’re trying to couch rather than asking what seems like a redundant and rhetorical question?
---
China was a mistake.
---
Tommy Dassalo, pure mobster. gj
---
Absolutely. 
---
Messaging...I saw absolutely no messaging at all other than them saying this is what we want, and if you don’t like it you can HTFU. 
---
They put a massive pile of their goodwill in the middle of a field and set it ablaze in hopes of entertaining a minority of vocal people.  
---
If anything came of this, and I kind of doubt that anything did, one hopes that they will both seek input from the players and CSM and then take their feedback into consideration before they roll the dice on the game hoping they get lucky.  
---
One also hope that they will outline a vision of what they really want to do with Eve and how future changes push this vision forward....if they in fact have a vision. 
---
Let’s invest time/money into making a better game and not just trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic or offering up the most cheap and low effort razzle-dazzle they can get away with.
---
Nope, that's all that was really wanted.
---
always play jin'taan videos at 1.5x
---
Fun?
---
Half wondered if my understanding was wrong, tbh...else all the screeching about dropping "online accounts" seems even more disingenuous.
---
I'm giving you s spite upvote, begrudgingly because it was funny. Not because you'r right.
---
Everyone tried to make it about not being able to catch ratters though.
---
Wipe it clean, twenty nineteen!!
