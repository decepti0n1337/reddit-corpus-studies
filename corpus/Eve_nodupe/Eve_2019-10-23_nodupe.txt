Indeed. Yet somehow CFC has perfected both.
---
---
---
that would be ccp's side to find a solution on. with recent announcements one would think npe has a high priority and i wanted to give my feedback on that.
---
What about this is making Eve easier? Leveling the field on SP generation by removing attributes? Removing useless static NPC content that has no storyline attached to it? I mean MAYBE you could argue that removing empire standing penalties from missions is making it easier, except that the problem is that the game fails to present you with any information regarding the impact of these drops in standing. In a game where spaceships cross light-years in an instant, there shouldn't be arcane knowledge of basic issues like that. It serves no purpose but to get careless or ignorant players killed and mildly inconvenience those who know how to deal with it. It's not a mechanic that adds any value or content to the game besides "lol that guy got blown up and I stole his stuff."
---
You shouldn't have to Google something to find out that jumping the wrong gate gets you blown up. That's absurd and we need to quit thinking that it's okay for a game to be so poorly documented that people die to mechanics with no warning.
---
Wormholes? Sounds like a lot of waiting around.

should I get back into playing Eve?

You can run one of any of these 3, Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade II, Small Memetic Algorithm Bank II, or Small Emission Scope Sharpener II.
---
I personally run a Small Memetic Algorithm Bank II to be able to hack a can in a ghost site as quick and efficiently as possible since there is a timer that detonates the cans and spawns the NPCs and a failed hack also detonates the can. So time and brute force is important.  
---
If you dont plan  on running ghost sites, I would recommend the Small Emission Scope Sharpener II because Relic site cans do tend to be worth more and its painful on the off chance you fail a 100 million isk can.

Welcome to PL bois

I had the SAME idea regarding skill "grinding"! I'm relatively new still, and one of the things I kept thinking about when I was out in my Venture waiting for mining barge skill, or in my barge waiting for exhumer skill was "why does all of this mining I'm doing not increase my relevant skills?" How is it possible for my character to be doing all this stuff and not learning anything from it? 
---
I believe my specific thought (especially considering I was really only considering mining skill grind at the time) was that rather than awarding skill points directly, the act of mining itself would increase your skill gain by some factor for those specific skills while you were doing it. 
---
This would help make those types of tasks more enjoyable since you'd know there are two benefits (ore, and sp gain). Which is similar to how other activities work. When I go ratting, I get ISK bounties AND loot/salvage. When I go hacking, I get salvage AND datacores. 
---
I think the dual-purpose-everything just in general would make all career paths more fun. Like, what if after mining an ore of ice, there was some space debris that gets released from its frozen prison? And the larger and more rare the ice chunk was, the better the thing is that was in it. 
---
But yes, doing more = learning more is a highly desirable feature for us newbs!
---
I like both things.
---
No idea why you think otherwise just because other people don't understand basic human motivation.

Good to know...How long have you been doing this? You seem to know a lot which means I have a lot to learn. I’ve only come across 1 ghost site so far and I didn’t know what it was until afterwards. I luckily made it out alive in a Mag. I saw red pop up in general and jumped as fast as I could. That one can I got to though was 14mil of loot.

There shouldn't be a difference though - right?

Who's the genius that jumped a fucking salvage rorqual before the tatara died?
---
AAR: Final space hobos tat timer. Don’t think they are coming as we are slowly grind down the hull, then all of a sudden Leshak fleet and Dreks arrive. Immediately they bring in fax and dreads. We stick on grid and take the fight with subs and after 6mins we escalate. GF
---
I can very much tell you that BO-LD is no more that risk averse. I know because i am part of them. We miss the gud fite and we have pretty ships to get killed. Point us where you want the content and i will move the corp up. 
---
Cheer mate, all in favor of good fights.
---
Just get rid of skills.  They are a more of a burden then anything at this point.  A level playing field is what the players wanted in 2015.  CCP gave us injectors.   OR   Allow remaps for subcap, cap, mining, etc  which slides the skills to what you want to do.  Allow new players to remap once a day for the first few months.
---
Get rid of tiers of ship too, this will level the playing field.  Something like a t2 line only cheaper.  Make ships cheaper so people will be less risk averse.
---
I do. If I’m gonna be out there flying I might as well look fabulous doing it
---
Would be awesome if they would fix stuff AND add new stuff that aint broken in the beginning. Dreaaaaaams, are my realityyyyy....

"I'm fine I can tank it"

...that is gameplay.

And statistically, new players that lose ships sooner stay longer.

Yeah looks like a good fight :/
---
Amazon mechanical turk. It's a task marketplace where you do small tasks for small pay. You can scale pretty easily and make 6-10$ an hour, which would be like 500-700m isk and hour. With no risk of losing ships.
---
Very scaleable.
---
r/angryupvote
---
You clearly haven't seen just how much misinformation gets passed around in bad highsec corps.
---
The game shouldn't depend on its players to teach each other how basic mechanics work.
---
You dont understand, I need to be able to pvp in complete safty, I should be able to solo a titan in a meta 0 kestrel because I'm mad people worked and saved isk to get a titan
---
&gt;Let them reship into something that can fight back
---
They wouldn't come back until they have triple your numbers and more logi than you have ships, so you just kill them

Never seen that fit, doesnt seem too bad
---
We're Arma 3 now boys
---
Ohh, that’s how they got them.
---
Always B because I hate fighting kitey shit. Hate flying it myself as well.
---
I mean it really isn't.  It was what used to be baseline.  Then they released a gimped version as free.  So when new people came then Omega would be precieved as as premium when really it's just the same as before.  
---
Ahh good ol Stellaris I haven't played in ages it seems
---
I used to run something similar but with one cap booster and a web. It's incredibly tanky, but cap is tight and some cruisers can still haze you, mostly those that do explosive.
---
Ok but their dps can be scaled down. Most newbs die too fast.
---
Fair.
---
As much as it sucks to lose a fight to a black screen, staying up for 18 hours unable to log out because of tidi isn't any better, to be honest.
---
At least the bits inbetween 500 man fights, and 5000 man fights got better.
---
yawn, another testserver pic, get out
---
CCP, give us "EVE Classic" server!
---
Giga cringe
---
You guys dropped 4 super carriers on our 6 man sub cap gang the other day...
---
Intentionally hiding cost so it doesn't become obvious this is the test server
---
You want a detailed critique? OK, fine. I've done it before and I'll do it again. This is likely not going to be complete from the get go, and will probably receive a few edits and/or follow up responses, but here goes.
---
Skill queue changes are pointless. I've seen it change from the 24 hour limited queue, to the 1 month limit, to unlimited, with several ui iterations. Excluding the "train now" pop-up, what we have now is more or less the same as what we had in 2009, if not worse. Just leave it be, it gets the job done and any new version would be a shitfest judging from previous attempts.
---
Injectors simply cannot and will not ever be balanced. They were introduced as a primary money maker, and do their job fantastically. In game, the only way to balance them is to remove them. What difference does it make to a veteran if he gets his 6th cap alt tomorrow or in 2 months? He'll just plan ahead and maybe even prepare 3 rorq alts with his already high income to make up for the inability to get them instantly. Meanwhile new players lack the experience and knowledge of game mechanics to afford or properly make use of injectors, and can't afford them if they want to do anything fun with their isk. Getting some limited skills from missions is fine, it's already done in the tutorial, as long as it sticks to the absolute essentials.
---
As for a PvE overhaul, yes, standings need to change. But removed? No, absolutely not. EVE is an mmorpg sandbox. If you remove standings you remove a huge part of the RPG. You build a character, make choices when interacting with the universe, and then have to live with said choices. Did you go for a military career in the Amarr Navy? Cool bruh, Amarr loves you, but the Minmatar definitely won't be happy you blew up a few thousand ships of theirs. This is part of what keeps the game from being literal spreadsheets in space, and has allowed the RP community to exist. Do standings need to be straightforward, less tedious and limiting? Yes. Gone? No. 
---
Character attributes. This one seems to be the flavor of the month spicy topic. They're another one of those few remaining features that make the game an RPG where your choices actually matter in character building. You used to get vastly different attributes depending on your race and bloodline, and learning skills were important. Did that mean I knew or cared about any of this as a newbie? No, I made my Sebiestor engineer char because I liked the back story and went on to train all sorts of random stuff. When I first joined a nullsec group and told to train a set of skills to get on the right track I didn't whine that I couldn't catch up to them vets. I just trained the skills while fooling about with my new friends in cheap ships. 
---
Now I have 80m sp on my main and 30m on my alt. Looking at a leshak fit I use, my alt, with absolutely no gunnery skills and no precursor battleship skill gets precisely 50% of the DPS I get on my main with near perfect gunnery skills. If I train all the prereqs and supports on my alt to 3-4, which takes less than 2 weeks, I can get about 85% of the performance I get on my main on the same fit. And this is not with a remap or injectors or anything, I just removed all my charisma and moved it to other attributes. The reality is that people forget how absurdly fast newbies can catch up to a 10 year veteran if they focus on a couple things. Another example, a newbie I've adopted has just over 5m sp. He has 85% of my DPS on a Nestor, can use t2 remote reps and cap transfers, can fully fit t2 tank. After going omega, the only serious gain in performance he got was the mjd. He could already hold his ground in c5 sites by my side. Stop lying to newbies and telling them that if they don't have everything at 5 they're worthless. 
---
As for attributes, just how much of a difference do they actually make? With a bad remap you gain (17+17/2)/2=13 sp a minute. With a perfect one (27+21/2)/2=19, and (21+21/2)=15 with no remap. This all is with no implants, which reduce the effect of remaps. Perfect vs no remap is about 25% faster training, or 20% less time spent to get the same sp(before implants, this is important). For any skill up to lvl 4 with a x2-x3 multiplier, where newbies do about 80% of the catching up with vets, this is a few hours difference at worst. If you factor in +3 implants you get 17.5(no remap) vs 21(perfect remap), which is much closer than before with perfect being about 15% faster training, or 11-12% less time spent training the same skill. Not only would removing attributes make a tiny, tiny difference to newbies, who shouldn't be aiming for the massive trains that actually benefit meaningfully from remaps, it would also remove the incentive to plan your training ahead and specialize. This makes little sense since EVE has always been a game about planning for different scenarios and slowly building on your plan.

I'm a little overloaded rn, so I'll be wrapping this up in a couple hours, either with an edit or another reply.

The ads added a noticeable load to CPU and graphics card. When I'm docked I'm most likely afkish, I don't want my PC to waste power for something I don't see anyways. Multiboxer btw.

Did you read and understood the warning message before boarding your ship?   
---
Deal with it. HTFU.

That works? You sure? lol
---
holy shit this is amazing!
---
My nano-gang (and I imagine most) would much rather fight your response fleet. HOWEVER that doesn't mean we're going to stick around when you bring 3+ times our numbers. We fly nano specifically because we want the option to disengage if the massive blob shows up. Put ships in space, and we'll figure out how to attack them if we can.
---
i mean, i have this value sitting in my personal hanger. sure i dont ONLY have dreads lol. but i could. easily. 100dreads isnt even alot tbh. now look at how many tits there are are moloks etc.
---
I can confirm that having to fit caches of hundred is a nightmare.  
---
Especially when someone else fits them, trades them to you, but then left out key things like fucking fuel and stront...
---
The whole point of nano is to run away and kite. A response fleet using similar doctrines will just run away at each other. If you have rules you mail the FC hey I have 10 and you must have 10, otherwise dont go complain.
---
Eve is a farming simulator now, ppl join farm and quit because there will be nothing left to do. All hail the blue donut.
---
Option C keep ratting.
---
They can't fight my Super with a 30man Bomberfleet, its way too low dps. You need at least a big fleet to reach considerable dps equivalent to some Dreadnoughts. Since *cHaOs eRa* we all reshipped to fulltank so even if your skills suck you should have at least 40mil ehp somewhat on a shield Super for ratting.
---
But I'm sitting in Delve thats the difference.
---
How dare you ban the top memelord
---
eve, first person, but struggling with realistic economy, and mostly is about things looking cool rather than feeling cool.
---
so elite dangerous then? lol
---
Most people buy them from their corpmatres who produce them. But if you're independent, just look for them on the market in lowsec, and make sure the sell order is in an NPC station.
---
are you speaking about SC and eliteD or SC and eve?
---
Sure it is. Just make sure you're exploring in low class wormholes (class 1-4). Most exploration sites in high class holes are 'sleeper' sites, which means they are guarded by powerful rats and they don't give much exploration loot anyway.
---
Agree. that's way to shiny for Minmatar.
---
(Any idea what this actually is?)
---
If you're flying Stratios, T3D, T3C, Gilas, anything with a probe launcher - you can easily do 30+ systems and scan them while shooting Hideaways. Now imagine all that saved in personal locations every day
---
https://i.imgur.com/gr5nQN8.png
---
Sure, especially in wormholes its still common practice to use a small POS as temporary base as you move in, or use one to protect your suitcase orca/carrier while you're out doing stuff.
---
If you want to store ships you need at least a POS. If you want to keep small stuff a secure container anchored on an unaligned safe is an option as is a Mobile Depot. The container can't be scanned down while the depot is scanable but also offers refitting in space.
---
I still hope they introduce small upwell structures to replace POSes for short term stays.

34 K damage taken. He tanked like a boss and only died because he ran out of cap boosters.
---
well there's the t3 resists, defense mode and dual reps to consider. with the mwd shut off and dual webs applied, i don't think the ammo was the guy's biggest worry.
---
Yes but people normally want them to be wandering around as enemies rather than as friends or allies.

That was not not my contention. My contention is that the armor kestrel was not strictly inferior to the shield version.
---
You're a victim of anti-ganking propaganda, friend. We retain players by introducing them to the freedom of the player-driven sandbox. We coach them on how to excel as we punish them for their extravagances. Only the bot-aspirants and solo themeparkers quit, and they would have left anyway once they realized what EVE was about.
---
We don't often hit new players, since they carry very little of value, but when we do they are [more likely to keep playing](https://youtu.be/A92Ge2S8M1Y?t=89).
---
If you use multifit it all the hulls take the name of the fit. Or did you think someone went through one at a time typing "rigs in cargi"
---
I dunno man, 100 dreads is still a lot of dreads. If you were using less around 30 titans and 30 supercarriers you would bleed heavily to 100 dreads

so is that how some people make awesome EVE Online PvP videos on youtube? They're just videoing what they do on the test server and pretend that they made kills and roams on Tranquility?
---
Pretty much that, I've been teaching my newbies about them and also how to deal with various other things that are only found within EVE like being ganked in a "safe space".
---
It was hard not to laugh but glad I got them rested in understanding that "Thats just EVE, its how it is" and that various things should be done with people and not solo... as that old image of showing EVE's learning curve always comes to mind.

---
You absolutely can do this. I did it years ago using three accounts: main, orca, and salvager. If you're curious, my thread from 2012 is still the top google result for "wormhole nomad." With a T3C, a mobile depot and some creativity, you can pack everything you need into a single ship. 
---
Work out the various fits you need: scouting, PVE, and PVP if you're so inclined. Get the modules and subs sorted out and model the whole kit in Pyfa or the ingame simulator, right down to your cargo hold and sub bay. Day trip a few wormholes to get a feel for how it all fits together.
---
When you're comfortable with it, dive and in don't come back until you need more ammo.
---
Lmao
---
You fucking weirdo. Don't you have empires to build or something?

sadly my best advice is to not expect eve to be a pvp game..anymore

Nobody wants to fight horde since you guys just cap spam and blob. Don't waste your time Friday

Lmfao I was there. They had almost nothing on that grid, all the faxes were on the other side of the gate. That Komodo is also 3 tank modules short of a brick tanked fit, with no links and no phenom

You were banned for this post.

The real numbers is 4367 virgins in a basement somewhere. Multiboxing 6 accounts each.
---
Pretty sure the math CCP shared a while ago averaged it out to 1.3 or 1.5 characters online per real person.
---
Sure there's a lot of multiboxers in Null and WH space, but there's also lots of folks flying on one account in FW, running missions on a single acc. in HS, etc. etc.

Dude. You drop like this small groups that you outnum 10 to 1 in members. But if a closer num, then you blue them.

You are right with the kids. When my kid was much younger that wasn’t an option for sure. Now that he’s older it’s no longer a problem.

Exactly that were the core failures of Farms&amp;Fields patches as quant pointed out and got fired for ....
---
Literally nothing to do with the game but with the human condition of banding together and wanting to win. It's not surprising most people choose the easy way to play this game (joining goons) because it's human nature. It doesn't matter if you're an intricate complex person with diversified interests and open-mindedness, the mindless creature that gets validation from a perceived feeling of winning will always band together with his mindless peers and form a superior entity
---
the only supercapital that matters is the titan.
---
This is normal during ctas with some serious pvp corp I believe... the abnormal thing is at 100% tax all the time
---
Wrong killmail, the apostle that got bombed in lxq earlier this month moonwalked out of the paala gate, my bad.
---
my capacitor went from 70% to 0% and I burnt my guns at the same time. I panic'd so hard

Not surprised its why I mostly stay in Bombers Bar, I have loads of other ways to enjoy EVE but was wondering in case anyone asked me from my community as they are all new bros.
---
But titans aren't good investments for your isk.
---
explain
---
Yeah they only do it when it's getting to hot under their feet.
---
was using anti matter and heat for a while, swapped to void at last bit to try to see if it worked better
---
I solo them in a HAC so, I’m not seeing the problem
---
Trick or Treat, indeed.
---
God I would be so damn committed to that. Been building ships and  hoarding modules throughout the years but never came to sell them. Enough to equip a small alliance and go to war. Sadly It would all be destroyed in mere seconds as those RMT/botting alliances are all protected by both sides of the donut. Because who can't resist all that free money coming your way, right?
---
Maybe I was just doing some wishful thinking.  I appreciate you checking up on my posting history as well - it's always nice to have a fan.  Good luck with your future blobbing efforts - I'm sure those killmarks on the side of your caps make you a better man.

We fought an armor rlml cerb fleet with way too many logi and some support in a c4 wolf-rayet, 15+ in total. It took them  25-30 mins to form this for our shield fit 4-5 caracals, one cerberus  and one sabre. They warped in half of their fleet to 70 km to the hole we were sitting on. We bubbled so the other half landed on us and we managed to burn down a few of them before we had to flee. They got a few of us too but I'm still proud of that we tricked them. :)
---
I was not aware of that, also, might have to do with the fact that every time I tried sharing with someone, I kept getting robbed (in games and irl) so I like having my own space I can lock up lol

Who is switching from shield to armor?  HMU if you are looking to sell shit.
---
as a newbro i dont like the idea of Freelance Missions. Sounds like dailys and something more for a theme park mmo not a sandbox.
---
Why tf are you critisizing how I want to play a game???
---
&gt;  Anything above a bil would be suspicious.
---
 and un-actionable under the vast majority of circumstances. 
---
On a related note
---
As it stands RMT is legal, its just game developers fighting for their IP and overreaching. It's a multi billion dollar industry. That being said, if you get banned - nobody cares.
---
Eve online isk is like $3-4 a billion, which isn't worlds better than the deals CCP offers through packages on those 50% off sales if you sell all the pieces. It's actually dumb not to buy from CCP unless you're bankrolling a super fleet.  Assuming CCP continues making those deals available and spends time on packages for steam etc. I don't see much reason for anyone to compete for the limited demand for this old games currency.
---
Instead most RMT seems to be people quitting and getting value for their time spent. 
---
What I find ludicrously goofy is the fact that in these screenshots someone is revealing a slew of details for an operation. That's not an RMT empire, that's stupid people cashing in stupid ways. This is not how you operate when you need to feed your daughter from this stuff. 
---
That being said, funny thread
---
Thanks :D
---
Holy fuck.
---
ZonedOut is recruiting.
---
It isn't working for me
---
I have all my toons in one corp at the moment with 100% tax...this way all my mission running goes into the corp wallet, which is where I keep my isk all time.
---
God you make it sound so easy.  Like you must have 10 years of marriage and a mortgage and 4 kids of your own.
---
I've heard there's gonna be a really good presentation at 12 on Sunday
---
You cant use that for cargo contracts
---
Quadglavians.
---
I meant in terms of referring to Asia instead if China
---
Sheep shagger
---
FIRE?
---
You're absolutely correct, but players abuse that mechanic (which I honestly can't blame) and also decide to outblob a lot of incoming content to their systems. I suppose it's just as jin'taan says though, all fun and games until it's your space being invaded.
---
Is this from some Blood Raiders?
---
Nope
---
Sniper?
---
Makes one wonder if we all will move to SC one day sperg out there :thonking:
---
Nope try again Welshman
---
RASAAAAAAA
---
Getting closer
---
Jack?
---
No
---
Nori
---
No fuck off, we came in T1cruiser because "we wont drop supers in LXQ"  
---
And than retards like Arqui drop supers anyway, (in a fucking bad way lmao)  
---
So fuck off, you wanted to become this empire building alliance, now deal with the consequences
---
I’ll see if I can retrieve it.
---
No you suck at guessing
---
Luke?
---
Pretty sure you cant even use large guns as an alpha clone, meaning none of the ship bonuses to DPS apply to your weapon systems.
---
Go join a nullsec group and do anomalies in a vexor navy or myrmidon
---
Hopefully it keeps trending this way
---
Reconsider the Dominix!
---
No guns needed. Swarm them with drones or snipe them with sentries! Edit: OK no sentries as alpha, sorry
---
Always the right tools at hand with awesome bonus to drones.
---
Extreme tankability vs rats -get your cap skills UP!
---
THINK LIKE ME OR YOU TOXIC REEEEE
---
Check our /r/evejobs for recruitment stuff. The rest I'll leave the thread up if anyone else wants to answer though.
---
You're never going to catch an astero with a firetail in the first place, even if you could break the tank of a pvp fit astero (you couldn't). And no, you can't speed tank light drones well at all, even hobgoblins will track you just fine if you are scrammed (which you will be)
---
Ah ok, never knew.
---
tfw you win but get fucked on the battle report
---
I thought that was terrible, even the name is circadian seeker, then they try to go take on a real one at a gate or something and get vaporized .
---
I've seen the clip I think OP is referencing. The problem was the guy couldn't kill the MTU in the time it took to MTU to tractor the cache. Which was pretty close to where the dying ship dropped it and as such was the first thing the MTU went for when it deployed.
---
Oh but Klaus, Init is majority EUTZ, so they didn't blob and we're cowards for batphoning. They HAD to batphone snuff every time they fought us, and they HAD to bring in their supercaps when snuff wasn't around to be batphoned anymore. It's just them evening the odds up a bit.
---
Read the comment above mine for context
---
I hope you all come back with glorious news of major updates.
---
I just play a different game. There's a reason EVE is dying.
---
This
---
I mean, Jesus, Tiana is one of the most well known support FCs in the game. Almost everyone I know has her personally blued. She did amazing work keeping the peace between the lowsec incursion runners while they cornered the flow of Revenant BPCs, acting as a translator, even while multiple groups were actively at war with each other.
---
Hope you get blue balled to death n die from boredom. Thats what horde and every other nullsec blob shitlord entity deserves.
---
I literaly lamo this idk but it seems true
---
What time will the store and stuff open?  Will all that open at 3pm?
---
Depends on the level of activities. I hardly changed my behavior at all during the blackout.
---
Instead of ratting in more expensive ships I mined in cheap procurers with pvp fits. Abyssal PVE was virtually unchanged (if not easier) and PvP was slightly more annoying (harder to find targets).
---
As far as I could tell the main people who stayed away during the blackout were capital pilots. Since I could care less about capitals it didn't really bother me. And there were plenty of people in my alliance still flying around doing stuff.
---
Frankly the drifters were more annoying than the blackout imo.
---
That being said, I didn't see much *advantage* to it. The same people that hunted in our space were still hunting there and didn't seem to have dramatically more success than before. It confused a lot of new players to some extent but didn't make them any more likely to be ganked...most of them aren't looking at local anyway and/or can't react fast enough for it to make a difference.
---
Most importantly, I wasn't having *more fun* during the blackout. It didn't really do much to enhance any sort of gameplay I enjoy. And it didn't really hurt those activities either. In that sense it was a failure.
---
Dust, but done right? Care to elaborate. I don’t think I’ve tried planetside.
---
All fights are pre arranged it just depends what side of the arrangement ur own the delivering or receiving and those terms are subjected to change especially if theirs a force recon in system
---
I used to live and stage out of curse. Loved the fights I used to get there - now it’s just frat mission runners docking up as soon as a neutral enters system.
---
Did the Lord just refer to himself in the third person?
---
it's because botters used alpha gilas with med drones
---
They're still on par with other rating cruisers tho. Not in a league of their own like before, but still viable.
---
All dps on the thingy.
---
It would be super cool if there was some way for alliance leadership types to be able to track this in a manner that doesn't take away from the myriad other tasks alliance leadership folks have to perform.  I don't think that's an easy thing for CCP to do.  I think it's pretty tough for alliance leadership of any alliance size to really know definitively someone is botting or RMTing.  I'm sure we have both in TEST and we certainly have kicked or punished those who do so, but being able to detect large numbers of those who offend is profoundly challenging.  
---
Also the people who bring to our attention a potential botter typically have the reasons listed below as evidence (including but not limited to): 
---
* the character warped to a citadel when a hostile entered local
---
* the character has a lot of money
---
* the character flies AFK ships to make money and doesn't respond to convos in game
---
* the character is chinese (no, seriously, I've had someone say this)
---
* the character comes from a group that was suspected of botting
---
And there are so many reasons that are unverifiable and/or do not give you sufficient information to be able to make a decision based on fact.  
---
It's pretty lame not being able to police this kind of stuff effectively but you can only realistically do so much and we have to defer to CCP on a number of these cases.
---
I think it's a great idea! I can't give much valuable insight as I am not a super active player. But I was actually thinking of doing something similar for a project I will be having in an upcoming semester. Interested to see what people say!!
---
Hey check this out.... maybe they should limit fucking rorquals and citadels.... omg ccp devs sooo overworked on npe; they’ll never figure out where the balance issues are...
