I used to live and stage out of curse. Loved the fights I used to get there - now it’s just frat mission runners docking up as soon as a neutral enters system.

---
---
Did the Lord just refer to himself in the third person?
---
it's because botters used alpha gilas with med drones
---
They're still on par with other rating cruisers tho. Not in a league of their own like before, but still viable.

All dps on the thingy.

It would be super cool if there was some way for alliance leadership types to be able to track this in a manner that doesn't take away from the myriad other tasks alliance leadership folks have to perform.  I don't think that's an easy thing for CCP to do.  I think it's pretty tough for alliance leadership of any alliance size to really know definitively someone is botting or RMTing.  I'm sure we have both in TEST and we certainly have kicked or punished those who do so, but being able to detect large numbers of those who offend is profoundly challenging.  
---

---
Also the people who bring to our attention a potential botter typically have the reasons listed below as evidence (including but not limited to): 
---
* the character warped to a citadel when a hostile entered local
---
* the character has a lot of money
---
* the character flies AFK ships to make money and doesn't respond to convos in game
---
* the character is chinese (no, seriously, I've had someone say this)
---
* the character comes from a group that was suspected of botting
---
And there are so many reasons that are unverifiable and/or do not give you sufficient information to be able to make a decision based on fact.  
---
It's pretty lame not being able to police this kind of stuff effectively but you can only realistically do so much and we have to defer to CCP on a number of these cases.
---
I think it's a great idea! I can't give much valuable insight as I am not a super active player. But I was actually thinking of doing something similar for a project I will be having in an upcoming semester. Interested to see what people say!!
---
Hey check this out.... maybe they should limit fucking rorquals and citadels.... omg ccp devs sooo overworked on npe; they’ll never figure out where the balance issues are...
---
I mean C5/6s are always going to be more profitable but have much higher risk due to how rolling statics works. 
---
TBH I’m keen to try solo C5s but it’s a big risk.
---
Cause many new players come in here, dump a bunch of cash into something they don't understand, then promptly lose it and quit the game. If you have a reason or goal, then that's great, if not then its just a lossmail waiting to happen.
---
Quite a lot actually. How many things in game are half-done and not doing anything for it?
---
You're too kind :blush:
---
No, please. I'd rather not....
---
In all of "eve offline" opinions. That game have horrible advertisement and possibly plagiarize eveonline.
---
I really don't know if it is on propose, but here in China there is a advertorial say they are cooperator of Michel Mayor ...without photoshoped eve symbol on background picture.
---
All the holes are a risk, doesn't matter the class truthfully. Logistics demand a kspace connection and C3/4s are sought after for that, and high class groups lean heavily on their kspace logistic efforts. If you're fielding a marauder to solo sites, for me, the risk is all the same. C6 is quite different ofc.
---
Edit: I'll add that if you fully explore your chain (to eol or even verged holes, say, which are still worth a peek in), and have a scout or more available--in sabre would be nice--to monitor activity, that really minimizes the risk. It saved my ass many times.

I used to keep my three Rorqs mining, pull my excavators, put out T2s...ready to pop cyno if trouble arrived...
---
After blackout and cyno changes...who cares...Classic WoW has me hooked again for the next 15 years.
---
how did it go?
---
Photoshop?
---
If you have a pub crawl ticket I'd be willing to buy that from you and I'll fed ex your swag.
---
The hell you on about 200m per jump?
---
This is why we need serenity, keep the problem quarantined
---
I have two instances, they use up a lot of my CPU!
---
Can't seem to find good info on this;
---
Anyone here know a lot about moon belts? Specifically looking for information on the size and dispersion of the belt and whether it is affected by ore volume.
---
How big is a default moon chunk belt? 150km x 150km? If the size is not affected by the length of the moon cycle (volume), does that mean the density of the asteroids in the belt will be higher or will there just be more asteroids?
---
Dude, you are really fucking retarded.  
---
  
---
I said "you can hire chinese sweatshop to solve captchas".
---
level 4 missions have a chance to be a "burner mission". just a short fight with a very specific npc.
---
it's basically "here's a single npc on steroids, we've restricted what ships you can use. have fun". it's short, violent, and pays pretty well.
---
why? i enjoy eve's fire and forget nature.
---
if i wanted twitch based fps content - i'd go and play one. i don't, that's why i play eve.
---
all you're doing is wanting to add dumb shit for no reason.
---
Ok then bring back serenity so they don’t affect us.
---
OK, thanks!
---
I imagine that high-sec mining pays very poorly?
---
&gt; I imagine that high-sec mining pays very poorly?
---
yeah, pretty much. it's not great.
---
It's F2P on steam.  I wouldn't call it Dust done right, but it is a decent fps
---
And this is the casual racism I mentioned earlier.
---
Idiot. How the fuck am I supposed to get cunt net from suspect baiting when all i do is pop botters mtus and not real players who fight back? I kill tons of mtus with no reaction to 2 baited ships.
---
Then play and don’t complain that you dislike the game played the intended way
---
Is the word “Serenity” racist?
---
To be clear this isn't my fight, but I have seen many a gank squad turn tail if the defense fleet is overwhelming.
---
They don't want to fight, even if they are PvPers, because they don't want to encourage hunters in their territory, most would rather go hunt then be ganked to fill their PvP experience. 
---
One can enjoy doing risky things with risky people, but don't always want that risk in their home. 
---
It seems everyone wants the other guy to play their victim vOv
---
The bots hog the conduits so the players can’t play. Sure i can steal all the loot and pop mtus, but it’s not https://zkillboard.com/kill/79496092/ or https://zkillboard.com/kill/79504247/.
---
Access and capability are two different things. Omega grants you access to all ships.

You'll have to do some serious workouts to make up for last weeks shower. You'll never come across as a gamer  at this rate, everyone will just wonder who the pleasantly smelling bum is.
---
It still increases the safety for nullsec groups for farming them, for one that result in a fight, many will be done without problem...
---
I still have hope left, yeah. But for Vegas, I'm just hoping that they announce/show some tournament tooling progress, that might hint at continued support.
---
Its the Rorqual's ship maintenance bay which is limited to industrial ships, the Orca is only limited by volume (it can store anything up to and including battlecruisers). Also the only thing allowed in the cargohold of stored ships is ammo (anything  in the 'charges' market group).
---
Players in pods can indeed take out fully fitted ships, players in ships can 'swap' their ship with one in the Orca.
---
https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/25/overwatch-hacker-seoul-jail-time/
---
Because they can't bring titans that far easily, and without titans why undock?
---
I believe exploration is a fun and rewarding activity. Escaping high-sec and diving through a wormhole to see where in null it takes you, a shit ton of relic sites in some deep water system that hasn't been toughed in days. the vast alone and empty feeling you get trekking though deep null with almost no one in local. And all that $$$ you'll make. Just an idea if you ever decide to see what other space than high-sec is like.
---
We dont drop Supers if you are not goons
---
my expectations are that they copy paste the PS3 game onto PC as its a UE3 based game.
---
j
---
AT will be on the CCP phone game from now - like you have phone right?
---
So you keep saying. Do they sell broken records at your nearest trade hub?
---
They do pay their employees (obviously) however since people pay for most skins (through plex which has to be purchased with money), skins generate revenue. That revenue more than covers the cost of production. 
---
So on a net basis, they don’t pay for skins. Skins pay for other things they do that don’t directly generate revenue.
---
Soul bound ships and modules?
---
Do you work for ccp, was blackout or cyno changes your idea?
---
You seem butthurt.
---
The who is threatened where?
---
its so long i thought its the video already
---
Like honestly how many of those titans related to :           
---
* blackout         
---
* capital fights (totally unrelated to blackout)       
---
* fleet invites during undocking ( again not related to blackout)          
---
Blackout had effect on people ratting and people hunting them - the rest of kills not relate to blackout at all.
---
Probably because the cyno changes mean there are far less titans out in space at any given time unless they have support with them/on standby.  Of course, I'm sure CCREEEE reads it to mean reverting blackout made titans inherently super safe now.
---
Good bot
---
I actually like the bot, because it reminds us how superior the SI system is.
---
I expect one, maybe 2 new mobile announcements targetting Korea, shield slaves again, and announcing a fourth failed reboot of DUST.
---
Also nervous, OP.  (Side note:  isn't it nice to be so invested in something that a business decision or two can rock your world?)  I subscribe through payment, not isk-to-Plex, for all my accounts, so I can understand that whatever decisions CCP has made that they'll (hopefully) unveil during a tumultuous time will be made for the sake of capital.  Hopefully the data they collect gears decisions that support the clients who support them financially.  We shall see.
---
That's not true, but not sure if you care.
---
A dyslexic person selling novel editing services on Fiverr would make more than per hour than a highsec miner.
---
How many of those kills during the blackout were related to blackout actually happening ?           
---
Unless you count into blackout kills that were happening during big fights and dumb people dying to fleet invites - i don't have to say how dumb this assumption would be.           
---
The real comparison should be ratting titans kills during blackout - to ratting titan kills **pre blackout**.           
---
Blackout made a lot of people quit and the cyno changes screwed the the situation even more ... much more than the blackout itself.        
---
**Like dread bombs became much, much less frequent after the cyno changes**
---
We lost 2 Titans and I would attribute blackout to it.
---
You fucking idiot its not low sec its France. LEARN FUCKING GEOGRAPHY
---
Well they care enough to blob their way through Aridia Moons, with more Titans in fleets than LSH has IRL-Members lol
---
Anyone have good wormhole names?
---
I am nomading with my orca and need ideas.
---
My first c3 was Avacado, my current system is Jehuty.
---
What are your suggestions?
---
have my children. wow.   
---
i could not agree more with that statement, there are whole corps/alliances depending on the vegas announcements to keep playing. If ccp turns a blind eye and goes "we will focus on npe only" there will be huge drop in actual players. Then people will enjoy their 25k players, but the game will be more dead than ever.
---
Here's what you do.  Sign up for the mailing list "Info Spam" (I will correct that if it is wrong).  Join the channel "CAS Combat Guild".  Talk to some guys there.  Go on one roam.  You don't have to fly anything fancy, I fly an Atron or some form of logi.  Thoraxes and Vexors are fun too but usually they run a fleet comp for roams.  After that highsec will be mostly boring for you.  I am one of the biggest carebears in Eve and I have gotten into nullsec and WH space as a result.  Hisec is fine but getting a few friends in frigates or destroyers and lowering your security status in lowsec is the bee's knees.  Fly dangerously!
---
I came back to EvE for blackout, I left as soon as they removed it. Farm simulator isnt what I want
---
&gt;Go play something else you asshole.
---
Sounds like he already does
---
You might get your wish some day soon, when *everyone* is playing something else.
---
haha, man you're not making any point by throwing in a random analogy. This isn't a concert, this is a game where changes needs to happen. Last 3 years were mostly in favor of empire building and look where we are now? I still think what I mentionned above is true : rorquals were a big fucking mistake, injectors even more of a mistake and XL citadels are just the icing on the cake. If CCP doesn't adress these problems real quick, Eve won't be there for much longer.
---
Well if we leave, the remaining 20-25k logins (of max. 5k real players) will have what they wanted, a FarmVille-Haven with no "edgy PvPers" harassing them during "empire building".
---
Every now and then Horde or Brave will announce some "Thunderdomes" for staged PvP and Sov-Null-Inhabitants will logout their Mains in Rorquals and login their quickly injector-fatfingered "PvP"-Alts
---
How do you know it was Arqui?
---
Just want CCP to give us decent AT ships.  T2 Orthrus pleez?
---
you can not take level 4s as an Alpha, but you can run them if someone opens them for you - so

wow, ad hominem from the 1st post folowed up in every other post of you. You seem very adult to me.
---
Can you tell us where this bad PvP touched you? Did they kill you in an unfair way because you were just afk?
---
I don't disagree with you, there's a lot of small changes that could improve the state of the game but between CCP trying to stay afloat and people arguing against any sort of rebalance cause it threatens their crabbing playstyle.. I don't think we're there yet :(
---
[deleted]
---
Hahahahah dude... *everything a business does is ostensibly for the purpose of making money*. Making SKINs isn't unique in this way. By your logic, any profitable company "doesn't pay for" anything.
---
The art department's project is SKINs. A balance team's product is a game that isn't shit. Right now we need the latter a lot more than the former.
---
Mr dave stark of karmafleet, any kind of roadmap that would actually help the game would nerf your alliance and when your alliance gets nerfed they cry, when they cry they unsub thousands of useless afk accounts and ccp takes it back. It takes a great deal of audacity, to be part of the biggest alliance which is at least double the numbers of the second and claiming to be annoyed by the current state of the game.
---
&gt; Limit the amount of resources available in a given area per time so that, like, you know, players no longer prefer to stack up in a single region where their super umbrella can cover them all while they play farm simulator online?
---
Yeah. Current anomaly system supplying enough isk/minerals for thousands of pilots to clump up in 1 region is really bad.
---
Only thing they can really do is make war/PvP as profitable as PvE with a cap somewhere so that it's not a competition of who got the stronger N+1 game.
---
Hard to do that though
---
thx for sharing
---
none.
---
fuck FPS
---
I don't blame people for playing the meta, I also have capital/sc alts despite not liking this gameplay at all. But I'm quite realistic about it, even though we're forced to play this meta as efficiently as possible, it is boring as fuck and it slowly drives content creators away from the game. 
---
(Btw don't try to understand Logan, he's nuts!)
---
This is pure bullshit. We know from the CSM minutes that CCP's claim that the majority of paying players and plex buying players are in High Sec was based on 100% incorrect data (According to how they were interperating the data every member of the CSM was listed as a high sec player. Some hadnt been to High Sec in monthsvl but were still being counted as High Sec players because they had an alt in Jita.)
---
This is something CCP acknowledged was wrong  and yet you still try and use it as the basis for your argument?
---
Yeah, but those cases should be pretty rare and easy to investigate/clear.  A braindead monkey could look at the 100% tax RMT corps and figure out what's going on in about 10 seconds.  They should still be automatically flagged for review.
---
I heard dumb captcha ideas were "half a decade old" when I started playing a decade ago. It's safe to say that Captcha idea is as old as idea of "Eve is ded"
---
To be far, it seems like most players don't undock, so maybe it really is a change to boost player retention lol
---
I expect Skins. And vague promises.  
---
Also Trig dreads will be announced, with components that have to be farmed from Abyssals, in small quantities. Or, can be bought with Plex.
---
https://twitter.com/onlydopamine/status/1186598842902499328?s=09
---
CCP Dopamine advised no Nova at Vegas this year
---
I like discussing things. I actuall do that compared to guys like the guy I replied to.
---
 Do you really think that this is part of a discussion:
---
\&gt; game's fucking dead, ccp doesnt give a rat shit anymore. unsub and stop giving those greedy fucks your money
---
If your part of a nul block then in game contracts or discord marketplace, if your not check contracts in the region you want the capital, make sure you can dock before purchase if its a player owned structure.
---
So your idea to save the game is to fuck over anyone who doesnt play it the way you want it to be played?
---
We already tried that. Blackout happened already and CCP learned that balancing a MMO around Huters at the expense of every other game type will kill the game inside of the year.
---
How about CCP BALANCES the game instead of repeatedly trying to destroybit by making iy fun for only PvP hunters?
---
To what porpoise?
---
can confirm, southern France is pretty much Lowsec, especially around Marseille ;)
---
So instead you want the remainig 25k people to leave as CCP balances the fun out of every non PvP waybtp playbthe game.
---
Thats smart.
---
It depends what you do. Neutral Hunters are a good start bombers/recons/dics etc. If you want to use it to make money gear it towards that Gila/Rattlesnake or if you want a spy train it towards the doctrines of your target etc
---
Ehhhhhh this needs to establish more correlation with blackout and deaths than just counting numbers on excel.
---
Like we want to trim those super/titan numbers? don't we?    
---
Many big brawls started with this single guy tackled.       
---
Quite often you tackle this guy with very small force so he have time to call for help
---
Especially blackout vs post cyno change era ...
---
Sorry you have to put effort into hunting... try Fortnite or something, I don’t believe you have to do much to acquire kills in those games.
---
Right now they are claiming that both of their "dev teams" are focused exclusively on NPE.
---
Personally, i believe they are just telling us that while their artists are going to night school to learn stackless python. Then, once the art guys get their new course completion certificates and are rechristened as lead programmers, we will start seeing some very basic code changes ingame beyond the simple database cherrypicking that has been happening for the last 6 months.
---
Thats how shit I formation gets spread though, put more effort into it.
---
I agree. Blackout 100% proved that balancing Eve around the wants of a small % of the playerbase will kill the game. And yet you still call for CCP to do it. 
---
PvP is a PART of Eve basic mechanics but its not the core. The needs of the PvP'ers needs to be properly balamced against the needs of the Non-PvP'ers. CCP have yet to even attempt to do this. 
---
You claim you want balance but for months/years  CCP has done nothing but nerf Caps as a playstyle (With the PvP'ers on r/eve celebrating every buff to their playstyle along the way wvwn ones we now know will kill the gane if left in place.)  and yet its still not enough for PvP'ers.
---
Hopefully CCP has seen how badly they misjudged the ACTUAL playerbase who were turned away from playing during the Blackout and instead try and make the game fun for ALL play styles not just the vocal PvP salt mills on this sub.
---
i mean, there is nothing special about it. this has probably been used as the line spaceship model in any space fiction universe. including eve, i think this resembles one of the caldari fighter designs. i know it's standard practice in industry to use similar designs, but why prefer this over the unique hulls we already have?
---
Well if we go for realism, might as well do away with slots, make all ships have multiple different weapon types and max engagement ranges that would put current carriers to shame. Why should a ceptor only reach about a third of the velocity of real world spacecraft, that can reach upwards of 30km/s? Let's have ceptors go 250k/s, battleships firing with railguns at 3-4000km, missiles that chase you between celestials. How about no? This is a game mostly revolving around player interaction, not a realistic space combat sim.
---
Ahh I forgot about that. Munins are pretty fast tho, idk if most things could hit.
---
you are completely missing the point here and I'm far too lazy to explain this shit...
---
30 km/s is 149.1290862 furlongs/s
---
4000 km is 2.350452464e+06 smoots +/- 1 ear
---
^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)
---
Korean localization will not increase player numbers - as if in CCP eyes this could bring new players we would have Spanish and French localization years ago.
---
Give me a single count to caps that can deal with a Cap fleet in equal numbers? 
---
Bombers can't do it, even with command destroyers you ignoring the presence of caps rather then to "deal" with them, dreads sorta deal with carriers but really there not all that favored along with being caps themselves. 
---
Part of the balance problem is literally that if you have a 200 dudes and go into a known fight against 100 dudes, and you blind pick titans + supers + faxes they can't really pick anything to count this.
---
Sorry you have to put effort into clicking once every 50mins with your 5 Rorq and clicking the cyno to summon 45 titans if a T2 frigate shows up. Typical retarded goons
---
You can mine the same ores in HS that you can in Null, but not as much of it, and even then only via moon mining - which means you would have to find a corp with the stations in place.
---
And yes, there are many thousands of players who live exclusively in highsec doing nothing but endless pve missions/mining/explo.
---
&gt; a success depending on how CCP implement it 
---
I got a really bad feeling about this :-D
---
tbh I don't have a real solution to the already anchored citadels. Although I have no good feelings for goons, I have to admit that it would be unfair to just delete a few hundred citas....
---
Maybe there could be some kind of stacking penalty, like: every citadel too much extends the weekly vulnerability window by 2 hours and reduces a citadels hitpoints by 10%
---
that would make wiping the majority of them easy for an attacker, but the owner could still put them down or leave them where they are.
---
In the end I think that the big alliances like goons and test had such an overwhelming advantage over the past few years that they can't really complain
---
Yes?
---
What is snuffed out? Sry no nativ speaker and New to New Eden
---
what vexor hulls got was more of a texture update than a redesign  
---
granted, texture update cranked up to 4000 but it's still the same idea as the old design
---
&gt;CCP, for the love of Bob, do something. Anything.
---
OP in two days:
---
CCP WHY YOU DO THIS OH GOD OH NO
---
Then EVE can finally be a primarily PvE game
---
Neither. The project was started during blackout, because it was potentially forever. Easier to mine moons in aridia (time and effort) where drones can't be bombed.  Pretty cut and dry.
---
It's honestly hard to tell whether you do this unironically or for shits and giggles and I'm not sure which is more hysterical.
---
Big announcement of the event will be something that takes years to fully impliment. Citadels still not fully pushing out a POS as of yet.
---
Ah so some of the guys blue with the INIT. blob over there gotchya
---
I'm new...can you explain why having those three tabs and no "tactical overlay" is a bad thing?
---
The umbrella and the then 55k Imperium says no
---
Snuff died the day cyno changes happened.
---
First comment : the only "swear word" is stupid and it isn't directed ar toi
---
Second comment : "fucking" also not directed at you.
---
Where's the ratio you're talking about O_O
---
Reading the comments on this post, i literally must be the only player that enjoys logging in eve and playing even in its given state.
---
There’s now more people who value gaming experience. Also, a lot of these recruiters will now also be people playing games. Don’t underestimate that.
---
The US Army was using cumbersome controls for some of their features, and they needed to retrain their people to teach them how to use the ‘new technique’. Some of the people they gave that to were gamers. Guys who literally grew up holding a controller in their hand. “Oh, you mean like this?” proceeds to toggle the thing as if they had been doing it all their life.
---
Gaming experience may give you better hand/eye coordination, cooperation, strategic thinking, taking executive decisions \[in a game things happen because *you* make them happen, you’re the one with agency.
---
Gaming is nothing to sneer at. You couldn’t say that 20 years ago. Today there’s nothing niche about gaming. This century is the era of gaming.
---
Thank you for the replies! Would you suggest possibly going for one of the T3C's?
---
To be fair, frigates (kestrel for me) were the first ships most people started to fly - excluding injected titans/rorquals. While other hulls destroyer and above also are iconic. The kestrel will always have that sweet spot in L1 missions for me and probably others too.
---
&gt;Zippo
---
You are missing the point.  1au is something like 1.496e+8 km.  
---
Scale that down some to say 3000-10000km.
---
8 km is 4700.904928 smoots +/- 1 ear
---
10000 km is 1.05702341e-09 light years
---
And fight with what? Anything hunting you is going to wreck an exploration fit astero. Anything beyond two inertial stabs is a waste since you can get sub two second align time with agility skills.
---
Hel, 20b fit, run Rock Havens avg tick 90 after corp taxes
---
The other redesign still kept a some feeling of "deja vu" toward the ship. (Maybe I'm wrong) You could recognise the old ship from the new hull quite easily.
---
It is already, look who is beyond untouchable atm, PvE-Powerhouses.
---
Marginal result at best.
---
It won't lead to major brawls, or significant super killmails.
---
What you said :

Hurrrrrr. I want to play Farmville but I dont have Facebook. PVP is for loosers to many butons.  
---
DROPED THE MIC MIKE
---
Ccp find some players bring em back
---
Having HP to tank is useless if you have no offensive capabilities. DCS is pointless.
---
no one cried when i could threaten miners all day with my 2 month old rifter pilot... the lengths i have to go through now isn't proportional anymroe for the hunter. that's why so many left.
---
Elo "scouted" the FC chat for me. Twice, actually ;)
---
Marauders were buffed this month.
---
Imagine those 10,000 new players spreading across the unverse because of resource scarcity. Problem solved.
---
Yonis yonis yonis you can still die badly with idiots outside of snuff it's not the end of your shitposter days
---
The point was that grids that size would not be good or fun gameplay. The point still stands.
---
Warp speed? .. come on man..
---
Excellent, more SP! I love it!!!
---
Can't think of a decent reply, better strawman.
---
aren't many ratting dreads to be found in NS ;)
---
The take is still a caricature though
---
Lots of people die every day, according to zkill. I can't speak to that any more than that. I've spent a grand total of 1 or 2 hours in delve in the last year or two.
---
Also it gives nothing to get excited about. If you look at many wildly popular games, the release roadmaps and upcoming features and players spend months talking about them, planning for them and getting excited. 
---
EvE is an easy game to leave right now because you often see nothing new coming down the pipeline, and aren't talking/planning with your friends about the future.
---
What about the new Diablo 4 ?
---
It's understandable that you don't recognize it and I like your admission.
---
"verder kijken dan je neus lang is". look it up, enjoy.
---
who cares lol, fuck mobile games
---
So nothing on a systemic level changing. But instead it makes sense to go lord up some more space?
---
Hibber jib bet
---
about damn time!
---
Fuck yes. I'm still sitting on hundreds of claws haha.
---
What a terrible idea
---
Pardon? Are you referencing scarcity?
---
People have invested literal years into this game, and it is fundamentally changing for the worse.
---
when you want to reply to someone -&gt; use "reply" under their comment. How am i suppose to know you're replying to this guy when i get a notification from reddit saying somebody answered my comm?
---
Also being hung over and politely smacktalking your ingame enemies in RL.
---
Was hauling cargo
---
in a couple of years if the title takes off, where likely gonna be happy it's not linked to TQ as it would make the PC gaming session secondary to the mobile session, it would mean a lot of changes to TQ to please mobile customers given the involvement of a Chinese developer expect it to be aimed at a completely different customer base then the western audience ( so expect a lot of pay to win ).
---
Don't worry, it wasn't a serious comment anyway
---
I'm in init and worked hard to get into my own first titan last year myself.
---
Things are still ridiculous. 
---
People don't use them often in serious manner (outside of homedef dunks) because there is no reason to with everyone blue and/or turteling. 
---
There are only 2 sides you possibly could use your titans regularly in, both don't. And that has nothing to do with the diminishing returns on FAX.
---
Rip entosis cancer claws coming back
---
How about you unblue the alliance "Goonswarm Federation"
---
My co-pilot does exactly the same. Just at the top of my case.
---
I remember enjoying the storyline of Earth &amp; Beyond back in its early days. But that was a much smaller sandbox than Eve Online.
---
Going to the broken TaDa-O gate for the 1st time was quite eerie.
---
I'll get right on making that diplomatic decision.
---
Its not that I hate goons. In fact I admire the fact that goons are home to so many players. And as you say, that should absolutely be respected.
---
The issue is that unfortunately CSM is represented almost entirely by goons, and there have been a lot of changes the last couple years that benefit goons and hurt others.
---
There is no lowsec representation, no wormhole representation, and little representation from highsec either.
---
Null is a massive part of the game, and Goons are a large chunk of the playerbase, but they aren't the entirety of it
---
http://evepraisal.com/ https://evemarketer.com/ just remember alot of skins never sell so ppl use them to scam so the price can be way off, look at sell/day etc
---
The moa redesign was completely different, completely unrecognisable
---
Sounds like you can’t afford to fly a capital
---
Send them to me then, jesus.
---
No but eve echoes is?  I literally just saw it.
---
I can afford to fly one. I just don't see why essentially taxing small groups for using them is helpful to anyone
---
Well, frankly it's difficult to tone down things that large alliances do at an industrious scale without hurting smaller ones. I say that as the exec of a small alliance too.
---
Right now, I'm fairly happy with everyone on CSM except Olmeca. I'd rather have people that are active in the community and actually know what they're doing than people who are loud and have no clue. My problem with it arises with the fact that CCP uses it like a sample group these days as opposed to a group of people that have studied and played the game for a decade providing valuable input.
---
&gt; Autopilot is a sin that will get you ganked as well :)
---
I'm not sure why they haven't either made it warp to 0 or simply removed it from the game. It's purely there as a newbie trap as far as I can tell.
---
I'm guessing that is low hanging fruit requiring only a few tweaks to the DB and they felt like they had to start showing balance changes after "Balance Changes: 1 item"
---
Hoping that this weekend will follow with other changes as well.
---
It’s got its utility that comes with a healthy amount of risk. It should never be warp to 0
---
Yeah, I cant find much info for the Erebus and Nyx skins...
---
&gt;Sorry you have to put effort into clicking once every 50mins with your 5 Rorq and clicking the cyno to summon 45 titans if a T2 frigate shows up.
---
Funny you say that because Blackout changed **absolutely Nothing** about Capital Farmville Online ...
---
Almost like the blackout people never really cared about Rorquals or Superratting in the first place 
---
&gt;Typical retarded goons
---
Goons are at fault for everything these days 
---
I mean how dare they play and organize in big groups in the only space in Eve  that is about big groups ... 
---
And how dare they use the game mechanics CCP gave them for their advantage...
---
Good luck controlling that interface with a touchscreen. Echoes was clearly built for touch.
---
Do you want the system we rat in as well?:)
---
Is there a way to connect to Eve Online with a phone and activate the log in bonuses ? Asking because will be without pc during the whole [halloween week](https://www.eveonline.com/now/halloween-horrors). Thanks a lot for your answers.
---
What happened to BR? Used to be activity.
---
Hope you have a few lying around, price is about to be sky high.
---
How long do T2 frigs take to build?
---
Ok fair enough but the point I'm making is that these changes are a lot easier to make, understand the impact of, re-tweak and expect buy-in from the players than something like ... introducing ship likes, removing timers/tether from low power Citadels, etc etc
---
Star Citizen ships are so bland, they look like every other standard scifi setting out there. I mean there are definitely some cool ones but on average I'm pretty surprised people like them so much.
---
You are walking a fine line between dope and OP.
---
That’s a heavy fighter
---
Snuff was the direct cause of many lowsec groups leaving the CalGal warzone or the outright death of then. USTZ and non-Russian EUTZ Calmil was completely pushed out, for example. NoHa was nuked off the map. Then they went after Galmil cause there was no Calmil to dunk on. The minamarr zone hasn't been great either due to Snuff interference. 
---
Sure, Snuff wasn't going to bother with the shitty astras here and there but if you wanted to have any decent presence (Fortizar, literally any kind of cap use) you became a target. 
---
Snuff actually dying (which is still a high likelihood of BS as it's tradition to shitpost snuff is dying threads) would open up the CalGal warzone to mid-sized entities that could fight Pen is Out.
---
Imagine being mad at anything ccp does and assuming its their end game. You probably frown while jerking off too.
---
Eww
---
Crits look violently wobbly.
---
Looks nice tbh.
---
What a hoe
---
Day or two depending on bpc
---
With resource scarcity, there wouldnt *be* 10,000 new players.
---
More people are interested in pve than pvp.
---
This is good.  
---
Weapon ranges = theatre size.
---
Excuse me, I will have you refrain from commenting on what my nose may or may not look like.
---
ur wrong
---
Jokes aside realy like the ability to adjust skills from mobile. :)
---
So the light weight easy to kill interceptor does its job and intercepts, get initial tackle and the supporting heavier tackle lands and takes over as the inty either dies or has to gtfo. Seems balanced to me.
---
For ratting, this would make it so you can roll into someone, and instantly warp your fleet on top of them before anything shows up on dscan or probe scanner, without any effort. You wouldn't need to be dscanning around and getting a good warpin, there would be no counterplay, you'd just roll your static and have a Taranis ready to go, and then any ratters you saw would be dead.
---
But this would also mess up exploration and gas mining, making it extremely easy to hunt down new players trying to make some isk in j-space. Currently it requires some effort to camp sites, and that is good. With this, you could just see something on dscan, not worry about bringing something cloaky, warping to a ping and then warping down, etc, you'd just warp right on top of the heron, and then its dead.
---
This is the internet, I do what I want.
---
Amen brotha
---
Kain Tarr gave us the entire history of genesis one night, so I feel confident I am qualified to comment:
---
Context, as some nerds seem to not know whats up:
---
Back in the long before, No Forks and White Sky contacted DHSJ to come shoot SFQL dudes and break their toys. DHSJ, loving fites and shooting SFQL, said yes. This has started a campaign of war in Genesis against SFQL and Exxitium. 
---
Prelude:
---
Over the last few weeks the rust bois have been reinforcing SFQL structures, there's been some wins some loses, some welps on both sides. All in all good fun. Two days prior, 2 valuable structures came out of hull timers. The rust bois, expecting a heavy form up from the Shooty bois, admittedly over formed, as they welped in a similar situation not long before (always take fights). Rust got blueballed as shooty couldn't form enough. So the two structures went down. There was much shit talk to be had about the blue balls. Forks dropped structures in their place, and were protected until anchored.
---
AAR:
---
Yesterday, DHSJ formed up our classic typhoon fleet for an armour timer in their home system. Our numbers were not good, and not much logi (big oof). SFQL, being the absolute lads, dogpiled our guards with 12 vexors, total value 1m isk. It was fun, and kinda worrying until we saw the t1 drones. Fun shit. They want to fight. 
---
Pred, wanting a real fight because... well... no fight is cause for mutiny, Reinforced another structure on grid with their home fort. Then warped to a ping off their fort to taunt them. We could see a buzz of activity, and more than our numbers docked in their fort. Rusty's new structures were going vulnerable soon (yes please). Then, a good fleet undocks, titan lands and bridges. Off to Menai we go!
---
In menai, we warp to the structure and engage the sub caps. Shooty has 1 dread on field and a good assortment of Bhaals (classic shooty bois). Pred, dying for an escalation and some pay back, drops all dreads and fax. Immediate carnage. Chestnut, being an absolute lad drops his in return. One of our Moros tanks like cazy and catches reps the last seconds of life. Shooty concentrates fire on a fax and continues to hemorrhage dreads. Rusty typhoons pick apart the shooty bhaals that (seemingly) are primarying rusty dreads. The legendary moros finally goes down and we loose another fax (rip russians). 
---
All in all a gud fite. Props to Shooty bois and their slave driver, Chestnut, coming out in force. Props to the Russians with the fax saves. Props to Mr Mohawk himself for taking a fight on a chance.
---
Not anymore *bucko*.
---
&gt; Just hope this isn't our Diablo Immortal and it's the big announcement planned for Eve Vegas
---
What else do they have to announce?
---
On the other hand, they undid many bad changes.
---
Wrong, watch you probe scanner for new sigs. New Sig pops up you warp off. All I'm seeing from a bunch of you is uneducated crab tears.
---
huh sorry, if gaming experience is good to join army it's because if you play video games you are a terrorist duh
---
imagine cs 1.6 graffiti-like system in Eve. basically put whatever wherever. fuck
---
normies would do hello kitty kestrels &amp; avrse would put swastikas on supers
---
dream
---
You're literally asking for instanced PVE.
---
Probe scanner is usually about 30 seconds behind.
---
Test and Goons need to go to war with each other to save the game.
---
That might just be your brain lagging.
---
your absolutely right you didnt. Bad assumption on my part, sorry. I have had almost identical posts today asking if this was really the #1 thing CSM asked for &gt;_&lt;.
---
I think the truth is always somewhere in the middle. Saying that the changes we see, and will see werent influenced by CSM input is factually wrong. But it would also be wrong to say CSM asked for X so we get X.
---
yeah, i see that. I think its more that, they already have a team(s) tackling what they consider most pressing, so the balance team is looking for quick, easy wins here, this may not be critical, or huge impact, but its an easy win on a ship line thats literally not used right now.
---
Unless you can set up remote desktop access through your phone (ie, using your phone to control your computer at home), no.
---
Some of my side projects in eve also helped me a lot in landing a job as well.
---
If im hauling cargo on a weak and slow ship through highsec for 10 jumps i dont see the need to do that manualu
---
I’m watching the expanse atm , funny nano spray tech they have
---
Station manager I think to deploy one for your corp, be aware that having a upwell structure in space makes you war eligible.
---
No thanks.
---
As long as you can afford to lose it
---
I doubt it. How would the organizers prevent people from cheating and zooming out. Maybe a streamer only event?
---
I really need whatever drugs this guy is on.
---
&gt;My money says CCP's ear is a lot closer to the ground than we often give them credit for.
---
I agree. My chats with Dopamine and Hilmar at EDU this year were a real revelation for me. 
---
&gt; Do I expect sweeping changes, a non-vague roadmap, or other significant announcements? **Nope**. 
---
lol. After the rollback of Blackout, I have to agree with this as well.
---
Really? Why do you think so? On the contrary I find this story very successful and funny :)
---
I mean, its highsec what the worst tah could happen. Its not like i have a storage full of plex
---
I hope it's not the only are announcing, surely the shitstorm Blizzard endured taught some people something about the desire for mobile games among PC gamers
---
For talking about balance, always. There are people who think making ceptors immune to webs or scrams is a good idea
---
Hope they add a module or mode for citadels that addes a bubble and disables tethering though.
---
Alternative headline: VINDI Abandons PvP
---
Deal!
---
\&gt;  At no point did he think to ask Google, or at the very, very least think to ask his corp mates, or hell even ask local/jita/new players "heys what's all this blue text about" 
---
This is why you're part of the problem. I love that consequences exist in Eve. Right now new players should HAVE to rely on outside sources to understand what those consequences are. That's not how you build a good game.
---
\&gt;   How many times have I seen, "halt &lt;username&gt; you are a wanted enemy of the &lt;faction name&gt;" when jumping gates" and he, again, never, at any point, thought I wonder what that means. 
---
You're talking about the "enemy of the state" messages that come AFTER you jump a gate and decloak. He would have seen that once, about ten seconds before his Golem died. I see those message every time I undock or jump one of my gank alts. They occur when facpo are pursuing you and do nothing to let players know that there is a potential problem.
---
Spreadsheets are meant to format data in a logical way and im not sure you get the idea of a spreadsheet as a way of ogranizing Info
---
Maybe because anything bigger than a frig got caps dropped on it.
---
BR and placid still have lots of fights to be had.  Just get in a ship and talk in local you will be in a pod shortly after!
---
Ah okay so you don't have any source.
---
Got it, just bullshit.
---
Silence renter your super umbrella won't protect you here
---
Yea for sure, this sub is overly negative nine times out of ten. I also understand that we shouldn't go 100% doomer on this sub as it will only hurt our playercount.  
---
But don't you think it is a bit disingenous to be like "i am sitting on my blue donut and i am having the time of my life" while everything else is on fire? It is such an ignorant stance to take wrt to the health of the game.
---
&gt;Not gatekeeping just geniuenly curious.
---
I'm sure.
---
Only works if renters had super umbrellas.
---
Finally I can assert dominance over my enemies with a t-pose!
---
r/woosh
---
They can't deliver on things they have said
---
Samara is a big sissy girl who likes causing trouble
---
Appropriate people have been poked about it. along with some screenshots :D As I see the same thing. Looks almost like it's any time a name resolution fails.
