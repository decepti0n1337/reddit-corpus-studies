So much fun

man up or go back to bible school
---
we thought it was you, i noticed the scims and lack of booshers and suggested forming feroxes but was vetoed by senior fcs
---
we had just gotten back from a [coalition op in the drone regions](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001111/201903162000/) so everybody was a little tuckered out too
---
bad timing honestly
---
Usually just my boxers, probably with a ball hanging out of one leg.
---
I remembered this other time I killed someone on stream, it was Zarvox. https://zkillboard.com/kill/59130368/ He said something like, ha I'm gonna kill that Thrasher real quick before others land and was extremely surprised that I started repping and neuting. But he's a cool guy and didn't get salty. Still shame I didn't save the clip.
---
Someone at CCP didn't think and was like dayum rorqs look like they need to be broken.
---
&gt;I'll be sure to add your names to the list of "Reasons this game is dying". I'm not salty,
---
no, you're salty. you made a reddit post whining about getting titans dropped on you
---
&gt;Titan proliferation is silly at this point, anyone can have one, but risking it in combat only happens when there's a risk to your ship.
---
hi yea we're the coalition that just got out of not one but two supercapital wars over the course of the last year, during which i risked and lost an avatar-class space vessel
---
like
---
hello?
---
&gt;Bring subcaps next time you jerks, we'll both have a good time and you still get the loot of all the explody ships.
---
fly a battleship roam into range of literally anyone in eve's supercap fleet and this is most likely what you get, unless you get in contact with an fc beforehand and confirm what you're doing
---
They did actually rebrand "Egils Orka", a soft drink from Iceland, with a quafe logo: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQ3mzkNWoAATvlG.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQ3mzkNWoAATvlG.jpg)

I think we actually have a bottle at the office from last Fanfest, and it was just made for Fanfest afaik.

Farm salt from PVPers it's far more rewarding. üëç

Its pretty fun if you own a titan.

iirc horde has a rule that says no dropping caps on npsi/streamers
---
there is a good reason Xenuria why is on my block list xD
---
All I remember from like 8 years ago is training up fighters, assigning them from the safety of a POS shield and ratting with a VNI or something.
---
Carriers were also triage logistics. They were just useful so everyone went for em.
---
Then they got better and everyone else trained them too.
---
Slowcats were broken but fun.
---
You're an idiot, its called the cyno inhibitor you fucking mongoloid.  Sorry you're upset you got caught lying in public, but at this point I'm absolutely sure its not the first time, your reaction speaks volumes.
---
Let's imagine a scenario, hypothetically. Let's imagine you were running a legit loan business for a while and then you met Azathio. Sometimes you'd give him ISK to cover his loans, but maybe sometimes he took ISK from you and directly sold it to some RMT group. If you're innocent, you had no idea about it, and you do everything you've done, up to and including this post.
---
But let's say you were in on it, hypothetically. Let's say that one day, Azathio contacted you through some out of game service and told you that he had contacts with RMTers and if you sent him some ISK, he'd sell it for you and pay you a cut of the profits. So you start up a new PayPal account, get him to pretend to ask for money to cover a loan, you send him the ISK, and watch the money arrive in your PayPal account. Or you could even have done it multiple times over a long period, so no one transaction looks too suspicious. What would you have done differently? Private discussions between you and a director? That's not going to show anything, so you'd show them to CCP. Logs from your conversations with Azathio? That's just going to show all the real conversations you had, and the fake messages you sent to cover up RMT, so you'd show them to CCP. Direct access to your bank accounts? That won't show anything to CCP, so you'd hand them over. Access to your personal PayPal account (not the separate account you used to collect money from Azathio)? Sure, that won't show anything, you'd give it to CCP.
---
Hell, you'd probably even make this post, in an effort to publicly pressure CCP into unbanning you, since they can't have any direct evidence of wrongdoing. 
---
Now, whether or not you did it, I don't really care. But surely you can see how nothing you've offered to show CCP proves your innocence, right?
---
At the end of the day, CCP has some reason they thought you were guilty, and unless you have concrete proof of your innocence, I doubt they will take a look at it. Nor should they, tbh. Without running sting operations, it's virtually impossible to prove RMT. If CCP unbanned every ISK seller when they showed a few chat logs and a clean bank account, nobody would ever be banned for RMT.
---
Finally, have you ever recieved anything from CCP that specifically says you were banned for associating with Azathio? You said you've lost around 27b isk over 2 years. If 10b of that got funneled to a single person (and I would expect a successful scammer to try it again), CCP could think THAT was a form of RMT, especially if the eventual recipient went on to sell that ISK for real money. You might have been scammed out of 10b on people not paying their debts, but from CCPs perspective, they just saw 10b ISK go from you, to a collection of alts, to a RMTer. If I'm CCP, that looks like RMT to me.
---
I'm not saying you're definitely guilty. But CCP clearly had some information that made you look guilty to them. They could be wrong, of course, but if any of us redditors here want to proclaim your innocence based on this post, we would necessarily have to assume the following two things:
---
1. CCP banned you only because of your association with Azathio
---
2. You are giving an accurate account of your association with Azathio.
---
We can't know whether 1 is true or false unless CCP makes a specific statement (which they won't), and we can't really know if 2 is true or false either.
---
So basically, this entire post was pointless and gives no real evidence for your innocence. If you truly are an innocent bystander that was wrongly caught up in an RMT ban wave, I'm sorry. That sucks, and I genuinely hope you can find something else that you enjoy as much as you enjoyed Eve. If you were actually involved in RMT, though, fuck you for that, and double fuck you for trying to make us feel bad for you.
---
did you record the drop? :pray:
---
can we ban the OP from this sub reddit?
---
honestly they're lucky killah didn't boson them but he wasn't around so
---
Its not cheating if its not against the rules, stop trying to force your particular moral standards on everybody.  Cheating is not playing by the rules, there is no rule concerning this particular 'feature' of EVE, therefore the only reason you wouldn't do it is personal preference and I think I speak for more than one person when I say "who the fuck cares what you think is wrong and right?"
---
Pretty sure most adults can work that one out.  
---
This post surpasses Grrr Goons. It's more like REEE Goons!
---
&gt; I was kicked from my WH corp **last night**
---
No, just a buttplug to simulate getting fucked by the loot fairy every single time.
---
killah bee actually wanted to honor the subcap fight, it was pl that dropped supers then
---
knowing now that it was a g-fleet berlin event I kinda feel bad about it
---
he wasn't, you were scouted by us on our own
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
He also says that him and Azathio would lend each other ISK to cover loans. If Azathio lied, and instead occasionally sold that ISK to an RMT site, his payment to Azathio would look suspicious as well, right? I mean, just because there's an intermediary doesn't mean you aren't doing RMT, and if a bunch of accounts were sending Azathio ISK to sell (and presumably taking a cut of the real money he got for it) then any innocent person who also happened to send him ISK could look like they were doing RMT as well.
---
I've always thought of Hek as the pirate's hub.  It's a 0.5, meaning that unless you're below -4.5 with Minmatar you won't get blown out on arrival.  Plus, there's a 0.4 directly connected, so if you're on good terms with the camp you can get in and out relatively quickly.
---
yea that makes sense, since you need Drones V for fighters afaik 
---
It inhibits after the cyno has been used. Why do you think that is effective in preventing a cyno?
---
They make it available at fanfest. I don't know if they ever sold it any other way.
---
yeah there's a lot of reasons why what would be completely non-rmt activity between business associates would look like suspicious rmt activity if ccp didn't bother asking any questions
---
which they don't
---

---
Tip 5: Aligning a ship then stopping it does not mean you are any more aligned to the celestial than if you were pointing the exact opposite way, therefore this Tip is meaningless.
---
Alignment is velocity based, that is to say it is based on speed and direction. If you are stationary, you are not aligned, no matter which way you're facing.
---
I always play eve with no paints and in boxers it‚Äôs my token rule.

Yeah a bit bruvs. Started logging in again last week. Who dis?

Ive always wondered what someone is to do if you are unhappy about someones behavior? Because apparently if you call them out on them you are "Virtue signaling" Are you not also virtue signaling then with your comment? See how it really doesn't make sense?

Thank you phil for your kind offer :) but, i think i will go with vargo's link. Sorry cannot do both :(
---
Hey vargo :) See you in game :)
---
So NPSI super / titan fleet when?
---
My point was entirely a supply demand reference and nothing more layered or nuanced.  Rorqual nerfs = lower supply = higher mineral pricing.   
---
It includes fleets looking for fights, horde asks that you ping for a fleet before you drop your caps. We like content!
---
Just join Horde Xenuria.  Then you can dock all you want.  You know you like it better up here anyway.
---
Apologies, I can't keep up on the current events because I just recently joined the U. S. Air Force, so I am finding it hard to play EVE atm. 
---
"What over repping looks like"
---
Fixed that for ya.
---
Best thing to do probably is to keep at range 2km of the can so you don't bump off it if you need to warp out.
---
Only one??? I‚Äôve got one hanging on each side..
---
&gt;&gt;TLDR: It's boring to drop supers/titans on subcaps, please play the game with us!
---
it was quite fun as a titan. sorry we didn't play a sandbox game the way you wanted us to
---
Caps are fun to fly
---
Did you use R to compute these stats?
---
Cheers. 
---
&gt; Wait, you actually WANT to pay more money for something that gives no extra content or artwork but instead just speeds up a timer? 
---
Where does it say, that I WANT that? It was merely my answer to the topic, which is: 
---
&gt; You know what would absolutely rake in some cash for CCP?
---
If it went my way, there wouldn't be any attributes. (Change implants to +1% to +5% trainingspeed, if you have to.)
---
Holy fuck. That is literally what I was getting at.
---
also, a cruiser gang, or smaller, would get a completely different response than a 100 man battleship fleet
---
of course I did :)
---
Talking to a different person now bud, was giving an insiders perspectives to outsiders guessing.
---
The list of regions you won't get a fair fight 'by design' is greater than half of the regions it is possible to get a fight in it would seem.
---
Most of the issue I, and I suspect many others have with this kind of BR, is that there were clearly sufficient numbers to bring a fight of at least some challenge and parity, but it was decided not to.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=865&amp;b=8523180&amp;e=90&amp;t=svvfvvvvvvvvvvvvf&amp;o=1 i think i fixed it

Nc. 290m
---
Ravens 22B
---
yeah i totally wouldn't recommend rolling in a blops, im just saying its possible
---
man, all the elite goons in this thread, explaining how their deployment is a success even if it fails by every possible measure
---
it really takes "guts" to take a fight that you apparently cannot lose! 
---
Why would I put up collateral for a loan when I could just sell said collateral and have the isk without interest?
---
but do you enjoy playing a game where cats are running around everywhere?
---
That's essentially the core of it. All the "This is killing EVE" posts usually tell the tale of one side actually having fun at the expense of the other. If it wasn't fun for NC./PL to drop such hammer on a fleet, they likely would not do it. It's EVE, pissing on someone else's cereal bowl is something people like to do.
---
The game itself is boring 90% of the time the best part of the game is chatting with friends on coms and discord. If you want to enjoy eve find a good group of people to fly with. Having out of game ways to communicate with your corpmates is pretty important because the eve chat servers are unreliable and constantly going down.
---
The piece that I believe you're missing is this:
---
Adding a decay mechanic has literally no effect on a corp that fuels its structures. So a small corp that fuels its structures does not require more attention, no repairs have to be done, and no more time nor resources have to be invested.
---
Adding a decay mechanic imposes additional costs on corps that don't fuel their structures, in the form that they now have to fuel their structures in order to keep them, and the point I was making is that I'm fine with that.

I'm in amarr fw but because of the 0.5 status, the proximity of fw space (2j) and the hub never being camped my clone is in Hek and I wont change.

I wear my onesy.

well today init deployed their super fleet from fountain to camal to whore on a keepstar in derelik, so we already know they'd only take them north with the rest of the goon blob

At this rate we‚Äôll be able to erect our own keepstar in j5a

1) Sit on titan

2) Wait

I live in the Aptetter constellation, just a few jumps from Hek.  It's nice because I have easy access to:

- Two lowsec islands if I need to do anything in there (i.e. moon mining) that are also in convenient jump range of Geminate

Tfw people think CCP is strapped for cash when they've been able to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into failed projects and have been bought out by one of the largest companies in Korea
---
CCP have sold a Quafe-branded lemonade at Fanfest for years.

Not bad, needs to be chilled. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to ship that in a cost-effective way. You‚Äôd need a manufacturer and a distributor at either end of the big drink.

What if I told you that your 7 T2 logi Frigates shouldn't be able to outrep the DPS of a supercarrier? 
---
So you are pissed because the balance patch is a first step to see how things go and they didn't realease a massive overhaul of the entire game alongside it? Am I reading this right?
---
TYPHOOOOOON JEEEEEENKINS!
---
CODE probably has the best pvpers in the game. At least the ones that live in the wh. They always seem to take a fight even when outnumbered and they usually win. It is really fun fighting them.
---
Watch the video until the end. The dps sometimes comes from only 2-3 sets of fighter and still very hard to rep. So you can cyno from a panic ship with huge tank instantly but inhibitor should be what it is today?
---
Oh hey man ‚úåÔ∏è You been playing?
---
Im am not pissed. It's my personal opinion that the proposed changes are not enough to clear the aggresion of caps against subcaps.

please harden up buddy its kinda sad that you are triggered so easily. I'm sure that your probably trolling if not then please make use of the block option.

You should probably read the ToS and EULA. It is obviously a bug, not a feature, therefore, exploiting it IS against the rules.

I know that you come from a group that prides itself on crossing the line, but seriously, it is cheating.

Most of nullsec trit doesn't make its way to highsec anyhow. Even at 10isk trit, you're not looking at a favorable transport even from near lowsec null.

Nah, it's an old WoW meme. I used to have a bank guild in WoW for my alts called Chinese Gold Farmers too, because they used to be the most prominent botters and Gold/Leveling service sellers back then (like in 2009/10?).
---
?
---
1) IIRC all that was changed was BS5-&gt;BS3?  
---
2) Technically true, but less related to mineral price than people think  
---
3) This is one of the biggest factors, people are injecting, badly.  I have talked with nyx pilots who were single account...  
---
4) Carriers were all ready all-around.  Damage increased less than people think.  The meta around capital use changed.  
---
How did it get nerfed
---
Goons coming to bail out their pets?
---
A friend of mine who was reading over my shoulder just said he had no idea there were books. What a maroon!
---
1. The drone skills and remote rep skills no longer being needed on a carrier alt is significant. 
---
4. Not really. Slow cats were a special case. Solo carriers were actually pretty awful outside of triage platforms. 
---
o7
---
So when you see the cyno, there is no counter to it.
---
You are stuck at "prevent/avoid the problem". Is it the fact that fixing the cyno fucks with your playstyle that you refuse to see the real issue?

That's my one and only character actually
---
Are you dense?

If you dont get your cyno up before the cyno inhibitor is up theres no counter, if you dont get your cyno up before the jammer is up you can't light a cyno.  
---
I live in a wormhole and don't have anything that can jump anywhere jfyi, i actually hunt and kill carriers in enemy space from said wormhole and i think your logic makes zero fucking sense, you want cynos removed, never going to ever happen.

Solo carriers sure, but the same mechanics had solo motherships if you remember those days.
---
DI isn't needed for the hull anymore?
---
Is.. is he... dead?
---
non-super carriers have always been able to be produced in lowsec stations
---
I'm guessing that this is due to people not getting what they want from the devs.  
---
I would bet that the 64-bit client and the potential major server side changes would cost a shit-load, but this sort of thing is not as in your face as new ships, new gameplay, etc, so it gets intuitively devalued.

Considering history, the panda.

We have established the inhib is delayed. The cyno does not have a delay. Are you saying there is information missing here?

I orbit at 500 and take the fight like a man!

The legacy rig collecting might also have triggered this type of ripple effect from others 'exiting eve'.

&gt; Check this HEL kill a few weeks back from a logi point a view so you can actually see our inhibitor against 1 single HEL and 7 Kirins 
---
The FC fucked up in at least three different ways (that I can think of) that would have kept this from happening. 
---
All these 'buff inhibs' posts are just people looking for super kills to be handed to them on a silver platter.

They're already super powerful tools.

i doubt that random guys wouldnt try to boson them, people have big toys and they want to use them.

imagine thinking that frt would anchor a structure on a holding corp then show up to defend it

kinda defeats the purpose of going incognito ya know

also farmstink remember to swap your clones next time

Sorry noraus

No panic. No overheating. No cyno. Theres nothing you could have done but die.

Omg what site is that?
---
do what bog always do : kiss the ass of the bigger man to protect you 
---
supers and rorquals are already dying daily to big gangs, now with less tank rorquals will die even more, your mentality is flawed in general you want to make it way too easy to kill big stuff, if thats the case they arent gonna be used at all, its not exactly a 400 iq play to put down an inhib and have logi to rep your gang, if you are able to kill 1/4 supported caps you are at a very good analogy, make it 50/50 and nobody is gonna fly them. So everything will be like dronelands and you wouldnt want that trust me.
---
Mmmmmm... The bottom half of this picture looks kinda like a confused Tesla on autopilot ....
---
His ass is still puckered after this fight
---
The civilian repper lol
---
Eh More like FRT broke the NiP. So it ended because of that.
---
Its still ok, it did get nerfed, passive drake is simply not as good as before but its doable. You'll just have to pay a lot more attention, actually fly around, use range, transversals, etc. Do not expect to park it and blap everything.
---
Well yeah, at least they do try.   
---
  
---
If that's not your thing you can always just join panfam and end any deployment whenever an enemy fights back.

a wh'er anchored a rait in B-K in Insmother and some shitty legacy pets went to kill it
---
elo knight showed up and killed the ferox fleet attacking it (https://zkillboard.com/related/30002143/201903170100/)
---
legacy pets with the collective iq of a kumquat are now claiming it's a frat structure and a breach of the NIP
---
what did they do?
---
The change to fighter mechanics and application made them better for ratting than previously, easy storability provided by citadels, and limited cap threat because of local superiority/ jump mechanic changes.
---
Hahahaha That's quality response
---
Dropped a structure in Immensea .
---
bloody frt 
---
Tapi retconed the nip we signed. 
---
I would say that 90% of our kills are on players from Nullsec groups. We‚Äôre not targeting new players. We‚Äôre declaring war on the largest groups in Eve so we can have more content.
---
Proof or didnt happen !
---
by HK dropped a citadel but not frtÔºü
---
I was thinking a spaceship battle royale, but I guess that's also an idea.
---
what
---
oh sorryÔºåthats not HKÔºåits some corp i dont know.
---
They didn't drop it themselves, Origin just covered the anchoring of a hostile structure. Classic BL trying to get a fight, but also technically a violation since they're part of Frat now. 
---
your people formed to defend it :thinking:
---
To be clear I don't think Snuffed Out is "working with provi"
---
They are just after content for their members and its one of the last non-goon aligned Keepstars in lowsec.
---
Provi has invited them, but they try to invite everyone and few people want to work with them directly more than once.
---
It seems that TEST has been seeking an appropriate narrative for a while. This is really not it. To be clear, the claim is that Fraternity dropped a structure in Immensea under some random corp tag. Seems like as good of a reason as anything, especially since the same corp dropped one in Detorid that had to be killed as well. Test could not even bother to translate a ping that clearly called for a stand down and formed a fleet to fight nothing. So the idea that none of you seem to have your intel straight does not surprise me. Get a better propaganda machine, your current line of bullshit cannot even muster a strong smell.
---
We killed the one in our space. Its like this corp came from another russian alliance from etherium reach  :thonking: 
---
This might come as a shock to you, but it could be possible for "some wh'er" to allow FRT to dock in said structure whenever they just "shows up".  
---
That's why most coalitions don't take kindly to neutral structures in their space.
---
They can join a corp that is war immune. If new players are being killed then you only have yourselves to blame for not hosting them in a war immune corp. 
---
It's panda eating time!
---
check their terms related to alt corps, talk to your corp diplo and explain the situation so he can check if you're okay.

Nope. Job is keeping me more than busy and I have a new clone at home. All accounts are unsubbed, not sure when I can get back. Still here for the drama and the shit talking though.
---
"It's your fault for not knowing that your corp is shitty before you joined it."
---
It‚Äôs already been changed Gorski... we have war immune corps. Put your new players in those while they learn the game and are ready and prepared to step out.
---
Why are we still crying about supposed new players dying to wars when the ball is in your court? You have war immune corps... now use them. We don‚Äôt specifically target new players and I‚Äôd say 90% of our kills are on Nullsec players so when you choose to not utilize a mechanic meant to keep players safe from war yet you want to be all ‚Äúthink of the children‚Äù - that‚Äôs on you.

i thought they were a Siberian cloud ring alliance? i saw some of them there once time 
---
NIP ENDED with Fraternity, now GOON is my best friend
---
I think the true reason is someone got butthurt about this https://zkillboard.com/kill/75730350/
---
And wants to get some green on his KB to hide it. 
---
Fraternity covered the anchoring of a hostile strucutre in Immensea, they are claiming its not theirs and im sure its probably not.
---
nonetheless it anchored due to their interference. A clear violation of a NIP that is already breaking down. 
---
Thus we chose to end it and end the illusions of anything happening that is not. 
---
ETA on batphone ?
---
imagine believing this
---
&gt; Siberian cloud ring alliance
---
At this point tapi doesnt care where it came from. They did their best to say we broke nips, so this random Russian corp that placed in both our space to start the war. I dont think tapi asked them to do it either. 
---

This seems to be the structure TEST talked about

---
Need to get X Moros back so we can have Sir Edmund / X Moros fight 
---
As cool as it sounds, it would be a pain. Also, drones don‚Äôt use ammo either. And it might require way too many resources on the server side.
---
you mean me, you and killah can be the elite vanq skwad
---
Being out and trying to get a fight =/= forming to defend it lol
---
Alright, since TEST is actually using this as their justification I'll shed some light on our dastardly plan.
---
We're burning to shoot FEDUP or whoever else we find when my scout ceptor sees a cyno in a system with like 3 in local. I warp to grid and wouldn't ya know it, there's a FEDUP niddy and sabre shooting some raitaru. We burn over to a titan and bridge off the niddy - by now FEDUP has realized solo bashing a raitaru in a nidhoggur with an open cyno right next to you is a bad idea and have like 10 feroxes on grid. Niddy warps, we shoot feroxes until we're done, TEST jumps some carriers in &amp; feeds fighters. We chase carriers back to their fort, they fail to boson us, [Farmstink forgets to take out his slaves](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75730350/), and we fuck off towards Catch. 
---
Next thing I know I find out TEST thinks that we anchored a structure using some random 13-man holding corp to evade notice and are breaking the NIP. 
---
Imagine being such a smoothbrain that you think we anchored a structure on an alt corp then showed up to defend it on Fraternity. toons. Wouldn't really be in keeping with the whole incognito thing, would it?
---
Anyway thanks for the feed legacy
---
r/whoosh
---
Its not my pilot anymore =\[ not my vanq friendo too poor.
---
just fucking say you didn't want to nip, would have found other ways to end it.
---
Did we? Or did we shoot your pets and then leave? Hard to tell the difference when you're a moron
---
btw thank you for feeding your dictor to us like 3 times
---
sad times indeed
---
But don't fuck it up like Bethesda.
---
Lol imagine needing this much justification to shoot someone in a space game. 
---
Hence why we killed the one that they dropped in our space.

I'm an optimist. At least you're honest enough to admit to being personally upset by it. So many white knights claim to [not be personally offended](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b06e9c/warp_to_me_sjws/eicz10s/) and then speak at length on behalf of hypothetical people who *could* be offended. You still need to calm down though.

*eyeroll* 
---
and in todays episode of *the mind of ailok*
---
I'm pretty sure the cloaky camping of Legacy ended the NIP 2 weeks ago.   
---
You could of just been honest and said you wanted to end nip instead of using some rando structure, it would of actually make big news on Reddit just by itself " BREAKING NEWS: Test does NOT try to spin things on Reddit, more coming soon.  :)  
---
I guess we shouldn't be surprised, you've always lied to your members and run your alliance and coalition on fake propaganda and narratives, all coalitions do this to some degree just not to the point that you and PGL do. I actually feel bad for Xdeath with the amount of bullshit you feed them whilst treating them second class and let them get farmed.  
---
We all know what will happen, xix will fail to invade, legacy will come, they will kill of EU tz then eventually UStz if they lucky, then they wont be able to beat china in chinaman time so they will batphone goons and you will have another 1-2 months of Tidi fests where goons slug through everything using broken game mechanics and sharing accounts to make people stop logging in and playing the game and then china will fall and goons will go home, test will go home and xix will probably overextend legacy even further into detorid, not that legacy could hold the space it already has if it was invaded.   
---
I really hope legacy see's some sense and will let china and xix fight it out, we may even see interesting fights worth taking small third party fleets to but its unlikely as they know that mum goonswarm will always come to back them up if something goes wrong so they can swing their dick as much as they want.
---
To be clear, the claim is the Elo under the FRT tag covered the anchoring of a hostile structure.  Whether or not it was FRT anchoring it is irrelevant. 
---
Y'all have been just as excited to break this NIP as us, apparently.  Quit playing the victim card so hard.
---
Plz nerf cloaky camp op no counter play

imagine being too dumb to understand this.

Both plz

My thoughts exactly. 10k users, on a wednesday, smack dab in the middle of the work day, hell even the school day. Who TF do they think is gonna be there? 10k unemployed basement dwellers... sounds like a real winner. How about do it when it actually stands a chance THEN do a playback for the trade show. Whats more important, being live or actually even happening at all and not being a total failure?
---
&gt; nonetheless it anchored due to their interference.
---
yikes

"-This NIP does not extend to XiX, but any attacks upon XiX will be viewed as attacks on Legacy for the moment and will be responded to in kind up to and including cessation of this deal. This includes their allies as well."

That's a broad statement to make whilst only looking in and not seeing the full picture. We don't have access to the data that CCP sees.
---
Lol you don‚Äôt get to ‚Äúwhooosh‚Äù on a badly applied meme
---
Sorry, did you expect us to finish bashing the raitaru for you? Or should we have not shot your pets' Ferox fleet because they happened to be shooting a raitaru? We didn't cover the anchoring a hostile structure. We found a dummy doing a dumb thing in a niddy and shot the fleet that formed to save him. Not everything is a giant, dastardly plot.

you might actually be right and am i the only one who thinks 200b issnt very much nowadays?

Signing up and then finding out its at midday on wednesday are w different things. Sure maybe thats being a bit of arrogant american and sure there may be plenty of EU available to make it happen, but its a bit annoying to get the email, grow an interest in checking it out then finding out its not even remotely targeted at possibly the largest interested audience.

but jay theres no counter play to them not doing anything - it isn't fair
---
Quit playing the spin card. Jesus. 
---
Both of you just shut up and fight. Neither of you Stuck to the NIP and this structure is unrelated. You say they defended it, they simply went for content and shot whatever they could. You'd do the exact same if you found a structure anchoring in their space and saw it as content. 
---
So both of you can fuckoff and go fight, but keep your narrative bullshit off reddit. 
---
do you not high grade snake all your dictors? what are you, poor?
---
Some things not quite spelled out. If you are purely exploring you should fit for align time and grid speed. Also dont control space that means that other asteros and even cloaky cruisers could mwd bump you and get the lock in time. Pretty awesome though, like the humor element!
---
Godly knows why CCP allows literally the most powerful module in the entire game be freely fitted on any random frigate worth of nothing for the past decade
---
&gt; instead of using some rando structure
---
If it was a random structure and did not belong to FRT, BL wouldn't be pushing this narrative full force on damage control mode within minutes of these threads coming up.  
---
You're over doing it.
---
Yeah, the terms of NIPs mean you leave fleets alone that are dealing with things like anchoring structures in space if you care about keeping those NIPs.  That's how we've always upheld our end of shit like this.  The fact that you chose not to is on you.

Everyone complains about how there is no counter to Cloaking.

Forgetting that Cloaking IS a counter, to always being visible in space. Without the ability to Cloak, there wouldn't be any way to sneak around and spy on people.
---
I mean, Fanfest is next month, and CCP had been silent about new game content since Vegas

Its time

Well a narrative this stupid deserves only the stupidest of meme replies 
---
I stopped reading at ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù
---
Wow the goalposts are already shifting 
---
30 minutes ago that was our raitaru we we're trying to stealthily anchor on an alt corp, yet showed up to defend. Now the problem is that we dared to shoot neutrals
---
By the way when TEST caps jumped in the raitaru still had a minute left to shoot it. Kinda makes you wonder why you focused so much on bosoning us and not on defending your space. 
---
hello its me, thrive.

Push paper a little harder, maybe the spin will take if you do.
---
How do bots get intel to dock up when you log in dreads, exactly?
---
I lit the cyno and by the time TEST caps jumped in, the structure had 1 second left because the feroxes were busy shooting the jackdaws.  It was commented about on comms.  Way to try to retcon to make us look bad I guess.
---
Who cares?
---
Oh no you looked plenty bad when you fed feroxes to us and then pretended that was our raitaru to justify a war everyone knows you were gonna start anyway
---
I'm just so happy the war started by TEST clutching their pearls over some random Russian alt corp
---
I'm sorry your risk-averse style of play is dying.

This is the skin that'll be rewarded to attendees of EVE's Amsterdam fanfest stop, for the Leshak, Vedmak, and Kikimora - note how it's called *"Netherworld Striker"*, and Amsterdam is located in the *Netherlands* ;P

---
The first stop on the fanfest world tour is actually in just over a week - things are definitely on the verge of happening, stay tuned~
---
Nah, they just don't have a good narrative to push. It's literally the shit I'd expect from a playground argument.
---
Have a good narrative, even the old classic "grr frat are botting we're helping to cleanse eve" narrative I can get behind.
---
This "eww, you broke the nip, no you broke the nip, no you broke the nip bullshit" is fucking boring. 
---
You‚Äôre aware of the irony here, right?
---
Dope statistics friend, don't listen to the overly dramatic and probably statistically correct Goon fcs as their opinions are irrelevant. You are doing gods work my friend, Praise the camp. And like any good neighbor remember, Statefarm is there.
---
I'm literally the only one doing it and it's because I find this whole thing hilarious. We showed up to shoot the FEDUP noddy, no one but you gave a shit about that raitaru. Blades of grass bashed one by the same corp. It's not ours. But I'm fuckin dying laughing that the legacy braintrust is out uncovering our evil plot
---
Darkislife why?
---
Fuck off moron.
---
see?
---
I think I've done enough typing today so I will keep my little opinion short
---
While the idea of a short time invincibility period is nice to keep the miners, small guys and big corp alike, safe from the predators in space
---
The PANIC module is rarely being presented with the constant idea of "attrition" throughout New Eden.
---
For example, most weapons use ammo need to be manufactured, drones/fighters can be destroyed, siege module/doomsday weapons/jump drive need fuel.
---
But PANIC only consumes capacitor.
---
IMO PANIC should consume some expensive materials as fuel to be activated.
---
In that case, even the hunters failed to take down their prey, they would still have the sense of accomplishment that the prey lost something precious
---
The structure was hostile, you showed up to get a fight because you knew we'd be bashing it. Those are all indisputable facts lol, I don't know why you think that's not what happened.

---
But the actual hilarious thing is that you're missing the point completely.  
---
whoever anchored it is completely irrelevant. The fact that you covered anchoring it is. It could have been dropped by GotG, it doesn't matter.  
---
&gt;I'm literally the only one doing    
---
Nope, look around. You guys are trying really really hard to convince everyone that you're being accused of dropped a structure you're not being accused of dropping.
---
Lmao, accusing BL/Origin of pushing a narrative when you're drinking Vily's koolaid of a 12 man alt corp being a Frat/WC front to avoid the NIP. Which, [if you checked its Evewho profile](https://evewho.com/corp/Thrive./leavehistory), you could see many of its former members going back to HK/being from HK.
---
*slurp slurp* moron
---
who the hell cares about politics and all those tears, shittalkers and speculations. as long as you are not part of any of those alliances leaderships you should just shovhe a dick up your mouth and rally up your ships. like anyone here has a fkn clue what incest politics go on in the background. in the very end it doesnt matter and gives content to everyone. some crabbers might die and lose a super while botting but nothing of worth lost here. let's go.
---
I just think it's a seriously hilarious reason to White Knight all over Reddit about how we violated the nip
---
Lets also pretend the legacy cloaky campers weren't violations. Or not because it's a fucking video game and everyone knew Legacy was invading anyway. It's just hilarious that the shot heard round the world was farmstink's slave pod dying over some random Russian raitaru
---
What were those shield extenders like? I‚Äôm assuming better than T2, but how did they compare to faction?

&gt; Vily's koolaid of a 12 man alt corp being a Frat/WC front

You should check again which alliances are arguing here. Then you will understand

Yeah it wasn't a good look when Vily cried about us shooting neutrals, and it isn't a good look for you, either. We're simple people. We see dumb people doing dumb things, we shoot them. If you wanna claim that's a nip violation, go ahead - you're literally the only people that care. 
---
&gt; If you wanna claim that's a nip violation, go ahead - you're literally the only people that care.

Holy shit lol, BL is currently going apeshit on this reddit proving that you in fact, care more than anyone.

You know how I can tell this is a lie. Because goon supers dont even dock up for 200 bombers next door.
---
I don‚Äôt see third partying on a structure bash listed in the NIP as a reason for it ending, but ok
---
CCP has devalued themselves with the amount of half assed work they put in. Half-assed content in a subscription based game is absolutely inexcusable. The amount of money they've raked in from Eve Online and proceed to waste on anything but Eve Online is a serious slap in the face to every player of the game.. Only after a year long uproar about balance have they finally decided to do something, had the community not been as incessant about change, it's doubtful CCP would have taken any step in fixing this game.
---
Is this bait? It smells like bait
---
Uh sweetie Vily just started a war over this

I think that means he cares more than my Reddit shitposting does

I can't even tell if these posts are ironic anymore

"""I'm sure its probably not""" i.e. Vily is implying that it might be.

Look, if TEST wants to go to war, they don't have to cook up some bullshit over a HK alt corp that Frat killed a structure from the same day.

You are the epitome of a 5-watt man in a 10-watt world.

It's not white knighting, everyone knew this was going to happen in like a week anyways when the deal expired naturally, you're flipping your shit about "narrative" when the only thing that's actually going on is a deal being formally annulled and a bunch of autists screaming "REEEEEEEE DINOBRAINS" on reddit.

Karmafleet? Is that part of goons? Am I allowed to rarrer/supercarrier rat in that corp? In ph I wasnt allowed to supercarrier rat :(.
---
TY! 
---
" Ganking, not bringing a fight, " Thonking ...  "Spectre Fleet took a 105 man NPSI Raven Fleet with Scythe/Scimitar logi out to have some fun " 
---
So when you outship and outnumber people , you let them go right ? you wouldn't hold them and have the NPSI fleet whore on them right ? or is it only fun when you do it . WTF am i saying of course its only fun when you do it
---
Change corp? Why would I need to change corp once I'm in carmafleet?ak
---
Thats a scam
---
We would need a lot more players doing this kind of stuff against big coalitions. Would make the game better for all of us. You should make an 'anarchist cookbook' styled guide on how to shit on big groups in 2019.
---
you are 100% right.
---
All this patch is going to do is mean the people who are not under the super umbrella will die sooner and easier.
---
CCP wanted quick changes; i.e. edit the database.
---
I believe they told the CSM that cyno changes would take alot more effort.. aka it ain't happening anytime soon.
---
what you described in your post is a stereotypical nullbear
---
The worst kind of people.
---
The best course of action certainly to call attention to it on a reddit post
---
Srsly, are you?
---
I'm sorry I'm still trying to learn the eve slogans.What's a nullbear?

Great questions. I have a feeling that the 2013 exploit article is obsolete but I haven't been around long enough to tell you why. E-warp mechanics are arcane knowledge at best, and finding someone who both understands them and remembers back that far could be tough. 
---
For your second question, login e-warp cannot be interrupted. Any tackle or bubbles would be ignored. Bumping delays it indefinitely, hence the article.
---
Also, ratting in carriers was looked down upon as negligent and stupid - IIRC carrier ratting would get you kicked from the corp I was in during tense periods. Supercarrier ratting? You're insane.
---
Now people rat in fucking titans...
---
You, just now: 
---
&gt; Uh sweetie Vily just started a war over this
---
Also you, elsewhere in this thread: 
---
&gt; Or not because it's a fucking video game and everyone knew Legacy was invading anyway 
---
Still living rent free in your head Olmeca ? Delve ratting as per normal 
---
It's what salty highsec dwellers call people who play eve properly
---
this just has to be bait

I hope you enjoyed 
---
Wasting playtime to do tedious stuff that has no real benefits. Cool.
---
Buy a BPC pack. Way cheaper, even with no production skills a rorq would be 2.5 weeks of training,  and you can build anything you'd need after with only another 1.5 months.  
---
I'm really kind of a noob. What's a BPC pack?
---
Goons are notorious for scamming. They'll keep telling you to avoid the fee but all that is going to do is piss off the recruiter and they'll block you in game.
---
You have to pay the 2bill fee like the rest of us to get in. How do you think they can afford all of the infrastructure and security fleets??
---
You say that like we need permission to cum! We are always cumming spod

Idk...region looks pretty red for having the "best defense fleet in game"
---
I'm a bit confused. Is that supposed to be an insult or a compliment? From the way he said it it sounded like an sinsult?
---
Tbh the only bear I know is superbear and highsec carbbear. Both of which I only vagule know the definition of.
---
Dude, I got a drinking bird toy in Goons, literally all it does is press F1
---
TIL that terribad FCs think taking BS fleets to nullbloc space is where you get "gudfites"
---
Lol yeah the thing is what we're doing wouldn't work as a big group. Big alliances tried and failed in the NPC station game.
---
It takes more like 3 persistent fucks and some other people chiming in to do some of the work on a volunteer basis.
---
Talk to the diplos, see if it is legit, worst case scenario, they might ask you to pay for it.
---
All i learned from this thread is that diplomats need to be tarred and feathered for preventing content.
---
Blueprint copy pack. It allows you to build all the parts and the hull of anything you would need.
---
You should be able to buy a rorq BPC pack in Dodi or in Jita.
---
A nullbear is a useless member of a corporation/alliance in nullsec; usually because they do nothing but krab.
---
You can set the fee for reprocessing, but you have no actual way of making people not in corp pay for what they mined since it's Hi-Sec.
---
Isn't that we all do in reality, friend? 
---
I guess they can just dock up and do nothing instead, wasting everybody's time.
---
It's going to happen on the 22nd anyway. Just get it going and have done with it. That's pretty much my take on it.
---
Next time, contact an FC like KillahBee beforehand, and we would love to have a fun brawl. As it was, a 100man Raven fleet was a bit too spooky...and we might have over reacted a tiny bit....
---
But this is what happens when you don't call before you come over!
---
Interesting...and I would be able to mine/manufacture everything I need in like...less than 6 months? (4-5 hrs of mining per week...not on a whole lot)
---
Sorry for all the questions but this is something I have no understanding of
---
This has to be bait.
---
I have been playing around with my ui to get it better set up. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also what was the message that I got at the end of this site. Third question is how do I get my medium armor reps to do more healing? 
---
Depends on where you are. If you're in high sec, you'll be mining and missioning for months to build that, and you can't use it in high sec.
---
In lowsec, it will take you a month to a few depending on the barge you use. In null-sec you can mine the ore or isk in a month no problem, even with a procurer. Don't try this in a venture.
---
No distain here, more like boredom and half assed trolling attempt ;)

---
Oh no. Nip ended. Best get on panda killing again? Idk not like anything changes. 
---
I think they are just masochists at this point...
---
if i had gold, i would give it to you.
---
1) I prefer to have my windows and stuff around the edges so I can see the game in the middle. So I wouldn't have the Overview poking out so much, or the drone window just hanging out top left.
---
2) The message means the site Escalated. Go look in the Agency window, and you should have another site to visit in a nearby system.
---
3) Aux Nano Pump rigs will make the armor repper heal more each time it fires. Nanobot Accelerator rigs will make it fire faster (but that will also eat Cap faster too).
---
I would delete this post

Assuming you are who I think you are, assuming you're being sincere, and considering I am one of the people who has killed you a lot, if you join Karmafleet you will not be kicked for feeding afaik. You will be laughed at, but not kicked. I would highly encourage you to ask a lot of questions about how to stay safe and get saved if you do join.

No fun wars allowed, everyone has to fight due to a narrative because we're all roleplayers, apparently.

He's not being harassed though.

Mate half the time theyll undock and rat even with 200 bombers in system.

Also we kinda diminished bot count a lot last month. The corp we made wibla to kick alone had 9 supers farming for a year. We see perhaps half the amount of them now. We go for them first as they are easy prey, and I am sure you guys would also appreciate that.

Another event?  I'm just excited to see how CCP manages to make this one even worse than the last one, since that seems to be the trend.  Every event goes further down the poo-hole.

He was kicked because in a very, VERY, short time the vast majority of the alliance grew to dislike him to an extreme degree due to incessant talk about how much money his parents allowed him to spend on the game, his complete and utter lack of fleet participation other than welping cormorants in jackdaw fleets trying to loot the field before the fight is even over and his desires to buy expensive supers and titans specifically to welp them idiotically. He also is not able to use any form of voice comms due to his parents blocking all the .exe files for any type of communication application and also can't play on weekends because "My parents won't let met".  
---
Despite MANY talks about learning how to play the game properly, starting with subcaps and learning even basic game mechanics, people grew tired of constantly answering questions he could find very easily with a 3 second Google search, and due to all of this was asked to evac his things and leave Horde.   
---
He tried, we tried. It just didn't work.  
---
May God have mercy on whoever takes him in.

Best way to learn is to find someone to fly with you and help you out.

Big think

I don't know, go about your day and don't interact with or read anything from that person? If he isn't directly harassing you or otherwise impeding with your activities, what's the problem? Why do you require homogenity in opinions and behaviour in all sectors of life from everyone around you?
---
can add on that there was continuous talk of a couple bil in uncollateralized loans despite being told numerous times not to discuss loans in channels and that any advice given was basically ignored entirely

It's not the pod, it's how he lost it.

You should go look up his chat with Brisc about the CSM and how eve mirrors real life, and the goons are just duplicating real life politics in game and using them to oppress all the free thinking people like him in the game. In his head he's a combination of han solo and luke skywalker fighting off the imperial menace and goons are just the dumb little storm troopers he can out think in his sleep. Its like watching a slow motion train wreck, I know I should turn off the camera and dial 9-1-1 but I want a copy to rewatch later.

Oh ok fair enough. I don't watch inn too much to know. 
---
I think it's mildly interesting to see evidence of people rationalizing themselves victimhood in a situation they are consciously choosing to be part of for the sole purpose of harassing the people alleged to be victimizing them, regardless of context

It's an informative study of psychopathology at a safe distance, if nothing else

I can honestly understand why you dont watch INN tbh. Just an fyi though, Talking in Stations has their own twitch account/stream and they deliver news and such in a mostly unbiased manner.

Its not much of a grr goon thing for me. I like some of the people there but turn it off when boat and mittens show up because they are obnoxious people. I also don't like people constantly cutting each other to say things which happens a lot. I remember mar5hy being in there once with his calm personality and almost not speaking at all because he doesn't cut people and that's how people talk. Even rahne is a victim of that.

I am afraid it may be you who has trouble blurring lines if I need to qualify every phrase with (in-game) for you to recognize the distinction, friend

someone harassing you in game is not the same as harassing you irl, and therefore does not make him crazy irl

I don‚Äôt see why it matters.

I'll spell it out for you, too

Expecting to be able to hurt people in game while simultaneously expecting them not to be allowed to hurt you in game does make you crazy irl

Use the right fucking tools. Get into t1 cruiser logi at least.

It doesn't really. All member corps are treated equally in GSF as long as they are contributing. So to state just join to get in then move to one with tougher SP requirements is dumb. Those other corps don't offer anything more than what KF offers, and honestly, most don't even get to the level that KF does.

My main issue with cloaky camping is how much trouble small groups have combatting it.  A small neutral alliance just cannot carve out any space near a sizable alliance without NIPs on cloaky camping

Imagine playing eve online and not wanting to shoot goons.
---
Hypocritical reasoning and obsessiveness actually are like half the diagnostic criteria for a number of mental illnesses
---
He has crossed the line into real life much more than suspecting he might have some abnormal psychology does
---
For example, by posting a thousand word essay with the express intent of inciting thousands of people to harass some guy and linking his stream for them to do so (not in-game), and partaking in said harassment, then later the same fucking day while his thousand word essay is still on the front page arguing that he was in no way responsible
---
I'm honestly worried that between his obsession and distorted world view he is capable of taking this much further out of game than he has to date
---
I also haven't played the game in over a year, so please stop trying to suggest I am expressing this point of view because of an in-game affiliation
---
Of all the problems caps have that you could possibly complain about, complaining about how much *dreads* can rep is extremely dumb.
---
In wormhole space you can only bring 2-3 through a hole, and they function as force multipliers for your sub fleet. If they couldn't tank 30 subs and a dread, we would take faxes instead. Nobody (Wormholers, not random f1 pushing 'tards like you) complains about dreads being able to tank so much. In k-space, dreads are disposable and die fast so they're given cheap fits and buffer.
---
Dread tank is literally not a problem.

I'd say it's the main aspect in Eve. Everything you do in Eve usually affects other players in some way. Market/manufacture/pve you often compete against or with other players. Actually shooting other players is just one aspect of pvp. 
---
AND if you do happen to enjoy shooting virtual space ships: There are almost 500 different ships that you can use and endless amount of different options how to do space violence. Tactics &amp; tricks take years to understand and are extremely rewarding if you decide to learn them. Or you can just decide to sit inside a station and let others wage the wars for you and pay them for mercenary services. Or anything between.

I was wondering how long it would take for the issue of trust to come up. I'm kind of happy to see it was pretty much instantaneous as I wanted to address it early on.
---
I avoided requesting scopes about player assets on purpose. So I don't know any of the items you have, what ship you are currently flying or where you are currently located. I am requesting jump clone scopes because I intended to add a suggestion to the GUI to tell users when they aren't in their learning clones, but that feature isn't implemented yet. Using jump clone scopes could tell me where your jump clones are located. Of course my app knows your skills and skill queue as well, it needs that to show that information to you, so I know what ships you could be flying.
---
I store character's access and refresh tokens in my database in plaintext since that's the only way I can tie all characters together through EVE SSO alone. This means I could query any of the information I am showing in the GUI whenever I want as long as my application is still authorized. To address that, there's a link at the bottom of the page to EVE Online's "Manage 3rd party applications" page. This page lets you quickly remove my app's (and any other app's) access to your characters. Although this currently makes my webapp hysterically broken since it doesn't handle API failures due to deauth at the moment.
---
There's a cache on the EVE ESI API so that I don't download the same information over and over again. This is not persisted to disk and is only in RAM so I lose this when I restart the server, or when the data gets pushed out from being too old (which is currently set to 24hours I think). So I sort of store the data that is retrieved, but not for very long. I have some logs that show what API calls were made to the server from what IP addresses and these include character names, I haven't really thought about how long I'll store those yet.
---
Ultimately if you don't trust webapps then my webapp will never be a webapp you want to use, sorry. Releasing the source code doesn't prove it's the source code being used to run the live version of the site so every time you visit https://capsuleer.app you're trusting me with some of your data.
---
That was very punny
---
Who says I do? When someone says something I don't agree with or even find to be reprehensible why can I not give my opinion without it being labeled as an opinion I have solely in order to virtue signal? It kind of just seems like a way to dismiss someones opinion who disagrees with me.

Cloaky camping alone doesn't do anything. It only works if you're actually going to drop on things.

Imagine playing eve online and only killing people that are AFK.

---
0rign - former bl corp lmao
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has an issue with cloaks alone but rather the ability of a single player to shut down a region by being cloaked 23/7 and occasionally hot dropping the brave/stupid.             
---
             
---
It is completely risk free to leave an alt cloaked in a system all day whilst you go to work which doesn‚Äôt jell  with the your always at risk eve mentality.          
---
         
---
Even a 2 hour cycle on cloak would deal with the worst of it, not saying you should not be able to cloak to hunt just that you should need to at least be in the same room as your pc
---
Lmao, ur the best

I personally just spin a VNI to buy a ship here and there.  I just don't like the idea of a dwindling wallet.  I still have a couple hundred bil that I spend really slowly.

So, what should people do that want to buy ships in eve?  Solely buy plex on credit cards?  Won't you be there to call them a wallet warrior then though?

Maybe if you have to point out that he's Olmeca "Look at Me" Gold then you probably shouldn't give him the spotlight in the first place?
---
I think the reason you are getting so many salty replies is that people are salty that you injected. It seems like many people on this sub are of the opinion that injectors are killing eve. So when a newbie does it and completes what people have achieved after years thanks to their parents they get pretty jelly. But also keep in mind there's a lot of skill in eve that doesn't come from isk.

Reminder that if anyone has evidence of an application doing this they should confidentially contact either myself or team security. This would be a breach of the developer licence agreement and grounds for the organizations access to the ESI API to be revoked, possibly permanently.

Thing is its absolutely risk-free, Hit cloak and you are absolutely unkillable. Any other mechanic can be countered , but not this one. I myself do camping a lot for fat targets - but instead i get cheapfi VNIs and procurers at best left in system. If you want to decrease systems economic output it has to be active, risky gameplay, not risk-freee afk one

Just on a sidenote, you probably want either active rep (Armor repairers) OR armor plates, not both. If you do active repping, use Active Repair Charge for your command burst, I'm pretty sure that's always the most efficient one to use for active reps.

If they're in a coalition that has near-automated intel then it would be really easy to hook that up to your bot's logic. It's probably easier to have a bot read a NEAR intel stream than it is to have it dock up when someone enters local, tbh.

You don't need to 'combat' an afk character. That character isn't doing anything. If you were in J space you wouldn't even know he was there.

On a more serious note: depending on how long your break was you missed plenty of changes to ship balance and introduction of Triglavian ships. 
---
Currently it can be difficult to get fights in Lowsec. You have to look if you are better off in Black Rise or Minmatarr/Amarr FW area.
---
Generally good for roaming null or low are assault frigates, T3Ds, most pirate ships up to cruisers and the Triglavian destroyer. BC/BS and plenty of the T1/Faction/T2 cruisers can be good for roaming too, but you‚Äòd need to take a loot yourself what you like and how to make them work for you.
---
Current meta is kiting, except lowsec plexes where you have more choices. Brawling can be made work in null but you are much more likely to die fast.

Sometimes it‚Äôs good to have low expectations, you might get surprised eventually (hopefully).

If it wasn't blue to you then how are you supposed to know it's something not to shoot at? This is not your fault.

One question I could not dig answer to:
---
I am alpha account with 6.8 milion skill points. Which is quite above the 5 milion free skill point cap for alphas. But under the 20.5 milion cap for alphas overall.
---
What happens to the skill points when I get poded? lets say exploring wormhole system and being stupid enough to forgot bookmarking the exit.
---
In old times, any excess skill points vanished after being poded if the back up clone was not big enough to hold all skill points.
---
To the questions: 
---
If I get poded... Will my skill points drop to the 5 milion free cap? 
---
If I get omega, get above the 20.5 milion skill points, then revert to alpha and get poded... Will I lose the skill points above 20.5 cap?
---
In case both answers are no... does that mean that losing skill points as a mechanci was removed from the game?

Generally i give my alts 5m SP of PI, and reactions, then what's left gets dumped in to manufacturing/research.

You can have as many alpha (free) accounts as you want these days, you just can't log into an alpha account at the same time as any other account. So you can have as many characters as you want as long as you're prepared to slow train them to 5m SP.
---
You need a Jita trade alt and an out-of-corp logistics alt (although this latter is less important with the wardec changes). I use other alt character slots for seeding strategic wormholes, for station trading in the other hubs, and for FW, but you can use alts for anything which is inconvenient to do on your primary character.
---
Planetary plus scanning for both. For other roles I would suggest another account to have Alpha state and learning skills in parallel.

You wrote "unhappy with someones behaviour", which I interpret as "he shouldn't be able to say that". Of course you should state your opinion and why you think he is wrong.
---
The comment we're replying to now said "lol you're a racist", refering to his twitter (which I've never seen, I don't follow EvE personalities/drama closely), which has 0% relevance to the post of the OP. The OP wrote about why he is wrongly banned for RMT, in this post he mentioned zero things related to ethnicities he may or may not dislike. That is virtue signaling, simply throwing out political shit where it has no relevance simply to get a "us vs them" bandwagon going and whore for karma. This applies to both sides of the spectrum btw. 
---
If he had posted on why he hates eskimos, then absolutely you can argue against that and call him -isms that might be relevant and apply without it being virtue signaling.
---
Hope this clears up how I view it at least.

I am convinced that Goons are in love with Olmeca. I feel that 90% of the posts here concerning him are from Goons themselves.
---
It suggests several things:
---
* Goons must privately be talking about him *all the time*. There's no way that so many Goon line members are spontaneously thinking about him.
---
- Corollary to the above: his campaign certainly seems to be having a psychological effect, if it (I'm just guessing) is not as significant economically.
---
* He's the most famous person in Delve. When a rock star does or touches anything a small part of that mystique rubs off. People were willing to buy a damn throat lozenge from eBay because it had once touched Schwarzenegger's mouth. In this case Olmeca spoke in local and it's an event worthy of Reddit. If he were as insignificant as Goons wish he were I would never be hearing about him. I'm insignificant to Goons, almost every other player is insignificant to Goons, Olmeca is the subject of Goon's post every damn day on here.
---
Say what you want about Olmeca but dont pretend you're not all in love/obsessed with him. Objective evidence in the form of all your posts on here in which **you yourselves** are bringing attention to him and the literally trillions of damage he's inflicting on you say otherwise.
---
I better understand your point of view and will try to explain mine. I don't think disliking racists is a political point of view. Even if it might be used that way currently. I think viewing it that way is dangerous. Because it not so subtlety means that the left is anti-racist and the right is racist which I absolutely don't think is the case. I think if you find something or someone reprehensible in this case because of allegedly being racist( I also haven't seen anything to suggest this) You should be able to call someone out on it. I don't see this as automatically trying to karma whore. Although it is possible that was this persons motive. The thing I find stupid is the people upvoting him who I assume haven't seen what ever racist comments this guy has made. I truly do feel that some people use "virtue signaling" As a way to dismiss peoples opinions. I do apprecaite you taking the time and I can see where you are coming from. Because for sure what you are speaking on is real. There are people who post shit like that just for the attention or to virtue signal. The problem is its impossible to distinguish between that and someone who truly has a problem with something.

So, the thing you are going to have to know before doing what you plan to do, is that, like someone said earlier, Omega status is for one account. The issue is that characters on the same account can only train one at a time unless you but a multi character training license for one month which will apply to one other character slot on the account and is mildly cheaper than another plex. You will need to do that for each character on your account if you want all training queues active at the same time, otherwise you need to pause your main character in order to train one of the other ones. 
---
My suggestion would be, and it sounds like you are headed that direction, to have an industry character which would provide passive income. That way they won't be making isk hand over fist, at least at first, but it will be being made while you are not playing with that character which is value on it's own.

I can understand your feelings, its not fair...like going to brave and get dropped by 200 ecm ships, or go to fw space and get dropped by 300 merlins or  go to delve and get bosoned at every gate...lets just all stop playing.

Imagine being this upset over another persons intrests on reddit, or is this just another of Olmecas alt accounts? Go outside and get some fresh air either way, this is reddit and everyone shitpost about everything all the time.

It actually reminds me this:

The answer is no, the only way to lose SP anymore is to die in a T3 cruiser.
---
Wrong again
---
I have 2 accounts, first (with main) subbed all the time, second with capital alt has 500 plex on it and subbed immediately as needed and serves as SP farm when subbed.
---
1) main character (100mil SP) | main alt (62mil SP) in my alt corp which can run missions, produce some T1 stuff, trade, pvp | cyno, cloaked camper and whale hunter alt (30mil SP) in noob corp
---
2) Capital alt (130mil SP, actually it can fly almost everything except some small T2 and T3 hulls) | PI character with some ships trained (20 mil SP) | cyno alt (9 mil SP) in noob corp
---
Jesus christ Test, you have 40k chars zerged and you're running bomber fleets, do something noteworthy already.
---
Kind of disappointing.
---
Would have hoped for quality propaganda. Really thought TEST would be capable of something more... extraordinary. 
---
well, it¬¥s about the only genuine content a lot of the gon smoothbrains ever experienced in their lands of milk, honey, artificial PvP shenanigans and instant gratification. they just can¬¥t wrap their heads around how or why people would even do such things. 
---
What‚Äôs your point? 
---
He actually has way more good ideas than 99.5% of the other posts to this forum and actually gives his opinion about things and why it should be changed or examined. The whine posts are another story, but nonetheless he does more for the community than your average meme post or dinoposter.
---
Nice meme Blades of Grass.
---
Almost as good as that meme when you lost the titan in UALX after your buddies "forgot" to tell you they aren't logging back in after the server crash.
---
Good advice. Only bad thing he's CEO, Diplo and Alliance leader. :'D

You can always fight back, by always dying to them you build their confidence, they likely wont be expecting a counter-play.

I'm disappointed. I expected more creative story from legacy to end NIP
---
Oh... I figured the answer would be, "Unfuck Eve Online". Or "Invest in the company again".
---
But yea, no,  RL version of a space-soda, sure, why the fuck not. Maybe finally also allow us to buy a minute of invulnerability in-game with actual dollars. Maybe a 100 PLEX per minute?
---
Only if you're a massive idiot. To literally anyone who isn't in legacy it's just shooting targets.

Literal megabytes? I'd like to see that.

I have one account too, i have mine setup as follows
---
1 main, combat and pve ships
---
2 indy, purely mining and production focussed, with an aim to also get a carrier, for a goto pve toon
---
3 explorer, great with covops, now working towards loki and then blops battleships, also functions as the jita market character
---
All three are also doing pi
---
It's called nullsec.
---
The ramjag is so dumb just as other past and present q-click scram blob options but ccp prefered instantly nerfing the retribution instead somehow. You know you have a problem when the best antitackle ships in the game can‚Äôt kill a ramjag before getting scrammed and can‚Äôt even finish it in one clip. You can also make stupid ramvagabonds but nobody uses them because a jag is cheaper and better but I guess they will be next once ccp nerfs the jag in 2 years.
---
Seriously, Assault damage control was mistake.
---
CCP could‚Äôve make Assfrigs and Asscruisers viable by just buffing their stats and adjusting slot layouts, without introducing bad new mechanic.
---
Of course assault damage control is very fun when I‚Äôm using it, and personally I abuse it a lot, but It‚Äôs far from balanced and unhealthy for game.
---
At least it must be tweaked like reducing it‚Äôs active time and cooldown, 
---
so ppl can‚Äôt ram with their ADC on and make ppl able to run additional cycle when using it right, rewarding skilled player.
---
What? Sure there is. If they drop on you you kill them. It's not hard to bait a drop, and if they don't drop then they aren't really camping, they're just hanging out in local with you.
---
This post already covered that base
---

---
You could stash dreads in a mid and log them off till needed
---
Nice almost makes me want to play again. 
---
It's fantastic for cruisers, but dumb af for frigates. 
---
The god module is decent on cruisers tbh and make actually interesting fleet fights but it‚Äôs a complete nonsense to have invulnerability modules on ceptor speed tiny sig tank bonused frigs. Who would have thought?
---
When the Fc asks how much tank that rev has. I say 2 plates and the number of Moros and nags we have.
---
Tanking carrier fighters and bs guns is fine and very eveish mechanic of small vs to big but tanking dedicated anti tackle cruisers to the point of making them useless is a complete balance failure.
---
Lolololol, could not be farther from the truth. Largest super capital fleet in the entire game on a corporate level is KarmaFleet.
---
Link fit pls
---
Yeah assault frigates have all arguably been over-buffed with the introduction of the ADC, but the jag is particularly ridiculous. When dedicated anti-tackle fits can't kill tackle, you know it's gone too far.
---
Then why join the largest alliance in the game? There is zero difference between the amount of people you interact with from KF to DogFort.
---
Ya I have been playing with reps on this ship I will go pure and see if that helps me I had it full plate fit and it was cool to se 20ehp in armor but it did not do to hot.

IK I'm a recruiter too. Just saying not to lead with that. And there is more than kf in goons. God forbid this guy comes across scooter
---
It's strange looking back, but over Goons have almost always had at least one person in Eve that is ganged up on to direct their boredom/frustration. Though these people usually revel in the attention.
---
Yeah. Cynos are the problem, not cloaky campers. If cloakies were an issue then wormhole space wouldn't be liveable.

How much of a coward do you have to be to allow a single player to shut down a whole region? This sounds wildly exaggerated.

IIRC, all you can expect is 100% reprocessing

I am thinking from the point of view that I used to be in social mining fleets and it would be good to have a composition of ship depending on how developed the mining toons are.
---
Sorry single player with a bunch of alts. If losing a ship wipes your days earnings and they establish they are able to blops in then most people dock up or reduce activity.                
---

As its blops theres not a lot of counterplay options for a smaller entity, even large groups struggle to meaningfully use space under a cloak camp.

You may as well pay your in game name here once you make one.
---
Eve players are surprisingly generous with new players as long as you're not completely toxic when you get blown up.
---
Ask whomever pops your ship for tips on how you could have avoided them. Generally you'll get good advice, sometimes you'll get enough ISK to replace your ship, and on occasion you'll end up with a mentor/mentee and a great friend.
---
actually he'd have probably been better off being afk, he waltzed right into my optimal range with zero transversal
---
Own it! See how much damage you can do.

Fun fact: this mentality is why goons are so powerful. It was the mentality most elite pvp alliances has until they saw they were bleeding their industrial backbone to goons and later test when they quickly adapted.

It doesn't counter `kitey bullshit` as that usually comes with multiple anti-tackle ships and ranged control. It counters any sort of comp that wants to sit anywhere between hard kiting with mass RLML/Jackdaws and q-clicking with 500k EHP Lokis.
---
I don't see why you're worrying so much. In another 6 months we'll have a mother of all balance patches come out and the Jag will get that impactful -5 PG nerf.

The most recent coalition list I could find with most of the big players: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9rtnex/updated\_coalition\_list\_october\_2018/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9rtnex/updated_coalition_list_october_2018/)
---
2018 started with the famous "Million Dollar Battle" that made it to a lot of mainstream media but really wasn't that big of a deal in my opinion: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZxS73ItQUY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZxS73ItQUY)
---
Summer 2018 was pretty busy starting with a war in the south that escelated into what would [become basically a world war](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8z0d4c/an_outsiders_guide_to_the_war/). The war in the south also led to the [keepstar battle of ualx](https://imperium.news/breaking-news-ualx-3-keepstar-titan-fight/) with I believe the first major titan brawl since the bloodbath of b-r.
---
After the war in the south came to closure the southern forces deployed their supercapital fleet north and laid siege to the northern territory eventually resulting in [another huge titan brawl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEq8J2l7qGA) and the death of multiple Keepstar class citadels in the north.
---
Since then it has been rather quiet and everyone focuses on rebuilding or expanding their supercap fleets. Of course there is a shitton of information and a lot of details missing but I believe I covered the most important bits.
---
I'm sorry your personal beliefs and morals are shaken by this.
---
Please harden the fuck uo
---
thanks dad?
---
It's the opposite for me. After a break I'm super careful with everything, but as keep playing I get more careless and comfortable.
---
People already raged about instanced pve/pvp.. What you're considering doing is basically matchmaking for PvP by filtering out a specific group of people
---
I think the game is more enjoyable that way. Not being super careful about everything. I've lost more ships afk on undocks or gates than I'd like to admit. 
---
I used to feel bad about losses, but then I realized that nobody else ever really looks at your killboard anyway. Losing ships literally doesn't matter.
---
I've said several times the diplos are the cancer killing eve. Nip's are in my opinion a key reason for the shit quality of so many fc's in goons. Just no where to draw a fight easily. 
---
Ya ya obligatory leave goons. Too many friends though
---
It is exactly the same as the current model of FW complexes. It just extends it to Alphas. I see the FW model as a successful one ...UNTIL the advent of Alphas...why not fix it?
---
I got 4 accounts currently.
---
Account 1 is my primary account. My main toon on it is a generalist when it comes to flying ships. It can fly all T1 Subcaps, all T2+ frigs and destroyers, some T2+ Cruisers, some capitals.
---
I'm slowly converting it to a capital pvp alt. 2nd and 3rd toons are cyno/PI/Indy slot characters.
---
2nd account main toon is slowly becoming my sub cap pvper, it started as a market alt though. 2nd toon is the CEO of a holding corp and also my Highsec Incursion Runner. Also has market skills. 3rd toon is an NPC corp Covert cyno hunter.
---
3rd account is a utility account. 2 of the toons are for alliance/coalition services like fueling structures, logi cynos, investigating bots and recruiting. 3rd character is a titan pilot.
---
4th account is nothing but spai alts.
---
Between ship types has always been accepted. Between player types is where the line is drawn for most. You shouldn't get special treatment as an alpha as you have literally no investment in the game. Omega players should have access to everything
---
thanks, I will check that out!
---
Ccp will never make that move as it would basically mean removing a feature. But ccp could consider nerfing the jaguar base traits hard but buffing the wolf that‚Äôll is still in dire need of love so people would have a fast minmattar af to play with.
---
None of the limits on Alphas would be changed. The reward for such sites could be 50% of regular sites. But it would allow for a smooth transition from the shallow end of the pool to the deep end.
---
of the 3 slots:
---
1. Main pilot
---
2. jita alt
---
3. blank
---
The real fun in eve is with friends. Flying with both skilled and un skilled guys trying to accomplish something. When isk becomes meaningless you can either help the peasants... or become a bitter vet who complains about titan killmarks. Now that I can buy fleets to hand out for Corp mates and just go for fun eve is pretty much always a good time
---
If they are cloaked and unkillable, they can't do anything to you.
---
i think that on assault frigs the ADCU should come with speed penalties instead of just 15s of pure super-saiyan.
---
The counter is be ready to fight the drop...not big enough? Call someone who is there is always someone who wants to give them a black eye or anyone a blackeye.
---
NPC null missions are usually behind an acceleration gate, which provides a degree of safety that anoms don't. Not directly comparable.
---
T2 light and medium drones are available for Alphas
---
Tell us how you really feel!
---
i have passive income trained on my 2 spare character slots. they have buildings, reaction and science slots all opened along with PI on each. i wouldn't really train any core skills on them as doing something on your combat character then having to switch over and salvage loses a lot of efficiency. any skills that can be used while not on that character would be best, unless it's specialized like gas huffing. i also wouldn't put a hauler on the same account as you would want 2 accounts anyways to scout out a path to where its going.
---
They will never change because ccp doesn't even know how to delete them at this point.
---
Can that run t4's? I blew a ton of money on a sacrilege just to say I had a use for this ship. Can't be asked to get another though after how it died
---
Plenty of other eve players wear suits... Their birthday suits
---
Citadels. I know for sure i woulr never have bought a super carrier or a titan under the old system. Now i can dock its changed the game
---
1. Main - pvp and trading skills
---
2. Trader
---
3. Trader (and cyno for inevitable capital second account)
---
We will just say I like to put my deadspace loot drops on my strat
---
Although I'm alp for cloaky camping, it doesn't make sense to me cloaking is a cap stable module.   Shake it up ccp.  Imagine 'safe' supers only being so for an hour,and then NOT being able to jump out?   That would be flipping great.
---
I know a joecuster covert operation when I see one. Knock it off Joe. 
---
i lol'd at smoothbrain
---
&gt;Well, its the perfect tackle until ships with guns arrive.
---
we need Ore ships that give hull reps
---
What tz do you play? They‚Äôre in good shape and we‚Äôre recruiting some time zones
---
Only thing they are strapped for are good ideas 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôve lost a lot in Eve too; my prob is tho I know you only fly what you can lose, my wallets are only so deep. And after so long... I have to start pinching pennies if you know what I mean. 
---
I've always thought they should release new null systems connected to current high sec space that have jump gate limits in ship type. Frigate hulls only. Crusiers and below. Battleships and below. The problem with your scenario is that not all alphas are new players. 
---
So you want a snowflake zone..... no!
---
I am out of the loop... What is this post referring to... 
---
yeah WTF, why don't anti-battleship weapons apply to sig-bonused frigs, it's a CAPITAL SHIP. if anything, fighters should have an ADCU, but CCP is reliant on subs from OP cloaky campers and beholden to nanotards, so they would never, EVER do that 
---
This joke is as old as the FRT allience
---
Thats some racist shit hes saying.
---
After 16 years of playing why is it that the ship I use most in high sec is my Blockade Runner?
---
&gt; which is okay, because it's allowed to be used for some forms of gameplay.
---
Which forms of gameplay? 
---
With maxed alpha clone skills and a couple of 20 mil shield implants I finished them almost exactly 15 mins. I always ran exotics. 
---
Look man.
---
Interfering with Legacy attempting to do Sov/structure related stuff in Legacy space was clear a violation of the NIP.
---
Would the structure have died we're it not for your involvement? Most likely. So whether you intended to or not, you covered for the structure anchoring.
---
If you just wanted to get fights and shoot neutrals, maybe you shouldn't have joined an alliance living under a NIP provided as terms of a surrender.  Just a thought.
---
Not that it matters, it was a shit NIP anyway, and most of Test would have been perfectly happy crushing FRT back to serenity 6 months ago.  I get that we got paid, and that not killing FRT and giving them some time to rebuild has set us up for more Gee Effs now, but still, I don't think many of us care one way or the other.
---
A wild Puchoco appeared!
---
Cool thanks man, may give them another go. Been doing them in groups with Corp but occasional solo is fun too 
---
It's pronunced "showderr"
---
They don't understand because they are ultra space rich. Losing a single days earnings doesn't cripple their ability to operate so they don't see it as a problem.
---
Alpha exclusive content is just another way to divide the player base
---
Isn't that ok? We also want to develop the level of engagement of casuals, so that they get the point of deeper commitment.
---
What do you call Highsec?
---
Found the home defense fleet member that can‚Äôt be arsed to figure an actual counter to ‚Äúkitey bullshit‚Äù and thinks he needs cancer ships for that. ‚ÄúKitey bullshit‚Äù is not even good it just takes advantage of naive people that think that the best way to fight is ramming the ennemy with a big kitchensink blob, get overconfident and die separated from the rest. Even then with correct tools mixed in like a few damps or long webs the kitchensink blob can actually get a very decent shot at juicy killmails. Kitey bullshit straight up dies to similar numbers of most of current meta ships unless they are completely unsupported as pretty much all current doctrines now apply at 50km minimum. Long gone is the time of the solo orthrus solo kitey ab blaster cruisers. The reason roamers use kitey bullshit is because they have no other option as fighting in web/scram range means that you‚Äôll die to the first cyno and can‚Äôt disengage in time. You don‚Äôt counter kitey bullshit with ramjags you just force it to be even more kitey and slippery and thus even more risk averse.
---
&gt; Losing ships literally doesn't matter.
---
And that doesn't seem like a problem to you? One of biggest things that sets this game apart from others is that when you lose a ship, it's gone forever. Actions have consequences that aren't limited to "oh darn, now I have to respawn".
---
Losing ships *should* matter. You *should* feel bad about losses. Not in a "this guy's killboard is so bad" way, but in a "I fucked up, and I need to be better" kind of way. Making ships meaningless makes the whole draw of eve for PVPers meaningless.
---
Sadly I'd say the way of the game is afk vni ratting graduated to carrier rating. Or an alt afk vni ratting while doing other stuff. I unfortunately followed the vni, carrier, supercarrier path to rorqs. Makes isk irrelevant now but does take away some of the struggle in eve for sure. What do you enjoy most in eve? An hour of ratting or abyssal or exploration can pay for most cruisers and below for fun pvp
---
And by the way, you could also think of this as "Bait". Don't you want more players to leave the security of Highsec?
---
google it
---
Terrible idea 
---
I look at it the other way. If you want to make isk in big old dangerapace then there should be significant risk. If people dont like that theres plenty of other ways to make isk
---
[Have done some of that.](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114827546/)
---
Manufacturing and trading is where you can really break out the cash. Almost all other activities are limited by the actions of one character over time in one location.
---
In my case, it is why I lost the ship that is my problem. The lack of care entirely. I could be playing solitaire just as easily as EVE on the other screen.
---
He didn't die tho
---
Cloaky camping is cancer
---
I have seen and said worse than that.
---
Htfu nerd
---
i have always felt that having a character gather intel (cloaked off a staging citadel) should cost SOMETHING
---
Have you heard about the Sentinel?
---
It can neut the jag out at 45km. There is also this pretty cool ship called the Rapeir, it has these super long webs that slow shit down, its pretty neat.
---
cool cool :)
---
Preventing Legacy from killing a structure in Legacy space, whether intentional or not, is defending it.
---
there are no 500kehp lokis, you just made yourself look dumb
---
Jin'taan approves. 
---
I don't care that there is gonna be war. Why do you think we joined Frt - to bear? We're here for the war. 
---
You, on the other hand, are part of an alliance that needs a narrative to fight. It's not enough that you play the video game. You have to be aggrieved. You have to have your leadership stand up and say "these guys are the bad guys! We must fight!" Then you have the legion of dinoposters come out and say "well obviously it was your structure. If it wasn't, obviously you covered for it anchoring. And even if you didn't, who cares? We were gonna fight anyway." It's sad. Re-read your own post. You start by arguing that clearly this war is our fault, and finish by arguing that everyone wants to fight it. 
---
Just skip the narrative. Fight because it's fun. Stop being manipulated.
---
Olmeh-who?
---
I'm fairly certain I didn't give a fuck about the AT when betting was allowed either.
---
To be fair, people cared about the betting, not the AT.
---
i remember a ram jag pilot got super angry because i put ecm drones on him and he had no guns to kill them
---
For someone who "doesn't care about narrative", you sure care a lot about narrative.
---
If you really didn't care, you would just say " yeah, we broke the NIP, so fuck you".  Instead you've written eleventy million posts about "grr narrative".
---
My point was only to call out the logic flaw in trying to claim you didn't defend the structure.  You defended that shit, and are here trying to claim you didn't for narrative.
---
Have you tried just killing the blops? We found that quite effective in our area.
---
The devs are on record as saying that hull reps are bad intentionally because this lets them make passive hull tanks very strong without having to worry that they'll get OP and out of hand, so that's not going to happen.
---
A few more types of industrial ships under the ORE banner would be fine, though. I don't think I've seen the suggestion for a small jump transport before, that's actually a pretty cool idea I think. Personally I've always wanted an ORE medium transport that's basically the 't1 battlecruiser' of industrials, being larger and tankier than the existing t1-cruiser equivalent industrials but still cheap and much smaller than the existing large industrials - basically something to fill the enormous gap in cost and capability between the t1 indys and BRs/DSTs/orcas/freighters.

I remember when snuff dropped 12 titans on our condor fleet... " good tumble "
---
After the war ended Pandemic Horde rejected the peace accords and attacked GotG (who was a PanFam ally during the war). The deployment is relatively successful as a punitive action.  
---
However, while Horde was distracted by that deployment TEST took the opportunity to attack their market hubs outside of Jita. They (we) anchored Tranquility Trading Towers, the first hisec keepstar, and started a trade war that is ongoing.  
---
On the Eastern front TRI was getting their shit pushed in by SkillU (also formerly allies in the war) and lost most of their holdings. Black Legion joined Fraternity and helped them bulk up their USTZ presence.  
---
Oh, and the Initiative secretly invaded Rage (the wormhole home to Hard Knocks) and killed the first keepstar that was ever put down.  
---
As of last night the NIP (peace agreement) between TEST and Fraternity was called off, so war is brewing in the southeast. It has the potential for a repeat of the summer war of 2018 but we'll see what happens.
---
It does, 500 plex a month.

Those political maps are properly known as sov maps. They document the control of sovereign nullsec space, which is the only space in the game with a mechanic for player ownership. Sov null exists around the periphery of the map; it's found in the most of the [white systems here](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map). Though it's possible for players and alliances to claim any area of space, sov null is the only one with an official in-game mechanic back it up. Null is where the major power blocs tend to live due to the high value of the space.
---
Wow this is so stupid it makes my head hurt..... If someone wanted to join space for quiet afk ratting/botting, why would anyone chose the hottest region in space with the most danger of continiously dying? For botting i'd join goons...
---
if they don't, boson that rorqs drones next time he parks there.
---
Except calling a counter fleet, and then friends for that counter fleet... and then nothing. AFK cloaker is out at the bar or playing some other game and hasn't noticed.  
---
Meanwhile you've got dozens of dudes basicly waiting on you ratting.  
---
It's an incredibly boring setup for a very maybe thing.  
---
What does work? Umbrella organizations who have enough people to chill on standby. Yes most people have adapted, most have done so by joining large groups to get safe space. That's part of the complaint.

You wouldn‚Äôt believe how many asteros use either a full flight of EC-300s or just t2 warriors but no DDA/Armor rep
---
Oh, you mean while there was a massive brawl right next door at the same time?
---
We have low cost jump ships; they are called backpack carriers.  You're not going to get anything jump capable for less than that.
---
Blockade runners can use covert bridges.  Hell you can fit a decent amount of small items into a blops and jump that.
---
Any hauler can use a titan bridge.  A bit expensive; but it doesn't have to be YOUR titan that is making the bridge.
---
And the whole thing doesn't make sense as ORE does not field combat ships of any variety.  They have no use for a ship that can only travel to lowsec and null.  They have no use for a repair boat, as they don't need to repair anything; they aren't combat ships.
---
&gt;but I'll PM you the link to the comment the next time someone posts one.
---
Yep, please do.
---
Sorry I didn't look up the exact EHP of guardian/damnation/loki fleet
---
`Counter-comp around a 40m frigate, dedicating 3+ ships to countering it`
---
Just because you can counter comp with max kitey bullshit doesn't mean it's balanced. What if I don't want to fly an unfightable with neuts, 100km webs and 2+ orthruses?
---
its around 130k
---
It's closer to 250
---
yeah 500
---
you dont need three. The Senintel alone will screen it. If that is too expensive, a single intie with its 12km scram will keep that jag away.
---
At a guess, you've reached the limits of your ability to drive yourself with an unrestricted goal of "make isk". It's time for a new project. Find something that "it'd be cool if...". Bonus points if you can't yet imagine how you would actually do it. Start planning.
---
As Brave Diplo, I am glad the reddits inform me about all the things. :) 
---
Okay dude so you're making a bunch of assumptions again..
---
&gt;*It could be argued that Null corps and WH corps will take Alphas in some cases*. But, WH corps and Null Corps can be a LOT of work / commitment and in both cases, NOT being an Omega is EXTREMELY LIMITING...no cloaks, bombs, bubbles, etc.
---
All major alliances will take alphas and actively recruit them. Even non-aligned entities like RvB and E-Uni take and train alphas. You also don't *need* to be able to fly bombers or interdictors to be effective in a fleet. There's also close to zero commitment in those groups.
---
&gt;So, what happens often is that these Alphas will get exposed to FW since it is right next door to Highsec.
---
Where are you drawing this conclusion from?
---
&gt;Unfortunately, FW is really punishing / discouraging if you are a solo Alpha
---
Where are you drawing this conclusion from? Alphas have access to T2 small and medium weapons, T1 and faction frigates through battleships, and T2 tank and damage control mods. They can also use drugs and hardwirings that require up to Cybernetics 3 (So most hardwirings). Nothing about those are extremely punishing or discouraging to alpha players. If you even stepped foot in faction warfare lowsec space you'd see the amount of faction frigates being flown.
---
&gt;Pirates bring only hard counters to your fit from one system over.
---
This isn't exclusive to being an alpha, anyone can literally get countered by anyone. Again, if you actually roamed any of the warzones, you'd know what group likes to bring what and who are actual solo players and who likes to bait with a punisher in the novice while having a cloaked arty loki 20km off from the gate.
---
&gt;So, why not have complexes that are exclusively Dedicated to Alphas?
---
Because it's absolutely not necessary and would increase the number of farmers and bots because now there's even more guarantee that they won't get harassed. You even said it yourself, oh expert of FW lowsec: *"Farmers / bots run from everything."*
---
&gt;Additionally, why not consider eliminating stations from large swaths of FW space. This would get rid of the "I only fly hard counters in 1v1 attitude".
---
Literally how, when anyone can drop a citadel and put anyone they want on the ACL? What do you do with all the mission agents then? How are you going to entice these poor newbies to make LP when they PvP? Orbiting a beacon for 10 minutes waiting for another alpha to come in?
---
This post reads like someone who has never stepped foot in either warzone and just had some good idea fairy whisper some nonsense in their ear.
---
yeah 130
---
Completely empty, whenever I go there nobody is in local.
---
fuck
---
A single sentinel won't be enough to cover for a gang, it will get forced off by jackdaws constantly. You would need at least 2x Orthrus to not be super weak to Jags.

I like the idea of a small jump transport.
---
It would be good to have a ship that be the transport link between highsec and deep null for small entities.
---
Large entities already use JF's/citadel chains/NIP's to secure their transportation routes and can fight to secure their trade link with highsec.
---
I always felt drone lands would be a good place for small independent groups to grow, but its so damn hard to get supplies out there.
---
Covert bridging blockade runners is the closest thing to what would be needed, but that requires a lot of alts and sp for cyno 5/br/blops bridge.
---
While a dedicated mini jump freighter would be interesting, we already have those.
---
A suitcase revelation can store 35,000m3 of stuff plus 1,000,000m3 of assembled ships for like, 15% of the cost of a jump freighter.
---
Also the hull rep idea looks good on paper, but as one who uses the brutix a lot, it would make it so OP that CCP would probably just nerf it.
---
holy fuck the goon damage control
---
what about small corps or solo player? a small corp or single player dont got a titan. a carrier cant go into high sec. Covert bridges take a massive amount of skill time, cost and 3+ accounts.
---
ore industrial command ships can rep shield and are good for combat
---
I care about the narrative. I don't need it to fight. I care that this game is populated by people who often view fighting through the lense of the narrative their leaders told them was true and not because they are playing a video game where fighting is fun. We could be having a lot more fun if we fought people because it was fun and not some holy crusade.
---
i've done that before as well, he died. Then he reshipped into an arazu
---
The issue is that a weaponless Jag not only can go ceptor speed, but it can also easily tank an orthrus clip, deflect retri beams, and when it finally gets it's tank stressed it gets 20s where it's near unkillable.
---
Thanks. I won't use it as long as it's not running on a computer that I control.
---
And when is the last time you saw more then 2 jaguars attacking a small group? Jaguars are good hard tackle, but you rarely have to deal with more then 1 or 2. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/lMUd2Q4.png Shit.
---
I think highsec can be as dangerous as any other area of space if someone wants you dead... no one should have a safer area which disallows others in. Eve is a difficult game if an alpha can‚Äôt get that then they won‚Äôt stay long no matter what happens. 
---
No. 
---
Do you know how to tell when someone doesn't care about the subject and only plays devil's advocate for the sake of trolling? It's all the personal attacks and ridicule that gives it away. 
---
If CCP is closing your tickets there are 100% sure that you had something to do with RMT.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have given back the money and just tell CCP your story from the beginning instead of waiting till its too late ;)
---
Giving 100b to a person who is probably RMT'ing is really suspicious.
---
That's all fair and I can't have any expectations or demands on how you're spending your free time and making a product for free, however as far as I'm concerned this falls right in the service-as-a-software-substitute category and I'm not alone with this so unfortunately the audience you'll ultimately reach will be limited. I wish you all the best though.

Last time I went to:
---
Catch
---
Deklein
---
Geminate
---
The other regions greeted me with a HIC and a cyno instead.
---
Marcus Catiline wants to know your location
---
And if you are above the 20.5 mil alpha sp and revert back to alpha, the skills alphas can‚Äôt train become useless, but you can still extract them or get omega again.
---
I think there is an unmet niche for small low sp groups that could be filled.
---
We have a ton of under used space in deep null, one of the main challenges of accessing these areas is transport.
---
Having dedicated ships to fill this role might make more entities to try their hand at nullsec without joining a mega blob.
---
They can be worse at most things than the current high sp alternatives. Though without a citadel network these ships will need to be able to cloak in space.
---
Very well put
---
I hear a lot of new players saying they‚Äôre a ‚Äú1 account type of player‚Äù and I believe this stems from other games where you have an illogical ‚Äúattachment‚Äù to your characters. In EVE characters are just like ammo, you use them to fly a ship or do a thing. You can buy them for a use, then sell them when you‚Äôre done. 
---
You‚Äôll get frustrated with this game if you limit yourself to one account, i have 1 ‚Äúmain‚Äù character that I‚Äôve had since 2010. The other 7 accounts and 23 characters I‚Äôve all bought on the character bazaar or trained up as alpha‚Äôs. I buy and sell as needed. 
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is, don‚Äôt artificially make the game harder for yourself by saying ‚ÄúI only want 1 account‚Äù it‚Äôs not like you have to pay for them with IRL cash, you can plex them all in-game (or buy them off the character bazaar and then skill farm them to almost cover the monthly plex costs)
---
C5 wormhole corp Sinner's Trajectory is recruiting 
---
Try faction warfare for destroyer down pvp. Join Amarr because we're the best...
---
Is the stratios capable of wormhole/null sec exploration /site running or am I better of ignoring combat sites with my astero and coming back with a gila ?
---
Are you saying you want a highsec capable jump?  That will never happen for so many obvious reasons.  You can jump out of highsec - never in.
---
Don't kill the game we have. Nerfing the cyno would create more small gang fights, a higher demand for FC's and less tidi. 
---
HK got evicted by spodbrains so everyone with a Keepstar in J Space unanchored and relocated to c2 C5/NS holes. Everything else is ruskies with 30 Athanors or Krab holes.
---
Of all the mistakes I made in that fight, over repping was not one of them
---
ISK never mattered. The mostly beaten learning curve and the "rush" were what grabbed me.
---
Teach me sensei
---
My choices were to give the ISK back or not loan for 6 months. 
---
This is not realistic as having a speed penalty on adc will ruin fleet use and make you deanchor on ice block. Also for tackle use you will just be able to heat mwd then adc and get carried by your inertia like you do with t3ds.
---
You're the only person talking about jumping into highsec.
---
Well new players don't have 4 billion ISK to spend on game time every month, so kinda have to spend money and for me, I don't think i'm prepared to spend 30$ a month on a game yet.
---
Revelations can‚Äôt go to hisec though, and have a lot of docking restrictions
---
Battlestar Galactica 
---
Why the fuck would a jump capable ship need to cloak?  If you're jumping a fucking transport to open space you're retarded.
---
There is no problem with projection to dead end areas, all you need to do is get a cyno out there; no one does because there is no value in a dead end worthless null pocket.
---
I would highly advise against the use of jump capable ships by new players.  They are juicy, expensive targets.  And without a lot of experiwnce you're going to walk into traps... Like thinking a jump capable ship should have a cloak lol.
---
You don‚Äôt right now, but assuming you don‚Äôt stay in High-Sec that will change in the next 6 months or so. 
---
Also remember if you go from 1 toon to 2 you can double your ISK/hr. Additionally, the second toon wouldn‚Äôt be a full plex as you can skill farm on them for the majority of the cost. 
---
Then they decloak and drop their fleet on you with about 3 seconds of warning. Anoms don't have to be scanned down so mashing Dscan doesn't warn you about probes.
---
That's what makes cloaky campers effective.
---
Show me the personal attacks against you. Me ridiculing your poorly thought out idea isn't a personal attack against you...

Yes, the praxis is a beautiful ship for running sites. It‚Äôs cheap (&gt;200mil), It has enough tank to survive c3s, (put t2 large extenders in mids, power relays in the lows, missiles to taste, rhmls and cruise both work, t1 purger rigs). With my skills it gets around 730 dps tank, and I‚Äôm an alpha. it gets a probe bonus, so scanning is also good, and it has a big cargo, so you can carry refits. Doesn‚Äôt clear c3s as good as a rattle, but a rattle costs a lot more.

I'm attacking his ideas based on his inexperience at the subject matter at hand which is evident through this "fix FW &amp; lowsec" post. It's similar to when Fuzzy Steve posted his idea on a small, independent group grabbing sov in current year - those ideas and scenario made it evident steve never had any experience in the area he was proposing changes in.
---
now, a personal attack woulda been if i cussed at him or called him dumb directly or what have you. i'm sure meastgood a smart fella but this idea of fixing FW is just bad.

they are in the real world too

why is it everytime there is a good tackle ship (like you need to sacrifice fkin everything for it to be really good) people cry about it, why do you think there should be absolutely no low-skill counter to kiting, what makes you think that the fact you can kite well means that you should be impervious to getting caught, i know for example that a 500mn HIC is technically a bad idea, but why should a minmatar frig, the race that has the fastest ships not be able to get high speeds and tackle well, its all minmatar have, ACs are shit cruiser and above, they are the least tanked race and their whole idea is "bring speed". Stop being whinny wussies and learn to adapt, have better screen for enemy tackle, be it webs neuts or counter scrams. If there are 20 jags and 100 jackdaws guess what, you will die anyway

Goons / Imperium the south-west. Former masters of the north, who had been rebuilding very succesfully after losing WWB. They are now back at having the largest super-capital fleet in the game by far, combined with the largest sub-capital numbers and also the best rate of replenishing losses. Very well organized,  both militarily and economically. Not the best pilots, never claimed to be "elite" either, they win wars by throwing enough vurtual money at problems to everwhelm any opposition. Very good at metagaming as well, from legitimately impressive diplomacy to very shady, underhanded and borderline creepy black-ops crap. Very, very good at propaganda as well.
---
Test / Legacy down south. Former adversaries of Goons, now frenemies, helping each other in big wars, being neutral otherwise. The second largest coalition number-wise, very decent with their super-capital fleets, capable of facing off most adversaries even on they own. Legacy also dabble in diplomacy almost as good as Goons, presenting the public image of very "official-like" professionalism when it comes to agreements. Not as heavily propagandist as Goons, Test do enjoy a fair share of creative narrative writing from their leadership as well, which can be viewed with disdain by some, but is a vety important part of the game and provides a lot of entertainment value for everyone involved or lurking.
---
NC/PL, aka North. Ancient adversaries of Goons, combining their former allies with anyone disliking goons or various hangers-on after WWB was finished. Historically comprising of alliances priding themselves for being good at PvP or being efficient on killboards, the core of the coalition draws ire from non-elitist entities of the game, viewing them as snobish, "head-in-the-cloud", content-denying, KB-over-fun, not as good as advertised alliances etc. While formidable in even grounds, they often have been known to either deploy overwhelming forces to counter their enemies, or refuse to fight when being outnumbered. At the moment the coalition is on a downswing, while still managing to hold onto their space up north, they lack numbers to fight Goons even on their own, not adding Test to the mix. Nowhere near as good at metagaming as Goons and having rather patchy diplomacy when compared to others, the North still have the second largest super-capital fleet in the game and are able to field very solid sub-capital fleets as well.
---
The East... is very devided. Fraternity (initially comprising mostly of refugees from the chinese server, now also have multiple EU and NA elements) posing as the main player in the region, they don't really have the numbers or the diplomscy to face off any other coalition on their own at the momemt, and the entire eastern part of the game had always been either Russian or in shambles. The Russians have strong historical connections with the eastern regions, always returning there to establish yet another ru-coalition, begore it falls apart yet again in some sort of civil war. Anyone else rarely stays for long. The last Russian coalition holfing the soace had split a few years ago, with the losing side retreating south-west and the winners following them some time later, after losing to SkillU, Fraternity, Triumvirate and others, after a lpng drawn war on multiple fronts. Now the holders of the Eastern regions split again, pursuing content over stability, and the Russians are coming back, backed by Legacy. At the same time
---
With the North turtling up, Imperium stopping their offensive and Legacy returning home, it seems that the East will be the next big thing. Depends on how easily the Russians will overwhelm the Chinese, if at all, and how involved other coalitions are going to be.
---
tbf there are some groups who use ram jags as a fleet like GoTG. I can confirm they are cancer to fight :D EC drones and massive tanks, doesn't even matter that they don't do much damage since there are 20 or more of them. 
---
Cloaky camp, kill, loot wrecks.
---
If the structures are in immensea then it has nothing to do with the Russians, that's an attack on legacy
---
out of your fucking ass, even with perma overheat and drugs 6k, perma overheat. A harpy with the same mods and drugs does 400m/s less cold and 700m/s less perma overheat(5.29something) and fitting allows full 4 electron blasters. Get facts str8
---
Not really relevant if you're not ASB fit and your cap boosters are getting neuted out if you don't use them anyway.
---
&gt; They have no use for a ship that can only travel to lowsec and null

I just finished the Blood Raiders Psychotropic Depot. In a Stratios. It took forever. I'm assuming that since there are Battleships in all the rooms that I can use a Battleship if I get it as an escalation again. Is that right or am I stuck using a Cruiser class ship?

That is very true, but the point above was that the API isn't designed to be a tool to mine intel about your enemies, which it becomes as soon as you leave an alliance and forget to revoke your tokens. If alliances wanted to follow the rules to the dot, they'd delete the tokens as soon as they detect that all of your characters are out, but why would anyone do that when it's an easy way to spy on your enemies?
---
Put your hacking window near your overview (so you can see people on grid) and local, if you have it (wormholer btw). You can also set everyone to flashy if you need an extra cry for attention.

Casuals play casually because of real life situations. There's nothing in this game that can change that. I have a job, a son, a pregnant wife and a wide range of things I need to do before I can even it down for a few hours. I used to be hard core. I started this game 16 years ago... I have 257mil sps... but I just came back recently and play casually. 
---
Everyone's different. 
---
Imagine not being able to hack it in literally the easiest corp in the entire game to get into...
---
Leave the code -&gt; use command to kill all POSes but make it generate lossmails -&gt; reimburse fixed amount depending on what kind of tower?
---
please stop invading that man's safe space :(
---
nobody flown officer drake yet?
---
DSTs already fill the role you're describing extremely well.
---
T1 haulers over 10k m3 of space can be ganked by 1 or 2 nados, DSTs carry ~63k with battleship levels of EHP. If you just want max carry capacity you can get 40k+ on an Iteron mk5. If you implement something even half way better than that between an Iteron and a DST why would you ever fly any of the current T1 haulers?
---
The best way for a small group that cant counter a camper is to learn their schedule. Ours were usually only active at specific times of day. Of course you still need to have enough activity that you can remain active in the timezones that the campers are afk.

with cpu/powergrid  hardwirings and implants u can fit 2 or 3 in freighter :D civilian armor reppers

No, those would be insults. Attack is much more generic: Your definitions are dumb (attack)

---
Thanks for the detailed response! Are there any fits you recommend? 
---
So shoot them back. Light your own cyno, drop your friends, have a fight.
---
Not even close to the same thing.
---
Yeah let me just make a 4b hg snake clone to fly my 50m frigate at a speed it doesn't even need to reach.
---
geez faction ammo? isnt that a bit overkill?
---
You had me at Ham Sandwich

cool, ill keep that in mind

Thanks I found it

This boy bought an industry alt, then proceeded to ask us how industry works. Not even "How do I set up complex reaction chains" or "How do I pick what blueprints to research" but simple stuff like the difference between ore and minerals. He bought his way into carriers without the ability to fly a cyno alt and has continued to be adamant that he wants to fly a ratting titan and if he loses it then whatever. This kid has more cents than sense and I feel like he'll keep hopping from corp to corp until he's been banned from every corp in Eve with any level of standards for bullshit they're willing to put up with.
---
I only have one eve account, i can't (and don't want to) engage so much time in eve to have more than one. My first slot is my main account, my second one sits in jita and my third one does PI (planetary interaction). 
---
If you buy a galaxy pack which are frequently on sale you get omega time and some 'multiple pilot training certificates' which you can use to train your other account slots (for pi and trade)

https://i.imgur.com/JPTd1Lw.png using cheap implants is cheating though
---
Its lonely at the top. Take "everyone" to hand us a L, which we're happy to take, if its earned.
---
And that's why people use cyno rorquals under a supercap umbrella.
---
By what measure is PL at the top? Killboard masturbation?
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites
---
Under Ded Sites down the page a little bit there is a table showing ship size restrictions. That site is a 5/10  so yes battleships would be allowed in, though very unnecessary for a 5/10. 
---
Gilas are extremely versatile for a lot of different PvE sites.  
---
Given that you'd have to completely rework the entire fit in order to make fitting room for guns, and you'd also need to switch the scram for a long point to kite drones, I don't think you can call a solo pvp fit a variant of that one, as they have nothing in common beyond the most basic modules.
---
Assault frig are in a good place actually being used compared to a while ago
---
imagine being in goons and writing this
---
Low effort :(
---
tbh. frat had been using the nip as toilet paper basically up until now anyway...
---
cause thats the STANDARD jaguar nullsecers use, with a-type abysal mwds and snakes.
---
thats a standard nullsec srp jag right there
---
It's ok if you find it hard to understand that one cheap ship countering 2/3 of the meta is unhealthy. Dumb people are allowed to exist too.
---
Why kite drones when you just facetank them?
---
PETA loves killing animals, I'm sure they'd like to get their hands on some pandas to euthanize.
---
How much casino money you all asking for to invade TAPI?
---
If we did something noteworthy then people might stop ignoring us.

Looks like you greatly overestimate how precious that nip is for frat
---
List of ships in the meta that can fit 2 medium neuts:
---

---
Ok cool, we can still fly 3/345 ships in the game.
---
[Jaguar, triple rep]
---
Small Core Defense Operational Solidifier I
---
Loses the nos and needs a 2% cpu implant, but this can tank a light missile jackdaw or medium drone stratios until it run out of cap boosters. By the time your third rep goes empty the first has finished reloading, and if you start falling behind on reload cycles the ADC buys you time to catch up again.
---
So, it will be countered pretty easily, but if you have secondary tackle nearby, or your enemy isn't using a neut, it works brilliantly.
---
i wish we were still in shark week
---
DOWNVOTED IT DIDNT HAVE THE RIGHT NOSFERATU IN THE HIGHSLOTS THEREFORE THE SPEED IS NOT RIGHT
---
Breaking Kritsan's tank was a bit annoying.
---
its ok if you think that the meta is a stable thing that doesnt fluctuate around balance changes, you sound like the people that screech when ccp announced rorq changes and less tank/yield, its exactly the same reaction.
---
Nope. The advent of alphas actually masked the issues with FW. The citadels that came with the same patch are what eventually killed it. 
---
we dont accept your DARK CASINO MONEY as a valid form of payment
---
Irrelevant, just commenting on the fact that Frat ended the NIP, but it‚Äôs also Frat who are complaining it‚Äôs ended.
---
In a mine field 
---
if you want to apply implants multaplasmids and a-types or w/e in nullsecers like BNI(catch) horde(geminate) and whichever else region you said, you are quite the dumbo trying to prove a point thats not there.
---
Delete this pls I just finished minmatar frigate V for the sole purpose of flying a jag :(
---
Calm down goonie, you don't have FC permission to make an ass of your alliance.
---
This guy takes fights 
---
I learned from Farmstink.
---
(((((((-:
---
This. You use rockets in the highs and run the MASBs to tank, then ADC through reloads. It's super easy but it takes a while because jaguar DPS isn't that great.
---
"in the meta" lmao you're restricting yourself even before you start counting
---
That's an injector problem 
---
lol i mean the name is right there, im not hiding it, also good argument, you sure showed me
---
Because you can't facetank heavy drones in a jaguar for long. You need to only have one ancil rep to make fitting space for guns, and without ADC that's not enough to survive. Even if you modify your resists, you still will die as soon as it goes on reload.
---
Normal, yes. Counter play, cov cloak 
---
Pft people can‚Äôt think out side of the meta to counter a dank jag. Gitgud scrubs. 
---
damn props to plex me now
---
I have adapted, I'd just rather be able to fly something other than the &lt;10 ships that are currently viable in the roaming meta, and not have to form at least 5 dudes to do anything.
---
I've a 6 year old that watches while I explore. I get him to watch local for me.
---
Just check after every can. You might get caught by someone that is amazing at scanning or has already bookmarked it but the chances are you can do a can and cloak/warp off before they get to you. 
---
Personally I carry on until I see probes on dscan. I haven't been caught yet.
---
May the real Toxic Apollo finally reveal himself.
---
&gt;2 cheap speed implants
---
&gt;It's unrealistic for nullsec players to be able to afford such implants
---
Nevertheless it's how it is right now.
---
CCPlease.
---
I was in an Astero with cov ops cloak...should I have just cloaked immediately as soon as the bubble dropped, rather than panicking to try and scramble for the edge?  
---
Now I know what a bubble looks like and knowing that trying to warp is pointless, I should hit cloak first instead?
---
https://i.imgur.com/PxgUJEa.png
---
???
---
its unrealistic that people use these with assault frigates esp if they are supposed to be from Brave or horde. Also you will find it that nullsec players are EXTREME cheapskates that despite making billions want that t2 fit hurricane reimbursed. Are there individuals that might do it, yes, will more than 5% of the playerbase do it? No. The fact that jag can hit 12k under circumstances doesnt mean it usually does. With that though lets nerf every frigate other than ceptor that can easily hit 4k with t2 mods.
---
https://i.imgur.com/4MvEZJC.png now I have the correct nos, please forgive this transgression 
---
Your complete lack of small scale experience is enough to prove your argument invalid.

&gt; counters should exist
---
Right, so what's the counter to a ramjag?
---
&gt; Is there anything at all you can do except try and burn to the edge of the bubble? Am I right in thinking they are 20km?
---
In a relic site you'll have to either burn out or wait 120 seconds for it to expire. If someone bubbles you on a gate in null you can always try to burn back to the gate (maybe cloaked) and jump back.
---
&gt; I'm training up so I can use ECM hornets - launching those might've given me a fighting chance if it dropped his lock and gave me more time to get to the edge, right?
---
Yes, but it's probably better to try to burn out cloaked and leave the hornets for if he decloaks you.
---
&gt; I was in an Astero with cov ops cloak...should I have just cloaked immediately as soon as the bubble dropped, rather than panicking to try and scramble for the edge? Now I know what a bubble looks like and knowing that trying to warp is pointless, I should have hit cloak first instead?
---
If you're combat fit in an Astero you can probably kill a solo Sabre. If you want to run though, yeah, one cycle your MWD/AB for speed and then cloak and try to coast out. Use drones if you get decloaked.
---
You're wrong. 1% CPU implant is unrealistic.
---
two medium neuts "counter" pretty much every frigate that gets in range of said neuts, that's hardly a point in favor of it. The jaguar is not fine.
---
Sorry if being able to plug a 100m implant into your head is above your skill level. I'm sure one day you'll manage :)
---
I thought about that but the main issue I had is there's too many scenarios where you need both the cloak and a cyno for Fleet gameplay.  The only thing that might possibly need nerfing about the cloak is the length of time it lasts.
---
You have to be in the system with the linked structure to save it from the chat box
---
I use a metronome to remind me to switch my attention between checking things. You could probably use music with a strong beat to remind you if you aren't as autistic as i am.
---
I don't have one yet. I can get one tho. But I dont think its wise to fly in a super with my shitty skills
---
A bomber for tackle because it has no targeting delay, and for the other account just fit a cloak to any old dps ship and sit there waiting until you have something tackled.
---
Covops cloaks don't slow you down. When someone is on grid you hit cloak, get to a position where they probably wont decloak you (because they can approach your last known position), and then make for the edge of the bubble. Once you're out align to a target that wont take you back through the bubble and decloak, then warp.
---
Wait until he sees 13km/s interceptors.
---
any long range webs/neuts/scrams and as some said bellow its funny how pissed they get when you use ec-300 cause they have no dps to kill them
---
Avatars tank = all the buses on grid + whatever you have fit
---
Would you rather we drop super carriers on them?  This at least hones FC piloting ability.  Maybe...
---
Thanks for the info.
---
OGB 4 speed mod maledictions were fine lmao just adapt. Shoot their skynet fighters idiot.
---
Spam dscan while you hack and you should have no trouble evading an interdictor. It's not common because dictors can't warp cloaked. ECM hornets are your last resort and usually do NOT work. Sometimes you get lucky, but it's not a tactic to bet on working. If you were far enough from the can and could cloak, that would be safer than trying to burn out of the bubble. If you are in range of the Sabre he will make mincemeat of your Astero. If you're in a kiting Astero you can kill the Sabre but you need a MWD for that, which won't work in a bubble. So, yeah - back to dscan - that's your best defense vs. bubblers dropping on you.
---
6 alliance tournaments participations both as theorycrafter and a pilot (NC., PL, the only good waffle team), lots of &lt;10 gangs, life in lowsec, life in npc nullsec, not affiliated with any mega krabbing alliance except the past 3-4 months in test, but i have absolutely no experience. K
---
Ferox fleet got bombed, just incase anyone else was wondering from the clickbait. 
---
eh, safety to a degree. there's more safety in that the sites themselves are harder to get to (which personally I think they all should produce beacons honestly) but at least they usually have more systems to cover, as opposed to a VNI in a dead end system not once taking a gate
---
&gt;  but why should a minmatar frig, the race that has the fastest ships not be able to get high speeds and tackle well
---
nobody said that, I don't see someone complaining about stilettos here for one.
---
&gt; they are the least tanked race and their whole idea is "bring speed"
---
too bad the jag has an unironic ~1.3k ehp/s tank with the adc on and ~300 without it. Guess they missed the memo on them not being tanked eh.
---
We can use the same argument for people that kite. Why should we need multiple people to hold your kitey bullshit down?
---
NBSI
---
Won't a bomber tackle just die really quick?
---
Mate,  
---
Kitey bullshit is cancer by itself. It's risk averse bullshit, learn to deal with a dangerous counter and adapt. Or die. Whichever suits you best.
---
Yeah indeed. I didn't know what was happening at first and I realised too late (ie, he had locked me so I wouldn't be able to cloak) that it was a bubble.  
---
So next time, I'll just hit the clock, slowboat in a random direction to the edge of the bubble (while having hit a cycle of the MWD), then align to a celestial away and go.  
---
Thank you.
---
The game growing old means long term players train into big ships, the points you made just augmented what was always going to happen
---
Move my corp to WH space, it's honestly pretty great, hasn't really changed since I lived in it in 2016-2017.
---
i excepted nothing and somehow i was still disappointed 
---
put the same mods to a harpy and tell me what u get
---
What's the third HUD overlay I see people using in YouTube videos?
---
You literally have ~1 point/kill friendo, the peak of small gang pvp.
---
mfw complaining about being unable to catch a drake
---
lol l2p
---
See,   
---
The problem with your mentality is that kiting should be without risk assuming you shoot down the tackle quick enough. I beg to differ, and strongly believe that there need to be counters to that including the current iteration of a jaguar. If you do not adapt to that in your kite fleet, you are the problem, not the Jaguar.
---
Since you don't need to fit it for dps you can tank it quite well. Sure it might die if you tackle a Stratios or t3c, but if you go after Asteros and covops you'll be fine. 
---
Yes but for less than 100 mil you will struggle to find 2 ships that won‚Äôt die fast 
---
Cost. There's a lot of room in both ISK and skills between a 1m ISK Iteron and a 250m ISK DST that needs racial industrial V.
---
I think there's room in the market for a battlecruiser-priced transport that only needs a few hours training. 
---
The argument is not whether it can be adapted around or not, the argument is that the adaptation is boring for both sides to fight. Flying with 5+ dedicated anti-tackle ships and a 100km engagement range results in braindead boring content.
---
Oh zkill and one char, lets bring up battleclinic stats as well next. Sorry that its not your way or the highway.
---
Battleclinic wasn't around in the jaguar meta.
---
Mmmmmmmmm
---
What can I say my friend, Life is RNG lol
---
Got it. What would be a good DPS that's caldari and not too expensive? HAM Caracal? I could probably train into T3 destroyer, or Drake also.
---
lol you cant get thicker can u
---
Oh, my goodness.
---
Would be pretty cool if they were generating content and baiting supers to get them comfortable dropping. Hopefully this is just foreplay 
---
&gt; Flying with 5+ dedicated anti-tackle ships and a 100km engagement range results in braindead boring content.
---
That happens when you fly in kiting ships against smaller groups. Ramjags are fine. Learn to deal with them.
---
dont even need supers to counter blops gangs. haw dreads and carriers. 
---
Awesome!
---
Kritsan is right on the edge of what you can kill at the skill level you first do those missions. I used a rail cormorant, not a corax, but I had to use faction antimatter ammo to get over the line back then too.
---
idk can you show me some ramjag kills on battleclinic?
---
ill get an error because the slot layout is not the same. If you want to say something to counter what I said feel free.
---
Seems like a hauler revamp is way overdue. They might be boring but essential.
---
Ive always found it somewhat infuriating that there is such a wide gap between your standard T1 hauler and T1 freighters, so your choice is either a tiny, very vulnerable hauler, or spend considerable resources and time training into and booing a freighter. The Orca is really the only middle ground, but its clunky to use as a freighter. A proper medium ORE hauler would be pretty nice.
---
We've sold Quafe in the store online before, and we generally tend to sell it at Fanfest.
---
It's actually [Orka](https://nammi.is/orka-500-ml.html) an icelandic energy drink made by Egils here in Reykjavik, we just get it from them with different labels.
---
And yes, it's super, mega, really, very tasty.
---
Just curious as I haven‚Äôt been around long enough to understand most of the politics, what does this mean for both sides if anything at all, apart from more content?
---
&gt; I'm terrified of Snuff
---
Is it Frat-Frat or New-Frat ?
---
Exactly that, really
---
There was a NIP, I believe it was due to expire soon actually, but Frat obviously got restless and decided to end it early.
---
Basically just means things have heated up. 
---
Check local/Dscan after every 3rd node. 
---
Ok make a 5 man comp of battlecruisers than can deal with jags
---
&gt;can you show me a link to battleclinic in general
---
Hah, I haven't fought or flown a HAM caracal in, well, ever. They're usually RLML, because HAMS have poor application. Yea t3d's are good, maybe a rail Naga, that way you can be at range and bail if shit gets too real.
---
We get it, you're a boomer
---
oh no you wont get a web that you needed to restrict 3k mwd nano cruisers, you are right.
---
An iteron like that isn't 1m, its 20m, of which only 1m is the hull. If you're going to have a "battlecruiser" hull thats say 5m meaning the ship is now 25m, why would you ever fly the current "cruiser" version?
---
That sounds reasonable. The error message could be clearer. 
---
Yes, another bomber might be good, but torpedoes apply to smaller stuff even worse than hams. Fit it for max application, TP's, missile comps, explosion radius rigs etc.
---
Hm, I need to get a 6 year old. One injector should be fine
---
Yeah, but as he said DST's however require high skills and investment. There is definitely room for something between a T1 haulers and T1 freighters that don't require such extreme resources to fly. Filling up a max-cargo Iteron is just begging to get ganked by hisec trash because they have the tank of a snowblower.
---
It spunds like youll be one of those people when ju says dont jump blindly to things you will jump blindly to things and say you are not my real dad.
---
That and Frat doesn't seem to like dealing with TAPI. Can't say I blame them.
---
stratios can run the guy doing the combat site but not the site itself  
---
so yeah the second option is better
---
I don't trust my shaky fingers on hotkeys. 
---
Bubbles don't disable your MWD but scams do.
---
What? You mean Rorquals cannot fit XL torp launchers? 
---
No, quite the opposite. The game got much better for me after I got rid if the "muh lossmails" mentality. I still don't like throwing away ships for no reason and I still have quite a competitive mindset, but it's so much better not to feel bad after every loss. 
---
To become a good player you have to accept losses. You learn more from one lost fight than from 10 that you won.
---
lol so many nullbear "just get a carrier or use a DST" posts in this thread.
---
You can totally catch kitey stuff if you have your shit together and coordinate. But with the jag any unskilled pilot can fly it, ram and then either force you off or kill you. 
---
1 sentinel or 1 hyena/rapier will do the trick.
---
Or just run a double medium neut nosprey and laugh as you warp off
---
Who cares
---
You apparently 
---
Welcome to our hole and the thrills of J-Space! Just came back to my computer and saw i got 20mil bounty payout because I was in fleet with the guy that got you :P
---
1) Never go back to a site in a hole where you just avoided a Interdictor. You were just lucky this didnt happen before. He did not leave the system, he just cloaked. 
---
2) Always spam D-Scan. In J-Space D-Scan is like breathing: if you stop doing it youre dead. See Sabre warping in, de-target can, cloak up, slowboat away. Hit Cloak, then hit MWD immedeatly after that and set a manual course out of the bubble while taking care not getting decloaked by the Sabre or Collidables. 
---
3) Your pod cant warp out of a bubble. There is no need to eject from the ship. Thanks for the ship though, we shall dedicate it to Bobs cause.
---
4) Sabres cannot fit a cov ops cloak so its a completely different game from cov ops hunting. Your best defense is D-Scan, Cloak. Also check zkill for the system your in so you will know if someone is hunting. You should also look for stations and check if somebody is home.
---
That said much kudos for taking you loss like a wormholer: Bob giveth, Bob taketh. Be sure to visit us again sometimes!
---
Praise bob

Take the local window and stretch it vertically and shrink it horizontally.  Then, move it right next to the thing you look at most frequently or right next to where you are splitting your attention to.
---
Also helps to select and highlight the names of all existing friendlies in the window so that a new entry pops out more visually.
---
The two combined should allow you to notice a change in your periphery in most cases. 
---
Thanks mate!
---
a 5 man BC comp is getting tackled by literally whatever assault frigates / fast heavy tackle comes along, one ramjag is no longer your main concern lol
---
Funny it worked before tackle frigs got a 20s god mode button ü§îü§îü§î
---
If youre hunting covops you can fly a solo rocket manticore.
---
&gt;why is it everytime there is a good tackle ship (like you need to sacrifice fkin everything for it to be really good) people cry about it
---
I think what you are trying to say.. everytime there is a good tackle ship that morons can fly.
---
The malediction and stiletto are amazing tackle ships..  
---
I suggest to align to a celestial and stop your  ship meanwhile you are in the can. Stay alert of the overview. If a sabre warps on grid, you just click the warp button, and you are out. His bubble will not be effective, because you hit the warp button before the bubble is deployed, and the time between the sabre warps on grid and deploys the bubble is about 3 or 4 seconds,enough to escape. If it's an astero what you see on grid, just click warp and you escape 100% times, because you are already aligned and he needs 4 or 5 seconds to decloak, target and scramble you. And if it's a bomber (no target delay) check the distance to him. You can volley him in a very short time, I never brawl an astero with my bomber. The fact is that in wh space, you never get caught, you let them caught you. Fly safe. 
---
This was really the thing that made me not stay around null longer. As a newer player I only had access to whatever overpriced mods were in our market, or paying out my ass to have one of the jump freighter pilots bring me in a load of stuff. Grinding out a shit load of isk to buy and train into a T2 freighter was out of the question. 
---
why even have a smartbomb if you're not gonna run it to clear the giant cloud of light drones on you :smith:
---
what are you even trying to say
---
 &gt;we already have those
---
lol no there arn't. Last time I checked you can't fly a carrier in hisec. 
---
Where on earth are you finding BC hulls for 5m? A Ferox hull is 36m in Jita. 
---
Point 3, yeah, that was a desperate measure.  
---
Thanks for the fun, and for the lesson.
---
I‚Äôve always personally like the idea of a ship similar to a DST with some jump capabilities. It‚Äôs really something that fits in fairly well with smaller gang/squad deployments and logistics. 
---
If smaller FOB-like structures ever come out, I believe they would go very well together.
---
since when does immensea belong to the rusrus
---
A cyno is activated, you drop your inhib, a ton of stuff jumps in, and you die. The cyno is now countered.
---
Except it wasn‚Äôt even a frat structure ü§î
---
Will take care of the fish, fly clever. o7
---
Nah it‚Äôs some kid named Egon who was in my corp once. Gotta be. 
---
&gt; you need a MWD for that, which won't work in a bubble
---
MWD works fine in a bubble. Not if the sabre scrams you, though, which it will because a sabre is faster than you.
---
For point 2 - how do I distinguish between just seeing a ship in range of 14.3au, and one that is on its way to me?  
---
When I've more time what I've been doing is dropping the range down to say 5 and if something shows then, that's when I'd run.  
---
Not picking up the scan on this occasion was just lack of paying attention, oops.
---
Dont have dps because rockets is shit.
---
Has no active tanke like a cruiser.
---
15 second do not save you from blobers.

It‚Äôs not exactly a solution on the level of what you are looking for, but if you select a pilot in local &gt; ctrl A (select all), it will highlight everyone in local, but not anyone who joins in afterwards. It does make them a bit more noticeable when there is a local change. 
---
Also just make the names in local bigger (anything that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcompact list‚Äù) and that also makes it a bit more visually obvious.
---
There's a difference between accepting losses, and the losses not mattering at all. Accepting losses is a good thing. But when you can accept them because they cost you nothing, it's a bad thing.
---
What I mean is, it's good to not worry about killboards, but if the losses mean nothing, then the combat itself means nothing. Losses shouldn't be a momentary inconvenience, they should sting, if maybe just for a little bit.
---
Now, of course losing a T1 frigate won't really matter, and that's fine. But losing an expensive T3C or a capital should sting. It *should* feel bad. It should be more than just "oh darn, now I have to spend the time to buy another one off of contracts". 
---
I usually have it at full range. If im in a site and expect someone to warp in I set it to 5 AU mostly. But as soon as I see a Sabre on D-Scan while hacking ill be cloaking up anyway.
---
If an iteron is a "cruiser" at 1m then I was just extrapolating some figure.
---
Something like that could be cool if it had a modular cargo bay, so one could choose max generic cargo volume, fleet hanger for pre-assembled ships, or max ore bay for example. 
---
I think that's part of my curve here - knowing what a Sabre is, its MO, and its limitations.   
---
I should learn what ships can warp cloaked and what can't.  
---
Thanks for the advice, pleased to know it's similar to what I do. Keep it max, then when suspicious drop it down a little.
---
Not true. The enemy can't read your mind so just the possibility you could drop is often enough for them to have to assume you might drop.
---
Don't do data sites. Don't double bluff in wh space. Don't use a blingy pod. If you see a sabre move on to the next system or the next after that one. Turn your sound on to hear wormhole activation. Fit your astero with some bite. Pound that dscan button like it's your heart beating. Check structures in the wh for players online. If you wanna go full noob fit some stabs and an mwd with ec drones, burn for the edge with mwd and put drone on him. Have friends close by to escalate. And always keep your pod inside your ship.

---
can confirm, am goon, want to shoot goons.
---
i would be very happy if i could live in bubble for longer than minute :D
---
It's a pretty shitty counter when you are forced to fight on the enemies terms all the time.
---
What I heard turning on your mwd and hitting approach is a big skill!
---
Who needs to manual pilot  a tackle ship when you go 10k/s.
---
It seems totally balanced to me!
---
All AFs are overpowered, some just more than others. Outside of certain matchups, there is no point in fighting an AF in another small ship because of the free invulnerability. You need a cruiser or larger, but then you run into other issues.
---
&gt;Can ccp please look at its stats and just fine tune to put them more in line with other assault frigates,
---
They just released the "mother of all balance patches", "buffing" the Corax and the Harbinger - two ships that were responsible for much grief amongst players. You want more?
---
&gt;How can CCP say that this is balanced?
---
They allow Titans to be injected so new players can "catch up". What do you expect?
---
join a Wormhole corp
---
wormholes are the pinnacle of eve, the only remaining fragment of its original soul
---
Stabber, Stratios, VNI. Then you have the Cruor ( 2 bonused small neuts), you can have 2 medium neuts on a cyclone. 
---
They probably spend 10 entire minutes on that patch!
---
&gt;In the meta
---
Suggests cruor and stabber
---
I have been told by retards that the "counter" to getting scrammed is not to get scrammed. What do you think about that?
---
Panic will kill you in survivable situations ten times out of ten. Try traveling around awhile in lo/null and practice using your jump timer to calmly assess the situation and decide your best course of action. 
---
POS TOWERS will be  only sellable to npc  buy orders.  you will not be able to  use the pos towers once they are fully retired
---
In all seriousness, with all the people that play EVE in general, it would be super cool to see a wider distribution of it! Would be awesome to try, I bet.
---
And thanks for the reply!
---
I mean not really - I know this is the narrative you like to push bc you are all grr goons and shit. Like I have said before: if you find something else entertaining to read about, by all means, post about it. 
---
With that said you haven‚Äôt missed a single post white knighting this dude, not a single one. I have seen this same exact comment by you, with the words shifted a little bit, at least 5 times now. I don‚Äôt believe we are the only ones experiencing your alleged ~‚Äù*HHuurrRr HeS LIVinG fREEE in uR miNDSS*‚Äù~, your myladying of him suggests an obvious effect he‚Äôs having on you.
---
Look, you're not wrong, but recommending the Sentinel here with no context is pretty dishonest.  In order to do what it needs to do and stay on grid you need a 200m+ fit with snakes (and even then there are things that can force you off depending on your mids).
---
As for interceptors, you need a pretty good inty pilot to properly screen the sheer number of jags coming your way these days without getting themselves caught, and how many of those are still playing the game?
---
People cared about the AT because they had a stake in it, just like with sports irl. If you have no stake in it then it's no longer anywhere near as thrilling. 
---
I was only in AAA like 2-3 months maybe. 
---
They are too dumb to get it. If an "overpowered" ship somehow ever dies because some f1-drone fleet brought a ton of shit, it is "fine".
---
If the jag didn't have a 20 second god mode no one would care it's what makes it great not just the speed. You can OL and survive for ever unless the gang has 4 ships dedicated to stopping you.
---
Just hit approach OL mwd tackle and hit god mode when the switch too you very high iq play.
---
I think you went to hard on the thesaurus and flipped the subject of that comment around too much to understand exactly who‚Äôs the antagonist of your psych study.
---
Thas a lot of damage! /s
---
Game so balanced running is a victory!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty triggering, also no compact member list either REEEEE
---
NSS gamers rise up
---
Probably because the main reason something is "good" in this game is because it is overpowered.
---
Wierdly enough, pressures from other ships dictate the meta, therefore suggesting currently out-of-meta ships is a pretty solid idea seeing as the pressure from the RamJag could make those ships meta.
---
C4 still needs to be deleted, null evicted HK, lowclass is still pretty quiet, and Bob is still praised.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs broken. We need more things/ships in the game to balance out a lot of the ships.
---
I don't believe in the meta. Change my mind.
---
I'm not sure you understand how a meta works.
---
Kity ships almost always have a chance to dictate which engagements to take, therefore if you're afraid of the big scary RamJag just warp off.  
---
Just because you're in a drugged-up, implanted kity meta ship doesn't mean you should be able to take any engagement you want and walk out of it.
---
&gt;implying there will be just one ramjag
---
Metas evolve.  
---
Could you be more specific?
---
The way you do that is to nerf the OP ones. Eventually (after like a month of multiple patches), you get more viable ships.
---
A display of sheer insurmountable autism
---
https://i.imgur.com/X2X5QH8.gif
---
The question is if there was actually room to have a different ship class without just making it OP.
---
The DC should come with drawbacks, like being unable to activate any other module, so it truly becomes defensive only.
---
Merely as a joke, my sister found this old screenshot from 2015 I once made, from the internet and made a print of it. Super happy with it! 
---
They will make that move if they understand why it is needed.
---
RIP walking in station
---
To picture a broader spectrum, have the view of someone from WinterCo. (FRT &amp; Friends) against that narrative provided by Legacy (TEST &amp; Friends): 
---
TEST says the corp that tried to anchor it is a corp controlled by FRT - which we are quite surprised of because it's not. 
---
TEST says so, because while their allies tried to shoot it down they got stopped by a fleet from FRT who happened to find out about the bash and interfered in it for content. 
---
They ignore the fact that we shot down another Raitaru anchored by this corp in our own space as well. [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98564738/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98564738/) (see 2 Raitaru kills)  
---
 They also ignore the fact that it would not make much sense as a "covert op" to anchor a structure under and alt-corp when you come with your regular members to defend it... 
---
From WinterCo-perspective, it just looks like a pretty boring and uncreative way to end the NIP (Non Invasion Pact) from TEST-side. If TEST really breaks their word, I would have hoped for at least something more original than this. :-/ 
---
So in the end, it does not really change anything for line-members except that there might be more structure bashes coming up and SOV-warfare that might start to happen soon(tm) instead of the fun roams we had in the past months. 
---
Especially when the russian coalition (do they have a name yet?) starts to invade Detorid as they have claimed they would... so far they only roamed around and managed to lose two Fortizars. (Russians in Tenerifis where not included in the NIP) 
---
P.S.: NIP was about to expire in the last days of March 22nd or 26th, you find different dates in different places. So even stranger that TEST has withdrawn from the agreement early. They only gain bad reputation for not keeping their word and a few days in advance. Maybe they have "grand plan" to use those days, we'll see.  
---
And maybe the Russians asked for help early. [TEST fleets already actively helped them to reinforce FRT-structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAvdeNUDnGs) (which should have been against the NIP as far as I know, but I'm no diplo)   
---
P.P.S.: Keep in mind I'm only line member in Detorid, stuff might not be 100% correct and some I can only guess. But makes you think how difficult RL agreements between hostile parties must actually be... phew. Good thing we only do that with space pixels! :D   
---
Well, see you in space. o7 
---
But it can run away from a ram jag!
---
Ditto detorid, the jag swarm was is so much that my lentos scram can't always cycle fast enough to keep them off the others.
---
Being able to run away from a jag isn't enough to prop up a ship that can't do much of anything else
---
&gt;  The chances of losing that investment are huge
---
No they are not
---
&gt; at the time of writing this there were 14 Rorqual loses on zkill
---
14 bads. Actually if you look at the fits, half are pure drone fit, one doesn't have a fit, just bulkheads, and several don't have cyno/PANIC.
---
Meanwhile, how many are mining safely ?
---
Don't use a rorq without an umbrella. If you want to be casual then 1 rorq isn't a great option anyway
---
It's not wise for you to fly in anything besides a T1 frigate. 
---
Actually, it's still a far worse all-purpose tackle ship than an interceptor.  It's worse at scouting and getting into tougher pockets of space because it warps slower and doesn't have bubble immunity; it's worse at getting initial tackle because it's slower and doesn't have increased point range; and it's worse at defensive screening due to lower agility and less scram range.
---
The main reason it's so popular is because, unlike an interceptor, literally anyone can fly it and oppress solo and small gang players.  It's a completely braindead way for null blobs to help shut down any  and all threats to their space.
---
Does this mean the Jag isn't broken?  Fuck no, it means that interceptors are also broken.
---
It's just that no one cares because there are so few pilots out there that can fly interceptors at the level required to make them that way.  Think of it as similar to why no one complains that AT ships are too strong.
---
Awesome birthday present! 
---
Quafe and Tacos!!! Wait, am I on the Dust514 forums?
---
Seriously. Do people not remember a few years ago when the T3Ds did everything small ships did, but better?
---
Honestly, if I have time later I‚Äôll elaborate, but if your only objective in Eve is to simply collect more isk and watch that wallet grow, it is quickly going to become an awful grind. However, if you plan on using the isk you invest to do other things (PvP comes to mind) then increasing your rate of income significantly like that can be a huge gain.
---
I recently invested what amount to what you described above in order to increase my income. You know what my first thought was? *‚ÄùHot damn I only have to bear for an hour and I can PvP for a whole month!‚Äù*
---
If the investment doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to you. Reevaluate your objectives. Look at your goals. Find out what you actually want to do, not what you feel like you **have** to do. Way too many people fall for the ‚Äúgotta get more‚Äù trap that can make Eve not fun.
---
Been playing eve for over 9 years. Wallet has never gone above 10b, but my assets have increased a lot. Often enough, I doubt whether or not some grinds I did we‚Äôre worth the materials I grinder for. 
---
And the Nosprey in particular sacrifices a lot for it.

I usually put my local window near the hacking window and then I hit CTRL-A to highlight all the names in the local channel so it's more noticeable when something moves.
---
Thanks for the insight, that clears up a few things. I know both seem to have healthy numbers (FRT &amp; TEST) but don‚Äôt you think at this point FRT might be in a bit of a tight spot, since you said the Russians were planning to invade and now If TEST is joining too, even tho I‚Äôm part of the coalition (joined about a week ago) I still haven‚Äôt heard/noticed much. However I do hope for some fun content.
---
Also regarding your PPS, hahaha I can only imagine and I cannot understand those who enjoy being diplomats, the amount of responsibilities and headache. We‚Äôre definitely better off as line members lol.
---
See you in battle, neighbor o7
---
I can confirm that I REEEEEEEE about ramjags at least once a day.
---
I agree that the inability to reship to an Alpha is a legit problem with this solution. But, the idea is to get more people fighting in Lowsec. Many of these folks would extend their involvement to Omega class complexes as they gained confidence. 
---
Also, there is technically no reason to block people from re-setting their clone state to Alpha...ie re-cloning back and forth at will.
---
You're proving the point.
---
If ships need to start dropping guns (!) in favor of neuts just to counter one ship, that's a pretty good sign something is wrong.
---
you get a ship that's 600 m/s slower cold, tanks 20% less, has one less tackle mod, costs 7m isk more and for all that you get a whole thousand EHP of buffer and a second nos when the first one should keep your scram on just fine anyways.
---
Have you flown a Rorqual? super easy to lose it. And yeah some of those fits on zkill are WTF. 
---
The notification icon randomly hovering over the chat input box is what's really triggering me.
---
I watched this video where the ship type was really large and easily seen in grid. Or is this just a setting?
---
You assume that people getting into a Rorqual only do so to watch the wallet grow, most of us, its so we can afford to lose ships in PVP.
---
Umbrella doesn't mean what you think it does. It's a 50/50 if you get saved.
---
well thought comment and not in the spectrum of "rabblerabblerabble". On the other hand, should tools that not only the 1% can use, exist(not talking about AT ships, talking about pilot skill). Would you treat a jag differently from any other tackle?Do the same principles of screening work on jag as on any other tackle? Are we talking about 2 jags or are we talking about 30 jags swarming you? Is it true that the "40m frigate" as some people said is able to be that oppressive? Cause if you read the comments people would prefer if it was a vagabond cause it would be worth something, then go and link 500m jaguar fits +implants or snakes. The whole idea of eve is play-counterplay, imo the tools should exist cause 1) this helps push the meta to evolve (example fighter application and turn to 100mn t3c) 2) there is an actual counter to kiting whereas before there were only half-measures, sure if you drop your super or whatever you can kill them, but subcapital-wise there wasnt an answer other than a bugged hic (and no a jag is not broken in the way a 500mnHic was, its a frigate with tank)
---
That's freakin' awesome!
---
I miss Walking in Stations...
---
150M isk/hr is pretty optimistic, even under ideal circumstances.   
---
A properly fit Astero can kill a typical Sabre.
---
&gt;All AFs are overpowered, some just more than others. Outside of certain matchups, there is no point in fighting an AF in another small ship because of the free invulnerability. 
---
Fly a triple neut dragoon, solo there are only 2 AFs it needs to worry about: the hawk and the jag because they can both be totally cap independent. Even then, you can probably warp out if you start losing.
---
Noon question, but what does ram stand for?
---
I agree with everything you said to a point. I definitely agree that (basically) everyone's situation is different. But that is different than saying "Casuals play casually because of real life situations". Hopefully, we can agree that this is true for some but not all. 
---
Eve is not expensive if you are playing a lot of hours. Eve is VERY expensive if you compare it to the other (even AAA) options out there competing for your time and money. This means Eve only succeeds where the value proposition outweighs the alternatives...and I would argue this is only true for committed players.
---
People like you should be able to play casually and have a good experience. 
---
The large number of Alpha players should be able to find a good experience indefinitely. Many of these will cross-over into a more committed state and we should do all we can to facilitate that.
---
Would be a viable complaint if these NPSI fleets only engaged fleets of similar numbers. However, I am pretty sure that the fun-seeking gaggle would have ganked any poor sod they would have met on a gate, regardless of the fact how outnumbered their target was. HTFU.
---
Ok so, are you implying that you could beat Shia LaBeouf? Because you can't. Nobody can. Also use filters.
---
Or just don't be bad at the game? Just a thought
---
A jump capable ship would need a cloak to move safely through hostile midpoints, and the tactics of moving safely can be taught or learned rather than purchased.
---
Higher sp individuals/groups move jump capable ships with cloaks through hostile space all the time.
---
Dead end null is worthless to established entities because they have the ability to fight for better space. Deep null has a natural protection by being harder to get fleets too, this might be a way for small corps/alliances (I am thinking sub 100 members) to grow.
---
Sure they will be ambushed and killed, but this is EVE and should be expected.
---
Just having a cyno in your pocket doesnt help if its 3+ midpoints away, and a small group cant put up and maintain infrastructure along the route.
---
Sure their sandcastle will eventually be knocked over, but everyones sandcastle gets knocked over eventually and in the mean time it might bring more life to the under used areas of space.
---
The only alternative currently available to groups like this is to bend the knee and join one of the mega blobs, or move to WH space.
---
I agree, I went through past posts on what people said was average to provide a more objective view. 
---
if you think that small gang had 0 counter before, youve clearly never flown in a small gang fleet or understand what makes them good. There are tons of ways to deal with them, but 6km/s frigates with t2 cruiser tank for 40m shouldnt be one of them
---
It was like this in 2007 when I started. Not sure what Eve you fell in love with, must have been before 0.0 was implemented.
---
Yes they were the ones begging FRT for a treat last year that was how it happened
---
for what ever reason TAPI needs a narrative to do anything, why can't they just be like goons and just say "fuck it, lets fight" and just end it there. 
---
Well yeah, there's lots of time consuming methods you could use to make sure you don't accidentally drag something out. But filters won't stop you from grabbing your ammo along with all the other loot ammo you found.
---
The point is that if you could somehow tag / sort away the things you know you always want to keep aboard, then you can easily grab everything else and offload.
---
&gt; Kitey bullshit is cancer by itself. It's risk averse bullshit
---
nope, risk averse bullshit is dropping everything that gets tackled, which coincidentally is what people who talk of kitey stuff like that do 90% of the time. People roam in kitey stuff not because they necessarily like it but because they need to.
---
&gt;  learn to deal with a dangerous counter and adapt. Or die. 
---
i mean why even make patches to the game if the response to every perceived imbalance is jUsT AdApT
---
Link a screencap please
---
Isn't it basically how much time he actually spent on the project? 
---
If it was all smoke and mirrors it's probably only a couple dozen hours. Depending on his haul that's quite the nice rate.
---
And we can't know what he did in the meantime, right?
---
please make a thread here if beam legions become a thing outside of wormholes. this might convince me to come back to eve.
---
Stop concern trolling Basil.
---
I don't think NC/PL ever had more Titans/Supers than CFC/Imperium.      
---
Also, whats this "downswing" you speak of?
---
Nothing wrong with that. No personal attacks, no bannable materials, not promoting violence, no threats... all in all a well written sexy fan-fic copy-pasta, it seems. Really not something to get your knickers in a twist about.
---
Yeah, I'm trying to steer him to...more reputable...folks hehe.
---
Cock Cock Penis.
---
It does. I would bet less than 1/50 maybe even 1/100 TEST rorqs who get tackled die. 
---
Exactly. Limitless content paired with non-stop winning. We've had this baseline established for some time now.
---
I'd like to understand more of what you believe. Would you mind spelling it out for me?
---
Accept my Rorq alt into corp and then we can say it was mined in Delve. Win Win. I'll be in touch.
---
Hadn't written anything about them ever having more supers/titans. The downswing is comparative to post-WWB dominance.
---
Thats kind of dumb to offer it as collateral and still own it... No you dont you give it to them and they give you isk and when you give them their isk back plus interest you get your collateral back
---
The idea is good but the amount of effort it would take isn‚Äôt worth it. There are much higher priorities 
---
Being good at menuing is a very eve like mechanic to me.
---
First you need to get into the habit of d-scanning, something like once every two seconds. I regularly D-scan in other games than EVE. I don't even look at the D-scan window I just have it in the corner of my eye and lets the eyes ability to pick up on changes come into play.
---
For d-scanning it helps to have filter that show nothing but ships, or at least an absolute bare minimum of things. That way if ANYTHING shows up you need to take action. If you have gates and planets and citadels and other junk showing up it won't be as easy to see when something changes. Going from nothing to one item is much easier to notice than when you go from 14 to 15 items on D-scan.
---
It was implied by saying "They are now back at having the largest super-capital fleet in the game by far". Also I personally can't tell a difference on dominance. Things still feel the same so I'm just trying to see through your eyes. Eve has changed overall so maybe its all of ours perspectives on what is perceived dominance. 
---
TEST does run a tight ship, but they still die, bombars bar and goons kill them all the time. 
---
Well, when you mention ROI instead of relative income, the assumption is you plan to build that initial investment back up. Don‚Äôt forget, when you look at ROI, there is always the option of retracting that investment. You can easily mine for a while and then sell the rorq, and all you have to recover (assuming you need all of that investment back) is SP. 
---
Ratting in VNIs or mining in a T1 barge both have absolutely excellent ROI ratios, but have very low overall income. Hell, when you get down to mining frigates it gets even better ROI but less income too.
---
As a side note, it‚Äôs a bit unreasonable to assume that the full subscription time as part of the cost, since you can actually do other things while skills train. 
---
You're talking about a custom overview - there's numerous options out there, so I recommend you start by joining the in-game channel 'Z-S Overview' and follow the instructions in the MOTD. It's a good all-around setup that'll be useful to you no matter what you're doing. 
---
Fly an MNI kill all the farmers get all the dank frags.
---
FW is both great and full of risk averse nerds in hard counter bullshit, but I don't think plexes are going to save them. How you fly and what you engage makes a huge difference. Sure, some people fly their 80 mil sp perfect nerd pilot and hard counter anything that might remotely resemble a fight, but anyone can learn to avoid these people and find good fights.
---
They are easy to loose. If you are bad.
---
have you flown a rorqual? You tank 200 Subcaps, light a cyno for 200 Titans, and are invulnerable on demand for 7 and a half minutes.
---
If you lose it then you either A have absolutly 0 backup and should just stick to mass Exhumers, or B have issues with tying shoes IRL.
---
&gt; you realize that you also dropped off that big stack of ammo you were planning on using to kill this next target.
---
It's kinda irritating to have our own supplies of ammo and charges intermingled with the rest of the cargo contents. 
---
No. It‚Äôs EVE Online. You‚Äôre supposed to pay attention. If you‚Äôre undocking a shooter you first check your consumables. Do you have ammo? Do you have paste? Are your modules repaired and ready?
---
Sure it‚Äôs irritating to see your guns cycle empty and not loading fresh ammo because you left it in the station. I‚Äôve done it too. You know what makes you not have that problem? Getting your ass blown out of your boat because you were too stupid to load ammo for your guns.
---
EVE is the school of pain compliance. You learn not to repeat your mistakes or pay the price for insisting on being a dumbass.
---
If it was needlessly hard, and I can name examples, I‚Äôd say: sure, you have a point. This is simply dropping your ammo into the hold and loading your weapons.
---
I‚Äôm all for sensible changes to the interface that are actually useful or eliminating confusion and frustration. I‚Äôm not for handholding.
---
You can verify that you have ammo in the hold. It takes 2 seconds. Come on already.
---
Wish I had some shots like that before they got rid of it.  Looks good OP.
---
PVE in a wormhole isn't easy PVE. Usually you're looking at high-active-tanking spider-cap-transferring rattlesnakes or active tank naglfars. They're not easy sites to run, and two cheap ships have a pretty small chance of catching something of value thats running PVE in wormholes. You could catch some explorers - but honestly almost anything kills a dedicated explorer - assuming you have enough points to keep it on grid. Stratios,' are T3C are the exception (tackle with care). 
---
That being said: 
---
I would go with an astero (scanning and tackle) [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75741399/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75741399/)\-- alternative is a ceptor (stiletto or malediction) and scan the hole and chains beforehand with a dedicated scanning ship (my preference) 
---
2nd ship could be one of the following
---
a hull tanked vni w/ mobile depot refit for repping your damage (hull and armor repper). Heat your neuts and run them dry of cap. You also need to return home when you're out of cap boosters.

or [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75715818/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75715818/) (not my fit, just something close to what would be a  good suicide brawling caldari ship - would double check the rigs for max ehp)

---
Of course two of those options almost doubles your price, and honestly someone would have to be in a T1 battlecruiser or below. They MIGHT be out in a wormhole doing something - but probably not.
---
You're also very committed to the grid so if its bait - good luck. 
---
You'd have more overall targets finding a wh chain to some good ratting space and going after vni's that are sleeping at their desks (lots of bots now a days though) so this becomes sort of depressing after a while. 
---
I arrange my windows so I can see if anyone enters the system.  The compact chat list with red for all neutral/hostile makes it very easy to see if someone who may shoot me comes into system.
---
If nobody is in system, I put my hacking windows over the member list and just show the red/blue icons, so if a red icon appears it catches my eye automatically.
---
Well I'm not going to teach you how to kill supers better, so have fun living in ignorance I guess.
---
XiX and Test are allies. 
---
ITT lots of people saying toon.
---
I'm interested...is there a guide or something? Tell me more. Do you have a fit?

I admit, adding the ammo bay would probably be a significant change. Especially the way I suggested, with a shared capacity. But that was mainly to avoid complaints about not having enough room for ammo, or suddenly having extra space for loot.
---
But even standard Containers have the ability to lock contents and prevent them from being taken out. All they need to do is apply that to the ship's cargo hold. Then we can go through and tag ammo and paste and all that ourselves.
---
It's not a difficult change, and it's not like it hurts anyone to add it. If you're opposed to any changes or improvements just b/c "that's how it is", then why bother with any updates? They should just release the game and never look back.
---
It's super easy to lose any ship if you are dumb enough
---
Hello Eve Community,      
---
I present to you all my next creation. This video features a lot of great Super Capital footage that I haven't been able to present in a while. I don't want to give you all "more of the same" which in this case, I did not. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did recording it. Special shout out to Kai'ne Sicturus of Pandemic Horde for the titan footage (Panfam stronk). Thank you everyone for the continued support and please do provide feedback on how I can better serve/kill you all! Much &lt;3

Interdictors like Sabres have a high base warp speed, and are often rigged so they warp even faster - they are designed to catch you! A good hunter won't show themselves to you on d-scan unless they are in warp to you, so if you see one on scan, it's GTFO time as they are probably about to land on you. Scanning at max scan range will buy you another second or two to get safe, so using max range when defensive scanning is a good general rule of thumb
---
Only trig ship that isn't worth using is the damavik (frigate) but all the others are great. Use the kiki if you want to solo in slmething small. 
---
The vedmak also offers really good solo capabilities due to it's speed and utility highs.
---
I forgot Rens even existed. My bad. 
---
Talking in stations could have been a spin-off game. You could have made it a first person shooter type station fighting game. Where are you what I've had bars and clubs and trades and people fighting. You could have had people die in the stations and then wake up in their clone home station.
---
You know how i track explorers with my interdictor? I follow the trail of cherry picked sites.
---
If you ever think anyone is looking for you it's time to leave entirely.
---
Mashed D-scan for a year. Is there a slower auto-Dscan yet?
---
Either 200mm autocannon with barrage, ab, scram, web with dda, saar, and dcu with hull rigs.
---
OH T2 scram will reach out to 16km and you can even catch really fast slicers if you overheat the ab and scram, and approach at a 45-90 degree angle to their predicted vector. It's pretty easy for a slicer to accidentally get within 16km and get scrammed. Works about the same for all kitey things. 
---
Scram also has a +2 strength, so you can pop ventures and other farming frigs all day. if you overheat your ab and pick dessies carefully you can take them on. Coercers are a nogo, obviously.
---
You can also do that same fit but drop the web for an mwd and the 200mm cannons for 150mm autos and be a decent anti-kite/small gang tackle frig. 
---
I'm sure there's a lot more to it, but mostly you stand out because nobody knows what MNI's do and they don't know if they can engage you or not or they expect you to be bad because their buddy told them you're weaker than a comet or a worm so they're too elite to actually know why/how that is and will feed to you.
---
And if you're not sure just try to make it look like you're running away and hit them with an OH web on the AB fit and OH your AC's as well and start burning them down before they get close enough to realize you're doing a decent amount of dps and they're way behind on the dps war.
---
CaseyLP has a hull fit MNI I've seen him use https://zkillboard.com/kill/75407278/
---
but I prefer the extra dps of having 1-2 dda's plus your range should be your tank in a lot of fights with a 13km scram range/16km oh scram range.
---
The stiletto is dog shit for tackle... it dies to a orthrus when i approach
---
alphas were great for fw. They filled out fleets and could fly the basic attrition comps we used in system sieges. The main reason we fought, however, was to kick the other side out of their respective systems (changing tier is easy to do without targeting home systems). One of the main detractors from going after an enemy's home system was the advantage they'd have reshipping in stations as opposed to POSes. Not only did citadels remove that advantage, they destroyed the reason we went after home systems. There's no point in fighting 24/7 over a system if the defenders can just live out of an astrahus in a system afterwards. 
---
Post your ‚Äûinsane fit‚Äú. Asking for a friend.
---
I guess you won so hard you got tired of winning.
---
&gt; They should just release the game and never look back.
---
Have you seen the very first release of EVE? You‚Äôd be amazed to call ‚Äòthat‚Äô a game.
---
CCP has iterated on their game all the time.
---
I‚Äôm for making sensible changes, and lots of QOL work is being done all the time. But an Ammo hold? It‚Äôs got to stop somewhere, right? Yet more interface to manage.
---
Again, if it was hard, confusing or error prone, I‚Äôd agree. But this is just dumping ammo into the hold. I stand by what I said. The best way not to forget your ammo is to forget it one time and see your boat blown to debris. You‚Äôre not going to do that again.
---
You‚Äôre an adult and you‚Äôre a smart adult [EVE tends to be brutal on the slow thinkers - and they prove it]. You can work your mind around the idea of checking whether your guns are loaded. I have confidence in you. You‚Äôre going to do that as easy as breathing.
---
When I buy the Star Pack on a Omega account, will the 1 month omega upgrade be appended to my remaining Omega days?
---
Yeah thats what every ignorant person says, but in reality, you get caught by a good form up, your dead
---
I remember my friends and I being chased by you in Kubinen, hope you're doing well!
---
oh no, I dont have a web to stop the scary nano cruisers, what will I use...
---
EXCEPT THE SCRAM WHICH SHUTS OFF THEIR MWD
---
Bruh you gotta come up with better arguments.
---
But they screened it and made sure it anchored though. 
---
Also another comments states the corp responsible for the structure is an FRT alt corp. Don't know if true. But if not it's a very ballsy move by some randoms. And you wonder why frt went to see it anchor. 
---
I'm going to have Vietnam flashbacks of 37+ ecm modules laying waste to our poor fucking guardians man.
---
This is the fucking stupidest thing I've ever seen.
---
I love it.
---
Are you also that one nerd who flies the heavy curse?
---
There is no rule that says that though. No where does it say we should purge information after someone leaves an alliance. Hell, we've got hundreds of people who log into our website and leave their esi tokens and never join or even apply to any corps. It's 100% a players responsibility to manage their tokens wisely, and using them for intel is completely legit and within the scope of CCPs intentions.
---
glad youre making videos again, keep em coming

100MN stabbers aren't meta? :(

My general copy-pasta for new players is below. If you want to try PvP some time, join the "SF Spectre Fleet" channel ingame, see when they have fleets going out - they're usually quite nice to newbies.
---
The [#newbie-help channel on the Discord server](https://discord.gg/KR3hV3) is also filled with people who want to help out. 
---
&gt; General way to approach EVE as a new player, but yours may differ completely: Ingame tutorial -&gt; career agents (all if they interest you, see the Eve Uni link below) -&gt; thealphasguide -&gt; SoE Arc -&gt; maybe some exploration for ISK (see pinned message on exploration guides) -&gt; ??? -&gt; try PvP (maybe with Spectre Fleet) -&gt; look into joining a corp/alliance (see pinned message about newbie corps) -&gt; ???

Ya :( Probably explains why I "won" eve last year :( You're alright though. o7
---
I'm assuming  by "agency stuff" you mean the career agent missions. If you don't, do those, you can find them at one of your school's stations. The tutorial probably led you there at some point. They give you a bunch of free stuff (and isk)  and allow you to sample most of what Eve has to offer.
---
After that, I'd recommend joining a player corp that does something you think interests you. They can guide you better than I can. If you don't like it, you can always change corps and play styles. Eve has something to offer for most people, you just need to look around.
---
Goons supercapital fleet was unavailable to them for at least a few months at the end and immediately after WWB and they hadn't utilised it fully for about a year after that. 
---
As for dominance - Goons + Allies took on NC/PL + Dead coalition defending keepstars. Despite defenders fielding good numbers and plenty of supercapitals, they had lost. A number of times at that. When it comes to an all-out war NC/PL are not as dominant as they had been right after WWB.
---
*any offensive module, it would be beyond silly to make it deactivate let's say invulns or prop mods
---
Its it the best? There is no other rush like it in gaming. 
---
Well, that makes sense and could account for the dearth of ships in space now. Do you feel the solo picture was affected by the reduction in density of ships?
---
this is actually what i think the guy that kills vnis flies (few comments higher the chain), it's just a demonstration that it is possible
---
but i won't confirm or deny that my version is based on a 10mn dual masb fit
---
i havent flown any dumb fits yet but one day i think i'll do an oversized aar oracle
---
Dude I knew it, I leave Odin's Call because I want to brawl more and 2 days later this happens.

yeah fw lowsec is an eco-system. One part dies and it affects the rest.

Love those Phantasms!
---
Good vid as always, however didnt really enjoy the text screens with black background.
---
Would love to see a video of that assjamming ( Õ°‚òâ Õú ñ Õ°‚òâ)
---
I always recommend new players go join up with Eve University. They will show you the ropes for basically every aspect the game has to offer.
---
Very interesting, thank you so much for taking the time. I'm going to give this a look.
---
RIP [Draugr](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a7z0h1/the_story_of_bitter_moon_the_foundation_and_rooks/ec7ec8u/?context=3), the first faction Battleship I ever owned and first battleship I ever flew in combat. It died while trying to neut out some tackle ships to get the gang of grid. But it died as it lived, on the fury road, with chrome in cargo and drugs coursing through the pod goo.
---
&gt;there is an actual counter to kiting whereas before there were only half-measures
---
There were pretty solid counters to kiting previously, projection heavy ships worked wonders against kiting ships. Damps were awful to play against too. Interceptors and suicide atrons were also very much viable tackle ships..
---
You also had the option of flying similarly built gangs, rather than gangs that rely on scramming anything you want to shoot.
---
To think that MWD fit drakes had no counter would be stupid.
---
Thank you. I'd love to see a post with your ideas on how to fix it.
---
ecm supermancy..  jam those who  tell ecm is too strong,kill them last
---
You know there are filters, right?  So you can click the ammo filter, and see just ammo? Or invert it and not see ammo?
---
Which does pretty much what you want.
---
Group, is not, charge, all
---
hey this sansha ship penetrated your  HEAD. poor implants [*]
---
LOL dude, its not the PvP, or at least not just PvP. The prospect of "AFK VNI ratting" with the end game of "AFK Multiboxing" and "required" alts, of any sort is a fucking turn off for so many people they outright quit the game once they come to this point. They're better off going anywhere in the game **other then** botsec.
---
Serves you right. No, not really. But you are welcome back when ever you feel like it.
---
walking in stratios :D
---
Yes I meant those, thank you for your advice
---
Ty, I'm going to look through all of this
---
What is the Eve University?
---
get professional help
---
/r/iamverysmart 
---
Add to the reasons already listed here, don't forget botting, macroing, AFK ratting, AFK mining on mass scale. I think Eve Online could be a very close contender for the record number of players that actually do not play the game, if not the winner.
---
Hello me me have goon alt for krab
---
me goon alt krab very safe
---
me click fleet browse and look for JU- standing
---
i click join and say `hello goonies`
---
i then warp to the big site and press the shoot on the bad asteroid
---
it is very hard and sometime i get scared... maybe i forget my goon comms log in details because i never have to join...
---
but i work hard to keep me safe and keep notepad file with log in
---
if i make one small mistake like fall asleep i can die... this scare me
---
Sausage party...in space.
---
Coulda, woulda, shoulda, Monocle.
---
That is correct. The EULA doesn't explicitly say that you should delete the tokens, but it does say that
---
&gt; Developer acknowledges and agrees that no Application shall be used (a) to inject, deliver, or activate malware, worms, Trojan horses, or other bugs, (b) as a means of phishing or spamming, (c) **as a means of tracking Player information or Player activity without the express knowledge and consent of such Player,** (d) **as a means to misappropriate a Player's in-game items or other information**, or to otherwise cheat, scam, or defraud Players who subscribe to the Application, or (e) as a means of implementing a denial of service attack, distributed denial of service attack, or other method of disabling or denying access to EVE or the Licensed Materials.
---
And usually people give their consent to have a look at their account in the context of recruitment and not prolonged tracking of your activities. As you and I already stated above, currently it's up to the player to revoke access, but alliances that keep the tokens indefinitely aren't really out of the grey area either.
---
Wait you‚Äôre Toddfa? :O I‚Äôm a big fan. Love your videos man! Hope you keep making more 
---
Ahhaha
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Trucks
---
The in-game lore has the Jaguar and Wolf, the Minmatar Assault Frigates, being constructed by the lore descendants of the Ram truck company. I don't know when they started being called Ramjags, but it's sort of stuck.
---
I always was in the captains quarters and miss it alot. It made the game feel just a little bigger
---
battering ram. The purpose of the ramjag is to ram itself into your face.
---
Do you not fit ECM? Every time I fly one of these I get killed by ecm. All good kite smallgangs come with keres and hyena for a reason.
---
You need fleets of 5-10 dudes usually to kill PVE ships, at the very least to survive the Sleepers. Ive had my setup jumped by 15-20 guys before and they got wrecked 
---
Thanks for including my footage in your video! Glad to see you are back at it! Keep up the great work!
---
can you explain why the current owner would be relevant?
---
looks like a hipster pixelgame for your smartphone ..
---
Well what can you fly so far? First I would plan out your training(you‚Äôll appreciate it a lot in a year trust me) 
---
If you have absolutely no idea yet I would unironically look up the brave newbies 120day training plan ([here](https://pastebin.com/Q4b0S2qV) ). 
---
I use it for all my new alts. With modifications.
---
-Add gal frig 5 with Cal frig 5 to unlock enyo
---
-Add min cruise 5 and swap tengu subsystem skills for loki (best t3c)
---
-Add Amarr Frig 5 when training interceptor so you can use the malediction (best inty) 
---
-Add Min frig 5 &amp; Astronautics 5, astro pin/rangefinding 4 &amp; hacking /data analyzing to 4 after the bombers (So you can scan good it‚Äôs really useful)
---
-Add Mining Frig 5, Industry 5 gas huffing 5 after you can scan
---
- Add your favorite race‚Äôs industrial ship to 5 and unlock the Deep space transport (when you need to haul but might need to train industry 5 early)
---
After this you can fly
---
-Malefiction (pvp)
---
-Osprey Navy Issue (pvp)
---
-Gilla (pvp/pve)
---
-Orthrus (pvp)
---
-Loki (pvp/pve)
---
-Gas huffing venture (PVE$$)
---
- A Deep space transport and cloiaky hauler.
---
Here you could jump into wormholes and be able to clear all the gas sites except for Vitals and instrumentals. You can access these from anywhere in new eden and they‚Äôre a really good source of income. Scan them down in a scanner, clear them with the loki. Then huff the gas in a venture. One trip pays for the ship so you dont have to worry about D-scanning a lot and you can search the market window and look at all the items. You have a lot of options in terms of moving and learning how to fight in ships.
---
As far as how to do the sites ppl in /r/eve are hella krabs. As far as fighting (pvp) [watch these 4 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8HD7_-Ut78RWBa0SRnj9JpXUzZhubC7Z) 
---
For the mental state of mind, [Check out Tiny‚Äôs story.](https://crossingzebras.com/new-eden-story-time-episode-7-with-tim-nering/)

We‚Äôve all settled into end game habits ... the game itself isn‚Äôt producing enough of the nostalgic fights and to find pvp content you have to travel closer to high sec ... when trouble finds you it‚Äôs usually a swarm of players .. you still duke it out but it‚Äôs still repetitive..
---
When you read the BR brag posts you just sit back and roll your eyes as if to say ‚Äúwho gives a fuck about isk loss / win ratios .. was it even worth the undock energy?‚Äù As that‚Äôs the only scoreboard that really matters.
---
I feel the features growth and ‚Äúfixes‚Äù have added nothing to eve mid to end game players. There is an obsession with constantly attracting new players but with still low success metrics.
---
Jita itself is a massive choke point for the game, it in turn creates this quasi safe haven for dunking, structure bashing and all other shit that basically doesn‚Äôt improve the games adoption cycles long term.
---
Delve is just a massive isk umbrella, and as long as it becomes a safety fortress for isk making the cycle will just continue to repeat.
---
That‚Äôs my thoughts anyway.
---
This is a very well made video! Tells a story, has good music, has comms, and an NPSI pubbie dump at the end.
---
Keep it up my dude :)
---
Really? Filters you say? Just like the others have already said? Gud jorb =)
---
What happens when your hold is full of random ammo and charges b/c you filtered them out?
---
My point isn't "how I do make ammo stay". My point is making it possible to separate the ammo and charges I want to stay from the ammo, charges, and everything else, that I don't want to stay.
---
and?
---
150m is perfect
---
90m-100m is more realistic on a avg weekday fri to sunday would be driffrent (more active neuts)
---
It's a corporation / alliance in game that structures themselves like a college for new players.
---
In game, type "Eve University". Highlight it, right click, and Link to Corporation. That will give you their info.
---
You can always complicate the filter, so it only applies to those charges which you want to keep.
---
Either way, I don't see CCP taking the time to do this, when they have so much other stuff that they want to do, or needs to be done. 
---
(There's never enough time in software development, to do _everything_ you want to)
---
You get used to it after a while :)
---
Hmmm, I don't know. That may be a bit too dramatic and unpredictable in terms of results for anyone to seriously consider. But, you could be right.
---
500mn are.
---
No, they totally are, because the player never withdrew consent.
---
If CCP wants to change it, they can easily add a timeframe to tokens. They haven't, and this is in fact intentional.
---
You're insinuating between the lines.
---
So 425 million for already existing assets just disappeared into thin air? Hilmar pocketed it all? Who sees the money then?
---
Regardless, you're completely missing the point that a company worth several hundred millions is tight on cash is laughable. Players suggesting ways for CCP to "rake in cash" when Eve Online is still making money hand over fist and players see very little in updates/balance changes and decade old mechanics that only exist today for strict inconvenience to the non-whale account subscriber is just another kick in the dick
---
I see , thanks
---
They dont have to use it. If they want invulnerability, there should be a trade-off.
---
for new players it would be great hisec to learn then null for end game pvp and content 
---
it would steam line the content, you can get just as good ore from a 0.5 so theres no need to mine in low sec  and pvp mite as well do it in null 
---
Yes those are good (they give faction standings when you finish it.
---
Another early option is to try the sisters of eve epic are. You can do it in a worm really easy or a destroyer.
---
Assault frigates SHOULD be able to approach with zero transversal. 
---
A lot of you new dudes think that balance means everything should have equality of outcome. Stop it.
---
The last time I really felt "the rush", we went out with 30 ships, started hitting a POS, baited a guy to drop his Titan and two supers on us. 
---
We accidentally bumped one super into the POS. We killed the other two. There was a mass ping, swarms of kitchen sink rushed over. Pets and bat phones were called.
---
That is the raw basics. 
---
However, in that fight I was the logi-FC and I was trying to hold together what I could of the fleet, while moving about, keeping logi as safe as I could and keep in range and keep the cyno inhibitor up.
---
I am wondering whether I should activate my main, try and get into that role again ... but what if there is no rush? Then what? Do all memories of EVE become ashes in my mouth?
---
It‚Äôs a corporation in Eve that teaches new players the way.
---
is SNUFF going to awox an INIT titan on the way back?
---

The counter to being bubbled is to cloak, MWD away and burn out of the bubble. Or to see the dictor on dscan and cloak and MWD away (or warp out) before it even lands. Because they don't warp cloaked, you expect a target to see you and leave, and that's why it's not that common.
---
ECM drones are worth dropping as a last throw of the dice (if you break his lock, you can cloak if you're not within 2k of him), but they don't usually work.
---
undocking is agreeing to fight on the enemy's terms. if you don't want to, stay docked and spin your ship around.
---
When everyone is rich, no one is
---
Easier fix: just make all ammo types have 0 volume, and 0% reprocessing efficiency.
---
What harm would this do?
---
as would be tradition
---
You probably need a TP on the bomber to apply anyway, so at that point HAMs might be ok.
---
If only you could change that order, to where you drop your inhib, THEN they light the cyno, and nothing happens.  
---
Imagine the skills it takes to deploy something.
---
So you click your mwd, double click in space, and then click your cloak. 
---

This bumps your speed and cloaks you tossing you far away do ppl can have a harder time in decloaking you.

The cheetah is better than the astero because its speed is faster overall.

Also try and stay at 2,250m from the can You‚Äôre hacking. So you can just instant cloak. But you wanna move cause they‚Äôre gonna decloak you.

I definitely understand your points. If I were to raise a concern, it would be that J-space and Null tend to force people into larger teams. Would you be worried about losing a place (lowsec) where lone-wolfs can get what they want?
---
Could probably go for c3 runners I guess.
---
The real mystery is how feroxes lost to jackdaws.
---
have a couple drinks and stop giving a shit if you get caught and killed. it's only pixels.
---
That's... not even remotely on topic

That sounds boring as fuck. Stop preventing content.

plz more tears, I use them to run the machine that makes jags.

reminds me of pl in lowsec tbh

Still can't kill a keepstar

Hey don't judge, the north have to take any victories it can get.

How to counter the Ramjag 101:
---
 - DRONES: ecm, sw, neut
---
 - Have a longer scram/web
---
 - Have neuts
---
 - Have a buddy with ECM/sensor damps.
---
 - Wait a whole goddamn 45 seconds until the ADC and active shield boosters expire. 
---
How to die to a Ramjag 101:
---
 - Multibox a retri, orthrus, and Jackdaw with input broadcasting enabled, MWD in opposite direction from enemy, press F1 because you are L33T PVP. 
---
 - Wait the whole goddamn 30 seconds without pinging off because you have to manually select your ship, alt+tabbing furiously through your rorq alts. 
---
 - Never fit any sort of ECM or other support module because support ships are for scrubs.
---
b-but wormhole man bad!!

Is this [Draugr?](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75744058/)

You realize that makes no sense? Given that both sides always have to undock it means battles are fought on the terms of both sides which is a contradiction.

Having PH in your corp history is 99% of the time not an issue.
---
Posting shit on reddit and exposing yourself to all kinds of shit both from yourself and others probably can be.
---
Good luck dude.
---
Consider euthanasia.
---
You cant because you would have to know if a cyno will be used (or you have to use an inhib almost every time), but even if you did, it would take 1 minute for it to work. Its not a counter.
---
but you include all WH space content, I guess if you are part of one of this alliance/corp, that kind of content happen once in a while no ? (wanna be wormholer btw)
---
whew i almost had to log in to asset safety stuff  
---
good work team
---
Add local to WH space - so majority players can enjoy it. 
---
Good fight!
---
Worth moving right? 
---
TEST to the rescue.
---
I have to say, I don't really get it.
---
Even 1000 goons can't beat the white knuckle.
---
lmao, classic cfc
---
You also get to use something more fun than a ferox.
---
We dont fucking get it either.  The fleet is damn near in revolt.
---
im kind of sad i didnt get to whore on a blue keepstar
---
Don't reproduce.
---
So... A wolf?
---
PHEW kept their agreements
---
Snuffed tried to backstab.
---
I think removing stain's gate to catch would be a better fix tbh. 
---
This is the wrong timeline! we need to go back and unfuck the fuck up
---
WH space best space, no question
---
lol good strategic decision by PGL/Vily and co to come to the rescue of a Panfam keep nearby.
---
:munch:
---
why? A chance to shoot Goons? Most people would take that any day
---
Sun the master said: Reinforce the KS twice, move supers, do not kill it, go back.
---
the enemy of my enemy is my friend sometimes ...
---
The Stabber is a pretty solid choice for popping frigates, especially because a lot of idiots out there don't know how rediculous that ship is for it so underestimate it - if you want proof of it take a Stabber out into FW space and watch frigates try to solo tackle you. Everyone in a frig knows not to go for a Jackdaw, Nomen, Orthrus, etc. but there's so many people out there that don't know the power of a Stabber.  
---
Just don't engage anything Cruiser sized and up - shouldn't be hard to outpace most things that are Cruisers or bigger as it's a really quick ship for a T1, and on top of that if it pops you've barely lost anything!  
---
Definitely would reccomend that ship, as you'll get a lot of one-sided fights you can win easily as opposed to flying something more meta which people will just run from.
---
PHEW is PL (PanFam) aligned, who are now with FRAT in the current war against Legacy. That Keepstar is in range of a big chunk of Legacy space.
---
So it would have seemed like a smart strategic move to get rid of it, as PL can stage supers out of there.
---
But, I mean, I'm not a diplo/politics dude. Maybe they made some deal with PanFam?
---
We don‚Äôt support alliances that break agreements.

lol good strategic decision by tau/hy and co to shoot a test titan that totally didn't affect who test decided to side with :munch:
---
Don't expect intelligent posts from /u/INITMalcanis.
---
Test Horde Please Ignore.
---
TEST don't like shooting their masters.
---
oh did i mention the agreement that Test has with Panfam about that Keep?
---
Thats the opinion of the vast majority of the fleet.  
---
any AAR to what happened?
---
If Test wanted to kill it they can anytime anyday. They defended it because fuck Snuff.
---
If you aren‚Äôt talking about custom overviews like the other person mentioned then they may have just been zoomed in?
---
Or were they in a capital ship? If it was a carrier or super carrier they would have had extra buttons and display on screen for controlling the fighters those ships have. 
---
nooo
---
I had an ECM burst on my caps
---
Ya know, just in case
---
Now i wonder what will providence do when their best friendie didn't help them afterall? Providence keepstar next?
---
Yep, definitely is a once or twice a week event most of the time, which is good because you can easily lose 30-50b if you feed (eg, we fed my NS fleet while roaming in impass this week and I haven't farmed enough to replace it yet). Gives you time to do smaller stuff and replace losses so you're ready to go again

Big fight happening right now in Mifrata system. FRT brazenly butts heads with superiour Goon and TEST numbers. Around 150-200 FRT vs 1000 of GOON + TEST + Brave. [https://dscan.info/v/ace30e874b06](https://dscan.info/v/ace30e874b06)
---
Hat's down to pandas.
---
Do TEST really care about neutrals shooting one titan vs the north trying to evict them from their space and kill their keepstar?
---
If that is the deciding factor between which side they fought on today that's a pretty sad mindset to be in.
---
this was what happened there pretty much... according to our FC
---
&gt; Panfam + frt + PHEW and surprisingly TEST was on the defender side.
---
Look suspiciously like a the setup to World War Bee MK. 2
---
Good on TEST for standing up and saying no to the imperium.
---
Earned my respect.
---
Will Pando apologize to everyine who gated there from Fountain for a guaranteed KeepStar killmail?
---
provi gots this
---
We moved into wormhole space a few months ago to "reboot" Empyreus, and I gotta say, we've had a ton of fun shooting people. Our kb isn't always green, but if a hole has no content, you just roll and try again. I'm definitely more interested in actually playing the game than I have been in years.
---
The meme gods decided we shouldn't live in a world without a Camal Toe
---
Big fights like this dont happen that often no. 
---
But loads of small gang engagements, and dont forget you aren't locked in WH space. 
---
If theres no content that day in the chain most Wh groups will go roaming in lowsec or nullsec just like anyone else.
---
TIL shooting neutrals is a bad thing.
---
Honestly I didn't expect this Keepstar to be repaired.
---
Us rambling about Olmeca and shitposting about the NPC Delve antics baits all the grr gooners into posting their support for him. It's essentially become Horde's new narrative - and our enemies are becoming consumed with being a part of the white knight bandwagon. This allows us to carry on all our other shit that otherwise goes unnoticed, thanks!
---
What do you mean?
---
Yeah, sure lol 
---
This^^
---
and the EVEVERSE is a better place
---
Snuff broke their word. It‚Äôs important to demonstrate that we do not respond well to that.
---
Oh no that was super top secret. No-one would have ever found out about the Keepstar agreement within 6LY of Catch and Providence otherwise. 
---
god bless the camal toe
---
crying neutrals dont help you is kind a strange too then.
---
Wait I thought PHEW/HTP were PL alts?
---
Where are all the "TEST are goon pets" posts today Panfam friends?
---
It was an awkward situation but something something diplomacy. 
---
I mean my group is C4 scum and we get crazy consistent content. We get to ~~whelp~~ fight the C5 groups constantly and we get amazing chains through our C3 so it really is the best of both worlds.

If a "third party" started anchoring a hostile structure in FRT space and TEST formed to defend its anchoring, you can damn well bet FRT would be saying TEST broke the NIP.  Intentions were clear, whether they owned the structure or not.  In a world where structure transfer is just a click away, defending any hostile structure can easily be interpreted as hostile action.
---
Attackers tried to show up. They got stuck enroute. 
---
SNUFF KINGS OF LOWSEC
---
Good idea!
---
everyone formed, tidi happened, snuff starts leaving, everyone confused, now theyre still stuck in a tidifest
---
TEST leadership gave the fleet the impression that it was a Keepstar kill. Then said "we came to defend." 
---
Denied to shoot on FRT, Horde, and PL, but was okay shooting goons.
---
Fleet members were very confused. Mutiny and silent refusal to follow orders commenced. FCs demanded ranks explain their qualms. FCs tried to explain the backstory but the damage is done.
---
 TEST ranks will think twice before following the FCs next time.
---
aren't gooners neutrals too tho?
---
Poor Snuff, they backstabbed every competent group in EVE + Tapi and are confused as to why people would rather blob them than help them. 
---
so, any after ~~action~~ report?
---
Wrong! H296 is best friend
---
Sub 100mil is hard. Your best bet I would think is 2 bombers with bombs fit. Bombers are a pretty easy train and 2 bombs will alpha pretty hard. 2 decently skilled bombers should be about 1200 dps and they're surprisingly difficult to kill because of their tiny sig.
---
Everyone is capable of positive change.
---
wow who in TEST did this agreement? way to go to loose all respect from your own members
---
til shooting people's titans is a good way to get them to help you out, or at least not form to stop you, when you do other stuff later
---
Are you refering to the move op?
---
This is just plain dumb. Anyone with half a brain knows why TEST did what they did. Not exactly hard to figure out.
---
We didnt expect to have to deal with Test either. Was just a bit to much
---
Why would TEST want to help the same group that backstabbed them for a few titan kills?

Let me get this straight. You're saying that dropping a gun to counter a whole ship is math unbalanced in favor of the ship?
---
Why don't you post with your SNUFF main? Your reddit history makes it's super obvious you're in SNUFF. What's with the pathetic guilt trip alt posting? 
---
i get both positions
---
on the one hand, this keepstar is too far away from tapi space to be of any strategic consequence to them, and publicly slapping snuff in the face for a perceived slight has a lot of value for their diplomatic clout - you fuck us, we fuck you back, right?
---
but on the other hand it was basically a free keepstar kill, a lot of panfam subcaps to shoot, frenemies to not piss off, and many diplo headaches avoided if they just did the expected thing and fell in line with goons
---
Couple of teaspoons?!! Trying to make your heart fly out of your chest?
---
I like TAPI now. All is forgiven.
---
You idiot, they allowed us to anchor forts on the way home from Oij and then didn't hot drop our move fleets. Unlike snuff who DID drop the move fleet, killed a avatar, almost killed my erebus.
---
Sorry, this post was about fights. Blob thread is that way -&gt;
---
yes
---
I see your solution, but I don't like it. That's still a burden on Omega

TIL being dicks to 'neutrals' makes them less likely to want to work with us and more likely to work against us.

Unless you're in TDSIN

tapi don't like shooting anybody who isn't a red cross, they just do it when progod tells them to so they don't get driven out from the krablands

dont worry, they will batphone goons soon enough to fight frat...
---
People formed up, Snuffed backed down.

A Fight has sparked up 2 Systems out, after the Keepstar has repaired. Goons and Init clashing with "The Defenders"

AAR cannot be given because the 'Battle' hasn't subsided yet.

Fights are still in progress, I don't think half the fleets even know the keepstar is repaired tbh

Enjoy bro.  Eve University ftw.

It doesn't counter something out of range of the medium neuts, nor does it stop non-cap ships from applying DPS. For every play there is a counter play holds true here. No jaguar as kitey bullshit? Okay, you get free range with the ability to disengage whenever you want. 
---
It's not that the jaguar is broken, is that kitey stuff finally has a weakness
---
Wait you shot a TEST titan? Was it anywhere near a hostile structure? If so, you probably violated a NIP. That's a paddlin'

are you sure about that
---
You pitted a non-kitey battlecruiser against an assault frigate with two medium neuts (why didn't you use the cyclone?) I don't know what point you're trying to make but that drake sure as fuck ain't dying to a jaguar
---
Apparently a good bunch of a Goon-fleet got booshed off by FRT&amp;Friends a few jumps out in Mifrata and are still fighting in \~11% tidi. (Listening to the fight in comms after my Scimi got shot by 250 Goons)
---
Last I saw local was at \~1400. 
---
&gt; Anyone with half a brain knows why TEST did what they did
---
its a test fleet, cut them some slack
---
This is not even counting all the null raiding fleets groups run through statics or roaming connections! :)
---
So TEST joined their enemy and future war opponent, because they despise SNUFF for the Titan kill?  Then why plant a trap to kill INIT/Imperium?
---
Wasn't the objective, although, that kinda makes too missed objectives today... :D
---
Panfam outformed SNUFF + Imperium by about 300-400 in numbers and were in the system first. [Local Scan of mostly Panfam](https://scans.minusten.net/l/2fqFjup1). TAPI also probably would have contributed numbers towards the Panfam side, outnumbering Snuff+Imperium almost 2:1 on a Keepstar grid, so obviously they decided to pull out and leave since those odds are suicide. 
---
Camal also only has 1 gate to get inside and Panfam had control of the gate so Imperium would have had to struggle getting into the system with subs too without a bridge into the system. 
---
HTP was Jayne's thing though. PHEW has been around for a long time and rocket and a few guys moved over to PL but a majority of them did not and were not alts. The crossover came from RekkingCrew. It's like saying HK were PL alts cause of NoobMan's affiliations.
---
at least they weren't moving supers for you to stick your foot in your mouth over
---
Basically:
---
PL (PanFam) formed to defend. Everybody else formed to attack. (Snuffed, INIT, Goons, Provi, at least)
---
TEST was expected to join in the attack. Instead they joined in the defense.
---
Given that TEST's super fleet can easily be in range of the thing, and nobody was prepared to deal with that, attackers held back. Thing repaired uncontested.
---
Keepstar no go boom.
---
ya thats why we bailed - can't taken on 5k ppl on our own!
---
&gt;So 425 million for already existing assets just disappeared into thin air? Hilmar pocketed it all? Who sees the money then?
---
the investors who previously owned and financed the company and sold it to PA.
---
&gt;Regardless, you're completely missing the point that a company worth several hundred millions is tight on cash is laughable.
---
companies worth billions go insolvent all the time. vOv
---
&gt; Eve Online is still making money hand over fist 
---
doesnt really matter if you piss all profits away by mismanaging your business
---
trust me I have a lot against snuff, but they didn't backstab tapi in the slightest.
---
it was announced as a showdown. We were never told that we were gonna shoot it. Or defend it for that matter. The ''mutiny'' was only a ask for more story time.
---
The TL:DR is Snuff can't just do whatever they want anymore at least not near TEST space . Not after their betrayal. 
---
snuff alt detected 
---
they have a flag and everything
---
Only GOBBINS lie to his alliance!!
---
You're god damn right
---
Good to know you had this turn of events planned from the start.
---
I guess we've all forgotten that TEST sold CO2 out for docking rights when they went to feed to darkness. Obviously that was different, because CO2 were long-time allies and snuff is an alliance know primarily for backstabbing.

Yeah I'm calling bs there buddy

unpopular opinion: the SOE arc is one of the worst things you can do as a new player. It's the boring 'go from A to B to talk to people' that most theme park MMOs have that EVE isn't about...
---
which system?
---
So here's what happened from a TEST POV. We showed up to see goons and FRT shooting each other, so most line members think were about to shoot FRT, then leadership says 'were leaving'. Much confusion happened, then Vily explains everything, (boils down to, snuff or camel keepstar and we like camel more). RECKD started tackling people, Vily covos them, tells them to fuck off and they do. Apparently Vily telling a red fleet to fuck off is like having a free warpstab.

Out of curiosity, do your line members actually believe that you were outnumbered and therefor didn't take the fight, or is this just reddit spin to try to hide the fact that you white knuckled with super, titan, and subcap superiority?
---
I agree it's not great, but it is sort of a filter. Those who only want blood will get bored and move on to blood, those who are perfectionists give themselves extra time to familiarize themselves with the UI, and those who don't want to expose themselves to risk have  something to do that they know isn't necessarily a "waste of time".
---
asking for a friend btw
---
That's not really what me mean when we talk about dictating terms in a battle.
---
I get they are mad at snuff and want to prove a point. They picked the stupidest possible way to make that point though. Now they have snuff/init gunning for them and the guys they helped are about to be in a massive war with them anyway. The whole situation is great for panfam for sure, but seems like it will backfire on Test eventually.
---
happy birthday for tomorrow :)
---
For sure. 30 is kinda what you need for a solid heavy armor/shield fight though.
---
Didn't Panfam kill more of TEST?
---
Isn't Initiative able to kill a keepstar without any help or overwhelming force?
---
Cool video

SOE epic is EVE training wheels. It forces you to move between regions (of highsec). It forces you to mess with your overview a bit. It forces you to reship and/or team up with someone. Sure, it's boring compared to other things you can do in the game, but it's familiar enough to not alienate someone fresh out of WoW while they learn some mechanics.
---
The value of control towers is too low. I‚Äôd expect a temporary structure. Like the ones described with quick anchoring and no docking.  
---
you do know that sdnuff droped a terst move flewet and killed a titan or two and maybe some supers which i cant remember ?

so this is just  not true

---
Referring to this   
---
The TL;DR of it is that SNUFF killed TEST supers/titans after vily asked them if they were going to shoot them and if they were going to a fight in amamake. Vily saw this as a dick move by Snuff, who are neutral to TEST but had a working relationship with them and felt like they were being 'rules lawyered' / disrespected. SNUFF then posts above reddit thread/youtube thread making fun of them souring the ordeal.   
---
I've offered you a 5-5 more than enough times by now Mort...
---
The jaguar can be neuted out and its tackling capability disabled.
---
Snuffed dropped on a TEST Armor Super move op after Vily inquired to then and asked them about their intentions. Snuff decided to betray TEST over a couple supers 
---
Says the alliance that said they would be helping INIT. Then trying to bait them in for slaughter?

Sorry when did we say we would be helping INIT?
---
&gt; many diplo headaches avoided
---
to be fair if something makes the paper pushers lives more difficult i'd be inclined to go that way
---
No they may have simply been acting as a strong and independent third party.
---
Future will tell us.
---
Subcaps on the other hand got a great brawl

Don't worry. I am on my way.

Let us know!

That was an insane fight, I was FCing the Odins fleet, and honestly, it was my first time fcing a fight of that size (I have more experience in smaller scale skirmishes). I had a lot of fun, made some mistakes, but overall I learned a lot from that.
---
And shoutout to NVACA and SOUND it was fun times shooting caps with you folks. Shoutout to TNA for bringing a fight.
---
It's been a while since I've had a solid WH brawl, it definitely scratched that itch a bit. :)
---
Cyclones are going places
---
At least you made it, I got blown up once trying to get there second time after I gave up trying to get there.
---
There was an entire reddit thread about it where chat logs between Hy Wanto and Vily were posted - it was pretty obvious from those logs that they're not blue or there was any agreement to not shoot the move op.
---
Realistically, they probably made a good choice to not all in on the keepstar grid, since there was the possibility of TAPI moving their supers up to go up against the Snuff super fleet. However, pussying out vs. the subcap fleet that was on the Jaymass gate, in lowsec of all places (where you can't have your entire cap fleet bubble fucked by 20 dudes) is the ultimate whiteknuckle, especially when you outnumber them in subcaps, supers, titans, and honestly are more experienced at lowsec PVP than many of the entities on the defenders side. 
---
Fortunately for the defenders, this keepstar's death relied on Snuff putting their dicks out first, and the last few years have proven that they are B B C in ticker only; without the rest of the Imperiums supers and titans to hide behind, the chances of Snuff committing anywhere they could actually lose is basically 0. Snuff wasn't even willing to assist the rest of the Imperium in the lowsec brawl that happened afterwards, as their style of beating up people they can outnumber and outescalate with slaved machariels is not conductive to a thousand+ person brawl.
---
Pair-hunting in a wormhole like this, I'd put that alt in a combat-scanner. Put your main in a cruiser. Jump your alt into a hole. If you find a likely target, start combat scanning and jump the main in after it. Use squad warp to put your main directly on top of your target. Your gank profile changes based on what cruiser you use. I've had decent luck with blaster fit Moas and RLML fit Osprey Navies. Once you can stretch your isk limit a bit, a pair of remote-repping Stratii is an excellent pair-hunting fit, but that'll run you maybe 400m each.
---
Probably ship spins.

Draugr was witnessed, shiny and chrome, flying to the gates of Valhalla!

Trump was thinking different about a lot of things, are we meant to follow what he believes now too?
---
i did
---
but they did ops together, they killed the supercap fleet of Triumvirate, and tried on Panfam supercap. 
---
That's strange from Tapi.
---
you misspelled *wanking*.
---
Because Horde (assuming that's who you're talked about as you said RECKD) came to the timer knowing TEST was defending the Keepstar.
---
&gt;so this is just not true

i always fap fap fap in my stratios when i see   t1 explorers running relic sites. but i do not pull trigger,i watch them pull their when container explodes,i just bring popcorn for good horror movie "deadly relic site" 
---
What code because there was never a "code" between snuff and test. So you would ignore dank frags for the sake of being nice? Please....
---
I challenge you.
---
Apply to Out of Focus (Odin's Call) and come try some wormhole shenanigans with us.
---
Then come back to this statement, I want to challenge your view.
---
One thing we can all agree on is fuck Snuff
---
That wasnt any agreement lol, it was just one idiot that asked if one group is hunting them and he was RETARDED enough to believe in amswer he received. What the fuck answer you expected? 'Yes, we want to kill your move op so please jump in and if you are kind enough dont jump in faxes'?
---
If you assume every capital you catch is going to light, you'll be prepared, and if you get yours down before the cyno goes up, it is in fact a counter.
---
Considering the number of cyno fit caps that die every day in EVE the problem most definitely resides in the tiny space between your ears.
---
Sure...
---
Cept for the fact that the defenders brought overwhelming force of their own, and somewhere between one and two thousand ships.

TEST joins attacker in WWB mk2
---
Get evicted by their "friends" after, again.
---
thought my sarcasm was pretty clear to be fair
---
That‚Äôs what the drone bay is for. Even if you carry 2 ecm drones the others should be dps
---
TEST didn't agree to work with Snuff, TEST agreed to work with INIT. They then threw that agreement out the window after we found out they planned to kill Snuff, then INIT. and then leave once it was only Goons.  
---
I think most people can understand Vily's hate boner for Snuff, but he went further than that this time.
---
As in, set up a filter for everything EXCEPT ammo
---
I guess we'll see what, if any, backlash there is from this regarding imperium and TEST. If nothing happens I'm sure they won't really care and things will continue as if nothing happened.
---
If TEST now start getting the brunt of it from the Imperium I guess they'll look back on this and probably regret not even flipping mid-fight to get some super+titan kills.
---
Ti-di kills brain cells
---
Panfam no match for our t1 destroyer fleets :P

The keepstar owners that they JUST defended killed a TEST titan!

---
Whatever hallucinogenics you are on, could you please pass them around as they appear to be pretty good. 
---
If you stick to one account then I suggest contemplating getting your two alts trained up in PI ASAP. It‚Äôs roughly 14 days training per alt and it will get you at least 80 mil passive income per month even if you do PI in hi sec, and far more if you graduate to low sec or wormholes.
---
A more common approach would be to move to two omega accounts - the freedom of a second account is in having a second go at starting but this time actually understanding what the hell you are doing. You can be more targeted in training your second main, and if you use deals like the star pack dlc to start that second acc you could use the multiple training certs to get all of your alts PI ready - 160 mil a month from hi sec PI or over a bil a month if you are in null or wormhole space. At this point you could happily sustain yourself in pvp ships with only very occasional vni ratting.
---
One definite tip is to use one alt char as a banker. It saves you waking up after a nights drinking to find you just whelped a billion Isk of shit fit bling bellicose‚Äôs because you drank too much rum. Even an idiot like me is wise enough to realise that if I am drunk enough to be struggling to transfer money between chars then I should either just fly destroyers or go to bed. 
---
Don‚Äôt enter the game intending to plex chars from in game actions. It takes time planning and effort. An eve sub is around four beers, or a take away pizza, it‚Äôs just not worth screwing up your game time for the sake of saving pocket change. 
---
At least SNUFF can form up and fight on Reddit.

FLEET [255]
---
Ok all don't shoot anything that's not broadcasted...
---
Test will.....be....friendly in fight
---
What FC?
---
Say Again Fc....
---
Did you say TAPI are "blue" FC
---
What What WHAT?!!
---
FC clarify...you said Test are friendly this fight...
---
Soo these convos with INIT. Saying you would be with them are all false?
---
***D√âJ√Ä VU***
---
But it does hurt the ship. Fir some fits you have to balance ammo and other consumables in the same way you do the fittings themselves.
---
Would your ammo bay ADD to the existing cargo bay, in which case a bunch of other fitting options might become available. If it was part of the cargo bay that was partitioned for ammo only, then people now have less space available for general loot. It's a more complex problem than you might think.
---
Honestly, I think that could do it. 
---
Several times over
---
:dagger:
---
I'm talking about personal codes. For example, mercenary work and the honouring of ransoms is a very uncommon trait amongst some pirates in new eden, but it happens.
---
Actions should come back to bite you in the bum! This should be what new eden is like, make your own drama, spinning your own story. It's good stuff.
---
im curious to see any convo with me that says anything close to that
---
Aaaand I just came back from BlackRise...no one home...two hours of my life I'll never get back.
---
to be completely fair
---
1600 subcaps is a threat to a super fleet with or without caps of their own
---
I have no idea why, but I can imagine him flying a sig tanking frigate while enthusiastically weaving and dodging at his PC hammered thinking it helps.
---

You didn't miss any thing.
---
Context is a thing. This post lacks it.
---
Totally had nothing to do with the fact that Elo trapped 1000 goons in Mifrata with 10% Tidi right?
---
Wow, I damn near needed a fire blanket to read that one.
---
The lack of local isnt what makes wormholes unappealing to the average player, it's the massive time sink involved with finding content.
---
Yeah, I think I'm getting addicted too. Five years in and still not sure if I want to get into EVE.
---
I've thought about going to WH space but never could find a decent group who would take me.
---
Apparently snuff can't win when it's own blobby tactics are used against them. LOL!
---
dae tapi = trump?
---
tl:dr SNUFF biggest pussies ingame they never show themselves if its not 100% win.
---
I don't hate SNUFF. But sometimes we pew pew each other.
---
You thought we were going to contest that with Supers/Titans?
---
i fly a rorq. ive lost a rorq. you only loose rorqs during one of two times.
---
1:youre a bad. 
---
this could be because you dont have any tank, or no panic...or youre gating it....in my case i tried to bait a small group into a drop and gated into a HK fleet. i was bad.
---
2:you are mining without a response fleet.
---
PANIC gives you  minutes of moving anything youll need. SNUFF tackled one of our rorqs a couple weeks ago, and we were able to form not only a small fleet in system, but another fleet that was gonna get cynoed onto the rorq, and that was before PANIC was hit. mine only where you can get support. only kills you see on zKill here from bads 
---
Sooo, you want them to implement some for of dynamic cargo bay?!
---
Does it work for bombs? Burst charges? Probes? What about drugs? Cap Boosters? Fighters? Drones? Fuel?
---
There are many things you might need to take with you, I don't think we need cargo space for each.
---
vily? naive? you don't say
---
Its nice to have friends isn't it...
---
And apparently, Snuff was dumb enough to think they could do that without long term repercussions.
---
while i agree with you that snuff never made any formal or informal agreement not to shoot those supers
---
it was still a dick move to shoot them
---
If you see any ships on d-scan while uncloaked or while you have probes out, get out of there.  If you saw them, they saw you.  Even if it isn't a combat ship, there's no saying they don't have a combat alt or a friend at the ready to come and jump you.  And once they see you, they've got the scent and won't stop until you're dead.  Get three or four systems out and then go back to your normal scanning activities.
---
I thought Snuff was a strong and independent alliance? Isnt that why they left the imperium to go stomp out all fun in Lowsec?
---
Its alright fam we got u, we won't let big bad Snuff bully provi.
---
I mean TEST may remember Tribute, but they probably also remember Delve and Fountain before it.
---
I'd be careful before unironically talking about being being evicted by friends lol.
---
Actualy, during Talking in Station, Vily already state that TEST will defend this Keepstar ([here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/396986381) at 35 minutes for people who want to check). The Init spin that we try to bait them is kinda funny
---
If you can't fly things for WH brawl apex comps, could always join a C2-NS group or a C4 corp until you can fly command ships. Also a good way to get people who can vouch for you. Trust matters a lot in WH corps, which is great when you're in one and frustrating until you are.  
---
5k ppl?
---
I touched the camel toe today
---
Same but I am always drunk so... yea!!!
---
vily didn't personally convo rocket and ask him point blank if he was planning on killing seddow's tar tho
---
Maybe Test likes the status quo and wants to maintain it?
---
hey remember that time snuff decided to betray literally everyone other than goons to kill one shadow cartel titan
---
A majority of TEST was actually upset that FRT was allowed to sign a NIP so early.  Most line members wanted to (and still want to) erase them from the server.
---
Surely they will flock right back the arms of their friends who last evicted them and hurfed about doing it again just a while ago?
---
I mean sure? But titan kills are so commom these days that nobody truly gives a fuck other then tapi apparently. It still doesnt make sense to save a known enemy ks over a single titan kill. If thats why tapi truly sided with panfam then thats honestly quite sad and they deserve whatever happens to them in the upcoming conflict 
---
Retarded enough to believe a group he worked with would actually be straight with him and not meme him for literally the same ISK he sent to them for SRP a week before. 
---
It's vily's bad that those 2 supers and titan died. It's Snuff's bad if they actually want TEST to work with them in a meaningful way again. You reap what you sow. 
---
having been in karmafleet before yes there very much is a difference 
---
PvP is a dick move. PL 2019. Bless. 
---
I'm in the US too and sorry to be the one to tell you but we aren't the majority in Eve. EU is the strongest TZ since ive been playing.
---
That's Seddow and he's not a real person.
---
your right it was 20 dreads and 3000 people in jackdaws
---
TEST will do what's in their best interests. I'm just calling you out on the hypocrisy. Pot, kettle, stone, glass house, etc etc.
---
Good f*cking lord, learn to ZKILL please.
---
at no point did i agree to work with init. You found out we planned to kill you because Jay told you i did. Something i would have gladly told you had you convo'd me. you ignored the convo's we had earlier in the day and what i said on TiS earlier in the morning. 
---
They're more like guidelines than actual rules. 
---
You're correct, however as goonswarm alone brought well over 1000 people themselves, its not like it was 1600 subcaps vs. 100 titans.
---
What? In Delve the only Rorquals that didn't get saved by the umbrella were the ones who didn't have a cyno or ozone (bad), or didn't have a PANIC module (bad), disregarded a coalition deployment (terrible), waited until they were half dead (bad), didn't ask for help at all (wtf), or fell asleep at the keyboard. And even some of them were saved. There's no luck involved.
---
If you are worried about what the corp offers that's your problem it's a matter of being with friends you have made. I personally like that I know everyone in my corp well 
---
the difference between "intentionally telling someone a falsehood" and "intentionally not telling someone the truth and/or misdirecting them from it" is that one makes you a liar and the other just makes you a dick. like it or not, the way hy negotiated that convo with vily was dickish

"We are going to defend it" \~ Vily  
---
Question is, what content actually is for you. 
---
If contenr only means "right click anchor" and "press f1" then no, jspace isnt for you.
---
If you want to be relevant and not just be a number, fly manually while dual/tripleboxing, actually challenge yourself and use your brain instead of just listening to someone and following his commands, jspace is great.
---
A [BR](https://br.inyour.space/?s=46&amp;b=8524619&amp;e=150&amp;t=ubuvvraaaaaaeae) for the subcap fight in Mifrata 2 jumps from Camal
---
&gt; on the one hand, this keepstar is too far away from tapi space to be of any strategic consequence to them
---
TESCO invaded the south staging from that chunk of lowsec, sending subcaps through curse and jumping caps from lowsec into north Catch.
---
TEST may be perfectly safe down in esoteria but they need their coalition holding Catch for that to work.
---
When Borthole was a thing we had a roaming gang come in from null to PvP, it was super fun to have the normal WH crew and then like a 50 man fleet of suicide brawler frigs.
---
They all died of course but it was hilarious.
---
That's the point, whenever there's a threat snuff retreats
---
Red wedding avoided, wonder what videos the tapirs had planned if they succeeded.

I made it halfway through your first paragraph and couldn't go further. You have repurposed too many words. Stop using words you don't actually know.

"We are going to defend it" \~ Vily
---
Oh, you sweet summer child.
---
It stopped being Jayne's thing when he tried to shutter the alliance and bring us all to bumfuck nowhere
---
Sure, but they'll now have to grind through the shield+armor timer again, and PL have at least a week's window to use the thing however they like and set up defenses.
---
Not to mention that from the sounds of things, TEST's fleets are going to be a little busy in the foreseeable future. Creating two major timers for themselves out of spite just because Snuffed - not surprisingly - is Snuffed, seems like a bad call.
---
There's also the fact that they didn't just screw over Snuffed, but Init, Goons and Provi as well. There were a lot of people besides Snuffed who wanted that thing dead. Provi is obviously no threat to TEST, but we tend to support them when it comes to defending the South against groups like PL and FRAT. Not to mention their recent bromance with Goons over the PL fights last year. Messing with all that for something this petty was not a smart move.
---
&gt;PVP is a dick move.
---
Yeah, you could have even killed a keepstar with that attitude.
---
Are you able to think without inserting grr gon into it?
---
Just leave this here

Get aura for Android. It's got a fitting tool and you can plug your character in, tracking skills, checking mail, building ships customized to your abilities... Good luck.
---
Nice guess. 
---
That's a nice meme but it doesn't work with old guard players who have been allies and enemies with everyone equally at different stages of the game.
---
But it was a good attempt to get out from under the moronical shite you spouted above in this thread. Not calling you out for being a Goon. But I am calling you out now because you're a fantastical retard.
---
Little bit different than the "literal thousand dreads" though, don't you think? ;)
---
The simple solutions are often the best.
---
I liked how you panned in the Horde "Sound the horn" sound when the comms window appeared, after PGLs "All dreads jump to Firestarter"....
---
idk if you realize this but the pocket in question is tikle's, who are autz and they don't take shit from anyone
---
most of rc are euro so it's not like they can invade anyway
---
Cant blockade runners warp to covert cynos?
---
And algos.
---
The difference here is, it wasn't a back stab. I know that is hard for the Snuff drones to understand but you might figure it out eventually.
---
Do what you want. Your are free.
---
If you want to build stuff, go read about bpos, bpcs, production, research and stuff and go for it.
---
If you want to try exploration, wormholes, etc.. go read about explo and go for it.
---
If you want to find a group or a family, roam /r/evejobs and recruitment ads. If you want a big organisation to support you, it's easy to find, if you want a smaller group of lads, it could take few more tries, but you will find it. If you don't care, well it's fine.
---
Just find something that looks cool at the moment, do not push too much efforts / isk / plex on it first, if after a few weeks it's always what you want, go for it, if not repeat first step.
---

Dear sir
---
I have tackled your 1x Titan class space vessel and wish to PVP it. May I please do the PVP? Thanks.
---
We might move up eventually, but being new player friendly like we are they can have a really tough time in 5-5 space. The C3 gives them (us) kspace access and isk making opportunities that newbros wouldn't be able to have in a C5.
---
Certainly not going to say C4 space is the best space, but it works for us :)
---
So the answer is no.
---
So who agreed to what? I don't get it. 
---
this is why we got bought by bdo
---
Your Fc's did, I literally have logs. We also have logs of you trying to pull the same shit you fell for a few months ago with Snuff. No convo's were ignored. You fucked up and now you are doing your best "oh no wait".
---
And yes Jay was the one that stopped us, my cyno was already up and we were about to commit.
---
Like it or not Test agreed to work with INIT, you guys were made aware of the fact we were working with Snuff primarily and that was ok.
---
So backpedal all you want, you and you're Alliance fucked this up.
