 Well I'm a brand new player who just subbed for the first time and couldn't care less about the changes because I dont know enough to know any better to begin with and they sound like good changes to me anyway so I won't be canceling.
---
I dunno about the encouraging people to go out of their way to spend money on PLEX just because of this particularly though that's a bit odd, I think CCP will be just fine.

Short term gains for very few people vs long term gain and gains for many people.

CCP actually makes more $$$ from PLEX than from subs.  So...yeah.

In nullsec your stations die when shot enough.

I mean, just think about it. This is a massive change that effects all of PH, our renters, requires infrastructure to be set up, and we had moveops going almost immediately after it was announced.

No jt won’t. They have too many super pilots, and they only have to bring in one super for most gangs.

You are seriously brain dead dude. I've never pushed for this change, nor defended it, nor was given a chance to give feedback on it, and I even publicly stated my position that it's a bad change as is, atm.

I am new and I barely have any knowledge about this particular topic, but since I always overstimate myself here is my unwanted opinion that has no arguments or goals but to be opinionated. Did I forget to mention I know nothing and therefore I should keep quiet about this PARTICULAR subject?

I spent money on PLEX as a way to support game changes I agree with and fatten up my wallet some. You can support it in whatever way you want. Hell, you can support it by just creating an account and logging in to play with other people.

Maybe add some sort of mechanic to stop people warping off anoms unless they are 150 or 200km off the anom. This stops ratters from leaving, but also means the gankers are stuck there. Sounds like an opportunity for some counter pvp.

I just wanted to point out that contrary to what is being spouted on Reddit and all your little streams about how you guys aren't losing anything and the Drifter thing is pointless, that you are in fact losing stuff and the Drifters are cleaning up the krabs and botters.
---
The funny part was the subcap was higher value than the capital.
---
 Guys, blood raider epic arc doesn't exist?
---
I've actually have wondered how many of the active players are actually bots, because I was worried that it was significant enough that CCP wouldn't do anything about it.
---
Not sure why I found [this](https://i.imgur.com/pLwutRh.jpg) as funny as I do.
---
You can buy even more at once if you truly want to. It involves a wire transfer to CCP as they can't accept card transactions over 500$.
---
Really? What makes you think they're only going to drop a single super? That would be completely dumb and they would be down a super, and Goons will drop 30 supers on a gang of frigates.

Show me the last time they dropped 30 supers on a frig gang?
---
They drop one to make the small gang go away. If the small gang escalates they then drop the hammer, but are guaranteed kills.
---
&gt; You can go on zkill and 9 out of the top ten most dangerous systems are nullsec systems
---
so far in 2019 there's literally one nullsec system in the most violent top 10, if you ignore hs completely and just consider low and null you have just one ns system on the top 5. http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats/2019
---
&gt; 90% of all the major battles that have happened in the last year have all been in nullsec
---
yes, the place with vastly more people under each banner has the biggest battles, real shocker and 100% inherent to ns amirite.
---
&gt; But now im being forced to move into wormhole space by ccp. If i wanted to do that i would have moved back into my farming c6, this is were the real carebears and spod brains reside.
---
how to spot someone who never really had a farmhole but wants to say they did 101: they think the most inconsequential characteristic of jspace is the biggest hassle (ie: local). Who cares about no gates, who cares about rolling chains and seeding shit, local is surely the big boogieman, i surely would not have lost my dreads to dura lexx if there was local))))
---
&gt; There was always content when i logged in, always something to do. And I had the choice to participate or the choice not to and make some isk. Now that choice is being stripped from me because now I can do everything right and still lose big. Im being forced to fight or die. I choose death

there ya go, problem solved. And if you're aligned the only thing that can tackle you before you can warp off is a stealth bomber that can have his tackle turned off by one simple ewar, ill let you figure out which one it is.

So there shouldn't be a top tier mining ship? There's top tier PVP ships, top tier Ratting ships, why not Top Tier Mining ships? This is a game that has a increasing level of progression as far as ships. T1 - T2 - T3. Frigate - Destroyer - Cruiser- Etc Etc.
---
The Rorq was designed by CCP to be the top level mining vessel. Now they are mad that it's being used that way? You're mad that it's being used that way? 
---
My Entitlement was using a ship that was designed by a company in the exact manner it was designed for. 
---
My issue is that same company making shitty mechanic changes to the game to offset the changes THEY made which then limits my ability to use a ship in the way they designed it.
---
If they didn't want the Rorqs used in those ways then they shouldn't have built them in the first place.
---
I mean what would you have? What's your answer? You make a ship to easy to kill and to high of a cost then it's not worth flying. If you take away rorqs and everyone's sitting in Orcas/Subcaps those big fleets that form up to go out to hunt miners dwindle down. Who the fuck cares about dunking an Orca or a barge in anything bigger then a 5 man team. 
---
You don't have Supers out doing their ratting but instead Carriers or below ratters, then instead of seeing the steady Super deaths we see now, you'll see cheap ass Carrier deaths that already happen. Those Supers stay nice and safe in the Keepstars waiting until the next big war. 
---
Eve needs more players out in more ships doing more content. Not more players staying docked up because they don't see a benefit to undocking. 
---
PVP is fun when you have a chance. Just fucking throwing a Rorq out into space and hoping no one finds you and not having a chance in hell if the Umbrella is busy or not paying attention is not fun nor does it add anything to the game for the Miner/Ratter.
---
Ah, the old WH fallacy.  No cynos + you can roll your "gates".
---
Yeah, no super umbrella
---
You my friend are someone who doesn't belong where you are atm ... beeing yelled at in a game for doing something the game is made for ... unless you really consider them good buddies, you might be better off searching for someone who not only values your efforts in mining, but also your efforts in immediately searching the adrenalin in engaging no matter who it is :)
---
Don't let anyone tell you not to do something the game is made for if you feel like you want to. Everything you can do in this game is part of the game and is free for everyone. Welcome in the hype in no local :) you won't be disappointed ... best prepare some small pvp ships and go for an adventure once it hits the game :)
---
Yeah, no super umbrella too
---
Myrmidon. Cheaper than a VNI, so it is an even more miserable kill. slightly lower ticks, but that low cost means you get that return on investment back quicker.

MFW people actually decide to stream temselves rorq mining and eating Cheetos- Expecting others to want to watch them- and enjoy the show.

wow, doing abyssal pvp in a tiamat on a keepstar grid where people can warp to your abyssal trace.

that's some 200 IQ playing.

Yes please. Pith x* boo.

The big bloc leaders arent being the same though are they?

If you really consider WoW classic an equivalent alternative to EVE then EVE honestly was never the game for you in the first place.
---
&gt; Guess what? You were killing those krabs anyway
---
  As someone who's rolled around FRAT space- watching the endless streamd of VNI's landing on forts when you appear in local, this is gonna make it *easier* to find and kill targets. I won't need a fucking interceptor alt JUST to hopefully catch a target.

They haven't defined an end to it and will react to how the game evolves with the blackout. I'm betting it'll go back to normal or they will add a destructable structure to create local in system or something similar to that.

If you say "well I'll just take my business elsewhere" because I'm giving you an answer you don't like, my response is "that is your choice." 
---
Cuz, like, good luck with that "business elsewhere" part. CCP has a monopoly on the type of gameplay that EVE has.

---
Rorquals will probably stop using excavators and switch out to Miner II now they won't be able to see the booshers/bomber gangs coming.  
---
Using subcaps for ratting or mining will be harder now too - unless you're OK with feeding, you just won't do it (I'm pretty sure I won't).
---
The game will be to use a cap for the chance to get saved by the umbrella.  
---
Earning ISK will become quite hard in nullsec, which is a positive for CCP as they assume we'll all head off to sell Plex, though who'll have the ISK to buy it is another question.
---
I'll be interested to see what happens though.  I won't go so far as to say it's going to be fun.  We'll adapt as always.

  They still can.
---
  People mine and rat in WH systems- It just takes a little effort, and *teamwork*
---
Wait.. he was *in* an abyssal, or camping it?
---
Only burners are in hs from that list. Most people have no idea how to do them effectively, and even the best has to have 4 accounts running to come close to 1 account C3 ratting. And they are susceptible to catalyst ganks. Honestly, only lucrative HS method atm is abyssal V farming.
---
I hope they just leave local blank and *not* give alliances alternative ways to gather the same intel. Think about it: This way they'd remove a tool *everyone* has and only give it back to the select few who can anchor, maintain and defend it, making the nullsec situation even *more* stagnant than it is right now. It would just be a bad idea.
---
Just by removing local, there'd likely be more fights (because you can't judge fleet strength by numbers in local anymore), and smaller groups have options for *actual* guerilla warfare (ships like blops get a truly useful niche now, where they are all but useless right now). There's also a LOT of new potential macro strategies which can be used which would have been 100% impossible to implement with local still being around.
---
This ship is worth 230 bil?? Wtf
---
He was not in the abyssal trace, he decloaked next to our tackle that was waiting on the trace, I guess he thought it was an easy kill.
---
Highest income should come with the highest risk- Not 100% safety setting up titan gate camps for hostiles spotted 20 jumps out. Then you have the added safety of refitting to brick tank, lighting a cyno for instant super help, and then PANIC. 
---
  Nothing is changing except for the intel bit. You're gonna need to be on your toes and be on the look out for hostiles- Instead of watching Netflix. Goon rorqs are still gonna be as safe as they are now. But it at least gives the attacker a chance to setup a decent strike.
---
As i said in another comment, i hope this won't happen.
---
Right now, local is a tool *everyone* can use, for better or for worse.
---
Structures like that would be a tool only a select few alliances can put to proper use, and would be nearly impossible for smaller groups to use, if they can do so at all.
---
That would give even more power to established nullsec groups and make the situation even more stagnant than it already is.
---
Seriously, this. What kind of insane mastermind would Gobs be to put the entire thing together in a day?
---
That wouldn't generate headlines or make PVPers think CCP gives a shit.
---
Even if I can't be sure if deleting local is a good idea or not (which I'm not), I can fully support CCP actually trying out significant changes like that. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't, but it's worth trying, and they're doing it even though it carries a lot of risk for them. I'd like them to experiment more and test how to improve gameplay, even if they end up breaking stuff from time to time, as long as they fix them afterwards and move on.
---
"TAPI"
---
Could you please not? 
---
Ya'll Quaeda types are emboldened these days, I don't want shit to encourage them. Just asking as a favor.
---
Umbrellas don't usually drop for excavator killing/booshing, well if you light they will but by then its too late (3 bombs to kill them), so the Rorq is getting a nerf as it'll be stupid to use them.  The current counter to the boosher gangs is seeing them coming.
---
Yes
---
I enjoy local mainly for the salt and shit talking but no idea why anyone would unsub over it. Only thing I can figure out why they are so salty is because they don't want to spam d-scan like wormholers (fucking weirdos &lt;3). Even the d-scan spam isn't that bad just means you can't afk rat and mine like some idiot to lazy to even play a game.
---
&gt; now CCP has apparently decided null players should live like wormholers.
---
wait, you still have gates, you still have jump clones, you still have asset safety, you still have long as fuck structure timers, i'm afraid to tell ya that no local is the least important distinction between ns and jspace mr proviman turbokrab
---
So go join goons and fly with a cyno like every other nullbear. Your preaching to the deaf.
---
I can accept a manageable amount of risk by what undocking with your perfect intel channels knowing its clear for 5 jump range..
---
Dscan is your friend and all the intel you ever need. 
---
Empire is way better than you think it is. Mining is the same with moons as null anoms, incursions for your ticks, and ded plexs still spawn there. Ls has 6/10s I can agree second status loss is dumb but thats just for podding is it not? Gate guns are fair cuz you shouldnt be gate camping anyways its a gay mechanics same with cloakly camping. Altho this change effectively makes cloaky camping less.. Annoying to me personally.
---
I hope we lose people like you so heavily reliant on local and intel. Cant even undock without knowing its perfectly safe. It will good for eve for you to leave.
---
Eve needs strong players willing to do whatever it takes to get stuff done not a guy who just wants his ticks and leaves. There to many afk alts as is.
---
I hope you enjoy wow ive always hated it im sure there is some reason why were the opposite. Fly safe nullbear.
---
Although not as useful, can this still fit a cov ops cloak?
---
Oh ps and jist cuz local is gone does by no means make wh space even close to ns. Thank you.
---
Yeah, it would be a shame if CCP brought some danger back into nullsec. Nullsec should stay as the new highsec.
---
Voting with your wallet is one of the most capitalistic dystopian Robocop 2 nightmare.
---
Just inject into an ISKtar, its a VNI with T2 tank.
---
  Also, make sure to post what system you plan to rat in so we can make sure it is the right choice for you.
---
Wow.
---
Eve, when i'm not playing wow. Which is exactly what i do right now with local not blacked out in null.
---
people are under the mistaken impression that you cant play eve and compete with players if your new truth is as a new player you can jump right into pvp most corps will take you and teach you how to play and besides whats it going to hurt its free if you dont like it just uninstall it

They walk a fine line
---
I'm not going to resub until ccp proves the game is worth hanging around for long term. I gave them a lot of money when they were systematically ruining the game so they've got a lot to do to make me comfortable coming back. This is a great first step, though I worry that it's so out of character for them that it's probably the exception rather than the new rule.
---
Ugh I wish anyone on this subreddit had a clue about how the bot mechanics work and realized that this has nothing to do with botting. If CCP wanted the bots gone they could easily do so. This blackout has nothing to do with botting.

That’s the evemail they linked from CONCORD. You get notified if someone uses the killright you made available.

6 letters instead of 3, ohmagee
---
Point 2 is completely wrong. By refusing to pay CCP they are expressing they don't approve of these changes. If more people leave than come back CCP would have to take that opinion under consideration.
---
There are always things to kill. More pvpers active means more pvpers to kill. I'll take lower total accounts online if it means more people out in space.
---
Eh there are guides, getting started seems to be a pain in the ass. But that's what all that piled up isk is for. Also FW farming is in ls but relatively risk free if you're one of those people who fit stabs.
---
that is why you never see a person from wh space talk in local 
---
recon prices went thure the roof because of this change
---
&gt; every now and again
---
I'm guessing it's going to be a little more often than "every now and again".  Also the massive nerf to rorqs from getting your excavators booshed (people will use Mining Drone II) - you'll no longer get to see the booshers/excavator bombers coming.  Then there's subcap mining, which is going to be much harder.
---
I don't know about you but I don't like feeding when I'm doing PvE, so I'm not sure I'll bother.
---
The only problem with this experiment is that it’s not double blinded.
---
So you have scouts, hit multiple targets, and sure enough you can *warp*. Theres risk for both sides now nit just one side.
---
Seriously people think a concerted effort to hunt and hassle people in null on roams wont involve hitting multiple targets. Supercap umbrellas blow their load, and if they dont they spread, and if they spread well, you just got yourself a winnable helldunk :p
---
TFW you forgot that a Stratios can fit a covops cloak... yes, if you drop a Drone Link Augmenter and use a 3% CPU implant you can fit a cyno and a covert ops cloak, at least with my skills... not perfect but close.  If you drop to an Initiated Compact Warp Disruptor you can drop the implant, or play with other meta mods.
---
Change the rigs as needed to match the damage profile of the rats you're fighting.
---
After the last few weeks I suspect they also have a different definition of pvp. :)
---
There is end game and its multiboxing 30 rorquals while you are ratting with super in null
---
You consider test a solo project?
---
Brb forming the Dun Raven Alliance.
---
it doesn't though.  all those people that left the game, left when it was much much much more populated.  welcome to 3 hour roams where you might kill a shitty afk VNI and then get dropped on by supers because you decided to go to a region that actually has people playing in it.
---
Yeah I'm not sure that just flipping the local switch from On to Off is the right thing in nullsec. Local is what lets a small gang dance in a circle around a blob. It's not great fun to just feed your 4-man roaming nanogang into a 10-man roaming nanogang that you never saw coming. In wormholes, the wormhole mechanics make it so that you have some idea of what could theoretically be coming for you, which is why local would have no purpose there. Local does likely have a purpose in null.
---
Yea some people are already speculating on the Miner II thing.  Its essentially 90% of a high sec afk orca with better defense.
---
If you get defeated by them, copy them.

You cant make a claim that miners havent been thrown a bone when the rorq was just recently turned into a mining monster. Or were you not around when hulks were the king miner, and rorqs were rare, used for boosts and compression only?
---
Im not mad theyre being used that way. You, however, seem to be set in this entitled mindset that they should be both the ultimate in mining and also completely safe, while operating in the most dangerous regions of space. 
---
Prior to rorqs, hulk fleets were quite common, despite being fragile and expensive. And mining wasnt nearly as lucrative, as moon mining was passive. But yet, those fleets were out every day. They generated significant amounts of content, as well. Local removal does not force you to stop flying rorqs. Your overwhelmingly risk-averse attitude does. There is nothing stopping you from changing to hulks fit with higgs rigs and mining aligned, except your greedy mindset. 
---
Yeah, so what if those big fleets dwindle down? Do you think those people will stop pvping? No. Suddenly, youll have numerous 5 man gangs roaming around. Gangs that will fight each other. Gangs that can be engaged by small standing fleets like we had back in IRC. And that environment was fun as hell. Because...wait for it...you had a chance, even as a solo pilot. 
---
Everything youve spewed comes from a position of laziness and entitlement. Removal of bubbles? Please. You clearly have no conception of the depth of tactics used in interdictor piloting. 
---
BuT muH DAnK tICKs!! Pathetic f1 monkey.
---
I'd agree with this on 99% of groups but sometimes a group needs to die for the greater good so that it's members might join a less shit group where they may grow as pilots.

no, its not deep or complex like people love to say, it looks like it at first but there's hardly any substance to it really when you get down to it.

ok.

Lol, so you guys were there to gank the abyssal runner and happened upon a tiamat?

He was cloaked off of the trace, not in it.

Domi so you don't give a fuck if it dies while you are afk

Probably. I just think this will lead to even more roams where nobody catches anything and we all go home with no kills.

We were roaming and saw the trace so sat our stiletto there to gank the runner and the Tiamat came to our stiletto.

I was being sarcastic. It would seem CCP wants to reduce the relaxation big umbrellas have been enjoying uncontested. They’re increasing the pressure on fault lines and testing those who might burst at the seams.
---
so you don't have scouts on every gate watching? You're doing it wrong. Clearly CCP wants more people sub alts to watch gates.
---
Can't catch someone who decided they did not want to be anyone's killmail and stopped logging in until this is over. This is my point. It swings the pendulum too far in the other direction. I believe this is the lazy way to do things, I could reel off lists of less sledgehammery changes which would create more situations for hunters to catch stuff, make it harder for botters and hopefully increase actual pvp. Hunting and catching krab ships is different to pvp.
---
"No shitposting in local" 
---
Have you even met MCAV?
---
Would you post where CCP explains the goal of the local blackout? While your there can you post where they explain the goal of the drifter spawns. I can't seem to find them.
---
Has it ever occurred to you that pvpers might actually want to fight other players that, well, pvp?
---
Minecraft
---
*laughs in wormhole*
---
I don't think you get it, null groups will do what ever they need to do to feel relatively safe. They already develop a shit load of third party software. CCP nerf captial application? We might have 100 dudes ready to warp on top of a titan ready to be bridged. At this point CCP may as well come clean and say "fuck you null blocks, bugger off." if they are just going to continue nerfing null blocs.
---
It's never too late for that kind of long term solution.
---
Citation on exactly what they are changing or are you pulling it out your arse?
---

By not teaching your newbros to be risk averse f1 blobbers, but actually teaching them how to survive on their own.
---
I was debating unsubbing following the goon war. This change has made me decide to stay in though. Hope it's permanent.
---
Is it their obligation to decide what is best for the game? That is CCPs job, not the fucking customer. Don't get it backwards.
---
Oh. Yes, and don't forget that they're frantic to improve their numbers enough to qualify for the other half of PA's buyout offer.

it's only the krabs unsubbing their mining and multiboxing accounts, if they all even dare do that. I got my money on their greed is too high to actually do that, they love the risk free isk printing machine too much to stop now.
---
check the post by the guy who killed him. he's literally told you how it happened.
---
T2s... Bro, that's pretty cringe
---
The standing fleet is always forever rotating its not the same person dropping
---
Can't use supers in WH space. Carriers serve little use other than rollers and niche defense. Mass is your friend when it comes to rorq defense. The gankers can only bring so much to kill it. 3b in mass max for high class space, half that if you want to extract. So if you don't want it to be a one way trip, 1 dread or fax and supporting subcaps. Meanwhile, the defenders can warp in as many dreads, faxes, and subcaps as they have hulls and pilots. In WH space, its frowned upon dropping caps and ruining good fights, unless you are defending your ratters/miners in home. Also keep in mind, most things in high class space are blingy as shit. Rorqs and dreads especially so.
---
Sneer all you want but he's right.  Easy to demonstrate: during the last deployment, with the first move op Goons moved around 4,000 characters north.  There were moveops for over a week after that moving a thousand more.  Delve was pretty empty compared to its usual population.
---
Not sure why you have an opinion on something you have absolutely no knowledge of.
---
Totally unexpected. My body is ready.
---
No, it just forces people to be more active. The easiest way to discourage cloaky camping is baiting the camper to drop you and then escalating with your own fleet.  
---
If you don't want to get cloaky camped just be on comms wIth your buddies so they can help you right away when shit is going down. It hardly is rocket science.
---
Is this real?  Because I’d love to be able to go back and show this to 5-years-ago-Mittani and see how he reacts.
---
I dunno..  I kinda feel like goons and test both have a reputation for dropping overkill on gangs.

Expect to be bosoned on a gate...

This post was a tragic failure

This time they deserve all the love they can get.

Catching bots, engaging PVP. They'll adapt. They'll start putting warp core stabs in the lows and in a week it'll be just as frustrating as it is now.
---
&gt; Youre seriously sitting here counting NPC kills and CODE ganks in your violent system count. I cant imagine being this stupid.
---
its literalaly called Top 10 violent systems (Ship Kills), there are no significant npcs you absolute retard, and if they were that would be even heavier numbers on ns. Also yes code kills people, that is pvp and is dangerous, and even if you wanna ignore that:
---
&gt;&gt; if you ignore hs completely and just consider low and null you have just one ns system on the top 7
---
&gt; &gt; And if you're aligned the only thing that can tackle you before you can warp off is a stealth bomber

&gt; "How do dictors work?" &lt; you2019

there's this thing called dscan, and im pretty sure dictors can't fit covops cloaks hmmm. And even if for some reason you ignore dscan every single ship takes like 5 seconds to decelerate while being in your grid visible so yeah

Welcome to the game!   If you're interested in finding a corp of new bros to play with that's willing to help you out and learn more about the game please don't hesitate to send me a poke.   It's a big sandbox with many many aspects... I'm still discovering new things after years of play.
---
I see this argument all the time but I'm not seeing many smaller alliances/corps complaining as much as goons are complaining _for_ them.
---
This all just feels like I "I want to be offended for someone else who isn't actually having this problem" issue.
---
The previous scope news report foreshadowed this Communications failure. It also foreshadowed a problem with asset safety. Don't be surprised when asset safety gets nerfed in null, and possibly a 4th wave change nobody has figured out yet.

I mean, it's a bad idea but I don't think WHers would reee nearly as much as nullbears are reeeing over local right now.

CCP would need to delay sigs, on the Agency, I can see sigs popping up near me. If I pay attention to those things, I just have to assume that new sig is a wh, dock up, scan sig, roll if its a wh or just play something else if I can't fight the gang coming through it.

For the next month, Thera will be extremely valuable.

One can only aspire to be able to comprehend that level of Autism to understand it. I dare not try for I would perish.

You forgot the most important part: no ihub upgrades in w-space. You can't just infinitely rorq mine or krab. You can krab for a couple hours max then you're out of sites, and it'll take a week for them to respawn.

And the number of rorqs groups like goons are used to using would clear out a C5 in like an hour.

It only takes one haw titan to boson a fleet...

&gt; there's this thing called dscan, and im pretty sure dictors can't fit covops cloaks hmmm

You're willing to pay for this perceived pleasure - the idea that in your helplessness, you can pretend to fight this battle against krabs, CCP acting as an extension of your arm, swinging wildly.

---
If someone can't evac from the citadels, then that's their problem. It's not hard to get citadel highway setup, nor is it an issue to have several jump freighters, or titan to bridge out freighters. CCP is looking at nerfing all of null if they want to actually effect the huge null blocs.
---
I don't invest in lost causes
---
It doesn't matter.  His point sticks even if it's not just one.  We might overkill, but I don't think there's any group in the game at this point that's dropping 20 supers for a 20 man subcap gang.
---
You're not going to jump fatigue us significantly with the current iteration of jump fatigue.  We can jump even a quarter of our force at a time and that same quarter will be ready in a MAXIMUM of half an hour.
---
Maybe if they make the blue timer go up to 5-10 days again.  At least then it'd only be amazingly difficult to fatigue us out instead of impossible.
---
There are also less WHers to REEE compared to the Null-sec population, for now at least.
---
&gt; You screeched Adapt or Die to everyone else for over 3 years, now it's your turn to adapt for only the next 3\~ weeks.

Seems the 'adapt or die' hoots in this thread are from the same rage-filled pvpers who cried ecm into the dirt, now they are dancing because they think they can hit players who can't hit back. Boy, has CCP ever trolled them. 
---
Just like the way Goons were removed from Dek with a massive game change that favored dogpiling attackers, as well as a dumptruck full of RMT money. You had years to get something done, but it was bloo-bloo forever until sov mechanics shifted. This little hiccup seems to favor the more toxic 'lol it's Darwinism' pinhead, but nah. Just another case of the big picture being invisible. YES bots are nuts, YES the blue donut could use some mayhem, NO your log-on-shoot-some-nerds-log-off playstyle will never be relevant to the map.

 Downvote me from your phone before something distracts you.

Is this a meme, or do you actually believe such foolishness to be true?

Seconded.

they don't toast each other's space. anchor a unfit astra at the sun and have to kill it in order to take a system. also apparently you can only bring 3 caps to a fight.

Well lets be honest it is not a serious suggestion.

Lol ok, I'm going to assume you don't quiet grasp it, either the space aids or how the super dropping works, but please i encourage you to try.. Really i do

Sure, if you wanna feed 31b isk, they'll drop more.  It still doesn't particularly matter for the point here.  Did you think you were close to fatiguing them out?

This iteration of fatigue doesn't have a huge effect, especially on home defense.

---
Are you saying that no local will cause people to play it safer and spread out less?  That's definitely possible but my hope is that people will want to spread out due to cluttered d-scans.  I used to live in lower class wormholes before citadels so ships would constantly be floating or afk at towers.  I would go into neighboring holes to avoid having to check when someone is swapping ships.  There might be more motivation to befriend people usually running sites near you, creating local warning chats for small clusters of systems, and create territorial identities inside big alliances that may splinter away

I award you no points, and may BoB have mercy on your soul.
---
I think this is great, every roam will need to check every anom from now on since they'll have no idea if someone is even in system, and if the anoms are out of D-scan from the gate they'll waste so much time warping to all of them just to see if someone is even in system.

How will this help PVP? Let’s take a look at some complaints
---
1. Bots warping off as soon as you enter system
---
You don’t think they will put bots on each gate in system to check for people spiking in? 
---
2. Players warping off as soon as you enter system
---
You’ll probably catch lots of people in the first week or two, but after that everyone will adapt and learn to dscan, keep eyes on gates, etc or just switch to another, safer, method of isk making (A B Y S S A L S)
---
Other than this, how does this help PVP? Not having local doesn’t prevent someone from fitting a cyno to bring a supercap fleet through. The people roaming through Delve will still get deepthroated by supers and titties. 
---
Will roaming improve? Probably not. If a nullsec entity can’t get an accurate readout on a fleet harassing their space, do you think they’d rather form more or less people than is needed? Overkill will be more common.
---
Also, do you think this will drive people to consolidate less? Absolutely not. Now the carefree cyno tank people in Delve enjoy will be even more desired. Literally for them it did not matter if they had local even open or not. It will drive more people under supercap umbrellas.
---
Of course there’s no indication this will be permanent, but all it does is actually reduce pvp opportunities by forcing people to be more risk averse.
---
In the end, it's not about how many people, it's about how much cold hard profit is turned out. 
---
Only time - a lot of time - will tell as to whether or not this latest decision ends up being good or bad. Players screaming "THIS IS BAD YOU HAVE KILLED EVE" and unsubbing in the short term is not good data that can be used to determine if a decision was good for the business.
---
Remember the **Mutaplasmid Panic** \- how they were going TO DESTROY ALL EVE BALANCE AS WE KNOW IT?!!!! Hell. I was 100% convinced back then by /r/eve \-- I unsubscribed and vowed never to play EVE again.
---
* Did EVE get destroyed because of mutaplasmids?  No.
---
* Did CCP do a 180 and remove them from the game?   No.
---
* Did the "expression of disapproval" make any change in how mutaplasmids work?   No.
---
I work customer service, have done so for (too) many years. Some bits to know from it:
---
* Entitled customers screaming **"GIVE ME WHAT I WANT OR I WILL NEVER GIVE YOU MONEY AGAIN"** are just another form of weather for us.
---
* *The customer is NOT always right.*
---
* They are super fickle and will go from your best friend to your worst enemy in 5 seconds.
---
* 99.99% of the time, they are lying, or so drunk on their own hate that they've gone full stupid.
---
* They don't actually make any difference to our company's profit margins when they leave.
---
* **They almost always come back,** *especially if your product is their only option.* CCP has a monopoly on the type of gameplay that EVE provides. There is no other sci-fi MMO right now that provides the type of single shard player-interactive experience that this does. So, yeah, good luck with the whole "finding another game like it" thing... I hear Star Citizen is still selling ships *dirt cheap*
---
I came back months ago, long before this change. My friend did, too. He told me I shouldn't take /r/eve so seriously. I should probably listen to him and not be wasting time writing this much in comments.
---
o7
---
And finish tiericide. To be fair to CCP, they did do a pretty great job on the AF changes and the retri nerf came quickly. One of the few really good balance passes we got recently imo. HAC changes weren't as good but the AFs are pretty healthy imo.

He was respectful. You were an asshat.  But in the end as long as yall have fun then......great.

They have a very high reee per capa, while every other area of the game has way more.
---
I wonder if it isn't possible to have a more variable d-scan with the new 64bit client.
---
Which may or may not have been run by someone else, requiring additional rolls. Then you want to scan everything down and make sure its a safe one to farm.
---
Its totally doable, but that stuff eats into your ratting time. Its why I prefer C4s. Less isk while running, but you aren't spending nearly as much time on prep work.
---
He was talking about people buying Plex with isk.
---
more dancing!
---
2 isn't totally right.
---
You buying Plex with isk is what gives Plex value for people to have reason to buy them with cash
---
They have metrics they can see. They are expecting a lot of backlash from implementing this change, so I doubt it is a surprise to them. I think a decent amount of them will come back once they realize their attempted protest isn't affecting anything.

  And what if it's permanent? Less krabs? I'm OK with this- Let others take pockets of space who want to PVE but fight at the same time.

  People have spent months demanding a solution to the botting problem- But now when a potential fix appears, everyone's swapped to "BUT BUT LESS CHARACTERS IN GAME". Take your pick.

You can convey a lot of information quickly with color gradients and intensities.  Humans are good at that.

&gt;We want to burn shit, we're lazy and we don't want actual resistance but we also don't want to be held down by rules we disagree with.
---
tl;dr for anyone wondering how someone not screaming for attention would have summarized it.
---
More people switching to abyssals will make the abyssal market less profitable and abyssal items cheaper.
---
That's fine.
---
And people learning to dscan and deal with that is an improvement still over the instant notification local is.
---
Maybe they should ensure that every first born child be sacrificed also? So there is some outrage, must be good, yeh?
---
Pretty much this.  
---
The timid will turtle up or unsubscribe. 
---
The not dumb ones flying anything nice will be a cyno away from a save.  
---
The dumb one are out there right now...have at them.  
---
Theta and most big organizations home defense fleet actually work under a proportional response when things are active.  Send out a FAX or two to make small guys get tired and piss off.  
---
They always have some in reserve if groups are trying to get fancy by get us all on a timer.  As everyone has said, timers are too short and...well...we have a crap ton of supers.  
---
Either way...good hunting mate and I hope you have fun.
---
QFC is literally where alliances go to die. I've lost count of how many have lost their soles there now.

---
The highest buy order.
---
You immediately brought up a retarded straw man, you're clearly either not interested in or capable of actually discussing this
---
That's point #1, not point #2. However, my argument can be boiled down to this:
---
I believe that 
---
1. IF you hate microtransactions
---
2. AND you have enough money IRL to SUB to EVE
---
3. THEN you have a moral imperative to SUBSCRIBE instead of buying PLEX with ISK.
---
\^ This is pretty much how I approach this.
---
Also, if I understand basic supply / demand correctly there's another benefit to subbing: Less demand for PLEX. Less demand / people purchasing it with ISK = lower ISK prices. People have been complaining about high PLEX prices; more people subbing could alleviate this.
---
Because they are carebears and risk adverse. Cant lose those internet pixels..
---
And here we see a classic example of how large alliance attract people of sub 50 IQ. You can see as this one in it's natural habitat fails basic reading skills. It displays aggressive actions as it is too confused about what is going on, and squawks at the moon.
---
Modern medicine has failed the progression of its species, and it will eventually drown in the shower.

Travel well eve_Klavas

how is it possible to be this stupid
---
Thanks fam, it peaked at 57 when I was reading your post. bet
---
BET
---
Maybe the goal is to stop space hoarding. Drifters, no local make it harder to control large segments of space opening null sec up to more groups and maybe even smaller groups
---
I mean it really is though. Wormholes are the safest space in the game, followed by null, then lowsec, then highsec as the least safe.
---
No, it's point 2.
---
You said, if you don't pay real money you have $0 value in eves future.
---
Which is untrue. If you buy Plex with isk you are giving Plex the value that gets people to buy it.
---
A month worth of Plex costs more than a month of game time. 
---
CCP would make more money if everyone bought Plex with isk except for the people buying Plex with cash. Subscribing via cash is actually giving them.less money.
---
LOL looks like you looking for easy crap PVP... no risk... wonder if you will be around in one month!  3 hrs to find an AFK VNI you can actually kill? Wow! Makes me wonder...
---
So, basically what he's sayin is you should "join" the QFC then evict them all out of there anyways and just own it all yourselves?
---
He essentially offered to be Goon renters or get glassed in the most diplomatic way possible. You don't tell someone who has been farming your renters to bend the knee and expect a positive reception even as cordial as Darkhawk might be.
---
Back to Orcas and Hulks?
---
im not rying to be mean here but those two rorq deaths of yours make me assume you don't...how does that even happen? full afk?
---
Crabbers are ratters, don't Know when that came about but people who only pve in null get called crab people or crabbers
---
He (no idea who this person is)  was out there putting his stuff on the line to entertain people on a stream.  Say what you will, people like him are actually doing more for Eve than any ‘content’ you will deliver before being dropped on by the umbrella. 
---
Enjoy jousting with the Rorquals Don Quixote.
---
The real question here is. When was the last time DVN formed it's ow  20+ man fleet with a useful comp?
---

Literally nothing will change for the major blocs. If this was an attempt to shake up sov, it’s not going to happen. TQ is too far gone already.
---
Is it just me or is this really, really low FPS...Juddering and bouncing around?
---
You literally said the point was to have NPCs roaming around 1 shotting things and are acting like that is a good mechanic and are saying that is a strawman, why the hell is that a good mechanic?
---
Yes but you can't say the people who are leaving no longer have a valid opinion because they left. It would be the same as saying people who quit because these changes didn't have don't have an opinion in the first place.
---
Or... if they want their opinion to be heard... maybe they shouldn't be quitting

"Goon model"
---
You mean EVE model. This is just how eve is today.
---
Sure, I was just saying there are other ways than seeing your ship on dscan to determine someone is ratting in system. If they start exploring them in cloaky scouts you could have a whole fleet drop on your recon BS in a very short time window, without probes every being deployed.
---
It isn't a death, it's a kill. Like I said originally, I didn't know the OP was in a Rorqual, wrote my reply 10 mins after waking up. I understand how they work.
---
LOL what does this even mean.
---
Come to wormhole space. We always need a few more people to shoot at.
---
I used to pay for my pvp ships with VNI ratting. Was planning on switching to a domi, but now I’m just going to not rat at all. Which means I have less money, and thus spend less time doing pvp. Between that and the drifters, which also take up pvp time, the game is getting a lot less fun. 
---
Also, when I’m doing solo stuff, local lets me avoid blobs easily. Random ship that I can normally solo coming through and acting dumb with 5 alliance mates in local in the next system? Obviously bait. Now you just have to assume everything is bait, so you need cloaky scouts everywhere. Basically, roaming is now going to be done by gangs of t3cs or force recons, with the occasional hotdropper. 
---
There’s no point in undocking anything else outside of a large fleet, because you’ll just get blobbed by a smallgang of t3cs that still outnumbers you, or get hotdropped, or find nothing.
---
Not going to unsub because I’m subbed until November anyway, but I am not optimistic at all about this. Nullified t3cs and cynos were already annoying, now that’s all that roaming is going to be.
---

I'll give you that is is fairly easy to see if there is a new party in your hole, I spend time krabing in my static for isk too, MCAV are just one of several groups that rage roll their static for pvp content, using them as an example. 8f you are not on the ball, you will get caught and have a lashak party for you nestors/dreads
---
Okay. Bye. Make sure the door hits that ass...
---
What do you get if you wire 425m ?
---
This is about the 5th retarded post on this sub i have read today..
---
NULL had become a destination for Corp workers... making ISK for others... Only being able to do something under the umbrella of others...  the few bold ones became outcasts and outsiders... but now NULL will become like WH space... riskier even...  CCP is doing the right change! Putting spice on the game... making the field a little even for the small guy! And making the lure of NULL greater for all those who roam only HiSec for fear of the rulers of NULL and LOW... I hope CCP keeps this changes in place and let new play styles evolve, new groups rise to greatness and see the great coalitions adapt and guide their members to glory or to ruin!
---
MUUUUM HE WARPED INTO MY SITE THAT I JUST LANDED AT!! MUUUUUM!!!!
---
The song is the perfect final touch.
---
The shift away from the Rorquals will follow for different reason.  In addition to the nerf after nerf after nerf that they have been getting of late,  without local you would be insane to use excavators.  Way too slow and fragile.  
---
The meta will shift to some T2 drone Rorquals +/- barges.  Someone smarter than me will do the math and sort it out.  
---
While drone hunters may get people to start, I expect they will not see many excavators in a few months of no local.
---
You literally have no idea what goes on in an eviction, do you?
---
The best thing about shaking up the sandbox is it exposes all the dried up cat turds, which can be thrown away for a fresher and more exciting sandbox.

*ALL HAIL THE DRIFTERS, GODS OF THE OUTER UNIVERSE *
---
Im resubing my 4 accounts tonight . Well played ccp you got me again.
---
Domi.
---
Do you accept unanchored citadels as a form of payment?
---
More or less. I don't particularly like it, but I'm not mad about it if that makes sense
---
As a dude who played EVE for long enough to know I’m too dumb to play EVE the changes, specifically the chat outage, sound like I’ll get some fun new “*crazy thing happens in weird space game*” headlines. Maybe I don’t fully understand the changes but it sounds like this might lead to opportunities for huge forces to sneak up on entrenched corps that don’t normally have to worry about intrusions as they can see bad guys instantly via chat. If that’s true then I hope to see major changes to the game map in terms of areas owned by different groups as it will be much harder to feel assured that no one is aiming at your shit. Outside looking in that seems very exciting.
---
the only opinion CCP cares about is $$$, unsubbing is expressing that opinion
---
A sov drop in a very specific system in Immensea.
---
...and the people that remain will inherit it.
---
The CSM also tends to overrepresent entrenched interests whose agenda may not necesarily benefit the overall health of the game.
---
Next time I roll into test space, I expect no less that an equal number of pvp players to join me on the field of Battle to enjoy some spaceship explosions.
---
Or do I need to ping renters for that?
---
Turning on my wormhole generator, destination=delve
---
Gonna be fun dropping a real force on these guys when they get too over confident haha
---
You're not wrong. 
---
This is why F2P games have dominated the market and subscriptions are dying. The month worth of PLEX being $20 instead of $15 definitely means CCP makes a greater profit off of PLEXwhaling than they do off of subbing.
---
However, if you're buying PLEX with ISK you are still existing in EVE at the whim of another human who purchased your gameplay for you. 
---
I need to stress, the 'promise' made for that purchaser -- that they would get ISK for their PLEX -- was not made by YOU, it was made by CCP, on the PLEX purchase pages. 
---
The enticement to buy it was not created by you, it was created by CCP. 
---
What about the follow through? The actual purchase of it? you say? 
---
*CCP doesn't need us to buy PLEX with ISK to make it valuable.*
---
I can destroy that argument in one hypothetical scenario. Imagine everyone were subbed. No one wants PLEX for Omega at all. In that scenario, how can PLEX be given artificial value? The same way it is in other F2P MMORPGs: **NPC Buy Orders.**
---
My thoughts exactly.. im thinking slyce... (ex darkness pet)
---
And less people resubbed than quit what should CCP take from it?
---
A new skin.
---
Le Meridien? Nah we’ll just have the next one at the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis or the Peninsula roof.
---
Drinks on the Quafe Zero cartel and old T2 BPO money ;-)
---
I'm not sure about the changes, but hei, who cares , anything to make it more exciting.
---
Shit, you are right. Resubbing even if just to play skill points online until I upgrade.
---
Yep.  We will see how resilient the average player that enjoys doing ratting and mining as their main activities in Eve.  If I am going to make a guess, I fully expect a good chunk of them just go away, but it’s really anyone guess.  Maybe if they have other things that they enjoy in game, that will be enough. 
---
Either way, it is what it is and the decision was made above my pay grade.
---
&gt; You don’t think they will put bots on each gate in system to check for people spiking in?
---
so log your Alpha gang off in their ratting system and come back later. repeat as necessary until morale improves.
---
I find your dislike of mixed weapons displeasing. 
---
Heretic.
---
Those poor, poor shoes...
---
Already replaced
---
agreed. but members of goons are required to participate in pvp. if your corp overall doesn't contribute to the alliance, they get the boot, so it is enforced...
---
[Later that day...](https://imgur.com/4pNyufn.jpg)
---
But how long goes it take to get to the point where you make 1B isk an hour?
---
Feels bad I’m loving game but I can’t make enough in game to sub it’s taking forever
---
Do you have such statistics in front of you?
---
Yeah, that was complete shit. They need to get a better PC if they want to make videos
---
I'm as surprised as you are. Only looked it up for to be sure it was relevant enough for the comment, and it's still alive.
---
Given that you're a retard, I can see the correlation
---
Meh.   
---
It will change the meta of mining and ratting.  The only question is if the new meta will be entertaining or not.
---
So you forgot to include the part where it happens
---
that was 4k in one op. just the first op. there were many more after that.
---
Your skill training is half speed and you can only run up to L3s for missions in K-space. 
---
Your other options could be to try to do gas huffing in wormholes or data or relic sites. You need to read up on it first so you know what you're doing. Not having a cloak will make it harder, but you should be ok as long as you make a midpoint safe and just burn in any direction so that combat probes can't land someone on top of you.
---
Is that a rage quit?
---
you realize who is right next door, right?
---
We're both right AND both wrong.
---
It's been reduced to a bunch of private servers:
---
&gt;**Perpetuum's official development is now discontinued, and the official server has been shut down on January 25th, 2018.**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;However, we have developed a standalone server app that anyone can use to set up a private Perpetuum server where others can join and play together. We have also released the source code for the server which helps the Perpetuum community in further development and bug fixing.  
---
&gt;For more information on the standalone server, see our announcements here and here and take a look at the discussion forums for more details on the community projects.

I think it depends if you consider only joining fleets of 200+ others and press F1 PVP.
---
If you're responding to me.. Know that flair baiting is a real thing,  I live next door
---
I wasn't a huge fan of this at first but it pisses off mittens so I'm in
---
Totally. New pilots get their first drink free :)
---
Sadly jump fatigue changes have negated that :/
---
Yep. Think most people that multi box Rorquals feel the same...and will have the same response.  It’s not like you could change over to super ratting either, because that is absolutely one of the least fun activities in the game.  
---
I expect a lot of multi box Rorqual people will either unsubscribe the mining accounts or extract a good number of them.  Will just have to see what really happens when the dust settles.
---
Bless CCP for this. Bless them so fucking hard.
---
Same as the last few weeks, bdo
---
no it's the cost of a good fit tiamat
---
Now analyze another game for us please
---
Seriously, put a scout on the incoming gate problem solved we used to have a guy that had scouts everywhere complaining about changes we have been asking for years for us just lazy.
---
This guy wastes money. 
---
Love it.
---
Yes it'l be fine, don't think of it as being behind like normal lvls in an mmo.
---
Cry me a river.
---
I'm always happy to be proven wrong, and this information doesn't surprise me in the slightest. Game was hot garbage.
---
That's a stupid question. Of course CCP would and should reverse the decision if it *actually* kills their profits. Hell they even said they'd "evaluate the change" in the devblog after a while of it.
---
The change hasn't even gone through yet. Let it happen, see what happens, THEN evaluate. We can't know if the sky is falling unless it's actually smashed into our face.
---
Seriously. Relax.
---
I said it before and I'll say it again: Remember when we all said Mutaplasmids would kill the game? I was one of those people too.
---
Last I checked, game ain't dead.
---
Me too, and it looked like possible garbage, so I never played it. YouTube vids of it didn't impress me.
---
Eve. 
---
And I'll be roaming nullsec, which I haven't done in fucking ages.
---
I don't think you understand how botting works. These chars can be on from downtime to downtime. I mean if you want to try and beat a bot in order to frag a VNI every now and again that's your prerogative lol.
---
It's going to be a war of attrition. A steady campaign to continue to harass their miners and mission runners will yield results. They just want to keep reinforcing the idea that they are untouchable so people don't try
---
What does making the abyssal market less profitable have to do with anything?
---
Still doesn't fix any problems though. Switch from mashing F1 to mashing V, so fucking engaging.
---
If this game has actually fun multiplayer PvE opportunities...
---
Not something half assed like incursions. Something a bit less repetitive or at least with more pattern.
---
I love how there was so much planning involved that leadership forgot to mention any of it to half their renters, but remembered to take their rent less then a week ago
---
huh? I don't afk sorry, prefer to actually target shit manually and play the game. Also I fly logi, tackle and ewar so let me know where F1 comes into that.
---
Great counter argument. I'll check back in with you in a month to see how this panned out for you.
---
So smart of you to give money to a company before they even roll out what they are promising lmfao.
---
that's ...why I'm here.
---
Eve.  PVP is back on the menu boys
---
i mean, that's most pvp. 50-250 people in a fleet. solo+small gang is not the only kind of pvp
---
But that means that CCP would have to fix their broke ass infrastructure... it still has on and off again problems to this day.
---
Just deleting local is easy lmao
---
Is that you, Falcon?
---
Why do you think this.  The highest executive for the developer publicly told us that he wanted to unroll some of the fundamental constructs players of his game have been leaning on, over a month ago.  Why would you suggest that it wasn't planned.
---
they're mostly unsubbing because of the drifters, not because of local
---
we should fix that. we're good at stuff liek that i think. will ahve to make sure to bring probes doe.
---
Because the scalability of Nullsec income is it's biggest draw. You can't scale C6 dreads in the same way you can scale rorquals, VNIs, or Moons
---
I believe the current roll out will look like a delay at first and move to a black out as the intensity of the event rises. Most likely empire space or capsuleers will find a way to restore portions of local. It will be an interesting mechanic to see roll out
---
Material prices are taking off at the moment though.
---
How do you deal with Karybdis Tyrannos in the abyss?
---
Wormholes have a lot of the same limitations, yet raters and miners are killed everyday. Some despite having scouts, watching dscan, etc. Covops ships have a small window to pick them up on scan. Miss that window and you wont know its there. And arguably, abyssal are not "safer" for making isk as I can prevent you from reentering the abyss by anchoring a mobile depot on your trace. Now you are stuck with me. 
---
Though I agree when it comes to null empire responses, overkill will become worse than it already is. Though null empires already tend to overkill things as it is. 
---
Not everyone wants to be under a null empire's banner. If I was to go back to null, it would be to live outside the null empires as I refuse to rejoin the blob. It was rarely fun, and more soul draining. I suspect quite a few people feel the same.
---
Who?
---
At the moment they will be switching to to the same as wormhole space according to their update. God knows why they call it delayed mode, but it's not really delayed: 
---
&gt; Local chat in all nullsec space will be switched over to delayed mode. This means that it will behave as local chat in wormhole space, with pilots only appearing in the local population listing should they choose to post messages. 
---

Was fun to be on grid in an apostle. Come back next time! Maybe the boson will go off a second earlier and get yall on the way out

Only kind worth talking about.
---
QFC isn't that bad, it's a great deal for new players/alliances with new members. Highsec is very close, good money, and if your lucky goon help from bigger null blocks punching the care bears. 
---
The 3 cap rule is really nice as it evens the playing field between wealth and numbers of a new alliance/players. Seriously, who wants a tie dye fest anyways. Plus it allows capital PVP in a small gang set up. Honestly where else are you going to find that? It seems stupid and it is, only when people don't understand the concept.
---
What is bad:
---
 because of attracting new players and the lack of experience/skill points most new people are very happy with the couple of systems they get and the desire to fight over other systems isn't there. When atlas was around they were quite aggressive before they left the QFC arena. However, everyone was a care bear and not much could be done. That's what happens, care bears don't/can't get teeth cause no one teaches them. Imbor is a good teacher/FC but he is a bit snobbish because he is in his end game mechanics and he forgets what Eve can be like for new players.The time I had set up a gentlemans agreement between Cold Steel and us was great and fun for keeping subcap and cheap fights(T1 cruisers and battle cruisers). Being new, flying any type of t2 cruiser was insane and expensive for a new player. 1 month train time on a character less than a year old for just the hull? That's insane! if you want munin fleets there is plenty of fozzy sov null to go fumble around in/for. I left to follow friends and I regret leaving.
---
Goons are goons, they take what they want and don't really care. They have all the 64s and OK fine sometimes they share other times they drop supers on a covator. 
---
Apparently a group was kicked out for having supers. You cannot build supers or have a sotoyo or keepstar. However, expect at least 3+ Titans or supers if a goon or initiative tackle your ratting carrier or rorqual. Or in general just expect that from them as they will drop for an iteron. It isn't technically renting so they don't have to leave you alone. The no building supers again is OK if your alliance is mostly new players, but feel free to crank out everything else.
---
It really is a nice place to be if you don't care about having the rules. I loved it. I loved being around people who didn't care they didn't have 8 super piolets with 10 fax alts waiting to go. It made me feel like I was accomplishing things and making mile markers in Eve. That I wasn't in an alliance either drowned out by those in end game mechanics or slaving away to help pay rent for some crap space in null with no protection. It isn't as safe as other null sec areas. It's ok at most times but in other null sec areas there are the numbers and cooperation to deal with things like rolling WH, Intel from multiple pocket routes, and not having noob Titan piolets sucking their alliance leaders wanks to drop on anything that moves in Querious.
---
I always feel Querious gets a bad rep and I feel like it's a matter of perspective. Querious was my first null home and I'm glad it was. I feel that it could be amazing if newer players, (who haven't gotten the 'meta' point of view crammed in their heads first), could populate it. It is a little puddle, not even a pond in the significance of new Eden but that's why when you are in the puddle you can feel significant.
---
You must be new to how business works
---
your options are roaming gangs, or killing ratters. that will never change.  At least this way you have a chance to catch the people that would normally just dock up the second they see a non-blue on local
---
The ability to crash the plex market entirely.
---

---
 Stratios doesn't have the big fat drone tracking bonus that made it easy to use heavies for everything.
---
Youve been preaching on this sub about how horrible this change is for days now. Eve is a risky game. This is what kept it alive. Its been dying because of how risk adverse it has been becoming. For every player like you, theres 5 resubbing to enjoy the game the love.
---
Apparently so
---
 Looks like more people want to play again than want to leave. Game was getting stale otherwise.
---
&gt;  Hunting and catching krab ships is different to pvp.
---
No, its absolutely fucking not, its a Player Vs Player engagement, the very fucking definition of PVP.
---
Its hilarious all you cocksuckers try and paint it as something else to try and shame players but you all just look fucking retarded.
---
Not to mention half the time you tackle a krab you're hoping for a manageable defense fleet to fight.
---
You're also ignoring the fact that those same roaming gangs hunting ratters now have an increased chance of coming across another roaming gang out doing the same thing, in a non shocker this USED to happen a lot.  Then they pretty much killed off all the reasons to roam and its kinda shit now.
---
Board membership and voting rights
---
You guys sure don't like to be reminded about all that casino money, huh?
---
Dude I like your style. Now you have to come slum with us on Thursday. Don’t even have to reveal your u/name (obviously). Just come have a (few?) drink(s) with the nerds.
---
Your very own game called 'EVE Online'.
---
Certified toxic.
---
You will probably see a lot of people discounting my opinion just because I am a goon.
---
But I have problems specifically with the Drifter fleets. No local seems a bit extreme; but it's nothing special, people can adapt to it and in the end it's still fighting people. Which is what EVE is all about.
---
Drifter fleets 1) doesn't bring new PvP content 2) give zero rewards 3) it's an endless horde that is not winnable against. If it functions like Incursions I would be fine with it --- even if the payout is not much, at least we can see the source of it and win against it. But they are not at the moment. Their current form also discourages alliances to fight other alliances for land and content --- you can't do this when your home is on fire.
---
I don't know what is the reason for you playing Eve, but I play EVE for the thousand man fights, for coalition conflicts, for the propaganda and occasional tool making/wealth creation (manufacturing and reactions primarily). I did see EVE in a stagnant spot after the last war, so I am subbed but AFK right now. Now my sub is running out, why would I keep subbing? There are no wars, no propaganda, and my krabbing tools are now dangerous to use. 
---
I was to consider doing the epic missions while waiting for the next war, which now that local is going to die is gonna be easier, but the derision I get from this sub reminds me I don't have to play this game. There is another MMO I am playing with my friends, and there are contents I want to clear on that game. Adapt or die is what we said and what they say now, but everyone deep down knows the ones who quit couldn't care less. Maybe when I get more time IRL I will come back and "adapt", but for now, I am happy to say farewell.
---
Been to a couple. its pretty decent. years ago though I think.
---
You seriously think I won't? 
---
And you seriously think a force recon (+friends) will choose to engage something they can't win against?
---
renters are not real people
---
wow, you must have played like 100 hours.
---
This is a great move for sure. I am really happy with CCP on this one.

can I get  TL:DR for that.

That's way too many fucking words.

2 month newbro here. I've tried mining/missions/ratting and now settled in null relics exploring, making a good living around 200m/hr in a bling ceptor. Since cloaky bombers/ t3s camping in sites are pretty much my only concern besides smartbomb gangs, I rely heavily on local/zkill to recognize potential threats in system. With the blackout, how do I possibly know whether a cloaky ship is on site before he decloaks on me and instalock/scram?
---
meh
---
Hey Suitonia, can I suggest you knock out a quick Eve Is Easy guide on how line members can go from Carebear to Babies First Hunter during this event.
---
Well thanks for showing me that Astarte series.
---
I wish I could start an alliance and move back.
---
You pvp with less than 30 people in fleet? How barbaric
---
Yes it's worth trying op, as others have said get In a Corp  and make friends. It's insanely fun with others!
---
CCPlease add cynos to WHs. Please and thank you.
---
Awesome lads.
---
How do you unsub in eve? Not paying at the next date? I guess that means they brag they will at next due date...
---
Oh totally, didn't you know? XD
---
Are you on drugs? Whats going on in your head dude.
---
They did good
---
TL:DR
---
QFC good for new players. Querious is good space
---
Grr goons be Goons
---
Try to look at QFC from an alpha toon perspective and the QFC rules start making sense.
---
The point is having new mechanics that people don't know, and aren't told, that they have to figure out themselves. It's good because it adds interesting unsolved problems to the game that people can't click on a guide to yeet their way through
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
TL;DR: The only thing dumber than the people in QFC are the people that try to justify it
---
Hit up SMA. All their leadership just left, they need some smoothbrains to replace them
---
If I had to speculate, I'd say that your appearance in Local is delayed until you speak.
---
So then why not deploy these to all areas of space? Why did they select 20 systems in delve during phase 1 as launching points? Why create a mechanic that discourages your players from playing the game because there is no counter play.
---
You can’t. 
---
One method I am thinking of doing is a max poorfit covert ops ship. And before doing a site, put the entire scanner fit along with any loot into a depot, and refit to max tank, dualprop, web and scram, and obviously the hacker module. 
---
If you are attacked, you can try to escape by scram/webbing your attacker and burning away with your AB until you’re outside of scram range, and warping off. 
---
And even if you die, you just lose a t1 rigged covops frigate, nothing valuable. All the loot is in the depot ready to be picked up. 
---
Doing this whole thing will drastically cut down on your isk/hr, but not nearly as much as dying will.
---
Sure, and that's why EvE is still an extremely niche MMO. I'm not trying to misrepresent that I want things to be easier for me. I can enjoy a certain level of challenge and risk and no more. After a certain point it's not fun anymore and I'm not here to try and flex my epeen about how hardcore I am like some kind of autistic internet doom lord. I'm just a dude trying to spend my free time doing something that makes me happy. If it's not making me happy, I'm going to complain about, to leave my feedback and let whomever reads it do with it what they will.
---
So go ahead and sperg out at me, insult me, try to bait my ego, whatever. I'm glad you enjoy things the way you enjoy them, I hope you continue to do so, and I hope things improve in your favor. They certainly aren't improving in mine.
---
They did deploy them all around, and the counterplay is to kill them.
---
No troll, renters are not real people
---
Keep transversal up and you’ll do fine
---
you can just have your cloaky camper talk in local if you want spooky.
---
no local lets all my alpha accounts be just as spooky. they dont know when i've logged back on.
---
just adapt retard
---
Yeah its pretty cool. Recommend. I always have ripped wh40k in my vids btw.
---
I got 10 accounts 2 mains and 8 ratters when local gets removed i am not planning on resubbing those 8 ratters. And why not? When i krab now i am spread out to like 5 systems and I only react when i see someone in local, i dont think i can be so attentive to krabbing the i can do d scan on 10 chars or hope someone reported them. So 8 will go to sleep when local gets removed and 8 will be subbed again when it comes back.
---
So in that period i will only focus on pvp and skip on the pve.
---
Fuck off boomer
---
Bex the bitch more like it.

qfc
---
It can’t be slyce, they’d never get that many different people actually logged in
---
Well, abide by qfc rules or goons will evict you in 24 hours. Easy peeasy. I was there before SR bent the rules and it was a great area for subcap pvp. Also goons deploy to help if bigger fish are coming to make a mess. 
---
#darwinism rules, they provide content around. I even sold my shit to them when i moved south to INIT so they have more resources and blap the area.  Upper pipe is great for catching roamers and transport ships, k7d is single gateway for pockets which can be camped for safety.
---
"I'll Show those nerds, I'll spend hundreds of dollars to RMT in a video game, that'll show them!"
---
Ex low sec pirate here. It sucks when your favourite way of playing is taken from you. I would definitely recommend letting the dust settle before abandoning EVE but if WoW is more your thing then good luck with it.
---
oh hi, i see you are retarded and are responding like i am sad not to be a part of the QFC.
---
Please anchor on your FC and F1 please.
---
Is it incorrect though?
---
Sucks for the botters lol
---
wtb naga fleet
---
The first wave had set spawn locations that last 6 days without changing. The second wave hit at least for test hit 95% of systems.
---
Did you unsub all your accounts? If not, you might do so ... i mean no local might increase your stress level, thats not good for your health.
---
Depends how you look at it, members of rental alliances are definitely not real people, line members that rent systems from their alliance are definitely real.... can’t wait to see everyone’s argument that they’re the same lol
---
I'm a glassblower. I am so because I stopped licking the orange hot globs of molten glass trying to find the chewy center.
---
Are you actually retarded or just a wannabee troll?
---
Well this tell much about your education and iq. I gave facts and didn't attack anyone and you are still being a dick. But hey! It's reddit, right? I have my cyno on f1 eat that
---
I'll check in with them. Currently my RL is limiting my Eve time and I don't want to commit too much because I do enjoy taking Eve friends seriously.
---
What if we make the delay 48 hours? Could be fun, no?
---
I have a part time, minimum wage job pushing carts at my local supermarket. It ain't a lot, but $200 a month is a lot of ISK to blow up for a casual player.
---
Nobody cares if I'm listening to podcasts or audiobooks while browsing Reddit, so long as my phone's off when I'm out in the lot. Way more fun than krabbing, but to each their own. Who am I to tell anyone how to live their life?
---
I drew that conclusion from your replies, not the post itself, if it makes you feel better.
---
Flair baiting isnt real. People dont lie on the internet!
---
I really been thinking of resubbing...  =|
---
Can confirm
---
I would vote with my wallet but I've already run out of accounts to unsub.
---
Absolutely. Put all your effort into finding out what you wanna do. I suggest Googletube.
---
As you figure this out, you can take a look at where you wanna go and who you wanna join.
---
Joining a good crew will make you love this game. Join a bad one,  or inactive one and you'll stop playing.
---
Good luck.
---
Thanks for trolling and being honest at the same time. Fuck anyone bitching. This will be content.
---
losing a bunch of people who are leaving because they can't mine spod semi-afk all day, vs gaining a bunch of people coming back with intent to PVP with this change.  
---
Hmm.
---
Not entirely correct.
---
Vale wasn't burned/invaded. Tribute was, which was co2 space. TEST decided to fight with Co2 and joined the fight. TEST was also neutral to NC/PL prior. 
---
The reason TEST moved was so they can get far away from NC/PL and not get allegedly possibly farmed.
---
I've lived in WHs in C5 space exclusively for 6 years. What corp you say you're with?
---
That argument is thrown around all around eve right now.
---
As someone who has no stake in this "Highsec vs 0.0" discussion and likes to watch the world burn: \*grabs popcorn\*
---
They should just get rid of insurance.
---
And they don't have the assets their to hold it down and utilize them.
---
Some serious WOOSH to give along with the miserable state of mind you live in.
---
Gotcha, I’ve been earning weirdly good ISK for hi sec combat sites so should be able to invest in the T2 Rigs. With the VNI changes coming though I’m not sure if I’ll stick with running them over the normal Vexor
---
One would say you're working for CCP because this is exactly what they want.  Avoid players to gain enough isk to buy plex and resub for a month. Players actually paying again will give them a cash boost.
---
I don't even know what problem.big alliances have. They already used bots all day long. Now CCP adds bots and it's wrong?
---
They never said theyll make fade the new delve. They consolidated Fade, before, it was split into pvp and pve regions with two standing fleets etc.
---
Same for Geminate. Also, at that stage, Horde alone was still not strong/big enough to imitate thst model and Geminate geography simply meant it would be dangerous to use caps in everything as hostiles could stage in NOC areas and bait and kill reactionary caps, this happened once too and that greatly limited cap content.
---
intrepid crossing's logo is actually so pretty.  I never noticed till now.

Do you even *have* subcap pvp skills?

It's a known fact that /u/ccp_falcon wants local deleted.
---
We love you Falcon &lt;3
---
:doubt:
---
Local will still be there, it will just operate in delayed mode like wormhole space. You can choose to show yourself by talking
---
Dangerous space is dangerous, what a shock.
---
You won't be missed.
---
dibs
---
Lets cure the tumour that is whiney little crybabies by making them leave and returning EVE to its hard, unforgiving core - CCP (probably)
---
That doesn't even make any sense. Are you fucking high?
---
Renters are not real people. 
---
All renters fall into 4 core groups:
---
1) Inexperienced players trying to climb the ladder in a way that never works.
---
2) Alts of people who only care about their space and assets in some other alliance.
---
3) Bots, the scourge of Eve.
---
4) Advanced AI developed and tested by CCP to replace passive income from moons.
---
None of these are real people.
---
Huh?
---
toxic
---
bless you
---
So much this.
---
So, in your analogy, are you saying that Mittens is Hitler?  
---
That's a bit much. He has a lot of enemies in the game and he's done some dickish things, but I'm not going to say that he's Hitler.
---
Honestly these are all pretty good ideas. Hopefully we will see something to make empires spread out more and need more space in the future along with no local to make EvE a truly dangerous place again. However with the danger I do hope we also see greater rewards. EvE was always about the risk/reward ratio and I hope we see something headed in that direction again in the future.
---
Ah cheers, I guess it makes sense since they want the Ishtar to be drone specialised and the VNI kinda overshadowed it. I like running rails so maybe it’ll still be an okay choice. 
---
It’d be cool to see the same bonuses on the DNI as it’s the “jump up” from the VNI
---
That’s what frigate pvp is for
---
&gt;DARKNESS flair
---
  "Don't make local mechanics hard for our krabbers"
---
I dunno about the pve crowd. Most of them seem to want no change at all judging by all the krabs threatening to unsub. I just don't want it to be the same as wormholes, because if I wanted that I'd go live in a wormhole.
---
Do any non-t2 entropics exist yet ?
---
I tried orbitting at 60km with overheated AB I died.
---
I tried burning to him corkscrew style I died.
---
I tried burning directly to him, I died.
---
Should I switch to MWD and pray there is no starving leshaks?
---
I unsubbed 18 of my accounts due to the impending local changes. The method I use to mine is more click intensive than super ratting, and I rely on local to keep the fleet safe. I do not use client management software. I do not use anything like Near2. I alt tab and move ore about every two seconds. Losing local means I will not have the ability to monitor threats, and as such this method of mining is not going to be viable.
---
We do not know how long the blackouts will last, nor do we know how long the new local change will be in effect.
---
It's just as easy to resub once the way I mine is viable again. I'm not going to pay for dormant accounts anymore. I choose to adapt to the new local changes by changing the way I mine. That way does not need the extra accounts.
---
I do not want to change the way I mine. But without local being an intel tool (and I understand it was never meant to be) I don't have a choice.   
---
tl;dr I don't unsub in protest, I just don't need the accounts if the way local works changes.
---
So flairs aside, how would a 5 (or 10 or whatever number people think is appropriate) minute delayed local make it easy for krabbers verses having wormhole style local - genuine question?
---
What’s the align time of those ships
---
It’s really common in Goons and was common in PL when we still Rorqual mined hard.
---
I bet null is going to have to look for some of that Entangled Helium-4 and fuel your own fluid routers going forward, that way null can have local in important systems, but be cost prohibitive to fuel EVERY system.
---
Even without local, null and WH are distant because of the mechanics of having and fighting on gates vs holes, and the logistics of PvE in WH  vs null.
---
It hurts them because the rely on their line members being out in space mining and mission running to keep up ADMs and bring in taxes. The less safe the krabbers feel, the less they will be risking their ships in space to bring in materials and ISK. This will start having an impact on the overall organization. It won't be significant at first, and most big blocs can operate on reserves they have built up. Eventually though, it will start putting economic pressure on them.
---
Hello,
---
Yesterday I saw the rewarding system for recruiting members and that you receive good rewards when your recruiter get Omega, but I wanna ask if it count only if they buy it from the site with real money, or buying PLEX with ISK and giving it for Omega also counts ? 
---
Thank you in advance,
---
Your Deyan

JamGu still sees usage in C5 brawls where a Scorp will be webbed down and alphad by cap gun dreads
---
EVE
---
There’s so many differences between living in a WH and living in Null, Local chat is just the obvious one. Nullsec life will never be like living in a wormhole.
---
Do you have a point or are you  just rolling your face on your keyboard and seeing what comes out?
---
Sure
---
Welcome back friend!
---
Are you suggesting a nerf? Cause it’s crazy powerful at the moment.
---
I don't know about this specific case but a lot of the time I see someone have a super out with their multiple rorqs as some sort of protection.
---
Maybe their pvp is shooting non defended structure with at least two full fleet of titans....
---
XLASBs (or MASBs)
---
Good
---
Because they don’t know that the real core of eve is “adapt or die”. Oh that and “ur gay pwned”.
---
#TEAM10
---
That's a fair point. I'd say that local is used for more than instant intel in null, and that different layers of local across space gives the game more flavour.
---
Those midslots are a disgrace.
---
That's when you sell immediately, but when creating a sell order is it still the same?
---
How do you know thats even true. You just heard a vocal minority of people losing their shit over risk. Esp the eve forums
---
*who the hell uses the eve forums??*
---
Nullsec roaming in my experience mainly consisted of shotguning systems in the hope they didn't enter warp to station the second you showed up in local.
---
I don't really mind killing "krabs" I couldn't catch before. It's more pvp\* I can get and organize myself than I could get before.
---
\* I mean, I could get pvp before, just go to any random station and be blown up, it's easy, but I want pvp where I win.
---
Lmfao at #4 :p
---
You forgot one though, 5. Players avoiding awoxers
---
is there a recording of this kill by chance?
---
In what loony toon world does joining a rental alliance avoid awoxers?
---
&gt; Ranger regiment ever owning an at ship?
---
not anymore
---
How did this get so many downvotes
---
Who said anything about joining a rental alliance ? 
---
I rented a system from horde and didn’t have to join beanstalk in anyway
---
People who play OSRS would get this. But probably only them :p
---
I’d agree with that, and I’m actually one of the fucks being crying for Delayed Local for years, we only need 10 seconds or so. The problem is, because of the way space is laid out, intel bot scouts on gates will nullify every hunter but the login camper. So if they can find a solution to that, and Near2 bullshit, then yeah, delay would be cool.
---
if this stays i might consider coming back to the game. fuck nullsec with local it is complete cancer and a plague on an otherwise "pvp" game.
---
Join a mining fleet with at least one capital in system. 🤷🏿‍♂️
---
I have lost only two ships in my last 40 hours of C5'ing, but I will say that with the nullsec changes it may be driving more people into WH's than before.
---
Cyno in a WH? Cool story bro
---
Unless it came with some major non-price related drawbacks major null blocs would just fuel it in every system. The intel given would be worth any ISK price CCP would reasonably put on it. As we've seen with keepstars and titans, price is not going to stop players spamming things.
---
what is cool about the nullsec shrinking to three groups, two of which won't ever go to war with each other?
---
Yeah that's gonna be a problem without local too unfortunately. That one I have no idea how to fix.   
---
I've always been in favour of either delayed local, or a structure which can be entosised to turn local on and off but I don't trust CCP enough to implement the strucutre idea without fucking it up.
---
I'm down for perma-death
---
How do you figure?
---
I'd remove all anoms to remove any PVE with Supercaps.
---
Change the main form of Null PvE to incursion-style encounters behind an acceleration gate that locks out capitals. The catch is that everyone inside is infinipointed until every rat is dead.
---
&gt;Vote with your Wallet
---
That's very presumptuous of you. What if I have a fabulous purse or one of those fanny packs from the 90's?
---
Here's some tissues for them salty tears...
---
If you die in a wormhole you die in real life
---
Resource scarcity plus a exponential fuel cost with the number of systems with local online.
---
The Speaker of Truth
---
Well wormholes meant the same, abyssal too, but I guess the carebears happily ran their abyssal sites for the dank loot anyway.
---
&gt;Is this the Time of the Rebirth of Panfam to actually be competitive again 
---
Nope you guys and goons can go fight each other while we chill and roam curse.
---
Huh
---
Yup I bet CCP devs have been banging their head on the desk for a while about that one. I like the structure idea as well, or some sort of engaging mechanic from either the ‘attackers’ or ‘defenders’. Entosising would be a good direction to take as the mechanics are already half there. 
---
Still, when it comes down to it I’ll always be biased and say gimme a delay )
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
Hmm, well I was thinking of it as used in FW, where it is an absolute beast, but I guess outside of that small part of the game it’s kinda useless like the Widow etc.
---
No, they covered how a wormholer survives...  They said when they introduced them, that the signal can travel through outgoing wormholes until it reaches a FTL network transceiver and transfers you through the normal network from there.
---
I endorse this. Ishtar is the way to go.
---
I don't think I'm unsubbing, but this isn't a direction I like to see the game go. It's just another thing that hurts the small guys than the big ones. If this was permanent, it would only take a few weeks before power blocs go back to business as usual. There would be slightly different organization from clumping and suddenly krabbing is back to normal and  any entities who don't have power from numbers will be royally screwed. Sure this is a cute thing for small gang pvp, but there will be less incentive for large conflicts and more reason to bluetral up.
---
though I am happy that CCP is at least trying.
---
Unless everyone keeps them subbed, logged in and active in the game long term this will only be a blip on the radar in term of metrics CCP can use with management.
---
Make you have to “back up” manually at a station with a clone bay, you will have the potential to loose SP getting podded in jspace, or a kspace system with local offline.
---
This would also discourage the use of long term system camping alts.
---
&gt;put up bitch, where that ass at
---
No the sweet ass casino money was ace, the war is just called world war bee. :)
---
This and also the ones subbing. This forum is just a small fraction of the active playerbase.
---
Yikes dude youre a troglodyte
---
What are people upset about?
---
Let me just say, as someone that's barely.experience null/loelw sec or low sec....
---
I want local removed forever.
---
&gt; I can't wait for the people that try to macro it and get banned for automating
---
good luck detecting people spamming vs it being automated.
---
most people can't tell a bot from a ratter, and given how prolific botting seems to be - nor can ccp.
---
Same goes for everyone who is crying they're unsubbing because of the changes. Unless they really want to ride this out long term, it's just going to be a blip on the radar, and one CCP fully expected before they even committed to this
---
&gt; Small doesn't mean dumber or less active, and larger doesn't mean smarter or more capable.
---
You're right, in most regards like small gang, blops, super hunting, or even general main fleets. But when it comes to important stuff like holding and maintaining space, greater numbers will pretty  much always win the objective. 
---
So yes, in a macro sense, smaller means less capable.
---
The DPS/EHP ratio is ok I guess but what's the point of having a fac ewar frig if the only viable fits have no ewar. Maybe give it gila-esque bonuses to ecm drones?
---
Drink that large delicious cup of Koolaid. 
---
How upset will you be after you've spent all this money to drop on Karmafleet rorqs and find yourself a frozen corpse after being counter dropped with absolutely zero impact on those miners? 
---
Will you be one of the first back here sooking about unsubbing when local gets turned back on? 
---
Oh the irony will be soooooo delicious.
---
&gt;getting evicted from region(s) 
---
You guys managed 1 out of 4 regions before you gave up and ran home haha.
---
Yeah. And this isn't a game where players are known for going overboard and being excessive about things. Is it?
---
Itss a bit early to make any decision
---
Hopefully. If that does not happen, the game will die because hunters and krabs will leave.
---
I wish all you self congratulatory bastards on here would meet in a roller skating rink with knives and stab each other to death
---
 Time to bring out the Maulus NI with insta lock faction scramblers then.
---
Yea could do (your drone suggestion). I loved it because people see it on scan, laugh to themselves and then die. It has huge tank, dual web/void potential and near Comet dps. 
---
When I lived in BR I got a shiton of kills - https://zkillboard.com/kill/75049932/ as an example. Sorry for shamelessly posting one of my own kills ))
---
I guess we will see
---
Less characters in space is bad because you can't kill them. I personally believe this will result in less krabs in space to hunt, then the hunters who don't want pvp at all will quit, then only the actual pvpers will remain. Those guys can get pvp anyway. They did not need this local change.
---
Nah its cool I get ya there. There's a lot to people underestimating ships though. I used to go roam in AFs all the time cause solo dictors would engage and die everytime and faction frigs would often engage and usually die if you took the right fights, but now they aren't fun to solo roam in cause people know when to engage. There's a lot to be said for off meta ships that are good if you choose your fights.
---
Why don't you do the world a favour and go kill yourself IRL?
---
Yeah, sure. Why not.
---
You can tell. It just takes time to gather the information. There's certain things that humans do that bots don't and vice versa
---
Hey does anyone have some sort of skill plan for a completely free to play healing type player?
---
Yep but it's a lot less effort.
---
They will change their behaviour to avoid that happening to them. Nobody wants to be someone else's killmail just because the game is too safe.
---
\~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~ \~
---
Because it's a short sighted lazy move, with no goal in sight and only serves to push people into bigger and bigger blobs. CCP is trying to suck reddit's dick and its annoying.
---
Pretty sure that it's a bastardization of the word "carebear."
---
5/7
---
I think you're looking at that backwards. If you've got a bunch of people unsubbing, that means less to have to fight and the easier it will be to harass you and take your Sov. Sounds like a win win to me. I can't wait to see those ADMs once the nullbears stop ratting and mining.
---
So it is correct then? We saw the writing on the wall; if Test plus CO2 couldn't defend against panfam, Test obviously wouldn't be able to defend on their own. 
---
We simply left before we inevitably got invaded, we were still basically pushed out by them.
---
I want you to sit back and follow some logic.
---
My company spent 400 million dollars on another company that has only one product that generates any revenue. I urge them to take big risks on that one project while at the same time have another game (on mobile) that's IP is same as that project being developed. I don't think there's CEO alive that's got balls that big.

you tbh

it now takes 500 to get 1 month, and old aurum is new plex. you buy everything with plex only
---
I had almost a year in PLEX saved up for coming back and now its not enough to buy a month... did CCP just steal my lunch?
---
judging by how long it takes ccp to apparently ban bots, odds are local will be back before anyone gets banned for automating dscan.
---
That's why CCP should limit spawn of combat anoms.
---
Dont worry I love mining salt from NSS or people who cant fight well
---
gian bal is a lying cuck

You said they did deploy them all around, I provided stats of where they were.

I meant to put an if in there so I will amend the post, thanks.
---
why fly a 15k ehp hulk when you can get a nigh-unkillable rorqual that gets better yield with augmented drones for less than 2bn?
---
You'd think, but I really doubt that Pearl Abyss was investing in CCP for that sweet, sweet... marginal cut of a game that already (presumably) isn't pulling in a huge profit. I think the mobile game being the main thing they invested for is a fair assumption. It's just strange to completely ignore the fact that changes this large dropped a few months after an organizational change like that.
---
Hmm I guess so. Even with Miner 2s or Augmented Miners its still worth it.
---
Didn't Mittens bring his wife to fanfest?
---
Yea, the meta became stale pretty quick and finding random ships to destroy hopes and dreams with became incredibly fun!
---
Idk why but I laughed
---
Add an iHub upgrade that improves local, but prevents the use of cynojammers, or anomaly upgrades.
---
You can have security, or you can have uber-anoms.
---
Upvote this just because PLEX price too high nowadays.
---
or X amount of bandwidth available in each region and each local reduced bandwidth available. so you coudn't have local in every system.
---
That's a piss poor attempt at having a sense of humor :)
---
you search a region and copy the region/numbers/ part and then paste that into your losses killboard url
---
mashing two searches together like that doesnt always work but it does for most things
---
&gt; Inexperienced players trying to climb the ladder in a way that never works.
---
Are they actually trying to climb the ladder, or are they just trying to carve out a stable little niche for themselves?
---
Go to your zkill and click on 'Stats'. Then look at Capsule.
---
That’s the goal.
---
What! A :p just screams sense of humour
---
All plex was converted. 1 'old' plex is now 500 'new' plex.
---
Ah k... shit where is my PLEX stack then? Love this stupid game.
---
That was how I fit my Nagas while they were being rolled out on the test server.  Was good fun.  TiDi cats are fun, but blasters with better optimals and falloff were beast.
---
Haha oh. I’m browsing on mobile so probably couldn’t see that, cheers.
---
Legend, thanks bud!
---
if you want to set up simple searches you can use the tool at http://mossworks.xyz/zkillsearch/
---
then you can use the custom URLs you get from that to start to understand how those searches are made and create your own
---
what are they going to do, stop crabbing?
---
no game time to take a real holiday and waiting Wow classic
---
Weeb and a brony? Dead to me sdeeel. Also haul my shit already
---
You get over it after a while.
---
&gt;CCP of today is at least better at continuing support for the new stuff.

What on earth are you basing this on lol?

With no survivors!

why is skill urself there ;/ let us rest in peace

---
its an old thing... its plex
---
I think they're getting desperate in wanting to reinvigorate the game.
---
What ship are you flying? What fit? What level of site and flavor of filament?
---
It bothers me because it makes my casual pvp a lot more effort than its worth and it is forcing me to live in a shittier wormhole when I could have chosen to live in a wormhole in the first place. Pve was already shite enough anyway I havent krabbed in almost a year anyhow. But dicking about and roaming came just that much more of a ballache to do. Havent unsubbed but not sure how much attention ccp could retain from me if these changes go permanent
---
Or it only registers people who are on the access list. So you can see your mates but not your enemies? Would be distinct from wh space that way. 
---
Comms towers could then sense fleet size presented without any more details
---
step 1 - hear game is total shit
---
step 2 - resub all accounts and buy plex
---
step 3 - consider yourself hero of the community and fighter of ccp
---
What I don’t get why nerf to the vni, surely with the local nerf, afk won’t really be a thing? To the extent it is now vni nerf without local makes sense?
---
So you're advocating botting and ISboxing?
---
U can sub for me!!!!!
---
Why the shit would smaller groups move in when the odds get stacked so much in favour of hunters? They would just keep merging into the same couple of megablocs and youll just have completely empty space with no content and a couple incredibly densley packed hyper monitored null regions with umbrellas waiting to drop on everything that moves.
---
Ironic. He could save others from stupid ridiculously over-exaggerated generalising rant posts, but not himself.
---
I just wonder that all this "re-subing" real macho ultra pvp-ers understand that nobody will undock a shit except vni and/or covetor with no local,we would go to wh if we would want to play with no local - excavators = useless etc etc i dont want to talk about 6h online pressing d-scan theme or that wh will become safer than 0.0....And about sutonia endless solo roamer talking abot corps,man cmon...
---
We'll see
---
i came here to afk in havens and thats what i want to do damnit
---
Maybe they are hunters not crabs..
---
We used to need to update our clones.  CCP got rid of that for a reason.  It was a shit mechanic.
---
Wait what's happening here?
---
Gankers then getting nuked by the rats too lmao
---
Irony indeed that rants fuel rants about wanting less ranting.
---
So the hunters, the people who are hunting and not krabbing would roam the space of the other non krabs and find nothing to shoot still. Until they venture into delve or something then they get helicopter dicked by the cap umbrella go back to shitfuck nowhere start travelling back through deadspace get to delve get nuked ad infinitum. Stellar gameplay
---
I just state my opinion. Up to you what you want to do with it. If you want to be a salty little bitch about it, I can't stop you.
---
&gt; nerf to the vni 
---
But it is huge buff.

---
Those "people" sit in their holes all day doing lord knows what to each other.
---
&gt;what is cool about the nullsec shrinking to three groups
---
It was already three groups. NC., Horde, and PL were already a coalition. This is just a re-organisation for them.
---
As a member of Test, yes it really is cool to see Panfam finally getting their shit together and keeping up with the times. This would be a boring game without them.
---
well excuse me Nostradamus, i did not know you can see into the future:P.
---
Joking aside the game is fluid between payers, you should not make such long term assumptions
---
Psst, Caldari use hybrids too. 
---
Blaster Griffin Navy was great fun.
---
The bandwidth is limited, not eliminated. What happens is that because the fluid router network is not capable of handling the load placed upon it, in conjunction with the shortages of QE He-4, the SCC has been forced to prioritise communications across its network. Thus, QE He-4 which would previously be consumed maintaining regular updates of the number of capsuleers connected to each system's in-system communications grid will be put instead towards message handling. 
---
The practical upshot of this is that capsuleers no longer have access to up-to-date lists of everyone connected to the in-system communications network. When their ships' computers receive a transmission on this network they can log the sender of the message and continue to populate that entry in an internal list for a period of time on the assumption that they're likely still there, but can no longer pull regular updates from the communications grid.
---
However, it's likely that the flow of critical neural scan data will be given top priority for communications since it is vital to keeping capsuleers alive. And, for the time being, we are very useful to the empires and so are worth keeping around.
---
The charted wormhole systems likely have fluid router networks already established since we can use local and resurrect if we die in them. It's reasonable to assume that the instability of the local space-time in Anoikis means that there's always a wormhole connection open to k-space and so there's always a way for data to get from a given wormhole system to K-space. After all, there's almost always a wormhole connection in every system.
---
The reason why local works as it does in wormholes is because, as you might expect, the logistics of moving large amounts of QE He-4 into Fluid Router stations in Anoikis is sketchy at best. The space is dangerous, with roaming drifters, and connections are not always guaranteed. It's likely that thousands of baseliners die every day in supply ships too small to be noticed by capsuleers just to keep these remote stations functioning. So Fluid Routers in Anoikis already throttle capsuleer communications and system comms grid updates to preserve their supplies of QE He-4 and stretch them between infrequent resupply.
---
Happy cake dayyy!
---
btw, these types of generalizations are made about every alliance. people like to make polarizing statements about other groups - and this isn't a bad thing. 
---
in fact part of the reason why eve is so stagnant is there's no real hate anymore. all the alliance leadership are kind of chummy, we hang out in the same discords, there's little feints back and forth sometimes but no one is willing to just put it all on the line to burn someone down because they want to see them gone anymore.
---
so keep your "not all goons" morale posting to the goon forums and let us find reasons to hate each other. there's plenty of good discussion posts happening on reddit, the eve-o forums, and elsewhere.
---
Alright fine, I'm too lazy to find the ping saying with word "rorqual proliferation, active defence fleets, delve"
---
That's some damn fine salt. I'll take active players over some no life loser and their 40 rorquals.
---
It's pretty funny all the whining 'herrrr if I wanted whs I'd live in wh' like having no local is the only difference. I'd go back to wormholes if I only didn't have real life commitments and aspirations.
---
Its gonna be hella fun for roaming :D
---
I suggest everyone get ready for some great fun!
---
Speed is what I value the most when I'm doing relic sites, like you said refitting will hurt the efficiency drastically. Besides the frig will then be susceptible to bubbles. Sadly I don't see a viable solution here. Another labor-intensive way to combat this is to explore with 2 characters-1 scan fit and 1 combat fit...
---
I dont even know who you are
---
I've not unsubbed, but I'm not as optimistic as most here seem to be. As to your question, I think there are a few reasons. 
---
First and foremost is the fact that some people like to make ISK to sub their accounts. That's already not easy without 378384 alts doing PI and skill farming (due to Plex price inflation), so if you mainly mine or rat to pay your sub, it's going to get a lot harder to do so effectively. I've seen people say it's going to force them to pay to sub, which they don't want to do. Especially cause if you rat in anything that isn't a VNI, it may take a while to replace when you end up padding a certain gentleman's killboard. By that I mean this guy: https://zkillboard.com/character/3019582/ Making enough isk to Plex should always be a viable option. Drifters make it less so. No local + drifters make it even worse.
---
Which brings me to my second reason - the fact drifters now can randomly appear and fuck you up if you don't have a super, AND CANT EVEN BE DSCANNED. This is kinda broken imo. If I wanted to be killed quickly with no way of even denting the enemy fleet, I'd challenge the nearest concord officer to a duel, and equip nothing but a civilian railgun and a cargo hold full of prayers. But that's not even the same, cause concord don't randomly decide to dish out death for no apparent reason. 
---
I also had a guy in corp say he has physical limitations that make it harder for him to PVP effectively, so he didn't enjoy it and wasn't looking forward to no local. He didn't specify what the issue was, (and it obviously won't apply to the vast majority of players), but it's something I hadn't even considered, so I'll mention it here.
---
But yeah I think there are valid reasons to dislike/ be concerned about the changes, even if the sub is currently circlejerking the event (while having no idea how long it'll last, or how it'll be implemented).
---
It's possible they are in a plex vault. You can see it by opening your inventory, and see it on the left hand side. If you had 12 old plex, you should have 6000 new plex. You can also try searching your assets for plex.
---
That's not even the pot calling the kettle black, that's the pot looking in the mirror and lacking the self-awareness to do anything but criticise the charring.
---
You don't even know the half of it, dude...
---
"Edit"
---
It would make some sense if the mobile game was what pearl abyss was interested in but that itself doesn't really hold up. Arena of Valor was the top grossing game for 2018 on mobile (based on the first site I found with any data at , don't take this more than an example) at 140 million. Eve Online sure as heck ain't a game that would be called blockbuster IP, so unless they believe that Eve Echos will hold up for like 5 years after launch their almost guaranteed to be in the hole.
---
Looks like you got one
---
of course it's a goon.
---
Hmm, I'd go with at least 2 field purgers, you don't typically see a lot of EM damage during the hard waves.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77215379/
---
Lost this after going afk and drifting off tether. But it was doing gamma t4s for me just fine. I've never done exotics so I am not sure about your fit, but in a gamma that fit is plenty for the drifter battleship as long as you keep your transversal up, primary the webs and then the neuts. You don't need to worry about getting super close, but i'd stay within 50km if you can, the farther away you are the less effective transversal velocity is. Also, make sure you do not go close to the signature radius debuff clouds while the drifter battleship is alive, that is instant death. 
---
For the neuting leshaks, keep transversal, primary webs, heat everything, avoid sig clouds, and you should be fine.
---
What are you on about?
---
I would argue that a person's conscienceness take WAY more data than some texts and location data.
---
&gt;  0.0 needs a balance in the form of higher yields 
---
You want to put even MORE wealth into null? Youre insane.
---
This is just the first step in many to come for PanFam. and they are neccessary.
---
But i don't see PanFam being nearly 100k chars strong as DeadImpLegacyCo.
---
Dear krab, 
---
You will be very missed
---
-nobody
---
Your build is very similar, maybe I should try gammas...
---
Just saw a vid of a guy doing t5 in an active fit with so much cap and shield recharge he did not take much dmg and did not even care about neuts! Must be expensive though...
---
Still Eve, but i have a solution for the players who are looking, it's called either Eve Highsec, or Eve Lowsec...
---
oh i ve resubbed my third account and bought a galaxy pack for it #imdoingmypart
---
more risk without local, more reward. But I would want more wealth into every sector except highsec tbh.
---
whos that
---
And then ccp updates sleeper ai with drifter algorithms.
---
That was pretty cool.
---
What other changes?
---
these threads have some tips:

Already did. Bought 2 Star Packs. Used the PLEX to sub the other 2. Sold the MPTC's for funding. 1 PvP main, 1 scanning/foreman &amp; 2 indies is the setup I've always rolled with. Not too much micro.
---
&gt; The initial panic of Invasion has caused large portions of nullsec to band together and form impromptu NIP's. Without the ability to seriously shoot at null until we find out what's going on and normal warfare resumes, 
---
What makes you think this is how the game should be played? What is "normal warfare" to you? Massive cesspool alliances talking nicely to each other in order to have arranged fights, where neither side chances to lose something? Or the massive zerg of one coalition vs an alliance (which ultimately just said "fuck it, we're pulling out till you get bored")?
---
CCP can be blamed for the current state of the game, sure, but some of the blame should be aimed at the players as well. I suppose it's just human instinct to want to seek safety in numbers, but it has completely sucked the fun out of the nullsec game. Yes, even the old "waiting on a gate for 2 hours till the other side blinks" was preferable to this.
---
I was under the impression that Darwinism was an Ashmarir gate camping alliance
---
calm down, we cant have miners that interact with each other. What do you think this is, a fucking MMO or something, where players are meant to cooperate?
---
What a bullshit post!
---
You probably should go outside sometime. Go for a run. I guarantee you'll be less antagonistic on a mmo video game forum.
---
Thanks bud, I think it’s you I’ve seen using the zKill Fu at times )
---
Yeah but its not the reddit mobs niche so its not real pvp. Real pvp'rs only gank ratters. Not like those f1 monkeys who fight other players.
---
No matter what you do, you lose efficiency. 
---
And no matter how many alts you have, you will always risk dying to someone more prepared, or with more alts. There will be solo campers, but also plenty of campers in a hotdrop nemesis.
---
And really, bubbles aren't a problem if you have a covert ops cloak.  You can get out of them pretty easily with cloak + mwd.
---
Also, even with a t2 relic analzyer, with a ceptor you'll still fail the harder hacks every so often, and scanning will take forever. If you go the refit route, you can still use a sister's probe launcher, since that will never be at risk.
---
The main point is, every time you run a site without local, you are just praying that there isn't a cloaked bomber with a few alts/friends waiting. You do not want to have anything fitted to your ship or in your cargo that you don't mind losing, because especially after this, camping relic sites is going to be extremely popular. So, even if you keep using an interceptor, use a mobile depot to store the loot you've been accumulating before you go to run a site.
---
First, I love this blackout as a short-term "fun" test. Long term, I think we can all agree that delayed local is the best permanent solution.
---
Problem is, you replied in a serious way, to an obvious shitpost/troll. Don't ruin good theater!
---
Mittani would never speak this way. well done OP!
---
Ugh and I voted for you... :-P
---
&gt;The initial panic of Invasion has caused large portions of nullsec to band together and form impromptu NIP's
---
Idk what this is even supposed to mean 95% of null is already NIP'd with one side or the other
---
you can do pretty "deep" searches, ie.

---
maybe the new pvp is symmetrical at the sun
---
Eve. duh.
---
AF and HAC reworks with the ADC were really good and added character to the ship classes.
---
Im hoping we can get something for combat inties
---
t5s are way to blingy for my taste, that fit was my first one that had been successful, so I don't want to bother trying out anything more expensive until I get some more experience. And after it died I just stopped doing abyssals and switched to explo. 
---
With the death of local it looks like I'm going to be switching back, though. I wonder if that was partially why they added abyssal deadspace, to give krabs somewhere to go after they removed local
---
Savage! Poor bots 🤕
---
Yeah they operate in that area near HED-GP gate but they also come into QFC zone for fights every now and then. At least, this is what they did 1-2 years back
---
I think yields have no business being increased until supercap umbrellas are addressed. Without that the change in local is only going to drive more people into capitals under an umbrella, risk hasn't increased for them at all.
---
Besides that rebalancing supers is the only change that would affect big groups more than little ones. You can fight subcaps outnumbered if you're smart about it but you can't do shit if the other guy brings more capitals than you. And on top of that they're by far the easiest PVP ships to fly. These big nullblocs are able to consolidate power more than ever before because quantity is all that really matters in this meta. 
---
Think of a big alliance bringing 200 guys in Nightmares to bash your small group's citadel. You can put 20 of your guys in bombers and maybe take out half their fleet in a couple runs if you're good. Or kite them and pick them off, or boosh them and pick them apart that way. With 1/10th the numbers. Even if you eventually lose it was still a fight the whole way. There's no equivalent to that in capital PVP and that's a serious problem.
---
The Nyx was already on grid with the Rorqs. It did not jump in and was not aligned at all on arrival.
---
gf!
---
It makes complete sense to tie local to a structure of some kind where only the owning alliance and acl get the benefit. Balance it how you will, but that would be the way forward.
---
That’s some Mittens level spin here
---
Do you seriously think that this is the same conditions?    Hot drop o'cloak, that is the difference and it often involves massed supers and titans.   I must be missing something because I sure have not seen them in WH space?
---
Dude, that is fucking awesome! Thanks bud.
---
Abyssal is not passive enough for nullkrabs
---
Etherium Reach... as far away from Delve as possible.
---
Resubbed 2 spy accounts and 2 cloaky hunters )
---
Or only people on the access list see the local
---
I don't know about goons, but i have only once seen init drop caps/supers on QFC and that was a roaming gang who came to our pocket.      
---
We are not part of QFC but it seemed they thought we were, so there was some commotion.      
---
But i have never seen so much as subcaps going after QFC in their space, people let alone supers.
---
&gt; in fact part of the reason why eve is so stagnant is there's no real hate anymore. all the alliance leadership are kind of chummy, we hang out in the same discords[...]
---
Be the change you want to see
---
First i thought this could be an interesting post, but then i started reading and - NO.
---
Yep, I have the fear that a good chunkbnof the recently sold recons will end up as a travel or ratting ship, just like many ceptors
---
Also, I added in those faction shield boosters from something i looted. You want to use caldari, not minmatar, because minmatar ones are just as good but twice as expensive
---
And buff lowsec for smaller groups, disallow cynos there, too. Another theatre and room to grow to contest the bigger ones or harass some of their logistic chains.
---
&gt; You had years to get something done
---
They made the largest bloc period in nullsec by a country mile. Forced their old time enemies to completely abandon two wars back to back. Made another enemy surrender paying a kings ransom (40 faction forts). What exactly are they missing for the Eve Online achievements list?
---
I think this is good for CCP though. You probably pay for those 8 ratting accounts with in-game ISK, not RL cash. Without ratting creating massive ISK revenue, people will suddenly have to pay RL $ for the game. Which gives CCP RL $ to operate. 
---
Think about it... if every server interaction costs $, and thousands of accounts cost CCP $ without any revenue to off-set those costs, what is a smarter dev. move then removing those unprofitable accounts from the server?
---
How about null will become richer because bots will lessen their inflating influence on all stuff found there?
---
Main reason I like the AF changes is I don't think they invalidated the t3ds. Confessor is still a better sniper than retri, jackdaw is still a better sniper and more DPS than a hawk, and the hecate gets like 2x the dps of an enyo. Svipul is the only one that doesn't have a place atm and tbh fuck the svipul, it deserves it.
---
Alliance A, Alliance B, Alliance C, all your idea does is create more cancer
---
yes, your attrition. in a few month you will be crying tha null sec is too empty and not worthy to roam
---
Yeah, make eve have even more maintenance tasks to do...
---
Also: do you want to be bosoned on a gate? Because that's how you get bosoned at a gate
---
O_O
---
Id preferit if you could hack then to disruot local for a few minutes
---
You can try it for free, what do you have to loose? Also if you use this [link](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=e2b17e66-9aeb-492d-88cc-82f4c78cc651) to sign up I might get free shit :)
---
You seem to be unaware that null sec is supposed to be dangerous.  And if you want casual PVP, you might be best suited for Faction Warfare.
---
Took one tick of the boson as we warped off took over half my shield off, proper Squeaky bum time to see I warped before the next tick. The fleet was hilarious and GF to all.
---
Im fully aware its supposed to be dangerous but having to premptively stick scout alts several systems in every direction all dscanning like mad to chase down a frigate fleet running away from my small gangs would be cancer. The current state of null allows me to be able to pvp in small fleets with relative ease. The focus on being actual fights and content rather than push V simulator
---
you sound like highsec is a better fit for you.
---
Fuck off.
---
You must be american, to believe that excluding someone will make your miserable life better ;) All that mexicans behind the wall will ensure your life will be better, so you dont have to do that 4th daily shift at Walmart for minimum wage !
---
&gt;I'm not fond of low, mostly due to it being choke full of risk averse pvpers and lackluster pve content.
---
A subjective statement, as I happen to think null is lackluster and full of risk-averse PVPers. Though you point as a whole is entirely valid. 
---
Have my upvote.
---
&gt;  Let others take pockets of space who want to PVE
---
Not sure there will be many who will want to PVE there, this will change the risk vs reward too much.
---
Local will be gone for like 2 weeks and everything will go back to as before after that.
---
You will not be missed.
---
&gt; manageable
---
= defense fleet you can outnumber or outgun. If its a thread you run. (which is not different from the krabs docking when they see you)
---
Eve Online, because I'm in FW and I don't bitch out when new gameplay mechanics are added that I don't like.
---
What a well-thought reply!
---
So being a "solo" pvp guy, in a game that is advertising and relaying on nullsec pvp and big fights seems to be the new vegan. You have to talk about all the time that you are solo pvp, btw. Or Wormholer. You have to judge everyone else who is NOT vegan/solo pvp, everyone outside of your Ideology is a cruel monster and destroying the world. 
---
etc.
---
That's why nobody loves vegans, and thats why you will realize soon that nobody cares for the remaining 100 "solo" pvp guys, trashing their heads with t1 tristans in a lowsec plex. It's the bad bad Nullsec Block that counts. CCP wont generate new players with the Headline "Suitonia fought an awesome battle, sitting in a kestrel with around 4 other players in the same system".
---
Etc. just enjoy your feeling of having the high ground vs all that ebil and unskilled Nullsec Blocks. It wont hold long ;)
---
Those holes and sigs come up now yet you still see inner hell or Volta with content and that's when you have perfect knowledge of what's in system.
---
enjoy your holiday falcon! :)
---
i hope you are drinking cocktails under a palm tree  (✿◕‿◕✿)(✿◕‿◕✿)(✿◕‿◕✿)

The biggest change will be against bots, for me. I can't even tell you how demoralizing it's been to me to find nothing but bots in the East and have no way (besides guessing timers) to counter it without a significant investment, like dedicated cloaky toon for that system.
---
that is something that could happen now, but it seems it doesnt.
---
&gt;Get over your narrative, 
---
You first.
---
Jamgu just feels so shit to play, ecm strength is anemic and range is bad as well :/
---
No, he'll be whining that rorquals are too strong and should be nerfed. And that they shouldnt be able to get so much ore from t2 mining drones.
---
And probably complaining about supercap ratting under supercap umbrellas.
---
Combat inties should get the point cap reduction bonus replaced with something like a prop mod cap reduction bonus
---
I definitely won't be bringing in new people until CCP launches this and I'm sure I'm going to invest in the game again. Don't want to get people stuck in limbo for no reason, ya know?
---
Fights will be about incomplete knowledge. You will have more surprise fights and more things will die. We will see.
---
Regrettably, Im pretty sure that bot programmers are already writing a gate-orbiting, dscan-using bot program thats designed to signal when it's time to dock up.
---
Alternatively, Myrmidons will just accept losses and keep grinding those hubs.
---
100%, I came over from Guild Wars 2 ( 7 years on Gw2 ), and I have been playing about 70 days on Eve now. The Game is so big if you are a MMO RPG Vet you will very much like it.

I was thinking more along the lines of them allowing mwds to work even while scrammed. That way they fill the role of intercepting a target in a combat situation
---
Yeah but you fly 500m pirate drugs so can I see what fit you were using?

Jesus fuck no that's op as fuck

Why though? Still squishy and vulnerable to bubbles. Very specialized role as is the case with t2 ships.

For the record there have been posts about eve dieing since 2003 or before..  As you can see take them with a grain of salt
---
EVE is better to waste your life on than wow, bdo, or any other mmo
---
The endgame is not scripted pve, its unpredictable pvp with brains and patience being rewarded as well as clutch tactics
---
Yes, the game is great for starting right now
---
Especially with all the cool stuff availible for isk making in hisec, abyssals and invasions.
---
Do it!
---
It seems a bit off but I think it is to be seen in light of the official forums where a lot of players are announcing to unsubscribe their gazillions of accounts.
---
So you're saying it was way less than 4k because of alts?
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75049954/
---
Obviously sometimes you have to drop the second web for a scram. I often pimp the shit out of my fancy ships, but always fit regular ships t2 (except the occasional CalNavy scram to catch ventures/stabbed vexors).
---
Greatest reward (rorq fleets) should come with the greatest risk.
---
I would guess a boosting rorqual is desirable, but barges with their huge range make the better fleet over multiple rorquals.     
---
Hulks with mining drones do slightly more yield than rorqs with augmented drones and without drones more than rorqs with T2 mining drones.       
---
But Hulks are, of course, a lot more work for that small increase.

---
It says upgrades on the site so no buying plex with ISK shouldn't work.
---
You forget that the 500 plex i buy from isk has been bought by someone else for rl Cash.
---
Unless something changed recently I didn't see the only 2 pirate epic arcs are Guristas and Angel.
---
roaming guarantees citizenship
---
Well spotted!
---
S'cuse me two secs, need to put more plex in the meter... lol
---
Then why do wormholes get shafted on that scale?
---
Nvm put had them in an alts assets for some reason. Off to the vault they go!
---
Just be patient and do the tutorial missions, its a bit boring but it beats not knowing how the game works.
---
After that do a few missions, and try to get into abyssals. Good practice and good isk.
---
From there you will have some skills and isk to see what the next step is. I highly recommend looking for a player corp.
---
I'm sure they'll attempt to adapt, but realistically if they stay safed until they see someone leave via the same gate they came in, they'll never make ISK. Unless it's a dead-end system, it shouldn't be that hard to either shut them down entirely or wait and kill them. I would hope this would also create a situation where botters are easier to identify for CCP.
---
~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~
---
This was planned long before any change to local chat was announced.
---
Thank you thats a good answer. I knew this margin is high but it feels like working with 2-10% margin is not worth the effort when you are a beginner in Industry, thats like 100k per ship or something. :-/
---
unless you have this 24/7 you won't know if someone is'nt already there, either cloaked or in a recon. there are many systems with 60 to 100+ au diameter, happy scanning before doing anything else - and cloaked ships still will not appear
---
This change is a bold move - just like allowing headshots through walls in cs
---
This is whats funny about goons. Coming from an ex-goon (I left a week ago). You play eve for the thousand man fights and coalition conflicts. What I realized during that last "war" was. There will be no war against goons again in the current meta. Nobody is going to take on 1000 titans, yet goons still tried to insult NC for not docking. Are you fucking serious? Are you that delusional? Has delve got you so loony that you dont see the big picture?   
---
THe direction in the previous meta was obvious, blueing nearly half of new eden or more because NOBODY in eve will give you a real fight, that ultimately results in a farming simulator mining for isk to buy ships you'll never use. 
---
Goons never broke the rules, they never cheated, they played the game the way it was designed to the T and with maximum efficiency. It's understandable that the mass majority of them are so comfortable they can't bear any change. But, it needs to happen. The neighborhood must be shaken.
---
Guys , Pvp and Pve depends on one  another unless you want to pvp in cheap crab all the time, most of us have to pve to pay for pvp , so it just need to be balanced out , the one can’t exist without the other.
---
Same old bs old story old dynamic that no matter what you do , you mess with one, the other will suffer as well.
---
So get over yourselves already and try to find a way to balance the two. 
---
People got to be able to pay for a fully pvp dread , a fully pvp thanny a fully pvp super , rifter pvp is fun don’t get me wrong , I do like to pvp ones in a while in something more substantial and let’s face it pvp pay out in isk is almost non existence to the masses.
---
Whoop to do I looted a invul 2 , not going to pay for my 509 mil Loki I just gladly took to pvp with knowing it’s going to get pop eventually.
---
You mess with grand scale alliance pve isk generator that in turn will mess with our grand scale cap , dreads , super , titan pvp , not to mention all the keepstars forts ,moon miners ,engineers.
---
I get tired of people thinking krabbing is such a 2 nd class thing to do and pvp is god send , 
---
PVP cannot exist without PVE !
---
Get it trough your thick skulls already , you know the people who I’m referring to.
---
My brain is cooked from a full day of playing/organising 40k games.
---
Is this a legit ping or am I getting wooooshed?
---
Somethings are too strange to not upvote.
---
That's what I thought, but it worth the try 😂
---
How about to place links on original content what you have been used in your video?
---
Before it was announced, yes. But CCP has been planning all of this for a while
---
Eve, because momma didnt raise no bitch
---
you cant quantify 'Greatest' to compare it to 'greatest'

Goons aren't allowed to drop supers on QFC. If they do report it and it will get handled.
---
From goons? LOL
---
Yeah I was sort of thinking that the local change (if made permanent) would just lead to null sec pve'ers seeking more safety, which likely will mean joining one of the big blocs with a massive umbrella. I do think there's a chance the local changes lead to there a really being less content in the long run as small groups are torn to pieces and coalesce into the big blocs
---
They will move into abyssals, though. That’s definitely where I’m going.
---
Bless
---
Pvp where you always win. Meaning hunting krabs. That is not pvp, that is ganking. The krabs in ships you can kill with a smallish gang will ship up into supercarriers that need far more people to kill, and they'll hide under tighter umbrellas than ever before. Deleting local won't bring about this small gang pvp paradise, or even an increase in ganking. It will leave space empty of anything easily killable, no matter how easy it is to catch.
---
last kill nov 10th 2018 https://zkillboard.com/character/1580075176/
---
everyone needs a poster child tho ;)
---
&gt;  If its a thread you run
---
Its true I'm not into sewing.
---
FC, what is the edit button?
---
This whole renting regions is bullshit and CCP needs to stop this joke. It's simply not right
---
It's almost like if people can have an opinion indepenpent of the group they belong to...
---
The reason he doesn't want this change is that it kills his income. Mining Drone IIs aren't worth stealing. Excavator booshing is going to die.
---
\#Krabtalk
---
Fuel the fire, not free intel.
---
well I get no kills either way... so to me... its the same thing.... :(
---
Without drifters, the north would currently be Panfam vs Gotg + goon bat phone. The south would have been the escalating Legacy vs WinterCo war. 
---
Provi is still being invaded, as far as I’m aware, but nothing serious is going to happen now because Test will just show up to stop Provi losing anything big without Panfam showing up, so despite the war nothing is going to change. 
---
The only war actually going on right now is Conifers vs a bunch of goon pets. 
---
Whatever else drifters have done, they have 100% killed a ton of content.
---
Wow, "l in a fleet of less than 20" such fucking wow, here have a cookie 🍪 you brave person you. Go get em tiger.
---
I sense our comms are about to hit some next level shit now :)
---
Welcome to the team JEFF!
---
Uh oh. That could be bad news.
---
Pearl Abyss starting to push for MTX perhaps? Buy more local for only $9.99 for 24h!
---
I didn't like this change at first. I have friends who are thinking they may never come back to the game. But I think I will do the same, and resub all my accounts. This has shaken up EVE for better or worse and given the game a bit of much needed mystery and uncertainty again.
---
So you might need to pay irl money for local chat. Seems pretty terrible as changes go, hopefully that doesn’t actually happen.
---
What local?
---
Agreed, no local is gonna be fun, but if its permanent its safer and more profitable to just go live in a wh.
---
Observatories for local and people only showing in local after decloaking would be a good step. Especially if observatories can be hacked and disrupted.
---
Preach!
---
Navy grif is fine, plenty mids for control, good dps with blasters, dont fit ecm you chooblords and go have fun.
---
These days you always get SRP. Shitstack SRP for #yolo solo adventures (it is capped at a billion per month or something). So even when not in a fleet, still SRP. Besides that, all the better corps also handout corp SRP. So you can organise corp roams or top off that logi loss. 
---
Despite all the hating on Goons in this sub, they encourage you the most to go out there and shoot shit.
---
Then why are you guys the ones pouring all the salt into /r/eve ?
---
As i read all opinions about the latest nerf, on all threads areound reddit, and what should CCP should do , my conclusion is simple
---
\- nerf everything, close the game, or eventually just buff blops fleets.
---
Nobody EVER will agree only on one opinion, this is the beauty of humanity, we are all different. If you all know so good what CCP should do, just apply for a job as a game designer with them and earn some money in the process. This is not targeting the OP, bust merely a conclusion to all threads about this local nerf, and sorry to post it here.
---
Im not but those that are havnt been on coms or in jabber
---
Svipul has insane volley damage for its size. Might not be terribly useful most of the time, but it has a place
---
I was going to say, I thought that area was totally out of bounds for goon drops.
---
CCP buffed the 0.0 relic sites/data sites IMO. I do regular roams for relic sites, and until 1 week back only bullshit loot was dropping, but since almost 3-4 days now, i roam 2 hours and i fill my astero with 180-185 mil ISK and i'm not doing Sansha sites. Also for data sites now i see a lot of datacores and decryptors, less calm filaments.
---
Do you even believe what you write?
---
It’s literally just a bad hookbill in FW. The only reason it will win is if people assume it’s a trash ship and attack it without checking your fit on zkill
---
The thing is the drifters aren't an incursion  or an event where you earn rewards.  It's an invasion where you need to protect yourself that's the purpose.
---
Npc in game have really been nothing more than  RP content and had very little impact in the game.  Isnt that a bid odd we have all these factions and they actually dont have any real AI.  So it's about time they did. It's great.
---
Goons have contributed like many others I may add to killing eve however CCP have also given you the tools to do it by stupid mechanics.   Of course you'll exploit them.
---
The 1000 man fights dont happen because of the huge amount of capitals behind them that others simply don't have. One might say well that's not goons fault. Nope is not its CCPs fault.
---
Drifters solves many of the problems all this has caused.  CCP have basically created their own powerful alliance to do the players work for them.
---
This shouldn't stop roaming gangs etc like we used to have, that's was great about eve 50-100 man gangs just fighting each other.
---
 Not everything should be about large taking sov battles.
---
Also if you want tot go take another region the  surely there is consequences of moving your entire fleet.  Surely someone will trying burn your house down whilst you're away?
---
So it's like if your going to try take sov and a region think about it.
---
I agree I am not sure no local is the complete answer but it will be interesting. I just worry people might not undock.
---
But again Drifters need their AI adjusting
---
Come back for timers and actually destroy structures otherwise what's the point.
---
Attack ihubs and  tcus otherwise what's the point
---
LoL
---
"We declared war on highsec because we have no content in null because we blued everyone."
---
Like what are u smoking?
---
There is one reason u declared war on highsec:
---
Your narcistic leader wants people in highsec to quit the game so he can threaten ccp to make gamechanges to his likeing.
---
The highsec embargo is just to fill his pockets and prolly to boost the nullsec leaders rmt schemes.
---
You and the rest of goon linemembers are just clowns to not see through this garbage.
---
If i was ccp i would just spawn "buffed" dirfters that can doomsday stations in null without any timer and zero asset safety if nullsec continues to work on destroying the game :D
---
Isn't null famously safer than high sec these days?
---
Gali, you sound like a smart person. So you should know better then making posts like these.
---
This sub (like any other forum) isn't a single hive-mind, so your post is just contributing to the very overreaction and generalization you claim to dislike.
---
Of course all goons don't think alike or prefer a single type of gameplay. Likewise not even all PVEers or miners are against these changes.  The people who are whining and threatening to unsub are those who are unwilling to accept change and adapt to it. Like many others seem to be, I'm excited about what's coming. I know I'll probably die (a lot) but it will be fun.
---
The part where your narrative really breaks down is the part about invading HighSec. That really is because your leadership are crybabies with an overinflated sense of their own importance who deeply believe that CCP owe them something.  Mittens pretty much said that on twitter in his comments to the null local changes (along the lines that he approved of the changes to local, becuse unlike the drifters which weren't discussed with CSM, these were the extent of lots of consultation etc).  CCP make a game which he plays. They don't have to consult him when they make changes.
---
Same. I let all my accounts slip into unsub, when they started the Drifter bullshit. But the second I heard about the local change I resubbed. Let's see for how ling and will they make that permanent.
---
PS: why plex. Time on multiple accounts is always cheaper with direct subscription.
---
you could also check out his corp history and see that he was in npc corp before rejoining snigg, which kinda implies he wasn't playing the game
---
crazy
---
Instead, make anomalies respawn somewhere else in the region. Encouraging players to leave their super umbrella.
---
Then make drones not have auto aggro if you have a warp core stab. No seriously, this.
---
Lastly, change pirate ai to not attack +5 standing. Nothing is more annoying than having +8.0 guristai and being instantly jammed, allowing the target to warp off.
---
Check Rook prices , better :)
---
It's not dying, just as time has gone on, some audiences have had to stop playing and the people who come into the game don't get retained by EVE. Add in there is much higher volumes of games to compete for people's time than there was 8 years ago.
---
Yeah but it isn't a navy ewar frig. Which is the whole fuckin point
---
Resubbed as well !
---
Later that day Bee got blapped in  Vlillirier 
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77640000/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77640000/)

---
ELi5
---
Angron will never pull it off. Abaddon might.
---
Abyssal dead space is looking good this time of year, lol. 
---
Seems like it’s the only way to reliably make isk without local, at least if I don’t want to bother running scanned combat sites (if anyone has a guide on doing that, please link it) or missions.
---
Jeffraider podcast back when?
---
There is being a grownup and react the way you are treated and then there is being a manchild and blindly flinging your arms and words around you. I don't see how you can not respond with "Well thanks for your offer, but we are not interested. (and we are going to continue to burn down the rest of Querious as we want)".
---
The thing is, Eve is a small world. You might run into another again anytime soon under different circumstances. Being an utter cunt might come back to bite you.
---
In that case, please undock your rorqual so i can volley your excavators.
---
Structures, showing up in local after breaking cloak, and being able to hack the structures is what im hoping for
---
I wonder what your angle could possibly be... QFC is somewhere a few Provibloc characters/corps have landed after leaving Provibloc.
---
Under Fcs is totally different from only doing PvP because the leader says so.
---
Fcs are necessary to not get shredded in group fights because of unorganisation.
---
I'd love to go back to hisec, but its resources got basically DUMPSTERED back in 2013, forcing everybody and his dog into nullsec, and it would be silly to assume I will not bring my mindset with me.
---
Then numerous buffs to ganktarding has nailed hisec's coffin. Current hisec is simply no longer playable, and lowsec never was playable.
---
Its origins come from Russian.
---
The true endgame is multiboxing 800 titans and invading Delve solo
---
&gt;When null sec krabs say they are going to unsub yet haven't paid with IRL cash in a while
---
imagine being this dumb
---
Unfunny and bland perhaps you should unsub for the betterment of all.
---
With more or less difficulty, and the sites being more or less obvious.
---
And the Curse loses more than just the launcher dps for the record.
---
Guristas drone damage bonus on worm/gila more than compensates for the use of just 2 drones.
---
In fact in gila's case.
---
5x hammerheads t2 = 158.7 dps on perfect skills, or 31.734 dps / hammerheads t2 unbonused.
---
Curse gets a 50% damage bonus, which makes it 238 dps, or 7.5 drones.
---
Gila otoh, with 2x hammerheads t2 gets 380 dps, which is 11.974 drones (let's assume 12 drones for ease of calculation).
---
So gila gets 12 base drones while curse gets 7.5, a 60% damage bonus on top of the expected 50% damage bonus for being a drone ship.
---
I would say that 60% damage bonus on top of the expected damage bonus for being a drone ship, and the fact that it's a additive bonus and not a multiplicative one (role bonuses tend to be additive), and the bonused launchers makes it a tad more than just ' 10% less tank/dps'.
---
Man...you're a smart cookie, aren't you?
---
Ishtar and Gila will not be used much without local. 
---
Max insured domi/myrm are both cheap enough to pay for themselves quickly, and you could probably find a quiet system to rat in and be isk positive despite feeding a lot. 
---
Domi especially is nice because it can fit a full rack of neuts and a MJD, so it’s hard to tackle compared to a VNI, although with how many hotdrop t3cs and recons are going to be used with local gone, even that will not help much
---
I was there was fun thanks fc
---
Hopefully cynos are next on the change block.  Personally I would make cynos drop lock range to 0 (exemption for covert cynos of course) to stop every Rorqual and Carrier/Super being able to just fit a cyno and rat in safety.  Creates better and more interesting counter play as hunters try and establish system/grid control if they catch something.
---
Imagine not being able to form an actual argument against me so you resort to calling me dumb. Which is odd since you have absolutely no idea who I am. Get good or unsub.
---
We NEED this
---
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
---
If you are unsubbed none of that matters.
---
Wormholers have always been rolling in risk, in what way do they get shafted? Honest question.
---
this dude is probably in like zebra corp or some shit and thinks he's elite cause he's surrounded by actual retards lmao
---
Imagine CCP telling you to shut up and you just screech louder.
---
you put hail in your cynabals?
---
Does this make Waffles the new PL?
---
I disagree, plenty of people don’t check fits, but a lot of LS pvpers use PLH or manually check, while also a lot of the people I killed with it were locals and knew my fit, although you’re right in that most people assume it’s trash - but it’s not. 
---
As far as a bad hookbill.. https://zkillboard.com/kill/74922599/ one of many. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74967097/
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74991700/
---
So yea, I flew the ship a lot and constantly killed other pirate / faction frigs with it against people who knew me and often killed me. It’s an amazing FW ship. As far as it’s role elsewhere in the game, I wouldn’t know.
---
Join as many small fleets in EVE as possible
---
Logged into your alt account I see.
---
absolutely not.
---
Max fun/hr is what you get in Waffles
---
Soooooooo you have to go to HS for content because you immediately formed NIPs with any willing group. 
---
Are you mad with your leadership because of this? I know I would be.
---
Can you reeeeee louder please?
---
Imagine being this dumb.
---
Ah, thats the reason we get always dropped if we tackle a roaq with a 10 man cruiser gang! Because a little WH-Corp can bring 75 Dreads trough a single WH =D
---
NS is a way to safe with all that intel - nice step from ccp to change that temporarely :)
---
I think it's to counter Excavator booshing
---
They'll die very quickly.  Bomber's Bar, for example, would wipe a fleet of those out in around 30 seconds.
---
Can someone give a  two sentence recap of what these changes are?
---
imagine being so fucking salty that you spam post THREE times https://i.imgur.com/u8QQefB.png
---
Yeah... freaks...
---
Someone has too.
---
So you're saying waffles accept anyone into corp regardless of if they can put out or not?
---
So basically horde level open recruitment? real secure fucko
---
yup
---
Do the pros of having an inactive retard outwegh the cons? its like slapping a 'WE HAVE MORE EX FAMOS PL WHO DON'T PLAY THE GAME IN MY CORP LOOK AT ME' especially when its ur ceo that made the post u absoloot cuntman
---
Republic Fleet Medium Shield Extender
---
Right now I can't single that one out in a reasonably shortened search string, when really I should be able to filter on "rep med ext" only. If you have ever used pyfa you would see what we mean.
---
We also own some systems and are not QFC
---
Have no idea who I am yet resort to name calling. Just proving my point. Oh BTW having salt is good. Learn about it. But of course can't expect you to do anything that requires much effort seeing as how your ability to think critically is obviously severely limited. Aweh cute your so interested in me you took a screen shot of my comments. Guess what bud. IDC.
---
[guys i just heard a brand new song i think it's fire though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Ov5jzm3j8)
---
wow kid, you got _REAL_ fucking booty blasted :popcorn:
---
It is as deep as a video game can be. The thing is you set how you want to play. A smart ambitious player can have a very intricate play style and his eve will be an adventure. A simple miner for another example will experience a mostly shallow and linear game experience only interupted from time to time by some asshole who wants another killmark.
---
Imagine living vicariously through CCP because you can't accomplish anything in game.
---
He's literally complaining that he can't make isk while afk ratting. Maybe he needs to, yknow, play the game
---
They usually have like over 40 elements of original content. In case its not obvious - nothing in it is original. Nothing. Its also legal to use it lie this. So unclench, and recognise this is the world we live in now, and have for some time.
---
this isn't eve online
---
The structures would give the advantage current local brings only to their deployer. You would have to sneak up on those structures, but they would know you're there and you wouldn't know that they knew. It's a massive tactical disadvantage, the defenders advantage would be almost insurmountable.
---
It's not a bad hookbill, it's a thicc merlin
---
???????
---
u smrt
---
I re subbed also.
---
Believing everything a someone says on reddit  is a bad habit both in game an in life. 
---
Use your best judgement after you have gathered facts.
---
This being said:
---
*you are the last omen, with your arrival the prophecy is complete and eve will die.*
---
I'm sorry bud, but your the kid. Look how upset you've gotten over somebody you know nothing about. Somebody who doesn't even know you. You've gotten so butt hurt about it you've logged into your alt account to downvote my comments. So upset you've had to screen shot my comments in an attempt to humiliate me. News flash bud I'm not as soft as you.
---
He isnt a nobody only because he didnt play for a bit. Dont make yourself look more stupid than you are.
---
Seddow's singing didn't make the final cut?!?
---
idgi ur from test aswell why are u not backing me??
---
jesus dude, is there some shit going on in your life? like what the fuck
---
"no local" is going to screw small groups.  Basically ratting and mining in a small corp or alliance is playing russian roulette.   If you don't have a response fleet ready to go, you are dead if you are caught.  There is no counter play for small groups.  Big groups, you just fly a rorq (and panic) or fly a super and you'll have time to call the calvery.   Bots?  they are going to run 24/7 so they can eat any losses (assuming they don't adapt and figure out how to get around the no local environment).
---
Imagine being another nullsec care bear who thinks the way he plays the game is the only way to play the game. IMAGINE FORGETTING THAT EVE ONLINE IS A SANDBOX.
---
I dont have to shit on others even when there is nothing to know that Test Alliance is in fact the Best Alliance.
---
I was just about to ask you bud. Your the one making all the personal attacks when you have absolutely no idea who I am.
---
I won’t leave, but I will unsubscribe my 4 rorqual miners and extract skills and add em
---
To my main :) then I can get a titan.
---
Then I will adapt to the new game play with only 2 pilots instead of 10.
---
Cope, the games garbage and kills off play styles while leaving whole spaces to die (lowsec)
---
This game won't die a amazing fast death like everyone yells because it's a mmo but it'll always be dropping players and not retaining alot of new players because off CCPs slow response time on iterating/reiterating and bad decisions.
---
not a nullsec player but:
---
disallowing cynos in lowsec is going to straight-up cripple the ability of some nullsec entities to set-up supply lines
---
Yo, the plex you're implying they bought gave more money to CCP than a normal sub ya fuckin retard. Think in more than one dimension before you jump on the retard juice bandwagon amigo.
---
Nvidia Shadow Play... Never had an issue
---
Just checked the fits I had. KSpace ratting just fit your tank for whatever rats are showing up and the EHP might as well be infinite, but there's about a 10k difference between the two, damage difference of about 300. Aight, so not quite 10%, but considering you won't show on Dscan, much better cap life, and the fact that you're losing the missile damage bonuses and a rig slot, 518 vs 815 DPS for pirate rats doesn't make a *huge* difference.

it's not my fault your thin skin little triggered mctrigger face took shit poersonally

Owning space needs benefits, if local stays gone living in null is pointless. I will go wh instead

I'm sorry but last I checked your the one screeching.

It took them how long to do something like this?

what you are saying is cool if it worked that way, but it doesn't.

the problem in null is cynos.  i can drop an entire fleet of capitals on you in about 5 seconds with no warning whatsoever.  and you won't even know i'm in your system.  
---
If you are flying anything slightly blingy, e.g. rattle, gila, ishtar, carrier, orca, exhumer, etc.  the ganker can get all his ducks in a row, push a button, and you are dead.  there is no counter. 
---
What we are left with is either local standing fleet, e.g. clump up a shit ton or flying ships that can survive for about 5 minutes to cyno in help (supers / rorqs) which also requires a super umbrella (and clumping up).
---
I resubbed last night btw, hopping in corp when I get home from work this morning
---
You sound like someone who need to buy a mining permit. Send me 10m isk and I will send you your permit.
---
&gt;disallowing cynos in lowsec is going to straight-up cripple the ability of some nullsec entities to set-up supply lines
---
yes, and that would create even more challenges and fight for everyone, too imo
---
And how would we move stuff like carriers or dreads around in systems like Olfeim?
---
I'd rather have supers and titans locked to nullsec, as you can't build them anywhere else these days. SOV is required and many lowsec entities don't have any (by definition).
---
When I watched the Scope video about the blackout I got excited. Then the blogpost hit and I got slightly ecstatic. When I woke up the next morning I had a lot of unread whatsapp messages from old friends, an additional toon subbed and [this](https://imgur.com/x0KwmAW).
---
You realize they aren't the ones who bought the PLEX? You don't have to buy Plex with IRL cash. Most people buying PLEX with IRL cash are transferring it for isk. Because they sub their accounts. Similar to how I do it.
---
what exactly do you hope that "no local" will accomplish then?
---
if it is easily circumvented, then what is the point?
---
Yeah make 1b/hr for an hour once per week!

---
Your the one who's triggered bud. Look at all of your reactions to everything I've said. It's why I've reported every single comment you've made for abusive behavior.
---
what is in their way to stop them right now?  why do they need "no local"?
---
If people are unhappy with the state of the game as it is, removing local isn't going to fix the game.  Pretty sure it will just solidify the rorq / super / delve meta.
---
Imagine having absolutely no argument so you resort to using vulgar toxic language. Enjoy reports.
---
Given the nature of nullsec players it's more likely that it's just going to lead to more blueing and routing supply lines through your blues' space.
---
true but it seems someone  did copy some parts of it  for exemple it looks like they use the same turret hardpoint system.
---
Like look for fireside chats they are public.         
---
Mittani is happy from the blackout as goons can utilize hordes of alts and tools they have ... and other don't.
---
You have no idea what I think and to assume you do shows how ignorant you are.  I'm looking forward to the local changes.  It's just sad that you can take pride in the change as if it has anything to do with you.
---
Have you been licking lead paint?
---
yeah ok, there's definitely some shit going on in your life, i'm out, have fun screeching at everyone else
---
lol goon.
---
To be clear, the argument here is that it’s irrelevant if the cash came directly from their pocket to plex or not. What matters is CCP got paid for their omega. In fact, they probably made even more since it’s $20 for 500 plex versus 15 for a sub
---
would you really need to jump caps in every system in Eve? Finally different opportunities by location\^\^?
---
&gt;You have no idea what I think and to assume you do shows how ignorant you are.
---
Imagine calling somebody ignorant for assuming then assuming himself. 
---
&gt;It's just sad that you can take pride in the change as if it has anything to do with you.

I'm just posting to say "hi, homey" to see if that triggers this dude as well.

Pretty much that and we can use the power of the black hand
---
About to write the same, so have an upvote
---
I'm not assuming lol.  I know you're ignorant because you are completely wrong in your assumption.
---
More fun playing with dependable people you like who have your back. 
---
The thing people always miss about big player entities is that a lot of small player entities make up them via squads and sigs, which are almost always fun.
---
Did you check that system?
---
The point is they themselves haven't paid a dime in a while. Regardless if CCP is making money or not most of these krabs aren't actually paying. They are just riding off the waves that CCP PLEX sales create.
---
Yes.            
---
People still don't get it how eve was changed by the extractors/injectors.             
---
Quite often i think that CCP also don't know how to handle situation with the skill trading now.
---
How do you feel about fleets of festival fit pvp gilas roaming around offering surprise, non-consensual drone parties?
---
I think it's a b-r reference?
---
So they abandon PL and let it get in the shit state it's in the waffles takes the PL leadership after waffles left to get away from PL... makes sense
---
If i was you I d keep mining because ore prices are gonna skyrocket. Of course it would mean you need to adapt which you said you have no interest in.
---
Should watch some gameplay of, you'll notice a LOT copy and paste elements
---
TIL taking a break from the game exists
---
maybe but perhaps just a bit more content and from time to time a bigger opportunity to fight over some easy travellers? And not a complete take away of JF logigistics, ccp thought about some years ago... .
---
I guess this makes HABIT the #1 retirement corp for streamers...
---
Please how am I completely wrong? These krabs with 43 alt accounts are paying 15$ a month times 43 doubtful. Keep the krab tears coming.
---
Sah dude.
---
where is your camaraderie??
---
Delete local. Delete asset safety. Delete the standing system. Delete ihubs and sov bonuses.
---

&lt;&lt;This twisted game needs to be reset.&gt;&gt;

Pretty sure your the screeching bud. Please take a second to review all of your comments.

who licks lead paint anyways?

listen, when he actually does something and is useful let me know, cus im TELLING YOU he will be shit
---
[http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Heimatar/Olfeim](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Heimatar/Olfeim) without cyno you would need to caps build there to use em?
---
With a massive drop in Plex demand, the market value of Plex will tank. It'll pile up in Jita because nobody can get rid of it. They won't buy more Plex if still have some to sell.
---
Do you not realize that if they were not buying the plex with isk and subbing their accounts with it, the demand for plex would drop and  people would buy less plex for "IRL cash" therefore less money going to CCP?  Your entire argument is built on ignorance.
---
The video or the fight?
---
#OOF
---
That's gold.
---
Personally it just feels weird to dump that much money in a single video game, even if pragmatically it's better to make dank 2bil tix working IRL (and its much more fun).
---
I just plex with cash but pvp with ingame earned space shekels
---
Bye Felicia.
---
i actualy Reactivated my Secodn acount... but i found alot of "mining" bots in High Sec i Hope in the near future CCp adresses that issue as well...
---
Have you considered having fewer structures?
---
Dangerous space is dangerous, you know.
---
This isn't news. Prior to the "war" the same strategy was employed but the staging was SH1. The "umbrella" was within the range of that system. Now that the north is somewhat abandoned, they're moving further east to make attacking their sov a bit harder and using Gem as buffer space.
---
I think subcap ratters just switch to stuff with more tank (like Test switching to domis in feb) and set up more local fleets to support each other against small gangs. Ratting will be less afk but not more dangerous.
---
You understand what the "null" in "null-security" means, right?
---
*Right?*
---
next nerfs will be about your ore. Orelord
---
TIL that SMA still existed.
---
You clearly didn't even read my mail. Post. Please review it because there is no argument. My post is accurate.

Lemme just

"Can't do it, legacy code."
---
1.  You assumed that I am a "nullsec care bear blah blah blah".  I just stated to you that I am looking forward to the local changes there you are completely wrong.
---
2. Again you assumed that the value to ccp is less if an individual is subbing with plex bought with isk instead of realy money, read the rest of the thread and see how everyone is pointing out that you're completely wrong.

Again you haven't even read my main post. I encourage you to re read it. I get it your tears are in your eyes and blueing your vision. I never said anything other than they haven't paid with IRL cash in a while. Which btw. Is an accurate statement I don't care about the people buying the PLEX as it's irrelevant.
---
The entangled helium is plex. This isn't normal resources, you'd have to put irl money towards keeping local up
---
[Ok] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XASNM1XEQPs)
---
That is a very elitist nature from someone in TEST. Why shouldn't he be allowed to join the corp? Not everything is about a killboard.
---
Well we can buy SP directly from CCP now so it's not that wild of a speculation.
---
Goons the white knights of the little guy of null sec 😭😭😭😭 hit the nail on the head there 👍
---
&gt;CCP nerf captial application? We might have 100 dudes ready to warp on top of a titan ready to be bridged.
---
That would be **so much better** for everyone involved than 3 or 4 super alts. Seriously.
---
No, you'd have to put a resource that's tied to irl money. 
---
Major alliances have the ISK to just buy Plex.
---
Hopefully cynos get changed next
---
hello everyone o/. thank you all for playing eve online. deep down i love every single player in the game. you people are like a family. take care and enjoy the rest of your day &lt;3
---
We recently moved into a WH trying to exploit WH diving and PVP that kinda feels like lowsec a few years ago before CCP fucked the whole game up. Untill now we are having lots of fun and really enjoying it. Also, we have literally zero *strategic* ops or CTAs making it a really relaxed environment where you can max fun/h PVPing The corp is back in top10 on zkb too.
---
the dirty secret is that goons love it when you harass their miners and ratters.  You spend several hours trying to find pvp because Null is dead and soon will be more empty.  You catch a ratter / miner in delve.  Response fleet drops and gets kills.  You are out 3 hours for content.  People that dropped get to watch netflix and let you do all the work for generating content.
---
Another guy from a big null bloc white knighting for the little guy first off if they are even semi competent they will be fine, if not losing a few ships will hopefully get them to wise up, eve is supposed to be hard if it wasn’t what would the point of playing be with no sense of accomplishment
---
Sah dude
---
Fuel costs don't stop nullblobs from spamming structures. Don't forget they have essentially infinite ISK, and logistics are ridiculously easy with cynos and JFs so the 'logistics challenge' isn't really a challenge. A local-providing structure would need to have some other restriction, not just cost.
---
The only way I can see this working is if there's only a very limited supply of the fuel resource, and you can't expand that demand, so it's only possible to run (say) 50 observatories simultaneously. But even then, you'd just end up with one blob monopolising the resource and getting all 50.
---
Instant local is such a huge advantage that it just shouldn't apply anywhere outside CONCORD-managed space.
---
Do you not think the game is/was heading toward/already in stagnancy in terms of huge player wars? Goons basically won with their titan fleet that no one can beat.
---
It doesn't matter if a given player pays CCP directly, or uses PLEX.
---
I think its the combination of a number of things:
---
1. It's a big change, people generally don't like change. 
---
2. It's a final straw type incident, nullsec is in desperate need of fixes and improvements and has been for years but has generally been ignored.  In the grand scheme of things a local change is so far down the list its barely in the same encyclopedia.
---
3. It's not something the majority of nullsec has asked for.  The majority will take it and try to make it work but generally when the vocal minority get a change it usually ends up fucking things up even more (see Rorqual Mining).
---
4. It wasn't exactly well announced, a big change like this should really have come with more and allow for proper input from the player-base.  There have been numerous times CCP has suggested a change and for the player-base to suggest significant improvements that saved it from being a right royal fuckup.
---
5. CCP don't exactly have the greatest track record for following through on changes, at the moment there is a real risk that CCP will simply say "meh it sorta works, we'll leave it alone for the next 10 years"
---
I've lived in null for nearly 13 years so I'm willing to give it a go without local, but I have serious doubts much will change for the better.  That being said it better be part of a wider, imminent, improvement pass on nullsec OR be backed out pretty quick if it starts badly fucking things up.
---
&gt;  Let others take pockets of space who want to PVE but fight at the same time.
---
ahh yes, that deep deep well of pilots we have waiting just to join the game so that they can get their shit kicked in over and over to please the elite gankers?
---
Is there some channel of eve sadomasochism filled with people waiting for a chance to rat / mine with less safety?
---
That actually does sound fun.
---
Streaming fortnite tho
---
The only difference in-between a sell immediately or creating a sell order when you create an order is if someone already has a buy order at the price you are looking to sell. When you sell immediately, you are essentially creating a sell order that gets sold instantly to the corresponding buy order.
---
Same thing happens if you're buying something, it essentially creates a buy order that gets filled instantly. If you put in a lower price than the lowest sell order, it creates a buy order instead.
---
what exactly are the new players going to do if there are no krabs to kill?  and why can't they just do that now?
---
I understand but that's not the point. The point is they haven't. These players haven't spent a real life dime themselves in a while. They exploited the N+1 meta under their umbrella.
---
You asked me to explain how you're completely wrong.  I just did.  Why would I have tears in my eyes?  I've stated repeatedly that I'm looking forward to the changes.  Whether or not someone is paying with "IRL cash" doesn't make the loss of a player any less meaningful.  In short, have fun reeeing since it's obvious there's no point in trying to talk you down from the ledge.
---
So wide choices: Eve, and Eve, maybe Eve. Oh! Dont forget about Eve!

---
Well observatory arrays will be fuelled by PLEX.            
---
Want to have the local in your null system - just spend few more bucks!
---
I've made no argument I've made a point. A valid point. See OP for point. You started off not by trying to prove me wrong but by trying to insult somebody who could care less what you think of them.
---
You got the comeback you was looking for, enjoy it, savour it...locally sources GMO free TAPI comback. Youre whalecum
---
Slight misinterpretation from a lore standpoint -- Helium-4 is one of the most abundance helium isotopes in the universe, and is used in QE communications or secure systems. PLEX uses it like an RFID chip or something else to identify it's authenticity and make it a universal currency, and probably does so over the fluid router network, which uses Helium-4 for everything else as well.  
---
So no PLEX powered observatories lol.
---
rook, griffin navy is dead for solo.
---
That's ok. I don't have a problem with having to put in a little work. Because the same will be true for the other side as well.
---
The problem previously was that the would be victims had to put in no work at all to be safe. That's gone. And that is the improvement.
---
When I say "I want pvp where I win" I don't mean that in absolute terms, I just want a chance. Removing local might give me that chance.
---
4He is used to secure PLEX in the lore, as well as run the fluid router network. It's not PLEX itself.
---
I see where you’re going with this. the umbrella can only protect a certain amount of people in a certain amount of time. That makes the 3 mega empire the most vulnerable. Coms will be a cluster fuck with people screaming for help. Multiply cynos will be light, . Multiple targets getting hit at once will not be able to effectively hide under a umbrella. This will force new strategy and properly implement risk vs rewards null been missing for years. This is what null use to be. Especially with WHers. The speculation that goons are trying to push onto the players base is bogus. Lastly, not saying the little guys are not going to get hit, but I think majority of the content will be in the 3 mega empires space.
---
no u
---
You can give it a spin for free these days, all you're spending is your bandwidth and your time.
---
When no one has money to buy plex, the plex value goes down. It would be amazing to see plex at 350mil again.
---
It would be really nice if there were a way to build these searches on a page, without having to know the URL to build.
---
Make a cringe reee post, get a meme response.  What exactly did you expect.
---
There are a lot of ways to get isk that don't involve being completely afk in null on 10 accounts. Maybe people will adapt, who knows.
---
I for one haven't done ratting or mining in 4 years and still afford to lose expensive lokis in dumb ways.
---
I'm more inclined to look at people who's idea of gameplay is essentially not playing the game in complete safety and watching the numbers tick up untill they can buy a titan and drop it on frig fleets as 2nd class.
---
What the hell are you saying?
---
Teaturtle
---
and here in eve we have the finest salt money can buy :)
---
might be just u, it lagged a bit for me but that was prolly the game (they did record a massive fight at max settings)
---
I'm not renewing my sub, but it's not because of drifter bullshit, but rather because the kind of content I subbed for kind of died down and I can probably plex anyway.
---
Wouldn't you need scouts in these systems even with local
---
lmao darkness
---
That's a pretty standard margin across the industry. People who make a lot of money doing industry either mine it themselves (or through a buyback program in a corp) or are doing large scale long term operations where 100k per ship adds up when you're doing thousands of ships.
---
Also, ships are the wrong item to start with since everybody wants to do ships. You have to do your research to find the items with the highest margin (it's probably going to be a module), buy its bpo and research it to get the maximum time/material efficiency.
---
Lastly, you can do some research to find specific regional markets where demand for a specific item type is rare (off the top of my head, an incursion system or an active lowsec system that you can seed with ammo/ships/modules commonly used in those activities). Those market are much smaller though and you might not sell all of your stock at once before the system moves (incursion) or might get captured and become inactive (lowsec). It might also be much simpler to buy it in Jita and haul it to the system instead of making it. It's much simpler to always sell in Jita, but with good game knowledge and more work to haul it there, you can make more profit in smaller, sometimes temporary, regional markets.

Gonna be real funny when CCP ends this "event" prematurely and nullsec local reverts back to normal...
---
&gt; insane
---
Hes not insane, hes retarded :)
---
The equivalency comes in Isk cost dreads vs supercaps
---
&gt;Do you not think the game is/was heading toward/already in stagnancy in terms of huge player wars? Goons basically won with their titan fleet that no one can beat.
---
I joined the game because of the large, single server, unscripted sandbox environment. I think the [butterfly effect trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08hmqyejCYU) sums it up well. What's happened lately with CCP attacking player structures en mass is not an unscripted or sandbox environment. It has nothing to do with stagnation.
---
Huge player battles is good marketing, great morale boosters for empires because they can play with their toys...but that's only a handful of hours, days, and weeks.  A very small portion of actual gameplay involves large scale wars where there's thousands of players in ships / capitals involved.   
---
So to answer your question, if a pilot simply  waits for pings for large scale battles -- then yes, it's stagnant. No one taught him anything else, small gang PVP, blopsing/hunting/whaling, etc.
---
Alternatively you could lurk more and post less (not at all).
---
Half those ideas make it even easier for the large blocs, harder for smaller groups with lower incomes and manpower, and incentivize HS industry with jump freighter services moving finished goods to null with next to no risk.  
---
Making it “harder” doesn’t address the problem with holding more space.  
---
Things like capping alliance sizes, developing mechanics that actually put scaling pressure on groups to secure regions as they acquire more, limiting the number of supers and titans that can be deployed in a system, and fun to engage in sov mechanics would go a lot further.
---
From my experience by my internship with a company that works with resin printers I had different results, much better ones. 
---
It depends on which type of resin you youse and idk if you are yousing base coat layers, they help a lot to contain the paint and youse maybe some finishing varnish. With the filing, every material has his pro's and con's, that's a point I must agree to you.

I wish you a great day and fly safe!

You're

Just commenting to show you I'm not the one freaking out here. Have a good day at work.
---
Weird cause you could respect other people yet you chose not to.
---
Im working on something similar, see my reply
---
Under the mango tree
---
also, an orca in a small alliance \*needs\* local, as there isn't enough intel depth+reliability, and you need 10 seconds to warp - which even with local can be close as you can't deny your space to asteros either, so they can warp a sabre right on top of you
---
&gt;You're
---
When you weren't sure if you won the argument this confirms it.
---
Yes, players are shooting players. That is PVP. I was talking about both players trying to shoot each other. Not one player hunting and the other guy paying more attention to netflix than local. That is player shooting player, but it is hardly an actual fight. What everyone wants, including me, is more actual fights. I like making my KB green with vnis as much as the next man, but actual fights are more interesting.
---
"Its hilarious all you cocksuckers try and paint it as something else to try and shame players but you all just look fucking retarded."
---
Please don't put me into a group with some of those guys complaining on the forums. I don't think there is any need for name calling.
---
"Not to mention half the time you tackle a krab you're hoping for a manageable defense fleet to fight." 
---
Yes! Exactly. My point is, I believe that this will increase the rate at which people flood to the large umbrellas, while only ratting/mining with cynos on grid. I personally don't believe this will increase ganks and fighting, I think it will have the opposite effect. Of course, there is always idiots who won't do that. We were killing those idiots anyway.
---
I can agree with the last point. That will happen more often I think. I just worry that the number of people quitting or moving to the mega umbrellas will mean the only content those roaming gangs get will be other roaming gangs. And there are too few of them compared to how large EVE is. "It used to happen a lot" Local existed at that time too. Why not work out a way to gradually buff hunting in a more elegant way without causing your main targets to quit?
---
I think the game has a lot of issues now. I think that there should be less safety and more fights of every scale. I just don't believe deleting local permanently will do that. Maybe I am wrong entirely. Time will tell I guess.
---
lol I've probably been involved with eve since before you could drive.
---
I am a simple man, I see Astartes, I upvote. 
---
But it works really well with the Amarr Empire as well and now I am pondering how well a 40k Astartes would fare in EVE Online, assuming he was acclimatized/ brainwashed to serving the Amarrians
---
ahh, that mythical group of elite pvpers that love to krab and maintain sov just to provide content for random roamers.
---
That is asking for more than what you have shown other players based purely on their playstyle and whether they pay with isk instead of real money.  If respect was what you were after, you started off completely on the wrong foot.  Good luck to you.
---
oh god no
---
You can make money in high-sec even mining Veldspar in 1.0 or 0.9 systems. You need a ton of trit to build anything anyways so there's always a demand. Gankers don't tend to hit systems with high security status either unless you unnecessarily provoke them. ECM is an excellent tool against them as a jam will effectively neutralize a ship in the short engagement. 
---
This is why many say null has become way safer than high-sec for nullbears. In a competent alliance/coalition, the bear enjoys this desired safe space with near constant ample warning of danger. It's low effort endless farming of the richest resources that devalue mineral costs on the entire server.
---
yeah me too, gonna buy a 1month sub, then get the 1year bundle if it stays permanent. havent played for almost 3years now.
---
if they want to shoot bots they dont have to go that far:  [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98576072/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98576072/)  [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98565754/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98565754/)
---
Actually, you are the screecher here. Your entire argument is pointless. It doesn't matter if they paid with money, only that CCP was paid. 
---
Laughing at a forever alpha crying is one thing, as they truly don't contribute, but people PLEXing in fact do. Therein lies the difference, and it is where your viewpoint is wrong.
---
That ain't the half of it. I hear there was a hearty circlejerk too. Twas fun.
---
PLEASE I REPEAT RE READ THE OP. YOU DO NOT GET TO TELL ME WHAT I MEANT. I TELL YOU WHAT I MEANT. WHAT I SAID WAS THEY HAVE NOT PAID IRL CURRENCY IT IS TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY AND NOT EXPANDED ON. YOU ARE THE SCREECHER NOT I. YOU ALL HAVE PROVEN MY POINT ENTIRELY. YOU ALL START HURLING INSULTS AND TRASHING ME WHEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO I AM AND ALL I SAID IS THEY HAVENT HAD TO PAY WITH IRL CURRENCY IN A WHILE.
---
Rude
---
nuked from orbit by a hot drop ?
---
Making an accurate statement is disrespect what fantasy world are you living in?
---
its not every now and again, its multiple times a day i have to dock already, im not gona bother mining or ratting without defense fleet on grid without actual local with intel. 
---
It's also a direct buff to cloaky campers, which are 200% cancer already.
---
It's not that we need no local, that's just a neat feature to adds some fog of war, but if we replace 30k krabs with 15k pvpers I don't see how that would lead to less pvp.
---
So what if they haven't? There's no difference.
---
It's funny how always telling you to man up who doing PvP in T1 Tristans in Lowsec Plexes. And Spoiler Warning. Nothing will change for the Entity that is really targeted in all these "omg you nullsec bears, now you get what you deserve".
---
This desperated attempt to make nullsec more dangerous hits everyone, and really everyone besides of the mighty Imperium. The Difference between MER #1 and #2 + will be higher then before, especially when you count in all these second and third characters being a part of GSF just to rat and grind for their Main eLiTe Pilots.
---
Sounds maybe like brainwashed propaganda, but i stay with my statement from the past. Nothing, really nothing in the actual meta is able to break the Dominace the Imperium has. If you dont punish explicit just Goons or Delve, every change, every nerf will hit everyone else way harder then us.

Actually a log out timer would more effectively help highlight bots then most anything. Right now a bot being active for 18 hours during a day never would trip a alarm as people log on and then pretty much never log off. This creates 1000s of 23 hour users. 
---
Now with the threat cloaky camping effectively removed from the game, they may be able to include a timer. This would force bots to either have 2 or 3 bots in the system for different time periods or get caught out just on how long they are logged in.
---
Hey look a reason to fight
---
you've spelled "lost their great name" aka PL wrong
---
Yep, jump in. :)
---
Unless the fuel is an extremely rare thing that does NOT spawn in every goddamn system and requires alliances to actual conquer and hold space, then this is terrible and no I would not want it, go away, vamoosh. No local is a good thing. The community's reaction is 99% reaction-baiting/streamer """"""content"""""" generation/whatever.
---
The difference being they haven't had to pay with their own money. Nobody but you screechers are bringing up CCP and their profit. I'm talking about the krabs here who haven't had to pay a dime of THEIR own money in a while. My post is simple and is to be taken literally and not expanded on.
---
Sure but /u/chocoscoots didn't make that argument. You did. He just called someone dumb without further explanation.
---
That will maybe bring back the remaining 5 PL People from Fortnite.
---
It's free, try it. :)
---
Spend some hour, days in it and if you like it, make your sub. :)
---
Even in that extreme case, Curse has 63.56% of the DPS of the Gila.
---
The 36.42% is a tad more than that 10%, which was the point of my reply.
---
Less local safety means hopefully more roaming/standing fleets. 
---
We might see more smaller gate camps as people try to secure their space.
---
Damn dudes, thought you two would retire in snigg haha
---
IIRC Grath was quitting in September 2018, bcs 'CCP turned Eve p2w with the PA acquisition'. Nevertheless, glad to see them back.
---
how does adding some fog of war increase pvp?  i mean, i guess gate camps will increase in frequency.  yea?
---
pvpers have always been able to pvp.  pvp between pvp groups has always been there.  what roamers have been bitching about for years is that krabs are harder to find and catch.  I just don't understand how an update that will lead to fewer krabs will be better for "pvp"?
---
Not really. Especially when you have fatigueless gates everywhere so getting home is usually fatigue free. By the time you're back in Keepstar#5432 the timer is down.
---
That and there's plenty of other guys ready to drop.
---

Call me when u cop jimmy217
---
I just started about 3 weeks ago and I’m loving it. Remember, it’s NOT like other mmorpgs.
---
Yes, you can't take gates there.
---
If you think about it dronelands are the perfect place to adopt the goon model. For years panfam has been renting out some of the best space in the game to well renters.
---
when is the blackout active?
---
Don't they have a Goon batphone, if you guys get too balsy and take entire Querious?
---
hi im from test whats your in game name so i can kick u
---
Awesome thanks man
---
Just a guess... Because there's no use for 40 Rorquals without local?
---
Or it's likely to die.
---
Hell yea!
---
It does however make you the new habit. ;)
---
Except that doesn't matter. It's $15. People in developed countries make more than that for an hour of work. It's nothing, and represents no discriminating factor whatsoever.
---
If you are looking for your own or other character kills/losses for  ship type, find the character on zkill, and click on Trophies, it'll have a cool list https://zkillboard.com/character/94615654/trophies/
---
Whats the fit for these nestors?
---
A webbed MWD'ing Inty still goes very fast. The only way to keep up with one would be with a MWD, which _would_ then be shut off by the Inty's [range bonused] scram.
---
Reddit is always negative or memes.
---
Eve is still fun.
---
Hunters can already fight other hunters if they wanted. However for some reason they prefer not to do. What will change if more players resub?
---
My dude!!!!
---
But who will have a less safe EvE for the next time ? It's not the entity that everyone was aiming for. It hits everyone equal, but who will compensate it best ? Spoiler, its still the Group that got the best infrastructure, the best Home Defence etc.
---
I've said it many many times before. If you wanna get back balance in the force, you have to aim for Delve and the Imperium with your changes. Otherwise we will stay where we are. Overall with a few percent less MER on #1, but everyone who's not a part of the Imperium will recognize way bigger impacts onto their lifes. 
---
More people will flee under the Supercap Umbrella, more people will choose the relative safe way of sitting in Delve, where atleast someone can drop some stuff onto Drifters. 
---
Maybe now the Tide is changing and Highsec or Lowsec will be the new overlords in EvE (lulz)
---
Tribalism
---
What he means is the owners of the northern rent empire sticked to flat isk rent from renters, going direct to the landlords who used that to pay for infra and SRP. Thyley were even renting out to alliance members/alts.
---
Now they are adopting the model where every line member can krab on their own for free, under the umbrella, increase their own wealth and pay small fee to the whole alliance/coalition.
---
They are a coalition member, not a renter
---
My chosen MMO to play, will be Life. I will be performing a krabbing activity called "overtime", and prepping for a moveop to Kansas City for a battalion reunion, and then on to Colorado where an old flame awaits. Then I will redeploy home, and resume krabbing by doing more "overtime".
---
&gt; People have spent months demanding a solution to the botting problem- But now when a potential fix appears, everyone's swapped to "BUT BUT LESS CHARACTERS IN GAME". Take your pick. 
---
This is not a fix. EVE is a game, where we pay for the company. It is their job, to keep the game cleen from bots. Give the duty to players is not a solution. And it will not affect them all. Do you think that people will watch 23/7 every system, so the bots will eat more money then make it?
---
I hate too that I have to fly for hours, and still not get content. Not even some krabber, and we should agree, that hunting down pve ships is not really a pvp content.
---
A cloaky neut already can fuck up the systems. Now imagine, that you don't even know, that there is a camper. You have no idea, when he lit up a covert cyno, and a few hundred ship comes in. And you really think that alliances want to save rattlesnakes, ravens or something like that? Or even able to? How long newbies will be able to sustain that?
---
And what do you think, how much time nowdays people have for that? Most of the playerbase grown up. They don't have time to krab AND war AND CTA AND roam and all that shit, cause some of them have a life i guess.
---
At least CCP should do this some other way. A structure, what you have to pay for, and maintain, to generate the local in regions, and attackers can fuck it up. Then even that shit would generate content, and both side would have to put effort in to gain something from it.
---
Hell yeah brother. We went to this model (sans living in the wormhole) last year in earnest and it's payed dividends.
---
Yeah actually. I fly 2races of hic, winmatar hacs, and training booster skills
---
Well... Apocrypha update with wormholes was added in 2009. So 10 years?
---
Dscan range is a fixed number. Changing it isn’t possible without messing with a lot of legacy code that no one wants to mess with. CCP mentioned thinking about adding a range bonus to recons a while ago and nixing the idea because of how complicated changing it would be
---
It's only going to last for this event which is already mostly complete, it's not permanent. Not need to get ur panties all bunched
---
Which C5 corp were you a part of that was too scared to get evicted if they merely rolled holes to rat? Lol
---
Dude, don't teach an old bear please, I'm not new and not an idiot, I know perfectly what kind of money at what kind of effort mining Veldspar in 1.0 or 0.9.
---
Ganktards can come everywhere, and they love high security systems for newbie scamming potential.
---
ECM is 100% useless, you got one chance, which is not even high at non-super-specialized ship and skillset, and if it misses you're dead, (and if it hits you're dead anyway if they brought one extra tard).
---
Null became safe because ganktards got lazy, got their own sov, and then died (rip skillu you will not be missed), in the meantime a single Olmeca (I talked to him, and my impression was that he got nothing but ego) made rorq mining that much more dangerous.
---
It's those ganktards who preached safety in numbers and capitals to nullsec. Be careful with what you wish for, I guess...
---
Post your killboard
---
No. I'm saying that much of that 32k is alts
---
What did you expect to read more precisly?
---
&gt; they love the risk free isk printing machine too much to stop now.
---
No they like the relative safety of what they signed up for. Unfortunately, many krabs will stop paying for the server that we need up.
---
Uhm. Moons, plus manufacturing facilities, plus citadels for various purposes means that is impractical for the population of delve
---
This.
---
Stay Classy lmao
---
Tribute and Vale are a whole, so Test wisely evacced, because they were next.
---
Yeah it's really easy to spot a new sig- just put your other cosmic sigs on ignore.
---
It works better than watching local, where's you have to watch unhighlighted new entries. In whs we only need to notice the entirely new and only sig show up.
---
It's extremely easy. We literally haven't been ganked by any party who came through a sig in there current system. We've been ganked by people whose sig appeared in our own home who than jumped in to our static, but that's because our corp mate wasn't watching all the holes.
---
So it's extremely rare to get ganked. I've been living in whs for 4 years now and I've never been ganked other than when I was baiting. To be fair though, I'm very careful and don't rat as much as others (I can just buy Plex). 
---
Overall It's extremely safe if you make the effort to make it safe.
---
O yeah. Cause when all those people who now use plex to subscribe stop buy it on the market, those who sell it will stop buy it from CCP. And you know, 500 plex from CCP worth more then a subscription in $$. So they will get less money. GG
---
Dunking on Provi because you can't play with the big boys will get you to the top of that kb ;)
---
Right now, you have perfect intel on how many friends the auto-piloting Drake has in the system next-door and if they outnumber you then you are not going to take the bait. Without that free intel you are going to see a lot more fights erupt spontaneously simply because neither side knew what the other could eventually bring. The pvp-crowd also tends to be more aggressive and less risk-averse in this regard, so the number of fights should go up.
---
But this still doesn't change the fact that by just replacing krabs with pvpers we are going to get more fights anyway, local or no.
---
Haha it's funny because you're saying that he's gay.
---
what class?
---
*Maaaaaassive bong hits* ... Keep on truckin! :D love you all, Im gonna still keep winning Eve for now though.
---
In your utopia nobody buy plex for isk. Cause people will not krab without local for weeks to be able to buy some new skin.
---
Y'all have begged for local to be removed, (Toyota,  you got it), now deal with its ramifications and repercussions without whining about the lack of intel local gave you.
---
Holy shit it would be absolutely braindead retarded to make alliances fuel local with PLEX, which is exactly why I expect CCP to implement it
---
If you use chrome there is an option to switch off mobile mode.
---
And we have now created a fleet-role where you actually reward the skilled player in their ability to scout beyond counting coloured tags in local.
---
They don't. They think its elite PvP time now, killing lone VNI's. It's actually hilarious reading the trash players argue with the bots farms. Both are just REEEEEEEEEEE
---
I just don't see how it's so over exciting or how's it's worrying.
---
Roaming from WH space with the null local blackout sounds like it could almost be as much fun as old eve
---
It's almost as if this is a game and they chose to be a part of that specific group. Since when does having your own individual opinion mean fuck all if you don't act on it, and you are part of a group that is the anti-thesis of your blessed individual opinion.
---
This is glorious!
---
It's held so far.
---
As far as high-sec goes, gankers understand game mechanics whereas their opponents have a difficult time with it. Bears prefer the head in the sand approach and frustratingly wonder why it has no effect.
---
So the meta now is the super/cap umbrella. It's CCP's job to keep the game competitive and challenging. Removing local should not hinder an old bear like yourself.
---
Kill each other ofc.  This is Eve after all, only the strongest survive!
---
So, if big-block null isn't completely safe, they want to unsub?  ROFL
---
I made two replies and this is the one you chose to respond to only proves you are wrong and are grasping at straws.
---
Reza, should i get back into it or not...
---
&gt;Content. The initial panic of Invasion has caused large portions of nullsec to band together and form impromptu NIP's. 
---
CHANGE IS HAPPENING, better friend everyone up so noone takes advantage of a bit of turmoil to get an edge in this game! Wait till things settle down then pretend to fight again!
---
Are they the senior most member or is that DARKNESS? Makes no sense if they arent the ones leading.. ?
---
Either quit altogether or move under a super umbrella. (People are doing this already, but this will make it even more attractive.)You won't be able to kill anyone but idiots or AFK krabbers. You were killing them anyway.
---
Yea I dont think Panfam FCs were prepared for another 3 months of wanding. 
---
All in all, it was a good move by TEST, which TEST *initiated.*
---
And you seriously think that you (+ goon friends) don't have the manpower to fight back?  
---
Now tell me who the coward is in that scenario, the guy hypothetically not engaging you. Or could it be you, sticking your head up your ass before you even undocked.
---
they are removing local from null
---
What? Where did I say that? Botting is bad and ruining the economy. Having the opinion that deleting local won't hurt the botters long term, is not support for botting. I think there are better solutions to catching and killing/stopping botters.
---
Was even more deep in EVE as your presence in local chat gave anyone in local access to all your character information, keys being.  
---
Corp/Alliance Info.
---
From there people could deduce a lot about you from other sources such as Zkill. Quick player search they can tell what you like to fly, who you like to fly with, where you fly. ETC.  
---
On top of that player groups could tag other groups as friendly or hostile (standings) and characters would show in local with (foe) Red/Orange - or (friend) Light/Dark Blue + or (neutral) Grey =. Meaning at a quick glance you can tell anyone coming into system is a friend or a foe.   
---
And all you have to do to get all this information....just be in the same system.
---
I predict that deleting local will increase the rate of people moving under strong umbrellas. Every ship will have a cyno. The only ships you can kill will be piloted by AFKers or idiots, and you were killing those guys anyway. I want EVE to be less safe, our corp roams far too often only catch one vni and kill a cyno nereus on a keepstar before getting dropped on maybe. I would like to see more ships get caught and more small gang fights. I just don't believe this will give us that reality.
---
"sort by most controversial"
---
My subscription can revert back to normal just as quickly.
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg
---
That would be nice. But I think defenders advantage in supers and titans will stop any fun roamers will have. I think a slightly delayed local and changing the order that things load in the client would mean more stuff gets caught. Right now, local loads before most of the rest of the assets, you are in local while you have a black screen. I think fixing that would solve the issue somewhat. This is too drastic and will cause content to quit or totally move under a few umbrellas finally.
---
They fixing cloaky camping in Nullsec by removing Local Chat.
---
18 logistic frigs costed 11 bil? Wth was on their fits?
---
They can form up 600 ppl according to sort.soo why not?
---
Can't really fight if the thing is anchored on a hostile keepstar grid
---
He's not wrong. The Invasion NIP/retreat is absolutely indicative of the fact that the nullsec powerblocks don't actually want any change.
---
or a new use for an old meme
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M56HkdKs2U
---
Fuck goonswarm and fuck goons
---
Skill up as &lt;2s interceptor capable to light a cyno and point something is something that you can do now.
---
You've got a 'fair sized fleet' and you don't have enough people in small ships to watch the gates?
---
A dscan range bonus is a nice idea but since it's currently 2^63 km I'm pretty sure there's Legacy Code reasons why that won't happen.
---
Stuka and fun? Wouldn't be for me if I flew them for the last 2 years.
---
Most of those structures are probably athanors since it is required to have one for each moon you want to mine.
---
'From Goons', who generated the highest salt output because of this change?
---
Doing anything other then shooting at another players constitute PVE :P lol nice one
---
I think it would be cool if it was like a station service but on the TCU, you entosis it, once it's reinforced, it's turned off and needs to be turned on again by the owning alliance by entosising it. Kind of makes sense too since the components to build entosis links come from the Drifters.
---
* Gives you a way to harrass alliances, and try to generate a response/fight which is currently missing from the game. Also if you are successful it can also generate some good ambushes as well as cool stuff like hidden dreadbombs etc. 
---
* If you turn it off, you can then camp it with stealth bombers/recons etc. and gank the entosis ship that comes to try and turn it back on since they can't see you in local until it's repaired.
---
* 6x VNIs/Gilas that warp to citadels/POS in every single system the exact same tick you enter, don't respond in local and play 23/7?. No Problem, entosis their TCU local service and we can take the problem into our own hands as players instead of waiting for team security to ban them.
---
So just 3 nullsec groups left, all using the same strategy of super umbrella in a tight area.
---
I wonder how long CCP will take to finally act on this. Probably a few years too late.
---
Darkness line members confused perspective:
---
Darkness is lead kinda by default as the coalition leader, Sort is leader of Darkness. 
---
Other than that Darkness and RR are pretty evenly tiered. It's a really weird coalition compared to some others as a massive portion of RR don't speak English, and good luck teaching ~~alcoholics~~ Australians Chinese. So there's not really much intermingling except at the highest level.
---
I don't think that's a problem that would need fixing.
---
You just got too accustomed to the world of perfect intel.
---
All of the 3 above would shit on people not yet there and do nothing to those who already have a headstart
---
&gt; but some of the blame should be aimed at the players as well.
---
Some? These guys have an opportunity to hit their enemies while their enemies are distracted, and they're opting to hold hands and be nice until the scary moment is over. CCP couldn't force them to be more risk averse if they tried.
---
I resubed my main this morning with the star pack
---
*insert IDidMyPart.gif* 
---
Now all I'll do is station spinning again, but this time I'm paying for it xD
---
I would like points (scrams/disruptors) to disable cynos from being activated like mwd with scram and allow scrams to shut down an active cyno.
---
Did you reply to the wrong post or something?
---
Actually let say that upper limit is 3-5 accounts.        
---
How this will shit on new people if others have to reduce accounts?           
---
Extractor nerf? Like all alt accounts have costs now.          
---
Guess what all those new people have niches they can fill that are not abused by free alt accounts of older players.           
---
Excavator removal?      
---
We need this ...
---
Disallow cynos in lowsec? Hey genious. How are you going to move stuff to null and back then? Also we pirates like our cap fights too. Piss off.
---
remindme! 3 weeks
---
Are we no longer allowed to recognize problems within our own groups and ourselves? Sorry, but this exact line of thinking is one of the reasons why political discourse is so horrendous and full of shit right now. Yeah, he's a goon, but he's not obligated to believe that super umbrella is the best thing ever.
---
RemindMe? 23 days
---
&gt; Whatever else drifters have done, they have 100% killed a ton of content.
---
The content was already dead when the coalition leaders murdered it years ago, by all making friends, and committing not to engaging in real war.
---
That sounds rad, you got space for me to return? :)
---
Now this is spod racing!
---
dscan bonsus would just be used by krabs, so then people will be screaming krabs have it too easy again
---
Yeah in AUTZ! LOLOLOLOL
---
There is no such thing as free. They buy plex. Some one else had to pay for that plex. It doesn’t appear out of thin air. 
---
And technically krabs have to put in time which is a form of payment. 
---
It’s a really basic economic principle. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
---
Why'd you delete your other thread? Seems like you were, uh, exercising your unique opinions there just fine.
---
Stay away from my corpse container, that is for my eyes only
---
I mean it's a Chinese alliance, shockingly they form really well in their prime.
---
Limit farm per region. Introduce a counter to cynoes. Increase isk/hr. If these are combined with a local change then null can be the intended high risk high reward environment again.
---
Flair checks out ))))
---
Jokes aside a crit static will usually get a T3D or Assault Frigate fleet rammed down your throat.
---
Imagine being this dumb
---
&gt; then an NPC could fill your place
---
But they don't.
---
ISK isn't created by plexing.
---
And that is still independent of the idea that one might pay for a subscription if they are unable to plex in-game.
---
But excercising ones ability to plex in-game makes CCP more money than choosing not to.
---
&gt;On the other hand, as soon as you tackle something worth killing in Goon, Legacy or Pandemic Horde space, a cyno goes up and multiple faxes and a lot of supers come through.
---
as currently happens
---
&gt; What does making the abyssal market less profitable have to do with anything?
---
They won't make as much money. And we'll get abyssal stuff cheaper.
---
Right now abyssal sites are competitive because people aren't doing them too much.
---
Not sure what you mean...this completely removes cloaky camping. Sounds like a pretty big nerf to me.
---
hm if they want people to spread they either need to completely remove jumpdrives on capitals or greatly increase (double+) its range...
---
there will allways be umbrellas especially capital umbrellas because those ones are the fastest to react in homedefense cuz of their jumpdrive.
---
thats why they feel so opressive because roamers bring usually more nimble ships that stand next to no chance if a Hel with 7k dps and three tracking computers sits on them.
---
if you want to get people in areas without umbrellas you either completely remove the umbrella or also increase its range, otherwise people won't leave - look at delve its overpopulated but there are still empty systems nobody crabs in. there is still room for more people in delve and its the most crowded space there is!
---
doubling jumprange would be also great for hotdropping dreadnoughts and would increase the speed of capital moveops.
---
\&gt;jump super into jammer
---
\&gt;tackled cyno vni dies
---
\&gt; 80 bombers jump in
---
wew good job you saved that vni
---
VFK by Winter!!!
---
When Capitals and Supercapitals got all their new capital mods it was argued that giving them mods that allow them to be fit like other ships will cause them to be used more often. It worked so well that Capitals and Supercapitals replaced subcapitals for defense fleets. This killed roaming and small gangs. It lead to Rorqual proliferation to the highest of levels. Which in turn lead to super cheap and mass proliferation of Supers and Titans. It's wrong and the cyno is the reason why.
---
If you want your Capitals and Supercaps to be fit like subcaps and used like subcaps, then you need to travel like subcaps. It's stupid that strategic assets can move around quicker that cruiser fleets. Capital and Supercapitals should be for big strategic fights, not every day defense fleets.
---
Proposed fix:
---
1. Allow JFs to jump to Black Ops cynos. 
---
2. Give jump gates the ability to move supercapitals around. 
---
3. Only allow cyno jumps from systems 1 gate jump out. This allows you to bring the Capitals and Supercapitals precisely on grid and disallows your adversary from gatecamping your fleet out.
---
I'd rather see no corvette could light a cyno.
---
you can't see blopsing via dscan

It should be noted the guy doing the angel caps died

No local?  As someone who's been supporting no local everywhere since 2003 I'm now thinking about something I thought I'd never do and resubbinv Infinity Ziona for glorious null sec ganking
---
It sucks because goons do it or because it’s the only model that works?
---
Particularly amusing given that without local, AFK cloaky camping isn't really an issue at all.
---
&gt; Makes it easier ...
---
Cause of that - NO!
---
As a scared rorqual miner...I can say it is a big deal to me. I have one account I rorqual mine with, one hulk account, and one PvP account. 
---
I can't afford to lose any excavators. The rorqual account can fly a super though so...I'll either do that and train the hulk into a hunter for my PvP account or just go play elite dangerous. 
---
I'm not a serious player in eve though. I don't spend enough real money or have enough insight into game mechanics to have people care about my opinion.
---
Actually someone else paid for it. I just took down the fob in it :)
---
hi gigx
---
or you know, with no local, you can just plant like 3 bombers in a system with miners and bomb their excavators..
---
How do you refund someones 40 accounts?
---
For the rest, stockpiles of mats.
---
Industry teams? That sounds so familiar
---
goons sitting all day in delve droping tits on t1 frigs...how about that?
---
&gt; Because if any WH groups found out you were doing this you and all your shit would get a one way ticket back to K space.
---
I'm in a null corp and have been maintaining a C5 farm-hole for the last 2 years.
---
Literally all I've done was to roll away active holes, krab and play dead if there's a PVP group in the chain. 
---
The closest thing that has happened to me being kicked out was that someone group killed my main astra for loot but didn't show up for any other timer after they saw I had moved out all assets. Just had to replace the 2b astrahus.
---
Nobody evicts farm-holes anymore because of citadel mechanics. You just have to anchor a handful structures and space the timers out over an entire week and 3 different timezones. Most people don't want to show up monday at 11:00, tuesday at 19:00 wednesday at 02:00, etc for an entire week.
---
I’m taking credit for this.
---
I gotta say... CCP should have done this long ago.
---
You guys get more Ore, guaranteed belts and rats, ice,  super capitals.... And static doors that are easier to defend. So tell me why it is you need things easier than the wormhole people? When you have more things than they do... Personally I think that null sec should lose its local permanently. either that or you're going to have to find a way to make wormholes on par with null
---
Always &lt;3
---
Yea bro, feels like the old good times~
---
Lmao, you're not wrong. Though I haven't touched Dota in about 4 months and COH in probably a year and a half, the latter because for better or worse the game has died on Steam. 
---
I miss you too man, even if winning EVE has been good for me it still sucks to leave good friends behind.
---
It actually is

Luv you bro

Oi play the new god of War on ps4 if you haven't already. It's one of the best exclusives available atm.
---
Nice, who should I get in touch with in-game? My new flat doesn't have internet until Friday but I've been going to the pub a few doors down for wifi ^^
---
That surely won't piss people off like no tomorrow.
---
Not to mention, massive amounts alt account make up for a hilarious portion of CCP income.
---
I don't care much for QFC, but you're just coming off as a child here. Did QFC humiliate you, or do you just get off on making yourself look stupid?
---
What's the point in all those ships if you aren't getting them blown up?
---
round 1, FIGHT!
---
I remember when I was new and believed the words that came from CCP.
---
Case in point, and I admit entirely circumstantial, but wife and I recently resubbed after years of inactivity because we read about the drifter stuff And thought "maybe we will give it another look."
---
Oh my god the salt mines, can we actually do this, I wanna see more tears
---
Just get in our public channel (right click on corp info) and we will get you sorted
---
Because people in this game rather have ganks instead of fights.
---
Fuuuuuck, into the breach once more we go then.
---
Viral marketing
---
I had small discussions with a couple of people in other threads but would like you take on this option Suitonia.
---
What if normal cynos reduced lock range to zero so that cynos could only be fit as a dedicated role rather than a backup one?  Covert cynos exempt and work as usual.
---
What would be the downside of this change in your opinion?
---
A good tiamat fit doesn't exist.
---
Here's OP's original attempt at this thread; [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ca4ybm/comical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ca4ybm/comical/)
---
Will do!
---
I think he meant Constallation chat? few years ago we used to had those.
---
A system won't support that many people. And that still provides content, even if it's as bad as you say that's still better than today.
---
&gt; solo &amp; group roaming in subcaps is dead.
---
Already true
---
&gt;You ever notice how you make a valid point on how null sec krabs don't  pay for their accounts with IRL currency and then all the nullsec KRABS  start screeching trying to tell you what you meant by your post. IDC if  CCP is profiting or not. The point is your playing the game essentially  for free. And you have the gall to complain that CCP is making changes  to the game. How about you quit trying to call users like me out and you  actually a. Quit or b. STFU 
---
You're getting your panties in a bunch over semantics. This thread, and your previous ones are basically peak meme.
---
In a region, not owned by an alliance. I wish there was a way that I could think of to do it based on average players per system to encourage more spreading out, but null would weaponize that sadly.
---
we'll do our best to get the best of both worlds
---
No one ever truly quits EVE.
---
In the worst case, the tears will be grand when CCP realises they don't have money to run the game anymore :P
---
Then that has thankfully changed.
---
Amazing vid ! Well done and welcome back !
---
All the mechanics you suggested are so, so easily abusable. "Titan cap in system", we got our Titan nerds in system 4 hours early, so we automatically win. The only counter is to alarm clock even more and get your Titans in system 6 hours early, etc.
---
I’m on mobile with a small screen, what is he doing?
---
One of my bitterest memories is roaming around solo in a mega and finally getting a 3 vs 1.  Took so long probably because everyone thought it was bait for cyno.
---
Killed one guy, having a great fight and PL cyno goes up, 50 ships jump onto both sides fighting and that's it.  
---
Not bitter because of ship kill, a roaming solo mega is always going to explode eventually, bitter because it becomes almost a waste of time to try to get a fight and I'd have liked to know the outcome of that one as it was shaping up to be a good time.
---
Full scale Merlin model. Some assembly required.
---
Does anybody still care about the goons? Hmm.
---
You got it backwards mate, wh have the best accessibility on demand. We live in a wh with a nullsec static that we roll until we find an interesting roaming ground, have access to the best farmholes in wh and can usually find an entrance to hs within a wh connection or two. We can then roll the hs connection so that it's closer to Jita if we want to do logistics.
---
Where else can you be 0-3 jumps away from null, hs and lucrative wh space (in terms of krabbimg grounds and kills).
---
Why not go a bit further and steal em?
---
Grath has thrown a wobbler nearly every year, he picks his dummy up off the floor and comes scurrying back everytime.
---
Certainly but the amount of SP locked up in that is pretty crazy for a farmhole. That's two high skill battleship mains, and an extra well skilled alt.
---
You could probably get that working by account sharing the workload provided you can set up all the characters yourself though. You'll almost certainly still die if a pre-formed leshak blob rolls into you, but thankfully nobody rolls C6 space right now.
---
It's almost as if no local will benefit larger, more organized groups rather than smaller entities. Who would have guessed? 😏
---
Whodis
---
LOL - got a down-vote before the first comment! :-)
---
Proof needed, no screen shot no up boat.
---
And you know, 4-5 times the isk/hour so the length of time you have to be vigilant is much shorter. 
---
That part gets missed somehow.
---
cycling missions to only get the fast, profitable one bitzable in carrier.
---
Yes, i can distinguish between indivuals and groups.  
---
Doesn't keep me from calling out holier-than-thou attitudes when i see them.  
---
Don't you think it is problematic when people delude themselves into thinking they are doing the right thing just because they are holding a specific belief. And then support a group that is directly opposed to that belief.  
---
There's a disconnect there.  
---
To give an extreme example: *oh yes mr judge at the nuremberg trials. I was a member of the nsdap, but you know, i never really agreed with hitler hating the jews. So you can't really hold me accountable for what happened under nazi rule, right?"
---
I know that this is seeing things fairly black and white, and i.e. i am ignorant to what the two goons above are doing internally in goonswarm. They might be the biggest critics of mer-meta that there are.
---
But as things stand, i will call them out on their hypocrisy, the way i am perceiving it with the information available to me.  
---
 I admit i am painting people with a brush that is too big, and that that is problematic if you wanna have a useful, honest conversation.  
---
If they or myself should change our opinions i won't hold a grudge against them. It's just important that people are honest with themselves.
---
There is no high reward activity that supports more than 1 person per system.
---
Remember VOLT?  lmao.
---
More broken things from ccp
---
I was there dude (I'm ex-Infinite Point). PL had shut down the use of the Vale after they defeated CO2. They dropped on everything they could, basically shutting down the use of the space.
---
It only took a week or 2 of that before TEST leadership decided to GTFO. 
---
If I had to guess, the main reason TEST didn't fight an entosis war alone for the lols was because the opportunity was there to team up wih the recently displaced co2 to take the South together. Plus, why exhaust resources and burn out pilots fighting an unwinable war when you could evacuate and fight a winable war for better space somewhere else?
---
Regardless, it was still PL forcing us to leave at the time by farming us with supers.
---
Yes, need the ts:dw version

Yes need the ts:dw version.

Try frigate burners ....
---
We NEVER roll holes to rat. It's against the rules. We NEVER Crit holes to rat, also against the rules. If we do rat we leave all holes open because ratters are good bait for PvP.
---
You are a little bitch if you "crit/roll holes to rat" and you WILL find yourself back in K space for being a filthy crab. 
---
Just because you are too insignificant and have flown under the radar this long doesn't mean you are right. I know who you are now.
---
There's a lot more that should be done to cynos, but this would be a positive change overall.
---
Though I really don't think you should be able to fit a cyno to a corvette. Surely it's not intended behaviour that you can get a free cyno ship anywhere.
---
I have a 2003 character as well as Seraph who is my main. But sure thing matey, sure thing. 
---
There's plenty of people here that have been involved from  the get go who aren't throwing their toys out of the pram because nullsec is supposed to be hard. There's also plenty of null people who are loving this change. So either adapt, and play a game you have so very heavily invested in (apparently) or quit... Don't go whining that suddenly nullsec got hard again.
---
me mr goonswarm not likey little guy make isk
---
grunt grunt pls nerf
---
Doesnt drone lands produce pretty much worthless 10/10s?
---
Make sure to use the glamourex boosters when you run those!
---
&gt; I just don't see how it's even possible to make a game that enable "sandboxy" freedom EVE currently provides without incentivizing teaming up over anything else.
---
Make it easier to destroy citadels for one. Right now, unless you can field a massive cap/super fleet with a matching subcap fleet, you can forget about taking space from anybody. This alone is a huge driver for consolidation. Suitonia's post goes into many of these things. Or the effectiveness of caps against subcaps (which is fucking insane), which further incentivizes cap/super use -&gt; proliferation -&gt; consolidation because nobody wants to lose their caps/supers, but the only way to *do* anything in null is with caps/supers because subcaps are so hopelessly outmatched by a well-armed citadel and an opposing cap/super fleet which is so fucking large because issues regarding citadels, consolidation, etc. These are all feedback loops that CCP has created, but it doesn't have to be this way.
---
It's much harder to bring in caps in wormholes because you need to build them and can't import them directly. Since wh fights are usually subcap vs subcap, a lot of people don't have caps trained (or are not really trained all that much), since the only 2 uses for caps are home defense (which can happen rarely) and crabbing in the homehole (a lot of corps rely on their static to farm and don't really farm in their homehole).
---
After that, in a fight once you get destroyed and podded, you get sent back to kspace and usually far away from the fight so reshipping basically never happens. If you get evicted by a corp that knows what they're doing, they'll know how many people you have and can prepare for the caps that you bring. A determined attacker with enough friends will usually win the day.
---
I am suggesting you get rid of this info in game and out. Keep general info but dont break it down by the hour.   If a person wants to know something they have to be in space getting it.
---
Cake day is over now ):
---
Hi
---
I'm suddenly intrigued...
---
See! Its happening already!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but currently if you leave your cyno on auto-repeat I'm fairly sure you can ignore cyno jammers.
---
If this bug still exists it would obviously need to be fixed too.
---
I got 5 years as Corp Jeff. It was a good run.
---
Yes but in the goon model its not about how much cash you can do but how much you can mine. Yes the income of each member might be worse then anywhere else but if you can support hundreds of rorqs due to how hard is actually to drop them as well as how good your umbrella will be in the drone lands (entire regions are overlapping on each other.) then you could easily provide hard srp for each member, infinitely.
---
Apparently not 😔 few other people have been saying the FPS is very low...
---
Do people actually believe like you? Wow, just, wow.
---
Get outside more dude, the basement is fucking with your brain.
---
This is a really great idea. Let's do it.
---
&gt; it's payed dividends
---
fucking krabs
---
what if kyle did let this happen?
---
Makes the systems "strained" with more than 20-30 online with a 10 second delay. And just stop working when you have 100 in a single system? That would force people to spread out for intel reasons.
---
&gt;  Ratting will be less afk but not more dangerous.
---
Don't be silly.
---
Oh wow
---
So... we go back and forth to WoW? XD
---
They same the same thing there...
---
I come from WoW, so I know these things ;p
---
So much this.  
---
CCP seems to be trying to shake things up.  They are so far doing low effort stuff (from a programming standpoint).  No Local screws the bots and the not-try-hards outside of the umbrellas.  
---
Next they have to do something about the umbrellas  (longer respawn of anomalies?  add fatigue to jump bridges certainly.)
---
What the fuck do you think Imperium was doing lately? Certainly not making nice with the people of Tribute, that is for certain. Just because the residents ran away doesn't make them blue.
---
Rorqs will just downgrade to T2 drones.
---
Lore wise, that fluid should only be available in HiSec ... wouldn't that make the "Reeeee" even more awesome? :-D
---
Alliance A can only bring 4, B bring 4, C bring 4, etc.  
---
Making things harder doesn’t fix the problems everyone complains about.  It won’t reduce the dependence on bringing more supers and titans than the other side.  It just makes it easier for the the group with the most resources and even harder for the guys trying to get into null.  
---
Unless there is actual pressure to utilize all space a group holds, and limits to what large groups can bring to balance out fights for those that don’t have 1000 titans, null will always look the way it does.  
---
People need to deal with it.  That’s literally their only option.  CCP can not balance power in null, it’s a pipe dream.
---
Use T2 drones. Still good yield and no risk.
---
&gt; As far as high-sec goes, gankers understand game mechanics whereas their opponents have a difficult time with it. Bears prefer the head in the sand approach and frustratingly wonder why it has no effect.
---
It's 100% opposite. Ganktards are utter and complete morons, who are barely able to execute two-step approaches, while ganktard security is mechanically impossible, you can take 16 steps and still get ganktarded by a person not intellectually fit to serve hamburgers. It's just mechanics concerning ganktarding are so simple and favor the ganktard so heavily, that a trained dog could probably pull a gank off.
---
&gt; o the meta now is the super/cap umbrella. Removing local should not hinder an old bear like yourself.
---
IF I were in the alliance that offers the supercap umbrella, I'd be fine.
---
All alliances that do not have it are utterly screwed and forced into blocs harder than ever before. Removing local forces them two options - go bloc or disband, and the same choice is for each individual player in those alliances - the choice is go bloc, or get rekt, because the only way without local is to become content for blocs and ganktards every day 23/7, which is obviously not an option.
---
&gt; It's CCP's job to keep the game competitive and challenging.
---
They pushed me out of hisec, now they push me into bloc, what next they do to make it "competitive and challenging" for me? I am not sure I will stay to find out.
---
Time for a live show with both of you on it ayyy
---
You know you want it
---
A lot of hunters also krab some.  But they don't need to maintain multiple rorqs and ratting supers since they don't need a fleet of titans to play the game.  They just need enough to feed some bling and maybe PLEX one or two of a few accounts.
---
Titans and supers are wasted if you can't make lots more than the other guy.
---
Yeah who even is this 'ben' diplo halp /u/garric_shadowbane
---
Any group big enough to maintain scouts on every gate will simply have scouts on every gate. At the other end of the spectrum, anyone who can't maintain enough scouts or otherwise access, gather and share intel will be increasingly fucked. All attempts to fuck the rich inevitably fail whether in real life or space games. The rich get richer and the little guy gets surprise buttsecks
---
"The pvp-crowd also tends to be more aggressive and less risk-averse in this regard."
---
made me chuckle a bit.  thanks.
---
It's a PA bought CCP reference
---
CCP has fewer resources than before.
---
We need recommendations that are easy to code.  Nerfing the VNI was much easier than recoding rat aggro.  Likewise we need easy to code ways to rebalance the anoms.  
---
Thank god they seem to have bigger balls than before as well.
---
Ok, Goonswarm A brings 4, Goonswarm B brings 4, Asher's personal let alliance brings it's 4 Titan alts.
---
 If you want good PVE get a good desktop game.
---
solutions requiring good game design and coding will not happen.  Also, EvE has never had good PVE and didn't need it.
---
You'd be using logistics frigates or cruisers. Alpha (f2p) may not be a good choice to go logi, since many relevant skills are capped at level 3.
---
It will reward player skill, no matter the group size.
---
Good luck roaming empty space mates.
---
I voted with my wallet and unsubbed.
---
I will laugh so hard when it turns out this was a CCP ruse to get the cash out of morons like you.
---
Ummm...the whole put of the thread is I resubbed...
---
&gt; To give an extreme example: *oh yes mr judge at the nuremberg trials. I was a member of the nsdap, but you know, i never really agreed with hitler hating the jews. So you can't really hold me accountable for what happened under nazi rule, right?"
---
Your example is valid, yes. We should judge people not only by their beliefs, but by their actions too. However, it's not really applicable in this case. OP didn't state what his method of playing was, he just stated the fact (that this drifter thing just makes large blocs turtle) - and I think he is right. Hypocrisy is essentially someone's actions being opposite to beliefs and statements, and since there's no stated belief in OP's comment, you can't really accuse him of it. Yeah, I know that I'm debating semantics, but still.
---
Ang even if he *is* a hypocrite, then it doesn't instantly disprove his statement - hypocricy is a person's (negative) quality, not a logical fallacy. Thief can say that stealing is bad, but he still would e right.
---
Sounds like a win-win
---
Gonna be real funny if it don't...
---
Yep.  Over the years I have done most of those different mining setups and they are very different play styles.  
---
I think a lot will depend just how much work you want to do (micromanaging your miners), if you have the Rorqual pilots and hulls already, and how much ISK you want vs risk tolerance.  
---
While a lot of people shy away from having 50++ billion ISK on the field for so much less ISK/hr, in Delve the hulls are pretty safe.  In other, less safe parts of space, that risk assessment would be different.  
---
I think most miners though will look at the ISK/hr, and compare it to what they were making before, be unhappy, and move on.  
---
I have crap tons of ISK, and pretty much all the Titans I want now, so for me mining was just a relaxing way to spend time between fleets.  I will wait for things to calm down and see if the new meta is fun or not.
---
Payout seems tp be a joke unless the loot is worth it.
---
solutions with little in the way of coding changes please.
---
(This has to be repeated over and over.  As a player group we have a lot of talent, but let's use it for ideas CCP can implement without huge programming effort.)
---
Take your squad with you. A half dozen friends who work well together can do quite a bit.
---
Sell the PLEX for ISK and Multi-Character Training
---
Not happening, we have too much fun.
---
Yeah, those pesky things will need to be dealt with
---
double you, lmao get wrecked
---
wot
---
if you want to print isk. thats end game.
---
If you want to play the game. Like i said. Find a Nul-Sec corp(one that you like), have them teach you, make isk hand over fist. example. R64 moons, I can pull in 4-8 bil a day on a pull(depending on the goo) If I want to rat. I can peek 100mil an hour in a VNI
---
Just got to find some people to play the game with that you enjoy being around. A GOOD corp will bend over backwards to make sure you are set-up, and properly taught
---
Sadface because Seddow usually starts forming Goku about the time I have to go to bed. But the man’s become a killing machine.

---
I gave you Kapelle Guys Docking Right to the Tosche Freeports! !!!
---
Thank you for this detailed writeup.
---
They know a lot of their krabs won't undock without SRP, and they need all hands on dick to keep the boat afloat. I'm interested to see what happens going forward
---
They could do that all along, there was no need to unsub in the first place.
---
That just proves that everyone resubbing for this is just trash who can only kill a krab who can't fight back due to mechanics favoring the ganktard. 
---
Well, they should all go in Delve and get educated by supercap umbrella meta. But the trashes won't go there, they'll go for my procurer in -0.1 near lowsec border instead...
---
&gt;NSH is fucking coming bros. 
---
So does this mean that your application to QFC was accepted?
---
Hopefully if enough of you unsub it will make it that much easier to kick your sandcastles over
---
Or you could teach people how to combat probe?
---
I don't really have any vices or habits, EVE is what I do for fun. It sounds like a lot, but $50 a week ain't too bad when you consider it's really the only thing I buy for myself.
---
Okay, there's the gourmet coffees I drink with breakfast, but that's different.
---
Yeah dude totes :)
---
*chuckles in cap umbrella*
---
Odd way of saying huggin
---
There is nothing to solve as there is no problem.
---
Okay lets say all the guys that dont pay attention to intel will still die in masses. I dont know... i dont care about it since i get my money from WH and abyssal space.
---
What about tidi fights?
---
Who’s NSS?
---
... so the change made you pvp more. that's a success in my books. let's hope they don't bring it back.
---
And so they stopped ratting there?
---
Yeah, something tells me there won't be very many people actually unsubbing when saidnand done. I dont see how if they've played the game for this long how this change is going to actually make small masses unsub.
---
Any rough idea of isk per hr including the salvage?
---
it could be a interesting idea but only if CCP change the way people make ISK in Null sec (ratting) actually everyone rat in anom, those anom are unlimited you can farm all day without problem and you can do it "AFK"  
---
if they increase the yield they should make those ISK "limited" (to spread players) just like in a wormhole or change the way people farm = only "active PvE" with "intelligent" NPC incursion/drifter invasion something like that
---

But who cares about lowsec anyways!!
---
We will weaponize pretty much anything. It's how we do things
---
v won't work against cloaky chickens, and even if it helped, hitting v every 4 seconds (pretty much the minimal requirement, full should be 1 second to not miss the moment people cloak) for 100% of time while you are in space is job for a bot, not human player, human is simply physically incapable of doing this, not to mention the "fun" of it.
---
&gt; scouts on gates?
---
What if you live in a system which is not a dead end, and have actual travel? Do you have to go full attention 3600 seconds in an hour to sit there and watch people decloaking to not miss the moment a hostile decloaks and instantly cloaks or instawaprp? 
---
Not to mention you suggest a gate to be watched 23/7 (otherwise cloaky camper gets in unnoticed and everything you have is dropped) by a living player?
---
This change may not affect super ratters under supercap umbrella, but everyone else is 100% completely got treated like a free content served on a platter to every imbecile who went through an incredible effort to train covert cyno and bomber. I will not be anyone's free content for my own money, therefore I cease to pay.
---
Maybe that is CCP's end game, to drain isk from the economy. It would raise plex prices in the short term but if its a serious isk sink then deflation would occur across the entire economy, prices would come down across the board.
---
The market is a barrier to entry imo for some players in the sense that when as you are going through the tutorial or learning things and you pull up, for instance, a large skill injector thinking to help move your character a long and you realize it costs 9 billion with a B, its a bit shocking. When you are just starting out it FEELS impossible to be able to get the amount of money to do some of the really cool things you read about.
---
I know the counter argument is its not actually hard to get a little nest egg to do things but its a perception thing. New players dont know that and it feels like a huge mountain to climb to get a cool ship or weapons or to be able to get enough money to start doing other things like PI or station trading etc.
---
How does that even remotely relate with defending your dreads in your personal farmhole?
---
"Eve is dying" is a traditional meme. The first "Eve is dying" thread was started only 3 days after the games intial release on the official forums.
---
It has become such a tradition that when they closed the old forums and booted up the new ones, immediately a new "Eve is dying" thread was started on them.
---
When was the last time CCP did something good?
---
One of the best things about this change is the choir of retards who announce ro a fleet that “local is spiking” and “local is despiking” without more detail.
---
Hey guys, remember Aurum? Remember how much we HATED the idea of it?
---
That's the ISK side but who's going to drop real money on Plex to get a measly 350m?  What's that going to buy you with more resource scarcity from nullsec?
---
I'm not sure people have thought this through.
---
Thanks for the ELI5, but the market system in eve seems counter-intuitive for me. In GW2 for example, when you are creating a sell order, the price automatically sets to the lowest sell order, and there is an arrow next to the price which lets you undercut or match the lowest order. This way you are spared from actually typing 182.999.989,98.
---
This sounds like something CCP would make, 1 step forward, 100 steps back, I would honestly laugh my ass off when all these cockgobblers praising CCP choke on an official announcement of something like this!
---
You’re a dumb who should stick to jabber if you came to this subreddit looking for common sense, allied, or a meeting of the minds.

Wonderful idea... followd your example and gorged in Plex, the 499 pack... why not... I already have 12 Omega accts in auto pay...   I love this game and I want it to continue growing and being well funded...  And you know the saying... Why the dog licks its ...   Becuase he can!!
---
This proposal is bs and buffs people who do not need to be buffed. Rejected.
---
I have a counter-proposal for you.
---
Make first 5 minutes of the cynosural field a warmup like entosis. During warmup, only ONE ship can jump to it. Once it is warmed up, works like usual.
---
don't worry, CCP will find a way to turn it to shit too. They will either return local to normal after a few weeks of scripted events or introduce ACL-operated Observatories that will allow locals to see local while hostiles will see nothing...
---
Its a video game

Nah just add more blops ships, interceptor / HIC/  maybe interdictor ? (probably not a good idea) not necessarily let them use a covops just take a covops bridge, a way for a covops ship to prevent cyno and more interesting shutdown a cyno  
---

Where's the skill in spamming dscan or investing into a scout alt?
---
It will reward cooperation and sophisticated intel networks, thus pushing people into the big umbrellas.
---
Ok

"leave ~Britney~ goons alone"
---
just adapt

Are...are you trolling? Have you never done blops? COVERT cynos that can't be fitted with a COVERT cloak? It goes so completely against the design that it would be absurd.

&gt; Hopefully if enough of you unsub it will make it that much easier to kick your sandcastles over
---
every sandcastle not under supercap umbrella is already unanchoring every non-essential structure.
---
But you are the fucking hypocrites of a proportion. If you wanted sandcastles kicked over from non-bloc people like me, you could do that without that change, it was always the option. But you are the most risk-averse chickens in eve, you could have pvp all this time, but subbing only when the free helpless krab kills are dangled before you like a carrot. You never had any interest in pvp. You never had any interest in kicking sandcastles over. All you wanted is e-peen of killing ventures (nobody is undocking anything bigger anyway, unless it's rorq under supercap umbrella) without risk, and that's why you resub, chicken ugly risk-averse trashes.
---
Oh I'm gonna laugh so hard when CCP will throw equally tasty shitpie in your face after this...
---
Lol, hardly. Like 10% joins fleets if you look at raw numbers. Seems they are managing fine.
---
The maximum value for a double integer(2\^32) is 4,294,967,295
---
This converts from km to to 28.71 Au. Divide that by 2(to get the radius) and you get 14.355 au
---
What version of Python are they using?
---
I have news for you.. its like 8 years old... but yeah corvetes can light cyno.
---
oh no
---
Owning space comes with certain risks, or rather should have come with certain risks. Those risks were *completely* absent until now, though the benefits are still there. Null is and will remain by far the most profitable space to make money in.
---
Thank you! Wonderful information
---
Damn, go balls deep hoss
---
Wow ... that is something I didn’t expect to see. All the old hands returning.
---
Rip. That sucks :(
---
Better than tengu or proteii online?
---
Being called risk-averse from somebody crying about there being no local...yeah..ok
---
Given your terrible grasp of the English language though, I can see why you're so upset. Gonna fuck up that botting for you, eh comrade?
---
Back for the lockboxes no doubt, for One key (150 plex) you have a chance at obtaining a PREMIUM skin 'valued' 1560 plex, 100.000 SP, Chroma Kit for destroyers (In the destroyer lockbox ofc), 30 days gametime, one of 10 silver tier skins or up to 10,000 GOLD ammo.
---
I don't think that is news for him
---
You do realize some people play this game for fun yes?
---
No, it totally auto-repeats even if there's a cyno inhib up. How dare you spread this misinformation.

I'd give you a gold star, but I gave my last one away to a Drifter.
---
Even a short one like 15 seconds
---
The "land of milk and honey" lasted for a year and half a summer. Geminate is nearly indefensible even with local and no drifters, it's entirely unsustainable under the new conditions.
---
The ping's talk of "boosting our economy" is something beans have heard before. Just know that compared to other major alliance, Horde's industry is crap and it will stay crap under the current leadership.

---
Just copying goons nbd
---
That's a bit misleading saying "Oh we only need 10% of our guys in fleets, so her dee hur hur"
---
They're alts dude. The toons that aren't joining fleets are alts. You can be just fine with participation as long as one of your characters joins fleets. I know how the system works.
---
So you're either being purposefully misleading, or you've had a bit too much of the kool-aid.
---
Jeffraider stream when?

&gt; Rejected.

Rejection rejected: no reason provided.
---
&gt; Won't work with jump bridges...
---
What exactly jump bridges have to do with cynos?
---
Always a first time for everything
---
&gt; What would you think about simply reducing the duration of a cynosural field as well as the fuel cost to light the cyno 
---
You forgot to mention double the weight of fuel.
---
And #2
---
Stop ships that cost less than 500m from lighting cynos to put some risk back in EVE
---
You guys should hit more competent targets instead of the lowest hanging fruit.
---
This is still going to be an issue, but I still see resistance to changing cyno mechanics.  Cynos have been unchanged since the addition of Fatigue, and capitals can take gates now.  I don’t think revisiting cynos and mobile cyno jammers is unreasonable given the radically different environment we play in now.
---
It's not about the ticks (although mine are better, slightly, in havens). It's about the escalations.
---
Cyno needs to be nerfed, not buffed. Nerf corvettes or make cyno not instantaneous
---
As I see, cyno is too ultimate weapon.
---
I suggest it to make it a drop-down structure with battery-powered or remove capacitor transfer (but no more ozone).
---
This will give more time to the reaction of participants in the battle.
---
This will enable combat participants to destroy cyno.
---
This will allow transporting cino on any ships. 
---
p.s. sorry for google translate
---
Yeah I was scratching my head AND beard at that also. 
---
We will function in the same way that is drawing people back to us. We created strong bonds when we old waffles went through, and the newer iteration of waffles has a culture of having a lot of fun with low stress.

Only have 40 minutes to fly spaceships? All gucci.

All we want now is dank frags/fights. Please leave all Strat ops/CTA’s at the door

the fact people like this exist blows my mind

how can you so miss the point of what everyone is talking about
---
Also drifters, but everyone promptly forgot about the drifters when the no-local announcement was made.
---
&gt; Stop ships that cost less than 500m from lighting cynos to put some risk back in EVE
---
hope this is ironic, if not it's dumb
---
 I hear they are living in a C2- NS/C5
---
That's the perfect hole for this new change.
---
good idea ))
---
Only on paper. Habit was the cool guys Retirement Club. They never made it to the top10 active corps on zkb tho.
---
yeah his first paragraph is great, the second one is some sort of \~twist the knife\~ koolaid
---
Divisionism isn't going to help the pvp guy. Who are you going to hunt? Other pvp players who are actively being sneaky? Been getting a lot of action in Jspace? You need people to hunt and scaring them away or goading them into unsubbing isn't conducive to your desired situation.
---
you're dumb
---
Good idea and compromise. Big question though: if local is turned on, should it be available for all people in system or just the once that are on the ACL/blue?
---
Post your hog!
---
JU - Standing was lamenting your ban just now. You are missed.
---
No local is not a problem for fleets.
---
JU  standing was lamenting your loss just now. You are missed.

Feeders never feeders

Because the boring shit is what it works.
---
 I think it's obvious that the social boosters drops the loyalty points course and no needs to explane
---
There are a few bits about the payout that are a little different than you think. For all the sites, there is a total payout 'pool', which gets split evenly across all who participate. For minors this is 80 mil isk and majors its 160 mil. I do not know what it is for the world arc. Basically there is no actual penalty for having too many ships, the total site payout is just spread across more people. 
---
There is also a tactic of bringing whelp alts. You only get in the payout pool if you do damage to a rat, or remote rep or remote cap someone who is shooting the rats. Links, remote sensor boosters, and remote cap transfers do not get you into the payout pool. As such, you can bring whelp alts in ships like the gnosis to provide extra links and give resebos and remote tracking comps to your dps ships. These whelp alts will also never take agro as the rats focus agro by top dps or top rep power, similar to sansha's incursions.
---
&gt; What the fuck do you think Imperium was doing lately? 
---
Shooting a bunch of undefended structures and chestbeating about it on reddit because their blob is too big for anyone with a glint of intelligence to fight them.
---
Actually I disagree, it empowers cloaky camping in certain settings.  No local means you don't know who is there.  You can keep eyes on gates and watch for sigs / wormholes like in jspace now, but if you have a camper he can summon as many dudes as he wants, and you won't know it until they strike.
---
As for the utility of cloaky camping, that depends on how heavily guarded the space is. If scouts aren't out, or are bad, you can just fly in.
---
"Every cubic meter of space not occupied by our ships is filled with cloaky T3Cs."
---
&gt; Gonna fuck up that botting for you, eh comrade?
---
Nah, botters love it, as bots are largely unaffected - they have intel bots with perfect 23/7 attention, they have perfect reaction to dscan, grid, and new signatures.
---
The problem with no local is that every krabbing ship in the game was nerfed and nerfed and nerfed with having that local in mind. Without local, none of the krabbing ships is able to put up a fight (which is exactly why risk-averse trashes are so excited - it's free kills man, gotta chase that carrot!). Those "fights" are not actual pvp, they are pve with a spectator, as whatever you do in a krab ship is largely irrelevant (you can log off to pass on the shitty spectacle but that's about it) given how weak they are for pvp due to poor balance (and no, you can't make them better, attempt to combine pve and pvp in one ship will give a ship that can't do either).
---
Should this change be discussed and balance decisions made to make pve closer to pvp thus giving way for pve ships to engage the ganktards on at least some ground, we'd react less shockingly to this change. However, as it stands now, all other defenses have been already removed, and only 2 left: supercap umbrella and local. You remove the latter from guys who do not have the former, how do you think they would react to this?
---
I never botted myself, never had anything to do with bots, except that one time we found a botter in our alliance back in 2017, killed him, kicked him, and reported him. I don't bot, and the whole reason I'm upset is that bots are much less affected than I am.
---
And a bunch of trash scaredy cat hypocrites are telling me I'm in the wrong here, really trashes?
---
You are clearly unhappy with this game. Just quit. Get this negative nancy shit out of here.
---
There will be of course exceptions to the time in space, but a log out due to inactivey will turn a mountian of data to a hill of data to review. 
---
Remember 90% of bot catchs are found due to algorithms that detect them. Not reports
---
&gt; We are all EVE players,
---
Yeah, well actually I'm better than most of the people you're referring to and what I do in game is higher-tier content and more respectable. Also other people, who are not me are less then me. 
---
What is your solution for people who are just better in life because they're "right" and more intelligent. Like people who live in California and lean left politically, I.E. the area and people responsible for the most reddit traffic.
---
People need to cause a divide, pick a group and spit hatred and vitriol. If racism isn't their outlet they'll find another way to tear other people down and elevate themselves. They're better, their thoughts are better, their people are superior
---
With so much need to make other people in the world feel bad to sustain ones own mental illness, how could anyone get over a  narrative or hate, it's as fun if not FUNNER than racism and fills the void.
---
You are dealing with widespread mental illness, it's an exercise in futility.
---
On reddit, this constitutes "making friends."
---
True to a degree. Moon mining is your friend. With a good hole and good structure management you can mine every day.
---
I was thinking about activating my c2/ns but then i thought I can use thera to take a small multiboxed gang out instead. We shall see how it pans out.
---
Do you have a spare beer i could borrow?
---
This will make things even worse. If a Supercarrier is tackled and lights a cyno at least you know hes trapped there for 10 min. You want to balance cyno...  
---
\- Capitals should not be able to fit a cyno.   
---
\- Cyno should require 70% cap to light  
---
\- Cyno should be a specific module only for 1 ship class  
---
\- Cyno should follow the same grid rules as inhibitor
---
He was saying that he doesn't want corvettes being able to light cynos.
---
Bloodborne is dark souls 3 but more aggressive playstyle based, and the only dlc for it is the best dlc of all the souls games
---
Haha, no, fuck you. Unsubbed 8 accounts, kthxbai.
---
You will always want to choose a target you can burst down before the response fleet comes, unless the target is a known bot. Of course I would fight back but this fight is skewed in your favour, in that unless I am bait you get to choose when to engage/disengage, and there's no dscan that can help to mitigate it.
---
Now, I don't know why you are so intent on calling me names. You know what I said by heart better than I do. But I guess spending more words with you is just a waste of time
---
It will die in less than 14 seconds.
---
You're analysis of gankers in a genearl sense is not correct and you seem to have some deep bias perhaps from previous interactions. I'm not a ganker. In fact I've actually ran with High-sec Militia for a while. You don't even know your're opponent especailly if you think there are no challenges for them to accomplish what they are trying to do. Know their weaknesses in strategy and use it to your advantage. You see patterns of mistakes in their victims and it makes no sense seeing "old bears" make them.
---
My prediction with the umbreallas is that CCP will reduce anom respawn times in such a way that it can't support those who don't want hostile interaction interfering with their null-sec pve.
---
CCP is trying to challenge you by pushing you out of your comfort zone. PvE becomes much more exciting when there is the potential for some PvP to happen. Have you ever ran an escalation in hostile null before? it's quite exciting. Without some PvP danger we might as well just just start doing Alliance Mining Tournaments.
---
Nice data collection, always interesting to see new abyss data.
---
Unless there is only enough made in each region of null to support X systems.
---
What...?
---
Hi Intigo. Only ever flew with you on ganknight where you got ganked before we set off on taranis night. Good times. Lady Spank
---
Oh, one more note. Electric filaments dropped less frequently than other types across all tiers. I assume this is an intentional design choice, although it might just be random.
---
nah we didn't go to a c2 5/null though the main issue was subcap rolling is awful and the lower mass from the null static caused a few headaches. with the changes coming up i reckon groups that are established in lowclass are gonna have a LOT of fun rolling for null content
---
Olmeca, Dont you think this is a well prepared strategy by CCP, that they have explained to the big 3 and all this whimpering and temper tantrums are part of it??
---
Eh, most cyno's are considered dead as soon as they press the button anyway. On the other hand, waiting 10 minutes for nothing to happen is shit gameplay.  
---
Regardless, cynos in general need a much bigger overhaul. Some kind of spool up, or limit on what mass of ships can come through at once based on capacitor or fuel. 
---
IMO If you want to bring a supercap fleet in, you should have to commit more than a frigate to establish a beachhead.
---
I think it's a design choice to encourage buying off of the Market rather than going infinite.
---
waffle scrub haha
---
As if there have never been any groups who lived in NPC null... The point I'm making is if null is opened up you have no idea how it will get used by other groups. 
---
Right now null it's used by power hungry system horders who want more systems with their name on it then they have sense. They don't even use 90% of these system but instead it's just buffer..
---
Maybe CCP doesn't like that and they are using no local &amp; Drifters as a way to force people to give up all that empty space..
---
&gt; If i was ccp i would just spawn "buffed" dirfters that can doomsday stations 
---
CCP fighting your battles for you? There is too much of this sentiment, people who feel bullied, or owned or helpless versus another entity desperately wish the game company would step in and "win" for them. You never fix n+1 in a sandbox, it's one or the other. The game you want is not this niche game.
---
C2/5/null?
---
An anti-cyno black ops / recon ship would be a great addition.
---
Let them pop off a debuf probe which disables cyno fields nearby for ... how long do interdiction probes last nowadays?. Would provide an entire new gameplay element.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Yes its fucking retarded and should be nerfed.
---
We're making Eve great again
---
MEGA
---
Are you fucking serious? I literally said this
---
&gt; I did see EVE in a stagnant spot after the last war
---
And I said in other comments that Goons is winning too much. Stop your projection and actually read my words; also be careful what you are wishing for.
---
What do those changes do? Think of it. Drifters as is right now is not gonna do shit against 1000 titans. They make people turtle deeper into Delve where the supercap umbrella can protect them. Another issue is that large alliances would be less affected by this change as they need less manhours per member to chase off the Drifters. It makes people concentrate, instead of spreading out.
---
Yes, the Drifters are going to damage the MER numbers but they break so many other things while doing so. It only makes Goons win harder by making others lose more.
---
A nerf to supercapitals, resource depletion and some changes to sov/citadels will make a far larger impact in the right direction. You and a lot of the subreddit seems to be desperate for change and is wishing for something that ultimately damage yourself.
---
He's gay?  
---
How utterly aweful for gay people everywhere.
---
For the most part, I agree that PanFam institute the Goon Umbrella model. However, PL and NC. will have to mine and sit on their asses in supers ready to drop. They are just starting out and it will take some getting use to. They have to build up their funds to do any kind of SRP.  Horde will probably adapt to this more quickly. It will work and I hope they can build and become the foes we all wish for. As for the Goon's Theta channel, they are just a huge group of geeks, shooting the shit on coms, ready for something to happen but they're not the only goons ready to drop. There's some big GSF Corps with big stuff. With local going black, watch for baiting and traps in Delve on both sides. Might be FUN times for all especially for the Goons.
---
Are you using Polarized weapons? Those cause ships to have no resists at all
---
&gt; You're analysis of gankers in a genearl sense is not correct and you seem to have some deep bias perhaps from previous interactions. I'm not a ganker. In fact I've actually ran with High-sec Militia for a while. You don't even know your're opponent especailly if you think there are no challenges for them to accomplish what they are trying to do. Know their weaknesses in strategy and use it to your advantage. You see patterns of mistakes in their victims and it makes no sense seeing "old bears" make them.
---
Demagogy won't work on me. First, ganktards stupidity is apparent as even two-step imbecile-proof procedures they managed to fail multiple times, including their "interaction" with me, and the famous goon fail vs Gevlon. Of course I know how they operate, because I tried it, with literally 100% success rate, despite having 0 previous experience at it, just by not being a complete and utter imbecile. I realize from that experience that should they not fail imbecile-proof procedures, they would have 100% success rate despite every reasonable and unreasonable defense measure taken. There are no weaknesses except their own idiotism. There are no "patterns of mistakes", only the lazyness and stupidity of ganktards is preventing every single ship passing Uedama from being ganked, no matter what the pilot does or how he does it. The only winning move is not to play.
---
&gt; My prediction with the umbreallas is that CCP will reduce anom respawn times in such a way that it can't support those who don't want hostile interaction interfering with their null-sec pve.
---
Obviousy YOU don't know how nullsec pve works. This won't do a single thing, except maybe null getting stricter regulation and more people switching to other sources of income, but that's about it.
---
&gt; CCP is trying to challenge you by pushing you out of your comfort zone. 
---
I never had one.
---
&gt;  PvE becomes much more exciting when there is the potential for some PvP to happen.
---
Your English is failing: you spelled "impossible" as "exciting". Don't thank me, just doing my educator job, don't do that mistake at your exams.
---
&gt; Have you ever ran an escalation in hostile null before? it's quite exciting.
---
Yes I did, and it's completely pointless: requires more costly setup, has possibility of loss, and less profitable with every moron trying to distract you from actually doing it. After losing my ship once I will NEVER try it again. Idiots can have that.
---
&gt; Without some PvP danger we might as well just just start doing Alliance Mining Tournaments.
---
Even with local, ganktards were winning by simply stopping all mining. Now, if someone is dumb enough to actually undock a mining vessel, he's just a free target, he's not only losing by not mining, he's losing his mining ship as well, making undocking not an option.
---
Are you fitting Polarized weapons, which remove resists?
---
Thank you for coming to my "I am stupid Thread" i appreciate your attendance.
---
Yep, that was the problem, never used them before and was stupid enough not to read the fine print.
---
Ahh, you mean if you're unsubbed it won't matter. Gotcha. Pesky English and using the proper pronouns is tough I guess. 
---
I'm not sure why you're still here posting. Move along then
---
Yeah, hopefully that gets addressed.
---
Mr. Mittens is right on point...  but I dont buy for a minute that he didnt know about this and that it was done on a whim by CCP...  Mr. Mittens is big in lobbying for the swarm... and I believe this will make the swarm and the other two groups even stronger and more profitable...  UNLESS CCP keeps this up and new opportunities for small groups arise, which I doubt...  Is like in the "real" world...  It all boils down to money... who is making it and who is being slaved to make it...  I believe Mr. Mittens will not care for the loss of a few ships, that basically amount to zero in the swarm ledgers...  And no real structure losses, since CCP only allows the NPCs into scare tactics...  So is all a big hoopla to get us all interested and excited... And is working!!  Mr. Mittens, if you are part of this strategy, I congratulate you!
---
c2+null
---
well iv enot mine for ages and im seeing today that More "npcs" spawn rather then the typical 2-3 but that its not enoght for killing a T2 barge/exhumer not even clsoe to a Orca....
---
I'm saying its not a well thought out plan, not that it wasn't planned. Its going to impact the tilde tilde tilde empire builders tilde tilde tilde the least, and given how they've wanted to move local to some kind of citadel for awhile its going to wind up as another defenders advantage. There is a reason Mittens has been somewhere between pushing for and okay with removing local or moving it to citadels (observatories I think) for a long time. This is going to do the least damage in Kavela Delve Estoria Detroid (or where ever frats in alliance krabs live) and Branch, which are the regions that are the worst for eve.
---
Eve has been pretty shit for a long time, might actually drag my ass out of the closet and away from my boyfriend to resub and shoot some shit.
---
Most of null is dead as fuck, most of low sec is a desert, wh space is empty and hi sec hubs are all dead besides jita.
---
Come on out of the closet
---
Thay's ok, happens. At least you asked before attempting to fly it. A while ago I saw a hilarious killmail, dude had ~1.2b A-type Adaptive invuln, ~300m Damage Control, and all that bling cancelled out by a Polarized rocket launcher :/
---
When you sperg like that about gankers and say stuff like "the only winning move is not to play", it is more gratifying to gankers then the kill mail. 
---
I get it. You play this game and absolutely feel pve and pvp are mutually exclusive. So you sub, log in, and should be entitled to unhindered access to (the best) resources because that's what you like to do.
---
It's not simple for a new player to follow an enemy fleet, he/she needs to keeps distance while guessing at which grid icon they warped to... It can be learned but you don't just get it day 1
---
WHAT
---
WHAT?!??
---
Make it stop all cynos, covert too, so you need to plan a drop and not just send a single ship to shut down the cyno and then proceed to cyno in its own fleet.
---
I resubbed 3 months ago, will continue subbed! Local, no local!
---
Heard there was gonna be a whole lotta killin
---
Glad you figured out it was the polarized that was causing it. Another situation where some resists can drop is in a Wolf-Rayet or Pulsar wormhole
---
People are under the mistake impression that you can’t play eve and compete with players if you’re new.
---
Truth is as a new player you can jump right into pvp. Most corps will take you and teach you how to play - besides what’s it going to hurt? It is free! If you don’t like it just uninstall it!
---
Is this really happening?
---
Do you like waffles? Yes I like waffles.
---
Finally got him in a t5 exotic with an active fit at around 770mil. Not too bad!
---
I am dreaming about Waffles and everyone is back. I am shook af rn.
---
&gt;You're also ignoring the fact that those same roaming gangs hunting ratters now have an increased chance of coming across another roaming gang out doing the same thing
---
This is the biggest thing I'm hoping for -- more combat fleets out and about to fight with. Right now there are basically none except the odd wormhole group.
---
JEFF RAIDERR
---
sounds like learning a skill
---
perfect
---
Welcome back homie I also resubbed for this
---
&gt; it is more gratifying to gankers then the kill mail.
---
And what do you supposed I do? Log in and get ganked, and pretend this is less gratifying? Are you stupid?
---
I cannot fix that, only CCP can. But CCP prefers to gratify the lowest forms of life ganktards are.
---
&gt; You play this game and absolutely feel pve and pvp are mutually exclusive.
---
It is. They require different ships, different skillsets, and most importantly, pvp is utterly boring and devoid of any semblance of fun, making it absolutely incompatible with the rest of the game.
---
&gt; So you sub, log in, and should be entitled to unhindered access to (the best) resources because that's what you like to do.
---
Best resources are in the wormhole space, which you can seal completely and enjoy it with unhindered access. If that's what I wanted, I'd be a wormhole chicken.
---
nice nice ser you in space FAM

be me, wake up, get on comms. drifter hole in staging, get a mjd dessy to help boosh rollers onto the hole. few minutes later phorde gang of about 15 in kikis n shit pops through, they go hunting for easy kills, we start forming some dudes to kill them. we get a cynjo and drop a couple caps to play with the kikis, they run away, we chase, end up on sun grid in staging. phorde fleet apparently decides that it's now time to tackle my titan, starts bubbling me and the couple other caps with me. we blap a few, but they have more. local spikes by 100, they warp to the sun, land in their own bubbles, and my boson. -60+ bombers n shit, the rest kite out of range for a bit, try a few things and take a few more losses, then decide to go home.

titan that got tackled was in the middle of being moved from one of my accounts to another and as such wasn't in corp during all this; queue stress over docking after clearing grid XD
---
GF phorde &lt;3 yall
---
thanks for the 65 killmarks
---
I think the goal CCP is looking for is a way to make null more risky, not less.
---
&gt; put some risk back in EVE
---
That edit came in less than 14 seconds later.
---
There has to be a better use of your time then watching eve reddit this closely live-time. This happens far too often and specifically with you not other users. It's not healthy man. And #2, it's dumb the most powerful mechanic in the game, the Cyno, is available to corvettes. 
---
Actually bad game design. Feel free to post your thesis on why that's not the case.
---
I subbed back up. I'm doing my part!
---
Triglavian invasion ? what is that ? there just drifters
---
Sometimes it's what you have to do. The old C5 highway days are gone and null groups like Goons are so starved for content they have proven they'll bring 3000 dudes in to a wormhole to pop stuff. Low class gives you a bit more safety and you won't have to worry about them bringing freighters of BS in without a massive seeding campaign.
---
if you are anywhere near me, sure. next round is on me
---
:swoon:
---
yeah, my thoughts where adding a "jumps per hour" thing to that. the same info we get on the map but with no delay. rewarding active scouting
---
M8!
---
Depends on loot but 125m an hour or so.
---
There are people who pve successfully with gankers around and I don't mean buying permits. By your logic, it is just not possible or worth the effort. 
---
I wish you best of luck in whatever game you dive into if you don't stick around.
---
So after spending at least 10 hours on these sites you didn't break even on the investment. (-_-)
---
Use dread guristas faction launchers and either T2 or faction drones. That will improve your clear time by a little more. Launchers give more damage, T2/faction drones dont have split damage and hit better with the big EM hole.
---
Loot is definitely the majority of 'payout' from these sites. For minor conduits, assuming you don't get vulture'd by a roaming destroyer or something, I'd say salvage and loot together tend to be 2-4 times the raw payout. Most of that variation is in whether Zorya's drops a decent mutaplasmid.
---
Come at the bro.
---
It'll help establish you have balls if you actually told us which corp you're a part of. Maybe we'll come visit your bait ratters.
---
Wingspan is good at finding homes. :)
---
Is this the real life
---
I got an alpha logi alt. I basically maxed alpha skills for tanking type of choice (rep skill is in there as well) and engineering, then got the two frigate and cruisers that rep that (Amarr/gallente armor caldari/minmatar shield) up to 4. After that I started quality of life things like jump clone 1 and agility, speed. once that was done I added a little ewar because I wanted to do more than just logi.
---
I spent 1.7bil on my Gila with no implants and do just fine in tier 5exotics. Why the heck is everyone spending 7bil on theirs you ask? For 100dps difference. That's why.
---
Aurum was awesome. they gave some as an introductory offer to several of my trial accounts. i never touched it and years later when they converted it all over to PLEX I ended up with about 6B ISK from it.
---
More mistakes means more opportunities to score.
---
When first listing an item it will pull the highest buy order to start with, even if you are listing for 3 months. It's up to you to decide on the price you want to list it for. In my mission hub I don't set it for the lowest price in the region, I set it for the prices around my area and I still get a lot of transactions
---
knowing the history of r/eve, people would bitch about this as well. ANYTHING that null uses to be efficient, people will bitch out. You should notice this pattern. 
---
Remember when people complained about null? We got fozzie sov, remember when people said they want a bigger mining vessel? Rorq was changed. Remember when people said rorq is too strong? Rorqual was nerfed SEVERAL times after that. Now people want the rorqual to be deleted. Now people want capitals to be worthless, what will be next? Delete null?
---
It's pathetic, isn't it?
---
* CCP adds infrastructure hubs (buff to krabs) - "just adapt."
---
* CCP adds jump fatigue (nerf to nomadic groups) - "just adapt."
---
* CCP turns Rorqs into mining ships (buff to krabs) - "just adapt."
---
* CCP makes moon mining active (direct nerf to nomadic playstyle) - "just adapt."
---
The first time **one** change goes against the krabs, they're throwing a tantrum about it and threatening to unsub. Maybe it's your turn to adapt.
---
That's a lot of dosh
---
Medium Shield Booster...
---
Gotta be everyone. You can't have all the benefits without the downsides.
---
Imagine having spod brains having no clue whats around them, they would have died anyway, even with local as you pointed out. I'm not sure how the stupid would adapt to ANY meta in eve.
---
Who gave automod gold
---
Just saying, Hictors could easily be modified to be anti-cyno bubbles, or have new scripts that can jam out an active cyno...
---
\#makehicsOPagain
---
Wrangler on your booty?
---
Do not forget Navy Battleship rebalance, it was promised like year before Jam get changed!
---
&gt; There are people who pve successfully with gankers around and I don't mean buying permits. By your logic, it is just not possible or worth the effort.
---
Oh yeah, I remember ganktards crying about Skiffs, and laughed my ass out. Using Skiffs instead of an exhumer that doesn't actually suck at mining is a definition of getting ganked by yourself. You lose so much you're basically self-ganking for a Covetor every few hours. And then comes you and calls this "success". Well, congrats, you ganked yourself instead of being ganked by other morons, moron, total and utter success, yay.
---
Failure is not success. Self-gank is not gank defense. Get educated.
---
&gt; I wish you best of luck in whatever game you dive into if you don't stick around.
---
Honestly if other games didn't betray me on a regular basis, I won't be coming back to eve after 6-11 months absence every time. 
---
But I'll be around monitoring for ganktard tears. Don't wanna miss the moment CCP realizes they hit krabs too hard and backpedals as usual.
---
Literally the only people lighting cynos on corvettes are people moving ships passively.  All eliminating corvette cyno's does is annoy JF pilots.
---
I genuinely hope this will be the case, but I feel like anyone even remotely concerned about their space being taken or the isk war being lost is going to turtle as hard as possible.
---
Thanks for the answer, appreciate the effort on the intel gathering.
---
CCP have been pretty clear this is a test run, and they're gonna judge how it works out to see if they should keep doing it.
---
Definitely! Wh - safest space, take your multi-bill fit Marauders and other ships and move in. Totally safe!
---
Of fuck please do. Lol you have 0 chance.
---
Ok I'll pass this on.
---
for now
---
Who do you think would be more likely to take an uncertain few vs many engagement, the leet feathering crew or junior FC's first Caracal gang?
---
Most pvpers have a, not necessarily deserved or accurate, self image as being better than the other guy which does in fact lead to a more aggressive behaviour.
---
So what I gathered from your horrible run-on-sentence is that it's okay to have big null bloc people maintain all the power with no chance of new groups getting a chance to fight because eve is supposed to be hard?
---
Exactly. And what is the risk of dying while you do it?
---
What is a kiki?  I've been distant from game news for awhile.
---
Because it's the least likely model to result in a decent fight.
---
Like /u/QueenElizibeth says, it's a joke about how nobody still really knows why the sov in B-R5RB dropped (CCP says a player fucked up, the player says CCP fucked up, etc). 
---
The original question about 425m was a Pearl Abyss thing but that didn't seem as funny to me.
---
I doubt the black-out will last forever, they'll probably mitigate it somehow with a new structure.
---
Eh, I consider it dangerous because you're surrounded by people you are not your allies at all times.
---
imagine going in for a person attack that deep after being called "dumb"
---
Often times when following a fleet they are leaving the system about a 2nd or 2 after you land in the system giving you a chance to react and make an educated guess on where they are heading so you can keep up the chase. Dscan isnt going to help here and probes most certainly arent.
---
Mhm
---
CCPLS save POS shields in some way.  They're so nice.
---
there are no conclusive patchnotes about drifter rats released by CCP- finding accurate information about them will be hard.
---
Sounds like you were in a Trig invasion system
---
How would this promote independence?  Whats to stop one man corp spam to get all the communications hubs.  Then put all your alliance members in to a massive corp so they can all have Asset Safety.
---
then my npc alts can bring a few supers as well.
---
im starting to think that was a Mistake Reactivating my Minign Account =p instead of Giving me additional ISK i think im gonna lose ISK...
---
I gave it an updoot regardless
---
Trig invasion.
---
Fit?
---
Deep? Alright globby you're having a go.
---
Globby why don't you compare your reddit stats with the average user. You are the top 1% of top 1% of addicts. This was a poor attempt to refute that.
---
So you can't be nice?
---
Nah.  The sub-count has definitely declined the past few years, but its still plenty active.
---
what's the difference
---
nah... No invasion/incursion just normal Gursitas
---
and it alredy happen 2 times today
---
no mate, Gursitas..... "normal" rats...
---
Not going to damage me in any way. I've adapted. Try it.

yes hello, i reddit post

See, here’s the thing: it all works by quantum-entanglement principles, so you don’t *need* to route consciousness transfers through the routers- just directly connect your ship and your clone bay, for fuck’s sake.
---
Make it consume Plex then be attackable and have it drop remaining Plex.
---
Thank you for the heads up, i will look out for that in the future.
---
That hurts me down deep.
---
Why are you so toxic??? I am disappointed in TEST for allowing someone like this to join
---
You are undoubtedly correct that the majority of players in goons do not share the over-exaggerated attitudes that are being complained about. However, I think there is a nuance to the issue that you're missing.
---
Most of the public-facing statements that broadly shape opinion about goons come from your leadership. It is indeed a mistake to generalize from those statements and assert that all goons share the exact same set of beliefs - a very understandable, human mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. However, whether or not you *share* the beliefs and attitudes of your leadership, being a member of the goon organization still constitutes a tacit endorsement of those beliefs and attitudes. You're part of supporting those leaders and providing a platform for them, so ultimately, whether you share their personal beliefs or not, your actions are advancing those beliefs and so you bear a degree of responsibility for their actions.
---
And I'm sorry to say it, but while you're likely correct that the majority of goons are not accurately described by the complaints above, your leadership sure as fuck sounds like it. Mittens is the poster child (emphasis on 'child') for the whiny manbaby complaining how the mean devs are out to get him by attacking his space guild whenever they change anything, and your leadership sure sounds like crybabies lashing out at hisec in a petulant attempt to 'hurt ccp' over nerfs to their playstyle (and note mittens tried to do this during WWB too). Expecting the disgust with their attitudes to not spill over onto the people supporting them is like standing on the shore railing at the tide for coming in. Human nature doesn't work that way.
---
Things that make me smile for $1000
---
Hrmm why is the titan pilot not in brave any longer?
---
Do you have a post for T4's?
---
Yeah, but considering the volume of sales, those mutas might as well be worthless.
---
Did the rats have diamonds next to their names?  If so it means there is a FOB (Forward Operating Base) in the system and upgraded rats are roaming while their miners are taking down the belts.  Go to the Agency window (Click on the E at the top of the menu bar, Activities, The Agency).  Click on Encounters, Pirate Strongholds and if your system is listed, go mine somewhere else...
---
Yess they had a "diamond" and Yess you are right theres a "stronghodl here" and in another system close... Thnx for the tip kind Sir!
---
Payout is a total joke and no one should do these ever. You will definitely spend more money on ammo than you will make, even if you use free crystals found in belts.
---
Totally, 100% not worth it. 
---
Im super cereal.
---
see my comment above, i was transferring the pilot to another account of mine and it's currently waiting on the timer from the wardec to rejoin corp.
---
The ishtar. Like why is this a discussion? It is practically the same thing as a the vni just better in every way.
---
People are under the mistaken impression you can play eve.
---
Eve is not just a game. Eve is the last game. Eve is the only hobby you will ever need.
---
You maybe drunk. But I am potted out.
---
#make_bounties_count_again
---
No, but when I was running them my isk/hour was 100-120 million.
---
yhea i Didnt knew about the "diamond" rats.... thnx....  
---
im actualy gald about the "nul sec changes" thats why i Reactivated my aconts =P
---
I'm sorry that you are upset. Just hoping to illuminate that removing local isn't a magic trick that just tips the actual fighting in favour of the hunter.  
---
It should increase the frequency of ratters getting caught though, and if you die to that it is just as random as if you got caught because you were afk'ing in a haven with your vni.
---
100 extra dps is a significant amount
---
Nope, lol. I've at least doubled my initial investment on this fit however, just didn't decide to track isk/hour until this run of 50.
---
Friendly reminder you break even on a C5 capital after 4 sites. Or 2-3hrs.
---
I’m a Gallente nerd, so based on my biases, Lachesis Online

Everyones fucking losing their shit and it’s like just another Sunday here.
---
Good to see you back in the game man.
---
Just wanna say thanks, you're the reason I'm still playing, gave me the push to leave High-Sec after running into you in Null somewhere.
---
Who'd have thought that an excited Eve post six years agp could have lead to BNI as it is today haha.
---
Maybe the TCU's current functionality could be placed in the IHub with this new "communications" thingy... never really understood why TCU and IHub are different things.
---
Yes that is what I meant. I am so sure this will be what happens. You have intel of friendlies but not foes
---
&gt;Back 
---
For me, it's investment security, mostly. This fit will tank everything pretty easily. I'd have to really fuck up in order to lose this setup. The only real threats are 4+ starving leshaks,  getting caught by webs and 5+ grips, or heavy neuts inside a red cloud.
---
You're not really being honest with yourself if you're trying to equate your use with the average user or even community member here. There is no citation needed, people have eyes.
---
As far as reiterating something about a lie, dwelling on whatever that is supposed to be or represent - maybe that's a symptom of this over-use. Consider that. 
---
I wrote something, it was pretty dumbly worded as most shit I write is. I edited what I wrote, twice. You came up with a story instead of choosing to engage in a discussion because it's stupid for corvettes to have cynos and there is no real retort.
---
Instead of random shit feel free to talk about cynos. I'll match you, maybe you'll lose on the internet but it will be more productive
---
I'm skeptical about this Nyth guy you mentioned. Sounds like a sketchy dude ngl
---
Mhn use to love doing Abyss spent a solid two months at it when I first came back to EvE but then lost my Ship and Implants to a badly timed client crash.
---
My other account was still running fine, though I made a profit on investment replacing the ship and implants made it barely worth doing.
---
So I moved on to something else, shame as it was fun to do.
---
sure. As long as local is gone and no one *has* to know you are there getting it, I am fine with that.
---
When deer hunting you can't expect to let the deer know you are there, when you are there *and* expect the hunter to be able to get a kill.
---
Except that it was originally intended for golden ammo.
---
Ehhhhhhhh, like 60/40.

Calling others homosexual as a pejorative is just sad, ugly and pathetic. It reflects op's issues with his own sexuality more than anything else.

---
Not upvoted for quite some misleading flaws.
---
1. From my experience the roaming fleets don't warp to sealed conduit. They do, however, warp to Rerouted World Ark. Unless CCP have secretly changed it in the past week.
---
2. World Ark Proving Ground used to show as a combat site and had suggested optimal fleet size 7 \~ 10 however got bugged out in later patches. They show as combat site or not does not depend on if it has been visited. This can be easily verified with DSCAN.
---
3. From my observation the reinforcing roaming fleet seem to be generated out of thin ether instead of other fleets in system warping in. I might be wrong on this since most systems are underfarmed making tracking all roaming fleet movement next to impossible.
---
BTW has anyone tried to entosis the monitors around world ark?
---
&gt; 1 that is not what I said 2 my fax/ prober are usually in the same fleet 3 you missed half of them are centers 4 stop reading into things,i said exactly what I said but apparantly english is hard for you. 
---
I'm the one that needs to have my grammar critiqued? 
---
What you said was pretty fucking clear. Don't try to mince words with me, you apparently have enough trouble constructing coherent statements as is
---
&gt;Again
---
I'll agree with you that the pirate factions should recognize their own.
---
I've always subbed five accounts until a couple of months ago. I just can't afford to pay so much usd with my country exchange rate, usd went up a lot to us... So... Until there's a new nice discount sub, like those six months or for a year, I won't do it. CCP, please bring those nice discounts back.
---

---
If you aren't rolling holes while ratting because you're so ballsy then how come you won't even tell me your corp name?

It sounds like your full of shit

Fuckni get strong and be a strong enemy to the Imeprium. EVE NEEDS it so MUCH!
---
Making jokes about people being gay is juvenile and unpleasant. There are plenty of things you could mock without needing to go there.
---
When posted in Jita, I don't tend to have that many problems getting rid of mutaplasmids. Some of the worse, low-value ones can linger around for a while, but they're also not what's boosting your payout anyway.
---
Top 10 in zkb. Wow! Sort of impressed. Well, not really
---
What do you mean we have to farm outside of our hole too?
---
ye, prolly the game then, EVE at max settings does consume a lotta resources. They need to stop complaining imho, its still a really good video
---
Maybe we should tell them to adapt...

As stated in the OP it is now harder to scout. If something is harder to do that means it takes more skill to accomplish it. And there is your "where's the skill". If you fly that scout alt well and find correct intel, then you get the benefit from that. You don't get it automatically just from being in the system. Is this clear enough for you as a distinction or are you not understanding on purpose?...
---
Sounds like the beard game is strong! Nonetheless I'm glad you all are thriving and your culture is going strong. Eve is best when people like you all are flying around. Content is life!
---
&lt;10 is also available on iTunes, Spotify and google podcasts. Get it get it
---
I never said it was a utopia. Don't put words in my mouth. It was a thought experiment, nothing more.
---
Sorry to say that it's not like we are here to impress you bro
---
So it costs 100m for each freighter you want to prevent from undocking then, and after a week or so you'll have permacrippled highsec logistics
---
I was kinda dissatisfied how many people here "were" arguing about that you should already know the fit, and you should ask your alliance etc. etc, then they started to make "joke" fits, just to f\*ck with you I guess, or mock you... I understand the feeling when you try to get other people's ideas, and to actually try something new, and to see how other people have approached the fitting issue, and I did not like the way, that this thread went unanswered... EVE community can be helpful, also it can be very much "cancerous" towards someone who just want to know information... Have a great day and fly safe o7
---
/shrug/ 
---
We can agree to disagree; my hypothetical scenario won't happen anyways nor do I even want it to. A *balance* between PLEX and subs is probably more desirable, but I still stand by my view of why I proudly sub instead of PLEX: If I have the out of game funds to sub, I might as well do so rather than have my Omega time depend on someone else.
---
The market system in eve is mechanically the same as the stock market
---
There is a stated belief in both OPs:
---
&gt;Maybe this event will eventually have some good long term outcomes for the staleness of the game as it is currently. Lord knows null could use a good shake up
---
&gt;This game's best moments always come from PvP and I fail to see how this will lead to more PvP conflicts.
---
I didn't adress the points being made about null-entities reacting to the coming changes, i merely commented on the fact that if they actually wanted to be less bored/have more fun pvp they shouldn't live with the coalition in the game that has the most members and an extensive blue list.  
---
So in my eyes we have action &amp; belief, and therefor imo hypocritical behaviour.  
---
Am i being 100% objective and balanced in my assessment? Fuck no, i mean i wanna push my agenda too.
---
I think at the end of the day you are raising a valid point. If i had truely cared to have a proper discussion with  them i wouldn't have opened up with the attack that i used, but i would have tried to actually understand their position more.  
---
But that just wouldn't be as much fun as sperging out on this sub, would it now, heh.
---
Do you have a fit that's not so expensive for running them?
---
Thats dope aa fuck. And your welcome thanks for coming
---
Circumstantial indeed, but not irrelevant. Welcome home.

that’s not me I speak for small groups and small gang content that’s where my experience lies.

you don’t don’t have to be big group to be good plenty of good Corps or alliances over the years that aren’t big, hydra, tuskers skill U didn’t start off big and punched way above there weight

okay fuckhead, ill explain it further, since you think you somehow have it all figured out.
---
PLEX, has a mostly FIXED price. We will use US dollars, for simplicity. but the prices is Set by CCP for each country.
---
So from this we can conclude that PLEX, has a real world monetary value. 
---
Now, RMT sellers, sell plex for less than half the price set by CCP.
---
This is why one would RMT, otherwise whats the fucking point.....
---
SOO
---
you are now buying PLEX for half its value, and you are injecting said PLEX in our our wonderful little sandbox. THIS IS NOT FUCKING COOL.
---
You are fucking with the supply and demand of PLEX, because you now have 2x as much plex as you would have, if you had purchased from CCP.
---
You are FUCKING OUR SUPPLY. 
---
This Cheap PLEX is now injected into our economy. Because there is soo much more of it it is now ALSO FUCKING WITH THE DEMAND, WICH IN TURN FUCKS THE PRICE OF PLEX IN ISK. This Then LOWERS THE VALUE of ISK VS US Dollars.
---
AT the end of the day, when I want to buy PLEX from CCP its now worth less for me, because YOU ARE A FUCKHEAD.
---
ALSO YOUR ISK IS NOW WORTH LESS BECAUSE YOU PRINTED ISK AT HALF PRICE AND DUMPED IT INTO THE ECONOMY.
---
i like these movies a lot to get an idea of how the other side plays and decisions taken etc, but you cut away so much this time.

&gt;It's extremely easy. We literally haven't been ganked by any party who came through a sig in there current system. We've been ganked by people whose sig appeared in our own home who than jumped in to our static, but that's because our corp mate wasn't watching all the holes.
---
I agree. Having lived out in one for a month or so, C2s with HS statics really are super easy to live in.
---
so, you're saying that if I remove a salvager for a remote rep on a ninja alve catalyst, and randomly rep a dps, I get in the paying at the end ? Or do I have to be in the fleet for that ?
---
That's a lot of text to write just for me to say how about no.

I don't think he's talking about farm holes.
---
who even are you, im reporting u for having penis in ur name and i think ull find it's agaisnt tos of reddit you stupid retard

That's a unique scenario. When your attacker brings more pilots than live in all of high class space, your capital advantage doesn't matter.
---
But in normal WH life, it matters a lot.

warp in was bad....yeah

You are doing God’s work, but it will never end.

I've only seen a couple of people refer to us as NSS. You still shit talking while refusing to untether?

sure i do.  there are only so many things you can do in null.  rat, mine, indy, pi.  all these things are readily available to any group that wants to do it now.  just a hell of a lot safer.  Do you think there is are large groups of pilots just itching to get out to null, but think that it is too safe right now?  and are waiting until it becomes a joke to do anything other than bot if you don't have an umbrella?
---
The kind that forgot to use the radius, most likely.
---
I also plan to resub my two accounts as soon as I come back home from holidays. These changes are awesome.
---
Yes the gang is getting back together
---
Good save man!
---
If I had the disposable income I would.
---
happy flying o7
---
Started this past week and loving to so far. Knowing myself, I'll probably end up making a few alts. (And given the way skills train in this game I figured I would start early.)
---
However, after doing some googling I am a little confused if I need to create separate accounts for each alt, to train them at the same time.
---
I purchased an omega for my main, but don't think I'll do that for multiple accounts (at least not right now). So was wondering what everyone's thoughts are. 
---
Should I just create alts on one account or create separate accounts for each alt?
---
So did you ever get those "bugged" site spawns where like 20 battle-ships are at near 0m range and you have to burn out like 100KM? If you have gotten that, does this fit tank through all that damage?
---
\**local intensifies*\*
---
Oh boi... You have no idea who else is flying with them LOL
---
This argument gets repeated every so often when any change that could potentially have negative effect on large scale pve comes up. And this argument is generally wrong - because pve will still go on, ships will still be built, but some things will change on the way. If pve becomes more dangerous, then people capable of staying safe while using expensive, efficient ships will have upper hand over those getting farmed for kills; with ISK being harder to come by getting into expensive stuff for pvp will give you a bit more advantage (assuming you're able to not die too often - again, promoting skillful play); and just grinding your way up without caring about how well you can do it will get much, much harder. So yes, hit to pve will mess with pvp, but I wouldn't call it bad thing - and there will always be people who are greedy, overconfident or just reckless for you to hunt down and loot (and then said loot will be worth even more in terms of time spent earning).
---
This serves as a response to basically every single person bitching about the local changes.
---
Fuck yeah, i know a LOT of old time PVPers that are coming back to the game because of the changes.
---
DOWN WITH THE NULLBLOCS
---
Only a person who never learned to use d-scan would simplify d-scanning as just "spamming".
---
a) takes skill to pin point someone's location.  just throwing dscan on 360^o and seeing someone isn't enough
---
b) if you are in their d-scan range, then they are in your d-scan range.
---
I can understand these points! 
---
Adding all of it, or even just partially, would have made the video quite long with a lot of cuts. 
---
I personally do not like watching dudes travel for a couple of minutes, even if hostile comms are interesting. That's why alot of the actual brawl has been cut away. Aswell as the traveling at the start and at the end.
---
If my footage allows it to get a nice and crisp 10 - 20 minute video out of it, I will gladly take the opportunity, but in most cases fights in Eve are either really short or they escalate into 1+ hour operations.
---
Yep, as much as I hate to say it, sov needs adjusting to make dropping multiple caps on small roaming fleets more difficult, dunno how that would work. Their is a difference between dropping caps on a threat to sov and on a group of guys just coming for a fun roam.
---
Do you have the fitting to squeeze in a tractor beam? Just for a little time saving.
---
World Arks Payout is maximized at 10 people, not 15. But ever since the most recent changes that number is definetly not enough to run them effectively. The additional spawns don't produce any wrecks. So you get roughly 200 ships more over the entire site and no reward for it. 
---
Additionally the Roaming Fleets can also decide to warp into an active Ark and get on your nerves. If this happens while the additional spawns are on grid. You better hope if that happens your logi won't be targeted.
---
pretty accurate :P
---
not necessarily. And either way, that's sunken cost. Not new profit for CCP.
---
Roaming Fleets warp to ALL Invasion related Sites.
---
I have personally witnessed these fleets warping into Minors (both active and sealed) as well as the World Ark (both active and routed).
---
In Majors we had many cases of these fleets warping on top of us shortly after completion. As well as someone on the forums confirming having a fleet warp into their site before triggering the final spawn.
---
The roaming fleets are as the name implies roaming around. It is advised to get rid of the big roaming fleet before doing any sites. An additional 8 Battleships while fighting a big wave already can be very very painful. Especially since they have multiple Anchoring ships with them most of the time.
---
worse. he's in BOVRIL.   
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/95456472/
---
On the other hand, amount of isk/resources per system (so, for a group) is much more limited compared to full region of infinitely respawning anomalies, so if you want to earn enough, you're taking away from your corp/alliance friends. This makes w-space iskmaking balance out a bit.
---
tldr
---
I was just looking to see if a new episode was out. Can’t wait to listen.
---
Lol.  
---
I expect the real reason comes back to what another person said.  Eve works best when you really really dislike another group. 
---
Sadly, all the big NS groups are positioning themselves on the opposite sides of the board to either rebuild, or like the Goons, continue to grow.  Truth be told, it’s hard for me to dislike most of the other NS players, as we all are in the same boat.  
---
High Sec looks to be a very easy place to dislike.   I am compelled by the narrative of ‘HS against NS” because, well, it’s actually pretty funny and I don’t have any other people i dislike more at the moment. If I get ambivalent about my dislike, all I have to do is pull up r/eve and it’s all fresh and new again. :-) 
---
grr HS
---
It depends, the initial jostle of resubs/unsubs is far less important than long-term customer acquisition/retention. The state Eve is in right now does not promote a healthy game (which means losing subs over the long term) and CCP knows this.
---
Globby, when your retort boils down to "prove it", "I'm not addicted, you have no proof" -
---
Dog, people see you respond, and live on reddit. That's something people can easily observe. 
---
People know of you that which you wish to hide. That's unfortunate but it would be healthy if you woke up to reality and owned who you are, what you are instead of being ashamed. Maybe Jordan Peterson's work could help you out.
---
Again if you prefer to talk about cynos as opposed to your problem, feel free to write about that and it can be debunked or disproved or otherwise discussed to fruition if possible. If that discussion is even possible at this point. Your retort offered no substance and I went with whatever is readily available and known which is your use history.
---
As far as buttmad, I would think concern is a more appropriate word. I'm a seasonal reddit user and I notice this trend with you, your history, you get lost in reddit, you go deep. 
---
You said my suggestion was dumb, you were met with the only substance you offered, which is your history. You didn't want to discuss that. Next time maybe you'll post something of substance. 
---
If you don't like who you are, change it.
---
ok this is a dream
---
Of course there's a lot of opsec stuff from comms being filtered out but perhaps I'm the oddball that likes to see all the action part and not just the trailer sections ;) 
---
I just felt that in this one a lot was actually missing (as seen from being on the opposite side of things) since you kept going on grid for much longer and also dodged a few bosons in system :)
---
&gt; What exactly jump bridges have to do with cynos?
---
Titans and blops can open bridge to cyno in fleet.
---
Get memed on! I hope someone was recording.
---
&gt; So show CCP if you approve of the changes to make space more dangerous and vote with your wallet. 
---
Not until they do something about capital proliferation and citadels.
---
Ah yes 8 people talking over each other.
---
However, PL and NC. will have to mine and sit on their asses in supers ready to drop.
---
#Horde has no caps. Am i right 😜
---
Let me know when nickfuzzeh is back
---
I've mined over 1mil m3 of ores from those sealed conduit and only local pirates would warp in. When have you been observing they successfully warping into a sealed conduit? It may be a bug or unannounced change.
---
Warping in shortly after completion may just because of delayed site update.
---
Seems just need more investigation about how roaming fleet works.
---
No.

Shut up stinky spodbrain, bee man bad.
---
Well, the value you see for distance using D-scan is the radius. Your ships is at the center of an orb. The maximum value we are talking about reflects the diameter of the orb
---
New rules for tke, if it moves the hammer gets dropped. Also as long as spod leader is watching intel he should be able get most of this stuff off before bubbles go up. Drones might be harder to save.
---
If it makes you feel any better I am an equal opportunity exploder.
---
Deflection hasn't done you any favors either.
---
There are already 250 man stuka fleets running around, deleting normal caps. What you're proposing is a ship of similar size, but able to delete super caps and titans?
---
I don't want to at the moment. I don't have time from my RL responsibilities.
---
eve
---
Get out
---
Changes last update, there boosts are godly but only effect subcaps. Your second pilot is better in a hulk but it adds more apm.
---
Pod was worth it
---
what exactly am i deflecting? that i post on reddit?
---
you just say things in relativistic terms and when you say something concrete and i ask for evidence you pretend like i never did.
---
am i on reddit too much? who is to say? who even cares? why do you care? i do it for entertainment.
---
am i on reddit more than the top 1% of redditors? pretty untrue. does me instantly responding to your post constitute being on it constantly? no, because I just so happened to see it in the one refresh of the page I had.
---
Is your blatant gaslighting a symptom of many mental illnesses? yes. is your constant mentioning of other peoples' mentall illnesses projection? probably. is your explosion at a small comment you yourself admitted was dumb to a deep personal attack autism? probably
---
A sunk cost fallacy has to deal with being so invested in something you argue for it even though it's a bad idea because you're already so invested. If you're not subscribed and you resubscribe, I fail to see how that is a sunk cost. 
---
Maybe you don't understand the meaning?
---
How about an "I win" button
---
Hes staying with me ;)
---
Pretty much. Maybe not single handedly. But yea.
---
Not exactly bombs don't kill everything. Just large targets it's intended for.
---
The loot you take from your kills is free?
---
I've been running these sites enough to tell you that this is no bug. CCP has been making adjustments to these sites all the time. Them warping into sealed conduits is apparently already happening since they first introduced them, but I never stayed around so I can not verfify this claim.
---
But for at least the last 2 weeks they have been doing this as we have observed this multiple times. Consider yourself lucky to not have encountered them yet. Then again they warp in at 0 on the beacon. So unless you are afk you should be safe. Just keep in mind that the reinforcement wave will always warp on top of the first fleet. Not to the beacon.
---
So a 50-60b titan being killed by a 250 man fleet of.. frigates? Hahaha someone is salty.
---
HOLY SHIT!

Is this the real Jeffery R. Aider??

---
No, I understand the meaning. I'm just reading between the lines and seeing yet another person drop huge amounts of money on a game with a model that is exploits human psychology. Get that Plex though!
---
so much homo phobe
---
Thanks for keeping up, I was gone for about 3 months then got talked into a wormhole about January, since then I've: Formed a corp, watched the euros and ustz eat each other and split in half, taken that UStz and formed a SECOND corp (all living out of a wormhole) and finally hooked up with Waffles merging my corp into Waffles under Reza's command.
---
I also still am waiting for Pearl Abyss to shit the bed here in this game (skill points for sale for cash anyone?) and I cackle wildly at all the people freaking out at the changes being made screaming about "THEY'RE KILLING THE GAME", cause lol, I'm just a necrophiliac poking this corpse over here.
---
&gt; Titans and blops can open bridge to cyno in fleet.
---
So what? It's still a jump to cyno. Maybe tweak it for subcaps, but leave at one or maybe few caps before warmup, so that you can't be dropped by everybody and his dog instantly.
---
Where will I get my comedic relief then?
---
lets see how long it lasts as twitch has been banning afk streams regularly
---
Yup so I just don’t get the peeps bashing so hard on the pve aspect I love both pve and pvp and need them both to play eve effectively imo.
---
Lmbo
---
What? How does proposing a way to deal with caps and titans in a way that can't be used to blast the rest of a fleet salty? I'm advocating for titan destruction....that's not salt.
---
I hope the strong reaction to the direct p2 get skillpoints made them reconsider this behavior.
---
nice meme
---
Never under estimate people wanting their own base... if it were more accessible people would do it. I'm saying you ate looking at null only from the perspective of crab empires.. but maybe other gameplay develops if more have access
---
You are absolutely right about this but personally I don't have much problem about removing local or other restrictions. At least not as much as the endless Drifter fleets and the raging Goon hate in this sub. 
---
People keep shitting on Goons for being caught by Drifters and us not liking them --- but since when making space more difficult to defend will cause people to spread out? Not to mention fighting an endless horde of NPC's divide our attention from fighting other players. At least the removal of local or some other implementation (for example, local becomes a structure that can be blown up) introduces interesting PvP interactions. Drifters as is don't. They also just hold us in limbo waiting for CCP's next steps, essentially preventing any alliances to launch offensives. How is that fun and good for the game?
---
But it's glaring how many times I tried to explain this and got downvoted to oblivion because of my flair. I got reminded I don't have to play this game, so I will just unsub until it interests me and the sub calms down again.
---
If that happened there would be no traffic on Reddit.
---
It's worth checking out for sure, whether you stay and subscribe or not only you can tell.

Neh it's multitasking all the moons in the system.
---
You are wrong about one thing.     
---
Observatory arrays utilize ACL and by ACL you define who see or not the local }:&gt;
---
Fun fact, it takes like 4 hours to break even on 3 nags in C5 sites
---
I think you are wrong. There will be an increase in mining since ships will be produced locally . Especially the T2 stuff. It as well give more content for the super umbrella. A big chunk got glassed and then the drifters came. No offense. But their still needs prep work for the next wave of drifter s.
---
Ummm.. sure thing man
---
Because you don't need to commit much in terms of isk to kill something that will be worth 3-4 times your fleets worth. So no.
---
Renting will stop once renting is no longer seen as a good deal.
---
It would stupidly retarded.
---
It's not the absolutely worst idea I've ever heard, but that's mostly because Stain Guy exists.
---
This has been my idea for a bit:
---
Once an inhib is online either:
---
* Disable current cyno but keep self tackle, or
---
* All ships jumping to a cyno with an inhib on grid go to sun instead.
---
I kinda like the second option better because it has more impact in null rather than low due to bubbles.
---
You wrote this mess but it still relies on people simply not being aware of your posting habits or usage. You're not going to find a mod in our subreddit who isn't aware of your activity or usage history. People who elect to comb through this trashfire each day for the community.
---
You asked maybe three times for me to doxx you, I don't know if this is a tactic, or just under-thought. 
---
In regards the rest, I don't know about constant mentioning of peoples' anything. It is you, just you. I didn't see anything in the DSM-IV about targeting globby specifically being a mental illness. If me harping on you, critiquing you or just expecting more out of you makes me mentally ill than I'll find comfort with your friends and family.
---
So then people are just choosing no to kill super caps?
---
&gt; Total cost according to PYFA is 7.68 billion.
---
[Looks at capitals in hangar]  *It's okay, little fella.  You're still loved.*
---
So then people are just choosing not kill super caps?

So, par for the course?
---
how are you so incapable of reading basically written out statements?
---
Actually yes. I spent many hours of netflix simply waiting for reloads and cycling tubes every 95 seconds or whatever.  
---
Can struggle with frigs but can also be a chill boat to semi-afk
---
There's always gotta be that one harsh comment that comes out of left field on r/eve eh?
---
Dope. Happy hunting.
---
All citadels are ACL based, all jump gates, cynos etc are ACL based.          
---
It is logical that observatories also will be using ACL.
---
That way they wont come back.
---
Indy is the backbone for any organization. 
---
And there are more models. But they arent that efficient as this and it is the easiest to manage.
---
He would be broke, begging in Jita local and desperately trying to learn mining before rage quitting due to recruitment scam. This is how New Eden was saved from the Grim Dark.
---
Also, the observatory should not provide any functionality while it is reinforced, but would still burn fuel.
---
I am not 100% sure, at release literally anyone who did damage or repped got payout, but it may have been updated to main fleet only. I do not know for sure though, I have not been able to run them for a  few weeks
---
I'm not blaming people for using the model at all. It's the best model. My issue is with CCP having made supercaps the best fast response fleet.
---
Awesome. I look forward to flying against these guys again!
---
Because, as stated in the OP, both of communications tower can only be installed in the Corp HQ system and the Asset Safety module/rig can only be installed in the designated Corp HQs structure.
---
Cynos only on recons and cover frigates (not bombers, and not caps, the ships that are bonused towards them- this achieves your 5 minute up time goal)
---
Cyno lighting time needs an equal match to the inhib online time so the game play is fair between the two, either both are reduced to zero like the cyno, or both take as long to activate as the inhib.
---
Double the range of an Inhib.
---
People are under the mistaken impression that you play Eve. Is is not just a game. Eve plays you. Eve is the last and only addiction.
---
Same deal with all wormholes tbh
---
There's nothing to refute. Honestly. You've already unsubbed. You feel the game isn't fun, and you won't change something that largely makes the game unfun. Such as huddling up in a region, circle jerking a bunch of unused, unbattle tested Titans together while blueing the rest of new Eden around you wondering why the games grown stale.
---
just make them die and have no reinforcement timer, take fuel and be easy to kill (so they're only useful in populated systems with active defenders)
---
But drifter armada will use it as a stageing in the next wave?
---
How will you deliver torpedoes if they are camping the Thera wormholes ?
---
ALL 50 accounts
---
Nah I'll just use one of my 5 subbed accounts..
---
Have you heard about how broken Gleam is?
---
And anyone can blow them up.
---
How about limiting cynos to a subclass of one or two ships. It's beyond the corvettes access to cyno if that isn't abundantly clear.
---
Found the CCP spy! :)
---
Because surprise, most PVPers don't \*actually\* want a fight.  They want a dunk.  This will be reinforced when the PVE targets go away, the "elite PVPers" will only have each other and content will dry up.  The whining will be hilarious.
---
Why the Arty vs. HML or HAM?  Range to plink?
---
Just remember, I am the True Jeff.
---
I think that may be the ark site, not sure
---
&gt; If it makes you feel any better I am an equal opportunity exploder.
---
With current game mechanics, chances of a pve player are so far from equal the whole mentioning of equality makes me want to hurt you.
---
I did exactly that when learned about local in null.
---
Short answer? Yes
---
Lol, hardest cans in null would take like 20 seconds for Blackglass owners with nearly 100% chance. 
---
Should be a tier above that (i.e. never seen before) to be a real deterrent
---

I would be fine with that so long as the jump bridges and jump beacons got the same treatment. And -1 timer for every other Upwell structure.
---
Great, yeah, citadels predate my sojourn into nullsec so I didn't know that. Imagine the conquerable station was destructible. What should happen to the items inside? I'd prefer loot drops as if a ship was destroyed.
---
wow good changes

I like them all except 7, and even then I only don't like the constellation/regional bit

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
why are caps the obvious answer to a small destroyer gang
---
A t2 passive Gila can run t4 gamma sites without implants.
---
Yes and when you despawn a sig, another one pops up in a different wormhole in a the same region.
---
If we collectively got all the wormholes in the same region turbo-krabbing I predict an exponential increase to isk inflation like nothing we’ve seem before!
---
It would be more amusing than the normal way of seeing everyone tear into each other on this subreddit.
---
Faction drones also have twice the tank and better tracking than t2 drones.
---
I blame winet. Not you. And the apparent apathy of River to just let Winet do what he wanted. That guy ravaged my corp before moving on to ravage your alliance. Wasn't surprised to see he was at the center of causing drama.

Good luck with that. The retards keep posting suggestion threads.

Currently the Flex structures can be placed and defended from other structures. How do you feel about that? Would you want it to be out next to a tcu or in a keepstar? Also, limit bubbles being anchored nearby or no?

About 3 licks.

Not an all to bad idea
---
Well that's not too great
---
I’m running a fit similar to yours except sub the boost amp for another large cap battery. Also my invuls are pithum c types. The fit costs 1.6b and I haven’t had to run implants. I just run T4 exotic and gammas. So far haven’t had an issue. 
---
Is all that implant bling necessary for a T5? I just fear socket closing and losing everything. I’d be fine if it was my fault and I learned from it but when it’s not in my control I would be a bit salty.
---
Alts on the same account would need a multiple training certificate to train them at the same time. Alts on a different account would be alphas and could not be logged in at the same time. If you think there’s even a chance you’ll want an alt account at some point you might as well start a free alpha account and get it training skills now. Then you’ll be further along if you ever do choose to start another account. 
---
Depending what you’re doing in the game if you are living somewhere not in high sec or are in low/wormhole/null corp then you’ll want to make a Jita alt on an account somewhere. Could be a free alpha or an alt on your main account. Train some basic market skills and park it in Jita. That character can do all your buying and then contract it to your main character for shipping after. Then you never have to worry about flying all the way to Jita just to buy things.

You break even in like 2 hours on a FW tengu or Loki

I can see how this is more of a follow on test (perhaps though neglect or unintentional code swapping or it's CCP (lol)).  What will null do if: 
---
local breaks (thanks Hilmar for adding wh stuff to all eve (maybe wh glitches will stop?)
---
Drifters start roaming null and shoot stuff at random (I know it's not random, but if the drifters wanted to really cause hell they should really stick it to a system and blow up more stuff)
---
Results in and/therefore let's (as CCP do this fix/code flop) justify the next thing.  Thing as in new structures or whatever nimble CCP fingures can do.
---
If CCP is really interested in bots and a way to be ahead of the bot coders perhaps they can use local blackouts to do this.  
---
Idk.  Wishing this is a justification for dust515 v 3.0.

actually make them cheap to build but BPC for them can be bought only from pirate LP stores.

---
Apparently he is coming back in a week or so
---
Yes last thing New Eden needs is goons having 500 of those moving along with 2000 titans.
---
I’m okay with them being close to other Upwell structures. The way I envision it, it should be very easy to impose a temporary blackout on local, unless the gunner is paying attention. Or you have a cloaked ship there.
---
I’m also okay with letting bubbles be anchored nearby. There are plenty of interdiction nullified ships in Eve.
---
I am not a partner nor affiliate they might be more lenient. Only one way to find out 😉
---
Please rewrite the a different way.  I don't understand what you mean.
---
Yes, I think it is fine they can be partially defended from inside the Upwell structure.
---
No limit on bubbles. Bring nullification if you want to avoid them.
---
Thanks!
---
lmao I don't blindly back someone based on what space guild they're in- Stop being dumb.
---
So make it max out hacking time similar to hitting an ESS? 60 seconds at best case and xyz at worst?
---
its a 50mn cloaky loki, arty is by far the best choice - works for fragging krabs, works for shredding tackle, works for taking actual fights
---
He took an eve break, been trying to get him to come back though.
---
I use T2 for battleships and faction for the others, because of the reason you just pointing out :)
---
It’s really cool to see the actual numbers of everything, especially the ISK/site and ISK/hour because that’s what people are most interested in when they ask about the abyss if they don’t know much about it. Thank you for collecting the info and sharing it!! I need to get my ass in gear and run T5s consistently! 
---
Also, side note, if you’re interested, join the “Abyssal Lurkers” in game channel! It’s a kind of Abyssal community for people to ask questions, share fits, and talk about all things Abyssal (including Invasion stuff). It’d be awesome to have someone like you in there to answer questions and chat with Abyssal newbs, especially with the kind of info you have here.
---
The other 18 hours will be? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxHa5KaMBcM
---
Actually thanks to my friends at Test Alliance Please Ignore I am going through a bear dubstep phase... I will play the following for 18 hours https://youtu.be/f6k4OvkZ8tU
---
Ok I got an idea on how the local blackout could get people to spread out over more space:
---
How about the Observatories/Local providing structure would cost based on characters in System (exponentially?) (even makes some sense lore wise -&gt; More dudes = more power being required?)
---
That way, there would be an incentive to spread out as you would require less fuel compared to a hyper dense region taking a humongous running cost.
---
What didn't I see that makes this a bad idea?
---
only in 0 and to the lowsec borders...
---
Unless the prices have vastly changed the last few months, you're severely underestimating the profits to be had from the blueprints. 
---
I hunted and killed a War Target of mine doing Abyssals, and nabbed a couple of blueprints. I want to say it was some of the gun blueprints? Grabbed everything else off the market, I *think* I did T2 research (it was a little while ago, memory's shot) , and made a several hundred percent profit as I trickled the modules onto the market making sure Amarr only had a few of them up at any given time.
---
Haven't made more bank from a gank since the time I ninja'd an officer module passing past someone else's fight.
---
Warp to a bookmark created before it became solid.
---
No, just C2s with HS statics.
---
Imagine being so pathetic that you imagine Eve is the only game with risk.  I play rust.  Offlining is a way of life. You get over it and move on. But all you babies are ready to just unsub or quit. Not that you were paying for your subs anyways. Thanks for dropping the prices of plex for the rest of us.
---
unfortunately I don't have the bookmark =(
---
and Intaki guy is a goon pet :) :)
---
Mobile tractor unit is your friend
---
Crash full speed into it with an interceptor and create the bookmark before you get bounced back.
---
Yea best case. All titans get bombed.
---
Something like that. Fast enough that the defender has to be at the keyboard and paying attention or the aggressor gets away. I’d be comfortable with a skilled, properly trained, and properly fitted hacker being able to disable it within 30 seconds uninterrupted.
---
It was still the greatest podcast ever made.
---
dude making worst posts than Stainguy isn't a competition you want to get into
---
Definitely.
---
The actual inception of Pandemic Horde is to mimic the goons model and success they had with Karmafleet. Karmafleet of course being made to mimic the success Brave Newbies had. (in amassing numbers or willing bodies, not being destroyed by 200 man PL slippery pete fleets on the regular whilst piloting Atrons)
---
It's just mass recruitment of would-be newbie group players or misguided veterans. It's just modeling after success and adds hundreds of players to your fleets.
---
That being said, KF is goon proper, same ilk as gewns from inception despite being an expansion of the franchise. Pandemic Horde on the other hand are not the same as Pandemic Legion and they made that very clear from the start.
---
KF is likely the more successful franchise because although PH inherited some semblance of culture or standings from parent organization Pandemic Legion it exists separate - by Pandemic Legions choice from the beginning, due to not wanting to be associated with the mindless masses meant for work. Elite and all that.
---
That's not really a measure of success, I just like reiterating constantly that PH are unclean by pandemic standards from inception. Doesn't bother any of that lot in the end  of course - just irony for fools to mull over.
---
haahahahaahaha thats beautiful but a little greedy,  it just needed to be an active chore to maintain
---
good meme
---
the answer to this small frig gang was a bubble and an FC that didn't scout his warp. Don't blame the cap because horde fucked up.
---
The passive MWD Gila fit I made for the Gila's Guide to Abyssal Deadspace at the start of the expansion still works, even in a cheaper version without the C3-X (triple imperial DDA fit) you can do any tier 5 except Dark in it safely.
---
It's a fraction of the cost of the fit above, no HG pirate implant set or deadspace shield gear. The most expensive thing is a good c-type MWD rolled with -signature and +speed, and I use the CA-1 to 4 implants. Still gets about the same DPS as the OP, beats tier 5s safely in avg 15 mins and can do all types but dark.
---
easy, you get a bubble and position it like this: [https://i.imgur.com/BnTCrFx.png](https://i.imgur.com/BnTCrFx.png)
---
Then a second ship activates warp to the keepstar and gets dragged by the bubble edge and is stuck in the structure.
---
We use this in wormholes to kill scouts warping at range to our citadels.
---
yes, more isk/h means more return over investment.
---
True :) but I don't think that's true in a way that would help big groups like goons
---
Primarily because moon ores cannot be compressed. You can mine arkonor, sure, but the stuff required for T2 production cannot be efficiently exported form wormholes because it cannot be compressed.
---
So much of the 4k would also be alts.
---
CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR! CASINO WAR!
---
It really depends on the keepstar. Goons got to the center with about 1000 caps.
---
&gt; few minutes later phorde gang of about 15 in kikis n shit pops through, they go hunting for easy kills, we start forming some dudes to kill them. we get a cynjo and drop a couple caps to play with the kikis, they run away, we chase, end up on sun grid in staging.
---
i think you and i read different aars
---
Hey anyone have a link to the discord? I’m a new player and wanted to check it out, unfortunately the discord link posted has expired. Any help would be much appreciated! :)
---
I don't mind the removal of local as i said on the eve forums i would like all free intel removed  
---
cyno in system
---
players in system
---
NPC kills  
---
ADM 
---
heck i'd love it if kill reports where make into a score card   
---
xplayer has killed   
---
x bs   
---
x bc  
---
x cruiser   
---
x titans and so on 
---
no info on how a ship was fitted you get the loot but you don't know if they where fitted of in the cargo hold. kill shoot only for the record
---
Bounties used to pay 100% making them worthwhile to hunt, even suicide gank. 20% of value killed is worthless unless its a cap. You get more from their fittings drop most of the time now.
---
What a sad, ignorant outlook on life. Just because I'm part of x doesn't mean I can't critique y. You also literally don't know any of my experiences either, so you're just making asinine assumptions. Then again, I'm sure you have no actual valid argument so you decide to take the low road.
---
&gt; hydra, tuskers skill U didn’t start off big and punched way above there weight
---
Yeah, and where are they all now? Absorbed to join a larger null block or dead.
---
\^
---
hilmar probalby went out to null to hunt, and said
---
"wow if everyone knows where i am 24/7, why would anyone that I could kill still be undocked?"
---
and then he realized the necessity of removing local
---
Bounties used to be scammed constantly. Hi alts.
---
The Russians are their own collective too, and are probably organized this way too.  So that's 4.  If only the Chinese would get their act together, they could be come. . . dramatic pause. . . the fifth race.
---
MFW even the NPC groups are bitching about PLEX cost.
---
Another great listen. Keep em coming !
---
thanks! I will try this out.
---
You just happen to not stay long enough and that immediately fails your claim. It's just the update mechanic suck. I've been doing these from invasion release in all play styles (pub fleet, ninja salvage, solo mining and fleet mining) to doubt your pure PvE PoV. None of triglavian miner ever reported triglavians warping into sealed conduit at least until last weekend (I'm inactive this week for a project deadline). I don't think a mil m3 ore and whole mining community can count on luck to dodge all the warp in.
---
I am just a humble elite dvd'r who is the best kiki pilot in eve, liberator of Conoco, Whelper of Gilas, Bonker of Bitches.
---
I am just *goddam elite*
---
Waiting for your application bro
---
As a Goon line member, I prefer to do strat operation in Querious rather than deploy to another Keepstar.
---
We can come back to krabbing faster that way.
---
It's great to annoy your alliance mates when a fleet arrives back home :)
---
Also smaller faster ships have a way easier time flying through structures then bigger ones.
---
Still gonna be annoying for logistics work.  Being able to repurpose any hull into a cyno is very nice.  If your problem is just combat ships all having cynos, just make cynos give horrible passive penalties to ships that fit them like cloaks have, except for whatever ship classes CCP deems "cyno specific".  Then logi pilots can continue doing our thing with slightly less suicide contemplation, and cynos become slightly less oppressive.
---
The Impairor can light a cyno if you have Cyno V. To me, no corvette should be able to light a cynosural field without Cybo V.
---
I’d rather see no corvette could light a cybo without Cyno V.
---
cuz they trash. i use a 2bn ishtar no implants
---
&gt; Rorquals will probably stop using excavators and switch out to Miner II  
---
Are you high?
---
Team Corgi, eh?
---
When do you invade Providence?
---
No thank you, delayed local is fine the way it will be. No more structures no more fucking over logistic teams that need to fuel extra stuff, unless you make them like inhibs with no rf bs
---
&gt;.. and you were killing those guys anyway.
---
*I* wasn't. Although I'm willing to admit I wasn't trying very hard then and someone else might have.
---
Reliably shit money. 
---
Just take 2 leshaks out of your static for that dank blue loot
---
You don’t think Observatories are coming? They are among the last Upwell structures we don’t have yet.
---
I dispute that. It will only require more effort, not skill. D-scan is a very simple tool to use and has clear limitations. People will either spam v or just warp around big systems and scan until something is located. That's what I'm saying. It's only about how much effort one is willinh to put in.
---
And please don't throw cheap crap in the end. It just lowers the level of our discussion.
---
&gt;they warp to the sun, *land in their own bubbles,* and my boson.
---
You're in bombers going after a titan, how do you not warp to a ping above the bubble instead of feeding your gang to the DD that's obviously going to come when you land in the bubble? FC fucked up
---
Congrats on being wrong three times in a row.
---
Then by null multi-boxing standards you can still make almost a bil an hour just doing static krabing
---
It’s called C6
---
[Why these Sigils?](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77677227/)
---
&gt; Proceeds to quote the reason provided
---
First of all there are jump bridges and titan bridges, and they aren't the same thing.
---
Second, he specified no reason why exactly it won't work.
---
This means the winner of the inhib vs cyno will be the first to press the button, which then makes a online timer superfluous. Also you would then have a case of instant esculation, rather than seeing if a fight can be taken. Last  this gives all advantage to the hunter. You can decloak and put out an inhib before the tick and you even show on the Target's client.
---
This has to be Felix allistar
---
Both of those are obvious with context
---
I was meaning from the point of view of a ratter/miner. The discussions I've seen are about having cloaked scouts sitting on gates into pocket systems. These can provide intel without the use of local. Larger groups can organise this and turn it into an efficient network. Combine that with the umbrella and you'll get protection a smaller group probably can't provide.
---
rolling sigils, they're dirt freaking cheap and have great mass, so they roll the holes nice and quick and we dont give a shit if we feed 50 of them. :)
---
who the fuck is NSH? bunch of salty kids? they way you talk is terrible. NSH - not so happy? looks like bad childhood  
---
\~peace
---
limited numbers and i was bored
---
FW you break even with 1/2 a L4
---
Havent heard about that one yet... How does that work ?
---
He showed up on OG mumble the other day for the first time in like half a year....
---
I think Black Frog might black list you.
---
That damn gap between Drones regions and the rest of Eve is going to make this way less exciting space than elsewhere in Eve.
---
I haven’t logged into og mumble in a year because people kept talking about fortnite.
---
I resubbed for this too.
---
Industry question: I picked up a few blueprints (copies) from running exploration sites and was thinking about making them. Except, invariably, the items they produce (while valuable) are worth less than the cost of buying the input materials for the BP itself. I noticed this for 3-5 BPs I have. And this is in major trading hubs like Jita. Do the industrialists just have the major markets so locked down that they get all their inputs for less than I can and then sell the outputs at prices lower than I can afford? Or am I missing skills/knowledge/using copies/something else to make producing these BPs potentially profitable? Thanks!
---
i wish i was as good as him but yeah not me, ive never even heard of him
---
Sounds way too complicated for some Icelandic boys to code
---
Umm......What? Everything ok over there bud?
---
Multibox frigs are about 800m an hour on t5s, just fyi
---
Reads like you’ve had a few drinks already
---
you are obviously arguing a different point, known as strawmanning.  OP is saying that caps + titan were sent to contest the 15 kiki gang.  Guess it helps if you graduate high school first, it helps with reading comprehension.
---
right now the winner is always the cyno, making them both instant or both on a timer would at least mean whoever goes first is the winner, right now theres just the cyno winning unless the player is physically not at the keyboard to press the button.
---
&gt;hen again, I'm sure you have no actual valid argument so you decide to take the low road.
---
Man you are part of test if you really gave a shit about small gang or smaller groups in general you realy are in the wrong place, youd be out there trying to make it work on the small gang/entity front and actually accomplish somthing.
---
Just because the enteties i mentioned arnt doing big things atm dosnt mean my point is wrong skill and knowledge is a massive factor for sucess you dont need infinate dudes to do big things. 
---
and alot of those dudes from the corps and alliances i mentioned left or stopped playing because Eve got stale not because they cant find sucess 
---
 your free to your opinion as is every1 but i dont claim to speak for any1 but myself and at a push the dudes i fly with because at this point im pretty aware of their opinions and stances on certain subjects related to the game. 
---
And not saying its impossible for you to have an opinion but im going to weight your opinion much less than the people who are actually out there making small groups work as they will in all likleyhood have more experience on the subject, im not claiming to be the best at eve but i have been a ceo and an alliance executor for a small alliance more than once and know the work it entails.
---
I have been lucky enough in my time in eve to fly with some of the best pilots out there I dont consider myself to be among that group but i will take their opinion above some random test line member unless you can prove to me your opinion has more weight than theirs.
---
And lets face it its all speculation at this point either of us can spew our thoughts on the matter but we dont truly know how this will turn out in the end, i suspect you dont have a crystal ball i dont have one either
---
Nobody does fortnite anymore, i think the current craze involves table top simulator and monopoloy
---
Awesome, exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
---
Just run level 4 faction warfare missions In a Cloaky t3.
---
500m-700m cost and they make something in the realm of 350-500m/hr depending on your ability to cash out the LP.
---
&gt; Cost: 600m
---
Thats way to cheap
---
So you have instant esculation. Light a cyno now, because you may not be able to. And you have a further "I win" button aspect to cloaks. That's not balance, that's full scale the other way.  Need another idea.
---
That Phoenix one &lt;3
---
"I won't leave completely but I'll unsub my PvE alts and only play on my PvP accounts."
---
Is...is that supposed to be a bad thing?
---
I've seen it happen multiple times. But yeah I must be wrong right. Not like it happened.
---
Did you mine in the Foothold system or perimeter/adjacent? Maybe this doesn't happen outside of the Foothold.
---
Look, United airlines is already paying it's pilots too much. Legal got on the horn and said there was a paralegal who ran the numbers and he's a dodgers fan so it checks out and soon he won't sit in a seat and fly because it's too expensive so none of it matters
---
Is this a bot from r/subredditsimulator that escaped or something?
---
I legit said this outloud
---
What is pi?
---
Yes and no. It'll get hung up on worthless wrecks, and you have to go back for it. Module just extends your reach for snagging your payout, on the way to the exit. Time is of the essence, after all.
---
neverTM
---
Planetary Interaction
---
Not for me. Then again, I have not actually looked at my PI in two years.
---
🤔
---
That's why you manufacture completely in the hole.
---
Nope, leave it at 4 and invest in something else, like another pi alt, over the coming 18 days
---
holy shit you are fucking bad at this game and reek of rotten krab. good riddance.
---
Oh, Gotcha. Thanks mate for clearing all that up for me.
---
we're not giving it reinforcement timers or damage caps, and making it easily killable
---
Not necessarily. Pvp tends to be more commonly done on mains. Tbh, I consider myself to have 2 mains...
---
Foothold always, for the cycle time reduction
---
Yea, you're just making excuses, dude. Goons are totally hardcore pvpers, and any goon that isn't is just an alt of a hardcore pvper, right?
---
I remember that one time TRI asked IRC to raise ADM's for TRI. They hyped it up like they would be a member of Vanguard coalition.
---
Wait nothing else to say?
---
Credit card warrioring, big yikes
---
Don't allow cynos in anomalies.
---
Its not full scale the other way, its balancing both to be instant, whoever gets the button pushed first wins, you're attempts to guard your current levels of safety are pretty fucking transparent.
---
Its equal playing field if both modules react the same.  Right now its tilted entirely towards the cyno, which you are obviously fine with, but if presented with the situation in reverse its somehow distasteful to you, which points out your super obvious bias.
---
The modules need to function exactly the same for there to be balance, sorry that means you'll need to be faster on the button but thats called fair.
---
Yes let's ask CCP to steal from their playerbase lmao, cuz tears. Okay, let me see a list of your assets and I'll choose a few you get to keep. You're fine with that, right? Tears, remember?
---
Nah, you'd be better of training an additional pi alt in 18 days instead.
---
(current dictor probes last 2 minutes for the normal ones, 3 minutes for the Surgical ones)
---
Imagine letting mittens live this rent free in your head
---
+1 deranged rant. Have an upvote.
---
I use a similar fit and run electricals. Yes it's expensive but I can derp through sites most of the time.
---
Except now PL is the weakest among NC/PL/PH.
---
Easy. Go to one side of it and warp to a bookmark on the other side. Make a bookmark mid warp when you're right in the middle. This is easier with a fat, slow ship like a super, but you could probably do it with anything. Might take a few tries to get it right.
---
That’s what I was leaning towards for it. Just out of curiosity did you do Planetology IV/ Advanced Planetology IV? I ask because my set up for my alts is Command center upgrades V, Interplanetary Consolidation V, Planetology V, Remote sensing III (Live in wormhole so didn’t see the sense in training high) Advanced Planetology IV as well as Cybernetics V and Gallente Industrial V for the Epithal
---
Exploration BP's are largely useless. There might be a couple out there that are profitable but for the most part they are either unresearched so use too many materials or are for useless items nobody actually wants to buy.
---
I stopped reading at #1, if you were into small gang PVP you woudn't join an alliance of that size, this statement alone makes my bullshit detector redline, nothing else in that post can possibly contain anything of value.
---
Use the one in the sidebar.
---
There has been talks of something like this. It'll work like the jammer most likely so 3 anchored per system. 1 online at a time. Made from trig stuff like the jammer. Now I can dream that itll decloak cloaky campers but that wont happen
---
EVE has a very niche appeal, I think. Most people will either love it and never stop playing, or won't be able to get into it at all. Give it a shot, it's definitely worth playing.
---
Suad knows the trick, ask them
---
You can make folders in the quickbar?
---
Take out the elite PVPers part of it and you described a lot of the way many people played Eve before the Rorqual changes. There were lots of “Care Bears with fangs” who would try to kill a roaming gang with subcapitals. After Rorquals Online, those same people respond with FAX and Supercapitals.
---
ISK inflation? Or blue loot price drops?
---
The sub is filled with goon hating pubbies mate, you aren't gonna get through to them. The narrative is always gonna be "bee man bad", and no matter what happens people are gonna be saying goons are mad, salty, etc. Props for typing all this out though.
---
Yes, worthless, not worth doing at all, nothing to see here move along.
---
do tell stdz??
---
Oh ok, so it's goons' fault NC/PL didn't defend their space, and therefore goons were just trying to make friends and not committing to war. That is some peak mental gymnastics my man.
---
Sunken cost fallacy is one hell of a Drug.
---
Your character name being what, then? You know, since you believe mcav is a boogie man of wh space, I'm sure you won't mind sharing that either.
---
:)
---
&gt; Sold under the prestigious PLEX standard for almost a decade, QE 4-He chips have undergone several waves of improvement and enhancement of the underlying containment technology. In particular, containment technology now allows for **much more precise amounts of QE 4-He to be stored in a miniaturized chip format.**
---
I mean, if CCP misinterpreted their own lore thats on them.
---
Or make the bookmark a known distance from where you want to end up, go to other side of KS, warp to bookmark at range.
---
Oh? What do you think is so difficult about c3s and above?
---
Allready resubed as many accounts as I could afford.
---
&gt;Aggressing an NPC from that faction removes view access for one hour.
---
Fun idea, but probably impossible to implement.
---
Well if you pay attention to the Scope video, the SCC isn't running short of QE 4-He, they're having trouble getting to the fluid routers to refuel them.
---
And I wouldn't panic too hard as 4-He and fluid routers have long been established as providing local chat. Its just a good MacGuffin for the Drifters to use.
---
Low is not that different from null tbh, in that it's not as black and white as people think. In both you'll find actual good players looking for, and willing to give, good fights. However, just like you can run into nerds dropping carriers on your frigate gang in null sec, you can find nerds dropping on your solo ship in fw when the 1v1 they wanted so much doesn't go their way. Long story short - there are assholes everywhere, sadly. I'm hoping null blackout brings some fun content to that blue wasteland.
---
you also forgot the admin hubs from the 2017 eve vagas road map
---
If your in goons and you're dropping supers on the QFC you arn't going to be in goons for very much longer
---
It was renamed to Planetary Production, put noone calls it that.
---
That's a really good question, might have to downgrade a couple things. I'll check when I get back home.

---
Probe launchers on the other hand are configurable aren't they? So how about a probe-base solution with some sort of 'Deep Scan Probe' that doesn't allow warping to/location saving but carries a lot of other bonuses. (d-scan immunity + faster sweep times)
---
Would create some interesting play when coordinated with expanded launcher equipped ships as well.
---
No, leave it at four and get your second toon to consolidation 5 or the power grid upgrade one
---
Ok, but you're full of shit if you say you like small gang PVP and you join a coalition of 65,000 people.
---
Feel free to lie to yourself, but that shits not going to fly anywhere else.
---
Since local is going effectivly bye bye for now how does one rorq miine? Safest way?
---
I don't bait easily, sorry.
---
So you acknowledge such a change is a "press the button to win" mechanic between the two, that you originally did not point out. Thank you for agreeing with me.
---
This would make the timer superfluous. Thank you for agreeing with me.
---
This would mean you cyno first ask questions later. Thus will be instant esculation if possible. Thank you for acknowledging this.
---
I said a well fit cloaked and nullified Loki flown by a competent pilot could maneuver and drop a instant inhib before he appeared on the target's screen. You have not bought any evidence to the contrary. Likely you know it to be true. Moving the scale to the other side.
---
Measure twice, cut once. If your trying to balance the idea fails. That's ok it was a start and not a bad one.
---
Yup, I alt-tab all the time if I'm not picking specific targets. Spending a few bil more on the fit is soo worth it to reduce the stress that comes with the high risk.
---
Carrier L5s are about the same break even with a bit more profit
---
Confirming Observatories must be coming soon
---
I've had a few of those. If it's not during one of those specific situations I have at least 5 minutes of headroom to burn. Modules stay online during the dc, thankfully. I got out of one site with just 30 seconds to spare once because of a dc. Not fun lol.

What reason would I have to write it if I didn't?
---
I see most of it with my own eyes, pretty tough for me to question that. There's no such thing as objective truth, but I do believe what I said to at least be mostly accurate. There's no convincing a lot of people though, which is understandable.
---
Certainly. I realize that some of my suggestions are probably hard to implement.
---
then we agree, remove local but also remove info that is given by the game without ever having to undock.  Get out in space and find it.
---
This thread is making me laugh so hard my sides hurt! o7

Or use........scanning ships lol
---
Every coalition in nullsec has put down their guns. Every. Fucking. One. You are criticizing 80% of the people who play the game. Literally everyone in a null bloc. Even panfam are moving to consolidate their space and forming a super umbrella. 
---
If you really want to argue that the majority of the playerbase is what's killing the game, that's fine do your thing. Just be sure to level your statement at all it actually targets: *every nullsec coalition and all one hundred thousand characters in them*.
---
Cry more
---
Still, that's an additional subbed account that has to do nothing but sit and dscan. This may be a dealbreaker for them. They could decide to do the same with a suicide alpha toon though, that would be more troublesome
---
Their 4 griffins you  mean?
---
We had a nice 7 man cruiser gang against Goons tonight. We mostly lost. But nothing crazy. Had nice fleet fight.
---
Until they dropped a Carrier zZZzzZzzZz
---
Only 1 though. I guess that's as close to "appropriate" as it gets.
---
&gt;This would mean you cyno first ask questions later. 
---
Are you retarded, this is quite literally what happens RIGHT NOW in game.
---
Also I was very specific, either both get a timer or neither does.
---
Sorry you want 100% safety, but the writing is on the wall, a change in cyno mechanics is coming because quite literally everybody agrees the current model favors the defender entirely too much. 
---
I'll be waiting for your "quitting with 31 accounts" post when the final changes go live in a classic CCP version that's much harsher than what I've suggested.
---
tbh, not correcting the mistakes that are making the game worse because not everyone has capitalised on it isn’t really a good reason to not fix it.
---
Also imo extractors weren’t the mistake CCP made, injectors were.
---
Extractors should have just enabled players to extract the SP into their free SP pool to reassign elsewhere. This would have buffed the character bazaar.
---
No. We're Bovril. Anti-elite.
---
We enjoy having fun, shooting at shit, and not taking things too seriously.
---
I was on one of the kikis. You guys brought Avatar, Ragnarok. Hrl. Nyx. Rorqual. Lif. + some subs an hunting us on gates. The only watp in for Horde was that sabre on theirs and was in boson range. Very good reaction from you with the boson. But yeah, chasing 5 kikis with 2 titans and 2 supers is obviously great gameplay.
---
It's only bad if you use it to buy a Titan and lose it moving it right after you buy it
---
Can you post your fin? Please.
---
What narrative in this post? That we like EVE? That we are making plans for the blackout? That I have friends who are logging back in for this?
---
This was fairly narrative free to be honest
---
Why do you need local? Are people really that lazy that they can't hit the dscan button once in a while? As a wormholer/pvp'er, I'm not seeing the issue.
---
So... Whats the difference between jspace and nullsec now? In a broad sense I mean.
---
I lost one to the fu ark room.  :(
---
In 2007.
---
Give cynos 5 minutes delay.
---
Well, you could also just see a freighter warp to a gate, place a bounty while it’s in warp, and then gank it when it lands. 
---
Obviously you need two people for tackle, one on each side, but that isn’t a big problem, since you have all day to kill the freighter. 
---
But hey, Eve is supposed to be dangerous, so why not?
---
You do know that whole fanfest thing was theatre, right?
---
Feel free to delude yourself that you can cram 65,000 players into a group and have that result in only one playstyle, rather than what it actually is...a mishmash of hundreds. There's nothing about being in GSF that stops me from flying in smaller engagements, and there never will be
---
Actually, being "nice" is what is getting this game towards almost full bluetral. I'd argue less nice and more rudeness is required.
---
So now the lack of free intel must be compensated for by other buffs.
---
This, just use combat probes on your scout.
---
CCP Hilmar sat in his station because a cloaky camper was in system for 6 straight hours.   
---
How can I mine if I can't undock, he sees me, I see him, and he knows that I know he is here.  
---
"Ahh if I can't see him, he isn't here" \~ In Icelandic probably  
---
And so Hilmar ended cloaky camping, and there was much rejoicing. Yay!.
---
Goons 2019 is screeching pubbies, exactly the sort of people Goons used to shit on. How times have changed.
---
Those retards merged into Goons (naturally)
---
On that combat recon vibe
---
Hell yes it’s worth it. The game is a true sandbox. Be and do what you want.
---
Was it this blingy of a fit? Or more around the 3 bil range?
---
You obviously didn't understand anything written up there and came only to seek attention as a lowlife you are.
---
Shoo.
---
Life begets art
---
&gt; There's nothing about being in GSF that stops me from flying in smaller engagements
---
There is actually, smaller groups see the 65k dudes behind you and choose not to engage because theres a 50/50 chance you've got massive back up behind you.
---
It doesn't matter what playstyles you *want*, it matters what style you get, and its pretty common knowledge that small gang groups avoid goon gangs, even smaller ones for that very reason.  Its easier to do the small gang thing and grab your idiot stragglers and avoid the inevitable drops.
---
I'm sure you'll prove me wrong by linking some of your staged fights with test as proof to which I'll kindly reply "ha ha ha".
---
Again, your lie, feel free to tell it any way you want.
---
Cheers
---
the FC who warped into his own bubbles with a titan on grid is still stupid regardless of whether the caps were sent to kill him or not.
---
ya
---
&gt;Thats opt in local.. Not delayed

---
better yet- have killing the trig incursion rats have a small chance at dropping one
---
doesn't make it good game design
---
1: Supers aren't free. So unless you expect us to believe that your turbokrabs give away free supers to the pvp group when they could sell them for even more isk. This means that your pvpers are turbokrabs too.
---
2: pretending like the Imperium reaction to drifter invasions wasn't "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
3: Pretending like Imperium reaction to being negatively impacted by drifter invasions wasn't to try and damage the game directly so that CCP changes it back for you.
---
4: Pretending like goons are just here to make things better for everyone else.
---
5: monkey sphere too small to encompass all of Imperium therefore not all goons.
---
If it's a bot, just throw another Alpha account at it that bounces between safes when hostiles show up on dscan.
---
Nope
---
&gt; Both of those are obvious with context
---
Any bit obvious for an undereducated person because he doesn't know any other is not obvious for people who know more variation.
---
Just as not every game is battletoads, and not every anime is boku no pico, jump bridges and titan bridges are too entirely different things, and when someone confuses them, it is not obvious.
---
Observatories just need to use Stront.  That would be a viable fuel.  They should be easy to pop or disrupt, and i'd like a system scanning mod that can scan a system in an hour, you can scan it faster but for me that has like 2 hours of play time a night having the sites all scanned in my wh would be a life savor.  could also find cloaked ships if they don;t move every hour or whatever.
---
I got them up to IV just because I do that with every skill I inject that I don't intend to get to V.  Consolidation and Upgrades needs to be V though.
---
yes
---
Basically the counter play to the current drifter meta if you want to run anoms is to use a Titan or Super.  If you want to mine, use a Rorq.  Remember to be in coms, and you need to have a cyno fitted with enough fuel.
---
If you can not get either of these, do another activity to make isk.  
---
High sec level 4 missions are stupidly safe as long as you don't jump a super blinged ship into a suicide gank gate camp.  If your running level 4s away from the main hubs you can practically get away with just about anything.  Though if you want to be careful just use a t2 fit, but keeping your ships fittings under a bill will probably also work. 
---
However the safest space right now is in a wormhole with a group that knows what they are doing.  Just rageroll everything correctly to reduce the chance of unwelcomed guests, and you do not have to worry about getting hot dropped as well.   The only real threat would be if a gang logs off in your hole, and then attempts to log in trap someone.  However this is very rare, and is much less of an unknown than some cloaked SB deciding to drop 500 covert ops on your ass with a cyno after being afk for 12 hours.
---
As for the lack of hole asset safety, just don't put anything in there you can not afford to lose.  Furthermore if you are with a competent group you can probably punch a hole in a hellcamp as well with your allies long enough to evac.  Additionally you will probably make more isk than all the standard fit WH ships are worth combined in a week or two.  Seriously WH can make some silly isk.
---
What!? When did they do that
---
you auto win most frigate 1v1s
---
Interesting read. Does Ashy have a YouTube channel?
---
yo this is fire. bet
---
Thanks for doing the math!
---
They are supposed to be observatory arrays, i wish they would work like pos arrays but are probably gonna be like beacons
---
we should have a go on the dota soon
---
I just noticed that some of the modules I linked don't actually exist anymore (they were removed and standardized into 3 T1 modules and 1 T2), sorry about that. Fit should be updated with the proper names now.
---
Thanks
---
I heard there was a FRAT Sota a couple days ago. What happened?
---
Welcome to the sandbox
---
frat just called a quat cta for the boz1 ihub beloging to test ANNNND stood down
---
I by far prefer the rail fit [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76588337/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76588337/) for lowsec. You can kite you can scram kite ( the most common scenario) and you can even brawl in a pinch ( say after tackling an arty thrasher). Strengths are decent dps great range and speed. The biggest issue by far is cap life - you have enough to run one saar cycle while shooting after that you cap out - this forces you to micro manage the point and Ab to some extent. 
---
Blaster fit is fairly strong however it requires you to get very close. Notice that daredevil has a falloff range - even when blaster fit you can scram kite comfortably from 7-9km. Since daredevil has no tracking bonus it needs theh web to apply well - hence you can't web one guy and shoot another. If fighting up close load void  keep at range 500. If scram kiting load null and orbit at say 6-9km. Antimatter is not useful unless you tackle something with worse tracking ( fairly rare).
---
-&gt; rorqual nerf
---
-&gt; jump fatigue got changed and is clearly decent now, you can't travel the whole map in one hour with one capital is fine
---
-&gt; NSA nerf
---
-&gt; fighters and HAW weapons nerfed
---
For every nice person you meet in EVE there are 10 asshats like this guy that will kill you for the epeen.
---
It does remind me of that.
---
As a newbie wanting to ask questions, it's best if you **don't** ask;
---
&gt;Why did you kill me?
---
Instead, you should ask;
---
&gt;What can I do differently next time so I survive?
---
People in Eve don't need reasons to kill, and alternate-accounts are common, so many people that *appear* new really are not new at all. Asking the 'why' question feels like you want sympathy. Asking the 'what' question feels like a growth and improvement question. A more positive mindset is more likely to motivate people to help you.
---
pretty  harsh coming from a ph pet
---
Perfect, that's just what I changed them for, so everything is okay, thank you ))
---
If they do bring observatories into game they should have a 30 second delay timer IMO.
---
vov I know little of that alliance, as I've never really interacted with them.  I do know that they're a very old alliance by eve standards though, so their apparent pet status is kinda odd.
---
What makes WH space good for small gang fights is a mixture of not a lot of people and no cynos for the blobs.
---
I don't think an asshole like that is going to give me constructive criticism, the 1st guy probably would, but the 2nd and 3rd are just there to piss people off. And as for loot, I'm not entirely sure they need my 75mm gatling railgun and 1MN civilian afterburner...
---
There's no reason to fight when you're outnumbered 2:1. Plus, WinterCo didnt batphone, Legacy did.
---
I hope my odds of meeting nice people is a little bit higher :/.
---
Batphone who?
---
No kestrel will be safe now.
---
You undocked, therefore you consented to PvP.   I'm sorry you took it so bad, but that's how Eve works.  I remember the first time I got killed - I actually sent the guy some isk for popping my cherry.  I took it as a lesson and learned to get better.  Now I'm the guy who kills and rarely am I caught by surprise.  You need to decide what you want out of this game.  If it's perfect safety, well that doesn't exist, even in highsec.  But this isn't a reflection on the people who killed you - it's a reflection on you.  Look into the mirror and decide what you want this game to be for you.  If you want to get better and keep playing, ask for help - people will give it.  Coming here to cry about dying just makes us laugh though.
---
XIX, a couple others who are in their donut. intel also spotted Goons forming as well
---
&gt;This would mean you cyno first ask questions later. Thus will be instant esculation if possible. 
---
thats what always happens now lol 
---
go pvp instead of rorq minig you fish
---
Dude you have a lot of good ideas yourself
---
So for 100mil isk i could kill anyone i wanted in hisec and get +sec status for it?
---
See above.
---
Somebody doesn't know how WH loot works.
---
You consider XIX a batphone.... to Test?
---
Sounds like yall need to adapt or die 
---
:thonk:
---
not necessarily, just pointed out that they formed :)
---
big facts
---
Gasp, you might have to engage into a fleet without knowing 100% you can curbstomp it!
---
So you're saying that Legacy Coalition, which includes X.I.X as they live next to us, is bad for calling up their coalition to fight another coalition?
---
(And no, my flair isn't my corp)
---
Im thinking about it
---
Perhaps he's referring to FI.RE coalition, as they're not officially part legacy.
---
Yea but hasn't Test made it clear that they would be supporting XIX/Fi.RE in the conflict? I mean it doesn't come as a surprise. If goons were forming that is new to me. Still the way it looks like is that with WinterCO vs Legacy, Legacy wins. If WinterCO brings the north south, then the tables change. Feels like a year ago. UALX #2 when?

Here’s an off the wall idea that will probable get downvoted to oblivion but try skipping a scram/point and just go with a web. Either dual prop it with an AAR/nos or go shield - ccprise has a video of a shield fit like this back in his kil2 videos.
---
Possibly. Then again, we've worked with them intensively against the Chinese for ages.  
---
I bet he also blames groups like Evictus for joining :')  
---
Fact is that there were over 1.000 people formed in less than 15 minutes in order to smack down FRT, without calling any outside groups other than local actors.
---
So were UALX, X47, and X47 round two not real battles in a real war? Did goons not just walk up north and start burning everything they could? Had Test not taken a Frat Ihub just weeks before the drifters showed up? 
---
I’m not even sure what counts as a real war if neither the war last summer/fall or this spring qualify
---
*TACKLED IN BELT BY HUGE FLEET*
---
Just part of the game. Your whole time in EVE people will be killing you. The whole game is staying alive and trying to kill people back. Sure sometimes you feel like crap because you lost something you spent a lot of time saving up for. But that’s EVE, it’s a cold harsh place. It’s best to get a thick skin and appreciate that someone got the best of you.
---
This is also what draws people together. Working as a team is so much more rewarding than trying to go it alone. And people are drawn to teams in EVE precisely because it is harsh and unforgiving. 
---
You’ll get there. It’s a great game worth playing. But your never safe. 
---

Yeah, sure I "consented" to PvP, but there's no reason to kill me: no loot, no bounty, I'm not in an enemy faction, it was just out of pure dickheadery. There is this bridge somewhere (can't remember where), where it's legal to kill someone with a sword, crossing that bridge would mean I'm consenting to die, but does it mean I should? Perhaps if I had a lot of money or was famous, but other than that there's no use in killing me. And you phrase this like I'm reflecting on my life, on what ambitions I want to forfill in this game. I definitely don't plan on playing this game as long as you or the other guy have been playing, I don't care whether you find dying a real eye opener. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. And also, if I didn't undock, how the fuck would I play the game? You can laugh all you want ma cherrie, but I'm certainly not crying about dying, I'm critisising you and your loner pals for being assholes to new players.
---
There are tonnes of guys who will shoot you and :smug: about it, tonnes of guys who will pop you and move on without a word, and about as many still who will give you a "gf" in local and be happy to chat.
---
Take the good with the bad, be friendly and positive, look to learn lessons from each encounter and remember that ships, especially T1 frigates etc are more like ammo to be spent... they explode but are easily replaced.  
---
Good advice I received was to find a couple fits you like, buy a bunch of them and fit them, insure each one before you take it out with the full expectation you will lose it and try to have fun and learn a bit each time.
---
Depends how much you earn. If someone is on 100k+ then it absolutely makes sense to use your card rather than your time. I have a partner, kid, shit to do, I’m not going to pump 10 hours per account just to plex and another 10h at least to pvp. I’ll put in a couple of hours of work a month and only play eve to enjoy myself.
---
I wouldn't be complaining if I was an experienced player with an idea on how PvP works. Killing noobs not only stunts their growth, but also creates a negative affinity towards the game.
---
I hope there will be a highlight reel.
---
Make em the same mechanic as shooting an ESS
---
Already working on it. The fireworks were on point today.
---
It's not necessary. I run with this much bling because it reduces the stress. If I'm not picking specific targets I can safely alt-tab and not worry about getting popped. A killer disco would really suck though. But my DPS is high enough that I have at least 5 minutes of headroom to burn reconnecting unless I'm in a dangerous situation like 4+ starving leshaks, webs + 5 or more grips, or heavy neuts in a red cloud.

Nice kill

Follow your heart &lt;3
---
This is pure cringe. Just because you have someone else make a second rate website doesn't mean you opinion matters.
---
I would but i will be pretty busy with my final year in college come September
---
You wouldn’t happen to be using polarized weapon systems, would you?
---
Fuck off with your small gang pvp bullshit that would alter the way capital fights happen.
---
Hey just so you know rookie ships(corvettes) and fresh toons are 9/10 Cyno or Bait.
---
I know there are pleanty of nice people in PvP, I'm just getting the message out and reminding people of how it used to feel to get that grief that early in the game. I'm constantly worrying in null sec space that I'm going to get killed, I think the atmosphere of the game would feel a lot better if only the experienced players fought eachother. Eventually the rookies have to leave their metaphorical nests, but until then they should feel safe enough to at least *warp* through low and null sec space.
---
Imagine having over 4 bil in Podion and not being able to undock. Hahaha
---
I'm lucky I only had an Atron and few low tier modules.
---
it isn't though?  EVE as much as people like to claim that is it complicated, isn't.  depending on where you live you have approximately 5 or 6 different pve encounters that you will run and 1 type of anom that you will mine.  that is it.  pve is really shallow in null.   the interesting part is the logistics and empire building.  but that really isn't relevant to small groups anymore.  there has always been plenty of null for small groups to take.  the problem is that if you are not blue to your neighbors, you are basically fucked if you try and use that space.  for example, when renting, you aren't renting the space, what you are really renting is being able to be blue to your neighbors so you can rat / mine in peace.
---
I have an Atron, but that's still newbie enough right? Considering I've only been playing the game for a week or two after leaving my old account (that I only played a couple of days on).
---
I remember I was on a Thrasher roam and the fleet killed a guy like that while I was scouting ahead. They were like "holy shit! we got a ship, come qui- wait, it's already dead."
---
This is fallacious. Don't hide your wish you maintain the status quo behind a bad application of Malcanis' law.
---
People can bomb or use subcaps to clear the Goon heavy bomber wing. They can't do anything against the 1000 titan fleet.
---
If there are antisubcapital capitals in this game, then anticapital subcaps are also needed. Stealth bombers are one of the best/most fun ships in Eve's meta. The only thing that was worrying about heavy bombers was the relative high cost/accessibility/rarity of supers/titans, which is not true anymore.
---
Sometimes you're the hammer, sometimes you're the nail. Welcome to eve.
---
Comparing real life to a game.. stop fucking sulking and crying about it. You going to post after every death? It's a part of the game, being new doesn't mean anything and waiting 5 minutes is nothing. Soon as you undock, you're fair game for any and everyone. Majority of the time, loot has nothing to do with it, you're a kill mail and that's it.
---
But now you are. You’ve seen that if you undock people can sit there on the station. Lock you in 2sec. And kill you. So now you know could ask and people would say to use instadocks and instaundocks. To make sure your not suspect and therefore legal to shoot. You learned the names of a couple people to be careful of when you see them in local... I’m just saying we have all died like this and many more ways and you learn more from each one.
---
Gate your caps and just let the 0.0 allys care for their problems then.
---
But when the hammer is a big black battleship and the nail is a tiny tier 1 frigate, I don't think that's entirely fair.
---
I honestly don't like the hack idea at all. Thing is, you don't need a blackglass with zeugma and other implants, you need 3-5 t1 explo frigs with maybe t2 hack module. 
---
You will succeed if you have any experience with the minigame at all.
---
Don't advertise yourself as an elite pvp group if you won't even undock to defend your space.
---
The triglavian destroyer. It spider tanks and has ramping damage that's good for killing big targets.
---
The whole reason high sec exists is to be this metaphorical nest. There’s no reason, if your new enough to be upset about someone killing you, that you have to be in null. Your choosing to be out of the nest. Nobody is going to look up your Corp history and see how old you are. You look like bait or a cyno and they just shoot. It’s nothing personal.
---
In not getting upset every time I die you uptight asshole, I complain one time and get barraged by angry trolls like you who think it's in the declaration of human rights to kill me. If that's your mindset to the game, I worry for your real life attitude. Have some sympathy...
---
IMO a failed hack on any structure should destroy your ship
---
Standing fleet chat goes as follows.
---
Player: xxx
---
Fleet: Where?
---
Player: im takld in my vni in (insert whole region) help plz
---
Fleet: Ok but where specifically and what has you? Are you in comms? We need info.
---
Player: help plz
---
5 mins later.
---
Player: omfg no help and tehy killt me wtf
---
that's not your decision to make
---
And limit 1 / system
---
I’m going to hunt down every target I can, and the one that arn’t salty crybabies (or alt scouts) about it get SRP or 5-30m isk (whatever is more) tips and encouragement for getting to wormhole space so fast.
---
I'll definitely hop in there, thanks for the heads up!
---
never said hardcore dumbass, but some of us like to do more than one thing in eve, ya think?
---
It's certainly a good learning experience, but the golden rule is if you don't need to shoot it, don't.
---
Sometimes rookie ships have really good loot.
---
Yeah sorry dude but if you're comparing Eve to RL this probably isn't the game for you. Learn to distinguish between the player at the keyboard and the character.
---
Eve is about killing. Do you have to give them reason to kill you...nope.
---
&gt; And also, if I didn't undock, how the fuck would I play the game?
---
Well NC. seem to do ok.
---
But seriously, you're gonna die a lot in EVE and people will kill anything they can - that's just the nature of the game. If you can't handle that then stick somewhere you are less likely to die (highsec) or learn from deaths and be wiser next time.
---
&gt; and was even prepared to wait for a good 5 mins
---
Also, people wait hours on fleets for a chance to kill something - some supers have been hunted for years so don't underestimate the autism of someone to wait for a kill.
---
You can do that, but the guy in the example wasn't being nice at all, he just replied with a sassy remark after my perfectly reasonable question.
---
kinda hard to adapt to something that is completely OP, and buggy as fuck. and who says we're not adapting. the thing is, there's a trust factor with citadel gunners. and it's rather grindy to be having to be at the guns for hours because the drifters respawn, especially when they drop zero loot or salvage
---
haha you're being a baby. Someone killed you on a PVP game, get over it. Same could be said for you childish, bitter attitude to dying on a GAME, if you take everything personally then I worry about your real life attitude. No sympathy for cry babies.
---
My first fight was a fair fight, and I'd like to keep it that way, but with the mindset of some eve players, that's going to be difficult.
---
"go pvp instead of rorq minig you fish"
---
Fail.
---
That's not a golden rule at all and for the majority of corporations/alliances, it's the complete opposite. If you're not with them, you're against them.
---
But there's no reason to shoot, nothing to get from it except wasted ammo. That's the main point.
---
Didn't know reddit conversations made decisions period lol you fucking idiot
---
I love a good civilian railgun.
---
I was told you were on your way back in! I legit got excited... Would be fun.
---
No more replying now, I've already lost a shit tonne of karma because of your stupid views.
---
Don't you DARE forget about Chance Ravinne statues!
---
when the new agency came out. gnihihihi PP you get it PP....
---
also its now faction warfare not factional warfare anymore...
---
What is better when doing PI.. Whole planets dedicated to extraction and then separate planets dedicated to processing or doing a hybrid solution and getting P2 that way. I'm looking to set up PI on 3 chars and have it set up in a way where I could earn a plex but not have to check it every day.
---
There's a particular breed of eve player that want to squeeze the highest isk/tick. we all know who they are.
---
Can they run sites in 8-9 minutes? Half the time of this poster?
---
THIS works best.
---
Wasn't there an SCP write up on a wh with a NPC that made you die IRL
---
You're welcome man! Yeah I don't believe it sometimes too.
---
Gotta say, you had me for a moment.

Eve needs more people writing about it, not fewer. Even if they're wrong (haven't perused much of this article) they increase the amount of both discussion and visibility the game gets, neither of which are a bad thing. I guess you're more in the crowd of "Go directly to the news website of my coalition, regurgitate propaganda I read there ad infinitum"
---
there is fair fights in eve i never seen any
---
No, bad writing is worse than no writing.
---
I guess that's the word is that I'm rejoining.... Not sure where someone came up with that. Like 10 people asked me so far. lol
---
&gt;kinda dumb to have to adapt to something that is completely OP, and buggy as fuck 
---
You mean like ihubs and sov mechanics, local networks, infinite anomalies, super blobs...
---
If you have three accounts with most toons extracting with IV/IV skills, training UPGRADES to V on one toon will let you make P4 factories that are impossible with IV.
---
XIX has been a part of the conflict since the beginning. That’s the first I’ve heard of goons though. AFAIK they haven’t been involved in the conflict at all. At least, they haven’t been present at any point I was around.
---
can confirm my corp has 0 blues and that's by design we like blowing shit up your shit our shit doesn't matter to us
---
Yes. Even characters with low skill points can be very useful in fleets, and you can get into solo pvp pretty quickly in low security space if that’s something that interests you.
---
One thing of note is that people forget how useful jams can be when you have multiple ECM's boats for blops/combat recons against carriers. Bridge/Jump in, put falcons at range (70KM+) on opposite sides of the engagement site and jam fighters. As the fighters get close to Falcon # 1, warp out, come back in at the same spot, and repeat. They'll waste their MWD cycle trying to get you while the second ECM boat hits them from the other side. This will mitigate a carriers main ability to combat you, and if it cynos in shit, a falcon can just warp and cloak.
---
The other route is to train a bomber yourself, and hunt explorers. Join the dark side
---
Do like having having to buy a sub and Plex to play? Cause this is how it starts
---
These fits are uhhh not great
---
Meta is also not going to sway more heavily towards recons, that's just silly. The lach might see a slight increase for tackle, but the rest are still just support ships. T3Cs are the real winners.
---
It's not even that badly written. I just finished it. I don't expect professional level essays on in-depth game mechanics from most people on this subreddit, and this guy managed to convey his points fairly proficiently, even if I think the fits on some of them are a bit out there.
---
I couldn't agree more, StainGuy is the worst idea i've ever heard.
---
I enjoyed eve more when I treated it like a board game.  Everyone person online are taking 'turns'.
---
Look at the game at a very micro level. What can you do with your ship,  in local space,  in your system. 
---
Then look at the map(board) and zoom all the way out. Realize the potential things that everyone else is doing.
---
Now when you log in, what do you want to do with your turn, it either being a 15 minute turn, to a 3 hour turn.
---
That's already a thing, it cancels your subscription.
---
And that is your opinion. And it's okay for you to have a wrong opinion like this one. The writing is shit.
---
uh, lolwut. that's NOT OP to the level of the drifters. also not buggy as fuck. maybe learn to play the game?
---
Anyone who understands the Foxes and Rabbits Predator-Prey System will understand what will happen with EVE. The foxes are re-subbing and they will be more effective predators. The funny thing is is that it's the rabbits that build every single ship for the foxes. Goodbye T2 ships.
---
Hey, really not sorry y'all have literally every advantage in your court yet you can't figure out how to kill a few rats. 
---
Almost like the "null" in "null-security" means something.
---
I mean, NC are pretty used to sitting docked, so they should be able to adapt to this change rather easily
---
I didnt cry. I called the op an asshat for how he was acting. I even acknowledged he is allowed to be an asshat if he has fun doing it.
---
administrative hubs and advertisement structures seem next
---
Hello hellion bitch, I'm dad
---
train dictor alts \^_^
---
The point is it's not gated by SP or ISK. They can watch a stream or video and start learning how to do this very early on.
---
jeesus.... have you not been paying attention to just how OP they are? they'll lock, scram and shoot you across the grid. they can't be dscaned or probed. they do 1300DPS, 3km/s, with a sig of a frigate.
---
The primary cause of carpal tunnel syndrome in Eve.
---
click click click click click click....
---
Some silly people STILL believe there would be someone to hunt?
---
Oh wait, CZ, you guys still haven't closed yet?
---
Any citadel that restores full nullsec local seems a big 180 from what they are trying to achieve.
---
Perhaps the citadel could give a true delayed local, say 20 seconds, to give a hunter/roamer time to actually dscan a target before it docks.
---
20 seconds would also give enough time to make it through systems without showing up in local if the player is trying to burn to a desto undetected.
---
For anyone confused this is Matias Otero, founder of Brave
---
Nothing much, really. But I daresay you'll find it a bit challenging if you ever move up to one.
---
"Die quietly" has been a response I've heard.
---
This comment is pure cringe. Just because you have made a second rate comment doesn't mean your opinion matters.
---
I mean sure, that's literally the direct result of space aids which killed their hunting. PL was going to kill your super when you couldn't dock it and the game gave popups when you logged on your super to move/use it. You can just dock your super. 
---
Without those N+1 changes PL would have remained relevant for sure. Kinda goofy with the c4k fiasco and casino stuff, but relevant.
---
Everyone gets a super at HALF the cost, can dock it and asset safety - that shit murdered hunting. Proliferation and the works.
---
So then much of the move op was likely alts for people who like to do more than one thing in EvE. Right?
---
And it's not broken in the 64 bit client?
---
(slightly sarcastic rhetorical question)
---
It's part of a long list of savage changes that I'd make to EVE if I could haha :D
---
Basically CCP just really hated everything about Pandemic Legion and everyone went with it more or less. Alliance Tournament was probably the last bit of legacy to be put to sleep.
---
By  now it has probably built three Rorquals and sold them to the Goons.
---
maybe half or so. peopel don't really use many alts for pvp as much as ratting, mining, refining, industry, market, etc. pvp maybe 2 or 3 chars, otherwise, it get tedious. usually caps are on separate chars from subs... because... reasons
---
Probably some poor ideas, but hey, spitballing:
---
Maybe make cyno fitting requirements oppressive and bonus the recons and frigs into them.
---
Or how about making a cyno a polarized item?
---
Correct, XIX has been in the image from the get-go since the NIP ended between Winter Co. and Legacy. Goonswarm have been called upon before to help out Legacy in the conflict with Winter Co. but haven't been an active participant in the ongoing war.
---
Good stuff. Please keep it going!
---
Very different from the mmo's you are probably use too. Lots of them say sandbox but are really theme park. If you approach it like you do those then you will probably quit pretty fast.
---
It might not be a bad idea to research the game and pick something you think sounds fun to aim for and then set your own theme park queue.
---
Jesus what a poverty fit
---
*sigh* No. Change this instead:
---
1) Jump drive and Titan bridge spool up.
---
2) Scrams both precent cyno activation and kill a cyno once active just like MWDs.  I wouldn't be mad if points did this as well.
---
3) Cyno inhib charge for interdictors creating a cyno jam area of effect. Works in all classes of space.
---
Honestly dude, you're shit. Take your bad attitude and gtfo.
---
POST THE LIST!
---
XIX is part of F.I.R.E, not Legacy. But are friendly and helping each other when called, because they are allies of course. Im not saying its bad, but also far from it. If any alliance/coalition is in conflict of course they would call upon their allies to help out. Both entities on both sides of the war are allowed to. Unfortunately we weren't able to field the same amount of people that Legacy and friends were able to do. Hence why, we stood down.
---
Is anyone actually saying the rats are hard or take skill to kill?
---
I have actually no idea what your referring to
---
And they can be knocked out easy AF if you actually tried. 
---
Watched a rait fight off a fleet with nothing but a bomb launcher. Y'all manage to drop boson fleets on frigates, so what's the matter here?
---
Are you afraid of, dare I say it, *risking a ship*?
---
So many fond memories of wormhole space without local. Nullsec without local could be what sparks new interest.
---
&gt; And it's okay for you to have a wrong opinion like this one  
---
You tried to convince people that sodomy was a federal crime in the US, so tell me more about me being wrong my friend. You'd think by your sentiments in this thread you were some kind of grammatical connoisseur, but your post history largely disagrees. Maybe try not to be such a hypocritical fuck.
---
Delete this
---
No more free intel please. We show up in local in empire space because of empire law enforcer's presence, but not in null.
---
There should be a way to infiltrate if the system not proactively defended, otherwise it's just putting krabs back to their place.
---
What is polarised weapon systems?
---
CRY MORE
---
Shhh let the null krab leave his wrecks unlooted and confusedly looking at his wallet waiting for ticks to appear
---
That large of a move doesn't happen on a whim and Test leadership has countless times on this subreddit stated they were leaving once m-o happened. 
---
This two weeks of farming is just something you made up in your head, the move was already in the works and happening.
---
Aren't you the dumbest person to step up to the plate today? I have said nothing about grammar. Any credibility you had goes out the window when you try to attack someone for an argument not made. Now, you have shown me you aren't worth responding to any further and my time will be waste reading anything you type. I'm sorry your opinions are worthless.
---
They drop more loot. And I've done 5 sites an hour, so close.
