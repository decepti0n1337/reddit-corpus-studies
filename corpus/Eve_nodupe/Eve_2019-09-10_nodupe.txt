Finally a smart person on here
---
---
---
absolute true bee ;-) it is so sad that new null players playground provi is dead
---
Dunno.
---
I mean if I had lunches outside CCP, upgraded my flight seats, came in a few days earlier, had fancy (instead of standard) dinners every night, or went out of my way to be fancy at socials with cocktails etc. I'd have ended up having to pay $1000. Lots of CSM do that but it's important people understand that these are optional even for the person who wants to keep up with socials.
---

---
And I keep responding because I don't want anyone wanting to run for CSM being intimidated by this $1000 per summit idea. I know I was.
---
PS: Dunk likes to treat people with alcohol too so I hope he gets on every CSM and does that &lt;3&lt;3
---
Well, I mean, he IS an idiot after all. How else would they look at him?
---
Wow!  That's really cool!  :)
---
If you run across him again, can you ask him to please bring local back to nullsec?  :P
---
The fun part is you guys only THINK they're bait. They are just unsupported totally vulnerable caps roaming around solo in your sov space and you don't dare touch them because of the max fear and incompetence.
---
maybe your massive coalition should do something other than krab?
---
I haven’t been able to log in for a couple of months due to irl stuff. What happened to the VNI?
---
I really want to invest, where is the original?
---
Revive CAOD
---
D scan is perfect intel. It needs an overhaul.
---
And yet they are all smarter than most because they aren't welping a fleet with you.
---
Because they want people with talent.
---
try reading the next paragraphs
---
Guess I should know the source. All I see is CCP killing EvE and blaming null? Eh?
---
the fact that having fun in this game depended on a chat user list in some systems is depressing
---
gobbins can i have my gobloons pls
---
Personally, I'd call the old local itself in null sec overpowered and relied on too much. Without local we have greater balance, but a lack of players willing to sacrifice risk. I think that's the nail on the head. It has nothing to do with local.
---
That to me looks more like a "who let this guy in the room" or "Will you shut up" look to me. But that's none of my business I guess lol.
---
Well done sir... have an updoot.
---
Indubitably
---
It’s nice for the guy getting free drinks, but somebody’s gotta pay the tab. We did our best last time to make sure everybody could participate in everything, regardless of how much money they had.
---
Why no CSM flair.  You are on the counsel, right?
---
Hey I need 3 dudes to sweep the motorpool. You guys can work thru lunch and go home early, or you can take a lunch and stay late.
---
Risk vs reward
---
Profit vs loss
---
Stability vs instability
---
At current prices and reward null does not provide a positive on the ledger for ratting and mining in a subcap for a single account. Thus it is not being done. Other ledgers are finding the same bottom line.
---
wtf 10 months ago u were a tool and now ur kinda cool
---
Hope you get banned ❤️
---
Whilst yes it may be 'good' to rip down and rebuild, the usual approach is not to rip the building down when the family is still living in it. You buy new land and build the new house there and then move in (in this case, make a new Eve...Eve 2.0 or whatever the fuck). This is due to stability. In Eve right now, as I'm sure you would agree as your not a mouth breathing retard, that this uncertainty and total instability of the core game is impacting negatively on the games health.
---
I personally know about 20 people that have just gone 'fuck it, I'm done with this bullshit and knee jerk reaction updates and blind siders. I'm done' and they have unsubbed all their acocunts and just left. Will they come back? About half may in 3-6 months. The others I feel are gone for a longer period and the longer they are gone, the less incentive they have to return as they have time to get invested in another game, real life or just feel too badly burnt from CCP's ineptitude at communication and implementation of 'fixes' that break more than they fix
---
I personally have stopped logging in. No amount of 'free SP' events will get me to log back in as my faith in the game and in CCP has dropped so low that I'm refusing to give them stats to support their changes as well as cancelling all my subs until this shit storm passes. I will be back when the game is in a more healthy, less toxic and more time respecting state, but as it stands with these changes, my play style is destroyed (logistics etc). It simply will not be respecting my time and just adding more and more layers of tedium simply to do what I was doing just fine thank you very much last month. Resetting logistics chains, restocking industrial ships due to losses for cynos, not pre-releasing industrial cyno BPOs last week or whatever. All this leads me to believe that the incompitance is from top to bottom and until it's fixed I can totally understand peoples displeasure at the state of teh game.
---
Also this has come at a perfect time. There are many decent other MMOs out there to fuck around in that are fun to dip your toes in for short periods (ESO, FF14, GW2, WoW Classic (skip BFA imo) and many others that are out there).
---
Too late m8
---
yeah kinda tho
---
Regardless of any bitter vet rage, I hadn't paid attention in years that Hilmar got himself in shape.  I only remembered fat Hilmar, so good for him.
---
Idk. Never was given one, didn't ask for it.
---
They cant see/understand that
---
Linemembers are what make these big nullblocks big.
---
They cant understand how big is their contribution to eve stagnation.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes, but try tackling a marauder or something with light drones.  Tanking the drones under neut pressure, and keeping him from mjd out.
---
yes
---
Koolaid. You forgot some amount of sweaty-warm koolaid. Or Mtn dew.
---
It was a couple of drinks because he's nice. Not that I couldn't afford anything. I was prepared for the $1000 expenditure. The gift card just had enough money.
---
I can't wait tbh, i've been wanting him to leave since forever.
---
&gt; Slope is nowhere near vertical enough.
---
I’m talking about the MCT promotion
---
Story time:
---
Knew a guy who's company got bought, he had to bobble head for a year to get the remaining 25% of his cash.  He gets put on some project team to serve his time and plays on his computer during all the meetings.  Manager of the team finally calls him out on it and the guy responds, "Look, I'm the richest person in the room and I'm just about to get even richer and it has nothing to do with this stupid fucking job I was given, so lets stop pretending I was ever going to be an actual asset and I won't call you a fucking liar if you report this."
---
Alright, ran 3 Gammas and 3 Exotic tier 3's.
---
Didn't lose a single drone, if you delay putting drones out for 10 seconds you always grab aggro and hold aggro.
---
A few of the drones did get primaried but they were able to speed tank it out, especially in Gamma. CN Vespas have 1200 structure, 1300 armor, and 3500 shields with my crap drone skills, so they tanks quite good. 50m sig radius and 550m/s lets them speed tank quite well. I'd be confident using Augmented Vespas.
---
Times were 12,13,12 for gamma and 10,9,10 for exotic
---
Yes.
---
In what world AUTZ starts at 0100et? That's like 11am
---
groups like warp to me, the valhalla project have their incursion fits posted online, you can look them up
---
hecate is used for level 4 fw missions, don't know about invasion
---
You can see the luck on Hilturd's face of him thinking 'How much more do I need to listen to these nerds before the big Korean bucks roll in...'
---
Unfortunately the user must have take access to make a copy, start manufacturing, me research or te research because the user is physically moving the bpo from a container to a structure slot... take access is required.
---
Who's gonna light on a 300 mil ship when they can just use a 2 mil indy? If it were covert, it'd be a diff story.
---
Thanks for taking the time to write all this. I'm getting ready to stream this weekend you are very  helpful.
---
You used the wrong text bubbles.
---
What corp you in? Might contact your CEO and see how they did it.
---
Good point.
---
They could also make it so covops only jumps to covops cynos. That would require a bit more training for covops alts and it wouldn't be so fucking easy to drop some stealth stuff on people.
---
Or "Only Buy Plex"
---
Only titans. Supers arent worth dread bombing individually imo
---
Awesome tips. Thanks.
---
Yeah, I saw this the moment i posted it. &gt;.&lt;!!
---
I can agree - if GGG ever impliments Guild v. Guild and market that doesn't require you to go party up &amp; trade then I see a mass migration happening.
---
Anomalies always spawn within 8au, but I have abused incursions to make some great safes.
---
Anyone who doesn't want to 'burn their defenseless Indy ship deep into enemy territory'?
---
Thanks!
---
Either that or they are just rather brash about it.
---
well... my gameplay is to hunt the \~elite pvpers\~ and I have been one of the most vocal here - where do I fall?
---
yeah i think ill go with basic safe stuff, I don't even think ill be important enough to snipe xD
---
You are one of my new favorites now ❤️
---
this is exactly what it is, if not it will been spun in the end as some glorious *"bot purge strategy where we totally gottem all guys!"*
---
The regional historical data encompasses public and private structures.  This is easily verified when a major group moves, such as when Horde moved to TKE and regional volumes changed drastically.  Most large alliances dominate the region with their primary market, so the data is usable when treated as a fuzzy upper limit.  As previously mentioned, more detailed history would require a custom solution.
---
I've seen third party market websites that offered some historical data via API as well, but I'm not sure if any are currently offering it.  They're subject to the same limitations as the rest of us.
---
!Remindme 2 months "Did ccp spin Chaos theory as a way to destroy all the bots in an effort to save face?"

Fuck yeah you showed him. Fucking retard lost a ship WHAT A FUCKING NOOB FUCK. Why would he even spend so much isk on a rattlesnake when he can fly a carrier or a haw dread for that price. God idiots like him are proof that skill injectors don’t inject skill:
---
/s
---
D'aww thanks my dude. Just a bro trying to help a bro find his place in this grimdark universe &lt;3
---
the difference between guns and missiles might be caused by the fact that missiles are their own entity. the damage from the guns is directly from your ship, but missiles launched from your ship deal damage on their own.
---
this is just a thoght, the game does register the origin of the missiles but all sorts of things could be going on when it comes to ai target prioritization.
---
Not for nothin, Eve Echoes is pretty fucking good.

So you're saying quadrupling the alpha of artillery  had nowhere near the effect of quadrupling the ehp of freighters... neat.

If you pay other people to do your work for you that's like 500mil though :(
---
&gt;Wormholes
---
meh, id try it i guess but i dont see this bringing much change people will just crit the hole instead of rolling it to rat, people who have never really spent much time in spooky space have this idea that rolling your hole makes you safe for 2 hours, when its the incoming wormholes I worry about. the one that could have just been rolled with a fleet waiting on the other side.  hows about more statics and more wandering holes? more scrams in C3 sites and above.  
---
oooh a module that slowly regens holes both in mass and time(maybe scripted), nothing worse than knowing content is 1 jump away but you know if you risk it you will split your fleet or find your self stranded.   
---
&gt; Citadels 
---
yes to everything but the guns turning off and the damage cap. also changes to asset safety yes please.  
---
&gt; LowSec 
---
never spent much time in LS something ive been meaning to change but i digress, gate sliding sounds bad should be addressed. ive also had thoughts on changing how plexes work to more of an instanced pocket for managed pvp kinda like a filament that takes you to an arena with boundaries and a timer, keep the same types with same restrictions but add tiers or something t1 solo t2 nano t3 small gang t4 open, while this would take some of the organic components of finding pew and the whole escalation counter escalation thing it would also help get rid of risk-averse LP farmers/botters.  i believe alot of people would be interested in qued pure pvp fights. best part is once you are in the filament waiting, you cant leave if you get a bad matchup and you cant bring friends once your in. faster to find fights with equal fleet sizes.  
---
&gt; Local Chat/Blackout 
---
maybe a local corp/alliance Chanel but we all know what ccp and chat channels are like, also nothing stopping you from o/ in local  
---
&gt; Cyno Changes 
---
cyno changes need to be looked at again. they are going in the right direction by removing the insta blob when you get tackled ratting. but current changes seem kinda harsh. a few more ships being able to fit cyno would be good as long as they are rubish for pve.   
---
&gt; Ship Balance 
---
battleships scan res and warp speed YES!. altho a lot of ships need some love tho.  
---
&gt; Gankers on Trade Hub Undocks 
---
this hits home for me not because i haul shit but because i have horrible ping. i have died before even seeing my ship/what was on grid. so a limited tether or something would be nice.   
---
&gt;NPE
---
they are just going to keep changing it. and its never going to prepare a new player for shit.
---
WHY DO I HAVE TO STAY UP TO 4AM ON A TUESDAY TO KILL A CITADEL???? WHY DO THEY HAVE PERMAJAMS???
---
Perhaps they should just queue up the Academy Award music once he drags on too long.
---
I can’t tell if this is bait or just pure stupidity
---
This is not correct, they need query access to the hanger containing the BPO and take access from the hanger the copy will be delivered to.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You then organize the take hanger into cans for everyone who has take access to get their copies from

You can see his titan's name on d-scan. It's in Cyrillic. Dude is probably Russian.

---
I like this new meme, and the one with the bored looking Hilturd
---
Less players would mean less jumps and less ships kills. That's just not showing. Less bots means less NPC kills.  Clearly shows proof of that.
---
Normally when a Goon Titan gets attacked, he needs a minute to join standing fleet and get to the right room in comms to call for help, then take the ozone out of his fleet hangar so he can light a cyno. Then a huge fleet of faxes and caps comes to save his ass. This guy couldn't light a cyno because an inhibitor onlined just as he landed. The video skipped ahead so we can't see exactly how the fleet got there but they were too late.
---
I hope u get unbanned so they can do it again then.
---
This made me laugh and was true. Have a gold.
---
Thank you for the comments.  There are some very smart and passionate people here and some simple changes could help appease many different play styles in different regions
---
My sympathies to the rest of the CSM for having to listen to his dogshit for 4 days
---
And a half
---
Yeah, eve-hr exists. I forgot about it though since I've only ever used the two that I linked.
---
It's amazing that mar5hy knows this and he still can't do it, despite all the collaboration from y'all lately.
---
I got this some days ago on 2 of my 3 new alts. I even told them I need no help (but thx) and they were only scanner alts.
---
I still got a Venture and a Scanner Frigate for free. Very nice. I stored them in our home to give them to new players, when they arrive here.
---
why are you booing him? He's right.
---
Could be worse
---
people don't gank freighters with artillery outside of memey gimmicks
---
the quadrupling of alpha doesn't quadruple the DPS, likewise
---
have you ever ganked before?
---
Katia is in Signal Cartel. Her corp mates were supporting her.
---
&gt;I only remembered fat Hilmar, so good for him

He's probably due for a breast reduction. The hardest part is the loose skin.

---
Please, just stop.  
---
This "meme" you're so forcibly trying to provoke isn't taking on because it's so fucking uncreative and not fun in the slightest.  
---
While we're at it, please cease your anti-CCP/blackout 2x daily thread spam.  
---
At this point I'd be completely ok with mods 1mo banning anyone with goon flair spamming this garbage.
---
Versatile as in "leading different types of small gang fleet of agile cruisers and frigates of various types", sure. But the use would still be just an FC ship in different types of fleets, not quite enough to justify t3 status to me.
---
I'm thinking essentially the different types of frigates that exist, with some variation. Logi, agility/speed, offense, defensive, covert/scanning. There would need to be a decently long "onlining" period while you switch, perhaps 5-15 seconds, unlike the t3d near instant swap, again so as to not invalidate their particular feel and to slightly nerf getting to pick your exact modes.
---
So, for a real use case, lets say I'm trying to get a decent fight in lowsec, but there is some camped nullsec between me and the target system. I would equip covert and agility, and turn on the agility buff to have better align time and/ or warp speed. Making my way through the camped null, I warp to a safe that I have in system, and activate the covert mode, onlining a cloak as well. I sit cloaked until I am reasonably sure that my out gate is not being watched as heavy, uncloak, activate agility mode, and move on my way. Once I get into my lowsec system of choice, I dock and unequip my current 2 subsystems, equipping both the defensive and offensive subs, moving towards a plex or whatever my fight arena of choice is. I get a fight, I begin in offensive mode, and my tank is breaking fast due to the enemy using blasters with void. I start to switch to defensive mode to bolster my tank, but I was too late and end up popping. 
---
I could have chose to fit the agility/speed subsystem instead of the defensive and try to kite him instead, which would have went better in my favor if I had the foresight to have it activated once I knew what my opponent was flying, or began in defensive to try and outbrawl him. It would have these types of interesting fitting (strategic) and mid fight mode swaps (tactical) choices that I think the game needs more of.
---
Ha I don't even have a cyno alt. Outplayed.
---
sig browser across multiple systems is a buff to hunters, more so with the blackout.  This in fact makes wormhole space safer, no browser to advertise what is being run in the next hole in your chain
---
Here is a clue...
---
http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-2019.png
---
thb many people play the game for the unique community and not for the game. Now they are just removing the game part out of the equation.
---
This made me lol irl!
---
you can't get dread funding for dreads that can't undock :P
---
truth hurts
---
Not quite -- better way to say is the producers of EVE (equiv to Product Managers) job is to balance customers (paying users), business (boss &amp; parent company) and technical constraints to continue to drive EVE forward. 
---
This would be measured through a few KPI's -- one of which is revenue, but revenue can be part of the story. It can often be at the end of other long-tail impact, so you may strive for growth with an eye to grow base of customers (characters), which is more important number than revenue in short-medium term. Example measures around there would be... 
---
* \# New Alpha accounts 
---
* \# New Omega accounts
---
* % Conversions (Free &gt;&gt; Paid)
---
* % Regressions (Paid &gt;&gt; Free)
---
Maybe you want some other metrics to sanity check that you're attracting new customers, not just growing among existing user base, e.g.: # of omega accounts per email address/IP/Computer, etc.
---
I could go on, but wanted to just say that revenue &amp; pleasing parent company is usually indirect. Best way to do this usually is to make an awesome product your customers want, then find very meaningful measures that you use to track growth, engagement and satisfaction.
---
Im surprised noone else but you did that tbh. Worked well for a while but like you said it does have its counter.
---
It happened quite awhile ago, this post is just about guiness.
---
He sounds like a piece of shit.
---
yeah but I eventually found a counter to the counter that was then countered but I countered that and then... I started a new job and got busy irl.
---
Again, useless tactics against a cloaking hunter, who would ever warp to a site at 0? But the fact that you’ve been spared all this time ... impressive nonetheless :)
---
This feels like a non-serious post lol
---
He was/is.
---
Player Experience I think it is
---
or people aren't semi-afk'ing VNIs anymore... people forget the VNI nerf came at the same time and contributed to a lot of alts not doing anything anymore
---
you kill ship but do not destroy valuable pod [secret documents/data] you kill actual pod pilot..in rorqual clone vat you prepare new capsule and new clone... one of interdictors pilots simulates death to fool  his pod computer to spawn new clone,then he reconnects while empty clone is spawned..now pod with dead pilot is scooped by rorqual then fresh clone replaces dead body in  captured pod,fresh clone collects all essential data stored in pod computers/databanks now new clone leaves the  captured pod and heads to interdictor pod,then  interdictor pod pilot is killed but now computer is fooled that  pod pilot is alive [to prevent spawning next clone] . then this new clone enters  interdictor pod.

Vily needs some vitamins.
---
Me too fellow wormholer!! Updooted xD
---
Don't you think logically? For the entire month of August this year we have near same numbers of jumps and ship kills from last year. If players left in droves, wouldn't those numbers be lower? Wouldn't we see a major decrease in jumps and ship kills? Or are they just magically finding more people to kill with less people? Maybe they're working twice as hard?
---
It's obvious the huge decrease is due to major bot farms leaving. Seeing as you're a goon, perhaps you lost some income there. I feel bad for you. Really.
---
or tornado
---
It loads a lot of unnecessary page, which takes longer, and has a white background which blows
---
The counter is that it’s fucking boring and most people can’t be bothered
---
[Sigh]...
---
Yes that was called Chaos Era causing the change in data. You cannot compare two years with complete different game mechanics. 
---
But of course I don't think logically because I have a different opinion to you...
---
PS&gt; Here is your second clue - Read my name backwards and you should know I am as far from being a goon as it gets.
---
**seething**
---
How are your social skills? Do you have the skill trained that increases your pay?
---
Also, get the Social to 5 and your standings go up faster so you can do higher level missions for better pay.
---
Idk how lowsec missions differ from highsec in mechanics, hopefully some9ne else can address that.
---
Literially all data  have gone down, and your statement about “less players would mean less jumps and less ship kills” is Bs bc most of the null regions arent even on that top 10 list of the jumps and ship kills of both months.
---
You can still afk wih a domi or myrm though.
---
Lower security agents pay better. But they also risk sending you into Low / Null sec for missions. There's a radius most agents will send you. I don't recall the number, but say it's within 5 jumps. If your Agent is in 1.0, then about the worst place they could send you would be 0.5. But if your Agent is in 0.5 already, they could send you to 0.0.
---
Damn dude, he has kids.
---
Missions from normal agents don't differ, as they draw from the same pool of content.  There would be no tangible difference running a level 1 mission in low sec than in hi.  
---
Epic arcs and level 5 missions are located in low sec, exclusively so for level 5 missions, and pay out a decent amount more than level4s.
---
People still need to adapt to that and may not have done so or just not bothered with their alts due to summer etc. 
---
I can only speak of an alliance bro who had 20 VNI's on the go over two systems which he has now left to go alpha and no longer uses them.
---
Hes a pretty handsome dude right?
---
This. Is. EVE.
---
That is somehow peak CVA
---
If you lose ships you're shit. If your alt lands 6km away with the cap boosters you needed, you're extra shit :(
---
That alone convinces me that the VNI nerf in combination with the blackout were good for the game.
---
And the blackout will be mitigated with a soon™ to be announced new structures.
---
Just a random idea for the low sec part. How about special plexes that only allow 2 players in, just for the sake of pvp. Every time I try I get a small group on top of me in stead of a fun 1v1 in my t1 frigate or destroyer. Dont change them all just some of them that maybe dont give any reward except for just 1v1 a random person in the same size ship class? If people want it mor fancy add rules like in the abyssal pvp room.
---
It's been dying since birth. Just like the many of us.
---
I cant imagine anchoring bubble camps or clearing bubble camps is particularly enjoyable. Haven't done much of either but using dreads and dropping titans on those dreads seems far more fun in my opinion VoV
---
A mod, call it something like a Mass Repairer or Mass Injector, that is used on a hole to give it mass/stabilize it. Make it be able to live longer up to a point.
---
&gt; this hits home for me not because i haul shit but because i have horrible ping. i have died before even seeing my ship/what was on grid. so a limited tether or something would be nice. 
---
There already is. After undocking you are untargetable for a short amount of time
---
I really like that idea for two reasons.
---
1. Abyssal PVP rooms are severely bugged and dont spawn most of the day .
---
2. This prevents the blob and encourages 1v1
---
Sadly it's not available in US yet (at least that's why I figure it doesn't work for me)
---
I think the real problem is that d-scan is dog shit itself... The interface no automatic scanning no easy way to sort filters on the fly without fucking up the overview.
---
D scan is what I hate the most about the black out. Also the only thing I hate. That shit ass ui. The dumb fuck requirement to spam a button.... 
---
They should have reworked d scan before rolling out the black out.
---
Lower sec is higher LP gains, and to any serious mission runner LP is the bread and butter.
---
Weird, its an easy train from vni to mrym or domi since the drone skills are there already. A level 4 domi can afk on rally points and forsaken hubs. 
---
The ship is more expensive but insures pretty well, so its not too difficult to replace.
---
The saltminer Blue doughnut's haven't trained Harden past 0.
---
With the folks moving back into hisec and lowsec, it seems the LP markets have tanked a little.  Just throwing that out there.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I do not disagree, I personally think for some people they just went "arghhh fuck it"
---
Flair checks out
---
&gt;sadly
---
:thinking:
---
but as soon as you try and warp - POP you get nado'd.  Also, there are usually ships placed on the undock to bump people warping straight to undocks.  CCP can at least explain this during the new bro experience..
---
Lots of new people joining HS corps from null since it's not safe anymore.    
---
Mine is planning on moving out there once it empties more :)
---
I agree 100% !   D Scan could use a serious rework.  I was hoping they would have done this after the did the probe scan windows.
---
I was able to bridge just fine to an industrial cyno on sisi.  Bridged in a recon.
---
Wait, so what about me who didn't get blown up and didn't leave system but stopped ratting. How would my data show up?
---
You know, just because you can type alot of words it doesnt mean your intelligent.
---
You know back before jump freighters we actually used to have fleet ops to travel to high sec to dump loot and resupply. Scouts, escort ships, bunch of industrials, other alliances scouting and trying to catch us, ect.      
---
That was fun. Seriously compared to then....
---
The correct course of action for the wrong reason still makes sense.
---
CVA does have a pretty cool logo.
---
Sounds like a good time aside from the CSM part from what I hear.
---
And yet you crop out the only one of them who's ever been in a wormhole.
---
Wonder if the more than 20 thousand banned botting/rmt accounts so far this year might have anything to do with that.

I like using the claw as a pure bumping ship. I can fit it to go 13km/s heated

The CSM part took up the bulk of time. We did 8-10 hour days of meetings for 4 days. It was fairly exhausting. People at work are like 'how was vacation!' Due to my work schedule I'd leave work, get on my plane, fly to iceland, do CSM for 5 days, and come home and go back to work the next day. :P
---
It was interesting. I found some favorite places to eat there. But I didn't do tourist stuff outside of restaurant sampling.
---
Dscan is quite imperfect intel actually bud, it doesn't necessarily even tell you if it's a friend or not and there are ships which don't show up on it as well as modules to hide areas of space from dscan.
---
That's exactly what I'm doing. Comparing two years with different mechanics.... before blackout and after blackout. How else would you compare the cause and effect of something?

not just blackout... VNI Nerf.. FFS mate go read the patch notes.

Funny thing about that - Matterall: "Here's the thing, people will cry... about the smallest things when actuality it's not hurting them that much." You guys cry, "+1 ammo is bad!" But skill injecting into super-capital is A-ok. Ha. Welcome to the great correction - Chaos.

"I couldn't come up with anything to keep EVE viable and CCP an independent Icelandic company.  I can't come up with anything now, but I have bosses in Korea who over emphasis the word "competence."

Where is my bonus check?"  \~Hilmar as he begun his roller coaster descent into unemployment.
---
You know ive been digging for hours and youre right. 
---
You never said you were a wormholer. But you took the spot where wormhole representation normally sits on the csm since csm 7. 
---
When 7 of the 10 csm reps elected are aligned to one group of players, it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth when you are no longer represented because you litterally cannot game the election on the same scale.
---
Mobile classes shouldn't have enhanced awareness.  
---
Realistically, unless the 64bit client has changed things, all hulls are limited to the same d-scan range.  Would make sense to have a change, but heavy and specialized ships should have more awareness anyway.
---
If you want a buff to interceptors intercepting things, nerf d-scan to make the information is presents be very generic, and make it lean towards conveying more information about big and noisy objects rather than small objects.  
---
Ideally, you want a situation where frigs and drones are hard to spot apart from background noise except at short ranges, and you want cloaky or d-scan nullified ships to basically have the scan profiles of drones.
---
Next up, make scanning drones be able to technically be able to find anything, but potentially take hours to triangulate the very faintest signals.
---
Tbh it's not a massive difference tho is it
---
Well that sucks for your funding then, I heard we are reprocessing all of them to provide free myrms to all of eve. Will be none to kill
---
Bot evasion is easy to do if you are correctly setup. Anyone here will know that when a bot gets banned, within a few hours another takes its place. This is not new news and well documented on here, so no banning 20k bots (which they do anyway every year) has had no real effect.

Dropped out last year. How’s the daily numbers now?  Still dropping?

You mean all those years when CCP announced in advance changes it was making after taking player feedback, and then implementing them all at once?  Yeah fuck those years am I right?

T3c nullified cloaky higgs Loki at least could still warp thru a bubble as of a month ago.

Why not just get rid of BPOs altogether?

Make them into a permanent isk sink where players have to *subscribe* the IP holder (NPC faction), and the price fluctuates based on it's popularity.

 HILMAR TOOK AN INDEPENDENT ICELANDIC COMPANY AND GROUND IT DOWN TO THE POINT OF ACQUISITION.  VIKINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO PLUNDER AND GET BITCHES, NOT GET PLUNDERED AND END UP BITCHES.
---
Last I checked you can rat without a VNI. About 110 million rats found that out. 
---
Bottom line, null has more risk involved. Less bots. And the decline is not as bad as people are making it seem. Sit back and enjoy the game.
---
I made a commercial. That’s how I won. And I offered, after I won, to pass on to the Devs concerns from the WH community because they didn’t have representation. That, along with our HK eviction, was apparently a heinous crime for which I will never be forgiven.

Good post.  
---
The upshot is BOTS are shut down, hard. More removed in one month than ever before. Think of Chaos as a war on bots.
---
Sure you are in a tough spot, no doubt. The thing is, I've heard it before when Phoebe jump changes came ( I lost many friends), and when new sov hit, when the Rorq lost ore-condensing. I don't know if Jester's numbers are good or faulty. The numbers I've seen are not nearly as bad as these.
---
Incompetence from the top? thats narrative I hear a lot and it is wrong IMO. In the TIS interview, Hilmar showed his profound grasp of what makes EVE last 16 years and its WAY more complicated than expected. The secret to EVE certainly isn't "making people happy."
---
They will ride the cash cow as long as they can.
---
Not even remotely close to reality.

Oh i was talking about him giving warpins on stuff in test space and yall hanging out on discord/voice comms a collaboration.

Yeah not too bad that the game has tanked nearly 50% in avg players over a 12 month period.. But hey it's cool as when the lights go off like 10 years before it could have, just remember to sit back and do nothing and enjoy... FML you are retarded.

Go look at the comment from the other guy who tried to call me out and spent seven hours to find nothing. Even if you were assed, you won’t find anything because there ain’t nothing. It’s just salt from the most humorless shut ins in the game.

hahahaha congrats  for the kill
---
Oh no, someone giving intel to an fc on a target to kill when they know you're hunting. It's almost like goons have never worked with neutral groups before that kill them regularly *cough snuff test panfam black legion pandemic legion cough*
---
Fun fact though, a colossal belt is something anyone can warp to.
---
As long as my friends n line members are enjoying fights against neutral entities instead of complaining about player count I'll take that as a win. Maybe you missed the other dozens of drops against anything not blue where several of us have wasted hours n hours trying to find targets for my friends to enjoy shooting.
---
Nah I like too many people in goons. The 20% that aren't brain dead or spurgs complaining about player count are great to play with.
---
your comment is worded confusingly so im not sure what you mean but if youre asking whats going on to spur all of these posts and are out of the loop the two main changes everyone is currently mad about for many reasons (with varying levels of validity) is because of the nullsec blackout (local in null is like wh space) and cyno changes (only force recon can use normal cynos, jump freighters can now only use indsutrial cynos which can only be fitted to indsutrial ships (haulers) , which are slow and week)
---
bring back passive moon poses in ls
---
kthxback
---
Try close to 20% from last year. With an already declining trend. Factoring the bots leaving and school it all seems pretty normal. There was actually an increase in players after the blackout.
---
It's not our job to fix their fucking game that we pay to enjoy, they broke it and are breaking it further.

Sorry it was a stream of consciousness thing. I get you, so the joke is that CCP killed the game and is blaming null sec. I was thinking there was more to it.

---
Oh look. Another Eve is doomed post. Haven't seen that one a million times in the last week. 
---
In all seriousness, it's amazing to see the salt and rage quits when the large krabbing alliances play style gets nerfed.
---
 When they nerfed small gang play style by making super caps the new frigate fleet, none of the big alliances said anything or complained. When they came out with haw weapons and fighters that can track frigates, the null blocs said nothing. When they introduced bosons that could eliminate an entire fleet the null blocs said nothing. 
---
Take away local making space more dangerous and disabling near2 apps without Intel on gates, the null blocs rage quit, unsub and continuously post negative numbers on Reddit to point out that Eve is dying. 
---
Take away cynos from capitals making them rely on another character to save them, the null blocs unsub their remaining accounts. 
---
I get that your play style is being nerfed into the ground and now you have to either change or leave but welcome to the fucking party. 
---
Small gang was continuously nerfed into the ground for years and the null blocs laughed it off and said get better or quit. 
---
So get better or quit. 
---
If this kills the game, it will be ironic that the null alliances that used to be known for their sub cap PvP prowess left the game because capitals and super capitals  got the Nerf bat. 
---
Krabbing in null blocs used to be viewed as necessary to afford PvP and not a primary form of entertainment. Mining used to be laughable and made fun of. 
---
Goonswarm used to kill capitals with swarms of frigates and now complains when a capital dies to a swarm of frigates. 
---
Test alliance took space before having more than a few titans, let alone a whole fleet. 
---
Pandemic legion used to be the supercap power bloc and are now turtled under the pamfam umbrella
---
Provibloc is probably one of the least changed alliances due to everyone roaming in their space making them one of the least industrialist blocs, but ironically, they provide some of the best fights. 
---
I'll be here to the end and we may be on a downward slope, but holy shit people,  we get it already. You don't like the changes and they are hurting the daily login numbers. You don't have to post it 20,000 times a day.

Can confirm. -1 human (36 accounts).
---
Because those models are totally priced to move, right?
---
Then I think your argument has changed from your previous comment.
---
I'd like to see the D-Scan mechanic improved to combat the loneliness that the Blackout has caused. If D-Scan was improved so that it shows the colour status of players when you scan them, then it would be a much better system. 
---
Allies would appear in blue text for example. 
---
This way players are still completely reliant on their D-Scan. But when you scan down your mate from the same Alliance your ship sends out a signal that you can recognise as a non-threat.
---
You just let us keep doing whatever we want and see how that works out for you then. That or ya know...try.

mate.. please stop posting. You have no idea what you are talking about.

But hey this is just stats collected directly from CCP... You can just ignore the data and run with your own blinded Stockholm syndrome narrative.
---
Think about it - there was time (after eve launch) when PCU was much lower than it is today, and game was still playable and fun. 
---
Maybe we should just enjoy the game (or not play it if not) instead of thinking too much about this number that is not related to actual fun in-game.
---
D Scan needs a complete rework - it looks and works like from a game made in 1988.
---
Yes after the biggest ban wave ever.

That man really lose some weight

FUCK OFF

Dude, we have ships that can warp or just burn around with their engines for an infinite amount of time using zero fuel, pretty sure they have 'eat once and never be hungry' again kind of food for capsuleers.
---
Go away
---
jebus what a low effort shit post
---
So what you're saying is that in the past CCP always made good decisions and this is suddenly different?
---
Yes! Excellent response. So true.
---
Roquals should never of became a mining ship it should of stayed the way it was a mining support ship
---
What I’m saying, or should have said is the d scan should be overhauled to allow diversity across ship platforms. Smaller scout frigates could have larger au scan distance, perhaps vague details at 20 au. Then anything within 10 is a bit more specific like ship class. As an example. There is a fair bit of different intel that every ship in the game has that is identical to each other. Mix it up.
---
70% null is blued up, 20% is too small to face that head on, so, no war. This was true before blackout, it's true now.
---
https://link_to_that_one_jester_trek_post.htm

I agree 100%. I just started playing DOTA 2. How did I never play this game before?! I have all these games on steam I never played that I can spend some time on now.  Thank you blackout!
---
Vily looks like he's thinking "I gave up being Captain of the Orville to oversee these peace talks in New Eden. What a mistake."
---
i mean you can switch ships, she did
---
I'm in favor of the cyno changes (but that's mostly cause as a fw corp with a bunch of alpha members in ls caps are basically uncontestable for us). I do think they are probably to restrictive and should instead expand to include a cheaper option for when you want to escalate caps so you can feed them; probably about 70 mil so t2 destroyer-ish.
---
As far as low sec is concerned plexes need some serious love. To start with shooting pirates that enter a plex shouldn't fuck up your sec status since frigate fights are often dependent on the first few seconds. I also think plexes should be more restrictive and work similar to novices. Every plex should allow only t1/faction ships of it's size in and t2 of smaller sizes.
---
TBH, I see no problem with the end of disposable cyno alts.
---
agreed

Shame you did not change the comp vid screen to show a domi..

Fuckoff boomer, how is that for grammar?

The thing i'm mostly interested in after watching this is the cynabal fit, lol.
---
I've been messing around in pyfa with for a dual-prop fit, but i always did some variation of shield tank (either ancil booster or passive buffer) with some nanos, gyros and tracking mods in the lows. Basically, i was trying to fit it like a vagabond (either the old passive setups, or the new ancil fits after it got the shield boost bonus). It never occurred to me to try an armor tanked one but it seems reasonable, seeing as the base hull has almost equal shields and armor.
---
Looks like
---
full rack of autocannons, medium neut
---
mwd, ab, scram web, cap injector
---
ancil rep, regular rep, DC and 2 EANM
---
Can anyone confirm or, better yet, provide the actual fit?
---
Ha! I haven’t tried it either. I don’t hear anyone talk about it so it must be on par with D3 pvp
---
If only HTP would show up when provi dropped caps I’m sure that could be true.

If you were still doing it as of recently i would keep a low profile because that sounds like a serious bug.
---
Also if you didn't know any ship can warp to through a bubble as long as their intended target is not within 500km of the bubble. As bubbles cannot drag you out of warp unless you are in the deceleration stage of warping. And won't prevent you from warping unless you are inside their aoe or are warping to a point within 500km in line of it.
---
Dude. LOL. The bottom of your graph is not zero. Dumbass. OMG. Stop now. You're already an embarrassment.

Gotcha. I was thinking about coming back but RL is kicking my butt. Maybe I’ll resub and high sec mine ice. Probably not though.

Why even include the jumps and ship kills if none of those regions listed experienced a blackout?

Bruh, be the coalition that gets dropped on by the rest of Eve for 10 years and you'd be paranoid too.

I've been exploring C1-3 wormholes for the past week trying to find data/relic sites to do. Every time I jump into a wormhole, I get excited to see like 10+ sigs in the system and start scanning them down. All but a few disappear before I can even scan them to 25% and see what they are. Out of the few left, they're just wormholes or worthless data sites. 
---
What is going on? I know sites disppear when they are finished but are there that many cloaked Asteros/other explorers that are in the exact same few holes that I happen to travel through? It seems like every time I enter a wormhole, I waste 20 mins scanning down every sig only to find nothing. Then I travel to a new hole or two only to find the same thing.
---
It's getting super frustrating.

At least i make an effort to get my point across, as opposed to you. I mean, if you're so lazy to articulate your own opposing viewpoint, why should i be convinced or even care about it? All your post says to me is

P.S. It's "you're" and not "your". I assume you went through enough of school to know this and you're smart enough (seeing as you're capable of operating a PC and playing a relatively complex game), but all these changes to the game must make you mad enough to lose your concentration and make basic mistakes. So let me extend my sincerest condolences on your recent suffering of multiple strokes over a video game.

I wouldn't do that. I'm not really sure why others "be the alliance that gets messed with all the time" but I'm happy someone's doing it for the game.

Your ship comes out up to 15 degrees off the undock direction. After 10s you will likely be too far out of alignment for the undock to work.

HTP probably has more provi cap kills than any other group in the game.

I find it easier to give gold to people that pretty much say what i believe is wrong with eve without having to put the effort into typing it up. So here you go. Just like it's easier for me to give reddit real life money now than ccp for the beloved game they have trashed the last couple months.

I dabbled, and I reached the following conclusion: It's D3's matchmaking PvP combined with D2's 0.03 second kills.

I did not do any PvP during the endgame so maybe it gets more fun then, but I doubt it reaches PvE levels anyway.

Using an industrial to move between locations would be a terrible idea. You didn't move between locations in a corvette before, did you?

Small correction/addendum to the second point on your list:
---
&gt;The reversal of the proposed changes to having an industrial cyno on one  of the slowest and least agile of subcaps because people complained  about having to train into covert cynos (or the lack of cyno vigils lol)  was insanely stupid on ~~CCP's~~ *the players'* part, *who will routinely bitch and moan out of principle before even trying out the proposed changes in practice, then bitch and moan some more when CCP caves in to their original complaints and demands.*
---
:P
---
Other than that, mostly good points.
---
You claim 50% and post that shit? Wow... check the chart bro. Please before you make another post.
---
What argument was it?
---
You didn't know that this guy, who's a member of Signal Cartel, worked with Signal Cartel to do his thing?
---
&gt; because resupplying cynos for mids would be cancer with them being 20k m3, and setting up new routes would require gating very vulnerable ships around in possibly hostile space.
---
While this is true for the finished ships, the minerals required are tiny by comparison. 717m³ for a nereus, at 0 ME - easy to ship basically anywhere to assemble an industrial in any lowsec station with manufacturing (or a raitaru of course if you've set up your own midpoints). It's not as huge a problem as you seem to suggest with considering only fully assembled ships. :)
---
Thanks a bunch mate.
---
Thx bby

^^ Just going to leave that there for you to read again. 
---
(PS. The clue is "nearly") 
---
(PPS. Notice it's not edited)
---
you’re doing plenty of screeching that’s for sure
---
might have been true in the past. Now days there is only one umbrella in provi and it ain't proviblocs.
---
So it's working. Null shouldn't be a bot haven or a place for 20 afk VNI alts. I could give a shit what they do in high sec, but null needed more risk.
---
I know CCP Rise likes the idea of dueling area's in the game.  The abyssal duals have potential if they actually spawned more often and throughout all TZs.  The can prob make complexes in FW space to only allow 2 people to enter at once
---
hit the nail on the head
---
what’s that saying, “die quietly”?
---
Looks like you post wasted as well.
---
Generally speaking highsec L4s are pretty ass cash-wise. Are you in a corp? If not, get in one -- a good one, preferably, that does things you like to do. (Unless you are just going to PvE forever in which case maybe not).
---
What if I were to tell you there was something fundamentally wrong with how safe null was before the blackout, and that rapid change was necessary? Lots more needs to happen, but these people who are leaving got used to something that was broken and needed to be fixed.
---
&gt; Citadels: Low power citadels should not have tethering. No fuel, no invincibility ring. Defensive weapons should be turned off and the damage cap removed also if low power. When a POS stick ran out of fuel, the guns stopped working and the shields went down, no one ever complained. Perhaps remove asset safety when citadels go Low Power the same as POS's were? This will incentivise the destruction of citadel span in HS also.
---
I think that, once the old POS code has been removed, CCP could use the old assets to put a new system in place where you anchor individual modules and link them together, allowing players to build their own starbase complexes like what you find in deadspace sites. With that implemented they could limit the number and type of citadels a corporation is allowed to anchor, though the specifics of these limitations would need to be weighed carefully.
---
This would essentially make citadels (and possibly other Upwell structures) like actual historical [citadels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel); hardened, well-fortified structures that require considerable effort to destroy when compared to the more delicate anchored structures. This way big alliances and corps would have to create complexes instead of just spamming citadels everywhere.
---
Whether or not this would allow relatively small corporations to carve out their own place in New Eden by building a citadel is something I'm not certain about, but I hope it would at least be a step in that direction.
---
I also have another suggestion for CCP: make it impossible to apply skill points to the Advanced Spaceship Command, Capital Ships, and racial dreadnought/carrier/titan skills. Players can inject as many skill points as they want but in order to use a capital ship they have to do it the old-fashioned way. This would kill off the rampant capital and supercapital proliferation that the game is dealing with now, and hopefully buy everyone enough time to figure out another solution.
---
I'll just assume you think 18 is 50% of 22. Cry yourself to sleep tonight. It's ok.
---
As if the game provides no way to spring a trap and actually find out one way or the other. You just can't quite figure out how to do it can you?
---
Cool beans.
---
The sandbox was structured in such a way that the balance was tipped significantly in one direction. That meant that the empire building stage of null thrived, with alliance intel and staggering inflation. This has been remedied by an evening of the playing field, or perhaps even a tip of the balance in favor of the hunter. CCP has said that they intend to add more rewards to null, bringing the balance closer to neutral.
---
You guys forgot to light the covert cyno in the center of the anus

It hit the iceberg and is taking on water.  Hilmar is rearranging the deck chairs before she slides quietly into the cold North Atlantic.

You sound angry... so I guess here is your answer op :)
---
Hell, if/when the Triglavians actually start moving into K-space, maybe they could set up proving grounds where players could fight one-on-one or even in small fleet actions against each other.
---
One of them was a video of getting maximum of ticks by even using the heavy fighter bombs at the right time to almost completely alpha some waves off of Haven's.
---
So I don't think it was super lazy mode.
---
God what fun.
---
At least two of your mentioned regions are because of unrelated movements of alliances, like BOT’s consolidation in the drone lands and Ranger Regiments movement away from Tenal.
---
Cant get kills if you dont undock. :Thinking meme:
---
Can you do a character transfer to transfer a character from an alpha account to an omega?
---
last time I flew around htp space in a frig all I saw undock was a mach, bc's and a legion. thats not how you catch/bait stuff, maybe you just haven't figured out how to tackle stuff?
---
Back in my day, we gathered pilots together and escorted our (non-jump) Freighters through lowsec into null by gates
---

This would be great if it weren't for one thing, the rorqual is an indy ship. People keep bitching about not being able to kill then due to cap umbrellas and I feel like this is one of the biggest drives for cyno changes.
---
Nobody cares about that shit your game is trash. lol

---
That's my story and I'm sticking to it!
---
I'd agree with the loss of local making it less profitable to run sites in null (well it would be my guess, I'm not living in null so I can't say for sure) I'd guess making the rewards a bit bigger could be a right way to improve this situation, but not sure about that
---
back in line minion.
---
for someone outside of the loop what is cyno alts
---
the only thing lower than the effort you put in to this thread was your mother's standards on the night you were concieved.
---
Better give it a huge buff to boosts then as as they wouldn’t be worth fielding in their current state without mining drones
---
Yes, but McLootboxes come with a hamburger; that makes it alright.
---
I'm sure that if REGULAR loot boxes came with a burger, no one would mind them. You'd be guaranteed to get something good out of each one, and anyone who bought too many of them would end up in the hospital, rather than in-game.
---
So it would be better if they could be placed by a faster ship right?

WHY DOES EVERYONE SEEM TO THINK THAT NULLSECCERS CAN'T TRAIN RECON ALTS
---
Where to?
---
DAU has the same issue as peak concurrent if it's based off of the eve client count of concurrent users at any moment. What is the number based on?
---
If it doesn't record unique users a guy staying logged in for 10 hours on a VNI spinning would count towards 10 intervals of the average compared to a guy logged in for 1 hour
---
I stand by my position that it's not the CSM's role to be game designers.
---
as of before any ship could use use cynos so yes it would be fine. The main issue is that it is very easy to catch them so its diffiuclt to get a cyno out to null and they take up too much space so if you have a normal route and can restock a midpoint, you could do that but it would take up an unreasonable amout of space cutting into cargo
---
yea so the issue was that people used corvvetes (literal free ships ) to do it. It would be reasonable if the new required ships had some level of price but had  actual surviablity in null
---
Theres also the issue of implementation. CCP has refused to give out the blueprints for the new cynos ahead of time so on day one nobodoy will have one
---
The nestor is a common addition
---
Sorry, I'm not following you.  I've never come across an active PLEX market in The Kalevala Expanse.  To my knowledge, hardly any PLEX changes hands outside The Forge.  Consumption of PLEX from a PLEX Vault for game time doesn't show up in market stats of course.
---
I've pulled historical volume data from multiple regions, including TKE (which has no NPC stations and I can't imagine there's a publicly available market).  It requires a request for the History for a specific region and typeid.
---
Those plexes should not be fw though. Eve is not a 1v1 game.
---
The foundational principle is solid, nrds is a decent idea, though in practice game mechanics make it a hard life. Why do it with that in mind, because somebody has to. It's sold as "an easy way into null" or it was back in my day, now the major blocs are much easier, but provi probably teaches the game better. You're much more likely to get in a 1v1 or small gang fight. You're much more likely to fight inexperienced hunters. You're more likely to experience flying out of doctrine and hopefully learning why that has advantages but mostly disadvantages. You're also always likely to have content, but also live at relative peace in many pockets knowing that the rest of the game basically wants you to exist and provibloc will probably never be evicted for any real length of time.
---
the nestor is so you can eject it into space and then use its mantainace bay to refit, like an instant mobile depot
---
One doesn’t need a lossmail to know this game is pure hot garbage with no hope of recovery.
---
oh, right...It couldn't be that your game is completely devoid of player skill and is an outlet for people who have gotten shit on in every other pvp game.    How is that no risk/reward "pvp" working out for you :)
---
The players wanted ratting to be changed/balanced, not a bandaid solution like blackout, the players wanted capitals to be balanced, not a bandaid solution like the cyno change. And protective blob umbrellas are just the reality of human nature.
---
I cant remember the specific person who said it, but they put it absolutely perfectly, CCP is trying as hard as it can to balance ratting and capitals without actually balancing ratting and capitals. And so now they are seeing the repercussions of their actions.
---
Plz next time you talk to Hillmar ask him directly how much he was directly paid by Pearl Abyss as part of the deal to sell CCP. Is Hillmar now a 100 millionaire or something else.

---
**Citadels -** Too reduce spam, should restricted to one per planet. Still makes a systems multi use but has a cap. Good for starting conflict, want a place in a system-Hi, Low, Null - fight for it.  Low power citadels should have one 24hr timer from the time of re-enforcement. Astras should only have one timer and higher dps cap, same for all small Upwell structures. 
---
**Ganking on Trade Hub's -**  Give all HiSec stations a tether, flame that if you want. 
---
**Wormholes -** I don't live there, others do. No ideas 
---
**Blackout/Intel -** Keep blackout, but add an Upwell structure that creates a local for sov holder. No timer, high dps cap, Sov 5, same maintenance cost as a jump bridge. Other uses, can scan cloaked ships. Underdeveloped space would be intel-less.
---
**Faction Warfare -** Here is where I would add "instance pvp." Replace plexs with a Plantside 2 system control tug-of-war through pve/pvp missions. Player in FW would receive missions from whatever faction command to move to the frontline and engage the enemy. Players, after entering the assigned system would receive a "warp too" bookmark and engage npc's in order to control the dungeon grid. No more button to orbit, all pew pew. Here is where the instance part comes in. Faction command will call for reinforcements through a "warp to faction FC" function. Players, in their own gangs/fleets, enter grid and pew pew. Players receive LP and small isk amounts for killing NPC/Players. System and be scaled up for massive instance fights, like kill the faction boss. Systems could be cyno jammed by NPC faction, something to fight over. System control though capturing progressively harder missions, think some kind of diamond npc's. Should be a great place for all those small/nano gangs, solo ,and small groups. No more LP farming by mission runner bots. 
---
**Ship balance -** CCP needs to iterate on the meta at least once a quarter. Make the Drake again CCPLZ 
---
**Mining -** Delete ore anomaly's, between belts and moons, they are not needed. Ore belts that deplete and regenerate overtime would create something of a crop rotation system. I think moons are in a good place. **Big change -  Delete excavator drones. Roll Rorquals back to a mining fleet support role, ore compressing,  on grid booster, Panic, bonus for shield reps, drone damage/speed/hitpoints, and 300km tractor beam range.** Make Orcas the capital mining "end game" ship. Give it a capital mining laser with massive range so it can cover those massive ore belts, bonus for mining drones and drone range. Cycle amount is up for discussion. Keep the ore hold at 150,000m, this will reintroduce jet can mining. Rorquals will tractor the can in to compressing ore. 
---
**Cyno Changes -** Roll back. Why !?
---
**Supers/Titans -**  Delete them. Capital ships are "easier" to balance without having to consider effects on Supers. They are more killable by subcaps and other caps.  
---
There, I engaged in constructive feedback.
---
Yup and hardly that because many will give up after 5.
---
&gt;I see a rise of Nullblocs popping into LS and just blobbing the shit out of it
---
Placid just wasn't the same after Goonswarm's deployment to Frarie in July.
---
Well, yes it is, I'm pointing out we are in close proximity to provi caps any time they are used, more frequently than any other group. So...we do show up when provi drops caps?
---
At least not as bad as right now. Their decisions are now getting plain stupid
---
The place is great. The NRDS policy has outlived its usefulness, especially now that you don't know who is in local anyway. The fact is, I like the region because it is disorganized to a degree and that chaos can be capitalized on. To clarify though, I don't understand why people who dislike what happens out there would stick around?
---
Thank you, good writeup!    
---
 I agree with much of this however I think local intel should be restricted to corp mates.  Too many people bugger off when 'local spikes' and it did give too much intel overall.
---
Uh...that literally gives them no distinction from AF. If we want 4 more AF fine but that's not what I'm suggesting. What you're describing is just standard power creep.
---
I guess they can do it in LS that is not FW space, it might drive content to those dead LS systems that dont have plex's
---
Show me on zkillboard where the gankers touched you
---
I dont actually mind them not telling me about changes. It makes the game feel kind of more organic. I do understand that for others the pre notified updates gave them a heads up and they liked to be informed.
---
Bots falling and Krabs stopping to krab due to blackout, AFK VNIs nerfed, so that's amplified the player count fall atm.
---
On the positive side, you have blue donut up in arms about these changes.
---
now do it with autopilot
---
I've always wondered why more groups don't live out of thera. The logistics aren't bad and there's just so many potential directions you can go. I know people get spooked by thera holes but still with that many exits the content should be endless.

Depleting assetts with occasional roaming.

Peeps outside goonswarm thought so because grr goons. 
---
So what?
---
They dead Jim. All that's left is hanger ons trying to pimp the name built of former glory.
---
But if you get 2 of those in diff points in system you can make a spot between
---
I probably cant help too much tbh, it's been like 3 years since I last ran missions. But I'll try.  
---
First things first, faction warfare missions are totally different from regular mission running, with different rules, different ships being optimal and different rewards. Faction warfare missions will always send you to lowsec, they are somewhat easier to complete (because they're intended to be run in PVP fit ships) and when your warp to the site,  your location will be broadcasted to the entire system (so you're really exposed). On the plus side, if you can do level 4 FW missions without dying every mission there is pretty decent isk to be had in doing them. Battleships are terrible for FW missions. The Stratios or MWD cloaking cruisers are very common for these, since they are slippery in lowsec but can still run the missions.
---
Second, when fitting for conventional highsec level 4 missions (what you probably mean to do), I have heard of the rule of 1000, and it seems to be a good guidline. When you build your first level 4 mission battleship, you want to be able to tank X EHP/S (verses the relevant NPCs) and deal Y DPS, such that X+Y=1000. So if your in a Drake battlecruiser (which can do Level 4 missions) and only do 250 DPS, you probably should be able to tank 750 DPS. OTOH, if you're in a Rattlesnake and deal 1200 DPS, it's probably OK if you can only tank 200 DPS (you'll kill the high damage enemies so quickly that it won't really matter). 
---
Third, also on fitting, whatever ship you pick should have decent damage projection (being able to shot at 20 kM is not enough, it will take you forever to get in range of targets... 60 is more like it with a long or mid range ammo), while also being able to kill frigates (in level 4 missions the frigates can sometimes warp disrupt you). All battleships have drone bays, so any battleship is good enough at hitting NPC frigates. Just make sure you have a full flight of 5 light or medium drones, preferably with a few spares. If you chose the Mega, you should run Railguns for a mission fit. But I would suggest the Domi over the Mega, because the Dominix has fully adaptive damage; you can always do the correct damage against the NPCs if you swap out drones for the type of NPCs you are fighting (see next link for details about what damage to do)
---
Final thing about fitting: change your tank hardeners to match what damage the NPCs are doing. Use [this site](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReports) to look up the mission you want to run in question, and change out your armor hardeners  (Galente ships are usually armor tanked) to tank the two most dominant damage types. If you need to tank all damage types for a particular misson, use an anti-explosive armor hardener, a reactive armor hardener (for mission fits 2 hardeners should be active hardeners), an energized adaptive nano membrane and a tech 2 damage contol. For most other missions, run 2 active hardeners and a damage control 2, and add an extra magnetic field stabilizer or drone damage amplifier to complete missions quicker.
---
Now, about rewards. Missions give you 4 types of rewards. First, they give you targets to kill for both bounties and loot (some of which can be pretty good, check eve-survival for the loot piniatas). Second, they offer isk rewards for completing the mission. Third, some storyline missions will give a 50 million isk implant reward IIRC. Finally, and most importantly, you get loyalty points (LP). LP is used to buy exclusive modules, implants, and even ship blueprints or ships that you can then take to Jita and sell. To find the best LP-isk conversion rates, use [fuzzworks](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/). Typically 1000 isk per LP is considered an OK conversion rate, and anything above that is considered good.  
---
Ok, 2 more things, that are somewhat related. 
---
Standard, battleship level 4 mission running was how I made my first billion isk, and sometimes I miss that chill PVE gameplay. But level 4 missioning gets really boring if it's all you do, so either do other things as well (frigate or cruiser PVP in lowsec, industry, ice mining, whatever), or understand that missions aren't necessarily the endgame of Eve. They dont make the most money in Eve, they aren't the most fun or the most satisfying thing in Eve, and missioning is not the most respected career in the game. But mission a great stepping stone into how to theory crafting and trying out fitting ships, learning tanking, weapon systems, and agility mechanics, and learning about the market and economy of the game.
---
If you do want to advance as a mission runner later on though, running burner missions is decently profitable, fun, challenging, and somewhat different from the normal L4 missions. Burner missions are the "we wont penalize you if you decline or fail" level 4 missions that you get occasionally (don't do these initially, they are actually really really hard). They require significant research and will probably wreck you the first few times you try them. But its worth it, they can make 40+ mil per mission and don't take long to run at all once you know what your doing. Guides are availible online, but that is your homework for when the time comes.

He’s been slimmer for years now.

Or am I? What if it’s part of a long con?
---
It depends highly if you’re on a lucky day or not. There are those days where you explore and bring back enough for a subscription, and the day where you only have a single Carbon.
---
Sadly, you don’t know if there are others explorers with you until they show their ship or start scanning around with probes. If you think someone else is already scanning a system, try to focus on wormhole and jump through the flesh one you like.
---
Also, if you’re not having too much luck with wormhole exploration, try to take a connection to nullsec and scan the sites there. I have the impression they are even less ran with Blackout, which mean more sites. If you have a connection directly into quiet Sansha’s Nation space, your fortune is made. But don’t spit on Angel Cartel or Guristas sites, they’re still good money. Avoid Blood Raiders space like the plague, and try to find something better than Serpentis if you can.

rather indeed, you can see the breast line under his rightside pectoral area.

I can't git gud if there's no-one to fight against.
---
Listen, I’m not being sarcastic, I want to follow your argument. Likely English isn’t your first language. Your grammar is hard to parse properly,, I’m sure I’m missing some nuances.
---
l could see how you’d capture the pilot who’s pod you want to steal. Once you capture that pod you can decant the pilot and take the pod. That would be the easy one. You could have the replacement pilot to travel along on the Rorqual and just inject into the existing pod. That seems pretty straightforward and wouldn’t require some of your other steps.
---
What I don’t get is: how would kill the pilot whose pod you want, *inside* the pod without triggering the clone jump?
---
"Wait,what happened to the game?!"  
---
"It was broken and nobody liked it so we removed it"  
---
"You can't just remove the entire game from the game"  
---
"already did"
---
from time to time EVE becomes quite boring...  
---
so in 2016  I decided to check dotlan for HiSec systems with women's names and visited them ;-) Didn't expect this could be worth to mention anywhere ;-)))  
---
It isn't worth, but I mentioned it now \*\*lol\*\*
---
I frankly enjoyed squishy screaming like pikachu than watching the Rag die.
---
CCP is better at mining salt than the krabs ever could be
---
This game is so much more fun now thank you CCP for remembering the players that dont want to play farmville-in-space
---
Ohh even i am looking to buy a dread phoenix
---
&gt; Local Chat/Blackout
---
This is just my crazy idea (that I had before blackout, when I didn't think CCP would ever go through with it): only add people to local when they activate a module, and remove them from local if no modules are active for 3 minutes or something. A hunter would be able to jump into system, warp around, dscan down some targets, and even land on grid with one, without appearing in local. Ratters and miners would be immediately on local. Cloaky campers would be on local, as their cloak is active. You can choose between being in local (cloaked) or being on dscan (uncloaked). Does it make any physical sense? No, but who cares, it's potentially interesting gameplay.
---
It wasnt a shitpost that's why.. why dont you answer the question instead of getting all defensive
---
It really isnt
---
What, more than doubling the yield and tank of barges and exhumers isn't enough?
---
Congratulations Hilmar. Null sec is now only the 3 main null blocks... RIP large wars.
---
If you're ganking freighters with artillery you're doing it wrong.  Even in a 1.0 system, a talos provides a higher damage output before concord shows up.
---
What happened the Kenshin. Noticed they died
---
Not a valid git command 
---
/s should anybody need it
---
Would you really want to put a dying game on your CV
---
Lord have Mercer on his stomach
---
So they're stable, as such a stone would be in a stable orbit receiving only the tiniest amount of drag?
---
Once they stopped doing the AT that is legit CCP not caring anymore and I never have been a contender for AT.
---
I always saw new bro post to have helpful answer quite fast, there are some trolling/shit but it's not a often
---
I'm before most of the corps join a tapirium affiliated group
---
To be fair, they have suffered 1 war which wiped them out of Vale and Tribute (which they where outnumbered in both sub and capital force). Then they had to move to Malpais (this took about a month to move/get infrastructure setup). Now Hilmar went "fuck null sec" with his WH butt buddies which only makes it harder for NC.  
---
That being said they are in a really good region which is very easy to defend. Hopefully they can start to rebuild so we can get back to shooting each-other once CCP un-fucks themselves (lol wishful thinking, I know).
---
calm down hauler
---
\*In
---
Alpha clone in noob ship with T1 scam. Change does nothing but make us spend \~30k more isk per gank.
---
That's the problem. Easy to Defend... this was never NC or PL ethos.  They were the ones being on the offensive. Now they seem like no other ordinary alliances.  Sad times tbh.  Really like them to go nomadic again and just cause havoc.  Nullsec needs it
---
They finally count down to 0
---
So you reply without having a clue about what he was fuckin asking about.
---
Lower sec will have higher lp payout.
---
T2 module and t1 armor rig on a hel , that's disgusting it should have die.
---
This is empty box
---
?
---
or maybe open your eyes and see that those t1 trimarks are large sized? and that they are fitted to a nestor?
---
New game mechanics will keep favouring larger and larger blocks for all those reasons mentioned previously. Great work CCP as you keep driving people from your game.
---
Its really amusing watching the people who wont change spin their wheels in impotent rage.
---
[x] Doubt
---
What, you can't gank retrievers/mackinaws or covetors/hulks?
---
If Fraternity isn't going to bother defending their own stuff, why bother? Do they pay rent to PanFam or something?

i will often reach out directly and offer advice when they post, however many of them just read the post to decide if they want to play.  Reading reddit over the last couple months wouldn't make anyone want to play and that is unfortunate.  I wish everyone would go back to propaganda....
---
If all money needs to be made in highsec, what is the point of nullsec?
---
nobody cares about killboard in a no-skill game, shitter.
---
Try learning to play a pvp game where you have more than 2 buttons to operate.
---
"Everyone who disagrees with these changes is a bot"
---
Have you ever seen a fat person?
---
Anyway Thx all for all this tine. I wonna thx inner hell for helping my uninstall this game. I donr by start all agein. Good luck all and fly safe
---
Would love to see how you would fit a solo small gang deacon. Please indulge us.
---
1.This game gets on front pages due to big fights. This is what draw a lot of attention and players. With cyno changes i believe it will reduce the opportunity for those fights. 
---
2.Moving capitals will be cancer. Will you really risk ships worth 3rd of the carrier that you need to move to move to new area unless it is big group move op?
---
3. Moving JF into and out of deep null will be even more pain in the arse than it is now. Now you can move ceptor with cyno after which jf can supply number of cyno ships with the first jump. Try now to gate it. Or move bpos and minerals needed to build first one. 
---
I dont think it is good change. Again big umbrellas will adapt, little guys will either merge into big groups or move out completely. I think ccp shot themselves in the knee with that decision as they cannot back out of it like with blackout and it will drive out many more people than blackout did.
---
I mean, tethering existed in the form of POS shields and asset safety existed in the form of indestructible stations. So you probably should remove those two from your list.
---
Isn't ratting in highsec a lot less lucrative? That's still a positive if you lower the isk faucet of botting.
---
good to see good fights still happening out in high class wh, props to novac and ehefkai!
---
Your conclusion is false. The bots are fine.they adapted with gatecamper alpha pods running on virtual machines. People left, not bots. I also left 2 months ago. 10+years player, super pilot. So yeah. You are wrong on so many levels...
---
I fully expect the discussion right now in the csm is what sort of changes are needed and what is the best for balance. Any idiot can see the impact of no local and see its beneficial to the long term stability, but in no way shape or form is it balanced. Clearly something in addition needs to happen to nullsec to balance it out.
---
Fun fights??? I don't know about that all I see is hundreds bombers, lokis and the likes landing on ratting carriers or rorquals that's not a fun fight. No more fun for that pilot than it is for them when he lights a cyno and a fleet of titans arrive and boson them.. Fairs fair..
---
The cyno is the perfect counter to all them cloaked ships.
---
Ccp need to rework the entire meta not just one aspect of it. These cyno changes also make it harder for large scale escalation battles which is what made eve famous and news worthy. These current line of changes make the big blocks close in. They are less likely to go war now.
---
Ccp needed to break the meta by giving smaller alliances the ability to grow. An making it worth while going to war. Not going to war out of bordem
---
So how cheap are titans then today? Last time i played the were around 45-53b per hull...
---
Thanks! Only my third time flying triage for the brawl - hence the sloppiness. 
---
But a lot better than my performance the last time against Ehefkae in their RG (I still have nightmares of the 15 simultaneous broadcasts for SB damage, with everyone in half armor), whilst 2 groups of Shaks are spooling on different targets with the occasional Rev volley thrown in for good measure)
---
You spelld ulcer wrongly.
---
The stupid is strong with this one.
---
They joined init
---
Income from abyssals will also drop when people stop being able to buy the mods or stop using them as much in pvp.
---
So abyssals is now a good way to make money but will probably slow down when people stop undocking expensive ships because of not having a way to replace them...
---
So how exactly does a bumper log in another alpha without breaking the rules?     
---
As I see it, this promotes either more omegas or more real players for this playstyle, which is not a bad thing
---
eh, it's a nice supplement but most of them just come from you know where and a few corps in delve who pay in dreads to not get dropped on
---
Oh you poor stupid thing. You still think Goons is filled with bots even though data from CCP has shown we are not even on the charts...
---
Darkness is an exemple but they are other smaller null alliance than legacy/imperium/fraterny and ncpl than will decrease too.
---
I left null during my break, restart in wh and I'm looking at the null region when we have a connection and they look pretty dead at the moment for most of them
---
That's what we get for trusting a red head...
---
It's great for explorers though.  Running all through 0.0 and not a soul in dscan.
---
Indeed I still need time to be fully awake , my bad ^^
---
I wonder if they could tie it to a deployable.  That way it has a spool up and is still killable even if the user is in a capital
---
yep I got it .
---
Soon everyone will be the same, blackout isnt just about no local in nullsec, its no people either.
---
I heard the spawn rate is a bug they've found but it's not an easy fix
---
If it's so no skill, then why aren't you probably good at it?
---
Why do you think EVE players play no other games?
---
If a hundred people drop on you, you probably should be dead, regardless of ship type.
---
Come play Second Galaxy, we need people to murder...
---
Ohh right, all the bots that we don't actually have..... But fuck CCP data on bots right? Because that data was adjusted toshow goons don't have bots right?? The stupid is strong with this one too.
---
Well people that use reddit should know that not everything you found is good and that's not only for eve. But when you ask for help you will find people.
---
Good propaganda takes time also a lot a player went inactive due to school starting back and blackout. War also favours propaganda, atm there is only legacy/frat and I think due to the language wall, not a lot of frat guys do it.
---
So now warp disrupters can only be fitted to t2 hulls...CHAOS!
---
THIS IS LIES AND SLANDEROUS
---
&gt; .This game gets on front pages due to big fights. This is what draw a lot of attention and players. With cyno changes i believe it will reduce the opportunity for those fights.
---
Maybe, but these fights are exceedingly rare. Trying to gamble the health of the game just on these is throwing a lot under the bus for a few moments.
---
Especially when a lot of those biggest fights involved both sides dropping supers at the same time, not dropping a massive fleet onto an already prepared massive fleet.
---
You clearly arent keeping up with the game if you dont know what PL are doing right now.
---
&gt; Ccp need to rework the entire meta not just one aspect of it.
---
Nobody is saying the opposite.
---
Just that currently the cyno isn't used particularly tactically in a lot of cases.
---
I sure do see a lot of negative numbers in here boys.
---
In a ganking fleet of \~30 characters. One account whether Omega or Alpha has a near zero effect.
---
it's not my problem anymore. I tradh everything i had and uninstall game.
---
Sites also despawn after a period of time. You could just be getting really unlucky.
---
OK elaborate how is it actually not used tactically. Its used to move ships from A to B. Its a single function device can't do anything else.
---
Now we need scrams / disrupters to only be fitted  to T2 hulls,  fights will last longer as people engage, break off, reengage etc ..and CHAOS!
---
They are on twitter, like 3 images total
---
you did an awesome job dude! just keep getting those cap training seshes in and you'll be smooth af in no time
---
FYI: with VNI nerf no one use them
---
I mean again bc with 8 large guns and a dmg bonus didn't exist. But fair enough.
---
Are you really that stupid.  Wtf am I asking the question. I know why because your a typical reddit trolling mofo
---
That's strategic, not tactical.
---
The tactical aspect is almost entirely light cyno &gt; all friends come with no counter play.
---
Having to think longer than half a second to decide when and how to cyno is good.
---
Chaos and changes are one thing. But as someone that enjoyed the PVE side of Null and pretty much just ratted and hung out with people on comms it was not really chaos I experienced in the last year. It was just CCP dismantling my whole playstyle without giving me an alternative.   
---
A lot of people tell me that EVE is only about PVP but for me it was just a relaxed game where I spoke to people and did what I wanted.   
---
The PVE is still in the game. But I don't want to do missions or rat in cheap ships without any intel. I loved playing with my supers, doing occasional home defense and just shooting shit in discord. But when the devs are just taking stuff away without providing true alternatives you get the feeling that you are not wanted. And after coming to that realization I just sold all of my stuff and left. 
---
And I won't come back until the devs realize that you won't keep a game fresh and interesting by taking away stuff and kneejerking around. Adding fresh content, incentivising players to do something and balancing can keep a game going.   
---
At the moment it feels more like they are trying to kill the game off.
---
Yikes
---
Fair enough, but you still have the ability to put 8 large guns on a bc with dmg bonus.
---
This is just Resting Meeting Face...
---
Exactly the issue.   WH and BLOP and Cyno's are too over powered.
---
you just roll a good connect, then you roll up with some good dudes and you say, "hey, down for pvp?" usually works
---
I can agree. Been testing and I’m enjoying it. Refreshing.
---
Sure, they were rare but now there wont be trigger for them. The only thing that will happen are bomber /blops drops. And i wont even follow this particular rabbit hole.
---
Gating capitals across nullsec? Really? Have you ever lived in null? Or is your opinion based only on reddit?
---
Regardless of the timer on recon it will probably die. As soon as someone will see it they will be on it like a rash and it will pop.
---
Wait until wormholes will be focus of the month for Hilmar. I will be laughing my arse off.
---
Think you got mistaken for the 2 man Kenshin.. which is a holding corp,  it only just left Darkness as we were sorting out structure transfers or unanchors etc
---
The main Corp is super happy in our new home with the Init family for nearly 2 weeks now :)
---
yea, that is what CCP said.  I think they realized it watching a streamer not get any sites for days...
---
been there done that. PL + NC. have had that title. as have PLENTY of other entitys. what makes goons strong is thier titan numbers. maybe future changes remove the benefit of titan numbers. which in turn would destroy goons.
---
just dont think goons are the biggest and have been forever my dude, they said this before and eve put them down and kicked them out of thier space once already in the last few years.
---
i presume your a typical goon, played in hisec for 1-2years. joined goons to rorqual mine, mined and injected into a titan. and think your the best because thats all youve known (btw goon sub cap FC's suck ass, or the f1 monkeys do im not sure)
---
Would be awesome if sub-cap fights can be integrated with tq using echoes. Caps on pc and sub caps on mobile
---
i love the decision as people have to think and plan more instead of just jumping into the heart of someones home ;-)
---
Ships all the way to titans have been mentioned by devs
---
you think this doesnt sound fine? i mean, if 5k is all the pvpers left. all we would do is concentrate the population for fighting. 
---
if 5k people played only capital proliferation would not of become a thing. Mass rorqual mining wouldnt either. people would do it, but not on the recent scale.
---
Inb4 all of null joins goons
---
Good Quality Post, see you in wow classic xD
---
unless it weighed a lot that wouldnt work well.  If it was like a mobile depot every ship could still carry one
---
Now I really consider going full retard and build a Hight-Grade Cyrstal capsule. It almost doubles my rep per boost and literally 1 boost can rep half of my shield. This could be fun.
---
JFs won't be jumping to covert cynos.

---
Large fights are also actually cancer, the articles and news posts about them never really mention the multi-hour slogfest in single digit % TiDi and how shit breaks.
---
And yet, every time we go after them, voila a loki fleet appears. Eventually we stopped going after them.
---
unless that's part of some bonus agreement on that contract with Pearl Abyss I don't see him staying after October...
---
BTW there is no point to fit tank in a depot Nestor:

---
I feel like the AT will be back next year. Shall see
---
Phew..
---
yeah i know lol i'm just saying that the trimarks are fitted to nestor not to hel
---
Then stop lighting cynos in busy systems just to move a capital.
---
Somehow people moved supers around before they could dock.
---
The trigger for those big fights isn't the cyno anyway. It's having a reason to fight.
---
Gotta agree. 
---
There's nothing chaotic about it. It's inconvenience, which is why people are playing games that aren't actively trying to obstruct them having fun in their free time.
---
I'm just spending more time at the gym and baking, personally. Not sure which is causing which. I blame GBBO being back on the telly, at any rate.
---
They may be cool but they aren't fun.
---
Might as well unplug the server if that's the case.
---
That's what I do on this account, do you think dota born in 1977 is a proof league is copy of dota for example? Or just think where I got the numbers 255*whatever?

---
I actually enjoyed the blackout a bit last weekend.   
---
Using the direction scanner while exploring and doing data and relic sites.  A completely different experience and not all that bad. Easier when you know who is in the system, but it looks pretty quiet in npc null.
---
rep implants are extremely fun but for null roaming a 3b pod might be overkill
---
Because you are ignorant and because EVE is a no skill game for the buffoons who have gotten shit on in pvpmmorpgs that actually require player skill. They play EVE because they suck at everything else.
---
Seeing them around 36-39
---
Cynos could give a role to combat ceptors after they lost nullification but it's too soon IMO to pretty much revert cynogeddon. Let's wait and see where the meme takes us.
---
If it runs for 10+ years you do.
---
both of those are tiny changes, and only ended up being 'good' because other nerfs made them the default (ie, insurance being removed so we don't have free 1500 dps domis)
---
when you initiate warp to the covert site - around 2 minute timer starts counting down, you can get in, quicly head to one of the cans and to the hack. If you stay longer, you die, if you fail the hack you die, unless you can tank a lot of damage. So a bit of correction - if you are in a frigate you die. Correctly tanked cruiser might live.
---
http://evenews24.com/2019/08/14/dev-post-chaos-era-continues-cyno-update/
---
Is there a more current source?
---
Funny thing is high sec missions and highsec moons now exist for all the afk farming crabs.
---
They just have to pack up and leave nullsec and be at slightly more risk in highsec than they were in null pre-blackout.
---
But with the isk faucet shut off, plex will drop in price for a while before slowly climbing again, which means that ratters and spodbrains will barely lose anything by moving to highsec.
---
Dont forget in nullsec you dont know if system is busy anymore. 
---
People moved supers through disposable cynos. Start self destruct. Light cyno few seconds before explosion. Jump to that cyno in few second window.
---
There will be less reasons to fight due to cyno changes. Less movement, less mistakes. Soon the content will dry out.
---
Can I have ur stuff?
---
... Serious man, if you anchor a structure, you have to know that it will die in some time... Never put in space what you can't afford to lose!
---
If the eco system can be balanced properly it has the real potential.. but still my personal opinion would be no caps on mobile and use the mobile "f2p" environment to get players to sub accounts to train caps on tq itself. Accounts similarly should not be tied to minimise the "carriers are the new atron" meta rn it caps are gonna be introduced. It would at the least give people who want to join fights but are not able to due to work or whatever other commitments an opportunity to participate f1monkeysftw
---
Agree. Oh well let the fun begin :)))) \*famous last words
---
So then what does that say about you?
---
You couldn't even hack it in a no skill game, so you came to the real no skill mmo of shit posting on Reddit.
---
I play eve and many other games, including pvp centric games and perform just fine (probably better than I do in EVE).
---
People aren't having huge 100 titan slug fests over a super getting caught moving.
---
Don't be ridiculous.
---
Agreed
---
With regards to wormholes, the static insta spawing on the otherside does not solve your problem, at all, not even close. What if I just crit  my static, hic it for good measure, itll close if you fart on it?
---
As a ratter you worry about other holes coming into you when rat, not the static. Wandering holes, time-crit holes that die, people rage rolling.
---
* If people want ratters to die, ccp needs to add scrams anoms.
---
* They need need to increase to max jump mass to very large for low class space connecting high class, a C4 going to a C5 for example. Easier rolling=more rolling=more surprise buttsex.
---
* All holes max time duration is set at 16 hours, High class holes are 24 hours. This will also take care of your "they roll their static and now they are safe" brainfart
---
nice edit and good piloting!
---
think of it like a kill mark
---
the fucking MER released by CCP you idiot...
---
lol.  Why would i play a no-skill game in the first place, retard?  I would prefer to play a game where my player skill sets me apart rather than my knowledge of exploits of shitty game mechanics.
---
Your backwards-ass thinking is typical of the kind of morons who are still playing EVE in 2019. 
---
Hilarious.
---
Toilet Paper. recrute ma poule ;)
---
i am from vietnam using translator
---
Slow down buckaroo, I actually don’t have a problem besides wormholes being too safe sometimes.  I DO live in one so I know a bit about them.   Adding scrams would be a good start.  
---
I don’t think making them all 16hrs would solve much and if you have ever lived in Thera, those 16hr holes really are a pain because they always seem like they are EOL.
---
&gt;Avoid Blood Raiders space like the plague,
---
Is this because the market for stuff originating from Delve is pretty saturated?
---
God dammit Hans!
---
What are you hunting if krabbers already left?
---
Inner hell already replaced ganking nullsec to eviction.
---
I didn't have a structure there. And you you can't do my stuff :) i already trash all and delate account
---
Ah ofcourse. The daily online numbers post. Lovely
---
I wish dsons could be less shit, but we dont get what we always want do we treacle :p
---
Just because you call the other side risk averse doesn't absolve yours from being so. And when both are it ends up being meaningless.
---
Honest question.
---
How many of the Chinese players you comment have stopped playing are botters that have given up on trying to bot and have left permanently?
---
We all know the Chinese are one of the major causes of bot proliferation.
---
Yes, because Gotg was a really stronger and small independant alliance that wasn't trash at all and wasn't mostly composed of krabs.
---
YOURE ALL A BUNCH OF WHINING BULLSHITTING LAZY SONS OF BITCHES

You have seen the recent posts in this subreddit, right? Bots are back, using pod scouts on gate and myrm farms.
---
You are free ;D
---
Pourquoi retourner en null quand je me plais en wh dans une corp active mon poulet ?
---
Un jour peut être si je veux avoir un avatar/molok pour le e-penis X)
---
I dont understand why krabbers dont setup proper baits. The amount of times I am recklessly dropping shit atm...countercyno, cloaked shit in site. Even when all the 5 Myrms in system (example is not bots) warp in to save the 6th Myrm my tackle will be forced off. Its so easy and we all could have more meaningful pvp gameplay and more content.
---
Rather than doing this ppl just dock up and cry on reddit as they dont want to risk even cheap t1 hulls to force the average roamer away if there is no skirmish fc online. IMO blackout was a yuge opportinity for the quick response gameplay to evolve if ppl would have some balls...but no. no adaption only docking up and stop logging in. cant krab in peace. sad times

We would but 5h of blue timer on dreads ya know also hed to form fleet of beans like right after rag kill to give some tapi rorqs some love. :-)
---
That is a hacker that sold you this
---
Yea...my group always undocks to fight roamers but usually the hunters either cloak and run as soon as they have a fair fight or they're all nano fit and just hop from safe to safe till we get bored.
---
I'm not say "all the money", I'm saying that those with a lower appetite for risk can go into different areas of eve and enjoy the other isk-making activities there are. Because right now almost all the isk in the game is being generated in nullsec and it's not exactly healthy for the game.
---
Old cynos are fine AHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
---
&gt;rely on CCP to figure out 
---
Lol, no. I don't trust CCPs ability to pick those metrics.
---
And even if they do they will pick metrics that don't include how the entire playerbase perceives something, cause there isn't such a thing as an 'everything' metric.
---
weak kurwa
---
True but neither side will admit they're just as bad as the other.
---
It doesn’t require a sub and doesn’t require docking when neutrals are on grid so less isk per hour but more isk perpetually.
---
CEOs have a lot of free time to exercise when they spend 10 years away from doing anything for the company they're CEO of.
---
That does not give it meaning. It's still just an insult you are throwing out to make yourself feel better.
---
the nestor in my tit was fully fit for max tank, cyno and ozone (rip this tactic)
---
if in need, i can get a friend or alt to pop in and light instead of having to light on my tit
---
and then i get a max tank nestor (fitting this tank costs like 30mil)
---
CCP always bans bots and they come back - that’s the nature of MMOs. MER Mining Data in Domain and Sing shows huge high sec increases that are inhuman. In short - bots are here to stay.
---
I may agree if they didn't have a long history of giving 0 shit about player/CSM feedback.  This is likely more of the same.
---
Yeah it's boring but once you do it it's hard to stop. Easy isk if you don't over do it. I'm about at my limit with five too s.
---
cry harder cry better
---
If you quit the game because of a change then you probably shouldn't have been playing to begin with.
---
CCP Hillmar lost a round in bullshit bingo and nobody really cares
---
What are you talking about, why should someone not play the game while they are having fun?
---
Anyone who has all their shit in a single place in eve and ragequits after losing it, doesn’t deserve sympathy for their own stupidity.
---
I see the opposite. Its rare for defenders to form. When they do its only if we stay around in the area after we ganked something (for like 30min). Than they form a doctrine with logi under an fc. For like 1 solo BC or 4 guys in random shit. Like we could have left  anytime cause no one bothers to tackle us. I even flew mostly brawl shit over the last weeks and put myself in risky situation etc to get more fights but ppl just dont go for it. they just dont have the hunger to pvp. 
---
even then u dont have "form for roamers". just setup a bait to frag my 4b sin. its so easy but appearently its easier to just complain instead of adapting.
---
This was already standard for the past months or maybe to an extent always but atleast krabbers didnt complained back then as they were 100% safe.
---
I really love this warning change. I remember when I started I had no clue on what to fit to my ships and ended up with a shield tanked harbinger I think. Really curious to see how this works out!
---
Would be pretty boring
---
All of us.
---
Thera is not a wormhole, its Jita with bubbles ;D
---
Considering that everyone I play with is loving the blackout and the cyno changes, I'm pretty sure it's just r/eve being r/eve.
---
This is true in every game. It's the people who don't like things who make posts about it. Even if the majority likes a thing, most posts about it will still be negative.
---
People who hunt explorers don't show up on dscan.
---
Don't get me wrong it's different everywhere but personal experience for me was always tge hunters were scared to fight fair fights. Take earlier for example our miners got hit by a T3C/AF gang we hoped in whatever we could so we had anywhere from a domi to a slasher it was 8 of them vs maybe 10 of us everytime we tried to engage they just ran never commiting to a fight even when we fucked up and seperated
---
Any updates on what server we're staying at?
---
good succing
---
I don’t agree with your idea. But that’s not to say it’s a terrible one. But I can assure you the devs have said it is going to be like eve pc but different. It currently has all the systems and entire new eden in it. They’re working on basic systems and how they should function on a mobile platform. It has potential that is for certain.
---
Not a bad shitpost. Not that great either.
---
Here's an upboat.
---
uwu
---
Yup, either everyone is a goon or in highsec/wh
---
So you've never played eve? But not only think it's no skill, but believe that coming here to troll makes you better?
---
why didnt you tackle them? put sabres in their way? used ansiblex shit to get ahead of them? you missed your chance. only complaining

Eve uni does this as well I can use the bpos but can't take them out of the container
---
Incendius! Most of us are alliance
---
Parce que tout le monde a besoin de Toilet Paper. :Smart:
---
I have yellow ones, gonna test it when my laptop come back from service
---
For all the times I got told to HTFU when I was a newbie getting suicide ganked, the EVE playerbase sure has become the whiniest bunch of faggots in the gaming community.
---
The Problem is that noone really want to commit the necessary time to setup a gank when the chances are that you might encounter:
---
* a Bomber which cloaks up as soon as something non-miner enters grid
---
* a Bomber which bridges a 15+ loki gang which you cannot fight with the couple people stubborn enough to wait hours for something to happen
---
* a Capital Drop from a big empire which you cannot escalate anyway since you are not part of a big empire yourself
---
So instead of waiting hours doing nothing and standing rdy, you just do PvE in throwaway ships and take the occasional loss since you are isk positive very quickly.
---
exactly that
---
Not for the near 3b price tag of a good rorq fit
---
Simple T3Cs can be interdiction nullified if you were unaware AFs were nano fit and a nightmare to catch with a blinged nano fit and would run as soon as combat scanners went out.
---
I dont cry. why everyone is so salty and toxic?
---
I just wanted to say goodbye and wish everyone good luck.
---
Those fights have already stopped because Imperial Legacy controls &gt;50% of supercaps, nothing to do with cyno changes. I was there with you in Tribute when we made the decision not to give them a titan fight, as they did in WWB.
---
Spoiler alert: he doesn't have one.
---
sounds more like you are not committed to create a environment where hunters are "not fully save"
---
Supers are *massive* for sov fights - unless there are at least two independent parties with comparable numbers, at which point supers get relegated to discouraging the other superfleet from doing anything bold.
---
dictors on the gates? ansiblex to get ahead? I wouldnt let a bling nightmare just get away.
---
Honestly, your story sounds pretty unrealistic. It usually takes ages to even find one other explorer, you would also see any potential explorers taking care of the sites you want to do on your D-SCAN (so chances are, if you don't see any there's noone clearing sites either) .   
---
As a general rule of thumb: The deeper you are into the chain, the lower the chance of activity. Don't try to find sites in HS static holes, mostly a waste of time, or worse if they are camped somewhere, a waste of your ship.
---
Glad I'm not the only one flying brawly ships more since the change. Even under bloc areas I've had more success with them preblackout. 
---
Hull tanked Gnosis has been lit
---
I don't understand this argument. If the parts that change makes the game no longer fun for you, quitting is a perfectly valid response.
---
aw, went US anyway? i just paid for an eu sub. D:
---
i just bought 10 dreks and welped them all. good fun. snacked some nice kills
---
If the Agressor has the formup advantage and superior numbers why should i bother trying to swim upstream? 
---
I create an environment where hunters simply have nothing/only thrash to hunt. I don't even know when i last undocked in a barge anymore, must be weeks.
---
No but his sister and his mum took over the alliance
---
I'm in a small alliance on the ass end of eve there is no use ansiblex to get ahead. dictors on gates? Sure till they decide to safe up and wait it out thus wasting everyones time. I feel like you're a wormholer that has only fought the big blocs.
---
I'm not crying. Why all are so salty and toxic. I just wanted to say goodbye and wish everyone good luck. and thanks inner hell for help in making such a decision.
---
Meglomaniac I did not have all shit in a single place
---
I mean you have a standing fleet they could throw out bait they are waiting to jump on anything that moves anyway. Not everyone has to be baiting you already have people sitting around spinning waiting for a cyno why not be proactive about it.
---
Playing EVE to have fun... lol.
---
"*EVE is a dark and harsh world, you're supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in, you're not supposed to feel like you're logging in to a happy, happy, fluffy, fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures, that's what hello kitty online is for.*" - CCP Wrangler
---
There's fun and excitement in EVE, no doubt. But fun and excitement are not the reason to play EVE. That's what Call of Duty and World of Warcraft are for. EVE isn't for fun.
---
MMO without players is not a game, especially when it requires people to do daily tasks as without this whole structure implodes.            
---
EvE is a game,  but also product that needs to be sold.
---
my experiance comes from my time in WHs and now in a small group living in tribute. like if u cant even do something about 10 roamers i wonder what u do in null
---
What sort of fucked up definition of fun do you have, people would play a game if they werent having fun, which the current logged in count is showing.
---
Cap boosters mustn’t be on “auto repeat”, only “auto reload”
---
fuck wow, Borderland 3!
---
Tedium is shit game design
---
Anyone in the world in a 2 - 3 day group of meetings will check their phone from time to time. Doesn't mean they are uninterested.
---
The "agressor" never has the formup advantage in a average roaming scenario. if you think of casual roamers by the big blocs where they have 20+ ppl sure but IMO thats not a roam but a fleet.
---
The average 5-10 roamers never have an advantage over the locals if the locals would take the pvp situation seriously.
---
sadly your mindset is right tho. not undocking or undocking a 10 to 1 fleet is the meta. sadly human nature and why the game is stale
---
"I'm not interested at all to fight you. I'm interested in building and  exploring. Real life is pvp. I escape from that shit into eve so that i  can do zen like stuff to relax ( mining, industry, ratting ). "
---
then come to high-sec. safe, relaxing evironment for you. what's your problem?
---
100 TIPS ON HOW TO RUN A TRASHTRUCK INTO THE FIRE!
---
BY SOME ICELANDIC AUTISTIC TURBONERD WORKING OUT AT 60 AFTER SPENDING ALL THE CASH ON HOOKASANDBLOW BECAUSE HE HAD A DEBATE WITH THEIR NEW LANDLORD AND NOW HE'S ON TO PROVE HOW WORSE IT CAN GET IN EVE IF THEY DON'T LET HIM LOOSE.
---
Soooo you play eve cause you hate yourself?
---
Sad news for you here bro cause most of the universe doesnt see it that way
---
i'll rather be in null, have more risk but more reward and avoid you completely by using dscan and intel channels... thats not stressfull either
---
Well I came back to the game after a couple years because of the changes, and people nowadays in 0.0 are even worse than the years before. Especially goons poached alot of dead weight.
---
ok, then null-sec is a  safe, relaxing evironment for you. so what's your problem?
---
Let's take a case study. We're gate camping in KBP with Sabre, Deimos and Kikimora, HTP jumps in 2 Stratios. OK, seems like this could be a fun fight. HTP Stratios lights a cyno and drops 3 Apostles, we warp off (except me, I waterboard your bounced Apostle for a good 15 minutes in the Sabre for the lulz), and your guys cry in local about content denial.
---
When you wont move a pair of Stratios around without fax support, why would anyone go to the effort of giving you content when you drop HAW dreads and carriers which pose zero strategic risk? Ultimately, you guys are the first to whine about being denied content, but you're not interested in anything that looks like a fight you might lose.
---
It also stopped many of the people I enjoy playing with from logging in.
---
or i bet you are not logged in but still waiting on pings, i've seen this alot don't play but have discord/jabber/whatever open and see if something pops up
---
No, I play EVE for the challenge, the risk, the danger, the planning, and the meaningful content.
---
I don't play EVE for "fun". That's not the kind of game EVE is, or ever was.
---
Everything ends at some point, conditions in eve changed, such life is no longer possible or at least maintainable for any meaningfull period. Thats prety much all.
---
Sorry, but as a Rorq pilot I have to disagree. With a small fleet of just five Hulks and with only a 50% reduction in cycle time for miners (ie. shit skills), I can pay off that 3Bn Rorqual with only the increase in mining income in under thirty hours. This doesn't include the extra income from not having to buy new subcap miners when they get dropped, since in a pinch they can stow the miners in the Rorq, and/or I can make every subcap miner on grid invincible for long enough for a response fleet to form.
---
Given better skills and a larger subcap mining fleet the time to pay off the Rorq goes down yet further. The Rorq is already a really good boosting ship, it doesn't need any additional buffs to its boosting capability.
---
Yeah, though wanted to say it was less $ focused than you were saying... just because that's soul crushing. Most people don't work to make someone rich. They reconcile will to work from somewhere more wholesome in some cases. Or at least the folks I work with, do. E.g.: customers / users get a ton more benefit -- that they're willing to pay for. Yay.
---
I think CCP moved from model where they were beholden to shareholders ($$$$), to parent company. Which can be good to act as buffer to give them latitude to experiment.
---
&gt;Second Galaxy
---
is the game any good?
---
When the first change was made, I thought "awesome!!! A cheetah with warp speed rigs!!! It has to be that!!"....oh the stupidity.
---
This is just a roundabout "threatening CCP with lack of subs" argument.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
90% of the nerds playing are US. Id talk to blizz support and theyll more than likely happily swap it for you
---
Did you even read his post?
---
Awesome, but notify me if you see me in fleet and would like to put them on... so I can warp out before 'the troubles'. :)
---
Name one person that said that rebalancing capitals would kill eve
---
Come join a null-sec alliance, we have asset safety and super umbrella. Inner Hell can't touch your stuff here. ;)
---
Thank you, I love you.
---
Yup. Goons have farmed it so much that Blood Raiders sites are basically worthless when compared to the others factions’.
---
So youre one of the "my way or highway" guys?
---
Gratz youre literally the last Thing eve needs
---
&gt;have more risk
---
&gt;avoid you completely using intel channels
---
Ok...
---
There is that, fully agree. With “old” cyno mechanic there was still option to trigger some cap fight either due to player fuckup, bait or anything in between. Even though chance of big escalation was minimal there was at least some content. Now you can see people just getting rid of those as they are more burden than benefit.
---
Now, just to make sure, that really sounds like theres a broken background service running somewhere. Have you checked Processes and Services in your Task Manager for anything thats remotely called eve?
---
It's not "my way". This is the way EVE has always been, and it looks like CCP is getting ready to return it there after a brief detour trying to increase subs with mass appeal.
---
Huh, never been told I am a welp person. Thanks for the food for thought.
---
So far only about 90-95% of people that ever lived have died.
---
I am okay with those odds.
---
Apart from being a seriously beefed up version  of their T1 equivalent (a Magus with a little bling can tank and dish out ridicolous amounts of damage), the Boosh as well as the links ( the... jump field generator as well as the command burst) offer so much utility/control,which is in  my opinion the single most important factor if you are flying solo.
---
No balls or you are a gal
---
Horde committing to a deployment is new, give frt time to adjust
---
Y E S. Being able to instantly separate someone 100km from their friends/gate to safety is a very big deal.
---
For sure was the subcap fc. But was worth a try. There is a reason I won't take my dreads into malpais. Also, was why I don't really hunt there. Pan fs am has their shit on lock tbh
---
What an absolutely retarded analogy.
---
&gt;The "agressor" never has the formup advantage in a average roaming scenario.
---
This is only true when you do it like you said, wait 30 mins for a fight. But the reality is that they tackle an orca or something else valuable and you have to blitzform and travel there before the ship goes kaboom. In that scenario you are definetly gimped. Especially with the extremely high DPS ships that are around now like the triglavians.
---
&gt;not undocking or undocking a 10 to 1 fleet is the meta.
---
I don't know where you life (presumably in a WH) but for my area roaming Gangs became very rare. And i can fully understand why. Since there in no more local in 0.0, people setup gatescouts everywhere. And it's just way easier to sneak a covops past a distracted scout (or log one out in a System you expect movement in a couple days so you can log in and completely bypass any gatescouts) than an entire fleet/roam. So people just cyno in their fleet, hump that orca with blasters and autocannons and then woosh out before you had the chance to even get a couple ships into system.
---
And WoW Classic. Don't forget that gorilla.
---
1. you also know nothing about their business plans
---
2. so they have money
---
3. you also can't know that
---
4. show me a game like EVE online
---
Hey OP, without PvPers who's gonna buy your shit?
---
PvPers are the core of the game, get rekt.
---
Lmao c4 wolf rayet salt
---
yes. tldr: he says he wants to make shitload of money in a relaxing null-sec environment.
---
Go hunting.
---
Literally take me to your dealer
---
Cant be clean to have this fucked up pov tbh
---
It had its dangers and everything Not gonna lie there needed something to be made but what is going on rn is just wrong.
---
After all this mass appeal is what kept the Lights on and rn it looks like - 80 grand a month for CCP so yeah im sure this will be succsessfull
---
&gt; more risk but more reward and avoid you completely by using dscan and intel channels
---
kek
---
I know what is worth in NS, just dont know about HS
---
Ultimately CCP made it too easy to get a supercap, and too easy to YOLO them, and now they're trying desperately to rectify that without making people cry because their supercaps got nerfed.
---
The cyno change isn't a great answer but I don't have a better one.
---
How many more of their rejects will Init take that is the question.
---
People came back aswell. Like me.
---
Maybe you are wrong on so many levels...
---
&gt; get rekt
---
yeaaa.... this is the creme de la cream of the game
---
How can you enjoy playing with afk VNI and bots?
---
Oh look, another "make the game the way I want it to be or CCP will lose money" guy.
---
Please unsub and don't come back. :)
---
What happened to blackout has just solved all put pvp problems  rhetoric.  The pvp landscape has such has changed  players just got older and bored.
---
Sure the super capital BS hasnt helped but let's not forget that seemed to be OK when NCPL was using them all the time.  What happened to good old fights and roaming gangs eh.
---
tbh i think it's quite good for small pvp engagements, also came back after 4 years and it's fun. Just stop reading /r it's depressing :))
---
D-scan is cancer. We are soo advanced but need to keep pressing a button. This thing should scan automatically
---
How long do you play eve?       
---
Me ? Well over 10years.         
---
Over the time i 'seen shit' in this game.       
---
60k online numbers, multiple expansions and patches that **always pumped online numbers up**                       
---
Over the time i also seen riots against CCP actions, mass unsubs or long term effects of bad decisions from the CCP side.            
---
What is new for me is that recently each change or expansion that CCP makes leads to **drop of the online numbers**, since i am playing i didn't see people just quitting the game at the scale we have it now. ^(fuck my main is even unsubbed for the first time i started to play this game and i don't even rat in nullsec)           
---
Like sure we had phoebe drop, but the scale of what is happening now - you just cannot compare both.             
---
Like i stated my accounts are lapsing - but not because i cannot mine or rat ^(i simply don't do it) but because i have no idea what the hell CCP is trying to do , to the point i lost all the trust in CCP.        
---
For me at this moment it looks like that CCP is trying to kill the game so they can restart the server ?                 
---
Like if you 'cannot see the light' anymore why not just 'play something with future'.                 
---
/u/ccp_falcon maybe it is time for CCP to tell players what is the goal of those changes, as stuff is looking dire.                 
---
Our 'eve' discord is bit over 70 people at this point ~active~ but on a weekend you get like 5 people playing EVE at this point.         
---
Those are mostly not new players, some are from 2003-2005 era. Those people are not ratting or mining, **some are still living of the PI they bought cheap from NPC**                     
---
Like what the hell is going on.
---
I believe the term you are looking for is barrel roll
---
Sure and on my way out ill turn off the Lights cause you are clearly the Same and should walk along :)
---
Come back when you have a cogent argument instead of "appeal to negative consequence" and "ad hominem", bye guy. :)
---
I hope it will stop with the last one.
---
WTF? If u can't jump on a cyno = leave the game? Get urself a subcap. There will be more use of those, finally.  CCP might even remove cyno-blocker modules and structures, cause it's possible to control cynos now. That's a great change, and u don't need to be the goons, to fight whoever u wanna fight. Nothing changes for small sized groups, that's true, but for everyone else - it's a positive change. Yes, at the start there will be less big fights, but soon, probably, we'll see some groups to use new limitations to their advantage. And for me - the fights that are coming will be more interesting than those we've all seen the last years(n+1 wins).
---
So fewer easy targets in space, mostly under an umbrella is good for the game?
---
And you mean the Structure announced back in 2015 along with all the other cool shit ccp just didn't follow through on?
---
So the pcu should climb then
---
Astero sanctuary Thx. Im delate account
---
Just use gates.
---
Cynos were never the problem but what comes through them
---
Lmao youre literally the worst Part this game has to offer
---
Appeal to negative consequence is literally bullshit cause the Hard numbers are on the table but hey those must be faked right?
---
Better get rid of your meth addiction maybe itll clear you view aswell :)
---
boot.ini
---
&gt;WAAAA. WAAAA. WAAAA.
---
&gt;Its so easy and we all could have more meaningful pvp gameplay and more content.
---
They don't want you to have content, and that content isn't what they are interested in to begin with.
---
 SHEEP - are all the miners, ratters, industry people, explorers - all  the people who wants to explore the game. THEY   ARE   THE   CORE. 
---
this statement is also wrong.  most pvp-ers are doing pve, industry etc to get money. so we don't really need carebears. most of carebears not doing anything just mine or rat to pile money. if you were an industry guy or anyone who want to add something to this game (insted of "leave me alone to make ISK in peace") you would see a lots of oppurtunities in this now changing environment.
---
Yes and like it or not that is tactical.. It is a tactical advantage the nul blocs have over smaller corps and alliances.
---
The fact its no counter is your fault not ours. It's not like you attacking that person by yourself so why should he fight all your friends by himself.
---
Also you crying that the billion isk ships can counter your lil bombers and cloaked ships. Ships worth billions should destroy little ships.
---
My opinion - Eviction and another eviction atempts just made me stronger in Eve and RL ( the failure training :P ) and it was the biggest fights in wh I ever experienced.. It was just a bitter FUN, but thats the Eve's phenomenon. If U are (was)  not a TNA CEO or a content maker  there - You loose nothing realy. I doubt you've played actively, so Eve dosn't need U anyway. OFC have a good time in Your non EvE  activities. Cześć jak Czapka
---
After Incarna when CCP Seagull was still around.
---
Solid video! Good piloting, good music and editing.
---
I enjoyed it thoroughly and you should make more of these!
---
1) I don't need to in order to track their public failures. 
---
2) They HAD money
---
3) I know the player count has been on the decline for 6 straight years despite everything they have done to reverse that trend.   
---
4) Elite dangerous, no man's sky and the "game that shall not be named" in this sub. There's actually a lot more than that, those are just the three closest games.
---
So much this...y'all could have just cried about how you can't hotdrop to save your krabbing ship without an alt anymore but instead you went with  this and now all your JF pilots will probably quit running logistics, if not the game... opps!
---
Where is Sort Dragon did he miss the flight?
---
If you don't have 2-3 hours a day to devote to the game don't bother, Hilmar's latest focus is to turn the game into even more of a time sink than it already was because he thinks this will somehow attract more players.
---
spoiler alert CCP provided the source
---
&gt;What happened to good old fights and roaming gangs eh.
---
metagame changed, price tag on supers in global be it tits or supercarriers is fuck all. If you get out with roaming fleet you'll get droped by 10-ish tits that will boson the shit out of you in 5th system no matter the region, that is exactly what happened to roaming gangs and good old fights. Its a "evolution" in gameplay, fucked up evolution, but evolution.
---
Says the guy that only lifes in lowsec and propably has never visited Null before. You are propably the one type of player that is affected the least from CCPs recent spasms.
---
&gt;then come to high-sec. safe, relaxing evironment for you. what's your problem?
---
I mean, his point still stands. When was the last time CCP gave half a fuck about highsec?
---
Like all eve actually is. Weaponized or gamified inconvenience. I'm looking at PI, as the most blatant example, but ratting and mining come a close second.
---
Jfyi, in your analogy alliance leaders are actually shepherds and middle management are the sheep dog.
---
[I think](https://giphy.com/gifs/SNOg2kA0gdIbe/html5)
---
"skill" 
---
lol
---
One man's inconvenience is another man's killmails.
---
I mean if that's your plan you could just stab yourself in the leg with a kitchen knife, it'd be less painful and more entertaining... :D
---
haha, made my day! ;=)
---
tried them, boring after some hours/week, not same as EVE.
---
anyway, about the player count, you can't know what is causing it. the IRL world changes so fast, more younger somebody -&gt; more dumb -&gt; more not an EVE player type. it was hard to get new players 10 years ago, and it's much more harder now because of the instantness of games and world. and you also have no idea how many of these people who left now are classic-wow players or people who just thing that ccp will reverse blackout if they not log in for some months. 
---
at the end, i just see one thing: easy ISK farming is coming to an end. big alliances are coming to an end. smaller organizations will raise.
---
You can still do this..
---
Procedure:
---
1. Someone lights a cyno in your system(Enemy JF comes thro)
---
2. ~~Warp your ibis cyno to their cyno and wait a few minutes~~
---
3. ~~Light your cyno~~
---
4. ~~Jump your JF thro and dock~~
---
5. ~~Enemy thinks it's just another JF cyno~~
---
6. Warp your Pilgrim cloaked to station at 10km.
---
7. Enemy JF undocks and presses warp to the HS gate
---
8. Decloak your Pilgrim and light
---
9. Jump Super throgh and alpha it
---
You can start burning an alt to system with a bomber to light for your JF the second you see something is gonna go down.
---
What are you even talking about?
---
The issue applies in ALL uses of cynos not just in bombers shooting rorquals.
---
Good God, man.
---
And that's a strategic advantage.
---
But basically your argument is "I have more people, I should always win." Which does not make good balance.
---
Especially when you want to talk about tactics then. Having more people isn't a tactic and that doesn't make a good game.
---
Totally agree with you!
---
what you miss about high-sec?
---
your corp is moving out of null into HS? you have to wonder what you guys were doing out in null in the first place...
---
^ Why I dislike Frenchies in videogames. They just can't stop speaking their language in english channels.
---
Well, for starters, you don't know how many of them are actually bots or how many of them got banned.
---
Note how your pictures don't share a single username.
---
anyone trying to get stuff out of Null in anything other than a JF runs this gauntlet every single time, risking their time (and everything in their hauler). thats why its hard to sympathize with this perspective.
---
Not goons the game
---
Lived in null for 5 years,lived in WH for 2 Years, Lived in Low for 4 years. You?
---
Not when people find less inconvenient forms of entertainment. 
---
This is a game, not a job. We don't have to log in and participate. Which seems to be the reaction looking at the nose diving pcu in recent weeks.
---
Well that myrmidon fleet doesnt have to be bots. You just fleet warp, deploy drones, auto agress, recall, warp, ...
---
You mean sit in the cabin drinking beer? Sounds good.
---
Eve will be dead before they get to this.
---
woah, hey there, this post seems a bit toxic to me
---
&gt;One man's inconvenience is another man's killmails.

[Like .... WTF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8_g09CzkGo)
---
I thought they joined init mercenaries the feeder/trial alliance. 
---
The amount of people they need to doxx before getting into proper init is a closely guarded secret.
---
&gt;I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. yada yada yada
---
Guess you also lived 5 years in Blackout Nullsec so your argument is valid, sorry.
---
I though the blackout's purpose was to reduce the amount of isk made in null so the market is not fucked, Plex prices are decreasing for example, and this is because of blackout one way or another.
---
Bullshit they say they ban bots but I don’t buy it.
---
The fuck is that? God help your corp mates if you don't use a proper boom mic like a civilised human.
---
Large extenders lmao
---
MEGADUNK
---
What changed for relic sites? Don’t hurt my babies
---
&gt;about the player count, you can't know what is causing it. 
---
LOL 6 YEARS of slow decline, then hilmar introduces "Chaos" and 10 THOUSAND accounts just vanish in 4 months... yeah we can see what is causing it.
---
Its more complicated than that.
---
As the game gets riskier and the reward stays the same its only natural that some people aren't finding the new risk/reward deal attractive. Now if CCP had faucets to spare, they could incentivize taking risks and undocking with better rewards even in the "inconveniently risky" situation. Unfortunately they didn't. So what happened instead was cutting the faucets to a sustainable degree. So you can't cite PCU drop with ignoring the huge reduction in faucets.
---
Basically just maybe there shouldn't be as many capitals farming in null as they have been so far anyway. You think not being able to cyno on the spot is inconvenient. Perhaps it was too convenient.
---
Admits he doesn't know anything about them, but maintains strong opinions.  Peak r/eve right here.

I dare you to sell it to treenewbie

&gt;Something Awful's (Goonswarm) goal was to destroy Eve
---
*citation needed*
---
Strong opinion? I made a joke about how they are publicly perceived. Nothing more. - If that constitutes a "strong opinion", I guess I have strong opinions about just about everything that I have ever heard about in my life.
---
Mate A+ for concept. F- for screenshot quality ....
---
Ok thats your problem
---
crys about a toxic post while posting a toxic post
---
Not just my problem it’s your problem as well.
---
Hilmar already bought a stake in his next cash cow, he doesn't even care how much longer this one lasts at this point.
---
1 year was the terms of the bonus incentive at the time of the sale to Pearl Abyss, that ends in October.
---
Oh I agree.  Just was interested in peoples perception.  The price of tits and super are just well ridiculous and should have been sorted by CCP before. It was too late.  I worry it's too late.
---
Same with citadels.  So wrong prices its untrue. They need to be at least 10x the cost they are now.
---
not if you're the reason it didn't run for 20 and all the money you made was wasted on your failed side projects because you're a shit manager.
---
They came to the game "not to ruining the game it was to ruin your game"
---
CCP is ruining their game and now they are bitter.
---
I up vote the link for this every time I see it. But he'll show himself out once he gets his bonus for the same in a month anyway, too bad the damage will already be done by that time.
---
More like mega-derp :)

LOW earth orbit, not stable earth orbit...

From my observations pre wow classic, strictly non scientific ofc, I’d say 5-6k characters have been lost because of it, was seeing 25.5-26k characters the week before launch on a Wednesday night Eu prime. Lots of eve players have made the switch and seem to be enjoying it in my social circles.
---
The red indicates people angry about the cyno change.
---
this is very true, 
---
report what we think are bots 
---
they're not banded ccp must not care about banding bots 
---
it couldn't be that they are real player
---
that said i do wish ccp would do a name and shame for all the bots and give players or corp/alliance leaders more tools to find bots
---
This would be so much better if it was destroyed ships.

I would like to know myself what the fuck is that thing on the picture and i do not envy its owner in any way.

MY CONTRIBUTION TO THIS THREAD: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
ITS WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING
---
then they got stabbed in the back and lost a shit ton of caps :(
---
Anyone here use a confessor for c2 wh ratting. I'm thinking of using it since my praxis takes ages to warp and it's such an easy target for cloaky ships. Meanwhile the confessor has a reasonably fast align time and hence it seems like a 'safer' choice to be running. Any tips/advice?
---
WOTZ DIS? A NON CAP? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGH!!!!
---
I'm looking forward to the wormhole reworks more so if it stops some partys from just rolling it.
---
Lets get more players to prolong their suffering &gt;:D
---
you are so wrong and you know it. without sheep you will have to fight the real wolf and we all know that *wormholer btw* does not a pvp'er make.
---
All 200 of you ? Nah the game needs more targets.
---
Aww ur cute. Grr more.
---
Local Chat/Blackout - The big complaint is that corp members cannot see eachother when in same system. EVE is about community and this does hurt the community. Perhaps allow instant local only to same corporation members. This way when you enter a system, you know your friends are there and you can say hello. "Feeling lonely in NS, join a corp !"
---
U got a corp chat and teamspeak dude are u talking about
---
Scariest trip in a DST ever
---
Google; use it
---
Cant you only get these in test space?
---
No I get them all over, OP misswrote Cable by typing frt ;)
---
my issue with the cyno change is more to do with the logistic side, the new industrail cyno to me is pure ccp punishment.  player complained about the need for cyno 5 and the loss of vigil cynos. 
---
ccp replied with well f you here industrail cyno now you need one of these new cynos and you need a T1 hualer then they did add t2 hualer but a hauler this was just a big f you to the logistic players 
---
i see the future of eve complain tell us this is wrong will make it far worse for you players
---
Oh wow you even have one of the older versions! I wrote that thing a bit over a year back but since I am a horrible FC I decided to just spread it until someone gave it a try... as for the added expense, I guess adding a sacrificial recon would not be that big a hurdle if you're willing to put a stack of rorqs on the line :)
---
If you ever plan on giving this a go, let me know!

Personally I rather watch Eve die than turn into instant-gratification-no-risk game for the masses.
---
Cool guys don't post [Idea] topics.
---
This reflects perfectly EvE.
---
While rest of eve is either moaning or ranting like angry mob, Imperium just haves fun in scales like no one other.
---
U need to be a dumb fuck idiot if u cant manage to do some isk on blackout,therefore your place is not in nullsec...last 2 years every1 got used to easy isk with no risk.Stop crying and HTFU
---
Same goes with the russkies and chinese.
---
Video aside, they were like budget PL back in the days.
---
That's why I don't really like the NPC Sotiyos and Trig Invasions.
---
You need a group to do it, but it only takes a single guy to rob you of all your rewards.

Except goons mantra of bluebell or hell dunk.

It has been 2 blocks for years.

The pimp doesn't get into the johns car does he?
---
That one doesn't work as well for higher-end modules as far as I know. It is trained on previous sales so higher-end stuff is sold less resulting in less accurate predictions.
---
That's funny, because all of them on here have been pissing and moaning. Maybe they're not the ones that play.
---
All right, I laughed pretty hard at this.

I mean, wormholers kill more ISK per capita than nullsec but sure, nice memes bro.

Take a break, go for a walk come back next spring.

3 images and 3 month of r/eve content...
---
I’ve already quit the game but this sub is all that is left from my interest. Goodbye capsuleers. Fly safe. Still patiently waiting for a CCP FPS.
---
well the real problem is that other games are more convenient and less grindy. so when you tip the balance towards inconvenience then you also move a portion of players to somewhere else
---
I'm not against restricting cynos, and removing them from all caps and industrial capitals. But this might be to restrictive.
---
1) easier to avoid escalation. Riskier to escalate via a cyno that's going to die stopping parts of the fleet from getting on grid, and  spreading caps that was jumping around the system. And hinders reinforcement from getting in.
---
2) maybe for a small'ish groupe. But a roaming fleet with caps on standby sounds like someone that should have eyes in hostile stageing before escalating. Your going to miss the odd dread bomb seeded in by 3rd parties, but if your staged in the area with caps you should know what the locals are doing. But yes now you can easily see if someone can fit cynos and avoid the risk, and you can only dunk on stuff with caps, that can't respond with caps.
---
3) the people that is droping caps on everything will still be droping caps on everything. Especially since they know that fleet can't have a cyno.
---
Each Alliance/Group has their whiners and moaners. FUCK THEM!  
---
\#votewithyourwalletnotmouth
---
Butttt, that's not what we are talking about here.  Smh.
---
Cyno changes are too restrictive and won't hurt big blocks who will soon adapt to them (by having a cloaked recon sitting next to their ratting super, or putting it in their SMB). It's small groups who will get hurt the most as they won't be able to afford to lose a recon every time they move their cap. Why couldn't CCP just prevent cynos from being fitted to caps and corvettes and limit the amount of ships that could jump through a cyno?
---
I hope that CCP one day realized this is a problem and introduces a deployable cyno, it would take 30 or 60 seconds to online, wouldn't have much ehp and would generate a beacon just like ship-generated ones.
---
All this old Players saying get good to fresh players thaht can barly fly there ship becose of Skillpoints 😆
---
Don't bother man. They've weaponized sock puppet accounts to try to change the narrative on r/Eve. Funny how all these Goonies were getting downvoted to oblivion a few weeks ago, and now all of a sudden they have a newfound popularity.  I don't see any opinions changing, just a massive amount of upvotes for them and downnvotes now for their opposition.
---
*Intact Armor Plates* and *Enhanced Ward Consoles* no longer drop from relics. They can only be salvaged from T2 player wrecks now.
---
good meme
---
group up the guns ya zkb whore
---
imo  cyno changes are knee shot but with panzerfaust..ccp didnt want that leg anyway..
---
\&gt;implying people won't just up and quit
---
And that is bad?
---
Want zen farming full krab mode, go to Highsec. Want fun pewpew, get into low sec. Want hardcore feudal battles get into nullsec. This is how must be.
---
PS: want be semi authistic turbo krab. Get in a bearhole. XD.
---
I look forward to it appearing on my killboard!

Goodbye cancer-tier game mechanics.

good effort!

Legs just slow you down.

Caugh me with my guard down. LOLED so hard in my Office. XD

Can I bring my drake?

As i know, more cyno makes drake stronger.

Try fit cynos as many as you can :)
---
One man's inconvenience is another man's blue balls.

FTFY.

I guess Seagull was fired for the massive loss in players that was caused with Citadel patches and Lifeblood Rorqual/Moonmining. From 55-65 thousand logged in accounts in Saturday EU prime in 2015/early 2016 down to 25 to barely 35 thousand logged in accounts right BEFORE blackout, despite people sporting SP-Farms up to 180 accounts or Mining-Multiboxes around 50 Accounts.
---
Making dumb statements,
---
Not realized I was the one who ran it :)
---
All the haulers are safe now! Hurrah!
---
I'm thrilled to hear that your cheating friend was permanently removed from EVE like he rightfully deserves.
---
2 years? Try about 5 or 6 years.
---
This is the key statement ... " Remember it takes a long time to get a new player addicted and right now players are leaving faster than new ones are even signing up. We need to desperately retain our existing players and try our best to get the old ones to return. "
---
Like many others I've willingly sunk a lot of my spare time and hard earned money into the game . At a certain point it becomes hard to justify it when there is a lot less going on in the game. What is the point in accumulating wealth and assets when they cannot be shared directly or indirectly with others.
---
I've played and continue to play many different aspects of the game from pvp, industrialist to explorer and I cannot think of a worst time (since I started playing 3+ years ago) for all but one of those activities.
---
I have very little confidence that the game designers know what they are doing other than to completely turn off the taps (i.e. to reset the game in some regards) and hope that they don't bleed too many players in the process.
---
Not far from truth.
---
Probably 90%.
---
Was that an intended change? Quite spooky if it was, would be interesting to hear the reasoning behind it
---
What about slyce procurer's though?
---
They're the collateral damage here like WHers were when HICs first were going to be changed.
---
Well, there was not more before blackout. Your koolaid rush all makes you think its blackout that made space empty, no it was proven by all official stats that the Citadel and the Lifeblood patch made logged in accounts plummet by 50 % in just 2 years. 55-56k EU prime saturday before Citadels, 25-35k EU prime saturday BEFORE blackout.
---
Yes, all null people are bots and should leave
---
Have fun with that
---
Uh.  Then why the changes
---
CCP, mostly.
---
A lot of them already log in Alphas. CCP doesn't really do much unless they're multiboxing and entire fleet of them.
---
Yeah, I am pissed that I won't be able to gank freighters anymore, which was my favourite EVE activity. I'm expecting that people like OP will now regularly carry dozens of billions of isk in their triple cargo expanded freighters through Niarja while waving CODE agents in local goodbye just to add more salt to my wound.
---
Be the change you want to see.
---
If not you, who?
---
Yeah -\_-
---
Then maybe use less capitals?
---
Because the moment you even look at a hunter threateningly they run at 8km/second and cloak until they think you’re afk again
---
https://imgur.com/Ixzpjs6
---
Until after downtime ?
---
no, i like bots, they bitch and moan less than the average eve player and are also better at the game
---
Low hanging fruit is always the easiest
---
Isnt true. At least for Area 52, they are moving to another Null area.
---
How was he using 2 alphas at same time? You know for science
---
&gt; Goonswarm Federation
---
&gt; the game needs more targets
---
Easy answer to that one, sport.
---
Nop. Área 52 is moving to another Null area.
---
you must be new to eve
---
Just remember to align when you land, cap up, switch on your hardeners and be ready to warp!
---
they would be brown as three colours always do (purple is red and blue)

I find it kinda interesting that this is the most upvoted comment while at the same time WoW classic (tedium ad nauseum) is so popular right now with gamers in general.
---
attempted white knight
---
They "doesent have" to be bots but they are, otherwise it would be impossible that they all 12 recall drones exactly at same time when some hostile enters the system while they have eyes in the gate. I know what i say because 3 corpies where cloaky observing them at same time when another 4th corpie entered the system and we saw their instant reaction of all 12 ships. If I'm posting this is because i'm completely sure they are bots and this is just a single sample of many dozens of bots that can be found ratting in Deklein daily. In fact everybody in the game knows (maybe everybody except you?) that this 3 alliances in Deklein are plenty of botters. If your answer to the question "why is this happening?" is going to be "this isn't happening" then you can keep it to yourself, thanks. Negationism doesn't help.
---
&gt; by having a cloaked recon sitting next to their ratting super, or putting it in their SMB) 
---
how do you imagine that would work?   
---
I would say that it will happen like this, in steps :  
---
1. you will get tackle and cyno lit + inhib anchoring + you ping 
---
2. enemy fleet jumps in starts to work on you
---
3. response fleet is ready, you decloak and light cyno 
---
4. same tick if possible, your recon gets deleted - you get what ships clicked fast, inhib is up you're fucked. 
---
tbh I don't think you could rat now without a guard fleet within gating distance, better in system, better on grid.
---
No, don't you read Imperium press statements from bbtb? All bots are still running and have already adapted to changes, they only die now because ... ermm ... idk. 
---
It is all hard working real players (in Imperium definition people that only semi-afk-multibox their 30 Mining Ships without input broadcast during Netflix session) that now quit the game ...
---
in fairness, it was necessary to do a PS and show all of the petition where you begged the CCP to return the dead succubus lalka
---
rip your karma, my boy :(
---
Probably the best non random, not extremely boring money in high sec. Little over 10k LP and like 5 mil in mission rewards, plus whatever drops from the burner itself.
---
You describe the begaviour of a competent, self-sustaining player. You have to be the opposite and in one of the large Nullsec-Empires to understand the REEEEEing ;-)
---
They changed the wardec mechanics and invaded it with Trigs. Do you even play?
---
Capitals can't fit cynos anymore. Ever again.
---
"getting good" in EVE has only a small part to do with skillpoints.
---
If the random Nullsec Miner would inject to 250 Mio. Skillpoints being able to fly all ships maxxed, he still would not be good automatically ..., onthe other side you have good players that can wreck players with many SP with 30 day old chars ....
---
Yes strange. but is it because people are mostly moving from null to high or because activity in null is going down.  [https://i.imgur.com/xn7jSH4.png](https://i.imgur.com/xn7jSH4.png)
---
It's because highsec is safe to bot, lol
---
1. You’re from Vietnam: you’re officially awesome!
---
2. Translation software has its limits, that’s not your fault. You can try to write shorter sentences [they are easier to correctly translate].
---
3. I like your idea, I would like for it to be airtight. The way you write it, and the way I understand it, a few steps are superfluous.
---
I just use my webcam mic..never had any complaints?
---
mission rewards increase with the mission level and agent's residence security rating. Where the mission takes place has no impact on the rewards (at least that's how I recall it worked)   
---
The agents have also a radius (in jumps) in which they can ask you to do missions (2-5?). Ideally you would want an agent in a 0.5 security system surrounded by hisec systems for 5 jumps (pretty much non existent).

It is called chaos era because it makes people feel like they’re “dangerous” which is hilmars marketing.
---
People want to kill other people in eve to feel badass and smart, and if they fail at that it is like crashing from a high they’re chasing.
---
The issue is, defenders don’t play eve to be a shooting gallery for people who can’t stomach challenge, and these changes are trying to force that.  “Null is too safe” is a sexy political phrase that is soooo much better than “Just farm up and pick your targets knowing what they have.”. 
---
Someone will always be more prepared than you, and it’s easier to run and cloak up and think you’re “smart” and point the finger at the “safety of the krabs” instead of realizing that... you can do everything they’re doing, and with the advantage of surprise.
---
there’s nothing “chaotic” about a frigate fleet that runs when you fart at them.  There’s nothing “dangerous” about shooting a pve ship that is just some dude or gal watching tv enjoying their night off work.  
---
It’s just a way to make hunters feel good about themselves.  It fits eves narrative of a literal epeen simulator for most.  It’s an edgelord paradise...
---
But “effort” doesn’t feel good for edgelords.  unless it matches their idea of what is intelligent.  Cynos and capitals have existed for 10+ years, it isn’t a new idea.  For the most of eves history, they were used to be aggressive.... and it was used by hunters.  Until now.  
---
It isn’t “chaos.” It’s appealing to a group that NEEDS to feel like its “justified” and make them feel like THEY ARE THE DANGERRR to enjoy eve.  
---
And... the changes are t fun for anyone else.  Because to make those the danger, it has to handicap everyone else in the entire game to prevent the hunter from trying too hard.
---
That isn’t fun.  it won’t be fun.  And for those it will be, they’ll quit the moment they lose or get bored again
---
only if you let me back into origin, i'm trying to blow up my super
---
Personally I disagree. I have probably krabbed for a grand total of 3 hours in my entire career. I play this game solely for the PVP/FCing aspect. I have 7 accounts, 18 characters, all of which have a combined gross worth of .239 trillion isk. That's all pure USD that flowed into the game via PLEX. Definition of a faucet^
---
I saw content availability for null fleets drop a few months ago, and that combined with the need for a short irl break led me to drop it for a while. When I wanted to come back two weeks ago, I decided to wait out my subscriptions to see if PCU/bad mechanics/pings in discord/etc all changed in a positive manner to promote engagement. So far I haven't been convinced.
---
Is every player like me? No. Are some? Probably. There are a lot more faucets in this game than you think.
---
Can't defend shit if your alliance is 99% botters.
---
Also if any of the real actual players in Frat can't even bother to help, fuck it...Gobbins should just hard reset them. Like why even bother having Frat as allies when they won't even help us defend their home and most likely wouldn't come to help defend Horde in TKE?
---
Random koolaid drunk Hisec pubbies mistakenly recruited into Nullsec by KarmaFleet, Brave Newbies, dreddit, Horde or the likes in the last 2-3 years, thinking it has to be Hisec in their nullsec, downvoting Tobias Ketterburg, this game really is in a sad state :-( ....
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
simply because the real world doesn't allow you the luxury of not logging in, which is exactly what the sheep you are talking about are doing now in eve, when confronted with the slightest risk.   
---
In RL if you are at a risk of losing some of your work with an action, you factor that in and see if you're still positive. In eve, them sheep don't agree with that, which causes them to log off and unsubscribe.
---
Fair enough
---
So what you are saying isbthe only fights you can take are against ratters and it's taken CCP making hunting easier for you to be able to do it?
---
Sounds about right

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low\_Earth\_orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit): "The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is in a LEO \[...\] and needs reboosting a few times a year due to orbital decay."

No immediate plummeting here. Though you could say Eve is like a satellite in LEO that has run out of fuel. :)
---
Ungrouped launchers .... Dalikah is that you ?

Their corp/alliance leaders know pretty well they have bots, in fact many of their corp/alliance leaders in this 3 alliances are also botters. If you investigate just a little bit you can discover for example that at least 4 corps that are actually in Gemini Whale were booted from their previous alliances because they are botters and some other Gemini Whale corps are created by players of Ranger Regiment and exclusively populated by his bot alts. but the most sad in the case of myrmidons is that they are not only bots but alpha bots and CCP isn't neither banning them for botting or for alpha clone abuse.
---
Keep your paranoia level as it is....it will keep you safe in the game in the long run...just make yourself used to the idea of having to double check everything and accept losses in between gains.

In other words CCP decided to do the work of gsf themselves?

Or maybe people are starting to realize just how shit all these changes are.

Ayyy I see myself in that list!

Biggest loser excuse ever. Go play a different game then. Where do you get off thinking people are entitled to 100% safety?
---
"These changes arent fun for anyone else" you can do all those activities in relative safett...  go to high sec where you belong.
---
And also....taking away risk free ratting js not handicapping you. Use dscan..rat with a friend...mine with an active defense fleet...etc etc. 
---
Sounds like you mad that you cant achieve top end in game isk and rewards with little to no risk.
---
That kill gonna be the best of the little Astra...
---
Risk should result in reward in eve online. I don’t think any reasonable person will disagree with you on that point. But it shouldn’t be the deciding factor. By that line of thinking, the most officer fit faction titan in the game is risking the most, and thus should be the most effective tool, but that’s absurd. The eve rewards system is logarithmic, with diminishing returns. You spend astronomically more on that titan to get slightly improved stats in certain categories. Just because a side spends the most isk does not mean that they should automatically win.
---
K bye
---
I have greatly enjoyed Blackout as well. I am looking forward to the cyno changes as well.
---
Blackout brought back a lot of the null sec fights I loved. I believe cyno changes will generate sub-cap response fleets which was always my favorite part of null.
---
A lot of the squealing you see here are from some who enjoy trolling / shit posting and others who have had it way to easy for a long time.
---
Just ignore the first, the second will come around I believe once the dust settles.
---
Show me on the doll where Mittani has touched you
---

Good meme

no but cyno shield fit sigil
---
We had dudes dropping on the PL side as well - lots of weight on what I'm fairly sure was an non-reinforced node.  Impressive that it held as well as it did, to be honest.  Great vid, by the way, excellent song choices.
---
Or maybe real players (people who actually play) have stopped reading the cesspool that is /r/eve, just like they announced
---
Abandoned the official forums, eons ago, for the exact same reason.
---
Nice echo chamber though, the acoustics are great
---
Ratting income from highsec is a lot less compared to null. Most likely to a point where its not just worth it.
---
But then again training bot to do lvl 4 missions takes a bit more time and is probably spotted a lot easier since there are more people in highsec going around.
---
Do not go gentle into that good night
---
God, you even created an account to point it out sam lalka.
---
Yes but you and the guy you replied to have totally opposite reasons for your wish. He wants local back and no change at all to Citadels/Rorquals/Umbrellas. You are mad at Hilmar for implementing exactly this shit ...
---
Same to cloak hunters. 
---
Risk averse fag
---
As we have almost no standards whatsoever, possibly some of them will cycle through INIT. Mercs, IDK. If they work out well under better leadership and FCing, great, if not then that's fine too.
---
When they shut down the servers the game will finally be free of all the bots. Way to got CCP!
---
Who the shit is area 52
---
So you are saying the only change is less bots in null sec, and that is the cause in the drop in rating, mining and production?
---
I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
---
Note how pictures show clearly character names in overview so it's clear you are negating a very well known fact without even looking twice at the pictures and introducing the CCP propaganda about the problem. Is interesting how hurried you were trying to introduce doubts about the bots phenomena without even checking the info provided about it and makes me doubt about your real intentions. It reminds me to some other interested campaings of negationism. I'm curious, what do you think about climate change?
---
Sure let me just google "is alphaempire full of shit and making shit up to support his opinion?"
---
Why we shaming BL all of a sudden.
---
Wow classic has the appeal of nostalgia, eve doesn't even have that illusion to numb you to the obtuse obstruction that is the game itself.
---
If I said that my comment would have been that
---
Who said I was going anywhere?
---
Honestly I agree.  I’ve been playing other games and don’t have any desire to login to eve anymore.
---
Fastest lootscripter in eve
---
No you don’t lol.  
---
All one really needs to do at face value is read this shit sub (and your comment history) to find aimless toxicity.
---
What null sec fights have you gotten now that you wouldn't have gotten before? How has having local made more people fight you?
---
lol, another one without the ability to read and understand statistics ... just spitting what koolaid burnt into his brain ...
---
So its okay to eviscerate a games population in order to remove an aspect of the game that provides targets for those of you who think you are super-leet? 
---
This is just reductive thinking. You are happy that one play-style is getting absolutely shit on, because in your head you've convinced yourself its completely risk-free (which its not, it never is), without realising its actually going to kill your play-style of hunting too. 
---
My mind boggles at this kind of thinking.
---
Or instead of more faucets, reduce risk.
---
Look at vni ratting. Low risk low reward.
---
It was only a problem because ccp are shit at dealing with botters.
---
Yes, because we want even MORE people to leave eve. You really don't want an eve online do you? You actually want it to die?
---
Nonsense, this inconvenience was never required to change the game up. CCP has everything it requires to change the game up, but they never manage to get it right, ever.
---
still not killed 20% of the login numberst that citadel and Lifeblodd killed .... (2015/16 pre citadel ca. 55-65k logged in Saturday EU prime, end of 2018 PRE balckout 25-35k logged in Saturday EU prime)
---
this 100%. players similar to myself need to acknowledge that our play style exists simply for epeen points.
---
we 100% expect nullblocs to be ez turbofarms when we have 3 dudes meticulously comp’d up in HGs and 2bil ships. 
---
however that being said, we are the ones who travel the 30 jumps, scan the wormholes, and end up in 0.0 stagings just to get blue balled or blobbed/hard countered.
---
the “home defense meme” is really stale at this point because bringing hard counters to a group of people you already outnumber is a cheap way to deter a fight and deny everyone content. home defense is applicable to when groups are bashing or going after ratters/krabs.
---
sure one might think: “but small gangs already hunt for krabs”. Yes but this is solely to provoke a response, we aren’t hunting krabs for the loot or tears, we want dynamic spaceship vs spaceship gameplay, which undocking a jackdaw fleet/ferox fleet/doctrine fleet doesn’t accomplish.
---
Personally, I think the game has seen a huge culture change. Perhaps it’s purely about skill points/injectors/increase in average game knowledge but when you compare fights from videos like Kil2 and Kovorix, people are different in how they respond to a solo/duo/trio or players in 0.0.
---
I'm loving it. 
---
Last night we had a guy mining in orcas that got tackled by some elite micro gang of wormhole pvpers he didn't have any cynos.
---
I burned an alt in a fast moving cheetah over that happens to be a couple jumps out and equipped with a covert cyno. 
---
I get in, blops bridge my falcon cyno ship, and light, in comes his fax my fax and my super. 
---
Saved the day. 
---
The cyno change are going to make blackout even more fun and interesting adding a new dynamic to capital projection. Also, this guy got a good spanking for not having his own cloaked recon on grid for a cyno. If they had a inhib up, it could have taken an extra 30-60 seconds to get the caps on grid!
---
OMG SOME GUY THINKS THE GAME IS DEAD
---
I know its hard to understand words, but he didn't say eve is dead, he said that CCP are going to kill the game. Words eh?
---
Anyone mind explaining what's going on? Guessing that's a heat-map of the number of cyno's lit. But why so many there?

Don't say that about one of your alliances main people, tuzzy,

1. Plenty. We have had a sustained 1k jump in kills per month since these changes hit.

2. No local means no perfect intel for the defenders. It also means a higher chance of bumping into other roaming gangs. End result is more fights.

Or because he just spent 3 days at their hq listening to them being retarded?

Changes to make 3IQ hunters feeling better :  NOT OK

Yep /u/CCP_Falcon will like you. Keep up with those mental gymnastics.
---
At the company I worked for previously, they used to have a meeting on Monday to arrange the week's meetings.
---
WAT?
---
Well, to fight the 50-Rorqual-Alts + "i got 4 Titans on the Keepstar" meta you need alts simple as that. Its not him leading that developement, it was always Crabs that developed peak autism first (gaara 50-boxing Chimeras with input broadcasting in 2012 already)
---
Yes and no. Yes, it helped see if potential targets were in the system you were looking. If no one was in local, on your way you go. If there were some, you spend a few seconds checking around. With a seemingly short supply of viable targets this was helpful in determining if you were to spend time in a system or not. Now, couple that with no local, and the same selection of targets, if not lower, it's easier to just not spend time logging in and trying to find something. If that jumble of words makes some sense.
---
Exooki is also not wonderfully confident atm.
---
Olmeca is on the fence
---
Has any csm said they are confident in the direction ccp are going
---
He's right tho. I'm a terrible PvPer and only know the theory from reading a lot about it. But once Blackout hit you just have to undock and go to the nearest high ADM system and wait a couple minutes. Then you just bomb the nearest Hulk and get out again. It's so brainless
---
OP was talking about fights which make headlines -- your B-Rs and X47s -- no one doubts that people swing supercaps around but it's a question of scale.
---
WHERE DID EXZOOKI DISPLAY HIS DISPLEASURE, OR OLMECA? ALL IM LEGIT SEEING IS JUST THE NULLBLOC DUDES REEEING

RIP: Eve, died of Reddit poisoning
---
thank you for warm words &lt;3
---
I'll mention this but you'll vote it into oblivion. Just a thought... maybe... just maybe... you might want to look at all the people that AREN'T playing the game and look at ways to grow the game. Any business must grow faster then inflation to maintain itself. If you do not cultivate and grow, you die a slow death. Where is the CSM that represents the potential players? Where is the initiative to make the game appealing to a broader audience? Nahh HTFU attitude and culture... that will work... Eve Online the Freemasons of the MMO community.
---
No you continue the same systemic behavior that was baked in when the CSMs came along. It's what killed the MMO market in general, a loss of vision and a transformation of a creative product into a product by committee. You are tuning your product for retention only, not growth. And right on cue CCP trying another hap-hazard attempt at a new product a day late and a dollar short because to TL;DR this whole decade long problem with Eve:  
---
Eve Online is held hostage by it's own player base and could never grow or evolve. Drowned in the ocean of better vet tears where the game play of the 99% is dictated by the whims of a tiny 1%.  
---
"Asymmetric warfare is only an interesting game-play mechanic when volatility is high."
---
It's terrible is what it is.
---
It is calculated on the server.
---
The thing is, this issue was created by a change entirely focused on destroying one particular play-style. Even though so many other changes could have been put in place instead, it was simply  nuked and made practically redundant without a super-cap umbrella. The cyno changes take that even further. Cyno changes certainly needed to happen but the ones CCP decided upon are ridiculous. 
---
Its a mentality of inconvenience, a mentality to attempt to punish the player for no reason at all. 
---
Eve was an ecosystem that required all play-styles to function, Hunters, the hunted, pvpers, pvers and everyone else. One preyed on the other, its how the game has worked for years, but with this change, one side has seen a dramatic shift in risk to reward, something even CCP has admitted, but has done nothing to fix. 
---
There are idiots who want to shit on other peoples playstyles, many of us are not those people, you enjoy your playstyle, and if it means you dunk me or I dunk you, so be it, but nuking a playstyle for the sake of rallying players with a feeling of being badass hunters, when there are far less people to be hunted now, is just bullshit.
---
EVE is Pearl Abyss's game now - so CCP can go wherever they want, but it'll be PA running the show if they don't go in the right direction.
---
You must be forgetting wspace because they generate around 40% of the isk with much less players.
---
Also thst is fine to want low risk Tobe highsec but there are two problems.first after these changes nullsec will be extreme risk medium reward compared to other space. Only supers and rorqs have a chance of surviving being dropped and that is being made harder. Second, thus is player generated security not concord enforced and people drastically over estimate the level of safety while under estimating the effort to do it. These changes require an equal number of players to nearly instantly respond or even supers and rorqs are dead then there will be no one making in nullsec. The risk vs reward is way over on risk.
---
typing on reddit is not playing eve, sorry
---
WHAT PLAYSTYLE WAS NUKED?
---
I had a discussion with Falcon a month or so ago where he simply ignored most of what people were saying with regards to the blackout changes, continued to push it publicly, and pretty much clapped on the blackout enthusiasts telling people to quit.
---
Not as integers, hence the rounding errors you can often experience.
---
Hello empty space
---
Personal opinion: Ive been playing since 2003, I want eve to live longer than I do.
---
I understand you are crusty. Literally none of the changes have taken away your ability to krab in safety. Just do it on comms, get yourself a survivable cyno that you can warp in at a moment's notice, be in a standing fleet.
---
The weak will be chewed up and spitten out, the strong with many alts and friends to back them up, will prosper and profit greatly now that so many have given up krabbing.
---
I don't krab but I can say I greatly enjoy saving them from micro gang elite pvpers who scatter like cockroaches when I show up.  You need to get in a group with people who enjoy that. 
---
I have a spy in an certain alliance. This alliance runs a standing fleet that has 100+ guys in it. They rat in systems where people hang out in space. When ratters get tackled they write a code in fleet and within seconds 20 friendlies warp in from all directions. Ive taken part and hot damn its surprisingly fun content you get a ton of very blingy T3C kills and it's a revolving stream of kills at that. Maybe you need to join a group like this.
---
Look at dotlan and look at the indexes of systems in nullsec.
---
It's hard to justify 7 accounts on my end when there's not much happening. If I didn't just move and still in the process of selling my house, maybe then I would just keep them subbed. With not much going on it made it quite easy to unsub all of them for the time.
---
Fewer isk printing afk machines is good for the game.
---
And just wait and see vOv
---
Thank god the office tour is optional.

How is it a cat and mouse game when the cat has a cloak?

---
3. Cyno Changes: ‘CCP isn’t listening to Goons, trying to kill the game!!!!!’
---
You realise that interacting with the eve community could be considered part of eve, oh and the fact that most eve players have multiple screens and run in window mode for multitasking! Crazy stuff!

That's easy. People who used to hang out on r/eve where those who were cockblocked by cpitals online. Now they either left the game and r/eve or are actually enjoying the game because of black out. So now the people on r/eve are those who can't turbo krab safely and drop supers and are now jobless and whining on r/eve.

You have no proof and no empathy. It could be 5000 real players and you would be celebrating because they don't play the way you want.
---
truth hurts ...
---
Fact.
---
UR NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION THO WHAT PLAYSTYLE WAS NUKED?
---
Hello new groups filling power vacuums.
---
Because the changes were not predicated on how well each side could insult the other.
---
NOT JUST GOONS BUT THEY SPERGED THE MOST
---
Hard facts of "China is botting and I have no proof"
---
Why would the bots only run during China hours?
---
AH OKAY I DONT HAVE THE TWITTERSPHERE. 
---
WAT ABOUT EXZOO AND THE REST OF THE GANG?
---
group your launchers you fucking barbarian
---
HOW DARE THEY HAVE FUN!
---
Answering you will simply mean another retort of yours, probably a copypasta. Go look at dotlan, its quite easy to see indexes and what has happened to them.
---
Enjoying a night off work? Yeah, I don't particularly enjoy roaming solo for an hour or so with nothing to show most of the time. Nor do I enjoy mining/ratting - so I've been playing games I can actually consistently enjoy.
---
Also the convenience fee that just got slapped on using my 1 rorqual as a cheaper JF for moving my t2 prod is real fancy.
---
#iwasthere
---
Lol
---
The good ones don't Juan. We leave.
---
Goons are pretty much unaffected by the changes considering the numbers they have. It is the smaller alliances that are folding/losing numbers. Empire building eh?
---
NO IM LEGITIMATELY CURIOUS AS TO WHAT PLAYSTYLE YOU THINK WAS NUKED
---
FUCKING CAPSLOCK SHOULD BE FIXED SOON, I THINK THERE'S A CRUMB STUCK UNDER THE DAMN THING. I HAD ONE OF THOSE STUPID NATURE'S VALLEY GRANOLA BARS THAT FALL APART THE SECOND YOU UNWRAP IT AND HERE WE ARE. IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING CAUSE IM ALSO HAVING A FB CONVO WITH MY MOM.
---
This assumes that the losses in PCU are primarily alts - fewer people multiboxing. I don’t know if that’s a safe assumption at this point. ]]
---
Supers ratting wasn’t an inconvenience for anybody - it was content for a lot of people. Cynoing on the spot wasn’t an inconvenience either - it was a tactic you had to be prepared for.
---
I think you’re going to be unpleasantly surprised that your entire style of gameplay for the last couple of years is now officially dead.
---
It's more a question of your interminable reply nauseates.
---
Drop your supers, then I'll show up.
---
Because they don't want to. Not everyone plays the game the same way you do.
---
Besides, chasing nano kitey cloaky bullshit around is boring.
---
Hilmar literally said he has no idea what made eve good, how is that him grasping eve at its core?
---
Kthx for the link, did not have it handy in office. Tiericide era from 2012 to 2016 was great, I know you were in PL and do think different about Phoebe patch in that timespan, but over all it was the best time concerning activity and the meta letting non-blobs accomplish something actually.
---
Feel like donating me that loggerhead?
---
lmao
---
How could one have proof? Are you saying bots are not affected?
---
If you want to play in null, you should have to deal with risk.
---
You can run multiple alpha accounts by rapidly click on the play button in both accounts. You can also do that by having virtual machines.
---
for sure
---
Olmeca, I know we generally don't see eye to eye, but being deadass serious, how are you planning on collecting killmails on guys like myself who are just *not* doing things in delve? I'm not gonna reset my progress on industry just to shell out for a JF's affordable cynos option, I'm just going to make my isk off abyssals when I need to top up. If I even login to endure the tedium of peeveepee.
---
Many people are trying something else unfortunately for eve, that something else is usually another game.
---
krabbification is killing
---
Full stop: Except it's not getting riskier for hunters.  
---
 The scale of risk for a target being hunted vs. the scale of risk for a 20 or 30 or 50 or 100 man bomber fleet is so far to one side it's not even on the same page.   
---
You want even?  Make covert cynos 150m and prevent BLOPs from bridging bombers. Remove covert cynos from T3Cs.  Now you have a parity on cynos and on ability to escalate.
---
Okay, this is actually pretty clever. 
---
Well done m8!
---
Bl were the only group back in the day who hunted pl and had the balls to engage
---
When was the last headline-grabbing fight? The last big news I recall was the million dollar battle that never happened. That's the state of Eve as far as headlines go, and that's probably what ccp wants to shake up.
---
Capital mobility may force some tweaks to this change, but it's not a reason to throw out the whole concept. The whole point of my post was to talk more about what the desired result is, NOT whine about every possible consequence.
---
As for JFs, I'm not sympathetic in the least. Theyre part of the reason the economy is the way it is.
---
Lol, I have never been in PL
---
Guy just told what his overlords wanted him to say im pretty shure he had a gun to his head by some other goon people

---
I thought it was 15,000 in the first 6 months and 950 in July?
---
Your mom thinks you are angry! Oh shiii... lol
---
This requires a far greater post than I have the patience to write at the moment, but essentially, smaller alliance are getting shit on. The larger mega-blocks are fine with the changes, the numbers and bandwidth allows them to deal with more change. However, the playstyles that are getting fucked over here are PVE'ers, miners, ratters and the like. While many people hate on these types of players, and people refer to them as bots in most instances, they do keep the game flowing, providing targets for hunters, minerals for ships, etc. ADMs have plummeted since the inception of the "Chaos era" (Which should be known as the inconvenience your playerbase era).
---
AT ships took time away from CCP doing what they do best
---
releasing new skins
---
You say that as if shooting ships that couldn't fight back was not easy before. It's just less time consuming because they don't know you're there.
---
:Tinfoil:
---
The picture shows names, but no repeated names over time.

For all you presented, they could all have been banned.

Their sperging would indicate otherwise ...

what happened and will continue to increase is seeing those pvp er dudes that actually do the thinking do part time pve ing to support their activities. 
---
might get us incredible things like people reshipping at indy command ships, defense fleets on grid, etc. 
---
also it may turn eve into a game, where people log in for a few hours to play instead of the huge time sink it is now.
---
what the change does is de incentivize or soft cap at least the amount you can rat safely. This isnt bad, we might see a return of t1 hulls, drop in faction deadspace fits and an overall increase in ships dying.
---
So null sec for the most part isn't really changing
---
idk, I assume you can find that in some discord full of edgy memes
---
What toxicity?
---
I'm amazed how people still believe CCP reads this subreddit and take note of what people say.
---
Their sperging indicates inconvenience, nothing more.
---
SO YOU DONT ACTUALLY KNOW
---
THANKS FOR UR VALUABLE INPUT
---
I never claimed it was perfectly balanced.
---
But now there is at least some counterplay between attackers and defenders.
---
The cyno changes are going into effect, so people are using them while they can!
---
Though it is true wow classic has a lot of "walking" around doing mundane activities, it did require skill to play your class effectively. Most people absolutely suck at the game, especially tanks. Honestly could care less about nostalgia.
---
Ungrouped and mixed ammo!
---
NOOOO BROTHER.  LIFT THAT FLAB AWAY AND FILL THAT LOOSE SKIN WITH MUSCLE. 
---
\*TEARS OFF SHIRT AND FLEXES\*
---
HES GOTTA GRAB SOME PLATES AND START GETTING SWOLE.
---
FIRST YOU START WITH SOME INCLINE PRESSES TO FILL OUT THE HEAD OF THE PECTORALS.  DONT FORGET TO WARM UP BROTHER - IT WILL HELP WITH YOUR LIFTS.  THEN YOU FILL IN THE BODY OF THE PEC WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF FLAT PRESSES. AND STAY AWAY FROM THOSE SISSY WORKOUT MACHINES BROTHER.  REAL MEN USE FREE WEIGHTS. DUMBELLS AND BARBELLS ARE THE REAL DEAL.
---
DONT FORGET TO WORK THE DELTS, LATS, AND TRAPS FOR THAT WELL ROUNDED BEASTLY LOOK! BE THE HULKAMANIAC YOU WERE MEANT TO BE BROTHER.
---
\*FLEXES\*
---
they change the ships you are able to fit them today. no more cynos on capitals for example.
---
Hopefully EVE
---
Salt has it about right. Corpmate offered me a fit bus for ~50 a couple weeks ago.
---
I still have hopes they reconsider their decisions. If Not then im gone. What will happen is that i am not alone with that and in the end it will be Like uo where only a couple hardcore players stay around until its forgotten
---
the cyno changes only just happened like an hour or so ago, so this read as i didn't klnow when the changes would happen or BS
---
Right, because RR was too exposed in Tenal itself without local, so they moved to Dek to consolidate with the rest of the GOTG capfleet.
---
&gt;.&gt;
---
The game was stagnating and isk has been deflating for three years straight while everyone farmed away. It's time for the change.
---
Bo is 1.5 month old , 10 % for 1.5 month; 20% for 3 years with citadell. Peraps come back to school to calculate a slope?
---
Then why assert something if you can't back it up a d then double down when people call you out.
---
And yes null should have risk but now the risk vs reward has killed all subcap ratting and today's change will kill a large portion of super/rorq because the risk has become unmanageable. There is more and safer isk to be made in highsec and people like you just keep screeching nullsec is to safe despite constant deaths.
---
Shhhhh the narrative must be maintained!!
---
 No local means no perfect intel for the defenders i'll agree this is a good thing but this is now a change from the free intel most talked about before the black out so i'll keep with my idea before the black out remove all free intel and allow a way to find cloaked ships in space.
---
&gt;ALSO FUCK MY CHEAP LAPTOP IS STUCK ON CAPSLOCK AND APPARENTLY RESTARTING WONT FIX IT FUCK
---
Try microwaving it. The heat might loosen up the caps lock key.
---
Who?
---
Falcon is more interested in Woke politics on Twitter. Honestly makes me concerned about the future of Eve beyond the changes.
---
The boogie man Relic bots caused this.
---
Never actually encountered one, but i hear about them all the time.
---
&gt; I am a pvper who is part of a big NS block. I had tried for months to do more solo roaming, with very disappointing outcome. I got frustrated, took more risks than necessary just to at least have 1 fight after 50 jumps in a region where all ratters docked up, and eventually died and learnt very little. 
---
so you're more or less saying that you couldn't learn to fight a pvp ship and wanted easy kills with ratting ships
---
Yes and no. It is time for **A** change, not this one, that accelerates the decline of players, that is quite blatant to see. It's not something that can be disputed now, even though many try. 
---
There are numerous other changes that CCP could implement to reinvigorate the game. Instead they kneecap a playstyle that is part of the whole "Build your own empire" line they have put out for years. 
---
Catalytic events need to be put in the game, things that will cause escalations and wars, not killing off PVE by fucking over the risk v reward ratio so much that ADMs have plummeted across eve, outside of the super-alliance areas.
---
theres always one, who will fck up)))
---
As always there are tons of nuances you're ignoring.
---
1) I am not assuming anything. I am only saying you can't cite the activity drop as the only result of blackout and ignore the macroeconomic side. Faucets were off the charts, space is made riskier, and now they are in check again. 
---
2) Now you all want to take back the changes and go back to the previous status quo. That would bring back the higher faucets and higher PCU. But if that's really what we want to do, then instead of taking back the changes, CCP could also triple the yield in null (or increase however much they need to achieve old faucet numbers) and achieve that keeping the blackout and cyno changes intact.
---
3) We are not idiots. We know there will be less capitals undocking. We also know other nuances. Like in an economy where capitals are valuable again, the capital/super/rorqual kills become meaningful again. Another nuance you are ignoring is this psychological effect which it really matters less numerically how many ships are dying, and matters more the proportion of the total farm that is dying.
---
4) It's really hard to rationally talk about null risk/reward with people who fixate on the short term graph of whats happening now and completely ignore long term. Everybody is talks about PCU. Nobody talks about how the macroeconomic sitution was already killing the game, and how the PCU drop was already there organically happening for years. It's easier to point out how many supers stopping their farm now. And harder to make people see the game as is was unsustainable, and we really need people spending less of their time farming in null and hopefully doing other things.
---
&gt; Cynoing on the spot wasn’t an inconvenience either - it was a tactic you had to be prepared for.
---
It reduced the survival condition in nullsec to a single button for too many people. It was convenient for the people enjoying that, inconvenience for the people getting titanblobbed because of that.
---
Yep. I did that content when it was new. I have no urge to replay it. I already know how the story ends.
---
5/5/3 cycling some dragon in blackwing lair after disarming traps in the suppression room.
---
It wasn't that hard, to be honest.
---
Hi mom!
---
Looks like them spectacles might be Polarized! Are you a WormholerBTW?
---
evening it out would actually mean limiting income over time not over space, as larger entities will just use their superior organisation to schedule farming. 
---
but that would get you downvoted faster than you can post, ofc :))
---
How equal and different is it from eve?
---
Can you please stop caps lock autistic screeching? Adults are trying to talk about the game we love.
---
Oh dont get me started avout tinfoil  i got a whole story ready linking ccp the goons and the drifters to jeffrey epsteins death    he was gonna expose a secret deal between the mittani and hilmar about staged profocations and false flag attacks
---
The increase and capital ratting and rorq changes already made it more dangerous for hunters.
---
You don't get to pick the time in the past 5 years that it was shittiest to be in space looking for kills and call that normal for all of eve.
---
whats wrong about it
---
they arent fucked though, they are just riskier in nullsec.  people that want to rat and mine all day can continue to do so, they just shouldnt expect the same rewards if they decide they dont want to put up with the risk...
---
It's going to become more and more certain that CCP is "balancing" null around having an umbrella on standby, and that all groups without an umbrella are fucked. With the Rorqual and local nerfs no group is getting a new umbrella together anytime soon, so smaller groups that want to live in null need to find an umbrella to hide under or be farmed to extinction by hunters looking for easy prey.
---
Asset safety, now that there is a mass exodus of players they need to incentivize looting all those assets that are collecting dust. That’s the new form of ratting.
---
FUNNY YOU SAY THAT. DO YOU HAPPEN TO BE PART OF A LARGE MEGABLOC, OUT OF CURIOSITY?
---
SMALL ALLIANCES THAT WANT TO DO FINE ARE DOING FINE. THE ONES WHO CANT HAD NO BUSINESS BEING IN NULLSEC IN THE FIRST PLACE. FOR EXAMPLE LET'S TAKE THE TRIBUTE SITUATION:
---
THERE ARE SEVEN MAJOR ALLIANCES LIVING IN TRIBUTE RIGHT NOW - ROTE KAPELLE, UNSPOKEN ALLIANCE, TRIGGER HAPPY, HAZARDOUS COMPANY, CENTIPEDE CALIPHATE, JUST-A-GAME, AND BANDERLOGS. EACH ONE OF THESE ALLIANCES HAVE THEIR OWN KRAB SYSTEM(S), AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SOV INDEXES, MINING, RATTING, COMBAT SITES, AND ACTUAL OWNERSHIP OF THE SOV/IMPROVEMENTS ARE BEING ROLLED OUT, ALL BE IT AT A SLOWER PACE THAN SAY A LARGE MULTI-THOUSAND CHARACTER ALLIANCE.
---
DESPITE ALL THIS KRABBING AND LIGHT EMPIRE BUILDING HAPPENING (MORE LIKE PUTTING UP STICKS NEAR A RIVER AND CALLING IT A CITY), TRIBUTE IS A SOURCE OF CONSTANT CONTENT. THE ALLIANCES LIVING THERE SPLIT INTO FOUR DISTINCT FACTIONS, WITH UNSPOKEN AND ROTE; TOXIC AND TRIGG; AND CENTI AND BANDERLOGS OUT BY THEMSELVES (BANDERLOGS ARE RUSSIAN AND ARE OUTSIDE OF THE TIMEZONE BY MOST OF THE OTHER GROUPS). AMONG THE CONSTANT FIGHTS AND CONTENT IN TRIBUTE, ROTE AND UNSPOKEN ARE ALSO FIGHTING REVERBERATION PROJECT AND FORSAKEN EMPIRE OUT IN VALE AFTER SOME JADE-LIKE POSTING BY LORDS SERVANT.
---
SO I REPEAT, SMALL ALLIANCES THAT WANT TO DO FINE ARE DOING FINE. PLEASE DONT SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AND CERTAINLY DONT CLUTCH AT PEARLS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PART OF A LARGE BLOC.
---
GRANOLA BAR INCIDENT, READ OTHER POST. IM WORKING ON IT.

I dont think that CCP is that self aware but it is a good hope.
---
Most games, even most live service multiplayer games, don't make it 15 years. Probably better than having Anthem or artifact on your resume.
---
Was the original author of that story Gevlon Goblin by chance?
---
So.. having more full bling pve fit carriers and supers... was dangerous to hunters? I didn't know those ships were out hunting hunters. Thanks for the heads up.... /SARCASMCAPSLOCK
---
Better start chain smoking then.
---
okay...  never  eat veldspar cookie after drinking arknor vodka.
---
Pretty sure it was told to you what the context was.  Its a meeting between CSM and CCP about Eve online's current state.
---
No   that was alex jones
---
&gt; The amount of times I am recklessly dropping shit atm...countercyno, cloaked shit in site.
---
What is opportunity cost.
---
&gt; Even when all the 5 Myrms in system (example is not bots) warp in to save the 6th Myrm my tackle will be forced off. Its so easy and we all could have more meaningful pvp gameplay and more content.
---
What is covert cyno goes up all 6 myrms die to bombers. There are plenty of groups running around in 100 man bomber fleets hunting supers, what can 6 myrms do to them?
---
Ooh they unbanned Erotica1
---
Player actions create chaos, not silly half assed changes. 
---
However id say inconvenience is important in mmos. Take skyrim fast travel for example. how many potenital encounters have you missed because instead of running yourself yo the next town you just teleported? Is the time saved worth it?
---
Well, they obviously aren't going to spread chaos to low sec. So... something nuking null sec. Still too many people living there.

&gt;SO I REPEAT, SMALL ALLIANCES THAT WANT TO DO FINE ARE DOING FINE. PLEASE DONT SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AND CERTAINLY DONT CLUTCH AT PEARLS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PART OF A LARGE BLOC.
---
Respectfully, who are you to say who should and shouldn't do fine? You're essentially making the argument you were fighting against earlier that one person wants to dictate to another how they should play. This is eve, all play styles should be welcome, but unfortunately, some alliances are struggling to maintain numbers, activity and a reason to play, sadly. Yet here you are, being quite hypocritical, previously saying that people shouldn't try to tell others how to play the game, and you yourself are doing just that.
---

Here we go again, nullblob player #12391 pretending to care about "MUH LITTLE GUY"
---
Because it was the easiest and quickest way to hit lots of bots at the same time.  They didnt need to ban them.  Was a good passive less resource intensive option. It's worked to a point until they find a way round (pods on gates)
---
The risk to reward ratio is now incredibly screwed up, you know that, anyone with any semblance of sense knows that.
---
I'm not just talking about the post you have done. Most of the player base hates botters but at the same time we have players that will call anyone that is paying attention a botter. 
---
I've been called a bot and if the player calling me a bot did as he said i've been reported all due to warping out and not dieing to him. 
---
having a name and shame and tool for those leaders that want to make sure there are no botters in there corp/alliance is a good thing
---
I laughed.
---
Ratting capitals don't die as quickly as their subcap equivilants.
---
That time means that more caps can be brought in.
---
Faxes, supercaps, bosons, HAW guns, fighter changes, DO I NEED MORE EXAMPLES?
---
Considering the... quality.. of the screenshot, I imagine it won't live a long life.
---
Not a nullblob player, sorry. Not part of any of the mega-alliances.
---
3.6 upvotes
---
Now I need to PLEX and inject ANOTHER alt to fly an expensive ship just to light a stupid cyno. If CCP are trying to make people leave the game they're going the right way about it.
---
You seem to be under the delusion that continuing to run anoms in null is the only way to make money. I moved multiple alts to highsec to run Abyssals semi AFK and it makes as much as my super did with much less effort and isk on field. Should have done this much sooner.
---
nah he wants to whore on 8 frigs at once
---
Show me where those changes have been making eve better?
---
The last few years have just been less conflict and more stagnation all while still losing players.
---
how about masses unsubbing?
---
What did I assert?
---
&gt;if you can't back it up a d then double down when people call you out.
---
No one is calling me out. Everyone knows there are thousands of bots. People are salty because they truly want want is good for them and don't give a fuck about how it affects the game.
---
&gt;And yes null should have risk but now the risk vs reward has killed all subcap ratting and today's change will kill a large portion of super/rorq because the risk has become unmanageable.
---
While I would have preferred a more modest change to injectors and anoms, cynos are a huge problem and make it hard to take fights. Players in null have knowingly abused the machnics for a long time and should not be surprised when they rightfully get fucked for a while until things get "better".
---
&gt;There is more and safer isk to be made in highsec and people like you just keep screeching nullsec is to safe despite constant deaths.
---
Doubtful, but you and your friends should have supported gradual changes over time to possibly avoid this. It seems most people in null wanted injectors because they lived in isk-printing-fantasyland and would benefit from them. Radical changes are now necessary to "balance" the bullshit. Enjoy.
---
Keep pretending that these are the only changes and that nothing else will every happen to balance this stuff
---
You missed his point. Huge fights draw subs
---
Oh, so you are referring to hunters having to put up with an actual fight and not straight dunks? Sounds like a legit complaint....

Given bombers, covert t3s, blops are all known for their ability to last in a straight up fight, you're right, it's their fault they didn't all feed themselves to you so you could boost ratting ticks with their fits.

---
Love all the judgmental comments. For a sandbox game it’s actually fun to read.
---
How is an active defense fleet going to stop a Covert cyno? How is sitting on a gate wondering if a fleet will come fun? You have no idea what it takes to defend with these changes and just shout at everyone to Lea e if they don't like it. Surprise if everyone leaves to another game or highsec, you won't have anyone to hunt and will start crying highsec killed the game with no self awareness.

Not sure how strict they are being about NDA but it feels like I am playing a simpler version of eve. I am personally really enjoying it. Its basically dumbed down to make easier to play on your phone.
---
Speeds you up?
---
Great, now all of ~~new eden~~ China knows you´re here!
---
&gt; That's all pure USD that flowed into the game via PLEX. Definition of a faucet^
---
...that's not a faucet at all...
---
That resulted in zero isk being added to the game...
---
Are we taking screenshots with phone cameras still? 
---
Nice snag chori keep it up
---
Its available just crazy restricted for some reason. I basically never see anyone in local.
---
So... you are saying that it's the ships fault for being designed to run away the moment a fight happens and not tank and not the players using them, knowing that's how they are designed, being upset they can't take a fight when it comes? Outstanding.
---
Nice may-may, put a smile on my face this morning.
---
So thats how NC did it back in the day...  
---
Tactical combat glasses!
---
Pretty big assumptions you make there. There are nuances between them. Maybe people just don't like when CCP fix the game with a sledgehammer and blindfolds on.
---
You may have missed a few years
---
RIP most of my alts, and cyno ships scattered around Eve.
---
Towards death maybe.
---
A small bit of irony in you asking.
---
I DONT EVEN HAVE A TITAN. IM DELVE LOWER CLASS AND JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN IN DREADS/CARRIERS
---
Since you don't seem to pay attention even Olmecca admits the null portion of csm have been asking for changes for years. Every stupid thing that made nullsec safer has been opposed by us but now because ccp didn't listen it's our fault.
---
Also just telling nullsec to suffer isn't going to help the game, some amount of to se that quit will never return once ccp restores balance, and how many players can eve really afford to lose.
---
an alt that did nothing but light a cyno was worthless anyway. if the toon was useful but you used it for cynos...welll nows time to use it for what it can do. or just bloody get into a different ship lol

The MER shows goons have been least affected, facts not feels.
---
how so
---
A meatshield for what, exactly? PH has already soft reset them once in the past 2 months and absolutely nothing changed except for the fact that we got to hunt them for a little over a day (which was fun btw).
---
As long as hunters aren't spamming the game's macroeconomy with ISK and minerals their risk is irrelevant to this entire discussion. Krabber risk was increased because of the spam.
---
For someone purposely misunderstanding the sarcasm of the statement you are doing pretty well to be full of bullshit.
---
&gt; Are they inactive or something?  NC. Kb in particular is just red of random stuff. 
---
Umm no I see no random stuff on our killboard. Let me give you some examples. 
---
[https://zkillboard.com/related/30001345/201909090100/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001345/201909090100/) 
---
Our favorite activity, killing bots. It's not random for sure. The reason why we exist as [one of the largest alliances in the game](https://evewho.com/). Is because we have players who enjoy WH, LS, NS, and even HS ganking. So if you think we're getting random kills it's just because we all have different tastes. If you look at GSF. Goons have kills from all over the place in eve.
---
It isn't random it's just people having fun.
---
Is all of the capslock shouting in this thread like the final part of the "I AM SO ANGRY I WON'T LISTEN LALALALA" bit?

---
They just put out a new report.
---
** fucking finally the granola piece is out. had to use a tweezer.
---
anyways, ur misunderstanding. the opportunity to go out into nullsec is available for everyone, but not everyone can or should thrive. There's always a bigger fish, and much like in our situation in Tribute, if Goons or TEST or PanFam really wanted to push us out they could. We'd fight back as much as we reasonably can, but they still could...and that's a risk we are willing to take. If someone isn't, why should they expect the same rewards?
---
Every major change by ccp to nullsec has followed the same pattern.
---
CCP makes a change
---
Nullblocs explain why this is much worse for people not in blocs
---
People claim blocs are only looking at self interest and don't know anything about small groups
---
Nullblocs are proven right
---
Surprise pikachu face
---
Goto 10
---
A lot of those they i see letting or talking about leaving are those in Null. This game has so many options and the problem i see with the large null blocs is the false impression they give that everything is safe in their space and you don't need to worry. People need to be willing to change things up. I left Null for Wormhole able actually ended up in lowsec at this time. There's a ton of stuff going on in LowSec from cap production to PvP. 
---
Instead of quitting, switch things up. You can always go back to null if you want but try something different.
---
Hey All, if anyone has routes into a c13 pm me, looking for route into c13s and ill tip ya some isk :)
---
my in game name is Mas0ny1 P
---
Just name the email: Access to C13 Hole
---
Thanks All :)
---
It absolutely did. Skill injectors and PLEX (spent more on the former) are the only two real items that have actual value that matters in the economy of eve. When they are created from nothing, that's a faucet. It contributed to 238 billion in assets, liquid isk, and commodities
---
So you are saying only people who like the changes have a valid opinion?
---
wished my work would be in summer slow but you do the most financial statements and balance sheets in this time period for all the latecomers in the tax advisor sector -,-.
---
Your flair, amigo.
---
no it was a granola bar lmao. i elaborated slightly in another post.
---
So, the only concern right now is controlling isk flow and if that comes via reducing the overall player count in game it's a good thing? That really doesn't sound like a positive.
---
yeah my 400 man alliance surely is a nullbloc, coolio
---
Was this in the September patch notes? Can’t seem to find this change.
---
I need a paper about why you think you are more entitled to my supers and other capitals + various subcap doctrin ships first. Minimum 5000 words with good explanations. Then i think about it.
---
So you are saying only people who don't like the changes have a valid opinion?
---
Almost feels like we lost a good friend, I salute you Cyno buddy you will be used again I mean just with a more expensive ship.

---
I asked first
---
I would love to see nullification gone for a lot of things
---
who?
---
Haha slightly more risk, and other lies people tell themselves. Do you think no one died in nullsec before these changes? Would it shock you to know less ships are dying in nullsec after these changes. Highsec will always be safer but you will never admit that.
---
Of course you know that goons are adapting and getting even bigger upper hand over others?      
---
While they are making less ... at the same time they are now making more than other groups in nullsec than before when you look at the %.           
---
On top of that :           
---
* Many smaller groups died              
---
* Some quit ... but also many members already joined big blocks or are in the process of doing so.               
---
I don't see recent changes as CCP killing goons, but as CCP killing anyone without big umbrella.
---
Generally game developers remove tedium over time rather than add it.
---
Why not re add learning skills if you want more tedium, after all they would serve the purpose of making new rorq pilots harder to get so worth it right?
---
Sorry, then you acted or flairbaited it. Nevermind ...
---
they die faster than eve
---
Heyyyy, thanks for the bitter salt. We'll be in your space flying around like ... Ahemmm.. "edgelords" validating ourselves as you work out at the gym in your dank t-shirt. 
---
Have fun! We know we will.
---
I mean Ya ccp letting you script is pretty dumb.
---
MER shows that goons made less ... but when compared to other groups they made even more in terms of %
---
I think personally think Instead CCP could have created a brand new cyno only ship with a less expensive hull and skill intensive option.
---
Would have solved it..with very little drama.  But as usual CCP have a knee jerk reaction stick a huge plaster over the problem and come up.with some thing even more ridiculous.
---
Whose going to fly a Indy through nullsec without dying.
---
Who wants to spend 200m on a ship just to cyno?
---
It's the opposite for most people
---
Fuck Mittani. The only thing he worried about is his RMT flow. 
---
Eve's been dead for a minute.

---
Ok so seriously, if you have nothing else to say than bitching on people, just refrain from posting. WTF seriously, what a ducking negative community on Reddit that’s amazing! So much judgemental and negative it’s incredible
---
Again I disagree with your 3rd point drastically. Look at the insurance payouts faucet in every MER over the past year. That's a very decent indicator of PVP player engagement. It's down 43% from this time last year, declining monthly. Yes it's fantastic that NPC bounties are following an even more drastic similar trend...but what I care about is pvp based player engagement, and my mindset is that until CCP cares about that aspect the most, my subs can run out
---
* Dude undocks to rat. Warps to anom.  
---
* 20 bombs decloak and kill him 5 minutes later. Loses a carrier,  
---
HA HA GET GUD AND ADAPT.  
---
* Dude comes back 2 hours later. Warps to anom in a new ship. Downgrades to a Dominix to reduce cost and exposure to loss.  
---
* 20 minutes later in a second anom 20 bombers decloak and kill him.  
---
HA HA HA DUMB KRAB, YOU NEED TO ADAPT.  
---
* Dude tries again the next day. Uses a Myrmidon, going ultra cheap only though it's going to max out at maybe 30-35m an hour.  
---
* 40 minutes later he is feeling good until 3 Tengus decloak and blap him.  
---
HA HA, HOW U NO SEE US ON DSCAN?  
---
* Dude decides to adapt one more time. Logs out of EVE and plays another game.
---
Be strong. The carebear circle jerk is thick in here.
---
The macroeconomy was not positive either. The hope is to reduce farm activity but people find something else to do instead. I'm not saying blackout hit that target or missed it.
---
Have you heard last TIS?         
---
Let say that that "he wish that ccp move the game in the right direction other than current"
---
Well ask me how I think about the hundreds of "But muh afk-PvE now spoiled ... CCP kills game" posts. Guess then we have something in common ...
---
Yes
---
TIS became garbage long before any of this and its just the same guys jerking each other off now with nothing substantive.
---
Opposite. I'm in a HS/wh Corp with plans to take a little null in the future. But the apps from former null people who are to scared to play now without free freighters and local and umbrellas are, well are twenty pages long. I imagine every HS Corp is seeing the same thing.     
---
But your exactly right. What were they doing in null in the first place. While I'm happy with the changes CCP fucked up letting null be so safe. Props to Hillmar for being like fuck it lets piss everyone off and kill the Krabs and bots.      
---
Prepared for -100 downvotes for not insulting CCP or Hillmars life for changes. Null carebear days be over kids. Be seeing you soon. Keep the krab hunt stories coming!
---
The "Pause for dramatic effect" was palpable.
---
You have him on TIS saying this by himself.
---
Correct everyone was affected but goons were by far the least affected.
---
oh ok, got a quick clip or a link to the episode in question?
---
You missed the point. You asked for his alliance name while not sporting an alliance flair. That is the irony.
---
&gt; 1) Every ship can fit them. A dread brawl means dozens of potential cynos on grid. Removing them from all but a few ships creates more opportunity for tactics to win the day instead of simple N+1.
---
It doesn't add any tactics, it just means whoever gets dreads/titans on grid first wins. Any recon that attempts to lite will be instantly blapped by LR dreads/HAW dreads because they are fragile and static. Then the Dreads that were jumping in get split in two and the ones that jumped in die. If you try to lite off grid and warp in a dictor burns a drag bubble in that direction, so your caps land in their optimal/bounce on landing and again you welp.
---
&gt; Risk aversion
---
Multiple force recons become mandatory on fleets. Any fleet of sufficient size will have enough recons that they can't all be alpha'd before more come in. In the context of a valuable enough fleet 300m in a recon is nothing. If the enemy fleet is cheap the incoming fax can keep the recon alive indefinitely.
---
Phorde standing fleet
---
I still have nostalgia for EVE. But maybe it's because I've had many long breaks from it.
---
Well they did long before blackout, exactly because of the meta you defend ...
---
Ah right
---
....what?
---
No, where in the process of buying Plex with cash is ISK created?
---
But null bears suffered over all. That was the point. Way too much wealth was being created
---
Depends on what happens. Even the changes aren't going to uproot goons or test. But, the rest of null is gonna get a lot more interesting. And the big blocs are gonna keep talking huge losses to roaming gangs catching their afk krabbers :)
---
well man its 1 search away,  [https://zkillboard.com/character/94758126/](https://zkillboard.com/character/94758126/)

No I am saying people who spent 3 days discussing the game with CCP have better insight than you or I, and to discredit their opinion because you disagree is absurd.

Even Olmecca who was certain Nullblocs were only working in self interest admitted they were trying to better the game for everyone.
---
Just edited and linked it.

Listen the whole thing.

Like you hear all CSM in there "worried" about what is happening with EVE.

---
LOL
---
Eve online will end up in the game design books. A case study of how it survived questionable changes for years, only to die while implementing exactly what r/eve was preaching in months.
---
I played fairly consistently until cataclysm. I went back after a break for the free weekend not long ago. Too much has changed since I last played for me to want to pick It up again it's a whole different game and I have no enthusiasm to start over.
---
rr supers were so much more fun compared to what we have now
---
Because everyone just flying caps everywhere was so great?
---
&gt;Since you don't seem to pay attention even Olmecca admits the null portion of csm have been asking for changes for years. 
---
I remember a certain Goon CEO arguing for injectors and how they would be a good thing because the bazaar was the same (it wasn't). Those arguments were then regurgitated by retards giving CCP the idea that maybe the community is split on this issue.
---
&gt;Every stupid thing that made nullsec safer has been opposed by us but now because ccp didn't listen it's our fault.
---
I don't get that impression at all. You wanted what was good for you, and for a long time, CCP granted it.
---
&gt;Also just telling nullsec to suffer isn't going to help the game,
---
Nullsec's "abuse everything"-ideology is arguably what got us to this point. It's generally not your small gang/solo players who drop caps on cruisers/frigs to such an extent that fights can't be taken.
---
&gt;some amount of to se that quit will never return once ccp restores balance, and how many players can eve really afford to lose.
---
If some of the cap dropping, skill farming, isk printing trash is taken out, I wont have a problem with it. If the game dies as a result, it would suck, but radical changes have to be made.
---
It's mostly large null block carebears complaining about how this effects the little guy though. It's stupid
---
&gt; No I am saying people who spent 3 days discussing the game with CCP have better insight than you or I, and to discredit their opinion because you disagree is absurd.
---
Im not discrediting Innominate's opinion. I'm just saying, "OMG a guy thinks the game is dying". It's literally been the story of EVE since 2003, yet here we are in 2019.
---
I'm guessing resources are next.  Those anoms in null are gonna get pretty sparse as will the mining  anoms.  CCP will limit the amount of respawns until there will be nothing left to rat or mine.  Not sure if it will extend to moons or not.
---
Umm, I don’t think you understand reddit. It actually is our god given right to talk shit here. Perhaps your need to move over to /EveIsAwesomeILoveHilmar
---
I'm specifically referring to a balance between risk on both sides. It's not balanced.  That is the crux of it. Your earlier statement about convenience vs. a killmail is a high light to that problem. If it's only fun for you, how long until the other guy says "welp, not fun- I'm done" and just walks? There is so much rhetoric on reddit and so much "yea, fuck off with you" that I am truly curious what will happen if critical mass numbers online falls to a point that all of a sudden people are like "well, the game would have lived if people hadn't quit like we told them to". That's a dangerous thought process of saying "my fun is more important than theirs" in an mmo that needs people in it.
---
Nice! I like the Kiki album especially
---
[please.](https://getsharex.com/)
---
This is never ending null salt!! Hahahaha
---
I had gone with a more obvious choice. Muninn = BL. So... BL light?
---
Even if it was mostly trashy, I think it would be better to have one more alive null entity, than have one more dying one.
---
"Worthless" except for doing exactly what I needed them to do...
---
Whatever it is expect it to take minimal dev time to accomplish like the rest of the 'chaos'
---
Any particular terribleness?
---
Its a start, def needs more stuff from Pc added, but overall its got a good direction, been playing the closed alpha for a bit.
---
This we will never know.
---
worthless, except they cost nothing to create, only a sub to continue. 
---
if theyre not worthless they have skills trained and can already fly recons etc etc.
---
+1
---
Hillmar~~'s bonus.~~
---
FTFY
---
I've been playing as if the cyno changes were already in effect. Ive been using falcons and recons in general for cynos for years because of the bonus to duration and fuel costs and theyve been great to bait kills. The only difference to me with changes is now everyone else has to conform to the way Ive been doing it
---
 
---
No to have to serious post here but for real there's nothing CCP can do If we the players keep forming Mega coalitions, the 2 worst offenders been Goons and Test who have coalition sized alliances who are also in coalitions themselves as well as being in a sort of coalition with each other. 
---
I think the cold war is over and if people are still trying to have titan fights vs ether goons or test at this point need to really look at what there messing at and move on and find something else to do..
---
We only have ourselves to blame… and yes I know its human nature to blob up but I believe it is just getting silly now….
---
Yeah and then those people get suicide ganked in highsec, never figure out dscan, get frustrated at the shit default overview, and if they stay long enough to end up in one of those single digit % tidi fights they find out it's actually kind of shit.
---
I also noticed that the payout dropped.          
---
Less ships is dying (or less valuable t1 ships is dying - aka guy padding KB with thousands of frigates) and this cannot be attributed to lowered dread insurance that was while back.
---
Add to the VNI changes - it also got an armor repair amount bonus
---
Station games? Oh good Lord that's something I truly don't miss at all. Syndicate was good times back in the day though thats for sure.
---
I honestly can't blame him. All you fucks are crazy as shit.
---
At they staying and enjoying the current game?
---
Same for EU really. For me EU TZ starts at maybe 1500 eve when the first people get home from work until 2200 eve, maybe 2300.
---
Between AU and EU is something of a russian timezone i noticed when I've flown alongside XIX. They start a few hours earlier than EU.
---
same, that skin is just plain hot
---
But at that point you’re addicted. Eve is like heroin, when you first start using it’s pretty nice but after awhile you find out you’re addicted and miserable
---
Yea if they just dropped the excavators I could see in its current state the rorq being fine ( I run 2 rorqs and 3 covetors) but most people pair removing excavators with removing PANIC and if that happened it would not at all be worth fielding
---
people who never log in going on about how eve is dead lol
---
What you really said:  
---
&gt; Lots of people agreeing in this post with a point I do not agree. I must insult them.
---
Oh i see that your SRP fund will get some ISK finally.        
---
It was running drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy for quite a while now.
---
grr ccp hat ccp.
---
That's all it is basically. The game is quite good
---
Agreed, at least for ceptors. They can insta-align and reapproach quite fast so they're mostly safe except for rare instalockers with very low ping or smartbombs. On t3 cruisers its fairly balanced out by the high align time and investment
---
not /r/eve a loud group on r/eve with a setup discord for vote brigading
---
Whats better continuation than drive even more people out, thatll fix it!
---
When you make things harder for line members you don't cause more conflict, you cause people to huddle together for safety because groups that were previously self sufficient aren't anymore under increased pressure. I expect to see GOTG fold into Init and Provi to fold into Legacy and most of their members to move under the bigger umbrellas.
---
That isn’t the AT system
---
Well if you are a guy that moves around EVE and uses a suitcase capital to move ships around then yes.           
---
This just killed this type of gameplay.
---
He wasn't wrong though.
---
Well if you didn't have recon alts till now you did it wrong.
---
Try to mine a moon in a 0.5 Hisec System atm lol. Bet you will see blinky reds around you on the first day. There sure is no deliberated campaign from large Nullblocs together paying PIRAT to remove all Hisec moonmining to make Hisec life miserable and convince the new hisec pubbies to instantly join their nullsec ponzi scheme /sarcasm....
---
CCP spent 3 years on the NPE scrapped it and started again, they don't really understand balancing things it seems, which leads to changes like this. As I've said before I'm just gonna deal with the changes. I give it a year before the new cyno comes out for players to use.
---
"I have no clue what i m talking about but my isk per hour is less afkable"
---
He's tethered tho... which isn't going away, so that's probably not the "final time" ... just saying.
---
Perhaps if you remove covert cynos from them.  However, the combination of the ability to refit on the fly from nullified to combat with a mobile depot still makes them brutally powerful.
---
When the rain starts to fall harder, you look for a bigger umbrella.
---
I mean... reduce the availability of mining anomalies that already aren't being mined all across space. Woopty doo.
---
First played at 15, and I don't recall running into anyone my age or younger at the time. It's long since then, and I still find myself younger than the average now.
---
Plex is not a faucet, you did not create any in-game wealth, you just bought someone else's in-game wealth with USD.
---
Oof
---
Just because Pando saved GOTG titans one time...
---
I've been poking at it, when I've had time, and access to battery charging. Feels a bit Eve lite. And I can just see where they'll plug in monetisation. But yeah, it doesn't play badly.
---
The corp I'm in are small gang vets who returned to the game because of blackout. I've had a lot more good fights since the blackout without people relying on a lazy local intel system.
---
"... wind up slowly killing the game, and doing so much faster than the game would die if they did nothing at all"
---
goon cant even finish sentence without contradicting himself lul
---
Just be careful, make sure to on occasion say "Only humans around here..." to make him think you can't see them, even with those yellow glasses!
---
They might remove it from medium structures going forward but I don't see CCP removing asset safety entirely.
---
You know that you pay for product that is EVE and most important part of the product is people that you can interact with - aka other players.          
---
If you just want to be having fun by yourself do some solo game.          
---
EVE need people logged in, in space and not in instanced PVE like trig space.
---
\^ I use Arch, btw.
---
if they remove asset safety in favor of loot drops in ns, you will see greater consolidation than ever before (at least for the standard krab alliances) while pvpers would probably keep most of their assets in ls/npc null. they'll still have citadels in sov null but just for docking/cloning
---
But this is the first time *Innominate* thinks it’s dying. You know, one of the most connected people in Eve and a multi-year member of the CSM.
---
Well you guys also took in Kenshin, so...
---
The Meta Show has developed quite effectively into a mainstream news outlet for New Eden and the Imperium. Their ability to have the same quality of content as major real life news organizations is no small feat. And by that I mean parading around pandering fuckbags that piss and moan at any perceived slight or dig at their ego, real or not.
---
You so romantic lol. Actually, 01,02 are in null, low sec now. so you would never see they all assembled

My subscription, probably. 
---
Man who the fuck am I kidding, I can't win at this game. I've tried for years.
---
The cyno changes directly targeted big umbrellas. They don't go far enough to break them but they were obviously not aimed at "the little guy" because "the little guy" doesn't have a capital umbrella or even the supers on hand to compete with any null bloc. 
---
Besides that "the little guys" can give their own feedback, they don't need your concern trolling.
---
Just limit alliance member cap to 500 members, that way these big alliances who ruined the whole game getting fucked and there will be balance.
---
Legs are just decorations, the higher ups won't understand
---
It's extremely "Eve Lite" I agree. It needs some tweaking but as a doubter and hater, I was blown away with the quality of it even in Alpha state.
---
So you seen disregarding him by spamming, just that someone has held that opinion before so his educated take it doesn't count.
---
&gt; If it's only fun for you, how long until the other guy says "welp, not fun- I'm done" and just walks?
---
People cease from activity when it becomes unprofitable. This happened for some forms of activity. For example, ratting anoms in a Rattlesnake (or subcaps in general) in very crowded (e.g. Delve) or very accessible (e.g. Provi) became completely non-viable. This is why I think the current situation should be improved for subcap linemembers for example. I offered specific ways to do that to CCP.
---
Meanwhile, I don't think capital farming will be in a state of complete halt. We will still see a number of capitals undocking. That number will be less than what it used to be, but more than the amount the game can actually macroeconomically support. Now that a great portion of null playerbase has supers, we really can't afford all of them to undock them and farm.
---
Even your hero Olmeca is worried mate. No one cam back from summit feeling good like they usually do.
---
Usercount + Scarcity + Freedom = Conflict, I solved it all guys.
---
Twitter
---
That isn't a contradiction. Careful, your grr goons is showing.
---
Of course second galaxy launching today kinda beat them to the mobile space for people who want something eve style.
---
So I’m happy you are enjoying the game. You pay for your sub so I’m glad you are getting your moneys worth.
---
That being said, blackout is a list of changes designed for counter PvE play style. The content drivers in the ecosystem you claim to play in are nonexistent and aren’t being addressed. Citadels are awful and sov is horrible to fight over and has been for the last few years and it’s not being addressed. A bulk of the null player base, myself included, would rather be fighting over tangible objectives and actual content drivers. Not whaling
---
I mean, you aren't wrong... also, I hate office 365.
---
I'm strapped in and will ride this tear-train all the way to the grave. You guys make it too juicy.
---
They're not wrong
---
This is a doctored image. Providence doesn't own supers.
---
I once applauded EVE for having surprising efficient mechanics and UI at /r/FFXIV.
---
Now I regret it.
---
Lol, no. Big groups can afford to carry around pocket cynos, small groups are just fucked.
---
If the "much fast" rate of killing the game is still slowly, then we're okay bby
---
Except again and again they have been right.
---
No offense but, I always thought that Omega was a woman after saw the Salty-bombers eviction video. That Child's voice is not normal in an adult.
---
Because we would prefer the game to not die.
---
Exit hole signatures don't appear immediately when someone rolls into you/have to be scanned in order to find that they exist at all. \o/
---
All that violence over a videogame
---
That statement is not wrong, my personal opinion is that they panicked about PRE-Blackout Login stats and the developement of logins since Citadel patch march 2016, leading to the demise of the responsible Lead Dev Seagull and some panicked steps to get back the many 10k Accounts of PvP-centered players they lost between 2015 and 2018. Blackout is one of this steps. Now its a rat race between people unsubbing PvE-Multiboxes and people resubbing (ususally less) old accounts. But as many of the old guard that quit between 2015 and 2018 realized that they are 30/40/50+ now, have jobs/kids/families only a portion of them comes back.
---
My personal opinion on blackout is, that I have a lot of fun with it, and Nullsec feels spooky and dangerous again, as it should be. But I also see that the current implementation is too hard. My personal solution would be "Observatories" that for a certain amount of fuel and depending on some player-influenced metrics restore local in Sov-Areas to a certain degree. As closer to the Observatory the shorter is the delay. in Capital systems where the structure is anchored, you are in local as soon as you break gatecloak.
---
I'm fucking sorry, what? That's a joke, right?
---
talks about man enough to use titans, uses a bomber or something else cloaky. mmhmm okay.
---
They’re across the map from each other in nullsec.  Which means leaving null to get it, even if you go conquer the other side of the map to get it.
---
You have obviously never super ratted before. Multiboxing supers is a pain in the ass. The amount of apm needed to make that work is only reachable for very very few people.
---
i think its a fair counter to bubble spam you see very often in null pockets. if they also had &lt;2s align i'd agree they'd be broken but you can catch them due to the inertia penalty
---
No, stop trying to talk metrics. I am talking about fun. I a situation where one side has an overwhelming and clearly decisive edge, it becomes an unfun thing. It's not about swapping to a different activity or trying something else out. Fun is a metric they aren't looking because it's not really measurable in an objective manner. But despite all of the broad casts, twitter, posts of people coming back- where is our massive uptick of players because this is all so fun and exciting for everyone?
---
Great post and insight.  Sadly, cue all the blob PvP'ers that will try to roast you for being "salty" - happens every time someone makes an intelligent comment in favour of someone other than blob PvP'ers.  
---
\*shouts and gesticulates wildly at blob PvP'ers\*
---
"There's more than one valid playstyle, ya freakin' mooks!"
---
&gt; also, I hate office 365.
---
so say we all
---
Honestly probably blackout, with a switch to delayed local. They've hit null with a really hard one-two this summer, they might pull back a bit and give krabs some breathing room to bring people back in &amp; let us try hunting them without the cyno umbrella. 
---
*Hopefully* the logistics nerf (harder JFing, harder setup for caps); this was probably not the intent of the cyno change &amp; it impacts small groups more than big blocs, so CCP might change it up.
---
Ick, thanks for the replies.
---
Yea, I'm not really against nullified on them. But I do think they should lose covert cyno.
---
ok i listened to the CSM part. Vily and ExzookiZ
---
Vily: "My opinion was definitely not in a positive zone. Obviously when I left the summit I was in a more positive zone but...it's still not a full positive...we raised the bar a bit so it went from my feeling is it's terrible and shitty...and now it's somewhere in the middle you can say".
---
Before this quote, he was talking about looking at TEST internal metrics and data gathering and from that having a negative outlook on the blackout and going into the summit with that negative outlook. The takeaway is that no matter what data the players have or think they have, it's nothing compared to what CCP has and what they base their decisions on.
---
ExzookiZ: "Soo I think it's a mixed bag. There are some parts that I left with a very positive feeling about, there were parts that I left with neutral feelings like I'm very happy with how the wormhole session went, which for me was my #1 goal, which my goal was educating people on what wormhole space is. I didn't go in with my list of "I need to get CCP to agree to fix this as much as...CCP understands this...And then there were other sessions where sometimes I felt like we were voicing concerns at a wall. We got some pretty stoic faces..or at least a couple that I left where I thought we weren't completely certain we got anything done right there."
---
So mixed bag when it comes to CCP's vision of the game from mostly everyone...Which kinda sounds right. You aren't going to make a product that pleases literally everyone.
---
Pls stop being alarmist for a second and just go back to posting about lowsec gates to stain.
---
To be fair, you're kind of fishing for trouble here. 
---
You had the nerve to say in the face of all angry NS player that you're happy because you can easily kill krabs with your cloaky ship since the Blackout was implemented.
---
What did you expect, praise ?
---
Sure they did.           
---
Like big umbrellas don't have cyno beacons and access to swarm of alts with recons and SRP to cover the loses.

Another salty one that cannot see anything eve than his own asshole.

Damn, they are legion these days.
---
Aren't they the same person?
---
Once you get a perspective, you will notice quickly that most nullblob supercap pilots have no idea how basic mechanics work. The game is streamlined for them as a pve activity with elements of pvp such as anchor push f1 and don't think for yourself. They are hi sec carebears recruited and transplanted into nullsec with ccp active support.
---
Anom farming isn't fun for most people doing it. People do it because they want money. People will do it as long as it remains profitable.
---
If people did PvE because of fun, they'd all be running Abyss sites by now.
---
Seeding these T1 indus is so fucking AIDS.
---
They came in a harpy and pushed Blopsec &amp; Volta off the carrier, but not after the carrier was in hull
---
Oh look another salt thread that contributes nothing other than to inform us that OP is salty.
---
The characters I used for scouting and cynos were also rorq pilots, pre-blackout I just used intel channels and local to see anything coming. I didn't need anymore accounts, now it's more or less compulsory I'm sure many players are not very happy about it.
---
Yeaaah, ratting in a carrier is pretty much just asking for it now.
---
Wtf mods deleted this
---
You're being sarcastic, right? Just in case you aren't, coalitions are a thing.
---
But I got an invite email with a code and download link. You'd think I'd be allowed in?
---
You do realize the first thing the Mittany says is... Yikes... right.
---
Next is asset safety.  CCP has read enough reddit posts about an Eve reset to believe this is what we want.  They will make null harder and harder, until only the hardest of the hard and the delusional remain there.  The rest will either return to carebear status in HS or make LS great again.  Then null will be cleansed of the citadel detritus by the sleepers and rewards buffed to encourage a migration back.  Only the hardy and those who know how to dscan will survive.   I cannot wait.  Plus they will need to delete a few regions to allow for some player density.
---
Because he doesn't like the changes.

I listened to their answers on how they felt overall leaving the CSM summit. That's the relevant part to discuss here.

Re: The Wormhole changes, this sounds brilliant. Guaranteed to increase possible conflict levels, and since we often roll statics looking for fights, the second change would help with that too. I like it.
---
give us  button  "board new industrial"
---
For now the only thing it is at all is a warping simulator dude.
---
Well you have more capitals than you had before skill injectors and rorqual fest, so people will use them to respond.
---
I've said that many times, but the attacker is not entitled to choose the way the defending party respond to them. You can TRY to get the response you want, that's all.
---
And yes, 9 out of 10 times it won't be it. But why should it be any different ?
---
Tbh i don't care about lost alt accounts more about people.       
---
For me rorquals were huge mistake (due to ease of multi boxing them)
---
You know most people in this game do both right? I'm a pvper but also build caps/t2 shit. This seems like the norm in every group and the people who soley do only pve or pvp are rare.
---
Upvoted for putting in more than 8 seconds of work.

**Fly in New Eden** and don't fly in instanced abyssal sites.

They also have it limited by phone model. That might be the issue?

shut up. everyone know 2006-2009 was best eve.

A second cyno on station for another JF is more believable the genius who accepted fleet invite and didnt know their Vanquisher was fleet warped off of tether. Then lose a second Vanquisher 1-2 weeks after.

wwb.txt
---
Thank you
---
Nice, care to dig out the recording that is not age old that says the opposite?
---
Didnt they specifically declare that an exploit and patch? (Rapid click) vm’s are much harder to detect though
---
I'd say T3's as well. You can semi-AFK them for around 100m/hour per character. I only needed 6 clicks per room, then I could tab out to the next account.
---
If CCP were to disable abyssals somewhere for that reason, they should start from wormholes. Wh abyssal runners just collapse entry and run the sites in nearly perfect freedom from interaction.
---
27m stuff about wh starting
---
This is CCP you're talking about. What did we have to balance blackout ? The most retarded cyno changes ever.
---
Never trust CCP for balance, ever.
---
Yeah yeah. In one post you say all the small guys are moving to big groups to be under umbrellas and in the next you say all the small guys are going to lose their umbrellas now, which they apparently do have after all.
---
You and a few other people here do so much whining that you can't even keep your concern trolling straight. But good news is in 120 days CCP probably balanced supers too, something else that will affect big groups far more than little ones. See you then.
---
Give them the tackle bonus from the other interceptor and make them in the top tier of frigates for MWD and AB speed and maybe a slight sig reduction. The nullified ceptors should lose all combat related bonuses and be called 'scout' or 'travel' class interceptors.
---
@vorlash down there is somewhat right somewhat wrong. The missions will be the exact same in any system or securit from a same level agent, but the reward both ISK and LP will be significantly increasing with security rating dropping. the difference between running lvl 4 security missions in 1.0 or 0.5 is honestly insane
---
CCP have taken away the ability of 1/2 account players to effectively defend themselves in PvE in their alliance's own space. Expect to see more people disappearing down abyssal rabbit holes to make isk, and not interacting with other players. Inb4 yet more instanced nonsense.
---
The whole narrative is "CCP is killing the game and no one is playing! Look at pcu! Eve is dead!" Not "slowly" killing the game.
---
But what if they want to do abyssal sites? T1-2 should be avail in high sec, new players need some way to gaining money. T3 should be low sec and 4-5 null.
---
I don't believe anything some dudes on the internet (elected or not) write/say/feel about some discussions they had with CCP, while the exact contents of their discussions have to be kept secret.
---
I want to create my own opinion based on objective facts and sources. I want to see a full protocol of all topics and arguments to them.
---
I wouldn't say "most" people, if you look at the login counter.
---
CCP is just trying to make us all live a healthier lifestyle away from EVE - just like you have been with the gym. They're the real MVP.
---
Look man, you are trying to tell me and others what they should do and why they did things. Do you really want me to tell you that "boosh farming wasn't fun" he only did it because it was the only thing he could do in EVE because there were no other activities at all!    
---
Stop trying to put everyone into the same box.  Some people like PVE ratting. Some people like incursions. Some people like exploration.  Some people like abyssal farming.  Some people like running DED sites. Some people like small gang, medium, large, huge fleets.  Some people like blops.  Some people like bomber fleets.    
---
This is what you need to keep in mind. Stop saying people don't do something because it's not fun or enjoyable for their gaming session just because it's not fun for you specifically.  
---
Let me put it like this, in a crude manner- but I'm not trying to offend, just make a very black and white points.  
---
Let's say I have a friend that is gay.  I wouldn't say to him that he should choose to only have sex with woman moving forward, because I think it's more fun and that he should just accept that and never do what he prefers. He would be far less likely to remain my friend if I continued to make that statement and believe that I had the right to dictate to him.  
---
This is not apples to oranges in that scenario, but similar. The longer devs, designers and one segment of EVE decides to pontificate that they know what is truly fun in this game and everyone should get onboard or just GTFO will find out that in fact, people will GTFO.  So far, that resounding message has yet to find traction with thousands of new players as people have expected.  Two months of blackout and we don't have 20,000 new players magically saying "WOW THIS IS WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR!"
---
the only thing that i care about is their overall impression from leaving the CSM summit, not how they see their individual interest areas. It's the only relevant part to discuss here, in this conversation we are having now.
---
Guess what - CCP has to get proof beyond a reasonable doubt to ban people for botting. They don't ban people for being suspicious and potential bots.
---
Yeah I hate it when people tell me EVE is just about PVP (space combat). It's most definitely more than just that.  there is a whole "Idle game" component which you describe well. The thing is, Idle game and supers/titans should not go together because it distorts the the money supply for everyone else.
---
I hate to put it this way, but you (and I) are the problem these days. We are too big and EVE is too small. EVE needs to get bigger and to get there things have to be taken away.
---
The devs aren't killing the game, they are making your play style harder. You can still do everything you did before. It's just risky.
---
I bought some BPOs, have them running various sets and have my indy cynos ready to go already.
---
LFG T5 abyssal, need healer.
---
He's gotta make sure to have one gun on each target to killsteal more mails.
---
Yeah because anyone's going to believe "I've changed my soul" from someone with a history of policy violations.
---
I'm not commenting on the state of the game, or the validity of the statement. I'm simply pointing out how there isn't a contradiction in that statement.
---
yea well, cookie clickers and idle games are the perfect titles that have removed the tedium completely.   
---
Like it or not, tedium is central to eve - whether it's tedium for you, personally and now it's just a matter of timing. 
---
I mean, just have the Interbus ship your shit to whatever station you want, like some sort of reverse asset safety and be done with all the freghtering around, amirite? freighters can't be caught anyways if they have half a brain so why bother anymore - remove the damn tedium.  
---
Why not add some sort of queue-based pvp instance like some dork was telling about here, so we can eliminate the tedium of finding targets. How about we have a button that rolls all the statics set up in our citadels so we can remove the tedium of having to roll them with ships - ragerolling can't be helped anyways.   
---
how about PI? let's remove the tedium from there too - now you can train planet management to 5 and you just get to place a command center which gives you some money, huh? Tedium completely taken out. Great game.   
---
Get off your lazy ass.
---
hopefully faxes
---
So they're in nullsec.
---
Eve is a fucking inconvenience by itself :
---
\- The most boring PvE ratting ever
---
\- Mining couldn't be more boring, at least we can joke on comms and watch movies
---
\- Industrial runs are fucking tedious, even more now
---
\- Exploration is... well...
---
\- ???
---
What you you want to add more tediousness to this game ? I mean, if people were afking VNI's in anomalies, it's not only because it was effective, it's because it is so boring than it CAN and SHOULD be done afk.
---
Pretty fucking hilarious imo.  Still better than tlj.
---
does this group have a name? or what are his members?
---
&gt; Stop trying to put everyone into the same box. Some people like PVE ratting
---
I am not.
---
All I am saying is, statistically speaking, most people run anoms for wealth generation. And they will keep running them as long as wealth keeps being generated.
---
I am very confident with that assumption. I won't go into a lengthy discussion with you if you want to question that assumption.
---
Normally, I'd say something snarky like "Careful not to cut yourself on that edge there." But in this case, I hope you fall on it after tripping from a full sprint.
---
There has been, over the years, multiple posts saying we should remove local from nullsec/delay it.
---
These threads always failed to provide correct arguments or went directly into the toilets.
---
So no, Reddit is not the one advocating for it, CCP is picking random retarded ideas from wherever they can.
---
I stopped reading at the part where he says local chat in nullsec was about the "community".
---
Considering not everything can use a cyno now, not everything is a cyno. Not sure if this was a poor attempt at a shitpost
---
I'm giving it all she's got captain
---
So,m because I'm certain you have been unkind to someone once, I just going to do the same and assume you're simply an asshole.
---
Oh shit, not my ratting carrier that I couldn't be arsed to pay attention to because of the AIDS of npcing in eve... 
---
Also one minute Darkness is a mega-alliance, now its being called a dying alliance, like, come on fam, make your mind up. As far as im concerned, im not part of one of the giant-alliances like goons.
---
Bra, Evolution is in NC. lul
---
CCP is absolutely banning bots. It only takes a quick glance at the security blog to see thats the case. Theres a ton of bots out there, but hopefully its getting thinner. They work off of a backlog, and people that have been flagged as bots,a s well as reported tend tog et the most attention first, so maybe this guy hasnt been reported as much as others, maybe his code hasnt been caught yet.  
---
Another possibility is CCP already knows hes a bot, but suspects hes a part of a RMT ring. Similar to IRL police stings, I think CCP sometimes lets the bots hang out a bit more to try and better trace/track where the isk goes and take down large operations, rather than banning every myrm they can find.
---
surprisingly,no,this wasnt a shit post,havent played in a while and heard about the blackout/some cyno changes which im not familiar with
---
Honestly, most of nullsec ignored you before the blackout.
---
Not with all this cake I'm baking.
---
Made some ginger shortbread last weekend. Weekend before was raspberry and white chocolate chip tray bake.
---
Use triple AFs with remote reps amigo.
---
All they had to do was make it so cyno had some fit restrictions.
---
I thought killboards didn't matter hmm
---
I think you got it wrong, iam the one flying bombers and subcapital.
---
Iam more than happy about the new changes:) and even more when goons are crying about how this will affect their gameplay.
---
Yeah, so during this timeline, Eve will lose 50% of this playerbase, and Pearl Abyss will either shut it down or make it a microtransaction pinata to compensate.
---
I don't believe you people, do you have any sense on how all of this works ?
---
Those are examples of removing tedium, not adding tedium.
---
Iam not salty, iam super sweet of happiness bro.
---
If you want salty tears just search for goons, you will find oceans there.
---
:)
---
at least he pays for his own ships lmao
---
The game isn't dying, your playstyle is just getting nerfed.
---
Then don't make them instanced content?
---
Everybody whos game is not centered around the ability to farm ISK / ORE in such safety that they can do it afk enjoys the current situation, while at the same time realizing that the current situation went a bit too far. I would prefer delayed locals with some possibilities for sov holders to minimize (not fully terminate) delay... As any good hunter you have to take care of your forest so enough prey is living there ;-P

Oh no, the cyno changes are definitely going to affect our ability to deploy the umbrella... somehow, even though we have the resources to just add recons to ship replacement and not blink.
---
You say that, but at the same time when people post charts with data available about how the player numbers are declining rapidly, the blinders come on.
---
But ... but ... he needed the injectors for more rorquals
---
Can you go back to posting about pl dieing? You were at least tolerable back then.
---
If you have a capital ship, you should have had a cyno alt. so you just need to boost it to a recon. Did people really have capital ships without cyno alts? how did you move around?
---
Gila facerolls T2 and 3 so easily. Only way you can actually lose drones is if you send them out before anything is aggroed - Sleepers in particular seem to love them (doubly so for Blast/Ember/etc.grip Tessera).
---
Once everything is red on you, they just don't switch to drones.
---
Deviant Automata Suppressors take at least half a minute to chew through a drone's shield (not 100% on their damage mechanics but since switching from T2 to Caldari Navy they really don't pose any threat).
---
And to top it off and make botting easier, they could just stick to looting the bioadaptive cache which is always within a short distance from the conduit, and statistically holds the largest percentage of loot.
---
The parallel between this and the scrounging economy typical of any post-apocalyptic setting is quite striking.
---
&gt; are going to lose their umbrellas now, which they apparently do have after all.
---
Because this would be the first time a company that makes an MMO has killed their game because of mechanics changes. Clearly it is not possible for *any* company to shoot themselves in the foot. Amiright?  
---
\*cough\* SOE \*cough\*
---
Asset safety was always a thing in stations. Before citadels, your stuff was in a station you could not dock at. They needed to do something to get people to live in the new player owned stations. Nulsec used to be balanced around a limited number of permanent stations in a constellation  and a hard limit of 1 pos per moon.
---
Thanks, simple solution would have been to give this capital ship also "capital drone mechanics" aka fighter mechanis. More than 3 and you would get carpal tunnel syndrome ...
---
should have fitted a cyno
---
flair checks out completely
---
Not surprising it's a goon pet.
---
T3 is nowhere near 100m/h. Its more like 40m/h and prices are going down. Even t5 averages at like 180m/h and you can lose your 3b+ ship in an instant. I myself switched from abyssals to incursions after losing my 3b gila to lag.
---
Gate them. No capitals. Make two tiers. Solo level and 10+ player ones. Would be nice to have a group activity one. Like null incursions.
---
Coward
---
Eve has always had this. This has never not been a thing since day one. This is a feature of the game.
---
I did make suggestions I hope the minutes reveal some of them.
---
I bet you're racist in real life too

I thought capitals weren’t going to be used now!!!
---
Someone missed last 5 years of developement.

---
Natural selection at it's finest
---
No.  Absolutely not. 
---
I don't understand why some people feel that everyone should be forced to align with their preferred multiplayer, PvP-focus on the game (and that anyone who doesn't is just a wimp or is "salty").  Not everyone wants to play that way, and shouldn't have to if they don't want to.  Yes, I understand that the game is fundamentally about blowing up space pixels, but it takes more than F1-monkeys and salt farmers to make EVE the beautiful, expansive, inclusive game that it is (or can be, anyway).
---
How dare people adapt to changes
---
the fuck?
---
You guys are crying more about Test and Goons crying than Test and Goons are actually crying.
---
Well no one has given a suggestion on how to make it work aside from "delete it" which is fucking stupid. Content should never be removed.
---
he landed on grid. 2 seconds later. blap
---
Well, i couldn't tell that he meant that, because his reply was too short. Basically, it was just a bit of random sarcasm, so i assumed "oh, he disagrees with me and wants to throw ad hominems instead of discussing", and rolled with it.
---
Sure, i type a lot, if people are too lazy to read it's not my problem. But typing too little is also counterproductive sometimes, because people won't always understand exactly what you mean in a written medium, where we get no visual and audio context (facial expressions, voice tone, etc). There's a bit of ambiguity there and short posting is bad at dealing with it.
---
Personally, i prefer to spell everything out from the get go (or at least as much as possible) and not have to to engage in a constant back and forth clarifying individual points of the initial post. If i'm going to eventually have to explain stuff anyway, i might as well type the whole of it in advance and get it over with.

That is what I thought, ages ago.

He had one in a Falcon ready. He lit it without waiting for a response fleet to form up. Big yikes.
---
Gotta switch to markdown or use [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com), friend.

&gt;He had one in a Falcon ready. He lit it without waiting for a response fleet to form up. Big yikes.

No he didn't light a cyno. There was an Inhib up. He warped in his falcon after being tackled, then cloaked and then decloaked to get blapped.
---
I'm cutting down from 2 subs to only 1.

I just said how

Well they still can it’s just gona be in a different ship.

Remove asset saftey from everything, give the juicy drops after destroying a keepstar.  Null peeps seemed pretty happy when the Keepstar in Rage fell and the got to keep all that dropped.  Could be a good incentive for the larger alliance to go full tilt on destroying eachother
---
And Horde just announced the Same policy.
---
Oh look, Its more that anyone with a brain in null is being sane
---
Oh, I'm sorry. Guess i need 5 Years PvP experience before telling others that killing Barges is piss easy now
---
What herd? You cull most of the "herd" you have almost nothing left.
---
Fleet Cepters are squishy and limited in combat capability beyond holding targets. Nullification, agility, speed, limited tackle range bonuses and warp speed are what make them useful. Take any one away, and welcome to assault frigs online. Even the least useful of those attributes, the tackle range, is critical to their survivability. Nullification might be middle of that set of perks in terms of their combat usefulness, but that perk is what makes them useful as a scout.
---
Yes their used for travel too, and yes that is great. It allows for more content generation since you can stage fleets from multiple regions. This use of cepters is hard countered by smart bombers. More so with blackout because most people are too lazy to warp to pings in every single system along their route. 
---
T3Cs literally are everything but squishy, they can covert cloak, can blops cyno, can do acceptable DPS, they can have decent tackle/ewar bonuses, they have massive fitting and availible slots, and the loki is *the* meta solo ship as proof. Taking nullification away does little to change their usefulness, even in a hunting context (just cloak and drive out of the bubblefuck and wait a bit). It just makes drag bubbling and killing them off a gate possible.
---
Still a big yikes for me.
---
I was the one running it, so no "snag" :P
---
Go back to ratting in a super then, no worries right?
---
wew that´s a lot of remote sebo´d instalock alpha fits they had there.
---
i dunno man, judging by recent events someone touched mittani for sure
---
well it's a bit lame, you're basically the new carebear.
---
Yeah! Less people playing Eve is good for the game!!
---
I no longer can be arsed to sub anymore but burner missions used to be a thing.  Might be worth looking into with all the recent nerfs.

What are you going to do with these changes, being that you are the most elite Titan pilot that only uses his ship under an umbrella and is so afraid of a NPSI group he bubbles a station.

Cap battery?

Iirc there is a rig to increase max cap, as well as cap batteries that do the same, but why are you using an anathema for entosis
---
WoW Classic is slow/tedious, but people know what they're getting and it's that way for an end goal.  If compared to chaos era, it would be like you level to 60 and then Blizzard says "sorry, we don't like people playing Mages, so you're gonna hafta reroll and level again if you wanna do any damage.  lololol".
---
The Triglavian stuff and the wardec changes were legit olive branches to newer/potential players. Not everyone is ready to keep their head on a swivel looking for hunters while they PVE, so Trig filaments are a way to PVE in guaranteed isolation. The way war declarations used to work, people had to sign up to be clay pigeons for wardeccers if they wanted to experiment with running a corporation. This is the mechanic that drove me out of the game the first time I tried it; the player corps I signed up with always wound up getting curb stomped by groups that had no objective, they just wanted to kick us around for fun. Now you can have a corporation but you're still war immune if you don't put up a structure.  
---
People come to Eve looking for the simulated space opera universe where they are authors of their own fate. A steep learning curve is inevitable.
---
What so just have them in dead space pockets? I guess that should work, however if going this route I would allow T1-5 to be done in high sec.
---
Ours actually got relatively buffed because everyone else in null got hurt more, like, a lot more.
---
These changes are not a big deal at all, you just have to be component but I know it's hard for most people in TAPI/GOONS since they need their hand held. Those alliances are basically theme park alliances.
---
Capital level logi is honestly kind of a bad thing TBH. It just further cements the whole "bring capitals" meta.

FAXes should have been capital command ships that provided unique bonuses to capitals - like EWAR immunity/resistance, for example.

Or simply not have existed in the first place.

I just think that rorquals having a cyno lit while being invulnerable and an inhib up is just stupid. Now you can kill the cyno at least.

how could people ever think about risking their domis without a cyno fitted?

At the moment, is the key phrase....
---
I only had a capital for like a month before I quit playing, but I didn't have a cyno alt. I just used my cap to rat with, anyways. Also, as was written below, many alliances including mine had courtesy cynos set up.
---
Only if you're dumb enough to think "the other side of the map" is accessible.
---
That's true, but a talos is about a 33% damage increase over a brutix for a similar increase in cost (1200 versus 1600 dps and 80m vs 120m if my memory serves, these numbers are old).  Bulkheads affect significantly more than that due to stacking multiplicatively.

What I've heard from most people: space feels emptier due to no local, but everyone you meet is actually active that you might have an encounter with so space feels more active. Previously you had regions (Fade) full of 'activity' of bots, which didn't provide any player interaction.
---
I mean, you're dumb enough to think that was my argument.
---
TEST.... sigh.
---
On top of this, I have used the EveUniversity wiki “Wormhole sites” page that has a list of all the different sites and what class they can appear in to help identify the class of wormhole by the combat anomalies. This is the easiest way that I as a new player was/am able to write off a hole as not worth scanning down
---
Specially comissoned? It's public data that iirc is ran by firing a.
---
They may have such sense, or they may not. This sense, or lack thereof, isn't driving the desire for this sort of change. What many people who ask for this change want is nothing short of *revenge.* They feel they've been wronged, or that they've had to live a life of destitution (of various forms) while those they despise appear to live lives of plenty. They clamor for such changes not for any particular desire to balance the game, but to inflict harm. They want the quality of life of those they hate to be reduced merely out of spite. 
---
The worst is when they try to hide it. If they showed their hatred openly, I could respect that.
---
Basically there is a higher requirement of survival and it'll take a toll until people adapt. Its a lot more complicated than pushing a button. You've gotta make sure you don't get dragged in your falcon. You gotta warp it in, save the inhib, warp back to the inhib at 100. Or have it ready in the site. Or have a ceptor which gives the recon a warpin. Etc.
---
Keep the narrative
---
I tried heavy launchers like twice but the rate of fire was just eeeeh and somehow they didn't seem to fit the engage patterns and whatever needed to be done in abyssal deadspace.
---
However, for the purpose of popping the long range caches, hell yeah. I'm definitely going to try one more time and see if it improves the loot aspect while not slowing down the run too much.
---
"this meta" lol......................I still use excavators on my Goon alt. You just have to be good

My 2 cents:
---
That's when the then "new" FW system kicked in and it was the last large surge in FW activity. More activity means more pvp and the great thing about FW was the ease of getting solo/small gang pvp without high effort investment. 
---
No citadels meant that system control mattered a lot (living out of POS in hostile space was, well, shit compared to citadels.) It was also right after the frigate and cruiser tiericide and in the amarr/mil warzone when the map got opened up with the new gate in kurniainen.
---
Not to say it didn't have issues. Off grid boosters were oppressive (if you didn't have your own) with every "good" soloer having a max skills, mindlinked, unprobable, Loki giving them constant max skirmish links.

They're not trying to kill the game, they're trying to kill your game.

---
    -Because everyone needs Toilet Paper.
---
No, because if that happens test and goons will steamroll all null keeps within 4 weeks and then what?
---
It's not disingenuous. Mass bot bans have happened (apparently quite a lot and we didn't know until somewhat recently) and this didn't dip the population in this way. This all started around the same the blackout did as well - specifically the local changes. 
---
Folks trying to paint this as simply nullseccers "REEEING" are just as disingenuous as those trying to paint this as solely the blackouts fault.
---
Yeah but thats the thing, you had a decent run then. Some days rngesus says fuck you and you get 3 almost empty sites in a row and just trash loot. Abyssal is not nearly as consistent as other activitys like incursions, ratting or mining. I would be fine with making abyssal riskier tho. But restricting it to a certain area of space is no solution. Maybe increase the overall difficulty of the sites or remove the ability to warp off/turn on modules after exiting a site for a minute and show it anywhere in system on the overview, like a cyno.

No, fights which make headlines do not still happen. Not sure what's confusing for you.

So moon mining is unsafe but literally everything else is completed safety outside suicide ganks and in nullsec everything is dangerous and this means nullsec has less risk.

That’d look good on my hisec incursion alt

VNI ratting was easy sure but fuckin super ratting.... 
---
so its an ok example, if you went afk when super ratting you could lose alot of isk in t2 fighters. Because you were always there pressing buttons you'd look at local more, you would hit dscan. You were aware of your suroundings because of the inconvenience of fights getting killed. It was a little less boring, you at least had buttons and healthbars to play with.
---
The single most useless T3 subsystem

Well the the other factor was that I was trying to minimize clicks, so heavy missile launchers last longer without reloading and needing another click.

100% this.

I fought the original Goonfleet in Syndicate back in 2005 or so, when they were pets of KIA corp, TheMittani was unknown (i don't know if he even played back then) and their CEO was called Remedial (or Firstname Lastname, i think both were characters belonging to the same guy, but one of them got banned or something).
---
I remember zipping through a swarm of about 200 frigates and rookie ships in my shiny (at the time) brand new vagabond that i couldn't replace without a month of ratting in belts (because there were no anoms, no wormholes, no exploration, nothing). I was taking drive-by potshots but couldn't stick around and orbit to secure kills, just zooming through a mass of ships that all had a web and a scrambler fitted, trying to keep at least 10km away from each and every one, locking and shooting targets as i went to break them up and prevent them from burning to our sniping battleship fleet.
---
It was probably among the most terrifying and at the same time most fun experiences of my entire time in eve. And i actually respected these guys for having the nerve, the balls and the tenacity to upset the meta, go against the elitism prevalent in nullsec at the time and play in a way that was so completely different to anything everyone else was doing, that the established groups had trouble countering it. They were fun and brought a bit of a needed shake-up to the game.
---
I came back to EvE after 12 years to find them a big established organization, just like any other "maintain the status quo" group in the history of the game, that looks like a bad copy of Band of Brothers: biggest baddie group around, a lot of  big ships and propaganda on online discussion boards, just with worse pvp skills.
---
I don't know about the rest of the big players because i didn't have any dealings with them when i was playing or was away from the game when they started forming. But if the posts on this subreddit are representative of the real situation, nullsec has a bigger problem than CCP messing with their playstyle, and it's a mentality/culture issue that may rot them from the inside through lack of adaptability. Or they may just shed most of their dead weight and become smaller but better versions of themselves, time will tell.
---
Can you please just go back to asking for your lowsec gate
---
So what your saying, "I want to AFK mine, but I am terrible at this game and GRRR CCP for making me actually play a game"
---
Keep eating that crap you are being spoon fed, makes you look real smart.
---
&gt; You say that, but at the same time when people post charts with data available about how the ~~player numbers~~ characters logged -in numbers are declining rapidly, the blinders come on.
---
The point is we don't know.  Nor do we know if temporary lower numbers will remain that way once Chaos ends or becomes the new normal.   You may not be wrong.  But PCU doesn't tell you that you are right.

I hope they don't remove asset safety now, more than ever. There's an unspoken burden associated with looting structures like this -- you have to move and sell all the shit! Sure, it's a lot of stuff, but you've A) got to get it out of the jetcans it spawns in, 2) move it to somewhere to sell, and iii] babysit orders for unsalable items like Shield Rechargers and Hull Reps and Taint Polarity Refrunger IIs and shit. That's a lot of work to get paid. Truly, by allowing asset safety, CCP is sparing us this Herculean effort, and should be applauded.

Question about static holes in wormhole space:
---
From my understanding a new static doesn't spawn on the exit side as long as no one in the static side warps to it, right? If so, how long does that last or am i mistaken?
---
nah, afk mining is too active.  Haven't done PVE that active since Deklein.
---
that said, the low-effort aspect is kinda the entire point of mining, idk why you'd want to spoil that if you can avoid it.
---
Init is garbage
---
I'm really hoping the overview is the next to go. Let's get this chaos started here already, it's weak sauce so far.
---
They're just pushing the goon narrative. Easily seen by the complete and utter lack of surprise on any of those dudes faces (Mittens involved to add weight to this cast).
---
It's likely Goons numbers purposefully steadily decreasing as to add credibility to their narrative that it's killing the game. All in order to provide evidence, and force CCP's hand.
---
This isn't even without precedence. It's well documented that Goon leadershits have told their line members to do certain things in order to push a goal for the betterment of the goonunion. In this case, i wouldn't even doubt if the beebois believed it was the betterment of everyone, and were *mooore* complicit. 
---
If only i had proof.
---
Please come destroy stuff, i beg you
---
Or they've been busy as shit because this is the most hectic the game's ever been between trying to revive a stagnant nullsec and dealing with a botpocalypse so they decided to shelve it for the time being to work on more important things.
---
Thanks for the reply, sort of what i was looking for.
---
More like to fag. Hahaha lmao rekt nerd
---
Because most of the buys in the null block were in smaller alliances before one of these changes.
---
It would go pop about two seconds after undocking.
---
In the dimly lit corner of this post comes the most salient point ... take my upvote
---
And so it begins. Let chaos reign.
---
Damage application nerf to capitals, maybe even an EHP nerf. Change to cidatel mechanics to boost cap use against them. Basically, making caps good at killing battleships, other caps and structures, and shit at dealing with smaller ships, so that they need to be escorted and not be a "one size fits all" solution.
---
Asset safety nerf so that a worthwhile part of the loot drops and people have a reason to go structure bashing.
---
Yeah. From the *speeddddd*
---
How shit titans must die before they understand - titan ratting is ended. 
---
P.S. Good kill, kill them all.
---
Eh. I would prefer to see nullification only apply to deployable bubbles, and dictor/hictor bubbles able to stop everything. Maybe even just dictor bubbles? I'm kinda torn between those two.
---
The general idea is if you are willing to actually put bodies to the task of camping a gate, you ought to be able to meaningfully restrict traffic. It puts people in space and makes gatecamping actually work as an activity to defend and harass. Bubble wrapping a gate to the point of making a white so white that it slices grooves into one's eyeballs is too powerful to justify a total removal of nullification.
---

So the only logical thing to do is to come farm in wormholes. Come on iiiiiiiin.
---
I sure hope not! I'm banking on maximum detriment to the game as possible. Once market collapses I'm all in with 100's of billion isk. If they manage to pick up the pieces and revive it after, maybe I'll be in the trillions when market picks back up. If not, who cares? It will be dead and buried at that point
---
This is my plan anyway. Come on CCP fuck this thing up good.
---
Just because you don't get that impression doesn't mean it hasn't been happening. No one shouted louder than nullsec about citadels but they still came out. We yelled when rorquals and excavators came out but that didn't stop ccp from adding them.
---
Also you don't seem to understand why they drop capitals on you, they don't want a fight they want you to leave their space. Most hunters aren't looking for a fight they are looking for easy kills, the correct response to this is overwhelming force. You want a fair fight don't go to goon space, this should be easy to figure out.
---
More tank doesnt necesary means that it will tank like a jaguar or a hawk. Or kite like a wolf...
---
Depends how big is the buff.

They should be fast at least to kill an stiletto. And counter tacle a jaguar. Its me opinnion.
---
Sorry typing from the mobile...
---
&gt; Assuming that they agree with your assessment that the changes that they made (blackout specifically) are hurting player counts, they don't have to be all that smart to reverse them, right?
---
Actually, they do.
---
The problem is they're at the point of having to attract players back to the game after they've quit.  That's going to take much more than a simple reversal of the changes.
---
Also, there's the faction of players that like the changes.  A simple reversal causes them to quit.
---
Unwinding stupid changes isn't a simple thing.

Good! Space should be harder to hold and resources easier to contest. Now if we can get CCP to dial back the amount of resources in the game to create a compelling reason to fight for and secure systems, things might get interesting.

So much role playing, I can read a story or take a walk through a forest.

---
That is always the biggest concern with CCP.
---
Friendly reminder: Nullblocs are primary targets of pirat. 
---
Also: Mining other peoples moons with an orca in npc corp makes you vulnerable to focused ganks only, which are rare for a standard orca. So with an army of it you probably can live of others with little to no risk.
---
If you made it, you're both the reason it went for 10 years and didn't for 20.
---
Also, the fact that there even was money made makes the game successful, even if it dies.
---
It also makes no sense to have a 15 year old player be completely locked down by rookie ships
---
Or. Or... And hear me out when I say this.

Maybe the company is tired of dealing with a 16 year old game that has the baggage of an incredibly toxic community and difficult to modernize gameplay mechanics?

**Here's a mad Wormhole idea**
---
Either:
---
1. Static wormholes no longer need scanning down. Non-static do.
---
1. Static wormholes need scanning down, but not non-static.
---
This will increase WH activity and make it easier to find routes accross the galaxy which should really mix things up. I would probably go for number 2 otherwise WH corps might just disappear altogether.
---
**In terms of keeping new players playing**
---
How about T1 Pre-Fit ships. Modules / Rigs are permananetly fixed in place and you only need the skills to fly the ship itself, not the module skills so Newbros can use them early on and get an idea of how ships are supposed to be fit.
---
Alpha accounts should be able to fly them and they should contain low meta modules. Players can get a feel for a ship before comitting to specific training. Once you get a handle on ship fitting you will naturally start to fit your own ships so you can use higher meta modules.
---
~~easy~~ weird trick
---
but muh ticks
---
I think we should have wormhole effects change at every downtime, gas huffing rorqals, wormhole generators for all corporations not just HK and 1 titan per wormhole.
---
Ah yeah, HTP only (consisting of like 20 people) has more Provi cap kills than any other group. Maybe whored on more cap kills, or at least say RC, but not HTP.
---
Goon always wins!
---
Also it would make Goons supercapital supeority de jure permernantly. Since they can smash enemy keepstars and either destroy/loot the supercaps inside.
---
&gt; our Lord savior Mittani has his data collection team working on it. You just don't understand his multi dollar empire
---
show us on the doll where the numbers touched you.
---
&gt;I think the cold war is over and if people are still trying to have titan fights vs ether goons or test at this point need to really look at what there messing at and move on and find something else to do..
---
Good news!  With the cyno changes we can't have titan fights anymore.
---
The umbrella still exists.  I know this because plenty of goons will happily tell you that it was all the smaller alliances that were nerfed.  
---
So there is still plenty of krabbing possible in a tightly watched system.  
---
I still think the ultimate end of the age of chaos is the nerfing of the umbrella.  Cyno changes were part of that, though certainly not executed the way many would have liked.  But nerfing the amount a region can be krabbed on any given day would be the next logical change.  This would reduce how much resource collection could fit under any one umbrella.  
---
A well organized group will still be safe, but the coordination necessary will have to go up.  More sources for friction within the group?  Maybe.  I don't know.
---
You've just described Hearthstone.
---
Oh right, that must be it. You cracked the case.
---
The game would benefit from a reset, if there were an audience interested in this style of gameplay. The current playerbase is what needs to be cultivated and encouraged to spend more. New players aren't the answer, because there are far more people who want quick gameplay and pick-up then put-down type games. Sprawling epics and slow gameplay has become the realm of single-player games, be they AAA or Indie. Multiplayer has shifted to quick rounds, MOBA and/or Battle Royale style gameplay that draws a large audience. Part of the reason for that, is the quick nature of it and then a player can go back to their single-player game after 10 quick rounds of Overwatch or whatever. A multiplayer experience that is quick and social, a single-player experience that has depth but is easy to get into.
---
Eve (and other MMOs) play the long game, have wait times for activities or potential for long periods of inactivity. You can guarantee 100% that you'll get to do things right away in Overwatch/League/Apex, etc (I really dislike those games, and don't play them, but it is what it is), but an MMO like Eve may have a wait time or time spent finding something to do.
---
WE appreciate Eve gameplay, but the larger gaming audience does not, unfortunately. CCP pivoting to Mobile is a good indication of their acceptance of that fact. The "Chaos" era is another, as it is designed to make more quick content and less safety. Dropping Trigs into PVE areas in HS is another... where it inspires formerly AFK-miners to actively game with others and protect (or at least that was the idea?). The new project they plan to work on, will (and should) focus on quick-engagement gameplay. That is the meta in the industry, but it isn't the fault of the industry... it is what the majority of consumers are looking for.

We are lucky to have some of the MMOs we have. WoW, FFXIV, Eve... they all survive because of niche audiences they cater to, with almost no competition. Once they go, however, I fear that we won't get MMOs of their ilk again. If there were greater audiences for these things, then AAA companies would be all over it and trying to get a piece of the pie. That was tried a long time ago, but no one could break into the market, fell into F2P models and eventually faded... while games you have to PAY to play still exist and thrive because they have a stranglehold on that market. There is no other Cartoony-WoW competitor, none for FFXIV in the fantasy realm and no real Space MMO to compete with Eve. All these things have withstood time since the early 2000s (WoW, FFXI then FFXIV and Eve) because the core players stay there. Not because they are constantly gaining new players and becoming a juggernaut.
---
Thank you :)
---
CCP has gone through and obliterated many deep safes because they are often exploits.
---
YO JUST LET ME FIT MY SHIP WITH MODULES STORED IN CONTAINERS ALREADY.
---
He’s been trying to lose that for weeks now. Grats bro!
---
Which idiot is going to go rat in their Titan after this?  Cull the low hanging fruit for a few weeks but after that the number of available targets is going to fall and fall quite hard.
---
I was literally on talking in static ns a few weeks ago asking for cosmic sigs to be delayed from display, so that wh space becomes less safe for ratting.
---
But that doesn't matter; null had its own ratting problem that is now bring taken care of
---
I'm glad every nullbear got hurt
---
Factions already dunk t1s but they don't often have the insurmountable raw stats to be uncontestable by t1. (Unless you're a dual medium extender, mwd, scram worm)
---
&gt;  bringing hard counters to a group of people you already outnumber is a cheap way to deter a fight and deny everyone content
---
Deny *you* content. They don't want to fight you, they want to krab, so they bring overwhelming force as a deterrent. That's what happens in games, people metagame.
---
Let's see your zkill then.
---
People working together for mutual benefit? The horror.
---
My "isk faucet" is my RL work/grind. Nerf wh ratting. Make it less safe. 
---
Bring the chaos.
---
&gt;They've hit null with a really hard one-two this summer, they might pull back a bit and give krabs some breathing room to bring people back in
---
Why come back?
---
The problem with stupid game design that drives people away is they've been driven away.  You can't get them back with just a simple reversal.  They're moving away from the game and you need to change their momentum.  Going back to "it's only a little worse instead of bad" isn't gonna do that.
---
At the same time, there's a significant faction of people who didn't quit who would be pissed about a rollback and quit themselves.
---
This is why you have to think through your changes instead of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.
---
Which is a terrible metric.
---
Had some weird feelings for the changes at the point of the announcement.
---
But.. Im glad im on the wow classic hypetrain so i dont care for a couple of weeks \o/
---
Lol I always wonder if concern trolling posts such as these ever think it’s actually effective.
---
We've been getting more recruits now than ever.. Returning players. Only your game died. Eve didn't.
---
Isk has been inflating for 16 years now because the game literally prints it with reckless abandon.
---
Absolutely, smashing dscan every 5 seconds in whs is tedious when you are looking for probes of a guy hunting you and dont know if he left 2 hours later or is still looking
---
&gt;Just because you don't get that impression doesn't mean it hasn't been happening.
---
Correct. However, my impression is based on the available information on, for example, reddit, official forums, and in-game.
---
&gt;No one shouted louder than nullsec about citadels but they still came out. We yelled when rorquals and excavators came out but that didn't stop ccp from adding them.
---
That's great. Unforunately, the main thing that's essentially the root cause - injectors, seems to have been praised by nullsec.
---
&gt;Also you don't seem to understand why they drop capitals on you, they don't want a fight they want you to leave their space.
---
You don't seem to understand that this behavior is not limited to nullsec. Of course it doesn't really matter as it quickly becomes a balance/safety issue if it's possible to "delete" almost any ship instantly.
---
&gt;Most hunters aren't looking for a fight they are looking for easy kills, the correct response to this is overwhelming force.
---
Maybe, but it's somewhat understandable when every loss will likely end up on a killboard and some corp CEOs go apeshit on members when that happens. The main indication I have at this point is that nullseccers support this "failing in public". Null helps shape a certain unsustainable playstyle.
---
&gt;You want a fair fight don't go to goon space, this should be easy to figure out.
---
And if you keep abusing the game mechanics, CCP will eventually step in.
---
Same. It's just larger blocks pretending to be worried about smaller carebears... I'm enjoying their tears
---
Sure and I think it's good for the game if less people ratted in titans.
---
Cutting off the nose to spite the face. Ccp is fixing symptoms and not the actual cause in the worst way possible.
---
I have a Pixel 3A which is listed as a compatible model.
---
Combat refitting was good stuff. 👍
---
Why? Caps work fine the way they are. I never have an issue with mine
---
Unfortunately we will never convince these people that highsec is actually safer because it kills their narrative.
---
Yeh im not talking about casuals, but real logistical chains.
---
Yep. We've definitely had a huge uptick in activity. Everyone and their mother wants to move to a c2/n/5 to farm nullbears and their sweet sweet tears.
---
It's been hectic.
---
Before you go, can I have your stuff?
---
easier said than done
---
That does happen with certain specs in vanilla though? Enjoying leveling as Bear tank or Cat DPS? Tough break, no one will bring you over a Warrior and Rogue in raids. Want to go Balance? Better off playing a Mage/Lock/Hunter for ranged. If you roll a Druid, you can expect to be Resto in end game, at least when playing with tryhards.
---
*looks at PCU*
---
Worth it
---
Question about the new cyno changes.
---
Force recon and blops are the only ships that can fit the regular cynosaural field generator now right?  So why is everyone training covert cyno?  Its not necessary to have unless you are doing covert jumps with those ships that have that ability right?  I can just light a regular cyno in my rapier and it would work as it was before....
---
Or am i missing something?
---
I've never understood it.  Unless you're botting the suffering of PvE in Eve, specifically ratting, is too great a burden.  I assume some super-human autism abilities here.  I can't do it.
---
so i can just slide my main and an alt and have uncontested plexing on the warzone? awesome
---
It's called balancing. And no, you guys aren't the nose of this game. You guys are a disease killing this game and culling your unlimited isk faucets is the great balancing.
---
You still have your 1000man Titan and super fleet. Yeah woe is you. Lol
---
All these flavors and you choose salt
---
If they are fresh players, why have them immediately fly out to nullsec?
---
Less and less people ratting, less and less targets. Eventually there will be no targets and that will be great for eve.
---
Just burning around at full speed (without using any prop mods) consumes no cap whatsoever.
---
#HAHAHAHAHA
---
Component of what!? I need answers
---
well, you wanna talk about skill? Hunting is easy skill wise it just takes multiple accounts.
---
that doesn't sound like adaptation to me at all - it sounds more like doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
---
Rorqual mining had not been restricted in GSF space. You should get better spies.
---
Nah. At some point faucets will be sustainable enough and that many ratters around will be optimal.
---
Hopefully never.
---
It's like you just woke up today and thought "hmmm I didn't want this karma anyway."
---

Horde perspective
---
We'll fix losing players by losing players even faster.
---
If you dont want local just go to wh
---
You wish
---
Some say there are still titans with large rigs. I honestly think they belong to long unsubbed PL members
---
Because nobody wants to live in w space.
---
Look, someone who is economically illiterate.
---
Not true, every BO-Drop now has the same risk for the Dropper, as you do not see how much people (backup) is in local, maybe a cloaked countercyno on grid or all the barges baittanked with DroneDamageAmplifiers, letting 6 or 7 Procs for a few Millions just rip apart a Drop-BO worth some Billions.
---
Happened to us, we fed one of our Blops to a prepared "Mining-OP"
---
Or maybe you could just learn to press your dscan button once in awhile?
---
The hyperbole here is stupid, every isk faucet is infinite and nullsec didn't even have the highest per capita. Also nullsec was basically the only advertisement ccp ever got when they did something crazy. Furthermore if you remove all nullsec ratters and miners who are you elite pvpers going to fight. You sure as hell won't fight each other because you could have done that before the changes but avoided fights like the plague. You want easy kills on krabs but you don't want the krabs to get anything for their time.
---
now just wait six months for Pl too finalty figure out it waas a good idea
---
The difference is that hearthstone is objectively a bad ccg and pretty much exists to juice whales. You can't even buy individual cards without opening packs.
---
ITS FINALLY TRASH TALK TUESDAY!
---
NO MORE CYNOS! RIP EVE
---
BUY CHEAP SUPERS AND TITANS IN DELVE! EVERYTHING 50% OFF!
---
He's gonna have to save up those ticks for a while to get another
---
It will sit right up there with SW galaxies NPE.
---
If only he wasn't a smooth brain
---
How awful it will be when mining ops have predeployed fax maybe dreads and supers already on grid. I can see this becoming the norm for big groups... of course there is always that one moron way out in left field mining away by himself. They need to die anyway
---
Alec I'll take NSFW flair for $500
---
What an idiot.
---
hard to be more casual than undocking and clicking 'jump to cyno'.
---
you vets have become far too comfortable and used to having it super easy. a small change that makes you momentarily experience the problems that everyone else has causes mass rage and threats to unsub. a bit pathetic dont you think?
---
looks like they abandoned the game too lmao
---
It is really, really easy to be on a stuka fleet. Take wh&gt;maybe take a gate&gt;anchor up&gt;lock what gets broadcast&gt;hit f1. Just be glad input broadcasting is against the rules now and there aren't 100 man bomber fleets that are 1 guy.
---
Besides which, anyone with the resources to have a titan has the resources to have a recon alt hanging out with them, they just never had to bother before.  Hell, scouting the next anom with it for pre-inhibs probably makes them safer now that they are.
---
every minute you spent baiting is a minute wasted krabbing.
---
PEOPLE UNIRONICALLY DOWNVOTE TRASH TALK IN A TRASH TALK THREAD. YOU REPRESENT EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME!
---
NO U
---
This guy also had a recon alt with him. RIP.
---
Then keep mining in highsec
---
Do you live in the EU where memes are illegal?
---
But those blocks used to actually be coalitions of independent alliances. That’s not really true anymore.
---
Embarrassing.
---
Last time i checked dscan dosnt work against cloaks or recons
---
&gt;Correct. However, my impression is based on the available information on, for example, reddit, official forums, and in-game.
---
So people screeching about what they say nullsec wanted and not the actual posts or csm minutes by people in nullsec.
---
&gt;That's great. Unforunately, the main thing that's essentially the root cause - injectors, seems to have been praised by nullsec.
---
Please source this because I know plenty of people who said this was bad. 
---
&gt;You don't seem to understand that this behavior is not limited to nullsec. Of course it doesn't really matter as it quickly becomes a balance/safety issue if it's possible to "delete" almost any ship instantly.
---
So nullsec needs to be nerfed because of something the entire game does? 
---
&gt;Maybe, but it's somewhat understandable when every loss will likely end up on a killboard and some corp CEOs go apeshit on members when that happens. The main indication I have at this point is that nullseccers support this "failing in public". Null helps shape a certain unsustainable playstyle.
---
Why is nullsec to blame for that style. That is something elite pvper push and not the major blocs. You are literally projecting things on to nullsec to blame them
---
&gt;And if you keep abusing the game mechanics, CCP will eventually step in.
---
You say abusing mechanics but what is the point of owning space if we can't protect our members and we can't make money there. CCP created a sandbox to allow people to build empires but then whiners got upset that they couldn't attack those empires with 10 people and get kills. I could claim any number of tactics are people abusing mechanics and you would act like it's unreasonable.
---
We both agree what the problem actually is but you celebrate when someone who isn't you is nerfed while nullblocs keep explaining hey this is bad for the game. Then when presented with people who have inside knowledge or data that supports this is bad for the game you claim they are wrong.
---
No I'm in Texas, the most freedomed state in murica
---
I don't think everyone is training covert cyno. It is not needed.
---
Sure, here are mine.
---
Divide up Cynos in to "Cyno I" and "Capital Cyno I". Cyno I can be fit to any ship that can fit it (50 CPU, 1000 PG), Force Recons, Combat Recons, Hics, Blops, and Command Ships get a fitting bonus. Blobps can jump and bridge to Cyno I, Titans can only bridge to them, capitals may not jump to Cyno I.
---
Capital Cyno I can only be fit to Faxes and certain subcaps. Force Recon, Combat Recon, Blops, and HICs have a fitting bonus for Capital Cyno I. All ships can jump or bridge to Capital Cyno I.
---
Capitals now have a 15 second jump spooling timer between clicking "jump" and actually jumping. Being bubbled/hic pointed/pointed past warp strength cancels and resets.
---
Supercarrier have a 30 second spool timer
---
Titans have a 1 minute spool timer.
---
Gut all capital/supercapital EHP.
---
Adjust capital/supercapital blueprints to be extremely hungry for high-ends and lower their demand for trit/pyerite/mexallon. Add Mercoxit to their BOM.
---
i AM THE NEW GIGX
---
I AM THE NEW GIGX
---
High grade snakes should be removed from the game. They are really stupid and like 0 risk if you are in low sec. Ever been tackled by a 13 bil malediction in a 5bil pod from 60km in a 5bil pod? I have. It's really dumb. Having expensive shit shouldn't mean you automatically win.
---
Terrible doesn't mean useless. A minus 500 to 1k count could be explained, not the deep dive we get right now.
---
Link kb
---
Except enough people live there that they almost out pace isk created by nullsec. But far fewer people overall.
---
[The info page](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203465481-Character-Transfer) does not indicate otherwise. I'd say log into the alpha account management page and see if you have the option.
---
"Wah Wah, Goons and Test have more caps/supers than PL" Is all I heard from that.
---
And you cannot afk in a super unless you don't want to kill anything.
---
I did super ratting back a year or two, it is fucking intensive and brain-killing, but at least you were doing something.
---
I also don't understand why people are crying against super ratting, it's very difficult to keep up more than a few hours seeing how intensive it is, and not that lucrative compared to a lot of other activities in Eve.
---
Also, one moment of iost focus and you could lose 25B on the spot.
---
I've lost the ability to light cynos on most characters whose purpose was to light cynos.
---
You have to admit, that particular setting is quite... *chaotic*
---
Riddle me this: What advice would you give to the hundreds of people experiencing this in null sec currently?   
---
Without sarcasm or smack talk, what would you suggest any subcapital in null sec do to adapt to survive pve in it's current state with EVE Bomber's Online?
---
For me it was the great Storys of Eve betrail spying war's this IS Wat got me into Eve first
---
I really liked the editing!
---
It wasn't already?
---
I'm still waiting
---
&gt; AIDS of npcing in eve
---
whats next,ratting is too much work and it should be able to be done passively?
---
Your English is bad, and calling people stupid in a language you barley speak seems like a poor idea.
---
i dont know that at all actually. its quite possible that the rewards were far too big and are now more appropriate. there are also other benefits and rewards to living in null that arent strictly limited to isk making by ratting, and besides, people that only want to PVE, mine or Rat should not be based in the area of space that is explicitly meant to be a dangerous and risky place to live with a focus on individual, corp and alliance level PVP.
---
Balance wise, you cannot remove an umbrella's ability to defend with 200 dudes through a cyno as long as the attacker can attack with 200 dudes through a cyno. If you want fights, just remove the power of a cyno by giving it a long warm up cycle before anything can jump.
---
All three of them? 😱
---
&gt;  Sounds like you mad that you cant achieve top end in game isk and rewards with little to no risk. 
---
Haha, yes you can just go to a wormhole.
---
Well it's a sound argument.
---
One of the many problem hunters have is that lowsec is completely dead. I had more small gang and solo pvp action in lowsec back in the day than anywhere else.
---
Now lowsec is completely useless, and these changes are not helping, and they feel blackout gave them a "purpose", gave them content they're entitled to, and that everything was due to those nullsec krabs and empires rigging the CSM.
---
Protip : Everything is CCP's fault.
---
Protip
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
You only play a certain way, a way that is really smart and you never lose your super expensive ship! Not fair! I want you to play my way, where I easily kill you super easily because I'm super l33t at EvE PvP.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Guys!! He did the salt meme!!
---
You take that back, those are love spikes, and they deserve to be held!
---
blackout made fozzie sov worse. Now you have to warp to every single node in every single system to make sure it isn't being toasted by an atron
---
Yes, there seems to be an issue with the ESI this morning I haven't had a chance to look into yet.
---
It should be working with all manufacturing jobs - what issue are you seeing specifically? If you want to hop onto the EVE Tycoon discord (linked on the contact page), you can post screenshots to help debug the issue.
---
dead. dead. out of range
---
Just goes to show that game design by democracy is a bad idea.
---
Posts like these are why no one takes you seriously
---
How are the faucets going to be sustainable? Pre cyno but post blackoit it wasn't worth rating in any sub cap because the risk was to high for the potential reward. Now the risk is to high for capital ships compared to the reward. Are we supposed to believe ccp will be buff the isk someone can make in nullsec to compete with highsec?
---
The constant question with these changes is, why rat in nullsec when you can make more in highsec with less risk? And once you accept that why should anyone even own nullsec space? All owning space does is make people feel like you owe them fair fights.
---
Gavin "Wormholer btw" McInnes
---
Lol triggered much
---
Some people simply refuse to believe that warnings apply to them too.
---
Hahaha Iron Armada
---
Ok thanks
---
i don't disagree that frat has allot of bots. But, they do have allot of actual players. My theory is that they've just been burned out. No one likes 20 max form CTAs a day
---
Hahaha snuff
---
Combat refitting was awesome! It felt a lot more like you are actively piloting your ship, adapting to the situation, using knowledge to your advantage.
---
I love how r/eve considers titan ratting something that should be preserved for 'idiots', don't want to make ratting in the most powerful and what should be the most hard to obtain ship class in the game require any thought.
---
We've never claimed otherwise, only that anyone who ever loses something to us without meaning to should be a bit embarrassed.
---
thats a very long winded way of saying, i want to be able to afk for months and still have all my stuff when i come back
---
When you only have grammar to criticize , it's often because you cannot say anything against the arguments the person made.
---
Also if you cannot understand everyone isn't a native english speaker on the internet, you must have some problem.
---
then the rest of you have a reason to try and take them down together
---
Except it won't stop this from happening and is just a change that makes everybody's (in-game) lives just more of a pain in the ass than it already is.
---
I don't know why people are downvoting a plain statement of a simple fact.
---
they also need to move everyone over to these keepstars to blow them up, leaving them vulnerable at home no?
---
Yep, I joined in my Kestrel. Though I guess the Archon wasn't exactly a noob ship.
---
This one was long overdue.
---
True, and if they don't show their hatred openly you're still free to assume it's their primary motivator. Makes it much simpler to delegitimize the other side of the argument.
---
Fucking ccp created the problem in the first place. Skill injectors and Rorqual mining were a mistake. The way they are trying to fix it is a slap in the face to anyone who has been playing a significant amount of time. Capitals can take years to train into and for allot of players, even before rorqs and skill injectors, they were a major endgame goal. Now the rug gets pulled out when people finally reach the goal they've been trying to get to for years. It's kinda shitty if you ask me. And it is 100% CCPs fault.
---
Obviously not in a smaller group or you would know your statement is seriously flawed.    They have capitals just not the huge numbers.     This just makes them being able to take a fight even less likely in a lot of situations.
---
Nerfing 1 or 2 things at a time is a super lazy way of "balancing" a game. IMHO
---
HTP has been in providence for longer than it's been with RC.
---
They now have room for better, smarter rewards. A balanced ecosystem doesn't happen overnight though.
---
Just have a higher level of maturity is all.
---
I didn't have to beg daddy ccp to help me get ez kills.
---
there is so much free space right now that you can't even give it away.  the problem is that if you don't have an umbrella (or the numbers to keep recons in each system now), you can't use the space.
---
Titans 1-50 plus a 200 man subcap support fleet go helicopter dick their stuff.
---
Titans 51-500 and the rest of the 800 subcaps stay home.
---
Exactly. Unfortunate but true.
---
I use blue light blocking glasses a LOT, but sadly cannot with Eve.  The eye strain is real sometimes.
---
check the KB and tell that to Faternity XD I have pulled in half a billion isk since DT with my miners, and as Faternity learned the cyno changes did not stop us XD
---
Nah you are wrong, Wormholes have been as safe as null sec for a long time.
---
why can it not be both.   Because they lose the ability to use capitals they are moving to blocs.    
---
Again you really need to broaden the groups you hang out with to understand what your talking about.
---
.... and SP.
---
Just moved to Texas, can not confirm. Texas is unfree as fuck. Arizona is freest state.
---
I read the first sentence, realized then you were a moron, skipped to end in order to downvote.
---
So go live there
---
No, Tuskers would still suck.
---
It sounds like you would be sent an e-mail with a redemption code for the skins at some point in Sept. I have not received mine.
---
Exactly it's an alpha !      
---
Yes it needs work, and tons of things are place holder. But it looks great and runs smooth.
---
So no one should live in nullsec is your stance?
---
I am willing to trade my anathema with large rigs for a titan with large ones.
---
Those are titans with cynos up.
---
Ah yes, cus all i did was undock and click jump to cyno. Just like ccp you clearly have zero idea what goes into mass alliance level logistics. Lets make an aspect and profession of eve that already feels like a job More of a job. Cus thats a great way to keep those players around. I already left the game at the start of the year, and im honestly baffled that some of these changes have gone through since i left. Its funny to see how many of those that were in my same profession are even playing anymore. And im not talking about lol joe that moves 1 jf every week to and from jita, im talking about those that move battlefleets of supbcaps and keep an alliance stocked on thier doctrines.  I left due to watching this game on a downward spiral thats only continued since leaving, very few changes that happened are ones that needed to happen and those were almost all changed for the wrong reasons.
---
Ronin ONE
---
you literally just agreed with me...
---
What is there to criticize? He didn't actually have a point, he just called everyone who disagrees with him stupid.  
---
I understand not everyone is a native speaker. But if you wanna call someone stupid in your 3rd language you better have great grammar, otherwise you come off as the stupid one.
---
I like how i have no inbox space now and I dont have to delete emails every monday.
---
Seems fine
---
I love Bluebell ice cream!
---
And ccp is famously good at iterating in changes. Maybe if that was their objective they could deploy all their changes at once?
---
How many players do you think they will lose while we wait for them to actually deploy this mythical better reward system? What percent of these are going to stay gone even if CCP does do this.
---
They literally created a race condition for themselves and have never been good at that.
---
So re-buff them to previous levels.
---
&gt; This game gets on front pages due to big fights.
---
Yes but as seen from CCP's recent retention numbers the new players joining isn't the problem, retaining them is.  Subcap fights do more to retain players.
---
&gt;every isk faucet is infinite
---
No.
---
How would you make war more fun? Obviously the sov system is aids but I'm not really sure how we can make wars more fun without making the risk/reward comically slanted in a generic turboblob alliances favor. How would you make wars worth fighting for smaller alliances? How can you make a war as valuable to a small alliance as a large alliance?
---
As a noob I was shocked to find out there are giant spaceship healers. Command vessels as u said makes sense but the amount of 'repping' that is possible in this game was totally unexpected.
---
Nope :(
---
Sure.    
---
* Cannot be lit within 100km of a structure.  
---
* Criminal status for lighting it.  
---
* Costs 100m
---
That goes some way towards explaining why we couldn't get a fight out of White Sky on the other side of Genesis last night.
---
It's good that we're losing bots and nullbears. There's too much isk in null and there's a proliferation of capitals. This is great balancing.
---
These are all listed as temporary changes right? Just a "let's be safe until we figure this out" policy.   
---
Groups will adapt, they'll find a policy  that can make things as productive as possible. Hopefully this change will restore some of the balance that CCP was aiming for.  While I'm not 100% on the implementation, the ultra-safe Kapital-Krabbing under an umbrella was OP, and needed to be knocked-down a bit.    
---
In the meantime, people who are dumb and can't read pings will die.
---
What? lmao
---
If you don't think your make enough isk. Go brave wormhole space.
---
True. They did create a race for themselves. But remaining trapped in the previous status quo was also not good either.
---
I know, I used T1 industrial ships on my cyno alts
---
We're not losing bots tho. And losing the people who are most likely to be whales is the worst business mov ever.
---
None of which can be used in combat :^)
---
Much better. That sabre approaching us now doesn't have a cyno with 10000 carriers waiting to drop on our lonely astero...
---
Get fucked null blocks! Now you gotta fight us in subcaps. Lol
---
I mean, they release the numbers, you could look at them and see your mistake.
---
I'm ok with this with a small balance addition:
---
- Jump Freighters cannot jump to regular, covert or industrial cynosural fields.
---
Big nope on my end.
---
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature as there is feature catch a ship without even probing.
---
Most krabbers are playing solo, not in fleet, not in comms. That's why they never form, until an FC pings for a response fleet by which time the attackers have moved on.
---
Yea really I mean what better rewards? Are they just going to jack up bounties and loot drops or are they rolling out a new “reward system”   
---
I wanna know, the blackout and cyno changes make ratting in anything that used to be efficient not worth it anymore, how does CCP compensate for that?
---
You have inflated PLEX prices, the cost of building things hasn’t gone down, methods of income haven’t been adjusted to compensate for the increased risk, so what does CCP expect all the people that used things like null ratting to do? 
---
If that playstyle is no longer profitable do they just expect everyone to move to wormholes or high sec? Most people aren’t going to bother, they are just going to go play a different game that doesn’t require insane tedium.
---
Echoes? go to jita, at least 50 ppl there during the day
---
Hilmar is now a wormholer, so expect more and more of this brain damaged bullshit.
---
Tell me what to do/bait against 200 bombers. if you get someting in that could beat em they just fuck off and cloak until they have a better target, else they kill everything and fuck off afterwards. its just boring.
---
I was in null in less the 6 months with a rookie training alliance. Never went back to hisec. That was 10 years ago.
---
Cyno vigil for cynos.
---
Not yet
---
But that's not happening; we're killing bots and fighting active pvpers in null. The game has more activity now than before, and the mcu is a terrible metric.
---
This guy explains it well; https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d1ruql/dr_pculove_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and/
---
Yeah right, let’s just delete almost all risks from a jump capable ship. 
---
Another idea in the trash bin
---
how often did u die to / saw 200 bombers compared to solo hunters or microgangs?
---
Link your zkillboard for your character. Let's see who is calling other people cowards
---
Looking at the blue doughnut with yellow sunglasses just turns them into corpmates.
---
Or bugs.         
---
But i am saying about legitimate ones.
---
yes, its fine, this is fine.
---
I've only been playing for 2 months and I've considered quitting twice due to ganking. I don't give a shit about pvp.
---
It seems there is more than that in his response, but you know, maybe he's right.
---
And no, not being perfect in another language is not related to being stupid.
---
I mean that wasn’t a prepared statement or anything.
---
I hope you are really in Elitist Ops and we’re not getting flair baited because this is peak buttblasted posting
---
Which isk faucet is not infinite?
---
&gt;So with the most recent cyno changes who will "riot"/cry more, Goons or TAPI. 
---
You, according to this post
---
Re-shipped about 49 times as well, what dedication!
---
As said, I don’t think everyone is rushing Covert cynos now. They require way more SP than their regular counterpart, and can only be fitted to CovOps capable ships. It’s already a broader choice to chose from rather than just Force Recons and BLOPS, but it’s still limited.
---
And then, the only ship that can jump to them are BLOPS. Yes they can open bridge to them for other CovOps ships, but it won’t help everyone such as a Titan bridge to an Ibis Cyno, for example.
---
Don't stop believing , these awful changes are obviously right.
---
You don't seem to be understanding. If the best places to make isk are highsec and wspace, why does nullsec need to keep getting nerfed?
---
Normally, once the wormhole only have sixteen hours of life left, the static has very big risks to spawn.
---
Have you tried forming just enough to have a fight, and not "fuck off from our farming lands" fleet?
---
what does safety mean to you?  Define it please
---
I don’t know how à Confessor will perform in a C2 that doesn’t have a Wolf Rayet effect. And even with one, the boosts won’t be that awesome compared to C13 Wolf Rayets (=C6 effects power).
---
Wormholes
---
It's not "hard to obtain" is it you doofus.
---
And it doesn't require "thought" either, unless that thought is, "there are 1,000 more productive things I could be doing with my time, or 1,001 if I include flushing my head down the loo".  After those 1,001 thoughts thought 1,002 should be, "I'll just buy a plex".
---
I ratted for my plex so it's free! I mean I paid with my infinitely more valuable RL time but it's still free!
---
Don't wanna risk your Titan?
---
Don't bring it.
---
/debate
---
Not for you personally, but I just recruited a bunch of returning players. 
---
That's just how it is, man. Every single one of them was super impressed with ccp for removing local from null.
---
And your post is a slightly less long winded way of saying "I stage from Jita 4-4 CNAP." Oh, look, both our responses are dumb. Don't do this.
---
TL;DR
---
Because high sec is less safe than null sec
---
What's your corp/alliance? I'd like to take a look for myself and see if the player count is going up or down. I see a lot of people saying this exact thing so I would like to verify on dotlan if your words are true. Mostly from what I can see its mostly red, not a big uptick of people joining.
---
Correct but given current trends this was probably the worse choice. Doing it piece by piece like this means we have no idea if they intend to actually improve the situation give the disdain they seem to have towards pve and nullsec. If they released it all at once after a few months they might have stayed on the slow slope but probably not drive off a cliff.
---
https://i.imgur.com/eDxLOKH.png
---
I advice anyone to keep track of their spending on a game like eev or others that are based on micro-transactions
---
&gt;So people screeching about what they say nullsec wanted and not the actual posts or csm minutes by people in nullsec.
---
I just told you.
---
&gt;Please source this because I know plenty of people who said this was bad. 
---
The "famous" goon. I'm not going to name names.
---
&gt;So nullsec needs to be nerfed because of something the entire game does? 
---
The cyno change impacts all areas.
---
&gt;Why is nullsec to blame for that style. 
---
Nullsec has the loudest voice. It's not the "true" bears in HS who care about this.
---
&gt;That is something elite pvper push and not the major blocs. You are literally projecting things on to nullsec to blame them
---
No. This is coming from null. It's essentially a "cultural fuck you" that aligns with the largest groups that abuse the game mechanics the most. Every player must be tracked and potentially be held accountable.
---
&gt;You say abusing mechanics but what is the point of owning space if we can't protect our members and we can't make money there.
---
Do you think there is such a thing as "abusing game mechanics"? If yes, you know there is a line somewhere. If no, you don't understand the problem.
---
&gt;CCP created a sandbox to allow people to build empires but then whiners got upset that they couldn't attack those empires with 10 people and get kills.
---
Might as well say botters are salty since they can't bot, which is arguably more true.
---
&gt;I could claim any number of tactics are people abusing mechanics and you would act like it's unreasonable.
---
No, I would probably explain why they are unresonable and how they adversely affect the game.
---
&gt;but you celebrate when someone who isn't you is nerfed while nullblocs keep explaining hey this is bad for the game.
---
Unlikely. I want CCP to fix the balance. Who ultimately gets fucked as a result is mostly irrelevant, but nullsec deserves a lot of shit. The idea that the largest ships should also be the fastest is dumb. The cyno restrictions are good for the game.
---
&gt;Then when presented with people who have inside knowledge or data that supports this is bad for the game you claim they are wrong.
---
They think the pre-blackout status quo was good? This supports the understanding that these people only care about what's good for them at the expense of everyone else and the game.
---
We'll see what happens.
---
They’re returning
---
Because they QUIT when it was too hard for them.  They’ll quit again the MOMENT people adapt to their strategies
---
You get it. 
---
It shouldn't be that way but, well, people are strange and for some reason enjoy doing extremely repetitive things with very low reward and an intermediate probability they're going to lose the previous 250 rewards if they make a mistake.
---
Nobody would play a fruit machine like that.
---
The true endgame.
---
Falcon and Hilmar are just PRERENDING to be frigate loving ganktards and as soon as everyone else quits they’ll show their true form and krab in peace
---
They’ll hit anomalies because if they touched the truly safe things such as krabbing in wormholes or cloaking the screaming would hurt their ears
---
And what is the limit?
---
Did you just discover the phrase "Concern Trolling" or something? It feels like you are throwing it out there in every post like some great accomplishment.
---
Yes telling someone to "shut the fuck up" over Reddit shows a very high level of maturity
---
Probably in a week or two.
---
What does nullsec have similar to concord that will guarantee who ever attacks you dies?
---
I’ll admit i took blackout well, the taxes too, the struggling economy.
---
But, the raging sperging if roaming frigates and the removal of “fun” made it unworthy it to me.
---
I’ll wait until the people who “returned” to eve quit again when they get bored soon
---
CCP looks at the income rates from 10 years ago and says "hey we used to get paid in real money when people were making less ISK"  
---
Olmeca travels to a foreign country for free and decides to keep it going as long as possible. So he says "CCP is right".
---
"optimal" means CCP actually makes money to prove PA that it's a good business, everything else is negligible secondary afterthoughts of insignificant people.
---
With the exception of wormholes (and the people drooling over RnK videos) it was also OP / bullshit. The skill element to it was exaggerated anyway
---
We can do without combat refitting.
---
You can only run a site once and it does not respawn
---
Wait wait. That high sec Cyno would consume 1m/sec and 100 to activate.
---
It's called asset safety for a reason mate
---
There are still so many bots
---
Arizona Chief, we are what Texas wishes it could be
---
you cant print isk with your credit card m8, fyi
---
Yeah you can clearly see all the people here whining about how they have adapted instead of saying the game is dead /s
---
Big oof
---
Found Falcon's other alt account.
---
Sure, look up Ronin ONE
---
Local firesale
---
log in 2 min before dt and cyno out to an empty system
---
Thats a new rule on r/eve.
---
If you are not 100% in favour of these changes you are wrong, your experiences in the game are invalid, your opinion is irrelevant, your facts dont count.
---
Titans
---
How?
---
it it single shard stuff? What's the server tickrate?
---
You know I am not in PL?
---
I’ve been thinking the same thing:
---
\- fewer people online, no more need for batters, ain’t nobody going to buy what they offer
---
\- huge regions of safe space where we can finally krab in peace and set up our own space station that nobody will ever bother attacking
---
\- invite friends for friendly bouts of banter and all sorts of peaceful shenanigans
---
dammit, cant unsee
---
I could see some broken combo with old combat refitting and new capital modules
---
And how do you know it is empty?
---
Sites never respawn in wspace, there is a finite number of sites ever and then that's the end of wspace?
---
Sell it to the locals.
---
Honestly, your timing couldn't be worse. Cyno mechanics were changed *this morning* so that only force recons (falcon/arazu/rapier/pilgrim) and blops can light them. Your best bet is to asset safety or sell it where it is.
---
i play for only 2 months and i loveeeeeee my experience so far! low sec is so much fun my dude!  sont really care about blackout changes and cyno changes that much
---
&gt; Or simply not have existed in the first place.
---
this.
---
I'm not entirely sold on it at the moment. Don't get me wrong, it's a useful thing to have, but I feel it would be better if it was more consistent/continuous so you can get a clearer idea of when you'll enter warp.
---
In its present iteration it's still not clear when you will, as the bar  slows to a crawl around the 90% mark. I haven't tested it much, but it's especially noticeable when hitting warp-to for a destination that swings the ship around 90*
---
CCP's income.
---
dotlan npc numbers and no wh's in system it's prob fecking empty
---
The playerbase.
---
LOL wait until the next MER when only two alliances have any income.
---
I haven't PVE'd for isk in two years btw, but it's really hard to shoot people when they are all quitting.
---
Meh. Fuel cost is nothing, that’s just ISK and it’s the most farmed ressource in the game.
---
I just listened to talking in stations and they were like on the complete other side of this. So I think your statement is wrong.
---
So every fleet that ever attacked nullsec and didn't die to titans means its safer than highsec. CCP guarantees concord will destroy them in highsec without any other player intervention. titans might kill them in nullsec but require additional players to do this. Please give a real example of where nullsec is safer
---
Init has always been fairly mid tier; if you think you’re garbage you should get out and see the verse more
---
Can we get "Another One"?
---
&gt;pretty much unaffected
---
You mean to tell me that the largest group in terms of numbers, caps, and super caps were the least affected? It's almost like numbers matter in Eve!!!!
---
Of course the group with the most people is the least affected. Of course these changes are going to hit smaller entities harder. 
---
What did we lose? The ability to tell when someone enters your system unless you have a scout (bot) on the gate. We lost the ability to rely on near2 and other local Intel tools to tell you, hey idiot, dock up now you're in null sec and there's bads nearby. 
---
And now we lost the ability to have the biggest ships in the game immediately bring in all their friends who are also in giant ships on grid instantly to provide an extraordinary amount of repping power that could only be contested by the largest groups in the game in addition to mind boggling dps that tracks subcaps almost perfectly. 
---
Sure. Things still died in the non chaos era, but the slope of players leaving the game began shortly after the rorqual change where you could mine a couple titans a month. Super cap umbrellas were oppressive to anyone who entered them. Nobody came to knock down the sand castle because what's the point? Citadel's need to be changed next so that they aren't cancer to remove, and then the sov system needs some tlc. Taking over enemy territory should be difficult but not this level of difficult. Try to kill the citadel's in a system? It takes at least a week. Ridding delve of the structures, even if you had no contest, would take years. 
---
I agree that having a way to circumvent the blackout, like a comms structure ( please Bob no reinforcement timer) that has a certain au range would be great. But the cyno changes are one of the better things to come out of CCP in the recent years. 
---
Small, skilled groups can now take on supers and titans that are unsupported. If that super or Titan has proper support though you can still squash the enemy relatively easy.
---
Don't be facetious. It doesn't make you sound more persuasive; it makes you sound like a whiny loser upset that he can't chain rat in their own system. 
---
It's not like wormholers killed the game by over producing Titans and shit, thanks to chain mining and ratting.
---
&gt;No OnE wIlL uSe CaPs NoW tHiS wIlL kIlL cOnTeNt

&gt;Get urself a subcap. There will be more use of those, finally.

Do you honestly think that caps outnumber subcaps or something??

OLMECA GOLD'S GRAND DESIGN OF GAME DEVELOPMENT OMEGALUL
---
God you all are fickle.
---
For years i heard people say 'remove local!' for low sec.  CCP does and then people piss and moan about it being gone.
---
People say 'caps move too easily!'  CCP makes change sot this, and then people again piss and moan.
---
I have been hearing resources are an issue for years, and i am 90% sure if ccp tackles this, you all will whine again.
---
Its like 'Dad, my car is broken, cna you get it fixed?'
---
"Sure son!."
---
"NO WAIT NOT LIKE THAT! I DID NOT MEAN IT!"
---
*rolls his eyes*
---
it's a material cost with an isk value equivalency.
---
Who did they have on?
---
He doesn't know about the recons, does he ?
---
Like three of the other csm members all who thought things were in a very good place.
---
Guess that could be called as a part-time job anniversary
---
11 pilots in 30 days!
---
Not being able to see corpmates in local is the stupidest complaint about blackout. TF is corp chat for?
---
But muh sense of community.... yea, gtfo
---
11 pilots in the last 30, gratz on your corp development
---
lel i mean i doubt he knows much tbh if he's asking this sort of stuff on reddit
---
Ya im floating in space atm, is there a way to get it to asset safety from this point there no station I can dock to sell it for many jumps... and thank you for the advice, I too am researching all the new changes... pretty crazy
---
oh shit stainguy replied to my shitpost, someone gild this
---
&gt; Olmeca travels to a foreign country for free
---
As if Olmeca wasn't speaking out about Titan/Super profileration, especially as it relates to ratting, prior to going to Iceland. Sure thing bud. Might want to loosen that tin foil a little.
---
just because WoW is just as much a tedium shitfest doesnt mean EVE isnt either, or is becoming worse in that respect.
---
&gt; It's not "hard to obtain" is it you doofus.
---
Yeah it's not, that's his point.
---
But who?
---
Vily and exookie
---
Speaking from a smaller group, using a FAX(es) allows us to escalate an engagement against a numerically superior force. Doing such is not inherently risk free as we could get counter-escalated. Removing RR ability on capitals/supers severely limits this play and in my opinion, reinforces the concept of N+1. But to your point, sure, I won't bring my titan - pretty solid way to encourage active bodies playing.
---
right, so a lot of people who like low effort, easy kills will now not bother trying to do this anymore, win win
---
It's called 200 bombers.
---
But you were the one being facetious to begin with. Yes that faucet isn't truly infinite there is an upper limit players will never reach, except that applies to every isk faucet. So when you claim nullsec has infinite faucet the same claim can be made else where. Try to stay on topic.
---
Nullsec never asked for this but they would be fools to not take advantage of it.
---
As for dropping carriers on frigates, maybe stay out of their space if you don't want them to bring everything they have to fight you, why do they have to give you an even fight?
---
The Manatee*
---
That is two. You should learn to count.
---
Didn't expect to be so committed when I first started. Like 'get in front of comp in 5 mins'
---
Get another character in the alliance living there, then get the rorq character
---
But the big group can just as easily bring their own RR and then it becomes just a game of N+1.
---
um... ok?
---
It would be even sweeter if you actually fought a non industrial.
---
Classic goon fit
---
Lol the simple fact is that the players set the culture in this game and it has always been a goons directive to kill the culture. So are you part of the problem or the solution?
---
Rorqs are unkillable under the super cap umbrella if light a cyno and go invluln.
---
I kind of agree with this.
---
I feel your pain.
---
how do you know this?
---
Blocleaders hate him! here's why
---
granola bars are people food not keyboard food, refrain from feeding your keyboard
---
Sorry to hear. Hang in there! Make sure to take breaks when playing for longer times!
---
3L173 P33V33 P33
---
&gt;Yes that faucet isn't truly infinite
---
Thank you. How can you say the same about null? 
---
Rest my case.
---
You place way too much trust in CCP. If they first shed 25% to 30% of their player base, statistically speaking (having once worked in this industry), you can expect somewhere between 45% and 55% of those players to *never* come back, and the ones that do come back can take *years* to pull back, this will significantly reduce the ratters, not just in null sec, but everywhere. 
---
Then, of course, you have to trust that CCP somehow balances the game quickly such that it makes ratting in null sec worth the risk. Given CCPs track record on this (making good balance changes that properly balance risk and reward), I find this highly unlikely. In addition, you had better hope that this scaling back up of rewards does not force people into game play they do not want to engage in, because, again, statistically speaking, most people *will not* do things they do not want to engage in. Particularly, and this is important, if it does not check other boxes important to most MMO players, which include socialization, and optimized free time utilization. 
---
For example, if the average EVE player actively plays the game (i.e. is undocked, adjusting industry, market orders, etc.) is an hour and half, and you design a game play feature that boosts the rewards up to a 'worth it' level, but takes 2 hours to complete, people are *not,* as a general rule, not going to invest the extra time. They are going to move on to something else, whether that be going outside, building legos with their kids, or finding a new game to play. 
---
Then of course, there is the oh so important socialization aspect that *really* keeps people playing MMOs. Retention rates are *very strongly* correlated to quality social interactions in games. So... the more people you lose up front, the weaker long term (and new) players social networks are, and the more players you lose. You double down on this when you remove things like "mining in Rorquals with friends shooting the shit" because these are gameplay elements that feed the socialization aspect of MMOs. Finally, worth an honorable mention here, Mar5meca\_Gold, is that the removal of local in *well established* areas of the game that have had local for 16 years, also limits socialization. I.e. you no longer can see your friend Timmy, who you haven't talked to in months, come into local--importantly weather or not they are still blue to you, or have moved on. 
---
Last but not least, I find it *incredibly* unlikely that if the Chaos era changes stay as they are, that CCP can actually properly balance the rewards of null sec against the current risks period, even if you gave them 20 years. They will *have to* make changes, whether that is removing the blackout entirely, or adding constellation chat, or making local a real 'delayed' local (where people show up after say 2 minutes in system).
---
&gt;Everyone and their mother wants to move to a c2/n/5 to farm nullbears
---
&gt;It's been hectic.

[Source](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98487359/stats/)
---
Thanks. Not sure it sarcasm but that's a lot to us. And again, they all came back to the game because of the black out
---
yeah turns out electronics dont like crumbs. also fuck natures recipe oats and honey in particular.
---
It takes a fleet of 100 or more in expensive fit bombers to kill a capital null sec under the capital umbrella. I can kill ANY ship in high sec with a fleet of 50.
---
There's 2 reasons they nerfed combat refitting:
---
1. Machs hotswapping between ACs and arty, a thing we are still doing with them them just as mildly more inconvenience.
---
2. Active faxes would have been catastrophically OP (even more than they currently are) compared to old triage.
---
Those are the only actual examples of problematic things happening outside of some forum warrior's imagination. As someone who spent A LOT of time flying triage I'd be really curious to hear why you think it was OP/bullshit compared to now where some braindead noob can jump in his Minokawa and omni-tank 3x the DPS that was even remotely possible in an old faction fit Archon without having to worry about cap regen.
---
I literally did say that about null in the part you cut off. There is an upper limit to all of these players can't reach.
---
That's just our own summer slumber. 
---
But I see you avoided showing our recent recruitment due to the blackout. That's the whole point that counters all this nullbear narrative.
---
As I already stated, I never said that it perfectly balanced.
---
But right now you have bubble fucking and camping gates as the counter play
---
Even better
---
where did you read this?
---
&gt; That's just our own summer slumber.
---
hahahahahaha
---
No by fixing the game
---
So no rorqual has ever died in nullsec because they are guaranteed safety? You don't seem to grasp that neither do they have infinite guaranteed safety but the safety they do have requires other players to protect them.
---
where did you read this change?
---
anime was a mistake
---
HTFU when it's changes I like, but EVE IS DYING when they are changes I don't like.
---
Also delete the brackets, now you manually have to find the item in space
---
And in highsec you lose that fleet of 50 and in nullsec the fleet of 100 can escape.
---
The one that looks like an anime babe?
---
I dont Talk about blackout. Never cared much. The only thing about blackout was/is the feeling of lonelyness. Cyno changes on the other hand makes it almost impossible to save supers. I also never cared about smallgangs even tried to hunt them down. But there is pretty much nothing you can do against bomberfleets other then hoping they fuck Up big times.
---
Oof!
---
I guess I gotta ruin your whole career.
---
Sounds like you're the triggered one fam. 
---
An EVE player getting mad because he's wrong and got told to shut the fuck up but wants to argue about maturity on the internet. Go figure.
---
The truth is, I called you out and you took it personal because I nailed you perfectly. 
---
So yes, shut the fuck up, you whiny little bitch.
---
What are you going to do? Come and kill me under my umbrella? Try to fight me in real life? OH GOD SO FUCKING SCARY!
---
No, what you'll do is the same as every other no-name, no-life, EVE bitch does. You'll post your reddit threads about how everyone in the game has it too easy and beg CCP to make every one else's life more monotonous because you're trash and can't accept that everyone else knows better and plays better than you do.
---
Next please.
---
Yes please
---
Player numbers or character numbers?
---
I disagreed with you because it's more fair to say the blackout is one of the causes than it is to deny an impact. We just don't have enough, in a strictly literal sense, to say that is *the* cause.
---
Welcome back to the game! You should try to PvP instead. It's not only more fun but that's what the game is designed for, really.
---
yeah wanna push my style to be more realistic and away from anime, still learning
---
Story of ~~EVE~~ video games
---
Where exactly are you? Maybe me and my friends can help.
---
Do you have an alt available who can lite a cyno for you to move it out? Said alt has to be able to fly a recon ship.
---
If not you are boned. See who the locals are and see if you can sell the Rorq to them.
---
Plus the logistical nightmare that is the invasion tour.
---
Care to share any of them?
---
&gt;I am very confident with that stipulation. I won't go into a lengthy discussion with you if you want to question it.
---
CSM Member everyone!
---
It's your volunteer job to listen to players and report to CCP.
---
Second, you're kinda misguided there Olmeca. Sure, a part of the population ratted for wealth generation but quite a significant part used it as a means to an end. Usually to fund PvP or get in better ships to then PvP. So as soon as those people run out of the 'wealth' they were sitting on they'll stop doing PvP cause grinding ISK to afford a t2 cruiser takes so long it just isn't fun anymore.
---
Probably try to safe log it and create a new character to make your attempts to get it safed up.
---
How *dare* they host player events!
---
I think you don't understand your own question. There is no problem with the culture.
---
I am surprised you listened to TiS. I had to stop 5 minutes in after Matterall did absolutely zero prep on his first news piece (IA widotting into GSF) and then sat there and let the next guy prattle on about his insignificant mercenary group that is trying to relive their glory days like that 40 year old guy at the neighborhood block party that keeps trying to relive his high School Football days.
---
Do you have a time stamp on the pertinent conversation with the CSM members?
---
Too much work? Where did you get that idea from? No-where in my post did it say too much work. Ratting is boring as shit, hence aids, not too much work. Its easy, repetitive and boring as hell.
---
It wasn't an issue until alliances/coalitions grew to blobs of 20,000 and fleets of 1500
---
This
---
No no no, 3200s are balanced but fitting cap delays is unbalanced!
---
All that said, I think combat refitting would really just be another buff to the shak, especially ally in smaller scale fights. Shak fleets really obviate the need for large numbers of bhaals.
---
That's pretty gross to do in a professional office environment. Guess you are one of those sad fucks working in retail.

Multi account alphas

Then quit your bitching about other people's playstyle.

No rorq that lit a cyno.

That looks like he slinged his Titan into a bait and got rightly punoshed for it! AAR?
---
No. Capital content was actually fun. Cap escalations etc. Pinging max dreads. Titans supers.... Baiting out the big stuff..
---
Now it's just F1 online
---
who are you?
---
Hopefully people would be able to adapt, and go hunting for things like gatecamps and other roaming combat fleets? I do understand people tackling ratters to trigger a fight with a response fleet, though. And perhaps with fewer ratters, we might get more mission and DED runners?
---
Just because I advocate against combat refitting doesnt mean I am big fan of the current faxes.
---
Combat refitting had been OP for a long time: super blobs, slowcat fleets, auto/ arty mach fleets etc. 
---
Good riddance.
---
what?
---
Your redditposting is tiresome af
---
i would advise them to try something else: they could bait gankers. they could move to highsec. they could move to one of the regions in null that are much emptier and thus much less likely to get roamed in. 
---
like i said, theres lots of different options if it truly is such an issue and you arent lazy and entitled...
---
Thinking again probably not due to how large those capital modules are
---
If I did actually create an office environment to inspire creativity then Hilmar wouldn't have a job and you all would actually have a game. But then again, I dont get paid to out up with you retarded fucks. If I were paid I would have banned half of the degenerates on here for the luls.

Could this be a case of lets screw up this game so bad the Korean Owners want to sell it?

yeah I'm excited for the new Modern Warfare as well

TEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMM

I love me that game girl water. Really gets the immune system running.

What matters is that he is having fun, fuck everyone else.
---
The answer my dear is: Skinner-box
---
&gt;it's a mentality/culture issue
---
Hit the nail on the head. The problem is that it's now too easy to build a sand castle and too hard or too grindy to test one down. There's also no reason to fight over territory. There are systemic issues that CCP needs to address, but they first needed to turn off the isk faucet. Now that the isk faucet is off, the leeches who only wanted to rat and mine/build for isk are leaving. Granted, their play style is hugely nerfed because they no longer have near 100% safety, but null sec used to be more dangerous and unforgiving. Not many people now remember or were present in the time before anoms and farmable escalations. We've all gotten to comfy with making billions of isk an hour. Now that we can't, the ones who grew used to it are quitting. I can't blame them but for fucks sake don't make it out like the whole game is dead. There's still plenty to do, billions of isk to be made, ovp to be had, it's just not hand delivered and defeatable with titans and supers. 
---
It's also funny that you mention the pre mittsni goonswarm encounter, nowadays, goonswarm leader mittsni continuously said have two titans in the hangar. One shield, one armor. Deploy with armor keep the shield at home for defense. There is something fundamentally wrong if your whole goal is to have the most titans. 
---
Try having the most fun .
---
Dude, I was asking you where the heck is the next video several weeks ago. BOY did you deliver. 10/10 это просто заебись
---
Also editing made me lol irl twice
---
Dont bother. You are better off snubbing and coming back in a year if the game.is still here by then.
---
This so much. The way people talk about it on r/eve null sec should be brutally dangerous--read any old roaming group  should be able to catch whatever they see and get away 90% of the time--regardless of how much work, effort, and organization the sov holding organization has put into defending it. 
---
That has always been the thing to me with people yelling about null sec being 'too safe.' As if the game was not originally designed around fostering emergent player organizations whose purpose is to make the risk of anything proportional to the time and effort those emergent organizations put into mitigating risk. 
---
The attitude here seems to be that the sov holders need to put in 10,000x the effort into mitigating risk as the 'hunter' needs to put into inserting risk, and  ***even then*** the sov holders should not really have the ability to mitigate risk for their members at all.
---
If they are actively hunting you it makes it even easier to get fights. Setup bait, have tackle ready, and dunk them. Blackout works both ways. If you have sov you also have the ansiblex to get ahead of the enemy. Its all fairly basic stuff that any sov entity should be aware of.
---
I said 'plexes without rewards' if you wanna sit in one with 2 chars while day be my guest, but docking up sounds easier to me.
---
nope
---
So not literally all of nullsec, only very specific circumstances in very specific areas of nullsec have a chance of giving safety. And this means all of nullsec is safer than all of highsec.
---
I never intended my posts to be taken seriously, it was all of you who made the assumption I was being serious
---
Imma retrieve my drill, really quickly
---
Reporting from Imperium Discord to down-vote brigade this post.
---
&gt;Faucets were off the charts, space is made riskier, and now they are in check again.
---
Please, Olmeca. If you start talking at least know what you're talking about and don't directly contradict CCP. Rise said during his TIS interview that faucets have now dipped significantly, that was mostly due to the fighter and VNI nerfs and they were at a sustainable level. That was before the new MER came out. Ever since we've seen an even larger drop, which will get worse after the cyno changes.
---
SO HECTIC DUDE
---
I'm!!!!!!!
---
my intent was to turn ships into bodysuits for babes, hoping to make it less anime-ish but yeah lol
---
Yes. Which is why your free Intel has been taken away. And your instant reinforce cyno buttons. Despite the story being pushed on Reddit. It's not only GSF abusing the super umbrellas. All of the major alliances and coalitions are.
---
&gt;you no longer can see your friend Timmy, who you haven't talked to in months or years, come into local--importantly it does not matter whether or not that friend is still blue to you, or has moved on.
---
I do miss that.  Even just seeing familiar names was nice.
---
The problem with gate camps is that no hunters are slowed by them, they either come in through wormholes or bridged in via Covert cynos.
---
And attacking goon ratters expecting a response fleet is stupid, and complaining after the fact is insane. They will always bring as much force as to discourage you, it's just smart tactics. Anyone doing this is going after easy kills before goons respond or wants to cry about it. No one should be surprised by their response.
---
&gt; Why come back?
---
&gt; 
---
My guess here is that a lot of nullkrabs who stockpiled 1t+ in the glory days of rorqs are happy to shelve their mining gear for a few months and do something else, in Eve or otherwise, with the full expectation of coming back to a less-dangerous semi-blackout later on. "I'll just stop mining for a while until they introduce observatories", etc. 
---
Mainly these people would stay in game, or come back, because afk mining under a standing fleet isn't actually why they play Eve, it's just what they do for isk; so nerfing "their mining playstyle" isn't necessarily a dealbreaker.
---
That's why they introduced the proving grounds in the abyssal sites? I'm just saying I would like something like this, maybe others would as well. I would defnetly try to pvp more with something like this.
---
Has Incogo Galatea heard about the cyno changes?
---
Also being able to put search results like your home system into the neocom would be nice. Yes there's notepad but always having a spot where I can click or rt click -&gt; set destination would be nice instead of searching and waiting.
---
Even better if it is a Vanquisher, but my FC won't let me shoot blue.
---
&gt; It reduced the survival condition in nullsec to a single button for too many people. It was convenient for the people enjoying that, inconvenience for the people getting titanblobbed because of that. Objectively it was just bad game design to only expect the pushing of a single button for a super/titan/Rorqual and nothing else to survive in a space which is supposed to be risky.
---
Strange how it reducing the 'kill' and 'move freely through hostile space' conditions to a button for Hunters isn't a problem though.
---
So... option 1: Have 20 friends around them ready to warp in when bombers decloak to blap? On a scale of 1 to 10, how realistic is this to happen for more than 10 or 20 minutes? People just waiting for magical blap?  
---
Option 2: Leave null sec? So, ratting in null sec is done and over. That's a realistic solution to you?  
---
Option 3: Travel with your ratting ship 20 to 40 jumps, while not dying to gate camps or roamers, and then rat there until the index goes up and someone watching dotlan drops 20 bombers on you the next day.  Good news, it only took an hour to gate that far and you more than made up for it with an hour of ratting before dying. So... does that sound like a reasonable solution?  
---
You gave no realistic solutions. Those are cookie cutter, regurgitated answers that are not actually ones that can be employed with the surprise 20-200 bombers meta.  
---
You end your statement with insults and insinuations which don't help the cause.
---
youre whining about how difficult it is to travel deep into null with some alts after which you can move almost infinite volumes of stuff in a safe and time saving manner. if you want fun and excitement, why don't you try and do the same trips using nothing but gates? i'm serious about this - have you ever considered that logistics is so boring because its far too easy?
---
It blows my mind how people think player defense fleets are comparable to ccp sanctioned concord. Players out a crazy amount of effort into protecting their space but that doesn't matter to hunters they just want easy kills.
---
You seem confused. They don't happen but they did until recently and could for that matter happen again? Just the fact that PanFam thought it was a better idea to run and hide doesn't mean they had to. Or that Legacy/FRT can't have their own B-R/UALX/X47
---
Honestly the 5-10 roamers would outform a good number of groups outside umbrellas on a flashform. Even when i was in actively baiting groups in independent space youd see like 5 ready to go.
---
Yet here you are, smooth brain posting :)
---
Haha what about the PVP? Or are you a carebear in WoW as well
---
You fear 100 bombers when you see a stiletto ? 
---
Poor you angry man
---
So, which is it? Summer slumber or hectic? Cant be both.
---
Rise didn't say that. Folks in your echo chamber misinterpreted him and put him out of context. He later corrected people who made the same claims as you do about what he said. 
---
There were drastic reductions pre-blackout but most of it was about the war. He referred to the reductions but didn't talk about the war, which is a temporary situation. 
---
If blackout is taken back faucets will go back to unsustainable messed up levels. And that's just ISK. Mineral faucets are still messed up compared to destruction.
---
allot
---
But most of the ships in Eve look like penises.
---
Welcome back. Be forewarned you are about to receive a lot of "friendly" advice telling you that EVE is not a PVE game and you are wrong for wanting to do that and should feel very bad for even considering it.
---
I'm glad for the health of the game. These cyno changes were necessary.
---
Maybe they wanna die how eve dies
---
PVPers can't downvote if they are off playing wow classic
---
The Vulture?
---
&gt;And no, not being perfect in another language is not related to being stupid.
---
I never said it was related to being stupid, i said it makes you come off as stupid. If there is more to his argument I'm not seeing it.
---
Poor 40,000 man blob of shit tier players. Rest in piss.
---
So you don't want players to have any way to protect each other you only want shiny kills. You are exactly the people that are actually the problem with nullsec. You are a virus, you provide nothing to the game except for yourself. And when people want to defend from you, you cry to ccp that its to hard for you merry band of bombers to go assault a large fortress.
---
How many is "a bunch"? I doubt its enough to counter balance the massive amount of people quitting over this shit
---
This is brilliant. You’ve adapted. From my end this is good as the prices are directly affected by how many people do it as opposed to anoms in null. Loving trig prices these days keep farming the mats
---
goddang it i should have only started playing in 2020 now i have to suffer through gameplay from 2003
---
Gotta make WH's just have a time and not mass limit first.
---
Even better! He's going to have to take out his anger on someone and it won't be pretty when it happens!
---
It will just be the same after the blackout, quite some kills for the first week. Then people either adapt their umbrella or stop using caps. Then the hunters will leave because there is nothing to kill.
---
Just wait till they take on more ex-darkness and dilute the skill pool further.
---
no one said it counter balances anything, but that this is proof that people are indeed coming to eve BECAUSE of the blackout.
---
and we're just a small corp... this is happening across eve. Especially with wormhole corps.
---
haha good idea especially with fax and cap proliferation in general haha
---
Drink!
---
You are so insightful and clever, I'm sorry I'm on mobile. I'm not being a grammar Nazi, imho i think it's pretty fucking obvious where my criticism is based. His comment isn't even a coherent collection of ideas.
---
Worth
---
I agree.  Start with missions in hisec.
---
Nah, he wore the space suit, so he lost
---
take a closer look at our activity in the last two weeks. we literally just woke up and boom got a bunch of new recruits. got ops planned, got people enthusiastic, already arguing about which fits to use in null.
---
it's been great.
---
It's comments like yours that make the effort worthwhile &lt;3
---
is it a venture
---
Next change is splitting alignment and speed from warp mechanics, making the activation of it a separate stat.
---
Ps - anything that comes through the wh has criminal status as well.
---
Correct. And, I probably sound like an old man here, but for the first 11 or 12 years I played this game, I was a low-sec pirate in a small corporation. We enjoyed what we did ***because*** it is hard to catch, hold, and kill a human piloted ship. The harder it was for us to pull it off, the greater reward for us regardless of what dropped. 
---
Sometime in the last 5 years, just judging by r/eve, there has been a sea change in this attitude; and people who 'make a living' in this game off of non-consensual pvp now expect it to be super easy. In all honesty, *that* kind of pvp has more in common with arena pvp games, which don't get me wrong, I enjoy sometimes, but completely defeats what I used to get out of pvp in this game.
---
There is a difference from protecting and having instant access to the battlefield, without having to use any of the travel mechanics in game except for jump or light cyno. Because of the instant and precise proliferation of a capital response any form of counterplay is nullified. No matter how perfectly played. The reason bombers HAVE TO BE USED, is because it's impossible to move anything else under the super cap umbrella. It takes one well places bubble and one Titan to kill a fleet of up to 250 people.
---
Oof. Not worth
---
People still talking about hunter risk misunderstand the risk/reward. Hunters do not generate ISK or minerals, mess up the economy. Game doesn't have to maintain a minimal risk for them. 
---
Besides, being on the offense as an alliance or group is not a strong option. All relevant groups we have today are defensive turtling groups. So you're complaining about a playstyle which is already pretty weak in the overall meta. You can defend against hunters easily with enough people. And if you don't have enough people, perhaps your ratting ship should die anyway.
---
Rofl!
---
So we should give the hunters some elite battleground to go pvp in and leave alone the krabs who dont want to be inconvienced by pvp?
---
Boi, this is nullsec. The whole point is that when you live out here you should be ready to fight at any time.
---
If you wanna just relax and play a pve spaceship game by yourself, fuckoff to  elite dangerous or something
---
It's not the best.
---
Ham legions are still okay, but they are beaten by Tengus and Loki's.
---
This ia basically what I'm advocating. It will balance the playing field
---
Not true for delve there is always content. Hunters have had non stop content party since blackout. When your region has 50k people...
---
can't, i'm all foiled up, punching the keyboard with nose
---
The other problem was supers and titans hit swapping between dps and tank. And when swapping tsnk, having a shield fit for when you're in shields, having an armor for for armor and hull fit for hull. It meant that killing one could be three times as hard as normal. That was the other use case they wanted to stop
---
look again - last two weeks.
---
but that's not the point anyways - this started with another nullbear saying he doesn't see RECRUITMENT happening in all these corps claiming that people are returning DUE to the black out.
---
and that's exactly what's happening - so instead another nullbear decides to change the narrative and looks up activity - NOT EVEN over the last two weeks but cherry picks summer data to show a slope.
---
*shrug*
---
So what you really want is for hunting groups to come to your space in brawly-battleships and then your group will just bring equal numbers of the same ships? Obviously fit exactly the same? So everyone have a splashing good time?
---
Criminal? Not suspect?
---
I mean, you’re welcome to come test out your ideas.
---
Christ, can you imagine running that shit with a pug?

Why are you thinking about PVE? Carebear detected.

I remember that Reddit post. It was immediately followed by the Frat is blue again Reddit post a couple hours later.
---
I agree frigates aren’t used nearly enough.
---
Frigates online is needed
---
Yep! I mean, if you are lighting a cyno in empire space you are a criminal against the empire!
---
Personally I don't think drag bubbles should be a thing, but thats a whole other conversation.
---
Tbh, anyone who thinks they know all the ways people will learn to use cynos in this new meta is being foolish. I've been involved in enough emergent game play moments to know that there's always someone looking for new and creative ways to use game mechanics. Rather than announcing that this is going to ruin everything, you should be looking for the best way to use it...before someone else does.
---
w..w...w.what..?
---
To use? Sure they do now kind of. To move in any sense? Eh, that might be asking a bit
---
&gt;allot
---
a lot, you idiot :P
---
They should barely be able to move at all.
---
Then there won't be hunters.
---
Meaning people can go back out and rat.
---
Hm you're right I forgot this part of scanning which is kinda annoying too. I usually click on the overview
---
\+18000 - updoot incoming
---
Haha welcome to hell then. Your better off self destructing it and then throw in the towel.
---
yuck toxicity alert.. talk about self fulfilling prophecy. I get it, game sucks for you but it doesn't for other. Don't let that bother you on the way out, thank you.
---
youre autistic and retarded, incase you didnt know that already
---
This is because the bar is a linear representation of a non-linesr progression.
---
who cares?
---
And when people don't stop using bombers with the cyno change what will the excuse be then? Cynos arent a new thing.
---
We can't ruin your game if you all quit.
---
I know that Signal Cartel does find lost ships in WH space and scouts them out. Might want to try contacting them, they might be willing to expand their business model to help move trapped capitals in null sec.
---
Look at Mr. Moneybags over here. I used rookie ships.
---
This is amazing, would love to see more ships shown in this way!
---
Come to Providence, we're so good we can't tell caps and supers apart. :P
---
Same tbh
---
Why my Venture look funny???
---
I suspect Frat are paying for the standings to go back up?
---
Blackout has been a constant suggestion since 2011
---
The fact that you are saying that to a dude with his flair.. a group known for literally making a certain part of space a danger zone to cross and always dropping or engaging someone... dude. Get a clue.
---
Oh wow a goon rorq. Sick
---
I'm flattered you think I could be part of an echo chamber. 
---
Re Rise: If he did, I honestly didn't see/read/hear that so if you could refer me to that I'll stand corrected.  
---
And you still seem to have in your head I (or anyone else for that matter) would want to go back to before Blackout. As I've said in many comments before, I'm ok with Blackout. I don't speak for everyone though and many people have apparently picked up and left. I'm also fully on-board with the fact Eve should change to make the game more resilient towards the future.
---
However instead of evaluating the effect of the Blackout for a bit longer and seeing what that would do to null sec/the game, CCP apparently decided to kick people when they feel down. I'd say that's indeed a good way to lose players.
---
To be fair, most EvE players have better phones than gaming PCs. Admit it. You have a Galaxy Note 10 or iPhone X99 and you play on a potato with no sound and no graphics.
---
No krabs to hunt if everyone is back in HS...
---
I love circular reasoning...
---
Pretty much. Might have been thinking of the later undocks that didn't happen
---
Super capital proliferation is. Titans were designed with the idea that there would only ever be a few in the entire game. And why are you hung up on bombers specifically?  There is currently no counter play to supers jumping cyno to cyno blapping attack fleets.
---
&gt; Would it shock you to know less ships are dying in nullsec after these changes. 
---
Citation would be welcome
---
Why ?
---
Yes, krabs have an incentive to deny fights. If pvpers can come to your space and have fun, then you wont get to spend much time farming.
---
But that doesnt mean the mechanics of the game should make it possible for a defender to deny pvp content while still runnig thier krabbing activity with impunity
---
The argument is that in order to sucessfully farm, the defender should have to engage the hunters on a more equal playing field. The cost for making making money in nullsec should be providing goodfites for pvpers
---
so.... fight each other more instead of complaining that nullbears can't rat.
---
that site led to some pretty epic scam haul threads
---
oh sorry, i hadn't heard of these "badasses".
---
LMAO
---
I think it's just an addiction.
---
Honestly, the game isn't fun. It's just a game. It's fine, I guess.
---
Penif alt
---
I would like to eventually do some PVP, but it feels like I've nearly forgotten everything about this game, and I wanted something to ease myself back into it, so I can get use to just playing the game again and how combat works etc...
---
2019? you're about 5 years too late champ.
---
&gt; And when swapping tsnk, having a shield fit for when you're in shields, having an armor for for armor and hull fit for hull. It meant that killing one could be three times as hard as normal. That was the other use case they wanted to stop
---
This only exists in your head. No one ever did this because it wasn't worth the effort. You also didn't get "3x the hp" by using invulns and bulkheads on supers lol.
---
like eve
---
What would be the purpose of that?
---
Yeah, they need to rebalance shit so defender cant just dunk on anything that comes in thier space. But there should also be something that forces the attacker to commit as well.
---

Because it's Olmeca Gold and there's tons of idiot peons that don't want to or can't think for themselves
---
Is it a good game?
---
I'm not trying to discourage you from learning English, its a hard language. I just don't think it's a great idea to insult a group of people in a language you are still learning. TBH, I'm not even sure what your point of view is. lol
---
if only ccp legalized ranch........
---
Because the bombers prove how much of a hypocrite players like you are. Congrats you cried hard enough and now there is no instant free Titan response. But you never wanted fights so you will keep using bombers because they have no counter. That's the point. And as you gleefully abuse them, you will cry the moment people find a way to defend against them. Just admit you are a coward.
---
Like before,smaller alliances always where joining coalitions in wars and helping them win, they would get part of space to rise and develope,as 0.0 space have huge amount of empty systems ,atm we dont have enough people to populate amount of sov we have,any new alliance could get part of space easy by helping in war...but guess what...there is no war
---
just do stuff and read stuff
---
Crime status for JF pilot that is
---
Think about c3 wh, legion and Scorch M
---
The mer has a kill dump of all kills. I don't have the number in front of me at the moment but will gather as soon as possible.
---
It's been the excuse of not wanting the changes recently. 
---
Null bloc member #45,131 "these exchanges only serve to hurt the small alliances, they shouldn't be implemented. It's not going to change null blocs at all"
---
Byebyeeeeeee good riddancs
---
Why would people go back to somewhere that has more risk but less reward than highsec?
---
Its easy to sit back and say it could be worse or harder from the outside but i simply wouldnt play or do that if it was. When ccp was about to make jf 5 ly i was about to logout for good. Logistics already require a stupid fucking amount of accounts to run effieciently and properly. There are more than enough ways to catch jf's. I just for some reason never see people doing it. The most dangerous part right now is those 4 gates to jita due to ganking. Im not going to list how vulnerable jfs can be due to proffesional curtesy to other logi pilots but its there. Come back and talk to me when youv had to move 500+ bs hulls in under 24 h at least 3 jumps from jita.
---
make sense! But don't get too in to it.. it can suck you in and make you forget that pvp is the point of the game - it's a LOT more fun.

Killing the VNI, tackling the Orthrus and then killing the jammer as the Orthrus fled was savage. :)
---
Disagree, a hunter is looking for anomalies which are generally in all systems anyway. The sig browser allows nullsec bears to see wormholes without having to actually watch every system.
---
Welcome back! People are a little salty, as you can see - local is gone in nullsec and a substantial part of the playerbase that doesn't like to targeted by anything other than rats is in a tiff about it.  But, there's still plenty of PVE to do - and it's at least as valuable as ever, since some of our more risk-averse players are staying docked. While risk in null is way up for ratters in green anomalies, the risk for running DED sites and escalations isn't meaningfully higher than it used to be - especially in a ship designed for excursions like the Legion.
---
There was a T3C rebalance a few years back, so you likely will need to go to Jita to bring your ship into line with the current subsystem / fitting rules. The HAM Legion works all right - it has selectable damage - and the laser Legion can be even better for EM/Therm weak rats or if you are doing wormhole C1-C3 sites (though C3s may require a bit of bling to keep your tank up). 
---
Perhaps practice in highsec for a bit to get re-familiarized with dscan and other game mechanics. Once your sea legs are back, if you head out, keep your fit as cheap as you can and still have it function well, be cautious, keep an eye out for combat probes (and maybe stick to scannable sites when in null), and you'll be fine. If you can handle the sites you plan on running in a cloaky fit and don't need to drop a depot to refit, even better.
---
The new abyssal sites - instanced PVE arenas - can be pretty fun and challenging, too, but T3Cs aren't allowed in those. You can read up on optimal fits for each of the five levels and different flavors of abyssal sites elsewhere, including [/r/fittings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fittings/).
---
I beat the game years ago, but have been seeing lots of chatter as I scroll through reddit. What's going on?

doesn't make a difference if there is rewards or not, you're still denying plexing for the other side. Unless you mean its just a gated deadspace pocket without any fw relation, and at that point why even call it a plex
---
Remember when you actually had to kick an alliance's ass for them to cascade?
---
absolutely but fax need a serious overhaul first
---
... Test Ur shit posts are bad and you should feel bad
---
The salt is real.
---
I didn't say it wasn't? I simply said I find it interesting that while "needless tedium" is being celebrated in one game, by a lot of gamers, other games/gamers still find that tedium to be stupid/unneeded.
---
That's one of the reasons I think the Abyssal stuff has been a hit for PvE becuase it's at least slightly less mindless than anomaly running.
---
Learning how to super rat and not lose fighters while still getting good ticks was a lot more fun than grinding out the sites after you learned all that. Id go as far as saying i enjoyed the challenge. At one point before i got the nack i thought it was all RNG and bob would decide today this fighter dies. I thought i tried everything but always would lose a fighter here or there. To be honest I managed to trick the rats into shooting the super instead most of the time by not running any shield hardeners. The rats would see the low resists and not account for the shield HP and decide to shoot the super instead of the fighters. Ironically the safest way to run the sites was dropping the supers tank.
---
I'm in no way confused. Legacy/FRT wont have it because Legacy wont risk PanFam joining it without Goons being there, and FRT/PanFam wont do it if Goons are there.
---
Until the blocs meaningfully break up, those fights are not going to keep happening.
---
If you are talking about soloing invasion stuff
---
A marauder
---
which means more or less 5-6k people, 2-3k active players
---
tell me where on the raven where the null sec crabs touched you
---
oh noes, a couple hundred million every month to be able to warp a giant supercapital fleet to your doorstep.

BubbleBobble69 "I'm here to bubble the gate... and I'm all out of bubbles!" A quote from the EVE Online movie "Back to the Gatecamp".
---
They're going to nerf stealth bombers, to make sure that all players are equally miserable.
---
So proud of yourself you actually put it in your bio?
---
I mean, it's not. The huge blocs have already made their changes. Small alliances won't have the coordination or the bulk of pvp players needed for these defenses. How these changes are supposed to help small alliances is still a question I haven't seen answered yet.
---
Just delete FAX and bring back the triage carrier
---
I think it was Falcon who recently wanted to do that when he explained all his view points in the reddit post. :P 
---
Too bad he's only a community manager
---
I'm not the one who cried so hard they got ccp to kill their own game.
---
Rage quit again
---
Good luck with convincing CCP of your opinion.
---
You blew my mind, with your identification of which demographic 'cant stomach challenge'. The whole point is that people infinitely huddling up to make things easier stagnates the game into a WoW PVE server of nothingness.
---
I can agree with that. The PANIC is an important tool for forcing fights.
---
&gt; How these changes are supposed to help small alliances is still a question I haven't seen answered yet.
---
Are they supposed to?  I don't recall that being one of CCP's stated goals.
---
I enjoy combat refitting in PVE and it adds a level to PVP too. (Not just for caps, it should be available for subcaps too if you have a depot or Nestor around.)
---
However, you have to look at the reasons it was taken away. Being able to switch modules during a fight takes away the tradeoffs regarding fitting, particularly for larger ships. Do I fit for DPS, or tank? Well, if you can combat refit, you can fit for DPS until you get targeted and then swap the tank in. Could you do ridiculous things like refitting a different ADC or CHE and getting the bonus again? Or fitting a different ancillary shield booster to overlap reloads but only sacrifice the slot for 1 minute? Or what about carrying both long and short range, or anti-cap and HAW, weapons and being able to switch for different targets?
---
And of course we'd need a huge FAX nerf - even bigger than the one we need anyway - to make this sensible.
---
I can't work out why EM Ward Field I is more expensive than Limited Anointed EM Ward Field. The latter is much easier to fit. Any help appreciated as it's about the only thing in Eve I have been unable to find on google.
---
LOL XD
---
Small alliances that didn't confirm to the super cap weapons race and instead focused on just finding content aren't as affected as the ones who tried to conform to the meta
---
That is so insane I don't believe it to be true. If they were going to do that they'd do it with some of the low value items to bump their value.
---
Sov has NEVER EVER IN THE HISTORY OF EVE been "enjoyable". 
---
It's gone from: 
---
- tower spam to 
---
- hit point grind to

- windowed Hitpoint grind to 
---
- "actually having some sembelence of tactical warfare
---
- back to windowed Hitpoint grind. 
---
No in disagreement with you. Just rose-colored glasses maybe, but it has always smelt and tasted of turd buffet
---
1) The faucets were trending down already. The blackout was not wholly responsible for the faucets getting fixed. Rise confirmed that in our interview with him a few weeks ago.
---
2) I am fine with changing local - regional local would be fine by me. But it’s clear that the blackout is having negative impacts and isn’t a sustainable long-term solution to the faucets. 
---
3) I didn’t say you were, but again, I think this entire area of content is going to totally dry up and that’s not a good thing. 
---
4) In the long run, we’re all dead. 
---
And it was never as easy as “push a button” and then win. You guys wouldn’t have been in business if that’s all it took.
---
The fact is that these changes are having an affect. It's causing a lot of people to jot log in, but for those that are logging in, space is more dangerous. 
---
There has already been a Titan killed, in part, due to the cyno changess
---
So apparently you can blops bridge to an industrial cyno. Is that intended?
---
How are you still salty after all these years lol... Never change dude!!
---
Yeah, it's a shame... all i wanted to do is give him a good kick up the ass so he leaves with disgrace and not a fat paycheck for all that he has done/not done...
---
Ulta-safe meaning 90% chance of getting saved if you're able to light a cyno and speak-up in comms or whatever channel your alliance has for "ZOMG Tackled" messages.
---
zkill is being a bitch right now, but see any cap drop on solo/small gang frigates. not just on me but on pretty much anyone.
---
karma is a bitch!
---
Yeah, I know... CCP seems to want to make the more tiresome aspects of this game even more cancerous.  
---
But hey, not like login numbers have tanked...
---
RemindMe! 3 days
---
{when stainguy unironically posts that the cyno changes were good for small players}
---
lol the propaganda is amazing here. 
---
frat losing all their space = this isn't happening
---
frat 99% botters = yet somehow elo been slapping around test fleet left right and centre
---
frat can't defend shit = yet test call in goons for everything and still lose objectives
---
too bad propaganda doesn't win you fights.
---
let's not forget the random keepstar they put in the wrong system. talk about needed morale.
---
This will be downvoted cause dreddit.
---
&gt; we have the resources to just add recons to ship replacement and not blink
---
Really that just shows that the game is fundamentally broken and will remain so unless CCP manages to address not only the production of more wealth, but goes after accumulated wealth. Goons have so much ISK that they can just spend their way out of any balance change.
---
I hope this "a way to find cloaked ships in space" materializes as I've been maxed out on scanning for years and always wanted this as a career. 
---
If CCP does this I'm going to app for some null sec group as I'll have something fun and a little dangerous to be doing once more :-)
---
The art is frickin’ great, not sure about the relevance to EVE, but it’s great art.
---
Worked on my iphone 8 after a few download attempts. I also have gotten a little annoyed with the slots not being able to be equipped with more than one weapon (at least on my measley frigate), it shows I should be able to have 2 weapons in the slots but it gives me an error I can't quite read at the top of the screen. That needs to be fixed as well.
---
Fake and gay.
---
Sell and contract items from containers
---
depends the area you live , cand get into that alliance, can jump out but with eyes everywhere is a bit risky  and can try to contact your friends  and ask them for help moving it out use a cloack module and get fuel extra in case
---
hope everything going fine with  that  fly safe mate
---
Thank you, glad you liked it! I have few ideas for the next one. :)
---
Yup you're completely right. Crypto tanking a year prior is what caused the late18/early19 market correction. It totally wasn't fear of a [government shutdown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_United_States_federal_government_shutdown?wprov=sfla1) amid a trade war. Nope, it was totally caused because of Bitcoin. Our entire economy revolves around Bitcoin. That's why Johnson and Johnson lost stock value too. They were just so affected by Bitcoin and Nvidia.
---
I've heard less stupid shit in r/WallStreetBets
---
Olmeca man bad, he bad because alliance leadership men tell me, vaccine cause autism man tell me on facebook.
---
With how the rorq is setup it needs panic to live against anything of note
---
You'd need a 2kkk Moa.
---
This too!
---
I’m for balance on both ends
---
but, No to this.  Rorqs are strong and versatile, them using regular cynos is a good trade off
---
It's completely non interactive with anyone. I'm semi-afk in space protected by Concord in my own little instance and nobody can really do anything to me. Wardeccers never leave the immediate Jita area.
---
smartbomb it on gate ;-)
---
Hello people playing classic wow instead
---
When it's too convenient to move ships around it becomes a problem for other playstyles which require defensive response times to be non zero, or require people to move around in ways that are possible to intercept.
---
It would be really convenient if I didn't even have to undock and shoot red squares, if I could just print ISK from a button next to 'Undock' instead. I assume you can see why that would be a bad game design decision.
---
Being able to cyno capitals around, at least as cheaply and easily as before this change, is bad for exactly the same reason as that button.
---
Tuzzy is just reporting numbers.
---
This is true, but your solution continues to kneecap smaller people and force the big three to get bigger.
---
By the moment you asked me I had only the first part ready, but was doubting whether I should upload it or not. It felt like there just wasnt enough content in the video by that time. And I didn't know how to continue the video further from the point it was ending on. Had an almost 2 week break thinking of how to continue the video.
---
Titans are killed all the time. The idiots who don't read patch notes NEED to die asap. The idiots who don't get in standing fleets NEED to die asap. Hopefully the losses will be enough to force them out of the game. 
---
Me and a few guys had to go save this guy last night that had every one of his alts in orcas mining an r64. Got tackled by a wormhole group, and only logged Into TS to say he was tackled
---
He had ZERO cynos fitted across 4 ships. Luckily I had a cov ops frig a couple jumps away probing, so I was able to bridge a falcon cyno over to open a real cyno to get caps in to save his sorry ass. If it weren't for killboard stats I wouldnt have bothered even though it was entertaining how quickly the elite pvp microgangers bailed when supers showed up.
---
Anyone wanna talk about risk averse?
---
/u/chribba would be so proud to see this great impression of his Veldnought. =)

I really like the music on this, what is it?

tbf bomber fleets have to anchor so they can get booshed. But yeah, you're right. F1 Online
---
You say that like its reasonable for a group with both capital mining ships and a cap umbrella to save them to keep even one cyno fit recon cruiser in system.
---
No, it doesn't need to be said. Stop being a pussy.
---
That's a lie. People have confirmed the low numbers correlate directly to the end of botting.
---
The end.

This is a track from Noir but I'd have to look up the actual track name  
---
I'm glad you like! I like to use techno etc for my vids personally, not a big fan of dubstep
---
Maybe make changes that cripple the blob 😑
---
It Was my favorite part of the goon forums when I was in CFC
---
Does it?
---
I saw an isk value of the kills. Which was fairly stable.
---
yup, but you are speaking to the guys which never toast anything... they do not know how null is fucked with fozzie sov and citadel spam atm.. iam so missing dreads sieging poses or so.... :-(
---
This is because they're fucking 50% of the player base to cater to r/eve. this is beyond pointless and just frustrating. Removing local didn't work. Removing cyno's won't work. All it does is annoy everyone. If they remove krabbing next........ which they've done in terms of raw isk coming into the game already, it will fuck this game.   
---
All of these changes are just annoying people into unsubbing. They don't change the underlying issues.   
---
Resources might I'll grant you, but you'd have to do it in such a way that it motivated a massive war which I doubt they will.
---
&gt; That's a dangerous thought process of saying "my fun is more important than theirs" in an mmo that needs people in it.
---
And yet that's *exactly what nullblobbers have been saying for the last 3 years* as changes favouring them came release after release.
---
Yes, the game should be fun for various playstyles. Until the recent changes the balance was way too far in the direction of safe ISK printing and capital blobbing.
---
Because it's easier, and still has more isk.
---
But after some recommended changes, will likely be even better.
---
This is the worst thing I've seen all day . 🤮
---
FYI check out ExookiZ's podcast. You'll find that wormholers (yes, the same wormholers that are cheering for the blackout and the cyno changes) want nerfs to w-space ratting safety.
---
Ships.
---
Combat would be a lot more balanced without them.
---
sad i didnt get the orthrus :pepecry:  
---
Orthruses are actually one of the easiest targets since they never fit a web and thus can't apply their damage.
---
pvp in vanilla was absolute garbage. that was before resilience where you just got some t2 gear and steamrolled everyone becasue balance wasn't a thing.
---
Next up is citadel restrictions per system.
---
Hunter now with no local can sit cloaked and watch which systems anoms are being run so they know exactly where to warp when they jump in.  
---
Faith point on wormholes so id say an even buff between hunter/krab
---
I've noticed roaming gangs of trigs in non invasion systems too, led by Zorya's rats.
---
We all know they matter.
---
They matter so much.
---
Logged in or accounts.. If you actually knew the math behind how many accounts people run on AVG and then multiply that over all timezones.. Stop looking at the individual numbers.
---
Your narrow minded behaviour is just ridiculous. Start researching this topic and look at the hundreds of threads and conclusions people have come to. Many people have spent years working this shit out... FML
---
&gt; When it's too convenient to move ships around it becomes a problem for other playstyles which require defensive response times to be non zero, or require people to move around in ways that are possible to intercept.
---
or you could bring an attacking force equal to the response force.

Weird flex but okay. Have my upvote.

---
Looking at the activity levels, it's safe to say you are talking right out your ass bud.
---
Wow , this is such great feedback and idea’s.  You are an asset to this community.  Thank you
---
Actually if you include avg accounts to a real person and weigh each timezone, you would know that it comes close to 50% of the playerbase is not logging in (waiting on pings) or gone completely.. 
---
But you just made an assumption based on a small amount of data, which is why you thread got down voted and your comments. 
---
Come back when you are going to sit at the table like a  grownup and at least listen to others telling you that you "might be wrong"..
---
So far so good for us small gang pvpers. They can't drop caps on frigates as easily anymore
---
We will have to wait until they emerge.

Thank you for the awesome feedback and constructive ideas.  The EVE community is better because of you

Battle rorqs in 3, 2, 1 ...

people do not risk t1 ships because 21m ISK /hr with 7m tiks with myrms are just loose of time. its worth just for bots

You know what, I think you're right. About the unpopular opinion part, that's all.

No CCP is working to accelerate the demise of the shit stagnant turbo blobs. Which you are likely a part of. So that's why you are scared. 😑
---
Hahah
---
The last three years has seen three times the number of nerfs to pve related ships, blob related ships and so on in relation to pvp centric ships. One side or the other gets to swallow nerfs, does not make it good for one side or the other to think they should be the only ones to play.  I don't disagree with isk printing, however going a direction that basically makes null a wasteland and encourages thousands of high sec incursion runners to make similar money in safety is a little silly.
---
This is what the moths say as they fly into the zapper.... 
---
“Ooooohhhh soooo pretty....”
---
So how do you nerf WH ratting exactly?  
---
They are already the strongest NPCs in the game(barring diamond rats?) with the highest resist profiles and most ewar(tackle+webs at least), with no static gates to camp(yes you scan your hole and sit on it but a new hole can pop in your system whenever), there’s already no local, you can’t cyno in backup, and there’s no bounties so there’s always the risk of losing all that juicy blue loot on your way to market.  
---
I’d like to know some honest suggestions for making w-space ratting more dangerous. Whatever mechanics you implement, Eve players are going to learn them to a T and then find a way to maximize income.
---
Good they should get fucked more. Until they all pick a side and let's get the final battle started
---
maybe even give citadels jumping capabilities
---
What the hell are cyno!? (newbie eve here) I was trying to find some direct info in the web but still don't really get it.. oh, i"m playing with alpha account.. newbie as I mentioned above.
---
You can use neocom II for this
---
Lol ratting in a super. What a cancer inducing waste of someone finite life.
---
when a couple of throw away bombers are worth a super, hit me up, i'll gladly buy your super for &lt;3bn.
---
&gt; 1) The faucets were trending down already. The blackout was not wholly responsible for the faucets getting fixed. Rise confirmed that in our interview with him a few weeks ago.
---
This is pure misrepresentation. You guys misintepreted him a lot during and after the interview. And he even tried to correct it later when people put these words in his mouth. All he wanted to say is that faucet reduction in null was a trend since January where they hit a 80t record. Several nerfs, discouragement and farming fatigue took it to 55t in May. And the war took it to 46t in June (these are my own nullsec-only aggregates of the MER).
---
Nullsec still had 55t peacetime ISK generation potential until the blackout. It was blackout which took it to 25t in July and 15t in August, giving us a real faucet deficit in years. Without the blackout faucets were still unsustainable.
---
&gt; 2) I am fine with changing local - regional local would be fine by me. But it’s clear that the blackout is having negative impacts and isn’t a sustainable long-term solution to the faucets.
---
I agree. And I'd be fine with a bit more middleground implementations of local. 
---
&gt; And it was never as easy as “push a button” and then win. You guys wouldn’t have been in business if that’s all it took.
---
It was a push to win requirement. People were still dying because some people failed to push the button. For a couple of months we decided to afk camp an entire region to preinhib people, which was an unsustainable and insanely inaccessible method of hunting. That method brought us 2 titan kills under the umbrella. Other than that all other boson ratting titans survived with just one button. I wonder how much ISK they generated.

No it wasn't. Asset non-destruction was a thing, but you lost access to it, and the assets weren't magically teleported across the cluster if the structure was lost.
---
By destroying the playerbase? Seems legit my friend.
---
&gt; using a FAX(es) allows us to escalate an engagement against a numerically superior force

Except when they bring 2 FAXes.
---
omg did you ever try other side? nothing is more boring than trying have bait ships in system for hours and not knowing that there is even fu hunter...
---
:) thank you
---
If only small groups would come to nullsec and take sov for themselves, while paying a modest rental fee.
---
Content reduction complete. PVPers complaining in t-minus 47 hours
---
the wingy bits look like an Osprey or Basilisk. the color is odd though
---
Except that the combat timer limit does nothing to fix those problems. Supers are either DD'ed off the field before they can refit, or they take much longer than a minute to kill, in which case not firing your guns for a full minute to allow a refit is no hindrance.
---
Slowcats also abused it
---
So fight a mobile war.
---
Wait what? You actually expect functional UI additions? It took almost 11 years to add the “loot all” button!
---
Yes, the player count is going down. That happens all the time in a lot of games. The numbers will go up eventually, however not to the same level. Why? During their latest update brought no new and inviting content for the new players, which would supposedly attract more players. The new bots were very hard to beat so they had distanced away players that had recently joined the game. The update had also targeted some major corporations that majorly relied on botting, leading to a major decrease in the amount of the accounts that would bot mine, leading to the major falldown of some of the major and secondary alliances.
---
This update would have an effect on the aspiring new players that would go on to actually fight the Incursion Epidemic, bringing fun experience with a new future to said players. Older players would of course be sent away, rejected by the new ways.
---
The problem is that before there was no major influx of new players that would keep the game going, and CCP actually gave the existing newbies a slight kick with the hard triglavian AI.
---
Which is clearly not possible for playstyles other than being part of a huge blob. Do you think that only being part of a huge blob should be a valid playstyle?
---
Oof, didn't know you were so mad. Well, sorry for your experience I guess
---
If you want super umbrella, the counter to all the changes is pre positioning the cyno widow and it's accompanying minnows.
---
Rorquals online lives strong
---
We haven't been deployed or being invaded for the last 2 month... so no shit killboard been a bit lazy
---
Not for my Android phone
---
It is infact possible to kill fighters. You even get killmails for a whole squad killed. It also makes super pilots salty.
---
So.... buy another phone? Then you will be able to see all this sweety isk transaction
---
Hunting after blackout is not perfectly safe. Krabbing with local (and a friendly Upwell structure in system) is perfectly safe if you're even vaguely paying attention. This is just another null saltpost.
---
There may be some valid arguments to be made about the power of blops drops which are quite low risk at the moment, but you still have to extract that bomber fleet, and you can't take gates cloaked.
---
Doesn't always work.

Plex isn't included as part of the CPI because it's fundamentally different, since the supply of plex is not really affected by in game player activity. CPI is "daily goods" like T1 ships, T2 ships, modules, implants, ammo, drones, and ice.

Holy fuck dude, you're a textbook example of a spodbrain
---
I've actually been talking quite a bit about the blackout with people on both sides of the fence.
---
Personally I like it for hunting purposes being pirate and all, but I can see the argument for there being no counterplay to have the same level of intelligence that's been in the game for the last sixteen years.
---
It's a super polarizing change for sure, and I do believe there needs to be an intelligence system in place, just not one that's as black and white as literally listing everyone in the system in a chat channel.
---
As with everything in EVE, you should have to work a little for your intel. Not being able to do so right now isn't optimal - I agree with that. Needs to be a middle ground.
---
Of course, anyone who disagrees with the blackout simply takes this as me frothing at the mouth and hating anyone who mines or does PvE.
---
:rollyeyes:
---
Can really imagine how would everyone react against real chaos if they can't even handle cyno and local changes
---
Yup. This adds skill in having to save your own ship. Granted a spool up cyno mechanic would have been more ideal, however, as that doesn't require a second character or skills to ghost ride your cap and light cyno.
---
Your small Corp got a boost of about 15 accounts it looks at the beginning of blackout, but than a sharp decrease back to previous levels and than another sharp increase in the past couple weeks about the same, but showing a trend of another decline. I'd say all those accounts amount to maybe 4 or 5 real people? Not exactly numbers to knock anyone socks off.

ok.

don't believe that, there are correctly spelled words and sentences that make sense - I don't see any Mar5hy blowjobs or fanboy praise in the post history either and we all know Penif wants to be mar5hy

a ton of titans stayed and doomsdayed moloks and stuff, who gives a fuck, who is gonna drop us here, they are on the undock of the 1dq keepstar, doesnt get safer if youre in a fleet already...

uh, how is classic wow new?
---
it's the very opposite.

Why wont others play how i want them too??? CCP PLEASE NERF

Yeah why should 50,000 people working together beable to police their area of space that's just insane. Fucking moron

Do you take commissions? If so, I'd like to commission a couple of pieces for my character.

As opposed to now where they can jump to any cyno.

I’m referring to you not being a fan of all the new stuff.
---
Yes, am retarded and didn't notice the little extra thingies.
---
You can just say you want custom anime porn, we're going to judge you either way.
---
i didn't say i wasn't a fan.
---
i just said the game had changed a lot - and i had no desire to start over. i gave no oppinion of the new content.
---
nah fuck that, keep this style up. Its cool.
---
So let me get this right: A Christian is visiting your country and your automatic inclination is that he's homophobic because he's Christian and a Republican?

Please elaborate on what makes him a homophobe besides woke Twitter groupthink saying so.

You wouldn’t consider “game changes” as “new content”? I’ve always associated the two.

People who aren't in FW should go suspect when they take the gate.
---
It is a mobile war. Forcing an escalation im prepared for when they aren’t. That’s the point. However, That runs the risk of them being prepared to my plan and as such, counter me anyway. A super and fax wing allows smaller groups to hit hard on unprepared opponents.
---
Well, we were overpromised and underdelivered on the event, we were overpromised and underdelivered on the SKINs provided for participation, it's only natural that we'd be overpromised and underdelivered on the delivery of the SKINs themselves.
---
Pretty much why I'm not playing classic.  I was always a PVP-centric player  I would play BC in a heartbeat because BC was basically classic, but balanced.
---
Just use gates
---
no.
---
i think of game changes in changes to the mechanics. new content is new content.
---
the mechanics of eve have been surprisingly unchanged over the years. we still have 2 types of tanks (hull tanking is just a meme), 4 weapon types, etc most of that is the same.
---
as for wow, look at how talent points used to work - you used to get 1 per level. now it's just like... i don't even know, i didn't really understand what they did with it then there's glyphs on top of that etc.
---
&gt; They need need to increase to max jump mass to very large for low class space connecting high class
---
No. The division of capital-capable J space from low class is deliberate and meaningful. You shouldn't be able to drop your capital fleet on a C3 corp.

---
The problem isnt that 100 people are stronger then 1 super, but that with the current meta all you see is bomberfleets that pop out of nowhere, kill you and be gone. There still wont be any interesting fights to be seen. All that cyno change did was making nullsec risk/reward scale drop far into risk. Now if I want to undock my super I need at least 2 alts ready to support. 1 Fax and 1 recon or I am already dead.

if nobody else is playing, what's the point of logging in?

You could courier contract it, sell it, leave it, or join the group that now owns the station. The only place that actually dropped loot for a free for all was a POS. People have very selective memory about this for some reason. Asset safety was the answer that ccp came up with to get people to accept player owned stations.
---
I was so damn sure that was the tagline for Mittanicom way back when.
---
Great job!
---
Most likely not an prepared statement to get the little drones on your side.
---
Yeah that is why its the only thing that matters, otherwise your just comparing two inflating "currencies". Minerals and isk
---
I’m curious of your opinion. Are you talking nuke faxes right out the game? Would you rather see a BS with a similar module to triage that outputs 4-5 guardians worth of rep instead of the 8-9 current fax model? Would you like to see cap injectors limited to 1 per hull? Would you like to see fax reps useless after the 3rd fax? 
---
There’s a lot of wiggle room between current model and axing them from the game. That said as someone who has fought faxes in j space, fuck faxes.
---
Obligatory:

Most Low class holes only have 2bil total mass,so you can jump 2 caps max, whether you jump one or two its a one way trip. Gives the dudes in the C3 chance to use their caps as well.
---
You're hilarious. Are you as entitled and pretentious IRL as well or is that your RP persona?
---
welp age of chaos  aka minimal to no information.

If you would swap the leaderships of all alliances which just wants to hold on to their little online power they got with actual players that play for fun eve would be waaaaay more better.

More reason for that lowsec gate now.
---
INIT number 1 ;)
---
You're right... but.  
---
Should I really have to potentially eat a month's worth of plex to move a Nidhoggur to staging?  If I needed to burn 50m / a cyno I wouldn't be mad.  If I couldn't hotdrop every Tom, Dick, and Harry that shot a Rorqual I wouldn't be mad either.    
---
This is a change that creates significantly more gameplay problems than it solves - if it solves any problems at all.  Odds are pretty good every miner with more brains than spod is going to mine in a pack with multiple recons on standby and thus the status quo continues.
---
&gt; t's not "hard to obtain" is it you doofus.
---
exactly. 
---
&gt; And it doesn't require "thought" either, unless that thought is, "there are 1,000 more productive things I could be doing with my time, or 1,001 if I include flushing my head down the loo". After those 1,001 thoughts thought 1,002 should be, "I'll just buy a plex".
---
working as intended then
---
I do not consider those comparable. It's a question of defaults.
---
On-grid tethering didn't exist: POSes were located on moons far away from most stargates and stations. They did not have system-wide warpable beacons, so you needed a bookmark to warp inside a shield. The shield could also not be configured to allow public access.
---
POSes offered the best production bonuses which provided an incentive to build away from the safety of indestructable stations, and in some cases POSes were the only way to build certain items. When they were destroyed all contents were immediately lootable. This functionality has been lost.
---
This meta show was just about all the null guys jerking each other off saying how bad eve is and ccp trying to ruin their game. And in betwenn was hy trying to tell them that they suck and should actually do something ingame and play the game instead of blueing everyone. And the only response was how bad eve is and ccp is trying to ruin their game.

I laughed so hard at this pic my stomach started hurting really great

Now if you could point me to some courses or website I could attend so I can read things you never mentioned XD
---
Stories like this are what make me love this game so much.
---
TRUE and SAD
---
To bad the only action players take is blueing.....
---
Boobs?

Slowcats abused it in a way where taking 60 seconds to deagro would have been fine and were practically patched out of the game by Phoebe jump changes almost 2 years before that.
---
There are people who only buy good phones, rather than popular ones
---
For alpha characters a mining battleship has better efficiency than venture

As much fun as that would be, it's also a horrible idea

Can you imagine 400 TEST slowcats :P
---
* A new industrial-only bridging module has been added for the Rorqual.
---
Lets see star citizen copy this

Rorquals are pvp ships though
---
You are all wrong, it's a drake

I said that the blackout was largely responsible for the fixed faucets and corrected ME. I don’t know exactly how I misinterpreted him in that regard. 
---
That’s two more titan kills than you are likely to get in a month’s time. The trend has been mine in lowsec and rat in Myrmidons. I look forward to next years campaign video when you tally all your Myrm kills.
---
This change hurts "small nullsec alliances" much much more than it hurts larger blocs. 
---
It does help small gangs not partaking in sov however.
---
Blackout and cyno changes are for exactly that, inb4 morale posting from Goons saying "but the little guys!"

Well you moved because you was invaded.  Should have moved to Venal unblued the world and just killed shit.

For the microgangs that's true but most organized blops groups jump the bridger in too so they can extract with 0 effort.

...right, the region most dependent on the super-umbrella meta unaffected by the cyno change. LOL! Keep lying to yourself. The dual account meta of having a Force Recon alt on grid with your ratting carrier will get old and tedious within hours.

a dozen salty krabs from reddit? Good.
---
Wait, neocom is don’t on Android?
---
Then there is [Evanova](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tlabs.android.evanova) which has what you're asking for.
---
PLEX is like gold, nobody uses gold for daily transactions or as the foundation of an economy because it is too limited in supply and said supply is too inflexible. PLEX does not facilitate 99.9% of transactions in EVE so it can not be used as the currency to judge money supply and inflation. Isk is what we use for everyday use, and the buying power of isk has stayed extremely stable over the past years or even increased. 1 B of isk bought roughly the same amount of in game goods and services as it did years ago. You can play the game without ever interaction with Plex, you can't play the game without ever interacting with isk.
---
"b-b-b-but i don't like **change**!"
---
The MER didn't have the cyno changes. Blackout is one thing. Losing the super-umbrella is a whole new enchilada.
---
OwO
---
Ask black frog they may help cyno you out for a fee of course.
---
How about this, you've gotta be super unlucky to lose hg snakes in lowsec lol
---
But daddy, you daid yourself I'm an idiot, I always need spoon-feeding!
---
Whatchu been playing fam?
---
All ships are PvP ships, sometimes whether they want to be or not.
---
Destroying engineering citadels drops the in build items. And you have compare tether to pos shields because it was designed to replace it. Low power citadels having no tether would be fine but it needs to exist in some form.
---
In Alabama, can confirm, it's windy.

Does this site require java because I cant see anything aside from a circle and some BG stuff

Judging by the salty as fuck posts from goons in reddit, that's not 100% true

We know how to do other things, we are asking what is the point of nullsec if it's worse than highsec in both risk and reward.

If I can kill the force recon or blops and GTFO, still worth it. Maybe not if we whelp a whole gang

Actually a true statement

i'll be glad to let you starve, on this occasion.

also, on every other occasion.

Congratulations on the kill.

When did I specify cyno changes? We are talking about current changes that people are acting like goons who say it's bad are self serving, goons have been the least affected according to the mer.

I wish. Bots moved to highsec and PCU is down

There is not any hope. The past has been lost. The future is dark.

Nah, that would be someone who created a Reddit username based on their irrational hatred of a group of players in an obscure video game.  **That** is something quite autistic and retarded.
---
A possibility, thank you

Your comments are the problem with the game, I would rather take on 100 new bro's than have someone like you projecting negativity across the forums.  Be part of the solution not the problem dude.
---
Got get my KMs!
---
This. Idiots don't know how to read statistics pages...big surprise. The biggest alliances are the least affected by all of these changes, despite CCP trying to ruin the blue donut. Small corps and solo players were \*\*heavily\*\* affected by these changes, while it's an inconvenience to the donut.
---
We were just having a discord chat about **how many** Recons we should keep on grid with miners/ratters. It's a question of how safe we should try to make things, not whether it's possible.
---
Would have to be an eject exchange.... nobody would go for that
---
Haha surely ther iS a logical solution to this conundrum
---
Also a good suggestion
---
Will tell you soon if I can't figure something else out, and thank you for even considering
---
Then good luck getting yourself back to lowsec
---
Remember to log off inside a structure next tume
---
They would probably be taking more risk then me
---
Probably because of the accusatory tone in your prior comment
---
Exactly, They should be able to log in, crab, watch netflix, and shitpost on reddit all at the same time now .
---
Thank you for the idea it is a sketchy situation for sure
---
does something no become dead if it is killed?
---
Damn it Davey, are you on steroids again? You know you don't need them to choke people out right?
---
Hahaha you funny Indy
---
I might be hella screwed here lol
---
How were you getting more kills in your slumber compared to now, especially with such a torrential influx of new folks?
---
I love it and am excitedly waiting for clearly best girl frigate, the Cruor.
---
What you baking playa?
---
hat gons
---
Still losing people overall, which is not what this game needs. Its needed an injection of new blood for awhile, and net loss just so l33t pricks can kill afk myrmidons is not what the game needs.
---
I would sooner gate jump right before or after server reset before I self distruct
---
test calls goons for everything and who was out defending panda space last night? lmao
---
disappointing how brainwashed you are
---
I remember when this happened for me. I was so sure it was a scam, that I just ignored them. :) I guess I missed out on a free stuffs!
---
Yeah, but none of those things resulted in the actual items moving unless a player moved them.
---
I don't think there should be a complete loot drop, except probably there should for medium structures (which are more replacing POS than stations). But nor should you be able to extract your assets to lowsec just by pressing a button. Asset safety should allow you to collect assets in the same system, or transfer the rights to do so (to allow the firesaling to locals).
---
&gt;It is really, really easy to be on a stuka fleet. Take wh&gt;maybe take a gate&gt;anchor up&gt;lock what gets broadcast&gt;hit f1
---
Which is what makes it so funny that the l33t lords who love flying that and similar bomber fleets are the same ones who insult most bloc players by calling them F1 warriors.
---
I always feel as if ventures are male for some reason  
---
but good job on the painting, pretty good!
---
Well at the time combat refitting existed, you didn't have 700 titans on one side of the fight.
---
I mean that is kinda how that works. Blow up in the same ship in a hundred fights and you will start to learn. There are no skill injectors for player skills, you have to go out, try, and fail. Just pick a cheap ship to fail in and enjoy the process.
---
Kick them and farm them all. You know you want to. Give in to the darkness.
---
I bet you keep saying that right up until CCP has to start increasing the sub cost to compensate for a game losing players so fast they can't afford to keep paying everyone.
---
Haha thank you for the idea I really think an old school eject transaction would be super cool especially with that much isk on the line
---
this weekend we did ginger short bread because it was biscuit week, last week was a raspberry and white chocolate chip tray bake for cake week. the week before that, to get us in the groove for the start of the series we made what were meant to be chocolate crunch cookeies but they ended up basically being brownies with cornflakes in so we had a go at some chocolate chip cookies but we didn't have chocolate chips so we just used whole squares of a chocolate bar.
---
i think this weekend we're making pretzels, because i think it's bread week?

Vulture

So a Drake?
---
Which ones were hurt in particular?
---
My sugar just went up reading that. Sounds super yummy tho
---
What part of space are you in? In all parts of space, the basic PVE tradeoff is between safety and income. If you're in highsec and you're getting ganked, are you putting tank mods on your ships? (You should. The ganks will stop.) If you're in nullsec, or w-space, understand that you have opted for less safety in order to get higher net income. (As far as I know, lowsec gets you both lower safety and lower income even when you know what you're doing.) It's fine to not give a shit about PVP. If you want to be ganked less, there are things you can do, including changing where you live.
---
Not getting into politics bud - opinions are like arseholes, everyone has one, that's mine on the person in question given his history.
---
Done and dusted, you do you, I'll do me.
---
I hear ya. I'm just showing there's two sides to the risk averse coin. These micro gang dudes and solo T3C are the same as the carebears, run for the hills at the first sign of trouble.
---
CCP why can my single, unsupported, 70billion isk ship not kill the entire fleet trying to kill me. I paid good real life money to inject into this ship I don't know how to properly fly. It shouldn't die.
---
He's already hinted at his next brain aneurysm of an idea on his last interview. He thinks it should be easier for people to tear apart groups from the inside by robbing them. This is him out right admitting his goal up to this point was to intentionally nerf specific groups and because its failing to do what he wanted he's going to make it easier for someone to screw over an entire alliance in the hopes that the big groups destroy themselves because he is all out of ideas on how to do it with game mechanics. I wonder how bad he will fuck up the roles system within corp/alliance structure trying to make this work.
---
I started rolling around on the floor and banged my head against my desk and started bleeding everywhere and had to visit the er for a serious concussion, WTF LMAOO DUDE
---
Op needs to do one for drake.
---
I don't know about that item in particular, but I do know that for many if not all T2 items, it requires the T1 item to build it as part of the ingredients, so even if nobody would want to *fit* the T1 item, industrialists actually need the thing to build the T2 item, so people building the T1 item still have demand for it despite it being inferior in every way compared to the meta item.
---
have you seen some of the guys at my gym? absolute monsters.
---
what kid?
---
Agreed. There's risk averse people everywhere, but there's also the ones who scream and rush into a gang they know will probably kill them in the hopes that they come out alive or take down as many as they can
---
I think I could venture a guess...
---
How to collapse big groups? Remove ESI so that third party websites cant organize everything for you :^)
---
for sure.
---
I wouldn't put any in a shop window, we've got to work on our presentation. however, they were pretty delicious. shortbread needed a bit more butter, mind you.
---
Have cyno skill
---
level knock cyno time down by 5% per level.
---
For Provi to get that much out of there space is impressive tbh. That's pretty poor space if I understand correctly. Groups like CVA aren't there for profit though. They at there for RP reasons.
---
Groups like Goons/Test/Horde attack those regions due to boredom more than anything else. It's the result of players just heading to large umbrella alliances. It end when there is no reason for conflict. It could easily be argued that EVE is already there. That would be up to individual opinions though. The "wars" that are fought certainly lack any sense of urgency.
---
And now I shall respond to your feedback.
---
&gt; Citadels - Too reduce spam, should restricted to one per planet. Still makes a systems multi use but has a cap. Good for starting conflict, want a place in a system-Hi, Low, Null - fight for it. Low power citadels should have one 24hr timer from the time of re-enforcement. Astras should only have one timer and higher dps cap, same for all small Upwell structures.
---
Sounds like a good idea to me. Maybe there could be limits on where the bigger citadels could be anchored, too? Astrahus' anywhere, Fortizars in low and null, Keepstars in null only?
---
&gt; Ganking on Trade Hub's - Give all HiSec stations a tether, flame that if you want.
---
I think allowing civilian stations to tether would be a good idea, it wouldn't keep people from ganking on stargates, which are the real choke points of a system anyway. Hell, from a lore perspective the empires should have installed tethering technology on all their stations the moment it became possible to do so.
---
Of course, if we were going purely by lore then they'd probably be a lot more proactive against capsuleers repeatedly breaking the law in their space and pilots with a -5 security rating wouldn't even be able to enter hisec, so...yeah.
---
&gt; Blackout/Intel - Keep blackout, but add an Upwell structure that creates a local for sov holder. No timer, high dps cap, Sov 5, same maintenance cost as a jump bridge. Other uses, can scan cloaked ships. Underdeveloped space would be intel-less.
---
That sounds like a good idea, though I also like u/ReedIcculus ' idea of a player's corp/alliance mates showing up on local.
---
&gt; Faction Warfare - Here is where I would add "instance pvp." Replace plexs with a Plantside 2 system control tug-of-war through pve/pvp missions. Player in FW would receive missions from whatever faction command to move to the frontline and engage the enemy. Players, after entering the assigned system would receive a "warp too" bookmark and engage npc's in order to control the dungeon grid. No more button to orbit, all pew pew. Here is where the instance part comes in. Faction command will call for reinforcements through a "warp to faction FC" function. Players, in their own gangs/fleets, enter grid and pew pew. Players receive LP and small isk amounts for killing NPC/Players. System and be scaled up for massive instance fights, like kill the faction boss. Systems could be cyno jammed by NPC faction, something to fight over. System control though capturing progressively harder missions, think some kind of diamond npc's. Should be a great place for all those small/nano gangs, solo ,and small groups. No more LP farming by mission runner bots.
---
This sounds like a great idea!
---
&gt; Ship balance - CCP needs to iterate on the meta at least once a quarter. Make the Drake great again CCPLZ
---
Agreed. Maybe they could also take the opportunity to adjust the meta in certain directions for a period of time to shake things up?
---
&gt; Mining - Delete ore anomaly's, between belts and moons, they are not needed. Ore belts that deplete and regenerate overtime would create something of a crop rotation system. I think moons are in a good place.
---
I don't really mind ore anomalies, but I think they should need to be scanned down by players, and NPC mining ships should be jumping in after someone visits it for the first time so players will have to compete in order to get the richest asteroids (or maybe go pirate and steal their ore).
---
&gt; Big change - Delete excavator drones. Roll Rorquals back to a mining fleet support role, ore compressing, on grid booster, Panic, bonus for shield reps, drone damage/speed/hitpoints, and 300km tractor beam range. Make Orcas the capital mining "end game" ship. Give it a capital mining laser with massive range so it can cover those massive ore belts, bonus for mining drones and drone range. Cycle amount is up for discussion. Keep the ore hold at 150,000m, this will reintroduce jet can mining. Rorquals will tractor the can in to compressing ore.
---
I think there are two ways CCP should handle excavator drones:
---
* Have the Rogue Drones subvert them in a major event that removes them from player control.
---
* Make them something that can only be used to aid the dedicated mining ships in the fleet the Rorqual is commanding; if it's alone, it can't use the drones.
---
&gt; Supers/Titans - Delete them. Capital ships are "easier" to balance without having to consider effects on Supers. They are more killable by subcaps and other caps.
---
I think deleting supercapital ships is a bad idea, and would like to propose an alternative:
---
* Go back to calling supercarriers "motherships" and give them their own dedicated skill requirement, as titans do. Double their size, too, so they actually look like supercapital ships instead of moderately bulkier carriers.
---
* Remove the ability to apply skill points to the skills required to fly capital and supercapital ships. You can inject all the skill points you want, but skilling into capitals requires you to do it the old-fashioned way.
---
* Refund the skill points players have put into the racial titan skills to bring their numbers back down. It will obviously take a while for them to enter the field again - along with motherships since they now require a special skill to use - but that's a load of breathing room the game probably needs at the moment.
---
* Optional: Give Force Auxiliaries their own dedicated skill, and maybe rename them to "[tenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship%27s_tender)" or something. That's basically what logistics ships are.
---
* Optional: This is probably a really, *really* stupid idea, but with all the capital ship proliferation CCP might go the whole hog on cutting it off and refund the skill points put into *all* the racial capital and supercapital skills, requiring players to train them up the slow way while giving them enough wiggle room to inject those points into skills used for flying advanced subcapital ships.
---
&gt;the “home defense meme” is really stale at this point because bringing hard counters to a group of people you already outnumber is a cheap way to deter a fight and deny everyone content
---
LOL, you jumping a guy in a barge with your 2 bil loki isn't content for him. The concept of the defense fleet is to intentionally drive home to your the fact that this is their space and they don't want you in it, the demoralizing overkill is brought to bear with the intention of making you not want to come back.
---
oh joy, can't wait for the reddit retard brigade to hop on the train for that one

It's in the game and most likely staying so how about this:

You can rep at your size-class or up one size-class but not downward. See draw backs below,

- Small reps heal small to medium vessels
---
- Medium reps heal medium to large vessels
---
- Large reps heal large to capital vessels
---
- Capital reps heal capital to super capital vessels

Drawbacks: if you apply reps to a smaller vessel it over modulate the repper burning it out on the repping ship and dissipating the repped vessel's defensive resource you were trying to rep.
---
Oh those were the days. That was the mining ship back in the day
---
it's a start!
---
I'm more a sous chef than anything. i just get told to weigh this, mix that and somehow we end up with baked goods at the end. I just do as i'm told!
---
You're kidding, right?
---
The blocs can park a recon or blops on every Rorqual ball.  They've got a jump gate network to get a recon to any tackled super very quickly, assuming they're not gonna require a recon alt for every super pilot.
---
And if that fails, they've got enough players to flash-form a good-sized subcap fleet.
---
Blackout and cyno changes make things more annoying for the blocs.  They are not at all crippling.
---
Heh.

Is the lion being risk averse when it gets out of the elephants way or just smart?
---
Risk averse is bringing supers to a fight with a microgang in cruisers, not the cruisers running when the supers show up.
---
That text is really hard to read holy shit be better than this pls

What makes you think they're losing the super umbrella?
---
You think goons are gonna somehow have trouble finding recons and blops?

On top of this, the T1 modules are actually built and sold (hopefully) for profit. Opposed to the meta modules that are harvested as a side effect of PvE and simply dumped onto the market.

Well lets look by comparing June/Aug MER numbers

Cloud Ring, owned by Init and Wangs, 175B &gt; 22B

Pure Blind, owned by Snuff and French Connection, 580 &gt; 247

Provi, owned by CVA, 832 &gt; 71

So nothings changed then

Are you and your small group gonna go stand up against pandafam, legacy, or imperium, take their space, drop citadels in your new space? 
---
If so do you know what happens next?
---
they should do praxs,dominix  eventually mining in oracle perhaps mining with vindicator would work on zkill
---
Everyone was rushing for covert cynos as they would be needed to cheaply move jump freighters, but CCP then changed their minds and added the industrial cynos instead.
---
Low contrast hurts my retina

&gt;Don't bother answering.

It's hard to believe people like you actually exist. You're such an absolute joke it's mind blowing.

But seriously, I'd argue we've been fighting this war for more than a year (excluding a brief ceasefire after we took Tenerifis). You guys are our nearest hostile neighbor, as long as you live next door we'll probably keep fighting. That's what you do in Eve.
---
And that's pretty good with me, this has been the most fun war I ever fought. Plenty of twists and turns, some epic battles, lots of farming krabs, it's everything a girl could dream of.
---
When I heard about the changes coming, I texted my old eve buddies to get back into the game. We used to love living in lowsec pirating and roaming into NPC null. We ended up quitting after every other ship you caught just lit a cyno and dropped a fax+super on your ass in lowsec... Now we are back in earnest, and I can't wait to be able to roam again freely knowing my lowly 2-3 BC fleet won't get dunked by a bored super pilot anymore
---
Agreed. My graphics are noticeably improved and wormholes look fantastic now!
---
I hope that you'll do more because it's amazing
---
Implying 95% of Nullsec blobs would even go to the trouble to park a recon in the site. Hard to imagine all the dogshit tier alliances/corporations hoovered up over the years aren't full of the lowest common denominator in nearly every single case.
---
Refit to a battle rorq and make the 30 jumps. Kill all who dare defy you, or die trying!
---
The choices of what ship you fly and how you fly it are not something that is determined by skill points. Choosing the right ship of the right job is always going to be more effective than being able to just flying the ship it takes the most time to train or most skill points to fly. You're in a cheap cov ops frigate and you engineer  a Titan getting killed while it's trying to travel from one system to another, that is the emergent gameplay that Eve tries to create. Yes there is going to be pros and cons, advantages and disadvantages, and fights that you can't win no matter what. But that's part of actually learning how to play the game instead of just being upset that someone can fly ship it takes longer than you to train. That is always been a part of eve since day one. That is part of what makes this game so interesting is that you can if you do what you need to do correctly, if you play your cards right, you can totally beat the crap out of people who've been playing this game for decades, or have any ship in the game. If that is too hard, this is not the game for you.
---
Technically yes, but you're looking for a flightsim game, this is definitely not it.

If it becomes a requirement from the alliance for saving their caps, they'll do it.  Just like they did under previous requirements.

Why stop there? Put fax on the athanor just on standby just incase the blops battleship cyno is needed.

He's bad because he often says dumb things, uses data only to suit his position, ignores data that does not suit his position, thought the CSM and CCP were run by goons for goons, and once accused the r/eve moderators of banning him at the behest of goons.   
---
Also, he once posted this big thing about how mean goons were for making fun of people, while making fun of a guy PTSD looking ex-soldier whose Hel he killed, then in the same post bragging about said kill, accused goons of being forum warriors.
---
You're just butthurt someone called you out for your stupidity. It's obvious you're trying to save face. Best of luck idiot. I clearly proved most bots have left null or stopped playing. You're stretching for reasons to bring back your local crutch. Others make valid points about the VNI effect as well, however your claim of 50% drop is obsurd and ridiculous. It's embarrassing to be honest. Truth is the goon effect is all about crying the loudest. They have the most vocal babies that their opinions seem like a majority, but you at the Shittani are all basic scrubs working in a muppet factory for their own agenda.
---
If you think botting is even close to being eradicated, you're wrong on so many levels.
---
No I read the OP just didn't think they were a big enough name for you to be commenting 100 times
---
yes - when all the other small guys get pushed out the remaining guys slightly bigger become the "small guy".
---
the fact that you've questioned if they are small, rather than providing examples of smaller entities kinda proves the point. anyone smaller has been wiped out of irrelevance or folded in to a larger group. exactly what people said would happen.
---
oh wow and where can i see this movie?
---
&gt;ratting carrier will get old and tedious within hours.
---
if you are ratting in a carrier you are already doing the most tedious thing you can do in the game, what's a little more?
---
My honest opinion is that usually ganking happens only once to a newbro, and that's the defining moment where the choice is made between quitting or getting better at the game to keep playing. If a newbro gives up after getting ganked, I really don't think he's particularly suited for the other, rather harsh aspects of the game.
---
I'm not saying griefing doesn't exist and there aren't pieces of trash out there that deliberately go for newbros to ruin their starting experience. I despise these people just like you. But your occasional ganking can be avoided with proper guidance (which I will concede is lacking from CCP/tutorials), and I also believe ganking is part of the game and shouldn't be completely remobed just for the sake of players that aren't fit or rather have the wrong expectations of game.
---
Now please engage with my point because I actually seriousposted

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d26hbm/mittani_asks_innominate_how_are_you_feeling_after/ezt3gyp/
---
I can also add to that the Scalding Pass/Wicked Creek quagmire with groups like BSOD (~500 characters), Toilet Paper (500 characters), and Literally Triggered (65 characters) existing and doing their thing there. 
---
That's three regions that aren't claimed by any nullbloc, and surprise, they are thriving.
---
Anything west of SP/WC is Legacy and Frat controlled, further west you have Imperium stretching from Period Basis to Cloud Ring, and even having blues up in Pure Blind (FXR are blue to GSF in particular, not sure about the rest of the Imperium).
---
Join pandemic horde, get someone to jump you out
---
This is a clever comic about how blocs n+1 strategy stifle small entities and choke the life from Eve.  Then they blame CCP for the content going away.  
---
This game was a lot better when there were a couple 20-40 man PvP corps in most regions.  Ironically this is CCP's fault.
---
hurgh ccp im trying to bait wormholers but im dummy thicc and the clap of my warp core stabilisers keep alerting the locals

If they dont do THIS THING then the entire game is [doooooooomed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1Nd6LU4ImQ)

It looks fun.
---
Dont you think its kinda impossible to give specifics on day 0?
---
The premise is that large blocs have the resources/manpower to rub multiple recon alts, and the cap supremacy to cyno in early and hold any grid they want, cuz goodluck escalating with these changes
---
Since when has that been a requirement?

Also, more or less has worked for Simple Farmers in Catch.

---
&gt;SMALL ALLIANCES THAT WANT TO DO FINE ARE DOING FINE.

then pray ccp never gives people a reason to want to displace them.

PROVI is literally in no way a “small” nullsec coalition.

Haha! Battle Rorq!

---
Come to Delve and test your pet theory out. I dare you. No? I know, its hard... when will CCP finally figure out that nerfing basic human interaction and the ability of goons to organize at all is totally unfair? They should nerf goons by making EVE single player. Then you'll really show 'em.
---
Have to be docked to change corp
---
This is bad, and you should feel bad.
---
&gt; not in a smaller group or you would know your statement is seriously flawed.    They have capitals just not the huge numbers.     This just makes them being able to take a fight even less likely in a lot of situations.
---
Wait, do I hear: "totally unfair that group is bigger and better organized than mine! When will CCP turn null sec into a pvp arena to make it fair!?"
---
smart change i like stupid change i don't and these changes aren't smart
---
I’m pretty sure I still have an old mining rokh sitting around somewhere too...
---
That suit is either a t3c or a bomber, because it's designed for a pussy.
---
Gosh you are cringe
---
If test can't get 2:1 numbers they usually stand down. Their fcs are so bad that when faced with a situation where numbers don't secure the win they lock up on comms it's pretty sad
---
Nope. Absolutely no worries; and I would totally rat in one of my three supers, but unfortunately I make all my money market trading, so why would I want to undock my super to make my eyes bleed?
---
I will undock my supers to jump to umbrella your face when those multiple cynos nobody in Delve can use anymore go up.
---
speaking of tempo, what ever did happen to those weekly changes hilmar said we would be getting?
---
feels like ages since we had a change before today's patch.
---
If any large nullbloc wanted to come evict us, they easily could. Even if literally all of Tribute joined forces to fight say TEST invading, it still wouldn't be enough.
---
&gt; WANGS dont really krab in their nullsec space
---
Apparently there's a handful who crab in their null space http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Cloud_Ring/Z-Y7R7#npc24
---
Snuff definitely doesn't in theirs.
---
FXR and Banderlongs do crab in their PB space.
---
Provi is probably the smallest group that own sov space and depend on it for income.
---
Congrats on the kill :)
---
I live in Amarr space, but I haven't been attacked in highsec (yet?). 
---
Most of my losses were in lowsec or wormhole space. I don't really have "access" to nullsec. I have lost 4 ships in wormholes, 3 explorers to ganking Asteros and 1 battleship to an entire gang (at least 5 people) including an interdictor. Lost a battlecruiser, a battleship and an explorer in low sec. Narrowly avoided getting killed a couple other times, including one venture gas mining op that lasted a whole 5 minutes before 4 people showed up. 
---
Here's the thing. I'm probably playing the wrong game, but I'm neither equipped or skilled to fight back. In all those attacks I never stood a chance. I feel like a deer trying to escape wolves. And I keep thinking that this game doesn't cater to space fans or spreadsheet lovers. This game caters to assholes who find it hilarious to ruin other people's day. As I understand, it's generally not lucrative to pvp. 
---
So I find myself retreating to highsec doing level 4 missions just so I can afford to go back to losing shit outside of the safety zone, because so far all this "high risk high reward" content has been nothing but losses and stress. I want to go back to fighting sleepers in wormholes or see those lucrative combat anoms but I hesitate because I'm too afraid to deal with this. So I look at the big career chart and find myself retreating into the "auto quit mode" slot.
---
Half of Test's space is empty but I guess you need a war to keep the line members engaged so, "OMG FRT MENACE".
---
Starting a content war with a group in your opposite timezone is literally the worst idea ever. But keep badposting about lack of fights and FRT not being online when you're online. Just keep trading the same worthless systems back and forth forever, that's fun. Luckily for you there are other groups who have allied with us - not so much to help FRT out but more because they want to farm you for their content. So... grats on fights?
---
PS. Test nerds spamming Tienanmen Square related shit in pub chats to try and get fellow Eve players thrown off the internet OR EVEN ARRESTED is just... wow, I can't even. That's past toxic into actual evil. Serious question, w in t actual f?

Why would we use a 2+ billion blops for cynos when we can, instead, have 15 recons on grid?

&gt; this statement is also wrong. most pvp-ers are doing pve, industry etc to get money. so we don't really need carebears

you have to pick one: fast changes or listening to (constructive) feedback

It's funny to hear you call it an excuse as we're watching small alliances fold and their players join blocs, leave null it just quit the game entirely.
---
if they have a guy in a barge then he can jump into a hauler from the sma of the rorqual 
---
light cyno  as rorq panics 
---
cyno is safe for x time skills and all rthat jazz
---
then bo bridges in recon normal cyno up and rorq reps the recon
---
bobs your uncle and super/cap fleet is in to save your rorqual
---
but yes groups will have a cloaked recon in system ready to go too
---
Its not so much the isk as it is the resources to build things, honestly. And there is literally no way you can hurt our ability to do that for *at least a year* unless you *actually* just start deleting things from hangars--and if you think the player drop off is bad now, wait until CCP actually tried to implement that.
---
Don't you think its kinda impossible to say "The little guy is fucked" on day 0, especially when you aren't in a small alliance and don't play like one?
---
Playerbase is shit. Turnover is good. 👍 Changing the type of players in Eve is what it needs. Or do we need more null blob, capital droppers, in large coalitions not fighting and just running rorqs all day?
---
i like how the assfrig still has a cyno fit but offline
---
Very cool to hear about his story, and that he still is part of the game. One of the interesting things about Eve relative to other games, is the variety of ways to play it which include not traditionally "playing" it.
---
As he ackowledged in his post on the forums, the type of things he's requesting open a large security gap in a game that is already dealing with a botting problem. I'm not sure how secure his idea of an account locked private key is, or how easy it would be to manipulate. Hopefully something works out so he and others in a similar situation can enjoy more of what Eve has to offer.

Um you did not actually read the thread did ya.    He said little guys do not have capital umbrellas.    I was pointing out he is incorrect.     But I know I am horrible at communicating so I will take the blame for your failure to understand the context.
---
Except we don't really blob small alliances.
---
Reminds me of that image of the four T3 cruisers
---
These dudes get so ass hurt when any changes don't suit their drop a capital playstyle
---
I mean literally CCP has priced out many of the small 15 to 20 man corps from even *moving* their capitals.
---
Fuck I have no idea why this game is dying.
---
Oh cool I must have missed the announcement. Glad to see they've changed their mind after thoughtful and genuine feedback from their playerbase! Really smart idea by players, who would have thought about just flashing an MMO to the point it was a decade ago?
---
same here i do think covert cloaked ships should be easier to find as they can warp
---
but hunting cloaked pilots that think they are safe or have to go afk in space and kill them thatr sounds mega fun
---
also been maxed skill for years too
---

Final blow only killmails return.
---
&gt; People still talking about hunter risk misunderstand the concept of risk/reward. Hunters do not generate ISK or minerals, mess up the economy. Game doesn't have to maintain a minimal, non-emergent risk level for them.
---
They understand it just fine, you're misunderstanding their point. I suspect it's done intentionally to promote your own preferred style of play over others, but given your trend of comment history, you may actually just **be** that dense.
---
&gt;Besides, being on the offense as an alliance or group is not a strong option. All relevant groups we have today are defensive turtling groups.
---
Not really relevant to the discussion, but there are myriad reasons to this that are only exacerbated by the latest round of idiocy.
---
&gt;So you're complaining about a playstyle which is already pretty weak in the overall meta. 
---
Are you fucking shitting me dude? Look at zkill, what are the top 3 ships currently?
---
1. Sabre
---
2. Loki
---
3. Hound
---
Two of those are covert-capable ships, and the *Hound* is **TWICE** as represented as any other ship on that entire list. 
---
You can fuck right off with that shit.
---
&gt;You can defend against hunters easily with enough people.
---
Sure, and you can physically block passage through your space with enough people in ships in a sphere around every stargate, but that would be absolutely fucking retarded to pitch as a strategy. Here you are suggesting the next best thing like it's no big deal though.
---
&gt;And if you don't have enough people, perhaps your ratting ship should die anyway.
---
So, let's spell this out so we can highlight exactly what you are advocating here:
---
1. Most ratting subcaps will die before help could even arrive from in-system. I mean, you can take out a Myrm with what, 2 bombs?
---
2. Even well-fit Carriers (let's call it 2m EHP) will die to a moderate-sized gang of bombers within 2 minutes, even if they don't void bomb 'em. 
---
 As we already know from drops the past two months, that's not long enough for a defense force to respond unless you have FAX blindly jump as soon as the call comes in.
---
So it sounds to me like you're saying that nullsec entities should have to have a handful of ships on-grid with every ratting ship in order to deserve a shot at defending their people, unless they're in a Super.
---
Oh, wait. Supers are a problem in your eyes too. They shouldn't be allowed to do anything to subcaps, because they're too hard to kill or something. Rorquals too, because ~reasons~
---
It's a good thing that this doesn't sound like some tryhard simpleton arguing that a fair portion of the playerbase should be fine with being a punching bag for every gaggle of smoothbrains who managed to figure out enough of the interface to train into a covert doctrine and scrape up enough pocket change to acquire a bomber.
---
I'd be worried otherwise. *Especially* if he was on the CSM.
---
&gt; FXR and Banderlongs do crab in their PB space.
---
Yes, they do, and like I said, they reduced their krab activity, yay.
---
Look over a long period of time with WANGS space. They have like 3 systems where some folks go out and scan down serpentis combat sites and run em but that's about it.
---
CCP chose neither i guess
---
Maybe just put more than 4 seconds work in MS Paint and it wouldn't be so terrible. The content would still be bad, but at least execution would be better.
---
The graph 📉 is starting to look like a failure Cascade
---
Git gud
---
No, actually. You would expect to see drop off from peak with any MMO. This is literally a unique incident in which a gaming company is driving of *droves* of its MMO subscribers with mechanic changes. Much like the company I used to work for did with SWG. 
---
Though I will say, at least SOE had an excuse in that Lucas Arts ***forced*** the NGE for SWG under the threat of license revocation. CCP has no excuse.
---
&gt;they better hope we don't bring our blob over there
---
Why post that in this thread in particular? Is this satire?
---
Its almost like ive played this game long enough to make a judgement call.
---
You might be surprised to learn how much BL/origin corp fights outnumbered against larger bloc entities, even if were on deployment in frat whose main timezone is 12 hours ahead of us.
---
Retriver? That's a procurer dude...
---
Look at all that thickeness!
---
doesn't this story end with the drummer becoming great?

You fight larger dudes for sure but you are not and never were a small nullsec alliance.

So people who screw up should quit the game???

Hello yes git gud cya
---
there are literally no reasons to take space or displace other groups. how "fine" do you think they would be if there were?
---
as if ccp has ever done either.
---
Cut the amount of blue loot dropped by half in order to make the reward match the risk.
---
exactly so it's not exaclty "doing fine" as much as it is "being irrelevant", or "being ignored" which ever you prefer.
---
Look. Here is the truth as I see it. These are measures that needed to be taken 2 years ago (or, more likely, never needed in the first place). As it is now, they are designed to bring PvP and danger back to nullsec. But PvP'ers largely quit. And we're all realizing we don't have the time, energy, motivation, or drive to jump back in and try to play now. Instead of bringing churned PvP'ers back to Eve, these changes are just driving PvE'ers to quit. 
---
I respect what CCP is doing. These are dangerous changes - to make these at a company this old, with a game this old, is seriously brave. But I fear that the damage was done a while ago and can't be undone.
---
It shows a lack of understanding, empathy and ability to critically think on your part. 
---
You are calling 'gankers' cowards for taking advantage of a situation for them to get kills in a battle scenario where they have little to no chance of losing and the opposing ships they are ganking have little hope of causing damage to them. 
---
Yet when you drop super capitals, bring overwhelming numbers and usually a better, more refined comp (with critical mass in logistics etc.) which is likely to be a counter-comp for them. Where you have little to no chance of losing and they have little hope of scoring any kills or will lose significantly more than they will gain, you call them cowards for leaving the field. 
---
Even though it's entirely the same thing. Except the gankers aren't cringe posting and saying 'fucking pussy cowards' when a group of procurers dock up to their PVP gang that outnumbers them 3 to 1.
---
There arent really any truely independent nullsec alliances.  There has and will always be someone bigger to pay tribute to. Such is life in conquerable space .
---
That isnt to say that these changes dont both hurt and help us in different ways
---
*sighs*
---
God... CCP... Eve community... forgive me for what im about to do...

*uncloaks* 'tis gonna be a bumpy ride

No movie yet, but they are thinking about it. Probably straight to BlueRay. If Blue Ray is still a thing by then...
---
This is the most meaningless statistic I think that has ever been posted in regards to MER data. Anyone who knows those regions know they aren't krabbing areas.

I'm a vocal supporter of the changes, but Christ, this post reads like some early prototype version of a procedurally generated forum bot.

You don’t have to worry about me nagging about breaking rules. You’re more than welcome.

The implication here seems to be "if big blobs want small alliances to have a place in the game they should stop fucking over the small alliances". But... why would they? If there is an easy target to kill, where you can do it with only a fraction of the logistical shenanigans and hassle of a large operation, why would you not do that? If people **can** kill the easy targets over risking battle with hard ones; **they will**. No?
---
oh okay we're back to inventing terms then
---
keep beeing you dave
---
Can you stop posting in every thread and just play eve online?
---
i didn't invent anything. i just pointed out a fact that you seem uncomfortable with.
---
It didnt die yet?
---
We all hope it does
---
Everyone here is entitled there own opinion even if its shit, and yours is very shit.
---
I didn't have time to change it before the fleet haha
---
not really. how would you define relevance in a sandbox game? You've failed to answer this question for me in multiple threads.
---
It's not about the time.  It's about the brain that thinks it's a good idea.
---
Lets be real here. if a Capital INDUSTRIAL ship cant jump to a industrial cyno, then its not really a industrial cyno is it/
---
Ok but this is the title in /r/askreddit of this uer's other post:
---
"Would adding recharged silica gel to a bottle of tequila (35% ethanol) and coffee filtering the silica out produce a more potent beverage and would that beverage be reasonably safe?"
---
&gt; **Local Chat/Blackout** \- The big complaint is that corp members cannot see eachother when in same system. EVE is about community and this does hurt the community. Perhaps allow instant local only to same corporation members. This way when you enter a system, you know your friends are there and you can say hello. "Feeling lonely in NS, join a corp !" 
---
That will give away intel - just get a spy in corp and they can see the enemy enter and leave local.  If it's going to be blacked out it needs to be blacked out. There is a corp channel already.  Also it will give the new players a false sense of security if they don't fully understand local and since this is all under the guise of helping new players vs. old players, that's bad.  
---
&gt; **Gankers on Trade Hub Undocks** \- Many of the people that get ganked on the undock of trade hubs are new bro's that dont know about undock and dock bookmarks and this can really hurt player retention. The new player experience doesn't explain this mechanic and doesn't explain using instant docks/undock bookmarks. Either explain it to new bro's or add a small tethering ring around tradehubs. This could help those new bro's hauling for the first time and the nado Gankers can still gank on gates all they want.. 
---
I think the trade hubs should be smartly designed.  The players face their own structures so the undock points where they want it to: a gate, another structure, etc.  Why would the empires not do the same thing, at least in their big capital/hub systems?  They should also intelligently increase security if people start getting shot, adding picket ships on the undock with each crime and then temporarily shutting down the station or even take drastic measures like pointing and webbing criminal pods if it continues - just like they would in real life.  I get the whole EvE is hard thing but getting shot in the middle of the highest security systems right on the busiest port in the area is like being robbed in front of a police station.
---
Also to add - I would like to see more diverse tech II or even new ships, more specialties and options.  Make fleets more complex and varied with different kinds of supporting ships or more kinds of specialty ships.  What would we have in real life: ships with better dscan and ships with a point defense system or something, that only works when on grid and fleeted up.
---
I mean, not to help the Goon narrative, but it kinda makes sense to me:
---
1. Make a Mobile version of very popular game
---
2. Make current popular game as crappy as possible
---
3. Promote the new Mobile game heavily
---
4. ??? ^^^(maybe ^^^nerds ^^^migrate ^^^over ^^^to ^^^new ^^^version ^^^of ^^^old ^^^game?)
---
5. Profit?
---
&gt;Snuff is a small nullsec alliance now?
---
the thought that someone would assert this actually made me laugh.
---
&gt;It's likely Goons numbers purposefully steadily decreasing as to add credibility to their narrative that it's killing the game.
---
This is pretty funny speculation considering that during this weekend's fireside Mittens threatened to purge anyone who shits on people for playing eve.
---
i guess people knowing you exist, would be a start.
---
given that on that list of examples you gave i'd never heard of most of them.
---
That's uhh, something... Although after peeking I'm thinking English isn't their first language
---
Grab a calculator then instead of playing a video game.
---
hull tank retriever  can withstand single catalyst and even eat it...
---
This smells baity to me
---
could you give an example of this ever actually happening for either situation?
---
Can anyone explain what is cyno please?
---
Cuz i can only really make the word chemo that sound like it...
---
yeah i had a good chortle
---
it should be 250% medium drone damage and 125%  medium drone HP...nerf gila to oblivion...long live STRATIOS.
---
Says the fucking test guy, first your alliance is shit. 
---
second, how the fuck do expect a recon to counter high DPS kiting fleet? forgive me you must be new.
---
oh okay. well thanks for your valuable input.
---
Lol what a bunch of shit.  How bout the NIP you guys decided to preemptively end?  How TEST leaders went to your glorious CC warrior to discuss an intermediate term agreement and he promptly thru PGL and Vily out?   How about your ranting and raving about hating test with admonished passion and wanting us evicted. 
---
Fuck all of this.  You’re content.  And you’re evaccing detorid for the safety of panfams umbrellas.
---
&gt; But that doesnt mean the mechanics of the game should make it possible for a defender to deny pvp content 
---
Why not?
---
&gt; The argument is that in order to sucessfully farm, the defender should have to engage the hunters on a more equal playing field. 
---
Why?
---
What I see here is salty self-titled "hunters" who can't find anyone to shoot at in nullsec, and then calling null too safe, while the reality is that they are just too bad/ too small/ not determined enough to find content. Why should the defender be obliged to provide content for roamers? Isn't it everyone's job to find their own content? I don't see any ratters asking pvpers to find them ded sites to run...
---
The real funny part is dropping a carrier on a single battleship
---
You have at least three posts talking shit about HK, yet you don't know anything about them or have strong opinions.  :okhand:  
---
And if it really was a joke, it wasn't a good one.  Dick jokes are the way to go my friend.  Everybody likes a good dick joke.
---
it’s because you dont have any drones in your drone bay so the modules are not giving bonus for the moment
---
if people don't know who you are, it's because you've done nothing of relevance. you understand how that works right?
---
Feed truth to spergs, get re-spergitation.  
---
Game is top heavy, and the top is dragging it down for any would-be new players.  
---
LS and other places used to be fun, but aren't as fun anymore. Cyno changes are being whined about by the top-heavies, not everyone else.  
---
Evolve or die.  
---
You want it to be tailored to you or dead, that's fine. Enjoy not playing when it's gone.
---
could be possible to develop software to help play eve by blind people?  i have eye disability - one eye has colors  flipped a bit.. so have hard time to play eve but i can manage it...  laser surgeon went wrong... time to heal  - year,chance for full recovery 80%
---
okay dave :)
---
agreed.  Good feedback
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpmGXeAtWUw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpmGXeAtWUw) Full scene for those wondering.
---
\&gt;If it becomes a requirement
---
Your pretending that test is competent enough to enforce any requirements  other then SRP payouts
---
I see no reason why you can't run it in a container. there's no image on docker hub if that's what you're wondering.
---
&lt;3
---
I would almost say you overpaid.  Almost.
---
of course you're not getting any bonus - you've got no drones to give the bonus to.
---
You CAN dry ethanol with molecular sieves, he was on to something. But you'd need a lot of sieve and it would probably wreck the flavor.
---
sickest use of this meme yet!
---
Your drone bay is empty, that's why you get the warning
---
if you're going to make a rule, you have to enforce it.
---
Well, I got an answer from CCP with regards to this "known issue" that I could find no information about online.  The resolution which helped me, and will hopefully help others who find this thread, was to create a system variable named "QT\_OPENGL" with the value "desktop".  A restart was required to apply this new variable.
---
I can make 300m/h in a frigate, a cruiser, a super, a pair of dreads, or multitudes of hulls and methods.  
---
People who whine about nullsec income levels are fucking morons.
---
Bet their hands were sweaty going into that engagement.
---
Every alliance is smaller than GSF.
---
Just finished setting up self-hosted pathfinder app yesterday, did it manually. Saw a few github repos with possible docker container setups but didn't try any of them so idk if they are reliable. There's a pull request on the pathfinder repo that adds a docker-compose config too but didn't read much into that either
---
probably told not to undock, did it anyways and got awoxed
---
\+1
---
+1 for deleting fax
---
&gt; Much like the company I used to work for did with SWG.
---
Oh hey, I worked there too! 
---
Hope you moved on to better things like I did, heh.
---
very beautiful!
---
Almost. Needs more titties. Make 'em jiggle.
---
That SA tries to destroy things? They don't need your apologetics.
---
:thonking:
---
Botters getting got
---
Nope, I spoke too soon... I am still getting a black screen when start the Eve launcher! :(
---
To be fair, only the carrier pilot knew he was gonna to go fight the rokh
---
We're sick of morons that can't even fit their ships right, let alone anything else, so we're just going to kill them ourselves.
---
Not a bot, he was on comms and is well known for being incompetent.
---
no worries, great kill btw
---
purge
---
This guy downed the whole pitcher of kool-aid
---
npsi fleet killed some rorqs, goon spai in the fleet heard their bots were being recorded, jay commisared the surviving rorqs
---
Nope, rorquals are allowed to be undocked in Delve, that's fine.
---
We're just not going to tolerate 100% spodbrains any more.
---
580B and 832B are sizable numbers. They aren't Delve or Esoteria, but people were making ok money in those places.
---
I hope you keep yourself extra safe in game 🙏
---
not 100% sure a bot, but 100% sure input broadcasting
---
And null players with their automatic intel tools that give a sound when enemy comes close have grown used to be 100% safe. Only way to catch people off guard was using blue awox alts.
---
dude.. .let us take a break first... we aren't super soldiers
---
yeah rorquals should be protected since they are industrials right?
---
Right. But I'm just wanting to be able to run the sites and not be a slow sitting duck.
---
Shut up idiot moron
---
That's, like your opinion man
---
ThOuSaNdS
---
On the wallet/market
---
CCP has r/Eve bots now?
---
im pretty sure you guys were told to keep caps docked
---
Fantastic. Do you take commissions?
---
I well remember the negrep bombing last Xmas, so actually I lied; I know perfectly well why.
---
The Reformation Begins!
---
tbh i dont really care if rorqs/caps were supposed to be docked, but it's funnier to see a dude lose lots of rorqs after being told not to undock
---
so that´s why people can only name about half a dozen guys when it comes to nullsec politcs in tyool 2019?
---
CO2 aint gonna work if gigX doesn't have a hand in it.
---
not rorquals
---
tfw you can't even read all-all ping intel right
---
May kill caps, but your toon looks like the creepy ice cream man that shouldn’t be near children.
---
not what happened.
---
I too am upset I can't afk rorq rat
---
I think hes tryna say they can work without gigx lol
---
Not a bad writeup, but the spin is a little too far into Cuckoo Land. It is interesting to see how the other side has been spinning the war to their members. I feel Legacy leadership has been pretty open and obvious about our prospects from the beginning. [You can read Vily's weekly updates right here on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cxbn4b/the_quiet_southern_war_weekly_updates/)
---
From the perspective of a Test line member, this was never billed as a war to evict winter.co. I can't seem to find a leaked copy of PGLs announcement, but I just went and re-read it. The end of the NIP, and thus the reinstated state of war, was just a recognition that Fraternity. had no intention to have a peaceful boarder with their neighbors. Not to blue status or not even a NIP, but not trying to push Legacy's allies out of their space. That still leaves plenty of opportunity to shoot each other in the face.
---
I'm quite happy just taking ihubs one at a time. Even the occasion fignt over a structure timer. Even the raiding parties going through each others space. If we could take one ihub every couple of weeks that's fine. I don't really care how many systems we take, let alone keep. I just want to get rid of the retched Cyno jammers. It sure would be nice to have a titan bridge and not have to burn 16 jumps to get to a fight.
---
I view QLPX more as six less gates I have to take. I don't see it as a need to show progress. Quite the opposite. If anything, it has slowed our progress. Moving stagings is a royal pain in the ass. I takes two to three weeks before we can get back into the full swing of things.
---
I can't speak for anyone but myself but my morale has never been low. I've never said,"Boy, I sure wish this war was over so I can get back to having to burn 40 jumps to find a fight." We were told from the start that this was going to be a long war and it has never been sold as anything but that. None of us were ever under the impression that we'd we be insmother by the end of the summer. It's always been about trying to generate as many opportunities as possible and picking the ones that most advantageous.
---
I hope to see you in space soon. I hope you don't just roll over and die. I hope you put up a good fight. I hope you stick around for a long time and we are still fighting over Detroit next summer.
---
probably, yeah.
---
the game's pretty stagnant at the moment, there aren't many moments to be relevant and those moments are often taken by the big guys.
---
Imagine nullsec if all jf pilots just went ah fuck it and stopped.
---
I don't really play the game anymore, but it strikes me now that the real pieces of shit in this game are the null blocs specifically. From my memories of playing the most fun/content I had was with small groups like DnG and Feign disorder, every experience i had in a big alliance was shit. Now that they are getting their big shiny toys taken they shedding more salt than the fucking mines of moria. There corp/allaince culture in big blocs has always been toxic as fuck, we are just the idiots spurlge on this subreddit and its glorious.
---
BTW i don't know how anyone didn't see these changes coming CCP is literally following play by play on old ex ccp employees suggestion that he posted on this very same subreddit years back. Literally he proposed the excat changes ccp has made, citadels(though not in their current exact fashion),  roqal mining, moon mining, deleting local, and yes even the fucking cyno changes. I just find it funny that everyone here is acting they are being blindsided by these changes.
---
“gain the upper hand”
---
Dont you mean upper stub in CO2’s case?
---
This is the classical response I expected.  
---
"My gameplay is no longer fun, therefore Eve needs to change so it is fun again".
---
Glad I was proven correct.
---
yep in aq 20 or 40 you can respecc for third tank but else you will be resto and use your spells to hot or give priest the mana reg :P. did it in naxx back when classic was classic, funfact not many druids where in those raid groups so i got the staff of atiesh just from dkp spending on the shards or how its spelled in english and doing the quests for it.
---
Well there's one that won't be
---
Easier than minor conduits, still difficult in a Gila/Orthrus, but no problem for a Rattlesnake. 4.5m isk for closing the conduit (3 waves), 20m+ salvage. 12 minutes per site. I ran 3 sites in 40 minutes, netted almost 100m in total. They'll also eat your drones, so as soon as they drop lock/ECM (which includes webs, guidance disrupt, target painting) from you, bring back your drones and redeploy once you're targetted again.

so why did they execute the remaining rorqs we didnt kill and kick all of them then? curious about how you're gonna explain it. i mean theres over 100 people that saw that something wasn't right, and thats not even counting in goons.
---
Well, whatever, I wasn't really looking. He was kicked for incompetence
---
his brain was so smooth that astronomers use it as a space telescope mirror
---
Didn't NC ' literally exist to kill goons'? Wish I coul find a reference to that quote...
---
and here i was thinking you actually kick people for cheating and not just because *muh killboard*
---
Everything is wh now, just with gates and infinite anoms.

Nice.

Weird flex, but okay.

when was the last time any of the entities he listed did anything of note?

How the hell was that the mining ship back in the day when it didn't exist in back in the day. The best mining Battleship forever will be the Apocalypse.

IS THAT AN ACTUAL HELPFUL ADVICE HOLY CRAP WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS SUBREDDIT
---
I've gotta hand it to you, your posting really cuts through the noise of post-cynogeddon r/eve. I know a lot of people might judge you guys for your past, but I think with a more hands-off approach to leadership, CO2 could do great things!
---
oh wow, thats not what i expected. what do you think of the dualprop fit? that and the standard MSE fit are the two that i see the most. do you fly the dram as a light tackle ship?

I HATE THAT YOU FAILED TO FIND YOUR CAPSLOCK KEY A BIT TOO MUCH AND I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT
---
if you go in there with more than 1 pilot, each pilot gets the 4,5m
---
I very much appreciate Tuz’s hard work keeping people informed with the best data we have. This trend should not ‘fall off the radar’ because it’s important for the players to have a chance to offer feedback and discuss the state of health of the game they play.  
---
I am much less interested in arguments about CCP loosing money, as they are the only ones who have access to that data.  A big company like them must have run the numbers and knows how many people are needed to ‘keep the lights on’.  Maybe that number is close to the 2008 numbers...maybe it’s not.  Not my problem.  
---
What I am less sure that CCP gets is how many people are needed, doing all the roles that this sandbox has, to keep New Eden healthy and fun.  Less and less people bothering to log in is just not a healthy sign, no matter the narrative.  It’s just not a good plan to literally turn off a large segment of PvE play.  
---
There is a tipping point someplace where the density of content and people undocked in New Eden is just too thin and everyone starts to get discouraged.  In my opinion this is actually getting close.  
---
I think this number also can vary with the general mood of the players, especially the mood of the content facilitators (FC, CCOs...).   If these people are pessimistic and feel their issues are being ignored by CCP, then you will see things trickle down to the linemen/women.  People have to travel farther for a fight, if they can find a fight. 
---
In my opinion, the mood for a large percentage of people in NS is not optimistic.  Love or hate blackout and cyno changes, a good number of people don’t feel that CCP has a coherent plan....or at least said plan is not being messaged in a coherent way.
---
Thanks for your help! I will have to do some research on the Widow! :P
---
&gt;second, how the fuck do expect a recon to counter high DPS kiting fleets
---
I'm presuming that said fleets are competent enough to drop a cyno inhibitor, so the recon/blops will need to be a ways away from the bomber fleet before they light.
---
'Cause only a moron would expect that recon to instantly decloak and light a cyno right next to the tackled rorq/super instead of waiting for the response fleet to organize.
---
Writing it funny doesn't make it any less true
---
And my comment was 14 days ago and prior to cyno changes.  Your using huge meta changes not even a day old for argument.
---
So...I'll sit here and drink my whiskey while you choke on your straw.
---
See you there!
---
It’s never been better imo. We manage to get ganks and good fights all the time now. Lots more hunters and people roaming their sov
---
how exactly can you get to this point and not understand that goons are absolutely thirsty to shoot blues, and that new rules mean new examples to be made
---
I've got one, and a super. Probably won't be subbing again any time soon, unfortunately, but I'm glad I got them before I crashed out.
---
Circle of Who?
---
Not after today
---
cant anyone from this subreddit give them a hand reforming?
---
when was the last time a self-employed entrepreneur working 24/7 did anything of note compared to a 9-to-5er office drone employed at a too big to fail multi billion company, dave?
---
This is the right attitude: Just because you're not trying to emulate PL/NC/Goons/TAPI does not mean you're doing null wrong.
---
My biggest issue that I do believe is on CCP to address, if they agree, is the ability for organizations to take control of mass swaths of space and then not use it.  But at this point, as a WHboi I'm enjoying the game with only relatively small gripes (that will be hard to change)
---
Yeah I can agree to that.
---
someone got creamed
---
i dislike the fact you found it to much lol.
---
Again, no one said my one corp is balancing out the entire blackout across null.
---
But if my small corp is getting recruits who say they're rejoining BECAUSE of the black out, then that breaks the narrative that eve is dying.
---
If anything, eve is more active now, even with fewer accounts logging in.
---
Devil's advocate. 
---
The only public folding I've seen is Iron Armada and Kenshin.
---
Both of which have or are:
---
1.  Already part of/considered part of a null block.
---
2. Trash at this game.
---
well, you're right. i'm drunk and forgot to take into account how utterly moronic goons are
---
we're not comparing line members.
---
Maybe scroll through Reddit some more to get an idea instead of asking people to take time out of their day to spoon feed you a write up.
---
They Don't have  to, all the groups you just mentioned are so turtled into their space that their supers wont leave their umbrellas.
---
Yeah I just felt like pointing out the obvious
---
Nah.
---
The old Co2 is truly a stub in the Eveonline society, which is why we are resorting to prosthetic democracy
---
There was never a point where this statement was correct.
---
Not frothing, and I appreciate the response. I simply thought your opinion a month or so ago was ill-considered and not a great thing to publish publicly when people were already telling others to quit. You upped the anti so to speak, in my opinion.
---
As for the opinion that we need intel, yes, we do, but its far too late for that now. The blackout was implemented ridiculously, leaving statistics of NPCs killed per system, player per system, jumps per gate, and everything else on the map. Pretty much favouring one side over the other. Your response favours the hunter, once again, as your "working for intel" is pointed towards ratters, most of whom are no longer ratting. 
---
One question, does the sharp nose-dive in active players not worry you that this change was far too much in such a small space of time? That CCP essentially jumped off a cliff before preparing with a parachute? Introducing an intel system, changing how map statistics work, then maybe implementing a blackout would have been optimal, or is this not how CCP works?
---
\&gt;'Cause only a moron would expect that recon to instantly decloak and light a cyno right next to the tackled rorq/super instead of waiting for the response fleet to organize.
---
You really shouldn't speak so quickly, I think your alliance is going to disappoint you.
---
Maybe if you don't like the shit posting, don't come here. Nice shit post btw.
---
I have no illusions that we won't fuck it up several times.
---
We'll figure it out quickly enough.
---
1.) fits 2.) who was piloting them. 3.) has lost 2-3 nyxes to the same people 4.) he didn't follow instructions. 5.) You didn't even get the FC right.

---
that's assuming a lot, considering its much more than just making sure liquid ozone is loaded and pressing a button. I think anything beyond pushing a button is beyond test capacities.
---
**David:** Is this real or is it a game?  
---
**Joshua:** What's the difference?
---
&gt; it's more fair to say the blackout is one of the causes than it is to deny an impact.  
---
I didn't deny an impact... Do you read?
---
Blackout, bots, pouting players, the season. All these things could be causes. You agree with me there. 
---
Attributing the decrease in players to one of these over the other is disingenuous by definition.
---
The problem is it isn't a Capital INDUSTRIAL ship, it's a CAPITAL Industrial ship.
---
According to most of the members of those groups they're all quitting, so maybe?  I mean if 3/4 of the smallest coalition quit its just small gang vs small gang then right?
---
Somebody is talking about hundreds of bots, those bots already destroyed a server and now they are shooting the inflation in tranquility...  ...and all you have to say is you are glad that CCP bans a couple alpha accounts? WOW, amazing flame.
---
I'm not sure I follow... Rorquals could jump to cynos before, now they can only jump to a cyno lit by one of two blackops-oriented combat ships.
---
A lot of high-activity Frat members that were previously based in the relatively new claim of Wicked Creek were cycled out of the area to a 'safer' staging area under the Frat superumbrella - which promptly became a main hunting ground for the usual small-gang gankers looking to catch disposable Myrm/Domi/Ishtar ratting ships and generally be annoying while they pad out their killboard.
---
Living in nullsec as a line-member in the true sense of looting, mining and manufacturing simply is not worth it, particularly if a minutes inattention can be a lossmail with far better, accessible income streams in highsec that require very little active attention for the same startup cost. No surprise that the number of people really living in nullsec has plummeted, as time goes on only the most diehard or commited are likely to live there full-time as average joe either starts spending more time on other pursuits or moves onto other games until the shitstorm finally ends.
---
If you go to dotlan right now and look at member count movements you will have a different outlook.
---
you're right, Jay isn't retarded enough to not carry enough ozone in his recon alt. very likely a different FC. nevertheless he was one of the first people to hit the grid on the drop before ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I know this is a joke, but that's actually a very serious problem with games like this.  They could just turn it off and nobody would ever be able to play again.
---
A rorq could never jump to a covert cyno
---
Okay so making the industrial cyno use 800 LO at base (400 with cyno V, 480 with cyno IV) was a real fucking dick move.
---
Now it is impossible to fit cyno modules + LO in anything but an ares and stay under 2 seconds, and thus ofc course, the ability to fit compressed industrial fits + LO + cyno mod is completely out the window.
---
What the fuck, CCP.
---
Thought we're talking about peak activity? You keep changing the goalposts pal. You're an idiot. Goodbye.
---
Literally Triggered is dead(they lost all their players months ago), Toilet Paper is essentially part of Winter Co., and I’m not sure if BSOD does anything in scalding anymore, but that may just be my timezone.
---
The blue list got so large that they had nothing left to shoot.
---
The only "fun" way to play the game of course.
---
I feel like rookie ships are an absurd example. What I want as a (relatively) independent observer is for capitals to not be the be all end all for any engagement. If we want to continue this line of thinking about rookie ships, then fine, I think that yes a capital should THEORETICALLY be able to be held down (but think old fighter mechanics, where damage isn't high from low tracking), so presumably the carrier would be able to free itself after a time. But in more reasonable terms, like a frigate or a destroyer fleet, the chance of losing that capital should be much higher. And the first response should not be to jump in carriers or supers, but instead to respond with subcapitals (the natural counter to other subcapitals). This makes for more interesting engagements in my opinion, because when capitals aren't the apex decider of a fight, there's plenty more room  for counterplay.
---
Because its a pvp game. The whole point is that when you are in nullsec you are vulnerable to pvp. And that means that there should be no way to completely deny the attackers a chance to harass the ratters without having to engage in a reasonably fair fight.
---
  I keep telling you, you listen to me more, you live longer!
---
Well, I suppose it is used for PvE activities including mining which has been deemed no longer a valid play style as it doesn't involve small gang nano HACs so I'm just glad they haven't taken them right out of the game.
---
Thanks mate, exactly the info i was looking for. Fly safe 0/
---
&gt; REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
---
INDEED
---
RE: BSOD - its your timezone. Dudes are heavy RUTZ and defend their pocket with all they got.
---
Toilet Paper isnt part of winterco, and Literally Triggered still has a lot of activity for a 65 character alliance (essentially a single corp).
---
How long before half the server forms clusterfuck coalition?
---
Because that shit was boring as fuck back then.
---
ITS A GODDAMN WINDRUNNER TORNADO
---
Check his comments history... he was born from it
---
Np also. The aesir. Is recruiting. C2-c5/null. So much fun ;)
---
Don't tell them unless you want your Rorqual destroyed
---
TAKE A STAND AND SLAP THAT HAND
---
&gt;Even though it's entirely the same thing. Except the gankers aren't cringe posting and saying 'fucking pussy cowards' when a group of procurers dock up to their PVP gang that outnumbers them 3 to 1.
---
Most of r/eve is exactly gankers cringe posting about how the sheep have it too easy and changes must be made.
---
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, and makes you age faster.
---
And nothing of value was lost...
---
Holy fuck I remember those nights.  I miss old Eve, are the changes worth coming back for?  Elo back at it and going strong?
---
can we start downvote that idiot?Thanks
---
I could argue that both of these consolidations were because of a movement towards a goonswarm style umbrella (in both GOTG and Panfam), and would have happened regardless of blackout.
---
You should probably just cut your losses.
---
Fair.
---
wtf not this again you should talk to Co2 not shit up reddit pining away for them
---
is that why you kill your own rorqs? cutting losses?
---
How do you think a battlecruiser would fare?
---
Nah, you really should be the one fucking off.
---
The praxis doesn't have enough cpu for normal fits let alone cpu intensive fits like mining lasers.
---
i think its just judges alt acc for his "judge day" that nobody gives a fuck.
---
Yeah, I mean god what sort of moaner reports numbers.
---
Like jesus, if he thought it was bad, he should keep the statistics to himself!
---
But they have no issues potentially messing up a CSM members life without proof.

all viable criticisize of the upvote brigade was downvoted to hell to weeks ago. the momentun just changed with the facts of reality hitting them in form of pcu.
---
Citation needed meightm8m8
---
"fucking moron"   I spoke about the game balance of being able to fit 50,000 people comfortable under one umbrella, not about how the one umbrella shouldn't be safe. ...   who is the fucking moron?
---
Just join the locals even if only the get your shit out
---
So you can pound freighters through to highsec and back?
---
Honestly you don’t need to take their space but if you really wanted a sov flag I could easily plant one in the void that is tribute or vale of the silent. As a matter of fact it’s mostly just NC renters there anyways so whatever.
---
The other simple solution is to go where u want and just toss down and Astra or fort and start ratting. If you want to get serious u can pop some athanors and replace them. Lot of void space and much of the systems alrdy have ihubs set up with upgrades. Nothing is stopping you from ratting in their space. You don’t have to show up to timers out of your tz and you don’t have to defend or pay for anything. People seem to think you have to own the sov for it to matter but renters have been doing this for ages. 
---
If you want pvp content then look no further than your own system for someone to shoot I guess. Or I’m sure you could poke someone in the region for the kind of fight you want. So many different options. I don’t mean to attack the null blob style but it seems to brainwash a lot of people and cause them to forget that eve was intended originally as a sandbox.
---
Sometimes it is. For example, it can be an answer to the question "How do you call intentional killing of oneself?"
---
Did u just write a "no u" response? Go hide your head in the sand a bit longer, well talk again when you regain your sense.
---
defend your shit yourself you mong
---
It's not you blithering jackass. There is a 6 light year circle in delve where there is a umbrella you toad.
---
Sounds like bait.
---
We have fought Wars over this
---
I kind of like the difficulty in finding a target and catching them, the harder the better since it's a greater sense of achievement. It shouldn't be easy to pop someone if they aren't completely useless.
---
Good luck and may you find some fun fights. But when you see that Force Recon getting close and spreading points you might want to bail.
---
But... why?
---
The playerbase that thinks oppressing content is 'winning'? Fuckin hope so.
---
Stop idolizing co2. It will never be what it was.
---
Bots get banned and when they do all of the isk is confiscated across the entire network of bots. It makes no sense to make more isk than you can sell simply to have it confiscated after a while. Supply and demand brother.
---
If you have an alt that can scan down wormholes, get a cloak and log in everyday until you see a VL hole.
---
Be sure to fit a fucking cloak, and a giant MWD so you can kinda just go from safe to safe. Try and stick to holes with VL statics and just drift until you’re in NPC 0.0 OR LS.
---
Leave the bergies alone!!!
---
Ok. No idea why someone downvoted your reply. You're in a pretty common spot for a new player.
---
The first thing you should know is that no one on this subreddit is exactly what they appear to be. I'm going to try not to generalize too much, and just say that many of the people complaining about ganks on this subreddit are coming to that point from a *vastly* different angle from you.
---
The next thing to know is that many of the lessons of surviving in space, particularly in w-space are not obvious until you hear them. If you ask politely, most of the people who kill you (in w-space at least) will tell you how they did it. From what you've said so far I can guess a couple of things that might be useful for you. Apologies if you already know this stuff. Are you going to convenient lowsec, and diving wormholes that are also conveniently close to a trade hub? If so, that is why you're getting ganked so fast. If you want to PVE on your own, you need to find places that are not heavily trafficked. A newbie friend of mine recently tried to mine in [Rancer](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Sinq_Laison/Rancer#jumps24). It did not go well for him. You might be in a similar spot. When you go wormhole-diving, are you scanning out the system and checking for wormholes to PVP groups? A lot of wormhole connections to your chosen system means a lot of ways someone could stumble through and find you. You're playing your pickup soccer game in the middle of an intersection. Find a nice cul-de-sac instead, with only the wormhole you used to enter. I hope that helps!
---
Why do you kill any of your own ships? Oh look it's Killah Pee impersonating Warped Intentions again. Lol
---
You are so hard for goons right now, aren't ya?
---
And remove Capital cap boosters.
---
He means cause they were in NS. Very few actually live in HS and those that do wont engage in the game in the same sense, meaning they wont know whos a bot and wont report it.
---
Don't forget bringing a bunch of hardeners and keeping them perma-heated. Just swap in a new one as the old one buns out.
---
no, i'm gay4jay
---
oh look, is Lowjack Tzetsu impersonating Simple Farmers. now what?
---
Why is this NSFW
---
Are you offering to give them a helping hand?
---
Because it's a hot and spicy tip.
---
Yeah that'll be worth killing in our frigates and destroyers, even if we die. :)
---
This is the kind of gameplay we can all get behind and ccp is to thank.
---
How about get rid of dockable stations in null sec and make everyone live out of pos's again.
---
How does market PvP work? It seems that for every item I look at, the sell orders are more expensive than the buy orders. Everyone says buy low sell high, but how can you do that when *all* the orders are the other way round?
---
What am I missing
---
They did, and they actually were successful. So the attackers had to call for help.
---
Wts rag with large rigs
---
Oh fuck I’m logging back in again.
---
The obvious has far too few friends in this forum.
---
What happened to the cyno 😂
---
XD i play so dangerous death to spod
---
You know I am not a goon right? 
---
If you have been playing this game long enough, if you read my name backwards you will also know I would never be a goon.
---
Lastly - Everything I have stated is my opinion and you may have your opinion. But I am not butthurt over anything as this game is simply tanking and it has nothing to do with bots..
---
Hey OP, I don’t suppose you can add cat ears and make it naked?
---
Asking for a friend...
---
and because you have no friends you seek help on reddit?
---
It's in the patch notes that black ops can use industrial cynos to - which means jumping or bridging to them.
---
So yes, I would say it is intended.
---
It's fucking horseshit that industrial cynos use **800 LO** at base though, which nearly completely deletes the ability to use a ceptor for cyno relocation (with LO + indy cyno in cargo).
---
The solution is getting rid of Hilmar and these absolutely retarded game play changes which are dunking subs left right and center. But you must be a wormholer who likes his little instance of space and is blind to the rest of what is going on.
---
i want that line engraved on the monolith we put on Pluto when humanity fucked up for good.
---
Wow. My mom is dead. Did you find her walking or just dog her up and take her with you?
---
Only he wasn't told not to undock.
---
Who are you telling to bring back Co2
---
The player dropoff will be pretty bad when people realise there is no way they can challenge Goons - particularly when Goons also realise that and start helicopter dicking all over everyone else for lulz.
---
I think we're going to need some kind of significant maintenance cost for structures and capital ships, so just maintaining an umbrella is a cost and a decision that needs to be made.
---
WTB online in $whatever TZ
---
Yeah cause killing  a bunch of their own rorqs screams *muh killboard*
---
Why would they? So CCP can confiscate the isk when the bot network gets banned? Its supply and demand, you only make as much isk as you can sell with a little with of buffer. Its a business dude, apply business thinking.
---
How do you know that? Cause from what I can tell you can just buy computing power online and not invest a single dollar into any hardware right? And even if you do it yourself I mean, its a business, as long as your making money it wont matter if you buy some more hardware.
---
And lets not forget that PLEX prices dropping means higher margins for black market isk. 
---
Dont underestimate botters man, they are a business and they are in every game. Dont treat them as shit for brains who falter just because of this or that.
---
At least we know what ship we need to primary.
---
If you include peak activity that is also lower between the hours of 18:00 &amp; 21:00 Eve time by 38% (38.1563745% to be exact) 
---
I think you are just full goon hate blind for whatever reason... But I believe in you slugger, keep on trying.
---
then you have lost so little it is un calcuable. pure cheap ass cyno alt do nothing else toons take like 1 week to train
---
Thanks both. :)
---
Without a proper reply as usual Mr Crafty. If most bots left NS for HS then you dont even know about it.
---
Free content notice. The fortizar is lost either way. I see you are part of the problem, so I say good day.
---
Hey. Darkness isn't all quitting... We're just... Umh... Shit I need to prep for evac don't I
---
In your approximation of numbers you forgot to account for the recent 5k bot accounts banned. You also didnt account for the fact FRT has more accounts banned than anyone else in their short history. Also should talk a bit about the time zone difference and how many people you all have paid to join your forces.
---
No warp to zero.
---
Everyone requires 2500 bookmarks.
---
OP said no, sorry
---
Hahahahaha oh man, hang on... hahahaha
---
Good one.
---
In a very niche market, I doubt this will "revive a dying game".
---
Co2 was gigx and gigx was co2 there is no one without the other
---
thats because red team bad, blue team good.
---
Being "fully researched" only means that further research won't improve the stats of the BPO.  You can still perform ME/TE research jobs on it.
---
Hunters don’t want a challenge.
---
They want easy kills
---
When defenders make THEM the easy kills it’s unacceptable and too “safe”
---
Yeah no. Battle rorqs are not a joke, giving them easy cyno's again beats the purpose.
---
Yeah but lets not forget jf nerfs hit smaller groups harder
---
also enjoy your 300m lowsec cynos to move ships from where you bought it to staging, while nullblocs just jump to beacons or plug in 300 dreads in their sotiyo in their staging system.
---
So someone uses a cap and it instantly dies and that somehow proves caps are still viable?
---
wut
---
Im really unsure how the change is going to stop this
---
First, gankers aren't people who try to "get kills in a battle scenario". They're the people who AVOID battle scenarios and only engage when they find an easy, low- or no-risk kill. People who aren't looking specifically for easy, risk-free aren't "gankers", they're simply "pvpers", and I don't think ANYONE has a problem with those. 
---
Second, you can't realistically compare an unprovoked attack on someone with self-defense; it's EXPECTED that when someone is threatened, they will take any and all measures to protect themselves. If you break into my house at night armed with a knife, I'm not going to grab a knife of my own and fight you in an honorable duel; I'm going to shoot your ass. Gankers crying about super umbrellas is analogous to someone breaking into your house and trying to stab you to death in your sleep, then suing you when he gets shot.
---
Finally, gankers shit talk both people they kill and people they can't kill all the time; do you even read this subreddit? The word "krab" that they applied to miners and ratters is an insult (or at least originally was...now it's basically just the default term for such players) and they regularly refer to anyone who engages in pve as "useless" and "stupid", brag about killing said players, and generally treat them in a dehumanizing manner. That's on top of the fact that their entire playstyle revolves around screwing other players over for their own benefit - sticks and stones, and all that.
---
you see, the anonymous neckbeards used to have an acronym for cases like this one, idk if they still use it. It was "NYPA" (Not Your Personal Army)
---
I appreciate reading the perspective of someone in Winter Co but I think there's a few things you overlook. The first is that cyno-jammers don't only affect the movement of capital ships but very crucially for many of the ihub engagements, especially the disastrous ones that PGL attempted, they prevent titan bridging which means the attacker has to gate into what can be a pretty damn fierce gatecamp.
---
Another point is that you call the structure seeding done by Test and Legacy into western detorid 'isk intensive' which makes me wonder if you've ever checked what most of these structures actually cost, they're astonishingly cheap for how annoying they are to kill and how much strategical flexibility they grant the owner.
---
The last point is just that you kind of have to accept that no FC in charge of anything expensive (if HACS still pass for expensive) is going to take a fight he or she doesn't think they can win. Just like it would suck for you to rush headlong into a massacre in EUTZ, Test and friends don't want to rush headlong into a massacre in CNTZ and while all the ensuing blueballs suck, it has nothing to do with courage.
---
Again.  Coward.
---
I too, am gay4jay
---
So checking the rest of thread you are actually dusregarding his opinion because he duesbt support the changes.
---
why did you invite them into your merry band of super elite spodbrains in the first place then?
---
Tomorrow started early.
---
Invalid permit
---
Actually i play all parts of the game, and shitting on a post about a returning player makes you a cancer and a big part of the problem.
---
Honestly it isn't about being an arsehole and ruining your day. Some people in Eve like shooting others and for the most part in low, null and wh that means they will likely shoot at anything not blue. 
---
You get one of two options from here. Quit, as you've said, or try and chat to those shooting at you. Believe it or not, loads of those people 'ruining your day' are likely going to be quite helpful if you ask. I know I am. 
---
If someone I just blew up reached out to me without telling me to fuck off and die, I would likely even reimburse the ship and give them useful advice. If they are even more interested I might put them in touch with my corp recruiters. I pretty much just want the corpses to add to my collection, it's not you it's me.
---
Criminal means you will get concorded
---
like, no matter how much shit i give you guys, jay is good people.
---
you know, they all had cynos
---
It duesbt say he is right it just heavily implies it.
---
Look at snuffs KB and tell me Rorqs are just for industrial uses...
---
What about hunters safety? 
---
Why should shooting someone be safer than asking for help?
---
By your own definition if “chance of getting saved” is safety frigates and cloaking devices are BEYOND brokenly safe. and microjump drives are an abomination tier safety 
---
Using your definition , of course.
---
👍🏼👍🏿👍🏻
---
&gt;someone used a cap
---
Screw that. The idea of paying rent for sov makes my skin crawl
---
Your TZ. Which matters since everything is timezone tanked when it comes to SOV. 
---
I dunno about this goons narrative. They kinda do their own thing. Dunno any backroom deals or what not and I honestly dont care. 
---
But I am glad youre having fun. In the end its content. But it has taken its toll on both groups but FRT more. Its just facts man, I dont make them and I dont like narratives. I just look at reality and Im fking happy that there is a war going on and I hope it continues.
---
you dont have to be
---
kill the other guys, then blow up the fortizar yourself
---
Someone finally fuckin said it.  Nullsecs dead and im sure it has nothing todo with goons and pets shitting on everyone with a pulse. Grr blackout or whatever
---
Fits save cargo contents when you save them.
---
No.  You see them saying “Yay i can come back now i quit but i’m back thanks ccp here i come krabs!!! “
---
They will be gone again soon enough... because between “krabs” and whiney bitch hunters
---
Krabs know how to lose and grow from it
---
You didn't see any downvotes because *they aren’t there!*
---
and it died
---
Haha turnover is good with eves massive 2%olayer retention you better not hope for to much turn over if eve is going to live.
---
Nope. They don't.
---
You create a buy order for X units of Y product for 1m isk. Someone does a quick sell of Y product and if your buy order is the current highest then you buy the product. Then you set up a sell order at the cheapest and your profit is the margin between the two. That's the very basics, I think.
---
...yes...they do...
---
At least pyfa can push them into eve and have the cargo be a part of the fit.
---
Log into the game with PI materials in your hold and save the fit. It does nothing. Also can't import PI materials into the cargo in PYFA either.
---
Snuff bait
---
Sorry about that.
---
Yeah but its just an armor timer so if the other guys are a no show in case a reddit brigade rolls in then its basically blueballs. And if we're just doing a reddit organized thunderdome then it doesn't need to be over that dudes objective.
---
Nice coding CCP.
---
So what was starting to happen long before blackout?
---
The problem is that the game does not have the standard features that would appeal to an average gamer. It is too complex and, at times, too hostile. After you have had completed the introduction, you are left to, basically, die on your own, as the game barely provides any sort of community right after the intro, which will make the players feel unincluded, or have no idea which direction to go. That is why I quit the game, because after I had been kicked from the Gallente Militia, after accidentaly activating an ECM inside a field of 250 players, who simultaneously attacked a Caldari outpost, I had attempted getting back into militia, but that would require me to do just about 100 agent missions, only so I could get enough of the missions that would give me a boost to my Gallente standing up t0 0.0. I tried playing in small corps, after scouting some wormholes, but that did not last too long. And most people, such as I, don't have the adequate time to put into playing war with major alliances.
---
Perhaps if Dust 514 had still been on the market/ expanded over to PCs, there would indeed be more players.
---
people bait all the time, if you want to discourage people from camping your systems, defend it?
---
if null is too risky for you and you dont want to adapt to it, you can bail to high sec. i've heard plenty of people talk about how they just want to do some chill PvE, surely hisec would be pretty chill?
---
and when i said move to a different area of space, i meant move, not day trip. if you and your corpmates are really struggling to make isk where you are, you can always move to a less busy region that isnt targetted by gankers as much.
---
ochre first policy is serious business
---
I don't know how to scan for pvp groups in wormholes. Travelling through every wormhole in a wormhole seems like a lot of work that doesn't sound immediately useful. Getting ganked by a pvp covcloak in a scanning frigate seems to lack any counter.. I don't even recall seeing probes on dscan. 
---
Every low sec kill has been in a pocket, or once in that area near syndicate via a wormhole bridge. 
---
My point is that I don't quite understand the mentality that in a vast universe, if you see someone, anyone, you're seconds from death.
---
theres no way of getting the pod out of ns without flying it out,best way would be to use an interceptor i think
---
Well, I would like to play it off that I meant that. But I really meant suspect.
---
Fuck bergs
---
you can't save certain kinds of items, it will only save charges and modules. So you for example can't add a mobile depot to your fit (which is obnoxious.)
---
What if a miracle happens and CCP unbans gigX tho?
---
You can be in a pod.
---
I do things for fun. I have the luxury of not needing isk. For years. But tripling my effort to spend 30 minutes having fun without 50 bombers blowing me up means I just go on fleets  instead and that fun down time is doing something else.
---
So share your zkillboard link then? Let's see how brave you are?
---
I would agree with the sentiment that CCP may not have a coherent plan - in Hilmar's own words they're going to experiment and basically throw things against the wall and see what sticks.   I think CCP is vastly over estimating the "hardcore" element of Eve online, to their detriment.  Let's hope it's reversible and you're right, they SHOULD know what the numbers are and how to pull things back before it gets out of hand.  Let's hope they do.
---
Obviously because people have a hard time differentiating hunters from 'gudfight' consensual PVPers. It's extremely rare that a response fleet with be equal to what I have on grid, so yeah I'd run too.
---
We need more posts like these, keep them coming!
---
&gt;Krabs know how to lose and grow from it
---
The amount of crying bitterness on /eve determined that to be a lie &lt;Maury meme&gt;
---
What chaos dude? Where are you seeing this chaos? Just because something is chanted doesnt make it true. This is just boring, not chaotic. This is quite literally the opposite of chaos. 
---
No one should care what they lose, its a game. The less people care the less risk averse they are. Which means more content all around. 
---
Yet again, its not chaos if it only affects one group and is just plain fking tedious.
---
You guys didnt record this? Are you crazy?
---
Just look at how much the login events have done in the past and compare it with the last ones. If you subtract the previous increases it really shows how fked this shit has been.
---
People
---
if u just want to shoot at some rats and money isnt a problem, then going out in a cheap disposable ship and getting low ticks shouldnt be a problem?
---
Yes its quite handy
---
cause we already got a titan fight this year ? titan only jump when they are 2x their number and more fax it's not a fight but an extermination
---
No you don't. You can accept corp invites from space while you are in the escape pod.
---
Looks like you may have found a purged a few botters?  
---
In any case, well done.
---
&gt;thats because ~~red team~~ Upton Sinclair bad, blue team good.
---
Being blown up 10 minutes after undocking in a pve ship while 10 to 50 nerds yell good fight doesn't rank high on my list of fun to do things. You?
---
No its just more boring. You are literally explaining what tedium is, do more to maintain same level.
---
Maybe you shouldn't be the... Judge of that?
---
Oh no that's what I'm saying man, reach out and just... Have a chat. I've met some of my best eve friends doing that after they shot at me. New Eden is a harsh place, but it can be a lot of fun if you find the right people/ place for you.
---
Every post you make just gets dumber lmao. What an embarrassment
---
*Completely unrelated* question: Who wants to form to kill a Rorq with me?
---
Yup, but I have no docking rights at the citadel where it is. Looking to figure out how to move the clone elsewhere so that I can jump to it and fly it back to high sec.
---
In 18 months from now you mean? When the chaos stuff is done? Who the fk is gonna be around to do it?
---
Well said and facts
---
reforming co2 without gigx would be like reforming NSYNC without JT
---
This is gonna be some mexican standoff scene from an old western
---
its always the guys doing the lowest damage getting the kill marks. step your game up.
---
Get a new graphics card.
---
3.6 rontgen... not great, not terrible
---
No means no
---
&gt; and the cap supremacy to cyno in early and hold any grid they want, cuz goodluck escalating with these changes
---
so just like yesterday?
---
I've noticed that the people in smaller alliances don't seem to be complaining, mostly just big coalition line members on Reddit claiming to speak on behalf of smaller alliances which they've never been part of.
---
Literally just use imgflip. Even that is a better tool for making memes than MS Paint.
---
I mean, jesus. GIMP is free.
---
the grind hopefully...
---
I already miss that network:(
---
That was my first thought, but then I remembered that my graphics card is less than a year old and Eve while docked is the only game I have issues with.
---
Hey you should sober up and maybe get some help you're coming off pretty angry dude
---
Fingers crossed that you make s full recovery mate. 
---
As someone with eye issues (partially sighted in 1 eye) I feel for you dude.
---
TIL small corps and solo players have super umbrellas.
---
No, but you can keep a recon cloaked and drop infinite caps on a moment's notice, which is even better.
---
Yeah, but this is a game, not a fucking real life or death scenario. 
---
In a game, its more fun to have a knife fight.
---
You know it's bad when a player like me who's best character is a measly 5mil SP of mostly 'right now do this skill' can look at this fit and go... 'Goons."
---
Game over
---
I mean...
---
the joke is that all null bloc members are crying on reddit for ages on how all these changes hurt the little guy while at the same time mega dunking anyone that shows up for anything with titans
---
That sounds a lot like F1 online though. I've done that content.
---
"This one person wasn't instantly permabanned immediately after one report so clearly CCP is doing ***absolutely nothing*** to deal with bots!"
---
It's not like banwaves or taking time to investigate reports are things.
---
I spent like 500m over market value for my large rigged supers back in 2013 or so. Totally worth it, it's better KM bling when they finally die than most officer mods.
---
This will be the strangest thing I've masturbated to today
---
Embarassment for who exactly? You might have noticed i don't give a shit otherwise i wouldn't keep posting with a horde of mad bees downvoting each of my comments in here lmao
---
Game. Hobby. RL ? 
---
Plz hlp
---
I mean, r/eve threw him under the bus without a second thought on the merest accusation and downvoted into oblivion anyone who so much as suggested that there was something iffy about the whole thing, so maybe that's the pot calling the kettle black.
---
Those threads also made it to the front page and had more upvotes than downvotes.  Reddit did advocate for it, and now a different part if Reddit is bitching about it.  It’s almost as if there’s multiple groups on reddit fighting to control the narrative or something.
---
I mean, i'm not the one awoxing my own members ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
the elusive covops hic/dictor
---
while i appreciate your attempt at narrative, please don't think the majority of eve players are as dumb as your mouth-breathing circle.
---
check the economic reports. blackout is good.
---
It's the inability of small alliances to defend their members that kills them; not their ability to defend their alliance as a whole.  It's very easy to say "members leave small alliances and join big ones, so larger alliances are killing small alliances", but that's only if you ignore logic and refuse to put any actual thought into the problem.
---
People leave smaller alliances and join the larger groups because that's pretty much the only feasible way to operate in nullsec - grouping a bunch of people together in null without a super fleet to protect them is like setting up a giant neon sign that reads: FREE KILLMAILS HERE. The members of said alliance then proceed to get farmed constantly by "elite pvpers" looking to pad their killboard stats, until they get fed up with it and move to a larger entity that can actually protect its members. 
---
While some of these ganks will likely come from larger alliances, their participation is by no means required to tear a small nullsec alliance apart - the promise of easy killmails is an irresistible lure for the legions of "elite pvpers" in EVE, and those gankers require no overarching organizational structure to make life hell for anyone without a super umbrella. Just like in an actual sandbox, the effort required to kick over a sandcastle in EVE is FAR less than the effort required to build one up.
---
The ability to provide a reasonable degree of safety from ganks is a requirement to run a stable nullsec alliance, and the blackout made that FAR more difficult, if not virtually impossible. Continuing on the current course will simply result in nullsec being dead, many of the players who lived there leaving the game, and even less content being available than when the nullsec empires were able to operate under their super umbrellas. 
---
What CCP and the blackout supporters don't seem to understand is that you CANNOT force someone to log in, undock, and feed killmails - preventing them from playing the game with any degree of safety simply forces them to choose between feeding killmails and not playing. If you want to create a more target-rich environment where more kills are available, you need to increase the number of targets by attracting more players to the game. Trying to force the dwindling number of remaining players to die more often is only going to diminish the playerbase even further, resulting in a downward spiral of lost players and reduced content.
---
Wasnt a thought at the time. Rex and I were just thinking "Dont let him catch on..."
---
The game is tanking because players don't like to have risk in null. You can blame the blackout for that, however I'd rather blame the players for not understanding how this game works. I agree, if you spent years building an empire with zero risk and CCP changes that overnight who wouldn't be upset. But the game changes all the time and people adapt. They don't whine. Players quitting are not the kind of players I want in this game. That's my opinion. 
---
And for the record, saying 50% when the facts are 20% is not your opinion. It's a gross exaggerated lie. But I guess a Goon wouldn't know the difference.
---
as long as the cloining bay is still online you should be able to jump into the clone and pilot it out
---
So the best solution is to get a jitaceptor and pack it in the nearest station you can dock in, then jump clone into the expesnove clone and fly it to where the jitacepter is parked
---
If it's true what they say in here they literally had no idea and just accidentally purged that botter (or input broadcaster) which is quite funny. Whatever the reason though it's a good thing.
---
F   to my subscription
---
Unless you can convince the owner of the citadel to let you dock, you’re out of luck (and even if you do they will probably just shoot you on the undock). There is no way to move a clone except flying it yourself.
---
Funny. I seem to remember far more fights where WC out numbers legacy in an actual fight. But wWC seems to be far more intent on keeping us out of a fight, with cyno hammers and massively camped Enterance gates then fighting us with a numbers advantage. 
---
I recall a fleet a few months ago with even numbers and horde burn I got down from drones and WC didn’t take the fight.
---
When you make changes that only autists can enjoy, you only get autists playing it.  Who knew?
---
Sure, bring back co2, then we can go and just rofl stop them out of existence yet again
---
well something changes, it sounds like the opportunity to gank him while ratting is now gone entirely meaning less content for everyone who tries to kill krabs.
---
And if you can’t dock, you probably can’t clone there either
---
Yeah. We should be making them rent highsec.
---
So your dumblord FC got DD'd and somehow thats Frat's fault? ok
---
nothing like sub-optimal ratting/mining for hours only to have no one try and take the bait.
---
\+1 (agreed) for delete of FaX&gt;  
---
I'd add in some others to delete but, I'm sure neither will happen
---
Look at Dotlan, and the other data points with regards to productivity in all nullsec regions. The data doesn’t lie.
---
You want to be able to glance at an automated text feed that tells you the second danger arrives or login and teleport your death machine across the Galaxy in seconds, while the Hunter has to come into your safe blue space... and *you're* the one 'making things challenging'?
---
no
---
Goons aren't elitist. Everyone can get in if they aren't known cunts. Of course that means sometimes people turn out to be complete shitters. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
anything by democracy is a bad idea.
---
now that's just embarassing
---
&gt;People have confirmed
---
"people" ? Are these the same idiots on reddit that seem to have forgotten the ban wave from jan-jun that wiped out 22,000 accounts yet the massive drop in numbers didn't start til July, which coincidentally was a full month before the August ban wave that supposedly caused that drop? Its like the people blaming the loss of players on bans can't read a calendar or something.
---
Try your math again. From August 2018 to August 2019. 
---
High sec activity down 4.2%
---
Low sec activity down 9.4%
---
Null sec activity down 19.7%
---
Overall activity down about 10%
---
Dotlan stats.  Activity shifting from null to high sec. Players leaving for risk fee gameplay. Players and bot quiting. 
---
Bottom line. This game is better without you. Leave.
---
[Nidia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cpxkes/horde_gate_behavior/) probably wishes he had the ISK to afford to do that. Is there a three-strikes rule, or do you just kick them afterward?
---
It’s funny that you bought that up, my cyno went down 2-3 mins before the bomber gang dropped and killed me and the bovril qual (he got dank mittani bux srp) and I said when I lit it that I would need to refuel it after it goes down, caught at a bad time sadly
---
Yes but the drummer had TALENT.
---
It's the only thing that makes eve worth playing apparently.
---
That wasn't ugly it was BEAUTIFUL!!!
---
I don't think anyone is claiming that they are exclusively for industrial use, and even T1 indys can be fit for combat.
---
Ship girls!
---
I can confirm that you can't clone jump to a citadel that doesn't allow you to dock. :P
---
And here I was expecting stuff about corpses
---
I mean, an orca can't fit a cyno anymore. Complain about industrialists all you want, but without them you don't get to have ships and cool toys to welp.
---
CCP was owned by a finance company prior.
---
Or have a shipping service drop one off at citadel you are stuck in.
---
I mean putting capitals on field as well as capital bait is not exactly risk free. Yea sure most people will scout stagings for the targets activity but you never know what's going to show up when the cynos go up. I think that's a lot of the fun with hot dropping and baiting...sometimes you catch a fish but there are sharks in that water too.
---
no, they "NEED to die asap", apparently...
---
Small alliances grabbing more systems because of crying carebears, Hmmmm... for more room to grow and become a.... large alliance. But then you will become the victims of CCP nerfing. Then it's not fair.... wait a minute, what just happened. What a vicious cycle.
---
This isn't anime, anime is known for big eyes and simple facial features. This is for more pin-up territory than anime. It is also very well done, great work.
---
And got sold out again? Sign me in
---
Remember if anyone plays the game in a different manner than yourself, they a wrong.
---
our hope is that all the current big null blocks unsub, then Eve can rebuild properly  :-)
---
If you have an alt or a friend, have them bring a shuttle ceptor to that system. They should be in an empty clone.  Find a time when activity is low for that citadel. Fleet up with that alt/friend. Undock, warp to your alt. Alt ejects from ceptor. You get in. Go where ever you want. 
---
Be fast about it. Watch out for smartbombing battleships. Have your alt/friend scout the station before you undock for anything suspicious.
---
You'd think the krabbers would be grateful for such a big brain move by ccp
---
Im afraid that decision is out of our hands.
---
lmao holy cow
---
If most people protested out in the streets about government as much as half of the eve players protest playing eve... we might actually see some change.
---
already started down scaling und unsubing alts
---
Do such services exist? Why would anyone ship stuff for neutral characters to null? The shipping services in my region refuse to do that.
---
he was on his 11th strike
---
And people that don't want to fight you is not worth keeping
---
Here are some crabby stats...
---
June 2019 - null npc kills **176mil** / high sec npc kill **88mil**
---
Aug 2019 - null npc kills **66mil** (-110mil) / high sec npc kills **120mil** (+32mil)
---
We lost 110mil npc kills from null and gained 32mil npc kills in high sec. 
---
Conclusion: bots and players who enjoyed risk free null sec kills are now moving to where they belong.
---
That's the point. OP is complaining about something that has been happening in EvE since day 1
---
If all you do is ask krab or rat, whats the point of it being an online game at all. Let's just make eve offline
---
Ye gods.
---
wtf
---
didn't someone already make a post similiar like this a week ago?
---
Black Frog has a large group of places they ship to, along with several others. I can't remember the name, but there is a neutral group that delivers to 1DQ in Delve.
---
he downvoted me
---
Can't complain, if you don't play any more.
---
F. Thought it was bait tbh and were slightly amused when we noticed the lack of ozone.
---
Also why would you srp bovril krabs of all people? &gt;.&gt;
---
People are beginning to agree. Game is ded. lol 21k peak today, like just shut it down already.
---
it’s a sad day when slowcats were unironically better than the super and titan spam we have now
---
Sure you can. Just look at r/Eve for a bit.
---
400? You know TEST can field more than that.
---
* No warp-to-zero
---
* Total content being pvp, mining, missions and beltratting
---
* no jumpclones
---
and so on and so forth.
---
Eve really wasn't all that great in the beginning.
---
whoa thats awful elitist of you
---
They were? We did? lol
---
Are caps supposed to be invincible?
---
What? Frigates are literally everywhere in lowsec and nullsec
---
What did he do exactly? Aside from not read patchnotes and undock to kill a site?
---
buy the  ore mining lasers then.....
---
You're advocating for the way capitals used to work, and it's just not exciting gameplay.. your carrier shouldn't be useless vs smaller shit. It devalues caps to the point of obscurity. Why buy one at all for anything besides strat ops. Is that engaging gameplay?
---
Thanks for the taxes we took from you, now die, fren.
---
Oh look, someone will have to mine much more moon goo in Aridia now!
---
Working as it should it seems.
---
&gt; PS. Test nerds spamming Tienanmen Square related shit in pub chats to try and get fellow Eve players thrown off the internet OR EVEN ARRESTED is just... wow, I can't even. That's past toxic into actual evil. Serious question, w in t actual f?
---
as a chinese person i find this incredibly funny ngl
---
Autism doesn't necessarily mean stupidity.
---
Please don't compare autistic people to these "elite pvpers"; it's very unfair to the former.
---
🤣
---
Cloaking tweaks
---
Not as biased as you'd expect for someone involved in the conflict, an overall good read.
---
that's generous
---
Yeah I just did 2 sites and only got like 15mil in salvage, and had to warp out a few times. Looks like you get about 300 DED LP for it too. I'll be doing something else in EVE.
---
I'm already down to 2 subs from 4 and I suddenly find I have time to enjoy the latest expansion for FF XIV which is a lot better than I thought it would be and classic wow is actually fun and as an added bonus I only need one account to enjoy playing either game. Depending on how stupid this next "make it easier to betray your corp mates and rob you alliance" change hilmar is talking up turns out to be that might be it for me.
---
given your older complaints it seems like your next proposal
---
does that mean i get an ISRAD vouch?
---
This reminds me of an encounter I had on ark with a bored griefer. He started to perma sleep troll me, so I decided I was done with the game but figured I would demolish my base to clean things up. Guy starts begging me not to do that, asking why on Earth I would clear my base, and that he was just having a bit of fun. As if being on the receiving end of his shit was fun for both of us.
---
I wonder if they ever reflect on what hand they had in things as they remain the biggest fish in their increasingly smaller and smaller pond.
---
wat?
---
That guy was killed and kicked on purpose
---
Older complaints like what? That CCP have shit the bed on most of their ideas with changes to the game?
---
Correction, they're annoying you into unsubscribing. They correct exactly the issues they were meant to tackle
---
Mate you don't have to deepthroat TEST this hard on reddit to apply, just send the app in...
---
Goons win.
---
^wooosh
---
Try 1.8b every month
---
no your posting isn't bad enough yet
---
Walking in stations?
---
Grr gons hat gons
---
Yep, and I think that if the game lasts long enough, that theme will continue until we see legacy turn into just TEST, Panfam turn into just Horde and Imperium into just Goons before this is all over with all their coalition partners just WIdoting into the main alliances. The more CCP tries to actively discourage big groups by targeting large groups with changes  the bigger the groups will get in an attempt to avoid the downside of the changes.
---
It's a giant echo chamber for these idiots. Blackout has been nothing but good times for any small pvp group.
---
You're really going nuts over this botting thing. Do you expect me to fly around delve scrutinizing every group of Rorquals for signs of EULA breaches? If you think he was broadcasting, just report him, I don't care.
---
they tried, but hilmar fat fingered the drop down and they deleted the playerbase by accident instead.
---
Great idea lets do it.   
---
All we have to do is:   
---
1) Use battle-industrials to light initial cyno  
---
2) Jump in the Rorquals  
---
3) Ghost-ride into your Recon  
---
4) Light real cyno  
---
5) ???  
---
6) Profit
---
They never should have taken carriers rep bonus away, as bad as people thought it was back then creating dedicated logi caps with even better bonuses than the old carriers is worse.
---
Just means you add about 300-400m to the cost of content...most groups who seek this type of content will only be inconvenienced a bit but the cost addition is really a drop in the bucket compared to what's being dropped or killed. I expect nothing will really change at that level...well aside from recon builders making more isk.
---
Popular opinion: stop posting
---
i agree because nobody gonna risk said ship unless strong backup fleet is on standby...
---
also DST properly fitted can be  good  BAIT
---
How romantic
---
Well duh, seriously... doing nothing would mean bot farm havens and afk VNI ratting everywhere. People love playing Eve risk free making a ton of wealth, but hey it's only a problem when players have to actually work for it take a risk. You muppets forgot what Eve was meant to be. I consider this era the "trimming the fat" era. Getting all those useless players to leave as we slowly build back a better Eve.
---
Btw, Mittens looks like a douchenozzle.
---
I mean, any group worth their salt has the actual critical assets held in alt-corps.
---
Saving/Bank Corps, Capital/Supercapital Corps, Keepstar Corps. Even if there was a 1% chance that a random person got gifted director roles for a day, they'd only be able to take the Random Ships hangar (for things that are for day to day use, and for corp FCs to use), the liquid isk stored in the wallets (which is the monthly spending isk), or unanchor structures (and critical structures are usually held by another corp entirely).
---
The space won't be freed up, it just won't be home to stations used as anything more then tether spots. Goons for example won't drop sov in any of their space, they will just move literally every single asset they have to 1dq1 and base every sub, cap and super in that system preventing anyone from ever actually being able to take their stuff.
---
Wait, so all we need to do is change the game so all of the old rich, toxic, entrenched, asshole leadership quit? Then we get a server wipe? I love it!
---
Lowsec triglavian invasion definition was added to SISI a bit ago.
---
Meanwhile our 2 dude corp grew into a 50 dude alliance over the past 2 months. It's perfectly possible to grow as a small group under the changes, just need to be willing to put in the effort.
---
 The fact that every alliance has a one or two region buffer from any credible threat means travel is just autistic at this point for anything other than bombers tbh. Before drifter wh changes I couldn't be bothered to hunt. No one wants to travel 30+jumps one way to maybe get a fight. Risk aversion lead to massive blocs, that lead to arms race, that lead to buffer zones, that lead to bordem when you throw in the removal of any real conflict driver (thanks citadel's and tz tanking)
---
Combat that can tank a fleet and murder caps?
---
I like watching my grandmother chew veldspar in highsec, that's the point. Fuck you and your gaming preferences.
---
There are salty goons. There are goons who don’t really give a shit. There are goons who have already figured out ways around it. It’s almost like we’re a large, diverse group of people or something.
---
Eve went green. We installed co2 scrubbers to help cut down emissions
---
50 no's and a yes still means yes
---
we're seeing it right now, multiple small groups have moved into tribute but there is next to no infrastructure going up and any time they undock anything of a meaningful size someone, not just goons, drops on it and nukes it. Remove asset safety and instead of dropping when they undock we'll just start knocking over stations they base their assets in because why not bash a station if it turns into a loot pinata when it dies? No need to take their space or bash their ihubs, just pop the station grab the loot and go home, takes 2-3 fleets over a week or two per station, you wouldn't even need to deploy your alliance to do it.
---
I don't have any input on the topic, but I would like to mention that hooolyyy shit we live in the future: a completely blind guy can participate in a steam chat and properly communicate with other viewers. This is amazing and I am happy to know that's a thing. Surely there's a long road ahead for people like Sergey to become as functional as us lucky ones, but my point is that technology allows for incredible solutions and sometimes it does feel like magic. 
---
Best of luck Serёzha, I hope CCP addresses your concerns soon.
---
oh yeah bling out your already dead ship
---
Nice self defeating argument.
---
You’re an idiot. Eve was meant to be a sandbox for all play styles, not just your acceptable play styles. There is nowhere, undocked/untethered in Eve that is risk free, even though you probably think there is. 
---
Enlighten me what Eve was meant to be, explain how there will be content when production slows down to a crawl and minerals dwindle.
---
i was actually only half joking. it´s pretty obvious at this point that eve is going into maintenance mode and the vast majority of space is just a waste of resources. shrink the playerbase down to non casuals and whales. then delete plenty of of fucking empty space and sell the shards on ebay. reduce maintenance costs and the fucking power bill. maintain the same profits with 80% of the corporate assets. you empire builders are fucking toast tbh. that´s what i would do. god bless.
---
The super umbrellas are largely untouched. They just require a few more skills on the alts. Doesn't affect the umbrella at all.
---
We did. The funny thing about the whole thing was that we noticed him broadcasting (or a disfunctional bot. 4 rorqs paniced at the exact same time, 2 not at all despite being in range for whatever reason) then getting chased away from the remaining ones just to watch goon supers jump in and kill the remaining ones and noticing how the guy got kicked right after.  
---
Since we did in fact have a spy in fleet the assumption that it was a goon one that had relayed what that guy was doing was the most obvious one.  
---
After all you guys did claim on several occasions that if you find out about stuff like this it will be dealt with internally.
---
Like really. Unless they're coming into delve..  we don't really blob small alliances unless they're affiliated with ncpl. If they're coming into delve... Well, they should know what to expect
---
I heard dreddit is recruiting
---
This exactly, once a newbro finds how many months it takes to fly a capital, it becomes another dropout. The idea of using big supercap fights for bringing new players is stupid.
---
I would agree.  
---
Eve strikes me as a very delicate game for a number of reason.  No new players. Overtly reliant on ‘old’ players who often have carved out niche game play they like.  Complex economics and markers that require the coming together of lots of different gameplay.  
---
Lots of reasons that support car and communications with the player base.
---
We literally had that war last year, "the rest of them" did so badly the next time there was a war, they just packed up their shit and left.
---
Ok... But that doesn't make them a small alliance. And when in the history of eve, have there actually been independent small alliances in sovnull
---
So you're saying there's a chance
---
Best way to fix large blocs is to make it extremely hard to have sov in more systems. Make costs of maintaining sov scale exponentially the more blues and the more members you have as an alliance. 
---
Also reduce reinforcement timers if there are more blues and more members.
---
In general. You wanna be as small as possible. Have as few friends as possible except those you really want and need.
---
Now do that. And there is actual chaos.
---
Sean Connery James bond would like to think so
---
No they are supposed to die to a small gang of frigates.
---
Why did Industrial cynos get increased to 800 LO at base?  
---
When they were first on sisi, in late August, they had 500 LO at base, like normal cynos.  Somewhere CCP increased it to 800 LO and no one noticed.
---
Requiring 160-192m3 of LO negates the ability for someone like a PushX or Black Frog employee to travel between null-sec systems in a travel ceptor with LO and cyno modules in cargo. 
---
I feel like some newsletter went out to all the Goons to have them spam post about how disturbing the trends are, the blackout sucks, Eve is dying, blah blah. Whoever can cry the loudest will make the most waves. If CCP is listening... Goons don't speak for Eve. Ignore their whines being sent from their puppet master.
---
You can't put a recon in a rorq
---
so then it would just become T3C online instead of stealth bombers online.
---
&gt; Toilet Paper isnt part of winterco, and Literally Triggered still has a lot of activity for a 65 character alliance (essentially a single corp).
---
TP shares space with FRT(TP TCU/FRAT IHUB) with what I assume is blue standings as they don’t shoot each other and have participated with FRT for defensive and offensive timers, so Perhaps I should have said they are WinterCo aligned, as I don’t know the exact details of their agreement. What’s left of LTRIG has not been very active in scalding, possibly due to loosing all their corps, although the remaining members do participate in Winterco fleets.
---
BSOD holds several moons in FRT space, seemingly unmolested, so there must be either an agreement is some sorts, or FRT just doesn’t give a shit as they’d rather just farm burner missions in Curse and run them in Scalding.
---
I’m not trying to argue the nuances of space politics, just my perspective from being on a content deployment in Scalding Pass the past 3 or 4 months.
---
Shhh, we don't use facts and lofic here
---
well their devs are too busy redesigning the NPE for the 4th.. or 5th time in a row so it needs to be a nice effortless change on their end.
---
All my cyno toons are going to have a prospect. Light covert, jump more LO in a BR with a tayra inside, dock up, change to the T1 Indy, light Indy cyno, get killer, respawn there. It’s cumbersome. 
---
I don’t mind making logistics a little harder. But this definitely needs tweaking.
---
That's actually believable at this point.
---
&gt;no edgelords crapping on people just to do it  
---
&gt;*real shit talking 
---
Seems a bit contradictory doesn't it?
---
Well thats not too bad.
---
There’s no way you aren’t a TEST alt RPing just to make their opposition look bad.
---
&gt;maintain the same profits
---
can't really do that with 30% of the accounts already gone and more leaving every week.
---
What do you intend to do with stations that do not have industry for you to build your tayra?
---
Oh I don’t build anything. Import everything.
---
sure you can if you reduce the power and HR bill by 60% in the process.
---
SIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

Just wanted you to enjoy the dead Rorqs

hes not the only one.  someone in horde had blue haze over like 3/5ths of his screen
---
How do you intend to fit a 20,000 m3 tayra into the cargohold of a BR, of which the max m3 of a Crane is just over 12,500 m3?
---
All speculation, admittedly. 
---
It's interesting that Mitten's would even need to say that. It's almost as if there was a boycott. One so ingrained and important that people would feel the need to shit on someone not joining in on it. 
---
Interesting indeed.
---
\*200\~ goku bombers and some caps?
---
Inb4 Serenity 2.0
---
And that is why him even talking about making it possible to rob alliances and corp with less effort makes me nervous, he would have to come up with a way for you to rob those alt corps without being in them for this idea to be even remotely possible. Which given his current approach to just taking a sledge hammer to the game and calling it "chaos" seems entirely plausible.
---
Being in a smaller alliance, I can say the blackout has been the best thing for Eve in a long time. The VNI change just made people switch to Myrms, the cyno change will have a small temporary effect, but it's for the greater good. 
---
I've logged more hours during the blackout than before. It's the logical way null should be.
---
well he already too a chainsaw to the game, why not the staff too?
---
I don't know what that means
---
Fuk forgot that. Bleh then. Import the tayras using a DST I suppose.
---
because they need to develop and maintain more profitable ventures like p2w eve on mobile.
---
It is not a lie.. it is fact.
---
I think it is comedy you think I am a goon.. :P
---
Good point. Lets just all use battle Rorqs then.
---
Big difference between intelligently talking smack to &amp; about opponents and someone just hurling insults/vulgarities that make them sound like a 15yo Call of Duty player.  The player base here is smarter than that
---
Oh. You mean the rorquals that were killed by goons for being complete shut fit? I totally did enjoy seeing those. Idiots who cant fit correctly should be blown up. Man you really are a shit troll. Keep practicing. You'll get it.
---
Additions? They focus more on subtractions, like removing the permalink to Item Hangar and Ship Hangar on the neocom. Fuck the "inventory" shitmenu.
---
holy fuck this subreddit is actually turning into a 60 year old's facebook
---
Dunno about that either. Maybe better to see capital logi go out altogether, perhaps with a buffer increase
---
Correct, the changes were trying to make it more difficult and more expensive to move caps around.
---
Goons literally put out the word to dock Caps in light of these changes and then the goonhammer dropped in to whore on ships that bombers bar was already pushing in.
---
loling at goons ordering Caps to be docked
---
Death to all supers
---
this is my dream future tbh
---
You do know Abys bots are a thing right. I have been running one for months now... Bots have just adapted you fucking retard. 
---
If you had been paying attention to this sub you would know that.
---
Weirdly enough, this keeps your members hostage to the abuse.... Somehow.
---
Correct.  CCP stated they did not want to unduly influence JF logistics with the change that limited fitting the cap-only cyno to recons and blops.
---
And yet here we are.
---
Furthermore, JFs are not capitals. They do not require the capital ship skill, they have always been able to take gates, they can take gates in HS, and they can dock in medium structures - all things true capitals cannot do.
---
I mean, it was cancerous because only two groups in the game could use them and they were blue to each other. Now with capital proliferation the way it is, oldschool slowcats wouldn't be so bad now.
---
Well, I was speaking more on meta gaming, and less overt operations. An example being: 
---
Taking to reddit in droves to downvote propaganda from war targets (very common and lovable, really). 
---
Demoralizing war tactics used on enemies to disrupt their will to fight, even if it makes the individual goons play less fun. Its for a goal and therefore a sacrifice ready to be made in order to win a war.
---
Burn Jita, to disrupt markets for profit. 
---
My point was essentially that they are well organized and definitely unified in purpose. Infact, saying, "Just dont play eve for a bit, CCP thinks with their wallet" isn't even that inconvenient, and well within the realm of possibility.
---
This photo just makes me want to pluck out every stupid orange hair on his face, then dye his hair pink.
---
This just in: they are all goons
---
sorry not very knowledgeable yet about this..  1 min bastion means you activate a bastion module, which makes your resistances better for a minute or it takes one minute to fully activate once you land and its indefinite until you turn off? 
---
I assume a gang can still gank you ?
---
Also when you say "MJD on"... when you initiate the microjump.. it just stays on pending the bastion shutting off? so once you stop the bastion it insta warps you 100km away? Seems like it'd be easy for a gang to assume you're about to do that.. but I think I get it.  What happens if they scram you the moment bastion turns off? 
---
Apologies I'd really love to understand this mechanic :)
---
Then why has TEST lost more supers in Eso since blackout than they lost in the entire year prior
---
I think it would be a fair change considering how many years they sat in a boosting POS.
---
Because cherry picked, average stats means fuck all.
---
The mobile game is being developed by a completely different company last I heard, they were just using the IP that CCP gave them access too.
---
Less people in null is not necessarily a bad thing. The kind of players leaving null is a great thing. These players that either moved to high sec or quit completely basically wanted a risk free isk machine. Those who have stayed are the pilots I want to fly with.
---
The current null situation will eventually balance itself out. Null will slowly get the players willing to take the risk. Alliances will look to consolidate, which will send other alliances out to grab territory. This will hopefully bring back some conflicts. Coalitions will see that blue-ing every ship in the galaxy just stalls content. Hopefully, alliances will withdraw from coalitions and create targets for themselves. 
---
That's my theory anyway. CCP knows this... they see the stats, and they know Eve needed a shake up. I'm prepared to be here every step of the way. Leaving now just shows me you weren't willing to take the risk.
---
"clan" REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
There's no way you are actually in Brave.
---
&gt;about 5 years too late 
---
pretty standard release time table for this game.
---
how can it die when theres hundreds exhumers much more juicy than domi or vindi
---
Test server is for testing, not for giving you a sneak peak before changes hit.
---
but then what purpose will my private, alts only channel motd have?
---
Doesn't look like it.  For someone's nameless alt you sure you didn't already win eve?  3 years in the NPC corp might have gone to your head.
---
That's slightly muddled by the fact that wormholers fly more expensive ships on average than nullseccers, but yeah.
---
The bad ones do.
---
Aaaah i thought so. I remember its been a subject since at least 2017 but i never heard what hapened with the project. Id say, make a serie with it, netflix, amazon prime, youtube red, whatever. Everyone is now producing series and im pretty sure theres enough material for a quick 8-12 episodes season.
---
ah, banter then, not shit talking... i mean, some edgelord statements also fall under the umbrella of shit talking.
---
er no, otherwise they would be GewnsDot not NancyDot.
