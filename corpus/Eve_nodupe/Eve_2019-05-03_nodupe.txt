My cumulative numbers look slightly different to yours, but paint the same picture: https://imgur.com/a/vl58rll
---
(Mostly down to fitting choices of triple sink Drekavacs but dual sink Ikitursa in my analysis)
---
I think the key thing, just from a damage perspective (forgetting range etc.) is that if you kill a target and deal less than ~345k damage per ship, you would be better off in a Drekavac than an Ikitursa. 
---
**345k per ship**, I'm sure there are very few targets where you get the chance to deal that much damage per subcap.
---
Internet is too stable I take it
---
Minor counterpoint though: when against an active tanked ship, your total damage in earlier stages doesn’t mean much if you never exceed their active repping power. So in those instances total damage done will still only be relevant after the point where your dps beats out their reps per second. 
---
So there are times where the higher dps potential may be your sole concern, despite lower overall damage done.
---
CCP used to be ran by a finance corporation btw... But hey they're better than a gaming company right?

---
Killing some HS indy corp's Athanor or a LS pirate's Astra would give you some isk, but maybe not something worth a big group's time. 
---
At least nothing compared to killing a big NS alliance's staging Keepstar.
---
If you google yulai incident or yulai massacre you can find videos from the ancient times (2004) and articles written about it by much more eloquent people than me.
---
CCP were not happy when it happened, since Zombie refused to stop the killing of all traffic going through Yulai, but these are like 3rd or 4th generation CCP employees that are parading the mass banning of Zombie Inc like some fun ingame event.
---
I went through the list - briefly, i'll check every track more intensive after sleep - but i don't think it's listed there.

Maybe it's part of the dynamic music?

I should upgrade mumble....
---
Time to catch up to Drek with 10% per spool is approx 49 seconds or 15 cycles.
---
It will still kinda suck even with the proposed change, but it'll suck a hell of a lot less.
---
:big_thonk:
---
So CCP abandoned drifter incursions hoping this one won't go Haywire
---
There are regions outside of Provi?  Who knew??
---
This is not remotely dumb
---
Probably the batteries lol... But if it works
---
Revenge for AT XV!
---
I'd be fine with that
---
At least the gnosis is fun to whelp
---
Ok, but... so what?   CCP is a business.  Businesses operate in a certain way so they make money so they can stay in business.  They pump their numbers, we get free junk, everyone moves on.
---
So 30 years ago people defied authority and were punished by those authorities. Today we have Eve on line players that defy authorities to play. Are you the type of person that rings the authorities to tell them people are demonstrating for there civil rights, because isn't that exactly what you are trying to do? Maybe you just a moron that follows the herd and thinks dumb racist things are funny.
---
Can I have your stuff?

No, the triple battery :P

LOL i love it

Yes please.

Can survive get neuted by a full room long enough to kill the neuters, and fitting an Adaptive means you either need to Faction the BCS or fit a CPU mod, you just need to kill webs with fire and manual pilot and never make sharp turns.
---
Wasn't it because Someone Was Gonna Die when fighting Drifters cuz of the dumb DD mechanic?
---
I love the salt generated by anything CODE related. Imagine getting this butthurt over people beating you in a video game.
---
&gt; Can survive get neuted by a full room long enough to kill the neuters, and fitting an Adaptive means you either need to Faction the BCS or fit a CPU mod, you just need to kill webs with fire and manual pilot at times to make sure you never make sharp turns.
---
But its the cheapest fit i would feel comfortable using. 
---
Have run a shitload of sites in it and yeh, apart from pilot error havent come close to losing one. 
---
First run we had one guy go into hull cause he Q clicked and forgot to keep clicking that direction:P
---
I see it more as a fleet type of hac, but like to fight against the large HP pool of capitals. And the low sig radius will help stay alive on damage heavy grids.
---
Well, I guess Tiamat will then become the second AT ship worse that it's normal t2 counterpart following the Mimir
---
I'm not critiquing, just saying that triple battery is unusua and not often seenl. However, I'm a firm believer in battery &gt; booster whenever possible.

Why are the reasons obvious? Can you help someone oblivious? :)

Is there a way we could see the killmails of the ships lost in these fights? It would be interesting to see the fits during some of these fights

banning 3 vets who haven't paid sub with IRL $ in years vs free advertisement.  Just YouTube the incident and you'll see on YouTube alone it generated hundreds of thousands of views.  I am sure of them they were able to cover 3 high level dudes who could easily be replaced.
---
I mean that's not strictly true, it's entirely possible for the ikitisura to have done less than 345k to another sub and have been the better choice, where the drekavic damage may not have been enough to break reps but the higher spool allowed the reps to be broken, before hitting a point where their raw damage dealt is equal.  don't get me wrong I think it desperately needs a faster spool, but I don't feel in most cases raw damage done is a useful metric for anything other than shooting buffer caps. wirh no rr. on field.
---
Tracking bonus is nice but doesn't make a lot of sense with the theme of being a much more extended duration brawler, as most targets which have a small enough sig to benefit from the tracking bonus will die long before hitting a high ramp.  While flawed I could definatley see them being brought along with drek fleets to provide some sort of anti tackle capability if the need to extract arises, though that would be better served by kikis so...
---
has been and probably always will be, MMO's just don't have the same draw as they once had.

Draugur / Draugr is minmatar. It's a viking thing, they were 'living' corpses (with special magical abilities and often an immunity to weapons), the word means "again walker". When CCP Rattati was collecting empire names for what they called dust soldiers, Draugr was one of the popular suggestions put forth for minmatar.

For those who don't know; Aralis is the founding leader of CVA 15 years ago.  Also fun fact, his character is so old it predates corp history.

I know a guy who obsesses over and often helps create the lore at least around live events. From my understanding from him, the Triglavians are deliberately testing us in the fragments so Idk why they'd get angry. Itd be like someone telling you to hit them with a crowbar repeatedly, handing you the crowbar, and then going "wtf man you hit me with a crowbar"

---
lmao came here to post this but you beat me to it haha lol
---
I want to preface by saying that the small NPC null corps deserve more membership, and one should definitely check them out if you are leaving a bloc rather than just go from one f1 blob to another.
---
Pretty much all NPC null is between great and superb for small/tiny entities, where the non-infinite site spawn rate and lack of belt anomalies (forcing mining in the actual belts) is enough to satisfy needs since there aren't too many people. More importantly, NPC null is one of the places where the existence of citadels have been an overwhelming net positive.
---
Curse as you said has stuff around OSY/H-ADOC, but is also close to Scalding Pass which is somewhat left alone by large blocs, and Catch, where all kinds of smaller-scale content springs up.  
---
Venal is pretty busy around K3J's mission hub and has various small groups living out of its scattered pockets. It's a little more dead PvP wise as the regions around it are empty wastelands of krabs and renters. You won't find much of interest from the blocs and if you aren't brawling with the K3J/H-PA locals you'll have to travel pretty far to shoot something.  
---
Stain is full of Relic runners and has similar pocket life while having a few dedicated residents, as well as the remnants of Stainwagon.  
---
Syndicate fluctuates between PvP heaven and staging hell.  
---
Great Wildlands has finally been active (or at least active-ish) after having been mostly dead before citadels due to its station placement. The entire region with its numerous pockets and offshoots is now liveable with the addition of citadels, and it got a large buff to decent-value moons after the re-seed.  
---
While Outer Ring has largely been co-opted by Init for its moons, and though Init has generally refused to allow anyone to live in the region (which personally I find despicable), it's really the exception to the rule, and it's so far out of the way with very little desirable space even for randos. Mission running there is quite profitable but hasn't generated much interest.
---
The NPC space that shares sov regions (Delve, Pure Blind, Geminate) is pretty much a no-go for anyone trying to use it for anything but a staging into the surrounding sov space, and that's okay, but it does reduce the total amount of 'available' space.
---
Good idea, but it seems clunky from the ui side, how would you select it as an attacker? Top damage? Corp leadership of the attacking corp?
---
Damn you got me.
---
I will care for you always &lt;3
---
It confused me when there was no other Corp history. I failed to do my due diligence and check the update time.
---
I'm intentionally not adding up the monthly subscriptions since then.  dontwannaknow
---
YES as long as an unanchoring of a structure still has asset safety. If I take a break from even and my alliance decided to change stagings and unanchor the main cita, id rather not lose all my stuff. If it's killed though there should be no asset safety. But then people would just live in stations so ..

Pretty decent summation of the current NPC Null areas. You're right about Curse and the surrounding Sov Null areas. It's content central in all timezones now, and not just in the region but near it too.
---
I've never actually lived in Outer Ring, but I can't imagine it being anything special due to the geography there, nor do I imagine ORE LP being that valuable to justify living there.

Also, you should re-read my comment.

If you upgrade to omega mid way through do you get all of the omega rewards?

How long do you think either of them would be allowed to win this war until The Imperium third-partied and started rolling them both up?
---
Next time I take a break from EvE I am doing this (honestly it's probably best to do this with most liquid isk). At least PLEX grows with inflation instead of being inflated. Which I guess is exactly the difference between a fiat currency and a currency that is backed by some other value.
---
They have their own server. They shouldn't need to use a loophole(VPN) to play a game. Also, it is a game for adults anyone can say whatever they want. None of us in the "free" world should have to make sacrifices to appease the population of a totalitarian communist dictatorship. If someone wants to shit up local they can.

At ~27mil fit I had 200 ehp/s but my skills are a lot better now. https://i.imgur.com/FLbOZ3i.png  I needed the power diagnostic back then because my skills were too bad.
---
DPS is kind of bad on my build there. That's why I'd say to go 3 ballistic control.
---
ORE LP goes into Excavator drone BPCs, which as far as I know is the only way to get them out of the LP store - you can also get them from dronelands faction spawns.
---
The ISK/LP ratio is pretty good for those BPCs last I checked, as it also is for the implants they offer.
---
While it would be super neat if Barge/Rorqual/etc blueprints were only given out as copies in the LP store, you can just by originals on market from NPC sell orders and travelceptor/JF them out.
---
Outer Ring only has two pockets, and a few systems off the main pipes. One pocket goes ridiculously deep but is basically a pipe and thus doesn't really  support multiple entities, and the second one is pretty garbage, though it does have a station and mission hub. The off-pipe systems also suck. The only semi-consistent stuff that happens in Outer Ring is either on the 4C station undocks, or in the 'this is actually just more Syndicate' constellation.

Just wish escelations went to the journal again. It was easy to find, didn't require you to pull down a dozen pulldowns in a laggy as shit UI.
---
They warped in when I jumped in. CONCORD and they ignored each other
---
and TS UV is super cheap right now thanks to event crates!
---
Some agents still don't show up on the agency UI when you are sitting in the station of that agent. Sent in bug reports for a long time. Never got fixed. Fuck it.
---
The lag sucks, but if you get an escelation you get no choice but to use it :(
---
Wish it would go back to the journal.
---
&gt; Oooh. I though they didn't wanted mutaplasmid for resist stuff because it could get too high ?

Sisi shows it only rolls structure resists, not sure if that's going to change.

---
The opposite is true: Eve was the healthiest when highsec was worth playing in. If there is a strong highsec eco-system of things that are worth doing then Eve will attract and retain more people.
---
It isn't obvious, but a highsec only PvEer is incredibly valuable to Eve. They may be solo, but chances are they join a corp that shares a similar interest. That highsec only PvEer will provide support to other members of their corp. While they may never go to Lowsec/nullsec/WH space, they give other new bros a leg up and help retain them. Those other players may move on to more dangerous space. Those are the players that never would have if highsec sucked and the highsec PvEer never played.
---
A great example of this was the data and relic update that made the sites worth doing. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of players who stayed with Eve, joined corps, and moved to more dangerous space, because exploration didn't suck. We need more PvE that doesn't suck to keep players around. (edit: Another example is that I am willing to bet there are lots of players who love Abyssal PvE and stuck with Eve because it exists.)
---
I think PvE incursions are a great move after the Wardec changes. Revamping missions to make them anything but incredibly boring would be a boost too. Storyline missions should be re-adjusted. Epic Arcs updated. DED complexes need to be updated. Data and Relic sites should be iterated upon again.
---
tl;dr: a healthy highsec leads to a healthy Eve.
---
Faction crystals still last a long time and are worthwhile even in ratting compared to t1, and since officer can't use t2 there's really no reason to use anything else but faction.  The fact he was only using X-ray is odd too.
---
People act like no one dies in eve
---
Sounds about right... where do you have them?
---
I mean, 2k USD for 11 years of entertainment? Seems like a good deal to me.
---
Old boi
---
True enough, but who plays eve with one account. It’s the multiplier that hurts
---
interesting theory. Hasn't the highsec PVE experience always been pretty much the same though? In fact over the years they have just added more content in the form of incursions etc. The rest they just haven't really changed/removed. So if it was good back then why is the same content not good now? 
---
I do like the stepping stone idea though, but it seems like newbro corps like hord/Bnewbies are picking up the slack there. I think that the real reason there are so few highsec players now is that the PVE experience was alright for the standard of games in 2005, but its pretty shit for a game in 2019. People just have better entertainment things to do that EVE PVE in 2019
---
So are you saying that if you are doing pve you don't have a build/fit that's capable of handling a pvp build? Also, can this happen in any location highsec or low? If it can happen anywhere, it would turn me off. I hate pvp situations.
---
ty for the feedback

THE TRUE KING OF PROVIDENCE
---
I'm not sure why nobody's bothered mentioning the EVE University wiki. It's in-depth enough that CCP deleted their own.
---
I wish I could stick with a game this long. I get bored to quickly.
---
trust me you won't survive out there either
---
Still works, but definetely not as well. You will get swarmed by assault frigs. And other small stuff you can't track. Navy osprey might be better option in current meta. You will still get carrier dropped each time though. It's annoying "win against solo dude" button :(
---
Bots could just constantly drop safes
---
Let me know when you dump all these and crash the market. I love the Gnosis and Praxis, keeps everyone guessing on what they are up against. 
---
mjd sebo web gnosis is full as hell. People always curious when you lock them up at 110km. lol  "hi there Mr. Kitey Orthrus Man... meet blaster to your face" all in a shit fit. lolz
---
took ~150k pvp damage so I'd guess he was in bastion.  Paladin has ~30k raw hp so to rep 120k raw hp is pretty good even if it took a while for everyone to get there.
---
Personally, if the problem about the rorq is the capital spam, why are we nerfing the rorq and not the capitals, or what it takes to make / fly them?
---
Okay, so I tested it out some more in the recent Dev version of Pyfa... which is sad, that I need to resort to Pyfa to get a straight answer. Lol
---
It seems that between my Lvl 4 T2 spec skill, and my Lvl 4 HAC skill, the Veles does indeed have more. If I load the All 5's profile, then the T2 gun pulls ahead ever so slightly. But that doesn't seem sensible, that the Faction gun performs as well or even better than the T2 gun with T2 skills. What's the point in training the T2 skills if the gun doesn't need it. Veles gives you Lvl 5 T2 performance, for only having Lvl 1 enough to use the ammo. Just doesn't seem sensible.
---
Make distinct bug reports for each of these. 
---
This is not the official place to report bugs.
---
PvP can happen anytime you undock, anywhere. And, while many people will do everything rigged for PvP, it isn't as 'efficient', so lots of other people will optimize for a specific PvE situation and believe they'll be 'safe' during their mission.
---
im coming up on 260M but i havent played in a long time now.  after my first couple times 'quiting' and being upset at loosing SP, i decided to keep my sub active reguardless of me playing or not.
---
Figured maybe with the assumption of a poverty fit he didn’t have bastion on till others had started to show up and shoot.
---
It seems fair enough- it's true that the current administration is rather nepotistic and corrupt. 
---
Plus they were pretty fair:
---
&gt;Update: In the spirit of fairness we should tell you that following an investigation CCP Games concluded that this politician along with the other players banned for potential corruption were in fact innocent and had their EVE: Online accounts reinstated.
---
It just seems like you're trying to spin this to garner sympathy for your preferred political party.
---
Good work!
---
Yeah, i just upgraded my gpu after a year of potatoes. Totally different game.
---
Actually the statistics doesn't support your theory. Player retention in highsec is extremely low compared to other areas in Eve. The golden years of Eve was when there was not many reasons to stay in highsec and rewards you got there were minimal.
---
I'd say because the income from highsec activities hasn't come close to following the inflation caused by the Rorqual Catastrophe. People used to grind L4s to obtain shiny things; that would take absolute ages now.
---
Incursions was a massive addition. Literally hundreds of players did nothing but run incursions for months and years after release. Everyone tried it. My Alliance at the time volunteered to be logi when they started (because only PvPers had logi skills.) Once we were in the site, they were tackled, we would warp the logi out and they would die... Ah the good old days.
---
Back to the point: You hit the nail on the head. Eve PvE wasn't that bad in 2011. But no updates meant that there was nothing to retain the highsec PvEer. Incursion running communities are a shadow of what they once were because no one wanted to run the same incursion for the 10 millionth time. No one runs missions level 1-4 missions. Why would you when you can VNI a haven easier, with fewer SP, for the same entertainment value, and make more isk?
---
A lasting point was that the Imperium ran their annual burn Jita this year. Their biggest take away was that highsec is WAY poorer than it was the first time they did it. A healthy highsec is a rich highsec that is full of players who help retain new players. We need to get back to that. I am for any CCP effort to making highsec worth it because it means I eventually get more people to shoot... Or at least gank.
---
Yup. Solo/roaming? Max graphics. Live the space exploration dream. 
---
Strat fleet? Full potato, 15 accounts ready to jump in, 5 discord/jabber servers constantly shitpinging you with intel and new orders. Live the "frantic C&amp;C HQ  during the blitz" dream.
---
Still got more than my oldest char. He has not remained subbed so reason he is only at 235m sp w/ born on date of 2003 May 16 (10 days after game started)
---
Would have been impressive, if not for 2-day old characters that have been injected to shit.
---
the game being 'hardcore' was what set it apart in the start. the grand scale and single shard is what brought players in, being so hard core was to its detriment i feel.  or perhaps at least to the extent that it was implemented.  medical clone requirements, learning skills, a well voiced but ultimately difficult to follow aura were but a few of the failings.
---
they have done a lot to correct these failings and i think we have seen improvements there in. i do believe that the ability to buy SP was a step to far and has lead to some vet players leaving as well as a more lackluster enthusiasm around the game itself - it lost that earned achievement niche that set it apart from most other games. (similar things can be said about WoW as well that lead to shrinking sub numbers).
---
there has always been a larger focus on null sec over high sec and low sec was all but forgot for YEARS. unfortunately CCP seems to jump from one focus to the next, trying to make each area of the game better but not always considering how it meshes with the rest - sort of picking favorites. 
---
what i think the game needs is a reboot of sorts. we have a system that has brought massive clumps of players together at the detriment of the small clumps. numbers will always matter of course but we have seen a fall off of battles that revolve around anything but numbers when it comes to pvp.  we have seen the wardeck system wreak havoc in high sec and it went unchecked for far to long.   we also have ourselves competition in 2019, many other games with equally large worlds exist now and for the first time ever we have the promise of games such as star citizen directly competing for players of eve.
---
now we also see a fall off in community engagement from CCP. no eve fest, no alliance tourney... even when i was out of game i would still take time to watch those. we have also seen the rise and fall of many odd off shoots from VR to dust. imo the chaos at CCP itself is hurting new edens prospects as well.
---
API issues probably.
---
im 08 i think, i had an 05 but lost the account info and recreated.
---
Get out
---
Its not much, but its honest work
---
Never change hask &lt;3
---
Completely the opposite; biggest barrier for entry to EVE is that a lot of people only see the big Alliance fights and think that's EVE. And they're right. Except we maybe get one of those every two years, with the way null and sov have developed they are literally meaningless (let's not forget that it took an RMT player bankrolling a massive invasion to see any real changes in null). And even getting to *that* seems impossible when there's no real practice for PvP, nothing is explained, and it takes a hell of a long time to build up even a reserve to take a risk in PvE. EVE has one of the slowest early games of any MMO, and that hurts player retention. It doesn't help that EVE has a really interesting world and story... that you don't get to explore at all. There's what, *one* newbie Epic Arc that does a piss-poor job of actually showing off New Even, has you fighting the single most boring enemy type in the game, and then nothing until the pirate Epic Arcs. Forget Live Events, their timing is terrible and it's more a stage play everyone watches live rather than story interaction, and quests are... bad. Except Furrier Fiasco.
---
Giving EVE an actual PvE story that could lead people into the PvP would do wonders for the game. And expanding that to affect the PvP (say like an Empire expanding into capsuleer-owned space) would only make things more dynamic.
---
Oh shit, i completely misread what he said, my bad.
---

Me too. Though I'll be honest, I'm hoping the Triglavians \_win,\_ and the 4 Empires \_don't\_ get to pull a Hail Mary out of their butt with the Iapetans just to maintain the status quo. It would be amazing if this were a memorable event which changed New Eden forever in some way, and not just another timed event / form of weather patterns on the universe like the Sansha incursions are now. *(TLDR: Triglavians should blow up Jita 4-4)*

Yeah but do you actually pay for them all?  I always just used plex with 5 accounts, though admittedly I stopped playing when plex doubled to almost 700 mil.

Oh nice stuff, yea i'm really enjoying the matches so far. A follow up talk through/analysis show would be great!

I went the other way and won EVE entirely.  Now even with Alpha I just don't feel the desire to come back.

lolsec is dead . deal with it.
---
&gt; tl;dr: a healthy highsec leads to a healthy Eve.
---
Hisec issues are not much connected to ways most people play Eve. Most people, and particularly people who pay dollars to CCP, spend their playtime either in null empires or around them. Even wormholers hunt in null. Eve didn't get best buffs to its playercounts during hisec expansions like FOB's. It got them when mega nullsec wars happened. And they don't happen right now due to ecosystem issues.
---
The problem is that null is the new hisec. A space's "worthiness" is relative. It's not about how much money is found where, but about  how much money is found where compared to everywhere else. Relative to everywhere else, nullsec is the safest, least effort, most lucrative option for the average Eve player overall (this doesn't mean nullsec is the best isk/hr, but it's the best isk/hr/effort/safety). Not the entire nullsec, but just a few regions. That's why most economic activity happens in them. Not even Jita. That's why nullseccers control big hisec market hubs, and even create the largest pvp contents in hisec as well.
---
If nullsec's ecosystem issues were solved, that would make hisec relatively more lucrative again. For example, if this much minerals weren't pumped in this game by null Rorqual multiboxers, then hisec miners' work also would have been more valuable. Of course, there are things to fix in all spaces. But nullsec's ecosystem issues are more inherent to the recent player decline than anything else.

I dunno, I'm not the OP, just refuting the claim that CCP is doing this because they just want us to have fun.
---
[weeps in gigx]
---
Cool, thanks for the intel.
---
How sarcastic, the article reporting this contains another spoiler
---
Is this the place to have your stuff?
---
&gt; Completely the opposite; biggest barrier for entry to EVE is that a lot of people only see the big Alliance fights and think that's EVE. And they're right. Except we maybe get one of those every two years,
---
It's true that mega alliance warfare are overly hyped. But the answer here is not PvE. Eve never had interesting and engaging PvE to begin with. Even Abyssal is pretty repetetive. The game is limited by design. Eve character controls don't have richness of a classic MMO (e.g. like WoW where you have 40+ skills, different moves you can make, and that's per class).  You just have a bunch of modules (most of which work in a similar way) and a few buttons to activate. Eve PvE is a means to an end for almost everyone. For PvP'ers, the end of PvE is getting PvP ships. For carebears, the endgame is getting bigger and better assets. Not even carebears play Eve PvE because it's engaging. If they did, the majority of them wouldn't do the most boring one of all PvE; nullsec anomaly ratting/mining. While in a game like WoW many people can genuinely have fun doing dungeons etc, Eve PvE will never offer that experience. Both because CCP can't match other MMOs in adding new content (new dungeons), also because Eve char controls are really limited and do not yield sufficiently interesting richness for fun PvE to occur.
---
Eve's fun comes from emergent stories in the single shard server. Not necessarily big wars. But also small stuff. If you ask many people, they have lifetime stories to tell in a small fleet or solo situation. Doesn't always have to be direct PvP aggression. Sometimes it's getting chased. Sometimes it's almost losing a ship. There are always daily opportunities for lifetime stories in Eve. Many different situations can arise in many kinds of playstyles. These are the things most people play for. And these are the strongest suite of Eve. Ecosystem issues are inherent to statistical likelyhoods of whether these stories are generated or not. So the OP is right.
---
Guess it's too late to see PL takes in Provi?
---
About 5k shots isnt it. I carry t1s in my paladin as well but their backups for if I magically burn out one or more t2 and haven't brought extras.
---
Is the Tengu viable for ratting in drone lands or should i stick with my VNI?
---
That's how most things work though.  T1 &lt; meta &lt; T2 &lt; faction &lt; deadspace &lt; officer.  (For that matter I'd wondered why faction guns couldn't use T2 ammo)
---
I think it makes more sense this way. T1 is garbage and the fodder of idiots, meta is poor but good if you're new, T2 is gold standard, faction gives a touch more performance if you spring for bling, officer if you're in AT or have too much money or no financial sense.  It's more in line with everything else, and much better than faction / officer being shiny but strictly limited.

Pushback? Hell, players *asked* for this and unfortunately CCP listened.

Personally I don't think citadels were a bad idea but I think there are far too many safeguards built into them, some early tweaks could have fixed this but it's far too late now.

I mean the best way to play eve is to have other people play it for you.

hmm

Thanks, I kinda wanted to try playing again but if there is any chance I can get ganked playing really casual builds I don't even want to try.

Aralis is a legend ( not necessarily in a good way ). He is the one who declared Holy War on Ushrakhan  and their evil -A- supporters in Catch. It went as expected. Provi was stomped by Manny and Aralis rage quit.

He famously strictly stuck to lore which was hilarious. Also our favorite FC PGL the Great is from those times.

No kidding, lowest graphics settings compared to highest are literally game changers. For wormholers, systems types can be determined by the wh color and whatnot, but only with good graphics. With gas harvesting, you can't eve see the measily cloud really with low graphics

Concord has the ability to teleport capsuleers and their ships across the galaxy, and warp in thousands of ships at a whim.
---
How the hell do they explain the fact that Concord will ignore Triglavians???
---
It doesn't matter that much if you get ganked if you still have earned more than you have lost. Risk vs Reward. Ships are like ammo in Eve. Without constant possibility of PVP it wouldn't feel like a dark space game full of dangers. Embrace it.
---
It's not dumb, I do understand how it currently works is to give small corps that arent online 24/7 a chance to defend while they are ok line instead of being forced to fight in the off time where everyone may be at work, or in class, or something of that nature.

Nah, we gon' wreck em if they act up.

I mean, 23g- was basically Guristas' space for a while.
---
Casual Eve player here.
---
This is my third foray into Eve.
---
First time I bounced off. Hard.
---
Second time I grinded out the tuts and set a few modest goals.
---
This time I haven't decided... Bought a subscription to vote with my wallet.
---
I'm in my 40s. I have always loved space sims. 
---
Here's the thing... I have two kids, a career, and a marriage that have to be higher priority than Eve.
---
The truth is, I will probably always be a gamer. 
---
Facts...
---
I am not alone. 
---
I have a lot of disposable income.
---
I am happy to spend it on a game that is deep and wide.
---
I'm not interested in fast twitch reflex PvP games dominated by underemployed tweens.
---
I've tried the singleplayer sandboxes. It took me longer than I care to admit to realize that Dogfighting in space with a joystick is dumb. Eve has always known this.
---
As a casual player I will probably always play in high SEC and mostly alone.
---
CCP doesn't have to curate a game experience to people like me but they should. I am happy to subsidize the hardcore players in low and null as long as I have a quality experience.
---
Switching gears...
---
Maybe I am wrong.
---
IF Eve is meant to be played as part of a corp and fighting massive battles and treated as a part time job, where are the in-game tools to facilitate this?
---
Why do you have to use third party tools for comms?
---
Why is it so hard to fleet up and coordinate movements?
---
I'm rambling, but if I could build an East India trading company in high SEC and manage it for 30 minutes a day,  and occasionally drop into low and null for exploration and PvP on the off chance I get a 4 or 5 hour block of gaming time, I would pay a monthly subscription to play Eve forever.
---
The bones are strong.
---
The framework is there.
---
The real question:  did he wake up at 5:30 am or 5:30 pm?
---
I hear that if you name a vedmak "Starving Vedmak" and fit it with high roll abyssal officer mods and go into a T5 abyss site they will let you join their forces.
---
What do you mean, big fights don't make stories?
---
The keepstar fights I spent 1 hour gating. 3 hours to warp, launch one bomb and get podded, with another 30mins of white screen.
---
Best fun ever! Better than the dentist without any novicane.
---
Break out the kvass and pickles comrade.
---
Personally I hope its a dynamic thing that is hard to predict and tricky to deal with even with a blob.
---
CONCORD has special abilities to affect us thanks to our equipment, I assume the trig ships don't have those kinds of problems. n
---
Ishtar had it's slot layout changed and sentry drones got a Nerf as well. They are still used just are not king anymore
---
this is the most stupeid thing i have heard. look at what every one is doing and there potental new customers want pve so they are going to pve.
---
Welp, back to t3 only, i guess.
---
I only climbed up to t4 filaments anyway.
---
And for my experience in t4s, the loot there wasn't really better than t3.
---
Anyway, i expect t4 and t5 to be more of a null sec thing again... you know, savely krabbing under the super umbrella.
---
In the end this change will not increase losses but just push the solo players back to the lower tiers.
---
Meh I was triple boxing there was plenty to do. And it's nonstop kills in no tidi with your friends - hard to complain about.
---
Dscan, Dscan, and Bob
---
This is actually pointless. Most of the smart abyss runners just run the sites straight off the undock of a major coalition bloc's staging keepstar. If anyone comes to fuck with you, there will always be a bored super or 10 who will happily fly some fighters out to guard your exit.
---
Or just stick your own fax alt on the exit, no one is gonna gank you with a ninazu repping you.
---
Not necessarily = not only big fights but also other stuff

So you pay to accumulate SP in a game you don't play? 🤔

I do it too. I like to come back every once in a while to a bunch of skills I didn't have the last time I played. :)

Can confirm, also the Black Rise-Placid border is also a good place if you're near Jita or Dodixie.
---
Yeah, get rid of the nuet fitting reduction and give 20% optimal range per level. 95km on the ship would be lovely.

---

---
So instead of "ganking" pve players, why not go pick fights with other PVP players? In my experience, the majority of casual roamers roaming through nullsec etc are looking for easy pickings. Stop obsessing over killboards and just go and fight, win or loose. You say you want fights, but in reality, all your looking for is the easy target (aka the PVE player) that guaruntee's you a win.
---
Which is where they just need to keep it fueled with a service mod running.
---
I personally speulate between 10-30 billion at a time with a 3-6 month time period i  mind. I would suggest you determine what kind of profit/loss margin potential would result for your speculative investment before buying into a posistion. I personally looked at gnosis and praxis as optikns but determine the potential upside as low but the downside could be quite large.
---
Heh, I still remember ~100m plex.
---
Ppl wiil stop doing t4 t5 in highsec the investment is to high for what u can lose.
---
I think the issue is that spec V skills will become absolutely not worth training, it’s already barely worth training but now you can just use a faction gun instead of the x amount of SP (ISK in the form of plex or injectors) you’d have to train
---
[It's a written language](https://i.imgur.com/Uw3QWwI.jpg)
---
lmao the game's foundations 
---
maybe make **any other activity** in the game worth doing for PvE other than ratting and mining
---
expect plex prices to rise as people actually paying for plex stop supplying the market because they realize how retarded it is to spend money on this game and the thousands of rorqual alts consume the dwindling supply
---
i mean people are still doing whatever they want but the overall meta is pretty stagnant because there's specifically no worthwhile pve activity in the game except nullsec ratting and mining, and there's essentially no penalty for putting as many people into a single region as possible to do it
---
what idiot would make his own pve alliance right now lmao join test or goons are u retarded
---
If it were me and I were buttmad, I'd hit up some npsi crews and ask if they were interested in doing handout fleets with those
---
WHO CARES ABOUT THE SP! WE'RE GETTING MONICLES! MY NEARLY 10 YEAR LONG QUEST IS NEARLY COMPLETE!
---
yeah its commonly thought that arbitrarily lowsec and hisec just became "worthless" overnight - theyre still the same old shitholes they used to be and arguably because of mineral over saturation you can buy more actual ships than you could at other points in the game's more recent past but the fact that there's essentially 100% afk alternatives to actually playing the game means there's only a few people who give enough of a shit to try and stick it out and most of them are either brand new or are too dumb to realize nullsec isnt even dangerous at all
---
It’s an old meme but it checks out

Without animation, you cannot truly appreciate how utterly amazing that SKIN is. ([Shown on the wrong ship](https://imgur.com/a/y0UJmGX))

Quick scan through the files shows that Empress Jamyls Avatar is going to be used for something.... The drifters killed her right? Maybe they stole her corpse and reanimated it?
---
This is why wormholes are great ccp has almost forgotten about them
---
Come on out to WH, LS or null, join a newbie freindly group, learn the ropes and have fun.
---
Seriously, highsec is like the waiting room at a bad dentist's office in comparison.  All the fun is leeched out, and you are so limited as to what you can do.
---
No shit....same here... out of Siegen Lane
---
I would resub if this happens and go after Goons :)
---
Completely agree.just saying I understand the other side as well.
---
there's more good stuff regarding fits;
---
now you can not only buy whole fittings worth of modules from the market simultaneously with multibuy, but you can fit multiple sets of the same modules to packed ships with multifit!!!
---
also you don't lose SP any more for having the wrong clone (clone types were removed) which IMO is a good thing because fuck that was annoying.
---
You are retarded and playing on a toaster.
---
If you want plex prices to drop they need to remove skill injectors. More and more people making skill farm toons and it's not like they are plexing it with real dollar!  Think about it
---
Match was super fun.  Great piloting by the Goondor boys, looks like Brave made some slight piloting mistakes.  Either way, A+
---
You're spot on w/ the abyss sites comment.  The only reason I log on nowadays is to run some filaments.  They beat lvl 4 mission spam by a mile, and I can opt to run lvl 2's in a passive gila and pay little attention or I can break out the HAC and run the real shit if I want something intense.  It always sucked to me that such an interesting space combat had such dreadfully boring space combat - abyssal sites have variety and a bit of depth, and a nice risk-reward balance.
---
You could catch most of VNI ratters as well by “log off”.
---
Wow, a change to suspect flags not affecting nullsec? Who knew?
---
The mining increase is a bug. At least so suitonia says.
---
also confirms that it is in fact a ship.
---
so NYAHHHH in the face of everyone who kept insisting itd be a faction citadel
---
Just scan a wh and crab there. Or some dead highsec system.
---
Yeah but catching real players is easier than catching botters.
---
Also this is more satisfying
---
btw paging u/ccp_falcon
---
bots in vid btw
---
oh yeah definitely, but that would take $$$ away from CCP. Less PLEX would be bought from them in total. However, if they made PVPing better then more people would lose isk/ships and then want to use plex to fund that. Thus making CCP more money
---
Nice to see a vet as old as me 👍
---
Every time I log into my 70million sp lobotomized alpha...

My point is that anyone running abyss sites in highsec is stupid when its so much safer in null.

I have been put in the position, as a **SERBS**, of facing shameful conditions in Serbia. I have never obscured the fact that 14 members of my family died in the Yugoslav Wars, and that therefore the fate of the Serbian people was always a matter of profound concern to me. As a Christians, I must oppose racism. One would have thought that with the memory of the Holocaust and bloody war fresh in their minds the last thing Serbs would want to be guilty of is a resurgence of racism. Unfortunately, Neo-Chetniks and Srpska radikalna stranka (SRS) has no shame now about war crimes, but can actually help them launch a political career in Serbia.  
---
My dissident dad taught me nationalistic ideologies view of history inflates arrogance.  We are casting aside fundamental, painful lessons that man has written time and again. Daily we see the tragic, maddening results:  willing acceptance of known lies; the domination of the loudest voice in the room over the most truthful voice;  short-term political victories scored at cost of principle; repudiation of virtue; redefinition of victory; appeasement of dictators in pursuit of peace. We have forgotten the disasters that accompany moral decline and the loss of absolute truth. We have forgotten the dangers of  Statism. We have forgotten how victory tends to lead to prosperity and then devolve into decadence and decay.  Serbs committed some of the most horrendous crimes in modern history, from rape camps, to massacre Bosniaks in Srebrenica massacre, singing Mauzer to tortured or killed Kid and the ethnic violence in Kosovo. If you are a victim of serbs crimes, please accept my apologies.  
---
As in the case of post-war Yugoslavia, normative ideology is firmly universalist, whereas operative ideology articulates this universalist message thought the particularist ideas of Ethnonationalism with the aim of justifying its monopolistic and hegemonistic political position in society. it's able to collect the diverse layers of society under the single idiom of the 'nation'. The 'nation' is the widest possible umbrella one can use to bring together heterogeneous aspects and actors of Serbian society.   
---
The unity of the social has again been achieved through the rhetoric and practice of 'People-as-One'. In this case, however, unlike Yugoslavia, unity is not achieved through integral, state-centered nationalism that aimed to assembled different identities and nationalities of multi-ethnic Yugoslavia, but solely through appealing to egoism and to the attractions of Ethnonationalism. The old normative ideology of integral nationalist self-management  socialism has disintegrated together with the common (Yugoslav) public to which this ideology used to be disseminated. The new (Serbian only) public needs a new operative ideology that will integrate only the different layers of Serbian society - an ideology that will subjugate regional, educational, urban and rural, gender, class and other differences. It is this that is the particularly articulated operative ideology of Ethnonationalism. Many Serbs are seeking new road of Serbia nationalism. **We must never retreat, never retrace  vitriolic racism steps.**
---
I feel like a lot of people who focus on PvP don't fully understand the beauty of PvE. (I do both for the record.) You're correct in that Abyssal is pretty repetitive.  And getting a single ship and running it over and over again is boring.  But optimizing the fit, figuring out patterns, and then pushing the isk/hr up is fun. Then you think, "How do I keep a good isk/hr, but push the price of my ship down?" And you play with that.  Then you ask yourself, "What is the cheapest possible fit with minimal implants that can run T5s?" and you play around with that.  Then you look at it per ship.  Per site.  Gather data on site times and isk/hr.  Try to see how fast you can run sites.  Now suddenly, this repetitive abyssal site has turned into 100s of hours of fun for these PvE players. Then you add in frigates and a new can of worms opens up. And then all these PvE players are also feeding in supplies for PvP ships elsewhere.
---
This is very akin to when burners came out and how do you optimize those sites.  And also when incursions came out.  Do you know what it felt like to finally take down a TCRC site?  It used to be the incursion system was dead when a TCRC wall hit because no one knew how to beat it.  But then, finally a group came along that figured it out meticulously.  Then taught people.  Then the fits were optimized, sites were optimized, FCs were trained, and massive amounts of hours were spent on this PvE activity. (And also, incursion runners had lot's of isk, and would take stupid blingy roams out for fun providing content for PvP players.)
---
I think PvE has it's place in Eve Online and depending on how they implement it depends on how engaging and fun it can be.  Simple events that they used to do that was warp in and kill a ship with a Gila isn't fun and isn't rewarding to PvE players, and things like FOBs and Mining Rats are too difficult with too little reward to draw in people, and those have been misses for CCP. Possibly even part of the reason it didn't work is because CCP does a horrible job at introducing new players to content. (This is beginning to shift with the Agency)  However, Burners, Incursions, and Abyss have all been successes.
---
Regardless, I think what I'm trying to say is if CCP gives incentive to PvE opportunities and creates them in a way that allows for endless possibilities, they become exciting and add a LOT of engaging content for PvE focused players.
---
Killing PVEers is what gets fights, but sadly the state of the game is such that you'll get a bunch of caps and supercaps dropped on your head.

The tengu is great for running DED sties. If you are just running anoms though it is overkill.
---
I see red flags with this plan. Maybe they will betray TEST when they grow stronger, turncoat to FRT or create a bigger Chinese Commonwealth. The double cross  will be coming soon without Supervision.
---
I think pve could be improved, the fact you only have a few modules and your ship to man is not the issue, if you look at path of exile, where you also only have a few skills in your hotbar, you see you can make an epic pve experience by adding randomness to the spawn and adding fresh content regularly with challenges and league rewards. If you ask a poe player they will have countless stories to tell about epic unique encounters they had. It is much harder to plan such gameplay in eve because of the persistent ecosystem but they did a good thing with abyssals. For example nerfing static content rewards and adding randomness with chances at rare loot to anoms or mission spawns would be fun. Make some off the shit loot be randomly rolled for stats with tiers based around the trusec status would go a long way. Adding more various faction spawns. When you do anoms now, it is the most boring shit in the world, except when you get a rare spawn. But it happens so rarely it's not relevant.

Sadly think it will be "the thing" for a short while and then turn into stale never to be adjusted in the future. Like drifter incursions, sansha incursions etc.. Either gone or the same old same old for years and years now.
---
Amamake to huola, and over to kamela sisiedie ain't too shabby these days
---
Most vnis I catch try to kill me with their heavy drones, do I just outrun them. Even Warrior 2s are not to scary in a standard retri.
---
How I get out and kill stuff before getting nyxed? I don't stay very long and I also know which areas to avoid
---
Look at Sutonia’s videos on YouTube. His channel is Eve is Easy. 
---
I mean, he’s probably the best in the game at what he does, so don’t expect to just instantly start doing the things he’s doing. But just by copying fits and tactics you can do quite a bit, which is the point of his channel
---
So basically get a t1 frigate and go to faction warfare low security space. All the t1 frigs are well balanced(ish) and you can lose a lot before your wallet starts to hurt too much. When you feel like it, you can move up to bigger ships, larger engagements, and cooler
---
Kiki is getting 4 less grid and the drones removed
---
Am I the only one here who thinks that when a structure enters low power mode the shields should just be removed entirely from the equation? Congratz you didn't put anything in the gas tank, your shields are gone because DUH why would you have a defense system generated by power used that you don't have the fuel to power? Low power should take shield right out of the equation, allowing attackers to move directly to the armor layer of defenses, once armor is removed the timer should be set to 24 hours from the time of reinforcement period. You failed to power you structure ergo you surrender all the benefits of placing said structure.
---
you don't need to be online when the structure is attacked if you bother at all to make sure it has more than 24 hours worth of fuel on board.
---
We held dps while we killed the mtu and waited for a sabre so we could get the pod, kept him low but in the end rats killed him
---
Maybe not yearly but definitely every decade, give us a complete content turnover. Don't arbitrarily wipe everything and start fresh but have some unstoppable entity, like the Triglavians, wash over space, destroy all the infrastructure, and force us to rebuild anew.
---
Any recommendations on areas to avoid? Also, I'll keep the retri in mind for VNI hunting.
---
Upvoting because of Stacmon
---
Or you could keep the Eve-Uni wormhole master list open in your browser to tab to it when needed. And the Overview is a thing that exists.
---
Thank you everyone for the answers, will check out the wiki and probably start with a cheaper ship to explore around and learn, so I don’t cry much by losing an expensive ship 😁
---
No. Overview and E-Uni
---
I'll take a look, thought he stopped uploading a long time ago. Thanks!
---
Needs more excavators!
---
Gooooooo fuck yourself!
---
I've got to *hand* it to you, its a tempting offer.
---
10/10 play on words
---
Love that Jove tech. Super advanced shipbuilding techniques produce the slowest vessels in New Eden.
---
Nope, I'm in ID atm. He and a few others from ID have left.
---
Nullbear stuff. Best ignored.
---
&gt; I feel like a lot of people who focus on PvP don't fully understand the beauty of PvE. 
---
Look, this is not about people's behavior. If Eve simpy doesn't have the competition in it to fight themepark MMO's in the PvE area, perhaps that's not a good place for CCP to focus the most effort. Whether you like Eve PvE or whether it is likeable isn't an issue. People (statistically) don't, so they won't pay for it.
---
&gt; I think PvE has it's place in Eve Online
---
PvE has very important roles in Eve. Most ecosystem issues in nullsec begins with PvE mechanics. PVe catalyzes other type of content. By either letting people farm for assets to PvP in, by offering an effort mechanic to construct stuff that builds the Eve world/economy, or by making people take risks for rewards and become PvP content.
---
All that being said PvE in itself, the very experience of farming, will never become unrepetetive or interesting, at least to the majority of gamers who could potentially buy Eve. While grinding stuff is always a pain in all MMO's, other MMOs can at least offer dungeons etc. with interactive mechanics to keep it fun. Eve can't do that by design. So all PvE in Eve is a grind. Incursions or Abyssal can't even come close to WoW dungeons etc.
---
Pretty sure it says Epilogue
---
We all know dudes work at CCP don't play the game themselves 
---
They probably just fill a Vedmak's high slot with disintegrators
---
I dunno which ship is good to make content
---
However, hop onto a pvp fit marauder and go to low-sec, I guarantee you will become content
---
Use [anoik.is](https://anoik.is) and zkill. on potato mode all wormholes are set to a default same so E-uni wormhole ID list won't do any good in this case
---
Good watch
---
Just encounter an abyssal capital shipyard myself, can confirm this post is bluff
---
natural selection at its best
---
Whats the /played though?  
---
What's your Spinner High Score?
---
Every empire has 2 assault frogs / cruisers. The one on the billboard could just be the other one which would be released later. Although it wouldn't make too much sense.
---
Fit 1 rapid toro launcher and 4 siege modules to a Phoenix...
---
Whilst the Meta has, for the most part, favoured the larger groups over the past few years there are certainly some newer ships (or newer buffs to ships) that would really complement your play style, things such as the Leshak and all of the buffed Heavy Assault Cruisers. It would be great to have more small gang style groups flying out there to combat the major blobs...
---
Unsurprisingly a simple farmer jumps to being really unclassy when they can't win the argument over whether or not they are doing a bad thing to the game.
---
Congratulations. See you in 70million SP.
---
OMG this is so sad...you make this so easy...Casper had 1 rule keep his moracha in Amamake....but you are so ELITE you could not even do that? I mean I have more AT ships than anyone in EVE. and we seem to be able to fly them all the time without feeding. So what the fuck is your issue? I mean how hard is it to stay in Amamake and not feed RADAKOS?
---
I think you may actually be right. Looking at the video the ship looks exactly like the Vedmak, not just similar and the second disintegrator on the bottom/sides sits behind the normal one and the base of it is larger than the section of the ship is mounted on so it hangs over the sides.
---
Fake. They don't talk doesn't mean they don't exist. People just want to play a game, they don't need to shoot at people to have fun.
---
Every, Active, Player, Is, A, Potential, Subscriber.
---
IMO the null sec is where CCP ruin EVE. People farm there making ISK inflation and they ISK PLEX instead of actually paying. You should be thankful there are still player willing to sell  PLEX for ISK because the item are getting ridiculously expensive thanks to all the VNI botting that they can never get good ships unless they sell PLEX and get a few billion instantly. Once you successfully make the hi-sec PLEX seller all quit, you're not gonna get any more easy PLEX. The PLEX price will skyrocket like Chinese server and that will be the true end of EVE.
---
Breaking news: After Goonswarm dropped their supercap umbrella to defend its rorquals from the Triglavian invasion, the Triglavians have also escalated the fight.
---
Triglavian Titan: *Sees supercaps* *Laughs in XL Entropic Disintegrator*

Perfect. 25b base plus abyssal rolls. I'll have it done this weekend 😇
---
Jesus christ, shut the fuck up.
---
You fucking autists still play a fucking game that's nearly two decades old and has BARELY CHANGED AT ALL except bring in new ships and shinier graphics. Still the same fucking broken-ass clusterfuck of a game it's always been. And you were ALL fucking stoked for DUST and the plans for integration, you just wanted to sound cool for daddy Mittani when he started bashing it, so you started bashing it too.
---
Hey you know what I can do in Star Citizen? Literally anything but stare at the same ugly fucking ships all the fucking time.

Don't @ me

What do you use those skills for though?

He told me he was kicked/left. I'm not certain about details but I assume it was something along the lines of just regular drama that happens in groups from time to time.
---
but you see, republicans are evil so we must attack them whenever we can at all times because hatred of them transcends politics
---
For a Retribution I usually get kills by staying around 20-30km off of the target and kiting the drones as much as possible. If the VNI is an idiot you can get away with just orbiting them and using Standard or Multifrequency ammo. You might need to kill their drones, but fortunately they rarely have more than one flight of Warrior IIs.
---
The biggest mistake that I keep making is getting within web/scram range, especially when I'm burning in for initial tackle. If they can reduce your speed you're dead.
---
&gt; IMO the null sec is where CCP ruin EVE.
---
Yes. So the argument is CCP should focus on nullsec to fix the game.
---
Try around Asakai / Okkamon area, most people are after 1v1s.
---
Anything with a cyno.
---
Use the Development Snapshot, it includes a Dark Theme.
---
Thanks for the kind words! But no, I gave that up years ago. The level of daily flak I was receiving made the positives of the experience no longer worth it.
---
Retri and arty Wolf are both good for solo roaming null.
---
Rorquals don't introduce isk into the game though.
---
I never knew something could sound this thick bullshit
---
Good.
---
Would you happen to have a fit for the arty wolf?
---
Thinking about trying out this game, is there a newbie faq link?
---
Is catch running dry?
---
Good enough then
---
Couldn't you just deploy an ESS and collect 10% tax + LP from the bots? :P
---
This is a solid fit: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76510265/
---
But I prefer no resistance mods, instead a nano and a tracking enhancer. Or two nanos. 
---
It takes a bit of practice but is a fantastic ship.
---
Probably because super ratting is not allowed in catch. And so he protests with this.
---
That's too deep
---
I already have, it causes lag server side and as a result slow loading grids that's why the GM said no.
---
PSA: Check your redeemable items, there might be some skill points running out in ~14 days
---
God forbid someone try to roam in Eve, eh?
---
Never dropped a cap on someone, never fit a cyno on any ship. Any other recommendations?
---
Yes. Null sec should be more punishing. The nullsec carebears are ruining the game.
---
But you need to fix the broken economy first.
---
Our corp's newbro can't afford to buy himself just a spare T1 cruiser doing hi-sec stuff all day. The hi-sec is barren A F in every term of game experience which is just ridiculously wrong as a game design. Casual player just want to shoot some stuff that he know he's gonna able to be shooting down while being able to afford the loss when he make mistake, since he/she is JUST A  DAMN NEWBRO. Now hi-sec newbro simply cannot afford his/her lost ship due to stupidly inflated ISK that their only option is to sell PLEX or do some AFK mining (then risk their retriever getting CODEed). After a few more frustrating experience they will eventually leave.
---
The game is at the very end of it's lifespan if they are not fixing the doomed newbro experience. On-line count is constantly dropping indicating more and more player leaving and EVE is unable to keep newbro around since it's so HARDCORE. I'd rather go F with Sekiro, at least you get checkpoints. In EVE you can't save any shit once you lose them and they really need to help newbro about this. EVE is not getting over it with CCP.
---
in the sidebar my guy
---
I was wondering whether the content that they will be introducing is where this HAC will be useful, and of course it would be great against PIRAT Nestor balls...
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

I'd like to see T4 and T5 abyssal sites spit you out in a random system as well.
---
I still got my bpc from the collectors edition, if I ever feel like they got too expensive.
---
It is known.
---
The veles always had a higher damage modifier, but couldn't use the t2 ammo. Now, if you have t2 skills to use the ammo the veles will be purely superior.
---
Shit even Mittens has a picture framex picture of Mittens in a picture frame.
---
Just curious, what is your opinion on all the skillfarms getting free stuff they can sell for additional profit?
---
God, this was incoherent as fuck.
---
Rorqs create bulk carriers and supers.
---
Those introduce significantly more isk. At least thats how I view it.
---
thats an oddly wrong statement. most ppl i know that small gang and roam look for fights but dont get them. On average locals dont form for you when roaming their space. they rather just dock up and wait. However when you tackle some ratting or mining ship they are more inclined to undock to save it so you get your fight. Also i rather kill a pve rattle after 2h of roaming and getting no fight than killing nothing after 2h of roaming and just logging off.
---
So I have trained to supercarriers... nerfed
---
Two weeks ago I have bought turbo gila fit and put a lot injectors for Gila skills... 
---
What won't be nerfed before I get into it and would give me avg 250 mln / h for single account?
---
What the hell are you talking about? Everything T1 has actually become cheaper over the recent years thanks to Rorquals.
---
From what i know he said to ig leadership he was leaving with a few of their members to do other things and they were very accommodating, then he randomly attempted a coup, try to use shares to get ceo again and failed.

Really any of the frogs should be left alone if they move shit for people

From my other post: From what i know he said to ig leadership he was leaving with a few of their members to do other things and they were very accommodating, then he randomly attempted a coup, try to use shares to get ceo again and failed.

---
Nullsec is breaking the economy.
---
See edit :)
---
Fuckoff
---
doesnt look bad at all tbh
---
You just have to pay for a more expensive gun every time you buy the ship instead of the SP
---
 We don't care about communism or not, include race, religion, nationality......etc. The core of politics is benefit, ideology just serve for propaganda. Mr. Mantou is a wise man. He treated conflict of interest very well, how poor you can't see a big picture behind.

Well yeah I had hoped skill injectors would be more restrictive but it didn’t stop people dumping money.
---
Fuck I'm hard
---
OMG! IF WE EVER LEAVE FUCKING BASE AGAIN WITH 2 FUCKING REGEN BEADS, I'M KILLING FUCKING ALL OF YOU

AWESOME! The risk vs reward ratio is coming back into align in this part of the game, at least
---
&gt;space is dangerous
---
Get rid of asset safety in nullsec.
---
Do it before june 4th please.
---
*shakes walking stick* back in my day, seeing a player created in 2007 was an "ohshit, this guys jacked on SP" moment. Now days, I can only imagine it's entirely meaningless.
---
tl;dr of a significant part of this sub
---
have updoots
---
Yeah hard to tell since a 30 day could be spilling over with sp.
---
Could you get into Drake's just to see em nerfed for old times sake?
---
DarkFenX is on fire lately! 
---
I reported a very minor bug and 2 days later it was fixed!
---
The price matching a fits mods is also a killer feature.
---
yeah, do it were literally no one take care about their Dscan and carry combat probes
---
Leasing land to your own members is not a good thing to do though.  Fair enough, take it as a stealth tax off the corps directly, but don't outright bill line members to rat in space they helped take.
---
VNIs
---
It depends on how you're trying to grow your finances, there are arguments to be made for many paths to accrue tax income.
---
I see your argument, but I also don't see something wrong with a small tax, similar to how I don't see anything wrong with a small tax IRL.
---
Delve, Esoteria are the most cancerous regions for supers dropping on you. Honestly the biggest problem you’ll have VNI hunting in a retri in my experience is people baiting with a loki cloaked on grid, sebos give it 2s lock time and 5s cloak targeting delay means that if you’re MWDing you have 2s to react to it decloaking (5s align with MWD on). Which depending on latency can be near impossible, dual webs and arties will probably just alpha you. As for brawling shit (like the wolf) VNIs people will bait you in a combat fit then scram web you and pop (or light cyno). Typically this is less prevalent in renter regions in my experience but those are often bots and are hard to catch due to this. My suggestion would be learning to Dscan well and using a hyper ceptor alt to tackle for you (only way you’ll catch bots) if you are set on trying to go VNI hunting.
---
C3 rattle -&gt; 200-300M/h
---
C5 solo dread a little less than 1b/h
---
I totally agree but I don't think this conflicts with this part of the OP's post:
---
&gt; Remember the game's foundations: hardcore loss, isk is valuable, losses hurt, wealth is rare, space is dangerous, Risk is balanced by reward, and everything is spooky and unknown. Its what once made the game great and it will do so again.
---
The risk/reward balance is massively favouring null at the minute which is meaning it's relatively pointless staying in High for little ISK when you can be basically as safe in a Rorqual in null because there is no reason for anyone to invade anyone else and, even if they wanted to, the game mechanics make it insanely hard to do so instead of:
---
* Sneak a fleet into enemy space to grind cyno jammers and hope that they don't notice and don't just follow you around and put up new ones 5 mins later
---
* Grind out a citadel or, if you're lucky, all 12 in that system. Go back to point 1 and repeat twice more at times you are likely weakest
---
* Grind out other completely pointless structures
---
* Play a hide-and-seek Faction Warfare plex mini-game in entosising
---
* Mine and rat as much as you can to get the services needed to claim the space as your own.
---
* Gain very little benefit as you get about as much from this system as you would've done by krabbing away in the systems you already control
---
What if changing the loot fairy equation to be 100% module drop would start a war that never ends?

Vargurs. 
---
Just premature bastion, and smash that MJD.
---
True for in most cases, not for titans or trig guns (atm). The changes could effect the market aswell so I guess we’ll see.
---
No but they changed the distribution of mineral-investment ISK from everywhere else in the game to null increasing the reward element of null whilst the risk of null has dropped (super umbrellas, cyno jammer buffs, sov system discouraging invasions)
---
has it been 5 years already? wow i was there when the sh.. kicked off, i was also following everything you were posting even before this all broke. you stuck to your word as i knew you would. Soon you will be able to clear the fog and dish the details, i for one salute you and promise i will be there with my popcorn and my keyboard. have at it jester it has been a long time coming.
---
You say that but we are getting Trig Invasions/Incursions thus more normal space people will be getting loot from them without the need to go into Abyssal space. Easier access means lower prices as supply increases.
---
    
---
  
---
Sure the first week or two it will be a jolt to the market and you can make your money, however I don't expect long term high prices after the patch unless some new, not introduced/hinted ship/mod/thing comes up that will eat up extra supply. Saying that, if the supply spikes up, trig ships become a viability for line ships in the mega coalitions kind of how Macarials where in use once the BPC/Hulls where common as dirt and only stopped as main line after CCP nerfed them and their BPC drop rates
---
Takes a shit on his casket.
---
Lol. Mcav has free sabres.
---
This is what roaming is these days in eve sadly, and it's fucking depressing. You don't really run into pvp for pvp's sake because everyone is too busy farming up spod.
---
You scan down wormholes to a place that has high indexes, take a roam out to try to tackle a rorq or a super, and wait for people to show up to defend it. Hell, half the content of the previous month for me was kiki roams to goons to tackle a rorq and frag fighters they send at us after dropping 20 titans and supers. It's something, but it's not that fun compared to real fights.  It seems like most people are content to just pve and +1 their isk counter for some imaginary future in which they get a big fancy ship and then never undock it for fear of losing it. Better PVE more to get isk to replace it just in case I ever do undock it, oh nevermind I'll just buy another big ship and not undock that. Repeat ad naseum.
---
Also bulgarians
---
Yeah I understand, that was my idea honestly as prices will definitely spike up for at least a week or two until everyone gets a steady flow of mats running on the market and I haven’t been around long enough but as you said they nerfed Machs, so I’m pretty sure Triglavian ships would get the same nerf sooner or later, because I’ve encountered Triglavian fleets and oh god are they not a good fight lol..
---
Have a flock of ECM bursting ceptors and fucks them up
---
You plebian just cannot appreciate his abnormous intelligence and deep analytical prowess displayed in this professionally condensed piece of artwork. 
---
Works like those aspire to be more than mere mortal and need to be pinned the second a mod, enlightened enough to grasp the mere genius contained, lays their unworthy eyes upon posts like these.
---
They really need to make changes to asset safety. Right now it's just pointless to bash structures and nothing matters. Just have it be a scale if you want where you get a 20% chance of your shit to be saved by asset safety (call it like an emergency teleport that can only get so much stuff for lore reasons v0v), lowsec 50% and highsec 80% or something. Give me SOME reason to bash a structure other than "hopefully people will show up to fight for one of these timers", which invariably turns into bashing the shield timer alone, probably bashing armor alone as well, and then they batphone the universe for the last timer so there's no hope of a good fight and it's bb. It's a fucking awful gameplay loop.
---
They've also adjusted the way trig guns drop so potentially that will change. It should adjust in the near future
---
Needs.
---
More. 
---
Cocaine!
---
how does that tell you which region/class the k162 you're looking at go to?

Don't blame CCP - blame yourself
---
Been doing L3 Sec Missions in Amarr space. It seems like fighting only blood raiders and sansha is a thing of the past. Every other missions seems to be have the resists and damage type I did not prep for. Are L3/4 missions random damage types, or does the concept of "you fight these NPC's in this area" apply somehow? I do read the mission briefs but they typically never say what faction I'll be fighting, just "pirates".
---
Be sarcastic all you like but numbers don't lie!  People are quiting and not temporarily it seems.
---
The peak of Ishtar popularlity was well after that change.
---
Welcome to any online games
---
&gt;In terms of tanking ability, it is most likely going to be far superior to the drekavac
---
Sweat some fits and look at some pyfa graphs. It is certainly not far superior and flat out worse in many scenarios. Generally the Ikitursa should tank better against many battleship builds and worse against everything else in small and medium engagements. Personally I also value the MJD more than an assault damage control. Bit disappointed in those ships, especially in the Nergal because it is hard to imagine a situation in which you can take advantage of the additional spool up and it only has 2 high slots as opposed to the Damavik.
---
3 consecutive nerfs. First to damage, then the range, then they rearranged slot layout -1 mid +1 low.
---
Set the rest of legacy red and watch it burn ?
---
In WWB we fought goons. In 2019 we'd be fighting game mechanics.
---
Well 50% of NC. Is PL alts
---
all you have to do to shake that tree is attack someone...
---
Sometimes my friend capri, all you need is; passion, will, and a desire for blood and carnage to do something great.
---
Blood for the Bob god.
---
Talk to you soon ;)
---
Its literally the opposite. Large alliances have plenty of krabs to mine everything even vaguely valuable. Smaller groups have less dudes to defend them and are generally less interested in mining.
---
Personally I find using a hyperspacial hictor to be the most botting VNI kills/minute. Make a bookmark about 50km off their warpout astra towards most of the anoms. Then every time  enter system, warp to bookmark and bubble up. Most will be too quick on their warpouts but from time to time some will be to slow. Just doing the circuit in a botting pocket will net you steady kills.
---
It is quite a bit more risky then a retri/kikimora though.
---
We used them a bunch when I was in Horde. They were pretty good against your eagles, much better than our Muninns most of the time
---
Lol no. No way an eve player has time to fucking watch movies.
---
SirMolle seems to be inactive based on zkill. But I can confirm I’ve seen Evolution pilots flying around with NC. quite often
---
There are far more ways to catch bots, for example:
---
Some Bots are killing bubbles at their POS / Station / Safespot. Drop One jump out of system (or log off) and wait 4 - 10 Minutes (depends on the bot) and tada free VNI Kills (Bring enough points to point all of them). For example most Bots of Ranger Regiment and Renting Corps in Tenal is arround 4 to 5 Minutes.
---
We encountered some Carrier Bots in Branch (i think it was Ranger Regiment too) which accepted Fleet Invites... Just invite them to your fleet and warp them out of their tower. 
---
But the most Funny thing is Login Traps for Super Bots just place a sabre on the tower, loggout and wait.
---
Don't forget to report those assholes after you destroyed their ships and raped their corpses.
---
In this meta? Nah, its timezone tank and sov cancer (Cyno jammers and jump gates didnt help) alll the way down
---
I'm not entirely set on VNI hunting, I'd be happy to fight anything at all. But thank you for the info.
---
Tether is meant to simulate being in a POS shield. You are vulnerable to being bumped if you’re either AFK or in a ship too big to dock in the structure you’re tethered on (supers and Titans only dock in Keepstars, normal caps only forts and keepstars), but beyond that you’re safe
---
Mmmm, battleships. I love me some battleships.
---
is that the double nano puls retri?
---
lol have an upboat
---
I struck up convo with this dude several times we roamed through CVA space, all he could talk about how CCP was out to get him and every update has fucked him and CVA over, I couldn't help but feel pity for the guy, even though he may be the founder of CVA and this is just a game, there's something about him that made me feel bad for him, if you can stick around a game that long enough and see it through multiple iterations you have to have a certain kind of passion.
---
A Guy of my alliance tried that some months ago, but the most got killed by other roaming gangs.
---
The Loot of Bots is worth more :)
---
The ZPC and crystalline market is so incredibly manipulated, I did it myself
---
Bumping prices from 80k to 180k for only a day where it now stays around 105K. This makes so much money and is so easy to do due to its limited supply. Im sure others are doing it aswell.
---
Self-awareness won't save this post
---
For now.

I’ve occasionally turned all the graphics / effects on and it really is a beautiful game. One day I’ll build a new pc...my current one was a beast when eve came out )
---
gank style hecate.  
---
sub 2s align time  
---
up to 700dps, so you will have a killmark or be dead quickly. you don't care about back up or cyno  
---
cheap as fuck  
---
have combat probe : if everyone run away from you, steal the drones they leave in space. or kill MTU to make them angry.
---
Avoid guristats and serpentis space because kine/thermal resist
---
Yep sounds about right.
---
l think what you want and what the game needs is two different things
---
All hail space mom!
---
yes, also no tether
---
Just use pathfinder or any other tracking tool. No need for lists.

Can relate

That’s a great deal !!! I’d bite his hand off if I were you !

I'm not even mad if someone skill injects their way to 200m sp, that is an absurd amount of money for a single character that keeps the game alive.
---
I wish i have train my first char from 2005...
---
Thank you for the insightful post, when I jumped onto Sisi full of excitement I was horribly disappointed with the AF and HAC. 
---
I will have to wait for the Pyfa release to see the proper active tanking stats, but I cannot see a use for the AF at all. The ADC is not worth the horrible range and long spoolup. The 5 small drones are a nice touch though. 
---
The HAC looks just simply worse then the Drekavac. Even a capital is not being shot for 5 minutes straight and yes you do have the ADC, but lose the MJD and link possibility.
---
How you feel about the command dessie? I think it's ok, but the 3 mids hurt it for solo use. Given that you cannot fit a small cap booster after the point/mwd and mjd. For fleet use I don't see it having a place in armor fleets.
---
ohhhhh dominon trailer ..i joined the game because of the trailer ... back in 2011
---
wtf kind of name for an alliance is blood demon, name it woman period next time
---
tbh it's been ages that we found one dude running absyssal in wh
---
Can we get a F in chat for the severe beating this boi just took.
---
&gt;  I always get messed up when they launch warrior IIs no matter the frigate I am in.
---
Simple, defang them before you get killed. If you're in a fast frigate like a garmur or nano astero warriors and alcolites are the only danger to you, after you have killed all of them you can take your time chewing through the passive tanked VNI.
---
really was hoping for them to take unattended sov . But one can one hope i guess
---
It was for Eve Amsterdam. Jin’taan gave me his for free !!! Win !!!
---
263mil here :D 2.8 unallocated. No injectors.
---
How’s Rage going? 
---
Face it dude, Imperium killed your god.
---
Keep going.
---
These screenshots will be very useful to me in the near future.
---
Not a bad idea! Ill buy a few of these.
---
I've never heard of a nano-astero; do you have a fit?

Fight the botting menace with its worst enemy - itself!

I like it - i'll give it a try!

I certainly think that he has an enormous amount of passion for what he created in providence.

The color of the wh itself can tell what sec, but afaik you wont know exact til you jump in ;)

Have fun bud!

There is no must, the pleasure is all mine.

Death, destruction, and blood is all I need to promise, and thousands will come to drink is the pleasures of yours and others demise...
---
Anyone tell me how to import my character into it? First time user. Thanks.
---
Well I’m definitely guilty of something like that, 50.5mil SP, 2mil unallocated... I trained up most of the mandatory skills plus almost maxing all gunnery/missile skills but the ship skills (spaceship command)  I have been training them naturally...
---
Don't just get one alt, get ten
---
Dreads, carriers, cyno recon, covert Loki, captors and many many more
---
I think eve need some pve remastering instead of new incursions. Agent missions, nullsec anomalies, fw, sansha incursions, static complexes are broken for a many years.
---
I've been played since 2007, and agents hasn't been changed any time.
---
[Here is a good hunter fit in action.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH0RDVlY1GI)

So I can run relic sites while looking for viable targets and still have a high suitability. You can complement it with a polarized bomber on a second account if you need more DPS.
---
Also directly confirmed by the description for the third stage of the Triglavian invasion:
---
&gt;*A mysterious Triglavian vessel has been detected. The Collective's "World Ark" is enormous and could be the largest vessel in New Eden.*
---
Note the use of the term ***vessel***.
---
I don't quite see how you get the numbers to get where your graphs show
---
Also, you can go for a strong AC fit for more damage and tank, but you lose speed / agility and you have to commit a bit more. 
---
The jag is also pretty solid for this, though the damage is pretty terrible so you often find the target gets backup before you can wear him down (depending on what / where you’re hunting).
---
6 Rorquals or bust.
---
And a boson Avatar to show everybody how fucking elite you are!
---
Damn :/
---
Well, MAYBE the Ikitursa and other T2s re not meant for fast PVP with smaller targets? Does every ship needs to be the same? They are great as an anti-capital ships and sieging ships so far, its called specialization.
---
He was kicked? Can we look forward to some drama logs soon?
---
And then bewbro of 1 week old shows up "i got 150 mil SP dude"
---
Pilot! I likes your dedication.
---
I guess it depends on your play style. There’s a bunch of people who like to have their alt warp in because they can’t do a fair 1v1.
---
I mean ... I suppose there’s no harm in having your alt on standby and if you get jumped you can escalate it yourself.
---
Don’t be the guy who warps your alt in to make it 2v1 though ;)
---
Well, not telling you how to play but you get my drift.
---
I wAnT t0 pEWpEw
---
That is so true. Goons chinese and test are printing out so Mutch damn isk these days especially goons
---
Tech 2 Triglavian ships are not Triglavian. They are modified variants of Triglavian ships produced by Galelnte, Caldari, Minmatar and Amarr. Each of the T2 ships even has an empire logo on it. Its possible Triglavians have another type of cruiser. Could be added as a Faction variant later possibly.
---
The nebulae you see in the wormhole are the skybox you will see in the destination system.
---
Most wormholers learn pretty quickly to tell the class of w-space system by looking at the wh. 
---
K-Space is more difficult because k-space regions are less distinctive, but it's pretty easy to at least tell the rough area.
---
E.g. if it's very bright golden it's core Amarr space (Tash Murkon, Domain, Providence, etc). Darker gold is usually deep south, like Catch/Stain. Same with blue/green/red for the other cardinal directions. Plus the distinctive nebulae of some nullsec regions.
---
Nothing on the wormhole itself will tell you the security class though, that's only in the show info window.
---
No they aren’t really, that’s the point.
---
Yea in high sec it's recruiters newbro's.  People trading and traveling to jita and incursions and a few high sec corps doing their things.
---
T2 guns with Spec 5 outdamage all other guns with all ammo, don't be bad.
---
Exactly they all afraid of losing their wealth and ships. They need something to fight over
---
What they should do is find a lead designer who actually has a vision for the game and communicate that to the playerbase. Since Seagull left I have absolutely no idea who's in charge or where they're taking the game or why I should be excited about anything.
---
If you're #truesolo, you can't go wrong getting inspired by what Tomalak does: https://zkillboard.com/character/95574399/
---
But you should, that 2k+ you put into eve over the past 10+ years makes you a contributor to the eve we know and meh today.
---
I've done a post two days ago about this, exactly this
---
And now triple that up, 2 Accounts subbed continously with only 4 months break in 2011 from 2007.09. 3rd Account since 2009
---
I’d go further and move the fitting bonus that is currently per level into role bonus, removing remote rep bonuses is what I’ve suggested but maybe removing one of the others is more thematic, then giving it the HAC 10% optimal range bonus as second/level instead. 
---
I had proposed splitting the 20% ramp max/level into 10% ramp max + 10% ramp speed for same ramp time overall but ~30% more damage than Vedmak, but keeping the higher damage could be ok for the fairly vanishing number of situations it would be useable in.
---
Because when you put too much mass through a hole when closing it sometimes you don't spawn on a citadel but at an absurdly deep safe.
---
You need max combat probe spread to find my abyssal trace :)
---
literally he is saying if you shoot it at 8pm it will come out at 8pm 2 days later, you choose by the time you begin your attack
---
1.2*1.1 &gt; 1.3.
---
The T2 guns will out damage faction guns, like all the other fucking guns.
---
What if I tell you, you can do both?   
---
They have a balance team that is working hard on fixing PVP. They have a (relatively fresh) group of people who are working together to fix the economy (part of balancing btw.). And it appears they also have people working on the absolutely great Triglavian story line stuff, that is absolutely needed for the game. There are a lot of players in different areas (yes, also highsec) who wish for something like this, it would be stupid to ignore them.
---
Also, according to Hilmar himself, the game is playerwise pretty much in the same state as it used to be. With around 300k monthly subscriptions. The concurrent players don't say shit about a healthy game. If you have 100k players online, but only 100 undocked, its worse than having 1k players online and 500 undocked...
---
This is far too sane to be implemented
---
&gt;Hisec issues are not much connected to ways most people play Eve
---
Simply wrong. Most players are in highsec. That is something the more "engaged" players don't like to realize, but they are only a small portion of the game. It's not that they are less (or more) important, but they are not the most players.
---
Jesus Christ you’re cringey.
---
If you haven't done any of the PVE content in EVE before, I think you could easily have fun for at least a year doing it. A lot of the missions have funny storylines (the first time you run them, at least), there's a lot of different spaces to explore, several different site types that *actually feel different from each other* (and then some that feel just like those). There's a whole host of sites you can scan down &amp; run that have really fun escalations and fun little structures. In addition, a lot of these sites have some fairly pretty assets in them; the world of EVE itself is quite beautiful. The new Abyssal space can be absolutely stunning at times. The Sleeper caches are some *amazing* PvE content; I really wish they would make more stuff like that. I haven't (personally) done the 'special' sleeper-space content (the stuff in their 'home holes' or whatever), but I hear it's quite good, interesting, and requires some coordination to complete. Incursions are obviously another area a group of people could sink some time into &amp; derive some enjoyment from. There are also a lot of epic arcs with somewhat interesting storylines; then ... there's asteroids. :p
---
I found the stuff available in EVE (PvE-wise) to be much more engaging and fun than in a lot of other MMOs. You've got a lot of really cool stuff to look at while your drones or guns go pew pew, you can manually pilot or orbit, you can tailor your fit for what you wanna do. You don't have to press quite as many buttons, but which buttons you press when -- and which buttons you chose to make available -- can be very important.
---
I've done next-to-no (direct) pvp in EVE, but had a blast when playing it. I don't think it makes sense to compare the PvE in EVE to something like WoW. It's just real different. You can also just get murdered randomly 'cause someone decided they wanted to.
---
Exactly.
---
Or try getting a friend
---
Dude found RAZOR hehe
---
Use your alt as bait in something cheap and engageable and have your main sitting in a recon next to him. When it's quiet you're still making a decent amount of lp. It's basically the afk VNI of lowsec.
---
I've sold my collection of fully researched blueprints (all T1 frigs and destroyers, a handful of cruisers, a sprinkling of ammo and all combat drones, and a set of rigs) along with my Orca because I couldn't compete without spinning up multiple accounts. 
---
On one hand it's great because I can run L4s/explore/whatever for an hour and then go welp in lowsec for a bit. On the other hand it's kind of sad to lost enthusiasm for the building side of the game.
---
No u
---
i would also like to know how to get some of the sounds that arent part of the "soundtrack" like for example the background ambiente of the stations, amarr has this sick temple chant thing going on
---
How so?
---
I second this.
---
Can’t online the module once it’s attacked unless you know they are coming there is no way to stop the rf unless you defend it
---
noU
---
VINDICATION
---
For a bit of history (if my memory serves) -- at one point, EVE didn't have voice comms built in to the game; then they added it, for a monthly fee; then they rolled that in, so everyone paid for it; then they got rid of it. I think people prefer using third-party tools to take care of their stuff anyways -- CCP wants to build a videogame, not handle all the little things that can go wrong when you try to get a few hundred people all talking together, all around the world; they don't want to deal with adding all the little usability features that make something like mumble, teamspeak, or discord so nice to interact on.
---
I can say that I once was like you (except, instead of being unable to play a lot b/c of being old -- I was a little too young, and so unable to play so much). I was in a corp that was fairly casual; the last thing I remember is the corp splitting up, in large part because half the people wanted to move out to nullsec, and half the people really not wanting to (and half of those who went really not being 'hardcore' enough to realistically make it out there, with the minimal infra we had). From what I understood, this wasn't an uncommon occurrence at the time.
---
I don't think you're wrong to play EVE in highsec -- but I do think that the game is *quite enjoyable* to play with friends, siblings, just other people. There's a whole lot of things you can do with 2-3 people, that're really challenging to do all by yourself. I would also say that there's a lot of content you're missing out on in low/null/w-space (for a PvE player); I think you *can* do some of this content solo, and casually [ex: exploring]. You can also do it with buddies.
---
Are you sure that there aren't corps that would want someone like you, and would have space in low/null? Or do you not want to have to deal with all the BS that most of EVE's corps currently require?
---
And posting something like this doesn't?
---
What they need is a new server with no skill injectors.  Just start over you know how Fun that Will he especially nullsec. New alliances and coalitions.   Better Then the static stuff with huge alliances that are raising the Plex prices and makes it unpayable.
---
Eve is the old pair of trainers I keep. They're comfy, reliable, my feet don't hurt when I walk the dog in them.
---
I've played for a significant chunk of the last 7 years. I've been in nullsec alliances, done blob roams and small gang fighting, exploration and mission running, manufacturing... You get the idea.
---
I always end up based in hisec, playing mostly solo. For me there's a difference between playing solo and having no interaction with anyone else. I'll chat in local, occasionally pick up with old friends, and every time I undock I'm in competition with others.
---
''high iq''  ''rent''  ok...
---
Valar's avatar reminds me of Darth Vaders head from RotJ when Luke takes Vader's helmet off
---
Needs a prop mod. Drop enams for mission specific active hardeners and cap mods can be replaced with a cap booster. The time you save more than makes up for the isk you spend on the cap booster charges
---
At the TTK you're aiming for before the hammer drop, they're only just overtaking the drek, which is significantly cheaper, in per ship cumulative damage on target. 
---
If you have enough ships to be realistically aiming for the 5-10minute window on a super, you'll get limited value from their extra dps after 5 minutes over a drek, not enough to justify their price given they are stuck in boson range with mystic.
---
This said, the EHP is solid bricked up, competitive with sac, and decent if not stellar with 2 damage mods, so there's a good ship in there somewhere.
---
Failed coup attempt by him.
---
Yes but how does that make sense lore wise or eve wise. Why should ships be safe if the thing holding them gets fucked? 
---
I want my slave pod to instantly jump to the nearest npc station if my ship blows.
---
Sounds unprovi to me haha. Can you elaborate more please? :D
---
That’s a cracking question and I’d be interested in the answer as I’m in a similar place with Loki related skills queued up.
---
In my area that doesn't work. Since most bots react on neutrals entering the systems, they start their warp exactly that moment. Means every bubble you place after that moment, will be too late.
---
The nano, beam retribution, as quite a few have said, is very good for this. They are not they easiest to fly because the cap drains quickly if you need to run the repper/point/MWD and guns.
---
If you want to go one step up in size to destroyers then the Kikimora is a beast solo, with a good ability to kill tackle if need be. It is quite a bit more expensive then most of the frigate options but also quite a bit more comfortable when killing VNI's. 
---
Want to do go destroyers while not spending the 300M+ for a Kikimora then I would recommend the dual MSE autocannon svipul. They both take down ratting VNI's without problems.
---
What Will happen on June 4th?
---
Well, seems like I´ll have to keep my Orka ready to safe my ships again\^\^
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
Get into a faction warfare corporation / alliance, they should explain to you everything you need to know.
---
The Cruiser will also get changed and loose it´s range bonus for a tank bonus
---
I'm running around Amamake for now, it's not too shaddy. There is some people batting with a T1 frig to get a kill with there pirat frigate that could totally have managed you alone, but most people get into plexes wanting solo fights, so don't get too frustrated if it's not the case.
---
10 000 new players try EvE every week.
---
The initial idea was to make them more appealing than a POS to ease the transition to citadels. And they got nerfed a little, aka easier to kill if not fueled.
---
I don't get it?
---
&gt;Taking some press talk nonsense more seriously than the fact that when you launch the game it doesn't say 50k players online.
---
Loki and tengu are very similar.
---
Missile-wise, tengu gets longer range and I feel a slightly faster rate of fire. Loki has higher damage output all around (both weapon sysytems).
---
Tank, tengu comes out on top with shield, but Loki can swing shield or armor tank, making it very versatile.
---
Proteus and tengu both make great hunters for Blops work.
---
Proteus has a slight weakness though where if even a small sized neut touches it, it runs out of cap.
---
Legion does great neut work, probably the top t3c when it comes to wormholes.... but I find its damage output really lackluster.
---
I'm a grumpy old gamer who pereferd the Eve graphics back in 2008. It had a B-Movie Sci Fi feel to it. Stations were wardrobes in space. I've lowered my graphics settings to try to replicate it.
---
Then again I just bought an Astero skin for 35 million......
---
Except to them.
---
Well, because it makes sense.
---
Of course more people are better for the game.
---
 But it is more important to have actual active players than "just" people online. CCP was and is working on that a lot.
---
The #eveisdiyng nonsense is not much better :P
---
Logi so it doesn't show up on your 'solo'  killmail.
---
And if you could just get the art team working on all those bug fixes and balance changes that I decided we need, that'd be great.
---
How many kills do you get per hour?
---
No, the hacks will only get a fitting bonus for Utility high modules, and an higher spool up limit when it comes to ship bonuses.  
---
Also, the Vedmak looses it´s range bonus for a new resist bonus
---
Don't forget 100k players online and 80k are alts that are afk. But there is like 20 to 30.000 People online and 10 to 15k alts.
---
If you really just want to train for one, then you can't be wrong with the Loki. It can fill almost any role, be it armor or shield, be it brawling or kiting. Unfortunately, it's a pretty easy choice actually because the Loki is just so good and versatile.
---
Don't forget that you're taking fights that you're the only one looking for.
---
I'm not a goon, but yesterday we had guys roaming in the pocket out of a fresh wh. They tried to kill orcas, hulks... So we formed, and we were having some fun in our home pocket, with a few kikis,retrib, garmur and jackdaws, and we were in harpies, dramiels, stratios. It was all fun and games until we formed a few caracals, feroxs, eagles. So they jumped back into their wh, and took heavy ships (tornados, Typhoon, onyx, and stuff)
---
So I dropped carriers on them. 
---
You can look for winning fights. But don't forget that most of us are defending our homes as well. It's not just about peeveepee. 
---
 Non consensual PvP will always lead to over reactions. It's a way to say "get the fuck out of my home".
---
It has less tank and less resists, and the difference in sig isn't worth losing all utility and range. Also they are less agile.
---
Now when it comes to the ADCU issue, yes it's nice in a fleet fight but if you're in the type of fight to alpha ships you're going to likely be fighting ferox, muninn, Loki, etc. All of which just sit 50km away completely out of the Iki's sphere of influence. Trading the ADCU for the ability to shoot back is beyond worth it.
---
nice! I must admit I am a pvp noob though - any chance of getting the  fleshed out hecate fit you're suggesting? :-)
---
rather try to come up with fits and tactics that enable you to deal with multiple targets at once. eve pvp isn´t fair. solo isn´t fair. that´s why it´s fun and engaging. to fight uphill battles, to overcome your less skilled enemies and to see them driven before you. evening the field by using alts is the easy way out and should be reserved for the weak. are you weak?
---
I had the best efforts with an insta warping ceptor.
---
You go from system to system, try to catch some by initially warping to the sites they usually do, like hubs or forsaken hubs. If you catch some, already nice, if not, especially when there are too many sites, you just place bookmarks. By that you sometimes have a nice list of systems you can go to and kill several VNI's in a row.
---
Interestingly bots from the same alliance very often differ in terms of fittings and timings. That's funny as you can kinda divide a region into smaller region-parts, where you can tell which "pockets" are good to hunt in at what times. 
---
I find it interesting that logging of works, as i very often struggle to catch botting VNI's even with bookmarks, and a  "&lt; 2AU" warpin. With my ceptor i can be there within 3-4s, but thats already too late they hit their warp and are gone. But maybe you're faster with that loggin-safety-warp.
---
I think the log-off trap works good in big systems, where you have basically 0 chance to catch VNI's on a regular way, if the system has a diameter above 50 and sites are basically in the middle of the system where your warping distance exceeds 25 AU and more.
---
It's sad that there are alliances that are secretly accepting botting renter corps/alliances in their systems. Sad enough if you talk to them and they are like "we really have no idea, just talk to this guy, he will take care of that" and you point out that you killed more then 60 VNI's of theirs, reported like 70+ bots already and the whole renter alliance has not even 300 members ... so almost every third char is a bot and it's really unlikely that i am the first one who see that issue there. Money is too good it seems ... &gt;:-(
---
...One of the oldest standing groups in the game that has maintained it's original identity in game.
---
Don't inbound gates to a system go offline temporarily when traffic control is enabled?
---
I had to use potato mode once. not being able to see through a k162 wormhole was disconcerting to say the least.

Does pathfinder support more than 10 people yet? it was really cool until we had more than that.
---
Tripwire ftw.
---
a239 is red sky box, time to roll.
---
&gt;The PCU in 2012 was inflated by mass multiboxing and the PCU in 2019 is all humans
---
Yeah ok guess you're right.
---
Why was the spoiler the hardest part of your car to clean?
---
&gt; RemindMe! May 13th, 2019.
---
Fraternity alliance.
---
you know...the lore...muh immersion.
---
But a pink Erebus is fine lore-wise...you know...CCP excuses...
---
Yeah i got a buddy in that area who lives in the neirhbouring area and is like "so gonna do more sites, and then gonna farm some frat" ... :D
---
But i was more talking about Gemini Whale United ... an alliance that is heavily associated with Ranger Regiment ...
---
Idk why you would want to add such sadistic changes. Aside from being cruel
---
As a 2004 character, this makes me sad. Currently only 104 million SP as I've only recently started playing again after a long time away.
---
Kinda wish I'd kept my sub going all this time :/
---
You can kill anything in anything if the target is afk.
---
Don't fall for the elite pvp bullshit.
---
"in god we rust"
---
idk, i had a giggle
---
Are you trying to say they are to blame?
---
If you cannot cover Loki Scram range in 7s while MWDing a frigate, you are bad.
---
At worst, you have to cover the web+point range, which in a typical 3km/s+ frigate is also not that hard.
---
Definitely delve if it comes to vni hunting. They'll just drop or camp you when you fly into the wrong direction. Or have a boson titan on my wormhole.
---
I don't see a big problem in esoteria. This test guy just tries to scare you away. 
---
I also hate the drone region for hunting due to massiv amounts of incredible fast reacting vnis and the fact that I keep forgetting what sites to dscan. 
---
Having a wormhole with nullsec static is propably the only option when it comes to Roaming nowadays.
---
Do you have spec V on all gun types? Do you think that’s a reasonable thing to expect of people?
---
If you want PvE, the answer is quite obvious Tengu. You will get up to 1k reps cold without any investment (982M ISK for 934.9 EHP/s universal with 597 DPS on HAMs) and up to 4.1k cold (6.7k hot, lul, and on 10MN AB) if you go crazy blingy fit with drugs and crystal pod (3.13B ISK for 4105.5 EHP/s universal with 561 DPS on RLMLs).  
---
If you want PvP tho, the story is quite different. While being most tanky T3C, Tengu has no utility (often it is not needed, but). Loki can one shot stuff with arty and/or go webby-kity way and Legion will perform wonders even with only one neut.  
---
I found Proteus is most questionable of them all. You can't really do much with CovOps playstyle apart from brick tank catch-and-hold stuff. Some would argue with that and, yes, Proteus can dish out 816 DPS point blank range cold, but Legion can dish out 959 DPS cold at HAM range.  
---
I've flown Proteus, Tengu and Loki and looking into some laser Legion fit for unique experience and memes. Probably would fly oneshot arty (tho it has no tracking and you will smash your keyboard quite a lot with those missed shots) and generic Tengu again.  
---
P.S. smartbomb Proteus LUL  
---
P.P.S. just check WDS killboard for T3C loses for fits Kappa
---
But it takes 237 seconds before the Ikitursa even does more DPS than the drekavac, isn't that dumb? (assuming they start shooting at the same time)
---
Mine's an '09 character, but has probably been subbed less than a year of that time, so only at 10.8m SP.
---
I liked the part where he used all his cap on his capital prop mod and never turned on his tank.
---
Ughhh it is that hard when you’re dual webbed, that 7s isn’t factoring in reaction time and understanding what’s happening as it decloaks, and the align time of a retri MWDing is over 5s so you have to turn first. They don’t fit scrams they fit dual web and point it’s pretty blood difficult to get out of range of dual OHed loki webs before you die in a nano frigate to arties.
---
Do you usually attack the same target 100% in a fleet engagement for &gt;3-4min?
---
If so you're clearly being FC'd by an idiot. That is the timeframe where the ikitursa' (strong bonus) actually starts kicking in.
---
The command dessie in my opinion should have recieved an extra midslot instead of the Highslot.
---
Its also baffeling to see that CCP nerfed its basic speed to the ground.
---
Kikimoras base speed is 320ms
---
The Draugurs base speed is 240ms 
---
This translates in to differences of 300ms with ab (nolinks)
---
And over 600ms difference with mwd (no links)
---
i had to be very careful not to damage the lettering i had airbrushed on, spelling out "snape kills dumbledore" and "dobby dies"
---
Yea this is a good idea
---
You guys play with more than one account???
---
The best way to get  around that is to just keep roaming. You will eventually get some good fights   out of it.  I prefer to use fast or cloaky ships which helps avoid the hotdrops.
---
dude
---
You don't like occasionally shooting space poops?
---
Not even Jintaan’s love was enough for us to win this one ;(
---
A new server would be nice but fixing the problems with tq should be done first.
---
The only nice things on the prot is the damage output and the 4.5au/s (and the long range scram to catch rolling BS)
---
Lights cyno
---
those arent bots, they are just very dedicated ratters. how dare you, sir!
---
 the opposite will happen, they will all be blue, with only one coalition name: Army of Goonswarm Please Ignore  
---
And so TQ will have a more tragic ending than Serenity
---
I got the tar, feathers, pitchforks, and no torches just flashlights....oh and a bag of dicks.
---
Dont Play it if you dont know how Excel works and dont have a normal life
---
I can't imagine
---
Also, can confirm it's stable as it can be.
---
You can get 4.5au/s on all
---
CCP should open a new server but only for you alone.
---
Yeah fuck adding PVE stuff that doesnt benefit VNI bots! /s
---
Not really, Imperium still has double the supers and titans; 3000 vexor navy issues crunching RMT ISK in havens won't change that balance in the slightest.
---
Maybe make structures in low power vunerable to entosis capture
---
&gt; For the health of the game?
---
lol
---
Get a room ffs
---
yeah but the nulli hurt the agility too much
---
Not on my fits. I use all four for pvp. They all have their strengths
---
Don't know who Seagull is/was, but this.
---
Show us the roadmap.
---
I have seen progress bars on a landing page somewhere, but no details.
---
Ignore that dude. Join a corp. Learn the game. Remember eve is like baseball. Its based on failure 9/10 with sucesses being insanely satisfying.
---
I use tech 2 guns with specialization 5 and yes it's better dps than faction guns for every ammo type (including t2 ammo)
---
Check out eve-uni (google), and search youtube for some tutorials.
---
Opening a new server would only achive that you have an almost empty server. Why swap from tranquility when they are the same anyway? Unless you want to avoid those who have build up an empire, but the same players will probably do the same on the second server anyway, as they know how and would have the manpower to do so. In that case you would probably even see them taking over Null even more, as there would be way less oposition
---
This is my point, I like the idea of proper 1v1 fights, and yes I know EVE is EVE etc with its blob mentality.
---
Having he alt on standby to aid if it happens might be an idea, but given how quickly the fights last it might not be worth it.
---
Thanks for your comments though, makes me lean more towards of just sucking it up and flying solo.
---
Please share you jsig and your main tz,
---
Asking for a friends, for...research purposes
---
thanks, no prop, no point definitely not for roaming in other place than abyssal :D
---
I did think about that at well, just feel its a d\*ck move, but as I just said in another reply that is EVE lol!
---
Number one Tip: Find a newcomer friendly group who you can talk to, who explain things to you directly, not just with providing liks to tutorials or stuff like this. Community is the most important thing in EvE. 
---
Also, don´t try to haste into bigger ships. A slow progress is much better, as the bigger the ships are, the more you will feel the skills you´ll don´t have yet
---
I agree, and to be honest it is a fair response.  I don't really like the idea of using alt's or fellow corp mates to blob a 1v1, it isnt my style, I do think the idea of upping my own game to deal with 2v1 or 3v1 is something I should aspire too.  Thanks.
---
HA, doub't I have the skill or dexterity to manage that many alts ;)
---
Well now there is less danger, more wealth, losses dont really hurt, its very easy going and not spooky at all.
---
Not sure that is fixable anymore.
---
2004 here as well. Sitting at 82m sp 🐵
---
We are not currently blue, we fight each other all the time.
---
Ive had the same, spawned inside the group of Leshaks (around 2000M off) Was lucky there where no webs/neuts. Managed to kill em all and take the loot (80 mil)
---
More ways to play the game = better.
---
More ways to play = more paid subscribers.
---
PVP, PVE, and improvements to the economy and game mechanics = 4 teams.
---
Or 1 team with proper time management.
---
Do you know a group and if so can u tell me how to contact them
---
Lets translate this: 
---
"I don't like how others have more than me so I'm going to be really smart and come up with an idea where I won't have less than others, and then try to package it as if it would be good for the game. Also, I like trains."
---
Imperium is already bigger than all other blocs combined, the 1k toons in army of mango isn't really going to change that.
---
they know whats good
---
EVE Classic would split the playerbase
---
A server wipe would break the chains that bind many bittervets to the game
---
I doubt EVE could survive either option
---
Thera at whatever time the Slavs are awake
---
lol, horde and nc. is also not allies every time they have been neuts right?
---
CCP Ghost said something very important during the EVE FANFEST and recently again while on twitch being interviewed by destiny, social interactions is the key of success in EVE online. Not only PVP but PVE as well. A really good example is WARPTOME, their fleet generate hundred if not thousand of players every week that part take in their fleets, that's content and moving the eco-social system aspect of the game in a positive way and it's far more productive to create new type of incursions and a goal by which players can strive to accomplish and reach than introducing half baked features that will promote afk bot ratting.
---
hahahahaha.... yes...
---
Blue for Ops or if shit hit the floor... For content Neutral.  
---
Also always Third-Party on fights only shooting not legacy fleets.  
---
So yes... Imperium is not Blue to Legacy... :D  
---
Another Spodbrain found the way to reddit.
---
Why? It would just take a few years before we get todays tq again, if they make a new server they need to rewrite all the code, get rid of all bugs, and do serious changes to citadel/sov
---
loki has the most varied applications in pvp, and is currently a master of most of them. The others definitely have their niche uses, like Tengu PvE, Legion neuting subsystem. The prot is quite shit, it was dumpstered in the rework... but even it has some uses exceedingly niche uses.
---
loki can:
---
heavy armor HAM fleet
---
100mn shield HML fleet
---
10mn shield artillery fleet
---
solo cloaky active shield HAMs, good mix of tank + dps
---
superb artillery kiting solo/gang roam ship with long webs
---
logi and links for both armor or shield in both cloaky and non-cloaky setups
---
Burn it all!!! DOWN WITH BORDERS
---
I mean, we already reset them.
---
upvoted for comedic value
---
Dude
---
Invasion force: ... blobing... what a great strat, lets use it! 
---
Actually thinking about it, AI can never be out numbered if it wants to.
---
Well its not a ship meant for null-sec fleet engagements. Now imagine some smaller wormhole engagements, where handful of capitals is on grid and you only have limited amount of ships available.
---
Fucking goons, they got wasted last night and Took Delve again.
---
This. Lol
---
So from what i'm gathering these reasons are not broadly applied to anyone but specifically to religious minorities to have a reason to reeducate them. Allthough i'd still question how this information was aquired.
---
Why is SP injection bad?
---
Lmao, army of goons please ignore, creative 😂
---
Mango of the Imperial Legacy?
---
Generally I like it
---
Hmm, I am only  a poor FW pod pilot, can't afford anything bigger than a frig :)
---
Really makes me miss my old characters. :,( I wish I could find the person who last played on them to buy the characters back.
---
Ah yes, well I do have corp mates, but they either a) don't want to do the FW PVP (would rather farm LP) or do indy stuff.
---
I guess another option is to change to a FW corp/alliance.. But that kinda detracts from the solo PVP I like to do.
---
What's a good Overview for Wormholing?
---
Skill farms still existed before skill injectors, instead of selling the skill points, they sold the characters. It wasn't as flexible as skill injectors (if someone wanted a super carrier alt, they could only get one if it was on sale), but it was still done.
---
I’ve never had the need to use Excel and I have a pretty balanced lifestyle plus I’m a personal trainer for living.
---
I think you’re speaking from personal experience only, it seems like you need to sort out your life lol
---
what is this folded protein shit
---
The eve uni wiki gives you very good impressions and some decent fits to start with. 
---
When interested in PvP and have a ship in mind, check zkillboard. Look at the ship hull you want, filter to best player with that ship (most kills) and check his losses with said ship and you have a good fit. Do some cross checking to make sure he's not just testing some wonky ass shit.
---
Well, this interface isn't for users but eve players. That's another category.
---
Fucking finally
---
Different ships play different roles. Not everything needs to be overpowered from the start. You're trading spool damage for far better survivability, especially on grid with capitals and a response fleet of subcaps.
---
The problem with what happened there is that the escalation always leads to dropping caps, where the only counter is bringing n+1 caps (or supers, titans). And that's not possible for wormhole roams because of wormhole mass restrictions. If there was something else they could've brought to escalate, they would have.
---
Well, they do not have users but eve players. That's a totally different category for sure.
---
Thought... though its hard to articulate. Basically while null sec can in theory be more dangerous, the effort needed to make the massive organizations that allow it to be as safe/efficient as it is now are worth it.
---
Low sec on the other hand would need a similar level of effort to null sec to be as safe or efficient. But the rewards are not worth it.
---
Meanwhile high sec while needed not much effort to be safe or efficient also gets less reward. But its just stagnate.
---
... basically rather then balancing risk vs reward one should balance reward vs amount of effort needed to make getting that reward routine, boring and standardized.
---
Can't say we don't adapt to the meta eventually.
---
just make it automatically explode whenever it runs out of fuel, and no asset safety because that requires power #nopoors
---
If people can make more easy isk in hs they don't have to join a NS blob alliance just to fund their in game plex, hence the pvp becomes lower scale and more predominant around LS for those who want to pew from hs. And hs credit card warriors pump alot of money into ccp so that's great.   
---
We need more than mind numbing sansha incursions.  
---
All in all there's a lot of problems with the game atm, but adding better pve content is always a plus. we just need to make ns dangerous again an there you go, everyone happy, except the ns blob.
---
i spawned 3km off lol they webbd my geckos tho (fucker lived in 20% hull) so i got out with mwd isthar
---
The double you say? Oh well, I guess many of us don't log in anymore.
---
I have been schooled again and I'm sure I went WAY too far with my first post. It is you that need to accept my apologies, how can I complain about people being xenophobes when I myself lumped an entire region together
---
I have learned a lot from your post, and I also want to thank you for it.
---
lol only one? you casual
---
in the 30 ive had theyve spawnd from 123km to, here recently, a lot closer (about 50) and this was 3km from them.
---
R U Guard ?
---
It looks very much like incursion mechanics.
---
Yea Then nullsec Will die with the server Plex price 6 bil
---
Fucking right, awesome bud!!
---
"the eve we know and meh today." God that really sums up how I feel about eve .
---
Less people will run abysals, prices will go sky high. so they will adjust it again somehow

Lonewolfnight was the ceo at the time. Aralis had stepped down. Aralis took over again after lonewolfnight(jesus what a name) pissed off after the war blew up in hes face.

maybe because even they get bored with blueing/nip up the second biggest group in game  :shrug:

&gt;entertainment
---
I mean, bombers were that for battleships (kinda) but no one drops BS on people. They usually turn up with BS for a fight, dropping heavier stuff several au away.
---
Awesome.
---
I've been playing since 2005 and have a measely 80mil SP to show from it, and that's from a purchased character.  Every time I've quit I've sold my character to stockpile the ISK until next time (even though I was "never" going to come back).
---
Sad to think I could have that many SPs...
---
Go for Tengu!
---
Double nano beam retri
---
When Only going for bots, usually around 3-4 kills. Bot hunting isn't the most adrenaline pumping thing ever
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I find it interesting that logging of works, as i very often struggle to catch botting VNI's even with bookmarks, and a "&lt; 2AU" warpin. With my ceptor i can be there within 3-4s, but thats already too late they hit their warp and are gone. But maybe you're faster with that loggin-safety-warp.
---
The difference, I think, is the fact that you're jumping into system, aligning, and warping to a bookmark manually. You lose a tick or two at least loading grid/session change timer, a tick or two for bookmarks to load depending on how many you got, a tick because human reactions suck, 2 more ticks for align, a tick for warp acceleration. It adds up quick.
---
All that happens instantly, automatically, and simultaneously when you log in.
---
Also I have heard from several WTM fleets there are null sec incursions, so new players would be interested and move out to null to experience that.
---
Various* not obvious. I would be interested to know as well.
---
Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate
---
The day tapi unblueing someone is the day easter and christmas falls on the same day
---
Null sec incursions are done in capital ships and are very exclusive, you'll probably never do them unless you have a really super dedicated group.
---
Where the fuck is the A-TEAM
---
what am i supposed to see here?
---
Ouch!

n1 !
---
I made a maxed out Sacriledge will full high grade ascendency implants...I did 4 Abyssal's, go more bored that running normal missions.

Haven't touched it since, and that head has just been sitting unused for quite some time.  Now I won't feel quilty jumping in a dual rep pvp something something and having fun with that head until it splodes.
---
I'm FREE!!!!

The single plex purchased for 4.2b, as detailed by the daily high outlined in red.
---
Trains are shit. And so is OP's idea. :)
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks Lou!
---
Why should they shoot us as long as there are some panfam members on grid?  &gt;:-)
---
Someone didn't count the zeros before clicking buy. Happened to me when buying a gecko lol.
---
No, that's just too many idiots.
---
if panfam isnt on grid anymore they just burn home and dont shoot tapi... so. yeaha... "third party" :D
---
*Disappointed noises*
---
Oh the irony.
---
You know why EVE succeeded where literally every other sandbox MMORPG has failed? And it succeeded *despite* the fact that most people don't care about the sci-fi setting and don't like the fact their character is a spaceship?
---
Because EVE is the only sandbox MMORPG which lets people opt out of non-consentual PvP. And don't durr-hurr me about how "nowhere is safe in EVE". As long as you know the basics of the game mechanics and stay in highsec, you will never get ganked. Period. If you don't believe me look through your own lossmails and find one where you were flying a properly fit ship, you were not wardecced, you were not a suspect, it was not Burn Jita, etc. and someone *compltely randomly* showed up and blew up your ship in highsec. I dare you.
---
According to [CCP's own data](https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/evenewplayertrajectory.jpg) about eighty percent of EVE players doesn't give a fuck about PvP. They would rather run Damsel in Distress in their Raven for the thousandth time than even warp to zero to a gate leading to lowsec.
---
PvP was never the core of EVE. It's just something that looks good in the news. And something that scares people from trying out the game because "muh open world PvP".
---
No tether on hull timers either plz.
---
Sometimes i sort sell orders according o the closest station and then just mindlessly click the first order as if i still had it sorted by price. Can be a very costly mistake.
---
Stop being retarded mate.
---
You hope it was a sine plex
---
Ending it is also always an option... :)
---
Small price to pay for such value
---
90 day GTC 360 mil the good ole days.
---
I just wanna know what CCPs thinking here is, how is my unfitted reaper costing me 257m?
---
We host our own pathfinder and its way better for massive chains then tripwire imo. We have like 25 users.
---
Assuming CCP made a whole shipline just for 1% of the game population... Right nice spin ;)
---
"shut the f up about Harry Potter"?!?
---
"4,2b"  
---
\-&gt; 4,2m
---
spod is bad hmkay?
---
Not really, sure its better "burst tank" but not overall tank.
---
And yes its better speed, but it also has less range of damage, meaning it has to be closer to even do anything, putting it even more in harmsway.
---
New Server without Caps... That should fix alot.
---
But yeaha -&gt; no!
---
Use frentix :)
---
Nice, thx for the info
---
Aralis and CEO of ID didn't get along. Aralis asked for his T2 BPO's that were being used by the corp back. ID CEO said no, created more shares than Aralis had in ID and kicked him.

This was mentioned in the other thread where the triglaivian invasions was discussed
---
However, Hold out a little longer, This new trig invasion is a new type of incursion, And everything about it is missing two key things, So far on SISI they have only spawned in HS, And they all lack the fleet payout system.
---
It would appear we have a form of solo / small group incursion sites on our hands to contribute towards the goal of repelling the invasion force.
---
Thats the kind of sites and content that most people can get involved in.
---
You know how POS reinforcement timers started counting down the moment shields hit 30 or whatever?
---
It's like that, except it's when low power structure hits hull and the timer is always 48 hours
---
We had a 100 person host but every single time there was an update we needed to contact them and needed to use tripwire until we heard from them (over a month the last time)
---
I suppose if the host is in your corp or group and active then it would be ok.
---
kind of sucked for us as an NPSI wormhole  because growth was severely limited.
---
I doubt it was a single plex; it looks like a buy order, and i cant imagine someone creating a buy order for 1 PLEX. I'm wondering what the total damage to his wallet was ;) Anyway it's a great day for the seller
---
What the fuck really?  That blows my mind.  After 16 years?  That's crazy
---
düd
---
You can join FW NPC corp directly and fly solo.
---
Pretty important rule.
---
Oh jees... that sounds plausible and horrifying for the buyer...
---
It's almost like we fit ships differently depending on their bonuses and slot layouts. 
---
The "fairest" analysis is the combination we'd see on live. 
---
In a whaling configuration, Drekavacs often use 3 rad sinks, Ikitursa in the same config would use 2. 
---
In a fleet setting, you would see both drop by 1 sink.
---
 Either way the additional low and rig slot, combined with the resist bonus on the drekavac, make it fit about one more rad sink, regardless of setting.
---
Looks more like Nefantar to me \^\^
---
**Eve Online**
---
- where even the Devs want to scam you out of every singe isk you got.
---
I thought ships had to be in warp, not starting warp, to nullify the effects of a bubble being placed
---
This
---
Plus all MMOs thrive off of PVE player bases. WoW and GW2 are perfect examples and both have pvp.
---
If people want EVE to thrive, they need to bring in more casuals and sell pets in the NEX store (jk on the pets).
---
As stated above
---
Hey man it's a nice idea every time it gets posted but I doubt anyone that krabs for a long amount of time will enjoy the prospect of doing more work to get isk.
---
Yeh, no thanks. This is a giant fuck you to everyone whos built up skills and assets over the years. 
---
Resetting Nullsec? Now that could be interesting
---
I’ve got 3 chars over 12 years in Eve, all over 180M SP, not sure how I’d feel about starting over.
---
Indicating some party is adamant in a hostile attitude towards you does in no way violate or negate being neutral as I see it. Being set red does not imply that Signal Cartel would aggress (unless aggressed and yes, we do not roll over and give up, we will end a fight if we have to in our favor if at all possible but at the same time will do whatever we must/can to avoid the conflict to begin with).
---
Smile on my face with each new vid &lt;3
---
Even if they did, nobody would ever see it because nobody would ever do them.
---
Well, maybe they don't need that much isk and jumping in tians right away and economy need to be healthier?idk.  
---
Saying that as someone who pays for his ships with afk VNIs, btw. :)
---
It's not dumb.  Seems like a sensible idea to me.
---
Does it have injectors in the cargo hold?
---
Will never work
---
EVE is no Theme-Park
---
Add another one where there is payouts if you are below 1 million sp.
---
This will help the newbros get their foot in the game till they can understand the market and salvage
---
that's sad to see happen
---
If a ship for example is in a site. And you put up the bubble in front of the citadel, in line with from where he's coming and where he will land, and he then starts his warp, then yes, you will catch him.
---
If he started his warp, even just 0,1s ... and you then put up a bubble, he will land, where he's intending to warp to.
---
Tbh i am not 100% certain in terms of keeping him from warping. I'd say if he starts warping and you put up a bubble that he's basically inside, you are stopping his warping mechanism, although i had some situations where i started my warp, bubble came up and i still managed to get out, even though i was inside, but probably close on the edge ... but in your case, you probably never get a bot by warping to a citadel and bubbling there, as they will have started their warp by that time.
---
&gt; This test guy just tries to scare you away.
---
Lemme guess, F1ip?
---
nope, just a reaper. doesnt even have the civilian stuff or the trit.
---
I don't null very much, so forgive the dumb question: do you actually need to bling out a Marauder that much to solo rat in Null?  31bil to solo rat seems fucking stupid as fuck to me if you aren't in a wormhole.....
---
Indeed!
---
&gt; Fist, those of you who VNI rat and Netflix all day long or bot, please look away. Apparently this mechanics is not broken for you and you think this is great PvE gameplay.
---
First, i had to downvote you ofc. 
---
Good job me, now back to VNI and chill.
---
Well done. Fitting one of these and taking it for a spin might convince me to log in!
---
To clarify you mean by starting warp that the "warp drive active" phase is muttered correct?
---
I thought u meant the bot or player has clicked the warp to fortizar or w.e...
---
My Avatar is mostly a jump freighter at this point, yes.
---
Old news friend
---
yes helo ccp
---
u/ccp_falcon pls yeet these people out the game

You obviously never tried snortin a line of spod 10AU long.

I think the problem with the garmur not getting any content is that it's a garmur

It aint much, but it's honest work.

Tengu for PVE  
---
Proteus for meme and to prove to reddit it's still a magnificent ship

loki for everything and the rest  
---
Legion if you are an esclavagiste
---
all these "for the health of the game" posts are dumb
---
for game balance a developer should always assume that
---
1) players will act in their own self interests
---
2) players will have a general good understanding of game mechanics
---
it's never the players' fault for playing optimally, don't hate the player hate the game
---
it's amazing how many people are missing the potential of this ship. right after the haw/fax/rorq/fighter nerfs, ccp introduces a HAC with all the usual sig bonuses and ADCU, plus fitting room for neuts, 1400+ dps, and a tracking bonus. i wonder what it could possibly be good for?
---
I like the fact that you show some of the chase involved in setting up the engagements - I find that to be one of the more challenging aspects of setting up a fight in null. Set it up, split up the bob in such a way that you land a kill &amp; hopefully maybe even moonwalk out just as the blob lands.
---
Aborted Jesus Day?
---
Dang, wish I was even 10% this good
---
hahahha try 2B
---
Hi CEO!
---
as soon as they *click warp* its too late to bubble up
---
That's 11.4 years.
---
Are you Naz's bastard?
---
No i basically mean the "you hit the warp button". Even if it takes him additional 30s to finally get into warp, the moment he started the warping-process so to say on grid, that's what matters.
---
Well dropping a couple of caps with a fax on a battleship fleet is much more effective (you need fewer people as well), because there's not a lot of risk of losing ships. Faxes will easily outrep the battleship fleet and dreads with haws will obliterate the battleships off the field. The only option for the battleship fleet is to regroup and drop n+1 caps/supers, which isn't always possible (ex: wormhole roam). If there was another counter-play for caps, you'd see another kind of escalation:
---
battleships to caps to anti-caps smaller ships to battlecruisers (I'm assuming the smaller ships are roughly cruiser sized) and back to battleships (or caps). You could have strategy and baits to drop counters and counter-counters. It would be a much more dynamic playstyle than n+1 caps all the damn time, once you get passed sub-cap fleets.
---
Yeah exactly. It needs split second decisions. You know this as good as I do. That's why null roaming is so fun!
---
Coming back to trig stuff sucked...
---
Very true
---
Maybe you've just had bad luck with getting blobbed?
---
Been back in-game for couple of months, flown solo only in minnie/amarr fw, though I'm in NPC corp so more targets available &amp; I've gotten loads of solo action.
---
Prob about 500 kills and maybe 250-300 losses - most of those losses though have not been due to getting blobbed but a combination of:
---
\-me making mistakes while I get some pvp rust off 
---
\-me engaging ships I know I should't just on the off chance that I might win and it will give me a shinny killmail (i.e. atron vs succubus/comet/dramiel) - sometimes it's worked.
---
\-me bored and feeding into a 2-3 man gang just to land a kill
---
But getting blobbed has not happened too often. Maybe chance FW area - come Minnie/Amarr area. It's alive and kicking for solo fights - though small ships mostly, maybe cruisers at times.
---
Just going off my own experience.  Was in a 300 man alliance and had more moons than we could mine, including a couple 64s and a few 32.  A lot went idle wasted.  A couple guys had their own chain set up to make stuff with lots of alts and made good isk.  Sounds like you had a different experience.
---
The version presented from  imperium side is, that a former PL member, penifsmash, bought darkshines molok from one of shines former corp mates, he had sold it to prior.     
---
After that the fax nerfes as well as HAW gun nerfes became public and penif presumably felt cheated (?) by insider trading and told the CSM member he felt most approachable, KillahBee of NC., about it.       
---
CSM members apparently are obligated to forward such concerns to CCP, which he did.      
---
So far so good. 
---
Why CCP came around and hamfisted in response i unclear, because neither directly involved wants to give more specifics, but apparently CCP jumped on nothing.
---
Since everyone affected publicly accepted CCPs apology i personally would consider that chapter closed.       
---
However the bigger community is concerned how often such overreactions from CCP already occured amd howbmany might follow. No one wants to be baned innocent.
---

---
Won't this only effect high sec? So the isk faucet us still there in null in terms of doing t5's.
---
Of course you could argue that some places in null are technically more dangerous than high sec
---
Rectal snorting as well
---
Oh sorry I should have stipulated we have a mutual defense agreement so go ahead attack either one of us and try to take the space. Until then we roam TEST and Brave space they roam ours, it keeps us all on our toes.

The tweet linked in the comment has a download, too. I don't really use QR codes from not-mobile devices so that's more convenient. Your direct link is even more convenient.

---
Oh boy, I can't wait for you to come crying when your space gets invaded and you get jackshit.
---
I would assume that with the addition of more trig ships the new trig invasions are going to be a source for trig mats as well
---
The whole Triglavian ship line is a straight up nerf to capitals in my opinion.
---
300 characters isn't a "large alliance". TEST is at 16.5k, Horde is 16k and Goons are 40k.
---
Yeah, Pyfa told me it was b/c I only have Lvl 4 in the guns. If I bump that to Lvl 5, then the T2 gun pulls slightly ahead but not by much.
---
I guess I just never realized Faction guns were that much "better" than T2s, b/c I knew they couldn't use T2 ammo before so I never bothered looking at their stats otherwise. I figured the T2 spec skill would make them more effective in the long run. I didn't realize it was the really long run, since even Lvl 4 is less effective.
---
Thats why I said in my post above, that it was easy for small groups to do it....
---
Nullsec being too safe is a huge problem. I used to be a high sec risk averse carebear.  Two things changed that made me move to null. 1 was the operations by code. I basically lost more than I mined in high sec. That made me switch to burner missions. Then the super proliferation became real and i had friends in goons who were sitting safe mining literally billions a day with no semblance of risk. The choice was obvious.
---
I feel like bot hunting is almost becoming a game mechanic, it's like going after player created rats.
---
My main concern is two-fold have more people in the game and to suggest new content creators, or tweak already existing code to make for more content  
---
Ideas for additional content:
---
more C5/C6 to Null worm holes (potential to allow bigger WH entities to find suitable content) Maybe medium size. Could be Cap size. Give me your pros and cons.
---
Delay Local and Intel channels writing to log files by 10 minutes (this makes intel programs and bots uneffective)
---
Make Local either regional or constellation based (Local becomes less of an intel tool)
---
Modify the mass of the Leshak to fit more with other BS
---
rebalance risk/reward/time of C3 and c4 sites as well as Capital Escalations in C5 systems.
---
Give me your pros and cons for the ideas.
---
Imperial Mango Please Ignore
---
Retard alert
---
The CVA he created died when he ragequit for literally the entirety of Dominion sov existing up until 2 years post Aegis. As much credit as I give him to say he created Providence, I think I do have to put that credit more on Equinox than him.
---
The constant complaining about botting is just the next wave of hunters who realize how horrible the return of investment of their gameplay is. 
---
The idea is that PvP drives this game and it should be easy and accessible to do the right thing. 
---
Where they all miss the spot is how rampant botting actually is. Players confuse players they don’t understand with bots constantly. So the less you know about how other people play, the more you will see bots everywhere.
---
what's really dumb here, is you
---
Looking at your toon, your doing very well considering how new it is.
---
A few tips, i strongly recommend only using blaters if you are able to use the tech 2 variety because of the t2 ammo called null, which gives a very nice range but way more damage than its equivalents.  Rails you can manage without tech 2 since your new.
---
Also just because you cant fly a tech 2 variety of a module dosent mean you are stuck with the base tech 1 version, most modules have things called 'meta varieties' which are modules that you can already use if you can use the tech 1 base. These modules are in between the t1 and t2 variations and they usually dont cost that much more. You might want to swap your magnetic field stabilizer I to a vortex compact magnetic field stabilizer.  You have other modules that you use t1 base so right click show info on a module, and go to the variations tab, the meta modules are the ones inbetween the t1 and t2 in the list.
---
Do they realize most people making bank are speedrunning lower tiers in frigates for 3x the loot and no risk?  No?  Carry on, CCReeeeee
---
yes, they act in their own self interest, why would they care about benefiting people other than themselves?
---
The vast majority of players or people act in self interest, and can't and shouldn't be relied on to act out of it in order to make something work.
---
Damn thats a decent amout of ISK...
---
No branch isn’t supers like delve, it’s mostly vni bots
---
Is there an Android app better than the basic official eve portal so I can look at more info. It seems like a general thing that many people have a problem with the portal.
---
Why wouldn't you?
---
Like, if you're not wardecced, there's literally no difference between doing them in Jita and doing them in Solitude, except Jita gives you a way, way easier method of getting more ammo/drones/filaments.
---
You have my vote!  I believe that everyone has a right to be on the csm, even if your just a humble cyno alt.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2113421673/
---
The thing you've got to remember is how many actual people live in Delve. GSF is a 40k man alliance that is capable of consistently filling 3-4 entire fleets before anyone logs in a single capital alt. Even counting alts and afks, there's got to be at least a couple thousand people who log in once or twice a week to achieve that figure. Sure most of them will be mining, but even a small portion of a very big number is still a big number.
---
Meanwhile look at Outer Passage at a quarter of that figure. Outer Passage is entirely renter space. There aren't massive alliances, they aren't putting hundreds of capitals in a fleet let alone supercaps, and if you fly through there its absolutely dead. There's hardly anyone in local.
---
The fact there's so few people combined with the MER is the best evidence-based argument you could possibly make for the scale of botting going on. It's the rabbit and the hare, a super piloted by a person can do 250m/hr for 3 hrs for 750m/day quite comfortably. Meanwhile a shitty VNI alt making 80m/hr 23hrs/day is doing 1.84B/day.
---
The VNIs are cheap and won't really get hunted/die very often, so consistency wins out every time.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Skill farms existed sure, but it was a very small and niche market. A lot less people did it hens my point, demand for plex wasn't as high. You couldn't train just any skill and dump it on the market, you had to choose what pilot you wanted to train and plan skills accordingly, you had to go on the forums which and try sell it, sometimes there was no demand for that particular pilot and he would just sit there ect. A lot of hassle! Now you can have a zombie alt train any skill that you're remapped for and dump shit on the market ones every so often!  Simple! And with alphas you can have almost infinite amount of alts trained up to extra limit at zone investment.  Which is why more and more people do it, putting a strain on plex supply. I'm not saying it's sole contributer, but it's definitely one of the more noticeable ones
---
I used to feel that way about WoW, then I saw Eve on my potato laptop. New computer feels great... moving from WoW to Eve means I get to play my way, try new things every time I turn around and get a view doing it. Was a good move for my happiness gaming
---
You're a cunt.
---
Sounds like a lot of effort, for little gain.
---
you are trying to enforce lore wise or whatever a mechanic that never existed, if you want to talk about mechanics that shouldnt exist lets talk about how all the ships merge into one when they anchor or when capacitor transmitter defy physics laws or that you couldnt convert npc stations with the way you converted player stations etc, dont tie everything to lore cause you will be dissapointed. I am saying again that if asset safety wasnt a thing then they  SHOULD NOT have removed stations, its that simple. You want citadel destruction without asset safety? ok, bring back stations then.
---
Lol
---
What's really *really* dumb here, is globby is absolutely correct.
---
Sorry I thought you were saying it didn't work based on "a lot going wasted". What alliance are we talking about? I bet you were part of a major coalition if it was working for you.
---
Who?
---
My pvp and indy toon came at the same time. I happen to like the name of the indy toon better, so that is what I used to sign into discord.
---
My pvp toon can be seen here : [https://zkillboard.com/character/2113207804/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113207804/)
---
Yup, mite just be that's what  would happen realistically. But for game sake it's instinct eg projectile guns being hit scan.
---
who and who? and also who?! ?
---
Wrong. As soon as they are aligned and begin the warping.
---
Yup, and the 100mn vnis align really fuckin slow. I've still seen botters using them. 2 and 2 makes dead vnis.
---
Joecuster, Where do you and I disagree on points? I would love to hear your opinion.
---
Evictus. They're called Evictus. 
---
Surely you know the name of the Alliance you were in until yesterday?
---
Minmatar is the Pacific Northwest. It rains a lot here. Shit gets rusty.
---
Out of interest, do you prefer the AC / tankier one or the arty kiter?
---
Jita is gank central, suspect timer or not.
---
Your lack of understanding of what the CSM is and it's role. It's just a focus group, your policies mean nothing you're just there to provide feedback from your group/other players on ideas CCP has which they generally dont give a shit about anyway
---
So that Fenrir didn't die then?
---
Hey Jin you still play btw? Any plans on coming back to Provi
---
Same. I'm at 110 mil and keep subbed just because.
---
You can literally click the wormhole and see what type it is. The only time that's an issue is with K162 wormholes and it's not difficult to just go through and check.
---
it's evictus lol
---
You are right, in Delve there are lots of charakters, who live there, but still you said it not all of them are ratting and then defently not in VNIs or do they?!
---
About Branch, i lived there myself and still have buddies up there to know in what they are.
---
Funny is you say outer passage is dead but still you say on the other had, that they bot 24/7 there, what now dead or botting-vnis everywhere?!
---
And defining botting by the price you have to invest in a ship is funny too...
---
They should actually be called Fail Cascade, cause that's probably happening soon without 90% of their fleet strength
---
This one.
---
This would be an epic way for Eve to end, when you think about it.  Instead of just shutting the servers down, have an invasion that the current player base can't repel, and the only way to save New Eden would be for player counts to return to near their peak levels.  If the players win, Eve lives on, otherwise everything burns and its lights out.
---
Both are good. AC is a beast brawler because of good range/very high dps/crazy EM resists . Arty wolf has very high speed, good alpha damage (good against active tanked ships) but low overall dps compared to something like the retribution. You could say the lower dps isn't a huge problem because the wolf has selectable damage type. The main reason I don't fly the wolf with arties is because its very skill intensive to fit it with 280mm arties . Im currently training rig skills to 4 but i'll still need a 2% pg implant to fly it (although I have weapon upgrades V and advanced weapon upgrades IV).
---
Sure drive them away and you have your system for your epic krabbing gameplay again, should be reward enough.
---
I don´t min chinese comming to tranquility. But if the Chinese see this post! REMEMBER!!!! What happend on your own server!!! DON´T make our server the same!!! DON´T destroy our game!!! Live ny this, we cool
---
 我不認為中國人會變得安寧。但如果中國人看到這篇帖子！記得！！！！在你自己的服務器上發生了什麼！不要讓我們的服務器一樣！不要破壞我們的遊戲！住這個，我們很酷
---
"C'mon man, but my tics"
---
OK let me get this straight
---
You chased a Naga to a fort grid in BWF with not only 110 in local, but like 8 other dudes on grid? Then you stay and kill a second, then you stay and go for a phantasm?
---
Not a fuck was given that day, I can tell you
---
Great video, wish more people had your spirit
---
you are very inexperienced, Im not confident that you will be able to provide the correct response on CCPs ideas.
---
Again I catch you openly lying. Stop it, just stop it why do you hate what you really are...?
---
Can you share any interceptor fits? Do you try to outrun drones?
---
If you have not lived there what makes you the expert...is it just arrogance.
---
Thank you for paying to keep the game alive.
---
Check your language. We members of the church should not talk like this.
---
That's why it's my craziest roam! It was a very special situation because I saw about 150 people leaving bwf about 10 mins earlier (as you can see on the Damavik clip). Then all the memories of dying to gatecampers on this gate came back to me and I said fuck it, I'm going for it. Not gonna lie it went way better than expected hahah.
---
Fair, I suppose 3 or 4 nados could trivially pop even the most blingy abyssal cruiser at a huge profit.
---
Same with you buddy. When are you and I finally going to go out for lunch. We need resolution.
---
If PVP interests you and your corp does not match your interests - just change corps man - plenty of great corps out there. Being surrounded by like minded individuals will only improve your pvp skill as you learn from them.
---
bots aren't the issue, local is
---
How do you mine salt with a shot? I mean you have told me you're from Salt Lake so I would assume you know how it is actually mined.
---
bots are a symptom of bad gameplay (ie pve that requires 8 clicks an hour, local being the end-all-be-all intelligence tool, etc)
---
The problem is that highsec carebears don't really grow the game.  Nobody hears of some idiot running missions and says "cool, lets try EVE!".  Content creators and null wars do that; CCReee's idiotic changes have made null wars all but nonexistent, and their complete apathy towards the community is causing more and more content creators to quit.  Making highsec better for the krabs isn't going to stop the hemorrhaging of actual paying players.
---
Why do you play so much when you should be working for the redemption of the souls in Central Russia.
---
Before kills like these there are many losses from which many lessons have been learnt.
---
What do you think is stopping you from getting better?
---
I've been living in malpais now 2 years or so. Ive seen 3 VNI bot rings in that time, 2 of which were pointed out to me as they wanted more people to start filing reports on them. The longest "life" of one of the bot corps was around 2-3 months before they got the hammer down by CCP. And in the last 6-8 months i haven't seen any since Lady S. cleaned house of them all. 
---
VNI botting is the one of the serious problems with the economy, its been pointed out that they generally don't Omega them either too, so its really profitable with almost no risk, and incredibly easy to "stand up" a new VNI farm once you get caught.
---
Side note:
---
I really wish BoT would change their alliance name.
---
Non existant nullsec wars? Which game are you playing?
---
PH and TEST just ended their highsec fights. Snuff and INIT are fighting NC. 
---
FIRE and WinterCo are at war.
---
Imperium is fighting against NC&amp;Co renters.
---
In Pure Blind are several smaller entities brawling every other day
---
There is war all over the galaxy...
---
You’re doing god’s work!
---
So /u/cactusjack48 do you know everything? Because at this point I am starting to believe that you are an encyclopedia of leet.
---
So even having said this do you feel any guilt to abusing your RL responsibilities?
---
Again you are the EVE Encyclopedia. How do you do it spanky?
---
So I just cycle through tons of Alphas to make my ISK.  Once they hit 1 mill, biomass, start again.
---
Wow!!! I totally took this out of context and now have a totally new perspective of you?
---
His ideas are stupid, but just so you know, you can't tether with an aggression timer.
---
Hard to tell if it is looping or not is what I was getting at.
---
However you want to make pennies... seems like a big pain to me.
---
right click on any module - go to show info - go to the variations tab - in there you will find all versions of that particular module - you want the named versions i.e. 150mm scout railgun etc.
---
They will be better than the T1 you seem to often have fitted.
---
The above is true for pretty much every module and most of these named mods won't break the bank either - some will be super cheap.
---
1)I doubt you know what "proverbial" means.
---
2)This will do absolutely nothing to shake up sov, since you can just wait it out or kick the trigs out yourself. Looks like basically reskinned incursions, so meh whatever.
---
I don't remember where exactly, but I think on the right-hand side of the mission brief (specifically, the window you see before you click "Accept") is an icon representing the faction you'll be fighting, around halfway down the write-up.  It's not perfect (i.e. it misses mercs/drones), but it's something.
---
Also join in-game channel:  Bringing Solo Back
---
That's the place for solo pvp epeen measuring + great advice etc.
---
Im surprised not more people bot considering how trash eve pve is
---
So when are you coming back to SLC so we can go to lunch?
---
That will just make the strongest blocks even stronger and depopulate nullsec.  Sounds good in theory.
---
No.
---
What type of sandwiches do you like?
---
And like that, Nullsec is very very fucked. Nothing can happens
---
4 orca 40 hulks 2 freighters and a smattering of command ships then start hunting high sec moon belts, bam instant salt mining without a shot fired
---
I highly disagree do you like cinnamon toast crunch?
---
So a basically a temporary punitive mechanic where RNG decides who gets fucked. Neat, CCP should hire you.
---
Do you love the Damavik because it seems like a word from Central Russia?
---
Great reply, thanks man - I’ve been wanting to get into null roaming again...so just bought one of each :)
---
The words of the tools is a period and a short stomp. Do they have grass in central russia?
---
I am such a fanboy of you. I love you so much? Can we go out for sandwiches.?
---
 It ain't much, but it's honest work [2]
---
Is this a topic that you absolutely love because words man.
---
Army of Mangoons Please Ignore
---
Not gonna work.
---
I'd celebrate that holiday
---
So I once heard that FW was broken is that true.
---
That's an awfully semantic thing to make an effort of pointing out. Not to mention, we don't know the extent of the kinds of affects these invasions will have, best just to wait for more info to come out this weekend.
---
Exactly what [Lou\_Mir](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lou_Mir) said. It only takes practice and not giving up (even after that my killboard is pretty bad lol).
---
This will be new for me then.  I've never used a trig module or flown a trig ship or been in an abyssal site, or generally given a flying fork about this content.   Am I now going to be forced to engage with it?  I enjoy incursions with the squad when they spawn nearby.
---
Go for it - it is worth it yes.
---
Yep. Someone posted a gecko for 1b. Thought it was 1m lol
---
Bounce safes baby
---
Well as far as i know they are free to shoot us.. If they dont like to v0v :)
---
I like that.
---
So F-OFF has F'ed off and thinks it can Evict Evictus?
---
I don't know, that story really doesn't add up. One guy feels salty that his new big toy gets nerfed, just like thousands of other similar big toys, takes it to the csm, and CCP reacts by assuming that the alliance leader of the guy who sold penif the ship was secretly leaking info that led to the sale? I don't know what's worse, CCP's stupid moves, penif's self-important attitude, or the fact that all this happened and will stain CCP and EVE for a while? All the more reason to not have a moderation system like the one proposed.
---
People forget that maximum skill level in eve is V for each skill.  If you want to do frigate PvP, a focused 1 year old player will be as good as a 10 year old one - in game skill wise.  However a competent older player should win because of actual experience in pvp.  Not sure what is the point of resetting server.  At any case do we plan to reset server every year?
---
having fun? in eve online?? IMPOSSIBLE.
---
GO TO GULAG RIGHT NOW
---
&gt; I'm complaining about CCP's inability to stay consistent. 
---
&gt; I am disappointed 
---
Seems pretty consistent to me!
---
Remember to turn auto-reload off as well, and GLHF! 🙏
---
Sounds like Communist propaganda, but ok.
---
Eve =/= Rust
---
Maybe just a stupid suggestion. But have you tried burning away in de direction your ship is pointed at that moment. Instead turning around. 
---
Just sounds like you're bad at eve.
---
Please tell a rookie what this means? repair paste in SAAR?
---
The only retard here is you, cunt. Fuck off back to your 3 rorqs and 12 AFK VNIs
---
You know what we need? We need to make the already tedious grind for is even more tedious.
---
I'm sure making the game less fun will attract more players.
---
Lets be honest, its 90% epeen measuring.
---
I stated in my post that I understand that CSM is an adviser and not a developer. I was asked by several people to give some ideas and that is what I did. My ideas also show that I am looking into all aspects of the community and not just one narrow point.
---
Cry more plz. CCP use's your tears to run the machine that makes new trig ships.
---
When the megacoalition will have killed nullsec, they will be «but no one want to fight our 2k titan fleet? Are they running away from the server, their are just cowards.
---
People just want easy pve and don't see that the bigger they become lower is the interest to fight them.
---
If you add that CCP keep the subscrition as high as before ... CCP don't seem to realize that even if eve is unique, but the cost ingame or irl is way to high compare to what the rest of the world of video game can offer.
---
Don't get me wrong the game will not die soon but it becomes and less attractive and alive
---
EVE is unique in that you have people with literally 2 decades of experience, skill points, and ISK banks popping new players and treating it like a feature. Yeah, EVE is supposed to be challenging and risky, but for a player who isn't hardcore enough to multibox, learn the entire meta, grind endlessly to build a bank account the experience is nothing but frustration.
---
People really aught to pick on someone their own size. You can tell them "just join a noob corp" that gives them everything they need and tells them everything about how they are supposed to play the game and all you've accomplished is take away 2 decades of content from them - learning how to play, character and asset progression, etc - and replaced it with a mediocre at best space submarine simulator. They won't feel any connection to what's happening because they didn't earn it.
---
It's one Variant of armor repaired that incant very good by itself but can use nanite repair paste to triple it's repair amount and push it above even the tech 2 repairer
---
Don't add features to something broken.
---
Why the fuck do you use a period. 12.971 billion? No, its fucking 12.971 TRILLION you fucking MONG
---
The Spire - 495 billion
---
Oasa - 1.428 Trillion
---
Cobalt Edge - 2.030 Trillion
---
Malpais - 1.216 Trillion
---
Outer Passage - 2.486 Trillion
---
Perrigen Falls - 1.768 Trillion
---
Cache - 641 billion
---
Insmother - 2.907 Trillion
---
Together: 12.971 Trillion
---
When you put it as TRILLION, like you fucking should, you can see that these bot regions are making more than the most densly packed part of space, Delve.
---
These VNI botters are making more than some of the most active PVE'ers in the game.
---
learn to fucking show data
---
I still play yeah, did some solo in FW a few days ago and got a few frags with a Tormentor.
---
No desire to return to Provibloc, as much as I had fun during my time there. As I said in my retirement, leadership and I had different ways forward for Provi and I felt it was best to step aside and let them carry on with their vision. Returning would not change that situation.
---
1) I heard from a month or so ago that CCP admitted they messed up with so many plex sales last year. This year was going to be less.
---
2) Rumor has it people are hanging onto purchased plex waiting for the market to peak.... how much plex is out there, who knows besides CCP. Again that is just a rumor/theory.
---
Jack, you are right.
---
I offer you this one point of reflection, though: I stopped believing the CCP's big PVE invasions are about keeping old players retained.
---
IMHO, the big sexy space wars with laser beams, massive explosions, and screeching FCs are the most eye-catching advertisements about EVE Online to the rest of the world.
---
Maybe a little world wrecking can spur on larger and bigger PvP wars in the current sov stagnation.
---
I don't, why a game should be catered towards people NOT playing it ?
---
If they soften the structure the root problem still persists. If the defender sets it for 1800 Wednesday most Americans will be at work for final timer. Setting your timer to exit when it is inconvenient to bash is the best defense, and persists past powering your structure.
---
I'd honestly prefer 3 timers where the defending can't pick the time of day if in low power

My favorite fuck up I do far too often is flying a tristan and getting half way through a fight wondering what kind of amazing tank the other guy has because i'm doing hardly any damage at all... and then noticing I forgot to launch my drones.

---
That was in messages for me from Svarog Clade
---
I hate EVE players.
---
NERF MULTIBOXING! = you aren’t gonna get votes.
---
Way way way too many people dedicated a significant amount of time and isk into establishing multiboxing accounts. Also this (*re: multiboxing*) keeps CCP revenue stream flowing, allowing them to pay developers to make other necessary changes.
---
Thinks it can Evictus*
---
They had so many plex sales to inflate their income so they would look like a good investment to the Koreans
---
Join us
---
A lot of people that haven't stopped yet will, goonies and other well organized pve players will put their system in place and it will just change the capital population for some time
---
Thinks it can Evict us.
---
That was kinda the point...
---
Perhaps, I'm not holding my breath though. If anything, the fact that we're waiting on NPCs to shake up sov is just miserable.
---
on of your ~~meatshield~~ ~~valued allied~~ pet corps left for the enemy
---
Its an invasion. They should shoot and kill everything they can while there. POS, poco and upwell structures. NPC stations too, if they could be shot.....
---
Ah the classic anti-capital tracking bonus
---
80m/hour with a VNI? You gotta teach me as I struggle to get 60m/hour consistently.
---
If Goonswarm doesn't own a majority of the sov map, then there is probability that a lot more regions other than Delve would be attacked first by the Triglavians.
---
i don't know if i should laugh or cry by your posts, but i have  learned to bear with the stupid. 
---
i just used the numbers from ccp, and there stands 12971 billion, which means 12,971 trillion so nearly 13 trillion, so to correct you, even if i think it's sensless, i like to help the helpless:
---
The Spire - 0,4 Trillion
---
Oasa - 1,4 Trillion
---
Cobalt Edge - 2,0 Trillion
---
Malpais - 1,2 Trillion
---
Outer Passage - 2,4 Trillion
---
Perrigen Falls - 1,7 Trillion
---
Cache - 0,6 Trillion
---
Insmother - 2,9 Trillion
---
Together: 12,9 Trillion
---
You’re so American it’s painful
---
Nobody uses 3 heat sink Dreks, every relevant group runs 2.
---
my point was the following: 
---
[F-OFF] who ?? 
---
Invictus ... so you mean Evictus 
---
WinterCO ... well thats just asking to get stomped by legacy, no wonder the split isn't amicable.
---
You know what? Tedious is not what I am proposing.
---
&gt;It's one Variant of armor repaired that incant very good by itself but can use nanite repair paste to triple it's repair amount and push it above even the tech 2 repairer
---
Small Ancillary Armour Repairer. It can be loaded with paste to greatly increase its repping amount.  
---
Hope this helps.
---
You and he are right. The mining buff is by design. CCP bug report confirmed it.
---
95% at least.
---
At least not from the thousands of alts..
---
Its Tortoise and the Hare. Based on this 'intentional?' error all your following points are invalid
---
I mean that’s how I look at it, if I’m enjoying a game I honestly don’t mind spending money on it, for that exact reason :)
---
what if we can't read triangle
---
I'm thinking of an other thing.
---
It's a bit hard, and can be like the cherry at the top, but a script (or something like that) that run in the background for items we are trading on, that can spot "bot behaviors", to avoid competing against unfair bots.
---
Can you do the overview hack to have all the ship names shown on grid and keep the camera a little zoomed out? Get a bigger picture of what's happening on grid
---
Faction Titans ehm ehm ....

I cringed at this too.

Failed geometry, so I can't join

"Hey guys, those PLEX sales boosted our revenues and grew profits for the company." "Then let's stop doing that?"

I was mainly speaking on K162. I heavily rely on the whole info for unknown, dangerous, or deadly infos

No guns.

---
- 2x T2 Disrupt (i did abyssal one for fun ... 2km more range)
---
- 1x Republic Fleet Medium Shield Extender
---
I do outran the drones super easy. Since it's fade, they use Wasp's, they never catch me. And since they are bots, they don't have anything else with them.
---
Had to mute due to bogan squealing.
---
Evictus WinterCO? Wtf is that? Evictus. is Legacy.
---
What if I told you they posted about it like a day ago?
---
Wait, an admission of Code success! Awesome!
---
Branch is big botting lands.
---
But Supreme Leader, we thought we were *already* in the gulag just by playing EVE.
---
A Kubrick grade shtposting! Hats off!
---
Checks out
---
He's off with his numbers but you get the point, someone making 50m/hr for double digit hours a day on double digit characters is vastly outpacing the output of a single dude running his super for an hour or two.
---
There is 15% PLEX and DLC discount on GMG for registered accounts
---
DùD
---
&gt; Nr. 2 Branch with 6.265 billion, also the region of the big vni-farms? - Not really, mostly supers like delve
---
Reading this I doubt you ever been to Branch lately. Especially the chinese groups utilize the VNI-Bots heavily as they need not much investment and SP and there are quite a few people who surely finance their life with that run multiboxes semi-afk the whole week which over RMT can give you an above average income.
---
Where do you stand on unattended games play, I of course am speaking about cloaky camping.
---
I'm partial to the loki for the web module and the legion cause lasers.  I'm glad to see people being helpful in this thread though.  Six years ago the responses would have been a lot of "If you have to ask you aren't ready to fly one".
---
A lot better than the guy who maxed out skills in a few days after spending over $30k in real life.
---
No, go away.
---
People overstate VNI ticks a ton. I've ratted in multiple regions with perfect skills. Mostly afk. But even when min-maxing drones etc you usually get 55-60m without any faction spawns.
---
Average is probably 55 if done afk. Definitely not 80
---
I mean, why? War mechanics are so fucking boring now and days, might as well just avoid it all together. (I don't really like this outcome, I want conflicts, but not in this god forsaken hell scape of sov mechanics)
---
&gt; Which to some is essential.
---
This is a video game dude. Nothing about eve online is “essential” to anybody’s life except Himler. 
---
Eve players are a bunch of drama queens who wouldn’t care half as much to their own countries economic status compared to internet pixels.
---
/rant
---
Count the zeroes. Someone misclicked and bought a plex for 4 bil.
---
I use Z-S overview.   You can google that name or join the channel in game for the download.  I have been using it for a long time and i might just be totally used to it to try something new- but to me, it serves all my Dscan/OV needs.
---
I’m by no means a great pilot, but I can proudly say that I am decent for the amount of time I’ve played and I’m only getting better.
---
So here’s a little advice or at least something to keep on mind. 
---
I’ve been playing for about 4 months, I spent most of that time in my Corp’s standing fleet and I was attending as many fleets as possibly, that helped me understand many game mechanics, and most importantly I started to understand ships, their weaknesses and their strengths, it takes a while but from my personal experience the standing fleet is the best place, as you can discuss things, people give advice and you have time to understand things and also you have the chance to make more mistakes, without getting blapped.
---
I started off with cruisers, again this is just personal advice, with bigger ships you have more time to realize what you’re doing wrong before getting blown up, it’s easier to learn to pilot your ship by yourself and then smaller things will be a piece of cake, imo I tried the approach that everyone suggests to learn to fly tackle/frigs as you die pretty quick whether it’s vs another frig or anything up to a cruiser..
---
Since nobody has explained it to you Wally, some languages like german switch the usages of periods and commas when compared to US/UK usage.  It's literally the way he was taught to do it.
---
If you wanna get even more confused, "billion" historically in british english referred to 10^12, what is more commonly today called a trillion.
---
Keep at it Bro!!! Hit me up in game if you need a sparing partner. Always glad to help.
---
TIL I make more isk in a full 8hr dAy of krabbing C5 sites than delve does from pirate bounty.
---
How much isk do they make from ore?
---
i do...
---
Better headline:  **The Imperium use GSM to save penifSMASH**
---
&gt; local is
---
There's workarounds to having no local too. Removing local is not going to fix a damn thing in the long run.
---
We don't know that Plex sales boosted revenues and grew profits.
---
For example, I personally spend more money on Plex then I did previously, because it just doesn't make sense to krab if I can just spend $20 and have enough ISK to last me a couple of weeks.
---
So even though I cancelled my Rorq account, my total dollar spend on Eve is higher, and I enjoy the time I spend playing more.  CCP makes more money off of me, and I hate the game less. It's a win-win in my case.
---
I have noticed some bots have much longer waiting periods than others. 
---
Catching them with log off traps seems to be effective, but in the time it takes for you to load system and warp in, some can escape.
---
I am having some luck using an Assault Frigate, but I plan to switch to a Cynabal in the near future. It’s going to be a bit harder to evade gate camps, but I think that once I get inside the pocket it will be very effective.
---
Look up World War Bee.  Most of the current map is due to fallout from that conflict.
---
If only there was a way to tell that a character was logged in for longer than a person can normally sustain input actions, for days at a time. 
---
**IF ONLY*
---
150Mil is literally nothing. And Frig PVP is boring. 
---
Cruisers and above man. I can smash a retribution with a Navy Osprey or a phantasm no questions asked.
---
Could someone please explain what the fleet hangar and maintenance bay are for?
---
Now I want a boson titan to rat with
---
With that I meant that paying for gametime with real money isn't an option, especially now that CCP stopped regional pricing and puts a flat 15$ worldwide, so only viable option is to buy PLEX with isk from the market.
---
Google it mf, just type “Geometry translated to English”
---
&gt;you have to address PVP and the Ecosystem
---
New toon + injectors -&gt; supers/rorqs + "unlimited" rats/roids -&gt; high plex prices -&gt; players quitting.
---
I always thought folks used these outrageous prices to launder isk...well not launder but to buy isk with real money.  
---
I heard once that a guy wanted to buy like 20b ik so he paid some dude some farmer site like $50 (or whatever) and told him to post up cruise missiles at a billion each. and they bought 20.  deal done. looks like a mistake.  
---
Probably just a misclick.
---
Oh boy hope it goes as well as the last two time your leaders have tried before. Evictus will be fine I mean we never did much with you guys if we honest.
---
Mokeys nowhere near ready but let's see what happens.
---
As for evictus dying to you guys I'm pretty sure your KB in our space is pretty red so GL.
---
They make more money just doing what they should do, and that's let the player-driven market set the price. If you cant afford it, it's not for you.
---
If the dual web loki decloaks relatively close to you you won’t get out of range of the 47km webs by burning in a straight line
---
Sounds like you’re a fucking idiot
---
Population saturation. Occupancy sov at its finest. People logged in are actually doing things during every time zone. Euros, rus, aussies, china, NA, brasil, and even have folks from the middle east. Players are always using the space.
---
Citadels have given players more customized investment in using the space. Therefore there is more player investment in that space. The economy of delve supports players not having to leave to have their needs met outside of pvp, and due to space politics, hostiles to the delve residents come visit.
---
Delve has been upgraded to support wealth generation.
---
Happened to me when selling Broadcast nodes
---
When it hits TQ. We are screwed.
---
More than slight unfortunately.
---
Legion with rlml and 100mn can do 500dps cold out to like 30km and has near perfect application, it's a fantastic anti-support ship that can dumpster most anything below a BC.
---
Old player here.
---
If you took away my SP there’s absolutely nothing that will make me want to put up with the bullshit new player experience of running lvl 1-4’s and huffing wormhole gas again. Fuck dude I’d seriously rather get cancer.
---
&gt;bear with the stupid.     
---
     
---
What? You were straight up misrepresenting the data, then called him stupid when he called you out lmao.
---
These have been prerecorded so unless the camera was set up for that at the time unfortunately  not. Would be nice to have for next time though.
---
This - eve shows its age with its poorly developed and repetitive pve content.
---
Because at 2B+ for 500 Plex, it makes more sense to sell some Plex every few weeks then it does to krab, so my guess would be that they are making more money selling Plex now then they do when it is 1.6B  per 500.
---
Personally, I buy more Plex (from CCP) now then I have in the past because it's affordable enough that I don't have to krab.
---
Theres only a few systems in all of Querious with any real ratting going on.  The rest is QFC space, which are not goons, who are constantly fighting with each other to hold their sov.  Source: I manage QFC. If this sounds interesting to you and your alliance would like to participate, hit me up in game. :)
---
Man without SP you’d have to run highsec missions to make that isk again.
---
I’m sooooo not interested in starting eve online over.
---
Loki is the "meta' pick with passable damage, decent tank, fantastic utility and good solo power, Legion is better at dumpstering small shit in small gang (100mn rlml) or abusing it's good neuts, Tengu is the best hunter (prot can get a better warp speed bonus and gets scram/point range bonuses but can't fit as good a tank and has either dogshit range or dogshit DPS), it can also pull off a good rlml 100mn or rlml/HAM 10mn tanky as fuck fit and the Prot is a meme who can also hunt.
---
Step 1. Be broke in game
---
Step 2. Realize how hard it is to gain Isk
---
Step 3. Be credit card warrior
---
Step 4. What is ratting? It’s otrxlylxlgxlxlhxglzglxglxglxlgclhjfLxkzlgxgozpycoxogxxoc BOSON
---
If anyone says anything but LOKI. They’re fucking with you.
---
Lack of sales + speculators is causing the rise. If people weren't speculating so hard the price would be lower but still higher than its been historically. Prices were being kept low only because of sales which I'm not sure is a good thing.
---
I disagree that CCP needs to run a sale. Plexing shouldn't be the default action to sub an account.
---
This is the worst post I've seen in a long time (and this is /r/eve, so that's saying something).
---
You use actual data from the economic report mixed with your own "guess?" about where VNIs and other ships rat and then try to make it look like actual facts support your own strange interpretation.
---
7/10 for ironic hilarity.
---
Holy shit you are still playing?
---
Casper is one of the PL at pilots in the past who now lives semi-retied in low sec, flying mega expensive ships and pods with little to no risk due to low sec mechanics, while styling on little noobs trying out FW.
---
Tbh just elite nano reddit bittervets having an excuse for them getting bored of the game
---
3rd party retailers.
---
Also if it’s the big of an issue just don’t play?
---
Jesus, so many americans in here getting angry because they don't understand that some languages write numbers differently.  It just makes you look like a sheltered kid.  OP wrote 12.971 billion not as a decimal point but as 12971 billion, because in many languages periods and not commas are used as place separators.  1.000 is a thousand in germany for example.  So calm the fuck down, today you learned something.
---
Experience does not equal to critical thinking. I have experienced a huge amount of Eve, and I admit that I am not an expert in the game. I do have the ability to think through a problem and see how it could impact many different aspects of the game.
---
How is it a pain? Or only making pennies? You yourself stated it would be a good way for new players to make ISK. If new players can make ISK, old players can exploit it for profit as well lol.
---
The one situation I can see it being useful is for 100mn WH anti-cap fits, when you are shooting a fax for 20 minutes anyways since fax tank is retardedly good the additional spoolup is nice.
---
Pretty sure that's the fuckin AOL icon
---
Hmm... Well, that actually isn't too hard to do! The only challenge is discerning the difference between items that are traded a lot and items that are botted, but that doable I think! I'll look into it :)
---
edited my original comment as i forgot how to format on reddit. should clear up the confusion.

Wow crazy it's almost like we are both writing this in English, you know, where you would follow that languages rules when writing.

Too bad you need to use potato mode for big null fights.

You go on a german forum and write as well as he does in english, then you can bitch.
---
&gt;Online
---
i see your 95 and raise you a 96%
---
any bids on 96%?
---
Dividing server population would probably not end well. I agree with the sentiment though.
---
This still is not proof of botting.  I often have a couple of vni spinning on the 2nd and 3rd screen while I play more eve or world of tanks. 
---
I'm not saying that you are wrong.  The tactics are solid.  But nothing in this video is conclusive.
---
I would argue the social booster is one of the best things for the new players trying to make isk. The standings grind is fucking annoying man. And they gotta catch up somehow.
---
That's disappointing.
---
I might be wrong but I believe multiboxing will still skew the PCU since each open character is a separate account.
---
I think you may be mistaken on this point. If anyone needed improved PvE it's the new player. Most players would still benefit from such improvements though. However, if all you think PvE consists of is incursions, then I can kind of see where you got this idea from. Incursions aren't even new player content. Incursion fleets are known for their bling fits, which new players can't get.
---
Fuck you bot!
---
LOL that's not how it works. I'm not on a german forum, nor did I try to write in one.
---
He got called out for misrepresenting the data, which he did, then called the guy stupid in response. 
---
We are on an ENGLISH speaking forum so you follow the rules of the language not the rules of how you are taught.
---
I'll concede that it might have gone up while I've been out.
---
They do in wormholes.
---
Let me tell you about 2007 me feeling like the King Shit of Ballsland because I finally trained up enough to fly a T2 rail fitted harpy with a sniper fit...
---
.... for really quite a long time before I realised that one should *activate* tracking computers to get best use from them.
---
The only way to stop vni ratting being the pinnacle of pve efficiency is to remove what makes it an outlier among all cruisers: its ability to do more DPS than the equivalent battleship. Remove 1 of its heavy drones, there, problem solved. It's still a very strong cruiser and generates 20% less isk, getting more in line with other ships. Ofc the gila desperately needs a redesign too, but that's a separate issue.
---
1-3 are fine I guess? You can't completely remove the most important isk sink in the game(ratting income), but you can definitely tone it down and add a couple steps to getting the isk without breaking the economy. 4 is just plain silly, anyone with half a brain will bounce safespots, or hell bounce off a planet with 20 moons. Anything that isn't a carrier will have no trouble doing that, and even caps won't get caught unless the attacker has combat probes and is fairly competent at using them.
---
As for bots, this does absolutely nothing against them. Now you'll just see noctis bots or something like that running after the vni bots looting and salvaging, gathering loot to be moved by jf to low/hisec. It's just one more mundane task to automate.
---
\*salutes in triangle*
---
So you cant even remember the name of the alliance you left and you think they are screwed without you?
---
Unironically nothing of value was lost.
---
More demand than offer, price rise. Nothing new. No PLEX sale will fix this until injectors are a thing.
---
I seriously question the ammount of income a character at 1 mil so or lower could make that would make it worth while to an old player.
---
You spelled immensea incorrectly
---
Are you retarded or something?
---
I dont think he spent $30k of RL money he owned a massive casino out of game and had plenty of money to waste.
---
I wish you'd come back to providence, the new discount Jin'taan vyshnegradsky guy is pretty boring.
---
13 trillion isk being injected per month is a ton of isk :|
---
Hell even a few years after eve started that was probably more isk then every single player combined had (aka all the liquid isk available in the economy).
---
This looks like a problem to me :|
---
I realized my error, it was june 6th.
---
D-Day ;)
---
&gt;you are bad
---
&gt;thinks the dual web loki will have a scram
---
&gt;thinks the retribution has perfect agility and does 3km/s instatnly to any direction
---
&gt;thinks you can easily leave a loki's web range in 7 seconds at 3km/s
---
poetic really
---
150m is not nothing to a new player. If they want to learn the ropes of solo PVP, frigates are a good place to start. They probably don't have the ISK or skill points to repeatedly field Navy Ospreys or Phantasms so don't give bad advice.
---
If you make rorqual mining more interactive, are you going to push for higher yields? 
---
I have one rorqual that I multi-box with while doing whatever I want on my main. It gives me about 75M per hour and a large rock will last me about 1.5 hours. 
---
If you make it so I can’t multi box it while I do other things, why shouldn’t I extract the skills and inject into a carrier instead?  I would use the same effort to earn isk faster. 
---
Or just afk in a Gila or VNI for half the income, but without disrupting my play style? 
---
If you don’t own and use a rorqual, I really really don’t think you should push for changes. You should fly a ship before making decision about it. 
---
But hey if we’re sharing ideas. The rorqual isn’t a carrier, it’s a dread. It has a siege cycle, the only real difference is that it is drone based instead of turret based. 
---
If you wanted to change the rorqual. You’d find more support for swapping the excavator drones out for a capital mining laser or 5. You want it to be more interactive? The mining crystals will fail and need to be reloaded, so it can’t be afk’d quite as much, but without the click spam of carrier ratting. 
---
There are lots of people who want to fix ships they haven’t flown, or ships that they perceive to be a problem. But, since you want to run for a leadership position, I would rather hear you ask for more information and ask the community what they think, rather than proposing a solution to game mechanic you don’t have personal experience with. 
---
Good luck on the run.

I didn't realize this was a star citizen subreddit.
---
Then the content is not for you \^\_\^
---
Just no tether all together please.
---
You're the reason the rest of the world despises us, you know that right?
---
It's an international forum that happens to use english, the LEAST we can do around here is be lenient on people who take the effort to learn OUR language to communicate, because you sure as fuck are too lazy to learn theirs.  
---
He didn't misrepresent anything, it wasn't inaccurate, it wasn't untrue, it just wasn't written the way you expected to see it.  Be smart enough to figure out what someone who made an effort that you couldn't be assed to is trying to say.
---
You sound like the kind of Karen down at the local chipotle place flipping tables because some hispanic guys english wasn't perfect. 
---
And if you want to be RIGHT.  The internationally agreed standard (yes, that includes the US), isn't comma OR periods, its spaces.
---
Arty wolf is a great. Alpha is great vs active tanks (which are really common these days)
---
Super Bots make +/-150mil ticks, even calculating the fighter losses, and are Roy hard to catch, if u don't time it perfectly u never catch one
---
And totally broken.
---
&gt; The internationally agreed standard (yes, that includes the US), isn't commas OR periods, its spaces. 1 000 = one thousand.     
---
Which he didn't use. Thanks for proving my point though lol. 2ez
---
Pretty sure this is a weird euro thing where decimals are used in place of commas for anything over 3 figures
---
wrong
---
It's a gateway ore.
---
To be fair, with leadership Mia, and half of the alliance inactive, they're evicting themselves
---
WrOnG
---
How can you safe log in the anom? You get shoot by rats so you have a timer and cannot log off
---
All of the triglavian ships are broke.  The power ramp is too high, the starting point is too low. Speed is too high, sig radius is too low. Tracking is too high, range is too low.
---
TBH, I am saddest about the loss of the M-Z keepstar for the moment.
---
Go for 3x Hull ehp in rigs, DC and 3x dps in lows then dual web + scram &amp; MWD in mids; 5x Guns and Combatscanner, use sisters core.
---
Look up "The King" - Hecate on YouTube. If you get T2 and go for Implants to boost your damage you get up to 930 dps.
---
&gt; wrong, blopsing cannot be seen w/o local
---
Fair point.
---
Well, if "never did much with you guys" translates into "was half of Evictus' fleet numbers" then yup!
---
In the video I describe how to do so:
---
1. Make sure you have absolutely no timers of anykind
---
2. Do NOT be in fleet 
---
3. Open your escape menu and select "log off" instead of "safe log off"
---
An interesting thing that you can find in Relic sites is a Black Monolith that’s the size of a capital. 
---
The first time I found one, the site had 9 Intact Armor Plates in a can, which was a small start to my Titan fund.
---
Think of the other guy prob like wtf kind of bait is this?
---
Funny thing, I created an Alpha char a few months ago as Null has got soooo boring and, I’ve actually been having some fun slowly skilling up and trying to put a few earned ISK in the wallet.
---
Well, IOU is getting that one from us, so it's not forever
---
If it was a real afk player, the vni wouldnt:
---
1. Recall drones when you enter system
---
2. Align out
---
3. Attempt to warp
---
4. Have timed instances of actions
---
5. React to hostiles in any way
---
so its true, autists do have sensitive earballs.
---
A 25% error invalidates a point made on a 55% difference?
---
If you use it enough then yeh, its only a couple weeks training.
---
The Beacons are lit,
---
I am super hyped for these. Lore *and* gameplay goodies.
---
And then you ACTIVLY get rid of them to get the system clear. But I guess you would be one of those krabs that would get temporarily get hurt that they can't krab 24/7 anymore.
---
I'd suggest you also use the compare tool in-game. It helps a lot to see which module is best for your situation. Maybe you need less cpu/PG, maybe less capacitor use. It helps to find out which module to select
---
It's cool you guys were classy about the assets and such. Welcome to the family! Look forward to flying with you all!
---
Your "point" was:
---
&gt;You were straight up misrepresenting the data,
---
Which was not the case.  It was a simple language barrier situation, one you addressed with insults and a superiority complex.  OP and Wally were BOTH confused in not understanding cultural differences.  But OP didn't start the insults, that was wally.
---
https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage, this is your Bible 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
Seems to be a bug, the asset safety system seems to think your reaper is worth ~1.7bn
---
Don’t worry Immensea. W4RP is here to defend you.
---
That definitely make sense.
---
oops
---
This. Ratting carriers bring isk into the game. Making carriers cheaper by reducing the percentile value of minerals means you're bringing isk into the game.
---
Nah I’m probably gonna vote for Compayn and make wormholes great again.
---
Yeah idk what vnis and supers are doing these days, I was just putting numbers to show the point. You can change the numbers and it doesn't really change the point.
---
I'm the same way. But like all of Reddit, /eve is mostly a place to complain and/or insult others.
---
Every MMO is dying and reddit posters know why.
---
You're an absolute legend, what a great video
---
but when you didnt scram chris because you forgot to stop repairing I physically crigned and reflexively screamed "yOU FUCK IDIOT" like the backseat solo pvper noob that I am
---
&gt; Legion does great neut work, probably the top t3c when it comes to wormholes.... but I find its damage output really lackluster.
---
What? My 100mn HAM Legion does close to 800 DPS with rage, that's anything but low.
---
This period as a comma thing is confusing as fuck.
---
Lol I love how everyone is jumping down GOTGs throat when it was literally only Hanoi who formed for it with his Alliance because everyone else wanted to whore or not even be bothered with it. Hanzo lied but sort died?
---
&gt;WinterCO ... well thats just asking to get stomped by legacy
---
where have you been lately lol? 
---
You're in an offensive war, and your leader have already posted a demoralizing post where he cried about you being in danger of being evicted. You have taken no systems, killed no relevant citadels.
---
When will the stomping happen? When daddy goon bails you out?
---
CCPs fiscal reports are public iirc. So you could compare them.
---
Casting my vote towards goons, sorry gotta keep GSM
---
Frig pvp is much higher 'APM' so to speak due to relative speeds and damage application. Maybe boring doesn't mean what you think it means. Some rando lands on your current fight grid in his falloff range and hes grazing you and you manual yourself to a better position for the killing blows and suddenly your transversal is bad and rando wrecks you... more exciting I'd say.
---
We Need You Pilots,

Ive had a lot of success in thrashers. 200mm can work (some of the MASB fits hold up like a boss) but Ive had the most success with high alpha arty, usually 2 or 3 shot most T1 frigs. Only issue is them getting into a close orbit and you cant track, I started using dual web no point setups and it worked well, they go 1/2 health from the 1st volley and cant warp out in time usually. I sit on the out side of the plex gates at about 10 off the entrance. Just be pre aligned when something hits short range dscan, so you can bail when he pops (expect his friends XD)
---
Also had some kills in all out dps cormoranta (you can get to around 400dps) the opposite danger here, they orbit outside blaster range.
---
There are more mechanics in kspace that really wouldn't work without local, yup.
---
… so either you're an asshole trying to screw over alpha characters, which are *the only real source of incoming new players,* or you're just working a scam.
---
Cool.
---
The other thing to note is most botting activity is to get into a super and then super rat. Super dies, repeat.
---
I actually plex half of my two accounts. I’m just glad I bought all my PLEX in January. 
---
You could also do something nice and buy Plex.
---
We're both in Horde. If you want to give it another shot in a few hours or tomorrow let me know and I'll pay for the ships.
---
lol fucking american, how about you guys adapt to the civilized world eh?
---
You can do the same thing in cruisers, where you actually have enough dps to kill stuff.
---
Take my upvote. Fuck botters but still, this is stupid. Risk aversion in general is stupid. Big alliances  need to start thinking about overall game health.
---
Mfw sitting on a nice plex stack I bought like in october
---
This is the second thread where you're trying to show off how cool you are by flaunting either your wealth or your elite skills in blobbing shit.
---
One, shut the fuck up, you suck at PvP. 
---
Two, you should be encouraging newbies to go out and try on their own, not try to shame them for flying within their skill and means.
---
Half of your two accounts... a long amount of words to day “I plex one account” this isn’t a college essay, you’re not trying to reach a word limit.
---
hey, im fairly new as well, what i think really helps is to use a destroyer when you start, simply because that's the only way you can last enough and understand what you're doing, in most cases a destroyer may be too much for a frigate, but trust me what really counts is being a good pilot first, then you can go back to frigate pvp, when your player skills are better and you have better bonuses.
---
keep doing it, i used to die 20times per day getting 0 kills, now i die 10 times per day and i can almost get 10 kills haha
---
I recall my drones when someone enters system.  I align and then warp when i have my drones back.
---
shhhh gotta keep up the narrative!
---
This is 'safer' than using badly-weighted contracts, since those are monitored and get reviewed pretty quickly.
---
You know you done f'ked up when a chat window opens without asking for your permission, and someone is asking about your contract. xD
---
Also, PLEX is needed to extract those Alpacas because, you know, there is only one way to get extractors...  Once again the real winner is CCP.
---
Hello there! I am a bot raising awareness of Alpacas
---
 
---
 Here is an Alpaca Fact:
---
 A cow consumes 10% its body weight in water per day. Alpacas need just one half to three quarters of a gallon per one hundred pounds body weight per day.

That's not proof.  It's all open to perception. You wanted to believe it was a bot so you do.  
---
Please explain how a person couldn't do everything you described?
---
STRANGER DANGER
---
Save Low sec, save Eve
---
stop reporting this mans post history tia
---
did you mean trillion in all your figures?
---
See how many people live in Delve, then see how many live in Branch, you'll have the answer.
---
That's basically what I did when I wasn't in Test, I have come back to Dreddit for now because friends wanted me to, and purely to pvp. I make my money trading in hisec and importing to combat hubs in Black Rise and now in Test space. I don't put that much time into managing it, only thought, and once you figure it out it's not that hard. Content is there, every time I undock I can still find a fight.
---
More people need to do this, so we can have more small fights. We get the big fights in Eve, the problem is what happened to the small fights? I still get them every night, but now I get like 4 or 5 ganks and a fight on a 2 hour roam. I used to be able to get at least a couple fleets to fight.
---
The fleet hangar is just a regular item hangar with the added feature that you can allow members of your fleet or alliance to access it as well. They can store or retrieve items in it while in space just as if your ship was a cargo container. 
---
Use cases involve resupplying a fleet without docking up, miners depositing ore in there and so on, or general item sharing in case jettisoning is too risky. 
---
The ship maintenance bay (a.k.a. SMA) is used specifically for storing fitted ships - just like a ship hangar in a station. You can also open it up to fleet/corp, and people can fly up to you and store their ship in the SMA, or board a stored ship. You can't store any items in it other than fitted ships, and the cargo bays of those ships can contain nothing besides charges (ammo, cap boosters, probes etc.). Another feature is that any ship within range (2,500) of an SMA can use it as a mobile depot for refitting, onlining modules etc. 
---
Use cases involve moving a large supply of fitted ships to a deployment zone, wormholers store their heavy ships in them and travel in pods, thereby reducing the mass they put on the wormholes they go through, and so on.
---
I must be terrible at this game. I've been playing for two years and I don't own a single titan...
---
I can't speak for Android, but on iOS I use Neocom II. If it's available on Android as well I would definitely recommend
---
Well provi wouldn’t exist If aralis hadn’t created cva/provi , so EQ couldn’t have taken over tbf.
---
Because a real player who cares about his ship would:
---
1. Immediately attempt to warp out as soon as someone landed on grid disregarding the drones.
---
2. If afk, would continue to spin with drones still out and prop mod still on.
---
3. Not attempt to warp out as soon as a hostile enters system
---
4. Not wait exactly 10 minutes to start ratting again.
---
5. Call for help.
---
6. Fight back and not wait 12 seconds to put drones on you
---
7. Not wait 6 seconds to warp out as soon as point drops and recall drones
---
8. Not sit still after being pointed.
---
9. Have near perfectly timed reactions.
---
10. Speak lmao
---
11. Not be in a known botting corporation in a known botting renter alliance
---
Thermodynamics trained for overheating?
---
Do you know which ships you should engage and which you can't kill?
---
Have you started training in traversal tactics?
---
I've just returned also and these are just a few of the things I was told to start working on and getting better at.
---
Also try and find a mentor in that big ass alliance to show you the ropes?
---
And please have someone process my app :)
---
One could argue CCP wants PvE to be boring as fuck so people that can afford it just buy plex instead.
---
Good bot.
---
I agree
---
Yeah a guy in our alliance did the same thing. It gets complicated with all the mechanics of the modules. The most important thing isn't  your KB, isk per hour or any of that. The most important thing is having fun. Don't fret over it too much.
---
Massive battle underway as triglavian ships assault the keepstar in 1DQ1-A.

---
what a legend
---
I know, I just thought it was funny :D
---
Why do you down vote a legitimate discussion attempt without reading what you are replying to?  I said I agree to the point that this is proof. it's evidence but not proof.
---
FYI: only baddies (or people bashing) use lasers on legions. HAMs are they way to go on legions.
---
ricardo isnt the only one in this video with some smooth dance moves
---
Yeah, but how can you be in an anom without no timer, the rat shoot you when you land in the anom lol
---
Good bot
---
Honestly, this is some next level shit
---
That risk aversion is the problem. People need to get more counter gangs out.
---
I think if you run out of fuel then it goes into low power mode that has 2 weeks of "Reserve" fuel. Then after 2 weeks it has no RF cycle and can just be killed. There is no reason to have tether spots all over the galaxy unattended.
---
The funny thing is that's only like 60-30% better than a cow. So per 100lb of cow you use 10lb of water, which is like 1.25 gallons, vs .5-.75 gal / 100 lb of alpaca. So better, but not astoundingly so.
---
 Alpacas and other camelids were the most important resources of ancient peoples in South America.
---
You have an invisible "invulnerable timer".
---
When you land, do NOT move or activate mods.
---
Make sure you have no other timers in the top left of your screen, not in a fleet, then select "log off"
---
Lol. Vysh is great, I'm glad to see him finally step up and be a more mainline FC.
---
Yeah thats a great deal!
---
Don't get me wrong, they are great but they threw an expiry date on them, kinda fucked over anyone who speculated on them.
---
I grabbed a few back when they came out, not a tonne, but enough to be annoyed they now expire.
---
My argument would be that Aralis created CVA but EQ created the modern Provibloc. The two aren't really the same thing at all, and CVA is definitively not the same ambitious, super capital wielding force it was when Aralis birthed it.
---
Why are you deleting your old comments lmao
---
Dreddit, you can't have him back. We're taking Vaportrail to moviestar status.
---
Big tip for Saar.
---
Overheat that shit.
---
Armor reps get an amount heat bonus. Shields get cycle time.
---
Saar should be treated as a delayed armor plate without a mass penalty that pays off over X seconds at the cost of a relatively small amount of cap. Using it after paste runs out is a bonus.
---
Heating it means you will get more hp out of your paste, and usually lowslot heat isn't bad to deal with (unlike mids). Meaning it's very unlikely that you will burn out your rep before you die. And if you get close. Just stop. Its not like you're going to get heat damage spreading from your other lowslots like you would with point/web/prop.
---
I recommend trying to ride in low armor pulsing your rep. Try to make the other guy think he has a chance. That will make people less likely to attempt to bail a fight that you're winning.
---
You've been given a very good chunk of evidence. But yeah sorry thats not "proof"
---
Next time I'll hack into the dude's computer mainframe and send you video of his software usage, social security number and maybe some toe nail clippings idk
---
what are fighters
---
Oh my this is starting to sound more and more interesting :o
---
If I upgrade to omega in 14 days, when I'm at the last alpha reward, will I get all the 16 omega rewards?
---
If you're talking about PvE, you're just whining when it comes to supers. 100k ticks are still easy even with Gal/Min Carrier IV and a relatively decent tank.  
---
It stopped supers being an instant 'I win' button against small groups of subs, as we've found out in Eso though - I believe this was the intended effect :-)
---
My other comment got tons of hate.
---
I don’t think that Frig Solo PVP is necessarily the best way for “New players” to learn solo PVP at all. It’s one of the hardest things to fly, and you all are recommending Retributions and telling me Navy Ospreys are more SP (I’m fairly sure cruisers 4 is a shorter skillque than Assault Frigs 4). 
---
But I digress. I think New players should learn how to PVP in cruisers like the Navy Osprey or the Omen Navy. Both can be fit cheaper (~100mil) than a “Viable” retribution. I found it easier to learn about transversal application from flying the Omen navy issue and shooting frigs rather than being a frigate and getting shot. Think about it. You only have one opportunity to encounter the edge of transversal in your retribution before its GG. But in anti-tackle cruisers shooting at frigs you can pretty much see how to fly in a session with a good mentor.
---
From there go learn the hurricane Fleet issue and the phantasm. I know it’s a little pricey but they’re the best in the meta, and they can all do more damage to an Orca than a retribution can. 
---
If you don’t believe me, look at [chessueSB’s old videos](https://youtu.be/39AawRaxXeQ) . He consistently told new players not to fly fast tackle.
---
Once again If I had to start from scratch I would train for the Navy Osprey W/Light missiles(100mil) &gt; Omen Navy Issue(120mi (To learn Transversal) &gt; Hurricane fleet Issue(300Mil &gt; Orthrus(300mil) .
---
You can buy like ten of them if you buy PLEX from CCP. Also I was making about 200Mil every other day from doing PI on just one account when I was a noob all the way up until now. So I think you guys have a problem making isk that isn’t tied to the newness of your account.
---
Which is 4-6 pounds of water, or 4-6% of its body weight - call it 5%.  In other words, half as much as a cow.
---
P.S. Beneficent bot
---
Is it a requirement to put spvg on your reddit account?
---
The beauty if an offensive war is you dont have a timeline. You can just keep creating tiners for the enemy to make them show up, then basically go back to ratting and spodbrain waiting for the enemy to wear themselves out.
---
You forgot to mention Detorid as a giant bot farm.
---
&gt;Pandemic Horde
---
Pretty much!
---
If you have to state that, I'm not sure you're in "Idiot-Free Cool People Chat"...
---
stop memeing. they believe this.
---
So much work just to bring the same PvE dogshit gameplay as usual, except this time in red.
---
plot twist, there's a bunch of PLEX in it and they're trying to use public support to get CCP to release it for free :P
---
Ahh I did not know this... I was always under the impression that it was when your ship finally started warping...
---
Ccplz why do bubbles catch you on a gate after you have hit warp but they don't when ur warping into one?
---
whatever that meabs
---
laughed out loud in work... never not upvote clever film references.
---
Right click anything. Also for module comparison I usually use fuzzworks, Google it. You can then sort it by range, cap usage, sign bloom, fitting requirements or whatever thing you're interested in whatever module you're looking. Also, certain ships with certain fittings are just the almost the perfect counter for others.
---

I was in F-OFF in 2006 with my first account when Raven was the leader.
---
You say you are looking to get into wh's so it's a PvP T3C you want. I'll agree with the general consensus that Loki is king atm. I favour a HAM fit using the long web. A HAM Legion with its neut ss is my default replacement when I lose a Loki. The biggest threat to you when your out with friends is energy neuts, most often fit to a Strat so be on the watch for that when missiles start to fly. HAM meta seeming so strong for T3's in jspace I believe a Pilgrim to be a valid alternative to have available to you as you can wreck their tank and dps application.
---
Proteus and Tengu are not nothing but what they lack is being the best option for when you want a ship for their purpose.
---
&gt;I really wish BoT would change their alliance name.
---
Same thing with RMT. I get that the point is to be "edgy". I find it quite distasteful.
---
Paste = nanite paste as ammo
---
Hmm, I was playing for almost a year in highsec and for another one in low/FW.  Managed to recruit a IRL friend and we went oplexing. He was playing for 2 months when the following story happened. We find a dude, tackle and we were screaming to each other to overheat and barely succed in killing him. My friend then needs to go to station to repair his burned modules while I was all good. He asked me what was my Therodynamics level. Apparently I was hitting the overheat button without even having the skill injected. So...yeah...
---
You're just mad because you can't see your forehead.
---
It's fake. OP even had another comment about how he hadn't seen Endgame about 5 days after release that someone dredged up. He was just karma farming.
---
It's main benefit is that it uses a lot less capacitor than a normal armor repair module.
---
its true tho the CEO enforces it
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75997658/ I like to think we doing okay
---
Oh they expire now? Did they retroactively go back and change it?
---
i feel bad for you if you actually believe this...
---
what's your frigate of choice?
---
Who the fuck is RMT?
---
This is some next level professional shit. I love it!
---
The best way to learn how to fly a ship well is by flying it. They fly a T3 but dunno how, maybe one of us will kill them (always yay) and they'll learn or be sore about losing it. In the latter case, they're probably not ready after all :D
---
Well I didn't realise that eve was doing make a wish for you guys, guess we have all the proof here

While y'all worry about plex I'm over here spending 3 hours of work a month subbing mine

But do you still have your original noobship?

I lost a shitton of fights because i forgot to load guns and/or SAAR.
---
Gila don't need to be blingy to run t4 reliably as long as the skill points of the pilot are high and the actual skill of the person is good (knowing how to get under guns, what to kill first etc).
---
More expensive fits allow for lower skill point characters to run 5's and higher skill point characters to have more room to screw up.
---
Wait what?  What the hell is repair paste?  What's a SAAR?
---
Has EVE finally passed me by?

---
Lol. The Navy Osprey is cheaper and easier to fly than a retribution. You should encourage new players to fly good ships not to continue to feed you faggot.
---
I did this for a few days on a trip. Worked fine. As long as your connection is strong enough.
---
I do it all the time. Run 5 accounts and have the settings on low graphics. Frame rate is pretty decent. Jita is a bit of a graphics struggle but it works well for me.

Depending on your phone package, in some cases it could be just as good if not better than a cable internet.. I remember my old internet provider went to dogshit for a while and I spent good 2-3 months pretty much only using my hotspot, I’d even download  with 5-10mbps
---
You lost me there in that last part.

Did it also few times and never had any problem, but i hope you have unlimited traffic...

Yeah, unlimited data. Otherwise I wouldn't bother lol.

Looks pretty spiffy, although I'm sure most of the time I'd be too busy getting away from a gate than to enjoy the sight

Nice, good to know. Gonna be weird not having wifi for a while so hoping this works out.

Well then your golden, plug and play😁

I avoid Jita at all costs lol.

---
He had to have the Imperial Jubilee skin, too.
---
Also something to keep in mind, I’m not sure what phone you have but on iPhone at least, when you turn on your hotspot you get the option to use Bluetooth or USB and I noticed the connection is way better with a USB..
---
I checked a data map for where I'm going, it looks like I'll have solid coverage but who knows.
---
Then I think you will. Be just fine. In the past 2 weeks I have only used 3 gigs of data by playing eve with my hotspot. So it just sips data.
---
Both myself, and the person I was quoting, are not eligable because we're over the age of 18.
---
That would be nice... Samsung so I dont think that's an option.
---
I didn't have the money to buy plex for isk so I quit instead.
---
That's awesome... I was wondering how much it would use. Thanks

Shows that is my last reply to a propaganda toxic F1 monkey.

Welcome to reddit!
---
Ok. But why
---
Good to know, hoping that's the case for me or this will be a boring trip.
---
Only two? I consider eve to be about ten games or so.
---
just adapt and get 3-4 vni alts
---
You are a real mouthbreather
---
Is that a standard gate? Why does it have a triglavian logo on it?
---
I agree with you, the sad part is the majority of Eve players seem to be adults in their late 20s and older with children and all, yet they can’t seem to stop whining about literally everything and anything.
---
I suspect we'll find out tomorrow?
---
gates have the logo of whose space it goes to. If an area is under triglavian incursion the gates leading to it will show triglav, because they "own it" temporarily.
---
An important question!

I dont play in null, and I dont have interest in it.  These strats dont work in wormholes :p

Yay welcome back!

Snuff brings less subcaps. Everyone says "GF" as long as snuff dies. Snuff brings more, people complain that they no longer hold the advantage.

how much did you pay for this guy to say that LUL
---
Friend I lost a moracha last week. Just keep your head up mate. 👌
---
Certain meta modules are retarded expensive though.  The pg low comes to mind.   Just pay attention when buying so you dont waste money.

can i have your stuff?

PLEXing accounts only costs a few hundred mil at most if you’re sp farming and extracting them

Apparently so, i like him (simply because hes a brit like myself) however he hasnt exactly seemed like the happiest of people since we joined cva a few months ago, still its a shame.

I'm more of a geek than I thought; I immediately recognized the opening from the first frame with apes ... and I didn't even have sound turned-on [Eve has sound?]

 That's my pleasure, I'm a victim of Yugoslav war. One of my uncle execution by Milosevic Government. My elder sister was kidnapped and raped by Croatian soldiers when she was 14 during the Bosnian war. War destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage in my hometown, Banja Luka.  Btw, are you Yugoslavians or Albanians?  **IN GOD WE ARE BROTHER &amp; SISTER, GOD WILL IT**.
---
Did this for a few weeks in China. it worked fine, just the signal  would cut out every time we went into a tunnel. There were a lot of tunnels.
---
If it makes you feel better my fisrt pvp was in a dominix.  Fitted with small guns and a web.  I got webbed, scrammed, and popped by an incursus.  Learned sooo many lessons that day. This was 2009 btw.
---
I don't normally bite the bait here, but I'm genuinely curious where your vitriol comes from.. Maybe I can start to understand why so many people get upset over the tiniest things like this.
---
I've been playing EVE for 9 years and I've not once looked at something the devs put out and thought "Jesus fuck these guys are ruining the game! They need to fix this or that! CCPs your wasting your time on X when you should be working on Y!"
---
I understand that CCP hasn't always made the right choices for the game, or kept the players interest at heart, and that they can't make everyone happy with every update.
---
But holy shit, do we really need to react with such such a shitty attitude? If this Stargate animation update bothers you that much, and you care enough about the game to be upset about it, why not take a deep breath and calmly write out a mature email or forum post about it. Because comments like these make this sub and the games community look bad.
---
If botting is a particularly a problem with Vexor Navy Issues is so widespread, lucrative, and damaging the simple way to end the problem is report every sale of a VNI or its' blueprint to CCP.  It is now their problem to create the internal company tool to track the creation and use of these ships.
---
I &lt;3 vysh
---
That would semi defeat the purpose of plexing my accounts.  
---
I hear you that SP farming can earn isk, and maybe a legit option for my alts at times if I dont care much for their skill progress, but still doesn't address the issue in a way.
---
no u
---
Lots of good comments and advice here. Thanks everyone.
---
If you can guess what I had for lunch. You get 1 guess.
---
pasta
---
I've played on my laptop tethered to my mobile phone.
---
Worked fine.  Data usage wasn't too horrible, but I didn't do any fleet fights.
---
I think you are playing wrong my man, you are making your Eve experience unenjoyable and I honestly think that if I played the same way as you, I wouldn’t probably make a similar reddit post.
---
You don’t need multiple characters to have fun, but it could help for instance, I’ve got a alpha VNI alt on my laptop which makes me enough isk to cover all kind of welps under a bil... On my main I can make up to a bil or two on a good day just exploring in Sansha space
---
Lastly, If I was to plex my account I would honestly feel like all my efforts towards making isk would go to waste, I just feel like it’s not worth it and $15 isn’t all that much if you’re working as most people surely can afford alcohol and cigarettes, I don’t see a problem here...

One of our organisations was contracted to do this by a 3rd party, we tried the peaceful approach, explained to OP the merits of Signal Cartel the meaning of the statue.
---
OP’s attitude sucked and he has at several points told us to get f*ed and suck a d*ck. He blamed SC for the war by being eligible and so he was given final terms of surrender which included an apology to SC for being petulant children.

I believe you’ve tried to contact us Thrice, feel free to reach out when you have time.

In the past I've dualboxed and FC'd fleets from hotspots, Eve also uses surprisingly little data. As long as you get a half decent signal you'll be fine.

So, yes. You are.

When I first started to PvP I put a Heat Sink on my Thorax because I thought it sounded more efficient than "Magnetic Field Stabilizer" 
---
Don't give up!
---
Top tier content.
---
*Anyways hope I don't come across acting as if working for isk should be easier or anything*
---
But you are. Also, you dont even play the game anymore, why should you care?
---
*but not if my style of play is not sustainable*
---
Adapt or die carebear, thats always been the mantra.
---
100m is around ten t1 frigs.  The reason we recomend people learn in them is exactly their unforgiving nature and their price point.  Your mistakes are evident immediately and Bob teaches you faster than anything else.
---
"Rate My Ticks". They're basically the same as BoT as far as I can tell.
---
not correct  
---
it uses exactly the same amount of capacitor as a t2 armor repairer of the same size  
---
please refrain from giving people uninformed advice tyvm
---
6 results for 'retri' on this page, all of them are from your posts.
---
Aswell as your other points, you seem to be arguing with yourself for some reason. I really dont know what the point of your comments are, are you trying to convince the op to fly cruisers? are you arguing with a specific point?
---
fuck off goon pet
---
Makes it even more eve-ish
---
Doesn't seem to have any impact on daily average, so can't be too many.
---
The Small Ancillary Armor Repairer uses Nanite Repair Paste to rep more.
---
Nanite Repair Paste is also used to repair damage done to modules from overheating them.
---
The problem is, I already spend 30 a month on it when I play.  
---
I have my combat main and 2 other accounts that I run with during pvp engagements.  Either 1 is a scout or I dual box guardians or what not. My other is logistics and scouting. I use all 3 when farming for isk so my income is typically really good.  Its risky and challenging to stay safe in wormhole farming but I really enjoy it.
---
If I were to take away 1 of my 3 mains Ide feel it. I know because I've started back in eve saying "alright I'm going to play but only 2 accounts this time" , only a few days later saying F it I really need my third and dropping another 15 to get it.
---
When your used to running around with 3 chars all the time 2 feels too slow. 
---
But the guilt of 45$ a month is too much.  I have a family and I shouldn't be wasting that much on a single game per month.  This wasnt a problem before plex prices rose above the 1.5-1.8 bil mark. Its just far too much for me. 
---
I know other areas of space have resolutions for this.  I know multiboxing VNI all day afk or rorq mining can bring it what you need.  But it's just not addressing the issue Im bringing up.  Inflation affects everything you buy and sell typically.  But wormhole blue loot is static, unchanging and is not affected by supply and demand.  And hasn't changed... ever.
---
Its just not right.
---
&gt; Armor reps get an amount heat bonus. Shields get cycle time.  
---
both get both
---
I like how pathetic you are that you actually care to downvote.
---
I used to solo drop haw at the back of my college class using 4g hotspot (EE)

Er, a t2 fit retri costs 60-70m, a t2 fit osnav is 110-120m.
---
As for easier to fly, it depends on what you're doing and who you're with.
---
That said, your pretentiousness is unwarranted lmao.
---
We're hoping heavily for this. Some see it as the potential to evict smaller alliances, which is a valid concern, but it's also got the potential to unseat long-standing empires from their area of relative comfort (or at least require the use of the significant buildup of assets that most of them have). 
---
It also can possibly put a dent in the botting issue since botters would actually have to focus down these invasions or lose structures and pilots.
---
All this remains to be seen, but I'm personally hopeful.
---
Well thats kind of a shit response.  I have "died" in a sense: https://zkillboard.com/character/91820761/
---
That's my main and you'll notice I dont play anymore...
---
Its the reason why I felt to post. I was very active and lead a small corp, it was a tiny part of the eve ecosystem, a typicall part that players should probably care about.  
---
If adapting is getting 7 rorquals and living in delve or just botting supers than I'm happy to die...
---
So we can shutdown HS gates to create ultimate safe crab heaven?
---
Seems like you are contradicting the point you've made
---
The would be Eve's final breath. Where PvE, NPC/AI takes over player functions, bcs the game is too fucked for humans to play. :(
---
Now that you're correctly using paste... Make sure you turn off "auto reload" on the saar. If you do not, when it is out of paste it will stop running and reload. This is bad, you want it to keep repping if you're mid-fight.
---
Wait, who is this guy? This is hilarious!   
---
Well done.
---
No sorry, the correct answer was a bacon cheeseburger.  It was good too.
---
not being funny, but if you can't earn enough isk to plex your accounts when you have 4 omegas at your disposal. either you're doing something horrifically wrong, or you don't really have enough time to play so i wouldn't worry about it.
---
Can loki field drones?

"I dont want a large Farva, I want a goddamn liter of cola!"

Great movie :3
---
EQ made the provibloc pre-PL invasion.  
---
He also made provi bloc what it is today, a shadow of its former self, with multiple entities in the region that used to be part of provi but now fight against CVA...  
---
Cause CVA isn't exactly good at making friends....
---
It’s not like any other form of income has increased either. 
---
You can either rat more, rat in higher class holes with a higher isk/hr, or switch to something that requires fewer accounts. But everyone in the game who has been plexing themselves is feeling this, and there’s really nothing anyone can do about it.
---
I understand where you are coming from, but I'd recommend looking at the bigger picture:
---
What other forms of entertainment are you interested in for $45 a month? I mean, that's *significantly* less than, say, one cinema movie a week. That's nine pints a month. That's noticeably less than the average American coffee budget.
---
If you're trying to balance things out, perhaps spending 15 or 30 a month and plexing the rest is more reasonable?
---
yeahp  
---
works  
---
I play from some pretty remote locations sometimes. Pings arent stellar...but get me by.
---
Have done it, can confirm it works fine.  Your experience may vary greatly and in direct conjunction with your cell signal quality.
---
&gt;If adapting is getting 7 rorquals and living in delve or just botting supers than I'm happy to die...
---
this is why the adapt or die narrative is cancer
---
it's basically "hehe play the shitty way or quit, no un-opinions allowed"
---
Maybe I am.  From the responses I'm getting unless I am multiboxing VNIs or Rorqs I shouldn't be playing. Maybe Eve has just outgrown me.
---
&gt;And yes I understand plenty of people will be like "dont be a cheap ass" or "things in life aren't free". But I feel expecting not to pay more than 30$ a month for a game is beyond reasonable.
---
Event doesn't cost more than $15 a month for an account. If you choose to buy more of any given product, it costs the same amount.
---
So if you want to run 4 accounts. You're buying eve 4 times. So no, it's an unreasonable expectation that with 2 accounts you're suddenly entitled to not spending more.
---
Wormholer crying about income, isn't where you can get "billion/hour" ?
---
you got 3 account right ? So you can run a nestor fleet and clean C5 space easily
---
hot cum
---
oh fuck off. This looks fun
---
Is this the activation of a ls gate to stain?
---
I'm back playing again because Abyssals are fun and easy to get into. 
---
Players numbers will rise when there's fun and easy ways to get into this monster of a game.
---
yfw CCP fixes the krabbing and botting issue with dangerous NPCs that don't show up in local chat
---
:thinking:
---
&gt;but I'm genuinely curious where your vitriol comes from
---
the last couple of attempts at meaningful pve from CCP were total failures
---
maybe it has?
---
i won't lie to you, even though my 1 omega is sustaining himself - it's literally break even. if plex keeps going higher i'm really going to consider if I'm investing enough hours in to the game to make it worth it.
---
I do and it works perfectly most of the time. Though I make it a habit to cycle airplane mode so it’s fresh connection whenever I start a session. I’ve had to DC every now and then.
---
Personally I don't quite see supers as being the end all be all of botting. They're way too expensive and easy to catch for their income unless someone is actively watching it, making sure nobody is hunting it.
---
Yea, so lets play through that.  They release some SoE ships that are either existing ones (lolwhy?) or new ones (yay powercreep).  Are you telling me this guy was going to sell 100's of Soct ships between the announcement and now?  What kind of idiot specs on limited issue ships for 1year?
---
Oh you're one of those 4chan neckbeards, that explains a lot
---
Well I would say the accessibility of capitals becoming common place and cheap has been the cause of the inflation if I were the guess.  
---
If you can rat or mine at any scale in complete safety in your area of null, the scale at which your willing to buy plex for various reasons increase as well.  Other areas of gameplay cannot keep up.
---
In less than 48 hours, with sleep, he got 32 kills with the same Retribution. That streak ended yesterday.
---
On another note as far as guns go you want to have skills for t2 asap! So dont focus too much on meta guns especially since some tip end meta cost more than t2, quite a bit more.
---
Other mods like webs, scrams, afternurners due to fitting restrictions you will often need to use meta mods rather than t2 but luckiky those are reasonably priced.
---
I think its reasonable to expect of anyone who wants to shit out 5x the hull cost in weapons.
---
you're being horribly inefficient with income generation
---
you can make a few hundred per hour per character in either 3s or 5s out of a static, like 6-10 hours a month gets you plexed easy
---
They had this type of PvE it was called drone poo, and they still botted. Next.
---
Then buy your own caps and rat in C5 space with them. They’re cheaper for everyone, including wormholers.
---
Its almost like a perfect counter trap-bait combo should work when executed well?
---
IKR, and the menace is about to get a whole lot worse...just sayin
---
lmaooo triggered libtard
---
I see them all the time, never once did i put a space in their ticker \[WERMT\]. I have refereed to them on comms as "Wermt" (pronounced similar to Kermit).
---
Don't even need to reset null, you would just need to force large swathes of it to move. Make one of the empires expand into a section of null. Make Trigs overwhelm a region. Throwing things in like this to upset equilibrium would really make a difference.
---
I am saving up for some important stuff like a downpayment on a home and stuff.  I go to the movies about once a year, I eat out once every 3 months or so(talking fast food costs here) and I don't drink, smoke, or in otherwise spend more than a meager amount on games per year. 
---
540$ a year in eve sub just isn't in the cards.

He had accumulated an absurd amount of isk, like trillions
---
The marauder is the only ship that makes me wish lowsec had cyno jammers.
---
Yea I did that just before I quit. I live in a C4 for pvp purposes and having to keep 2 of my toons in a separate farm hole just for isk defeated the purpose of having my 3 accounts.  I lost interest and stopped playing.
---
Yeh a soft reset is what I'd like.
---
Have the trigs invade, blow up stations and do a resource shuffle
---
If you want to fly blaster ships still I would just bait, sit in plexes at 0 and wait with a scram/web and once an unsuspecting frigate pops into your Plex just lock em down and boom.
---
daily reminder that the price history doesn't show fulfilled orders. only placed orders.
---
To be fair, that's always been the case.  That said, EQ is probably the grouchiest alliance executor I've met in EVE, and that's quite an accomplishment.
---
My favourite ship is the succubus, but it seems like people are more willing to engage a garmur...
---
In that case, I don't think there's much recourse. You can adjust your playstyle and reduce your number of accounts, or go alpha, or simply find another form of entertainment.
---
The problem with adjusting player incomes is that it won't solve this issue. The more players make, the more PLEX prices will rise.
---
Yeah, you are retarded as fuck. In a gank super speed is your tank. You don't need tank when nothing is shooting you. What the hell else do you want me to align to? You are definitely a grade-a retard. Only fuck up was not taking my drugs, and not starting the 2nd booster cycle asap.
---
Who are you and what shit are you doing?
---
You conveniently quoted this out of context, i answer this in the next paragraph...
---
Don't tell me you triple boxing EVE on a three-screen setup and don't know how to make enough isk to plex or have the RL financial ability to pay 40 bucks per month
---
I've used a hotspot with no issues.
---
Err, what is this nonsense? I believe you have your facts a bit twisted.
---
Nice ninja edit. Jump cap doesn't help when you have an orange timer. Again, tank does jackshit WHEN YOU AREN'T GETTING SHOT. Go be retarded somewhere else.
---
Im hyped this tri invasion thing will mix things up a bit, and the anniversary stuff is really nice too, also TunDraGon iz recruiting :D have a good weekend my dudes.
---
You don't need 3 or 4 accounts to enjoy Eve, even as a wormholer.
---
Wormholers, BTW?
---
extract your alts and plexing is like 300M per month.  done.
---
Depends on your network and your latency. I used my phone for a few weeks after my WNIC bit the dust, and I had no issues. I get between 70 and 90 MB/s down with about 80ms latency. Comms and gameplay were good to go.
---
Crap, my bad
---
If you want to catch CD's you have a scram.  
---
A standard retri fit does 4500m/s heated, vs the 36km heated point range of a dual web loki.  Webs help you to warp faster out of point range.
---
you can claim it retroactively, CCP specifically said so
---
obviously, you need to go omega before the event is over/before you get all rewards
---
I'm not a skin fanatic, but I do like this one
---
Looks like rmt to me
---
Ok, thank you
---
If you're using your phone, consider plugging in to your PC for a tethered connection. Android makes it easy, and for me anyway, (LG V30 both on Win 7 and Win 10), it just works.
---
The whole "die in 10 frigates" advice is about *being functional* in PVP, rather than actually learning it. It gives a critical mass of experience that allows the player to develop reflexes and get the commands down to muscle memory. The whole thing can be done with a few days of training, 80m ISK and another day or two to lose them all. From there, fly whatever you find the most fun tbh- if you have access to resources (people, ISK, logistics etc.) the path you lay down is more than viable imo.
---
My take would be that a new player should start out with destroyers rather than frigates. Frigates lack the muscle without skillpoints, and are much more vulnerable to tricky situations. Destroyers have bonuses that allow them to deal with such situations and 7-8 guns are going to dish out some damage no matter what. On top of that they are less demanding on APM and have a bit of extra EHP. They are usually a bit more costly than frigates, but some fits out there cost basically the same. One of them might get a killmark before going down.
---
So I've been trying that but cant seem to get it to work. The wifi works fine but it wont work tethered for some reason. I'm kind of dumb so I'm sure it's a simple fix.
---
How do you find fights? I’ve been trying FW and just get blown up by a 20 man fleet camping the gate as soon as I enter low sec
---
I wrote you a poem, its titled: I can't downvote you enough.
---
There is botting on the JITA undock
---
There is botting in supers
---
There is botting with people behind the wheel 
---
and botting with market futures.
---
There are bots for everything in eve.
---
And then there is YOU.
---
The white knight mouth breathers.
---
Always gaming to screw the believers. 
---
You say shit like, bots are "Really people".
---
Always trying to confuse them as legit.
---
Fuck you, you shit.
---
We're not sheeple.
---
But those who know, and those whom know better.
---
Know, everyone just thinks there ratters.
---
But what people don't see,
---
Is something we have no way of showing.
---
CCP can't stop all of this automating.
---
So I sit here on reddit doing the only fun thing left do,
---
Down voting you, you stupid fucking tool.
---
Don't know about the OP, but any ship I pilot is technically a 'noobship' ;)
---
(✿◕‿◕✿) love you guys (✿◕‿◕✿)
---
&gt; Overheat that shit.
---
&gt;  Saar should be treated as a delayed armor plate without a mass penalty that pays off over X seconds at the cost of a relatively small amount of cap. Using it after paste runs out is a bonus.
---
&gt; Heating it means you will get more hp out of your paste, and usually lowslot heat isn't bad to deal with (unlike mids). Meaning it's very unlikely that you will burn out your rep before you die. And if you get close. Just stop. Its not like you're going to get heat damage spreading from your other lowslots like you would with point/web/prop.
---
&gt; I recommend trying to ride in low armor pulsing your rep. Try to make the other guy think he has a chance. That will make people less likely to attempt to bail a fight that you're winning.
---
lol don't scratch those mate, it's all good advice.  
---
and yeah, basically the reason you don't care about cap is mostly the fact that fights end really quickly.
---
I was more making fun of the cap issue, relax guy.
---
Yes
---
Oh shit, we're doomed .... :-P
---
Sorry mate I'm on edge I'm waiting to hear back from a job I interviewed at that I really want. Alas, it wasn't a kill :(
---
If the Trigs win an invasion the gate gets cut off. To take it back you have to sneak in through a wormhole then blow up the cyno jammer so your friends can hotdrop in. You get extra rewards for doing it in a Tempest.
---
Yea my bad, ive been trolling reddit the last few days pretty hard.
---
You can use an program to monitor your data usage down to the application specific level.
---
NetLimiter is one I know of that doesn't seem too shady. Its primarily meant for stopping excessive bandwidth usage but I think thats only available during its trial period or by purchasing a license. Unlicensed it still tracks data usage and over the last 2 years of since installing Netlimiter the Eve Exefile has used about 14 GB of data.
---
That's for the actual gameplay. Not client updates (those are tracked via the Launcher which has downloaded 61 GB over the same time period).
---
TBF that's pretty on brand for someone named "Wallymarts"
---
And also delete local while they're at it
---
I've played tethered off my phone before. Seeing as i'm in america there was no appreciable ping increase as it was already kinda high. It didn't take too much data but i also didn't try it in a large fleet setting either just doing some explo and ratting.
---
besides every form of income that scales with the economy
---
which is everything that isn't ratting
---
Glad I was able to trigger you. Way to be predictable.
---
As long as you log in 16 days you will have until the event ends on the 20th i believe it was to get omega to claim the omega rewards.
---
Wallet warrior master race! :Muscle:
---
*sharpens pitchfork* kill OP
---
Do you Plex to play or Plex to skill? If you Plex to play then sp farming is litterally the solution to your issues.
---
If you Plex to skill then.... That's Gunna cost ya.
---
this has to be bait, it's not possible
---
At the rate EVE has been "dying" it has a lot more than a death rattle left in it.
---
why not just use the campus wifi?
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Haltwhistle_Industries
---
They have changed the sites themselves to change their income in j space.
---
The blue loot is static but the amount of it changed. So to say they've not changed is wrong.
---
It's still the best isk you can make but it's also finite unlike the infinite income in null.
---
more like SPVG5 amirite
---
lost it at the Abyssal Gyros :D
---
well done, one day i hope i'll farm null scrubs with the same efficiency you demonstrate
---
time to extract all sp for rmt

Inb4 literally just a reaper

Why does it seem like his drones are being controlled by something else? It looks like he's Mashing F to keep the drones on the redeemer because they keep idling and then sending themselves after one of the bombers.
---
Don't be discouraged, its not uncommon to go 0/20 starting out in solo frigate pvp.
---
Everyone experienced knows if you are a fight they can likely win or not based on your respective ships.  Takes a little time (and often research) to get used to other ships common fits, engagement ranges, tank, resist holes, ect.
---
get t2 guns, and get at least caldari navy antimatter rather than t1 ammo
---
Like I said, I understand CCP makes mistakes, but why the shit attitude and absolutely disgusting comments?
---
I realize I sound all "peace and love, peace and love" here but I just can't wrap my head around the idea/thought process of spewing useless comments like that.
---
I don't feel it's out of context. Even with the next paragraph it doesn't change my opinion.
---
It's always  nice when they web you into warp
---
Dont worry guys! Minerva "Immensea Sky Captain" "king of the warped renters" will save you all..... Does he even exist?
---
I personally would advocate for the 12 month sub, as it comes out to less than 15 dollars per month.   
---
And also, you probably earn more ISK per hour from your job in USD than you would grinding to buy plex (just spend real life money unless youre extremely poor, and in that case why are you trying to play EVE for free)
---
your formation is WAY off....
---
I prefer his insane last stand with his dread: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e7yCBPgQLY
---
And on a final note, as I picked up the titan from the Sotiyo I forgot to check and see if the fuel it was contracted with was in the ship or in the hangar. Made the one-way undock with my topes still inside the station, and was stuck on the undock for half an hour until a corp mate could pick them up and drop them into my ship. EVE changes, but damn idiots like me stay the same, hahaha
---
Erm... I don't think it works like that...
---
Not at all lol
---
I know people who spend in excess of $45 a week on cigarettes alone. You spending that much on a hobby per month shouldn't be alarming unless your family budget is so weak that you can't support that kind of thing. In which case you are probably living hand to mouth working 3 jobs paycheck to paycheck and don't have time to play anyway.
---
$45 a month is a cheap hobby compared to say playing a CCG, playing a miniatures game like warhammer, or even a more traditional hobby like woodworking or owning a boat and fishing.
---
Intact armor plate prices, at least,  have been fairly constant despite the plex price increase. And since ship prices are also constant, I don’t think mining changed all that much either
---
well i would suggest you find an item (maybe a piece of carbon) find a market (jita) list the carbon for 40,000 isk and the observe the price history.
---
that's a fucking good one indeed
---
I thought "Warp Core Stabilisers" made your ship go faster for the first week :(
---
how is calling ccp's usual pve additions dogshit equal an 'absolutely disgusting comment'?
---
Geminate is absolutely the best content garden for this kind of shit
---
He was asking what he had not what you had.
---
Both is a valid option.
---
You need to have a play on pyfa my dude, this is a basic tier question you can answer on your own.
---
Short answer, yes.
---
Why are you killing incursion belt rats?
---
If grinding for plex becomes an issue just skill farm your extra accounts. Even lazy skill farming with just a good remap and +2 or +3 when you’re out pvping and a +5 clone home will bring the costs of maintaining omega down to a couple hundred mil isk without tryharding to much.
---
&gt;TL;DR: I wasted my entire young adult life playing a videogame,
---
Oh it could have been much,* much*, worse....
---
Good Job! I'll recommend to your teacher that you skip 4th grade english next year and go straight to 5th grade. You're progressing very well bud!
---
I mean Mokey must be kicking himself, we got it for a steal considering he built it in a fortizar with 0 indy bonuses so cost a tonne more in minerals to build, "but hey hes going to run an alliance"
---
If you didn't have a 2nd helping you wouldn't be so salty right now.
---
you can't anchor them, but you can drop and use them in space. Only the secure containers can me anchored though.
---
Kind of, you just drop it and it'll sit in space for 30 days from the last time it was interacted with. I have freight containers in my pos for storing things.
---
its been a slow start i'll give you that, but hopefully the pace picks up a little soon :)
---
probably when PL PH NC Skill u and all the other shitgobblers go home
---
Yea, omega rewards will be retroactive.
---
Not sure what brs you have been looking at mate but nc. Have been there like 3 times, it have mostly been legacy vs winter
---
huh
---
Please give my sincerest thanks to everyone. Despite the constant "eve is dying" threads, I really think yall are doing a great job in both listening to the playerbase to implement needed changes, and providing interesting and unique new content. I'm really looking forward to the new trig ships and incursions. So thanks for all that and for putting up with us.
---
well, since i was there, not the whole "truth" to things. but ah well.
---
Congrats nerd.
---
ah shit that's it im joining test
---
Cool. Do they still disappear after 2 hours?
---
Leaves to join an enemy force
---
Gets marked KOS by previous allies
---
Surprised pikachu face
---
Nice story dude, and congrats on your first titan!
---
I like this format better than the AT
---
Thanks. Same applies to Station Containers, right?
---
you are way to busy to do much all at all
---
thanks jin :) I still ♥ u.
---
Thanks for the dope track \o/
---
The cool thing about eve is how it parallels real life capitalism and as the cost of living skyrockets(plex) and the super rich get super richer(botting alliances) the amount of people who start to fall behind ramps up.
---
Eve has a serious problem with its economy. It should not be inflating at the rate it is of like 50%-70% per year. The amount of time required to make an extra 50% isk hasnt improved, unless you were already rich or you bot.
---
The one key difference is that you can always use real money to buy your way and the cost of eve is still the same. It just sucks for the people who grind for plex.
---
Eve's whole thing is 1 Server for all (Minus China). And why would we want to fracture the playerbase like that?
---
So many *cunts* in that channel
---
That's not the fit you are using
---
The only real issue is pvp. Especially when jumping through a gate and especially against UK players. When I used to use my 4g hotspot I was podded more then once just jumping a gate. Just depends on how well it behaves for you. If you hit your data cap I would just wait till you get home. Unlimited data doesn’t mean unlimited tower priority.
---
i bet my solo kills  is better then your whole killboard combined
---
Thanks, man! And lol..."first". Yea you have fun with that, I'm not going for #2, the first took 12 months and I'm not doing that again. :)
---
well takes time to build it back up. Filling it up with people like you would defiantly not be the way to go.
---
is that a good thing? i'm not that grumpy. i mean i don't talk about myself in the 3rd person like mitanni do i?
---
I have a mobile hotspot a few taps away in case the internet goes out during an abyss run. Nothing worse than losing a few bils to a few minutes of your router taking a dump on you.
---
I'm going to take this angle figure out how to make it into a desktop back ground. I need this.
---
"I dont like paying full price for my subscriptions, please validate my wrong opinions"
---
Is what I just read.
---
It would amarrian.
---
Tether your phone with a wire. I live in an RV and use my phone 90 percent of the time. Verizon unlimited, 4 characters, wormhole map, discord, and comms runs fine in performance Eve settings.
---
Yes you're correct, but it is no where near qhat it was in the past and unfortunately the null income is controlling that plex market, which in lies the issue.  
---
I mean ships have risen in price too significantly,(except for capitals ironically...which are rarely used in wormholes compared to kspace) it's just far worse than what it was.  
---
Wormhole gameplay was about high risk high reward, you had to fly really expeanive shit because you could only have a few people on field.  But now it takes so much more grinding to keep up that playstyle it becomes a race against an empty wallet.
---
I would imagine so but haven't tested them.
---
That's the thing about number formats, there isn't an "English" number format. Only regional ones.
---
Honestly pretty moving post you got here. I'm a college freshman and began back in 2011 when I was eleven years old. I did the same thing stuck without a PC to play the game on I binged the absolute fuck out of youtube videos and tutorials. When I got my own laptop later that year EVE was the first thing I downloaded. I remember I was ready to finally go premium and rode my bike to the local Hy-Vee to buy a prepaid Visa with the money I earned by doing chores and extra work around the house. It was awesome, I worked my way up to my first battle ship and thought I was hot shit. Until I wasn't and lost it in a level four. 
---
EVE has been a big part of my life since I never really had friends (homeschooled here). And the only social interaction was with my newfound Corp mates. I loved it, eve finally gave me everything I loved in a beautiful interactive package. I loved space, economics, and social games so this new found universe pretty much became a second life. 
---
Over these years EVE has given me some of my best friends and I'm finally going to my first EVE Vegas with some of them. The past 8 years has been unreal and I can't wait to see what the future has in store.
---
I hate my ping time enough on a west coast business line, I dont know if I could stand it on my mobile hotspot
---
Good take on it man.
---
Alright. Thank you!
---
You can't right click on it and "View contents"?
---
Agreed Welcome addition to the Family!! Those guys are fun to fight and now we can fight with them even better.
---
 *TL;DR: I wasted my entire young adult life playing a videogame, and contrary to what all of the grown ups said it was more worthwhile than I could have ever known.* 
---
 **"Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time."**
---
I find it funny that every ship that I have died in Abyssal space with (usually some cheap T1 Cruiser) besides one time that I ran the timer out, the rooms with Vedmaks are the ones that get me. I'm never really sure if focusing down the tackling frigates is the best move, or just trying to kill the high damage Vedmaks, I have to assume killing the Vedmaks first is the best move, since their damage keeps getting higher and higher as they keep shooting you, at least if they work the same as player flown ones.
---
There you go now you're getting it.
---
clear skies 3 plot coming straight to the game!
---
Nah man, better get started on getting a shield titan boyo ;)
---
Really similar to a lot of my story. I've played a lot of games and talked to a lot of people over the years, but EVE can really be something else. I've been to some meetups before and they can be an absolute blast.
---
Intact armor plates are about .5% of the income from Wb ratting. You get almost none, to the point where most wormholers wont even salvage most of the time.
---
Mining is the biggest thing that has changed.  It wasnt long ago that multiboxing a few barges brought in a decent income, now its 10 rorqs or you're wasting your time.
---
Can't wait. Pretty cool to see that people had the same obsession as I did when we were that young.
---
would love the max spool cap to be changed to increased spool acceleration :(
---
Sounds like they realized they were breaking from the staple principle of all HACs being range bonused.
---
Glad they realized that early on. Good job CCP.
---
This is why jita scamming is still a thing, because some dummy is going to sort descending by mistake
---
thats rigs you mong
---
Stomped by Legacy??? Say what??? Last time I checked you guys put those eagles to extinction :o
---
He meant an remote repair optimal range bonus ofc
---
you gotta be pretty retarded to still die to sf camp thats been around for years
---
how do people still fall for that shit
---
Dude was paid a whole $35.
---
This is exactly the point of my post, and maybe I should have been more concise and clear.  
---
If prices of items inflate, the game should be balancing for that. Even infrequent slight balance changes, but nothing has happened in years.
---
Are you suggesting that no one attempted to scam the market for over a month?  Just based on the numbers, I expect those are closed transactions.  It's highly more likely that only one person made the mistake of purchasing the scam in a month.
---
Why even post if you're going to be ignorant. 
---
I have one 8 year old dell monitor, one i bought for $170 4 years ago when I built my pc, and last year my family bought me a third as my big christmas gift.
---
This doesnt mean I have $540 a year to spend on eve accounts. 
---
This post isnt about money, it's about static drops not keeping up with inflation. Even slightly.
---
maybe with wallpaper engine it could be.
---
when you orbit, lower your speed if you going 2km you be hiting less put it to around 1/3 of you mwd speed. with that trry to orbit in or optimal range like 3km orbit with a speed of 900, when you orbit at close range it may change if your to close and going to fast so test it out. 
---
if your just hiting normal rats use normal ammo but if you going incurstion use navy ammo.
---
Gotcha. But how?
---
No, in asset safety wraps it doesn't let you. You can right click and simulate ship to get the fits, but it says it's an unfit reaper, no drones no cargo
---
also it seems triglavian controled systems get a system wide mining boost.
---
Indeed.  Welcome F-OFF
---
Tha is for the tip.
---
go home?  no one is deployed down there
---
If I take my citadel down in highsec, what's stopping someone from scooping it up when it unanchors even if I am sitting there ready to scoop it myself? Can someone ninja scoop if they are faster than me?
---
beautiful post brother. thank you as well :)
---
Keep in mind that the game runs on 1Hz ticks. I'm pretty sure you could even play via sattelite internet and barely notice a difference.
---
doubtful cuz you didnt linked ur kb so i guess there is nothing to be proud of
---
Yeah but they will get a suspect timer and you can blow them up.
---
You have misread or misunderstood my point. Also completly derailed the convo.
---
My original comment was directed at that dudes 'dogshit' comment, but also at the general negativity and hateful comments directed at CCP that plague this subreddit.
---
My comment replying to you was also a question directed at the original dogshit comment, and not implying that your comment was useless.
---
And your 'trigger' point is derailing the conversation away from what I actually wanted to talk about, which was a genuine question that I hoped to get a genuine answer.
---
I get that t1 ammo never breaks, but seriously? T1 ammo when you put purple mods on?
---
elite lowsec peveper who had hope once that test will be good enough to kill skillu, wont get rekt by horde and will be able to fight with fraternity on their own, but got disappointed 3 times ;/
---
or any rats tbh.
---
That's a neat idea, same damage potential as t1 but it gets there quicker.
---
the AT ships have that, let's not take their only amazing bonus
---
I *think* that using sebos (as opposed to NSA) you will never not be at jump cap. So long as you’re not braindead and have a cyno alt, if anything even lands on grid with you, jump out.
---
they were jamming his drones so they go nuts
---
MuayThaiKrav brings up a fair point, but does it abrasively in a way that detracts from an otherwise well-intended message. Not everyone values tact, but there's still wisdom in the words.
---
I went through several cycles of HS Corps and found myself bored and quitting EVE multiple times before I finally went into null gameplay where I've yet to quit or even go inactive. HS gameplay will get dull, but at a different speed for everyone. Just enjoy the game however suits you best, but be open minded and ready to move on to the next thing to avoid burn-out. Also, as long as you're in a decent null Corp the difference in your earnings will be substantial to say the least.
---
If I could do it all over, I would have moved to null sec much earlier.
---
[https://i.vgy.me/fDLmbl.png](https://i.vgy.me/fDLmbl.png)
---
Is this what you call a slow start?
---
Instant destruction seems a bit overboard, but I'd be ok if it started taking damage at a slow rate that will destroy the structure if you don't fuel it within a few days.
---
we're going to find out that the Traglavians are actually led by John Rourke and crew and they're returning
---
Dear CCP Rise:
---
Include bonus to damage increase per cycle with maximum damage increase. This fixes the Ikitursa. You need do nothing else. 
---
Yours truly, 
---
Trigonometry Dudes
---
100% agree . I remember the day he put it up, was literally in shock watching it lol and everyone was talking about it
---
incursion rats arent really made to be fought in destroyers. or fought at all outside of the designated incursion sites.
---
The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world
---
I've played with wifi hotspot for years and havent had any problems with 4G. Just recently swapped to an ordinary pc &amp; cable setup. 
---
I travel quite a bit therefore my wifi/ travelling tips are: 1) own wifi hotspot usually is the best. 2) Doing pvp in airplane wifi is terrible, but playing around on jita market is fine 3) train wifi is the worst and you should rather fly than go by train if you wish to use wifi while travelling
---
Have your well-deserved upvote o7
---
ngl i forgot they existed
---
Anyone able to list / imgur the stats for those of us at work? Thanks many times.
---
Is this the new local drop?!? Frat can't compete with that hotness
---
Yes I play on the bus sometimes with mobile data. Only for market trading but it does the job.
---
Garunteed it's only for situation where after downtime you are the first through a gate and get met with an offline error message
---
Haha that’s how it always goes with a new shiny cap ) Stick to tradition eh! Grats on your new Titan, now pls use it to go to war with test/mango 🔥
---
r/woosh
---
well. I'll give you the basic outline, but you have to promise not to tell anyone else. okay?
---
Aralis came back to CVA a little over a year ago, but came back as basically just a line member, not a ceo or dir or exec or anything on that level. But, over time, as generally all type -a personalities/leaders are, they tend to gravitate to wanting to run a corp, or having a say in corp direction/policies/alliance decisions/ etc.
---
I think that ultimately he wanted to run a corp again and the main issue to that was that imperial dreams (his corp) had a current ceo that was running things (maybe not to aralis' liking but he was active and playing and aware of things and doing things) . So, Aralis decided he wanted to start a new corp, and told us, (me, his current corp leadership) and we were fine with it (understanding that he wants to run things cause he always has that play style). The issue was ofc that there are and is several assets in corp that he gave to the corp when he left initially (t2 bpos and other things) and I think that he was worried that he wouldn't be able to get his assets "back" to him, Even without Me saying that wouldn't be the case. As he had shares from when he was ceo before, he decided his only course of action was to try to take the corp and get his assets back. Ofc Current ceo has shares /ceo before (active director) had shares so it wasn't a huge issue to stop, but the damage has /had already been struck ofc in terms of "trust" in so much as things are in eve. So he was kicked a few days earlier than he wanted to initially wanted to leave. ( so that he could get the full 16 years in).
---
Anyways Still in the process of sorting his things out, what he wants do do going forward, if he wants to come into cva as this new corp (which has gotten issues cause of the attempted takeover, so ofc there is that to work through). That being said, anything that is his is getting worked out (with any separation it takes time to sort though everything and move to new things) so hopefully we can ofc still be freinds even after this "divorce" as it were.
---
Ultimately Aralis is My EvE dad. I love him. I look up to him. And i know that he isn't a perfect person just as much as i am not. The 1st thing I posted on our current forums was his talk to us about where CVA was at the time, where we were going, what we should strive to be. Everything I've ever done was with what would he do mindset, which if i'm honest, is always going to be something that isn't exactly what he would want to do or want to have done. In fact part of what Jin as said about direction and goals and hindrances i suppose we put on ourselves is in direct relation to how Aralis wanted CVA and providence to be. Why I've so stubbornly stuck to things, probably is a tribute to what i think of Aralis and how he lead and his vision to things.  
---
Hopefully we can work all this out and be back to things as best as we can be. Its always going to be a thing that people worry and people care about each other and things don't always go the way that they should or the way that they plan, but if they want to work them out they can and do. I always want people to enjoy eve, and I hope that Aralis does find that enjoyment in it. We play with some people, for 10-15 years. I have freinds in this game, people i've never met that honestly have changed my life (for good or bad) and have had good talks with. We can't always be on the same page with regards to thinks, we will always make mistakes,misjudgments, misdeeds, and misteps. But we should always be willing to work with each other to fix things if they are able to be fixed.
---

Thats the Long version of what happened.

At the end of the day just would like everyone to remember to be nice to one another, even if they are you enemies.
---
&gt; The right man...in the wro-ng place... can make aaaall the diff-e-rence... in the *world*.

FTFY
---
a bacon cheeseburger!
---
Worth every penny.
---
You need t2 guns for the Hecate (and most t3ds) to shine. Also get all the relevant skills as high as possible, and maybe invest in some bling and implants if you can afford it.
---
I mean compared to being unable to warp away due to being scrammed, yes, technically.
---
I'm west coast too... I just played for about an hour testing it out through hotspot and it seemed to work fine.
---
So it is a bit more complicated. In wormholes, little is the difference between a regular anomaly and a scannable site, you scan anyways to check wh connections and such. These wh sites differ a lot in payouts, and that mostly depends on the wh's class. They can contain 12m or multiple hundreds of millions.
---
Nullsec has an infinite supply of anomalies with no overhead time sinks (you can start doing them instantly, without scanning the whole system's 20 signatures, and they give instant isk), but a single anomaly contains a smaller amount of isk than most wh sites.
---
Forget high and lowsec sites, if you are not hunting the runners themselves.
---
&gt;My comment replying to you was also a question directed at the original dogshit comment, and not implying that your comment was useless.
---
never stated
---
&gt;And your 'trigger' point is derailing the conversation away from what I actually wanted to talk about, which was a genuine question that I hoped to get a genuine answer.
---
my response is an answer- it's not nearly as you make it out to be.
---
Oh ok. Interesting.
---
What a mystery.
---
You're right it'll work just fine, ping isnt really that huge a deal. I'm just bitchy
---
Good, now give the Draugur (command destroyer) some velocity. It's ridiculously slow which breaks from the trend of trig ships and makes it rather useless. 
---
For reference with a 400mm plate, link bonuses, and a MWD the Pontifex goes 2900 m/s while the Draugur only hits 1800.
---
I mined on 21 accounts on a hotspot didnt use that much data back then i think 2015. Im so happy im not stuck in an old ass em0ty building anymore.
---
Done this for half a decade at work. Never had a problem.
---
With a 700ish mil hac/gila i can reliably run t3 filaments if i want to do something that's engaging without to much risk and can run t4 filaments if i want something that has the potential to be challenging and risky. This has made pve enjoyable and profitable enough that i don't spend time grinding isk and spend more of it in spectre fleets or helping friends fight in low sec. 
---
Abyssal space is probably the best addition to the game for me as a player since citadels could insta-swap clones without a cooldown.
---
Plates drop from exploration. 
---
Mining with a ton of alts is possible, but before now those would have been hulks. Less annoying to kill but also easier to replace, and they’d still scale easier than anything else. 
---
Whatever you did in the past, you need to do more of it now to plex yourself. More mining alts, more mining alts, more time exploring, and also more wormhole ratting.
---
I second Neocom II, serves most of my needs. The only thing I ever had issues with was importing and exporting fits, but really, it's very rare to do this on a phone.
---
So far it appears they will take over highsec systems from the empires. No indication yet that they’ll have any effect on null SOV.
---
So I should focus on Wormhole anomalies then, im only at a tier 2 cruiser level. I have a zealot with around 450 dps... think thats enough to handle these sites?
---
" Branch with **6.265 billion**, also the region of the big vni-farms? - Not really, mostly supers like delve "   
---
I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you haven't set foot in branch for a really long time if at all. Its VNI's for days there some times 5 or more in a single system just running sites non-stop.
---
If your running Nestor’s with your Alts they can run them fine as alphas. I have my main omega on my main computer and my alt in a Nestor on the laptop. The only thing you miss out on is the MJD. 
---
I think your trying to live solo in j-Space. Maybe consider joining a wormhole Corp where you won’t need 4 accounts all the time?
---
Nah, I don't buy that you're dumb.
---
On my phone, whenever I plug in to my PC, I get a notification for USB Connected. I can tap on that and get all kinds of options, one of which is tethering. It's supposed to be plug and play - select tethering, tap Done, and in a few seconds, packets are flowing.
---
If that doesn't work, it's not user error, and there's something else messed up.
---
why don't you try both and find out?
---
Thanks! I worked hard on it
---
Haha thanks my man
---
Is there any sort of indicator on the station that it is being taken down to the public eye? If so, it sounds like this might be a pretty common occurrence?
---
So it would only take 300 VNI bots to get to Delve levels....huh. Time to put my tin foil hat on.
---
I've played in the AT on a 5 year old laptop tethered to my phone, you'll be fine. If you have really bad service you might see the game "skip" server ticks every now and then but overall EVE is very tolerant of poor internet connections
---
your zealot will be killed in glorious pvp but you can probably do c3 sites with it
---
Surprised the volume isnt higher from all the injector farms starting up again with the free SP. I know I renewed all my 5m SP accounts this month
---
this is really eve.mp4
---
Okay grandpa these days we have *google* and *alexa* do you really think we're gonna waste valuable time when we can literally just ask?
---
You can walk uphill both ways in the snow, we'll take an uber.
---
But the power grid reduction allowing the cruiser to use medium neuts,is super good :(
---
I don't think so, but I don't know how long they do last. I know if you anchor them on a POS they last 30 from your last interaction, but I don't know their de-spawn time anywhere else.
---
if you are having a stroke please seek medical aid right away.
---
The only indicator is that is will say \[UNANCHORING\], much like they say \[LOW POWER\]. There is no indication of when it ill happen, only that it is in the process of doing so.
---
Thought their main thing was covert-capable (guess that's not amazing since lots of ships are)
---
doude
---
My favorite part about fighting destroyers in lowsec sites. Dual web pilots
---
I'd like to know too.
---
There is a significant difference between tracking enhancer and omni-directional tracking enhancer. For a long time I was using a vexor navy with a tracking enhancer  
---
I linked that fit as a ratting fit for probably the better part of a year before anyone said anything.
---
That means it is trying to preform form of 2 factor authentication. If you haven't specifically enabled it then check the email associated with the account, as CCP will send a confirmation email with a code any time you login to a new device. If there isn't one you should file a support ticket as this means 2 factor authentication is enables, but you don't have an authenticator app setup.
---
Yeah, you kinda have to adapt around such blergh-things in EVE. IF thats possible... Tried other forms of income? Other ways of turning your loot into ISK? Another location? A mix of the above?
---
When I first started I thought that implants were static. Scratched my head after getting podded wondering a few weeks later, hmm.. I wonder where my implants went? Soooo... i'd by more really expensive ones. God. Don't be an idiot like me.
---
Touche my friend... I find reddit too warm and bubbly and it's easy to get your point lost if only writing in a positive tone. I seek to find the middle ground of
---
Ie... "it's really cool you are in to eve and hi sec but" vs "hi sec is stupid...get gud".
---
I want OP to remember what I wrote and feel the abrasiveness is effective in making my comment memorable. 
---
One of my very first eye opening experiences on eve was when my hi sec corp let a known awoxer in (unbeknownst to me) and I lost all I had earned in my illustrious 4 week career.
---
That was a far more abrasive way to learn that my leadership was merely taking advantage of me when it appeared from my POV that they were far more experienced players really trying to help me prior to this incident.
---
Of course I dont expect anything I wrote to resonate until our friend op has their aha moment but maybe just maybe... they will remember what I said and give eve a "second chance" so to speak.
---
Keep in mind that a small percentage of my roams are so good. Don't get discouraged if you lose a lot of ships!

Society thinks otherwise sadly...

Man don't you know? 104 accounts is the in thing to do. Your expected to have no life these days. I can't even fly a super because I don't have 3 extra dedicated accounts. Fml
---
For a dying game EVE sure seems to be doing pretty well.
---
At this rate it won't matter when it finally dies because we'll have EVE IRL at that point.
---
Inject much?
---
It's only cowardly to warp out, when others do it.
---
I don't like where this is going...
---
If you want to get into running wormhole sites seriously you'll want 2 (or more) Rattlesnakes or Nestors. Rattles can be really low SP. This setup typically brings in 0.5 -&gt; 1b per hour (depending how and if you value killing the drifter).
---
If you just want to dip your toes in wormholes to learn how everything works you can run C2 sites in a Retribution, or really any reasonably tanked ab cruiser, but don't expect huge payouts. Really useful for learning!
---
You'll want to learn how to roll and close your holes, giving you the ability to rat in relative safety for a few hours.
---
Use this as a guideline for the ISK to expect, and to learn what to shoot. Keep in mind low class sites often have a fair share of the sites ISK tied up in salvage, so isn't accurately represented.

Your other comment got lots of hate because you were a complete douchebag about it. You also ignored that the OP was learning in FW and not 0.0  
---
Yes, cruisers are great to learn with, in 0.0, with a small gang. Also, a caracal is far cheaper and almost as effective as an OsNav; an Omen Navy is going to get fucked by a ramjag by itself, but is managable with a group that has screening support.
---
In FW lowsec, the best method to learn is to a) be engageable (so cancer like garmurs and worms are a bad idea to start with), and be cheap (t1 frigates with T2 fittings). This gets you loads of fights and lots of experience in not only piloting but also module and capacitor management, situational awareness, land navigation (knowing popular systems, learning staging systems, etc.), all while costing very little, relatively speaking.
---
Hopefully the system-wide mining bonuses given by Triglavian incursions have a significant drawback, such as Sleeper-tier waves of Triglavians attacking sites every 10 minutes.
---
Major Riven is still a huge part of the Corp. He just doesn't have time for all the CEO work.
---
but wut about the capital :thinking:
---
Yeah. I hate CCP as much as the next guy but I usually wait to start getting upset with them until *after* they fuck something up.
---
Congrads!!!! You are one of the FEW who have WON EVE.
---
You mean Riven. He is still here :D
---
You guys do know you can just pop into a T1 as soon as the entanglement ends if anyone is camping you. Then just wait out the suspect flag in the T1 site in complete safety ???
---
I would call it the end result of years of dealing with providence diplomacy, but you are still pretty grumpy, let's be honest here. :D
---
Doesn't mean you are bad at what you do, and everyone else (Other than you) since Aralis only lasted, what a few months in the role?
---
Yes, yes, this is what we did totally.

I uninstalled months ago after 12 years. 😑
---
I live in the woods and play 7 accounts simultaneously via mobile hotspot with almost zero issues. Two things to be aware of:
---
1) being in a heavily trafficked area, especially during peak use times will slow you down, ESPECIALLY if
---
2) you’ve hit your data cap. No carriers offer truly unlimited data. My ATT plan caps at 20GB on “unlimited” (for example) at which time you get downgraded to low priority. Not an issue if you’re the only one on the cell tower, but will 100% lag out gameplay if you’re in a heavy use area.

Do I get a FAT link for this? Is anyone online who can give me a FAT link?
---
There's definitely a middle ground, you live in low class so you're probably krabbing your static, but setting up an astra farm in a random c5 isn't that hard and will easily more than pay for the Plex for 4 accounts and any PvP expenses you have
---
I've noticed that EVE seems to randomly jumble the sorting, even if I have it sorted by price, when I initially open the market window. I usually have to click the price sort button before making a buy order.
---
Also, Multibuy seems to decide randomly which order to buy from, rather than buying from the cheapest order. I wonder how much ISK I've lost because of that...
---
Username checks out, given that I assume you know all this from experience...
---
Oops. Sorry been over 10 years
---
Agreed.
---
It's simple, we left due to leadership inactivity and lack of heart in Pvp. 
---
We plan on leaving as friendly and neutral as possible.
---
Old friends wanted to form an alliance, it just so happened they were in talks with joining winterco. 
---
So we go winterco with friends. 
---
We've turned cheek to most situations since we've announced leaving IOU. 
---
As far as attacking Evictus., what? This isn't our plan.
---
F-OFF has no reason to agress IOU unless defending themselves. 
---
Are we surprised about KoS, not really.
---
So taken it for what it is. 
---
As far as this post... LOL. Such twisted stories.

And OP, it is Evictus.

---
Whelp, the market for 16th anniversary alpha rewards will be abysmally unprofitable for the foreseeable future.

as opposed to players buying it to get the rewards from the log in event?

just take 2 seconds to think, jesus christ.
---
Your right. I wonder it Frat will let us rent our space.
---
Because us cutting-edge millennials know that contextual community information is even better than algorithmic information. Thus, the question is asked here.
---
Remote *Hull* repair bonus.
---
&gt;pretending this question hasn't been asked and archived multiple times in multiple places.
---
yeah, sure.
---
The log in event is just a few days old. I'm talking about the long-term increase in PLEX prices that we have seen in recent *months*.
---
It's really not null income, I haven't actually looked at the numbers but I'm pretty sure most price baskets haven't moved much (when compared to Plex). Extractors, injector farms and the ability to run dedicated alta "for free" on sp farming accounts are what's driving the increase in Plex cost
---
T1 prices have been going down due to mineral inflation from the chang a to rorq mining
---
T2 costs have changed as a result of a change to moon mining mechanics
---
Gas hacking products have mostly been on a long slow decline though, and there haven't been any big changes to their demand or supply.
---
The big price changes of the last couple years have been the result of CCP fuckery rather than market forces
---
Do you put plates on the Pontiac and Magus as well? Don't fly them much

Dead serious, if I whelp this thing in less then a month in UALX 2.0 electric boogaloo over in test space, I'm not even going to be mad.
---
540 a year on multiple hours of entertainment is cheap for the time I have put in.  For me it has worked out to about 18 cents an hour, yours might be 3x that much. Better than a movie by a long shot.
---
Entitlement.
---
For sure!
---
I guess we will find out when the world tour event kicks off tomorrow in Russia.
---
im really looking forward to this new triglavian content! even if its a copy paste of sanshas, i dont care.
---
You'll be mad but not about losing the ship.
---
Yeah it's a pretty edgy opinion to have
---
Only one word, if you fly gallente, go for hull tanking and look at riggs that called bulkheads and same for the low slot modules, blasters and hull tanking work most times if you pick equal target.
---
I've started to FC some small gang fleets, it's really fun and I love everyone who joins and has fun
---
I call dibs on the asteroid field between  Mars and Jupiter 😁
---
I was going to say, this sounds like a job for a hidden safe-logged super and a wormhole.
---
Yes, thinking all of society is a conspiracy is pretty damn edgy.
---
In just comparing my gameplay now to that of 5 years ago. It has changed a lot, but whatever.
---
I guess people here like the plex prices..
---
If they wanted to remove plex, they would just stop selling it and it will drain from the game.
---
You know what
---
Im 200% sure even the elitist pvper in eve
---
Still occsationally Forget to set auto reload off on their ancil repair
---
And watch their ship dying horribly.
---
Im like 500% sure
---
Alex Jones, Is that you?
---
Just make sure you “download everything” before.
---
Rise up proletariat. Seize the means of production.
---
I tried that but then they said I was "groping" or something.
---
\\¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
so you're discounting basically every economic indicator and saying if the gdp increase isn't matching it must be ccp removing the option that makes them more money than subs?
---
maybe a larger percentage of the total wealth is going into plex (for any reason) and that's why the math doesn't add up
---
I never said I was, lol. You may want to read closer hahaha
---
Just work 4 hours IRL and you can afford your two accounts, more isnt needed :D get friends, you dont need to do everything alone
---
I think it's is less that they're buying up the PLEX and more that they're restricting the supply compared to what we had when the prices were lower. We haven't had a good sale in a long time.
---
you mean the one that's caused by an ever increasing amount of uses for plex, and a complete lack of sales to increase supply?
---
like there are a myriad of more obvious and less retarded explanations than "ccp is buying all the plex".
---
As others already stated: In recent months we've seen multiple sales where PLEX is used/consumed but minimal sales on PLEX packages or PLEX itself.  
---
There are posts about PLEX prices quite frequently on r/eve and there are better explanations in those than I can write.
---
They are not real people anyway.
---
Sounds like a stand up guy.
---
You don't get what he's saying.
---
His theory is that CCP is happy to sell plex for $$, but buys it up in-game with ISK, to prevent players from using ingame ISK - and get frustrated and sub with $$.
---
Interesting thought.
---
This impacts me on another level.
---
Wtf kind of logic is this.
---
Im all for bang for you buck stuff with gaming but this simply doesnt add up.  
---
Maybe if eve is the only media you consume 100% then this almost makes sense but i dont spend 540$ a year on all my games total. And i spend even less for movies/tv and music.
---
If you just want to equate time enjoyed to $ then someone who listens to music constantly (work and home) should be able to justify 2000$ a year for spotify.  I mean how much is that? Half a cent an hour?  Reasonable.
---
I mean c'mon that's like naming a dog "Chaos" or something, names are self-fulfilling prophecies.
---
Your accounts should have 125m+ SP if you've had them for 5 years which is enough to pretty much fly every ship in the game, at least if you ignore things like jump drives (wormholer btw) and weapon spec V's. What kind of skill progression are you looking for?
---
It definitely does address the problem since you could pay your $12.95 sub on your main to train like normal, then spend about a billion a month on your remaining three accounts extracting to pay for plexes.
---
What would even be the point?
---
The "free" option is *not* free. Someone pays for the plex. In fact, it costs more than a one-month sub.
---
That's an CONCORD NPC corp that I'd assume is related to the upcoming expansion thing.
---
Please buy glass spheres and place them next to all your windows.

One *could*  read the description that way, I suppose.
---
exactly  ppl can keep thair torches and pitchforks in graping distance but give  ccp at least the chance to fuck up befor you guys riot
---
What's the practical benefit to a carrier over a dread?
---
The latter is a potentially a fair argument and is worth talking about if it stops you from buying actual spaceships to play the game in. Framing it as woe is me I can't afford to buy plex is not the way to do that.
---
How much data do you find you use doing that?
---
In 2 weeks I've used 3 gigs
---
That's not terrible
---
Yup I used it to FC a fleet when my router broke, no issues except for the bill, and even that wasn't huge - EVE doesn't use that much bandwidth from what I can tell.
---
Looking forward to alliance bookmarks coming into the game 
---
Hes a goon, they're not gonna fight test it would disrupt their safe farming too much.
---
Really? It just hit me on the ground floor
---
For fleets yeah. For solo because of the speed, saar is usually preferred.
---
I am not CCP and I can't dictate how the game goes. But if I had my way, yeah, we would be affected by it, whether we want to be or not. Because that's more like, well, life. My favorite EVE trailer was always the Butterfly Effect trailer, the idea that in this sandbox, anything can affect anyone and no one is immune to anything.
---
After all these years.. cloak v here I come!!!
---
My 0.02 isk, I don't think CCP will care about this kind of bots because they create an high demand of plex and injectors, for every plex anyone buy an other one pay real money to CCP, and they are happy about that.
---
More bot == more plex == more €€€
---
Hahaha, that's hilarious.
---
um pardon? I am personally too busy for what? I don't really understand what you are trying to communicate here.
---
Carriers can warp at will and have better application so they aren't stuck at the end of the site halfway through a siege cycle, resulting in at least the same ISK/hr as a dread.
---
There's also issues like being easy to catch while sieged etc.
---
When I watch his stream I always am in awe about how chilled, stone cold he is during an engagement. So damn calm under pressure.
---
I gave plenty of context to this. I find it reasonable to pay 15/30 a month for eve. I use 3 accounts. It worked in the past but is no longer sustainable as it once was.
---
I realize this does not affect everyone. It is my perspective and genuinely contributed to why I no longer play.  Earning enough to keep my guys moving became too much of a chore.
---
I dont know why I am being crucified for this.
---
Plex prices are 2.2 billion.  I dont see how I am completely missing the mark here, does everyone here want high plex prices?
---
I mean seriously, its a 100% valid opinion if you do. Im just on the other side of that coin.
---
Yeah do it all the time. I even solo/small gang pvp without any issues.
---
If the FC wasn't a literal Trump supporter who wasn't so autistic the only word he can think of to use every 4 seconds was "faggot" then the fleets might actually be fun.
---
But he is, he's not, and the fleets are complete shit.
---
You'll need to log in 16 times to unlock each alpha reward. As soon as you go Omega, the omega rewards for the unlocked days will become available. Did the same thing last time
---
Thanks!
---
Gosh I remember back the day my next neighbor friend spent like 4 weeks training for the harpy. I thought how ridiculous to do so, but he finally got it and just annihilated us in our t1 cruisers (I dont think BCs were in yet) by utilizing resistances and low sig radius.  Lol back when EC-P8R was like the wild west ans when 10 drones on each ship was normal lol. Those were the days !
---
Got myself a clean Astero. Will never forget the day I found out that Alphas will be able to fly an Astero. Started exploring in High Sec and stumbled upon a nice and shiny Data site. Started hacking. "Whooo, 16mil in a canister!!!"
---
"What are those weird NPCs that just spawned? Meh, will just warp o... CAPSULE EJECTED"
---
...turns out it was a Ghost Data site...

Cool. Do you think the recent NSA changes have changed this at all?

Do you think Pete would speak in chinese if I gav him the pronunciations and paid him more?
---
7o - glad you are having fun!
---
This brother gets it.
---
There is no "free option" you moron, someone is paying for that game time and you are buying it from them with isk.
---
In fact, I'm pretty sure that CCP makes more money from PLEX than from subs.
---
I admit for a time I struggled with how I was spending my life and the things I valued vs the things I didn't. Ultimately I came to the conclusion that we are all on the clock so do what you want provided no one else is suffering or going without.
---
Do you remember when the Loki was shit?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers
---
I get better peformance with a mobile hotspot than I do the average Hotel WIFI in the US.
---
Not gonna take anywhere near 60 days for me I'm not far off from any of the t3s and I plan on injecting to finish up the training. The reason for t3 is the modular design is highly appealing to me as a solo.
---
The current system just merges shield/armor on low power, so functionally the result is the same. 
---
The bigger issue is the TZ tanking that can still occur on the final timer if the structure is low power.
---
Look on the bright side, you currently don't play.
---
I feel like you're memeing and there's a ludicrous killmail I haven't seen yet...
---
I bet you eat your steaks with ketchup too you fucking animal

their popularity in groups that were actually good at using them like TRI was on its highest before that though im pretty sure.
---
I'm not sure I would recommend an arty thrasher for a new player tbh, you've got to be really on top of transversal with that fit. AC thrasher on the other hand is pretty braindead simple as long as you don't get kited.
---
And you pay for Spotify, don’t kids these days know how to pirate music properly.
---
Ah okay, so that makes it a lot harder for someone to know when to be online to contest it. Thanks!
---
IMO Tapi and goons should be permanently at war, for the health of the game.
---
#2 should always strive to be #1
---
Yes for a few days, it worked perfectly.
---
Make sure your connection is solid though, eve has big issues with short connection drops
---
This was a really really enjoyable video. Excellent fights and great use of memes. 10/10
---
I believe so but to be honest I haven't actually checked.    Someone said they now expire in October.
---
If you know anything about goons, you know that we enjoy a good reason to bash skulls. While I'd be disappointed if our diplomatic relations with TEST went sour (because they're pretty cool dudes), never say never as far as war is concerned.
---
&gt;But.. in the recent years, earning enough to plex has become a larger and larger chunk of my playtime. To the point where, in my last few months playing, I had nearly no money left over after spending 4.2 billion a month for plex.
---
EVE is supposed to be a game you play for your enjoyment. If you're not enjoying building up the cost of PLEX then perhaps you should try doing something else and paying for your account with real money.
---
Okay...so don't. I currently can't afford to spend more than $30 a month either, so I only PLEX two accounts. I used to get by just fine with just one. You don't *have* to Omega every account you own. This is something you're imposing on yourself, and then pretending as though the game is imposing it upon you.
---
&gt;And with an increase in accounts should come with an increase in potential income to help cover this style of play. This has been 100% true in the past.
---
And it still is.
---
&gt;Killing an sleeper battleship has the same worth now as it did when plexing an account was 500 mil for the month.
---
Okay. And? I'm pretty sure NPC bounties haven't changed either. And the reason why ISK has inflated over the years is because people got better at making it. I'd wager that you had to work just as hard to PLEX your account back when PLEX cost 500Mn/mo and it will be no more or less difficult if and when it costs 4Bn/mo.
---
&gt;I really hope CCP looks into this, I feel it's a genuine concern.
---
Okay. Let's say they increase the amount of ISK you get from selling blue loot to NPCs. Well, then the amount of ISK that is injected into the game by those NPCs will increase...which will reduce the value of ISK...which will increase the cost of PLEX. This is how you get runaway inflation.
---
&gt;I suppose I shouldn't have made this post. I wanted to simply post my perspective on something I felt needed some attention, but clearly the community in eve does not share my opinion.
---
Throwing yourself a pity party is not going to make us look upon you any more favourably, dude. And it's not a "difference of opinion", you are just straight-up wrong.
---
Make sure you check out Meta 4 modules. T1 should never be used Tbh they're completely worthless
---
Also, seems trig AF and HAC don't have good cap regen as their empire counterparts

Is this intended or still WIP?

Not a kid, I have kids.

If you're going to tinfoil, blame the multi-trillionaires who control 99% of the PLEX market.

Start an Occupy Jita protest. Eat free pizza. Get space herpes.

I'm pretty sure that dude is agreeing with you

I am glad you are not involved in game design.
---
it hit me on the train floor
---
No, I don't think they are.
---
However, if they wanted to drive the price of RMT Isk down to a point it doesn't make sense to RMT anymore, that would be one way to do it.
---

---
It is better with nanite paste in it. OP wasn't putting any paste in it and as such was always fighting at a disadvantage.
---
An offensive war doesnt require you to show up as the offense to timers. It does require the defensive team to show up to timers.
---
How do you do that without CCP playing favorites with who gets to lose their sov? Or are they just going to give them some npc null? Because the latter option seems like it wouldn't really shake anything up. I could maybe see a trig invasion where NPCs burn sov space and anyone who can't defend gets booted but honestly that probably means goons / PL and maybe test would be the only ones left? Assuming the trigs push hard enough to not just be laughed off as trivialized content.
---
Love the idea of them pushing into K-space and holding their own region. Can't see it feasibly happening though.
---
I am not glad the only remaining players would soon be useless krabs like you
---
VoiceoverPete is amazing

Voiceoverpete!
---
I think people are misunderstanding the purpose of these ships, they are a perfect counter for the massive cap spam that exists, the ability to ramp up damage over time makes them perfect cap killers, so yes these will be horrible in scenarios such as solo 1v1s and fighting other cruisers, but perfect for whaling and cap killing.
---
Got it man, everyone is ok with the plex prices. I didn't realize I was the outlier, Ive been away from the game some time. 
---
We can all drop it now. I've already dropped from the sub.
---
Thanks to everyone for answer me. Maybe This page will be good for newplayers.
---
What about the wormholes?
---
Gonna book me sum spod!
---
Because they use cap boosters, but on the other hand I believe they "repair" the same amount, right ?
---
Not a single person in the comments section has mentioned the god damned avocados...

But a wyvern doesn't really count as a super
---
Society can think whatever it likes, to be honest. Almost all of the fun I've ever had in my life was derived from not listening to expectations and norms, or occasionally outright breaking rules. As long as I can support myself and put food on the table, I'm just going to do what I want with my time. :)
---
Dual or triple web kinda solves that problem.
---
This is beautiful
---
You have to shoot through both HP stacks to get to hull with the current rules, I'm saying you shouldn't have to damage the shields at all, they just get set to zero when the structure enters low power mode.
---
Sucks to be you then.
---
It doesn't look like it's on Android but there is a simiral looking app with a lot of good reviews called eveanova.
---
No memes here. Sebo thanatos is fairly viable after the changes, and if you lose a little damage you can actually still run a little tank.
---
No doub, the only way to play eve.
---
dont triglavians need to mine? wink wink nudge nudge
---
Too true. They'll get all cuddely, stomp Sort et al, and give us the map wide blue donut we've all been dreaming of.
---
It isn't impossible.  CCP has proven repeatedly in the past to be less than honest about a lot of things.
---
Because the campus has basically everything blocked? - Not sure if you're in the UK or not, but college here still has alot of the standard school web filters that prevent usage of steam and most game launchers etc.
---
Username checks out.
---
Aye, when I used to do haw memes in college a few years back i rarely spent more than a few hundred mb of data running 2 accounts for a few hours,
---
Depends. A Heavy Pulse Legion can run C3 sleeper sites and has good damage application, even to frigs. You have to manage your tank a bit better, but if you're any good you can clear sites pretty fast. Tengu and Loki have a better tank for less ISK, but application of HAMS can mean it may take longer to kill the frigs and cruisers. Reload speed hurts overall dps as well
---
Sry to see you getting so much hate sometimes our community can be kinda toxic..
---
That being said.. Mayne you should rethink how you make isk?.  Ill admit I moved to null after capitals became op af, from a wh so I know the struggle..
---
Helps to be in the right class and style tho. A single hole can barely spawn enough isk even running 24/7 but grinding a static is infinite.. Get some t3s or even bcs and go clear a nabor c3 of their sites. A good run like this can yield a billion a day or billion a hole depending on luck and activity.
---
So I hear your issues.. But maybe try changing how you make isk.. Also PI is great and extracting unessential skills is a good plan. Subsidizing your plex with extractors is good to.. So take out two exts worth now your plex is cut in half.. There are ways around the rise in price..
---
It's not that "everyone is okay with the PLEX prices", it's that you need to HTFU.
---
correct, they flush your capacitor in doing so though  
---
also they are stronger than t2 boosters apparently
---
Huh. TIL.
---
I think (not certain) but jeveassets will tell you the contents of stuff in asset safety.
---
More likely RMT disguised as "scam"
---
Amen to that.
---
That's a great post. I too find joy in Eve Online, and it should always be said that the people you fly with and the times you have are intertwined. I am thankful for the game and especially the community - and not just my Imperial homies: I am not sorry about respecting and in some way loving my enemies for being good adversaries for many years. Theyre all part of it and it brings me joy.
---
y tho
---
But but but.. it’s so immersive!
---
Wait, now that I think about it, does this mean wormholes are now full of dockable stations, or are POSes still around?
---
With 3 mids?
---
Actually you are astonishingly correct.
---
You dont need to do that anywhere in eve.
---
upload something
---
You're brain dead. It was a group of wormholes and not a particularly large w space group.
---
Sorry you lost your marauder dude.
---
Sales of tinfoil have certainly increased.
---
Wait. I have a quote from comms for this.
---
EQ: That's fine.
---
That's not the point.  
---
A large alliance has individuals to cover every minute of a 24hour day to keep things running. A small alliance doesn't always have that ability. However, there are ways to prevent modules from off-lining with proper planning.
---
I mean it is probably one of the most recognizable opening scenes ever lol...
---
Err, Sort is a goon pet now too.
---
From 14 years of eve to your 4 years of eve - you are very welcome!   
---
And *yes, you are going to regret* the last phrase of yours in something like 10 years. :)   
---
Till then, fly safe, you beautiful goon.
---
bots can farm not only isks and can be supercarrier like ppl on them. what about bots in fw blitz mission for lp or procurers on ore?
---
Both, buuuut wormholes of you kill all the citadels in a hole, all the assets are dropped on the last kill, and you have a giant loot pinata
---
Abyssaleers, btw?
---
spod bless
---
And how are newer PvE games doing? Look at all the looter shooters, Destiny, the Division, all have poorly developed and repetitive PvE content. Having repetitive and easy to do PvE content is literally the core of any MMO game. OSRS, WoW, etc.
---
Lol nope the drones are worth more than the ship. You get those back or you die
---
Have you considered that 2000+ players are moving over and people know this, and are therefore hoarding the PLEX?
---
CCP is turning the frogs gay
---
its fineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee is more like it.
---
but yes.
---
You do know the HP was reduced so it's as if you were shooting through only one, right?
---
It's the same amount of effort as shooting through armor on a powered structure
---
You are being crucified because your argument is faulty. 
---
Inflation is only in PLEX. Ships etc arent inflated at all really, in fact they are pretty fucking cheap all around.
---
I'm not sure if you're trolling or just plain stupid. Making people go put effort and time into something that has literally zero reward is a punitive mechanic. I don't know about you, but I want the time I spend on EVE to actually be worth SOMETHING, otherwise I'll just go play something else. That's the exact opposite of intelligent game design.
---
No I don't.  I already quit months ago. I was sharing a hard contributing factor.
---
Bet lots of small guys would pick apart the big boys. There would be lots of reasons to fight the big boys.
---
Give it non gimped fitting, or do the obvious and roll the fitting bonus into their role bonuses? Two better solutions straight off the bat.
---
So since you like things in three what do you think of a three legged stool?
---
Stop lying we know how you really  feel.
---
He already told you, he owned a casino.
---
You of all people calling someone a douche bag are you serious? Wow you are so in denial!
---
Its not an argument. And it literally cannot be wrong. Its my opinion.
---
Plex went way up and a big part of my game was running with my 3 toons.  As I couldn't seem to keep up with plexing 1/2 of those toons I quit.
---
Could I completely change how I play? Sure. Will I? No, the game just isn't the same when I have to play a cpmpletely different way, and I cannot justify such a high monthly.
---
So it's literally impossible for my "arguement" to be wrong.  It a fucking opinion and fact about the choices I've made.
---
I dont understand how everyone is being so aggressive over my story and opinion saying it is wrong.
---
I jumped into a system from a WH earlier, 12 machs, a few domis and vnis on scan, managed to spring a wee trap on one and they didn't even register. I tried a different null exit, and was greating by a mass Gila farm..
---
Big words from a truck driver. You use you thesaurus for that one bro?
---
1) High demand low supply. Particularly "1m free SP" celebrations are best times for people to create hordes of alts for whatever purpose. I just made 45 myself. 
---
2) People have enough ISK to buy the supply times over. "Buy low sell high" price manipulation is easy money for people who already have trillions. As long as CCP doesn't take measures to prevent PLEX price manipulation the prices will increase at a greater rate than the supply/demand pushes.
---
In sharpshooter mode?
---
I think you should be a better person. I believe you need to stop your toxic behavior.
---
I too feel a slight pull to the dinoside after that fucking swag ass propoganda
---
Sounds like fucking dumb languages.
---
We have 1.500 billion dollars (1,500,000,000)
---
We also have 1.500 billion dollars (1,500,000,000,000)
---
See how the rest of the world is right, and your way of using a decimal is fucking dumb.
---
Probably why you guys lost the war
---
Pretty much a glass cannon
---
There you go using a comma instead of a period. You find a way to fuck up just about anything, dont you?! Lmao wow
---
Nice
---
This is true. To a point. Remember supply and demand. One of 2 things is happening. CCP is not seeding isk (it's not clear weather they ever did) that drives up the prices 
---
or. 
---
The Supply "people selling plex" is not meeting the demand "people buying plex" So "more" people are trying to sub for "free" then there are people selling purchase Plex from CCP.
---
So the "Free" option is in fact free for the people buying plex to sub, and there appears to be more of them then people "paying' to play.
---
Some of this is a wealth-concentration issue. Even multitrillionaires can't control much of the market because it's so big - it moves trillions *per day* and has tens of trillions stockpiled. 
---
In a lot of ways, that's the point; plex is the last reserve for people who have too much isk to invest anywhere else. But with the giant isk &amp; material influx since the rorq/carrier changes, there's more people in a position to actually impact this market, whereas previously the game's richest players would have trouble making an impact. So it's not surprising that in 2019 the plex market is more vulnerable to continual, hardcore manipulation, when its sheer size would've protected it in 2015. 
---
But yeah the real tinfoil here is CCP keeps doing things that jack up the plex price. First omega time sales, then new skins, then "sub all your acounts and buy 2 extractors for a free billion isk."
---
Awww.
---
It's sadly true actually... it made me sad in the pants when I heard that it was being built in an unrigged forti.  
---
But they learned a lot about indy since then in a short time... he'll do fine.
---
Vysh is great fun as an FC. Especially if you are on a fun fleet.
---
And I assume you have a plan on exactly how they could accomplish these things right? Because as an elite player surely you're capable of organizing thousands of pilots in a long drawn out skirmish against thousands of others on multiple fronts.
---
Tell me what it is you had in mind and I'll get with Sappo. I'm like a high command whisperer I'll be sure they get the message.
---
How do you waste 150 million isk? You should literally start with t1 frigs in the 5-10m, 15m range at most. It makes the learning experience much cheaper.
---
I too, second this notion.
---
I'm still waiting for my trig strat cruiser
---
&gt; thats rigs you mong 
---
I think you meant, "thats rigs you room temperature iq, troglodyte!"
---
did you happen to get the name of it?
---
dual rep ponti and magus reeeeeeee
---
&gt;  It's 50% free 50% not free.
---
So it's not free then?
---
Every plex on the market was paid for at some point. Whether or not the demand is higher than the supply is irrelevant. It's like using a gift card that was bought 3 years ago. It's free for the user, but not to CCP. That sub was bought and paid for long before it was used.
---
It is my understanding that CCP has never seeded plex, and even giveaway plex was confiscated from banned users. CCP has always made it a point to be as hands-off with their economy as possible.
---
I’m pretty sure you can do it after you get all the alpha rewards so long as the event is still active
---
fair point, I was mostly just happy with being able to fit medium neuts / smart bombs /rr on it. I think the role bonus option is the better idea, I haven't felt short of pwg on most fits I've put together in pyfa currently,. just giving it more pwg would end up with that being spent on other parts of the ship, 1600 plates etc. which I don't feel is needed and could even make it opressivley tanky.
---
Also I hadn't really considered that they might be talking about a gun range bonus, which imo is desperately needed, I'd just assumed the worst and thought the were referring to the utility highs for some dumb reason.
---
Grats
---
Halogen - U Got That
---
Some people are able to win at eve.
---
I do have an unnatural attraction to diapers and the people who love them, it's true.
---
I'm also starting to try and get more active in FC'ing my small alliances fleets. Its rough but always remember to set standards. Roams are fun and relaxed and what happens happens, strat ops later on when you have objectives are what matters, just always have fun and good hunting!
---
Yeah fuck that guy. When he bounced my RPG I was a bit miffed.
---
Yeah, that's pretty much part of the problem. I play this game to pvp. PVE is the most boring mind numbing bullshit imaginable in this game. If you give a good fight, half the time people will disappear after. Hell, just convo the other people and be like hey if we bring shit to fight you will you let this shit go? and half the time they'll probably do it. Some people are just looking for easy frags, but especially wormholers in my experience are just looking for fights and will leave your shit alone if you give it to them.
---
The dropping 40 supers shit is more just indicative that the game is ridiculously broken than anything. They've totally fucked the game beyond repair at this point, so eventually they're either going to do what they were talking about a few weeks back and do a fresh sp server with no skill trading etc, or they're just going to be left with a bunch of care bears who do nothing but mine all day till the game dies.
---
Defending your home by just bringing a bunch of dudes v0v we'll feather and do what we can to fight and get some frags, but capitals online is just a snorefest for me.
---
we'll see how long that lasts
---
Time to bust out he Vedhac!!
---
There are a few cancer frigates that deserve to be ganked by unlimited alts: garmurs, succubuses, comets, worms, and maybe a few others.
---
Just dont be the guy who uses those against lone rifters and atrons, being invincible is boring :D for everyone
---
&gt;So it's not free then?
---
It's neither.
---
You have to keep in mind that in CCPs perfect economic ecosystem. ISK would never be equal to RL dollars at any denomination unless you are RMTing which of course we are ignoring that metric because it's technically not supposed to exist.
---
The only reason we are able to designate a dollar value to ISK is because of the Plex metric that is available for RL dollars.
---
Supply and demand is absolutely the most important metric to assign and ISK value to Plex no matter when it was purchased.
---
The actual dollar value of Plex sold by CCP is outside of the EvE ecosystem. 
---
As a final note is is absolutely free for the person NOT paying RL dollars to sub.
---
It's is not free for the person paying RL dollars to supply that Plex. 
---
This is strictly speaking within the EvE economic ecosystem. They technically do not cancel eachother out as they are 2 different entities. So even is someone is paying for you to sub  does not mean that someone is not getting a free sub.
---
Triglavian rorq that uses a big ass mining laser and increases mining per cycle.   CCP is dumb enough to do it and then :pikachu: in 6 months when it breaks what is left of the economy.
---
You need to balance what's already in the game . 🙄
---
i want some of the stuff you are smoking
---
*I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THEM PUTTING FRENTIX IN THE WATER THAT TURNS THE FRIGGIN' SPOD GAY*
---
PLEX is the legit way to buy ISK.  $20 is getting more and more ISK in return.
---
At the moment, 1bil ISK is around $9 worth of PLEX.  It is around $5-7 RMT and this has hardly changed in recent months.
---
If the PLEX price on market keeps rising (ie. selling PLEX on market gives more ISK), it should have a marked impact on RMTers.  They will have to drop prices to $4, $3 or lower per bil.  At some point they will have to give up in favour of more lucrative MMOs.
---
In the meantime though, lots of alt accounts that always stayed Omega with ISK will slip to Alpha and stagnate.
---
Tinfoil:. I suspect the banning of bots has led to various price rises.  Various T2 components and mats such as Stront are rly rising.  As the market loses some of the large scale mining and ratting bot ops we're seeing the flow on effects.  I'm not sure how this would work with PLEX - they wouldn't pay much money, surely they would be using ISK for Omega.  Have so many bots been banned that their inevitable and immediate return has dried up so much PLEX perhaps...

The mystery of what was hidden in the 257m reaper. How this ended up here is still beyond me. But it's always nice to find 1.5b in BPOs. And to everyone who was following the story. thanks for the interest. &gt;.&gt;
---
reserving a whole class of bonus for ships that less than 100 people will ever fly, and maybe 1/10th that ever fly where their bonuses actually matter is retarded, sorry.

I may or may not have used a mobile hotspot to play during an Alliance Tournament.

I was in a Vulture. Full boost.

Never DC'd

And never told anyone till now.

What do you need 200M SP for in highsec?
---
Then != than.
---
Can I have my 53 seconds back please
---
&gt;It's alsways funny if you look at the numbers/facts, to see where the truth is.
---
Ah yes, because an alliance of around 4k players in a region making 2/3rds of the ISK that an alliance of around 33k players in another region is definitely a sign that VNI bots aren't a problem.
---
It's honestly a pretty neat approach if that's what they are doing. Give human players something to do (and make some good isk doing) while making the bots sit down and shut up.
---
i read it all and feels like me or for some reason i feel the same 
---
i heard about this game cause a friend  told me to and bring me a video about it  spent a wntire week downloading it and men  i haven´t stop playing  i keep coming back  every day i try to be  on it my corp mates are amazing my alliance  is fantastic i have done so many things  thanks to them i have so much fun also
---
i am not that old player like you just a year on eve  besides the country i play from is cuba so i have to  krab real life money just to be able to open the internet browser on my computer   20 minutes  1 hour  and try to do most i can  sometimes i feel lost   cause no money   to be able to buy some internet time and men    well  cannot  say with words exactly   but but i keep coming back  and keep coming back  eve  is not just a game is the friends  i made here  the comunity itselt   hope soon or later things with internet on cuba changes and can  be more time   to be there on every fleet on every gang laught with my corp mates the crazynes on  coms 6  i miss that every day when i woke up  having 2 field of battle it is not that easy  
---

enjoy it  fly it  drop it carefully  and  congrats again for your avatar  from another eve player  Cacique Yuhasz    o/

ProTip: right click and turn off the auto reload.
---
It will get you killed if the fight last longer than the initial repair paste cycles. The reload is a solid minute which leaves you with no active rep.
---
Same here. Almost 4 years now. Never thought of swiping myself into a titan. Going the hard, long way.
---
there are a few factors that influence what kind of enemies you fight in missions. 
---
1. Agent faction - this is mostly the other empires you will fight being an amarr agent you will see some kill gallente/minmatar missions. 
---
2. Region - Check the belt rats you probably get a bunch of missions with those,  some amarr regions have blood some have sansha.  Then there are a few more missions that have a different variation depending on the region.  The assault is a lv4 mission, in amarr/caldari space there are gurista pirates, in gallente/minmatar space there are serpentis pirates. 
---
3. There are some Generic missions that show up pretty much everywhere.  Honestly these are probably most of what you are seeing.
---
he held cloak and stuff came to save it
---
You can get titans right now for far cheaper than a 1000
---
&gt; If you are just running anoms though it is overkill.
---
overkill makes more money though.
---
I love stories like this. I was obsessed with the idea of EVE way before I was able to start playing. And unlike basically every other game, it has lived up to, and exceeded, my expectations.
---
Isn't 1000 plex like 4b or am i missing something ?
---
Your argument is similar to the people who want to quit over something getting nerfed.
---
If someone's main activity in the game is nerfed and they don't want to continue without without it, despite there being plenty of alternative options. That's a personal problem, not a problem with the game. Things get nerfed, things change. It's a game. If you can't handle that maybe online MMOs aren't your thing.
---
herro I would like you to inform you that Frat doesn't VNI bot
---
those are just very tired China players
---
by hunting them you are being very racist
---
Today we salute you, Mr. Reddit Game Developer. Armed with only a handful of data points, you're willing to tell a gaming company with all the data points what it should focus on. Some might say you're biased and pushing them to focus on your playstyle instead of the ones that are hurting. You know, like the PvE that is terrible and outdated. Or the new player experience which was terrible and outdated. Or the really unfriendly clunky interface. But you know they're wrong.
---
Others might say that a company whose livelihood hinges on the success or failure of the game cares more about it's health than you do as a player. But as their #somethingith fan, that can't be true.
---
So here's to you, Mr. Reeee Eve is Dying. Without you, who would know that the game's average concurrent player count has dropped by 500 after a nerf patch or how to get them all back.
---
It doesn't matter what people do or don't do. The Price History shows placed orders.
---
Honest question from someone in a similar boat. Have you considered abyssal space? You only need really one active account, you CAN do them in WH space but it's risky. I've had 5 accounts subbed for almost 2 years, took a 6 month break and now I'm back with just 2 accounts subbed atm. 
---
Abyssal PvE is the most dynamic and unpredictable I've ever encountered, plus with the possibility of actual risk and potential for PvP at the end it solves all my itches in one fell swoop.
---
I never thought of it that way. PLEX and those things directly involved with PLEX (injectors/extractors etc) are the only thing that's really inflating this way. IF anything, ships/mods are cheaper now than they were 2 years ago.
---
He means 1k plex not 1k usd
---
ty
---
Dont give them any ideas!
---
If you actually cared about the game you'd send your criticism to CCP. Reddit can't fix your problems nor do most of us actually care that some random dude quit an internet space game. 
---
Eve is a game that changes, a lot. Plexing is an **alternate** form of account subscription. CCP want more people to pay with money. If you don't like it then either downsize your gameplay or quit playing, as you've already done. 
---
At the end of the day if you don't enjoy something go do something else, if you have feedback give it to the people that can actually use it, and don't cry on Reddit about it. Remember to give all your stuff to some random newbro in Jita when you leave.
---
Yeah that's the thing really, for fleets the dragur can't keep up with the shield AB bombers or retris/wolves. For solo you could make a active rep fit designed to kite at mystic range except for the fact that it will get chased down by everything but the slowest cruiser. 
---
Plus it will probably cost 400-500m unless disintegrator and kikimora prices fall heavily with trig incursions. Just don't see a viable role for the ship except as ban evading in AT (lol)
---
Yea
---
I wanna see PLEX skyrocket to like 6m per unit just to see more of these whine posts.
---
I definitely meant Plex.
---
I'm not whining. I buy Plex with my wallet. I'm loving it, I hate PvE.
---
Used my mobile Hotspot to link my phone back during a hurricane to play some EVE on my laptop.
---
Works fine and this was 6 years ago

I like how 150 Arty Abaddon /Bhaal fleet + support turned into bombers lol

wooooooow
