Flaying a logi ship save someone's ship that was in Hull and never received a thank you note..

---
i don't think the parallels you're trying to draw here work as well as you think they do.
---
have one toon in jita to practice local pvp. use this alt to shit-post on r/eve. mine baizou salt. giggle.
---
Ah better. Provi isk positive now ;)
---
Do you have data that you have posted somewhere or could post? It would be nice to see the raw numbers.
---
But it's okay to shit post here on r/eve
---
I'm not sure that everyone that trusted me with the data would be comfortable with releasing it, since it's still really new and we have no idea what the next phase is going to be I'd prefer to wait until the event is over before releasing any raw data beyond my own.
---
Don't be too quick to specialize your character. Spread your skill points around and try everything (even mining). EVE is different enough from other games that even if you think you know what you'll want to do, you're probably wrong. So train every skill you can get your hands on to level III or so. The time it takes to do so is a pretty small investment overall. Become a jack of all trades, and by the time you do, you'll have enough experience with EVE to make an informed decision about what you consider worth the time to master.
---
&gt;Easy to say in hindsight
---

---
Not really. Even after the war, Goons were still the largest alliance, at the head of the largest coaliton. Not to mention Goons are tenacious as fuck and have been in bad situations before but always bounced back. Plus, because everyone piled into the North, the entire west and south were all but uninhabited. 
---
Not saying it's feasible for INIT to go solo (although I would love to see that) right now, just that it was pretty predictable that GSF would make a comeback. Granted I didn't think they'd come back this strong.
---
Most null blocks wouldn't puss on mittens if he were on fire. Let alone listen to him.
---
Apart from Test of course, who will do whatever they're told.
---
you can both dislike the new AI mechanic while simultaneously enjoying self-righteous goon salt
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I sure do
---
Can't play Soundcloud, could someone fill me in on what is said?
---
Imagine letting someone live this rent free in your head
---
Obviously you care since you made the effort to post this.
---
It's content.  We can either choose to do nothing or something in response, and this is it.  Just like you choose to respond to it by making this post.  You are literally complaining about someone else complaining.
---
join karmafleet and become an overlord
---
nahh, only goons have been crying
---
pot. kettle. black.
---
yeah but people support the dumb ai mechanic simply because it makes people salty
---
do you even know what complaining means?
---
Bah! Caldari scum leave these fresh idealistic new pilots to the glories of the Federation!
---
Why would you rat in range of NPC stations without an Umbrella is the real question... Are you retarded? Go ahead and be an easy frag i guess? Or do you expect to 1v12, your super vs. 12 Dreads. I'm sure that will work out great for you.
---
&gt; It's obviously not a codebase and greatly simplified. You can explain that it's more than a simple switch without being a full, "*WELL AKTCHUALLY*" condescending shithead about it. 
---
By that measure, aren't you being a needlessly pedantic condescending shithead with your entire post? 
---
If you go all the way back through my posts, my original response to the whole "What's the point if they don't do that?" was that they probably haven't gotten it developed that far. The rest of the discussion branched off from that response. So my comment I made that you insinuated that I was deflecting was not me deflecting, the conversation had grown past that original response and I was reinforcing my points. It still didn't change what the original point I was making was. 
---
Now, as to your last statement, it's not arguing details of means. The poster asked a question and I responded with what I believed the most likely reason was given the comments and presentations by CCP of the NPC AI model development. Is it all conjecture? Sure. I don't know anymore than anyone else does. They're response to me was to argue that it didn't need "AI" followed by a short if then statement as if to punctuate that it should be a relatively simple implementation that shouldn't have been left out. I think you should know as well as anyone that it's always easier to progress in baby steps and ferret out any unexpected results from something as complex as behavioral modeling. 
---
I'm not trying to make this long-winded so I'll just say that maybe what the OP wanted is something as simple as a fleet just spawning on top of a structure that had a timer, but I just don't feel that having them spawn like a wave of rats in a mission site is in lockstep with what CCP is trying to do with this new NPC behavioral model. I think they're going to try to make it as player-like as they can. I could be wrong though
---
People are dumb.
---
One of the best pieces of advice in this thread. I wonder how many thousand newbies quit after a week because they got bored of highsec mining fresh out of the tutorial.
---
Damn Earth go hard.
---
Don't go to Tama! You will get blobbed on the gate getting in.
---
I might check dotlan and zKill as they have filters showing you where the action is on any given day.
---
that's reasonable, too. 
---
I don't think it's a good or clever mechanic at all. I do, however, enjoy the show that goons made of how hard it is to tolerate a few days of pve.
---
Can the second comrade talk closer to the mic next time?
---
People who need to hold grid when a sub-cap response fleet shows up.
---
Hey all people been doing is complaining about "no content" and at the same time bragging about how null is safer than highsec. Seems like you guys got what was coming.  You do not brag about null being safer than highsec when they did not mean for it to be that way. They responded and changed that shit lol
---
Meant exponential function, sorry, not logarithmic. If you get close to the limit, things to be roughly equal. Take something like y=(e^(x-10)). There's basically no difference in-between x=1 and x=4, they're all pretty close to 0 even if one is 4 times the number of the other. Something like x=12, 3 times the other number, will lead to a much bigger number though.
---
Just add an upper bound and it scales according to some measure of activity, although that's more of a measure to balance out systems. It works out essentially so that the biggest null entities get hit more than the small ones, but everybody gets hit at least a little bit. Could also add a lower bound to make sure every system has a chance to get hit.
---
the lack of ratting characters in delve was probably why the ratting dropped.
---
Apparently, you wouldn't have busywork without an empire. Adopt to the new meta.
---
Hmmmm.  Trump won.  Goons recently deployed 1,000 Titians.  I'm noticing a pattern here.
---
Mitten's taste better.
---
Sounds like you're trying just a little too hard.
---
I mean, the entire point of them is to provide some risk, as far as i know. They're not meant to be "rewarding" since there's enough (too much) isk making pve going on already down in null.
---
AFAIK even if they're only a nuisance, they actively form something big nullblocs need to pay attention to. Something that isn't solved by simply having a big group or a nice fleet of supercaps on standby - it takes actual actions and player activity directed at it.
---
This ^^ so max time of 23 seconds if you notice a neut at the start of an Av cycle. Give or take a little depending on what vector you’re on compared to your target safe
---
&gt; but it can't be both easy to manage and annoying to manage, ineffectual and impactful, or trivial and taxing at the same time.
---
Real world example time. At my job we have an alarm system for certain meaningless errors. We know they are going to happen and we don't care because these particular errors are expected and don't actually matter. But the software generates them anyway and there is no way to disable them. If enough meaningless errors pile up in the management window you can't see the ones that actually matter. This results in an employee needing to keep the error window open all day and manually close each and every meaningless report individually, it takes a single mouse click to do sure, but it still has to be done... HUNDREDS of times EACH day, this a simple yet annoying, trivial yet taxing, process for the poor bastard who gets stuck on that particular duty each day.
---
We have not even touched your high-sec citadels yet and you are already crying about it on reddit - imagine how much salt we are gonna mine from pubbies once the steamroller will start running over highsec burning everything on its path - delicious.
---
adding arbitrary busy work to the game isn't a solution, it's a problem to cover up issues
---
adding in busy work does not solve the issue- it's not more dangerous, just more annoying
---
why didnt goons continue to rat is supers then? Oh right no umbrella.
---
I see goons shitpost, I upvote
---
what did they cancel now?
---
&gt; why didnt goons continue to rat in supers then?
---
because the supers had been moved out of delve...
---
Goons had to call of this amazing war with just so so much content ,theres so much people just can't handle it, for a few shield timers made by npc's. imagine the biggest war machine in eve history brought to its knee's over shield timers, that just repaired themselves. I'd be enraged if I was mittens as well.
---
Here's an idea low power structures come out 48-72 hours from ref +- 90min from the tz timer set. Citadel spam relatively solved...
---
Sorry, I'm a shitposter, and not a very good news anchor haha.
---
You have a really shitty recording there. There are plenty of other Fireside recordings and better quality.
---
Popcorn!
---
lol, you're telling me NO ONE in delve had a super when goons were deployed? I guess you can delude yourself into believing your own lies.
---
seriously what did they cancel?
---
&gt; Also mittens learn to record audio at human volumes please.
---
You literally linked a recording by a third party (that is neither the complete fireside, nor has it been optimized). 🤷‍♂️
---
Learn to spam d-scan, it is essential in wormholes and a good habit everywhere else.
---
So this is what goons do to lift their spirits after realizing blueing most of nullsec doesn't lead to content
---
I know I did once
---
Such a big wall of text and such little content - can you summarise in one sentence what exactly is your point please ?
---
I would recommend a kiting fit with skirm links, dual prop, disrupter, armor tank and a nano fiber for extra speed
---
Have you ever tried solo dictor hunting in say wormholes? Can be a lot of fun, and you can pod people out of holes if you like being mean.
---
Its all an act. He is meta gaming.
---
If CCP was hoping SOV alliances would feed expensive fleets into NPCs they do not know there player base.
---
This BR is fucked up, you need to get sides correct, who was on which side.
---
you're telling me we took 1000+ supers and titans up north, and somehow everyone still had their ratting supers and titans in delve at the same time?
---
here's a better idea
---
remove armor timer from mediums and larges (keep them for extra larges)
---
remove shield timer from low power citadels
---
this: makes low power citadels have no timers, and makes citadels non autistic to kill
---
I still cant fathom him using the term pubbie with such an intense frequency as if he was even liked/accepted on SA while unironically having the largest pubbie playerbase inhabbiting the same space and alliance. Speaking derogatorily about a group of people that make up 95% of your fighting force. Jesus.
---
This is probably the single best piece of advise. I started out being attached to every ship and God said when it died. I not have about 5,000 total losses on my 3 main accounts and I could care less. Hell I even count my super and titan as dead as soon as I undock it. I have rare ships that I will NOT undock because I know anything can happen. Those are reserved for flipping later on down the road.
---
I needed more fingers to count the complaint routing going on here!
---
I am thoroughly jealous of the way you threw that thing around. If I ever own one, may I also kick the tires and light the fires. I'll name it 'Bound for the Board'.
---
but its not targeting unfueled cits that were just thrown down to be annoying, they aren't specifically aiming for ones people let run out of fuel, they are just randomly spawning and shooting anything in a system they can lock.
---
&gt;The drifters are giving nullsec what it asked for...
---
no it's not you retard
---
&gt;It's simply an example of an unanticipated condition that hadn't been accounted for.
---
This means that CCP didn't think to account for a tactic that's been around as long as stealth bombers have.... if they can;t account for that what else did they not think of?
---
what?
---
I suggest you going to null at least once and see how it looks being there, as you sound like a sofa inhabiting smart ass who has never left highsec.
---
On the backfoot? You must not play.
---
&gt; the lack of umbrella made it so that there was less ratting
---
Of course it did.  Why wouldn't it?
---
To get an oauth2 id and secret you need to have valid debit/credit card on your account that was used to buy a subscription at some point. not sure if it's still a thing but it was when it first came out
---
Came back after not playing for years. I’m looking to join a group that won’t mind working with a new player. I enjoyed the E-war side of things last time.
---
thank you
---
What I'm saying is that, YES, some supers and titans will stay behind. Not EVERYONE is going to be deployed. Why did your leadership ping the fuck out the coalition when they said "You get tackled, there is no fleet to save you." why huh? Because SOME idiots will try to krab with their supers, because that is ALL they know. What does that mean? There are people with supers still in delve that were stupid or couldn't deploy up north. When the krabs realized there was no umbrella, they were either killed, started ratting in smaller ships (meaning less krab efficiency) or just stopped ratting all together.
---
Why are you so dense?
---
would have lived if it was a shield super
---
How do we find them? Came back after years today.
---
They come back daily. They must be purged daily. Or you lose structures like Horde did.
---
My TEST boys have been laughing their asses off
---
&gt;air our reputation? We are deeply concerned about how we're viewed by the greater community, as I'm sure you're aware.
---
Dont worry we will just bring the war to low and high sec
---
&gt; I had a lot more respect for the goons of the past.
---
No, you didn't.
---
Maybe put a structure yourself and see how this may work for you, how you will enjoy this new type of ‘content’?
---
Speaking of highsec, looks like you're going to be spending a lot of time there yourself.
---
This is a fucking great thread this sub is awesome thank you guys so much 
---
-from somewhat of a newbie
---
It's almost as if you are my head eh? Thanks for for being my thought process. What would I ever do if querns didn't tell me how I thought.
---
&gt;why huh?
---
because we didn't deploy rorquals up north since they're of pretty much 0 use in a military campaign.
---
That's what I'm trying to say, but I guess some people can't see that.
---
\-Don't warp gate-to-gate in low/nullsec
---
\-Don't overspecialize early on; figure out what you enjoy before taking skills to 5
---
\-Don't fly what you'd be upset to lose
---
\-Don't mine in highsec without a mining permit
---
Im just an r/eve resident with an account subbed through 2023 that I don't play anymore. But yeah, when I was last playing I did fw, and those areas (not just the system but a few jumps in any direction) were the most active.
---
You can bet the most active kills in lowsec system on dotlan are where to be.
---
What can I say? I'm just a good guy like that. When someone is a little confused, I can help ease the way. I don't expect anything in return, of course.
---
TBH a null-wide NIP and all out invasion of high sec would probably be one of the most hilarious and interesting things to happen in the game in years.
---
Alright I will just right you off as a bad case of spod brain. nice chatting with you. o7
---
Had this been proven? I haven't see. Any evidence to support this. Death toll still remains a single jump gate afaik
---
Touché
---
Well, because mittens represents goons, and his decisions and personality make him so hateable and childish, people hate the goons (as a group and often the individual members too) by extension.
---
Also circlejerks are a thing, and every community has a 'bad guy'. I think he is one of the worst people I know of in this game, but that doesn't mean he isn't a victim of the circlejerk too.
---
you're the one that thinks ratting will magically continue when all the ratters have left the region.
---
like... what?
---
We arent Darkness.
---
I would not call it ‘content’ - it is the dumbest NPC behaviour ever which makes 99.999% of null players just sit and do nothing and wait till it eventually ends - how is this engaging ?
---
Besides , if we just got an excuse to burn highsec to the ground and extract mountains of salt and screeching from highsec pubbies, why not take it?
---
I get this reference
---
I do not understand why people keep calling this "content", the game is playing itself, how is that in any way content? Its not creating opportunities for people to third party the fleet fighting the drifters, its not setting up timers that other parties can follow up on because they are too busy defending their own, its not in any way an engaging PVE experience, there is essentially no payout for killing these fucking things. Its all the most boring parts of eve rolled into a forced event, that's not content, its killing content. Why go roaming when you might jump a gate and get insta vaporized by a fleet of scraming, webbing BS's that can shoot 150 KM and scram you even farther away than that? Its bad enough when the players gate camp now the NPC's are doing it and they're better at it then the players are.
---
John Mayer is an amazing musician. Just because you’re a bigot doesn’t mean we should bend the knee to your kingdom of bigotry
---
those pay when they die and sometimes drop loot. These fuckers have god like tracking and range drop nothing to make it worth the effort and kill any subcap they can lock up not even renters like this pve.
---
According to the post, Mittens is working with pretty much everyone, including us and Frat in addition to his pets in Legacy and Gotg, on this anti-hisec stuff. We aren't making ourselves look stupid while complaining about it, but its not really a good mechanic
---
you're giving him too much credit he's not a content creator, he's a content observer.
---
can you give tldr?
---
Haven't you seen fast and furious 2
---
Sorry I wasn't very clear. They appear to be on the backfoot in every nullsec-based discourse. On the defense.
---
This must be in Syndicate.
---
Looking even at the 5Y range, it’s down a little but it’s so spiky it’s hard to say.
---
Get your scouts and recons out like everybody else?
---
So lazy.
---
&gt; it is "emergent" behavior based on learning done by player observation. It's not designed at all and that is the *whole fucking point*. 
---
LOL what are you even talking about dude, that's not how it works lmao. Did you think CCP is coding cutting edge machine learning AI for their NPCs? Come on
---
Yes, I will be doing some sightseeing trips with my torch.
---
I like that no matter what you post, the butthurt brigade rolls through to take away your important reddit points
---
Not particularly. It’s just a waiting game for them to warp to a fort. Then you bomb the drifters
---
Grr discord
---
Yeah, total waste of time. Just drop 100 supercaps on them and be done with it in a matter of seconds.
---
It’s only not content because you don’t want it to be. Form cheap ships like corms, go lose them, and kill the fleet.
---
The Cormorant is the best ship in the game for fun.
---
The Tristan, Incursis, Rifter are tied for second. 
---
The confessor is the best hisec exploration/anom ship.
---
The gila is the swiss army knife of eve ships. There are better ships for each jobs, but there isnt a better ship to do all the jobs.
---
Get out to null in ships you expect to die in. Ops can be over when ever you feel like it, instead of when you return to base.
---
I can confirm, it is everyday struggle.
---
but they aren't actually threatening ihubs or tcus and they don't seem to be following up on cit timers, so instead of being threatened by the event you have to do with the slim but very real possibility some other player group decides to follow up on the timer. Which results in a lot of people sitting around not fighting waiting to see if a fight with break out instead of being out and about increasing the chances a fight starts.
---
Cool. I'll be in J-Space if you need me.
---
What do you mean, sir? Have you not seen the countless Super-losses on zKill? Or is Le Reddit the only website you ever use? Also, nice 'HURR DURR NO UMBRELLA' Lemming. 
---
Note: Your comment is below average, 2/10 for execution.
---
You justify the need for this with an example tools that require player input, yet you shun the idea of a tool that requires player input, and want an automatic pull.
---
Your justification then goes to shit. 
---
Good luck.
---
https://m.mixcloud.com/traeumerftw/ 
---
Null blocks working together, giant fight videos are why (sometimes) players start playing Eve, none of that gonna happen soon due to Drifters. CCP literally doing this to cover their mistake of selling SP per the rage of people complaining.
---
Take my upvote you majestic fucking unicorn
---
fc what are jump clones
---
Is the reason you dont warp gate to gate because of bubbles?
---
On the defence ? When was the last time you actually logged on?
---
I, too, am gay.
---
Hisec hauling alts is key. Sometimes your static will be in Khanid and that sucks for everything.
---
game is shit, that's all you gotta know
---
Windows 10, but with Jing screen capture to take the snapshot.
---
who was Provi FC?
---
What does Xenuria suddenly has to do with any of this?
---
Thanks. I found the missing ship in assets. Boy this game has a lot of depth. I love it regardless of the steep learning curve
---
Vysh, provi is recruiting, come fly with him.
---
Yes. Technically you can if you’re flying something nullified (inty/T3C) but it’s good stay out of the habit unless you’re completely alone in system
---
I think he means from the reddit shitpost war ya'll are on the backfoot.
---
Which, kinda, yeah.
---
DJ’s attitude was to ruin everyone else game - how much is it different from, just replace ‘everyone else’ with more precise ‘highsec pubbies’ and you get pretty much the same thing.
---
Do t2 cloaks get shut off in a bubble?
---
because everyone is sitting on their own timers. This is what happens when you have AI's reff everyone, no one goes out to follow up because they are all too busy laying defense.
---
The wild thing is that I still have so many. I've been nothing if not ardently consistent in my zealotry. I guess they'll have to try harder. Maybe they can make a room on their Fortnite discord and coordinate their efforts to sap my fake internet points? Clearly, I'm like Samson, and my fake internet points are my weak point.
---
No but you’ll be caught out at the end he and have to slow boat to the gate. This increases the chance for someone in the camp to come within 2.5k and uncloak you. Best thing to do is set up perches where you can dscan just the gate to see what is waiting for you, or if it’s on grid then just check out the overview. Note that straight above the gate at 300km is very popular so try to do something different so their tackle doesn’t have an easy time
---
You *heard* it? You sir sound like a very well informed person, I tip my hat to you.
---
but that would require them to attack someone turtled up in their home space, on a citadel grid, under their super umbrella. You have better chances betting on the bills winning 5 super bowls in a  row then NC taking that fight.
---
In this case it's just a bad case of Dave
---
?
---
The old guard goons were your edgelord racists that have all now joined PL. Keep worshipping those cucks if you like. Best if you stick to people you identify with after all.
---
I might, but will I be able to shitpost every threat with “Reeeeeeeee”
---
This new content (pbh) can we put up all kinds of crap about we are followers of drifter 3.14 and he is eliminating  the scourge of nullsec?
---
Will we be able to ruin your game? And while we are at it shit up the rest of the game?
---
Who needs objectivity when you can grr goons?
---
before CCP threw it under the bus in the name of profits there was this thing called the alliance tournament, the winners got limited, incredibly powerful ships that often sold for trillions per hull. PL had a history of winning quite frequently and then selling a few for insane prices when they needed quick cash. And as Jin pointed out they also had periods were they were cash up front mercs and they owned decent numbers of R64 moons and for a little while during the technetium bottle neck days they took over most of the venal moons which was worth a good chunk of change.
---
He does not want to damage *the* game, he wants to damage *your* game - for heavens sake please do some homework son.
---
Hey, init is a strong independant pvp alliance!!
---
that sure is one way to miss the point
---
if you want to assume CCP doesn't just change the rules with no announcement again sure. But if they're willing to let the drifters ignore damage cap who's to say they won't suddenly start ignoring the reinforcement timer mechanic? We have no way of knowing and CCP keeps playing the quiet game so in the mean time everyone has to assume the worst which means turtling up which means content generation falls off a cliff, and all of this is happening in the middile of summer... its like CCP wants to kill the concurrent player count or something.
---
Dont worry war to low sec and High sec is the next step
---
hey at least im getting something out of this event even if you null guys arent lots of salt
---
Oh dear, the words are hurting, you're right in that they were shitty people, but they weren't pussies. I'm not worshiping anyone, not sure where you got that idea. There is something called basic respect you give to any one, clearly you lack the moral.
---
Rioting in jita for days. Never really encountered anything in any other game that came anywhere close to being that unique.
---
‘Mittani Empire’ - look up in the article. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni
---
I think the original intent might have been to disrupt intel/logistics enough for opportunistic players to swoop in and deal the real damage. If you can really beat these things with a bunch of corms or 1 super, then they serve mostly as a distraction so that players can come in and be the real punch.
---
Im not sure about this though, and doubly unsure of if it actually plays out that way
---
and while your in high and null we will terrorize your renters so win win
---
I am looking at the BR... is this supposed to be the weekly ganked fleet? Are those all the numbers?
---
What the fuck happened to Spectre? I remember ganked being 140+ people event, and now they barely get 50 dudes on saturday evening?
---
Holy fuck you are salty
---
No wonder spectre is in shithole now when people like you become FCs
---
He can't damage my game...son.
---
This was my immediate thought. People called the triglavian invasions a dud and now they're quite interesting. I hope this is just the first wave for people to get acquainted with the mechanics, just so they can raise up the level in a week or two.
---
Wow, this guy is severely delusional.
---
I vaguely remember something about living in the space you claim. If this in unacceptable, perhaps folks should click on that “unanchor” button and move their excess citadels out of where they are and put them where they live?
---
I would love if they would show up to the timers and actually destroy shit. It would make it so people would only deploy whatever infrastructure is necessary and not spam tons of citadels and stuff. Also if players kill a ton of rats, the NPCs should also have a chance to spawn tougher fleets that attack stuff.
---
This idea rules but I would make them also have weapons that are effective against capital ships so the best way to fight them is with subcap gangs.
---
mind telling me how your going to burn my shit down i stage in a npc station in high ? and i can go months with out eve can you
---
Just read the article ..... it is a play word.
---
Ganked has been built up to around 100 guys on prime over the last year.   
---
Spectre was to be shut down just over a year ago and was dead with very little to zero participation. We rebuilt it and done a damn fine job. I would also say, spectre fleet has only ever had one fleet that size and that was many many years ago.
---
Step 1. Get everything home safely.
---
Step 2. Devastate highsec by making all the T2 stuff slightly more expensive? (Because highseccers never ever out-bling nullbear's gear by miles... /s)
---
Step 3. ???
---
Step 4. Try to imagine there's enough ammo and willpower to burn down all highsec's production... hmm...
---
Can't be done.
---
Gee, I bet highsec's really gonna wish CCP hadn't ~pissed in Null's Cheerios~
---
You really want to "Go to war with CCP"? Burn the starter systems, and take your bans like men.
---
Personally, I look forward to watching it all unfold.
---
I'm curious, though...
---
What are your criteria for Op Success, and Op Failure?
---
Please read the rest of the post that you are replying to.
---
Of course we are, we are all just hiding right now in ours mum’s basement so scared to get out and waiting for this horrible thing to end.
---
It's not that hard to defend a single structure from them, an astras guns can basically do it on their own. For it to be hard you need to have, say 170 timers generated in a single day while your alliance thinks their home region is safe.
---
TBH: I think I am so unable to get the concept of groupthink that i probably don't want to do that.
---
Not an offence but goons are all about groupthink as far as I know. And that is something I really hate from the heart.
---
Invasion part II, nullsec steamrolling HS ! hooo the tears
---
‘Your’ was more figurative here but I am sure you got the point.
---
I imagine they'll cancel the drifter invasion because all of the nullsec leaders are throwing a hissy fit. I won't be surprised if CCP caved.
---
Never not upvote goon shitposts.
---
Goons swore to destroy BoB, but now they have become BoB

Im not sure where you see my being upset? Also FYI Im not only a spectre FC, Im the head of spectre along with virion and sam. Where have you been for the last 3 years? Do you even eve? :'D

+ 1 for throwing salt on a open wound
---
Third partying??? They learned from us too well.
---
Yeah, I'll call that bullshit m8, ganked was an event that now apparently has been declassed to just an attempted sovbash as it seems. It regularly broke the 100 peeps barrier at the very least, and got even higher when someone prominent (Mangala had always big numbers) and it often resulted in pretty nice, long fights. 
---
TBF spectre should have closed back then.
---
Because of this, I'm starting to use my d scan  shortcut even when I'm not playing Eve!
---
while i am feeding on all the goon salt i will have to say that if there is no reward for the work put into it thats a fail on cpp it needs to at least have a pay out dont get me wrong them more goons are cranky over something the more i like it but there still needs to be a pay out
---
Is it possible to block someone on reddit? Asking for a friend
---
This is less about behaviour but more of a quality of life tip.
---
If you hold shift and click-drag in empty space, you can select all the entities within the marquee. It also possible to use this method to click-and-drag holding the ctrl key down to lock onto targets. I find that it helps me with situational awareness, where before I was constantly eyeballing the overview.
---
This didn't work 3 days ago when the first person posted it with a better headline, why would it work now.. Move along nothing to see here
---
If an Athenor is actively pulling a moon chunk in, and is then RF'd for the first time, does it still pull the rock in or is it lost?
---
I still can't figure out why they don't just disband at this point.
---
who exactly is "we" because all the null groups appear to be getting in on the fuck highsec bandwagon?
---
we as in not null
---
k
---
Call whatever you like buddy. If you call bullshit dont be picky on what bullshit you choose. NPSI is comprised of the players in eve from all alliances/corps. Mangala pulled in members from alliance and only every hit around 100. Not that it matters :) NPSI is the healthest it has been in a VERY long time.
---
Oh yeah they were killing shit
---
Elo
---
Well, history tells us there was an Edenwide conspiracy against them, multiple times..  The T20 incident is literally this.  World War Bee was literally this.
---
Talk to the guys in TEST who have structure gunnery roles. Its a shitty chore that if done, results in no dead structures.
---
Who is this we? You may be a line member in a grr  goon alliance but your leadership is in the same boat and will have the same goals and if your a highsec player.. LOL please come out and attack
---
Talk to the few trusted to gun structures in Horde. The rest are oblivious to what a shitty chore it is to bomb these drifters out of existence every time they show up.
---
so pirat, and snuff then?
---
or just WI. into horde and be done with.
---
A good suggestion was mentioned above, i.e., structure density
---
Drifters and Tryglavians should exist to encourage a desired gameplay balance, with the goal of keeping tiny groups and huge groups in check relative to the intended experiance. 
---
If you was to look at EVE Alliances as you do ship usage you would have Titans fighting Titans with no one losing ships. Then every now and then a group of Frigates join fights and get volleyed of field. The goal should be to foster a more diverse and fluid Alliance and Corporation landscape. I believe Drifters and Tryglavians can do that by making group sizes accountable for their influence.
---
There is plenty of room for Goons, but the price you pay to be Goons should be accountable on a daily basis. Being Goons now is fostered from all the hard work of the past, but there is no Capitalism left to compete so everyone gets worst products. You might be making all the ISK... but what does it matter when you realise EVE online has become a Socialist Dictatorship.
---
Its basically saying EVE used to be the American dream of the 80s, but now its modern China.
---
well it is what we do
---
So if nullsec wants more meaningful fight. CCP: I got this, lets give them NPC to fight???
---
They do work as well as he thinks tbh..
---
Memes don't need to be factually correct, they just need max upvotes by repeating the top topics of the hive mind.
---
High structure density = More drifters
---
Pretty simple concept in that you should be able to defend your space. It's also arrogant to think that you should be able to leave your "fortress" for a few weeks and it should stay as-is without interaction.
---
seems reasonable
---
a. im not grr goons as a whole i dont like goon swarm but i have no issue with the members of goon swarm b.lol me high sec i stage in high yes its easier but i fear high sec and for the record im not the one that said i was going to destroy ever one in high and low because i was unhappy with ccp so dont expect any sympathy
---
I think he’s pointing out there wasn’t much thought into this event than we wanted to give credit for
---
We are not here to ruin the game, We are here to ruin your game 
---
- Drifters To Goons 2019
---
So you are saying Goons are now BOB
---
We don't exepect sympathy,  but it will be fun to fuck with the market some more im excited
---
Fair point.
---
I’m just saying cos I would like to express myself at the top of this thread 
---
FUCK OFF YOU FUCK !
---
that is all x
---
So the big bad pvp game was just turned into a pve game, and /r/eve is wondering why people are mad?
---
wont effect me in any way so go for it
---
It is no different in goons, line members wont understand how frustrating it can be, but line members follow leadership so eventually you'll be laughing your way to highsec to pop some engineering complexes 😂
---
why? the citadel guns do a better job
---
Sounds like another resident /r/eve hobo.
---
Have you never lost a ship/had to buy ammo/ etc? Out of curiosity if that's true sure it won't affect you, bit if you ever have used Jita.. Then it will eventually affect your bottom line,  just not overnight
---
Isn't this what BoB would do?
---
That’s true but if you treat it like an annoyance rather than something to do, you’re going to keep seeing it as something unfun.
---
Which post, Mittens post? 
---
Has Gobbins or the rest actually said anything directly to their line members? If so, I have not seen it.
---
They're throwing corm fleets at the problem. How long is that going to be fun for? How long until the fleets don't get enough people to actually kill anything? How long until the FC's burn out because they have to form every 30 minutes, not for players and killmails, but randomly spawned NPC's?
---
What's the point. This adds nothing for anyone.
---
Why the fuck does anyone willingly asscociate with someone like that?
---
On both sides tbh
---
That might be just fine for them
---
i like how you and a couple of other commenters have used 'simple yet annoying' as though i ever claimed something couldn't be simple and irritating, which of course i didn't.
---
my point is that dran is both claiming that this won't be a problem/hassle, whilst also saying it's pointless because it therefore creates hassle for no effect. but it's pretty obvious to me that the hassle *is* the intended effect. so either it isn't a hassle and therefore there's no problem, or it is a hassle in which case it's working as intended.
---
I thought about it and found myself too lazy. Glad someone stepped up, that shit was hilarious.
---
&gt;Step 2. Devastate highsec by making all the T2 stuff slightly more expensive? (Because highseccers never ever out-bling nullbear's gear by miles... /s)
---
No you misunderstand. 
---
Right now highseccers can put in 10bn in inputs and get back 11bn worth of outputs, if they manufacture stuff. And then every time they repeat this they add another 10%, then interest on interest occur. Even though you started out only earning 1bn profit every cycle, when you're at the second cycle you earn 1.1bn, and then you earn some complex decimal number after that, and then eventually you get 5 billion profit in one cycle with the same effort in clicks as before, because you had 50bn for inputs instead of 10bn. 
---
So highseccers have been able to plex their accounts and bling their shit for over a decade by basically producing **everything** the nullsec empires ever destroyed. 
---
Since the citadels arrived however, more and more production have gone to nullsec. Because of bonuses and the fact that the ore now originates in nullsec, nullsec industry can out-compete highsec. And then highseccers can no longer put in 10bn worth of inputs and get back 11bn when they sell the outputs. Instead nullseccers will be able to do this, at an increased profit margin. 
---
The pubbies who just buy from jita, they can keep doing L4 missions as before. But anyone in highsec who ever engage in activities that result in losing a ship occasionally, they will hurt, because they have to grind more isk for each hour of fun content they get (assuming they think PVE isn't fun). 
---
But really we're just doing this because its funny. Highseccers have these structures and make tons of isk from a few clicks a month, so lets make some explosions and take over their low click effort income.
---
the issue is that this doesn't properly fix the issue, and only makes life miserable for the people running the empire.
---
at least make a player reason for it
---
Hmmm, where else have I seen someone supporting a mechanic just because it made people salty......it's right on the tip of my tongue
---
if the event produces burnout then it isn't easy to manage. note i referred to the event as a whole, not any single instance of an attack.
---
idk where
---
Uhm, no. We act as a group, but out of ops, you can do what you want.
---
&gt;Simple and Easy are not the same thing
---
 yeah, good thing i never said they were, or even used the word simple anywhere in that post. you may as well have replied "Apricot and Easy are not the same thing".
---
&gt;He does not want to damage *the* game, he wants to damage *your* game
---
I'm not sure why you think those things are mutually exclusive.
---
Looks like you got your wish null is grouping up to fight the common enemy,  highsec
---
The enemy didn't undock so not really any opportunities for a proper content video, structure bashing probably better than ship spinning in a propaganda post eh.
---
Nope
---
I have structure gunnery rights in TEST and I don't particularly mind shooting drifters.
---
Oh hey, it's this thread again.
---
If you feel that way I recommend unsubscribing, biomassing, and checking out another MMO.
---
But before you do, can I have your stuff?
---
But you're not NPSI. You selectively engage, and are effectively just a meatshield for RC. Which is probably why your numbers suck. People aren't retarded like you and your overlords think they are.
---
I’m not certain how so many people misread this as an I’m quitting post.
---
overload all the things
---
train the magic 14 skills first - they are skills all ships you can fly benefit from. Dont specialize and dont play alone. No grinding for plex also advised, pay up or burn out tygn
---
Ok.
---
Other than X you can do whatever you want.
---
You realise how dump that sounds for someone who just wants to do the things she/he wants to do?
---
Then you will be a real asset to TEST when the other gunners burn out.
---
Yeah i get that, but i am also curious,  whats cancelled?
---
It's almost as if there is an unnecessarily large number of structured and territories being defended by a single entity
---
You say that, but we still maintain the largest alliance in the game. How much worse must everyone else be if that's the high bar?
---
Why would they it doesn't involve the line members at the moment,  people only get told what they need to hear, nothing more
---
Ningen, we're way better at being BoB than they ever were.
---
!RemindMe 6 months. 
---
Lets see how you feel about this after a while.
---
Pirat don't fuck with null 😂 how can they hide in stations when they don't have docking rights
---
If mittens was lying about this, someone would contradict him. Gobbins goes on Reddit too, and he’s definitely seen this recording, so if it was a lie he would have said something
---

---
Have you ever been in the default npc corp chat and listened to the people in there?
---
/r/Eve is surprisingly similar to that chat.
---
playing.
---
My theory is the drifters are here to kill all unused POS.  The same day the drifters came, SiSi removed POS Dogma.
---
This aligns with the 'single strike' mechanic, as it will eventually kill all non-active pos.
---
If you converted delve into a bunch of what you consider "properly sized entities", each with their own astrahus, then you'd still have like 20 people per system (with tons of alts), and that means they'd have to take turns for at least one hour a day, around the clock, to gun the damn structure (or at least be online to get notifications). 
---
Or they put themselves at the risk of someone turning up for the armor timer and not having a fleet formed for it, so then they have only 1 timer left to actually defend their structure. 
---
What a PITA.
---
im not in pirate the alliance i am a low sec pirate there is a deference and yes me and my friends haunt null all the time
---
I never said it was easy; I described something that was simple.
---
'haunt' null? I'm not overly concerned about a Tristan or a comet coming to null honestly
---
I wish this was true.
---
" i am a low sec pirate  " I invite you to start trying to bash these structures, let's see how long you last.
---
I wish the irony in this post was a general truth.
---
maybe there are just too many structures to reasonably justify defending by one group and that's the actual reason gunners are getting burnt out
---
Yeah, I'd sooner lose a dozen titans then become one of those people that invest a shit ton of isk into something they're too afraid to do anything remotely risky with.
---
Lmao that's called throwing a tantrum.
---
Sounds reasonable.
---
I still think Mitten's plan is a logistical nightmare that will be impossible to deliver. I honestly don't think there's enough ammo in New Eden to see it through, and the wardeck mechanics (unless I misunderstand them) will just see highsec industrialists pull down their structures for a little bit and move a few jumps further out... They'll cry a bit, but no more than they already do when you gank their freighters.
---
Plus, if Mittens thinks Drifters is a game of whack-a-mole, just wait 'til he tries to burn anything other than 'just' Jita. He'll have you hop, skipping, and jumping all over the bloody map just to feel a bit better.
---
How will you know if you've 'won' or 'lost'?
---
Is that oven stable? Looks like it's only about 1:30... less if you overheat it.
---
Losing one naga is more then losing 40 corms tho.
---
No, seriously, wtf did they cancel?
---
You should run 4 in the mids, they don't have a stacking penalty
---
This is why megacoalitions are cancerous - you feed the egos of manchildren and they think they matter and throw silly tantrums
---
Had a decent turnout tonight in Charlotte!  Thanks for coming out everyone!
---
Would be an ironic turn off the be expansion's name
---
where did i say bash a structures i said i would kill your renters
---
This guy uses near2
---
Ikitursa
---
lol you watch to many twitch streams not all of us fly Tristans but hey if it helps you sleep at night then thats good
---
Your right, the rest of you fly botting ventures farming lp
---
You don't need cutting edge machine learning AI to achieve this. You could use anything as simple as Q-Learning or you could go full on neural networks, it doesn't really matter how they do it. Point is that the policy creation is affected by the players but not by some scripted recipe that someone came up with.
---
OTEC did drive the price of tech up from 80k / unit to 200k / unit over time.
---
Industry carried on, prices adjusted, a larger proportion of industry ISK went the CFC (and other tech moon owner) pockets than before.
---
lol ok your right but im not in faction warfare last i heard delve was where all the bots were
---
The stat's say otherwise much like I've been on too many streams, you've been reading to much reddit..  Funny how that misinformation works eh
---
mittins said it must be true
---
OP just the kind of jawn that posts in /r/evejobs whining because he "doesn't like to use a mic" and "I'm a father and my wife's a cunt and I gosh darnit just want to mine in high sec".
---
Ccp* said it, but equally a random redditor said you don't all use Tristans n comets and farm lp with ventures so that must be true right?
---
Basically they hey are reducing the heavy drone capacity from 5 to 3, and giving it some repair bonus, the thing is that it will get nerfed to the ground for ratting, some people are looking for myrmidons or dominix instead.
---
I've tried to d-scan discord in eve channels leading to everyone asking where I am and what I caught thinking I was putting W's.
---
ok one more time im not in faction warfare so how am i farming lp
---
damn, you mean like.... once in awhile you might have to do something for a few minutes to keep billions of risk-free isk on the field and not dying?
---
fuckin crazy tbh
---
imagine like... a safe place for hundreds of structures to just exist with no risk at all, wouldn't that be the dream
---
you're "not" making yourselves look stupid?
---
idk man, everyone seems to disagree.
---
Basically anything that Mittens says nowadays is top level 2019 cringe.
---
You said your low sec, your all the same to me like how all goons are the same to you..  Again I refer back to my previous line of 'its amazing how misinformation works isn't it'
---
yeah 60 of 1000 is a HUGE amount
---
/s
---
Had a blast catching up with a good friend and meeting a couple of new ones. Thanks for organizing this.
---
I feel like it would definitely be worth everyone's time and effort for the memes and propaganda alone.  The more I think about it, the more I hope it happens.
---
i don't judge all goons the same i actually have no issue with the line goon its your leadership i don't like i have a few friends in goons
---
The old account is now alpha, there is no time limit on playing it anymore and can be used for free. 
---
You can link your Eve account to Steam I havent done this, and see no reason to. I dont know if it is a useful thing to do.
---
As to your characters, However, the oldest ones started with either 50k sp, or 400k sp. New characters start with 600k. You may want to fly around on the older character to blow up or whatever while training the new character. It really doesnt matter.
---
Many years ago, when horde was still in its infancy. I was leading a group of new beans around null. Someone from PL requested I divert the fleet to help cover their move op. I kept it a secret until we got there. It was a good feeling hearing how excited they were seeing so many supers at one time. Little did they know it was my first time seeing a real move op that size.  I plaid it off like it was a usual thing for me. This was before injectors
---
That's hot.
---
I’ve found out that there are 4 of us in a 30 mile radius of Columbia SC, so hopefully we can all form up and head that way next month!!
---
I'm not flairbaiting. 
---
I'm saying that just because Gobbins isn't making himself look like a moron, doesn't mean he isn't working with Mittens on this "OTEC 2.0"
---
but that's all it is. it's the first time ever that ccp has interfered with nullsec wars. besides, all it's gonna do is make nullsec groups, especially small groups, stay at home eo defend, rather than going out for pvp
---
This event is the gift that keeps on giving
---
Perfect! Hope to see you there!
---
what im here from ppl in the the null block not everybody on board.
---
Now the rreal question what if hs respond by make plex price go up to 10 bil or 30 bill?
---
Much like real life if you take only the one source as your 'information' you're going to have a very radical biased view, take redditors who only have here as their info or goons who only have the in house forums or 'pick your alliance and their main source of propaganda ' this goes with the public opinion of goon leadership too..  At the end of the day regardless how they go about doing it, they want to generate fun content for line members to keep them active, to keep funds  flowing and these days the more radical, the more of a reaction and in turn the bigger the turn out
---
pls upvote
---
Do what you want to do in game not what others want or need you to do. As eve is a game you play to have fun, not a job/lifestyle and there are thousands of different ways to play it to have fun.  
---
As for in game stuff learn to manually pilot your ship, use the tactical overlay (Q command) and think of tracking in terms of triangles (basic trigonometry concepts, no math needed).
---
Sounds like a trap I downvoted to be safe
---
yeah, but for real, what got cancelled?
---
I'll let you take some time on this one there sport
---
Man, I wish that wasn't the closest one I have seen to Wilmington. A bit too much of a hike for just a small meet up...
---
so curious hypothetical  question what happens hs peep twisted the knife in the plex market  and make plex cost 10 to 30 bil?
---
My bad :(
---
&gt;no
---
I've been pulling away from eve to the point of leaving the dogs and squads I'm part of in goons but I might stick around a bit longer if this narrative plays out as planned
---
Yes. Why the fuck would you drop a wall of text without a tldr? I’m having to read every comment just to be able to get an idea of what I couldn’t be bothered to read above.
---
Discount Jin'taan
---
I had a blast!
---
Ccp and the rest of us don’t want to have eve ruined, we just want the game ruined for goons. 
---
Somehow I don’t think they like the feeling of that shoe on that foot.
---
By definition yes
---
You really dont have room to talk tbh
---
I saw the ping just as I was leaving work to go home. My first thought was well, crud, I'm going to miss out on a titan kill. I get home about 20 minutes later, and log in just to see what's going on, and hear about the different fleets around. Thanks to TiDi I was able to hop into a Ferox, and join in on the fun. There were so many/big targets I ran out of 2 different types of ammo. :)
---
Thanks for bringing everyone to BWF /u/ccp_alpha You're welcome anytime.
---
I remember (I think from a fanfest video) that ccp does not worry so much about balance.  This was said around 10 years ago if memory serves.
---
Early June Goon Narrative: Goons don't tire of shooting structures.  
---
Late June Goon Narrative: TEST tires of shooting NPCs.
---
:thonking:
---
I just started playing this weekend. This meme reads like a foreign language lol. Can someone translate please?
---
ok well you and goons have fun killing all of high and low im going to be rolling in the floor laufeing as you fail
---
ITT people taking Mittens/Goon hurfing and blurfing way. way too seriously.
---
If you’ve got a carrier pilot a c5-c5 would be better since you can scan with 1 character and roll with a single ship as a side note OP
---
did somebody say jita plan?
---
Its not really about failing is it? Market manipulation is very real and with deep enough pockets any market can be changed, do I believe we'll destroy all highsec structures... Nope, some key ones maybe but its market manipulation that will affect all of high n low but that's not a line member game if you don't have a couple hundred bil to burn then it's not your war to fight
---
At least its the good kind of grr goons and not the bad kind now.
---
I'm sorry, but, what?? 
---
What exactly do you think I said? What conversation are you taking part in?
---
The biggest takeway I have from that speech is the point of "If I can't do what I want then nobody gets to do what they want." With a side order of going out of the way to attack people entirely disconnected from the problem he has to deal with, and then blame them for making him do that to them.
---
Did Mittani just become the abusive boyfriend of New Eden?
---
"I can't be shit if you're shit"
---
Null entities will drop a full rigged t2 combat fortizar just to travel through a system once...
---
Thanks for posting
---
that's funny, coming from PL.
---
Bitch we all can
---
I think CCP is reacting to the constant banter and negativity from the community. It's my guess they're just fed up having to hear every single whine from every aspect of this game every day for 16 years. 
---
This is CCP saying... "If you don't like it, go play WoW."
---
If you can't produce at cost 5% below Jita price, then you would make more money importing.
---
you realize nullsec makes the game, right. there really isn't an eve without null
---
this is CCP saying "If you don't like it, go play WoW, but 170 times a day, in eve"
---
but is this how we want the game to be? it's supposed to be player interaction, not raid bosses
---
The fact these programs exist is so sad.
---
The frigates who join the fight die because their noob asses warped to  0 on a keepstar with the PDS firing...  No fucking titans are going to be shooting frigates in a big fight unless the fight is a show and all the pilots are bored waiting on a fucking damage cap with nothing to do.
---
The Organization of Logistical Material Exporting Corporations.
---
&gt; and the wardeck mechanics (unless I misunderstand them) will just see highsec industrialists pull down their structures for a little bit and move a few jumps further out... 
---
Structure rigs can easily outstrip the value of the structure itself.  I don't think anyone would mind all that much if they wanted to spare everyone the hassle of timers and essentially self destruct the lion's share of the value.  
---
Also, provided enough of NS were onboard, they don't have to actually shoot anything at all.  Just stop delivering raw materials to Jita.  Null doesn't need anything from HS, material wise.  Given a large enough cartel, null could essentially push material costs up to the point where profitable production is impossible in high sec without ever firing a shot.
---
He could just sell jars of mittens crybaby tears.
---
usually when ccp do something dumb and null sec screeches about it, they just double down instead of caving.
---
Another half assed event by CCP. Nothing will come of it.
---
It’s a play on words to sound like OTEC, so it should probably stay as 4 letters. But Organization of Mineral Exporting Corporations works fine
---
There are some solid tactical tips in here so I'll just add two ways to learn quickly -- buy a ton of the ships you want to fly and go welp them, and fly with people who are better than you.
---
Does that mean ccp will spawn us in some trig t2 bpos?  I'm down

I mean it's pretty interesting how true this is. The viceroy program (although that failed/got scrapped) is basically what BoB tried to do, and what they're doing in the North right now is eerily reminiscent of MAX. The whole rebrand as "The Imperium" and putting on an evil galactic empire persona in order to provoke conflict and drama was something BoB did. Leadership takes the game about as seriously as BoB did, with the same goals of unchallenged galactic supremacy and figuring out how to use and exploit mechanics in the most efficient way possible to achieve that goal.
---
The only difference at this point, besides attitude, is that BoB was about being the elite few and GSF is all about strength in numbers. TEST is more Goonswarm than Goonswarm is these days.
---
Here's a mirror https://youtu.be/oL2B-AAnsHo?t=21
---
You don't have the funds to do that lol.. Do you realise the financial cost to manipulate that? There is no highsec entity with that backing
---
Bless you. In the name of the Mittani, et GigX, et Maximus Singularity.
---
"Mandatory" is a good way of describing it. Mandatory and annoying as it serves no real purpose. The reward is time I wasted, that could have been spent fighting people. Or maybe fighting a pve entity that rewards you with something rather than absolutely nothing of note.
---
Because, rabble rabble grr goons rabble rabble all goon names I know rabble rabble grr goons
---
Yes, along with offline/low-power jammers and beacons.
---
Unfortunately this BR tool tends to reset the chosen sides as new killmails trickle in. Very annoying. Was no doubt correct when he posted it.
---
No highsec entity has the fund to manipulate that, but please try
---
You doubting me? Lmao
---
Except at its core, TACO is a text parsing program. It just takes the information people type in the channel and displays it with a UI and makes some beeping noises. There’s no esi endpoint, there’s no special favoritism that allows TACO and not a program for indices. 
---
You could literally build an application to do what you’re asking for in the exact same way TACO accomplishes its goals. So either you weren’t aware of how TACO operates or you’re being intentionally daft.
---
They wouldn't really need to recruit him for that. Just follow him around with a few hics or something. It's been done before.
---
We're all gay for jay, what's new?
---
If they were not in your fleet, but you chose not to shoot them, then you are no longer NPSI and should just join their Alliance.
---
You are not an NPSI group though if you are not shooting people outside of your fleet. Or do you not understand the concept?
---
"don't ping to undock"
---
"people don't undock enough"

Pick one. Stop ruining people's fun.
---
You didn't answer the question,  whats cancelled?
---
You clearly ignored the anology. I was using ships as an example for the state of New Eden Alliances. Titan vs Titan would be coalitions fighting each other with no gains or changes. The Frigate anology was someone from renters or QFC trying to take soverenity outside of a larger Alliance.
---
&gt; But if you are struggling you might want to question if your impact is beyond your means.
---
Name me a major nullsec entity that is currently "struggling" due to this Drifter invasion.
---
Actually doing this
---
Could be interesting. I have serious doubts about such a bloc being formed when pesky Russians (insert other nationalist alternatives) may simply prefer to milk the now-monopoly cow for mineral supply to hisec, resulting in jealousy in the ranks, 'leaking' of minerals from stockpiles, and a need to turn your eyes back homeward to assess the risk of betrayal from opportunistic 'allies'.
---
I wait to be surprised, but I think Mittens is dreaming too big, and wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was called-off in the planning stages.
---
Given that high sec relies on imports from null give it a few months of just a 20% drop in materials incoming how many high sec industrialists will be able to stay within there margins with costs climbing
---
Been yelled at in local for 20 minutes by a testy until they actually messaged me directly.  
---
Not afk, not botting, just not leaving a giant hole on my UI 24/7.
---
I never said they where, but at some point one must question if they should. The goal of my fictional speculation is that Drifters could be used to keep soverenity expansion relative to military power. The hope is it would encourage more diverse alliances in nullsec rather than having to join an existing mega alliance. Like let's say you're an alliance just leaving QFC or renting... what are you options? You get pulled into a larger alliance that is part of a larger coalition many of which will not allow you to hold soverenity only for you to get sucked into larger conflicts with no actual change... I actually think Space Monkeys have changed more soverenity than most major alliances. They may keep getting their ass kicked out of Querious but at least something is happening.
---
oh, well by all means go ahead
---
Look, just tell us what got canceled and nobody gets hurt alright?
---
No supers in high sec, so if a couple other nullsec alliances wardec goons this could become the first actual war in years.
---
Everything. It's all gone. Ever last ting... They boke
---
Of course he isnt.
---
Learn how to play the game. Basics I learned starting in 07/08 are apparently difficult things now that even super pilots don't understand. You can pump dollars into the game to get whatever you want, but you will always look stupid when you don't know what you are doing with those dollars.
---
you didnt rebuild shit, you ruined the original spirit of spectre fleet after most original FCs either burnt out, left the game, or just didnt want to deal with your retarded ass.
---
i was just curious
---
frankly im terrible at market, i was more curious than anything
---
The amount of funds it would take to have a meaningful impact on plex is more than the combined wealth of 'most' of highsec combined, your also competing with an ever growing supply since a swipe of the cc produces more.. So although if all large market players decided tomorrow in unison to fuck plex they'd achieve nominal results it would be raising it by a very small % certainly never 1000%
---
Maybe just because you didn’t really prove anything lol you are just ranting
---
&gt; yeah but people support the dumb ai mechanic simply because it makes ~~people~~ goons salty
---
FTFY

Wrong comment

I hear the latest craze to cure autism involves drinking bleach, perhaps thats a good place to start :D

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
I think its just supposed to be ironic at this point.
---
kk makes since. tbh i think goon are wasting there time and make them self look thin skin compared to old goons
---
What
---
Have you seen a dead structure yet other than ansiblex? No. Dudes freaked out but no one has even seen them come to finish a job yet. You could literally ignore them 99% the time and not have an issue. 
---
Even then a solo guy in a citadel can kill them. Not that threatening. 
---
Maybe in a week I'll sing a different tune but talk about gross over reaction. They are great for killing afk ratters, botters, and rf'ing low power structures. Hopefully ccp fine tunes them a bit instead of full rng into a tattooed l targeted incursion and ups the damage they can do.
---
Ultimately the opinion of highsec players or really any non goon is irrelevant,  and one thing to remember is goons are by no means poor even the most biased redditor will not believe goons are poor, if the war is on the Jita market you'll feel that im afraid
---
"WAAAAH WHY DIDN'T THEY SPAWN NEAR MEEEEEE"
---
i know i was a goon  for a short while nor do i live in hs. i dont hate goons per se since the ones i was with were cool and few have helped me in the past. this whole ordeal has got me going wat?
---
Everything isn't cancelled! You're lieing, whats really cancelled though
---
The name's a bit crap, but I like where your head is. I think "The Great Embargo" has a nice ring to it.
---
We had a wormhole btw there :) it was a lot of fun
---
&gt;because all of the nullsec leaders are throwing a hissy fit
---
Are they though?
---
LOLOL CCP BOWING TO SPACE LEADERS AMIRITE
---
Just adapt. Recruit even more people to operate the citadels.
---
*sniff* muh jukebox... They cancelled muh jukebox... *Sniff*
---
It’s going to be funny as ever when his plans have 0 effect on anything. If he is right and ccp is “targeting” them they simply won’t let the market fail it’s going to be such a great lol
---
I have same bug. There is some contract I accepted but never finished. Its been 1.5 years, it bugs me ever since, I just ignore it.
---
I think if ccp is in fact going after goons they want hs to band together and revolt against goons. It could be done
---
Wait hold up there one second.
---
Did you just say that the overriding fear here is that Goons... you know, the Goons Who Live in Delve... will *burn out* over shooting NPCs?
---
Play for a while and gain an understanding of how the game works before you try and piece it together.  We could be here a while trying to get you to understand all the moving pieces
---
Shitty posts for shitty ideas belong in the eve official forums that way &gt;&gt;&gt;
---
You've thrown boxed Purifier fleets around for years. If anyone should know the fun in doing the same thing over and over again, it's you.
---
Ccp is not going after goons... Its null sec, and if you think highsec can team up n take down null, you're more delusional than the reddit version of mittani
---
thats what i tell newbros as well after i give 10-20 fitted atrons, i noticed newbros stay in the game once they gotten over the fear of loss.
---
Lol not in a combat sense but there has to be something that the high sec players provide for null that we take for granted. If that thing gets cut off things could get interesting.
---
No, there isn't that's the nature of highsec it's the 'safe' space
---
It’s also where lots of the logistics of the game happen. I reckon that the back bone of most null groups economy derive from a high sec means
---
 I am in a nullsec alliance, I know what people fly and it's a lot of 300m isk munins. A small skirmish does not involve losing an entire munin fleet. Unless you are in an alliance that feeds a metric shit ton a small skirmish doesn't mean 100-200b isk. (and that's probably a low class wh)
---
No, they don't lol
---
#PuBbIe
---
The problem is not that groups are trying and getting killed.  The problem is they don't even try.  
---
There are two sides to this coin.  Game Mechanics, and player actions.  
---
Game Mechanics have always allowed the larger to stop the smaller.  This is why low sec was always prominent in early eve history, as it was a foothold for smaller groups to assault null sec space.  There was a mechanics gap between the two regions, and this gap effects the power multipliers like bubbles, area attacks, bases of operations, attack vectors, etc.  
---
Current mechanics allow easy access to nullsec for small groups.  This is not really used by new groups, rather they are used by established groups to fight as 'special ops' groups.  In other words, the powerful groups use the mechanics the best, in either direction.  
---
The other side of the coin, is player actions.  In the last few years, the QFC renters have actually fought off 'large established groups' like those who reside in the north.  Now granted, neither side had super capitals to my knowledge, and that is a consequence of geography and politics, not game-mechanics.
---
In this case, one mega group has declared they will not purge small groups who live in a certain area.  This is very standard, as large groups need zones of exclusion and such to prevent strategic strain and stress for no reason.
---
The main reason the QFC is functioning is because of the 'hands off approach'.  Otherwise they would just be another rental empire.
---
I have same issue
---
Lol QQ you might actually have to play the damn game
---
? I'm just saying gobbins isnt working with mittens. It's a pretty weird speculation to make.
---
I already wanted to upvote you and then followed the link and saw how low effort the fix was. Maybe move the kills which dont relate to the fight (rattlesnake, confessor, probably more) to a third column.
---
Hostile hel.
---
Welpests &lt;3
---
twist that knife twist it good
---
Best thing to do is to broadcast them
---
According to the soundcloud, they were talking together about working to mess with the hisec industry stuff. I don't think Mittens would lie about something so easy to disprove
---
I don't get out of bed for less than five faction titans tbh?
---
i can go longer with out playing than you can so go for it
---
go for it
---
I think he went alpha IRL.
---
&gt;how many high sec industrialists will be able to stay within there margins with costs climbing
---
Is this a bait? The price of everything will rise and we'll be at the same spot just everything is a bit more expensive. Also there're gonna be so many people ignoring their alliances and still moving shit to hisec to make a larger profit it I dont think much will really change tbh. 
---
Hell, the prices might not even shift that much which is fucking hilarious really. That's assuming null doesnt start big time selling and moving from their own hubs instead of 4-4, which is a big assumption. What percentage of produced ships die in null? 
---
If there aren't enough ships produced in home regions then null players will start buying from 4-4, which fucks their line members. Then players see how much profit they could make so they start selling from their bloc to 4-4, which takes ships away from the region, which again fucks null linemembers. 
---
Basically any way you cut it; Mittens' war against hi sec is just gonna fuck his linemembers' wallets and they're too dumb to realize it
---
This is some combination of Poe's law and the inevitability of using a word seriously after using it ironically enough times.
---
you keep that thought home girl i repete i just wont play eve sp n pain to me
---
i also think you over state how just how inporent you are
---
Im not important,  no individual person is important.. What's important is a group of people working in unison
---
for the not-extremely-new pilots: "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" dorsn't mean isk only. 
---
evaluate your emotional readiness to lose a cerain ship and act accordingly . E.g first time t3c losses are known to have a high impact even though you afford a spare or two
---
Not really we can already make most of what we need locally and region stuff we just buy from other null powers in bulk a lot of the nullsec groups are working on this and the only thing we are exporting is the end product
---
Take half a dose. And tell me the name of what you are having.
---
Hordes not gonna work with goonies on this.
---
&gt;and the only thing we are exporting is the end product
---
And how much of that comes right back to null? I'd wager a huge percent seeing as null is what % of the player base? 
---
Also if you stop exporting then the price in 4-4 goes up so people will be more likely to export ships there instead of keeping then in the null hubs thus ruining the whole plan. Or do you think nobody in delve buys caps to sell at a profit.
---
This is exactly why I liked the idea behind the skill system in DUST514 when it was around. Similar to eve, but you got skillpoints for playing matches instead of just waiting for skills, and then allocate them to skills. Players felt engaged, and rewarded for playing even if you didn't win your match.
---
One is; for sure.
---
Certainly not having any Walking In Stations... Or DUST 514. *uncontrollable sobbing*
---
... and i am just sitting here tending my wormhole like it's my personal zen garden, not caring about anything of this.
---
Nobody wants to admit it but the skill/progression system is completely fucked-up in this game. Which literally wrecks player retention, as was shown in a recent CCP presentation. Ninety percent of the new players simply uninstall within a week: 
---
* Skill progression should be active, not passive: Play more in a certain role to progress.
---
* Skill progression should not so much make you stronger but open up new playstyles.
---
* The barrier for new players to get anywhere near competitive is simply way too high. This espially goes for the frigate class. As an alpha, you can't even max out a single frigate role, which is just stupid. Frigate PVP should be low-risk, low-reward. Not high-risk, low-reward.
---
The amount of salt generated by Goons, if collected will buid a new planet.  So much whining from the small folk.
---
Beautiful spin to justify hitting HS when about none of the dude enjoying the drifters lives here
---
To be honest that could have saved him, Nado should normally be able to warp off before it dies to gate guns, but it can’t do that if there’s a tackle frigate in a close orbit
---
You should avoid fly safe.
---
High sec is dumb
---
Did they remove the drifter hive thing from the tutorials? It was there last time I made an alt
---
no you have never been relevant
---
You cut me deep, it's like we were never in the same alliance.
---
You have too much space to defend against NPCs lol   “Adapt or die”
---
But then how am I supposed to flex on these pubs?
---
Station walking.
---
technically they could surround and then gank just outside of starter systems :P
---
"You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain"
---
This recording is full of so much herp derp.
---
and that in and of itself is telling isnt it? 
---
  
---
So starved for a shake up, we get happy and then inevitably disappointed.
---
Goons have been pretty honest with it. They do what they (or their leadership) want. And they have the means to do almost anything in this game.
---
Speaking of majority of players. Where did you get that from? I don't think that majority of nullsec players likes grinding through constantly respawning NPC fleets. Highsec, lowsec, and J-space isn't affected by it, so I don't think they can enjoy it in anyway because they don't take part in it.
---
It's a sandbox, and yet you say that people shouldn't do what they want, just because you said so? That's what I call toxic.
---
If it's a sandbox, and players want do to something, and they have will and ability do do so, why shouldn't they don't that. If all of big null block leaders decided that highsec will burn, and that they have ability to make it so, then so be it. 
---
Sandbox belongs to people that can take it. And now it looks like the biggest bully will piss on other kids toys. 
---
Enjoy your game.
---
I think you'd rather be out making it dangerous for my structures, and vice versa. Instead of having some artificial entity making it dangerous for me to leave to attack you, and vice versa. 
---
Why don't they instead show up at your doorstep in the event that you did not kill a titan this month under your enemy's supercap umbrella? :P
---
&gt; I still think Mitten's plan is a logistical nightmare that will be impossible to deliver
---
they literally run away from north, because the FCs were getting tired from the structure bash
---
Mittens: lets structure bash high sec :P
---
I think the skill points give a bit more guidance for players to move through things instead of just jumping up to stuff too fast.
---
Absolutely. The amount of insane doomsaying over some smaller events we didn't even know the full scope of (and still don't) was crazy.
---
Every position should have been tentative pending more information, but instead people were going full-bore to either side.
---
goons literally run away from north, because the FCs were getting tired from the structure bash
---
day later Mittens: lets structure bash the high sec :P
---
Ok drifter invasion hype seems to have been short lived
---
*newbro loses overpriced space ship and can't get it replaced, proceeds to ask for ISK in rookie help channel*
---
Dont sweat it about the bounty. I set one on every new bro I see so I know when they die. Then i can message them and see if they need help.
---
All valid objections, but that is what makes it an interesting proposition. Made even more interesting since sworn enemies did not have to be drafted for it with the phrase "join or else".
---
did you just unironically call someone "ningen"? jesus christ....
---
Dude stop lying see went back to deal with the drifter menace
---
Is this that same loser who's been crying all over the place because the rats are better at this game than he is?
---
&gt;PvE is not done in T3s anyways.
---
Wait? No Tengu anymore?
---
Baited on a...
---
I mean, by all means be proud of what you have earned. But people who act like they're hot stuff because they have a green KB are really cringey.
---
This sounds a whole heck of a lot like the AI behavior for the NPC Sotoiyos. The roaming Diamond Sanshas/Guristas reinforce any structures they come across (albeit not as fast as the Drifters), but they don't intelligently schedule their actions. They're just a force of destruction randomly going from place to place.
---
The term is app champ:
---
App Champ; a guy that joins the biggest most successful group then declares victory, when in reality the only thing he did was apply.
---
Oh God, that was the most pitiful thing I've ever listened to. The only people that are going to suffer if he demands his coalition stop making ISK is him and people making bank from RMT. The rest of the cluster will simply shrug and continue playing as it always has.
---
 **@everyone** I know we have people who are hanging around we need numbers  get in fleet and lets go   
---
Oh look. People are already bored. Downvote my point some more though.
---
Just out of curiosity, is it possible the Drifters might attack The Forge any time soon?
---
NCPL never reached even remotely close to the currently level of blues/super capital spam that currently exists in the game. Anyone saying otherwise is absolutely allowed to be wrong but that doesn't change reality. The closest the game has been to this state was the era of BoB and BoB only died because it self destructed.
---
but mines the GREENEST killboard!!!
---
I used a venture to get over 100b in killmails in a single day!!!
---
I just ECM bursted on a lowsec event fleet with a super cap and a bunch of different cruiser fleets.
---
dont @ me
---
Venture is best DPS ship. Don't @ me.
---
It definitely keeps pulling after the first reinforce. Moon mining drill is a service mod, and those stay online until the armor is down (structure reinforce). After that I assume the rock gets lost, as your service module goes offline, but I don't know for sure.

---
No and no
---
Harden the fuck up.
---
&gt; EvE is a sandbox  
---
&gt; Just stop being such egoistic bastards  
---
I'm confused. Is it sandbox or not?
---
So your NPSI organisation forms for offensive sov timer, is abandoned by your RC overlords and then you come to reddit to cry about how the defenders formed alot more than you and dumpstered you?  
---
   
---
Not sure if you understand this part of eve - when your sov is under attack you form to defend it, not our fault if spectre is shit.
---
Is 6000 citadels in one region how we want the game to be?
---
It's short of 'cynosural beacon'. It's a module you can fit to any ship, and you can activate it to light the beacon for 10 minutes, using liquid ozone as fuel. Once you light it, any ship in your fleet with a jump drive (capital ships, jump freighters, black ops battleships) can jump to your location from any system in range. The range differs based on ship type and skills, but is generally around 6-8 light-years, which is a little more than the average region. 
---
Titans and battleships can also use the beacon to create a jump bridge, allowing other ships in the fleet to use the titan's jump drive and jump to your location, instead of the titan itself.
---
I lost a battleship in lowsec once and I was orbital for a year.
---
Finally someone invading us! About time someone grew some balls!
---
These drifters don't even drop loot.  
---
It's a fucking chore.  
---
"Do this, or you are screwed."
---
I just put up a few T2 BPCs I found up for auction in Jita, does this effect me? Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening to me to the people that bid on my stuff?
---
That's just not going to happen. If you guys were so bored by a war over resources and territory that you used rats tickling your shields as an excuse to give up, there's no way you're gonna bash structures for literally no reward. I know you're gonna want to argue you'd do it for the tears, but the structure spam is so atrocious that you'd be averaging 1 tear every 3 weeks.
---
You can’t just say you couldn’t play and go on a rant, your not telling anyone what it was doing when it wouldn’t run.
---
You have other problems, first of which is your troubleshooting skill and ability to communicate tech issues with people that might try to help.
---
Aye, i never tried it, but that sounds like a lot of fun! Will have to dust off the scanning skills as I haven't wormholed in a while...
---
Isn't everything arbitrary busy work?
---
I reimbursed the last one I killed, he got caught in our gate camp in his very pooy fit scan ship, tried to convo him with advice, but nothing.
---
Perhaps consider that participation is commensurate with the perceived value of what is being saved.
---
Sorry about all your vanity fortizars, I guess.
---
Check that system around the time of the kills. 99%, it's a Wormhole system and there'll be a completely random Astrahus or Fortizar that got blown up about 10 minutes before the lossmail spam.
---
I think if whoever wins it actually accepts it it goes away, but I'm not sure.

7. Fleet sizes moved from FC's not been able to get anyone to prime time fleets of 100
---
8.  Revamp of event fleets including ganked jnr and ustz ganked
---
9. Additional Null Campaign content under normal operations 
---
10. Official NPSI alliance created and running successfully with most if not all NPSI leadership part of it.   
---
The list is pretty substantial and although I don't mind you trolling me or just directly been a cunt for the sake of it. I will not have you talk trash about NPSI nor will I allow for slander or false narrative on the hard work many, many people have put into resurrecting a dying creed of NPSI.

He also organised an official policy of spamming local with "BEEP BEEP I'M A TRUCK" to mock a dead player.
---
Rattles and Nestors are at the top end of PVE, all the hardcore PVP folks are T3Cs, Triglav ships, and Cepters, at least that what Scary Wormhole People just rolled through with.
---
Holy shit is it actually possible to believe this shit? Imagine actually being so retarded that you drink this koolaid.
---
Or maybe people overhype everything? If players were so starved for a shave up they'd shake the sandbox themselves.
---
I absolutely agree. And not for intelligence purposes. It would allow me to do more interesting things on the mapping side if I could see individual indexes, instead of just the ADM. Being able to see the alliance capitals would be nice as well.
---
Mandatory '' fuck Erebus '', even in the wrong sub.
---
Well we are not shooting people inside the fucking fleet :'D Under this same principle does this mean we have to engage everything outside of fleet? Do we get the option to not shoot something because the fleet is unable to take it? What if  2 fleets are on grid do we shoot both at the same time? Do tell one of them to wait whilst we fight one :) I thought they stopped making people like you.... Who is still breading these people?  
---
I will not be a dick and give you a straight answer though. If working with another entity is in the best interest of said fleet, it is up to the FC to make that call... so be it.  
---
The provi Campaign is only additional content we wish to show our members on how sov mechanics work. This is a very new concept for NPSI and does require a higher level of orginization and coordination. If you dont want sov mechanic based fleets join the other 30 fleets that week that have nothing to do with the campaign.

I've been gone for two years. What's mittens on about now?
---
New discord has more people because you forced everyone to move there, so you could be the admin.
---
Unification of all npsi pvp groups? Sorry what? Bombers Bar is independent of Spectre and Redemption Road is dead soooo what other npsi pvp groups are there?
---
80 man command team for an NPSI organization thats literally supposed to be pickup PvP. Lmao. I guess everyone wants to have cool colors and titles on discord.
---
Daily spectre fleets were a thing before you, you didnt create that.
---
Ganked fleets down from full fleets to barely 70, with the occasional 100.
---
Null Campaign from an NPSI group, definitely not what the original idea of the group was supposed to be. Jayne tried the idea of an npsi alliance too, and it fell apart because its a dumb idea that will eventually implode on itself.
---
Im sorry did you post without reading? This fleet was not a form for an offensive timer... We were in catch fighting legacy. :facepalm: then came up for the GF's. Who in their right mind would form a 50-70 man harb gang agaisnt 100+ munnin fleet. Get a grip.

Jayne did a lot that didnt work out for him, including spectre fleet itself.
---
Also an NPSI alliance like HTP? Or TA? my dear lord seriously i dont do reddit much, is this what you all have to deal with? FML
---
1. that's mostly the problem why not much content is going on, cause lazy pilots just blobing, and the crying about blobing and no content.
---
2. system was jammed.
---
That's what the BWF-1DQ Axis would like you to think...
---
Reddit *obviously* is filled with HS people.
---
It could be decided based on metrics that are related to activity, in some way
---
just spend about 23 minutes of never getting back lifetime on it, and i am so glad i never was in goons to keep up with these announcements, and a leader who loves to hears himself speaking and selling other persons ideas/infos as his own.

seeing as no one is complaining they shot their POS that would make this the dumbest attempt by CCP to achieve an in game result ever.

Regarding the second thing, ok yeah you relay pings for those dudes (totally forgot about bjorn bees stuff), the rest are literaly who?

HTP is not an NPSI alliance you mango. Who is TA?

Jayne's Spectre 2014-2016 is much better than your current abortion, you power hungry retard.

When they log in, all goons turn towards the geographical location of The Mittani and do their bee but dance right there on the spot.

Source: i witnessed my self and was entranced.
---
This is my view on the situation. Yeah, I love the fact that there’s essentially a defence tax on structure spam, but I hate the idea that the mechanic is entirely PvE based
---
I think that’s really it. It’s too easy to be bored in Eve if you don’t know what you’re doing.

He is right thou...

weren't you shitting on me in my other thread for calling the drifter shit out as really fucking dumb?

Who? What?  seriously EH!

 Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance. People are far more stupid than they are evil.

There is already too much info outside the client, killing eve slowly.
---
Nahhh im DNR
---
Haha
---
He specifically excluded Plex, iirc.
---
They don't have to sit there contemplating which structure they strategically want to hit.     
---
CCP could have scripted them to return always or under conditions, like just one structure per system, or only the biggest/smallest in one system at a time.      
---
Of course that's still more work than "just a few lines of code", but hardly skynet level of AI.
---
As for changes to the server... Well they can of course also take their sweet time. I just don't think the whole drifter thing goes the way we thought at first, which is a shame.
---
You are wrong. Gobbins will happily work with goons if it makes him money.
---
Remember NC and our 484 dead  structures... yeah oh i am eating popcorn right now.

Reddit will be a salt mine with hisec the main manufacturer.

You do get that there isnt' a whole lot of HS people on reddit right ?
---
&gt; Give us your best Eve related jokes
---
typical /r/eve posting.
---
It's a good parallel
---
NPCs are trying to kick his castle but aren't very good at it and highsec carebears are laughing at them because those NPCs aren't hitting anyone in highsec and therefore highseccers won't have to deal with it. So now it's revenge time because his mighty empire isn't a laughing matter.
---
This is inaccurate.
---
The bulk SP packages should be more expensive and have a \*sale\* tag on them.
---
I use 2 accounts one alt that smartbombs prettyuch all the time and my main that chases the escalations down. With this setup i can run sites faster than i can spawn them so in between running my own escalations i buy 10/10 bms off contract, or run around in an astero hacking relics and looking for 6/8/10/10 scannable sites which i also run, as well as drone sites sometimes. If you dont want to do any of that and only wanted to smartbomb and run your own escalations, i would guess 2-3 alts bombing per 1 ded runner.
---
That's a closer! Shows over folks, thanks for coming and have a goodnight!
---
Horde calling someone else pets is pretty rich. You were founded in being pets of pets. Learn your history.
---
So is this also how freighter move their stuff around new eden?
---
Like they have many many alts and light these beacons and jump trough systems?
---
You're in luck! That system is already in place! Just go to Perimeter or Jita, there you can buy skill injectors, just apply then to the skill you want increased! If you don't have it, you can buy the skillbook from an npc station, another player or just buy it directly from your character sheet!

Mittens-&gt;English   
---
"This has been a nightmare on our logistics so we need to change our logistics which may result in some impact on the Jita market due to the emergent properties of our needed courses of action. This of course is not directed at high-sec in particular but I'm going to say it is to sound menacing because people don't take me seriously anymore."
---
Remove all functionality, timers, shields and resists from low power structures
---
If the game is feeling like work, maybe you are taking the wrong approach for your lifestyle. Eve can be played as frequently or infrequently as you want because your character continues training while logged off so there doesn’t need to be any grinding. Many don’t even farm ISK because they know a small plex investment makes more sense for them and ships can be very cheap.
---
Eve lends itself well to planning one day of play. You just need to plan out what you want to do in the game.
---
If you come back, join a corporation. EVE is best played in a group and those people will teach you how to play/what to train towards.
---
Why do you talk as if you actually matter? v0v
---
The real reason nobody is gonna do this is that it's trivial to get a spy in any null bloc it's more trivial to jump out minerals. 
---
So anybody not totally stupid can easily source there materials from null without the jita market and if the profit becomes good enough people will absolutely just jump it out themselves and sell it. 
---
You would need every line member on board with this and most are not loyal to your organization.
---
&gt; The gila is the swiss army knife of eve ships.
---
Hard disagree, T3s, specifically the Loki and Legion, do everything that a Gila can do and does nearly everything better, PvE? You can run higher-level sites in a T3 that you can’t in a Gila, PvP? They do often cost more, but T3s can be tankier, do equal or more DPS and have so many more viable fittings (dualrep brawl with AB, 50mn Kitey, 100mn overpropped, Heavy EWAR support, Links, Cloaky Logi), the only things a Gila can do better is skynetting drones and running low level DED sites that won’t accept a T3...
---
yeah i got done a few times, but thats how you learn, i did more killing than dying in ihakana
---
Yeah that's not bad actually.
---
Disagree, this encourages training into things that you’ll never use whilst not obtaining key skills, the magic 14 to all 5s is a good start and whilst you don’t want to tunnel vision your character, specialising early can get you into key ships quickly and effectively, notably stuff like Ceptors, Dictiors, Command Dessie’s (both Boosh and Links), T2 Logi and EWAR ships.
---
Fuck I was going to call my war update thread MAX II and forgot.
---
10/10
---
I don't think Mittens has enough control of his own members to pull this off tbh, let alone other null blocs. 
---
Like to disrupt a market you need people to ignore there own profit motive and most folks will not, there for the pressure is gonna be ever increasing on his members to break the boycott.
---
I don't support the new ai stuff because it irritates people, I support it because the game, particularly pve, is stale and has been for a long time. The game needs a good shake and if that starts in the form of NPCs attacking structures then so be it.
---
2 options: 
---
1. you pull it off and my karma toons make massive bank exporting.
---
2. You fail because people beat me to the punch and nothing changes.
---
The idea, that somehow GSF let alone groups like horde have enough control over there own market to prevent exports from taking place is really silly.
---
about 7-10 mil worth which is the battleship bounty in nullsec
---
Your shitty salvager loot is not what is getting withheld.. Haha jesus not to mention a few bil in loot is not going to make any dent.. How many reaction pos's are you running  karma man?
---
Not sure about this point too, worked 2 years ago with ESI. But even if, i never had to buy something to use it.

Thank you bot!
---
info: you are replying to a goon in post about goons leader v0v
---
Correct, almost all hauling/shipping in LS and NS is done via jump freighters. They have the biggest jump range in the game (10ly), so most routes only take a few cynos to traverse. You can do that with just one alt - you travel with your cheap cyno alt while your JF is safely docked, thus avoiding nearly all risk. Some use multiple alts or have their friends help them. 
---
For instance, this is the route you might take to get a JF from Jita to 1DQ1 - main Imperium staging: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/jump/Nomad,544/Jita:1DQ1-A 
---
You could also just take regular gates through Highsec to get closer before jumping out in order to minimize fuel consumption.
---
Sounds a lot like citadels.
---
You recruited all the highsec pubbies
---
I think Aryth can buy gofundme
---
A a
---
Where have the Goons hurt you?
---
Did the hel die at least for the amount of mistakes he made there? :P
---
Wow he knows it's a game right? FML some people need to stop taking this game so serious and  like it's real life..
---
You're not really a space tyrant and if you think you are check in to the nearest mental clinic
---
&gt; I don't think that majority of nullsec players likes grinding through constantly respawning NPC fleets
---
So when the content is what you want you to justify anything you do by 'being in a sandbox', but when CCP change the nature of that sandbox you cry foul? Sounds like you want to have your cake and eat it.
---
Most ironically Goons have been the number one Krabbers in Eve the last few years and now have the audacity to bitch about more PvE. Too funny.
---
But it's a sandbox right? You can still do what you want right?
---
I have Goons have a place to put all these minerals they are going to mine but not sell.
---
Yes
---
Don't wait for pings to undock
---
Makes sense on why your so upset haha low sec guy w ember sands was it? It's ok im sure all those jump freighter spy's you have in karma will make bank np 😁
---
I do wonder sometimes whether Mittani is kind of in on himself? Either that or he is a raging sociopath.
---
Those hips

... You do know that once an index hits five, it _doesn't_ go up, right?
---
God, I swear pubbies get dumber every year.
---
I have the same issue from about 18 months ago lol - i choose to ignore it now
---
The people who say that stuff are toxic and bored of how they play the game.

Null politics.
---
Can't do abyssals in a T3...
---
Ahahahaha
---
&gt; Thoughts? 
---
You are an idiot.
---
No its true. It was me, I was the fc. I got my energy back from moving. I mean, moving and recruiting, the 2 best things in EVE.
---
Good ol' narcissistic assholes with delusions of grandeur and complete detachment from reality (and empathy, but goes with being narcissistic). Leader of the biggest alliance (in a marginal game) as he may be, zero respect. Quite the contrary. Hell, makes me ashamed to have been on the same side of a war with GS back in the day.
---
&gt; Did Mittani *just* become the abusive boyfriend of New Eden?
---
hmm
---
Nullsec 2019. Nothing to see here
---
Cancel? I got the impression that folks (outside of Goonz) are looking for CCP to double down and make the Drifter invasion do more... No?
---
The truth of the whole thing is that 90% of the goonswarm federation are pubbies. The actual SA goons are in late game eve where they're having fun controlling a large sector of the games player base by maintaining the alliance and coalition. It's not about the core game play of eve online. It's now a sociological game for them. Another challenge for them is figuring out how to control the players that haven't joined them.
---
So when they say pubbie, it's a term used to rally the players that have joined their group. It's like Americans saying "commies" through the Red Scare of the cold war. The word just became a tool in their sandbox game.
---
They ship because they are allowed to. If a blockade will be introduced no one will risk moving out the ore. Biggest buyers for the ore was other nullsec groups and if truly CCP actions leading to creating such cartel ... They will sell it to other null groups
---
So why weren't they selling direct before if it makes more money?
---
&gt; Not really.
---
Yes really. They were abandoned by everyone except INIT and TNT, and discounted as a threat by everyone except TEST. I mean you don't really get to say it was "obvious" when every entity bar those 3 acted as if it wasn't.
---
I doubt this can in any way hurt hisec.   There is plenty of ore in hisec, if hisec needs more than it's getting ore prices go up and hisec miners get happy not sad.
---
It doesn't, but we're OK with that
---
Phrasing

You ever seen Cagali's Butt?

&gt; Is it 'prop to observe that y'all volunteered to bash uncontested structures with Goons

It doesn't take an *awful* lot of imperial orders to induce us to shoot at NCPL. In fact you might recall it was goons that came to join *us* - we'd deployed to Hakonen weeks before.

---
I love how all of /r/eve is so above structure bashing. You might have not nitcet that this is the game now. It's all about structure bashing. Players bash structures, and now NPCs bash structures too.
---
Yeah I thought goons were always about having a laugh and being all trollish, not whatever the imperium is.
---
Pyfa is the "remake"/replacement.
---
Horde seem to be having lots of fun with it
---
What are you doing in the game? Solo PvP? Fleets? PvE?
---
so where is highsec going to get the ores you can only get in nullsec?
---
The FC's hel gets tackled and he asks sabres to help him...? What? I think you've misunderstood something here lol
---
Which ores can you only get in nullsec?
---
&gt;Have you seen a dead structure yet other than ansiblex? No. Dudes freaked out but no one has even seen them come to finish a job yet. You could literally ignore them 99% the time and not have an issue.
---
True, but when are certain services turned off? I am unfamiliar with that particular mechanic but I seem to recall certain services shut off in certain reinforced levels. Does this mean manufacturing jobs are cancelled if armor timer is successfully reinforced? What about science jobs? Markets? Reactions? Reprocessing? Invention? If all of these are untouched even if armor timer is successfully reinforced, then yes one could ignore the drifters. 
---
But then if they reinforce important engineering structures and citadels some humans could show up to put it into armor timer and since drifters did the first bit, you then have only the final timer to defend your structure. Which I'm on the fence about, because on the one hand fewer timers to do if one were to attack an entity and these drifters actually reffed a noticeable amount of structures, but on the other it kinda makes it high risk to put hundreds of billions into a job if suddenly there's one stratop ping between your assets dropping as loot (and 50% of the inputs being destroyed). Since inputs for jobs in progress drop as loot. 
---
The drifter mechanic has some potential. But as is I think I'm leaning towards its a sucky chore.
---
As if he will reveal this information to a bogan FC like yourself. You are not Rastino after all.
---
Leader, not a piece of sand on a beach

Almost all ? Ok, with new moon you can gather some of the mineral from the rare spawn but still..

Wow this is awesome. I didnt know that till now. Thanks! Now the whole thing makes sense.
---
hi friend,
---
just because you breathe and everyone else does, dosent mean its worth going through the effort to edit and upload a video of you breathing
---
Totally. I'm proud of you. We're coming out as gay together. Kirra and I are gay lovers.
---
&lt;3
---
is it tho
---
Its almost as if the game wasnt intended to have whole regions run by one group krabbing 🤔 (NOTE: I used the word intended, not saying they don’t have the right to)
---
Providence stands in solidarity with high security space, and, as such, invite any such none KOS pilots to make use of our industrial facilities in order to remain competitive.
---
&gt; that fucking fortizar in M-O that we missed killing like 5 times.
---
i used that fortizar to asset safety all my (mostly random garbage) shit from the m-o keep so thanks
---
&gt;We were going back this weekend anyway
---
this is the exact point i'm trying to make with my original comment. mittens is trying to go on the record saying the reason you guys are going home is because "oh we have to go deal with the drifters"
---
when that's not the actual reason at all, it's just a convenient excuse
---
Not really upset all that much ( your most likely reading way too much into a comment ). 
---
Honestly, the jump freighter solution would mean a major profit margin ( something I don't expect to pay off as an investment absolutely injecting a toon for jump freighters is a bit of a pain ), mostly because more folks like me will go hey there is good money there.
---
But covert ops hauler and blops has a much lower barrier to entry and really how doesn't have some form of hauler toon in karma at this point ( they have been accepting everyone for years ).
---
Honestly the way you've gone on about it, I for one don't believe for a second you have a char in karma. Lol horde maybe
---
The had a ban on this. Some groups tried to do bulk buys from goons but they were blocked. Now thanks to CCP this have chance of becoming a reality
---
the in-game map is slow, buggy, and difficult to read for any purpose that doesn't require knowing the physical distance between systems in ly. the in-game displayed index is subjective and varies per-client
---
waiting for an esi endpoint for this information to let people like verite and wollari utilize it in their mapping efforts isn't letting perfect be the enemy of good, it's waiting for ccp to stop being the enemy of usability in general
---
I'd be OK with you posting a video about breathing, if you were as good at it as INIT is at structure bashing.
---
I think it's meant to be read as: "FC, there's a hel tackled" not "FC's hel tackled"
---
but what if it was pie? surely that changes things
---
Moons (even in highsec) can provide ABC's, and there's ore sites plus dips into lowsec or wormholes. Null is not the only source for materials, it's just the easiest because of how safe it is (and that is kind of the problem CCP was attempting to address :P).
---
Is there any way to fix this in a short time? Because in Abyss you have only a short time to fix your modules
---
   You have no idea how much ccp fucked the game with rorqual mining ? Typical nullsec miner is making from 500 to 1bil /h mining with the bunch of rorquals. In an developed nullsec area you have few such miners per system. Because many of those miners are old higsec miners ... There is no chance of higsec generating even a fraction of ore it needs atm.
---
Mostly the one needed for t2 production. Both in terms of moon goo and this red stuff you get from mercoxit
---
remember the first sotiyo... punishers everywhere!
---
HE WHO CONTROLS THE SALT CONTROLS THE GOON-IVERSE!
---
more exactly: don't mine if that is all your are doing. As a semi AFK on the second monitor, that can work.
---
that's a lot of salt for a shitpost
---
you're "travelling" not "driving" right?
---
Step 1: call out the Memettanni
---
Step 2: read all the 400 IQ goonswarm fanboys defending him in the comments
---
Step 3: laugh at them solidifying the meme
---
&gt; If it's a sandbox, and players want do to something, and they have will and ability do do so, why shouldn't they don't that.
---
Because i think it's kind of obvious at this point that, if you let that happen, all conflict peters out as megablobs form so people can be as safe as possible, reap all the rewards of null with no risk or danger.
---
Eve players are very good at reverse engineering the game / optimizing the fun out of their gameplay. A nullsec that is entirely blue and without conflict just makes people bored, leading to quitting. It's not "entirely blue" yet but look at how things were 5-7 years ago and consider how things will be if you give it another 3-5 years.
---
&gt;This is   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;r/Eve  
---
&gt; , where "En-Cee Bad," gets you at least 50 fake internet points.
---
Don't think that nullsec is the absolute endgame.
---
don't forget his multi-philippine peso media empire
---
he's too busy dying to adapt i guess
---
&gt;Phrasing
---
What's wrong with the phrasing?
---
the highsec moons can provide them but in the same quantities as nullsec, and that assuming the nullsec market players don't just buy it as it hits the market in jita.
---
I honestly don't know if any have ever happened. There's burn jita, but mainly that's just an odd event where goons group up to shoot things that can't move and can't shoot back, pausing most material-heavy industry queuing for a few days before things pick back up like nothing ever happened. Aside from goon ego's due to big green on their killboard, that is. :P

it's like when people were screeching about all the ratting/mining we weren't doing while burning the north.

making a bit less profit is fine if it means your opponents are making a lot less profit.

Okay retard

the issue isn't exclusivity, it's quantity.

LMFAO

I'm not into bashing Mittens, I really think he is kool dude, but shitty in-game Villain - but this kind of histerial irrational response to this Drifter semi-invasion.
---
OMFG
---
Its just Mittens ranting. Chill.
---
I love how all the goons are going “RRRREEEEEEEEEEE MITTANNI RRRREEEEEEEEE GOONSWARM REEEEEEEEEE”
---
underrated comment
---
I mean maybe I do maybe I don't for the above story it really doesn't matter. 
---
Because really all that matters in terms of economics if there are enough people within groups blue to GSF or whatever export partners, they pick that choice there own personal profit motive over group loyalty given this is like the 3rd or 4th GSF has come out that they where doing this my money is on yeah there absolutely enough profit driven folks within null sec willing to break the boycott.
---
This is the only reasonable comment defending the Memettanni
---
I think it is written in some form of English
---
The goon savior complex is probably one of the funniest takes I've seen r/eve, thanks for the laugh
---
This victim complex of mittens is pretty huge.
---
The simple fact you think we have export partners tells me your not in karma nice plan but no. Have fun in lowsec pubbie
---
  I just listen the linked recording ... And if goons test , frt , ph and darkness is talking on a same chanell about what is happening and halting all wars then bad things are happening. It is not about Mittens ranting but about none of those other leaders denying those talks you should be worrying about.
---
Lol it’s this little thing called ESI all the null blocks except Horde have it.  It’s great for tracking member assets.
---
Log in both accounts and trade it between characters.
---
You will probably have to open a ticket. I doubt anyone here can help you. 
---

---
Making it a bit annoying or expensive to hold a million structures is a good thing
---
Yeah, you can contract it to yourself from account you created through steam. I believe you just drag it from your plex vault into your hangar while docked.
---
Someone doesn't comprehend the difference between player input data, and ESI endpoints, and whay they are not comparable in any way.
---
You might have missunderstood. we only stop exporting raw materials. That means we will still exporting finished products like modules and such. That whole thing seems to be mainly targeted against highsec producers.
---
&gt;We are deeply concerned about how we're viewed by the greater community, as I'm sure you're aware.

What's really weak is dismissing arguments just because they contain expletives.

if you have two accounts that you can log into, it should be relatively simple to get your chars in the same station and just exchange the plex between the two toons you control. :-)

What do u mean as meat shield for RC? What's RC? Rogue Consortium?
---
honestly, I don't know why eve is even on steam, except for visibility. it seems to cause more confusion than it cures from what I hear. haven't done it myself. is there even an advantage to EVE through steam?
---
Ha ha. It should be TIL lol.
---
Wasn't that mainly pushed by boat?
---
i agree its bad when this happens. but in my opinion its much worse if ccp follows their demands, as then nullsec will fo this s lot more often and abuse their power
---
You mean the "powers" want to unite? Like in ending all wars and getting a proper blue donut going? I'm up for it. Let 0.0 die. It deserves it.
---
&gt;There is no chance of higsec generating even a fraction of ore it needs atm.  
---
I hope youre aware that most of the Ore that goes to high isn't used by high?
---
Putting large roaming groups of strong NPCs that cheat the fuck out of combat mechanics in an area specifically designed for PLAYERS to duke it out between themselves is retarded.
---
Having said NPCs spawn at random, therefore potentially fucking people over at random is retarded.
---
Having said NPCs not drop anything valuable and not have bounties so that fighting them off feels like a chore is retarded.
---
But of course, /r/eve posters don't play the game so none of this affects them, and their knowledge about game design/empathy(as in: being able to imagine yourself in postition of a player that isn't them, not the feelings kind) is less than zero, so they are happier than pigs in shit about all this.
---
You know you’re not only wrong, but retarded too, right?
---
All citadels should drop loot like they do in wh.
---
Should spice up wars.
---
Rekking Crew, a culmination of groups living in Derelik and Domain lowsec, and hold meme sov in Provi (HTP &amp; TRC), and fuck with Provi.
---
Bots already can tell which rat is which, eg avoiding dreadnoughts, diamond rats, etc
---
&gt;I am unfamiliar with that particular mechanic but I seem to recall certain services shut off in certain reinforced levels
---
All upwell services shut down once the armour timer goes and the structure is down towards hull timer.
---
CCP's actions aren't leading to that - there's nothing about the drifter attacks that have anything to do with high sec or a change in mineral markets. It's just Mittens trying to reinstate OTEC. Or possibly the real blue donut and the start of Serenity 2.0.
---
What we need is for the drifters to actually be a meaningful threat to structures, particularly low power ones, so the alliances with too much money to be worried about the cost of dropping them at least have to think about whether it's worth it in a diferent way.
---
The faction rat spawn notification isn’t player input. That’s all based off damage logs read that’s being parsed and notifying the user to tab over from Netflix and check the site.
---
Don’t try to posterize saying that you use NEAR2 and contribute to intel. Most people sit back in a corner pocket with 1 way in and receivers the intel in the world from someone else, *or dare I say a bot that’s in a pod 1000km off the gate*
---
no u?
---
I mean, I have a full time job these days, it's been a fair while since I've done much of anything in-game.
---
Yeah but those days are kind of over after HTP took the meme sov at kari gate, no ?
---
Log into your account you sent the plex to then send that plex via contract to the character you want to use u can also activate that plex from anywhere just look for it in personal assets once its contracted over and move to plex vault if u just bought game time unfortunately there is no way to transfer that across
---
When it comes to describing mittens i think nobody ever gave a more accurate description than [goonswarms darius johnson](https://youtu.be/NsC4Lx0ibTY?t=45).
---
All of null? I don't think so
---
Link SA account thx
---
I hope that embargo works out as well as the US one
---
Oh noes, people talk to each other.
---
In all seriousness, banding together is still a decision actively made by players. 
---
This entire scenario just reminds me so much at the time when the moon-system switched to active mining: "Omg, the game is dying, how are our 1/2/3 logistic guys going to mine 500 moons with rorquals?" Technically speaking, back then people could have thrown a hissfit as well and be like "yeah, we need to constantly mine/protect and can no longer go to war with each other".
---
And so now the 3 guys they have are doing what they think is best, while growing angry because it is most likely not the perfect way to go forward. In addition they attempt to figure out a solution in their little circle of diplomats and come to the *surprising* (lol!) solution of just bluing everyone.
---
In my eyes, as long as relevant parties are unable to communicate with factual reasoning, it is not worth repeating or even "fearing" the words they shout.
---
&gt;visibility
---
A big deal for visibility, some people want to try a lot of f2p games, get demos, and a  launcher for a lot of other games, build in buddy status and message board and forums.
---
That's why any game is on steam, you install one thing with one account and people trust that, it's also easy, like app store easy, CCP would have to go through a lot to get added to the microsoft Store and apple store, and I don't care for them because they are full of crap.
---
Cmon man lol don't do this
---
no. just one launcher less, if you call that an advantage. maybe, if you're only playing on 1 account anyways and ar a filthy casual alpha-account omega-male human being that uses apple products.
---
If one is alpha, make a private exchange contract to the target toon, as you can't log in at the same time.
---
Dude did you even read the definition of little you linked omg
---
Lol mining permit... Ignore it
---
Learning from CO2 and taking it one step further: /r/Eve/comments/6s96ws/epic_mail_from_co2_logistics_director_no_export/
---
cope
---
Do you know why they call it rage pinging?
---
the problem is, you pretty much need at least 1 structure on each moon for moon mining. 
---
even a small group of players with a handful of systems are going to have a good number of structures. 
---
even then - why should npcs be the solution? just make it worth while to attack low power structures yourself. remove all the timers, and asset safety if your structure goes low power. not like you can't stuff enough fuel in them to keep them high powered for a considerable amount of time.
---
Ouch... that piece of sand had feelings
---
Globby I can tell the exact point I became bitter and it’s when I started agreeing with every post you made. Fuck.

Praxis, takes a bit longer but doesn't hurt if you lose it.

You can get NS ores in HS now from moons.

OPs posting
---
Gee i wonder what null block :thinking:
---
Idiots will continue to catastrophize.
---
Nullsec needs will come even faster if they do what you are proposing.
---
Everything you described there sounds pretty rad until you remember what an insufferable douche le mintani is.
---
Solo praxis. If you want to run 2 chars run 2 separate sites at a time or use other char to watch holes for you.
---
If they want to have those structures, they can defend them.
---
Effectively the same amount of ISK on grid if I'm dual boxing praxis but would have just under 2x the DPS of a single rattle
---
Would love a tengu, sadly I'm close to getting in one but it's certainly something I'm training into
---
lmao
---
Yeah your misusing the word bogan pretty egregiously  here.
---
why not just dualbox rattles instead of praxis and get even more out of it?
---
Nah, you are wrong. This whole thing is not about money, its about ccp being retarded.
---
Dual box rattles? Domis should work too. Personally I'd rather use domis than praxis. Praxis seems cheap but domis insure better. For true advise one would have to know how you're set up with your chars. If you live in a WH and daytrip and so on and so forth.
---
&gt;The goons that I grew up with didn't take themselves this seriously
---
big mood
---
"Tryhard" is the weirdest fuckin' insult.
---
Who said I was against it?
---
Being pretty new to WH and my first solo attempt, having that much on grid is a little worrying but you're right, that would make sense
---
Sure, but not because they were more attractive as an organization to everyone else in the world.
---
Yep. It's one thing to shoot red crosses for money. If you get tired of doing it, you can stop. Drifters have to be shot whether you want it or not.
---

Horde was maybe founded as pets, but it has come a long way, just saying
---
now this is metagaming
---
I could try and come up with some witty one-liner here, but I think tainting your own search history with that thing is probably a good enough self-own that I don't need to do anything. There are limits to cruelty, after all.
---
Yours. You claim that Mittani is someone with whom no one would deign to associate. Yet, we've got the largest organization. My pithy implication here is something along the lines of "man, if y'all can't manage someone more charismatic and morally superior than that, then what the fuck have you been doing?"
---
Just moved into a wormhole. Got 3 Characters. Was originally planning to use a rattle and have my two alts sitting on the statics. Started reading old posts/threads and ended up more lost
---
the chances of you getting killed in c3 sites are extremely small. you dont get scrammed, you can always mjd/warp out. and if you close your holes before you start to rat and watch dscan/new sigs pop up, you should be safe. you most likely would come out isk positive even if you would ignore all of that.
---
It is so much worse outside our walls, though.
---
Thank you all so much! I’ve transferred it via contract!
---
What's the deal with your false equivalence here?
---
if you're new to solo wh stuff, go domi/praxis until you feel save enough for rattles.
---
you know, for somebody who doesn't care how he and his organization are viewed by "the greater community"
---
you sure tryhard post a lot
---
Am Goon. Can Confirm.
---
&gt;Highseccers have these structures and make tons of isk from a few clicks a month
---
You must be really out of touch with reality if this is literally your perception of highsec, as someone in nullsec.
---
Also, holy fuck your attitude is toxic. You're literally discussing it'd be a good thing to break the game and have all of null blue to one another, not a single fight, and go out to blob smaller individuals to no gain to you, just to make them unable to play.
---
been there, done that. big fights in high sec are big cancer, crimewatch slows down the systems to an unbearable level even if you only have 2-300 people in local and even if the node is reinforced
---
you, arguing against it
---
There are a variety of other ideas which people post quite often to improve the structure situation. Moon mining structures shouldn't have weapons or grid control, and low power structures shouldn't be able to use them or have tether. Asset safety should only apply to large structures.
---
But when you have a coalition with such a ridiculous capital umbrella that they can drop it on a cruiser roam, it doesn't matter what the structure grid itself is like, they're still going to be able to drop it on anything and kill content. Until CCP makes changes to make fighting under a hostile umbrella possible, they're going to have to provide the cost and effort penalty for holding lots of structures through NPCs.
---
Eh probably a couple million.
---
You underestimate the autism of TEST. It's the alliance that entosised entire regions during WWB for fun.
---
Yeah it's really stupid, you used to be able to right click, cancel them in the auctions window, but since they binned that it is no longer possible. My trade alt has one of these.
---
Answering the phone every time it rings is simple. Getting 171 automated selling calls per day is annoying.
---
How do I get over losses though?
---
I mean, I'm not "attached" to my ships anymore. Except for my super, almost every ship I undock is "already replaced" because I usually buy 3-5 of the fit at once when I do logistics day.
---
I don't get mad because I lost the ship, I get mad because I didn't win.
---
&gt;Don't focus on your killboard
---
A good bit of advice that I got once was "nobody ever really looks at your killboard stats except for yourself".
---
If it's with their server it wouldnt really help anyway. I didnt do all troubleshooting due to the fact that I supported a ticket and these things can randomly happen based on their server
---
holy shit so much salt 
---
who hurt you?
---
Quote: "A player organization that, by any right, has essentially no excuse or place to complain about circumstance,"
---
And I'll stop right there.  Regardless of your opinion of the Mittani, me, or the Goons I will address one thing here.
---
I and my ilk will not accept gate keeping from anyone, not even you.
---
Like you we play this game.  Like you we make either payments, plex, or both each month for all of our accounts/characters.
---
This makes us customers, and when the people who we pay make mistakes we have every right to call them on it.  As do you and everyone else.  
---
Frankly, this drifter thing is both interesting and flawed.  It is neither fish nor fowl.  It will not effectively shake the snow globe that is eve.  It won't fix anything.  It actively is impacting everyone who lives in 0.0 and their ability to play however they like.  It has screwed with two active wars that I am aware of.  And it has done so in a half ass way.  If it is to be a full on drifter apocalypse, then do so.  But all this does is stop people from playing in the sand box through all of 0.0, all while avoiding story, lore, or depth.  For nothing.
---
As for high sec, meh, violence comes to us all.  Even for those who cower behind 1.0 space.  Ships are just another form of ammo.  This is a PVP game after all, specifically a non consensual PVP game.  Its nearly been 4 hrs since I've been podded.  I miss it already.
---
Come out and play.
---
did this bug also cause you to forget how to use punctuation?
---
It usually happens. Anaking was draged to the dark side for example. The republic became the empire. Etc.
---
im sure, everyone not in goons will be mad when mineralprices go up, their space gets more ''valuable'' and mining gets more lucrative!
---
every time ive had all modules was because:
---
1: my ship was destroyed but im in 10% tidi so my client has not caught up with the game
---
2: i logged off in space and when i logged back in my account was downgraded to alpha. 
---
what ever happened, i am inclined to believe the issue is your fault. you communication skills are indicative of your intelligence.
---
Boom
---
Go in a citadel, not a station, and deliver items/plex to your account. It's free and instant.
---
Contract will cost you 10k
---
can't mine moon goo if your refinery got asploded
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If you lock yourself in, you dont need to watch holes.
---
plex was split to 1:500 and 500 plex buys you a month of game time. 500 plex costs about 2.1b
---
Accept that loss is a natural part of life/EVE and learn to not get mad when you lose.
---
I've read the entire post and still got no clue what exactly is happening. Can someone help the little dumdum
---
My intelligence is fine. I'm still omega my ship wasn't destroyed  so I am highly doubting this is my fault
---
You don't need to watch holes, that's a waste of character slots.
---
Lock yourself in by rolling all your connections, to include the static. Dont scan or warp to the new static, it wont spawn on the other side.
---
Keep your signature window open, when a new one spawns MJD off and roll em, and continue krabbing.
---
Why are nullsec plebs so offended by even the slightest of nerfs to their playstyle?
---
visit... hbubice?
---
Dude, you guys were already pulling stuff back before Eve North began. 2 goons told me last weekend at Eve North that once SH1 dropped, it was full on exit. They had to do some move ops before Eve North as there wouldn't be much time after the weekend to move stuff back. 
---
So one of two things are happening here..
---
One, if you were going back to deal with the Drifters, somebody in goons was tipped off it was happening the week before that they needed to be home to defend once SH1 dropped.
---
Or two, if Goons weren't tipped off, Mittens is lying through his teeth to claim that the Drifter mechanic is the reason for the pullback, as 5 days before drifters showed up, some Goons were already headed home.
---
hi what ore do I mine to build [badger]
---
&gt; Umm, any non-organic decision-making process is generally considered AI.
---
That would make every program that doesn't just copy an input stream to an output stream an AI. Considering a program an AI requires at least for the program to learn from input it received earlier.
---
Many thanks for the info. Will definitely keep this in mind 👍
---
If you do decide to mine, do it in a group, take some risks.
---
Nah lol, I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than sitting in space shooting a bunch of structures while eagerly waiting to get super blobbed.
---
I'd be straight up not having a good time. 
---
Goons always spewing bullshit about utilizing all the game's mechanics to their fullest potential, and quite frankly, if someone else is going to poke your structures, that's me doing the same.
---
Classic. Bravo good Sir.
---
Roflmao, you do realize the notion of export partners comes from the plan mittens presented right?
---
While he doesn't directly call them that he included the notion of well making bulk trade agreements between them and other null blocs these people would very much become export partners aka a secondary weak link in the monopoly.
---
I think CCP is trying to find a solution and prevent turning EVE in to Farmville Online or Serenity, a direction we are steadily marching forward. Good mechanic or Bad mechanics, at least they are trying.
---
Rising fuel costs might hit smaller entities disproportionally hard, as they don't have time to grind for the fuel cost of something where they just want to dock and stage out of.
---
I think damage caps were put in place for exactly this reason in order to prevent much bigger alliance from just steamrolling smaller trying to be independent groups ( I don't say it worked perfectly ), and to some extend they did achieve something...as you pointed out you didn't enjoy grinding thru all those structures. Short reinforce timer on structures or nerfing the guns on citadels will make them even harder to defend by the owners.  
---
Back in the POS days, death-stars were a thing you would not just randomly mess around and gave SOME fighting chance for smaller entities ( not against the current super blob ). I was part of such a small group that had to defend against IT alliance, when they invaded our region.  
---
IMO there just need to be some way to balance this whole thing, and this is what CCP is trying to do.
---
Oh so the guy who tried to get a kid to kill himself is still a toxic piece of shit? Man I never saw that coming.
---
*Boom*.   
---
-Man I just got that ship.    
---
-And I just got that ammo, you don't hear me complaining...
---
idk why people think globby has any shred of credibility after his  whole "girlfriend deleted my reddit account" meltdown
---
- burner missions
---
if you see a different job offered...check it out on eve university etc...i saw the reward...took my starter gila and had my first big loss
---
- exploration
---
check sites with a quick search....lost my astero with loot in my first ghost site
---
- dont get attached to ships and try to move them with you every time
---
- buy gametime...you can try to plex but will probably burn you out and you dont have to login everyday for skills or the insane level of grind in this game
---
- dont stay to long in highsec. get in lowsec/nullsec/wormhole and search for a small/medium sized corp/alliance
---
you could also join a bigger alliance and get newbro experience and then join someone else
---
had the experience that smaller alliances are not always the best newbro experience
---
- get into a community
---
- salt is the currency in the game...dont give others what they search for...if you lose something etc just go on
---
- dont undock in something you cant afford to lose
---
- dont try to fit a ship and downgrade stuff because you dont have the skills...
---
- forget the autopilot...just dont use it
---
It sounds a bit like a C2 with a C3 static.
---
Btw if you roll a static and dont warp to it after it respawns it wont spawn on the other side. Google a bit for the exact mechanics. This means you dont need to put alts on them if you're in your home WH and they are rolled. its actually a bad idea.
---
For what to use its probably a bit of taste. Rattle should be best for a solo or dual box C3. If one character can already fly a rattle I'd use that and get some experience. Then you can move on to other set ups. When moving on rather consider how to move up to higher class WHs than to get THE optimal setup for a C3.
---
&gt;hisec needs more than it's getting ore prices go up and hisec miners get happy not sad.
---
And what are they going to build with that price-inflated ore?  The point is that we'll still be exporting end products with our cheaper ore.  If your ore price went up, but you can't profit on any of the end products, that ore is worthless.
---
That's an interesting conspiracy theory, as is Mittens' theory that CCP put the new Drifter code into the game to distract from their skill point sale debacle. 
---
I believe that it's certainly true that the Goon attack had run out of steam due to the North blue balling their caps and the boring structure bashes diminishing line member enthusiasm.
---
"Tryhard" is such a weird fuckin' insult. It's so weird I posted this twice.
---
Tyrannos is silver hand of Bob
---
Fly tech 1 cruisers and frigates.  Before you fly a t2 hull or t3 fly a tech 1 ship that is like the t2/t3 hull you like.
---
Now die in that t1 ship like 10-20 times.  Each time you die ask:
---
1. Was there something I forgot to do? (Left hardeners off, drones in, did not kill tackle, etc.
---
2. Did the enemy do something wrong I could exploit?
---
3. How could this fight be won in my t1 hull?
---
Never fall into the mindset of:  "I cannot win a fight because their ship is better."  Guess what, someone's ship is always better, that does not mean you cannot kill them.
---
THEN you may be ready for t2/t3 and you will be better with it.
---
Nah. I was merely pointing out something you and yours might have missed. Shit, we'd love more granular map info available via API. It'd let us track all sorts of good shit for macroeconomic purposes.
---
What's a cheetodemon?
---
I'm apparently also underestimating their ability to tell the difference between a one-time task and a task that can never actually be completed because the video game keeps spawning more work to be done.
---
Yeah, Maded, don't feed that troll. SF is fun and you're doing a great job.

Screw the naysayers.

Goons try to "embargo" highsec from null materials, forgetting most of the people will not give a fuck and still export to high because its good isk.
---
And even if somehow all guys blue to goons stopped exports, there is a fuckton of other guys mining.

The point of the praxis is that its cheap, you replace it quickly if it dies ratting in dangerous holes. If you are going to do that you might as well use a blingy rattle because the risk to you is basically nothing.

Re-assign your module keybinds off of the F keys to something easier to press.
---
You have more people in command than in this fleet. Maybe time for command to fight?
---
It must be an awful existence to constantly be screening what you read for invisible narratives, afraid that it'll infect your brain and irrecoverably transform you. I'd recommend relaxing. Failing that, turn off your monitor and take a walk for a bit until the paranoia abates.

No, worst that comes from the server is lag/desync, and disconnects, you got something weird and don't want to troubleshoot, good luck.

Assuming null sec is 100% cut off, then sure. One thing that undermines (pun intended) a shaky conglomerate of risk averse players is massive margins to be made by disobeying the orders from up-top.

Holy fuck.

For sure, this requires some minimum amount of widespread buyin that may or may not work out.  It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.  Point is just that it's not so simple as "plenty of minerals in HS, bing bong this won't hurt HS".

I've ratted in C4, 5 and 6 before but it was in a group with more experienced members and we used tinker nestors. First time going solo, still a lot I need to learn. So rolling and not warping to the new sigs doesn't open the connection, that's interesting. Don't suppose you have a rattle fit I could look at? Found a few older posts, fit's look OK but I'm not sure if they are up to par
---
For the record, were NBSI....
---
Here is the thing.
---
Drifters numbers and strengh rise.
---
All nullbloc join to fight them.
---
The war is going bad, drifters don't stop coming. Players gets weaker and weaker. It becomes a fight for survival.
---
Jove Gates go online. Drifters starts yo overrun everything. Players runs to regroup on Jove Space.
---
A Lot of people start to quit Eve. It's roled played as part of the drifters genocide on capsulers.
---
Explores guys found a strange massive gate. Offline. Can be fitted.
---
Explorer found data sites with BP of jovian modules.
---
Last industrals rush research and build that, as they rest contain drifters as they can.
---
Massive gate is fitted and fueled. It goes online.
---
Every remaining players. Make huge fleet of freighters and combate ships, and take the gate.
---
Client closes, rederict you to an URL.
---
"Congrats. Here is the download link for EvE online 2"
---
Players start new game, coming from the gate to the new universe.
---
One for every whine per day.
---
You make it sound as if its hard to lock yourself in.
---
Auto correct of non dictionary words is mainly based on frequency... So... You know...
---
Would be funny if ccp would do it. "My god shut up" \*spawns thounds of drifters\*
---
Yeah definitely. Though I find it a bit strange that Mittens is doing exactly what CCP wants.
---
1) CCP does a shake-up
---
2) Mittani gets angry and makes a revenge no-fun policy. 
---
3) If Mittani’s plan works as intended, blues inevitably disobey.
---
4) The very reasonable Mittens does a knee-jerk war dec on people that obey
---
5) Civil war looks likely
---
6) Content finally created, things happening 
---
7) CCP *taps forehead*
---
all except Loki were nerfed into the ground while keeping the skill loss.
---
You can still have a 1k DPS ham Tengu, but a C3 Praxis does it for a quater of the price with better application.
---
Upvoted for pure entertainment value.
---
You can let the spod fields go fallow and nothing bad happens. I'd recommend not trying to find some pithy comparison here; you're really bad at it.
---
The last time I checked we were burning their space. And it seemed they had some trouble adapting.
---
"Knock Knock"
---
"Whos there?"  
---
"Apollo Tyranos"
---
"Fuck"
---
All hail  [Tyrannos Strategos](https://zkillboard.com/character/3019583/)  H**ere not to ruin the game, but here to ruin** *Goonswarm* game!
---
I wouldn't lock myself out of my home just to rat in safety so.
---
no problem. 👍👍
---
You arent trying to lock yourself out of your home, youre trying to lock yourself in your bearhole...............
---
I do not know every single person reading Reddit so tough to say
---
You probably forgot that even gotg and oh are on our side this time and will stop export ore and other stuff? :)
---
I think there is still plenty of them left
---
Get out there and just lose ships tbh. What a lot of people do is buy quite a few of a ship, and like keep a spreadsheet or a notepad and  evaluate how you lost that ship and what could be improved. Did you bite off more than you could chew? Didn't have the right ammo loaded for the engagement? Needed to work on your range control? Etc.
---
Of course, and this is what we want now
---
inb4 Post?
---
'A bit annoying' I agree, that is what is currently available via mechanics. 'Dumbfuckingly boring annoying' is not a good thing.
---
Put the PLEX into a shuttle, pick a random moon and warp to at at range. Now eject and log off. Log in your other account and warp to the moon where you're shuttle of PLEX should be safely floating in space... 
---
&gt; most of the people will not give a fuck and still export to high because its good isk
---
What part of this did you not understand?
---
Of course, because everyone will suck mittens cock, because he demands it.
---
You for real?
---
While making a quick deal to work with another fleet is fine, your group is literally working with an Alliance and don't attack their fleets at all.
---
This goes directly against what NPSI is.  NPSI is a fleet that forms up and goes out to wreak havoc on an area.  It is not a group that should be trying to cause timers.  It is not a group that should be attempting to entosis.  It is not a group that is working with an Alliance to attempt to evict people.
---
Not.
---
Purple.
---
Shoot.
---
It.
---
&gt;Tbh If you deploy to.the other side of the universe were you so arrogant anyway not to think anyone might invade you? The drifters could have been any alliance really. 
---
Do you ever read the things you post. Go over this again and think about it for 1 minute by the clock. Then you might see what's wrong with it.
---
Why dont you STFU for once init boy
---
And that is the core issue with upwell cancer. Not enough incentive.
---
Do not listen to this subreddit. Game is fun, go play it.
---
I'm not sure the majority of goons are actually customers tbh.
---
I think most of them buy Plex from mass ratting. This is not the same as "supporting" eve online. Yes someone buys that Plex. But skyrocketing Plex prices would indicate far more people buying then selling.
---
that's what i was thinking. the goons from 2008 are now TEST, and BoB is Goonswarm.
---
what times to be alive....are u calling content this?fuck this game dude
---
We will see :) you know that only a few people do all the export stuff right? :)
---
Oï !
---
For now, I’d say don’t invest billions in BPOs right now. You can technically do it alone, by either harvesting the minerals yourself (you’d need a strong mining fleet, best supported by a Rorqual), or buying them off the market, although you’d need good researched blueprint copies to not waste too much in minerals.
---
Concerning the mistakes, I can’t say anything on that, sorry :/
---
&gt;EvE is a sandbox for us all.
---
this is literally why the goons can do whatever the hell they want in game
---
Underrated comment.
---
Well.. it’s more like.. ccp, low und high sec thinks fuck null we don’t need you.. now we will see if they really don’t need us :)
---
Says the goon.
---
Basically you want more risks ? Wormhole space is for you my friend, and content won’t wait for you (or your approval) to come. I’d say with all your alts, T3C is a good thing for ops, mining/industrial for money making and carrier for home defense.
---
Imagine all null sec regions disappear together with all players who inhabit them - is this what you want ? You think this will be good for EVE to make it survive as a whole?
---
I don't care at this point. 0.0 content is utter shit. Wormholes will survive without 0.0 until eve closes. I don't give a fuck past that.
---
The Mittani is a retard, completely out of touch with the game, and so are you.
---
So why would people be crying on reddit ? Which they aren't they just find the excuse retarded
---
and why does H-Sec care what Null does or doesn't do?
---
I wish I could upvote this twice
---
Will they though?
---
&gt;and the boring structure bashes diminishing line member enthusiasm.
---
It was more that almost the high value structures were dead
---
This is NEVER happening, don't even bother asking for it, the Drifter AI was never designed for that type of activity, they just siege a set of systems over a period of a day or so reinforcing everything in sight and then choose another random set of systems. There is no magical list that they follow, no magical list of citadels that they already reinforced, they are just brainless NPCs following simple, yet advanced compared to normal NPCs set of commands.
---
&gt;Also, holy fuck your attitude is toxic. You're literally discussing it'd be a good thing to break the game and have all of null blue to one another, not a single fight, and go out to blob smaller individuals to no gain to you, just to make them unable to play.
---
This is a lot like how people talk about 0.0 all the time
---
Lol, you are funny.
---
lol
---
I'm not at home so no access to pyfa. The fit that I've seen used is full passive regen. You can drop a mobile depot to switch between more regen or more dps in the lows depending on the wave. So open up pyfa and play around yourself what gives you the best results. For the missiles some seem to go for rapids some for cruise. I'd say just make your own experiences. Imho a good bit of the fun in eve is to figure things out. (Don't understand me wrong asking questions is also important.) Do you know the excel sheet with the WH site stats? Have a look at that so you know what you have to tank. With some proper experience you can then optimize your stuff a bit.
---
Rattle
---
I don't think so.
---
WH space subs are not enough to maintain eve servers. Tbh now nullsec have the most subs in game
---
Don't care. Let Eve die then.
---
Do we know if they’re following up on timers yet? Or is CCP just making content for others to take advantage of?
---
Got a fit? I’ve been messing with one I’m pretty happy with, but not had a chance to try it yet.
---
Hey, you're not supposed to like my posts! They're high effort and of the lowest quality shit!
---
Well for me they have a valid point. You join nullsec group to shoot others. If some new pve me mechanic forces you to do pve instead of pvp then you have right to be mad
---
Wow, you just really suck don't you.
---
at least someone with common sense left here, everyone else is too busy riding CCPs marketing dick...
---
Is why I approve )
---
imagine being such an inept mongoloid that you still get caught super ratting while aligned out. Like jesus christ renters do it easily without an umbrella, youre worse than renters
---
I have a rather pointless aesthetics problem with one of my ships and I wanted to know if there was a fix for it. Most MMO’s and other multiplayer games have some kind of “fashion” subreddit. Does eve have one?
---
Hellraiser is an awesome movie, what's wrong with you?
---
 poor **Mittens** overwhelming resources.  Can't compete with unlimited resources :(
---
Hey at least i am not part of a group stating they are 1337 pvpeers .... and then run/hide or not login as someone came to burn my home.        
---
Imagine how trully shitty those players are....
---
No one needs Goons. Everyone of you could dissappear tomorrow and the game would go on just fine
---
Yep pretty much xD
---
But we all know that would never happens :)
---
What? All goons do is talk about how good they have become and how much more "elite" they are than ncpl. 
---
Also i'm not in the group you think i am.
---
One of EVE's oldest bugs, this goes back at least a decade (holy shit I've been around too long).
---
Hope the fact that that guy deleted his account/post means I saved at least one soul from playing this god forsaken game...
---
Nope. Thos will just lead to big groups owning structures.  But yes citadels as whole were a mistake
---
As entertaining as these posts are, it's probably time to wake up to the reality that this is part of Mittani's showmanship.
---
Lets look at the facts.
---
It's accepted by everyone, Goon leadership included, that the team of FCs who were prosecuting the structure demolition in Tribute were burnt out. This is before they even started on Vale (which on last estimate had 150+ renter structures remaining, as well as a few strategic ones for Panfam, and all but 1 constellation with ihubs still intact).
---
1 week prior to the Drifter event formally commencing, Goon forward staging fortizars across Tribute, Vale and Venal began to be unanchored. These forward staging forts are important because they were the structures Goons would put their supercapital fleet on, and from which they would forward bridge their bash fleets.
---
4 days prior to the Drifter event commencing, Goon FC coordinators began to preach about the 'final push' in pings, and literally pinged a 3 day countdown to their memberbase (i.e. "3 days to go!"). Coincidentally this countdown ended on the day that the Drifter event commenced - no comments on that.
---
1-2 days after the Drifter event began, all Goon Forts had been removed from Trib/Vale/Venal. Considering unanchoring takes a minimum of 7 days (unless you extend the timer) it's evident that the removal process began before the event ever kicked off.
---
The reality is the event is a convenient cover for Goons to call an end to their campaign. While how far Goons would push in a structure/sov battle is largely dictated only by their own appetite for it, it's unclear why Mittani feels the need to lie to his own memberbase about it; just tell them the sov war sucks ass dude but it had to be done to teach your decrepit enemies a lesson, why lie about it?
---
Ultimately while at the commencement of this war Mittani indicated there would be no 'narrative' driven for this war (see his war commencement fireside chat) it's clear this strategy didn't hold true through to the end and he felt the need to revert to his old staple of feeding shit to his people to try and mosey the effort along.
---
I think Mittani's behavior is more easily explained using the factual deductions above rather than just calling him a sperging retard (though some may find that latter option fun), but the details are all there for anyone that wants to verify them.
---
TL;DR: Goon mantra is "We are not here to ruin the game, we are here to ruin your game, while also pretending we aren't ruining our own game."
---
Asset safety kinda kills the will for pvp. Goons fleets can be in only so many places at the same time. Multi pronged assault on structures for the loot, is a thing. As long as you organise enough people
---
The mittani tears = best tears
---
Ps!
---
I still cant understand why so many people follow a guy that its not even active in campaigns he created. He got two undefended Keepstar killmails up north and now his crying about drifters. 
---
But who knows maybe he will blue the drifters as well to keep his gameplay just as he like it:)
---
You know what. You changed my mind.
---
While we are at it, we need an ESI endpoint for all wormhole spawns and entrances and exits. Because if those filthy wormholers can use Pathfinder and Siggy, everyone else needs to be able to have that info without people having to be in space to acquire it. (/s)
---
You are one dumb motherfucker.
---
i mean their FPS has been coming out SOON for years now lol
---
Unironically comparing this to T20 and greed is good
---
I downloaded pyfa after my first reply, been playing around with my a passive rattle fit. I can't for the life of me find out where it tells me how much I can tank and yeah I use Rykki's WH spreadsheet, that thing is incredibly helpful!
---
Don't be an idiot. Imperium builders buy ore from miners at 85% Jita. That means current exporters thrived on the 15%.
---
Even if Delve cuts off its mineral and moon exports, the likelihood of others all doing the same in a concentrated capacity is incredibly unlikely unless you start shooting your own jumpfreighters jumping out of nullsec.
---
Further, as the price of minerals rises in highsec, it will motivate more and more people to breach the embargo for their own gains. OTEC only worked because all supply was in the hands of a few, concerted entities working together. There are too many open sources of moon and ore for this to be a viable blockade.
---
We specifically didn’t do that because it wouldn’t be a fun fight. 
---
With Caps it’d be over quickly.
---
With Subcaps, we’d have fun fights.
---
I prefer content over supercap blobbing.
---
Well we have enough isk to buy it for 100% we already plan to do that so nobody have to export it and we can build stuff with all that ore :)
---
You must have bought something from CCP on the account used to register the application.
---
It's part of the validation to use SSO in an application.
---
It's not an "in your face" request, but it is a requirement.
---
Anyhow*, retard.
---
If it's courier, just fail it.
---
Those few JFs must be really fucking moving on crack to sustain logistics for 20k+ people.
---
your reward for shooting Drifters is, you get to keep your sov.
---
its fascinating how only goons so far spoke about "oh but the smol groups" while not a single small groups has complained about it, quite the contrary. Really gets the noggin joggin
---
Free titans and supers?  Did I miss a memo about this?
---
Cool, then we will have other entities sending stuff to high.
---
I run 3 ishtars. Average 5-7min per site.
---
If you don't care then unsub, leave this reddit and go play other games, and leave us alone so we can play as we like.
---
Now who is taking things too seriously?
---
CCP - "Everything is proceeding to our design".
---
Thats fine, but all that does is guarantee that ore prices will rise. Which means your industrialists will be paying more and more for the ore they are stockpiling, and others will continue to profit.
---
If the endgoal is to stockpile until a time the prices are 'juicy' in highsec so you then liquidate those reserves, that can work, but that's the kind of effort orchestrated by the few, not by a general embargo.
---
Am I just bad because I can never tell if these posts are pro or anti Goons?
---
Is this the famous "salt" I keep reading about?
---
Or else you'll do what exactly?
---
Quality shitpost.
---
Used to be a goon a 2 or 3 years ago, I said "fuck mittens" in local and I think I heard audible gasps.
---
400 IQ
---
It's a completely different thing lol
---
&gt;We have dedicated groups for this
---
Yea so why dont the goons just make the krabs take care of the NPCs?
---
What ? Goons always say how shit they are and make fun of everyone who claims to be 'elite'.
---
Been a while since they were like that mate
---
No? They don't attack sov structures at all.
---
Apparently not as much as everyone else!
---
&gt;now we will see if they really don’t need us
---
Yea because people totally dont yoink delve caps to sell to friends or others for a profit.
---
So power the structures?
---
In a C2 or C3? Whatever floats your boat i guess.
---
"gasp"
---
A Hel (carrier, expensive ship) was tackled (held in place) and the fleet commander (fc) in charge called in all of his pilots to stop whatever they were doing and get into ships to kill the carrier.
---
Apparently the carrier managed to get away (break tackle) and warp away. The fleet commander apologized to all of his pilots that they wouldn't get to kill the carrier. Apparently the Hel flew straight into a trap (bubble) and got stuck.
---
The fleet commander was informed of the bubble and called all the pilots back and told them to hop into their ships that the hunt was back on.
---
There are a lot of nuances missing from this explanation but it should get you the gist of it.
---
It's tier 3 irony, they are both
---
I just think its funny to watch the hivemind here twist itself in impotent rage at those damn casuals who mined the elite peeveepeers to death.
---
psh, the ore you mine is free!
---
B e a r h o l e
---
Not krabbing a static
---
So everything on the market starts selling for more isk? That will combat inflation not sure how this is bad. I would love for things to be in higher demand
---
This is very much making fun of goons.
---
Just mittens, this is just more sockpuppeting
---
Strategic ratting fleets~
---
I bet this will all be good for the economy. Less product means better demand you may even be able to make things in eve for a profit.
---
You sound extremely butthurt, crying you don't care but still posting here. Just giving you some options you can consider to help you.
---
Poe’s Law
---
Woah, there are children present!
---
As another guy said, it's only hull timer. So easy solution is do the exact same as everyone does in pvp. You ignore the shield timer. Then have a gunner ready to go on armor, maybe a haw dread as well to help kill them fast, but not necessary. 
---
Or..... you can burn out all the gunners in the alliance running to every single system of more than 100 notifications and turtle up waging war on highsec
---
Wow, a psychologist. No, thanks. I'm good.
---
Fire's fun, get in
---
Show me at least one post here from a goon to claim goons are elite. 
---
On comms they always say how shit they are.
---
You sound misinformed.
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Pyfa#Fitting](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Pyfa#Fitting)
---
On the right hand side under recharge rates the passive shield regen rate is the bottomleft number 76.2 HP/s. You want to maximize that number in EHP/s for a flat damage profile (dont worry thats the default profile). For that fit shield purger rigs (T2 costs but should be worth it) put shield extenders in the mids and regen mods into your lows (start with 3 and 3 DDAs). Also put passive resist mods into the mids. Start with the EM, thenthermal and so on. Consider to use some ded resist mods. You got to play around with the cost/performance tradeoff here.
---
In general you would need some experienced wormholer to help you out a bit and explain such thinhs to you. Conisder to enter eve university with an alt (they now allow that). Application will take a few days. Then apply for a mentor and tick that you're interested in WH both PvP and PvE. If things haven't changed drastically they should have some alumni mentors who live in WH space.
---
Updoots deployed
---
/&gt;fuxking reddit, cant even greentext properly
---
You sound retarded
---
Maybe you should stop sucking Mittanis dick
---
Hey, I never said this was a quality shitpost.
---
It's only an insult if part of your posting strategy is "I don't even care lol"
---
And then everyone in the room stood up and applauded
---
Lol, no cheese on the hislots. Crap fit
---
Quality reply
---
I think this was in 1DQ1 at the time, so I don't think it was a coincidence that I ended up leaving Goons shortly after.
---
Truth hurts doesn't it
---
Translation:  I can't point to a post to support my argument, so I'll just go ad hominem instead.
---
Typical pubbie post.
---
I don't even play eve anymore, nor was I a goon when I did, but Goons kinda do get to complain..
---
From what I've read they have 5x more systems under attack in their region than any other regions (delve has 20, others have 3/4).
---
That seems like CCP intentionally targeting an alliance which is like the exact opposite of a sandbox.
---
It is neither truth nor it hurts. Sorry to make you disappointed.
---
Lmao another salty goon
---
Your tears fuel me
---
&gt;been there, done that. big fights in high sec are big cancer
---
Can confirm. A campaign of hi-sec structure bashing rates 11/9 possible nopes from me.
---
no  thats retarded
---
how about add in actual pvp content???
---
i mean you're more stupid than the drifter mechanics
---
\&gt;Decide to show off to our ~valued allies~ TEST and beat up the decaying corpse of PL/NC
---
Does this mean TEST is Stacy of EVE?
---
what meltdown lmao
---
Thanks for proving my point.   You're a pal.   ;-)
---
Every official communication and every randos post from goons is about how something hurt them so they are entitled to "insert something"
---
Shit I would think that anybody with a working intellect would quickly spot this bullshit trick
---
But the real disgrace is that this bunch of absolute gullibles has become the biggest player group in Eve
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave ?
---
6k citadel's for a shitload of players
---
Looking forward to the day we reset your sorry ass
---
"long winded pseudo-intelligent douchebag" - too funny..
---
possibly the biggest thing in between mittani and a concerted push into high sec is the fact that we just had a high sec war and everybody's fcs already know how aids it is to bash structures there
---
Would hiring mechanical turks to do that on alpha accounts be RMT?
---
Wow is that the infamous stupid retort that 12 years say? I know you lack intelligence but this is even beneath you
---
There has been loads of "burn HS" and they camped ice miners, done ganks, all sorts but it is just yet another one at this point.
---
I still cant understand why so many people follow a guy that its not even active in campaigns he created. He got two undefended Keepstar killmails up north and now his crying about drifters.
---
Mad cuz bad.
---
Was he a good enough leader to put a stop to it?
---
because there's no loot to krab off of.
---
Little check list for you
---
Bring your titans
---
Bring your bots
---
Be sure to move all your shit
---
Congrats, you have me shivering in fear. I’ll remind you next week how empty a threat this was.
---
Dead bees that are still swarming like zombies is more mentally visual and specific to CFC.
---
Controversial and brave are probably the same thing
---
And probably because I was a couple drink in and figured "ah what the hell, I'll say it"
---
until we start burning the means of production
---
but not drifter atm.
---
hehe, you forget where moongoo comes from
---
Lol you guys can’t figure out oh to log in to kill some npcs how you going to burn anything
---
uh, have you seen delve mineral prices? it's like 50% jita usually
---
It really doesn't matter if we archieve blue donut by war or by diplomatic efforts
---
the idea is to have agreements with the big blocs to embargo. your moongoo is not produced in sufficient quantities elsewhere
---
Until they nerf the citadel you sit in to admire your Zen garden or the ship you used to rake it, as a result.
---
You have no idea how hard it is to move my titans and supers
---
*cries in isk*
---
Not at all worried to be honest. I want to be to ya know make things more exciting.
---
There is something you may not have thought about though.
---
Did you know mittens makes a living being a EvE online personality?
---
Is it in his best interest to try to bite the hands that feed him? 
---
If the answer is yes it is. Then I'm ok with him looking for a career change.
---
I have won a contract for a Buzzard on a decommissioned station and it can't be removed. Bug report got me a message that they can't do anything about it... After that I kind of just learned to ignore it
---
lol, moron, we already figured that out. the citadel gunners deal with it, it's just stupid shit, done by ccp to cover up SP sales.
---
... and why we are laughing at them for their little tantrum.
---
I mean we just finished burning 3 regions.. Not sure how you do that without being logged in?
---
Shitpost is shit.
---
&gt; be me, omw to Delve for some sweet VNI km's
---
&gt; cut through hisec, systems part of triglavian invasion 
---
&gt; Can't cloak my 1.5b 6 second align loki due to wrecks 
---
&gt; instamelted by NPC gatecamp
---
hisec is not "the hand that feeds him", and really, ccp is only indirectly
---
I know the imperium is famous for its spin. I have to be honest with you though. 
---
&gt;done by ccp to cover up SP sales.
---
Is the dumbest narrative I have ever heard. Ever.
---
What do you mean by the 'POS Dogma'? Unless I'm missing an obscure joke here...
---
It’s hard to be a small angry man. I wish you the best
---
Still going to be called out on it and laughed at, when you throw sand at other kids because you don't like the toy trucks the adults added to the sandbox.
---
Goons redeployed due to NPCs. If that's not being on the backfoot, get me a primer on your fantasy world.
---
It is if "high sec" is actually paying real money to play eve.
---
There is r/eveporn for cool screenshots, but there’s no fashion because it’s all spaceships
---
Yup, if the players can't do it then CCP needs to break the mega-coalitions.
---
If it’s a C3-HS then the HS is a pain in the dick to roll...
---
Unfortunately your only recourse is a new skin (which is just a paint job that doesn't change the model), or a different ship. There's not that many fashion choices in the game, which is honestly fine since it looks beautiful and you spend most of your time zoomed way out anyway.
---
I guess we can think of Drifters as the dark ochre of ratting.
---
There will come a weekend that this doesn't fall on the Saturdays I work, I know it lol.
---
&gt;spectre announces anti provi sov campaign
---
&gt;spectre comes through provi with a big harbi fleet in the middle of one of our sov timers
---
&gt;spectre claims they werent there for sov timer
---
&gt;spectre dies to provi cta fleet
---
&gt;spectre cries.
---
This timeline about correct?
---
then why has there been ZERO releases from ccp on this? and why did it start the same day as ccp issues a retraction on the sp sales?

The leadership is still the same as it was back then, makes you think

We are in same alliance . Just fyi

The goon cultural model absolutely requires a powerful external enemy

There's not really no. what is it you're trying to achieve?
---
They became neo-Goons as soon as they stopped trying to kill the game and started working to keep money in Mitten's pocket.
---
The two aren't exclusive of each other.
---
I haven't got the time to listen to this today - Can I get a tldl (too long, didn't listen from someone?)
---
That's a bull!
---
Dont believe anything Mittens says.
---
Dont forget that basic industry require like at least 4 structures, much more if you cannot afford rigged sotyio
---
Or lokis ideally
---
at least ochre gives you something. the drifters are basically WOW raidbosses. welcome to WOW
---
You know technically you can buy skill points for money without that promotion right? Sooooo ya. It's a bit of a weak argument honestly.
---
I get it though. They goons trying to deflect is a classic strategy and one they have used successfully the past. But this one is really really weak.
---
The spikes are probably the nostalgia veterans coming back and going, "Nope. Still shit / worse."

Wrong assets before citadels were much safer as you had stations

---
Be NCPL in 2019 and post on reddit how bad goons are for over bloobing you ... While you did the same for other alliances for years ....
---
Which were conquerable, and if conquered your assets were locked out, until you retake.
---
Now everything you "loose" isn't actually lost.
---
&gt;Why dont you STFU for once kiss ass mittani init boy

This is your standard of mature, considered argumentation?
---
Good sir, I am no dirty blobber. I am an honorable lowsec solo and microgang pvper. How dare you!
---
&gt; ... because ccp ...

CCP have screwed up in many ways but in all PVP MMOs, the players eventually gravitate to one side to be as safe as they can and stomp the other players.

I can only surmise that it's someone who likes Cheetos...? Kind of like a dig at the doritos basement dwellers maybe...?

---
There *was* more to EVE than Null.
---
Essential oils!
---
my understanding is that while the objectives in tribute, etc were accomplished, we were going to go and screw around in malpais for a bit.
---
Way to repeat mittens.
---
neither is adding in good pve content and not dumb pve content
---
\- Take 500m loan  
---
\- Buy skill injector , because there's arbitrage oppurtunity of 100m
---
\-  Loose it at jita undock.
---
My net worth was 100m at the time.
---
Fear, greed and the safety of Goons' capital umbrella. 
---
* Ultimately, the majority of people are selfish. 
---
As long as Mittens doesn't get in their way or make them too uncomfortable they will keep joining.

Wtf I hate goons now.

Such an enlightening alternative perspective to a discussion.

---
Well, there's your first mistake.
---
Wheres my free supee
---
Ship spinning competition.
---
We blobbed with skill, not numbers &lt;wink&gt;
---
Unless you're the real-life hetero lifemate of an EVE newbie, and therefore know their personality and gaming habits intimately, it's impossible to say which skills they will and will not use. The only person who can make that determination is the newbie, and the only way for them to do so is to try everything. Training everything up to 3's is such a paltry investment of training time compared to the tens of millions of skillppints they'll eventually accrue.
---
I don't recall what the multipliers are on the Magic 14, but even if they were all 1x skills, you're talking about 70 days of training that doesn't enable any new activities for a newbie. People think mining is a boring-ass activity that leads to newbros quitting, but just watching a skill queue will kill their interest in the game just as fast. They don't need to race immediately towards maxing out a T2 hull. *It's okay* for them to be less than perfect at any given job. A newbie in a T1 logi hull is better than one who can't fly any logi at all because they're still waiting on Command Destroyers 5 to finish.
---
Both Mittens and Xenuria are mentally unbalanced, Mittens just happens to have a better mask hiding his most of the time.

AI is thought of as trying to mimic human decision making. Initially it was very rudimentary, just doing basic calculations. What we perceive as AI has evolved as our technology has.

---
The region of providence has been overfished and the dead horse continues to be beaten.
---
Spectre's influx of having 5-20 new players per ganked with no idea how to play has been replaced by mostly regulars and the occasional new player. People who could use the pickup pvp funtimes can't find them... leadership slightly shifted from us dominant to eu dominant 
---
other than that i really don't know what's up with spectre, they still have some good fc's and fun times but they're not as much pickup pvp as they used to be.

You'll have to dig through all of my other posts and read if you want a better answer. I think I've repeated the same information 5 times already.

Nothing is "Skynet" level AI. Read up on AI if you want a better understanding, but what we consider AI has evolved as our technology has.

Im not a highsec player, I'm just someone who's playstyle has been completely patched out of the game. Yet the overwhelming response when I say `I want to fly battlecruisers at nullsec entry systems` is lol just adapt.
---
No, thanks. 
---
I don't think i have much use for more of your confusion.
---
Y’all had pvp content until you decided to blue up 3/4 of null so you could krab 24/7. Instead of driving conflict you created mechanics that drove people out of null. 
---
Essentially the goon campaign to “ruin everyone else’s game” came back to bite you in the ass and now CCP is trying desperately to clean up your mess. 
---
You played yourselves.
---
Its an advanced concept called shrogingers mittani

So brave

this is the best market simulator in the world

Markets bounce back. 
---
Games don't do so well.
---
Right click on plex after you drag it to station inventory, create contract, enter your active character's name, log in, accept contract. Buh-boom
---
Yeah the drifter combat suit looks pretty good but I also think it's cybernetically meshed with their body or something.
---
Well Mittens is wrong again, because during one of the presentations, they brought up the AI and hinted that more could be coming, but it went over peoples heads. CCP had this planned for awhile now.
---
skill of pressing the cyno
---
That Russian oil tycoon that funded RED managed to throw the PLEX market all over the place.
---
None of those Alliances were able to stand on their own. They were goon puppets and as soon as they had no puppet master, they folded. 
---
So I guess what you're saying is Init would have folded as well because they need a puppet master?
---
Look at this dude's comment history. It's hilarious.
---
Isnt much of the stain and stress you speak of caused because the mega alliances own to much space to protect? Not to mention how big things get when you bring coalitions into the picture. 
---
I noticed the most frustrated groups in this drifter conflict are those who own the most soverenity. They for sure have the power to defend it, like many have said the danger is trivial. But the logistics of it are the frustration, again another sign that your soverenity empire is bigger than it probably should be. 
---
The way you speak of renters makes my cringe, I was once in QFC and honestly I enjoyed it more than mega alliances. But having an overlord above you means everyone ultimately leaves QFC. Even though I commend Goons for actually creating one of the more interesting small gang areas of space. No moons and jump bridges is really frustrating. It means everyone ultimately leaves. 
---
If it's too much of a frustration to own soverenity even though defending it isnt hard may be you shouldn't own so many systems? That's kind of the crux of our situation. The debate here is could the drifters be a way to shrink the systems larger alliances have, which in turn would hopefully create a more diverse nullsec. Many larger alliances own so much space in my experiance only 5-10% of it is actually used efficently.
---
Game mechanics support going trusolo in Null? 
---
What a lame ass fucking excuse. I would respect "We're bitches and we're going to bitch up if we want to" more than that pathetic attempt to justify it.
---
Somehow I don't see entirety of null agreeing with mittens because he has a manchild accident.
---
Which were conquerable, and if conquered your assets were locked out, until you ~~retake.~~ just contract sale in situ or stick an alt in the new owning alliance and extract your stuff.
---
splitting hairs imo. if you didn't care, you wouldn't tryhard post, regardless of the reason for either
---
So you’re as bad as NC and PL used to be. Thanks for confirming.
---
After 8 years every home is the same tbh.

i mean, mittens was in talks wit gobbins, hedliner, vince drakan
---
"I just want to talk shit and make no real point" 
---
if hes right, hes right
---
Before he was burned to death maybe.
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
Im saying that because i saw some packs selling on steam. With free account i have access to everything or have to buy one of those packs?
---
And the catch up is because the game have what..15 years? hehe
---
Im so lost. Any recommendable guides to get me started?
---
You used alts or CCP to move stuff out:-)
---
Goons have never been close to the path of "hero" or even "admirable villain".
---
&gt; A newbie in a T1 logi hull is better than one who can't fly any logi at all because they're still waiting on Command Destroyers 5 to finish.
---
I wasn’t claiming you needed perfect skills for a very small subsection of skills, more that getting into T2 hulls is a worthy thing for Newbies to do - training the magic 14 mightn’t get you into super fancy stuff, but it allows you to get into specialised ships relatively quickly whilst making them effective even in T1 ships... a newbie in a Bantam with the magic 14 trained is vastly more effective than a newbie with a similar amount of SP that’s spread out over things that they’ll at best use once in a blue moon, at worst they’ll never use... This is even more easy than it used to be with the starting 750ksp which allows them to knock off one or two basic skills (I’d usually advocate for Drones V).
---
Exactly the kind of comment I would expect from an inexplicably unaborted Downs baby.
---
You can't think of a single reason other than that?
---
"It was fine when they did it but utter bullshit when it was done to them"
---
I still have hope that CCP will have the balls to do a full burn down of Null.
---
Why would you ignore _50_ 75% of the _human_ eve ship body?
---
IF you check the game map geography, the only ways you get to Malpais from KQK are either:
---
1. Through Trib, Vale then regional gate into TKE.
---
2. Venal, then Regional gate into Perrigan
---
3. Trib, Vale, then Geminate, TKE and again regional gate into Drones.
---
There is no fathomable way to go to Malpais without above routes unless you planned to go all the way around counterclockwise through Legacy space.
---
With that in mind, removing the structures you would need to build the above routes does not support an intention to go to Malpais.
---
Mittens isn’t an idiot he knows the Drones territorial restrictions as much as anyone else. He’s using this as a weak excuse to bamboozle a playerbase that is too young to remember how logistically taxing an assault into drones is.
---
Maybe both sides are doing/ have done stupid shit?
---
You should never quote stainguy. It’s bad for your health.
---
I don't not why people call you a shit poster when you post truth such as this.
---
Which is why I said its a start, implying that the new change alone isn't enough. Based on previous experiences with Eve I don't hold a lot of hope that it will be built upon any time soon/at all but I hope its the start of something better to come.
---
Lol we were kings of lowsec cause we were the best at capture the flag
---
I don't think anyone in NC really gave a fuck except a few carebears that honestly should have never been allowed to join. Alot of us are excited to not have to defend retards any more and get back to killing stuff

Isn’t the entire point of pvp in this game to make your own content?  What kind of pvp content do you want?  Built in RvB or something?

Repost

Slow down there big shoots, this doesn't fit the narrative that The Mittani (pbuh) is an insane cringy sociopathic cheetosomething that is throwing a hissy-fit over something that only hurts Goons and everyone else is benefiting from.
---
No it isn't, not for the most part. There are a few left, and they are the ones that started the crack down on the racism and sexism.
---
If your alliance only has 30 pvpers you're better of going to lowsec
---
TEST were always more goon than goon themselves.
---
The original goons left ages ago goonswarm, and TEST actually refused to become the insane empire that goons were trying to when they were together, they walked away from it (and thus their leadership is considered mentally ill by mittani).
---
TLDR danger is bad k. Ccpls
---
This assuming his heterosexual was planned. It was not.
---
Quite a while back, we all had to have a "Titan Sitting" alt, that stayed in the Titan, in a POS until needed. This may be what's needed of us facing the new unpredictable threat.  Not saying it a great mechanic but, it may be what we need to adapt to.
---
Keep that shit up an I'm going to tell your mom. See how much of a smartass you are when she cuts off your internet.
---
The skill train for market PvP is quick compared to everything else. Consider getting a couple of alpha alts into brave/horde. Those markets need stocking and you can get a very nice mark up doing so. Use the alliances hauling services to move goods into null. You will make good isk and it requires low sp, so you won't be 15 years behind at all doing this.
---
While you're right, this is all pretty obvious and I doubt anyone who hasn't already grasped it isn't going to be illuminated by an explanation.  They're too busy reveling in grr goons schadenfreude to care about whether or not something is fundamentally bad gameplay.
---
The go-to list of newbro corps is Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Brave Newbies and Brand Newbros for nullsec, and Eve-Uni for all areas. However, I encourage you to have a look through /r/evejobs and find a smaller group if that's more to your liking - many groups nowadays will take in newbros.
---
On a sidenote, mittani and his wife (she is there too) have a very bad reputation on SA forums ... well, dabigred has an even worse one because he joined strictly for the brownie points from eve. :)
---
did you know stainguy has so much negative karma he is on a white-list just so he can post in r/eve
---
A free account has access to all Tech 1/Faction subcapital ships and tech 2 small/medium weapons (soon free players will lose Tech 2 medium drones, they can fly Tech 2 rapid heavy missile launchers, a battleship weapon). As for DLC packs, the Star pack is currently $25 which contains a month of Omega (subscribed account status), 500 plex (can either be used for a 2nd month of Omega or sold for ~1.9B ISK) and 2 Multi-character training certificates (worth approx 1B each).
---
Additionally, if you sign up using a referral link (I can DM you one if you want, otherwise I think there’s a pinned on on the /r/eve discord) then you get 750000SP as a gift (approx 12 days of training for an Omega, 24 days worth for an Alpha). Full disclaimer, if you go Omega on a referral account then the referrer gets a kickback of 350 PLEX and potentially other items.
---
As for catchup, if you want to be a Market tycoon then there’s not a massive number of skills to train, do note though that there are people who can manipulate the entire market of a single item if they really feel like it - Tech 3 Cruiser subsystems are often manipulated quite a bit.
---
When you decide to ruin everyone's game, and you are this big, you become the enemy of the game.

How do you kill stuff if you won't undock?

That seems a nice advice. Too bas thats chinese for me haha.

Theres a pack on sale at steam..you think its a good buy?

Maybe if alliance are having logistical issues maintaining territory they are too overextended with too many assets to tolerate the emergent gameplay resulting from a new mechanic.

Just saiyan.

Direct dev intervention is literally the opposite of "emergent gameplay"

That would require a complete redesign of the citadel system, nullsec infrastructure and other game mechanics .... it needs to be done for sure, but this at least has some immediate effects. :)
---
Wow you sound like carebears....
---
"content".
---
whats good for my corp and good for my personal style are two different things my killboard speaks for itself

If you have 100s of timers to defend, isn't it because you have too many citadels? Why not unanchor a few?
---
Yeah there's still some botting Ravens to recruit.

tl;dr:   Absolutely is a good time to join.   Jump in.

Since you enjoy market PvP I thought I'd drop a link to a blog I've been following.   It's by a guy who (re-)joined Eve a month or so ago and only does market arbitrage.   This might give you some tips.

---
Actually this is due to bot filters as i post to much. I am in 5 top posters on this subreddit. It is nice that you had to check it
---
&gt; Drifters require 24/7 gunners online spread out across controlled space, this means 30+ dudes are tasked round the clock to stop new timers from forming. if you don't kill them they keep reinforcing structures if you do they respawn elsewhere and rinse and repeat.  
---
&gt;there is no reprieve and no way to beat it temporarily and move on. As far as we can tell the drifters respawn elsewhere and keep causing problems. not killing them means mass numbers of timers, killing them means having to travel all over for preventing timers 24/7
---
Or you can stop your pointless struggling and accept the inevitable outcome. Our lord and savior Tyrannos has decided that our empires must burn and our krab fields be sown with salt, and so it shall be. Praise by to Tyrannos.

Yeah I member.... People complained so much that CCP introduced fatigue and completely changed how sov works...

All the huge null-blocs are bad? And they all share a measure of fault in what is destroying EVE?

Fucking Goons crying they can't carebear and have to protect their structures. Ohh the fucking horror.

Lets see how well they prosecute this highsec war when one of their own line members is talking about this being more of a problem than they're actually admitting.
---
Seems legit.
---
Nah, I understood you. You didn't understand me. Try again.
---
Goons are like the MAGA crowd in Eve
---
we have it solved by sheer numbers of gunners but those gunners are our people who coordinate fleets and run recon. any of 200 skirmish commanders can take a high sec fleet out, thats easy.
---
"make them give us isk"
---
Alright bud, any other requests?
---
Mebbe you would need less dudes if you actually lived where you had citadels?

Its scary the false reality you live in querns.

oh look, stainguy sucking goon dick

i've stated this, and many other people have, many times

none of the good ones
---
I mean, keep screeching about narratives. Perhaps plug your ears with your fingers and scream nonsensical maledictions to keep the Goon devil out. I'm sure this is a good use of your time.
---
you mean delve? one of the most populated and active regions in eve?
---
Less structures, less gunners needed. That simple, right?
---
QFT
---
So that's where goons learned their trade. :)
---
"I HATE THIS, WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY DEFEND THE SPACE AND STRUCTURES WE HAVE. WHY CANT WE JUST SPREAD OUT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND HAVE EVERYONE LEAVE US ALONE"
---
isnt this the entirety of the eve player base?
---
I guess we will see then
---
All of your points would be solve if you just had the citadels you actually needed and not one at every gate, just saying.
---
Shouldn't be a problem with 50k characters, no?
---
In Delve, Mittens fucks you.
---
This is the most acceptable answer.
---
Says the... definition of that phrase?  Is this a trick question?  
---
"Emergent gameplay" refers to gameplay that (get this) emerges from within the game.  
---
Devs shoving a new system into place isn't "emergent"—it's declarative.
---
There could be emergent gameplay that *results* from that change, but the invasions themselves are not emergent in the least.
---
If the mighty goonswarm army, can’t field more then 30 gunners to cover their regions...yeah you all just say “we are overextended, time to shrink our claim.
---
I never said you all were good at this stuff
---
I wholeheartedly await your proposals. :)
---
funny how something is ''broken'' as soon as the big nullblocks dont like it or it doesnt support them.
---
but if it does and other playstiles suffer from it we have to hear ''adapt or die'', HTFU, ''get fucked''
---
so, ill gladly say HTFU, adapt or die just like i/we had to...

---
I see. Well could you describe how you analyzed your data and then how that led you to these conclusions?
---
I ask because it is hard to know if your conclusions are solid without seeing what you are seeing. I’m inclined to believe you but doing so blindly doesn’t sit that well with me.
---
i asked you to link because i thought you had another alt that did your pvp since aze is a f1 monkey toon,  used a hull tanked leshak in the at and thinks hes above normal monkeys because he flies hugins.
---
what about this shows that your killboard speaks for itself? you have a very low amount of kills especially for being in a bloc for 2+ years and a toon that old.
---
Don't forget literally years of using the EVE logserver to automatically feed pings when cynos opened in lowsec.
---
You're straight up wrong bro.
---
Hellraiser is amazing. Hellraiser II is okay (they changed the Cenobites from morally ambiguous to evil), but Hellraiser: Bloodlines (ie: Hellraiser in space) and the other sequels were *awful*.
---
you don't even need the pack to get started, alphas will do fine for starters. No idea about the packs and the value they provide, but I'd avoid the steam client and get client and account directly from ccp, make sure you use refer a friend on your extra accounts (from your main account, and main account if you can)
---
this is my refer a friend link. you get some bonus sp(750k),  if you create account using that. Don't use the bonus sp right away, get your bearing ingame first.

---
Gee, I wasn't aware I was supposed to not refresh a forum. Please, O Master, educate me in the ways of not appearing to care too much. This is a thing that sane people worry about.
---
What group are you with in Albion?
---
Learn to type please
---
i think we can all agree that super application is a bit broken.
---
but hey, they are still in the game solo/smallgang roaming is shittier than ever. i/we had to ''adapt or die''. so why should it suddenly be different just because you think something is unfair?
---
ah okay, so do people NOT have their own lowclass bearholes? Sorry, I've always assumed bearholing worked the same in lowclass as it did in highclass. 
---
If that's not the case the OP can disregard what I said and take better, more accurate advice then.
---
For a group that 'hate' bob/nc/pl, they sure as hell copied a lot from BoB.
---
Every system in the game is ....gasp...developed by the...wait for it... developers. Devs put a system in place and gameplay emerges from it.
---
may sound dumb but its true and im not a goon
---
Solo right now, started playing (again since alpha/early beta) last week
---
here's the thing I don't want it gone I want it tweaked to be better. damage from 15,000km and no ability to probe them down to fight back... yea need a cepter volunteer to burn for 40 minutes to get a ping over there :P
---
not really.
---
if the drifters spawn in a system and shoot structures, unless you have 0 structures in that system then the number of structures won't matter. if you have 1, they will shoot it, if you have 100, they'll shoot 1 of them. they've still shot a structure, it still requires a response.
---
which means "own less systems" except, people are already more densely packed than ever before.
---
It really does speak for itself. You're just another f1 monkey is what it says.
---
you can but the sp isnt magically made out of thin air something when injectors came out ccp said they wouldnt do
---
That Goon's name? Albert Einstein.
---
wuts a moon
---
Goon gunners get paid? Wut
---
&gt;come in our hole
---
Where do you think the entire game came from? Did it just emerge from some amorphous blob? No, it was designed and developed and gameplay emerged from those game systems put in place. now a new game system has been put in place and people want to cry foul. 
---
"Why can't Eve be the same as it was \[insert your perceived golden years\]"
---
yes the game will be healthy without 30+k chars.
---
you dumb fuck
---
This.
---
Yeah, this seems like ccp enforcing a hard space/active pvper ratio since players are unnable to do it ourselves.
---
Cause system cost index is a thing and moon mining is now an active gameplay.  But fuck us right
---
not the staple doctrine ships these can literally be bought out
---
payment from PvE activities, not from the alliance.
---
How fucking stupid... does one have to be... to make this comment
---
Ahahahahah you did the joke.
---
Yeah but do you want to give the keys to a veritable cap killing machine to just anyone?
---
People didnt have those already?  Both my ceptor cyno alts have gunnery skills.  You dont even nessicarily need the skills against drifters.
---
and i dont want supers to be gone, just tweaked to be a little better.
---
not able to apply absurd damage to subcaps while still beeing able to tackle stuff with 9k/ms sirens. (this just beeing one of many imo ''broken'' things)
---
the answers i got to this were, you already know it.. ''adapt or die'', ''just seed dreads'' and so on..
---
so again, why should it suddenly be different?
---
Oh
---
Youre ACTUALLY delusional. 
---
Ok
---
I like how everyone is saying "dont be afraid to lose ships" or "dont look at your kb".
---
And yet whenever you go roam anywhere 99 percent of people just dock up.
---
Yes, I'm delusional for refreshing a forum. Truly, we've cracked the case, here.
---
God forbid you should have to guard your structures.
---
I know you are not new player, you haven't seen this coming ?
---
I did not see it coming from CCP in the form of an NPC wave, but i saw it coming .... CCP always changes the game mechanics, playing field, when one side becomes too powerfull and the game is in danger of becoming stale.
---
You are part of the coalition that made the game stale, maybe your vision is obstructed by your subjectiveness.
---
Link yours then me leetsauce.  
---
Narrator voice:  hell link someone’s that looks leetsauce but won’t be his
---
They are used in certain factions Loyalty Point stores in exchange for loyalty points + certain tags to redeem an item. I'm not sure which in particular but those tags aren't worth very much individually. Stockpile it or sell it in Jita.
---
That’s not at all what he said
---
No, you're part of the group claiming others are elite pvpers.
---
Where have panfam stated they are elite pvpers?
---
So you don't have numbers to take care of your space and citadels? Also, lol at "op" part.
---
No youre delusional because you believe your own lies.
---
If you use Linux then Steam proton let's you play Eve without having to mess with wine/lutris. It's how I've been playing and the performance is solid.
---
Those are all needed.  You don’t know what system or gate a Volta gang will spawn in and if you’re in anything paper thin or need to emergency dock your supers/rorquals because (insert random IRL need here) then you need to dock it up.
---
Name one lie.
---
Bring back the AT.
---
or it means that drifters spawned at midnight and there was fuck all you could do about it until you get home from work 16 hours later?
---
Densely packed since when lol. Literally 70% of null systems don't have more than 2 people in it.
---
Thanks for responding.
---
Thanks for clarifying, this makes a little more sense of why it's so annoying.
---
But why spin it like it's forcing your thousands of member to retreat when a small weak long SIG could handle it. Then, declaring war on hisec pubbies whom have no connection to this at all when in reality the ones poking and making fun of you on reddit are in null and may very well may be in your own alliance or list of blues?
---
The devs made every ship. Does that mean anything involving ships isn't emergent gameplay?
---
Solo gila. Less mass on the hole
---
like, what do you think the majority of fleet compositions are comprised of? ships that shoot other ships... some one has to fly them. you don't need 250 special snowflakes in your fleet.
---
Or you can just ignore it and accept the timer. It's a non issue when you have a thousand Titans
---
Don't field so many structures next time? I get it's annoying but just HTFU, more than likely this is only for a period of time. If it was perpetual, than yes, I would agree with you.
---
One for every gate, 4 for every keepstar, two for every fortizar, also couple at two different planets.
---
What a joke. Lived in null, these people put keepstars at gates now even and have no less than 20 ef'ing citadels in every system.
---
the issue is that volume of timers. everyone had to go home due to pve creating lots of timers that we now have to insure are protected. some fo them are xl structures forth hundreds of billions

because players groups are more densely packed than ever...
---
/wave from Raleigh. Let’s have our own Eve party but on the beach with blackjack and hookers.
---
if you were expecting players to turn up for the timers, sure.
---
but, we're not.
---
It's no clarification. These people have a shit load of unneeded citadels. Just take a stroll sometime. Even empty systems would have like 10 citadels and a Keepstar on the gate. Of course it's going to be ridiculous to defend all of it.
---
They have 3 CSM members.  Thinks if he keeps suxing on it they will give him the gate he wants
---
Oh no, someone looked at my bio and posted it to r/eve and tried to connect dots that aren't there, it's the end of the world!

* REEEE Goons have a sprawling and mostly empty empire they can't defend / Goons are crammed in one region and should be forced to spread out PLEASE NERF

---
Sure, people have low class bear holes but *typically* if it involves running c3 sites they use a c3 static. It's way different from high class space due to game mechanics. If you live in a c6 and get rolled into, people are unlikely to krab all of your sites in 2 hours. This is not the case in a c3, so you could very well go weeks without a good set of sites to run. Do people live in c3s and run the sites? Sure, but usually that is not the norm and it is one of the secondary income methods behind things like PI or manufacturing.
---
don't keep letting your rage boner for PL set you up for bad posting.
---
No, it mostly means you don't read very well.  See the very last sentence of the post you're responding to.
---
In your example, the ships themselves are not emergent gameplay.  
---
"Emergent gameplay" re:drifter invasions would be if, say, the Mittens null-blue + HS invasion notion were followed through on, but there is nothing emergent about the invasions themselves, just as there is nothing emergent about the existence of ships themselves.
---
It's pretty nice to see the tables turned here. 
---
Yeah, I can see that there are some issues with Drifters, but null needs a shakeup. This probably isn't even enough. 
---
There are literally tens of thousands of you. You will figure this out. When you do, please remember how upset you were when you were mildly inconvenienced. Then go back to saying "adapt or die" or whatever canned bullshit response you're chucking this week.
---
They would just go elsewhere, the imperium isn't the only group in the game. I wonder if you forgot that.
---
What's your point? Did anybody ever think NCPL were the "good guys"?
---
Stop hes gonna hurt himself.
---
I would add that we don't mind the Drifters all that much; it is the total lack of communication from CCP.  Every major game mechanic change, in any MMO, ever... has been in patch notes.  This was not.  CCP has hinted that we missed some clue, but I haven't yet heard what it was.  But, to have something with completely changes the game for us this much, without warning, and without any information on how long we are to be forced to play whack-a-mole... is a little bit frustrating.
---
It doesn't.
---
But spontaneous explosions doesn't seem like a better option.
---
i agree null needs a shakeup but balanced mechanics are needed
---
With other words: I'm a carebear and I want isk for doing anything.
---
Teddy, I was on comms when you lost that rev to Brave dont try to lie.
---
There is no real likelihood of that being the case
---
when you say things like this, citation is a must.
---
Cant you just click on the system and look at the percentage?
---
Or until you decide to apply for a new corp/alliance. Then for some reason your killboard matters.
---
Aryth has a stockpile of ore he wants to sell in Jita.
---
I saw Drifter battleships in Highsec and I'm still laughing at the REEE, because fundamentally it shows a failure to adapt to changing battlefield conditions. You're talking about using PvP pilots to fight off the Drifters. Well, what the hell are your PvE pilots doing? Gate camping? Have any of you thought of talking to rival alliances to find a way totackle the threat efficiently, or is everyone busy turtling up to prevent their enemies from taking their shit while they try to handle it solo? Improvise, adapt, overcome. Or whine on a forum about how you don't like facing a challenge.
---
Overheating is always a bad option with this fit, mainly because all the modules are susceptible to massive heat damage if done for too long.
---
Frankly though, there's no need to heat the pizza modules at all. Anything can get alpha'd off the field with the DPS of the jalapeno smartbombs.
---
apparently there's no time zone restrictions on drifters fucking up your shit.
---
if all of your active TZ logs in and find drifters have spent their work day reffing a bunch of your structures. congrats, looks like you're spending an evening babysitting timers in case something comes along to shoot it again.
---
Yeah but all the input from those programs are based on player input.
---
You could make a program having players input adms and it would have the same effect.
---
Not whining about new mechanics on a forum, that's for sure.
---
stop drinking panfam coolaid retard
---
Balanced to suit your playstyle is what I believe you mean.
---
&gt; we want to pvp
---
Firstly:
---
There’s nothing wrong with wanting to join and be part of a huge group that is essentially “winning” eve monetarily and militarily. But don’t pretend that this about pvp. 
---
If you want pvp, take a heap of guys and join smaller groups. Empower smaller alliances. Work to break up the super blocs. 
---
Secondly:
---
If you want your space to be safe, I guess you have to keep it that way now. 
---
It just doesn’t seem like you’ve rationalized the great REEE that you think people don’t understand. You just summarized all the other posts about this so far.
---
excellent shitpost my friend.
---
stop talking about balanced mechanics when you profited from ''unbalanced'' mechanics for the last 3+years...
---
I did not play around drone regions back when wars were around there, why is it taxing ?
---
PS: Also, not nullseccer.
---
because supers don't do that form 15 km's. they would have to speed minutes off fighter's travel to do that.
---
Yeah great, and so and so before them, and whosawhats before them, and the whoarethoseguys before them.  What's your point?  I couldn't tell if there was one, but then again I feel like I barely made it through that brick of google translate flavored "english" you just put out there.
---
I wouldn't mind if they went after krabs and low power structures. But this shit is ridiculous.
---
You nullseccers are a bunch of fuckwits. CCP tries something new and all you do is bitch about it. Wah no rewards Wah too much work getting 30 dudes to man the guns. Then why the fuck would you retards anchor all those structures in the first place?! 
---
Hang yourselves in a forest far away from the cities!
---
Err, I'm not lying? I'm very accepting and very long since over the revenant loss, especially since ccp reimbursed it which put some much needed isk in my wallet. It doesn't change the fact that the only "dirt" you have on me is years old and nobody gives a fuck about.
---
Seems to be based on # of structures, goons have a ton of them.
---
Thank you for saying this. I've lost count the amount of times I've been told HTFU, adapt, or get your own supers. Last time I checked there are dozens of ship types that aren't capitals in this game.
---
I was part of Catch v1 so I remember. I had the best time in EvE ever then though, so what's your point?
---
people choosing to ignore mechanics doesn't make then unbalanced when another group uses them.
---
Welcome to EVE dude!
---
It's a big grind over here. I'm happy to see some of the Twitch folks taking interest in the game.
---
I would recommend joining a newbean corp, such as BRAVE, Pandemic HORDE, etc.
---
Horde is the best though \*(winks)\*
---
You seem to. And it's not dirt man, you're just a hypocrite. You're gonna come in here and be all "fuck goons lel, give upvotes" when you're the poster boy for using Goon Money.
---
You mean the one leading one of the biggest alliances that changed from pets to a standalone alliance and also is on the csm now? Yea forgettable dude
---
And I'm sure that will happen literally every day, right?
---
if you cant trust your members to be gunners then perhaps its a recruiting issue not a CCP issue.
---
Many thanks

I get it now. EVE is a toilet. Goons are the toilet paper and mittens is the biggest piece of shit floating in the bowl. It all makes sense now.  
---
.... wait, who's the asshole????
---
&gt;Drifters require 24/7 gunners online spread out across controlled space, this means 30+ dudes are tasked round the clock to stop new timers from forming.
---
Maybe you are holding too much space? Otherwise it shouldn't be a problem to have the manpower to deal with it.
---
Imagine being this delusional that you actually believe all my isk or even a sizable chunk came from goons, it didn't. I kept my income separated from goons. I was highly and quite openly critical of goons when I went back in the second time and anyone who knew me then will confirm that, but keep creating a false narrative.
---
How many structures have been hit twice?
---
Fixing the problem by burning a bunch of people out and making them quit can't be the best solution imo.
---
Maybe CCP wants several smaller groups to own few systems instead of 1 megagroup owning several and not actually using most of those systems...
---
bro my search history...its why I'm going to hell actually.
---
when that mechanic is available to everyone - yes it does.
---
lets stop being coy - you're talking about goons spending 3 years shitting out titans and supers. they had to develop a region from the ground up after being displaced from the north. the 'not goons' team already had their own region (or in some cases multiple regions) that could have been or should already have had the infrastructure goons were having to build from the ground up.
---
the only difference is goons bothered, the other team didn't.
---
"I didn't think the face eating leopards would eat my face." says idiot, who cheered on face eating leopards.

They're not quitting. Relax.

Eh you are implying you know what you’re talking about which frankly I’d assume you’re a dumbass.  Aze is a pretty well respected member of the community.
---
ok - that seems like a decent win for steam.
---
Do you know that the game can and will change and whatever gameplay emerges from those changes is emergent gameplay ya fuckin retard?
---
I just listened to the whole deal, I'm absolutely in awe of the discipline of the bulk of goonswarm for not saying "Mittens is a GIGANTIC asshat. Can we get anyone else to lead us?"
---
Truly, Mittens needs to just stop. Now he is threatening to ruin HS....Wake me when he tries to spin this as anything but complete and total failure.
---
How many guys does it take to defend one system from these drifter attacks?
---
Teddy, ffs... I literally talked to you after you rejoined goons after the super losses, and held an Avatar for a bit so you could finish up the rorq harvesting you were doing to afford it. Cmon man... Now youre just embarrassing yourself.
---
I have quite literally never heard of it being used, though since I'm a carpenter IRL i have some pretty limited tech knowledge.  
---
PL never used anything like that as far as I'm aware at the alliance level, I've no clue about particular persons doing it on their own, but this is the first I've ever heard of something like that.
---
Not shocked though, CCP sends players way to much raw information.
---
I think goons are cringy but you can’t really argue about his ability to organize a huge group like that.   Love him or hate him.
---
some don't require hitting twice, for example the horde jump gate that was destroyed on the first day.
---
as for others, i don't know. a high power structure won't generate a killmail if it gets hit twice, and a low power one won't generate a kill mail if it's defended upon being hit for the second time.
---
if for example, the structure in question is a sotiyo churning out supers/titans - are you really going to ignore the timer that could offline the production because "something might not turn up"? not a risk i'd want to take, personally.

You can check the full stream to check that this video isn't to post shit. I farm several days in the row without issues. The previous ship loses not related for this bug. Most of them related to k-space - Abyss space connection issues and for that I not shitting on CCP, because it can be a problem with the connection to their servers related to provider or whatever.
---
I face this bug, not the first time, that why I trying to fix it by moving modules from one slot to another (before this time - this helps me to fix this issue). Once I got only two guns active, but there was last room in T3 Abyss and I stay alive.

All you sperglords talking about how Drifters are going to finally beat back the Goonie Menace (so you don't have to) are just bottomlessly ignorant. Drifters just aren't going to do the things you think they're going to do. We haven't lost a single structure to Drifters and we aren't about to start. One guy lost a Hel because he just didn't have a chance to warp off before they shredded him, but I'm pretty sure Goons aren't the only ones who rat in supers  so maybe you should curb your enthusiasm a tiny bit. What annoys Goons - and what should annoy anyone who wants to fight nullsec wars - is the fact that, for the first time in Eve's history, PVE content is effectively mandatory for everyone who owns space.

There we go and the guy finally shows us who he is and it's 0x. I used to think you were chill, what happened? (by the way I talked a lot about rorqs and did have a total of 3 at one point but got rid of them pretty early on, same with the tar as well but that did get me a few bil profit. I had an athanor set up in lowsec that I reacted in that was my actual income once I could afford all the mats and keep lines running full swing I got rid of the effort shit.)
---
When you control so much, damaging 'your' game is damaging 'the' game.
---
Damaging 'your' game is not bad when it affects a small # of ppl.
---
Remember that this is a sandbox game and that you set your own win conditions. Wallet balance, kill board, and all the other metrics matter only if they matter to you.
---
Also, information is an asset. Don't undervalue what you know.

Super saiyan, even

A populist hard-right nationalist being elected in supposedly the world's premiere democracy is very ironic.

Almost as ironic as comparing Trump of RL to Mittani of EVE ... as mittani is ultra-left wing fanatic.

I comment on WAAAAAAY too much porn on reddit to link this account to my GitHub  
---
and I am right. That's the cool thing about facts, they don't care about the opinions of the ..... less informed.
---
&gt; when that mechanic is available to everyone - yes it does.
---
just like those mechanics are available to anyone, everyone is affected by the drifters we have now.
---
in the end, its what you make out of it. maybe try that instead of crying on reddit
---
The main lack of participation is bringing an NPSI fleet to support a sov entosis operation.  Literally picking the least fun part of eve and asking NPSI players to join it is a recipe for disaster.

Test is pretty much the closest you can come to a hisec entity that is active on reddit (and i guess chribba) since it owns some trade citadels.

No, I'm going to cry foul when people use the phrase "emergent gameplay" to mean literally anything they want it to mean.
---
I'll offer a counterpoint: only use autopilot when you understand why so many people say not to use it.

I use it all the time, but never carelessly.

Pretty sure that hasn't been happening.

A couple of turrets on the belly of the Minmatar slasher clip into each other, I know they rotate and shit but.... it’s just When it’s sitting in dock. There’s no clearance between them. I... I really don’t know why it bothers me and I feel dumb for even bringing it up. I just wanted to see if there was a clever workaround. A different caliber projectile turret or moving them around or something. I did say it was a pointless gripe.
---
why?

Lol what's this 2 month later comment. You're downvoted to Oblivion because you're an idiot, take the hint and get better in the field
---
if you have your home WH and another one connected via its static cant you roll all the other exits keeping just the static open, then keep an eye on the signatures list for both holes and assume the door is locked unless a new signature spawns?
---
i dont know much about WH btw.
---
yeah?
---
but nobody's saying the mechanic is biased towards one group over another - we're saying it's equally shit for everyone.
---
Even if Goons don't attack moon mining OP un Low sec. low SEC could become an insane warfield over the moons if the embargo goes well.
---
Anyhow. This could be fun. -its a Game, Remember?-
---
*shrug* ok.
---
Massive increase on load on logistics personnel leads to logistics personnel burning out. Unable to maintain logistics across all of your owned space means contracting into a smaller space. More densely packing and encouraging even more bluing up.
---
All groups that aren't as big as goons and test are gonna get chipped away and die off because they can't maintain. If they disproportionately targeted larger entities/clusters of citadels or something i could see that working as a benefit to fragment null power. But as a pure random chance a small entity takes more damage from being hit than a large entity simply because they don't have as much mass to absorb it with.
---
1 - Removing asset safety from non-keepstars simply rewards those with keepstars, so you are just making fortress delve even more fortress-y (applies to rest of nullsec entities). Reducing asset safety all around would be so much better imho.
---
2 - Remove armor timer from non-keepstars, again, game becomes keepstar or gtfo.
---
3 - low powered citadels no longer have shield timer .... not very versed in citadel combat but if this means 'you can't use weapons when on low power and you can take it down in 2 cycles one after the other in quick succession' ... PLS
---
4 - reinforcement as it was on old pos's, was a fantastic game mechanic that should have been carried over into citadels.
---
The citadels were made against the spirit of EVE, with stuff not at risk. In a way, that is almost like putting all your stuff in a privately 'only you can access' instance, an incredibly bad idea.
---
Citadels becoming more like the citadels from WH is a good thing.
---
If it's an event, shouldn't it be more... interesting?  I mean, once you get past the initial "lol wut" of NPCs attacking structures, isn't it just kind of boring anti-content?
---
I just want to point out that this person hasn’t revealed how they came to these conclusions. It’s a little premature to use this as a valid source.
---
bored yet?
---
Gee, that's funny, because that's exactly what you are doing in this thread. 
---
The rules have changed. Adapt your gameplay or HTFU
---
that's a perfectly valid criticism.
---
Mittani isn't going to give you sugar daddy money if you keep going on like this on reddit.
---
Even if the embargo is 100% absolute.
---
Crazy wars all over low SEC for the best moons, closest to null moons quality.
---
Shit could be fun.
---
Literally the only thing I've said here is that referring to it as "emergent gameplay" is definitely inaccurate.  What is it that I need to "HTFU" about?
---
It's been like this for a few days. You have no idea what's even gonna happen. And even if your worst fears come true, I don't feel that bad. Rise to the challenge. Every big null bloc says the same shit to everyone else when the tide rolls in their favor. 
---
You're gonna figure this out. All shit talking aside, it might even make the game more engaging.
---
I gotta call bullshit on this cus I was there during the time mang ran Ganked and being over 100 was every week for awhile even after mang, and was never used to bash sov this is sad.
---
All he gave me was a blacklist for selling a molok outside of the alliance :(
---
You can't sell to a buy order outside a citadel while you're in a citadel.
---
Have you tried using a Titan, super, or carrier against a subcap ( not rats ) in the last couple of months? You know, actual pvp? Have you seen a capital umbrella drop for a cruiser? Bardge? Your throwing things out there but is this " he said" or "used to be" or is this post nef experience?
---
Obligatory? Wait, who's forcing you to have a ton of citadels, or to live in null? What's next, asking CCP to make scanning fun and engaging, because wormholers have to do a ton of it?
---
tl,dr
---
Mittani: "We're forming a Blue Donut against the scary HighSec."
---
"We're"
---
You. You're saying it. A lot of people are really happy with it. 
---
Probably because you hate it tbh.
---
super application on subs is shit for everyone too. yet, they are still in the game opressing as ever, getting used daily to shit on subs.
---
why should suddenly something get changed just because it doesnt favour you?
---
This guy seems legit
---
Savage...but oh so true
---
&lt;3 u 2.
---
I was down voted because so many people are like you, simple minded, narrow minded, lazy and wrong. If I was wrong it wouldn't take hundreds to prove it, only one with a logical response.
---
Albert Einstein faced the same dilemma when he published his theory of general relativity. A group published "A Hundred Authors Against Einstein" - To which Einstein replied "if (he) were wrong, then one author would have been enough"
---
Have fun with the Drifters. No better yet, go outside and get some fresh air and sunshine, maybe make a real friend or something. It would do you good and you wouldn't feel so negatively about everything all the time.
---
&gt; asking CCP to make scanning fun and engaging, because wormholers have to do a ton of it?
---
i literally see nothing wrong with this.
---
if you're going to have to do something a lot - why the fuck wouldn't you want it to be fun, and engaging?
---
Olmeca-block you? I for one love that your paying for a game you don't enjoy.
---
There is a catch up method, but it involves spending money to buy PLEX, which can then be sold for game money(ISK), and then you can purchase skill injectors with ISK to gain SP to train skills. 
---
Pro Tip- Low SP players get 100% return on the SP from injectors. As your SP increases, you get a diminished return. It's best to inject all of it while you're still lower SP than to do it a little at a time.
---
Literally back to eve 1 in 4 months.
---
&gt;implying i'm the only person in the history of eve to ever say this content is garbage.
---
I enjoy parts of it, unfortunately I despise the part I'd like to enjoy the most.
---
In high- and lowsec you got the factions and Concord to prevent that kind of thing (and I am actually in favor of it happening sometimes, with a proper response from some NPCs, because it would be awesome to watch).  
---
For the nullsec dudes: You should really be glad that the NPCs stayed in the anomalies and belts until now.  
---
The "payout" from killing the drifters is not having your structures reinforced, that you set up to earn money or protect the space you make your money in.
---
Love you too jamal!
---
The irony it BURNNNS!
---
&gt;why should suddenly something get changed just because it doesnt favour you?
---
it shouldn't.
---
it should get changed because it's garbage.
---
Uhh what? I'm saying that this needs to slam the big guys and not the little guys to break up power and your sitting here accusing me of crying for the big blocks getting slammed?
---
&gt;1 - Removing asset safety from non-keepstars simply rewards those with keepstars, so you are just making fortress delve even more fortress-y (applies to rest of nullsec entities). Reducing asset safety all around would be so much better imho.
---
sure, either is fine
---
&gt;2 - Remove armor timer from non-keepstars, again, game becomes keepstar or gtfo.
---
keepstars are worth killing, other structures aren't- therefore it's fine on keepstars.
---
&gt;not very versed in citadel combat but
---
p obvious
---
&gt;Citadels becoming more like the citadels from WH is a good thing.
---
ok so we agree?
---
so you don't then?
---
&gt; Maybe if alliance are having logistical issues maintaining territory they are too overextended with too many assets to tolerate the emergent gameplay resulting from a new mechanic. 
---
The first comment you replied to is literally referring to emergent gameplay RESULTING from the new mechanic. So you were in fact arguing against it when they were referring to the gameplay that would result from the changes as being emergent, not the changes themselves. 
---
Explain to me where I'm missing something or would you rather go ahead and pull your foot out of your mouth and apologize?
---
Wait WHAT?! Mittens plays WarFrame?!
---
OMG I'm gonna pay h soooo many visits once stalker mode gets released! xD
---
That's cool fam &lt;3 How's that advanced filtering UI coming along?
---
Wdym
---
oO thank you, I would never have found that one. Moved my sh*t to a npc station and it work.
---
Any reason why is that ?
---
On what? Killmails? Personal killboards? Corp/alliance killboards? all of the above? Sir could you be a little more vague for us?
---
Said 30 gunners.  Not 30 PvP people.  
---
Couldn’t be more ignorant if you tried
---
explanation please?
---
If you went to the Zkillboard page for players/corporations you could see a little icon next to their name that said "ZKILLBOARD VERIFIED" which means that any loss or kill associated with that player being uploaded.
---
Rorquals and super umbrellas are shit so let's remove those at the same time
---
It's probably put there to protect from your assets being locked in a citadel that you can't access and then you either have to sell them to citadel owners for fraction of price or use asset safety.
---
Wait, so the head of Goonswarm is not welcome in the original Goon homeland? Fucking LOL.
---
Plot twist XD
---
Are shrogingers hot like regular gingers?
---
We started asking our corps to pull their director level keys, now squizz is removing the page that told us what corps are verified.
---
I'm the one that seems to be having to explain it to you, so I'm not sure where you're trying to go with your statement. 
---
The game changes. Ships get rebalanced. Mechanics get reworked. New game systems get implemented. The world keeps spinning. 
---
All of this things will happen and new gameplay will emerge as a result. It's called "emergent gameplay". Maybe you should HTFU and stop whining.
---
What "emergent gameplay" has resulted from the mechanic that any party has not been able to "tolerate"?
---
Are we calling the most rote, direct and obvious solutions of POS-gunner whackamole "emergent"?
---
i'll give you a hint: ai doing exactly as they're coded to and interacting with structures isn't emergent gameplay
---
Htfu and get your own drifters
---
So personal/corp/alliance killboards are affected. And that seems like a dumb reason.
---
thats my opinion too! stuff that is shit should get changed/nerfed!
---
but wait... why arent you standing up then ''against'' super application on subs? could it maybe be because its in YOUR favour?
---
so once again. why should stuff get changed that isnt in your favour but stuff that is shouldnt?
---
chadswarm pride
---
ok, you win
---
God lord i hope ccp fucks back and just remove all your shit in delve when you start fucking with highsec. Maybe they should just brake up gsf 😂
---
Well aze is in goons now and I’m pretty sure all the organizers of the casinos are imperium blood sworn enemies.  Something doesn’t square there.
---
Why should that little space support a shitload of players without consequence?
---
Yes but... is that pro or anti goons?
---
The changes have been out for less than a week. I would give it a little more time before I closed the book on what adaptations of gameplay have/will emerge because of it. 
---
Now you're making a completely different kind of argument about it though.
---
Weird I trusted everyone in my alliance with gunning rights and never had anyone abuse it. Perhaps there are in fact downsides to open recruitment.
---
&gt;but wait... why arent you standing up then ''against'' super application on subs? could it maybe be because its in YOUR favour?
---
because it's a mechanic i literally never interact with. out of sight, out of mind.
---
&gt;so once again. why should stuff get changed that isnt in your favour but stuff that is shouldnt?
---
once again...
---
&gt;it shouldn't.
---
&gt;it should get changed because it's shit.
---
We were using the API verification section on zkb to fine our guys for having an API registered.
---
Well, I don't actually know if that was the reason behind this zkb change. But, y'know.
---
You hold an unreasonable amount of territory for "30" people to protect. The game should be dangerous, and you shouldn't be able to hold a significant portion of the game with a few people manning structures.
---
rorquals are fine it's the excavator drones that are the issue.
---
given the above, yes. lets remove them both.
---
Well, what you quoted was an argument that they can't tolerate the resulting emergent gameplay, so I feel like, "Okay, what's the alleged emergent gameplay they can't tolerate?" is a fair ask.
---
Right, so is how we react to this going to be emergent?
---
What does this have to do with anything? It doesn't show who owns the POSes on the R64s.
---
Because alliances are asking all corps to pull their director level keys and they knew exactly which corp to go to.
---
Because fuck you, that's why.
---
Sincerely, Squizz (probably)
---
A players change in behavior due to a change in gameplay is though. 
---
I think the argument you're trying to make is good vs bad emergent gameplay.
---
So the rest of your pvpers don't know how to gun a citadel or smth?
---
So you're slowly becoming the PL of yesteryear. Do you have an internal killboard as well?
---
adapt or die
---
The crying once are again just gsf as usual since 2009
---
The same krabs who are so tuned into what is going on they dont even notice the super umbrella is gone. Yeah they are a dependable lot.
---
It’s based on access lists to the citadels which they don’t just hand out to line members.  Ccp needs to fix citadels (running theme here) and give more access lists to memebers.
---
ok so it's not mandatory, it's just shit players. got ya
---
You for making us read this.
---
its funny, PL doesn't care about APIs in zkillboard anymore, Goons do... how the turntables have
---
&gt; because it's a mechanic i literally never interact with. out of sight, out of mind.
---
just dont interact with drifters then... out of sight, out of mind.
---
lawl
---
Wow you alliamce has 40k members and you want to tell us they get burned out cause they have to shoot some targets they dont like to shoot? 
---
This is the Classic spin to win shit tight now. There are millions of comments about you shouldnt be able to hold sov if you cant afford to defend. 
---
So i guess you should abandone some systems you cant defend. Maybe just stay all in dh1 and brag in local how unfair everything is now
---
Avoid : mining 
---
Adopt: losses
---
no we just manually post kills and losses, it just stops free intel getting out, so people like miniluv have an easier time not being called out when ganking
---
When there is one gubber needed per structure i think you do not need an fc to force em of.
---
&gt; Is still worth for a totally newbie to enter EvE universe?
---
Absolutely. The game was more than a decade old when I joined. 
---
&gt; Is it a game where i can play it semi afk..like alt tabing?
---
That depends on what you're doing. For many tasks, like certain types of krabbing (PVE), yes. But most PVP requires actively paying attention, with some notable exceptions (tidi).
---
&gt; Is there any catch up method? I saw that some skills take years to develop.
---
Yes, you can buy skill injectors and other tools to speed that up, but speaking from experience I don't recommend it. Maybe to train the basic skills useful for all/many types of ships, but not to rush train some flashy ship type. That's a good way to lose a ship you don't really know how to fly and can't afford to replace. 
---
Common misconception about Eve is that bigger ships are better and you need lots of skillpoints to be useful. Both are bullshit. Now that I've spent years training and can fly titans and supercarriers, I'm finding that I spend most of my time (and have the most fun) flying an assault frigate or stealth bomber, and those only take a few weeks to train once you have the basic skills covered.
---
So CCP is constraining the sandbox and telling players how they can and cannot use their mechanics instead of other players being the determining factor.
---
What if players take advantage of the new drifter mechanics to (for example) attempt to aggr drifters and pull them into an enemy structure (which they then attack)? Or if players take advantage of these timers to go &lt;accomplish some special goal they had, but weren't able to accomplish in the past&gt;?
---
Or if players use this massive set of timers to form fleets to destroy structures they previously wouldn't have been able to destroy?
---
The 'emergent' parts are the things that happen after-the-fact... Obviously, drifters reinforcing structures (that they were intended to shoot) isn't emergent gameplay, but players interacting with those drifters, with those *structures* later, can be.
---
not sure if people understand that structure gunning required a full set of different skills than everything else. and those skills don't train instantly, also training people how to use guided bombs is not an overnight process.
---
b a l a n c e d
---
&gt;Emergent gameplay refers to complex situations in video games
---
shooting ai isn't emergent gameplay
---
try again later
---
The quote was to correct you on what you said you were arguing against. You said that the you were arguing that the change in gameplay wasn't emergent, and I pointed out that it wasn't the change that they addressed as being emergent, it was how the players were responding to the change that was what was being referred to. 
---
Apparently people are pissed they can't just drop a structure and walk away from it. Even the Goons in their mighty empire have to now respond to threats they didn't have to before. Botters can't rely on local to keep them safe. They now have to worry about an enemy that can drop on them with no warning. 
---
All of theses changes are going to understandably piss people off. They've been comfortable. Eve hasn't had any major changes they've had to adjust to. They've been able to blue neighbors and not worry about threats to their infrastructure and AFK/BOT run sites without any real concern due to the tools that have been developed to parse info from the game and keep them relatively safe. This has all changed now and players that relied heavily on the way the gameplay was before to keep them safe cannot do so now. There's a new emergent threat to deal with and players don't like that they can't respond with the methods they used before.
---
Hmm.
---
I love when idiots think they know economics.
---
Yep, that's what I'm saying. If you can't understand the nuance of a literal infinite amount of work with no spigot to turn, then you're not equipped for this conversation. Fortunately, it's out of your hands.
---
Why can't you give members gunning rights on a random shitty astrahus. I did in my alliance.
---
This thread...dear god, the salt is flowing in rivers
---
Seriously it's just a game. Everyone take a deep breath, I'll get some tea
---
i have had this for over a year now
---
Ya, imma take my asshole self and play goonswarm online. I like everything to be easy and my toys arranged just so.
---
&gt;I can't say how you're wrong so I'm just gonna call you an idiot
---
I shiggydiggy
---
No. But given the fact that freighters and jump freighters will happily stop moving in highsec when they spot kills, things like these are required to keep ganking ;-)
---
That'd be the case if we were concerned about stats. We were concerned about intel. We didn't want our kills OR our losses being posted. Granted, killmails are a single-party consent system and you can't completely stop it, but it doesn't mean we had to be complicit with it either. Oh well.
---
not as bad, they are doing it only to NCPL, not all small alliances that they cross
---
[https://i.imgur.com/UaLpJOK.png](https://i.imgur.com/UaLpJOK.png) bruh
---
Okay, so it's *imaginary future emergence* then - but that isn't logically compatible with the argument that null blocs can't tolerate this new emergent gameplay that isn't actually happening.
---
dude why can't we pay tyrranos to let us sit in his cruiser for a bit
---
I hear some capsuleers have been stocking up on corpses for a while now
---
but it's not out of sight or out of mind when suddenly all my industry jobs stop, is it?
---
Goons have how many titan pilots? I'm sure a few structure gunners can be found.
---
Hail Tyrannos
---
&gt;We were concerned about intel. 
---
So basically the exact same reason as what PL told their members back in the day (and maybe even now as well, idk).
---
"If you want pvp, take a heap of guys and join smaller groups"
---
you mean like their sigs, Space Violence, Reavers...
---
"If you want your space to be safe, I guess you have to keep it that way now."
---
They are, they just think it sucks.
---
It’s not my alliance you’ll have to ask goons why.  
---
But they appear to only provide the access to certain people.  
---
The issue is with citadels not with the alliance or with the “state of null”
---
If ccp wanted to really fix citadel spam they’d put limits based on the ihub upgrades installed.  And create a deterioration condition on low power citadels.
---
just that laugh of sheer disbelief.
---
Poor you....
---
&gt;regardless of the reason
---
meet:
---
&gt;You can't think of a single reason other than that?
---
bruh
---
the words that you typed do not reflect an effective response to the words that i typed
---
i don't know how i can make this more clear
---
No, no Concord:D. 
---
Don't you see the Drifters don't care about the mechanics you are used to and bind to. They just bypass it.
---
Why can't your shitty alliance adapt then lmao
---
Its just true and good sir!
---
just dont interact wiht it, out of sight, out of mind
---
But 3 rights do make a left!
---
wont stop me from exporting and frankly other null entity arent going to stop exporting either so how does mittani plan going to work again?
---
His look when he died. priceless
---
There seems to be complex situations developing from it, such as "How do we defend our space from a threat we can't ignore, but don't want to fight, while at the same time trying to accomplish our other objectives"?  Sounds exactly like emergent gameplay in Eve. 
---
If you really think about it, it's the perfect response to all of the tactics that have been developed to discourage players from wanting to fight you. They don't get bored, tired, or annoyed when you don't undock. They'll shoot your shit anyway. You can't timezone tank them, so good look with setting all of your timers to AUTZ. They're also much more annoying to deal with if you have structures spammed all over huge regions of space, so there's that. 
---
To be honest, I can't think of a better way to deal with all the bullshit ways Eve players have came up with to discourage fighting just to protect their shit.
---
If you think it's a good thing that CCP are drawing hard lines and telling half the game they're playing the wrong way then you're no better than however you've built up goons in your mind.
---
take a look at the losses from pandemic horde fighting with them. its on the Killboard.
---
but it's not out of sight our out of mind when my industry jobs stop, is it?
---
The trick here is that I find your binary terms to be disingenuous. Open your imagination juuuuust a little bit, there, Chester.
---
HOES MAD
---
Good to see you completely disregarded the other reply stating that free intel is extremely bad for highsec gankers
---
Here's a simple exercise for you. What's 40,000 times infinity? Secondly, what's a smaller number, say, 100, times infinity? Now, of those two: which is the greater sum?
---
inb4 "reporting blue jf **suspected** bots is goonfucking"
---
We see how many dudes join a fleet for shit like this.😂
---
&gt;There seems to be complex situations developing from it
---
no they're not, they're solved, it's as simple as having 20-30 autists pos gunning shit, which isn't different than any other type of pve in the game.
---
It transcends our perceived planes of irony and goes into the 5th parallel dimension, where everything exists as a ferrous-based compound
---
The world is round and you're in the biggest group in the game. Time of day is literally the worst argument you could possibly bring up.
---
But are you mad btw?
---
Oh n1 i would like to team up with snuff for some cool pre wwb lowsec fights they where funny
---
The 'emergent gameplay' here is that they are *choosing to defend the timers* or *choosing to prevent the timers from occurring.*
---
You could easily choose a different course of action -- like *just let your structures burn* or *withdraw from some sectors of space.* People are defending their structures because they are afraid of *imaginary future emergence,* as you call it.
---
If you could scan these drifters down, still another option would be to *form parties to hunt drifters in your system;* since you can't, you could *form watchgroups to find &amp; destroy patrolling drifters,* a preemptive approach where you stop drifters from starting *any* timers.
---
At the moment, things are in a kind of state of confusion; I'm sure people will become more clear on what they ought to do in the days to come.
---
i'm glad every entity in the game has that luxury.
---
I was that caracal,
---
they popped me about 5 mins later
---
wow such emergent gameplay!
---
So log on a gunner alt for the 2nd timer
---
&gt;The quote was to correct you on what you said you were arguing against. You said that the you were arguing that the change in gameplay wasn't emergent, and I pointed out that it wasn't the change that they addressed as being emergent, it was how the players were responding to the change that was what was being referred to.
---
How could they possibly be referring to "emergent content" that doesn't exist (which you've admitted) in the present tense?  They were clearly referring to silly RNG infinispawn NPCs as "emergent".
---
Well, to be fair, hacking a can isn't emergent gameplay.
---
Getting rekt because you didn't dscan while engrossed in the hacking game, and you're too close to a little piece of debris you didn't see just off the side of your ship so you can't cloak up, well... that is.
---
I didn't even know i missed you
---
It was born out of NPSI, he made a statment that NPSI fails at making alliances.
---
I feel sorry for you ... really, you should get professional help.
---
Well, you tell me -- are we concerned about killboard stats? Would you ascribe that motivation towards Goonswarm Federation, or perhaps the Imperium as a whole?
---
Nice, that was some good set up
---
Greetings from Orange County, Florida. Took me a minute to realize  haha
---
Name an entity that doesn't that has hundreds of structures (and also should have so many)
---
It's been a while, and you haven't disappointed.
---
Lol, just did a 5 mile hike, that's a funny response though. Maintain your perspective and you'll remain just a programmer forever- which is about the level of competency of an 8 year old in a programming summer camp
---
Big ol wall of stankin ass shit that smells worse than Rasputia after tanning in a landfill for 12 hours only to try and save his salty vagina with this line
---
&gt; But really we're just doing this because its funny. 
---
Fucking lol that's pathetic.
---
Since most eve players have the ‘tism the loud noises and poop smell would be too much for us.
---
I think you're confusing two different statements I've made. 
---
1. They were referring to the game changes and the current state of player response now. The original statement your were arguing against.
---
2. The other statement I made was to argue with your point that the only emergent gameplay from the change was just having players fight them with station gunners. I was saying that it's too early to declare that this is the only thing to come out of the change
---
Kingless. 98 members, The alliance don't hold any system. :thinking:
---
I was in talks with Bush regarding Invasion of Iraq.
---
By that I mean I've sent an email like a year ago. But that counts right?
---
Careful, you'll confuse people with these "facts" that don't fit the narrative of "the sprawling multi-region Goon empire that is mostly empty".  
---
Or is it "Goons are too densely packed into one region and should be forced to spread out".  
---
Idk I am now confused too...
---
It comes from moons
---
Last time I checked a huge majority (if not all) planets in EVE have moons, including wormholes.
---
Sprectre fleet?
---
Memettani content &gt;&gt;&gt; Mittani content
---
I missed these posts
---
&gt; The other statement I made was to argue with your point that the only emergent gameplay from the change was just having players fight them with station gunners. I was saying that it's too early to declare that this is the only thing to come out of the change
---
I literally acknowledged that there could be future emergent gameplay in my first response to you, then suggested you go back and re-read the sentence where I had said that.  
---
So at this point, you kind of just sound like an asshole intent on arguing about... something, anything.
---
I am 50% convinced it might work, and 50% convinced this is a scheme by Aryth to do some sort of massive economic manipulation...

---
I so like being not in game. Wooo
---
Oh.
---
i missed this sort of content nice work
---
&gt; just dont interact wiht it, out of sight, out of mind
---
Oh, I would, but you know, limited resources and all that.
---
&gt; no they're not, they're solved, it's as simple as having 20-30 autists pos gunning shit, which isn't different than any other type of pve in the game. 
---
It's been less than a week. It's a little early to declare that we've seen all there is to see out of these changes. 
---
&gt; remove asset safety from non keepstars, remove armor timers from non keepstars, remove shield timer for low power citadels, add stront back to citadels 
---
I think these ideas have all been put forward before and most, if not all of them have had their fair share of consideration. 
---
Removing asset safety is a non-starter. CCP won't do it because of the risk to AFG players losing all of their shit. They've determined it's bad for the health of their game to allow people who aren't actively playing to lose their shit. Then they have less incentive to return, which is bad for the game overall. 
---
I suggested that it wouldn't be a bad thing to have structures drop what's in their corp hangars as loot. 
---
Timers suck. They need to be fixed. No argument there
---
Lower power citadels lose a timer already. You just reinforce and then come back and pop. 
---
Stront would just be replacing vulnerability windows, which replaced stront. Not sure why they would go back to an old system when they could just modify the existing one
---
I know you think you're super funny and edgy and that you really are putting one over on everyone else, but no man, you are awful.
---
none - which is why there are no 'small entities' in null - you can't be a small entity and exist in null one of the issues you face will be timezone coverage.
---
i'll let you have your own opinion if that's a good or a bad thing.
---
The c5/c5 corp I am apart of uses the home hole as a way to fund corp things. Like SRP, forts, and many other things
---
&gt; "I can stop alcoholism any time I want, I just choose not to"
---
I know r/Eve is not a safe space or anything, but jabs on people's IRL stuff are distasteful.
---
Everyone ironically quits they game thinking they are being so ironic but in actuality bettered their lives permanently.
---
Put all nullsec instead of coalitions.
---

holy fuck I hope you’re somehow username baiting
---
Being right doesn't necessarily mean you have a good point.
---
Sorry about all those structures in Tribute.  \*sad face\*
---
Yep.
---
So you're saying this \*gasp* isn't a problem exclusive to the Drifter attacks?
---
Has that guy ever fucked anything?
---
New Jersey meet @ AC?
---

---
BALANCED XD lol CCP
---
Weren't you the one that tried to paint all of goons as collectively racist because some people trolled you in local not even a year ago?
---
Oh sweet. Info?
---
\~fuck\~ that guy and \~fuck\~ his gate too
---
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ It’s w/e. Idk. Maybe they use home sites to bait people or for the corp ish.
---
Maybe they want home sites to be done with a dread. Idk. You could always ask them.
---
either provide another reason that negates my point, or my point stands
---
&gt; The 'emergent gameplay' here is that they are choosing to defend the timers or choosing to prevent the timers from occurring.
---
I'm not sure you can call a binary decision tree "emergent gameplay".  The phrase typically describe some sort of creative utilization of mechanics.  
---
I mean literally everything is "emergent gameplay" if we're going to use that term to apply to even the mere decision to participate at all.  I can run a mission, I can not run a mission!  I can pay my office rent, I can not pay my office rent!
---
I don't think anyone is afraid of the imagined future emergence - I think they're aggrieved by what is clearly boring anti-content:
---
-The content is forced.
---
-The content is not enjoyable to the players engaging in the content.
---
-The content is unrewarding (the best case scenario is status quo).  
---
&gt;If you could scan these drifters down, still another option would be to form parties to hunt drifters in your system; since you can't, you could form watchgroups to find &amp; destroy patrolling drifters, a preemptive approach where you stop drifters from starting any timers.
---
Those are nice thoughts, but it raises the question of, "So why release this now when it's basically an RNG-afflicted minigame instead of waiting until it's something the players can meaningfully engage with?"
---
But weapons-free on ~the mittani~ being a cringed cheetomonger.
---
Warframe is so carpal tunnel though.
---
https://youtu.be/hsq8F05B9b4
---
Sometimes the fastest way to get rid of the weeds is to burn it all down and encourage something better to grow in its place.
---
it is, because outside of drifter attacks it's actual content not just a tedious waste of everyone's time.
---
Ever seen a dedicated turbokrab try to kill anything?
---
Could you add an option for a delay to kills being posted? Some people still wouldn't want their kills/losses posted, but if kills were delayed 12 or 24 or x amount of hours, it would stop the instant free intel issue.
---
He's not right.
---
Mistake #1
---
No thanks.
---
Judging by the leaks, I think he just went balls-deep into his own reputation sans lube.
---
limited resources doesn't stop you asking.
---
it'll stop you getting it, but it won't stop you asking for it.
---
Initial DPS seems low but they are a beast. Run more then one with command bursts, remote armor rep, and remote cap they are just beautiful. Range could be a little better. I've found running two or three to work great for this trig invasion.
---
Sometimes we get not the poster we want, but the poster we need.

---
Oh My.

Mittens is also the person who stood up at EvE Fest and told people to harass a suicidal individual. 
---
This just seems like another action of his personality.

Rampant disingenuity doesn't entitle you to squat. Come into a conversation with sanguine intentions and maybe I'll be more cooperative.

---
Anything else is forgiven after this.
---
You literally just type the rats name and it can avoid it... it’ll be the same mechanic as avoiding other rats it’s really not much more to code at all.

I’d buy it, but you gotta wonder how many goons are just there for free isk and not really committed.

Imagine if all highsec PvE disappeared one day and nullseccers we're given ships/mods equivalent to what the Drifters have that only work in highsec so now the only content for highseccers was PvP against Drifter-esque players who can hit out to 15000km and spawn without end.
---
*Applauds CCP*
---
Hit harder.

please post proof.

Adapt or die.

If they were efficient we would have 2 or 3 in the mids and a dc2 with bulkeads in the lows, making hull tanking the new op meta.

Yes, if a hard-right nationalist did get elected that would be true.  But one hasn't been yet, so I'm not really sure what your point is.

He is a good FC.
---
I was often his LC.
---
Happy cake day, Paco!!
---
What if you *intentionally* let some timers slip by you, to try to bait out a fight in your native timezone against some other capsuleers who *know* that your structure will be vulnerable? And you hope that your enemies thought you were just run too haggard?
---
There's all *sorts* of ways you could try to use this new stuff going on. Right now, perhaps, people haven't figured them out yet, or they haven't chosen to utilize them. But I'm sure they will. :)
---
CCP already said that they intended to shake up EVE. If you think people are having a rough time dealing with this new content -- well, then it's probably working.
---
Krabs just steamrolled Krabs. No difference between the two lol
---
Adapt to what. Eve becoming world of warcraft?
---
Afk on vacation here:
---
From what I'm reading the null coalitions adapted pretty fast. It's almost as if they spout this "adapt" line because they've gotten really good at it.

Hull Rep Fix:  
---
Can't be used with a weapon's timer
---
30s to 1min cycle time
---
Small Rep = 500 rep
---
Medium = 1500 rep
---
Large = 4500 rep
---
Prevents any kind of abuse during combat (looking at you gallente BC/BS), allows repair much quicker in non-combat situations, but still has some cycle time in the off chance someone with a brain tries to scan you down with probes to catch you.
---
I agree though, its dumb how they're currently setup. There is nothing worse than having a hull tanked barghest with 30k hull HP trying to rep up in some random nullsec system and it taking 45min to go from 18% to 65% structure with multiple hull reps.
---
&lt;http://www.verite.space/maps/coalition/coalitioninfluence.png&gt; 
---
Gosh, look at all of that space that isn't under a coalition or a multi-alliance group that claims to not be a coalition ...
---
Wow, I have never heard that line this week...
---
I hear there's ore in highsec.
---
Dscan. Watch a guide. Learn to use it and then master it.
---
Also learn to sling shot.
---
oh shit i can't believe we didn't do that
---
I think they could do with a little tweak to repair time. Nothing crazy, but they are miserably slow
---
Please tell me how efficient that would be with 60 percent max resistance and no free mid slots for tackle/prop/cap whatever?
---
Even if rep amount was changed, they'd still be pretty worthless with a 20+ second cycle time. I'd rather they be locked behind a combat timer though, just to avoid any abuse.
---
Amarr or Min?
---
Please do not push him to self harm. You've had enough fun.
---
Wait, what about the remaining keepstars?
---
then CCP nerfed panfam and buffed goons because reddit was spammed with salty goons
---
You realize that the purpose of hull tanking is to basically provide a huge buffer? I'm pretty sure there was a dev response to this suggestion on the forums a few years ago explaining how the different tank types have their purposes/niches, but cbf to look it up on mobile
---
Sometimes you want your home hole to look unused to bait in a daytripper. Sometimes he sites in the home hole are for corp income since there is really no way to get ratting tax in wh space.
---
\&gt;I know r/Eve is not a safe space or anything, but I'd like it to be.

No Discord, only Slack. Join MCAV-public ingame.

Because it's in a separate thread and replying to both in a single reply isn't how reddit works.

Thank you senpai!!

That was fucking great :-D

Maybe somebody can tell him to put those on his overview
---
where are your numbers for nullsec. How many players? Please factor in at least 1 alt (market) per nullsec player in JITA. what you post there is irrelevant.
---
but hisec moons are shit
---
Yeah man. I mean we already have drifters that will fuck you up. But they drop 300mil when you kill them so 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
If we’re talking scale of supercaps in existence, yes they did. If we’re talking raw numbers, then you are closer to accuracy.

Static wormholes respawn when the collapse to the same type of wormhole, but to a new jtag.
---
Wormhole corps live in their home hole, and roll their statics (use ships to put mass on the hole and collapse it) until they find one with a lot of sites. Then they go in there and run the sites. Usually they will put cloaky scouts on all the holes in the hole they are farming to make sure no one is gonna drop on them.
---
Sometimes they might be moving stuff out through a hi sec in their static and don't want any extra attention or people watching them, potentially ganking dst's.
---
If you're farming their static, you may as well be farming their home. Statics are kinda viewed as an extension of your home while connected unless that static is occupied and active.
---
If CCP simply deleted Null Sec, there would still be a game, probably a better game.
---
2 of those 3 people dont really hold space anymore in any meaningful way since you just burnt it all down.
---
Not the first time Bjorn has suffered at the hands of NPCs...  [https://clips.twitch.tv/IntelligentSparklingCormorantBigBrother](https://clips.twitch.tv/IntelligentSparklingCormorantBigBrother)  Generally when he isn't paying attention or doesn't have them on his overview :D
---
They don’t respawn like that
---
Oh uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhjh man had i known earlier.
---
According to TEST all it takes is a citadel gunner.
---
How do you magically tell there is an Anchored Bubbled in the next site you're aligned to out of Dscan range? Cyno Inhib put up the second you're on grid, sabre locking you in. I don't think you know how hunting Supers long-term works. All supers dying in Delve are caught this way. I guess it's easy for Pubbie Shits on Reddit to lemming after 'HURR DURR SUPER UMBRELLA' without actually knowing how it's done except for the dank Bombers Bar videos where it's just simpe shotgunning of sites.
---
ok enjoi \~\~EveOnline\~\~  MylittlePony.

No I'm suggesting it. Apologies, it just seems like it could be our version of EVE Vegas
---
Stop doing this spam! Failcascade somewhere else!!

Maybe people shouldn't sit on a gate not paying attention. You know you could be ganked anytime and anywhere. You consent to EvE when you undock.

I say let them do what they want to do and put this Trump thing on highsec.

I mean LMFAO man, un-fucking-beleivable.

This whole conversation is going over your head
---
&gt; What if you intentionally let some timers slip by you, to try to bait out a fight in your native timezone against some other capsuleers who know that your structure will be vulnerable? And you hope that your enemies thought you were just run too haggard?
---
That's a lot less feasible than you're imagining, I think.
---
If the structure isn't worth defending then, generally speaking, it's probably also not worth the morale hit of making people form for a boring structure grind.  If it is worth defending, the defense CTA that the attacker's spies are well aware of is going to be kind of a giveaway.  So NPC reffed structures will give wouldbe attackers a decision tree of, "Who Cares" Vs "Obvious Bait".
---
Especially since, given the size of blue blocs, it would probably have to already be wartime to have an attacking fleet close enough at hand to engage.  
---
&gt;If you think people are having a rough time dealing with this new content -- well, then it's probably working.
---
That might make sense if the content were *challenging*, but it's not.  It's boring/tedious/anti-fun.
---
You can always gun the strucuter on their armor timer... no need for taking watches in shifts for ever.
---
We will never surrender until Karmafleet stops recruiting.

Ceo of my corp is an aussie. He's so well-spoken and not-aussie sounding i thought he was a brit at first. Which caused him to immediately go full Aussie and rip me a new one for thinking he was a "fucking pom". Good times.

The sad thing is that eves player base is typically 30-50 so this is actually an adult

Not the same quantities but supply is supply, and you're talking about nullsec buying everything like you control the entire game.
---
Let's wait and see if your glorious leader can even stop the goons from selling things, let alone everyone else in null.
---
did you just imply nullsec is a very risky place
---
I found an astra with about 20 drifter wrecks full of loot. Was about 120 mil estimated of loot there. Not huge, but not a bad haul for me considering I just came upon them and took all of 5 minutes to loot everything.
---
I agree here, and I am actually supporting their embargo.
---
Whoever plays in highsec will think through on how to secure those minerals and actually people will start working on it.

1qd1 prices are usually within 5-10% of jita prices, so we don't need to sell to highsec to make our money. Horde and Frat are big enough at this point to make their own market hub, so their won't be an of selling things they just won't be fedex'd to jita.

Doesn't mean i can't call out one particulrly bad example and try to make them reflect on wtf they're saying. :)
---
do we get pap and srp for attending? :)
---
Okay, let me explane it to you, and I will use small words so even you can understand it.
---
Null no sell ore/minerals/moon goo to Highsec.  Null miners sell to people who make stuff in Null.  Highsec makers who make stuff sad, because they can't get enough stuff to make finished stuff to sell, or sad because have to pay more for the stuff to make finished stuff.  Highsec makers raise price of finished goods to help pay for stuff to make stuff.  People who make stuff in Null happy, because they have plenty of stuff to make finished stuff, and sell at low cost.  If no sell in null, ship to Jita and sell for more profit at lower cost than Highsec makers can. Now Highsec makers more sad, can't lower price or won't be able to buy stuff to make finished stuff, or can't keep hut to make stuff in, because not enough money to buy fuel.  Null makers happy because more money goes in their pocket, Highsec makers sad because less money goes in their pocket.

This is almost as cringe as The Mittani himself. I love it.

Sites take a while to respawn but say for example you have a C3 Static. You go in, clear out the sites, then roll the hole and get a fresh one, clear the sites, repeat.

I didn't even know how much I missed this meme account.
---
I would guess they are alt corps people with towers down who aren't active or don't have someone to gun them so they want them out to limit ping spam from drifters to cits that matter
---
Only way in to Drones is by taking gates, which act as natural choke points without even needing to deploy cynojammers.
---
You give up the ability to make strategic choices on where the set piece battle will happen and smart enemies will take maximum advantage (for example parking their own Titan blob at 300km on the gate so that half the hostile titans jumping the gate end up out of range, and their concentrated grouping makes bumping more likely.
---
You can additionally stash your fax even further out of range and effectively can bomb the shit out of every subcap coming through. It’s a bit of a killing field basically, and successfully assaulting them has been a challenge.
---
If you didnt expect this from me you haven't been reading my posts for the past 14 years, and if you dont want this kind of post, I'd probably avoid making retard posts.

Given an oft-stjated customer request to have an option to delay the posting of kills X amount of time to avoid the posting of free intel, Squizz was faced with a choice:
---
* Actually do some work and implement the feature to increase customer satisfaction and likelihood his product would be used
---
* Throw a tantrum and decrease end user transparency

Personally it's gratifying to see my initial gut-impression of "wow this guy's a piece of shit" is so regularly reinforced with asinine decisions like this.

direct intervention would be not allowing you to have too much, this is suggestive, you CAN, but you'll have to work extra hard at it.

maybe he's just not a coward?

i like a memettani post as much as anyone, but dirk's personal life does not belong in one

Think its for steam accounts only
---
the best part about waffe purges is the sa thread gold
---
Wow ..... didn't know that.
---
I did know that drone regions seem to be in clone proximity to one another, but not the chokepoint thing.
---
Whine more?
---
Guys we can inject titans and supers and rorqs but not gunner alts, honest injun...
---
Tbh, it was impossible to do so and the older players/leaders of goons deffinitely knew this.
---
PL/NC are made of older players, individualistic, who have reached their cap or are close to their cap in the game.
---
The only ones in the north who haven't done so already are Horde, as there are a lot of new players there.
---
I guess the US will have to learn what the merge of populism and hard right can actually do, then you will 'get it' (and Pence is more hard right than Trump btw).
---
What pack? 25e one? You think thats better than the referal one?
---
Well, sure, we didn't expect them to build as many as we did, but we did expect them to use all that rental cheddar to at least try to build more supercaps since, y'know, it was kind of their thing to have a dominant supercap fleet. Instead, it turned into one of those "grasshopper and the ants" deals. Well, bees anyway.
---
Maybe your space mansions anyway.
---
I had a very nice suit custom made for my wedding. Shoes, belt, tie, everything custom. It was outrageously expensive but God damn, I look and felt like James bond.
---
I don't regret the purchase at all
---
one is a player and is a player v player interaction
---
one is dying to the game
---
When was the last time you got istakilled by a smartbomb in a VNI while the ship using said smartbomb is &gt;100km away from you?
---
Been mad is a unclear feeling these days
---
Thots and players
---
Fuck who?
---
He could still post last i checked, but goons (the legit goons) don't like him, because he opened the gateways of goonswarm to every 'normie' and corrupted their culture.
---
Not to mention that a flood of 'goons' from EVE came to SA (like DBRB), joined to only post 1-2 times and then went away, thereby 'earning' their goon wings.
---
The goons were the counter-culture, the guys who did their own thing, not empire builders, but ppl who did what they did for lols.
---
When you open the gateways like they did, you essentially sell out that culture .... think the EVE equivalent of hipsters.
---
That's why the goons that post here, or are active in goonswarm are not 'real' goons.
---
You mean refreshing.  For years Ive watched as CCP releases content that was beaten on the TEST server 2 months before it hit the live server.  This was missed, the entire thing was a shock, and thats good for the health of the game.
---
No we don't, and this debate is over, not worth my time to debate things with someone who buthcers a forest to concentrate on the trees to prove his point.
---
Are you sure you're not a plumber?
---
I like this Drifter madness, but for the sake of argument. Smartbombing battleships show up in local - and they can be d-scanned.
---
we don't treat npcs like you treat wars.
---
I think SF is still okay but is nowhere near what they were and IMO it's mainly becuase they lack idenity now.  
---
They seem to be tryhard to do everything - NPSI central (?) with Null Sec level IT (SeAT)+ caps + this new alliance thing. Its all too much.  
---
They should go back to what they were good at  -real simple, easy access PVP and a simple platform to look at upcoming fleets and ships etc.
---
Given that the going definition of "tears" is "comments made, regardless of their content," you and yours are far in the lead. But, hey, who's counting?
---
Oh? Link me, I want to see.
---
just null sov,everything bad is there:bots,afk farmers f1 pushers
---
Again, different philosophies.
---
Some ppl (especially the older players) are entrenched in their views and they won't change.
---
Perfect example, me.
---
I have been playing since 2006 on/off, and i could afford 2-3 titans right now, yet i've never touched a supercap and that won't change, they are a pain in the a\*\*.
---
I was a plumber before.  Carpenters USED to not just work with wood, it was a catchall name for a tradesman.  I do tile work, drywall, roofing, siding, wood work of all types and plumbing.  My snapchat group used to be regularly entertained by highend bathroom work where I'd go in to a place that looked like Somalia and turn a bathroom into scrooge mcducks bathroom.
---
It’s a reference to the HIC changes.
---
why would you say this to me
---
Hahaha, wasn't it something along the lines of:
---
In order to not get kicked, log into the forums, log into jabber, log into mumble, or get a pap within the last 90days?
---
Steep reqs indeed
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq4vWUI6g7OdU0EBeGaDXGk3B0rG2qywnhQEwwW3ykM/edit?usp=drivesdk  
---
Even some pvp subcaps on there that i guess were too expensive?
---
huh
---
Ohh.... Well, Personally I applaud the drifter menace, but if they have the power to INSTA delete a player and his pod the moment they cross a gate, that is just cheap!
---
They should work like the Triglavians in HS, they will not stop you from warping in HS(unless you jump to engage them in the conduits), but they will lock you soon after you appear in a gate their fleet is camping, and if you are... Let's say in a T1 industrial fitted for load and with a very shit align speed on top of paper tank, you are fucked!
---
Being able to pop a cruiser instantly isn't a challenging or difficult move, it's just a way to kill any random Joe that was there in the wrong moment!
---
More greentext please.
---
Pence isn't President.  Trump isn't "hard right".  You seem confused.
---
It is because CCP decided it was easier not to check whether you can dock or not when you do a transaction.
---
PL is made up of long time players because those are the players who are more likely to have supercaps; or at least they were before skill injectors. You do understand that the entire point of this thread is that PL spent a very long time with a dominant supercapital fleet to the point that it was the thing they were known for, right?
---
No, doesn't show as sale, but it's 25$ on eve store too
---
Mittens is going to be so pissed when he finds out
---
Come join! You don't need as much of that shit as you think, and yes, if you want to play the market, roam around, and do some mining casually you'll have fun.
---
Is it like a better eve?
---
You can get killed by a lot of things in a lot of areas. Maybe we should just make it so everyone can't shoot each other and NPCs throw snowballs at you and then we can all live the highsec carebear dream, ehh Globby?
---
and you post on a website that promoted child porn, who's the toxic piece of shit now? (see how i can bring up old shit people/sites have atoned for :) )
---
Hey bud I help run the NYC meetup I'll get you a discord invite when I get home later.
---
Uh what?
---
Okay mister smarty pants, tell me what's going to happen when it is "all burned down"?  Do you think Goons, or TAPI, or Horde, are just going to curl up and die?  Tell me what is this "something better" is, other than your personal Grr Nullsec block, fap fantasy.
---
I don't think he was instalocked. He looked like he wasn't paying attention and was just sitting there. He missed them because they weren't on his overview it seems.
---
Non esi compliant probably. Better off without them.
---
Another good shit post in one day keep it up guys
---
Well you are in Goons, so the answer is yes.
---
Oh, that. Okay, I thought it was something different.
---
I believe the proper CCP response would be to turn up the heat, more drifters, more systems invaded etc ...
---
fucking modzis reee
---
WH guy: 😎
---
If you firesaled it to the locals/new owners then they got a profit from taking the station, which they don't today.
---
wh guy: oh wow! i found another human today
---
Yes true, all null player is actualy affiliated with a coalition,  near or far but affiliated .
---
As funny and meme-inducing as it all is, do you even have a grasp on what these mechanics mean for null sec? I didn't really see anything in your post except for the same thing you're accusing mittens of, so I'm curious if you actually know what you're talking about.
---
If that were to happen because of another player, you would see all these sperglords talking shit about how he should have had his overview set up properly and it was his fault for being dumb. They'll also talk shit about players dying to gate camps of instalockers and smartbombers.  For some reason because it's NPCs killing players, all of a sudden it's a huge fucking problem, because in video games players should be like way better than NPCs and we should be able to just like 1-shot them.
---
To be fair I probably haven't tried cruiser roaming since the minimal nerfs to carriers because it became extremely unfun to roam in null, and I haven't seen anything to indicate that's changed.
---
"oh"   
---
yea that sums it up
---
this is what you look like when you buy off the rack and don't bother getting it altered
---
I love Find-Another-Human-Day!
---
yes it is, because its fun seeing a 40.000 man strong alliance sperging about it while seeing pandemic horde develop a successful counter to them and actually fighting them
---
Originally gallente was supposed to be based purely off hull tank but they never fixed the rep so eventually they just threw it out and said "working as intended"
---
The salt must flow
---
The largest is as big as a carrier, so it would take a while.
---
Is that a picture of Mao? The guy that killed more people than Hitler? This Corp must be full of a bunch of cunts to use a picture of one of the only people that makes hitler look not so bad.
---
Nope, the drifters are not ruining THE game, just YOUR game. Remember?
---
Isn't that the name of the game?
---
Brutal savage rekt, absolutely taken down
---
Yeah, having Mittens, Vince, gobbins, and vily come to the table and sign nips is a pretty significant event
---
It has a suit and tie, I suppose a T-Rex head.  LoL
---
Are you on the spectrum, sir?
---
&gt; ~not mad btw~
---
is this new material for r/eve parlance
---
U/squizz I have a bunch of characters in different corporations. Is there a way to see which of my own characters' kills will be uploaded or will I have to make a spreadsheet to keep track?
---
Nice!
---
So?
---
irrelevant to the discussion. We could make a hull tanked brutix navy with 250k EHP and the same issue would be present with trying to repair hull inbetween fights when you don't have access to a citadel.
---
make sure to lock yourself in your bearhole for no risk pve fag
---
As a member of the opposite bloc this will of course be exaggerated. But I'm not really sure what your point is. Let's say for a moment that your whole post is 100% the truth and nothing but the truth - does that mean it's good for the game when you do it?
---
&gt; taking subcapital battle with NCPL was at the same time acceptance of instant supercapital escalation the moment NCPL started to lose the fight
---
This is bad game design whether it's 2015 or 2019. However, it's worse in 2019, because fighters (even after their nerf) are more cancerous to subcaps that carrier drones were, injectors mean ever more capital pilots to drop on you, and staging citadels mean you're always in range of the umbrella and coalitions can have ships in multiple places and jump clones. Instant cynos are just broken - they always have been, but with the ever-increasing number of capital capable pilots and groups, it's more damaging to the game than ever.
---
Maybe the people who experienced the wrong end of the stick in 2015 should have used that experience to guide CCP via their many CSM representatives, for the good of the game, rather than apparently pushing them towards ever more advantages for dug in nullsec farming residents.
---
Looks like they also hit the cyno jammer
---
BETTER EVAC. Oh wait, they are almost out of regions to run to...  
---
For real though who cares. Drifters haven't shown for a final timer yet. Stop trying to make this NPC shit seem like a huge impact.
---
&gt;Leadership takes the game about as seriously as BoB did
---
I'm pretty sure mittens has taken the game WAY more serious then molle has had during his time .
---
Some say wormhole people are so devoid of human contact that they have developed their own languages, but also the silence of wormhole space has twisted their minds. Wormhole pilots who often escape the void to tell the tale are plagued by vivid and deranged hallucinations.
---
not sure on mechanics but pretty sure drifter battleships can be d-scanned
---
It goes kaboom. I have a video of one from a few months ago that was really cool, I'll look for it
---
oh grow up you miserable cunt
---
 Also in the store:  [https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/](https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/)
---
I'm not in game right now to check the layout, but one method can be to move which high slot the actual gun is in, which will move it to a corresponding slot on the ship. 
---
For example, on a ship with two turret slots and one utility high slot you can do this. 
---
[GUN][NOS][GUN] as opposed to [GUN][GUN][NOS] and that will move the second gun to a different spot on the ship. 
---
I can't promise that's possible on the slasher without looking at it in game, but that's the only possible solution (aside from a bug report)
---
Zkill is basically just a big grift. Someone adds a personal API but happens to be a director then Squizz rips all your past and future kills from everyone in the entire corp without asking for permission. Coalition leaderships have started digging up and confronting people with this fact so they can remove the API which cuts into Squizz's profits and so he reduces transparency further.
---
have they even been around long enough for a final timer to come out?
---
It s like eve but uglier and in medieval. Not specialy better.
---
Except the static has its static as well as any dynamic holes. Unless you put eyes on every single hole in there, then it is not inherently safe.
---
This has everything I like.
---
Does this make us mates now?
---
Nah. Even back then people claimed what you are claiming now, and I responded that the claim was [straw man](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9r26eo/are_there_any_consequences_of_being_a_racist_in/e8e6zts/).
---
Feel free to keep Grr Olmec'ing though.
---
You say that like Goons haven't been... but we'd rather be killing Horde than killing Drifters.
---
What do you mean by scouts and recons?
---
Lost me at irregardless.
---
&gt;and if you lose the roll you just insta die, no amount of skill or tank will allow you a chance to survive
---
This has literally been in J space for years. Get over it and use cloaky ships to juke drifters like us. 
---
Adapt or die

I think my mind just melted reading this, hitting the hotkey assigned for broadcast for reps....

Mmm...

Top 5 in quantity I can believe.  Quality not so much.
---
Yep, biggest error of the peasantry is that you have to overdress to look like the wealthy when all you end up doing is looking like you work for the wealthy. 
---
Jeans/Slacks/shorts, a polo shirt, nice shoes and an expensive sports watch is the uniform of the actual well-to-do.
---
Like nullbears and super umbrellas?
---
Wow

I think you may want to consider laying off the meds

laughs in c2
---
You do realize this is a hobby project he does for free on his own dime right? he has exactly 0 obligation to "increase customer satisfaction" and is perfectly justified in making his job as easy as possible. Don't like it? take a hike.
---
praise bob
---
That and their killboard. Heavens forbid any of those kills should show up on their killboard and everyone points and laughs
---
That’s a good point.
---
Make a better website in your spare time or stfu. He doesn't need to add the delay if he doesn't want to lmao.
---
&gt; How do you magically tell there is an Anchored Bubble in the next site you're aligned to out of Dscan range?
---
its almost like you can, you know, warp somewhere else in the cluster closer and dscan, advanced tactics i know. You could even be extra advanced - one might even say esports worthy - and use your cyno alt(please dont tell me you have a super and no alt acc) to scout it for you.
---
&gt;I don't think you know how hunting Supers long-term works
---
says the guy who think they put the inhib after the super lands.
---
&gt; I guess it's easy for Pubbie Shits on Reddit to lemming after 'HURR DURR SUPER UMBRELLA' without actually knowing how it's done
---
i agree that its pretty easy to do that, your entire coalition does it. Also pubbie coalition member #2343 calling others pubbies 2k19 is amusing
---
Yeah, you're getting downvoted, but you're 100% right. Less people that fly blingy subcaps are logging in. If they are logging in, they're docked more instead of camping a gate or flying around looking for kills. Losing a high grade implant set or abyssal fit frigate to something with no countrrplay just isn't fun for anyone.
---
Pubbies....
---
If what happened here was that he jumped and left his account for time enough for his ship to decloack and a few extra secs that allowed the drifters to lock him, them that one is indeed on his ass! Nobody should go AFK on a gate in the middle of null sec! :(
---
I am only now trying out abyssal space and this is helping me out big time. Thank you!
---
you do know that no citadels have died yet so there are no kills to avoid?
---
So they're looking for what's causing the drifters to focus them... Nice... I hope this isn't it.
---
Bitchturco Gianni.
---
Key term being yet.... muahahahahaha
---
We’re in a C3 and are encouraged to get our relics, gas, ore, and combat sites, we have an honor system 10% tax on stuff that come from our hole, anything anywhere else is fair game and our own business.
---
yeah about that... Mao being a murder happy fuck stick does not make hitler look like any less of a genocidal fuck stick
---
Your response was bullshit. Instead of contacting anyone whos in charge there to sort that issue out you made a provocative reddit post against goons and claimed that the backlash from that was them supporting racists while completely ignoring that it was in fact a direct result of you provoking them in public. 
---
Now who of us is building strawmans?
---
5
---
i made the comment as a meme
---
but serious discussion though, you can roll and set up your wormhole where the only way someone can enter the wormhole is if they open a new wormhole that rolls into you, thats cutting off the ways enter your krabbing system by half. 
---
like you can always use any gate in null, you cant magically turn off half the ways
---
Game development is literally direct dev intervention :thinking:
---
I've found Aussies don't react as badly as Kiwis do when you call them Australian.
---
&gt; "hey you die no outplaying"
---
And this isn't true in the majority of gatecamps that people jump into? Give me a fucking break.
---
what about you pay for it then
---
Yeah you're actually right on that for sure.
---
Have you never seen a shield ship before?
---
&gt; Adapt or die
---
This only applies to everyone except goons.
---
Shame. Shame. Shame.
---
You're not a customer unless you're actually paying Squizz to maintain zkill, and given the cost of software engineers, I'm pretty sure you're not.
---
But you're welcome to try to create a better tool if you don't like his.
---
Your right, listening to mittens moron-cast, he mentioned its the “largest battle fleet ever assembled in Eve history”, I’m sure you all are worried about getting jumped.
---
But yeah, in a month we will see how he spins this highsec ruin. I’m betting total failure.
---
Pretty sure all NPCs can be D-scanned if you have your filters configured properly. I haven't seen D-scan immunity on an NPC yet
---
Praise our Drifter Overlords
---
wah.  It'll be over in a few weeks, if we know how EVE works.  Then you can be safe in your hard-to -defend thousand structures in the big blue donut.
---
Publicly asking about it has its advantages. People know whether you can be openly racist in the alliance and get away with it. And the racist dudes behavior get exposed.
---
I by no means claim I don't make some of my Reddit posts provocative.
---
I didn't provoke anyone in that systems local. Provocation doesn't justify racism either.
---
All that doesn't mean at all that I somehow implied all Goons are racist. You are sustaining the strawman and even expanding on it. Too much koolaid distorted your critical faculties mate. This is my last response to this debate. I don't have as much time for the likes of you anymore.
---
&gt; there is really no way to get ratting tax in wh space.
---
Yes there is. Do loot buyback at a healthy margin.
---
Yeah man. Respect. 
---
Rog and I deliberately burned bling-BLOPs just for the thrill. Best evening of dropping and getting dropped I've ever had. 
---
I can only imagine the thrill of pushing a titan into the middle of the table.
---
I mean, he joined goons again, so...
---
The Japanese Empire also makes the Nazi's look like playground bullies.
---
They hated him because he was right
---
Also long time no see mate, hope all is well
---
I love your posts!
---
Generally you rat in the static because site respawn in your home is too slow to sustain even one player.
---
We don't, but I can see a reason to leave the sites, since it's not generally where you want to rat anyway - they will attract random ratters and then you can gank them easily since you own the system.
---
If you visit his website with AdBlock enabled, you'll find out real quick that you are, in fact, a paying customer. 
---
You pay with your attention and your time. Squizz takes that time and gets money from advertisers. So yes, we are all customers. 
---
You should value your time more.
---
After reading what you just wrote. It's clear that you missed the point entirely. So thanks for the response. But I'm not going to converse with you other then this post.
---
You have a good day ok.
---
more than 100 pings from drifters in delve yesterday and none were followups.
---
and one is a player, and one is the game
---
imagine being this delusional
---
laughing in C4
---
Whats wrong with a Casio watch? Mine has had zero problems in 20 years, never needs the batteries changed, and never needs its time set.
---
Yep, we do this and plenty of people are happy to sell loot to the corp and save themselves the logistics.
---
Praise Bob!
---
Your hatboner vs nc. Pl is strong thank god we planend everything including drifters at a bbq some years back.
---
Trump is far right and Pence was **elected** which was what you said did not happen.
---
&gt;Yes, if a hard-right nationalist did get  elected that would be true.  But one hasn't been yet, so I'm not really  sure what your point is.
---
They ran together, same ticket, that's how the US system works.
---
All words are made up ;)
---
My God, THANK YOU FOR SAYING THIS! I once worked in a gentleman's outfitter and things like this make me want to turn my face inside out.
---
It doesn't matter if we create our own killboard. Because he's not giving corporation and alliance leadership the transparency we need to manage our people on his tool, opponents can still use the intel provided.
---
We make our own tool and encourage everyone in our alliance to use it, but Chuckles A Dumbfuuk, a director of longtime corp Home for Dipshits, has put his director level api on zkill. The corporation can't tell one of its directors is an idiot, and the alliance can't pressure the corporation to unfuck itself. 
---
This has nothing to do with making our own tool, and everything to do with the owner of the current tool being a piece of shit.
---
If you buy a 30 dollar shirt and pay 30 on alterations it looks better than a 60 dollar shirt off the rack. Doesn't apply here but definitely something to consider. Also, if you get a tailor, they'll usually alter what you buy from them.
---
Exposing Corp ESI via Director/CEO level ESI Keys is against CCP EULA on the developer portal fyi.
---
If people were serious, they could get your developer access banned.
---
PL did not start off as a supercap dominant alliance and you could still join them no problem as a subcap guy.
---
PL started from Sniggerdly corp, which was one of the very old pirate corps (ancestral home around Amamake).
---
In the days of BoB, they lived next door in Fountain, and they were not known for being caps/supercaps guys.
---
Things changed later one, but their roots still lay into that and even today you could probably join them as a non-capital pilot.
---
Nobody cares, fuck off and when you get there fuck off some more.
---
Not a drifter thread, take my upvote
---
Multiple sources have stated that these drifters cannot be d-scanned or probed.
---
Maybe they're going to join PL
---
Im already sold hehe. Will start in 2 weeks and i got some more time. Any useful guides?
---
The purpose of hull tanking is to provide huge bait.
---
GRRR Olmeca!!   Keep doing Bob's work my dude!
---
Yes, I understand that people are people and NPCs are NPCs. Thanks for the insight.
---
the post. The post was provocative and people that attacked you in there didn't make racist remarks nor did they support racists or back them **as opposed to what you claimed**. You're building the strawmen you claim i'm using yourself and then pretend i'm using them.  
---
&gt;Too much koolaid distorted your critical faculties mate.   
---
I am not a goon, i'm just frequenting this sub a lot and had to suffer from your terrible posting for a good while now.
---
We leave non-combat data/relics up some times to shoot at explorers. I still want to get in a good fight Astero vs. Astero, all three of the ones I’ve caught had bad fits and didn’t put up a lot of fight.
---
&gt;Since they are mid slots they never going to be used for anything else than in-space hull repairs on a mobile depot anyway.
---
have you heard of shields
---
Cva would welcome a amarr pilot
---
I fucking love you 😂😂
---
"just buy an alt 4Head"
---
You're making a whole bunch of assumptions and stupid comparisons imo. And I'm guessing you haven't had to deal with them yet because you'd realize how stupid they are compared to players and other NPCs
---
Explain to me how this shit is fair and fun to deal with: https://i.imgur.com/24ZM063.png
---
I have never and will never use my EVE logins on a 3rd party website. I always use a heavy security AbBlocker everywhere. That being said, I would pay out of game $ for a Zkillboard that I could completely customize to my preferences and NOT require my ESI/API.
---
TIL also that Eve is a solo game. Christ you're retarded.
---
Same that guy above. In C3
---
Wee woo wee woo
---
Somebody send this guy a police skin!!
---
And invasions offer a double mining speed bonus in the footholds! :D
---
Shh don’t give away the golden rule of FCing in eve.  Now we won’t be special
---
Your logic is as flawed as the homophobic language you seem to like.
---
NOW the truth comes out about why you're covered in salt about goons.
---
YES, LET'S SCOUT EVERY GATE JUST INCASE THE GAME HAPPENS TO DECIDE " YOU DIE NOW" LOL GOOD IDEA
---
Thanks dude!
---
They should get rid of drifters and just give everyone a 1/10,000 chance of getting space dysentery every time you perform an action. Make a market trade, that's a shot. Take a gate, it might be your last. No matter whether docked or not, everything gives you a chance of getting space dysentery. Then it should give you a pop up: "YOU HAVE DIED OF SPACE DYSENTERY."
---
C4 wormholers do not have rights
---
Nice job telling that to part of PanFam leadership :joy:
---
Most licensed plumbers call themselves plumbers, and unlicensed plumbers are a threat to public health.
---
As I said, he's not the President.
---
It used to be called BattleClinic and tbh, it was good.
---
One guy and his 20 alts
---
&gt;so they can remove the API which cuts into Squizz's profits  
---
Ok then....
---
I feel like you meant to reply to someone else, because what you posted doesn't seem to relate to what I said.
---
So, these drifters can now destroy all player's assets from the system?
---
And thus cause that system to be claimed by another player/corp/alliance?
---
It would be interestung to see drifters show up to a major battle and win.
---
I thought the whole thing was making fun of albion?
---
Naaaaaah, not possible!
---
&gt;I have never and will never use my EVE logins on a 3rd party website.
---
Lucky you! You don't have to. The zkill login page redirects you to a CCP site where you type your creds and zkill never sees them.
---
I remember when that was a thing when fozziesov was launched
---
I hope they do, I want it really bad.
---
That face at 9-13. I've made that face.
---
It does give counter evidence to the whine of 'it is impossible' when goons did it.
---
I hope this is a troll just so people don't have to come and make fun of you.
---
Just here for tears. :)
---
Yes. Log in to the EVE community site with each account and see if zkill is on the list.

That's not how ads work.
---
You said elected.

sounds gay
---
Who actually would wear a breitling with a suit eww.
---
That was difficult to read
---
They can be.
---
I believe there is still some kind of version of this, not in the 'system wide' context, but some kind of system that allows players to circumvent the ui.
---
Meh lots of salt maybe its time to make that isk liquid and gtfo null if you dont like it. Thats the best part.
---
Wh guy: oh wow! i found ~~another human today~~a reason to log on again.
---
Because it made the goons (and mittani) foam at the mouth ?
---
Now that was funny. :P
---
Some might say... hyperreal.
---
Your tears, they taste delicious. Your cry’s of pain, like a symphony.
---
I hate to ask, but can we get more?
---
awe muffin...
---
What you seem to fail to understand is that this is not 'content' that CCP has added, but a tax. An effort tax which puts a downwards pressure-incentive on structure count. The old balance was that an entire 1000 man alliance would base out of 1 or 2 outposts in null. CCP has implemented drifter attacks so that players have incentive to return to this old ratio of players to structure. Don't be a blobcuck, leave goons.
---
... and left again, forgiven again.
---
Oh god i haven't seen this in years.
---
Me too pls
---
Do those new Drifter Battleships have Doomsday on board much like those Drifter Emergency Response Battleships from C5, C6 Escalations?
---
Mittens is already in tears, that can be a conflict or shame driver to split some away from the zombie bees.
---
What more when they see opportunities to rain on the retreat train?
---
Except salt... There's still plenty of salt.
---
NPC Null can certainly stay.
---
Damn, that's got to be annoying. No wonder you guys are salty as fuck
---
Chang dong my dude. Hell yeah.
---
Maybe if you keep blueballing them they'll give up and go home
---
I never mentioned a suit, you probably wouldn’t wear a superocean with a rubber band with a suit but you would definitely wear the heritage version with a crocodile leather strap with a suit.
---
I would 100% never wear a breitling to an actual event. You’d never get invited back.
---
That’s just Kilgarth kicking deadbeats.
---
Whoa... that’s a blast from the past
---
I'll have to try to probe or scan them down then because that's pretty interesting if true. Even the Triglavians can be scanned
---
All those risk adverse players hiding in WHs! :D
---

The content has been in wormholes for years. If I jump an expensive, not cloaky ship unscouted into a C5 or C6 and there's a drifter on the hole - I die. Straight up. Do you hear us whining like salty thundercunts about it? No, because there are ways to deal with it.
---
Adapt or die, right?
---
Yeah, in goons you're just forced to blue lmao
---
Why? The only situation where you couldn’t wear a Breitling is a black tie event and that’s what Patek Philippe’s are for.
---
But the only winning move is not to play :thinking:
---
Did you know ...
---
That trying to point the finger at NC and PL to get attention away from the CFC doesn't work?
---
PL and NC have done underhanded things *in the game*
---
Where as Goons have attacked the **players** *outside of the game for **years***
---
I've done it myself, they don't show up even with all filters off
---
&gt; You can buy it here: https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC

Theres is no banner or anything indicating the pack being on sale but if you look at the earlier version of the website you can see the same pack at a 50$/€ price tag: http://web.archive.org/web/20190607110533/https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/
---
No, I tried offering that once and was lynched by the community. Won't happen from me, needs to happen from CCP, who I'm wholly in support of delaying killmails.
---
Our Corp has this policy. Anything in the home hole goes to SRP. I don’t know why for sure, but a couple reasons I can think of:
---
1) Boosts Corp funds. They’re keeping citadels fueled and everything else running for you. So it makes sense that home sites would be a good source of isk for that.
---
2) Encourages scanning. If people could run the home hole sites for isk then they just scan the statics and run them. If they have to eat in the static’s that’s at least two levels down the chain that they need to scan first. So opens up more content and travel routes for the others in Corp.
---
3) Better bait. People are probably more likely to try and attack you ratting in your static than in your home hole. Anytime we’re gas huffing or ratting we’re serving the purpose of being bait for our Corp. A lot of content comes from saving the ratting fleet etc...
---
4) Reduces Arguments: The sites in your home hole would quickly get run and be gone. Then you’d have line members complaining that other line members are taking all the home sites. In the static if someone runs all the sites just roll the static and run the next one.
---
Eh our counter works but check the bwf-z killboards around 21:00 eve time.  Getting killed over and over again in cheap t1 corms for an hour isn't exactly fun
---
He didn't forget it - he is incapable of conceptualizing it because he is a narcissist.
---
I mean it was an achievement pre injectors. So not really the same. Plus CCP nerfed it, so hopefully they do more to stop test and goons in the coming months.
---
Thanks, you're right.
---
Bbbbbut why can’t they have their own personal citadel?!? Mama mittens said each goon was their own special snowflake and deserved their own citadel!
---
I often get this request, and what many forget is that I actually did this once.
---
I was lynched by the community for it. So no, won't be happening again.
---
doesn't make it a not shit game mechanic
---
Difference being they're are everywhere and force you to fight or lose reinforcement/structures lol
---
So which is it. un-outplayable, or just a shitty mechanic?
---
Breitlings are every day work watch’s. going out ?  Never the breitling, Smack the Patek on. black tie you want some contrast, Vacheron maybe. Person taste.

Good. Fuck all these glorified team captains trying to swing their micro-penises around Lording over their peons.

The Union would disagree with your stupidity.  There are hundreds of thousands of plumbers without a license, they're called apprentice and journeyman plumbers, and you're not eligible for a license until your 5th year in the Union, but you'll run work and lay pipe the entire time. 
---
You learn the codes, you learn the work, the license is just bullshit paper work to generate revenue, most journeymen know everything a master plumber knows, and states differ from place to place on what you need as far as certification goes.  
---
You should probably stick to what you know, which doesn't seem to be much.
---
So other than some vague fantasy, of which you haven't even tried to answer any of the questions, I asked I feel like [I'm playing chess with a pigeon.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pigeon_chess)

key word sufficient quantities. WH do not produce that much moongoo, especially r64. .5 and lowsec produce almost zero r64.

I watched him let a 60 man super capital fleet "sneak" through two adjacent cyno jammed systems and then somehow warp ontop of his cap fleet... So not actually good just lets say usually conscious.
---
&gt;lose reinforcement
---
So you drop 1 reinforcement timer. Who's gonna invade delve?
---
and if I was in 2015 i'd be complaining about it too, what is your point?
---
In null you see them coming in local 10 jumps away, in WH you see them coming when the sabre shows up on dscan or when you hear a WH activation on an alt (or not if they are camping you, you might just get the 5s lock delay of a covops T3). They each have their intricacies.
---
why should ccp fix something caused by other groups?
---
I guess people will just start flying T3s if T2 prices go up.
---
It won't impact me if T2 prices go up, I have like enough stockpiled t2 stuff to fit up at least 1000-2000 bombers 500 sabres, 200 lokis, and a dozen blops and I have some spare JF. I also have enough ammo to reinforce all the structures in delve.

Bring back the old dd+cynos! Let the drifters completely destroy everything in a system with zero warning!
---
But ASCEE weren’t kicked?
---
What you're missing is the feature where sometimes when you jump a gate you just get instapopped because drifters, which puts a downwards pressure on undocking.
---
I think this calls for a science experiment. I have the pleasure of working with both breeds, so let's see how this plans out.
---
&gt; If the endgoal is to stockpile until a time the prices are 'juicy' in highsec so you then liquidate those reserves, that can work,
---
i mean not even that would work cause of liquidity, they could maybe keep it stockpiled to keep building stuff below market price in the future but it sounds awfully like an underestimation of how much ore they'll accumulate...
---
the funniest thing is that the logistic guys they're sucking the dick so hard with this are the ones who will be affected the most, cause if they buyback the ore at 100% jita the value of moving said ore turns into literally zero, and the miners will just sell to the goon buyback guy paying 100% instead of the logistics guys jumping it to sell in jita.
---
Oh yes indeed. Also, the best food!

---
Also, new adverts playing or even the old ones, ccplz.
---
They work under the control of a licensed plumber, to a licensed plumbers plan, and complete work that passes inspection by a licensed plumber.  
---
See the thing with my license is this; if I were to just go do work outside of my license (because licenses are just bullshit paper to you) and I get caught, I'm losing my license.  That license is kind of important to have to maintain my proper insurances,  further, my workers comp rightly wouldn't cover wages if I had an employee injured doing work outside coverage,  neither would my liability,  I'm not going to get sued by an employee and the entity I'm doing work for just to save some pennies and cut out a sub.
---
The other thing with the license is this, learning the irc for residential is stupidly simple.  I've known some certified retards who were able to pass the test to get the license.  So, why not go pass that test and make plumbers scale instead of carpenters scale?  Do you not like money?
---
&gt;Or if players take advantage of these timers to go &lt;accomplish some special goal they had, but weren't able to accomplish in the past&gt;?

no one has time to do that because they are busy playing defense on their own timers.

Actually what he specifically said was, there was a small chance we would continue, and that choice was taken away from us. Which is true. We would have had to re-stage further towards our destination, and that quickly because impossible after all of GSOL was forced to go back home to refit, refuel, and continuously gun a few hundred citadels. The possibility of redeploying was going to be discussed yesterday.
---
shield reps are far better in general than hull reps, you'll have a hard time justifying ever trading the utility of a mid for it as they are now, that isn't true of a shield booster.
---
this is a ~great~ post
---
Why do I learn this on a day with no radiation sortie?
---
from laughing too hard ? yeah probably
---
I know they were going to add Citadel SKINs in December (which was then moved to this summer, which was then quietly dropped for some reason). Maybe we could get structure interior SKINs as well?
---
I'm reasonably sure they haven't been changed in any meaningful fashion for over 16 years.
---
If Goons weren't doing it now, NCPL would be. It's not like they magically grew a willingness not to, someone forced it out of them.
---
Ideally neither of them would do it, but if Goons disbanded tonight, tomorrow you'd see someone step into the role.
---
Kind of like deploying 1000 titans to a region puts downward pressure on undocking
---
Or, get good intel and don't be terrible?
---
I was in one inside of 24 hours of starting the game. Nine years later, and I still haven't left.
---
Dang, looks like all the hardcore pvp corps left. RIP Goons
---
Well, what do you want to do in the sandbox?
---
Joining up with peeps is good for making the game more fun but you want to go with a group that is into doing stuff you like.
---
Do the career missions and get an idea of what you like doing most in-game. Then try and find a corp that does that activity. 
---
The benefits of a corp is that they can help you learn things that you don't know to google. Friendship and camaraderie makes the game exponentially more fun, in my opinion. 
---
r/evejobs is a sub for recruitment. There's also a chat in game under corps. The official forums also have recruitment sections. 
---
Good luck and have fun.
---
as though scouts have never existed in the world. How about sometimes losses are forced in this game to make some areas highrisk. IE: drifters randomly fragging shit in wh and ns
---
Of course,  
---
Drifters are more difficult to fight than Horde, and we all know Goons want a 4:1 advantage ;-)
---
its pretty mind boggling people were okay with citadels literally all having the same model in their class in the fist place. They had heaps of structures with unique models to use as a base but i guess that's work and ccp was too busy working on their instanced pve to care about things actually in the open world
---
LowSec Guy: "Can you guys get Ventures out of plexes?"

If I wanted to do stuff more on the business side of things, AKA not too much combat, more player interactions that results in heavy amounts of money, what should I do? Is that even possible in a game like this?

Once, a Kestrell class frigate managed to undock and PL failed to respond.

The four in hand is such an informal knot, the kind of knot that you wear to your accounting job (because you have to). If you're going to go far as wearing a three-piece suit. Not stepping to a Windsor, is not completing the outfit.
---
As soon as you have a rough idea of the various gameplay styles, enough that you can refine your search a little.
---
There are a LOT of corps out there!
---
Try to filter by:
---
- Your timezone (exclude any that say all, most are lying)
---
- Your gameplay styles that you enjoy (again, exclude any that say all, most are lying)
---
- New player friendly (not a must, but some corps are better kitted out to start you on your way)
---
Other than that, it's personal preference, though I would suggest trying to find a smaller but active group to learn from. It's easy to get lost in a sea of bodies without actually being taught much of significance.
---
Good luck!

maybe he put a mask on it. just to be sure...
---
Come on, these days it makes no damn difference unless your "going out" venue is a gran gala. We live in the age of the submariner&amp;suit.
---
There's still way better ways to go about it. Citadels being stronger force multipliers, like giving them titan phenos and more burst projectors, makes a smaller force more likely to be able to engage a larger force.
---
Maybe tie all citadel shields in a system to a single "shield generator" citadel, where if you take it out, all shields drop on every citadel in system. Again, nothing to worry about for small corps, but for someone with 50 citadels in a system (see: 1DQ1) it would be a huge tactical hit. I'd be perfectly ok with something like that.
---
What i'm not ok with is forced PVE, in any form. PVE should be a means to an end (PVP) and that's the way the game as always been. More engaging PVE is fine too, god knows most of the PVE in this game is terrible. But it should ALWAYS be optional, and it should NEVER interrupt any kind of players vs player content. Not even for a second.

DOOOOM

OOoh, whatchu got? I assume it^s a solar model?

Lots out there, depending on what you're trying to do. Not being afraid of getting shot is important. Other than unfucking your overview with Z-S or Sarashawa, and learning to pewpew in frigates from the Eve Is Easy guides, I'm not the one to ask about how to be a newbro.

Their only vulnerable point is their company income.

"Kick where it hurts" is our only option.

something about squares and dates and shit

Can you not be such a pussy then?
---
This only proves you’re easily entertained.
---
100% this. The amount of times I hear "It's ok, I'm ISK positive" is increasing. Killing a 200m ISK ship doesn't give you 200m ISK, you're not 200m ISK in the back.
---
Accept that you lost a ship, hopefully learned something, but don't justify the loss against having your name against a kill on zKill
---
Even in a game some people love to be someone's bitch.

You mean a big hollowed out wreck that use to be the station for a hanger ? :D

That stuff is all good. But if you only wear it every couple of years you end up having to get it tailored every time lol

I haven't played eve in years... can you explain what caused this?

Its going to be difficult without other people. I'd join a group just to learn what they use and where and try to seed the markets they use. Set up buy orders for the junk and terrible prices ;)
---
If you've spent 17 years playing a computer game, you've spent 17 years wrongly.

Definitely better lol

I’ve played eve for 11 years (still do). I highly recommend picking up Albion if you like sandbox mmo with hardcore pvp. Also about 1/10th of the annoyances of EVE

I think his point is that being a mid slot module has absolutely nothing to do with why hull reps aren't used.

---
People sit on gates all the time to bait fights.
---
&gt;Because he's not giving corporation and alliance leadership the transparency we need to manage our people on his tool 
---
He's not obligated to do so in the slightest  
---
&gt;The corporation can't tell one of its directors is an idiot, and the alliance can't pressure the corporation to unfuck itself  
---
Why not? (For both)  
---
&gt;This has nothing to do with making our own tool, and everything to do with the owner of the current tool being a piece of shit.  
---
The only piece of shit here is you
---
I never said it was effective, yes, CCP could do a lot better in that department, but when you have a thousand goons saying that they love structure bashing, some at CCP might get confused by what actual eve players want.
---
SHOOT THE GLASS
---
The ones in highsec bashing shit don’t I’m pretty sure
---
You can't talk to him. Globby has been a salty cunt since his mom weened him off the tit

Good quality shitpost......please take my updoot

It’s not hard to move jump freighters ^^ you don’t need more then 10-20 people to do all the exports from delve

It was the fear that caused them to be talked about

Well, they cost like $90 when they first came out.
---
My advice to new players has always been this... take your time. Experience and learn the basics. There's plenty to do without a corp. If you need help, there's also plenty of people looking to help in game and on forums. But be careful for the scammers.
---
Run some missions, do the career agents... get a feel for the ships. Find your path before finding a corp.
---
depending on where you get them from, a MTM suit will be lower quality than an OTR suit you bring to a good tailor. but if you pay for a good MTM suit, goddamn they feel good
---
Heaps? What had heaps of models?
---
Old structures that we've had were four, one for each race, or eight, if you take poses into account. Right now we've got nine (I think?) citadels, each with unique design. So we're one ahead.
---
Generally 2-4 weeks after you've played around and learned how things work/what you wish to focus on. 
---
Beware of corps looking to use their members, or offering free things, or anything else that seems to good to be true. It normally is.
---
So that's why is there so fucking many refineries all around highsec
---
Oh yeah, G-Shocks are usually in the 80-120€ here in Europe, but you can still get a G-2900f for 50, and as far as practicality goes, it does the trick.

So you get a weapons timer by using an offensive module. So what if you don't?
---
Imagine fleets of hull tanked ships being able to freely approach without really caring about repairs because they heal so damn much. Mining ships that tank a gank solely from using a hull repper.
---
Using one's own products is just good practice.
---
Good luck ;)

As a VERY new player i dont know if i joined at a good time or very bad time lol
---
I tried to move into a C6 wormhole with friends that had only 2 moons, and therefore only 2 possible structures.
---
It was dormant, and about 10 of us spent the time to shoot down one tower and anchor our own.
---
While we were anchoring, someone logged on from the other tower.
---
The hole only had a static to a C1, which only allowed frigates and cruiser sized ships through it. It also had a wormhole anomaly that gave bonuses to small guns. So all frigates were "supercharged". 
---
We spent the next 72 hours trying to fight off an ever increasing fleet of stealth bombers and logi cruisers. But, unfortunately we weren't able to online all of our POS modules before they began their siege.
---
We didn't have the numbers to fight back, so I spent my time onlining as many shield hardener as I could to make their lives miserable. I had to do a lot of tricky smuggling through the C1 to do this, and was successful every time.
---
Unfortunately it didn't deter them, and they eventually kicked us out.
---
I suppose the 2 moon thing doesn't matter anymore.
---
If I die, I die. All part of the fun. Nothing I can make back
---
They mention a lot of shit tbh.
---
I completely disagree with this comment. Most new player corps give free things away.

I'm not sure you understand what zkill uses your ESI for
