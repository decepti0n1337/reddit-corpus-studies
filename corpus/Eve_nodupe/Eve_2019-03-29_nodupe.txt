But yeah I've only known capitals during this time they have been super buff, it's what made them so appealing. Im not hardcore enough to exclusively fly caps, so I do also enjoy flying subcaps. Some of my most exciting fights have been in frigs (bombers).

I'm upset with the changes, but like the title says, I understand why they did it. And this isn't going to stop me from logging in, and having a good time.

So is this related to another Sotiyo spawn?

You seem angry I agreed with someone on the internet. I know it's really fucking weird and everything but I don't think we need to go straight to the butt stuff just yet.

Why don't you just... sit there and keep them docked?

Eventually one of them will get desperate and undock. The call of the isk is too great.

Thanks again and I hope to see everyone again and again I apologise I didn't know you had mentioned to you before the holidays are coming to see me again I apologise I didn't know you had mentioned to you before the holidays are coming to see me again I apologise I didn't get to you by tomorrow I apologise I thought you before I leave for the day but if not then I'll get you a check for me again what you before you leave to see if we could get a check from the day of the event and I will be at your office

Never not combine active and passive tanks!

So sad I moved out of Texas.
---
&gt; so if ships are tweaked at all you throw out months worth of grinding potentially so you can shift with the meta?

Would you rather have one meta going for 50 years?

Idk why you would want to?

If any individual station has more tham several million worth you can set up a public contract and firesale it from anywhere in space for like 80% jita buy and it will sell. If its less than a couple million (ypu can decide what your threshhold is based on your own wealth level) just trash it. If its worth less than 1 million per jump its really not worth it. 
---
TL;DR no one answered our batphone for the Fortizars, so now we're appealing for the public to support us with thoughts and prayers.
---
&gt;  so abyss t2/t3
---
Needing to throw billions into a ship and billions more into a pod to 100% lose it on a dice roll is EXTREMELY unappealing for like 20mil in loot per dice roll. I'm not the gambling type, so gambling so much in the abyss sounds like a horrible idea.
---
&gt;do scanning
---
This was my primary income for a long time. I resisted getting into ratting for a long time because it provided me with all the income i needed. Recently neutral explorers have been coming more and more into catch and cherry picking sites which ruins the whole thing for everyone. So for the last couple months i've been cleaning up worthless site after worthless site for hours on end.
---
&gt; salvage behind a super in impass
---
You mean eso? I was told supers/rorqs are now not allowed to rat in impass due to war time? Anyway i never wanted to ask because i don't want people to think i'm trying to blue scout ratting capitals. 
---
&gt;I think to make my point better cause I feel we agree on parts here. I don’t want to fight you in your vni, I wanna fight you and your friends in pvp ships that have a good chance of beating me and my friends, but aren’t impossible for us to fight back against.
---
I feel like you aren't typical. In my experience most roamers want only VNIs and avoid all conflicts with standing fleet period.

hello yes i am texan, where do the spaceships meet

stop making sense! Lol

Actually statics still stay closed once rolled until someone initiates warp to them. Then the forced timer will start for the K162 side.
---
Reverse recruitment post?
---
Op is asking how it works.  I think that shows interest.
---
tengu pilots are the tasty ones 
---
the mere fact that absolutely clueless morons like you can even sit in and maintain caps is the only reason you need to nerfbat them out of existence.
---
See you're not actually refuting any of the points I made you are just continuously calling me names that is the definition of an ad hominem.
---
In any competitive event or on sporting teams if one member cheats and Leadership of that team knows they are cheating and doesn't do anything to stop it then the team suffer punishment.
---
Setting up for the first time in wormholes if you're new can be a bit of a crapshoot. Start with a smaller structure and if at all possible drop it during AU TZ. Two hours before the timer, log on roll all connections and hope no one rolls into you.  If you're new to wormholes consider joining a more established corp for a little while to learn the ropes. Once you know what you're doing and branch out on your own, your old corp might even help you set up. If you're just a small group, consider talking to or hiring one of the nicer c4 corps to help you with hole control. Some C4 groups don't mind helping new to wormhole corps get established. 
---
Same, also in Texas, also interested in said shindigs

Thats not what my experience and ccp say.. But I dont have proof of the contrary. 
---
Im 80% sure the k space side opens after 4h regardless of warp to or anything. They changed it this way because there is a lot of systems that basically become inaccessible because no one lives in them to initiate that warp. 
---
But I could be wrong I dont have the dev blog on hand.

---
For t2 you can go dirt cheap and for t3 you can go pretty damn cheap, even t4s you can do in numerous ships around 1b, it’s t5s you have to go bling.
---
Yeah I guess you could try cruising through wormholes to other areas but can be harder?
---
I’m not sure about brave but I did it in eso, always people to follow around and I figure if you went to eso and asked around near d-p someone would be fine with it.
---
You might be right on that count, hard to know really. I guess the kind of people who want free vni kills are the same type of people dropping supers on everything so you’re probably right.
---
how the fuck does a bug like this exist then lol, I figured it was wormhole only cos fuck wormholes
---
nc took all the moons from init like twice? i dont know what 3rd deployment you are referring to.
---
Can't let the price crash if there's no demand

Tbh its not the goon linemembers that are having this issue, its the leadership.
---
They showed an example station interior with various assets: corp/alliance banners hanging from the walls, variable lighting based on the status of the structure (full power/low power/under attack), adverts for things like Quafe. It also showcased a holographic interface for things like the agency that can be used while docked (apparently they're expanding on that, indication appeared to be a replacement for the neocom menu items entirely, or at least for the most commonly used elements, just the agency was what they used to display the intented outcome).
---
It was very 'rough concept sketch' but looked polished enough to be conceivably at or near ready for release stage.
---
Because CCP. It also let's you see cloaky ships.
---
That's an admirable attitude. All I'm saying is there is some creative thinking that people have forgotten about how to use capitals because they didn't have to - they're crazy strong, so the only decision is really when to drop them.
---
Alliance banners hanging in the corners 
---
for reference for anyone interested, it was actually a question brought up during the AMA with Hellmar and here is what he had to say on the matter: [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/533452496987750400/560972566395879424/Hellmar\_reply\_on\_plex\_promos.JPG?width=581&amp;height=677](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/533452496987750400/560972566395879424/Hellmar_reply_on_plex_promos.JPG?width=581&amp;height=677)
---
TWO THIN COATS
---
That's kinda the point. You can't buy them unless you're outrageously loaded. So why bother letting people set the price that high? It's like someone breaking your $5 toy and you sue them for $100mil in emotional damages or whatever. There's no reason you should be able to set 100bil ISK KR for someone popping a 10k shuttle.
---
Like I said, you'd have to be rich as balls, and dumb enough to click on it.
---
I'm talking about making Killrights more useful, by getting the victim reimbursed for their loss, without making them stupid like they are now, by letting scammers gank their Alt's shuttle and then set a ridiculous price.
---
Fucking c4 brain. Hopefully you get outlawed by a massive blob

I'll go notify Judge Sarn

This is the most underrated comment of the week.
---
"A fool and his money are soon parted."
---
If you have 10bil in your wallet and are so dumb that you accidentally buy a kill right for that much you deserve it.
---
What exactly did they change? currently training for a carrier, but maybe i'll reconsider now...
---
All i saw was a slight nerf to fighter tracking?
---
To be fair, it could also be two or even all three of those reasons.
---
Buy a semi-auto assault cruiser, I've got CNC milling equipment at work, we'll retrofit that bitch.

You are so smart and so right. I will start right away and explore all systems in Eve and after a 9 year journey like Katia Sae, I might even find it ... 
---
more like HE IS BAD POSTING
---
Texan checking in!
---
I agree. But at the same time, why do you possibly need to set the KR so high, except to scam someone.
---
Think about an actual combat encounter, not a Gank scam. Someone is out mining or ratting or running missions. And someone else sneaks up and pops them. The victim wants payback, both literally (so they can buy a replacement ship) and figuratively (wanting the aggressor to die too). So they set a price on the aggressor's head. It should be enough to buy a new ship, but not so high that nobody in their right mind could/would pay it.
---
So like I said, limiting it to the Killright value of the ship they lost, means they can get their wreck paid for. But it will stop people from tacking on 100 bil worth of "pain and suffering".
---
no u
---
That's not fatbee :grabstitan:
---
lmao you're next sinner
---
The POS fight went about as well as we thought, we knew we were in for a hard time and didn't have any expectations other than a blaze of glory. We aren't completely discouraged and while we didn't enjoy eating shit and losing several billion of assets it's a learning experience for us. As for anything diplomatically related that would have to be something to talk to Sir Bastien for as I'm just the guy that stood up and took charge for what I could.
---
Option 3. 
---
Fuck this traitor.  NC doing our job for us, killing illegally sold titans. Now they can go dock back up.

Call of duty is for gays.

New feature, testing something for interceptors so they can actually intercept

What % of jita buy do you take it at? I’m interested in selling everything all over to you. High and lowsec at discounted rates. 
---
virgins? on /r/eve? never
---
As an alpha, your options here are going to be very limited. You're competing against people who aren't trying to make a profit at all, and against people who are content to make profit *at scale*, which you cannot do. Look for an overlooked niche, and look for a place where your personal expertise will give you an advantage. This could be an uncommon module (or part!), or it could be an area of space where you get to know the locals and get to know their doctrines. If you build local so they don't have to haul from Jita, you can probably charge a small premium.

I've been doing wormhole stuff in a nestor. It's pretty fun and profitable but suitable holes rarely open up.

Last time me or my brother tried to go anywhere near any of the other blue territories people were boiling over threatening to call diplo angry at us so we left and I stay only in catch. I don't want to step on anyone's toes so i just went to a space where there was no one and have been struggling to get ADMs up.

I want a drifter line of ships.

Lol would be cool like in elite dangerous 
---

---
What kind of stuff can I do nowadays, particularly with a free account? I have two ancient accounts (last active in early 2013, and by then was just doing skill queueing and logging out rather than actively play), and was pleasantly surprised a few days ago when I was able to get my one account switched over from my old uni email I no longer have access to thanks to ccp support, and then the pleasantry continued as I realized I could log on and spin my ships (then realized I couldn't start on skills again, both characters are around 40mil SP).
---
So yeah, not really interested in getting back into the corp life, but I'd love to use my second monitor for eve while messing about with other stuff, using what ships the game allows me to as a free player while I contemplate going premium again.
---
Ratting mining, cool... Last thing I was doing before I  got out were Incursions, when thwy were the big ISK maker for a cowardly highsec-er, to date myself. Those still a thing, and can a free to play player (as I would be) be able to fleet up in public and be productive dps or logi?
---
Or perhaps there's new and exciting exploration things I could do?
---
First things first though, I think I'm gonna just do a new account just to rerun the tutorials and stuff... Wouldn't be going premium with it, so don't waste your invite links on me, sorry.
---
I AM PREPARED TO LAY MY LIFE ON THE LINE FOR MY FELLOW TEXAS BRETHREN
---
This is all a ruse. HunterRoy likes to keep fellow Texans in his basement.
---
My corp recently had an influx a few newer characters. I've been have a good time using my Rorq and Carrier to move items/ships, do group mining ops, ratting and looting sights they normally wouldn't be able to do at their skill level and what I would normally just do solo without breaking a sweat. 
---
With these changes, I will be doing more things like this. I think this is l more how CCP intends it to be ( especially in regards to the Rorq changes) and I plan on doing it like that :)
---
&gt;I agree. But at the same time, why do you possibly need to set the KR so high, except to scam someone.
---
Scamming is a legitimate path to take in eve. This mechanic is functioning exactly as intended. Kill rights for their intended functions are relatively cheap and ones for scams are for billions. Pay attention to what you click on.
---
heh its on april 20th

---
It's the only true alliance in Eve. You can move from north to south, from west to east, you will still leave "Never not shitpost."
---
I use my machariel for level 4 missions
---
Why does it have to be that extreme? Certainly there are some ships that remain in the fleet/solo meta a lot longer than others, but it is much easier to tweak them and release them to people where they able to fly them easily without necessitating farming up standings.
---
The concept of farming standings works really well unless you consider
---
* A) Anyone in nullsec will basically no longer use certain chars to go ratting in those sites; if you live in Angel space and the Mach is the preferred ship of choice for nullsec BS doctrine, good fucking luck making money on that char if you are a single-account person. The same applies to a lot of other instances: it essentially kicks you out of making money in your home territory so you can stay relevant. You might even see people develop multiple combat chars *PURELY* to fly certain faction shiptypes so they can adapt quicker which I'm sure CCP would love because more chars + accounts = $$$
---
* B) Farming standings can only be done in a limited manner for some factions. Blood Raiders only have a half a dozen or so level 4 agents crammed into a small patch of space in Delve, with Serpentis and Mordus Legion in a similar way. Essentially you are region-locking certain ships because standing gain is hinged on running missions. This would require a huge overhaul in how standings are gained/managed, potentially throwing game economy out of the window because 90% of pirate and faction ship price values are tied into their LP rates. Only with Blood Raiders have we seen the market collapse around their prices, and that is mostly because 40k characters have been squeezed into a single region for 2ish years.
---
* C) It means either you will nerf these faction ships very much so unless you can figure out a way to manage it. Too much bonus being tied to standing will invalidate any t1 doctrine. Too little and it will not be considered worth it (why even have the mechanic at that stage?) This also means that managing the tweaking of stats and so on for these ships will be much more difficult as now you have to factor in another variable when doing so. Even if you tie these to nominal "small gang or solo pvp" bonuses, this does not always work: the Gila drone HP bonus has made it one of the most viable PvE and PvP platforms in almost all areas of Eve. The neut pressure that Bhaalgorns have has been seen to have massive fleet applications, especially with the hulls maybe ~20% higher than a t1 Geddon. 
---
From the sounds of this it's just a trigger that needs to be tweaked (assuming there's no other issues)
---
Putting bumpstock on Rifter right now!
---
I literally just posted in our corp Slack that when I try and log in the client goes black and the resource loading seems to be failing. 
---
Also my cat attacked my keyboard (not reported to corp)
---
like cloaky camping and blops is some kind of new secret
---
Definitely need that neon toilet to go with it. 
---
Most importantly, warp while cloaked or not show up on D-Scan, either works
---
In-game though of course.
---
Download more RAM
---
yeah it goes to black for a lot longer then usual but sometimes it actually loads but now i just keep getting the connection lost
---
its not my computer... everything else is fine and I wast have this problem yesterday

my god the real beavis and butthead they are real.

---
Or why not just use damps instead ? you can bring someones targeting range to single digits % of their original from 100+ km essentially achieving almost the same thing as old ECM unless they all butthug each other, which they can't do while moving, and if they do it while standing still, hehe
---
Kilt and bagpipped
---
he isn't asking how it works, at all.
---
he's asking how to get low effort kills. which is fine, the answer is learn how the tool works, the thing he is showing 0 interest in doing.
---
So I assume FiberX is Hyde, though I don't really know how it can be said that awful abortion of a log paste is credible, who is Anure and how are these TNT guys connected with NSH? Maybe it's going over my head but it's kind of garbled and I'm not exactly sure what you're saying.
---
Put a PVP character in the alliance you're hunting, awox krabs. After you get kicked, goo all the SP and inject another character.
---
Even better: I could see my cloaky alt as a bracket and in the overview, but not decloak him in proximity. The cloaky could also lock my main sitting on zero on him but not the other way around.
---
Something, something POS code..
---
Why not just add Trig fighters that ramp up damage over time and make their ship bonus something "normal".
---
I wouldn't even join INIT for 75k dollars.
---
I like it. 
---
The killright scam is fine, because you have to be dumb and rich, and deserve what you get for clicking without reading. However, the sheer volume of bait ships is annoying at times (on occasion recently I've clocked it breaking 20% of players in system being killright scam bait, which is...yeah). Having a swarm of empty ships clogging up on undock from trade hubs or on gates at those systems hoping for a payout is just as annoying as the mobile depot spam in those areas. 
---
Maybe soften it to double the value of the destroyed ship? That'd allow for the scam to remain viable, but only if the scanner uses a decent enough ship to farm the killright, as well as offering 'trauma compensation' in addition to reimbursement of loss to the victim where the killright is gained legitimately &amp; subsequently used.
---
All we need is lever action .44 munnins.

# 60 Times Florida Man Did Something So Crazy We Had To Read The Headings Twice
---
**Funny**
---
Florida is undoubtedly the most curious, wackiest and unusual state in the US, inhabited by the weirdest people ever. And no wonder, as the local Floridians have to deal with alligators, venomous snakes, seasonless climate, mosquitos and such high humidity that leaves you all wet in a second on a hot one, every day. Also, bona fide Florida state inhabitants have an old tradition of living for today, no matter the dire consequences. We are not only talking about those people who chose to live in the Everglades, as Miami Floridians are also quite kooky. And if the dire consequences do happen, it is a law to make every arrest public information, thus putting every deed of these crazy people on the spotlight.
---
There are tons of unbelievable headlines out there about situations that have bewildered everyone, and while there are many different individuals involved in these stories, Florida Man always takes the cake with some of the most mind-boggling examples. Thanks to a Twitter account named Florida Man that gathers "Real-life stories of the world's worst superheroes" we can share these stories of funny people with you and it's truly amazing.

A K162 will only spawn once the static has warp initiated to it AND the timer has ticked down OR someone jumped the hole. This means that if no one warps to a freshly rolled static it will last a long time. Ive seen them last several days sometimes. This has been circumvented by combat scanning drifters who can warp to unspawned K162's, leading you to a wormhole with no sig, which will only spawn the sig when you return as per the rules above.

I'm just curious as to who wrote this for Hunter, he definitely doesn't speak this well
---
&gt;inflation isn't causing Plex prices to rise
---
So, the devaluation of a currency isn't the reason purchasing an item requires more currency...
---
🤔🤔🤔
---
I did not need to see that.
---
What else are the Goonies gonna do with their caps but sell them... and who else is gonna buy hordes of them? :P
---
Nothing to see here, really.

ok retard

Cause they're shit.

Just public contract it at like 70% jita buy for null and 90% in lowsec.
---
I just recently did this to liquidate the shot I never use and people will 100% buy them no matter where they are located
---
You can't even recognize when someone compliments you.  You definitely didn't write this.

You can always inject more plex into the game by buying it. It isn’t directly tied to eves economy. It’s not a resource that’s farmed in eve. Some rich person can buy millions worth of plex and cause the price to tank. There are a lot of factors in play like the reason most ships are the cheapest they’ve ever been even though the currency is devalued you’d expect prices of ships to go up. But at the same time there’s a metric fuckton of ore being generated.

I would like to get those free sp this weekend but since i'm on a ship i have very limited data (500mb/week). Does anyone have any tips how i can login without the launcher automatically downloading many mbs of updates etc. Or how to get the sp/login with as little data usage as possible. Thanks!
---
When I left battleship hulls where just over break even for insurance. Now they cost slot more. So ISK is worth less

To be clear, you want to farm semi-AFK and have no desire to interact with other players?

It's not quite universal. In broad strokes: 
---
The highseccers hate them because they believe highsec is supposed to be a safe zone for newbies, especially the ten-year-old sort, and they resent having to pay attention to their surroundings.
---
The nullseccers hate them because they make it inconvenient to visit the trade hubs, and because recruits who join before leaving highsec get hazed by them. 
---
The lowseccers and wormholers look down their nose at them because they feel highsec is a beginner zone and it offends their sense of e.bushido that anyone would deign to fight there.
---
I don't mind them. They're akin to a force of nature. In the recruiting pool that is highsec, wardeccers are the chlorine.
---
Yo. Amok. Is literally gate camping horde and having a good time. Lol. 
---
The person with the kill right determines what they are willing to except in order to lose their right to kill the target at a later time. It you don't like it don't buy that kill right.
---
Weird, as long as you don’t scan or rat or mine nobody can say shit.
---
Wormholes are a blast just gotta pump that dscan
---
No because that's not the only way you can kill right scam. When I was a poor noon I use to make characters and have them sit on a ls gate or station and eventually someone would pop me. I also gave my Corp eyes on people entering or system. 
---
I would then sell their kill rights for 10m and make 40-50m some weeks which is a lot for a new player.
---
Except that there's a shit ton of Plex in-game. Some rich person could tank the price, but the likelihood of that is right next to Goons and Panfam teaming up to dominate J-space.
---
At the end of the day, Plex prices were always tied to a certain amount of work being done - something on the order of 40-50 hours of play. By drastically increasing the ease of generating ISK (and rate of accumulation), that work has been devalued.
---
The fact that everything produced from minerals is even cheaper is a sign of the Rorq mineral-glut problem - items whose prices aren't tied to the mineral index (basically, certain drops, PI, exploration loot) have actually increased in price. Intact armor plates alone have gone from 5M a pop to ~8M, or a 60% price increase in the last year...
---
Depends if they decide to stay bottled up in the region or try to make a splash out and about now that they have a "safer isk hole". I am hoping for the first.
---
I agree that PLEX should be protected vs. manipulation. Many entities have times over the money to buy all PLEX, sell for double.
---
I argued before that PLEX vault shouldn't accept more than 1000 PLEX if it's coming from the ingame market.
---
Yours seems like a neater solution. Once someone buys PLEX from the ingame market, the game can bar them from selling it on the market again (so they only can use it for sub or other purchases from NES).
---
This means that people stops using PLEX as an investment instrument. But this activity itself is of no value to the overall quality of the game and health of the ecosystem anyway, so we shouldn't care about those people's revenue stream.
---
Are non-salty Carebears welcome?
---
I never said you were still in Winterco. I was making a comment about their bots in general to a former member lol. Nice try though

It is amazing the ideas these people come up with trying to “fix” plex. Like if you don’t like the prices don’t buy it. Or buy some with real money. It’s not a sin to buy plex.

Eve is a very niche game. It has a harsh learning curve, the sandbox aspect is truly a sandbox, and the developers will pretty much let you get away with anything you want as long as it isn't game breaking or against the EULA. Sure there is drama about what we all would like to be better or what decisions we would make differently as a developer (everyone has opinions right?) But at the end of the day this is the sandbox that all of the people playing this game dream of. Eve doesn't have a huge playerbase, but the playerbase it has is pretty loyal.
---
If you decide to play Eve, you need to understand that this game and it's players will chew you up and spit you out if you let them, we have all been there and it's how the game is meant to be. That being said the hard times are worth the good times in my opinion. I would try it for a month or so, if you don't like it, move on, if you do like it, stay a while and learn to die in glorious fire like the rest of us.

15 - 20 persistent tabs. The browser (Firefox) stay open until there's an update. Same with the OS (Win10) which just sleeps overnight. I've got 32GB and usually about 10-13GB of it is allocated without any games open. Of course, a lot of that is just being used as cache. I used to multibox 6 or 7 clients and the machine is about 3 1/2 years old.
---
Eve holds several Guinness world records. Has a super dedicated community and is THE best Internet spaceship game out there... Oh and it has survived 15+ years and looks better with every year that passes.
---
The devs are probably the best and most involved in the industry.

Don’t buy your way into big ships at first. Learn to love and appreciate the smaller ones.

You really can just use a faction explosive hardener. Once you get up to speed orbiting the hub, you don't take any real damage that the repper can't keep topped off. The drone switch is definitely necessary though. I think you have to abandon the praetors and drop the valks pretty quick to get decent results

Well I'm sure it's been discussed at range. But I just lost Eve and I want to know if there's anything to be aware of diving back in. I can see that I'm not able to skill train or fly my t3 dessie as an alpha account. But the real question is what can I do as a solo player or in a group that isn't too worried about me being present all the time. Is there any sort of solo play that's viable that isn't running around hisec doing stupid pve stuff?

Get yourself a ship carrier?
---
Couldn’t you just sit in the plex and let the other person shoot first? Since that way you’re technically acting in self defense 
---
If you are going hybrids and that wasn’t a typo, look into the federation navy comet. Your main problem will be range control, since you’re most likely using a meta ab/scram your opponent is going to dictate range 9 times out of 10. So, carry a refit from a blaster/rail in your cargo. If you know who is in a plex, look them up on zkill, see if they fly kite, scramkite, or brawl. If they kite, ignore them and move on, if they scramkite then go into your rail fit, and if they brawl refit into blasters. Your rigs should be a full set of transversal bulkheads either way, so don’t worry about changing them

If there were no other issues it would have been fixed already

I got back into EVE thanks to abyssal sites. They are PvE but high stakes and very accessible and can run out of Jita. 
---
For PvP, I explore and find wormholes, take a ship out to some Alliances home space, or do the abyssal PVP.
---
What do you mean "back then"? I'm talking about right now. I'm saying it didn't need to be a large group to create these killmails, just a group with balls and skills. There are only 7 Talos on the killmail, plus a brutix, a nado, and a hecate, plus some random trash.

I don't think it's a dreadnought. I think it's a battlecarrier. Or a heavy battlecarrier: a dread/carrier combo.
---
Source: the giant entropic disintegrator mounts, but also the huge drone bays next to / behind the singularity cradle, as seen here:
---
https://imgur.com/a/uvTgCug
---
Supporting speculation:
---
A. Trig ships don't seem to strictly match the roles of their empire counterparts. The Leshak is a way different beast than T1, navy, or pirate faction battleships, but also doesn't match the specializations of Marauders or Black Ops. The same goes for the Vedmak, Dreka, Kiki. The Dama probably will also fit in there somewhere with a bit of tweaking, which I expect it to eventually get, since it's pretty meh at the moment in comparison to the rest of the line. From a lore, and design perspective, I could see a Triglavian capital also not strictly matching the roles of empire capitals.
---
B. So-far Triglavian ships have simultaneously punched a bit above their weight class from the perspective of total potential DPS, but also applied to ships below their weight class better than average, with excellent default tracking. The problem is, unlike with subcaps, if you have a dreadnought punching above it's weight class with capital weapons, it completely obsoletes other dreads unless it's ludicrously expensive like pirate faction dreads, because even if it's three times as expensive as a normal dread, the bottleneck with dreadbombs is the pilot count, not the number of ships you can get a hold of. So what I expect (or maybe just hope) them to do is to have a multi-supratidal disintegrator (my guess is a triple supradital disintegrator, given the detailing on the mount from the above screenshot): a HAW weapon that fills the role of other HAW weapons as far as application (hopefully equal to or a little worse than a HAW Rev, so as to not obsolete other HAW platforms too much either) but ramps up to roughly the damage of what another dread could expect with anti-cap weapons (maybe a bit less, ideally), filling "both" roles but being a master of neither. This would hopefully come at the cost of not having any dedicated anti-capital entropic disintegrator with ludicrous spooled damage.
---
C. I wouldn't really expect the battlecarrier idea, but the bays do look fighter-sized. At the very least, we might be getting a dread with drones again, like the old Moros. Triglavian ships already play a little differently than other ships, and there's no better way to continue that trend than add a wing of fighters to micromanage along with the rest of the work of micromanaging a HAW dread.
---
IF any of this speculation is at least partially correct (or if it's not, I guess) I hope that whatever it is, it can be used to make it more risky to drop caps on subcap fleets, without being as good as Carriers or other HAW dreads for actually *dropping* onto subcaps.

- Which operating system did you install the product on?
---
- If it is a Windows system, did you look at the Event Viewer to see if there are references to error codes?
---
- If it is a Windows system, did you allow all Windows updates to run to completion and were there any warnings or errors pertaining to the Windows updates?
---
- When you restart the system with all services that launch at system startup disabled in msconfig, and then you launch the client, does the problem persist?
---
I see zero issues with the prices. There is currently more demand than there is supply, therefore the price goes up. Making it even more scarce will cause the price to go up, not down.
---
Only if I can get a ship that does more damage based on the amount of plex in my ~~cargo~~ plex vault.

Botting confirmed

But lets say i need to take break from game for X time. Best way to be sure my hard earned isk ive made stays up with inflation while im gone is to invest into plex that i can sell once im back. I dont see any other good way of "storing isk" when taking long breaks
---
You can solo roam as an alpha with a pirate faction ship, but going solo in something t1 will require you to be very good. Also, you’ll still die to a camp with a dictor, but to be fair pretty much anything solo dies to that

So no t2 as an alpha? I really would have thought PA would have made that possible and found a way to coax the whales in. I guess it's potentially for the better, guess I'll sub again in a bit.

You just strike me as one of those guys who's gonna get ganked while AFK and then ragequit. EVE is best played with 100% attention since you're never safe while undocked. Try to find an activity that captivates your full attention. Exploration outside of highsec is a good and lucrative one. MMOs are all about doing stuff with other players. Your thought of Incursions could be a good as well. The fleets are still open to the public and these days even F2P Alphas are allowed to participate.

It's the tireless debate of "is pve ever valid in an MMO", been there done that, and as a person who just doesn't care about being an asshole to people anymore (I'm not the edgy college kid I was when I last played 7 years ago), I just want to play a chill spaceship game where I can watch animated dice rolls dictate whether I win fights against AI mobs or not.

The only way I can imagine being (internally) free of creepery and tedious edgelordery is to have a smallish corp of people you know and trust. Sounds like you don't have one, alas.
---
I'm not aware of any. We try to shitcan the turds ASAP in Horde but, being an open group, they do of course cycle through, noisily popping up and burning out like supermassive cringenovas.
---
I wish I could, but I'd be most terrible at it
---
If your kids aren't old enough to handle EVE then perhaps they shouldn't.
---
Ups, downs, and losses aren't an issue. The problem is people. Well certain kinds
---
Something like that would sound like a paradise for pedophiles 
---
Your not even in the same region fam.
---
I don't know. If it's anything like the highsec diamond rats though - hoo boy do they set off alarms constantly. The highsec ones you can *mostly* ignore - I'm betting somebody thought you could do the same with these.
---
Yeah, the thought was in other games I've played, larger groups made a combined kids environment that was heavily monitored so the kids could play and die/fight, without Chester the Molester popping in and fucking up some young lives.
---
&gt; Best way to be sure my hard earned isk ive made stays up with inflation
---
That's exactly one of the reasons why PLEX is inflating. If lower PLEX prices are better for the game (this point is unclear, we need CCP data to make it clear), then PLEX inflation can be reduced by taking away people's ability to "store ISK" by investing in PLEX. That's the entire point.
---
Wonder what the standing isk count is for how much goku has killed.. :thinking:
---
All I can say is that you only need to get to the character selection screen to receive the SP. Other then that there isn't much you can do to save on data I'm afraid.
---
So keep an eye on things and steer them clear of the unsavory elements. EVE's not a total cesspit, especially the smaller corps and alliances.
---
Eve is a single server game where every player is able to contact another. Labeling a group as children is one of the worst ideas I can imagine.
---
No problem. Gl and hf. o7
---
After all the smart folks here, probably just gonna add el kiddo to my Corp. Thanks everyone!
---
Dat intro is more than fitting for EvE
---
Only place in Eve that is like that is Signal Cartel...
---
/me wraps hands around you.
---
Yes the bulge is normal.
---
No its not my gun.
---
Downvote button exists for a reason. And no ones forcing you to watch everything under new. 
---
Discouraging content/effort is the last thing this game/sub needs. If it’s bad, it’ll be downvoted. 
---
It’s almost like you guys want everyone else to quit and to be the last people playing eve with no one else to fight. 
---
When these edgelords are mouthing off in local, I always tell them to keep public channels clean from their crap, because kids are also playing this game. They never believe me.
---
So join CODE. for a family friendly experience of the game.
---
Lmfao! Kid might have a blast killing bot aspirants
---
How the hell do you guys understand this dude?
---
eve logs all the chat channels. when your kid plays, have a brief review of the log files. if you don't like what you see, find a new corp for them.
---
More worried about coms. Solo Eve is shit. The group experiance is what makes the game worth it.
---
It’s the first 4/20 I’m gonna spend sober in years and that’s the real crime here 
---
wally, this is art 
---
ah yes, that is slightly more problematic.
---
thanks for putting that in my youtube history
---
I'll settle for a pop can lightning link eagle.

Honestly. I would try out a dual web/ab Arty thrasher if I were you. Lots of fun, and can fight off kiting ships as well with proper transversal/shot timing and titanium sabot.

Agreed to get warmed up on something easy and get used to the changes, but I found abyssal was perfect for my playstyle and very profitable when you're doing it at a high level. It's really great for alphas as well.
---
That's what I would have suggested. Unless your corp includes too many perverts and edgelords.... 
---
Also rises the question why you want to "drop your kids off" instead of enjoying the game with them :)
---
What is the world coming to, NPC's doing more damage than INIT.
---
Wormhole Corp. Much sit and wait as compared to a null sec always something happening
---
It’s not a place for kids.
---
Don’t take kids into EVE. It’s not a daycare centre.
---
I’ve talked to a 12-year-old who was getting scammed. It was his first night in EVE and they had already taken him for all he was worth. I told him to put his mom on and then explained to her that this is not your average game.
---
I wouldn’t take kids to EVE, it’s not the right place.

You can play white knight like you liberated some fuckin shit but you need to just accept what you did and move on. Whsoc always tries to play moral high ground when they never have it. Just accept what you are and keep going. It's fucking pathetic to watch this squirming.

Diamond rat AI is ridiculously spooky they fly with seperate anchors and everything. Also they do a hell of a lot more damage than a solo Caracal.

But how do I buy enough PLEX to buy my extractor packs if I can't go above 1000. Wait, lower the PLEX price of extractor packs. Thanks.

Do you, by any chance, know a good lotion for that?

They are not Chinese bots. They are  Chinese repeaters，understand?

You grow with your tasks my dude. I never thought I could help leading an alliance either now I do just kinda grew into it. If you would have fun doing something like that just try it. 
---
Make them smaller.

At any rate OP's suggestion works better.

Just yesterday one of our allymates left for wh life, he said null is boring, just sitting around, compared to wh. :)

Nothing will change.

To good business.        
---
I am selfish as i prefer 100 PLEXed players instead of 1 guy with 200 account skill farm. 
---
Because i can shoot those 100 players ingame instead of this 1 guy. 
---
He means an anchored bubble, with cans and wrecks scattered around. I thought that was obvious?
---
&gt; thousands of assholes all over New Eden

---
Whoosh
---
what about bot's being plexed
---
u/tohuw, he needs upvotes and his boots need licking again, you're up 
---
Lol literally treating null corps like daycare.
---
Have your kids in your own corp and play together with them, then maybe they won't get completely lost or hurt. New Eden is a cool place to explore but you can't police everyone to be kid friendly.  However, until you don't poke someone somehow ingame (ganking, being in their null system, blobbing) they usually don't throw insults at you. I've only seen a few really harmful players during my two years, try to avoid those.
---
After downtime.
---
reading is hard
---
Someone’s obviously never played Runescape.
---
No, they're going to hand them out on Friday the 29th.
---
***AFTER DOWNTIME***
---
This is the internet. People are gonna be assholes and creeplords anywhere
---
What about the jews, do you think they re not interested?
---
what about real players ?      
---
"Those are poors that plex accounts"      
---
I don't care tbh - i play eve to hunt them and not looks at skill farms on some station.     
---
**There should be upper limit for how many PLEXed accounts player can have** and no limit on running subs.      
---
Ideally I'd make them more counterable. Maybe buff stealth bombers or some such with an eye to specifically targeting capitals. Add more risk to their deployment, make them have to be deployed with an escort, and allow people to think smarter about fleet composition rather than every battle of significance coming down to whomever can deploy n+1.
---
Hopefully the changes coming on the 9th should go a bit of a way towards achieving that goal.
---
But ganking them while they mine in high sec IS showing them love, you are stopping them from having to mine in high sec!
---
Soooo not long before they start the alts so they can do both then?
---
well, it depends how many real players and how many bots. Numbers we don't have .
---
hunting bots is kind of boring tbh , except is your goal is green KB, and it's still boring after that 
---
I feels ya, it's something about losing in Eve that brings on so much rage with a lot of people including me. Losing in any other game doesn't bother me but in Eve it does, it's weird.
---
The best thing you can do is suck it up and try again, and above all else don't give anyone any salt about it, as the Eve community seems to thrive on it.
---
Not spoken to, not involved. I don’t give a rat’s ass.
---
I have, in fact, never played Runescape.
---
Dealing with caps is easy if you’re flying a proper counter. Enemy has lots of carriers? Fit your battleships with smartbombs in utility highs. Enemy has haw dreads? Run any of the low-sig long range kitey comps that exist (ishtars,muninns,cerbs etc.)
---
   
---
Caps are only a problem to deal with if you lack the imagination to deal with them properly.
---
This is not an eve specific problem. There is no place on the internet your kids could interact with other people that avoids this problem 100% That's why its important that either you protect your kids from them directly with monitoring and intervention or that your kids can protect themselves from it through education.
---
Meh here I was wondering why last 10 serious Keepstar fight turned out to be a capital n+1 fest, or why supercap umbrellas are the best way to defend one's own space.
---
Never heard of hydeX, are they relevant ? Xhat did they do to deserve a shitpost?
---
As someone who abuses jump gates constantly: fuck jump gates
---
So... You could still do that as long as your killmail came to 5mil. Or you could do it but with lesser returns if you stuck to using an unfitted empty heron on gate.

---
Dedicated anti-capital Marauder hull. &lt;&lt;

Make it so 25-30 of the hulls T2 fitted do _terrible things_ to capital hulls. Leave Rorqs out or don't.

Heavy Interdiction Battleships. 
---
How old? I’ve been playing since about 12 (nearly 19 now)
---
It honestly shouldnt be too bad as long as theyre not too young, just get em in somewhere with a good atmosphere, e-uni maybe?
---
Hunting quad boxing smart bombers is never boring. I wish I had the skill to do it so I could make fat african titties ful of money
---
Sounds good to me. It might be a bit weird to bonus them but if they're _really_ good at killing capitals and mediocre at everything else, they might work out okay. 
---
If you don't mind, could you DM me the name of the group?
---
Meh, I started at 12, all depends on how youre raised. I got on pretty much fine, did decently in pvp, scammed a few nerds etc. Pretty much knew eve from about 8 when watching my dad play. Granted its a bad game for most younger kids but the few that are sensible with good internet knowledge etc. And a good upbringing should be fine. (18 now btw) 
---
What's going on now? I missed something 
---
F
---
Whatever anti-capital solution you implement, it needs to be viable in deep null behind enemy lines. Large tidifests do not determine Eve sov null scene at all. They just are reasons for people to dickswing. The safety of krabbing space is the bigger determinant which alliance wins Eve atm.
---
These marauders wont be able to roam in deep null under heavy umbrellas. When they do, they won't be fast enough to reach/kill stuff. You need something with a blops bridge, or low mass so you can fit thru wormholes, etc.
---
Cyno interdiction battleships, t2 leshak.
---
I'm a new player that would like to join a corp in null but after seeing all the stuff happening in null between the big boys I have some questions. How does it work when you're in an alliance that is constantly at war and you want to venture into HS. If I were to be a part of TAPI or Horde and wanted to go to Jita to buy/sell stuff, would I get blown up immediately? If that is the case, then is there a market/hub within the alliances that replaces the need to pop into HS?
---
I've been really enjoying what is happening down there between the superpowers and it's inspired me to partake on those big fights but I'm scared that my inexperience will make me an easy target when not within the "safe" space of the alliance.
---
If you are willing to resubb multiple of your alts then I recommend going into low class WHs. Something like a C2 with a C4 static should be more than sufficient to produce tons of profit (PI, ratting and gas huffing all easily scalable with multiple account)
---
How many Texan lawyers are in this fight? 
---
Hmm. 
---
Relatively low mass, prop-mod bonus of some sort, maybe a new weapon system that's good at mangling capitals. Have them use T2 Large Guns skills but the sig radius 2km or so.
---
after downtime you illiterate
---
Change it so skill extractors have a 3 month cool down per account? This would negate most of the issues at hand? 
---
Booshimora
---
&gt; Granted its a bad game for most younger kids but the few that are sensible with good internet knowledge etc.

Not every kid is the same, obviously. But you had your dad showing you the ropes because he’s a pilot himself. Not everybody is going to be that lucky.

For most 12-year-olds, EVE  is not the best place to be.

---
Lolmeca's nonsense is one thing, we got used to it, but please do not try to get (down) on his level. Like how would escort requirement solve the n+1 problem rather than making it even more severe?
---
Few months ago someone made a post about the problem being the proliferation of capital vessels -namely carriers- and he got memed on by a lot of ppl. You can qq about a multi billion platform being potent and hard to counter by smaller, cheap stuff but honestly... this is just stupid (not you or the people that saying so, simply just the argument). Capital ships (solo or in smaller numbers) are fairly easy to counter with simple fleet comps if you actually plan the engagement and know how moduls and game mechanincs works.
---
Introducing injectors resulted in the profileration of capital ships resulting in monstrous cap fleets, sudden increase in the number of ratting caps and capital mining ships. 
---
I think it is safe to say that nerfing the individual hulls or player activities -to a level where their justification becomes questionable- just because they became common, is the easiest but also the wrong approach (treating the symptoms not the disease). The upcoming changes will not result in titans, carriers and rorqs becoming useless or irrelevant, but requesting changes where they become super-easy prey to even smaller subcap fleets is bullshit.
---
You’re still out top hat. Don’t get too cocky 
---
Yeah generally going to high sec when in a null corp is a bad idea as there are high sec war dec corps who prey on that. 
---
Every corp and alliance that’s any good in null will have jump freighter service to their null home for a fee per m3 of space. 
---
How good their home market is will vary by the place. 
---
Most null players will have a high sec alt out of corp. that’s the alt that does your jita shopping and contracts it to your main to be shipped. 
---
Or add in a ship class that applies damps to logi reps on a single target. 
---
Always something to do when your on it's really nice less content but when you get it the quality is better then I experienced in kspace.
---
We had friend of mine joined us from null and said it made him enjoy eve again because it's a lot more personal corpwise compared to being goon#10024. 
---
Would recommend you will be sitting around what ever space your in depending on our mindset on what you want to do. I krab once a week and after that I'm doing nothing but looking for content.

Except that it does matter, at least at the start.   But they seemed to be OK so they must have krabbed enough.
---
Triglavian carrier/dread to me would be the same beam-like mechanics, but chain to other ships in proximity of main target with reduced damage.

It's the USA we seem to bring them to school a lot.

Teach your kid how to live in the real world so when someone creepy interacts with him he knows

Multiplex ?
---
absolutely! This is not a "I don't want to lose stuff" post, this is more "a piece of history is lost" post. I lose ships all the time, but they're all ships I can (and do) build anytime I want.
---
I don't and never will own an AT ship or limited faction citadel, but I still share the sentiments of e.g. The Antiquarian in wanting to preserve Eve history.
---
It's gotta be one of those that spray water up your bum
---
I am not complaining, i do not mind being one of the crowd. There is plenty of stuff to do in null too, but as you said, it depends on your mindset. There are often neuts roaming around, asking to get shot at, anomalies that need to be scanned and if bad wh, then rolled, gates to be camped, market orders to be placed, shit to be manufactured, delivered and sold. Not mentioning alliance fleets (manageable size 20-30 ppl, not TiDi cancer nonsense) comming out of our deployment every 2 hours during my timezone. And lately we tried doing Abyssals with t1 cheap frigs in corp in groups of 3, thats fun too. 
---
My problem is often to choose what to do first. :) 
---
&gt;Except that it does matter, at least at the start.

No. No it doesnt. A raitaru is 500 mil. That's one c5 site

I disagree capitals shouldn’t be nerfed into the ground so hard that they aren’t worth using... what they need to nerf is keepstars so that the supercap spam isn’t as bad, either take away docking rights to supers or limiting the amount per region (or both)

Are sp farmers viable right now with those plex price?

i dont know either and at this point I'm too afraid to ask...

And how were you planning on implementing that? An IP ban? RIP anyone playing from IT cafes, unis, etc.. A launcher-based ban? Easily bypassable and there are several programs for this already.

CCP also gets more money per sub from plex, so I doubt they're too interested in a solution like that anyway.

That doesn’t gel with my experience of the place, but there are enough... how to say it... ‘questionable characters’ that you can’t invite kids in there. I mean: it’s not as if kids don’t have a wealth of games to play outside of New Eden.
---
Also, and this pure selfishness: I don’t want EVE to be a nursery for bored kids.
---
“Waaaa, he blew up my ship. I didn’t do anything.”

“He said something mean to me!”

In my experience PI is a very time-intensive endeavor with a lot of planning an timers to maximize profit, without nearly enough ROI.
---
If you have TONS of free time and you're just bored, fine, try PI. Don't let anyone tell you  though that it's passive income. The time you spend planning the setups, setting extraction jobs, spreadsheet-ing it out, and hauling makes it a very involved venture.

I think it depends on their age, id say eve is too mature a game for anything under a 16/17 yearold, most corps don’t want a 14 yearold in corp anyways. Most corps say min 18 years, I’ve even seen some(Americans) require 21 (for some stupid reason)
---
The krabs got ultra-cheap-fax which makes everything unkillable once they land, as well as a ship that tanks a solid fleet with a 7 minutes invulnerability window

It's not krabbing getting good, it's ccp releasing the dumbest ship in the game, combined with a dozen other dumb changes.

I'll usually offer 50-85, but it depends very heavily on the type of stuff, location and total value. If it's your old veldspar in a starter system, I can't take it at *any* price, even zero isk (asset window lag costs time! Time is money!) but stuff like caps/supers I can do a pretty generous price on most of the time.

Instead of tank bonus. Bonus to dps.

If you are interested in PvP there are a lot of groups that have really relaxed/no requirements to fly with them. For small scale PvP there is [Red vs Blue](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/red-vs-blue-join-the-forever-war-today/11658) which is a group that wardecs their other half and just dukes it out all the time. They don't care about activity, just a good attitude. They also take you regardless of omega status.
---
Similarly, [WiNGSPAN](http://www.torpedodelivery.com/) provides a fun place for people who like cloaky/wormhole hunting but don't want to have to deal with activity requirements or fleet doctrines or that stuff. However, due to base skill requirements and needing to cloak, you do need to be omega.

If you are mainly interested in PvE with a dash of PvP there are plenty of nullsec groups that will take you, or you could consider eve-university. I would suggest checking out the [recruitment forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/corporations-alliances/recruitment-center). I highly suggest not staying a solo player, eve is about the people that you play with more than anything else!

Welcome back and I hope to see you out in space!
---
I guess you should always try. It’s the EVE way. What you can keep is yours.
---
In truth, this isn’t a bunch of ignorant 6th graders. You have to be very smart to pull a caper like that and that clearly didn’t qualify.
---
It's not gone, it move to the killmail server
---
There is nothing to fix.
---
If people are willing to pay more for plex, prices will rise.
---
And 2b for a month sub is still next to nothing.
---
Hence the new triglavian shit for roaming.
---
End result though, he's got a decent bit of isk..and nobody that trusts him to use it with. Bit of a shame imo.
---
FC what is nightmare?
---
You take the good with the bad.
---
One feature of EVE I love to pieces is that your reputation clings to you. And you should own it.
---
RHML geddens are the bomb
---
Drop rates have an influence for sure, but they are far from being the most impactful factor. In fact their impact decreased massively with extinction of drone alloy loot and implementation of Rorqual mining power.
---
Costs of manufacturing are an own market for itself since engineering complexes.
---
Also I am not sure why you think drop rates (aka conversion rates of RL resource grinding) and costs of manufacturing have no role in the real economy ?
---
better than your retard degree.
---
Origin corp kitchen sink fleet has killed a rorqs, in a system, juggling 7 minute panic timers, resulting in keyboard face rolls.
---
Im gonna need you to kill atleast 1 rorqs that have t2 indy core and can panic. To qualify for posting permission.

just got another one! ahh its so pretty. ty again  for the videos nick

You know Wally every single post of yours I see I am asking myself if this is the worst shitpost of r/eve or if it is art. 
---
Keep making the birddies wet.
---
No.
---
What are we going to do? The same thing we do every night, remember the Alamo! 
---
Glad you enjoyed it
---
Muninn is the word for "rethinking something" ... not sure that matches Texans ...
---
Let's face it skill extractors/injectors only exist so CCP can somehow claim that you "can't buy SP out of nowhere". 
---
Which is however exactly what is happening because the SP farm is a trivial middleman in the chain that transforms dollars into injectors. 
---
 $ -&gt; plex -&gt; SP farm -&gt; extractor -&gt; injector 
---
it's a mare, but during the night
---
I mean, wouldnt you say its a valid comparison?
---
No, that's bullshit.
---
I didn't know. How much did it change?
---
you are wrong.
---
I hear Tishu is very child friendly and forms a great ideological basis for those future voters.
---
Jeezz! That what yer dreaming of shitbag? lol
---
Hm, try get in contact with Blades of Grass, if they re still alive? Back then they had very strict comms- and chatrulesets to keep stuff PEGI13. Also I remember them as friendly, though very buerocratic dudes/dudettes.
---
Implying Guns in Texas come unloaded?
---
Fuck that dude. I've never seen such salt in my life. All over some mining tax BS

That day when Gitzu s been trolling so hard assorted coalition-mates wanna awox him :D

what are you even talking about bruh. what special treatment i was just asking to help stop 
---
Having the option of flying leshaks and drekavacs doesn't make capitals any less OP.

tbh you've lost over a titan's worth of black ops alone

also you're memory is fucked if that's what you remember - or you're lying about being there (wouldn't be the first time)

fly safe my brain fried EVE compadre

if l had 3 SP farm a 3 month cd would just make me get 6 more accounts to cover the cd, but thats me 
---
As someone who doesn't really know what is happening, I am going to claim responsibility and conclude he deleted his reddit account because he was getting meme'ed and said "fuck this, nobody is taking my contract seriously"
---
I just imagined lil girl and her brother doing their family-spaceship-things and gettin sperged at by some wanna-be-edgelord. All of a sudden Cyno opens, Super named "Baby on board" drops in and flips the table. "LEAVE MUH KIDS ALONE!" :D
---
i mean it's weird anyways lore-wise 
---
Yeah, it's one of the reasons I won't ever sell my toon or use someone else's. Reputation and history is a thing in EVE.
---
More like he's being called out on his shit and people are probably spamming/trolling him about it.
---
pm sent if you still want one
---
You mean the trig shit that still needs 40 dps to break a rorqs tank and lmao still invuln for seven minutes while fax you still can't break and a dozen titans land XDDD JUST FLY TRIG SHIT IDIOTS

Thanks for your opinion miner.

Triglavian Semiosis Data Vault (AFN)  wts if u still want them

ok, keepstars that are defended.

Too late, already claimed his emoquit

Inbefore someone ragelocks and toasts you on your bought toon shouting "This is for that tattoo-story in Daytona!" and you have no clue... :D

I guess I should have mentioned, I forgot about my sec status and went autopilot.  Never pointed that I know of, just came back to a pod.

I have blueprints for some old POS stuff, it would be a shame if something happened to those.....

Need moah gunz at schools, cause of teh evil ppl with gunz there. \*nods wisely\*

Lol. Yeah I'll play safe and stick to my toons.

the intro.

mad it worth watching the rest of the video tbh
---
at this speed we will get triglavian caps before angel's :(
---
The very reason the undefended keepstars were undefended is the capital n+1 fest I talked about.

Im crtitical deviant subject. Can i join you? Im HomoDendroNekroZoofill

---
they are hopeless, nothing new
---
tri keepstar for example died becasue we were evacing insmother.
---
not because of the n+1 capital meta, we couldn't even defend ourself vs their subcap fleets.
---
let me tell you about my 3k hp/s passive regen rattlesnake
---
imagine beeing so stupid to shitpost on reddit and being unable to understand simple written text at all
---
bs abyssals will be crap
---
At ships are easy to check. There are 50 of each made and you can the seperate catagory on zkill to see howmany have been killed of each. Other limited editions are not really possible to know since they were often given out without public knowledge until later. 
---
Who was this, HydeX?

Blue is only a colour &lt;3

Yeah it's where I noticed, I wanted to go see if he'd replied anywhere and notcied he'd deleted his account. Guess he realized he oopsie'd.

AAR:
---
Test wanted to do some SOV stuff for content, FRT decided that ask and thou shall receive.
---
FRT arrives on grid with a Eagle fleet against a TEST munnin fleet. FRT starts administrating TEST patients with doses of artillery shells.
---
Test decided they no longer want to be part of content and decide they need to leave as they all remembered they collectively left their ovens on when they left the house.
---
FRT catches them in another system for a few more doses of artillery shells. For comedic purposes FRT also does a "beekaboo" to progod.
---
I like to pew pew. Does that count? 
---
We have an eastern front???
---
Have your kids mine for you!
---
Converting my barrels of oil into plex now
---
Doesn't matter dude.
---
The people who have n+1 superiority have so much superiority that they don't even bother killing Keepstars anymore to not turn this server into Serenity. Think about how much n+1 they have.
---
If in Eve 2019 someone says that "what matters for meta the most isn't capital n+1 and all you need to beat capital n+1 is imagination with subcaps" it's most likely just a clueless humble brag about an irrelevant fight they had 60 subcaps defanging 4 supers. Good luck beating that 750 man super/titan fleet with your 3000 man subcap fleet.

No need to cling on one sentence (which is still true btw).

Go to a coffee shop or some other place to download the files then log in at home. If you have a desktop, use a public computer to save them to a flash drive then copy them to your desktop at home.

If everythings gotta die, thats one hell of a way to go.
---
here... ehh. at least nc undocked
---
Interesting. I just checked this thread for new commentary :) nice to meet a girl like you here.
---
But actually I do agree, personally I think a coalition that anyone can join is fairly noble.  Of course i'm an ewil piwat, so don't quote me too regularly on this.
---
Brav I lost control of the only system I regard as a real system. Okkamon. 
---
The church of awesome used to patrol there and with the fine pirate named lanes, we used to smash the rakka puss puss left right and center.
---
Then Laney and the boys left, and I was left to defend it. Russian and the Chinese are having a good ole fashioned block war over okkamon.
---
But one day.. mark my words this alpha male is coming back with a force soooo strong.. the Chinese and the Russians will
---
Be bowing down to the okkamon pirate.:
---
PS.. FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK SNUUUUUUUF
---
It's nice to know that plex may stay super high or even reach a new high by the time i get paid and can cash in on this price rise.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what that means either 
---
Well make sure you don't do it anyway. Its naughty
---
Shaddup ya cunt
---
Hellhound drones.
---
Poor TNT. Consequences will never be the same! 
---
rip what's left of the plex market as the skill farms jump on this deal.
---
Funny is this that i already replied to this post just after you posted it - but for some reason - exactly the same post is not visible here.     
---
I guess someone didn't want me to remind people to observe the system ;)
---
I'm a bit more curious regarding the AT battleships, only ones I know of are Bluemelon's (rip) State Raven and Chribba's Tribal Tempest. 
---
Yup.
---
That’s why injectors were kind of a bad thing for the game, you can extract and or inject into a brand new identity, with a shiny super to boot. 
---
I agree with what you are saying but the dama for me is special. Took me 5 hours to make a fit for low sec but I can take on curtain t2 frigs with ease.
---
I have had no experience with the other ships because I’m having too much fun with the dama but I will need to move on and experience the bigger ships sooner or later
---
Just stop selling extractors in the store and start selling injectors
---
I need to look into this. I think it should look up the last 3 months if your wallet data is empty in Evanova, but I might have missed something. Otherwise, yes, it's only getting transactions from the last one.
---
And we have optimized our camouflage technics to a top dank level ;

Fuck you ccp (plexed yesterday)
---
Let's watch Jita 4-4 getting burnt with plex :)
---
&gt;CCP also gets more money per sub from plex                   
---
I think you are missing important part in here.        
---
CCP is selling a product. This product is a MMO where you can do "stuff" with other people.                  
---
While we are players, we are also customers.            
---
My customer opinion is very simple.          
---
**Dear CCP i feel that product you are offering for quite a while is losing in value. This is mostly due to fact that my ability to interact with other customers is reduced due to poor introduction of new functionality that is driving off small customers in favor of big players. While it can be good for your short term bottom line it makes your product less and less appealing to customers every day. Please fix**          
---
Now look at this from this perspective.           
---
If you could have 100 players running 1 account vs 1 player running 200 account what is more healthy?           
---
For sure this 1 guy is making you a decent income at much lower costs ... but if from each group 1 player leaves ... in first case you still have 99 paying customers on one side ... while you are totally fucked from another.

interbus shuttle
---
Bonus points if all modules on the heron are bricked abyssal mods!
---
nice, wanna make some talisman sins and full dps leshaks now :)
---
Haha that was a savage burn, id give you a medal for that one, holy shit
---
Do civilian media shuttles still exist?
---
May I please have a kitten?
---
Abyss is not an ISK sink. It‘s a sink for shiny ships and shiny modules.
---
Why not write a support ticket (worked for a friend before :))
---
Holy fucking shit. That looks like some guuuuud fites. 
---
You are missing the point.      
---
It is not about extractors - but fact that PLEX is raising in price over it.      
---
I have Plexed alts and subbed account also - i don't have many, but i can throw in 10+ accounts that have 3 chars that are over 5mil sp each.               
---
It is not about those "poor" players that PLEX one account (well kind of) it is about players like me - that play this game to SHOOT PEOPLE and for us number of active players (not accounts) is most important factor.            
---
TBH i don't care how much PLEX costs as long as those small people can afford it normally so i can shoot them.         
---
So from my perspective **Fuck huge skill farms** those alts will never undock or do it one per month without providing any real value to the game.          
---
Oh no a fun ship! Better nerf it!
---
No
---
Inb4 some mental gymnastics about people having to buy another ship and taxes, ignoring insurance payouts
---
You didn't answer the question. Like, at all.

he never said that? it's clear as day tho that eve is a pay 2 win game the day they introduced PLEX
---
Diamond rats are assholes!
---
You can petition a GM and ask for the number of remaining ships of X type. 
---
The biggest issue is there is no large content so everyone will pile on to this to increase their fun per hour. Either this causes large escalations with many many fights as parties join sides or tissue and lotion prices sore as people try to relieve blue balls.
---
Hold my beer while I petition all my previous purchases in the past years for 500 plex each for a discount.
---
Simple policy. 
---
You cannot have more than 10 plexed accounts.    
---
People trying to abuse the system will be banned.          
---
How to check it - CCP already know account linked to your email address. 
---
If you run 50 accounts ... CCP can trace this easily by checking connections.          
---
Even more introducing a script that allows to cross check with database what is happening and what is the status when you try to use plex.  
---
Vin-d-CATION
---
the game might be broken, the subreddit is not.
---
Imagine being extensively tested and trained for years on end and put through deadly trials so you could prove you were thr top 1% of the 1% just so you could sit in some goo and whack off in space
---
hahahah +1
---
What can I say. NSH and NC. Shit posters come from a time of WWB. We were molded by it. We lived on reddit shitting it up. Hyde tried and failed because he took himself too seriously. 
---
People/botters already abuse the hell out of alphas and CCP doesn't seem to be doing a great job detecting those. I wouldn't get my hopes up...
---
My god , what the fuck happened . Tell me there is video
---
Good deal, been sitting on some plex for a while.
---
i dont' HAVE to imagine it, I'm simulating it right now
---
people are still playing this game? sunk cost fallacy is strong yo

I don't think anyone can go 1 vs 1 with Goons atm. Legacy vs Imperium would be pretty onesided too i'm afraid.

There's really only 2 sides atm. If they don't go to war or thay fall apart, nothing big is gonna happen.

Well if someone want to abuse it will always find a way - but in case all abuses moment they are detected results in a ban.        
---
You throw all kinds of shit to proposals to nerf capitals yet you can't cite a single solution to stuff you call "real problems", because there is none. Injectors, proliferation and macroeconomic issues won't change. The approach you call "easy but wrong" is the only approach. 
---
Your "multi billions" are chum change now. So ships costing that much should be nerfed to be as ordinary as their price. Once sp and isk stops being a balancing factor no justification remains on why capitals have the extraordinary stats and abilities that they have.
---
wtf are you walking about? i just want to roam nullsec with my drunken boys again like 2012... no politics or backstabbing, wtf are you smoking?
---
That's a lot lower odds than they're used to flying dude. If it ain't 10:1 or more they're the underdogs

Already at 4.5m

Gotta love the dumbasses who sold at the first sign of a downward trend last week.

/u/Olmeca_Gold
---
like you predicted :)
---
They are just setting up the market for a nice Plex sale in a month.
---
You didn't deal with the politics as a roamer what the fuck i never said that where the fuck are you people getting this from?
---
The politics and backstabbing happened in between the groups that owned the regions your roamed in. As a result of them bickering all the time they never allied up and formed a mega alliances like we have today. So once you moved out of one small section into another people were no longer aware of you and very few people wanted to band together to fight you.
---
Ugh more titan groping?
---
most player aren't affected by this because the people doing that playstyle left years ago because of said mechanics.
---
but have fun grinding resources uninterrupted for the remainder of eve's server life.
---
Nice multiboxing.
---
Sp farms have been immensely urn-profitable even with 3 fully optimised and implanted chars for quite some time.
---
And with plex prices like this it's likely to stay that way
---
At least /u/Olmeca_Gold had some human decency to not be a sore winner, i can respect him for that unlike yourself.
---
can't those people just go back to farmville and leave my eve alone?
---
... the carebears have won years ago :( fuck CCP

Dude lay off those pain killers

Wew lad

AAR?

Cheeerzah

BR?
---
so much this +1 +1 +1
---
I want this just so that the word Trigmatar can exist
---
Aye, I’m still going the classic way. I have not touched an injector, I’m at 178 mil sp.
---
Ok, so CCP either intentionally causes this price spike, or they’re at least glad that it happened and are making it worse 
---
Your feelings about multiboxers don't matter though. Injectors are a thing and won't change. By all means let's hate skill farms, but if we realistically wanna talk about what we can do about the situation the first thing to balance is capitals.
---
Ps: demand does increase Plex prices but so does other factors like manipulation and investment. If you want cheaper Plex CCP can achieve that by barring people from using Plex as an investment tool.
---
To be fair HydeX failed because he tried to start a petrol fire, but doused and lit himself on fire in the process. 
---
This only played out the way any sensible self immolation plays out - charred to crispy perfection.
---
That's not what he referred to. 
---
Christ who cares about capitals?      
---
Capitals are here, they are big ships, goal for many players.    
---
If you want to fly frigates - play in FW       
---
If you want to be part of huge battles with capitals - play in SOV         
---
Capitals are the ships people dump all that farmed sp into.
---
Holy crap, well played mate. 
---
What CCP should do is remove Skill Injectors from the hands of players (i.e. skill farming) and just sell them from NPCs in Trade Hubs and set the sell prices based on the average plex prices based on the current skill farming formula. It would solve the problem of plex scarcity/inflation and also provide a massive ISK sink. They could keep the Skill Extractors around, also purchasable via ISK but only for reshuffling SP around on the same toon or account instead of creating a Skill Injector. People could still reroll new accounts and inject them up to their gills, they just wouldn't be able to wash spy/bot toons and keep their ISK.
---
Posted shitty pictures of skinned eve ships on reddit. 
---
I alt tabbed to every single client and manually clenched each one within one server tick, no ban pls
---
Ultimately you'll need to be the guiding hand for anyone you bring into the game, and this applies doubly so to your children. Beyond normal online safety stuff, youll have to teach her how to not get scammed, how to pilot, and who to trust or distrust. That doubles the normal amount of parenting work for something of this caliber. 
---
If you are able, it would be best to form a small corp with her, and fly as a duo for a while. That way, you know whats happening, and youre not leaving her to learn as Line Member #2433. Plus, it'll probably be more fun to fly as a family.

---
how many dudes are going to jump on that, when there is a weekend that gives you and extra week of training on top?
---
wp, nice trick to get the amount of subbed accounts up ccp
---
i wonder how many they need for the bonus on that black abyss sale.
---
g*d bless
---
I firmly believe the get the "death of a ship" message quite regularly. At first I was kinda against the new wardec mechanics but I now start to love them.
---
shut up idiot lmbo
---
You can’t protect them forever. Teach them about edgelords and pedos and all that shit. Arm them with knowledge and wisdom and they will learn to take care of themselves. 
---
Have them join your corp so you can do stuff together and everyone in your corp will know these are your kids in RL and help keep an eye on them.
---
lol they were probably scared of the cap response that inevitably gets thrown.
---
Rip poors
---
I'm guessing they're testing to see if people actually buy more plex for real money when the ingame price spikes (which would make sense)
---
Agree here. I have often come back to EVE just to feel demotivated by not optimally training my skills, if I want to play each day instead of skilling for half a year and then maybe start playing, so I don't ruin my memory map early, because I need all those different skills to start the game.
---
I'd rather have nothing besides alpha/omega state change the skill training rate.

---
A lot of casual players or people who don't feel like dumping a lot of money on alts are being priced out of PLEXing their accounts, which is a real problem since it removes targets from space if people don't login anymore. Skill farms don't add anything to the game and are actually detrimental since they drain massive numbers of PLEX from the market that could have been used to sub accounts.
---
aaah yes like i avoid them by playing apex instead. good times :)
---
Just a word extra be careful when shooting cynos as you will get pirate flag and be shot by the station guns. A little tip if its quite a chuncky cyno align out tag it with a shot then warp back station guns will no longer shoot you.
---
So FRT is fitting artys on their eagles? 
---
 CCP: We're monitoring PLEX prices closely and are rady to step in if needed 
---
Also CCP: 30 Day Omega Sale 425 PLEX 
---
PLEX Price: New Record High in less than 2 hours

I'd love to see the pleasure hub interior come back...

Hilmar is cashing out on Monday so gotta bump these stats to healthy face real quick.

If youre complaining about hundreds of titans/supers then maybe stop playing in those fights? The post i replied to was crying about caps, which are very killable with subs. I also hate titan blobs, which is why I do this thing called using my brain and just avoid the areas/situations which escalate to those types of battles. Eve is so much more fun with a working brain.
---
AFAIK Eve was meant as a 100% free capitalistic hellscape complete with scamming and pump 'n dump market manipulation. as an anarcho-communist please leave it like this.
---
&gt; What CCP should do is 
---
my sides
---
Im down for a tracking buff however as much as I would like it nullification I feel is to much especially sincs they removed it from combat ceptors
---
To be fair to him...it does, for anything involving a blob. Which...outside of wh space, almost everything involving dreads also involves a blob.
---
Caps/supers do need significant EHP nerfs to bring their health progression into line. Compare the EHP/DPS jump and price difference between a Vexor and a Dominix, to the EHP/DPS jump and price difference between a Dominix and a Thanatos. Roughly 5x increase in fitted cost has completely different power jumps.
---
Railgun slug just didnt feel quite right
---
seddow's desicion making about ammo types and targets was awesome  /s
---
j/k, love you seddow
---
nice vid bro, without the usual shitty music, though i'd prefer the sound edits to be a bit lower volume
---
Yeah, but a one week old toon flying big ships for your alliance is not someone I'd trust.
---
Capitalist markets are heavily regulated. It's more anarchist to ask for no regulation.
---
My dad didnt show me the topes though, I watched him playing, didnt really understand much of what was going on. I just joined in with a decent group of people that taught me how to play, though granted my dad did give me little bits of advice here and there. 
---
If anyone that age wants to get into eve i recommend finding a small newbro friendly lowsec corp to fly with, you’ll learn the ropes and the idea of losing shit quickly and theres plenty of content in fw areas to keep you entertained.
---
+ 250k free SP if you sign up this weekend. CCP seriously juicing the market. 
---
Or, and hear me out, we could deliberately catch them at a ping so they can't panic instead of giving our enemy 7 minutes to get their shit together
---
Could someone explain who's Hyde
---
Lol so your solution is that people should give up parts of Eve gameplay that they think are not balanced.
---
Well, they did step in.
---
Probably the worst video that's been on reddit all week.
---
I wonder what comms were like after burning around for 2 hours with no kills only to get pipebombed one jump from home 
---
Fcore are not as strong as they use to be miss those guys
---
I want to kill you (in game) just by virtue of how bad this post is.
---
Neither side will try and go for the killing blow on either alliance.
---
Test wants frt because they are manageable content and they can just shit on them whenver with legcacy + imperium
---
Frt cannot really hurt test, so they just farm the legacy buffer states.
---
The real joke here is that you're portraying the average goon as capable of making a decision on their own.
---
Damn i can not wait for that. I love flying BS, also be able to have hardcore BS PVE "end game" content would be so cool, my marauders are waiting! 
---
Hopefully there will be more variety to combat, not only Rattlesnakes and golems... Like some sniping sites for rails and arty
---
what do they mean by multiplex?
---
thus was my goal, its legit ment to be a shit post of a video, was just having a bit of fun editing a video 
---
So from what I read here:
---
The Texans are about to bite off more than they can chew. Again. 
---
Then scream for help and Tennesseeans are going to come bail them out. Again. 
---
Except Tennessee used to be a part of North Carolina. 
---
What's North Carolina's postal abbreviation again?
---
ULTRABIGGESTTHONK emoji goes here. 
---
+1 for the flag though. I do love a good throwback with flair. 
---
I did the math about half a week ago and even with favorable rough rounding, you come up ~400m isk short.
---
I feel like there is a story here we’re not getting OP. I’m going to guess and say the DST tried looting the battlefield and got obliterated.
---
Normal business practice is to give a retroactive discount if it's within a reasonable time frame.
---
Given your flair I don't expect you to find this logical.
---
Nice deleted account bruv
---
Have to hand it to you, you might be on to something.
---
Cheezah brav
---
Perhaps put her in an environment that you have personally vetted? If your corp members know that thats your kid, and you can trust them, while you are online with your kid, then that might be a good solution!
---
ah another group trying to purge a group of lowecers from lowsec.. by killing a single fortizar. ...
---
Goons did it to us once, lemminged around Khanid for 3 weeks, killed 3 raitarus and an azbel and declared victory. ...and left...
---
Except for being at -10 you have easily available options: redfrog/blackfrog/pushx, your alliance logistics, alts. The difference here is: setting up to play with negative sec status is some one-time effort with minimum time needed to maintain it, but staying at high sec status means constant time investment into keeping it, requiring you to grind up after every time you get into some lowsec fight. Similar case with faction standings - as soon as you get them to level you want them to be, it takes effort to change that if you don't rat and don't run missions on that character.
---
This is such an overlooked downside of injectors. Even with the bazarr there was a "paper trail" of sorts with scumbags gett8mg new identities. Now it is 100% clean
---
Frat will make Seelow Heights look like a small brawl
---
soviet avatar must be colored in red
---
if the bonus is actually implemented, then navy ship should have same bonus
---
Yep that's half an extractor.
---
I had this problem yesterday. I haven't checked today. When I did a traceroute for EVE, the first few pings were OK ( &lt; 10s), but then all others timed out. I did other traceroutes with other apps to see if the issue was on my end, but they were fine. So I assume CCP's servers, their ISP, and/or Cloudflare are all taking a shit. 
---
It totally depends where you set up.  High sec, NS, or WH space.  The strategies are very different, also dependent if you own the Pocos or can negotiate a low rate.  
---
PM me some details on what you plan to set up and we can chat about what could be best for you.  
---
PS.  Years ago, [I wrote a blurb](https://splatus.wordpress.com/2017/02/04/planetary-interaction-in-high-sec-pocket-money-for-casual-players/) on setting up *very* casual HS PI.  Its not a PLEX printer but enough to pay for a few ships etc / month.  
---
It’s better to be deployed and destroyed than hoarded as a collectors item in a hisec station. 
---
Basically an additional 200-250m, plus 300-350 from the raw price discount. Plex headed somewhere in the 4.8-5.5 range before it becomes inefficient to omega up. 
---
A word of advice. Don't try and rules lawyer as a new player, it never goes well.
---
I thought Wally’s post was bad, but goddamn son, you’re a natural.
---
DRONES IN DRONSIN DROWNSIN DROSIN DROSIN DROWSIN DRONESIN 
---
*layers upon layers*
---
Perhaps, personally I think T1 BSes are just trash atm and really need looked at so prolly not a good comparison. Compare Domi and Thanny locktime for instance (before considering the NSA lmao).
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=825,826&amp;b=8538060,8539500&amp;e=1470,30&amp;t=rfub *note we did lose all our ships when trying to get back home well almost all
---
Kinda hard to beat goons big industrial base 
---
yeah aha. im just trying to think of a way to give it the whole "break a rule" role that pirate factions have without breaking the ship entirely. 
---
Test aren’t nearly as strong as goons, and even with legacy they’d probably lose a war against the combined eastern forces. But I think Frt is no longer allied with SkillU/HRE, so I’m not sure how well they’ll do here. It looks to be a stalemate so far 
---
To my knowledge there is not a single ship in the game (other than the removed ones like Jovian ships etc) That have ''died out''.  There's only one exception I can think of which is the Megathron Federate Issue which is locked in Entity's locked which will very unlikely ever leave it's hanger.
---
Yeah I heard about that one, thanks for sharing with me :)
---
Lol this is not "a single Fort" or just "another group trying to purge lowsecers"
---
This is a long and oppressive war. 
---
We have systematically taken everything they own. We don't care where they live.. But they will not own any assets or make any moon income within our space. 
---
If they want to continue to Rot here with no income by all means. 
---
I only operate with the finest reasonable time frames out there.
---
Yo...triggered krabshit....you should have shown more balls against INIT then coming here and defending low class corps that YOU would have "completely" evicted, if given the chance.
---
Drink more koolaid &amp; krab some more before telling others what they can or can't do shithead.
---
Guristas are connoisseurs of only the finest of shitposts.
---
quality meme. feelsbooshman.jpeg
---
When your FC is an inbred who can barely get a word out without sounding like some REEEE'ing virgin I think you can understand why people are laughing at you. The best part is they still sell this as corp PVP whilst hiding in a Chink botting alliance. Never fucking change BL &lt;3
---
How would you even set up sites for BSs, without making them all about tank? Everything will apply damage perfectly, at all times. Good luck reaching the cans in time, too. Marauders might become the only viable option, betwen tank and mjd bonuses.
---
Unless they introduce cap gun NPCs, in which case there might still be room for piloting skill. E
---
Sadly A few will be on banned accounts with somer blink and some ~others~`
---
They are not Chinese bots. They are Chinese repeaters，understand?
---
Hey, I'm definitely on the younger side of eve. ive played since i was 13 years old. I grew up with eve, im sure your kids can too. But, eve is complicated and i definitely couldnt grasp it well enough at that age. It's doable but id be worried about the internet creeps out there
---
So, bombers? I get on a ton of cap kills every time I go out with BB.
---
Does this triggered krab not know of "paragraphs"? lol
---
Or go to nullsec to hunt for them. There are no station guns there. And you don't get flagged or lose security status.
---
100mn cruisers
---
No im saying if youre so happy with how one aspect of gameplay is then maybe dont participate in it? The fax nerfs are gonna hit super fleets where it hurts. If youre still unhappy with it then maybe just do something that makes you happier lol. Super/titan n+1 wont change just because a few people are butthurt about it.
---
Ok
---
I am referring more to other blocs entering the arena either with one of the two groups
---
Just another term for multiboxing while perfoming one click that is being sent to multiple clients at the same time. 
---
Yeah, that’s one way. I still miss community. It’s difficult to find a matching group, but being a part of one is life-changing.
---
You actually get used to how he FCs pretty quickly. You also can't argue that despite how he sounds it's pretty damn effective.
---
It might be the opposite. If the people who are willing to buy plex still buy it, they’ll need to spend less money to get the same amount of isk. And the people who don’t buy plex could mostly have irl reasons for not buying it that don’t really relate to it’s isk value 
---
Same boat as you, just at 13. I turned out fine and i feel like i grew up with eve. 
---
I turned out fine
---
There is a sale, 425 plex for 1 month omega. The effective price is actually down quite a bit
---
If this makes you quit, you don't want to see the prices next month. :)
---
okay bye.
---
Doen't care, continues to super rat in his Vendetta. 
---
Or just...pay for your sub
---
WH Bushido whenever it's someone else. If it was HK or any other triggered krabshits in this thread, they wouldn't have even left the Raitaru lol.
---
Btw..."newbro" but with "a Fort &amp; Cap support"...I daresay what will qualify them as a non-newbro corp.....a couple of titans parked in the nearest LS from their HS ext?? 😂
---
Me. I've tried it for years only to constantly die to gate camps. I even spent months training to fly force recon, assuming I could stealth past these losers and actually play the game this way - turns out people actually can set up warp disruption bubbles along common warp paths and pull people out of stealth/warp. 
---
Solo PvP is not possible in Eve.
---
2x Fed Navy Megathron (2 exist, one owned by Entity)
---
4x State Ravens (2 still known to be somewhat active)
---
4x Tribal Tempests (afaik 3 still are on accounts where the owners are at least aware that EVE Online is still a game)
---
0x Imperial Apoc
---
0x Imperial Geddon
---
(thanks tyrrax)
---
I believe those are the only unique BS that have been in the game, I might be wrong though. 
---
Confirmed by poor quality comment above.... 
---
And thr subsequent nerf
---
Newbros don't own Forts &amp; have cap support...
---
Yours too &lt;3
---
It is nagative 250m with +5 implants and perfect mapping right now.
---
I'm guessing we're not seeing a fax or maybe a couple of guardians on the winning side?  Only way I could account for the Vindi not dying. 
---
WH space is spooky and spooky things happen there.
---
How bout a heavy stealth bomber approach?  Allow them to fit a couple of capital torpedo launchers but give them a massive bonus to effectiveness and damage *against capital ships*.  They can be cloaky but vulnerable if caught solo.  They can be risky to fly. And they can absolutely devastating in packs vs capital assets.
---
Or, you know... pay the subscription fee. I mean, while there are exceptions--particularly players who live in countries where average salaries are quite low--if you live in most of North America, Western Europe, or Oceania there really is no excuse for the "QQ plexs are so high I can't play eve..."
---
It's supposed to ready...."Special Snowflake"
---
What I do on grindr is none of your gosh darn business.
---
Yeah man! what the Provi guy said! INIT poster. 
---
Elo is a fag but you’re a even bigger fag lmao
---
Lmfao still salty you didn't get that fight huh. 1400 people vs 250. You're a fucking spazoid aren't you! 
---
Let's see you guys fight those numbers. Oh that's right, you wouldn't. You'd just shit up local and probably rage quit the game. 
---
I can tell people to do whatever the hell I please and I will continue to do so while it triggers people like it has you. 
---
The fact my comment triggered you so hard show just how much of a salty boi you are. Now run along upstairs poppet and give your mummy a hug. She might even wipe those tears away for you.
---
Fucking cretin...
---
Incoming shit tier response in... 3... 2...
---
Definitely - it's only natural. It will sort FW people even better :)
---
Unfortunately there is not a `POST /calendar/event` endpoint at this minute.  There is an open feature request to add one https://github.com/esi/esi-issues/issues/164.
---
Once that is added it would be possible to write something that could pull GC events and push them to EVE.  But that would have to be some custom code.
---
I prefer twat waffle, sounds better.
---
You realise they are usually very easy to avoid.....
---
God I hope so.  Content is fun, so is whoring super pod kills with a longbow or dual boxing with a ninja salvager
---
Even at 4.5m a plex, you save 330mil by plexing your account today
---
So true. Praise James \o/
---
Its a pretty bad 1 vs 1 bs... 
---
I think 5ilent 5hift got a state Raven
---
So when shiny mods on a ship are destroyed... Its not an isk sink?
---
Obligatory "can I have your stuff?" =)
---
Seems like theirs more then one pilot on the right side of BR...
---
Mmmhhhmmm, I do love this precious salt that you have gifted me...I'll store it in the Salt Chamber...now, onto your comment...
---
"1400 vs 250"!!? Well you lying little krabshit...lol making your own facts.
---
I live in w-space btw...you assuming krabshit...I'm not gonna respond to rest of your spergy erotica that's solely based on the assumption that I'm from null. 🤣🤣🤣
---
Not at all. Any ISK you paid for the mods and ship, except for taxes you have to pay, remains in circulation.
---
Me because there is no solo kill? I see the support didnt make it on the kms.
---
even if he meant an anchor able bubble that sentence still make 0 sense.
---
No not really. How am I supposed to know a disruption bubble is in the middle of space before I hit it?
---
Furthermore, how do I even find any targets? With gate camps galore, no one is able to fly solo for more than 5 minutes until getting capped.
---
Gate camping has long been the single problem facing Eve, and it's pretty easy to fix. Kind of astonishing that it's been unaddressed this long tbh.
---
Gotta buy the dip, did they learn nothing from Bitcoin?
---
Quick mafs but it's still cheaper to sub with cash, no? 
---
I've never bought plex before, but I'm seriously considering it currently due to the higher prices. So I guess I'm the other half of this argument.
---
They are usually only gate to gate, if you go at odd angles you fly right by.
---
Having Tacs above gates also works to avoid them.
---
Considering the other week i yoloed a battleship 25 jumps through null no thats not the case. 
---
You just have to not be a retard to avoid 90% of gate camps. 
---
Yeah, I’m not saying that no one is going to buy plex because of this, but it’s also not a certainty that total plex sales will increase 
---
I am wondering how long until Elo quits Eve again and BL becomes irrelevant again.
---
Oh nevermind already irrelevant. Had to join Panda Express to try to become relevant. 
---
Or maybe, just possibly, you could use a low cost, T1 Hull with a jump drive that uses capital size weapons.
---
Same idea where 25-30 of them will make a mess out of any unsupported capital ship quickly.
---
To make it balanced, they might have to be stuck in place for a period, maybe 5 minutes, once they engage.
---
If only there was something like that in game.
---
its HARD when the RORQUAL jumps a gate UNSCOUTED and the JUICES are PUMPING
---
Who is this sad clown
---
don't you have forums you can post about your drinking problems on?
---
Black ops ships can do a lot of dps and active tank pretty well, would be interesting to see how it plays out.
---
I am sure people can argue with it. I am not going to waste my time.
---
Bs Hull with worse tracking than a dread but 10,000 dps?
---
Bahahaha responds to me saying youre a salty boi with 'oooh salt'. Get some OC you dickrider.
---
Mummy's calling, upstairs you go. Nearly bedtime princess. 
---
high plex prices = fewer interested people dumping $$$ into the game
---
but how about 
---
a) if you live in a certain region of space that should reflect in what you fly and you're going to have to make it work. Also if they implement a relationship matrix it will mean you can say kill blood raiders in goon space and the guristas will love you more - means your doctrine will be the extra buffed guristas ships.   
---
b) You can farm standings if a relationship matrix is built - killing angels will raise rep with blood raiders etc. Game economy won't be "thrown out the window" it will adapt as it always did.   
---
c) maybe it will eliminate fotm doctrines and actually make the living place more of an impactful decision besides just income rates. I mean the Goonswarm with their beefed up snakes will be fought differently than the test with unbonused snakes, whereas when test drives in with their souped up bhaal fleet you will have to think about it diferently cause now they have an extra 5% resists or something.   
---
I don't think it will "break the game" necessarily, but it will definitely give some more work to ccp and something to do for the players.   
---
It will also solve the weirdness of running faction sites in that same faction's ships which I personally find immersion breaking :P 
---
Good lord the third party spin in this thread is real. I would love for you to find any member of WHSOC saying that we were lacking for content lol
---
Armor marauders can tank a lot. Like 10k dps if not more, with some pimp applied. Shield - not so much, but still can squeeze several thousands.
---
Regarding pvp, if you forget about Leshak for a minute there is a curious thing: any active battleship can tank at least twice as more DPS as any battleship can do, so it will become a capacitor battle.
---
And marauders have biggest cargo of all battleships.
---
By using your head and never warping direct to gates. Most gates are near a planet so you can warp to its poco at range, so you don't get decloaked, hit dscan to check for bubbles then warp to gate.
---
If bubbles then use your map to find something to warp in from that wouldn't be in the normal direct path.
---
You say that but you’ve literally summed up about 80% of the adult EVE playerbase.
---
JBAITED
---
Looking at the battle reports it looks like goons did the heavy lifting. Weird flex you show here, but ok.
---
Big if true
---
As far as I can see after spending a few hours in fleet last night, no one seems to really care. Hyde just doesn't fly with us.
---
Tough spot?  Defend who?  If you are selling supers and titans to those outside of our coalition you are not a goon so if true he can fuck right off.  
---
You guys keep talking about Elo quitting - the dude generates content for dozens of people almost every single day, and has kept it up for more than a year straight. I think you need a new meme; this one makes you look like you get all your information from Reddit. 
---
If Elo quits tomorrow we'll still have had a blast in BL and farming ~our hunting preserve~ Immensea has been some of the most fun I've had in this game in years. 
---
Ooh a warp speed bonused Angel logi that could hang with our destroyer fleets...
---
well, there isn't a problem yet so theres no need to do anything. 
---
As long as people ae willing to pay more prices will go up, and making 2b is easier now than ever
---
I belive that SC does family friendly comms, but they're certainly not a day care.
---
Unless you want to donate your child's labor to mapping Thera! 
---
CCP: We want to watch the eve economy burn
---
CCP Economist: Hold my beer.. i have this.
---
CCP Community:  Its your fault, you made me do it...
---
I guess they're trying to pressure skill farms by both increasing the cost of running the farm (plex) and by devaluing SP (giving away free SP)
---
because for the first few weeks, people lose ships to the timer or enemies.
---
and then people find out the meta picks. and the losses slow down to only d/c loses or tier 4/5.
---
still, its a sink for a few weeks....
---
what ccp should do is stop listening to random retards on reddit. 
---
Solo PvP is definitely possible in EVE. I cheat and fly ceptor alt + main, but there are people who do true solo and do well too. 
---
See: https://zkillboard.com/character/95574399/
---
It has gotten harder to find good fights in recent times, but it's certainly still possible.
---
Literally plexed my alt yesterday. Fuck my ass
---
\&gt;  As long as people ae (sic) willing to pay more prices will go up, and making 2b is easier now than ever
---
That's the exact root problem.
---
Yeah and terrible for new players and non-veterans players who can't pay for their subscription.
---
Texas law is a reference to this post.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4altpg/ladies_and_gentlemen_i_give_you_peak_salt
---
Its well worth your time to watch but there are TL:DRs in the comments.
---
Marauder gun bonus, bonus to XL gun fitting, penalty to tracking. 
---
Similar flavour to the battlecruisers that can fit large guns, but really weak to being kited by small ships to prevent blapping BS fleets with them.
---
Parents always seek to protect their kids, but you already know you cant. Especially online, they will become exposed to bad things. Educating them on how to handle it is the only way. At some point you wont be there, they will be on their own, and they'll have to deal. 
---
Hopefully you will have equipped them with the skills required for that moment. 
---
You cannot stop that moment occuring, unless you turn off the internet.
---
but your kid will eventually learn to turn it back on....they're well smart these days.
---
no? 
---
This is about plex prices. Making ISK is way too easy but thats another problem 
---
Is it an actual requirement to be this retarded to be in goons?
---
[Killing is just a means of communication.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSxNW5dDYEY&amp;spfreload=10) ;) Sometimes thats exactly what kids need(online).
---
Well, the western front for WC is apparantly not quiet, so I guess east is the only rational direction to make that lovely reference.
---
They can't pay to sub 15+ accounts. I'd be perfectly happy to see multiboxing die imho, I think it's been a real detriment to the game.
---
We have no moral dilemmas. We belong to the state and the state protects.
---
might be best to bring her into your Corp to start then. pretty easy to monitor comms plus you ought to already know everyone
---
That's not an ISK sink, it's a material sink
---
Mineral and shiny module sink. In terms of isk it's more likely a faucet because of insurance
---
You check like that you're gonna get a UTI
---
negative, it only sucks in max TIDI cause missiles in general suck in TIDI.
---
But it's still possible to have them sync the other way around. For example, if you still have towers somewhere, you should be able to pull tower fuel reminders into your calendar app and have your phone remind you to fuel them.
---
55k plex...... wtf
---
Question: I left the game before skill injection was a thing, so I'm not entirely sure how it works.
---
if someone were willing to spend the RL money buying plex and converting it in game to isk and then buying injectors, can't they train pretty much anything in days or even instantly?  Or is there some kind of injection limit (I'm talking Omegas, naturally).
---
So inflation?
---
Well at least put some effort into it and use the right bee.
---
30 days of omega does cost less than yesterday.
---
Damn..34b split only 6 or so ways..that's good money!

Did it strike a nerve. Stop taking Reddit serious, nerd. 
---
So he creates content for a dozen people. Good for him. How about you create content for people too? Is Elo the only person in BL or excuse me Origin who creates content? So when he leaves BL/Origin goes away no content. 
---
Drink more koolaid to calm that heartache plus that possible triggered heart attack...

Little krabby shithead.
---
They could just nerf skill injectors if it was their intention lol
---
The youngest I've seen (myself included, back eons ago) was about 15 or 16. If Corp and comms have been notified to their presence, they're usually more reserved out of respect for their age. But, again, that was my experience when I started at 16.
---
pls stop posting
---
Clearly you missed all the people with 200k last week
---
No. 
---
Not really.. The russians chased after the canes a lot more for sure as they are not as mobile as us. 
---
But we all did our share to bring the fort down. 
---
The Strategic Objective was 100x more important than "Gud fites". 
---
This was to drive the point home that the russians no longer control the area.. 
---
And the message was pretty clear, when for over a month you get out played in Rus Rus Prime by a US tz group. And finally lose 2 forts in one day. 
---
Why would you ever use a blops over a marauder, though? Hell, I'd say rattle for the majority of the sites.
---
It would only make sense if they all stay the same style. A minmatar  hanger in a amarr structure wouldn't work. For non empire ones. You could have a selection in the deployment or firing windows though 
---
It's lussy Lou.
---
He already used this deadly setup just few days ago and murder lots of WH folks before dieing in flames and glory.

yea theyre retards for not holding forever in hopes of an unannounced sale

Nightmare vs Bhaal? Bhaals are incredibly slow mate, the nightmare can kite it to death unless the bhaal wants to gimp itself with nano. At most, it will get a 45km web (Max Abyssal'd RF Web), while the nightmare has a nice 50km optimal with blessed scorch and goes ~170km faster unheated (X-Type 100MN, no snakes) than an MWDing bhaal.

Join Pandemic Horde. Or Brave Newbies. There’s several other new player corps, but those larger ones have better infrastructure and teaching programs. Also they tend to have more content (pvp) particularly Horde, as they are currently staged in BWF-ZZ which is quite close to jita, and makes them a popular destination for roams and NPSI Fleets.

All the wrecks blew up. Lol

There destroyer allready looks like a fighter.

pls
---
skill farmers are a subset of all characters, by giving it to everyone CCP increases supply and prices should go down, hurting the SP farmers' margins
---
They did? Why? On purpose? Or did they bomb the wrecks too?
---
I do create content for people. You don't have a clue what you're talking about. 
---
But you wanna talk about a one-trick pony? Let's talk about TEST. Why is it you guys seem to feed in USTZ when PGL isn't there to hold your hand? You have to get your meatshield to abandon their territory to go keep ADMs high in Immensea because the people who "live" there are so fucking incompetent that if left to their own devices they'd lose the space in a week (meanwhile TEST gets to stay safe in Esoteria lmfao, your pets are second-class citizens in your coalition, as usual). You just fed a few hundred bil to Snuffed Out because you jumped kitchen sink supers in on an obvious bait drop with mixed armor/shield faxes. Your fleets are nightmare shit shows, the individual pilot skill is bottom tier and if you didn't have and FC telling you literally how to fly your ship every step of the way 30% of your fleet members would fly directly at the enemy. And the best part is that most of your members don't have any fucking clue cause their only PvP experience is being handheld on 200 man fleets by PGL.
---
Yeah we rely a lot on Elo - but every single one of us was doing something fun on our own before BL, and we'll all go back to doing something else fun on our own if/when BL stops being a thing. The individual pilot skill in BL is high. We try to do the best we can on an individual level and improve as a group _deliberately_. Can you say the same? Or are you just waiting for daddy PGL to log in so you can feel big and strong again?

Sounds like a thanksgiving turkey who was stuffed with a whole bunch of cacao.

how do I get in touch with these corps? Just ask in-game or do I have to apply somewhere on the web?
---
Didn't you say you would stop playing? Please just do it and gtfo, noone cares.
---
Skill has certainly been helping out frat a fair bit on timers of late. Mainly in coward sniping boosh eagles but helping nonetheless.

if you need, please don't hesitate to ask additional information

Capitals are accessible - i have no idea why people assume you need a lot of SP to get into capital.       
---
Good carrier char is below 20mil SP.       
---
Good super char is around 22-25mil sp.      
---
Good titan char is around 35mil sp.           
---
iskies 4 my toonies for titans that will never undock, sounds like a good deal to me
---
But you cares.
---
if you want to learn first before jumping into PvP
---
E-UNI.  they are friendly, focused on teaching, and can train you in all parts of EVE
---
if your up for learning in a pvp enfironment, with newbro ship handouts. then you got some choices.
---
Pandemic Horde accepts any and all, no security check needed. and is one of the more active PvP locations due to this.  its also one of the largest. and growing fast.  also its closest to Jita. with alot of Newbro fleets, ship handouts, and etc.
---
Brave Newbies are the southern/Legacy option. fun guys, with alot of corps you can grow into.  some security needed
---
Karmafleet is the Goonswarm newbro corp.  security needed, part of the strongest group in the game currently.  and live in the safest space of the top 3 coalitions.  also great for earning isk.   they also do wierd but fun stuff including highsec piracy, or industrial pvp (industrial ship pvp....yeah told ya its wierd. but its fun!)
---
theres a few others, but those are the big ones of note for newbros.
---
Fix: Reduce the amount of extractors you can extract to 1-2 per month the account has been omega. Total.  
---
6 month of omega? 6 or 12 total extractions.  
---
24 month of omega? 24 or 48 total extractions.  
---
Minmatar ships
---
Because Sin drone boat, neuts for pvp and shittt
---
Burn Jita, this time by CCP themselves.
---
It has some of the most inferior dps and inferior range on torps imaginable. It's only good attribute is it's tank, but tank on dreads means dick all.
---
Like, T2 versions of already overpowered ship line?
---
Great Test! Grrr! Wow looks like somebody takes Eve way too serious. You need to go outside and get some sun.  Show me where on the doll PGL hurt you? When did we say or care about Elite PVP? We are playing a game and having fun.. Jealous much? You don't sound like your having fun there buddy. 
---
R/evejobs
---
&gt; Or, you know... pay the subscription fee.
---
Even better, if PLEX is to high and a sub is too much, just go Alpha. Even if you only get 25% of the game for free there is still plenty of fun to be had.
---
:)
---
wow rude what the heck

Yeah, you've been trying to go with this whole 'Were TNT, we're independent, and we dont really care about the situation' shtick for a bit, huh?
---
Cool bud
---
 - PLEX prices are neither good nor bad. 
---
 - They reflect active demand. 
---
 - If you want PLEX prices to fall, there needs to be more demand from the cash store. 
---
 - The number 1 way of generating demand is to consume produced goods. 
---
 - You consume produced goods by generating content. Content denial is not content. Krabbing is minor content. 
---
 - Capital content consumes production the fastest. Find some way of getting capitals to fight each other easier and without a guranteed outcome.
---
  - Maybe play with jump times or cyno inhib times. 
---
  - Did somebody say capital blops? 
---
  - Capital Hics? 
---
  - The faction fort idea was great, but short lived. 
---
  - A cyno inhibitor ship would be pretty awesome for generation content. Something that can't cloak but inhibits the entire system while in siege. 
---
lmao wtf, lock range

Nice have fun in Toronto!
---
&gt;fewer people willing to pay $$$ for plex to sell for ISK
---
Listen to yourself, what you're saying is that people don't want to pay the same amount for more in game assets? The better the deal is the less people want it? Wonder why so many people buy during Plex sales, obviously they want a shittier deal for themselves right?
---
Tldr stop being poor
---
I think CCP wants to dry the plex market up. It would cause a great depression in eve and purge alot of farmers. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE PURGE IN EVE
---
The Sin does nothing that a navy Dominix doesn't, though. And the rattle is basically superior to both. In general, blops are no better than t1 stuff, as actual combat goes. A cheap Hyperion wipes the floor with a Sin, in 1v1.
---
I'm having trouble remembering. Is this the guy who said something I'll paraphrase like, "You are beneath me" in a longer post?
---
But if he did that, he wouldn't have a soapbox from atop which he can cry about his martyrdom.
---
I actually did listen to your stream in the background for a bit, and i wonder why you came up with this video as your "best-of".
---
I think there were funnier bits. But then again, getting your content on reddit trying to make some space autists laugh .... comedy gold. 
---
"The squeaky wheel gets the grease"
---
Oh he is gone.. you just can't see it.
---
&gt;It has some of the most inferior dps
---
lmfao no, no it does not.
---
&gt;inferior range on torps imaginable
---
62km with faction torps. That's further out than a HAW Nag with faction ammo, and about the range a Moros gets with Null. Obviously, a Rev with Scorch out-ranges it.
---
&gt;but tank on dreads means dick all.
---
Clearly not as this BR shows...or if in K-Space, any of Lasker's videos or Lussy's videos.
---
As said elsewhere, most medium to large alliances will have some sort of JF service for shipping goods. If you haven’t already used one of the spare character slots on your account (or have a character that isn’t in alliance) go ahead and use that character for the purchases and then have the goods shipped. Worst case, see if one of the public shipping services will go to your area.
---
Nope.
---
Never confuse posting on reddit with careing about something.
---
after ccp ghost's lecture at evesterdam I felt a short urge to finally join a player-run corp  (◠‿◠) 
---
Oh my...the big bad HK guys that can't even defend his own wh is telling me to "go upstairs"...what will I do? 😂😂
---
there is no limit.  You can inject directly to 150m sp on the first day if you want.
---
&gt;Listen to yourself, what you're saying is that people don't want to pay the same amount for more in game assets?
---
you're thinking of it backwards, like most people who reply to my comments do.
---
The price is higher because people didn't want to pay money for the same amount of assets, and are only willing to when the assets are significantly higher.
---
Don't mix up cause and effect.
---
Well, if I were in your shoes, I'd educate and trust my kid to understand the world is not all sunshine and rainbows (depending on age). Then put her into a ship, explain that edgy strange people exist in the (reputed) anonymity of ze internetz and get her going. As stated a kindergarten within the realm of the internet bares more dangers than it does good. There have been multiple cases where pedophiles gathered on kid's sites to pretend do be their new playmate.   
---
You simply can't saveguard your kid from the apparent realities out there forever. So I (and this is just me) would go for the preparation approach, however awkward this might become. 
---
Even if EVE has one of the more thoughtful communities, the golden rule applies: Never trust anybody!  
---
Just my 2 cents.  
---
Is that vindi just there for webs and neuts? What kind of local reps does it have to not get blapped by the dreads? Seems pretty baller
---
(◡_____________________________◡✿)
---
CCP cares a lot more about player numbers. And if the PLEX prices are causing a negative impact on Alpha player numbers then you can bet your ass they will intervene.
---
you missed a chance of making it a crab claw   
---
*snip snip*
---
with the plex price being what it is, i'm contemplating buying a bunch of them using a credit card and being a rich space lord.  (✿◠‿◠) 
---
anyone have any helpful ideas on when the eventual turning point comes where the price reaches its maximum and starts crashing down?
---
They likely all have public chat channels you can join and get more info. I know ours is 'Public Karma'. I'd definitely suggest looking in /r/evejobs though for more info
---
Make people pay their subs like we used to. And dumpster Plex. If you can't afford it. You shouldn't be gaming anyway. 
---
Its kinda slow at the moment, both sides are testing the water (aka bad touching each others Rorquals).
---
Skillu seem to be happy to third party on every major timer, not seen the hammer drop yet.
---
Of course they are doing it intentionally. This isnt the real world market, CCP controls all parameters of the sandbox, from ISK generation in game to real world currency price of PLEX.
---
The PLEX price is where CCP wants it to be.
---
My man, you're all over the map. Pick a narrative and stick with it - or better yet, just do what comes naturally and wait for Vily to tell you what to think.

i want to give a shout-out to all the low-sec groups who come to geminate to teach the beans about smallgang combat. keep our krabs wary and the bean thirsty. 
---
EVE was fine before it. Actually much better when people paid subs only. Much better more mature player base. Tbh. There was none of that no lifer living in mom's basement 45 RORQUAL plexing and mining
---
thanks a lot! One question though, what are you referring to when you say that some corporations "require security"?
---
This is true, but they’re adults. I don’t care if their butt gets hurt a bit [or a lot].
---
I am, on the other hand, protective of very young people in a mostly adult environment. It is also important that adults don’t have to start self-censoring just because there are kids in the channel and now you have to weigh your every word, just so you wouldn’t traumatise a kid who doesn’t understand connotations and the weight of words, or deal with people from other cultures. 
---
You do as mummy tells you like a good little boy. 
---
Join the ingame chat channel "Join Horde". Hit apply, wait a few hours and you're in :) No API screening.
---
Once you are in you can join the channel "Newbeans" which is a troll free chat channel. You can ask all your questions there. See you on grid!
---
God plz no. If you do this your kid will end up living in your basement and never leaving the house. Mining with 56 plexed rorquals and dropping sooopers on a 2 man duo roam.
---
Found the female pilot :-)
---
the vindicator is with the dreads, they can apply they cap guns thanks to insane webs :
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75804016/
---
his setup is 2 dreads (can or HAW gun), one apostle, one vindi, one balgo (optional) and several armor dst for refit/refuel
---
I guess I could show screenshots of all the nothing about this in our various chat(s), but what would be the point? Keep it up champ, I'm sure the grrgoons crowd is eating that shit up.
---
yes, and what do people do with surplus isk?
---
inject another rorqual
---
buy skins
---
play for 'free'
---
what do all of the above have in common? they all increase plex consumption, which pushes prices up.
---
# Oh.
---
The best scoop here is that NC undock.
---
Everything is here in eve to be destroyed so it was her destiny ;)
---
Better scammed in Eve than irl imo. Lessons.

Aaaand RIP plex price.

Nice a 628 year cycle time. 😄
---
No problem, you guys get the Davy Crockett exemption.

---
Quitting 2019 is legit
---
lol get a load of these dads 
---
This solves nothing.
---
You cannot sell a product, then invalidate that product for a customer.  It is akin to selling a customer a gift card, then saying 'but if you don't spend it, we get your money for free' and also make interest on the deposit itself.  (strictly speaking, some jurisdictions forbid this)
---
Additionally, this means each individual plex (and you realize that plex multiplied by 500) would need its own expiration date?  so another database, another mess of information to manage, when there are literally 100 things that need to be fixed/recoded/nerfed/buffed/dealt with before this implementation would even be feasible and tested and deployed.  
---
This would also break the market, and you would only be able to see plex on contract.  And even then, do you want to go through 500 items on a contract and make sure that the plex isn't expired, going to expire soon, is some mixed bag of old and new, etc?  Do you want to somehow write an application that takes that data and post processes it to figure out which contract isn't a scam?
---
If you are going to shit post, and I love a good shit post, could you at least \*try\* to support your argument?
---
Correct.
---
If by "62km" you mean 48.5km, then yeah.
---
Just let us go into the arena directly. I have no interest doing boring PvE before.
---
Make the arena bigger, random spawn point, no T2 ships allowed, no capitals, no logi, no fleet boost, no sec standing loss, evironmental effects that nerf cheesy kiting fits and only the last man standing gets the reward. Basically battle royale in EVE. 
---
so in EVE theres something called an API (or whatever htey call it now)
---
it basically means when you join a corp, most require you give them this API, which lets them see your EVE mail, wallet, and corporation history. jsut so they know your not a spy or being paid by an enemy corp to spy on them.
---
it does NOT let them do anything on your account, just view some of it. 
---
who gives a fuck if a small handful of players quit when people with 200+ character skillfarms are propping up the PCU.
---
s'all about the metrics.
---
if you're flying something blingy you have to have a falcon alt and or a fax on back up to get out when they hot drop you like real men
---
Hey atleast there wont be any stacking penalty 
---
Yes plz. 
---
Thank you for clarifying...
---
Multibox built the super umbrellas. The only detriment is that there isn't enough capital/supercapital losses to balance out production. 
---
It would be a material sink. Battleship require a lot of minerals to build.
---
EVE's changed a bit. PvE is now much more socially acceptable. The big controversy now is whether it's OK to do it in a semi-AFK, bot-aspirant manner.
---
50bill lol.... also price will never go down. Perhaps know what your talking about before you reply on here in future.
---
yes
---
After Hyde left and came back nobody liked him anyways, so I don't this has much if an impact on TNT as a whole.

His account is a throwaway, so he has been through this before. The post doesn't matter because its reddit, everyone knows it is him. He was probably getting reddit spam messages 
---
imma let you finish, but Sin (and BO in general) are fucking dogshit stat-wise.
---
Its basically a worse dominix with a 1b hull price tag, that can jump to covert cynos.
---
Some updates are unavoidable, but in the launcher you can turn off “download everything” and that should keep the total package down to a minimum if you don’t undock.
---
I see, thanks for the explanation. So if I understand correctly, the Horde is the Alliance or some umbrella organization which has multiple corporations for different purposes. And depending on what path do I chose (e.g mining, exploration, etc) I can join one of the coprs that has players with the same occupation as me.
---
I need to show you my hyper-cane fit. 6km/s, 4.5 au/s, full skirm links set.

---
&gt;missiles in general suck in TIDI
---
Why does TIDI change the effectiveness of missiles?
---
I'm too busy winning Eve.
---
Thats not necessarily true ... i sometimes make it like 80 jumps in a battleship ... that pretty much means, i get no fight ... and i will die in a huge force that is just coming to kill me ... not for letting me having a chance ... but that pretty much takes me 2h basically ... result is the same like yours after 5min ... but just saying it's not necessarily limited to 5min
---
That's not a sink. No ISK gets destroyed when ships die, in fact it gets generated due to insurance. So ship death is an ISK faucet.
---
&gt; This is a long and oppressive war
---
Be prepared for it, at least for some years, cause they wont go away.
---
You know its Lowsec, you can stage out of stations and experienced oldfart lowseccers give a shit about tethering Supers or titans, they know how to handle them without. So if you plan to stay for years and grind them every week you might succeed some day, else you will be just another round of content.
---
&gt;anyone have any helpful ideas on when the eventual turning point comes where the price reaches its maximum and starts crashing down?
---
Probably right after this weekend the prices will drop.
---
I am willing to pay cash for PLEX to sell on market only when PVP&gt;PVE because I don't have time to krab when kill mails are happening that I could be part of. If jack-all is going on, I set up passive income sources and go play something else for a while. 
---
I agree. I’m also going to say that a lot of the lessons EVE teaches can readily be used in the real world.
---
However, I don’t think that has to happen at age 12.
---
You're dumb, stop posting.
---
No. But it helps.
---
shhhh ... thats just one guy quintupleboxing :]
---
McAfee thinks bitcoin will hit 1 million by 2020...

yep.
---
Horde is both a corp and the alliance.
---
Horde the corp is where all newbros start off.  join newbro fleets and classes.   and from there as htey figure out what they want to do, they can transfer to other corps in horde the alliance.
---
like Blessed bean, bean foreign legion, horde vanguard, etc.
---
and Horde the alliance is part of the Panfam coalition with Pandemic Legion and Northern Coalition.
---
and theres alot of movement from players between these groups. 
---
Goons and Legacy coalition have similar set ups as well.  but i'm only knowledgeable about Horde.
---
The population has been somewhat steady (if you consider the regular ups and downs of the different seasons through the year) for some time now.
---
If it's worth getting back or not will be up to you, but there's no harm in trying it out and see how it goes.
---
It's good if you make it good at this point. Gotta make your own content a whole lot just because risk adverse players don't want to fight nearly as much as they used to.
---
It is both as dead as it has ever been and as alive as it has ever been. 
---
You have no idea what was in the offgrid time era ?      
---
Basically with the old links each ship in your fleet was at least 40% more effective when compared to the same fitted ship without links.      
---
In some cases this scaled to insane values - this is why overproped ships where so popular.        
---
I still remember those Tengus that ceptors where unable to chase in some occasions :D
---
Are they using TS/Discord (would prefer Discord)? It wold be far more easier to learn through voice chat. I'll try to get in touch with them when I get home and probably start to move my stuff to their systems

YES me
---
&gt; out played in Rus Rus Prime by a US tz group
---
nice spin, as I see the heavy lifting is done by chinese groups, Goons and shoot first. Your group seems quite insignificant to the BRs
---
Off-grid links we're before my time. (POS were before my time. (Barely)) 
---
No this is promoting skill farms :D       
---
Cheaper omega by plex -&gt; cheaper account.        
---
Free 250k sp ? ... well that is a "free injector each 2 accounts you run". You have 3 ... well who cares. You have 200 ... look free SP to fill a 100 injectors !           
---
Why don't you play together? Like on one machine. Explore together, talk about the things you experience. Wouldn't that make for a better bonding than tossing her into Eve / a new corp? Plus you can monitor all the chatting etc. perfectly and teach her of all the different about online behaviour. 
---
(◕‿◕✿) my ragnarok will be coming out of build soon, can't wait to doomsday unsuspecting rorquals in the drones
---
The BRs often look like the alliance name is determining. They mostly outnumber the opponent ... with batphones ... and then complain that the russians call their brosefs too. Just take a look over how many groups this main chinese block of the attackers is split. Looks close to a NPSI-Fleet.
---
It don't work this way. CCP just gave sp to fill 100 injectors per 200 skill farm accounts you run. 
---
On top of module lag, there's missile travel lag that guns don't have to deal with. Also, I've heard stories that not all of the missile volleys register sometimes (due to some disconnect between the client and the server) but I cannot confirm that.
---
Noone is forced to map Thera. It's all voluntary. And yes, we have family friendly comms.
---
When I dealt with them in my earlier highsec industry days, it's usually because people don't want to. It's really weird, but I reached out to quite a few corps they had wardecc'd right next door to us and generally never received a response. They'd rather just log off than play station games all day and that actually makes a lot of sense after you do it for a while.
---
That titan drop though.... awesome!
---
To get the pods!
---
some people just struggle, various levels, english, life, coherent speech....
---
Ahh I get it now
---
Horde uses Discord for chat channels,  fleet formation pings, and q/a.
---
it has a website for a calendar for upcoming fleets.
---
and it uses mumble for fleet coms (both official fleets, new bro fleets, and q/a fleets)
---
we currently live in BWF, which is 2 jumps from highsec.  and close to jita.
---
though beware, the BWF gate is often camped by us(Chill/relax fleet) so, join the corp before moving in.
---
this. honestly, it makes sense from a business perspective: create demand -&gt; hey want sum plex fuccboii?
---
Squeakers usually get muted or kicked right away. Also, gullible kids are the dream target for every scammer and baiter. I doubt he will have a great experience in EVE.

You're late, git gud.
---
No agility, not sneaky and can't get into cynojammed systems easily. Also die in a fire to Supers. The idea is that these subcaps completely dumpster capitals but are vulnerable to other subcaps.
---
PLEX prices on the market aren't set by CCP they are directly related to market forces (with a little bit of player market manipulation going on). This means that the price of plex is directly proportional to how easy it is to make isk. If you can make 2b super easily you can super easily afford many more accounts putting more pressure on the plex market.
---
eve is becoming ever more beautiful with every passing iteration, it’s really great to see.

McAfee does copious amounts of cocaine.

Kinda? I'd roll with fuckhuge sig radius guns rather than tracking. Lets you run a propmod easier and makes it more difficult to kill subcaps.
---
Yeah and this increases the total amount of SP floating around. More supply -&gt; lower prices -&gt; skill farming is less profitable. Aren't SP farming margins already pretty low?
---

So stealth bombers then.

ah,  ok yeah that makes sense. i was thinking of isk spent.  didn't consider that hte isk is still in circulation.
---
good point.
---
These would kill capitals _much_ faster than Bombers. They can also exist on a field with logi instead of getting deleted.
---
No I jumped my two carriers in bc you were scream like a bitch boi begging to be saved, and lost both of them trying to help the moment asked with no questions because that's what you do when shit is going down. 
---
Also I've only lost one Blops ever. Do your due diligence like a good snufflet. 
---
I can't imagine being so pathetic, and full of myself to the point comparing my Titan loss to a single Blops loss. Especially, when you joined said persons Blops/hotdrop fleets nightly, so you could collect kms with 0 effort on your behalf. Wait you did need to press f1, and jump buttan. I suppose you deserve some credit for being a monkey.

Not sure why donvoted but it's true. Even the chepeast ones (caedes and the newish trig ones) should really be over 125b by now. It's the cruiser hulls that have had the biggest inflation in the past year or two, many of them well over doubled in average price sold.
---
yeah, he has. and he has it fully officer fit

It's not like reddit karma matters. Same with eve forum likes.

Over 24hrs after the fact and hes still in TNT, still set blue and from what I hear he and his buddies have been moving lots of supers/titans in the past day. But /u/querns_gsf is defending the guy so I guess we'll never know.
---
&gt;you're thinking of it backwards, like most people who reply to my comments do.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The price is higher because people didn't want to pay money for the same amount of assets, and are only willing to when the assets are significantly higher.
---
so that means there are people who start to pay money when plex prices rise? sounds like a win for CCP if the prices are higher then
---
Coming from a 17 year old, I can say this definitely depends on how your kids were raised. If they've been sheltered their whole life, then it may not be the best idea. But if they have decent comment sense and you keep a watchful eye on them until they get the hang of it, they'll probably be alright. As long as they're over 16. Idk if people younger than that are very fit for the unforgiving hellscape that is Eve Online
---
No. Not at all. For starters, they won't die if anything remotely spooky looks at them.
---
Second, 10 of them should absolutely overwhelm a FAX's reps, and absolutely shit on Carriers and Dreads. Conversely, they're near helpless against hostile subcaps.

Considering PLEX as a "thing" is over a decade old now and Eve timecodes could be sold for ISK on the eve forum for years before that makes me wonder when you think this "mature golden age" actually was.

So you want 2x Dread DPS, HAC tank, able to jump to a covert cyno (or nullified, I'm guessing, since the ability to get into cynojammed systems came up) with the ability to sneak around.

All you need is a handful of characters with tens of millions of SP, a support network willing to sell, deliver, and store dreads for you wherever you need them, and hours upon hours a day spent floating adrift in wormholes hoping someone rolls into you and YOU TOO, friend, can do solo PVP in EVE Online :)
---
It's easy :) :) :) :) :)
---
When you join a null alliance you leave the highsec life behind. Everything you need is available in your alliance's market hub, with much of it produced locally. If an item is not present you can special order it or you can use a neutral alt to buy it from Jita and contract it for JF shipment to your null home. Of course you will lose a few ships traveling around your null home due to inexperience. You will also learn to use cheap travel fits and to keep your training implants in the station. Losing ships is a normal and expected part of EVE, and in null your earning potential is more than enough to cover your losses.

oof'd. sorry? &lt;3

Free SP for omega, omega sale? You guys do know Q1 after this weekend? Seems like someone needs to get their quota?

Schrodinger's cat Experience
---
ah the southern deployments. yea we did fuck all with those except move stuff around the map.
---
Really? Because a good torpedo bomber wing deletes a carrier in seconds. Use those. Or use dreads. You're asking for op stuff instead of using the tools that the game already provides. 
---
Just remember when the time comes.... front to back...
---
Back to front is only acceptable when when blowouts occur and you're getting it off their back and head.

ADD PLEX MAINTENCE FEES. 5% OF CURRENT PLEX PRICE FOR EACH PLEX PER 24 HOURS
---
EG. 5,000,000 PER PLEX AT 5% COST A DAY IS 250,000 ISK PER 24HOUR PERIOD OF THAT PLEX. 
---
500 PLEX COST 125,000,000 ISK. WALLETS GO NEGATIVE IF NOT ENOUGH ISK OR SOMETHING
---

---
You should put it on something just to see what happens.
---
I think you fundamentally are misunderstanding the purpose of dreads or why PGL would say phoenix is a dog dread. Basing your argument on HAW's or 1337 small gang pvp streamers completely ignores the legitimate criticism of phoenix in blobwarfare. (And yes, dreads are a ship designed for blobwarfare. Just because some snowflake goes off and does snowflake things with dreads, does not make them anything other than a shipclass designed for blobage.)
---
It's been a few years but there used to be a guy in fweddit that had an imperial apoc. Not sure if he still has it tho as it was a long time ago. 
---
Stop your crying. Either quietly biomass in game and go away or STFU and buy a sub. Stop fueling a fire that doesn't exist. CCP doesn't OWE you the ability to play an Omega for free.
---
Free SP also promotes sales of extractors. 
---
Input broadcasting.
---
yep,  pretty much always is unless you get some currency arbitrage,  think some EU players saved a little buying plex from a US based re-seller at some point. 
---
That said I have a small plex stockpile so might as well add a few months now at 425 rather than the usual 500. 
---
In the AMA the CEO said he believes injectors are important to the new player experience to overcome the psychological barrier that they'll always be 10 years behind the vets.
---
So where is the solo?
---
Does the one thing known to spike plex prices
---
Dang, what is up with the fits? No damp maulus? Iniertial Stabilizer Baahl? All the lokis are different.
---
Who are we fighting? I dont really care but when can I start shooting?
---
&gt; Couldn't have rolled that without a big fight 
---
Can't you just dump a bunch of suicide Sigils in there? Super cheap and quite a lot of mass.
---
Love it. Rinse / repeat this move every couple months if plex stops climbing.
---
basically just random alcoholic that needs attention to stay alive
---
I don't control what other alliances do. But since we're talking about 'dank' playground rumours, give me names of idiots moving supers/titans and you will see more skull fragments.
---
Same here, though with the price going up I think we probably broke even.
---
Sorry for the delay, waiting for Vily to tell me what to type. Yes I am all over the map. I plan to make you shut up with my REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
There really isn't any way to "end them" - the wardeccing corps have no structures or assets, and they won't fight, they'll just dock up.  Ergo, all you can do is station camp them.
---
The new rules will change that to a degree, but I expect they'll figure out some way to still not fight and keep killing helpless targets.  That's what makes you elite, see?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! Dreddit is Recruiting. 
---
Welcome to the "dump" part of the pump and dump scheme that was extractors and injectors in the first place.  Their introduction inflated CCPs short term revenue at the expense of the long term viability of the game.  That was the "pump" part.  Then, they sold the company - the "dump" part.  
---
You think they give any fucks about the after-effects?  Bwhahahahha.  They've cashed out.  Their give-a-fuck ended on that date.  The game is going to go through all kinds of distortions and weirdness like "SP Farms" as it slowly winds down.  Don't expect much response to it.  Just try to have whatever fun you can in spite of it until the final curtain.
---
well yes but only in the short term, when the sale ends it will be a lot more expensive
---
I think you fundamentally are misunderstanding the purpose of dreads or why I would say phoenixes are great dreads. Basing your argument on Capital Guns or blob warfare completely ignores the legitimate use of the phoenix in smaller engagements. (And yes, dreads are a ship designed for all engagements. Just because some F1 monkey goes off and does F1 things with dreads, does not make them only a shipclass designed for blobage)
---
Nope. Remember sub cap insurance pay outs are no where near of cap / super insurance pay outs. In fact, if you get into serious Abyss farming insurance is so negligible its almost not worth the bother.
---
That would be pretty sweet =)
---
Or play as a Jovian. I'd love to see them bring back the Jove ships, they were awesome looking.
---
Porkbutte: Very true. Something I’ve abused with spies and also sorta admire at the same time is your open-door recruitment policy. Why did you decide to go with an open door recruitment policy and what makes you stay with it?
---
Gobbins: Most groups in EVE take for granted that API checks are a necessity but for a new player coming to the game they actually look pretty crazy – because they don’t understand the spy game and security issues. To many, API checks and elaborate application processes come across as some power trip by space nerds at best, and at worst a draconian practice that impinge on their privacy.
---
Not to mention, who wants to type out an entire application and then spend days sitting around waiting for an answer.
---
These days many newbies go to reddit and see the usual recommendations for newbie corps, so they apply to all 4. By the time other corps have processed the app, the newbie has already been accepted in horde for few days and likely getting settled.
---
That doesn't refute the guys post lol. It is still an is faucet.
---
Porkbutte: What sort of opportunities do new players have in Horde?
---
Gobbins: New players in horde can enjoy a facilitated start of the game by taking advantage of the free ships and skillbooks, the forum guides, the video guides, the skill plans, the internal help channels and the mentoring programs. They can also enjoy pvp from day 1 due to our daily dessie-down roams as well as the fact that all our doctrines include an option for alpha pilots (ewar frigs, t1 logi, ecc).
---
After passing the first hurdles, the corp also offers a path of progress that walks through several key doctrine ships and pve ships all the way to capitals. This includes an api-gated capital group and capital srp.
---
Truth to be told though, I think all the big 4 newbie corps do the above and do it pretty well.
---
One of the advantages of horde is that it’s designed to quick-start all the above for the minimal effort on behalf of the new player: no API required, no activity requirement, and low pressure in terms of external threats as well. Also Horde is particularly welcoming to new FCs since anybody is free to ping and run fleets from day 1.
---
The other advantage is that the entire alliance is designed around recruiting and training new players, rather than the new players corp being a part of a bigger entity. That means the whole agenda of PH can focus on new players.
---

Yes. Every time something related to Abyss comes into the game and people run more Abyss, all the related modules and the popular hulls rise in prices.

I am extremely unhappy about this sale. It's the opposite of what should be happening - we need to increase supply and reduce demand.  This was extremely bad timing.

not bitter, deep in enemy space seems amusing if you can bridge there from your own keepstar. Almost like, its actually not that far away

Can we just call the proxy war "Panda Express?"

Do so the countdown is only active if they account is plexed.

You're the one complaining about it you moronic dick muncher.

---
Come, play a little longer... 
---
It is always "THE Russian", you know that single one that craves communism, balalaikas and is hacking all of you ... XD.
---
Guess I found a redneck ....
---
shut up youre a tard biomass your account and delete yourself
---
IMO, whatever is going on with the markets, its trashing the game. At least for me. I havent logged on in a while and my accounts are all offline. 
---
Its just that simple. Im tired of paying $15 a month per account. SP farming was a way I could sacrfice my skills to fund a single account. which was great. but now its not worth it, either way I go. It costs hundreds of $ a month to play Eve ... or it costs tens of billions of isk... lol   
---
for whatever reason I fail to see the logic in this business model, provided you hoped to keep the company providing a service! 
---
I play star citizen now. Not to be harsh or anything, but its just a better value. If plex wouldnt rise above 1.5 bil and multi train certs wouldnt rise above 1.2 and skill extractors were 400-450 mil, injectors around 800-900 mil... a bil tops, it prevents needing 200 accounts, and those with 6 accounts will make just enought to play the fucking game... lol 
---
so here is my take. CCP sold Eve. They need money. They want people to buy plex online, rather than grind with alts, make some isk with pi farms sp farms and pve... to plex? I guess I get that. seems a failing company starving for $ would do just that. make the burger patties smaller, charge .25$ more every year for it. 
---
thats why people stop buying those products. its not so much the cost, but the VALUE... and to me, Eve's value has dwindled dramatically. I wont even come back to strip my sp from my main alts because its costs so much. its pointless to pay for something only to pay for something only to then pay for it again. I havent sent CCP a single dollar in over two years. because of this downward slope. and not only that, when we try to communicate to you to help you, keep the game rather alive like the good old days... we get trashed by the community and in help chat. so Im not surprised to see the prices as thy are. two months ago, I made 7 bil from m y24 character farm. which is really nice. could be better but I was working on it. now it COST 7 bil just to run the farm for one month. lol. ..   
---
so working as intended...? ok. I get you are trying to kill the game? or maybe ignorant to the fact that not everyone wants to or has the $ to play Eve how they want to, or how they can... fucking meet us in the middle at least ,damn. 
---
letting the players put a citadel in a system near the trade hub and rip the prices apart seems to me, at least to this degree, to only hurt the game. sure it makes those who have 200 accounts more money but it ruins the fucking game for everyone else. 
---
(No.)
---
literally nobody
---
Only bots say no
---
So if I stopped doing what I was doing and just spent money to die I could make a little money maybe? Because often my kill rights didn't get bought. So yeah in other words it wouldn't work at all or not be worth the risk.
---
So you want to take away something from other people just because you don't like how you can't buy every killright you want?
---
That seems fair. 
---
But I thought r/eve was a goon hive? :thinkplant:
---
oh look another "give me free kills" thread masquerading as a "botting fix" thread.
---
So Eve is pay to win now...

---
With 3k hp/s rattler you don't have much application left. If they come up with BS Abyss I guarantee you there will be entire rooms of nothing but small frigates + drones that will blow you up because of it. Remember rattlers bonuses apply only to heavies and sentries, so you'll either have to use distance + lineup or lose your small / med drones due to lack of HP bonus.
---
And when you have to line up a room full of small targets for 2-3 rooms in a row, even when you sucessfully kill them all, doing so will cost you time which will push you too close to the 20 minute total and eventually cause ship losses.
---
Not sure where you assume I'm from but I do beleave you to be mistaken. 
---
And let's be fair we all crave some balalaikas in our life. 
---
Then don't invite them to your Corp..? Sounds like a you problem
---
Plex isn't the problem. Isk printing is!
---
\&gt;  Aren't SP farming margins already pretty low? 
---
They are but they still exist. The difference is before you just ran as many characters on MCTs as possible. Now MCT price is pretty trash, and plex price the same.
---
Now you have to be a lot smarter to make isk, only buy extractors/plex on sales. Only sell at peak etc. And all of this requires a tonne of capital to work.
---
But yeah the moneys still there and the farms are still churning, it's just not as easy as it was in the 1st year of injectors.
---
The only reason Goons are relevant is because they can be farmed fairly easily by C and B tier FCs. That and they took the reproductive strategy of having as many numbers as possible \*shrugs\*. Bring 100 of your best goons and your best fc and back up fcs, to 100, well, however many we can bring because it prob wont be 100 0rigin. and you will see quickly that we brought more soldiers than you.
---
so waht your saying is....its a titan
---
If only it were vertical...
---
how not to meme 101
---
That's what I thought, just making sure (and stating it for anyone that thought the sale might mean otherwise).
---
You could buy GTC's with isk back then.
---
If you check the original post by Bluedagger that got downvoted to hell, it said in there that they happen to meet and allied up.
---
Did we strike a nerve? What if I suggest you shoot goons? Will you guys scream-cry again like you did at the Camal keepstar? 
---
I would love to have BS Abyss, but I think balancing them would be very difficult unless they disallow Marauders, or at least Bastion modules. Which in turn will land marauders in an even worse spot then they are currently :(
---
Also they would need to increase sizes of Abyss pockets to account for battleships longer range, otherwise you can kill everything from one end of the room to the other.
---
Wait.... A goon is saying mining vessels are boring? Is my narrative wrong? Help.
---

---
&gt;Good carrier char is below 20mil SP.Good super char is around 22-25mil sp.Good titan char is around 35mil sp.  
---
&gt;In the same range you get a T3\\T2 cruiser pilot.
---
This is exactly the problem, need to seriously raise the stakes on that both in SP and ISK costs. Make them lose SP like T3Cs or at least make the skill books tones more expensive.

What if they write a PVP bot?????

Please camp to get a chance to kill some titans or get a Molok BPC. Thx

The only time runescape was ever close to Eve online was around 2001-02 where it was pvp everywhere and you dropped everything on death. The only safe spots were in towns, and even then there were spots to kill people upstairs in castles and stuff.

Scamming, however has always been illegal in runescape, and they changed to wilderness pretty quickly because pvp everywhere was too hardcore.
---
Anyways I guess what I'm saying is that Eve is probably a much more harsh environment than the game that literally banned the word noob sometime in 05 or 06.
---
lol this is pretty great.
---
Why the hell do you care? We do care, but only a little. The numbers here are just too small to warrant any particular haste. Why don't you calm down about organizations you know nothing about?
---
I take it that you don't disagree with me that a monthly sub for less than 2b isn't bad in the current market.  I have been very public as to what my investments are. 
---
I mean, there's only so much intensity you can have clicking your weapon stack (or setting it to autofire), maybe occasionally having to shift priorities to a rat that came over and webbed you or one that's got you nullified, you know?
---
I'm sorry if I'm not super actively engaged with it and I'm diluting the EVE experience or whatever, but tbh I'm one of those people who finds it just fine, satisfaction wise, to crank graphics settings up to maximum and just kill one more mob.
---
Again, if there were an X3 or X4 TC for EVE, or CCP released a fully fledged single player only portion of it, I'd play that and leave y'all to it. But to iterate who and what kind of player I am: I'm the sort of person who enjoys RTSs... In the campaign mode, or maybe co-op/pve online. I don't like to compete online, because while I'm sure it's well within my grasp to reach those higher levels of gameplay... I don't want to spend hours of my time playing a single game - no, not playing, that's kind of my point? The characters and weapons and whatever become just surrogates for a floating stat sheet for some games, or just another thing to twitch-react to in others.
---
Cool to know those groups are still around. I was planning on solo play just because my friends aren't jumping back in and we play other games a lot. I figured I could still jump in and have some fun. I'll look into the groups to see what their activity requirements are. 
---
When I won, I left a bunch of stuff out in null so first up is figuring out who's out there and getting my stuff back.
---
It isnt an isk faucet because you dont get ISK from it.
---
It gives you modules that people buy with isk they already have.
---
it is a Mineral Sink/Rare module Sink though, as ships will die and the will NEVER go back into circulation
---
Just FYI, base64 is **encoding**, not encryption.
---
Might be harder to find? Nvr said my method is flawless but its a good start
---
Or even a T3C sub-system, that would raise the risk due to T3C skill loss and the ISK costs vs regular stealth bombers.
---
That makes perfect sense. I hadn't considered all of the balance decisions that went into that. 
---
No you get a very good cash from your SP farm. 
---
Oh for sure I don't disagree. I merely commented that your intentions are probably not as altruistic as your selected language would imply.
---
It's not, I just happened to see it when I opened zkill yesterday.
---
Marry me StainGuy
---
not sure what you are asking, but i still have my interbus shuttle from way back when i bought an  eve copy in a store 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
I wasn't trolling tho
---
well yeah, its progod, if he calls for dreads the odds of it being heavy tidi are pretty high
---
Ok cool. Thanks don't really care who is better. 
---
Too many don't have enough PG / CPU left if they fit 100 MN, for a full array of weapons etc. and most importantly don't have enough cap to operate 100 MN for long enough. Though if they become dedicated to bombs, perhaps they wouldn't need as much.
---
Komodo BPC any one?
---
Props to the bomber pilot that killed my brand new covops in the first site i warped to
---
also what is hydex?
---
Same
---
After reading BR in detail i am baffled, as it seems that there is really the big blue donut happening. The attacking side shows following groups:
---
- ShootFirst / V.O. (parts of so called Lowsec voltron with SG and SC)
---
- Imperium with full Hurri-Fleet
---
- FRT-aligned large chinese corp Infinity Avenger
---
- PanFam aligned groups like PHEW/PL/ARTON
---
Maybe rekkincruski did kill to much travelling Supers of all groups that they decided to work together ?
---
That's UpperCamelCase or PascalCase
---
leonardo dicaprios voise explaining shit from wolf of wall street works fine.
---
Yup. And that is actually simple to achieve, just make a module that enables to fit XL weapons with some tracking penalties as well as PG / CPU sink if needed.
---
The best part is that r/eve thinks we cared about the fort...once one of our forts go down, there are 2 more to replace it. 
---
We want good content and good fights. Not a bunch of mouth breathers shitting up local and pressing f1 while they watch MLP. 
---
We want BOT to fight us and actually prove they deserve space. But instead they cried rape to big daddy and cant handle the heat when we do the same. 
---
He said Elite PvP LOL
---
The other day a good friend of mine gave me a lot of this hangar stuff after shutting down his EVE accounts. It's amazing the number of random forgotten items left lying around from a decade ago.
---
Get a hobby buddy
---
That would be the perfect function for BLOPS. BLOPS need a lot of love right now and need to come down in costs and something like this along with a cost decrease would really help them out and give them a good dedicated role.
---
I put my money where my mouth is:  [https://i.imgur.com/Ai7u54l.png](https://i.imgur.com/Ai7u54l.png) and  [https://i.imgur.com/HQnMpoI.png](https://i.imgur.com/HQnMpoI.png) 
---
I don't think being one of the "big bois" makes a difference. Low-class groups that bring content will be few and far between if you keep pushing them out (that goes equally for "the big bois").
---
How do you find these. I love you
---
this is kind of my hobby, look people abusing broken spawn seed will come and cry that they cannot run them safely and quietly 
---
Detroit?
---
Marry Me
---
Its sort of both, with module and some hull inflation on top. 
---
I have a bot ....
---
Difference between killing a PVE fit Carrier vs a PVP one.
---
Crawling through filtered zkill is your hobby?
---
I wont judge
---
you do realize some of those huge skill farms are the massive cloaky campers that will blanket a region or two?
---
Happy Easter, Fucking Aye!
---
shut up
---
What about people who use multiple emails?
---
Most of the reading I do is by authors that know how to convey a point.  You should learn from them.  
---
I'm not surprised that you're picking incoherent arguments with internet strangers, seeing as I can't imagine you having a single drop of personal communications skills.  Is this the most human interaction you've had in days?  
---
Creatures like you should be sterilized at birth.
---
I was there. Never recall anyone doing that. Also it wasn't a market item. Anyway. The class of player is shit now. I don't play anymore. So it's a moot point.
---
They should write a bot that makes Chinese cartoons
---
Indeed! But what I meant is that Base64 was chosen as the encryption key to hide a message. Anyway, not arguing against you.
---
Supers and Rorqs die all the time in Delve. You just can’t hur dur in with a bunch of f1 monkeys and expect a free shiny kill mail. 
---
You would go on the forum, and buy the gtc for isk. The moot point is thinking there were tons of capitals around for someone to have 30 back then.
---
Wow, your super invested in this one ain't ya...? 
---
Yes lots of people hate the Russians.. 
---
Yes lots of people see a fort final timer as a great chance to get in on some fights. 
---
Yes there is more than one group that would like to see the russians lose there fort.
---
Yes people all decided to work together to make sure they lose the fort.
---
Do you need your hand held threw the rest of it or do you just want to make another 14 asinine comments about random shit you come up with? 
---
you do realize a large bomber fleet may have 100k+ dps....
---
All words are made up.
---
Looks to me like ship schematics, possibly with manufacturing / operational instructions.
---
The system was better back then . Didn't have plex and didn't have injectors. Less capital proliferation. Golden Years. Good luck with CCP 😆
---
Ehhhhhhhh from a technical standpoint, ibwould say it's still just encoding. But it's semantics at this point. Now decode the message since I'm at work lol. I want to know what it says
---
The Mittani: [In an animated voice] Selling supers and titans outside of The Imperium will not be tolerated, if it is found out that you are doing it, you will be instantly kick, blacklisted, and not be able to state your case.

Goonswarm linemembers: shockedpickachuface.jpg
---
I've been in Goons my entire EVE existence, and now I see why everyone calls leadership spinmasters.
---
I imagine it will be 1 fighter with spool up damage.  Carrier will also retain tig line native bonuses of smartbomb cap use,  Remote rep and cap transfer range bonus'.  and hopefully a smaller mass!  (Wormholer btw)
---
&gt;Anyone have stories to share about something they lost in Eve?
---
Last illusions about people...
---
I'm seeing a BR with a dozen+ ships on one side and 5 on the other side. Did you link the wrong BR?
---
&gt; **Yes but only if PVP battleship 1v1 thunder abyss dome battles can happen** 
---
Pretty sure if they do this there will be a PvP gate to a PvP room just like there is now. No reason not to be.
---
Very low-throughput ISK printers.
---
With 3 chars and level IV skills, you can make not quite 1B/mo making nanite repair paste. That's selling the paste at Jita prices, maybe you can do better someplace else.
---
^ that's Dunk for ya
---
You do know that I'm just a line member, right?
---
I'll chime in as someone who does a little PLC on the side (so compsci majors feel free to correct me). A multiplex (or mux) takes multiple inputs and sends it to a single output, or in this case a demux takes a single input and sends it to multiple outputs. It's different than a simple macro cause you can set up functions. For example you'd want all clients flying A ship to do action/script X while all clients fly B ship to do action/script Y.
---
Hopefully your last.
---
Security?
---
skilling yourself in karma farming i see
---
15 seconds vs 20-30 seconds. They all die like flies. Faxes crack in seconds. Supers die before reps land. 
---
Besides, if you really want to kill a pvp fit carrier nice and dead, use dreads.
---
Edited in that it's encoding so no wrong info about technical terms is spread. :)
---
This thread's done. Move along.
---
Most big alliances are going to be using Mumble/Teamspeak becuase of the shear amount of people that can be on a fleet. Discord doesn't do that great with 200+ people in it
---
They can’t wardec unless they HAVE a structure. Gotta find it and bash it. 
---
I have no problem posting on, at least i get positive karma unlike you ;-P ...
---
&gt; Yes lots of people hate the Russians.. 
---
out-of-game redneck sentiments?
---
&gt; Yes people all decided to work together to make sure they lose the fort.
---
seems like it was necessary
---
i plexed yesterday. FML
---
Imagine this for bumping freighters in Uedama. ;-)
---
It wont lower the cost by increased supply, SP, extractors, and injectors are still tied to the cost of plex.
---
&gt;......sounds like a great thing for the economy.  
---
&gt;Is he sarcastic?
---
It is good for economy. Only T4s and T5s have a good payout, T1, T2 and T3 are crap with T3 borderlining on L4 level income pending on huge RNG. 
---
Only T1s and some T2s can be botted / AFKed, the decent ones can not and it will be hopefully a long time before they can. So to earn good ISK from Abyss requires good and active gameplay.
---
Its a guaranteed loss of minerals and other resources, whatever ship and module construction uses. Its a profit for indy guys some of whom are hurting. I'm sure there are other benefits, these are just the ones of the top of my head.
---
Will require training into battleships, thus SP sink for a lot of people. And battleships are a lot bigger SP sink then cruisers.
---
Also its actually some fun, unlike most other PvE stuff in the game.
---
Automated repeaters. Deviant Automata \^\^ 
---
haha awesome
---
I look forward to seeing you guys in Toronto!
---
SP farms will die when the market for Skill Injectors collapses to the point that it doesn't return sufficient profit to cover the PLEX of maintaining them. So long as there is a faucet of new players willing to spend tons of ISK to boosh into Titans, Rorqs, etc. then the market won't crash even if the price of PLEX rises further.
---
I would love any reason to bust out my dusty old golem
---
&gt;and the losses slow down to only d/c loses or tier 4/5
---
Its more then few weeks. According to what they said its steady under 10% and they said they're happy with it.
---
.
---
For his ass? 
---
Ran out of materials? Tis fine. Just another day in the Minmatar shipyards. 
---
So much salt in these posts, keep it up /u/stainguy 
---
Only this sub could see a sale as a truly awful thing. 
---
LOL
---
You might actually, truly sell that as a collectors item :D
---
That is indeed a very unique roll.
---
Tell me more. We killed literally 8 of last 10 supers.
---
which means we should up the PLEX price to 5.339.976,34 ISK so it will be at least the same feeling :D
---
Yeah well safety in numbers right?
---
...combined?
---
So you're just a linemember, but you know enough to be able to say leadership does't care enough to research this quickly? 
---
&gt; I did the ELITE PVP thing years ago. I play the game with a group of people I can have fun with.
---
Implying we're not having fun? Just because you enjoy sitting in the quiet room on mumble because the sperg in local is unbearable doesn't mean the rest of the game wants to watch their brains slowly try to escape from their heads, too. 
---
If he had stuff, he could sell it for PLEX ... 
---
It's still cheaper, in real money, to just by a 30 month sub than buy Plex and sub through NES
---
Better yet: CCP we need to enter a post plex era! Lack of plex will solve all our problems
---
We'll take ya
---
Do we need a post every single time?
---
Yep. It's called actually being a part of the organization being discussed. You are not, so you lack this form of command.
---
Its still a large suppliment though, what remains is too easy to make. Need the difference to get higher.
---
&gt;making 2b is easier now than ever
---
Just got back to the game, mind explaining why this is?
---
Love the salt. Next...
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75937628/
---
u can be sad again
---
Looks complete to me
---
And where exactly is this being discussed? Because as a goon linemember I don't see any public threads about it.
---
How would you fix it? Delay before you can be jumped again? Don’t see how this gene can be put back in the bottle without pissing off a ton of people. Perhaps if it didn’t work within some area around structures or a module that prevented it in the area 
---
What about opportunities for romance with the Triglavians? Has anyone given any serious consideration of that opportunity?
---
I enjoy reading a PIRAT billion dollar killmail
---
Don't lie. Or, if you're going to lie, at least do so in a vaguely believable fashion.
---
No worries, get some duct tape, bubble gum and some bondo, you'll be just fine.
---
I mean I didn't do the math for the giant plex packages, but at that point you could probably do a multi month sub for less.  
---
it's mostly a gift to the players with plex stockpiles and the first players to notice as prices spike every time they do this deal, maybe a slight discount to the ones that log in later but the price spike largely cancels that out. 
---
Is there a difference between null sec corps and daycare?
---
Let be drop off my ~~rorqual bot~~ kid for the day and come back after work
---
If I have a semiosis conductor do I need to do something special to get the mail? 
---
&gt;This would negate most of the issues at hand?
---
Yes. But it would destroy the original purpose of skill injectors. Remember their original function is a "catch up" mechanic. the problem is that the game has no way to determine who is an alt and who is jsut a SP farmer and who is a legit new player or a legit player wanting to simply experience something in the game that he/she has not had a chance to do before. 
---
It is impossible for the game to make this sort of determination. But whatever changes they would need to make, need to preserve that original function / purpose.
---
and the single stack ICY sell order of 580.000
---
You need to log in 3 different days over the 4 day long event to claim all the SP.
---
Hang on a sec. So you can VNI rat, which is considered low-effort...and you can hunt VNI ratters...which I would argue is actually high effort since you have a 10-15 second window to scan them down. And because they can't fight back if they get caught (they can, hello light drones on my retribution) its considered low effort?  
---
Noone is saying these are high quality duels where the better pilot wins. But saying someone trying to make it at least risky to VNI rat is "low effort" is disingenuous. Not to mention FUCK botting...so if someone is making the effort to try to kill them, that is also not "low effort".  
---
It's frustrating to fly through Branch or Detorid or a half dozen other regions and see 5-6 VNIs in each system that instantly pull drones and warp the second you come in to local.
---
If any of them probably the Freki, I think its generally considered the most useless AT ship although I haven't heard anything since ADCs got added, but I don't think that would make that much of a difference.
---
Oh so if I log in on the 3rd day I only get the first reward? And also 4 day long event??
---
its been such a good week! got my first solo kill while hunting hostile space in a t3c, talked with some wonderful people in provi in local (they are nice), and went on an amazing meme fleet that managed to kill an actual fleet.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75937806/  there you go
---
can I have your stuff?
---
I think I said a "cum guzzling cunt canoe" at one point but yeah as the test guy said. 'literally nobody'
---
It's not hard. It's only a couple of tabs if you know what you're looking for.
---
What do you think I'm lieing about? Wait, do you actually believe my flair?
---
&gt;so here is my take. CCP sold Eve. They need money. They want people to buy plex online, rather than grind with alts, make some isk with pi farms sp farms and pve... to plex? I guess I get that. seems a failing company starving for $ would do just that. make the burger patties smaller, charge .25$ more every year for it.
---
Check out  [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/concluded-2019-03-28-live-ama-with-ccp-hellmar/149100](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/concluded-2019-03-28-live-ama-with-ccp-hellmar/149100) to give them some credit. They are modernizing the game and specifically stated that this year is focused on things such as 64 bit engine migration, server tech, etc. which has to be done. All deep "under the hood" work, and also stated that bigger content releases will be back next year.
---
&gt;  It was used successfully against us. 
---
&gt;!Does it really count as being used successfully when you didn't even try to fight it? At lease holesale tried.!&lt;
---
The problem here is that you think the problem is chain booshing. It isn't. 
---
The HK keepstars died to the second thing you commented about, and so did this fortizar. Whether its 1000+ vs 200+, or 200+ vs 50+ the end result is the same. 
---
&gt; N+1 
---
This eviction could have been accomplished in many other doctrines, does that make them broken too? Of course it doesn't. 
---
# Small minds will always lash out at what they do not understand. 
---
There not AT ships or even that rare, but if anyone is interested in an actually affordable little collectors ship, there are a set of limited edition pirate corvettes that go for 700mil-1bil depending and have some fun bonuses and unique designs. I believe they have been occasionally given out at Eve meet up events for small tournaments or other things.
---
I’m just trying to learn about these myself. I’ve gained insight. Thanks tho 
---
Well this was quite in time so all the SP farm bigbois that had usubbed a lot of their Accs that were solitary used as farm can now resub with discount and get free SP to fill injectors. This will be a very profitable farming month.
---
We do not talk about the people that extract the SP from their Rorqual Alts every month as collateral profit so they just have to add some 100 Mil ISK to plex-sub them.
---
hey thats me!
---
Ain't no party like a Detroit party..
---
I might be reading it wrong, UTC isn't my timezone and timezones make my head hurt. But yes if you only log on once on the third day you only get the first one.
---
Flairs have nothing to do with it.
---
With 22 booshers, you can cycle almost non stop, giving your battleships the average speed of 17.3km/s
---
Don't forget to make yourself a 2nd account with a neutral alt somewhere in HS. Just park it there, best in or near Jita and log it on once in a while to train it as far as it will go up to 5 mil SP. It will come in handy.
---
So it is too large to be a dreadnought?
---
A shopping 10% off! 
---
Then what am I lieing about?
---
Your Mom 😂
---
Small balls. 
---
Take a fleet of 200 in delve and go kill rorquals
---
Works fine.  It is a mechanic that has its niche uses and can be countered (hence why it isn't use on every fight).  
---
I've read about this, but I kinda fail to see how would this benefit me. Can you give me some examples?
---
I also heard that if I join the Horde, I will have negative rep with Caldari and therefore other players will be able to kill me in Caldari space (mainly around Jita) without penalty and therefore I won't be able to go near Jita with my main.
---
Did I understood that correctly?
---
Do they not learn from their mistakes? Isnt this like the 5th time or so?
---
lots of stuff, eve is safer, everyone can be in caps etc. Its more a combination of everything CCP have done than one single change. 
---
carrier is around 150m pr hour, 13 hours to plex
---
supercarrier is 300m pr hour,  7 hours to plex
---
incursions in a bs is 100m pr hour, 20 hours to plex
---
rorqual is 100m pr hour and it literally can not die, and you can save 50% of the value in a wetu, 20 hours to plex
---
add PI on top of that which makes at least 500m per month with around 10 minutes of work each week plexing shouldn't even take a weekend of playing for new bros. 
---
I make around 400m per day by running VNIs while working. All i need to do is press warp and orbit 2 times pr hour
---
OK look, one of the drops is straight up an item you sell to an NPC for is, that *is* a faucet.
---
However, the question is -- how much of the value of the sites is paid out this way? If it's less than is being destroyed, it's *not* an isk faucet (though it could still be profitable).
---
Cringe from your post aside, that's not the case in this specific eviction. I have a hard time thinking we could have beat the fort with a different fleet without cap support. 
---
But sure, go ahead and insult the OP with that super cringe line that you even bolded. Like, jesus christ dude, not only you're not helping but being a massive cringelord in the process
---
It wouldn't break this. As the limit would only be on the extracter and not the injectors. And it would be account based. So each account has a 3 month cool down on omega with the cool down paused on alpha. 
---
Booshing should have side effects like drugs hp range teacking speed. Speed. 
---
its not even bad, its just sad. 
---
Your affiliations. You're being disingenuous to the point of mustache-twirling comedy. Try it on someone else, please.
---
I have no idea who Gelvon is and why his ideas would be good for the game. You saying that suggestion was made in good faith?
---
&gt;That is what happens if CCP listened to and implemented every single smooth brain idea rolling around out there
---
Why would they implement every idea?
---
It is also the case that the game wouldnt be totally broken because of injectors if they had listened to the community. So maybe it would work out in the end.
---
&gt; N+1 **finally** came to wormhole space. 
---
:THONKING:
---
about the same it was a year ago.  Been pretty much steady for the last few years.  
---
or it died like 5 years ago and this is all a dream.  fuck if i know. 
---
I miss my EVE Capsuleers and being part of the community!  I think it's time to come back online and see all the changes that have been made since logging off for the last time back in 2017!

Do people still spam local hisec local w/ recruitment chatter? lol
---
Lowsec, bestsec.

(mostly due to no gate to stain) 
---
one of the worst comps to fly or to fight against. its just boring and doesnt encourage fights..
---
but hey, its eve 2019..  only mining and pve is interesting nowadays...
---
At least I turned up. Unlike half your corporation.
---
Why do you think I'm lieing about my affiliations? All I've said about it is I'm a goon linemember and can't find any threads about this in any goon public forum to back up your claims. Tbh you just seem like you're backpedaling a lot right now. The only disingenuous person is you.
---
What’s the reason for them giving us free skill points btw?
---
Shhh dont complain about free sp
---
Only jump locked targets. Still useful for small gang, it can still be used to jump off specific targets, but no longer have cancer chain booshing that has very limited counters. To compensate, you void increase the number of locked targets for command dessies. 
---
I think they "Greyhaired Squadron" would have awesome numbers in EVE XD
---
No, they're just sent to people in possession of the proper console - perun mails get sent to those with the perun console, etc.
---
RACE WARS!
---
I know, your gf told me last night 😂
---
She prefers mine 😉
---
I would love to see some Abyssal sites that are Mass governed. Maybe there was just enough mass to get a single battleship in, and players would have to compose a fleet to handle it. 
---
I'd have to dust off the mass numbers, but it would allow for a pretty cool small gang activity and pvp, making up a bunch of unique fleet comps ~ like a mini AT.
---
Triglavian Shipyards, in WH space, please.
---
Haha I’m not, Im genuinely curious because I was confused when I logged on today.
---
Pogue Was.
---
He's so slippery it's like holding a greased up eel.
---
Oh if you knew anything about that fight it wasn't an armor fight when it started.  That fight had been going for a couple hrs by the time CVA "responded" with at least 3 waves of ships and 2 waves of griffins.  Some of us who had been fighting in it from the start where bringing or there in whatever we had left.  When you have people fighting for you like that alienating them at the end of it like that is a slap in the face.
---
... yes?
---
i love it. its like a new pornstar. please more.

*MULTI-BOOSH DRIFTING*
---
&gt;so that means there are people who start to pay money when plex prices rise?
---
Fewer people are willing to buy it at the low price, and the only way to get them to buy is by making the price higher, but you're losing total overall market value
---
I'm from a 3rd world country. $$ is really expensive rn. I can blaze and plex 5 accounts with like 3 weekends of blazing so why not. Though if plex goes to 2.5 it will just be too much of a hassle to grind and lll leave to go back to rl. 
---
When you join a larger corp you will most likely be wardecced vast majority of the time. Which means buying / selling stuff on the games main markets will become a PITA and / or you will get yourself blown up while moving your stuff from place to place. Though Horde or any decent corp / alliance has logistics set up, there will be times when its better to just do it yourself.
---
So what most of us do is have a marketing alt to sell/buy all our crap without falling victim to the wardecs. 
---
In addition, it can get very difficult to do market stuff on only 1 character. For example, you make a sell order for 30 days or so and need to come adjust the price every 2-3 days. Instead of having to make trips to HS or Jita, you can just simply switch to your other character or account and not waste clone jumps which in some cases can waste your clone jump cooldowns or destroy implants.
---
When you make such an alt, I recommend going Caldari, and do some very basic missions on it of whatever type for Caldari Navy, jsut to bring up your faction standing a bit. Then park it in or near Jita 4-4.
---
Going further down the line, in the future you may decide on making this into an indy or hauling or full trade whatever else character and you will have it ready to go. So its just an overall good idea to do this. Making it on a seperate account is also better then a 2nd character because again in the future, you may decide to have both of them be omega state and this way you can log them on both at the same time, whereas if they are on same account, you can not.
---
Angostura called, they want their bitters back.

Cool sarcasm, or you could just go to systems where there are war targets and look? 
---
So difficult, I know.

Lol would you like a gold star?

Ok baiting your troll post.

Rorqual mining 1$/h ... so mining on 30 rorquals is like 30$/h.   
---
8h*30$ give us 240$ - this is more than people can make in a whole month in some poor countries. 
---
I just redeemed mine.
---
They're items in your account's redemption queue you then can apply to any character under the account.
---
They have an 180 day expiration to redeem, but once they're applied to a character they won't expire.

rightclick that shit in ur mission log and press skip tutorial
---
I mean, there was a risk, but all signs point to a long-term upward trend in PLEX prices: CCP no longer needs to artificially boost their financial reports, hence PLEX sales will be way less common than they used to be (in fact, they're doing it the other way around with this promotion, which is smart), and people running skill farms and the like still need PLEX to run their business.
---
All in all, it's quite a simple equation really, but people usually panic and dive in/jump out without understanding the item they're investing in.
---
Meh the game ain't it worth its easy to make isk anyways
---
Just adapt. 
---
Umm okay? lol what does that random, unrelated sentence prove?  
---
I brush my teeth every morning.
---
\^ I can make random unrelated statements too lmao.
---
&gt;And I explained several times that you can't just cyno jam whole systems based on broken fw mechanics.
---
It wouldnt be "jammed", it would be by default. If CCP were to make this the case, it would be so.
---
FW matchanics are not broken in relation to cynos. Cynos are broken.
---
&gt;If you can't learn to activate an accereration gate or using range to avoid cynos then other non-fw players shouldn't be penalized because of it.
---
You cant avoid a cyno on a gate.
---
FW players shouldnt be punished because some people want to abuse cynos and drop a ton of shit on everything.
---
You killed a fort with 183 people you dopy fuck.  Happens all the time with a less then a 3nd of those numbers.  Come back with a better reason why you should be the only group allowed to n+1 in W space.
---
Says the guy who put up a 2.7 trillion isk sell order in plex and is now hyping CCP’s 425 plex omega sale in order to cash out as much as he can while the price is still high and this weekend is likely to be peak demand at these prices.
---
I understand. Quick question: what does "wardecked" means?
---
Triglav Iapethan
---
Lol, nice
---
To be honest bro you should delete this and repost with better context. we all make mistakes
---
I don't know. The main issue as I see it is that injectors are already too expensive for newbies while too cheap for existing long term players. Putting up such limitations would raise the prices so high that they would become completely out of newbie reach. Be unachievable. Imagine having to spend 1 month worth of plex for a single large injector. 
---
isk generation in this game has become trivial for a lot of established groups, with all sorts of possible sources available. plexing some if not all the accounts isn't a huge deal for them
---

I can say I am an proud owner of one out of first 5 given Vanquisher BPC's from 2016 when CCP started with faction titans.
---
it's ME10 TE10 and handcrafted by devs per CCP Falcon words for Shadow of the Serpent event winners.
---
I am no Entity but atleast my wish of owning something rare is real, maybe after all these years it's the only one left in BPC form.
---
Well, there's a lot of things you can do with an Alpha clone...
---
this is a dumb idea, just limit the amount of time between jumps, the mechanic already exists that says "if you jump x time must pass before this module is ready again", just extend that to "if you are jumped"
---
i have no contibution, just here to lol.
---
YES!
---
Only you sir. I dont sit in the quiet room, I listen to all the sperg with my pants off and lights on.

Man you really hate Test? What did Test do to you, did we take away your favorite dildo or maybe you dont like us cause we are "so bad" and it insults your  LEET PVP way of life?
---
This, also there are people who can afford to afk-mine or rat during work or something (like Sysadmins). Sadly there are enough tools now to be 99% safe even while afk 
---
Sp farming
---
Waste of dps because of missile flight time.
---
10 second delay would be workable to be honest.
---
Chain booshing is only an issue because multiple booshes allow you to act in a way where your opponents cannot counter you.
---
With 10s cd, it's enough to change how spear fishing will work, and it puts gangs like Stukas at risk again, since once they hit that first boosh, they are locked to a specific area for a time.
---
Is CCP going to be happy or sad that I've got years of omega time now? I used thousands of months-old plex from galaxy packs and plex sales to buy up a bunch of omega time. Now I won't be any income for CCP for YEARS while they still are paying for the infrastructure for me and folks like me to play on.
---
Do you think they're wisely investing the money they made a year ago when this Plex was purchased to keep the game healthy for the next few years? Lol.
---
Scamming may have been illegal but it wasn’t enforced. Scamming in RuneScape was just as rampant when I played (02-07) as it was in EVE. And both games have full loot PvP with PvE avenues that are full loot but still mostly safe from players. The only way 
---
Structure aggression should be a scram instead of point. Booshes should also break locks on successful booshes.
---
goons deployed a shit load of faction forts in 1dq, its like a museum 
---
Are they? I'm subbed for years now. Why would I buy more plex any time in the foreseeable future?
---
Shit thats almost exactly what i get paid monthly rn.. it was more like 550 before my country currency crashed and now i have 3 accounts i cannot afford to sub nor can i pay for it with plex couse i dont have more than a couple hours to play some days
---
The problem is quantity. Needing a dozen or more ships for one cap is bad enough, throw in a FAX and they can be nigh indestructible against all but the largest subcap fleets. And when you're dealing with an enemy that can throw half a dozen or more caps with full FAX backup, you create an environment where it's difficult if not impossible to live in null without bending the knee to some higher power.

I am honestly confused how can you breathe.
---
They did say just a few days ago in that AMA on the official forum, that player retention under 30 days old is their biggest issue. 
---
The 2nd thing is that too many players leave the game due to being turned off by all the multiboxing etc. So while this group is smaller, it is the one that is closest to becoming long term regular customers, possibly even whales, hence its important.
---
&gt; Small minds ... do not understand.
---
Sums up your meta knowledge very well
---
No, but when your enemy parks three supers in your home system and keeps them logged off, you should have some expectation of posing at least a slight threat.
---
Holy fuck the EvE community is getting old. 
---
I plex because it requires maybe 15min of activity a month, and, while I can afford to pay $40/mo for the game without issue if I wanted to maintain 2 paid accounts (what I would consider the minimum), I don't play enough to justify that expense, especially given how trivial it is to plex.
---
Is that 1 fucn guy

You're awesome be

Man, I got student loans looking into my bank statements, I can't justify dumping a bunch of money into a video game when I ask them to keep me on an income based repayment plan. Anything beyond my main requires the grind.

That's the thing people arent getting. Hyde does not deploy or fly with us, and he has nothing at all positive to say on reddit (or on comms) about TNT's membership and ops. We dont care what he's up to any more than he cares about us.

Gotta book those active numbers for the glorious Korean overlord.

---
Replacing extractors in the store with injectors would solve the issue more elegantly than a simple cap on omega alts.
---
The issue is that Omega Time is a form of capital and extractors are giving it away for "free" and this is rapidly raising player productivity as SP is being redeployed to maximize ISK making potential. People will continue to "SP farm" at a loss because Omega Time has inherent productive value.
---
Pretty much just describes capsuleers they are seeing in the abyss. Augmented people with allegiances to a variety of different societies. Next evolution of sampling in interesting though, wonder if that means we'll see some new stuff in the abyss.

---
Again, though, it takes maybe 20-25 players to take a super at best, maybe 30 average players in a fleet with a half-decent FC. Add a FAX and that number goes up to \~50, easy.
---
Now throw in an enemy that can field a dozen of these things at once with full FAX support. How many alliances in the game are capable of fielding 600 guys at once?

I was in TNT when he left and he was in our channel a lot (STL). When he left most people had nothing good to say about him, including our guys who were the ones producing all of these cheap ships for him. Dude just left randomly one day and was always super toxic in the fleets he did lead, so I don't think anyone really cared.

Well I'm going to stop responding... you clearly don't know what your talking about.

Peace and love. 
---
Yea, but see that's not the right narrative, so it didn't happen. And if it did happen, it doesn't matter.
---
He doesn't know pepelaugh
---
The issue is not the farming of SP itself, it's that Omega Time is valuable. Imagine you have an account with 3 characters with all maxed ISK generation on it, and the main of that account can fly a rorqual/carrier. 
---
That account will generate billions of profit per month and you'll gladly pay a few hundred million post-extraction to run it. Meanwhile, a new player belt rattin in a myrm to buy a PLEX is long, long gone.
---
Extractors are the issue, extractors must go.
---
Well he's not wrong that there is a major psychological barrier. Probably 9/10 people I've ever tried to get into Eve have been defeated by the pretty much instant determination that they could never "catch up", despite my best faith attempts to convince them otherwise.
---
boosh fatigue as described above, knowing that it only applies to players, not drones/unpiloted ships/bubbles

Just Like i like my women

You are right, in my 13 years of EVE and 4 years in Aridia I literally learned nothing about the guys there XD

Then that it's your fault get good. 😁

---
Yes, asking in jabber, because Goonswarm has such stellar record when it comes to dissent. Nobody is concern trolling you, and the fact that you think that is what is going on just proves how much of a defensive idiot you are. 
---
You say you are apart of the discussions about this incident and also claim to be just a linemember, so that would mean the discussion is in a public forum, like helldump, or maybe one of the EVE - General forums, something that another goon linemember would be able to access but there are no threads about this. So you are either lieing about just being a linemember, or you are lieing about this incident being discussed (which is even worse)
---
You say my affiliations are not with goons, but you have provided zero proof of the contrary.
---
So after all this back and forth, we are at back at square one, other than you making yourself look like a moron, this conversation went nowhere and my origion points stand, which is the rules only apply to peon linemembers like myself, and once you become a CEO of a corp or are rich enough, the rules don't apply.
---
Feel free to prove me wrong on any of my points, but unless you actually bring proof of your claims, this conversation is pointless.
---
I'll preface my response by saying that I agree with you.
---
However we aren't in a perfect economic climate where a person can turn around and donate 1 hour of their time in real life to immediately generate currency, which they can then use for their actual desires.
---
Sadly a lot of people who are unable to pay subscriptions don't have the RL capability to bring in that extra money on a whim. They therefore end up with blank, unallocated time, that they choose to apply to games.
---
It's also a question of return on time invested. If you hate your job, you may not want to spend more time in it than necessary. But boring mining sessions may still be made interesting if you have friends you are hanging on comms with while watching shows together, etc.
---
I missed the AMA to ask this, but did CCP ever attempt to add ship trees, similar to the current ones in-game, for all these AT, Conscious thought &amp; Other 'Special' ships? 
---
Missions, specifically burners.  
---
Yeah, even in you did implement that, everyone and their mother would try to get around it, might as well allow it.
---
Ask yourself what kind of person joins Pirat...
---
They are the kind of person that goes up to the down syndrome kids at school and bullies them.

Or picks the smallest kid and decides to bully him, they probably aren't very bright.
---
"FRT-aligned"
---
lol,  thank you for your overstating
---
Here is one for you... try justifying more than a pair of accounts to a spouse on a real money subscription basis.
---
Then throw in the fact that as long as you have \*an\* account in omega there are other factors that make supporting other accounts easier.
---
What's your point? You're complaining about N+1 in your first post but now you gloat about outforming us, on a blue OP of all things?
---
Why are you like that? 
---
Wasn't there some +15% all stats super-mod(s) that dropped from a GM piloted Eidolon (Jove) battleship wayyyyyyyyyy back in the day?
---
I'm sure those are still floating around somewhere.

Ya, it's not a daycare center, but that's what can make it a useful tool, real life isn't daycare center. Since you already play, I'd say go for it, but play *with* her, and exclusively at least for a while. It will be a great way to start conversations about things like getting scammed, and how to be careful on the internet. And the high difficulty level and learning curve can be a great way to help build and reinforce an internal drive to 'git gud' that can carry over to IRL. And of course if you're playing along together (start a new Alpha alt at 0SP) then it will be great bonding time as you help her learn all the complexities.
---
Obviously keep a close eye, and don't expect to 'drop your kids off', but I'd definitely recommend getting her into Eve if she's interested.
---
looks like a normal minmatar ship to me OP
---
&gt;Your "multi billions" are chum change now. So ships costing that much should be nerfed to be as ordinary as their price. 
---
The only potential issue I see with that is when CCP decides to create a new tier of extremely expensive and downright overpowered BS, like those [Iapetan Titans](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Titan) we've been told about...which will lead to people complaining they're too expensive...which will result in the release of an ORE titan...which will make mining cancerous again (MMCA!)...which will put us right back where we started.
---
I don't disagree with your solution, I just worry that it might put us back where we started in five years.
---
 Lore wise Talocan hard point for dreadnoughts are described as larger than any dreadnought we have today.Remmember the old races built things BIG  from capital ships to stations stuff was super sized. 
---
I'm fairly certain CCP has no idea what they're doing.  The alternative is they're trying to get short-term sales up for some metric.  I'm not sure which is worse.
---
[You have a very short memory](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b6ssfe/video_hey_guys_come_ts_quick_very_important_elo/ejnporn/)
---
&gt; What did Test do to you
---
TEST is everything wrong with Eve 2019. Full of bears that care more about getting the best rock than anything else. Smother any content to death under their blob. Backstab allies the nanosecond it becomes convenient to do so. So entangled in so many political alignments, NIPs, NAPs, and agreements that you have to have a law degree to know who you can shoot and when. 
---
Vily's attitude towards Snuffed Out when they ganked your move op is emblematic of what's wrong with TEST. Vily just *assumed* that Snuffed Out, a group famous for saying "blue is just a color" in local while they betray allies, would not drop their move op because they had worked together in the past. The idea that in this game you're blue unless otherwise stated is antithetical to the core principles of this game, and yet Vily seems to think you need a legal document to shoot each other. Not to mention that TEST has this omnipresent savior syndrome - you always have to be the Good Guys. It's not enough to have a war with Frat - you had to fabricate some bullshit NIP violation so you can pretend to be aggrieved. You're arguing that I'm taking this game too seriously - you're in an alliance that needs a CB and a cross to bear in order to undock. TEST sucks. 
---
Can't you just get a decent bunch of inties and keep popping booshers every minute or something?
---
TLDR: "While snuff came to us and bullied us we went to another area"
---
We are everything wrong with EVE huh. Man I bet GOONS will feel left out. 
---
So the BOTS and RMT your current Alliance does is ok?
---
We did all of this to you, and ruin your game right? Why dont you run for CSM so you can really make this your job and mission to make EVE your game. Sorry you dont like the way we play. 
---
It seems your gasping for relevance is continuously expanding as well.
---
Austin, TX checking in. Point me to the pew!

Yup. I actually agree with him. I'm just not sure there's a way to mitigate the side effect of rich people chugging injectors. Think that's just something we have to deal with for the sake of new blood.
---
because this game just isn't worth paying for.

Is there anything that would benefit from this bug?

Nope, you're concern trolling like hell. Why even try to claim you aren't? You're doing it *in this post* -- pouring out a bunch of crocodile tears about dissent and how unfair things are for "peon linemembers." If you were actually a part of this alliance, you'd know that you can be critical of things on our services without any risk, as long as you aren't a complete moron. Hell, The Slayer trolls harder than you are right now right to leaderships' face and nothing has ever happened to him. See also: deadtear, and myself. If you were actually a member of Goonswarm Federation, you'd know this.
---
Also, when did I claim that I was part of any discussion, or that there was even a discussion in the first place? No discussion is necessary. This shit is *common sense.* I know how we'll react because I have a brain and I have been part of the alliance for long enough to understand how it'll react to simple stimuli like "retards make a big stink about supercap sales in tiny amounts publicly." Again, it's knowledge I have, implicitly, due to actually being a part of the organization in question.

We wanted this nerfed so we can’t use and others can’t use it.

For some people yes. Eve isn't as difficult as it used to be.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Nope. Goons are a problem, too. Frat are a problem, too. So is Darkness. But no one exemplifies what's wrong with the game right now quite like Legacy does.

and last I checked simple linemembers don't have ping rights, cant call themselves Director of Finance, can be a Logistics Director or cap fueling. I guess you and the rest of the world have a different definitions for the word linemember.

Now please, continue digging that hole deeper, lets how much more of an idiot you can be. I use to think you were pretty cool, and even had you at like +16 on RES before this conversation, but now I just realize you're another dumbfuck koolaide drinker who is probably personally benefiting from this whole ordeal. Now please, say something else that can be easily debunked and pushed aside, I seriously can't wait for your reply, it should be a good one.

 You got no idea AT ships will only go down if old models are released again as for fancy popular models useful in pvp like cambion whiptail adrestia fiend moracha and imp you can be expected to pay several hundred bil for a cruiser now.

Once again, not knowing who leadership is. Innominate is a director. I'm not. I don't have ping rights, and anyone can buy any title they want if they're in Goonwaffe if they bribe someone with roles. You use them for scamming, because pubbies, like you apparently, take them as some sort of proof of leadership. Once again, if you were actually in the alliance, you'd know this.

&gt;Both indications that you are involved in, or at least know of discussions taking place, BUUUUUUUUUUUUUT you also claim to be just a goon linemember
---
No it doesn't, you dingus. "part of the organization being discussed" means "being a part of the organization that the conversation is about in the first place." Reading comprehension.
---
I'm actually starting to think it's that second one I was talking about earlier. For your own sake, if you are actually in this alliance, get out. You obviously hate it here and would be happier elsewhere.
---
Yeah, have you played Sins of a Solar Empire? The idea is [Like this unit](https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Ogrov_Torpedo_Cruiser) 
---
They run roughshod over structures and defenses but get pooped on by anythijg with a gun. 
---
To balance their monster DPS, their sig radius for guns would be 2km+. Yeah you can ruin someone's day _occasionally. _
---
Same here. I plex 10+ accounts every month with isk, but if it is going to be 4.5m/plex then I might just bite the financial bullet as it is more worth now. 
---
I think they picked on the wrong alliance..  so funny... have horde made this mutual? If not they should
---
..
---
Toking up, my dude.
---
Looks like we Need a deja vu Meme.. anyone?
---
I'll be honest, my only experience with bombers is my first killmail where I was busy dying to an Onyx in a pve 'Cane and he decided to be in 720mm range when decloaking.
---
As one of those groups I gotta say it's a blast fighting you guys and gals. o7 we'll be coming for your beans soon
---
ah ok, so they basically Mercs for hire?
---
That's sounds about right. He dropped into our into our corp comms a couple months ago to talk to about some things and basically said what he's been saying, that we're shit, our deployment is dumb and our ops are lame. The only reason, according to him, that he rejoined TNT is that he likes Wibla and Wibla asked him to over beers in Vegas.

TIL goons moved to amarr ls, after all they are the single majority in your side.

&gt;out played in Rus Rus Prime by a US tz group

&gt;out played

that's one way to call phoning 3 times their numbers I guess
---
kind of. their staging is jita
---
lol okay fine man, I guess I'm not in Goons, I'll take your word for it over the fatbee symbol in my character sheet. Maybe I'm just too new to Goons to know what you're talking about, and hating one person isnt a good enough reason to leave, no matter how retarded that one person is.
---
Well on a panic it’s a zero sum game. They can never kill your rorqual but your rorqual is stuck in place until the servers turn to dust. 
---
Lose lose. 
---
Evictions are a part of living in a wormhole.
---
Your tears excite me.
---
with that logic you couldn't kill anything valuable at all
---
You can say anything you like, that doesn't make it so.
---
Then again i wasn´t planning on visiting Detroid anyway. Don´t have that MoTown Blues
---
Doesn't help player retention when it takes *months* to get even decent skills, especially as a new player. Most people will look at the training time in their queue and never log in again.
---
what do you mean?
---
I mean its not like I never sub, but sometimes I just want to hop on and play without committing for a month.
---
The [Gold Magnate](https://eve-museum.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Magnate) was extinct for most of EVE's lifespan, but CCP eventually awarded more.
---
&gt;high plex prices (when controlled for inflation) = fewer interested people dumping $$$ into the game relative to the game's playerbase
---
That is literally the opposite to how supply and demand works.
---
I get it, I'm the same way too. But I play as Alpha for a day or two, realize how much it feels like a trial demo mode, and then I sub back up. 
---
Its been awhile,  are 4 and 5 missions even worth running?
---
Would it spawn in space after downtime if you didn’t log back in?
---
Or you could just buy PLEX and sell it on the market.
---
There's clearly a massive demand relative to supply. I genuinely have no idea why people aren't just doing this.
---
Thoughts and prayers go out to our virgin brothers in arms!
---
I don’t know. I’ve never activated a 628yr panic module. It’s breaking new ground. 
---
&gt;How would you fix it?
---
I would personally do the following: boosh modules now have charges and can fit 5 of them in there module. 
---
Now because of the quantum nature of such charges they will be used regardless if the module is activate or the ship is booshed by somebody else. 
---
Now these charges can be reloaded by waiting 2 minutes. 
---
The alternative is to have booshing do a global cap drain but the fear with that solution is that people will just add guards to the mix to keep there command destroyers capped up. 
---
So you’re saying there’s a chance.
---
Time to selllllll
---
Even if the brave dudes are downvoting me I’m still defending that video. 
---
If that were holy lord savior Mittani I’d fucking buy him the next whiskey shot to drink alone in his divorcee apartment.
---
fewer people creating PLEX = lower supply
---
more people refusing to sub with $$$ and using plex = higher demand
---
therefore, price increases
---
I’m saying that I have no idea what would happen. 
---
Consider it yourself first then. Lmao
---
Thank you, space uncles.
---
Point out where I said it was ok to RMT. 
---
I just don't understand why you're clinging to it so much. Why don't you know any of the half-dozen common things that literally any highsec cave dweller we hoover off of Jita knows after being in the alliance for more than a femtosecond? Why are you so desperate to prove malfeasance in what you claim to be your own damn alliance, yet want to stay there? How can you not log into the goonfleet dot com forums, find a post of mine, and observe the absence of a director bee on the top right of the post? Why are you so afraid of speaking privately, despite knowing full well that the only reason we shoot motherfuckers is for making a stink about things publicly, like you're doing right now? None of it makes any damn sense unless you're just lying.
---
Yes, it's our, at least bi-weekly if not daily "Guess they're still mad about that proteus" post
---
Yes, but you just said that the rising price of PLEX serves as a *disincentive* for people to enter the market.
---
That's absolutely not true. Rising prices are a market signal to invest in the market. The rising price of PLEX if anything should serve as a strong incentive to buy PLEX with USD or your currency of choice and sell it on the market.
---
Not in a wormhole because you risk getting podded out. We don't insta respawn in the same system like nullsec. 
---
Truthfully we won't know but it's always a good way to get people to log in all their accounts on 3 different day so it might make the daily account log ins.
---

---
So dreads?
---
So you’re saying there’s a chance
---
tbh I only see 2 chinese factions on TQ, Ex-Serenity-PIBC in Goons and Ex-Serenity-Refugees from PIBC in FRT, RR and several "unaffiliated" groups.
---
You can side with them and we will call it unspoken. ;-) I wont tell anyone it will be our little secret. 
---
Nice.
---
it is genuinely hard to tell whats going on in there. i think this is what it looks like when someone loses their mind...
---
I promise that was a joke made in good fun. I'm aware of at least some of your other corp stuff (your rescue caches, and wh S&amp;R.
---
The pod was high grade slaves
---
&gt;Yes, but you just said that the rising price of PLEX serves as a disincentive for people to enter the market.

i did not

---
Because they can't seem to stop bots, even though the bots operate 24/7 and would be simple enough to catch (otherwise you catch someone account sharing) they just decided to remove access to certain things that bots do. And the bots are still doing level 3 missions. 
---
"That's my secret. I'm always sad."
---
Softer targets -  but I think they underestimate the durability of russian lowseccers - even groups like PanFam left Aridia ISK-negative.
---
Yes, and double yes, if you do them right.
---
id like to add that flying logi and boosher for this was aids and no fun. we won the objective and yes we blobbed but id rather fly a 10 men rr punsisher comp and get dropped by 10 titans in null than this chain booshing BS. I just imagined someone in INIT singleboxing 1 Raven for RAGE...big cringe...makes me laugh and cry. pls fix ty ccp
---
Nice, I'll have to check that out. :)
---
&gt;**high plex prices** (when controlled for inflation) **= fewer interested people dumping $$$ into the game** relative to the game's playerbase
---
You literally said that.
---
" I can fly that" - say a anonimous Minmatar capsuler.
---
Can you take a fleet of dreads into a supercap umbrella and expect to be successful?  
---
Can you take a small group of them through C2/C3 wormholes?  
---
Wouldn't work. You'd create an alpha character named Plex Mule 42069 that would be for holding all your PLEX. Who cares if some rando alpha character's wallet is perpetually negative?
---
Don't forget that the first of the month = bank accounts full = plexing time. Price will plummet. 
---
7o Brave, I joined during the D06 times. Haven't played in awhile and don't plan on coming back to the game anytime soon - life priority's (*college, work, wife*).  Best of luck with whatever you're fighting at the moment and have fun in Toronto.  
---
Cheers
---
Depends where you live and on the LP store. In general there are better ISK / hour activities, but it's a solid, steady income.
---
Also, it's one of the saver pve activities in nullsec if you don't live in a region where everyone is blue to each other. You just have to scan for combat probes.
---
How will these matrices help exactly? You are getting bonused for factions who are not living in your space in NPC null, which defeats the purpose that you've outlined. Local living is what CCP has continuously emphasized, and if you are killing the local pirates how does that square away?
---
&gt;maybe it will eliminate fotm doctrines and actually make the living place more of an impactful decision besides just income rates.
---
FOTM doctrines will never go away, unless everything is *perfectly* balanced which is impossible given CCP's long track record. And if FOTM doctrines can't go away, then it tightly controls who has access to those faction standings, even with the matrices you've outlined, by region-locking certain things. Essentially you will be covertly ratting and so on in space you don't have just to raise standing to use these ships if you are not in the big null blocs. At a time in which we need more small gang pilots in space doing things, this would further undermine that.
---
&gt;I don't think it will "break the game" necessarily
---
This is what people thought about the rorq changes, and after three years and multiple nerf passes, they finally are coming into line with where they should be.
---
Wibla is not a good guy. He is a toxic person that preys on "pubbies" and is drunk constantly. He is an extremely negative person. There are times where he can be likable, but they're few and far between. Anybody that has spent any time in TNT will tell you the same thing. 
---
train into a Warp to Me incursion alpha ship. 
---
you make 100m to 240m an hour.
---
save up for like omega, or new ships.
---
and the alpha fit ships can be trained into stronger ships (Rokh, Hyperion, Maelstrom.   train into Vindicator, Machariel) that can still be used as an alpha. 
---
Are you mentally deficient?   
---
That just describes how capsuleers pilot their ships. Cybernetically enhanced humans taking direct mind (personality-level) control of their ships. 
---
I wish we could see the amount of killmarks horde has destroyed
---
It's not easy to pay with cash for dread fax carrier alts and others
---
If you're running multiple accounts you're basically spending as much as a new game every month. Since I can farm over 1b/hour pretty reliably with minimal attention I'd rather do that one night every month than spend real money.
---
He's very close with Wibla. I think they docked at Eve Vegas. 
---
i did say that
---
i however, did not say
---
that could actually kinda work, will never happen though 
---
Querns just a linemember lol n1

From your first kill the hunger starts, more, more moaaaar dakka

I didn't know torpedoes had a sig radius of 2km+.

[https://gph.is/g/ZY7ejeE](https://gph.is/g/ZY7ejeE)
---
Probably /s, but TNT will never get kicked because of some weird friendship Wibla and Mittani have. No idea where it came from, though. 
---
not really sure why anyone would think differently
---
shit you can go onto the goonfleet dot com forums and find one of my posts, if i was a direkkktor i'd have a direkkktorbee on the top right
---
Okay. You said that higher PLEX prices lead to fewer people entering the market through buying PLEX with $.
---
I said that you said that higher PLEX prices lead to fewer people entering the market through buying PLEX with $.
---
Just own up to the fact that you said something unimaginably stupid and leave it at that.
---
The day anybody manages to kill the player of games in J5A, i'll make /u/deltaxi65 advocate for a nerf to chain-booshing
---
Fair enough, I misread.     
---
It does make one wonder if we will get some sort of mind-control thing from the Triglavians, though. Maybe Triglavian incursions into realspace with entosis-like weapons that inhibit certain properties of your vessel by jamming its systems.
---
If they do this fax falloff shit, it'd be fine to allow reps on structures.
---
&gt;  the turds... noisily popping up and burning out like supermassive cringenovas.
---
As a complete aside, I just wanted to say that, as an astronomer, this is a frigging awesome description lol. 
---
Yes. This is correct and this is what skill injectors were supposed to address, and in a way they do but to a much smaller extent then needed because these players also look at their total costs in $$$ and say "fuck this".
---
CCP really needs to come up with a different mechanic.
---
Also fighters also can't catch up for long because all your MJDessies fit a scrambler and scrambled fighters don't come along for the ride.  Your fleet is effectively moving at something like 10-20km/s, just with some sort of stutter drive instead of continuous.  (You probably still want some sort of point defense solution for them, though, because it can get hairy fast if you're not also actively defanging carriers.)
---
It’s because they can’t detect it because they don’t force you offline after no activity.
---
If they forced you offline after three hours of inactivity everyone will be horrified that their is only about 1,200 people actively playing the game.
---
&gt;You said that higher PLEX prices lead to fewer people entering the market through buying PLEX with $.
---
i didn't
---
&gt;skillfarms don't impact pcu
---
Not directly themselves, but they enable a ton of multiboxing and botting via their sales of injectors.
---
So you want to nerf bombers.
---
Fweeeeeee?
---
We went in with 15 people and no standings and - thats uncommon to you it seems - no batphones. We fought them 1 full year, been persistant and pesky, but always respectful in chats. We grew friendships with human beings. And be sure you do not want us to help them again, I guess you just had some traumatic stuff happening to you from us lately XD. The reason you moved on for targets you think are softer XD ... I am having more &amp; more fun here
---
I was in NC years ago can confirm and no doctrines under 1b.
---
No. That's called "balance". 
---
Can you  kill supers through a WH and under a supercap umbrella? Yes. BB does it every week. In bombers. Literally through a wh and under a super umbrella.
---
So there are alot of people bitching about how this is non-counter-able or trying to create poorly designed restrictions. 
---
There are 2 problems happening here Citadel Hit box extends far beyond undock creating position issues to the defender
---
And that chain booshing is really hard to catch. 
---
My proposals to change this would make the structure hit box not extend into the tether ring.
---
And to nerf booshers without removing the mechanic, Reduce jump range to 75km allowing more cruiser doctrines to give chase. 
---
I hate most of your shitposts, but the salt you bring from people everytime you post where a soityo is *almost* ^^not ^^really makes up for it. 
---
It *is* sideways - you're just looking at it wrong ;)
---
Are they pvp fit? That's what we're getting at here. A hull designed to eat Capitals _in pvp fits._
---
Perun is DIRECTIVE 2 and Veles is DIRECTIVE 3. 
---
Sooooo...what's DIRECTIVE 1?
---
Again,
---
Just gonna leave that here.
---
I started playing eve in high school , I was maybe 15 at the time. As I was a playing other games I had no problems communicating with older people and being the youngest. Eve is not a scary place full of untrustworthy people like everyone says, I found a decent group of people and even after 9 years of playing we're still friend and grab a beer together when we're in the same town. 
---
I've met some guys playing eve together with their kids(ranging from 7 yo to 18) and it was always great for both of them.
---
Point is, she'll be fine.
---
Yes. The response fleets are pvp fit. They eat shit. We kill response faxes and carriers.
---
A good start would be to double the training speed for the first 30 days of a new account. Would help get new players into the game that much faster.
---
Agreed, instalock frig and a VNI will give most folks a run for their isk.
---
Yea, I was wondering how they would incorporate trigs into kspace. Like maybe fobs or something?
---
Bet entosis-like things would go into that. 
---
a few months go by and its like they don't even remember biting the curb.
---
Upshipping is a far more risky and difficult thing to pull off though. A cruiser/BC gang can escape from battleships, warp faster than them and kite them. You can't warp faster than a cyno and you can't really get away from or kite carriers in small ships.
---
stainguy confirmed goon
---
I think that would be good indeed, + add some additional specific diminishing returns to cap and super training on skill injectors.
---
The danger here is though that you will end up with more low SP bots such as ones doing delivery missions or FW even faster.
---
Stutter drive? My God, Eve discovered Project Orion...
---
At least you won't run out of paste.
---
In other words, I didn't fucking say it. You're a moron, but you're right - we're done here. I'm not wasting any more time on ya. 
---
CCP usually does this offer every 4ish months, last time they did I did all my accounts for 6 months. I did the same today, it was an expensive day. Pro tip for anyone interested: CCP has done this offer multiple times in the past and its usually every 4-6 months so what I do is buy PLEX for cheapish during those 4-6 months when there isn't a sale then I PLEX all my duders in one go.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Sorry didnt mean for you to be so butt hurt that you are siding with RMT BOTTERs. You dont have to say it, you picked the side.
---
Hey at least it's cap stable.
---
Yep. The ravens have an extremely long range, and the structure model is huge, so they will just move around any defense force that is formed and keep shooting 
---
yes, high plex prices mean fewer people are interested in dumping $$$ into the game
---
Old man.

Shit, I miss Brave. I still have tackle hulls in VII M6. I remember the Trail of Tears up to Barleguet, whelping things on purpose on the undock to master baiters, accidentally shooting Cag on a fleet, blocking out the sun with Talwars. Organising the gank of a war targets shiny by baiting him with a triple rep Myrm on the Stacmon undock. 
---
I wonder if it's time to do this null thing.  EU TZ. Worth it, or is the Winter War II going to be hell?

someone in my corp asked if we wanted to break up the horde presence in jita.

i said no, theyre just slam dunking pirat. doin gods work.
---
I can't believe HK is still salt posting lmao. Even PL didn't cry this long after they got steamrolled.
---
I see no problem with high plex prices.
---
If you can't afford to plex or need to use your isk for other things, than buy a sub.
---
Pretty sure it's a direct reference to http://wiki.swordofthestars.com/sots1/FTL_Drive_Technology#Liir which I always thought was one of the more interesting FTL concepts.

Fair enough. How long do you think that cool down timer should be? 
---
why ru going though my post history 
---
**Stacking penalties:**
---
&gt;The Formula    
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The effectiveness of stacking penalized modules polotted.    
---
&gt;Stacking-penalized modifiers are applied one at a time, in descending order of strength.    
---
&gt;The n-th modifier is multiplied by S(n-1), as follows:    
---
&gt;S(u) = e-(u / 2.67)2    
---
&gt;The Numbers    
---
&gt;The exact numbers for stacking penalties can be gained by the formula above, but here are some rounded guidelines for quick calculations that doesn't need to be precise:    
---
&gt;1st mod: 100.0% effectiveness    
---
&gt;2nd mod: ~86.9% effectiveness    
---
&gt;3rd mod: ~57.1% effectiveness    
---
&gt;4th mod: ~28.3% effectiveness    
---
&gt;5th mod: ~10.6% effectiveness    
---
&gt;6th mod: ~3.0% effectiveness    
---
&gt;As is clear, stacking more than 3 or 4 modules or rigs - unless you really have nothing else at all that you could fit there - that affect the same stat is fairly pointless, as your benefit is so tiny.
---
^(I am a bot, this comment produced 260m ticks which is enough to purchase 171.48510535667825735226614785592 PLEX per hour at current Jita prices.)
---
\^\^ This. Or at least group them into something more significant.
---
on a side note, you guys are doing a good job, please continue, PH is getting lots of smiles and popularity even from non PH people for this. 
---
If you could, go also after the small ones and their structures wherever you can. That would make lots of people happy, those in PH or not in PH alike.
---
You needing to buy a new ship does not sink an ISK.
---
You pay those ISK to a different player and the currency remains in the game. 
---
Didnt you guys lose a keepstar a while back?
---
LOL if you go with pods this expensive then you should at least dump some cheap ass 3% implants into the empty slots.

trying to get back into actually playing the game a bit, think the changes are a step in the right direction

---
&gt; Fix the shit tier mechanic that is chain booshing. It was used successfully against us. Now we use it successfully against others. Low tier effort to pull off to counter all Structures. 
---
Too many structures in the game. Too much structure spam. Game needs this enhanced and more mechanics like it, not less.
---
why?
---
He was like stainguy, always posting, always coming up with ideas.
---
  So where do you draw the line between someone like gevlon and an "expert"? Who do CCP listen to, and ignore?
---
Or it works like the old resist stacking bug where it overflows, becomes negative and cycles instantly.

Also you know, theyre with a fleet and those carry drones usually...

So that's what happens when abyssal deadspace collapses.

Dun dun duuuuun

yeah formatting most importantly

are you trying to do combat sites, exploration sites or both? the fit is bad in any case, but if you want to do both, you want to have two separate fits for each and refit on the fly using a mobile depot.

if you can pinpoint the exact thing you want to do with it (guristas ded, wormhole c3, ghost sites etc.) then we can start working on it.

note: t2 mwd is worse than its meta variants and is a useless module. if you want to sustain other modules, go with quad lif. if you want to sustain the mwd, go with cold gas. if you need fitting and can afford to take a bigger cap hit, go with y-t8.

---
Hmmm, I think tehre is. To test it out I'd recommend hopping into a Rorq and activating a regular PANIC literally 1 minute before DT reset. Then see what happens when you log back on. If its still active then the likelyhood that the Abyssal one would work just as well is high. If it gets reset, then the Abyssal one would get reset also.

NPC's as a tool can help supplement an experience that a Game Master or Director wants the players to have. As a Dungeon Master for my friends in D&amp;D, I can't enlist a person to play every NPC they come across. It would be fantastic if I could, but scripting and automating those interactions is part of a process to give players consistency and in depth interactions. 
---
As absolutely terrible Elite Dangerous's NPC's could be, even in it's still shitty state, at any time I can fly out and defending miners from pirates, or be a pirate against those miners, hunt down wanted targets, deliver goods to further military, political or social accomplishments for factions, or just fly around the rings of a planet that's pretty. Most of it is with NPCs. If Elite was just an empty sandbox with the requirement that players needed to do everything, I couldn't log on after work and zoom around miners and defend them from pirates. It would require a player base to do that, at the right place at the right time. 
---
In its current state, I could mine and defend myself as NPC police forces come to my aid against NPC or player pirates. I could patrol with NPC police forces to attack NPC or player pirates. My friends and I can all do this together, or join the cause of a conflict and go into a small battle that has NPC's, but can have other players. 
---
In other games, NPC's create a baseline for players to leverage off of, DoTA 2, League of Legends, Star Wars Battlefront, Dark Souls, NPC's give a player a sense of grounded expectation to play with, against or off of. 
---
If for example, Eve Online really ran with the lessons from Elite Dangerous, we would see NPC mining ops from factions and pirates going out to collect resources, you can join the op, mine with them, defend them from other NPCs or players, join raiding parties against other factions, scan down NPC raiders in systems etc. These baseline supply chains would feed into that faction, allowing it to pump war machines and they can buy resources from players. All of which can fund wars against other factions. 
---
At any time, players could log in and feel like they are part of something. I personally would love the idea of Role Players taking command and control of NPC's for a faction to perform tasks. It would be a hybrid method of basically hiring people who like to GM/DM and delivering content for players, by players, to an extent that we see in tabletop gaming. I believe at this point, something like that might help. 
---
But that's just my opinion. I really like the idea of Eve Online, and I would really like it to thrive. Though content is constantly coming out, at the end of the day if you and I can't get people to join the game, it's going to die. Dust 514 failed, so did the card game, I have a dozen friends that are interested in Eve but because the stupid high graphics limit what computers can play the game well, and that not everyone has a good enough computer to play Eve Online, much less get in the habit of logging on and trying to understand how to play, even when they do they feel alone while playing. 
---
Again, I say this as I'm actively trying to play and  enjoy Eve Online. So far, saving miners in Elite from some stupid NPC pirates has felt a great deal more satisfying than the factional warfare towers I fought over and the missions I've run. This weekend I'm looking to explore the planetary interaction stuff and check out some of the other content. We'll see. 
---
I would like to get your opinion however how you're able to successfully get others to join Eve. You certainly seem like a purest in this and if you think less NPC's will be better for the game, I certainly want to hear your reasons. I'm not a dev, this may be for nothing, but I certainly want to learn more.
---
my vigilant has been all over their place but they haven't taken the hint so far

At least do a short battle report. Also it's not even considered a too expensive proteus.

They could use Triglavian FOBs to release capsuleer FOBs as part of the Upwell line, filling in the long-promised small starbase gap. Maybe small-tier citadels with fast anchoring time but only one (none if not fueled) reinforcement timer, good for people trying to contest space.

YOU SPELLED DROUGHT WRONG!

TTT needs more plex than that, get in there now
---
In a nutshell, if you join PH for example, you'll be wardecced by multiple corps non-stop and this will make movement / travel through HS tricky. You will have to learn how to "weave and dodge". It is perfectly doable on a cloaky or a fast frigate liek a T1 interceptor etc. But it becomes much harder if you are flyign with a slow transport ship loaded with stuff to take to the market, or vice versa.
---
Once you are in Horde I recommend you just ask them about it on comms, they will explain all the details to you, its really a lot of typing and its better anyways because you can just ask them stuff on the spot.

Yes, but that's my question, what does it mean to be wardecced? Does it mean that by joining PH it means that I'm joining a corp that's at war with multiple other corporations and this means that whenever I'm going through High sec I risk to stumble upon players of these at war corps which will be able to kill me without repercussions? Did I get this right?

Never not upvote a SOTS reference.
---
You have 2 numbers to go on. 
---
1.6 average accounts logged in per player, according to the recent AMA on main forum. Thus out of 30k that is 11250.
---
Second is the security blog, you see how many bots they ban every month, give the fact that most bots are back within a few days to a week, and you can actually work out a solid number of how many are logged into the game at any given time. You are still guessign but its a pretty solid guess. For January 2019, 4102 accounts were banned for botting. Assume 1 week bot return that gives around 3k bots guaranteed logged into the game at any given time. On a 30k player login that is 10%.
---
These are very good guestimates, and pretty close to actual averages. of course, these are just guaranteed confirmed bot numbers that CCP has banned. We have no idea how many more bots operate that they have not banned. My personal suspicion is that out of that 11k (per 30k logged in players) multiboxing players it will turn out to be around 6k bots in total.
---
This gives you a good idea bout the multiboxed player accounts to bots ratio as well.
---
So yea, we do have some info. Not enough to get specific confirmed numbers, but enough to work out and make some solid educated guesses.
---
I would have been delighted to take on some bot-aspirants when I was twelve.

The ceptors only need to survive long Enough for a proper fleet to arrive. Then there’s the fact that as soon as those drones go out to deal with tackle and your fleet has to boosh away, well that option only works so many times.

&gt; With 10s cd, it's enough to change how spear fishing will work, and it puts gangs like Stukas at risk again, since once they hit that first boosh, they are locked to a specific area for a time.
---
Exactly. Let's kill another small gang option for the big fights. 
---
Cool down is the worst possible solution to this. Make fights that can scram. Leaves the small gang solution untouched, while allowing these big fights to be hindered by a few dozen carriers running heavy tackle fighters.

So what you're saying is that chain booshing is perfectly fine if you're a smallgang, but it's only broken if you're a large fleet?

Present an alternative solution then that adequately scales. Because newsflash; just about every nerf has a significant detrimental effect in small gang settings.

name a system in eve after him - plenty of nullsec systems out there.

---
Scram. Fighters. 
---
Small gangs relying on booshing generally have enough ships that apply well to fighters, they're not going to be effected by them, or at least not as oppressively as a cool down would. 
---
In Large scale fights, dedicating 5-10 Carriers to scramming out Jump chains is a small enough commitment not to bother the engagement as a whole. so punishes defenders who are unprepared and dont have them on hand.

It will probably instantly cycle.

solo is very doable,  but like you say LP is a large portion of the value so might want to add in some overhead for time spend transporting and trading.  Also LP markets go up and down so my answers are general long term results. Also these are highsec numbers for the lv4s.  Doing missions for pirate LP in null is going to be different numbers, If you are in goons I'm sure you can find out about that. 
---
~100m/hr with regular level 4s, there's a big range around there given some missions completely suck while some are good, also depends on if you blitz and/or cherry pick. I'd guess newbs do ~40m/hr, mostly because they have low skills and bad damage. 
---
200-300m/hr with burners  roughly 1/3 isk and 2/3 lp, I generally did all the burners offered plus 2 normal missions.  could probably add a decline or two and push it up a bit more.  Can also multibox them,  I didn't feel too much efficiency loss with 2 accounts, but I also never tracked it. Travel time is the main problem with burners, Lanngisi is the easy answer for this but the LP values are on the lower end.  I was looking at another place but just never got around to it, got bored of missions. 
---
hearsay alert but 500m-1b/hr in lv5s from what I've seen, that said none of it was super trustworthy. Anyways   almost all the money is in bulk LP with some occasional faction drops. 
---
Replace the Jita monument that is shattered with a monument to CCP Guard.

He is always standing Guard over the great market of Jita.

H-5's keepstar fight showed us that fighters are generally useless against booshers. If you can chain boosh 300km away it wasted the MWD cycle on fighters, and in TiDi they never really catch up again.

They can be permakited.

just limited the amount of booshes you can do in a row, fleet wide ( i made up a method to do it above ).

like most small gang fleet's would be perfectly fine with having 5 booshes and then a 2 minute cool down.

it takes ccp years to fix the most obvious imbalances in eve, and even then its a coin toss if they understood the problems or their "fixes" make them worse.

i did put in a ticket but they said they couldnt manually give special offers. but like i said it showed up after a few days so no problem
---
Ok your suggestions are completely unrealistic from a balance perspective.
---
Your solution to fixing a problem with something that is overtuned to the point of abuse is to change half a dozen other things, culminating in 'fix TiDi', which is a massive ask in itself and entirely unrelated to game balance.
---
I mean a smarter suggestion might have been limit the number of ships that a boosh grabs to 10 or something, that way you need more booshers for bigger fleets. To make it work you would also render booshers unable to take someone elses boosh, so your booshers dont accidentally get snatched away in the process.

Does system index affect the materials used in construction at all, or is it just install cost? I've been building some abyssal ammo and module BPCs and the cost feels very low (20k-ish?) in jita, but my profit yield is way higher than that. If I'm paying 10% more on my install cost for the convenience of building in Jita, it seems really worth it!
---
Is there any way beyond ME that I can lower the cost of building something? There doesn't seem to be skills on it, so I might just keep building out of Jita. What am I missing? The penalty doesn't seem that bad.

How is a Citadel only scram burst projector unbalanced? It's only slightly more oppressive than a web burst projector, hell give the scram burst projector a shorter duration and AoE if you're that antsy. Sure, means a small gang cant fight on a Citdael, but that's not a huge deal. 
---
Your idea doesnt work, again, because it completely kills spearfishing, and snatch fleets. If a boosher cant take another Boosher's boosh (say that three times fast), you cant spearfish, or snatch at all. 
---
So I'll say it again. This one fucking time, can we not completely neuter small gang in favour of boring ass tidi fests?
---
One thing they can usually do is giving extra game time as compensation.
---
The problem is it won't - it's just going to make folks buy in-game plex. It's an increase in demand and a reduction in supply, driving the price up. We were just getting back to something close to normalcy after last weeks stupidity, and I feel like these guys made an dumb decision because they didn't think it through.

Were there any benefits for EVE players interacting with Dust? I kind of dipped out after I saw it was PS3 only (the last console I bought was original release PS2)
---
NOT ALL CAPS. REPORTED!
---
Snitches also get riches.
---
Better question is when do we get a bigger block lost ffs lol
---
Actually contact list is much smaller, and you never can do it.
---
I think you had an option to do orbital bombardments
---
&gt; Shit tier mechanic that need fixing, can you guess what it is?
---
Self destructing your capitals on the undock because you are about to get your shit pushed in?

AAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Then he isnt cut out for wormhole space. Tell him to go lose stuff in null for a few months 
---
You’re late, public contracts are soo yesterday.
---
The best Plex idea is locking it in the Plex vault once it has been acquired by any other mean than paying $ to CCP, such as the in-game market, trade, contracts, loot, or from Corp hangar etc. Kinda like how "soulbond" works for wow.
---
Hop in mcav-public or mail sirpaco Wallace or carthelan endare and we'll get you sorted bruv 
---
I think this is the early concept for the triglavian event tbh
---
also there were stuff tobuild like ground vehicles and armor. at least it was in the ingame store
---
You didn't say scram burst projector before, though.
---
Or add a mass limit to each boosh so that a big blob can't all be booshed at once.
---
Is this joke beaten to death yet?
---
/u/-bulkahontas
---
first they come for your jf
---
now they come for your alliance??
---
It's a fleet i don't enjoy flying. So that evens it out, right?
---
\+
---
They need to make a special ship for him, the cardboard Friendship (a tiny one of course).
---
Name a low-sec gate to stain after him ))
---
The entire nano gang concept would be threatened by scram fighters. Most of those ships die if they get scrammed for longer than 5 seconds, and they're one of the few options left for roaming hostile space. So by adding that you'd effectively remove all of the doctrines which can contest a capital blob - ravens, stukas and nano gang. Terrible idea. 
---
This
---
That's the model for Gooncannon that lets you fire people into distant cynos
---
*x-cannon applicaple for different groups.
---
Why?
---
then l would still just get extra accounts to off set it
---
cool, Scram burst projectors for Citadels only. 
---
Imo you're butthurt that we're getting something done that your 15 man fleet couldn't after years of trying....its happening now.  Join the fight or stfu
---
Wow that’s awesome. Never would have thought of that. 
---
No skills to lower the cost. They removed that too. Structure bonuses are how you reduce costs which NPC stations have none. 
---
It really depends what you’re making. Some things will just be straight unprofitable to make in Jita like that. 
---
I do t2 and capital module production at a large scale. The difference between having no reductions in an NPC station and having bonuses from an engineering complex and the rigs on it would cost me maybe my entire profitability. Plus the higher install costs. I have quickly made some faction ships in Jita before because those weren’t impacted so badly but largely I stay away from it. 
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/
---
That website can calculate profitability based on some different factors. 
---
Even something like capital shield extender I. In Jita I’d be looking at 3.7 million profit per run before sales taxes. 3 jumps out from Jita with 0% structure tax and a t1 ME rig I’m now making 5.1 million before sales tax. 
---
Just flying a few jumps out makes me that much more and that’s a relatively inexpensive module. 
---
On the t2 capital shield extender. In Jita I’d only be making 5.3 million before sales tax which means depending on skills when you sell it you’re making practically nothing. Again move that a few jumps out and it’s now 14.3 million with a t1 rig. 
---
The Jita numbers are even a bit high because it’s assuming an engineering complex not a station. 
---
So this is my extremely long winded way of saying it depends what you’re making and at what scale. If you can make profit producing in Jita the convenience is amazing. When I’m setup and running I’ve got 3 alts making things nearly 24 hours a day and so those margins make an enormous difference over time. 
---
I could get behind that, although I imagine the server might not. 
---
You'd still need 450 mil profit per injector (with the added 250k SP) at 2 bil sub to break even. So even with this sale, injectors will stay unprofitable.
---
Oh my god the miscommunication in the end where suddenly SYNDE goes *blue* and you nearly kill Chief, Arancar, and both of the surviving NAPHE Guardians. That's hilarious.
---
That day was a load of fun but... maybe next time we're going to join you for a fight, give us a heads up that the enemy are camping the wormhole and that our boys are going in alone to be the distraction brick? (:
---
Nice work in the first 10 minutes of the fight though, I didn't even know you all were in there before we arrived.
---
Except, even with the bonus SP and discounted sub, skill injectors are staying net negative.
---
Can someone tl;dr the hydex drama please?
---
It's in reference to something called Macaper's prophecy in the lore, some gallente lady who predicted the end of the world. 
---
Agreed
---
Down voted

Being the goon fc they batphoned I came for the good fight 
---
Leeloo Dallas multipass
---
So how many years ago did you quit? 
---
Yeah I don't really know anything about server load. I just like the idea of keeping as much of the boosh mechanics intact as possible while limiting boosh fleets. It could also make snatching parts of a fleet from a blob easier.
---
You all do suck.. 
---
A full passive rattle using geckos and faction missiles in a RHML has no application problems.

---
Cause I make enough money on the market to do it anyway.
---
I do agree that chain booshing needs to be looked at.  However as you said there was nothing the defenders could of done about it even if you didn't have booshs.  As to carries, well I don't think they should be the one fix.
---
I brought hurricanes for the second fortizar feroxes for the first. Besides that this was not a strat fleet for the Imperium. Some old friends of mine asked if I would come to the fight for the fight and I thought my fellow goons would enjoy a brawl.
---
It wasn't directly a reference to that, but they were in the back of my head when I said it.  Definitely the kind of tech I was thinking of.
---
To actual line members, you are not a line member. I know you may not feel that way.  As for the other thing -- google it. 
---
Sorry to hear
---
A true Amarr ship then!
---
Kudos, good sir!
---
That's almost as funny as having someone high up in your alliance knowing someone was taking non collateral contracts and not warning anyone. Imagine thinking that you could sort it before Elo got back from a weekend away but in fact screwing nearly 100bil from your corpies .......oh wait that's true muhahahahahahhahahahha
---
Caldari master race.
---
Well, it's a stacking penalty, but I still agree with you. Defenders should be able to repair their shit and maybe an extra module would allow for self-rep.
---
Just a dmg cap and an on/off switch for repair is unfun for both sides.
---
Literally who?
---
They should create an NPC pirate character of him that only flies a Friendship and he can one-shot you off the field or shoot fire works at you. 
---
We gonna take there whole fleet out just for laughs. Keep your isk. Need to spice the game up with some destruction we gonna throw 100 grand usd at em.

I would like to see PI spun off into something like Satisfactory.

No it is not, it was for an event like four years ago, but the event never came to fruition
---
Goons have a lot of rorqs which means cheap caps. As a result they have a no super sales outside of the coalition policy. 
---
Hyde joined TNT (member of the imperium) and then proceeded to sell huge numbers of cheap caps, dread caches, supers and titans to even corps/alliances in direct conflict with Goons. 
---
Hyde then decides to make an awful reddit post threatening NSH and putting a bounty on their structures while basically outing himself in the process. 
---
An NC. member with a friend in NSH who was buying them direct from Hyde then posted all his information from discord. 
---
15 dollars every month, 2 accounts, 30 dollars. Thats 1400 pesos in Argentina per month.
---
Which is one very good dinner for two, quality win included. I prefer EVE.
---
What were you trying to do when this happened?
---
Sorry Im out of the loop. Has Guard left ccp games?
---
IMO it would be hard to sustain a healthy playerbase in another game if they were second-class citizens.  If I were playing another game in this universe, I would want to have either equal leverage against EVE players or no interaction at all, and just a shared universe.  But even then, you run the risk of the new game being perceived as just another pipeline to playing EVE, not an end in itself.  CCP obviously hasn't figured any of it out yet.
---
SP farms haven't been profitable in AGES. 
---
Why is this even a discussion?
---
Do you not know how burst projectors work?... Seems weird to use them as an example of how to balance something if you don't even know how they work in the first place. 
---
&gt;When I had only 5 planets running P0&gt;P2 planets made sense. As my network scaled up to 50 planets, running extraction planets pulling 2 types of P1's has been the way to go (for higher extraction yields).
---
could you explain that? It doesnt make much sense to me. Did you change from P0-P2 planets to P0-P1 planets? if so, why extract two different types of P1 on the same planet? You might as well go to P2 then :/
---
Looks like it's had some kind of side effect on your posting.
---
Maybe one LS? betwen stain and hs?

BRB, sending a combat toon to horde

No, the freki is by no means a top tier AT ship but it's alright. The Mimir is the one that's shit afaik.

He just take a break. No one will leave ~~eve~~ ccp forever. We just don't know yet when he'll return because of becoming bored in his new job \^\^

no really, what does a director "going to bat" for me mean
---
what are they going to bat for
---
why would they
---
they don't even know who i am rofl
---
Wait, what's up with that killboard?
---
&gt; Yeah I don't really know anything about server load
---
neither do I, but making an educated guess?
---
apparently not
---
Admittedly, I've not used them alot, but I have used them. 
---
All I'm saying here is being able to shut down MJD's in a set area for a period of time, makes them far easier to kill. It'd give you a chance to get some tackle out on top of them and kill the booshers. 
---
It Guards the Gate to Stain.
---
Does it keep you out, or something else in...
---
finally gave in and bought omega again, it's great to be back in such an amazing game. gonna look for a nullsec corp soon to get properly back in the action! 
---
lmao plz no
---
I think it's called Horde Vanguard. They tend to start people off in bombers for whatever reason.
---
I don't think I have a normal sense of humor, I tend miss out on some of the better moments. The jackdaw moment in the station trader video was a throw away and people come into the stream quoting it. I don't know what most people find funny. So I edit for myself with some predictable results.
---
I haven't been able to enjoy some internet spaceships this week but I'll be back on soon and I'm really looking forward to some spaceships with all of you.  (◕‿◕✿)

It's worse when the end of the printer is a giant blob.... :(

Honestly? Have never 'bought' even a free kill right, probably never will. That side doesn't affect me. But the spam of low-effort bait ships is irritating. Put in effort or skill if you want paid.
---
Holy shit - that was phenomenal. I had never seen that before, thanks for sharing!
---
 The gate in the trailer never became a thing . By the plot illustrated it would've reached further than our star cluster in New Eden maybe an attempt to link to an old Terran gate in the Milky Way who knows
---
Im pretty sure guard will live longer than eve so....
---
oh thank you. i completely forgot that some people have actual lives. might have to buy some plex right away. :)
---
It was a future vision and prophecy of player built Stargates. Given the ongoing trig plot I wouldn't rule it out just yet.
---
None
---
U sir can have a upvote for that
---
Not dead till I make it.
---
Yea, outside of Abyss that is and like I said, at range. If they do make a Battleship Abyss then its a whole different story. 
---
And am just sayin, there are better fit choices, perfectly stable, even more deeps and while sporting either application rigs or computer and possibly ship choices. We'll see if they do it and how it goes. Everything for now is just a "would be" speculation.
---

no wait that was the BoT one ..

idk why no one has tried having a stealth bomber anchor on the enemy FC and like 1 second before the boosh goes off decloak and scram the FC.
---
How’d you get stls for eve ships?
---
Maybe we should ask Falcon to clarify. I remember seeing it when it came out, but it was such a long time ago I completely forgot what it was about.

a little over a minute, around the marauder timer, only slower so the marauder maintains its edge

---
Not sure why more people don’t realize this. CCP probably loves SP farms because it lets them sell SP for $ while avoiding the public outcry. 
---
People freaked out when CCP added the 50k SP daily alpha injectors because they were selling SP for PLEX, but SP farmers have let them do that with a middleman for years. 
---
gahh. dream
---
:screeches in Olmeca Gold:
---
It’s at that point now. SP farms are losing money if active. 
---
I mean thats good to hear but.. They've sorta fucked up with structures anyways imo.. These jump gates are just a replacement for the bridges.. Thats lame.. They had a chance to grow its use but instead gave us supercap highways.. Yay.. Cuz we needed jump fatigue to not mean anything right.. 
---
Sry small rant.. Eve needs maintenance for sure but we need balance also we've been losing a lot of it.
---
Il read that ama tho for sure I ment to attend but forgot about it.

I understand, I was also hoping for something better. Maybe some gates into completely unused WH regions with ship type limitations on them, or dronelands, or something. What we got does kinda suck.
---
&gt;War, of course, war. We want it, our members want it.
---
lmao
---
Spod bless Texas.
---
If the defenders are there, kill the defenders. If there’s no defenders, goodbye structure/titan/whatever valuable we’re discussing.
---
&gt;Then they just get slaughtered by drones or, worst case scenario, smartbombs (the destroyers can easily tank them - the ceptors can not).
---
True, but if you warp at 0 you’re setting yourself up for failure. Smartbombs will destroy the interceptors quickly (and any drones out), however using drones is only going to work so many times if you warp at a range like 9-10km since they will leave the drones behind each time. 
---
The point isn’t to hold the whole fleet down. You just want to pick off what they are willing to leave behind. 
---
&gt;Trust me, if ceptors were an easy solution to raven fleets, people wouldn't be crying about them so much.
---
I never said it was an easy solution, it has quite a bit of coordination involved. But combined with doctrines like sniper Nagas/Nados or Rokhs, you can seriously squeeze their ability to maneuver. Hell, if you can get them to fuck up and boosh out of lock range, you’ve bought you’re citadelalmost another minute of repair time.
---
Which also leads to another, much more gimmicky tactic that I won’t get into right now.
---
The problem I see most often is that people aren’t prepared for them. By the time they realize their doctrine was never prepared to deal with ravens, they’ve already lost the fight. 
---
I think it would definitely be very tough to balance out. I don't think EVE players would be comfortable without having a huge hand in the game which takes away some of the autonomy from the spin off players. 
---
I think the draw there is for a sense of permanency. Even when you look at games like Planetside or Foxhole - winning becomes pointless pretty soon. If a FPS was woven into Eve it would give a much more significant reason to win and keep winning. Especially if every weapon, armor piece, or mod had to be supplied. Keep everything player produced with a cost to losing.
---
That would be niche though and contrast to the scale of EVE itself. 
---
What;'d I miss?
---
Asshole above shaming the user above with a stupid quip about "still working at a supermarket". Retarded.
---
Yes. This was the original purpose of injectors to alleviate that. There is a sweet spot past being just new when it all dawns on you jsut how long it will take you to become effective at what you want to be effective at. 
---
The problem with injectors is though that it didn't alleviate it, just shifted this wall from being years to being $$$$ for new players. Where old players have no problems due to ISK faucets.
---
So they would need a secondary "catch up" mechanic now so those players that hit that wall will stop leaving.
---
THERE ARE NO TECH 2 SALVAGE DRONES.
---
Yea I was hoping for some wh stuff even if its limited with timers or something you know maybe make them act like the flux upgrades for sov but IN a wh sys... Just SOMETHING.. But no.. Plane old jbs.. That are on grid with citis.. So they're so cheap they can be spammed.. Great.. Im glad they still take sov for k space at least.. 
---
yeah like being in a 50k man alliance
---
Found some on the internet a while back and downloaded them.  Couldn’t tell you where sadly as it’s been a while.
---
RIP Dust Bunnies.
---
Yes but this is only this month, gotta think further. This sale is also bringing price of plex up. It will come back down a bit, not all the way like always. And then the following month it will hit the SP farms much harder.
---
Following that will be the Trig event sometime soon too, causing more people to activate their PvE accounts or sub, which will further drive the pelx prices up, hence put yet even more pressure on SP farms.
---
Have a new concord ship named after him.
---
There's a pair of drakes still scratching their heads today after they tried to chase down my nanothron.
---
i only kill test Rorquals.
---
That makes sense, and thanks for the link! I'll do the math on that. :)
---
For me, it's abyssal ammo and damage mods. The damage mods have ~100k manufacturing cost for 5, but I can sell all 5 for 15m. I'm burning through my BPC stockpile now but its something like a 72000% profit margin, so I can spend a few thousand extra to do it right in Jita. :)
---
I'm also doing this casually (as opposed to 24hr on 3 accounts) so totally understood why it matters for the 'pros'.
---
Thank you!
---
A) it was part of the Valkyrie game reveal
---
B) at least part of the footage was related to Project Nova, the FPS that CCP was developing at the time
---
C) player owned gates, iirc

So basically 3 things that CCP were doing that either fizzled out, haven't released or aren't even in development
---
што?

 What should I do next? I'm kind of stuck. I always wanted to do pvp and I was told join FW and lose a bunch of cheap frigs. Well I've lost 500 or so ships and I've destroyed almost 200. I met some of my major goals like destroy a comet/firetail with a t1. I've flown a bunch of different types of t1 and I tried a little bit of dessie. All solo on my end. I'm ready for the next thing. I'm not interested in big fights or joining a blob. Small gang sure but from my view a lot of that is teaming up on some poor guy solo and I'd prefer the 1v1 in that case unless we were teaming up against a bigger target. I know the choices might be slim. One of the things I was hoping to learn was making a fight happen. In the FW space the plex sites make finding fights simple.   I was considering training up an assault frig and roaming null for VNI ratters. I've ratted in J-space and I don't really want to go back to that. I also haven't joined a corporation b/c in FW that means less targets and that has been the limiting factor for me. Thanks for the help! I know I may have eliminated some of my options with my nitpicks. In game name: West Chemistry. Check out my zkillboard for giggles at my expense.

I’m not op, but you mention guristas ded as a specific activity—is there a big difference in how you would approach sites of different pirate factions?
