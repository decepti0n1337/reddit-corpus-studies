year after year Devs promise to change, promise to listen, promise to do great stuff but year after year its the same crap - Graphics, Sound, Skins Devs are either unable or unwilling to do what people want. So much has been removed from eve its now a shadow of what it used to be.

War Decing Ruined.

Bounties still useless and pointless.

Ninja moon mining gone.
---
There is more but like CCP my attention span is wavering
---
---
---
I'll take it. I live in Canada so we won't have to do international shipping
---
Dont hide behind downvotes bitches.  Disagree then man up post counter argument

Before I had around 20 seconds to blackscreen off, currently I can count on around a minute.

im out of the loop. why is it probably the last?

they are going some where else no more vegas.
---
If you roll into my bear hole I'm also gonna dock up and not undock, like.. Idk what to say, are you talking shit about null people doe docking up their pve stuff?
---
I'm not gonna undock pvp ships through my bear chain unless it's a quick gank, so..
---
&gt;At first glance, one would think that the super fleet was grossly overkill
---
Because it is you dipshit.
---
ah. thanks
---
What if I told you not all ships had to be a doctrine to be used?
---
So you undocked supers matching their numbers and managed to lose half your fleet. Good job, it seems you have some mining to do tho.
---
Eve bet, eve meet, eve down under...
---
I don't think they said anything that carried any weight
---
Def looks like 2009, same one I bought when I started
---
No i'm the captain fuck this game

CCP has top notch PR
---
Alliance Tournament
---
You cant really. Rorquals have this Module that lets them be unkillable while also being immovable for like 6 mins which gives the  Alliancesunder which these pilots mine enough time to drop tons of capitals on you.
---
because that is broken too
---
Let me help you rewrite this post so it doesn't feel so cringe.
---
We were ratting, got jumped by X WH group. We fought. We lost stuff, they lost stuff.
---
Thanks for bringing it x it was fun. Look forward to our next engagement.
---
Sincerely null group Y
---
Yikes.
---
literally nothing, in fact i think TNT are in fact better pvpers and pve-ers than we could ever hope to be.
---
And I love wormholers always being "out of timezone" and so open to small gang content without pinging a fleet
---
Word of advice: If your alliance bans having fun, go find a different alliance.
---
wrong
---
nice narrative, 
---
but, Intel had them moving down our pipe, we engaged, chased them all over Malpai with a rorqual, finally engaging them on their WH 12 gates or more from our home,  fed them subs to whet their appetite, dropped rorqual on their wh for content.
---
Nobody made you do anything. You did something dumb and people took advantage of you. learn your lesson. That said, who are they and where are they?
---
&gt; Not really so much of a fleet thing though; pure droneboats aren't as popular in most fleet activity and really aren't great for nanogangs
---
If you start to eat shit and need to get out, wont always be time to recall drones. Drones get left behind....a lot.
---
If your enemy starts to eat shit and runs off, you have to either let them run and recall drones, or give chase and leave them behind. Drones get left behind....a lot.
---
Its not unheard of to just go on a little solo roam through null sec and just opportunistically fill up a cargo hold with abandoned drones.
---
But let us have a rare moment of silence for the beloved community team.
---
Lol
---
Hilmar had too much to drink a long time ago, and he's still suffering from the hangover.
---
It dwindles a lot faster when you ignore core gameplay and balance for the better part of a decade
---
Or maybe fleet warp?
---
..what
---
First off, they have a hell of a time balancing what they've got. They aren't going to add more unless there's a niche to be filled. They've already gotten rid of older ships that had overlapping functions.
---
Second, anything "new" won't be limited to new players. Power gamers will try and master it as quick as they can, to profit from it before it becomes stale.
---
AT doubling! Send me your AT... oh...
---
People hate Riot for a lot of reasons, but their political stance isn't one of them. If Tencent did enforce some stance for Riot, they didn't get caught enforcing it.
---
Are you referring to ships or Eve? Because it can go either way. If you don’t want Eve to die, you have it grow.
---
they explicitly said that's why FW suffers.
---
It's not that, and you know it.
---
It's because fortnite is a happy, colourful, instant gratification game.
---
Imagine watching a streamer first having to mine ore hours on end.. Meh, training skills for months, just for him to get blown up by the first lowsec gate he flies through. EVE's really cool in a a dark and gritty way, but that doesn't appeal to the masses that expect instant gratification.
---
Look at fittings that people have lost and understand what the metas are. Zkill will become your best friend
---
I must have missed something. The only new ships I have noticed are the triangle thingos which are way to costly for genuine new players to consider.
---
Well one of the guys that was multiboxing/input broadcasting 40 rattlesnakes in highsec incursions has just been banned.
---
That's a good start.
---
There are indeed many sore losers who have more problems in their life than EVE, but keep in mind that EVE as even a healthy hobby is a long term (Paid) commitment game and during that commitment CCP in the past few years has made tons of promises on which it didnt deliver and instead made some very questionable design decisions. It’s extra frustrating given EVE’s potential. Players have every right to make substantiated complaints.
---
I think CCP is on a good track in terms of improving new player retention, in the area of low and nullsec it’s a different story and I wish I could be more optimistic, but CCP’s own presentations have been quite underwhelming. If they fail to deliver on making significant improvements in the next six months that should even tell you something.
---
Yep really enjoyed that!
---
That's not how it works at all, the point of sprints is not to try and fit something that should take 6 weeks into a 2 week cycle, its to break that 6 week task down into smaller, manageable portions which you can easily complete in 2 weeks.
---
It's been pretty obvious for some time now that CCP's time management is hot garbage so maybe this will help.
---
Not at all, it's worth way more. Buying all those BPOs will cost you 6B, now you have to research them. Some take a few weeks, some take a few months. You get to use them now, without having to wait months. Hell, I'm not even figuring in the time it takes to train the toons.
---
For the Domi BPO, sold.

&gt;brags about it on reddit
---
[ok](https://i.imgur.com/ikBTnL1.png)
---
&gt;  I do like that they announced that they have addressed fundamental developing issues, and look to be at least a little more iterative for the near future
---
lol yeah i will believe it when i see it. CCP said that multiple times, then deliver upon it for 3 patches and back to nothing
---
Wich part of it?
---
I got ganked on low sec station by bumping Archon?
---
I filed ccp-srp?
---
I actually get ccp-srp?
---
There are players in other time zones you know.
---
&gt; Especially the first bit, I know that this is getting a ton of eyerolls from some bittervets
---
thats because they redo the NPE every couple years and it never addresses the actual problem: no guidance on what to do AFTER the NPE beside mine or run highsec missions.
---
So you dripped a super or a cap for basically every single DPS ship they had and managed to kill them because of the WH collapse?
---
Go back to the spod, pls. You are far better at it than shitposting in Reddit. It ain't gonna mine itself
---
Some Chinese groups aligned with pandafam want it. It makes for a good buffer zone since they can defend in GOTG's timezone.
---
Gas planets its hardest to do all in all as theyre the most resource wasting planet.
---
however the setup you have sent in on the imgur is a terrable example, so much wasted power and CPU on 'lanes or roads' that are far too long.
---
i have done this setup on many many planets, and had enough extractors to ensure my factorys run 24/7
---
you dont need maximum extractors to keep everything running on lowsec and nullsec planets. also im pretty sure theres a skill most forget about which gives you mroe accurate extraction amounts and resource location scanning when your first placing on the planet.
---
you could save SO much if you set your planets up better, and makes the roads and lanes short

I quit eve, not returning until it gets better, and from the looks of it I won't have to return ever...
---
Don’t know if the triangle heads will get carriers. Maybe with new fighters then ?
---
Yes they were, but I doubt that it had any correlation with new players retention.
---
We sucked at AT but I’ll X up anyway. It was a factor in uninstalling.   
---

---
I came back yesterday, searched for accelerators, could not find them, asked in the help, they were linked, not an option to show them in the market nor search them on contracts.
---
That was because the casters/interviewers were not instructed properly. The issue was soon fixed and they continued calling the full team name. Understandable for the employees to be wary, after what happened at blizzard.
---
so things have changed since i saw them fine,
---
i did not search for anything i just looked on regional market and went to the sub catagory. trust me, they were there
---
Nope.
---
You are misunderstanding things. Nobody asked for master accels. They asked for canicule accels.
---
even just re doing your pathing to make the paths shorter would probably free up more than the power you need. if nothing else itll give you more power for later
---
&gt;i saw these **under** those Master ones on my jita alt. 
---
UNDER?
---
UNDER!
---
maybe, below?
---
or maybe not the same but a different object some where near it on the list
---
where&gt;?
---
:)
---
Yes, i know however steam player is kinda bad at judging. I don't know if it's worth it, but i am sure CCP know this more than us. Also that scorpion lol

stop nitpicking.

Invite some renters, and tell them you’ll process their ore, and protect them, in exchange for a 10-20% cut

and your answer is still wrong.

Dunno why folk are downvoting this, it's fucking gold.
---
Well I actually do know why, because it's so fucking cringy, but it's so cringy it's entertaining.
---
it does not make my first comment incorrect, only outdated now, glad we got there, shame you did it the most fail way possible
---
Good ideas.
---
I don't think it is
---
shame you fail at understanding what I correct.
---
You affirming "I saw them" and ignoring they are no more, when the person is asking where they are , is a complete fail on you.
---
There's scouts that appear all over, not just invasion systems.
---
I can't believe how shitty the eve RL store is.
---
They couldn't even rename them to "Expired EVE Fanfest 2020".   Be consistent FFS
---
Shhh, let them have their koolaid laced math.
---
The amount of whataboutism in Goons is staggering. Nobody denies there are bots in FRT. Just Goons try to defend the false narrative that they are the only "good" group ... its pathetic, hilarious and cringe at the same time ...
---
Here is a mirror for you ... glad I can help
---
Worth a try.
---
Once you click the accel gate to go into the plex, you cannot be locked/pointed.
---
Fans in spite of, not because of CCP. LOL. That used to be the saying. Said it for years the biggest thing going for Eve Online is too many people with too much time and money invested in it to just drop it.
---
Holy shit that's fucking expensive ...
---
Most likely, but did you see anything else heh.
---
I only skimmed the megathread and saw...yea..
---
Well everyone should have one now, as the hull costs a weekends ISBox-Setups income ... EVE Farms&amp;Fields ...
---
After the players discovered you could put any skin on any ship ccp removed the ability to do it and promised a much improved custom skin builder to replace it. Instead they built an inhouse skin builder, raised skin prices and claimed artist dev time as the reason they took so long to make and were so basic.
---
CCP manage to do in a week what anyone else could do in a single afternoon.
---
&gt;so yeah much ado about nothing.
---
This doesn't get rid of chain booshing. Even a single boosh is now more than we can hope for.
---
I saw 2 Orcas been fucked by trig scouts the other day.... So sad seen those Orca die
---
Agreed. Any time new entities are added or something is moved from one classification to another, there needs to be a one-time popup and a link to a quick walkthrough on how to add those specific entities to the overview.
---
I don't think CCP has proposed enough. Their problem rn is they can't flat-out remove the citadels from FW space because that would piss off a lot of people, but the one possible solution is to just allow no one from FW to actually dock in citadels while in FW low sec. What do you think?
---
Nullsec income was never garbage. 
---
The people who live there are cowards and carebears, which is why incursion alts existed. Now with citadels fortifying ever system they can carebear in peace back home.
---
Reminder that the Drifter in W-space has a 100km ''scram'' but allows you to use MJD but does shut off MWD.
---
Very unreliable Intel channels, that needed some one watching a gate that isn't a window licker.
---
Probably would off improved over time but the bleeding in numbers stopped that.
---
&gt; So this isn't a defence option it's get ganked or don't fly
---
So, the same.
---
Imo they should just make it easy and add them to all overviews on release but I see how that could get annoying to some people. Altho a pop up at least listing the new overview entities would be acceptable.
---
Yeah it's an over statement, but they where reduced do to numbers dropping.
---
Remove or reduce asset safety in nullsec. Bingo, bongo, less citadels, more conflict.
---
So when does PA step in to provide some direction?  Or is this it?  The "direction" yet again is keep Eve in life support while they hurriedly work on the mobile game?
---
Look the ship up on zkill, find losses that are in your price range, and then check the fit. You have to know a little about what you're doing, or you will end up copying a fit that is specialized for doing something you don't plan on doing, or is just plain bad, but it gives you a place to start
---
This guy gets it.
---
Sure, but kiting ships also tend to be way worse at actually running the sites fast.
---
So why are you commenting on a mechanic you are admitting to not knowing about?
---
2013-2015
---
- after Phoebe Lowsec was alive and kicking (2nd iteration of fatigue, 1st was too hard)
---
- highest Login count in that period
---
- not so much Intelbots in Nullsec, roaming still made sense
---
For all the grumpy posts about the state of the game, I still love seeing veterans of the game make jokes like this.
---
Yes, gameplay for their mobile game. I think they left that last part out.
---
I take this post as open permission to wave the finger at all those Negative Nancies who just won't do us the favour of quitting and keep complaining that "reeeee CCP don't care about EVE, game's dead reeeee".
---
You can't have Ponder I'm afraid, he's one of the few rays of sanity in #RC that keep me playing haha.
---
Lackluster? No.
---
Hung over? Quite probable.
---
The ones I spent playing Eve
---
Sure, but you have the security of lots of buffer space and easily accessible heavy assets.
---
The hunters don't.
---
&gt; add scrams in sites
---
A complete rework of warp mechanics would go a long way, but you wormholers don't want to be unable to instantly escape a fight, do you? 
---
This is why you only suggest changes that screw the pve player and not yourself.
---
If the lost isk per hour is lower than replacing ganked ships that don't kite them... we have a new meta and optimal choice.
---
As I said, as more people was winning EVE, intel channel died. The efficiency of said channel was low as you can give a solid intel only when you are dying, which is the only real moment that you see the red, as the DSCAN don't sort blue/red ships. Scouts could help, only when they were logged.
---
This channels weren't reliable anymore.
---
No local works in wormholes because local residents can control the "gates" and close them as they wish, and there is a leak of decent intel in the hunter side. It is not like you can know which wormhole is heavily farmed and stuff. Only Zkillboard could give you some tips, especialy if you are targeting a specific corporation/alliance.
---
The Blackout could only fail because CCP didn't take in consideration the difference between null/wormholes. And their usual incompetence didn't help.
---
Mot knowing the speed of a rat isn't the mechanic were discussing.
---
Sure, why don't we just make them randomly explode? Give it a 1% chance every hour. If it's docked in a Keepstar while exploding, why not explode the whole Keep as well? That would be a way ensuring no one wants to use Caps anymore.
---
Eve won't be a thing in a few years... with the way things are going...
---
This is useful to know for newer players, I know it took me a while of tabbing through the Attributes of several different variants of an item to determine exactly which of the bazillion numbers was different and whether that was a good thing.
---
So glad people are waking up to this, it took so long...
---
They absolutely have to move them or it won't make a difference at all.
---
&gt;  where faction owned Citadels receive a bonus from system control
---
The only reward they should receive in my opinion is existing.
---
Considering how aids Citadels have been all around EVE I truly wonder why people aren't up with them just exploding when the system is taken by an enemy faction.
---
And yes, that would include neutral citadels too.
---
Right. Doing other things in game while mining I've never had a problem with. The issue is when people park a big ass orca on a rock and then walk away for hours at a time. If you're that busy so your irl shit first.
---
GF was a blast
---
If you want a 5 inch ship, it is only about $55 for a model, the collection shows off the hand painted collector's editions which is why it is soo expensive
---
if it was one citadel per planet then half the problems people have with citadels would have never been a big deal.
---
It's currently a number in an attribute box in the database that says 250km. All CCP needs to do is change that number to 500km.
---
The more difficult change would be a script that moves/deactivates/explodes jump bridges in violation of this.
---
One of the cas group here we fought initially a few times on their j5a keepstars and dont think we ever got dded be it they would send haw dreads. Fyi init you man nopolar sad when you moved stuff from j5a during blackout he could go suicide the fleet there as much lol
---
All you must do is pay attention. I've not yet meet an npc that screams in high sec, so anything that expensive should also have enough time to jump out as long as you are paying attention.
---
Yeah I almost bought the Mach skin yesterday for isk. Then I decided not to. Close call.
---
The price ships are very valuable, infusing top 3 alliances with trillion(s) of ISK. While in the grand scale it's not that much, looking at MER it's more than all ships lost in EVE two - three months period normally.
---
Imnl listening. 30 million an hour.
---
I dont agree with weapons timers as they work like capital jump drives and bridges but bubble and tackle should stop people.
---
Roughly 1,875 SP if you get the full 500,000 SP from an injector. About 35 minutes of SP. Much less if you don't get full SP from an injector.
---
The people who choose to live in highsec mining all day are the people who want a playstyle that does not involve paying attention.
---
I'd be fine if they work like normal gates, no jumping when weapon timer is running, HIC tackle only prevents caps, ok with bubbles
---
Just move them to 700km from a gate. I'm pretty sure the reason for the grandfathering is because it would cause issues moving them under 1000km from a gate, but i see those issues as much less bad than leaving them in gunning range of a citadel.
---
Most high sec orca pilots just aren't there. I can count on one hand the number of times I've actually seen one move.
---
Yea back to trolling love it. Bye.
---
i'd rather do a Crimson Harvest again and get drops.. This is weak ass bullshit.
---
Oh for sure. Mining drones were a mistake.
---
This is well thought out, thanks for taking the time to put it together!
---
Its ccp moving is safer knowing them they fo easy way and script to offline it breaks and they offline all the stuff lol
---
99.9% will never be used
---
EVE is dead abandon ship......
---
Do you wanna fly 20 green isobox avatar fleet?
---
I guess that event promotes jusy like that.
---
&gt;Which means it won't be worth their time doing anomalies... which was exactly why black out was shit and people stopped bothering.
---
So you never said it was going to kill krabbing, you just *implied* it. Gotcha.
---
They really should give each player in the game a titan and a super carrier. It will still take tons of time for most to skill into them, but it would be the catalyst for agitation the game needs.
---
Clearly you've never done any sort of nullsec work. How about let us anchor a second gate to make moving them less of a pain?
---
I remember the ballad of the hover nyx
---
It's starting to make sense now, I'm gonna need more carriers.
---
Have the server move the structure in a direct line away from the station every downtime at a rate that would put them outside the 500km range in 1 months time.
---
Always align to a safe point makes warping quicker
---
Making it a one way gate?
---
That's why I'm kinda not holding my breath unless they finally stick to it.
---
I would be would be willing to bet that price comes down some.
---
Keep going.
---
If it's invisible, it's not a threat.  You want to argue about the power of cynos, I'm wiling to talk.  But the name in local isn't a threat.  It's in your head.  Stop being such a little bitch.  Carebears like you are the reason eve is dying.
---
Nudging a player is better than swinging a sledgehammer at them.
---
Except the game hasn't lost about 20% of its playerbase over the course of 6 months before... And there is nothing good on the horizon either, so I don't see why that downward trend should stop...
---
that makes a ton of sense. If i approach the object and i align, i'll stay aligned in one position, right?
---
Summer 2019, never had so much laugh and good times in nullsec since the local was gone.
---
To the downvoters, this was a joke.  The dude made great videos and got tons of people interested in cloaky hunting and wormhole space.  I hope he does make some money.
---
To be honest i have no idea case of bad luck i guess
---
And now we're at least 1000km off the original position, and people start screaming "you're gonna get muh bridge killed!"
---
Prob in lowsec is actually protecting them. Snuff was mining with caps on grid and supercaps ready.  That is about what you would need.
---
Its a scrum/agile thing I presume. Two week sprints with a deployment at the end of each sprint. Often very small iterative changes. Its a practice very commonly used in enterprise development.  The idea in general is smaller more predictable releases, although I having a hard time imagining it would be good for a game dev shop.
---
If they can move the structures that got anchored at deep safes from the recent exploit notice, they can move the gates.
---
I want my 2009 year back. There was a bunch of dude handing out QR codes for 5 Bitcoins, telling me that it'd be the next biggest thing and that I could buy pizza with it. I collected like 40 of those suckers, but never got off my ass to make a wallet to redeem them.
---
I lost them after we had to clean out the apartment and never bothered to think about 'em after then until it was too late.
---
It isnt about creating new content, its about making it take less effort to find the content already there.
---
This is why they needed to unfuck fw 4 years ago.  Eve would still have a loyal pvp contingent of they had.  It's not just fw, it's also all the pirate corps that thrive around it.  Low sex = pvp
---
Unfucking null would be a lot harder cause they need to nerf the blocs, and that would cause mass outrage amongst the blue donut pve crowd
---
It is a totally stupid implementation for anyone that has ever dealt with the health of economic systems ...
---
FYI: This was EVEs by far biggest ISK-Sink. While this was massacred with Farms&amp;Fields the ISK-Faucets in the same time increased by multiple 100% ...
---
Don't worry, CCP will get enough cash from its loyal servants that lick up any kind of shit they produce at any cost...
---
Current PVE meta is injecting 9 rorq alts, getting at least one botting super and essentially not actually ever being at your computer unless it's to log in to Reddit to cry any time CCP tries to balance anything ratting related.
---
Take the upvote. I liked his stuff too.
---
I mean, of course the killer gets punished, but it can easily bypassed with having the other char steal the wreck afterwards without any punishment from CONCORD.  
---
So clearly it's an exploit one way or another, a sanctioned one, but still an exploit.
---
Yeah 20-30 k around the whole world is fucking peanuts.  That's half what it was 5 years ago
---
I could see someone bitching about local tank with 2 rigs, but honestly ive never had an issie with it, i normally only see newer people bitch about it until they realize that T2 hulls really dont need it
---
Goddamn penguins -_-
---
Everyone remembers this gem tho -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T\_x1fYm-VBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_x1fYm-VBk)
---
I've been at it 5 years as of now - I didn't quit (was relating experience from a while back). But I did have some time invested in the game and some ISK, so I could afford to learn.
---
But I'm looking at it from a new players perspective NOW. There's too many other fun games to go play. Most are not going to stick through that crap.
---
&gt; Never in such a short amount of time.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You have a surprising amount of faith in CCP.
---
This isn't even vaguely difficult though?????
---
Like, you're accusing them of being unable to breathe or something as nonsense. It has nothing to do with faith and everything to do with basic logic.
---
F for this video
---
Ah yes the 100-man bomber fleets that just boosh away once the response is there.
---
Clearly you don't.
---
Do a devblog and announce:
---
1.) Grace period of 30 days for already existing asiblex gates. After 30 days gates not 500k off a structure will be offlined and cannot be onlined again until at the correct distance.
---
2.) Chance the timers to on/offline and anchor/unanchor ansiblexes to less than 1 min each while the grace period is running. 
---
3.) Change timers back to normal after the grace period.
---
This would make it relatively fast&amp;easy to move all existing ansiblex gates even if your alliance has dozens of them...
---
I have tried. And I've managed a couple.
---
But as a new player ISK and time are important. A few instant-deaths like that and I move to the next game.
---
Great idea.
---
Eh, having them be insta warps is pretty nice.
---
Move it out of FW - try reading.
---
About the same amount of time as the 2k Nyx that totally worked out
---
How cheap?  I wouldnt pay more than $100 for that.
---
As a TESTie who was at vegas, I can tell you nearly all the major alliance groups were not pleased. The players there seemed to get that it meant basically nothing, given how we already have 99% of gates in place where we need them.
---
With this grandfathering in effect, we're going to be talking about 3-5 years of time before it actually is meaningful, because it will only be effecting regions as groups are evicted or move.
---
See above. It is a good moment to win one of those odds-against-you fights.
---
But for new people it's mostly insta-death, aggravation, and another game.
---
T1 ships. Player could have years of experience, though. Close as you're going to get. Probably fun for the vet at times as well, though.

Did you make a request to reinforce the node?
---
With a GTX 970 + 8GB of DDR3 RAM, pretty similar specs to the ones OP have, it's irritating to run more than 3 accs unless you turn down the graphics, as the game starts to stutter for me.
---
This was my question, plus I thought supers were epic at applying dps to Battleships why didn't they just nuke the Leshaks and Bhaalgorns?

I have fought, won, and died, many times.
---
I was relating this from the viewpoint of a new player with MANY, MANY more options out there to play.
---
If I did it again today, or if I had done it very early in my EvE career, I would have likely moved on.
---
i really appreciate this. can you give me your ingame name?
---
Proving you should be playing Battle for Azeroth instead.
---
Perhaps.
---
loot is so small the loot all button will just be used. should have used cargo containers to big to all be taken at once unless a freighter is used.
---
I have had a Tristan run from my Tristan more than once (for example). I'm guessing they are just d-plexing? Again, FW mechanics are screwed-up.
---
No killrights from this event will be activated.
---
You are one  narcissistic son of bitch aren’t you
---
If he's your favourite thing in TEST why not join SF?
---
People have how long before this change comes out?  A month?
---
Can confirm - everybody was surprisingly refreshing.
---
stop with logical answers
---
Then they can unanchor and reanchor them to a suitable position before CCP runs the script.
---
Something that got skipped over was the color coding on the slides Rise showed. Green where easy and quick changes and red where hard and complex changes.
---
Wait a minute
---
Absolutely this. New players don't have any way to get into PVP early in the game.  Because experienced corps won't take them in, new players are either forced to solo-PVP and get ganged up on or to go to shitty non-PVP corps that don't know what they are doing.
---
Every day, I talk to people who only want to PVP and don't really care about PVE/Mining/etc. There's no viable way for them to get into that early though. And many corporations are part of the problem by being too elitist and not taking in PVP-interested people.
---
You really need to fucking leave VOLTA, your brain is melting into a reddit whiner.
---
You say '2b' fax like its a cheapy, when it is essentially highest possible meta tank in every slot but 1.
---
Got a fax problem?  Use dreads not fucking frigates.
---
(inb4 we should be allowed to teleport frigate gangs all over the place, but you are not allowed to teleport logi help)
---
Pro tip: If you enjoy a game, or are considering playing/replaying a game. Never go to the Reddit sub for said game. It will dishearten you to the point of not even installing it and coming to your own conclusion. 
---
Plus with the sandbox nature of EVE, you can't rely on others opinions on what fun is. You're the content creator. Nothing is linear. I got tired of docking when a Neut/red popped into the system while ratting in my Ishtar. So I decided to pad my killboard while grinding isk. I threw together a decent PVP/PVE hybrid fit on the Ishtar that didn't gimp my isk ticks too much, and then parked two cloaky bomber alts a couple AU away. When a neut/red enters the system, I get excited. Now instead of local salt being "Reeee way to dock up like a carebear." I get "Reeee how about a fair fight?!" Salt is harvested, fun is had, etc etc.
---
How is this different than any fleet ever in null sec.
---
I agree high sec should have 3 minute CONCORD timer so that people who want content but dont want to go where there's content can get a quick fix of some content and be content.  I am also confused.
---
All you need is a few guys in small ships no-one is talking about super umbrellas. That is your definition of PvP but you fail to acknowledge every other type that is used on a daily basis. Conoco for instance undock jam frigates and instantly warp to site and jam the tackle. Not hard but effective
---
Every wormholer I know will continue
---
errr t1 frigs are just as instant death as faction ships if the matchup is against them and its poorly piloted, extremely low actual fight time before havung your fate sealed is a constant in almost all classes of novice plex ships
---
A lot of people farm statics - c6’s are dead but c5 will become more lively
---
now you just need to have a warp scram chain on the boosher and you will be fine
---
tbh that's fair
---
Bro CCP is hungover they aren’t reading this shit.
---
We are not on different sides of this. 
---
But age of chaos scared me far more than the method they are using now. And it was being cheered on by a lot of the same people that wanted big announcements. For me the age of chaos was more or less pronounced dead during these days which is excellent. 
---
Now, was the old method of not doing any changes for the longest time healthy for the game? Fk no, but imo we actually have to give them some time to show us some results. They did form a new group with the mandate of changing anything that needs changing. And a lot faster than usual.
---
Imo, if its really true, thats a huge win. 
---
So for me, even though I would love some direction, I am more than happy if they actually fix the current broken stuff and then give us something bigger, like direction. According to what I saw in theory this is exactly the approach they are taking. 
---
Will it work? I dont know. But I am happy that they learned from their past months mistakes of trying to please the mob. Because the mob is fickle and wouldnt know balance if it slapped them in the face.
---
No. Those aren’t newbie friendly. Do you even play?
---
Stuka fleets are cancer, get gud
---
Here's a thought: lock down its fuel bay/hangar/whatever until it is moved. That way the owner has a little more control over the move and the gate is useful until it runs out of fuel.
---
Disclaimer: I've only used one of these once and don't understand all the mechanics involved. Any bad ideas posted are the result of ignorance.

as a wh who dies alot in null i would be happy with just a delay on local, the gate timer idea sounds reasonable. maybe iterate on it after some months but some sort of delay would be great. so would be delaying the perfect intel bs we have nowadays. get ppl in space if you want intel not just right click on your dotland tab. plus maybe a reconsideration on what should be available through esi, i mean the fact i can see when an ihub is vulnarable on dotland is bs.
---
And if a stargate or npc structure is on the other side?
---
Seriously, think through the possibilities when suggesting things, guys.
---
I'm sorry, your logic that the AT ships are not worth anything because they weren't won by big blocs in last 3 AT's is just... beautiful. 
---
So please, tell me, how much ISK did change hands to fit the ships for the AT?
---
That’s the same CPU from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bhz38x/update_on_my_cloaky_camping_thread/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) different GPU and a LOT more RAM.
---
It was fun meeting you in person BBTB :)
---
My friend drew this and I asked him if I could post this. He didnt want his reddit or eve usernames added bc opsex
---
the sisters of eve epic arc?
---
because it's shit. it's a bunch of poorly paid courrier missions. it's tedious and absolutely shit. i know, because i do it every 3 months for the pretty good faction standings boost - which would mean absolutely nothing to a new player.
---
edit: the tutorial missions that i abuse for the skilling spree rewards on my alts are more engaging than the sisters of eve epic arc.
---
How do you think that would work?
---
the 1400 arty looks like dog nipples. 10/10
---
or ccp could just leave everything alone and quit throwing shit at everything.
---
I "started" the game a few times over the years and wanted to like it, never played more than a couple of weeks.  Now I am absolutely hooked on it, the difference was people.  It's really hard to get into this game if you're on your own.  Not impossible, just difficult.
---
Probably because this game is really boring if you aren't playing it with friends.
---
Have people reformed anywhere else or is everyone all over the place? I assume the core group aren't playing anymore?
---
I worry they'll make the PLEX balance icon bigger and even more intrusive
---
[https://imgflip.com/i/3elqwf](https://imgflip.com/i/3elqwf)
---
SOE is fucking terrible. I haven't bothered with any of the "epic arcs" since trying that
---
What escalation?  You’ve caught people in a bearhole, what are they gonna escalate with?  Another Nestor?
---
It just keeps pushing.
---
There is virtually 0 chance they are perfectly aligned.
---
If by day 31 it's not outside 500km, it explodes.
---
Nyx actually looks great
---
I thought I also saw him post a few months back that in addition, he hasn't had a quiet place to set up the mic and camera. Take that with a grain of salt tho, since I haven't been able to find said post.
---
they don't?
---
I don't, I just thought this was another one of those "throw out wild ideas to make your corner of space better suited to you and nobody else" threads.
---
Headhunter have always been a seasonal thing afaik.
---
ppl to talk to that can help you, eve i a realy hard game 
---
whitout the swedish chat* and a irl friend that played eve i would have quit after 2 days 
---
*a long time ago there was like 20 something native language chats runned by ccp untill ppl abused them and they dident have ppl moderating the chats
---
Is the game dying? No, CCP made a lot of unpopular changes this year that moved the game towards fueling micro transactions and lost a significant amount of players. Some of those changes being drifters in nullsec, and a nullsec local blackout were rolled back. Since then players have started playing again and numbers are coming back to what they were last year.
---
As an alpha your ability to make ISK is not great, but its possible depending on how you play. If you like the game I would highly recommend subscribing as Omega is really where its at, you can make a lot more.
---
Play as alpha, have fun, you will get hooked.
---
I just rename them if I don't need them anymore (tip: They are alphabetically ordered. Rename to put them at the bottom). 
---
They are too bulky to be transported anyway.
---
tis nice, like a dream, in spaceships, in space, in the internetwebs
---
Tried.
---
Only works in Jovian space.
---
Seeding caps is done over a long time - there are many ways to carry out an eviction but you are right it takes time and a good strategy but evictions happen all the time and can be lucrative. At the risk of being flair bated you can field a thousand dudes - if you took one thousand Jackdoors in you’d stomp any WH entity no matter the number of caps they have in home
---
This is the problem IMO.
---
Why are you focusing on the NPE at all at this point? Whilst this might sound strange but here's an uncanny idea, Maybe the whole reason your trying this for the 13th time is because the idea was flawed to begin with.
---
Are things too complicated that you have to have a massive NPE behind it? 
---
 
---
Simplify it. Keep the depth, that's good but go ahead and revisit the actual mechanic. Some of these mechanics are untouched after how many years.
---
We are so wrapped up in making the shortcut to ghostville look really good so that people can get there, that ghostville is filled with issues that experienced players know how to step over and new player's don't. 
---
No one seems to have stopped to think about basic inconsistencies in menu's, or functionality that make the learning curve so simple to require such a vast "NPE". (To give credit where it's due, some system's have gotten more simple some on a positive note and others to their detriment, and others have gotten more advanced/complicated with both pro's and con's)
---
get gud mate they already "fixing" the missions
---
Or just 'X'
---
EVE's complexity is heavily overstated. A lot of it is pretty straightforward skinners box reward system shit with a nice wrap around it. Industry is another thing. It's not complicated, in fact it's all highly linear in terms of how materials end up as ships. 
---
On a meta level there is some complexity, but not in a manner that hinders your average joe from getting around in most areas of the game, assuming he can read and comprehend some basic stuff.
---
There should honestly be a "free move" mechanic created just for this situation. Players carefully chose where to put the gate; they should be able to comply with this change with a minimum of required effort.
---
Some ephemeral item like a filament that the jump bridge will let someone with the right permissions take, and then go use somewhere else...if the spot is legal, it moves on the next downtime.
---
Then just set a cut off date, after this date, the last moves happen; all ephemeral items get deleted, as do any gates that are still not legally placed.
---
Then, next time this comes up.... just do the same thing. Its not the first time structure distance rules changed and stuff needed to move; this feature will get used again.
---
how many other people logged on to see event, realized it was another giveaway, then logged back off?
---
Why are you mad? I just asked a question
---
t2 abcs with xl weps

glass cannon dreads

I was holding down Capitol adjacent systems.  This was not just intended to catch boring ratters, but response fleets.  They stopped coming after a while, and without their support the ratters quit undocking.
---
 Holding the pod gives him time to unplug, never hold the pod.
---
Dual web no point works really well if you're letting them come to you, in my experience. I almost never fit a point on my "waiting for pvp" fits, maybe 1 in 15 warp off.
---
I'd agree with all of this except the Jump Fatigue removal. I do think it needs to be reworked though, to more accurately fit it's intended purpose of making it more difficult for defenders to instantly react to any threat and easier for attackers to exploit weaknesses.
---
Problem with outright removal of Jump Fatigue is that we'll get an even worse state of stagnation than we already have. Never forget 2014, with *literally the entire map* being a 50/50 split between N3 and CFC.
