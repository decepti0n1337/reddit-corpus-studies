Lowering the power would be fine.
---
Tune it down and it means instead of easily tanking a huge dread blob you are bleeding supers over time, as it should be. 
---

---
(yes currently you bleed fax) 
---
This pleb out here with a tritanium keycap, you need that bright spod key man.
---
So it's more that Rattles would be good at (attempting) to contest/hold grid against carriers or HAW dreads because they can potentially defang a carrier or camp outside of HAW range, rather than that Rattles are all-around decent fleet botes?
---
If you are the leadership of a group, and the group becomes elitist and entitled, the blame is likely on you.  Why not just purge the people you have a problem since you are the ones running the group?
---
What does that make W4RP then? Pets of pets. You couldn't be that low even if you were a renter.
---
na. just "officially" the past.....part of a week.
---
unofficially,  its been common raids cause geminate is like the tall grass in pokemon,  its where you go when you need to find content somewhere, and dont know whats going on.    content is guarenteed in gemi
---
So basically it's whatever length of time fits your narrative.
---
its obvious the OP was flair baiting, that doesn't really have anything to do with how horde is acting like they accomplished something besides riding NC's fleet to the winners circle.
---
Can confirm, my gf is Finnish 
---
Rather have the thing that kills stuff on the 'no real counter' list then the thing that prevents stuff from dying tho.
---
aren't you proud?
---
" Panfam is a coalition " when they feel like it and aren't to busy try to act like they are all separate and powerful entities who don't need no blues to hold their space.  
---
" And you blame PH for being helped by NC? " And I didn't "blame" them for anything, I simply pointed out there's an awful lot of hordlings making noise on reddit like they accomplished something when in fact all they have done is lose subcaps and call in big daddy NC to win the supercap fight for them while a handful of their alliance members join the NC superfleet.

Wrecks despawn after 2 hours m8
---
Pretty much. I as waiting for Test to park a ship full of Tea in perimeter so we could dress up as Indians and..well you know. 
---
when you make a point, you usually provide evidence when making it.
---
not like, "hah it's your job to disprove my statement without facts supporting"
---
this is like...a basic life skill.
---
I was wondering why Titans/supers weren't on standby to login and get in on moments notice?
---
With all the MER stats, Legacy should have had a far larger Titan fleet/Sup fleet capable of  knocking out Panfam and have spare to defend Homeland or am I wrong? (It's a genuine question) probably missing some of the things.
---
It needs to be buffed, I agree. Add another X or two to the training time modifier. Yes need to have a larger drawback for being so versatile.
---
Yeah
---

---
Colored it.  Panfam is 9/10 of the list.
---
One of the things you'll find out as you research the game is the skill system, and how on the surface it will appear that older players have an inherent advantage and you can never catch up. This is false.
---
Everything in the game is based on your skills, which train in real time. So while you will probably never catch up to someone who's been playing for 15 years in total skill points, you don't really need to. Any particular activity (example: flying a tackling ship) has a finite number of skills associated with it. Once you max those out, you're just as good as anyone else. The only difference is, older player have more options. But even then, the difference between a maxed out character and a pretty good character is usually about 5-10%.
---
So don't get discouraged if it looks like starting fresh is going to be an issue.
---
Must be a lot of suspense in GoTG about right now.
---
To be honest I, we were very surprised that they were not better prepared for their own trap??? The logistics of moving supers and titans to a seige war is a pain in the ass for sure. Defending Geminate was a lot of fun and fairly easy as we had no logistic issues at all. Standard practice of Test station spamming and then having to defend them was far worse of a grind for them and the line members.  I expect a lot of structure timer clean up in the near future. Time to cook some ammo up! 
---
No I actually am a shut in NEET in my neighbors basement because my parents kicked me out at 39
---
I think you meant that to read: Hobos batphones everyone that will answer because God forbid a fight happens.
---
Nope. This is the internet. It's your job to prove me wrong just like all the other threads stating it  
---
Everyone says we are renters. 
---
Even if we lost it all tomorrow, it's a win in money and content. Not sure what kind of mistake we could make here. Explicitly talking about Perimeter, not Geminate.
---
The stated objective of the campaign was for TEST to force Horde to give up the hisec attacks, it wasn't achieved, nor TEST has corneredmost lucrative trades in hisec.
---
The problem here is Horde can easily gate to perimeter and TEST has to JC everytime. Moment they get busy elsewhere, hisec assets are in danger.
---
I guess all of this was bothering them enough to go forth with the campaign.

Not our fault pgl had to rewrite his deployment post 3 times or more
---
The Goon circle jerk has arrived! What took so long?
---
Training SP isn't an active activity. It's a fair point, but it really depends whether you measure it by potential SP you've missed out on or potential ISK lost. I almost never extract anything and certainly never from characters that are flying T3s with any regularity so it's not for me.
---
I can acknowledge that I've been a consultant for certain horde adventures in high sec :P
---
Thats how they got new players before alpha clones. Not alot of flies stuck to the honey, but the ones that did stayed for years.
---

but where are the goons everyone is going on about?
---
Someone from Test talking narrative after what Hedliner spewed out.
---
Oh the irony.
---
There's almost zero overlap in their real world usage.
---
How does what PGL writes change reality?
---
We've been up there for months, then PGL writes a post and suddenly we've only been up there for a week?
---
How does that even make sense?
---
Must be new here?
---
We couldn’t have done it without you NCPL. PANFAM best Fam.  You happy now garreth?
---
No matter how many times you see this, it never get's any less amazing. 
---
&gt;hey now, its was really important for him to tell the additional dreads to "have a cyno in the extra mid slot" xD
---
Cyno in a mid slot?
---
This is a lot like asking whats the point of battleships if they can't kill frigs.
---
You would use supers to kill dreads. Dreads/carriers to kill things BC and up. Remove a turrent/launcher + highslot from all CBCs and give them an additional role bonus of tracking/explosion velocity/drone app as applicable. 
---
Further reinforce the idea that a size up kills things 1-2 sizes smaller, but you need smaller stuff or meme fittings to apply below that. Seriously, we murdered tracking titans once before for a god damn reason. 
---
Also, change boson to apply MUCH less to frigs/dessies/ Vanilla cruisers. 
---
Your flair is confusing
---
Just create a new character, transfer ceo and biomass afterwards?
---
Takes 2 minutes at most 
---
So is my sexuality
---
Except it kind of wouldn't?
---
A Ferox without any projection mods can push 81 km optimal range with Iridium, or up to \~94.5 km with Tungsten. Without links/mods/resebos a Ferox gets \~93.8 km lock range. With Spike you have a theoretical gun range of \~122 km optimal, and a bit more DPS than faction Tungsten, but the cap endurance is significantly worse.
---
Iridium/Spike DPS is \~275-280. Sure Meson on a Drekavac *spools* to a higher peak, but even with three damage mods the DPS starts at the same point.
---
And keep in mind that said Ferox sports no range mods, for either projection or targeting.
---
If superdank range and DPS was all that you needed to have the bestest fleet BC ever then everybody would be flying some variation of sniper Nagas or megapulse Oracles, which can both push 700+ DPS at ranges of 60+ km.
---
A BNI version of the dual TC/1600 plate 'fleet' fit you linked doesn't have as much EHP, and needs an ACR, but with dual TCs, dual locus rigs, and a sebo it can load Spike and fire out to \~130 km. You can load Iridium and fire out to \~86 km optimal with 377 DPS- this is \~100 more than the pre-spool damage you get out of Meson on the Drekavac.
---
With slightly better speed and agility the BNIs can keep/pull range quite easily, while still staying out of warp range.
---
Arguments of booshing into the BNI-equivalent fleet with the Drekavacs to abuse their superior brawling characteristics ignore two things:
---
\- the enemy *always* gets a say, in this case being "we boosh you back/boosh ourselves away/kill your booshers"
---
\- your entire statement is predicated on the idea that the Drekavac does the Ferox's job *better* than the Ferox.
---
Granted I brought up the BNI as a point of comparison... because said BNI is basically pretending to do the same job- it also doesn't do it quite as well (it needs dual TCs+dual T2 locus rigs to get comparable projection, and doesn't have the PG for a 1600 plate to get equivalent EHP, but it does have superior DPS and tracking), and being armor tanked is broadly comparable to the Drekavac- particularly in terms of the slot layout.
---
And again if super duper range was all it took then everybody would be flying sniper ABCs or sniper battleships.
---

I'm pretty sure Horde had like almost half the supers on that dread dunk BR. Which of the three alliances that showed up for that side would be the majority. They can chestbeat all they like.

Only difference is factory planets are much more viable without the absurd poco taxes.

Oh no, they didn’t show up to defend the final timer and their fort was destroyed too!  Maybe wait for the book to get finished before you send it off to publication bud.

Have you tried not bitching like a pussy publicly and just messaging the mods? Probably not, you should try that first.
---
Theyve been weeded out. The publicity of dank ganks had ushered in a swarm of would be gankers and as in nature the surge of predators leaves a wanting of prey. Now starve or scavenge the scraps of our golden era of prosperity.
---
aye,  always wondered about that. sorta assumed it got paid in beer
---
step 1) find a group roughly the same size as you, ideally slightly smaller.  
---
step 2) start beating them up and taking their space.  
---
step 3) if smaller group is part of a coalition, throw down against their coalition a few times, even if you loose. if they are not part of a coalition, congrats you've taken their space.  
---
step 4) if coalition is involved, decide if you like their coalition enough to join, if you do negotiate a cease to hostilities in exchange for you keeping space/helping out. If you don't want to join their coalition, find who doesn't like them, and make agreements with that group in exchange for space.

As the top trash roleplayer, this is accurate.
---
By the numbers they had 27 titans out of 67 and 24 supers out of 49 listed, they were fighting for their own space and were 42% of the combined super numbers, they canchest beat about super numbers all they want, imperium showed up north at x47 that supers don't win supercap fights, DD's and titan guns do. All supers do is drop fighters and add to the TIDI.
---
Caps do make a huge difference in fozziesov tho. For example, It'd be hard to do fuck all against an enemy that uses caps to entosis without caps of your own.

You are the last of a dying breed of Eve pests that refuse to be eradicated, with the last true blooded species of goon bee nearly extinct it falls entirely on your shoulders Rageliner to remain the belligerent fun ruiner of Eve, spoiling every gudfite with obnoxious compositions, indefensible shitposting and inappropriate for child content. If you go down the cultural revolution of the Imperium then may all the toxic shitlord ghosts of PL past forever ruin your enjoyment of spaceship warfare and may you be haunted forever in a never ending hellcamp of Lowsec drake warfare.

Full time student at university?

Don't play EVE then if you still care about your GPA

I will never understand why the north seems to have such an aversion to admitting to being a bloc. When in reality if they could just admit it to themselves and take the next step towards fight like a bloc by organizing and standardizing their efforts across their varied alliances they could be so much more effective.

Maybe an exception for RocketX tho, he must be at least 15 now because he got his first super kill with his first mouse button press.

Can I sell from a cargo container inside a ship inside another ship?
---
If SMA could hold unassembled ships, you could move 3x more ships in a Dread than you could in a Jump Freighter which costs 7x more. And if it was made smaller so that it could move a reasonable amount of unassembled ships, you could hardly fit any assembled ones 
---
wait for the goons to roflstomp u
---
I'm not against a nerf of the fax, more about balancing. 
---
Dreadbomb needs a counter but not a hard counter.  Currently fax bomb is probably just below a hard counter.  If the test dreadbomb didn't make mistakes they would have killed supers/Titans it wasn't just the fax that stopped this alone
---
Even remove/reduce the insurance payout on dreads. 
---
That would probably break POS codes

Moros is really a shitty dread

Legacy alone could never beat Panfam.Horde? Sure, but not the combined forces.

Considering that horde maintained market dominance for many, many months and TEST lost it within weeks I don't think TEST gets to keep the crown of "most autistic" anymore

At some point, the predators will eat all the prey. You need new prey for the ecosystem to sustain itself. There is no new prey. 
---
This is the opposite, this nerfs dreads so much harder than all the other caps.
---
I mean I guess that's kinda true for the Kikimora because it's pretty fast in a shield/MWD fit but it's still thin as fuck and do you *really* want to ram and facebrawl something that you were trying to kite presumably because it's either a better brawler than you are or else has a scram (or a friendly blob) at which point you get caught and die?

Like chain dropping Azbels that go down mostly uncontested within days or hours makes us lose dominance somehow.

I think he's referring to the amount of DPS it can tank?

Pretty easy.

Ice or miner 2/ cloak in highs
---
Small shield booster, small cap battery mid
---
Bricked mining or ice upgrades in low.
---
Rigs and 2 mid slots for shield deflection amplifier to flavor of space.
---
For EM/Thermal resists need a faction amplifier. Also might not be cap stable for needing the extra resists
---
Orbit 3000m activate shield booster, drones out, AFK for 15 minutes.

You can add a tractor beam to clean up wrecks or swap a sensor boost for the cap battery but you won't be cap stable

Eve is definitely worth trying. As a college student the only thing that might become an issue is comms. Unlike other games, the best parts of eve almost require you to have a microphone and be talking/ engaging with other players this way. If you’re in the dorms it might be harder to do this given quiet hours/roommates, etc. 
---
Doesn’t make the game unplayable but something to keep in mind. Definitely give eve a try and don’t be afraid to ask stupid questions. 
---
What do you expect people to smug over in EVE subreddit? ASMR?

B: Since November.

I'll message the mods, thanks for the encouraging and thoughtful trolling

This is why you're losing market dominance by the way, you have no idea how the highsec markets work or the level of effort needed to make it worth doing.

newsflash traders don't care how shiny the outside of the citadel is and in a high-volume item like PLEX which can be transported in complete safety nearly instantly, the product sells so fast the lifetime of the structure is irrelevant

Thank you CCP! Super useful

dude your last comment was full of garbled syntax, at least i was just meming
---
Well, then don't. Whatever dude. What are you even made about? First of all we can form fleets on our own just fine, TEST and Legacy that is, and since supers aren't a thing in highsec... We probably are fine. Second this is a success, even if you wanted to spin this to somehow not be, if the numbers provided are correct we are making a shit ton of money and get quite some sub cap content on top. What the fuck are you even bitter about? I seriously don't get it.
---
Nah, go the whole way, reset that shit to zero. Make dropping caps meaningful and risky again
---

T3c skill loss isn't the worst thing these days, but echoing the other posters, how about capital skill loss. As in, you die in a capital, you lose something like let's say all capital skills related to that tier of cap, or lower. Lose a dread, you lose all racial dread skills plus weapon skills, maybe other fittings could stay the same. Lose a carrier and lose all of those plus dread weapon systems. Lose a Titan and lose anything higher than advanced spaceship command. It would give meaning back to dropping caps, and theoretically extend the end game as skill and leadership ability would really have to be matched up properly with sp level, something which was severely distorted with injectors
---
Very interesting. Appreciated

Can someone enlighten me on the history of who French Connextion are besides just a small TEST vassal? Looks like they are [about a year old](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007916/stats/), but I haven't really noticed them mentioned in any large PVP related BRs. They don't appear to have much in the way of active [Super pilots](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007916/supers/), and their killboard looks like they just harass Frat all day.

Super carriers have +5 warp core strength, does that mean a warp scrambler doesn't turn off their MWD?  Does the warp scrambler still shut off the MWD, but they can still warp/jump away? What forms of Electronic warfare are they immune to? Does that include normal warp disruptors, stasis webifiers? 
---
This is funny. We didn't even know anything was happening. Nor are with with NSH. I spit my drink out laughing at this.

You are dead on bud.  They were the leadership and they were the ones that were entitled.  I'll be honest, I had fun with the group they lead, and I felt like I could become something more with his group.  Then they pulled this shit off over christmas break.  They don't run fleets, don't respond, don't communicate to the 100s of people with shit in the hole, and actively roll everyone out in the middle of a war with the North.  So yeah, I am a little salty with the people who lead the group saying it became elitist and entitled, as if that is anyone's blame but their own.
---
something something something, horde resetting people and going to war with GOTG, NC sitting on the fence and pretending not to take sides. Honestly I think its still funny you guys call it panfam, when pandemic legion is all but gone and NC is the real powerhouse holding everything together at this point.

Just a couple of points from our side.
---
Yes we're parting ways with BAT but they've been inactive save for 2 or 3 members for the last 2 years. Kismeteer and I discussed their change of direction at length prior to the announcement internally and the split will be 100% amicable. We wish them luck and are sure that in the future a new BAT will cross paths with us again. 
---
As for the corps that have left, we said good bye to ISRAD and WAFFLES last year, both needed to go off and do other things to help get their members to a better place. We then merged two older corps with inactive leadership into another corp, and removed what was left after doing so and proceeded to recruit four new corps in the autumn. The result of this corp shuffling and consolidation is actually a net increase in active people, which last time I checked was a positive thing.
---
... are you spod?
---
I love how much you leave out.
---
  I want to point out that you, Elron, and anyone else that decided to leave with you did quite a few things that left everyone in the dark.
---
First off, there was a group discord for the group and you locked all channels on it.  You could have just left it, but instead prevented any easy communication between people in the hole.  You also rage rolled all the holes and made sure to roll people out if you could help it(you managed to successfully roll out my alt, good job!).  
---
Second off, good job powering down all the structures BEFORE you left goons so you could ref it right into a final timer.  Seeing as how no one else has access(not even the other member of holding corp, who is still a goon with a sense of integrity).

Third off, you left on good terms. But you left without telling anyone in the group or leaving ANYONE in charge.  So we had to bust our own asses to get good comms.  So we got people back in the hole, only to discover that you started bashing all the structures of the alliance you just left.  Pretty bad form tbh.  Even still you anchored a structure and kept rage rolling til you realized that there were a decent amount of us local.  Once we got an interceptor fleet in(small one too!) and reffed your raitaru, you gave up.  Finally, I just want everybody to hear that instead of fight us, you gave up once you realized there was the smallest amount of resistance.  We didn’t bat phone, you were ran off by the old members of your squad that you burned.

[I dare you to to come protect your final timer next week.]  (https://i.imgur.com/yKeV36y.png)  Who knows, we might find your spines in there.
---
They didn’t add rorquals to get alpha clone people to stay, it was to get vets to inject mining alts. And the skill extractor/injector is also pretty much exclusively geared towards omega clones, since it’s not hard to realize that buying tons of alpha injectors isn’t very isk efficient compared to going omega. 
---
big bad skillu always picking on the poor little guy smdh
---
I regret my life choice of attempting to engage you in conversation; cya on grid friend.
---
Yeah. How are you Excel skills?
---
Grrr hat dino

Grrr hat gon 
---
^This is such an easy conclusion to reach /u/Jestertrek. I know you plainly stated there is no way to count how many are Alpha vs Omega, but surely you need to consider this fact before declaring the game is stagnant, no?
---
Because you are probably reading a cache save, CtrlF5 to reload it fresh and it should show as removed for you.
---
This makes me very happy 
---
Bots to keep you from complaining about bots. They've become self aware.
---
It's not his fault. Kathy can only think about himself. It's a personality trait from his parents not acknowledging his success. He will single-handedly fix the group and make sure everyone know what an amazing job he did. 
---
He wrote that the official deployment started Saturday. Then he got dunked and the official deployment is canceled, and it’s back to smaller stuff except when they have goons to do the heavy lifting 
---
Yeah I've never been very good at staying on message, tbh
---
"TEST" isn't a coalition. 
---
The rest of Legacy isn't deployed north. 
---
What is this about roaming gangs, TEST? Maybe once a day, and even that in a shitty tz?
---
So many times I've logged on and Geminate standing is so bored, they go chase a Wolf 10 jumps with 100 dudes in tow...
---
what you don't get is that they don't want to be a block. NC would love to farm horde. GOTG wants to be a sort of deviant sex cult not hard line members. horde will fucking shoot each other without someone to whelp into. PL might as well not exist. only pressure from outside pushes them together.
---
Alright. No Biggie. But then you can't use covert cloaks on any of them.
---
Take your pick.
---
Ignore this advice. Eve will teach you spreadsheets better than most uni courses.
---
They certainly can't be used to hold the field, but if you get 100+ of them, each doing ~800 DPS, they can kill a capital very quickly. It wouldn't take them long to chew through a buffer FAX.
---
"Eat a dick Brent " made me chuckle
---
The combination of Rorquals, supercap/carrier ratting, and injectors is creating runaway inflation.  It's not good for the game.  
---
Cool. Doubling down on stupid is a killer strategy. 
---
I've been meaning to remap to that but  never actually get around to doing it. 
---
I just pulled the plug on 2 accounts.  Feels good man.  I'm out!
---
JC deployment for quite some time, official "start" last week or like 2 weeks ago you started doing more stuff like trying to deploy fortizars in null
---
wardeccers had to make a new move.
---
 Admit defeat? Hardly
---
We just showed the entire north how 1 alliance can cause them to shit their pants. I am sad we are dropping pressure as I enjoyed hunting horde like the dogs they are, however we need to regroup and then be warned panfam. TEST is aiming for your fucking jugular. Crab safely while you can.
---
With regards, Dreddit
---
If I had more than one upvote to give I would (ironically I don’t want to use multiple accounts or bots to do so lol).  
---
The data is good, but I suspect this truth is covering up the losses of actual players so that the game only appears stagnant.  
---
In EVE it’s far too easy to multi-box or bot (they’re intrinsically related) as a symptom of being too mechanically simple on the most basic level of foundational mechanics. The game also quite heavily incentivizes the practice of multi-boxing or botting by rather effectively providing a linear or even exponential increase in power that scales with the number of accounts a single person commands.  
---
It’s one of the most fundamental flaws with the game but CCP has little incentive to fix it because it increases revenue, at least for what seems to have managed to be a lengthy amount of time. It will only come to bite them in the ass when enough people are fed up that they quit, leaving less content for other players (especially in a PvP-centric sandbox), incentivizing remaining players to quit and so on recursively.  
---
It’s definitely one of the major reasons (though not the only one) that I’ve quit or haven’t played consistently over the years because it has become more and more pay to win, whether that’s a function of time (less offensive) or money which has been the current trend with things like skill injectors (big culprit) propped up by PLEX as a way to convert real-world currency into time/ISK in EVE. Those 2 systems as examples aren’t so bad independent of each other, but together form a potent, poisonous potion.  
---
Honestly monoclegate wasn’t quite as bad in some respects, CCP was ahead of the curve in cosmetic micro-transactions there (the infamous monocle was useless besides as a point of pride in a cosmetic dick-swinging contest). The real sin there was the outrageous prices for the time (which are still relatively outrageous by today’s standards if you look at successful games that employ a cosmetic microtransaction model). Except for just stupid things for people that have more money to burn than sense, the most expensive cosmetics cap at around $35 USD in Dota 2 for “Arcana” quality items that modify ability icons, voice lines, hero visuals (model and/or effects) etc. The pitfall there is if you stray too far from the original design of something that the cosmetic variation is potentially unrecognizable or too similar to another design, giving an advantage from the potential confusion.  
---
Anyway, talking much more on the subject is just extra free advice for CCP, so I’d rather not detail things any further without some form of compensation. Though if they wanna hire me in some way I'm not fully opposed :P

While trying to revive your dead corpse of an alliance, now clinging to Horde/NC for life support, it's generally not a great idea to shit talk the former corps that you and PL leadership dragged through the mud of failure of a three-year streak of bad decisions. You're  desperately trying to keep talent and get more corps to rebuild, not chase future corps away with your mouth. Public perception of what's left of the husk of PL is everything now. Just sayin'
---
Wow so goons self-destructed a bunch of stuff for no reason! That's crazy stuff.
---
I'd love to see CCP's estimations on actual people instead of alts, I wonder how the numbers would compare
---
Maybe James 315 was right all along?
---
Don't like to lose SP when you get caught?  Don't fly them then.  Problem solved.

GOTG - "is a cyno proc a campaign?"

I mean... it worked out rather well

I think we beat CAS in terms of being first to be organized, but our group mostly dissapated by the end of 2015, whereas theirs is still going strong.

" only pressure from outside pushes them together. " something something, lets all go dog pile test and evict them, totally equals outside pressure.

My [first t00nie](https://evewho.com/pilot/kadael) started April 2004 just after the Castor deployment, and Battlecruisers didn't exist.
---
Funfact, when the BC BPOs were introduced their research time was bugged so you could make one copy every second.
---
Standard supercarriers have a +5 bonus to warp core strength per level of racial carrier, for a maximum of strength of +25.
---
An MWD can always be disabled with a warp core scrambler, regardless of warp core strength.  
---
A supercarrier may always warp or use its jump drive unless its warp core strength is exceeded by the number of points tackling it, or if it is in an interdiction sphere.

So is it a week, or since November?

Why is this so hard?

We're reporting corps of significance moving about, with no animosity, and with a view to what new alliances might emerge going forward.  
---
Give us a POC or a diplo we can contact when we/I notice things happening in PL so that I can more accurately reflect the news when it pertains to your alliance. We appreciate and really try to be as well rounded in our reporting as possible.

---
Tho you're probably right that I'm wrong about the Osprey having no mining bonus.  I can't for the life of me remember what it had before, so it's probably the mining bonus that eventually moved to Logi much later.  HOWEVER the Vexor still outmined it with Harvesters (that eras excavators) 
---
TEST may as well be a coalition on its own. Not like any other member alliances add anything of value.
---
Big oof.
---
I'm p sure I'm wrong about the Osprey-not-having-a-miner-bonus thing.  I used to fit heat sinks on my Thorax because the description sounded better than Magnetic Field Stabilizer 
---
I run a completely different setup where I have 1 through 6 for highslots qwert for mids and so on. Shift as heat modifier.

Any before June of 2008, I couldn't tell you. That's when I first joined, and I pretty much did things like mining and pve in that time. But I can't honestly say it had a mining bonus then either. Those first few months were a blur for me!
---
Replace the MTU with your own, enjoy free ore.
---
That was probably the bot owner noticing rather than the bots evolving.
---
Reality is a tough pill to swallow. Just sayin'
---
Quack
---
You think a 'beta player' would know this.
---
Arguments for/from Authority are fallacious for this exact reason.
---
Better than swallowing anything you have to produce.

Hey, some evacced their stuff, some self destructed.  Different strokes for different folks.  Your point?
---
That's not a bad idea
---
Corp name checks out with that fit
---
Yes logi dont. 
---
Swallowing is what you're good at. You might enjoy it. &lt;3
---
Its also generally not a great idea to be an ignorant buffoon but you seem to be having a pretty good go at it. Never change, Valk. Though if you do, hit me up, we're still recruiting and I would love to have a go at distilling some of that aged bitterness into sweet passion.
---
This binary nature (helldunk or blueballs, as the goons say) is part of the symptom.  People log off from hunters because they have no other recourse.  The hunters are too strong for them to fight back in any ship they have barring an exact mirror match of kite hunter bullshit.
---
If you enjoy the gameplay, you can be quite effective as a newer player in EVE.  The way the skill system works, you can specialize in one area, max it out, and be as good as (or better than) a veteran player.  
---
The biggest thing, though, is to find a group of players to play with.  This should go without saying as it's an MMO, but in many MMOs the "multiplayer" part is not super crucial for the first few weeks/months.  EVE can be quite daunting and almost too sandboxy in a way, so not having a resource to push you in the right direction can be incredibly frustrating.
---
Good luck! If you get stuck or have questions, feel free to message "Elise Randolph" in game. 
---
I think that's how we coped with the early grind of Eve - blur :D
---
I spit not swallow. You're not my type. NPH maybe, or Harrison Ford. I don't go for manchilds like you.

There's been a lot farmed over the years.

It is my own opinion that I formed while playing this game for 14 hours a day for three years before and during the transition from Dominion to Fozziesov.
---
Nobody is chestbeating about super numbers lol
---
NPH.... Yeah I'm not that type and EVEN I would consider it. 
---
&gt; That was probably the bot owner noticing rather than the bots evolving. 
---
I mean evolving because it's not a generic Alpha hauler, but an Omega, and using boosts in a ship specialized for the task.
---
I wonder how much volume it would take
---
Ah, right. That's true, I wonder how they did it before.
---
I'm more a cross between Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland.
---
It's either it stays docked up or not.  If they don't want to use it, they don't have to, but they'll be in for a surprise if they won't have an advantage by using the big motherfucking ship they have in their hangar.
---
It was always like this lol, you act like it's a new thing to push a narrative on reddit
---
The dread bomb in L4x was not easily tanked, if they didn't make the mistake with range/drip feeding dreads in and PGL overpowering the target caller I have no doubt supers/titans would have been  lost.   
---
If Fax/dreads could be remotely repaired whilst in Triage/siege then it gives more options for both sides.  Attackers bring in fax to rep the dreads and the defenders can use fax to rep each other.    
---
If fax are balanced to a point where they are not useful against a dread bomb then you will not see fights like L4x.

You act like you've never seen anyone be sarcastic on the internet ever.

Okay so unpopular opinion but James 315 was always right just the method used for enforcement was fatally flawed and given better more wide spread implementation would foster a better environment 
---
The game is trash
---
&gt; SP is just another ISK cost.
---
That wouldn't have happened if they didn't add skill injectors into the game.
---
I hope that made you feel better. I'm not Elron, but since I orchestrated literally this entire thing I'll reply. 
---
Literally the only part of that even vaguely true is discord. Sadly it was mostly accidental, but was pretty funny none the less.

No we didn't put anything in low power. It just says that when you're in a hull timer. We spent a week burning shields and armor on them.

Maddy was left in charge. He owned the citadel, alt corp, etc.

Yes I rolled you out. Welcome to wormhole evictions.

No I didn't show up today. It's my daughter's 16th birthday so I decided to spend the evening with her rather than playing some stupid video game.

---
You have to admit Hedliner, -BAT- was there a long time for PL and helped your alliance through a wild ride of fail. Saying  ... "Is there anything really left of BAT to leave?" ... probably isn't the best strategy for PL while you try to recruit more corps and pilots to fill in the blanks for the 8 corps that just walked out in 4 months. Snark aside, just have Doom shut his yap and the public perception of PL would skyrocket and new recruitment possibilities could unfold. Good luck in the rebuild.
---
Well, you guys finally killed Eve!  It’s dead to me now. 
---
Wait a second.... ***Looks at flair*** hmmm...
---
Make skill loss lose lower levels instead as a way to prevent skill retraining from taking forever (if you choose to not inject).  Make them lose Lvl 4 and down and lock Lvl 5 while Lvl 4 isn't trained.

I was ordered to shitpost here. Least I could do right?

This is obviously bad dinoposting dispite the flair.

I was asking if it works I haven't been to highsec to actually play there or can flipped in years, but if it works I'd love to go find this asshole in a venture with an auto cannon BS waiting in a station nearby and cross those two orcas off.

MTUs will not pull containers or wrecks that are not white or blue. When you drop your MTU, the Apocs will drop jetcans that are yellow to you, and thus the MTU will not pull them. You also cannot tractor beam a yellow wreck or container.

Why?  I don't play currently, but Eve was one of my favorite games in College.
---
Wow.
---
I don't know if there's anyone who hasn't at one point created an alt and get recruited in one of the mass recruiting highsec corps.
---
For anyone who did, it's a known fact these corps are operating on a don't undock under wardec policy.
---
So I don't see how anyone could assume wardecs lead to deaths more than inactivity.
---

This is accurate.  Hedliner was more than fair in his response here.  I'm reachable via Discord on the eve channels as well.

We'll see what BAT Country look like when we land. :)   I wish PL the best, it was a very good two and a half years flying with them.
---
I'm sorry what? They were around for a few years, that's more than some and less than others. I've absolutely no idea what you are referring to other than that though. 
---
As for the changes in member corps last year, all I can say is that corps come and go with the passage of time. That happens in every alliance.
---
BUSA merged into SNIGG and was then removed. The corp was then reclaimed by the founder who decided to move members of Insurrection into it.
---
NESW merged into SNIGG and was then removed. 
---
PL2.0 was an alpha corp used for highsec ganking. It got mothballed and removed.
---
WAFFLES left to go back to lowsec. It's in their DNA and despite giving PL 0.0 life a try for a year they simply decided they preferred their roots. 
---
ISRAD left because penif wanted to try new things after the best part of a decade in PL. 
---
0 2 C was an alt corp consisting of a whopping two (2) characters.
---
NAP0C joined specifically for the alliance tournament. Shockingly they left when it was over. 
---
N0X had afk leadership and merged into SNIGG and NESW. 
---
I hate to burst your bubble but 8 corps didn't walk. Changes were made for a range of different reasons and after that 4 new corps were recruited. 
---
The only thing I was able to get from this is that you don't like Doom. 
---
God bless you Kismeteer.

GOTG is not going to help Horde anytime soon. if NC is under attack, there is a small chance they might show up to help, but not Horde. Which was the reason why i think the Branch deployment was a mistake.
---
Nah. I’m gonna go with skins. More skins.
---
Before this all happened I had like 4-500mil in my wallet. I was trying to figure out just how much in real money my comrade gave me. I'm super bad at math by I think its like over a hundred dollars. xD Well I'm going to log in now and start to spend it on injectors to actually help out. :D None of this isk will not be spent on anything but making my team stronger.
---
 Test alliance pls dock up (lul)
---
That wide-eyed innocence in discovering all at once all the game has to offer probably has something do with it too, at least until you lose your space cherry! XD
---
My favorite part about all this was the local shit talking throughout the week about how NSH has so many blues and uses batphones all the time
---
Deploy them, set them to aggressive, and then just press F. They'll start chasing down any legal (white or blue) wrecks in drone control range. They won't go after yellow wrecks though, unless you directly target them and dispatch the drones on them.
---
&gt;While trying to revive your dead corpse of an alliance 
---
That dead alliance, with 16% of the total membership of the "most battle hardened alliance in EVE" has 50% the number of kills in the month of January, and you've only been able to scrape up 3 times the number of active characters this week. Sounds to me that contrary to ~popular belief~ we aren't the ones who are struggling.
---
Maybe you should work on your alliance activity levels instead of sperging on Reddit about Pandemic Legion.

It's simple. Looking from the outside over the last few years and seeing obvious mistakes PL leadership made, rebuilds aren't a bad thing. In fact, a redirection in focus often brings excitement back to mundane Eve space politics and gameplay. Even in the corporate world of Wall Street, remarketing campaigns are the norm after a few years and are largely successful when done right. Considering PLs entire alliance persona, the makeover would include an attitude change, fresh blood, good PR, better Reddit posters, less smug. You can hire me for isk. Consider it consulting. Also, I don't dislike Doom, I just think he's generally misunderstood and appears to have a hard time communicating his true feelings. Anyway, good luck.

"Hoping for a rogue director" isn't much of a strategy, whatever the shittani tells you, even if it worked for him.

How does one manage to kill a fucking curse in the pvp abyssals arena? I don't want to welp another 2bil to the curse. I've tried everything. Focusing on the curse. Focusing drones. Full neut gila with full talisman set. Rlml gila. Augmented drones. Full abyssal gila. Would really appreciate an suggestions for gilas since I did a focus train for them. Tommorow is gonna be the last time and I'm gonna go all out. Can someone help me with piloting tips against a curse?
---
Yes we definitely had a small fleet Im sorry you guys couldn't muster up anything to come shoot a final timer or even save your own. Was a really shit job trying to evict someone when you cant even manage to put 1 man on the field. We had more fun neuting out own guys because all of your trash talk came up empty when push came to shove. So have fun dying to our "small fleet" (like 10 dudes btw) again next week.

&gt; Is Eve worth getting into?
---
Seriously you coming to game's fanclub and asking this? What are you expecting to hear? "No, keep away"?
---
&gt; Also any tips for a noob?
---
1. Most important in my opinnion. This is sandbox game with a lot of activities. Search for the things you like. If you do something and you're not sure if you enjoying it - stop doing it and switch to something different. Otherwise you would just bore yourself out. Also feel free to try unpopular activities and feel free to avoid popular ones if you don't like them.
---
2. Keep in mind that you don't owe anything to anyone. Like, if you joined a corporation and you feel like you're not having a good time - feel free to leave corp and look for something else. If someone tells you that you owe something - tell him to go fuck himself.
---
3. Keep in mind that people are generally stupid. Don't do something just because "everyone" do this. Do something ONLY if you like to do it.
---
4. Feel free to ask a more experienced players about anything. It's a part of EVE culture to teach and help newbies. Don't be shy.
---
OMG I had no idea! Why not??

he was scouting supers to frag from the womb. Some say the twinkle in his father's eye was the titan exploding.

Anything from here if I’m honest. I’ve read and enjoyed them all. 
---
No.
---
Sigh I would love to do that for unfortunately this account only has 5 mil sp and is focus trained into abyssal gilas. Maybe later I'll try with the Ishtar
---
Cut the guy some slack. He was under a bit of stress at the time. We all make mistakes. 
---
Yeah, they are monthly. I'm game.
---
No
---
wow
---
Its just a slow game and it can be boring a lot of times which means it is definitely not for everyone. Most of the people I try to get into EVE get bored pretty fast. The few that enjoyed it though end up playing it forever.
---
LIES!  There are NO hello kitty skins or wallpapers!
---
By the numbers, this is why noone likes you. Here, or in real life.
---
Pretty sure they are too busy having their umpteenth gay sex party.  :/
---
I have lived in both curse and syndicate and ran missions fairly unobstructed in both. Curse was more lucrative than syndicate, mainly due to angels/ serpentis vs whatever is in syndicate. 
---
Best part is that there are unlimited missions for alliances but not so much anoms.
---
Specialists on the matter say that if the weather probe had been made by Subaru this never would have happened.
---
MY MAN
---
I just started about 2 weeks ago in the free to play and love it. My #1 piece of advice is u I join a new player friendly Corp as soon as hit finish the tutorials (I joined Pandemic Horde and it's great). They'll throw free ships at you, teach you how to survive and fight, and it's a great way to get into the action right out of the gate 
---
I switched to autopiloting in null. More rewarding. 
---
Because one of them was bored and dropped a carrier on you? Because they let adversity in? Because a single carrier is too much for you?
---
Which is it? 
---
1) Remove security missions, remove the existing FW NPC corporations from the game, and change the existing LP stores to a limited set of items, so that existing hordes of LP can be cashed out over time.
---
2) Having removed security missions, add new FW NPC corporations with a new LP store, using LP that can only be obtained from activity toward capturing or defending systems
---
there, now you're well on your way to unfucking this travesty
---
It wasn't me or my friends. Just looking through the kill board. It's not that he was bored and did a heterosexually impaired move, it's that snuffed has a perpetual record of doing this shit then crying why do you run off gate or why won't you engage us when they come by later. Fuck them and fuck that. I'm not going to bother engaging with someone in sub caps if every single time I do they drop carriers, supers, or what ever bull shit they feel like imposing on us in low sec. It's autistic tyranny because they've succeeded too much and are too big of bitches to get over it and stay in null sec where they belong.
---
Join a new bro corp and take advantage of the handouts and guidance. Don't spend a year+ in high sec bouncing around learning the game mechanics the hard way. 
---
Oh look, snuff dropping caps on everything that moves, nothing new
---
1m3 per isk. :P 
---
They have alreday lost about 4 titans moving solo up to geminate.
---
And if they do a move op as an alliance, it will 100% be scouted.

You can also be just plain better at piloting. Plenty of bittervets with 150m+ SP couldn’t tackle in a ceptor if their lives depended on it (in game).
---
😂😂😂 Love the salt. Keep it coming.
---
Code and wingspan are just picky like that.
---
Have an up upvote sir.
---
Webs will help for sure but there are several different factors in play.  
---
If your Super is allrdy fullspeed, webbing him will take ages to slow him down since his Inertia is huge asf and to decelerate it takes about \~40sec depending on AB / MWD fitted, so he might be drifting out of bubble much like dreadnought are drifting while sieged.  
---
Optimal would be to web him during his acceleration phase or before he starts moving.
---
Thats also the reason why its so hart to catch oversized propmod kiting-fits in general, you need to stay upclose and apply your web consistently for them to slow down - all while being webbed and scrambled by them, since their Inertia propels them forward even if you got them once.
---
  
---
*/OT: Dreads usually are able to drift since their siegemode inflates their Mass and Inertia tenfold turning them into a floating brick in space, they do so to* [*speedtank*](https://i.imgur.com/Bwfs9Yi.png) *anticapital guns (simulated for 200m/s but dreads with 50.000MN MWD can speed up to 500m/s), one of* ***many*** *reasons why XL missiles suck hard.*  
---
*Also this way they try to get other ships chasing them so targets drop their transversal / radial velocity and are easier to hit if they chase after them in a straight line.*
---
wow this guys a HUGE RETARD https://zkillboard.com/character/96383751/

I’m sure they will replace it with a monument.
---
I use F2, I keep my point on F1. I like it to be the first thing I activate
---
lmao so miffed you've posted about it, nice
---
I'm sensing an inside joke on power levels I wasn't aware of.
---
To be faaaaaair, there were some caps that got self destructed because our guys couldn’t get them out.  Also, this got way bigger than I thought it would.  I’m literally missing the eviction of nullspace up north for these antics all week 🤣😭
---
not sure if dumb or ignorant but, zkill has som magic calculating so that one guy smartbombing 1000 shuttles doesn't make a alliance #1 of top alliances, thats different from the player top list in corp/alliance which just lists kills
---
Yeah man. I do genuinely get upset about seeing these things. Call me a homo, I don't mind. I wasn't involved in this though in any capacity. Just was being my own brand of cancer in a system nearby and was checking who someone recently killed because they were flashy.
---
what do you have against homosexuals?

You can’t defend us.  They hate us.  Just hate on us like everyone else for upvotes.  /s

Parrth has to stop neuting my ship so I could put more damage on the citadel.
---
7sins is total ass fuck aids and I enjoyed bombing them as much as I possibly could while we were there. We were smart bombing them as you guys were dropping caps on their systems a couple weeks back. It was pretty fun.
---
i can't honestly remember when it got the mining bonus, but i do know that it had a bonus to shield transfers the whole time that nobody used, which i knew because i thought i was super smart in 2010 when i put a shield transfer on one
---
i actually think it might have always had the mining bonus, and it lost it in the cruiser rebalance in like 2012
---
&gt;The ELITE TIER MINERS were Geddons and Domis
---
the actual elite tier miners were, and still are, haulers - you just slam a single mining laser on there, pick the biggest rock you can find and post up on it, then go to bed and wake up in the morning with 1mil+ in your hold

only works in high sec tho

Okay Satan, that's enough.

Caps built there can’t leave the c2.  Other than that, a lot of it was insurance fraud.  Once the fort went low power, that’s what you have to do.  No remote destruction or even in station destruction.  Oh well.  I got my good stuff out, as did everyone else.  Nbd.
---
Snuck Fuff
---
no u
---
So your point is that a single alliance in a coalition ONLY managed to pull together half the combined super fleet?
---
Btw wts vouches into snuff pm me ingame
---
Tell that to the guy with ten alts who evacced the hole.  He left no fight.  🥺
---
This is the real reason I fly hull-tanked. F1 for pew pew, F2 for zoom zoom. It's simple, so it has to be a good idea.
---
homo
---
(u asked 4 it)
---
On ships that have 'shoot things' as their main purpose, guns go on f1. On stuff like ewar, inties, etc, whatever the purpose of the ship is goes on f1/f2/etc and guns come after that.
---
For example, on my inties I have point on f1, scram on f2, and my token pair of 125mm autocannons don't come in until f3. (Also note I have 1-4 bound to the first 4 slots on the middle row and 5-8 bound to the first 4 slots on the bottom row, which I find much easier than having *everything* on f-keys and alt/ctrl modifiers of f-keys, so on that inty my MWD goes on 1 for quick access - if I were still using just f1-f8 for stuff the MWD would be on f3 and the guns would be on f4.)
---
You're welcome to call me as many names as you like fam. I'm from a cancerous time where foul and vile things are how you greet enemies and friends.
---
Just build your own bot to warp in, steal the ore, and bring it to a citadel. 
---
There's just no evidence that Alphas have had *that* much of an impact, or if they did, the impact is that some people converted their Omega logins to Alpha logins. This goes all the way back to the launch of Ascension: once the four-or-so month training period for the Ascension Alpha accounts ends after the launch of that expansion, login numbers [go right back to where they were](http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/archive/eve-players-2017-ascension-taba.png) before Ascension was launched.
---
Do I know this for **sure**? Of course not. I don't have access to the raw data, just what I can get from the public sources. But if you have another explanation, I'm listening.
---
Now now. You don't want to say they discriminate. They drop caps on everything that doesn't move, too.
---
that looks pretty lol
---
i am loling at it now
---
I need to find a good profile for my Corsair k95 rgb
---
Holy fuck he still plays?
---
sounds like ur from England, those guys are like that
---
So those guys that got dropped on were pretty obviously gate camping. So OP is mad that some gate campers got cyno baited with one carrier.  SMH this has nothing to do with why people don't like snuff. 
---
&gt; In EVE it’s far too easy to multi-box or bot (they’re intrinsically related) as a symptom of being too mechanically simple on the most basic level of foundational mechanics. The game also quite heavily incentivizes the practice of multi-boxing or botting by rather effectively providing a linear or even exponential increase in power that scales with the number of accounts a single person commands.
---
You're dead right about this being a flaw and (when and if EVE's obituary is ever written, whether months, years, or decades from now) deserves to be one of the main elements highlighted about the game, very much a Faustian bargain that CCP made within the game to increase revenue at the expense of engaging gameplay. The statement "you should multibox" is:
---
* ...true right from your first moment of playing EVE, no matter how you play it. If you mine, having a hauler there more than doubles your mining output. If you mission, having a second ship in the mission more than doubles the speed at which you complete it. If you are in industry, having alts more than doubles the rate at which you can manufacture and research.
---
* ...something that CCP has marketed themselves, right from the beginning of the game. I can't count the number of marketing efforts over the years that have been aimed at getting players to getting more and more accounts.
---
* ...something that just hamstrings the game, and yet players wouldn't have it any other way. If CCP ever *did* make mining or missioning more engaging to the point of it being fun, there would be a sizeable component of players that would complain about it bitterly because they wouldn't be able to watch Netflix at the same time. ;-)
---
It's gotten to the point where every alliance I've been in for the last five years now *expects* you to have an alt directly involved -- or two, or three, or more -- even during the biggest or smallest PvP battles.
---

Fun fact: my grandpa helped this dude clean out his newly bought house.  In the basement was a whole lot of weird shit like monkey paws,  eyeballs in jars,  etc.  Well my grandpa got a human skull ashtray out of it
---
a gate camp with 1 t3c, a t1 cruiser tackle and a t1 battle cruiser (This looks like it's all 1 guy multi boxing) And your immediate thought is, I should drop a carrier? Cyno baited? I've yet to have an encounter with snuffed that isn't cyno bait, is it even baiting when that's all you do 80% of the time? that's just cyno roaming at that point right?
---
So you iz saying subcaps should be able to pop caps and supers, but not the other way around, that makes sense indeed. Btw the light fighters nerf feature was actually added with tidi as you cant hit shit in it. Its realy fun sending your fighters to attack fleet thats being booshed all over the grid in 10% tidi, fo realz!
---
I have an idea too, bring back the old AOE DD so all subs in 200km radius will eat shit and die no matter what. How about that?
---
I'm not going to argue about the armchair general part of this, or about what should've would've been, but purely from a gameplay perspective it doesnt make much sense that Dreads - the ships dedicated to killing capitals and structures - cant kill caps. The current fax meta is ass and I think a severe buff to dreads is in place.
---
This
---
Yes, join BRAVE NEWBIES
---
Ya, public opinion has you doin' real well here.

Hmm, take a closer look at those mid slots. I wonder what fun form of content he was pursuing on the Abune gate.
---
so if i die after i kill everyone?
---
You basically described my living room when I finally move to New Orleans.
---
You seem pretty invested, dude.
---
Droping on gate campers well that guy is doing gods work 
---
Sounds about right 
---
[alt-inception](https://i.imgur.com/TyQBgEw.png)
---
So your idea is what? Gate campers are there to get easy low risk kills. If they see you bringing an actual comp to fight theyll dock up, thats why you pretty much have to cynobait them.  
---
Also the reason people dont like snuff is because they are able to 3rd party on lowsec objectives as much as they want because shadow cartel declined in active members, and siege green is not willing to field 20ish titans.  OPs post is just complaining about the general proliferation of capitals in Eve if anything. Or maybe He is just salty that snuff killed him at some point.
---
Is the current pricing schemes for characters just the value of SP that can be extracted? The character has like 50m SP of subcap skills and Im coming back after like 8 years and fancy relearning from the ground up.
---
i wanna roam caldari high sec to to hunt squids and not have to worry about npc po po

I'm at work, I'm bored and there is nothing to do but sit here and poke people for fun.  My investment ends when my shift does, till then you are the entertainment
---
this is a good look
---
Your first point is fair but we also see the cyno bait and we know the difference from a bait and cyno bait. We've engaged bait a hundred times knowing full well we might get fucked if we can't kill the target fast enough. We do not engage with cyno bait though because that's not a fight it's equally just a disperse as well. If people form response fleets we opt to fight them if possible, or we'll reship and give it a real go with t1 battle ships and stuff. But fuck doing shit with caps, it just gives snuffed another excuse to keep sending cyno shit down our way. 
---
Hey man, I got so little sleep as an art major. We dont have a clearly defined stopping point with our work. Theres always something to improve on.
---
It's funny because I am taking a class on fisheries management and I see a lot of overlap between current overfishing and ways that eve players are over hunting care bears in low and null. Overall if gankers stoped hunting as much as they do now the volume of potential targets would rise and the kills that they could go for would likely be of higher value 
---
Playing almost everyday and beeing sure about how most mods work, when i see such a fit, i directly question myself, if i missed something and passive shield regen is maybe really affected by that shield boost amp and then i just check the comments in the threat and i am like "nah all good ..."  :D
---
:( i am a filthy F1 gun user ...
---
First row  F1 guns, F2 scram/point, F3 propmod, F4 &amp; F5 web/neuts
---
2nd row: F1 Cap inject, then pretty much nothing or passive mods.
---
3rd row: F1 active shield mods/reactive armor hardener and F3/F4 are active rep mods, like armor rep, anci armor rep or single or dual anci shield reps.
---
Except for logi, then it can differ, except that F3 is always propmod, and remote shield, remote cap can sometimes slightly differ.
---
Unless you use the same password on each site you don't need to change them. Only on compromised accounts. 
---
But how do you shoot your other guns?
---
Bat was around many years before PL and will be around for many years more. EVE being in a super shitty state has been detrimental to Bat playing EVE however the people who are Bat are still playing other games.
---
Mining apocs, wrong decade?

Low bar, high ceiling.

You think downvotes define me? I enjoy this game more than most, likely including you. The real issue is why someone like you can't deal with the an opinion that doesn't side with yours. Just because something can be done, doesn't mean it can't be lame and pathetic. What the fuck is your problem mate? Did your mommy not put out your clothes for you to dress right today? You're a complete asshole. Oh wait, am I allowed to have that opinion? Fucknard!
---
It is one of the things that has always bothered me, the inability to carry your money in actual coins/bills.
---
Also: PLEX was introduced as an item on the market such that you could put it into the hold *even though you never had to!* EVE is not there to protect the foolish from their foolishness. EVE is there to teach them the hard lesson as many times as they need to learn it for the instruction to sink in.

It’s no My Friendly Pony Land, you should not want it to be.

Lol 1 hour a fleet. You guys mustve never had 150 citadels anchor simultaneously in your space?
---
Interesting, that's something I didn't know.
---
Still, I was more pointing out that once a freighter has *been* bumped, attempting to web it isn't going to help. On the other hand, lady luck is a fickle mistress - I don't like rolling the dice when I don't have to.
---
I've had the most amazing luck with some dst contracts - grab something out of low, get shot at by pirates all over the place but get it out into high anyway, get it all the way to Jita 4-4, be about to dock and... *freeze.*

Somehow lady luck has smiled on me every time, and I've gotten away with that.

Are you actually this delusional or just pretending?
---
If you actually want to know. Gallente have more drones out at once, Amarr have more reserves of drones. Thus the Sisters (Gal/Amarr hybrids) sit in the middle.
---
Nice try comrade bot programmer.  
---
It was flawed. 
---
Simple Farmers ? Lol
---
:)
---
From what I have experienced there is a bug with drones as you have described.
---
In my case I have the same issue with Gecko's engaging but not shooting or microwarping at/to their targets.
---
The solution that I've taken to using is returning drones to bay and launching again.

15 days in eve are like stepping out of a plane in a new country and you got 1hr to decide if you want to stay... 15days are nothing, especially when most what you do is mining and missions, cause that's what you know from other games. XD

YUPPPPP. (And apologies for the long response to follow:)
---
It’s just how the game was designed from the start and pretty much all players still remaining have to adapt to it, suffer because of it, or leave. 
---
I personally really dislike multi-boxing, even in WoW where it’s much less prevalent due to it being less powerful and easy (except in pure economic cases but EVE leans HEAVILY on the economic simulation aspect, probably more than any even moderately popular game ever released.) 
---
Multi-boxing just isn’t fun or good for a game when it turns from anything more than a meta-gaming novelty into a chore or requirement to keep up. 
---
My experience is pretty modest too all things considered, when I was playing EVE I started out with one account, quite quickly realized that two would be better and eventually made a more situationally subbed third for awhile. To maintain these all as subscriptions or later Omega accounts, I would either have to play quite a lot or sink real money in. At some times it was doable to some extent, but it wasn’t particularly enjoyable or fun since I didn’t really want to worry about that much. Don’t even get me started on Alpha accounts which were starting to get out of hand before I eventually lost interest. Had at least 3-4 of those cooking skills up in addition to the other 2-3 paid for accounts/skill queues (because I did take advantage of MCT deals sometimes.)

Another more specific point is that the most lucrative and actively interesting PvE activities (which are required if you want to do anything else in the game at an appropriate scale without burning money on PLEX or having a space sugar daddy of sorts) require at least two accounts now for an individual, with 3 being a kind of critical mass, and more tending to be gravy beyond that if you wanted to put in the extra effort. That’s not healthy. And yeah, there’s some things like playing the market whether through station-trading or endeavors that require more effort like arbitrage (I’ve done both to modest success), but to be considered truly successful at those, you have to have a sufficiently large amount of starting capital in the first place which can only be generated through other means of income (whether PLEX or enough PvE grinding). 
---
I’m not sure exactly how much Abyssal Deadspace has affected all of this, but it doesn’t seem like much from what I’ve read and seen. Though its addition was probably a move in the right direction overall regardless of impact, even if a subset of EVE players doesn’t want to admit it. 
---
Anyway, thanks for the eloquent response, it was your blog that originally guided me in some of my earlier days of playing EVE when I first started officially around 2011 or so I think. (Pretty sure I had some trial accounts before that but the game was uh, less than hospitable to any new players then. Which is why I don’t mind development of the NPE, but I don’t know if it will matter much if other things don’t change.)
---
It all just makes me disappointed because EVE does a few things really well that no other surviving MMO does which is why it has persisted in spite of numerous flaws. The negatives mostly outweigh the high points for me at this stage, and the power of multi-boxing and botting to a lesser extent has been a major component of that. I’m not even delving into more subjective grievances or likes. 
---
For now there’s another specific MMO in development that appeals to me more than anything on the market, but only time will tell if it lives up to its ambitions — one major hindering obstacle might be that the budget isn’t large enough to compete with over a decade of continued development on a couple of the most popular MMOs. 
---
Otherwise I’ll just resign myself to dabble in the genre and enjoy the overflowing amount of other game releases, let alone backlog of stuff that I’ve shelved because I primarily spent my free gaming time playing EVE or WoW for over a decade now.

if test did that you'd be in caldari provisions my dude

its lowsec, having the big guns (carriers and dreads) creep into that sector is only gonna kill it even more as no newish player will go near it 
---
Delete this
---
I trust that many linemembers like fighting. I mean, I totally love it too. But for the alliance, it is important to grow some isk caches too.  
---
TEST wrecked 1+ trillion in caps to try out what happens if you put dreadbomb to an extreme against enemy supers. We knew, we would lose this much, and we also knew that there is little to gain except the information, if and how a enourmous dreadbomb can win such engagements. I doubt that Horde is anywhere near the possibility to spend 1 trillion to just "try something out".
---
TEST has this money from their industry. The north is crying for over a year now, that goons and TEST cannot be beaten thanks to the rorq. Some tried to build empires, and you guys now say it doesn't matter if you can't build empires? And roams don't matter?  
---
I love how too many eve players cannot think in the bigger picture XD

---
yes please
---
Memes aside, I feel like there's a really important lesson buried here that some of the larger gank-centric groups in eve really struggle with understanding, and the lesson is that reputation matters.
---
When you drop caps on literally every subcap you detect - when you initiate engagements with the expressed desire to bring a force an order of magnitude stronger than that of your opponent, people remember who you are, and they go out of their way to not fight you.  Ticker tanking is a pretty good meme, but it's probably a lot less funny when your cancer renders the entire region in which you stage uninhabitable. You need not look any further than the current state of Black Rise to understand the lengths to which people will go to avoid this kind of "gameplay".  BR used to be one of the most active, fun, player dense hubs of pvp in the game.  50,000 people used to live here.  Now it's a ghost town
---
I just don't get it.  Clearly groups like snuff enjoy blowing up space ships.  How can you not put it together that absolutely megaturboultra dunking every subcap you encounter might not be the best path forward with regards to future content.  It makes sense for gons to DD anything that comes into delve.  They just want to mine in peace and that's fine... but did you really expect that Black Rise would continue to nurture content if you basically do the same thing there?
---
Can confirm. Drop caps on rocks.
---
Snack fluff

what happend in the end of 2016? some really nice event?
---
Your posts are at lest 42 times more retarded than dooms
---
&gt;It's a bot-spiracy :(
---
Bad bot
---
That might make sense to you, but for the future of Horde and the northern coalition, it is imperative to also transition to an empire. With constant roams and drops in your space, that is limited alot. In the long run, the north will consequently lose parity to the south even more.
---
We will see how fun it is for you, to not be able to build an economic empire in time when Test/Imperium can replace their supers with supercaches in the next greater war. I mean, I remember northern guys whining about how unfair the game is, and Test/Imperium cannot be beaten in a super battle anymore... And still you haven't realized how important it is to change your game...
---
Well anyways, I'm looking forward to see you guys in the next super battle :)
---
I spend a lot of time in Aridia and this is the norm with the ruskis there.
---
It's quiet up there... a little TO quiet. 
---
I believe that is correct - pretty sure they used to live in Pure Blind, but they got out fairly early in that regional conflict from what I remember. 
---
Boring is the best compliment ever it means we are succeeding. Delve is supposed to be boring, secure, and full of industrial opportunities. Delve is not and was never designed to be thunder dome. I know I know grrrr goons but we choose not to shit where we eat. We are way too refined and upscale for that. 
---
Yeah, but you make "heterosexually impaired" out to be a bad thing. How is it? Just because it's not your cup of tea doesn't mean you get to criticise it. I hope you feel bad now!
---
oh yeah, i totally understand, was just having a chuckle
---
No, go away.
---
And by boring i mean boring for a line member,talking as soon to be ex goon
---
Is being physically impaired a negative or a description of fact?
---
Why do you leave your clones randomly laying about? Sounds like poor planing and lack of vision. 
---
A useful addition to the current model would be that it has to be a fueled structure in high sec. Then there would be an even playing field for both noobs and elite pvp'ers. 
---
So, thanks for linking the br btw. But I had a good laugh looking at that BR. That was actually well balanced 1:1 pound for pound, legacy in immensea herp a derped and used the wrong doctrine choice. It happens, and is unsurprising. 
---
Yeah I'm the only person in eve who has ever forgot to leave their clone at home and didn't want to lose it.
---
Trust no one

Most high cost items are still traded at panfam controlled citadels though

Bat was in PL for 3 years. In our first year, our attendance to fleets was exemplary, often being on second to Snigg despite being only a fraction of their size. We had a great time, many bragging rights were earned. The EVE meta changed and PL had to change with that. Whether they succeeded is a different matter however with the meta change, many bat members lost interest in EVE. So over the last two years attendance dropped. We'll leave it at that.

As others have said, base out of NPC null, then slowly expand into a neighbouring region (not delve), start small - one constellation maybe and go from there
---
2000 isk/lp is very much the extreme high end. 
---
Even Guristas pirate LP, (for Gilas, the most expensive Faction Cruiser) only pays about 2k isk/lp
---
Faction Warfare LP will pay out between 600-1000 isk/lp unless you look at low volume niche items. 
---
Otherwise I really like the sheet, and even at the lower end of isk/lp, 100M per hour chaining novice sites in a T5 system sounds pretty good. :)

The payment for memes and propaganda is a great idea.... I'd make a fortune

Nobody has said test cannot be beaten.

Completely off topic, but did you get a renewed love for EVE after moving into your C2 (and making a new corp)? Looks like yall are getting lots of good small gang content
---
i want a shuttle that has 3500m³ cargo so i can move excas in it 
---
I agree in general with your assessment of the original assessment that you’re responding too, though I would argue there are some more subtle nuances involved that you might not see as someone new to EVE. 
---
Also just want to point out that Stellaris and Sins of a Solar Empire at least are strategy games with a fairly large single player focus and multiplayer capability. They do not have the persistent world of an MMO like EVE does, and I think that even the largest Stellaris multiplayer games effectively cap at around 30 players? Some more technical issues aside (especially recently), I would probably highly recommend Stellaris, especially with some of the mod support. Though that kind of strategy game isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea. Sins, Stellaris, and the other games you mention primarily share the spaceship-oriented science fiction thematic. 
---
Except for maybe Star Citizen but uh, maybe only if it releases in a playable state before the technology displayed is common in the real universe, to put it lightly. I’m not convinced given how cult-like the crowdfunding through spaceship preorders has developed, among other things. 
---
I think you can also ask a bit higher price if your character has high standings with some factions/corps, ie good standings for trade hub or high level mission running

---
You sure won't play that many hours after you've started to play eve. You will however spend an awful lot of time talking with people while not really doing much in-game. And it will be the best time of your life. 
---
Just whatever you do join a big group, newbie help is well organised in groups like karmafleet, brand newbros and brave newbies. Then you can basically fly for free (when you start out you fly useful but cheap ships, so cheap big alliances just give them to you for free for every fleet you want to partake in). Then remember to install their voice comms of choice and jabber (or if they use discord), that way you can receive fleet pings and chat with people (they send out pings when they form a fleet to go out and do pvp). No one uses the in-game messages (people have many alts so it becomes a mess). 
---
No need to even subscribe and just play for free for a few months, one more body in fleet is more useful than no body, so don't worry about your shit skills for flying ships (and don't worry about your ability to fly well, you'll learn slowly but surely). And don't worry about taking part in too many fleets, one or two a week is quite high activity for many because the game is pretty exhilarating. 
---

21*4=84 days , thats JUST under 3 months wich is a .... 38.85$ sub?

only because you dont care does not mean its free 
---
Sometimes you have more than one guns group...
---
They technically do, but as with any other NPC, you cannot cap them out. However, you can use them as flying energy banks for your own capacitor by using nosferarus ^^
---
Can be quite useful when you get the Neutralizer spawn of death.
---
I've never said they had any chance to succeed. That doesn't change the fact that that was the plan.
---
A "deal" involves both sides getting something. What exactly CCP got?
---
How would you call repeated, unprovoked name-calling than bullying.
---
Who said that my campaign is "not valid". You (Goon) and Falcon. If people would support me, that makes it valid. If they don't, then who cares if I run?
---
Yes, my goal was exactly to make the CSM 100% Goon, to remove the fig-leaf. Non-Goon CSMs serve no other purpose than giving fake credibility. They are sidelined and ignored, just read any ex-CSM statements.
---
"Obama" is a shorthand for "US establishment involved in global intervention". It predates and survives the Obama presidency. Obama, the man was however in complete agreement with them and during his tenure these activities were on steroids, ergo it's fair to name it after him, the same way as the McCarty era is named after senator McCarty.
---
Yeah 
---
Because these toys are totally new here in ls
---
i mean who cares for a few months in eve it is such a slow game when it comes to politics and actual survival of an alliance
---
Its not actually heads we are collecting. It is dead  bodies frozen at the ultimate temperature for transport. As my study progressed further towards multiple personality disorder I came to the conclusion that most eve players has been collecting , illegally transport them and marketing and other usages I rather not mention. During interviews the personality actually changes alot. Mostly  due excitement of an engagement of combat or that the name of the corpse is famous. The most thing I find is the fact some capsule leers set amazing goals with a calm face. Like I am going to fill multiple station warehouse with corpses and make a smiley in Jita.
---
My conclusion. Eve players (are mental) good and awesome. All personality are. Irs how the game should be played. 
---
Welp, you apparently lost quite a big deal of money to Abyssal space. I’d say : keep away from the Proving Grounds for quite some times and wait for your skills to go up.
---
You're correct from start to finish here, particularly about abyssal deadspace: it's an interesting notion and I wish we could have seen what Seagull's *real* vision of it would have been.
---
I will add one thing, though. You brought up NPE. Have you tried the NPE lately? If you haven't, I encourage you to do so. It's in the worst state today that it's been since I started playing. I hope it's a work in progress because it's really, really bad.

---
I have doomsday on f1
---
christ that would make LS an absolute killzone for anything bigger than a frigate and HS would see a 10x in freighter losses at the very minimum 
---
Would that entail some Eve players are just fries?
---
The thing is, the game is getting older --&gt; the average player has more SPs --&gt; players are getting richer. This development was greatly accelerated by injectors, but would have happened anyways.
---
In other games such a development is usually countered by power creep - they introduce new, stronger, more expensive stuff, higher levels/tiers, ... In Eve, we don't have no powercreep, cheap shit up to cruiser size is still incredibly useful, actually the usefulness drops off sharply above battlecruisers.
---
I think we could use /some/ powercreep, too. I would propose two new additions:
---
1. To create a division between strategic force and and force to defend the krabs against small raids, they could introduce a new class of strategic Titans. Cost 2-3x normal Titan. Armed with new weapon class very effective against supercaps, but application already drops considerably against normal caps. Selling point: Only 50-70% of the damage caused of these weapons would count towards the damage cap, so they can grind down structures much faster and thus would be produced despite they are useless for daily home defense.
---
2. Create a new T1 battleship subclass, a bit similiar to the attack battlecruisers: Can field capital weapons, can field a new kind of fighter shredding point defense weapon, but is weak against subcaps. The idea is, that it would be useful to have some of them in your fleet against (super) carrier drops, and if you now have to deal with the disadvantages of battleships in fleet anyways, you can also replace the other Feroces/Canes by battleships --&gt; bigger, more expsensive fleets are used.
---
The Ascension expansion. It's the one that created Alpha accounts, wherein players could play for free with a limited skill set for months. Prior to Ascension, an EVE trial period lasted 14 or 21 days (depending on the type of trial you received).
---
Thousands of people signed up to "play EVE for free", but if the new F2P players were truly new EVE players, not nearly enough was done to market the game to them and the spike quickly died. If the new F2P accounts were owned by existing players, then the spike lasted long enough to get them trained (the duration of the spike is the length of time it would take to train up the F2P skills).
---
Does this mean that XL guns are as bad as applying their damage to drifting dreadnoughts as XL missiles ?
---
Skills as in ingame skills or piloting skills? I've tried many fits on sisi but there are seldom ppl there to practice against.
---

What about those "Elite slaves" you use to clean your external hull during a battle?!

well im not saying they are new, but usually they are a solo affiar in LS

now imagine cap fleets in LS having a go at another or a super in every plex

You are able to open up the sheet as a copy in Google and change the amounts. Charts &amp; other values will change with it to the for you appropriate amounts :).
---
Also, 2000 ISK is ment to show what is possibile with Factional Warfare per hour, and I think it does it pretty well. Though I am very much aware it is the upper end. I appreciate your Feedback (I might change the value on the Public sheet to something lower in the future)  
---
Fly safe :) 
---
The people that commented before me are right : you can’t he guides made for highsec PI, as they will work as well in nullsec.
---
Even better : you’ll get none of the drawbacks from Highsec planets. This mean higher P0 ressources, factory planets with a better overall efficiency, and since the POCOs will most likely be controlled by your corporation or alliance, the tax rates will be way lower than highsec POCOs, since you’ll most likely have blue standings with all planetary orbital structures in your space.
---
Make sure you pin the account. Also, verify shared cache from the launcher.
---
I'm long enough in low sec to tell you that this is just now true, groups like snuff or shadow have more than a solo cap for years 
---
I like this post
---
No. Skill loss should be still on t3 ships. Its a swiss knife that can change on the fly. I definitely vote for NO change. 
---
Why ::
---
Simple . The reskilling after loss makes it more interesting and takes no time. The abilities what extra is than any other ship need a price.
---
Butterfly effect needs to exist. 
---
In effect they should put it on every t3 ship.  Including the destroyers. Definitely.
---

Test pinged for an AUTZ op and they were going to drop a fort to bait out Horde supers after we dropped them on piggles a few days ago killing his rorq (was trying to drop a fort). Panfam leadership knew/guessed it was a trap and set their own trap by having all the supers alarm clock for a log off trap. Panfam took the bait with some supers, Test dropped the dread bomb, then the rest of the supers logged in and jumped in.
---
This is how I first got recruited to a WH Corp, admittedly I think I did it way too soon in my eve career (after just a few weeks) as there wasn’t much I could do in the WH... left a few months later to try other things but still on friendly terms with them :)
---
Just like you got baited in a HAW Rev?
---
Shouldn't have clicked, 'cause now I just HAVE to procure these Marmeladeja jellies.

But it is not only characteristic for snuff. It is almost guaranteed that if you piss off the local meanos they will undock their caps to ease their embarassment and stomp you.

---
Seems like you're the insecure kid with daddy issues mate
---
pretty much, the game is now made up of grumpy veterans and bots that supply those grumpy veterans with reasons to be grumpy 24/7
---
Well, not with Test, not yet at least. But at least for the Imperium. And Legacy is about to have more much more titans than panfam too, so it's just a matter of time...
---
About the money of Horde: Yes, Horde should have alot of isk somewhere in a cache. However, a cache is only useful if you have ships in the first place (titans have to be grinded before you can lose them). Second, Horde has no real SRP, so in a longer war, there has to be a level of srp introduced, which eats the limited income of Horde extremely fast, or ppl just ship down, which will cause a lost war (might still be isk positive, but losing all the time is shit, Test was in that period once too)
---
About the "not fight people in our space" I have no idea how you get this... I mean content denial is something ppl do, IF they are endangered, really. Horde is not in any real sort of danger. Noone tried to evict them long term, so there is ZERO reason to safe your energy for the real fights...
---
My corp's CEO pays billions for his own frozen corpse. The problem is I don't believe he ever undocks and I believe its been months since I've even seen him on comms. We may see Bigfoot be elected leader of an IRL colony on Mars before it's even possible for me to get that frozen corpse!
---
I think it can pick up from the same fleet?

This article gave me a good chuckle.

I’d say both, you’ll need them to get the best out of your ships. 
---
It is a hypothetical to reinforce that people get different things out of the game, I do not NEED to adapt if I do not enjoy the new gameplay, I just quit.  
---
That specific point sticks out to me because it helped kill one of my old pvp alliances, they settled down, relaxed pvp standards and let people's carebear friends in and all of a sudden I get bitched at for fighting wormholers. Said people were nowhere to be seen to defend our shit, they simply left when they could not rat.  
---
Now I understand that the game became something they did not like, but they did not adapt either.
---
If you are pretending to be stupid and someone falls for it, does that say more about you or them?

Huh, I don’t think I’ve checked out the latest iteration of NPE so that might be interesting to look at. Though the EVE NPE has always been notoriously trash for one reason or another especially with as high a learning curve as EVE has always had, even more so than other MMOs such as WoW that I’m most familiar with (with the current situation being that the leveling process hardly serves as an adequate tutorial for the meat of the better endgame content and being so endgame focused in the first place since basically forever.) When I started EVE the NPE was essentially a “here you go!” and it plopped you in the game with nothing but your noob ship (might not have even been in space at the time, but docked in a station!) So you had some bad basic tutorials about the UI mainly and the set you free to try career agent missions which aren’t exactly great either. After that you either get helped by veteran players or probably fall into the trap of mission running in high-sec, THE HORROR (this was me for some time by the way.) There’s some more detail I could expound upon, but you should get the gist. 
---
At best in WoW they bandaid the situation by providing level boosts to the cap of the previous expansion so you can jump right in to newer content if you’ve been away, but this is also compounded by how overly generous the gear and other post-leveling/endgame-oriented system catchup mechanisms have become. As of late in the current expansion, this specific issue has become so bad that you could be awarded the same level of gear for what amounts to mindless AFK content that more or less plays itself with no real failure condition as Mythic 20-player raiding or Elite PvP (whether in the form of 3v3 arenas or 10v10 battlegrounds, although 3v3 arena is the much more predominant format for competitive PvP for various reasons). Mythic Raiding (or equivalent as they’ve changed it slightly over time) and Elite PvP matches have historically been the most challenging and rewarding activities, as they should be, so it’s a farce when basically any bum who pays a sub fee can basically do nothing and get the same loot. 
---
There’s a host of other problems with WoW, but thankfully the developers seem like they might fix a good portion of them with their next major content patch. The only issue is that it might be too little, too late for a lot of people, since that’s around 3-5 months away at best when the issue has been more noticeable since about week 3 of the current expansion and hasn’t been fixed yet. Not to mention the latest content patch’s tentpole content (new PvE raid/season + new PvP season) only releases this coming Tuesday when the patch itself will have been out for about 6 weeks prior (though this is somewhat understandable time-gating due to the holiday season). Don’t even get me started on the host of other issues that were present in beta and weren’t fixed, even if they were promised to be, along with a major back-of-the-box bullet point that hasn’t yet been delivered upon (maybe around 5-6 more weeks minimum for that) and other PR blunders across the company and you’ve got a whole lot of people pretty damn pissed, if not just apathetic or ignorant to the problems. 
---
Both WoW and EVE being in more rapid decline as of late has me more interested in checking out some other games, For the MMO space, Final Fantasy 14 seems like something that might be worthwhile sinking some time into, but there’s nothing really suitable that’s more akin to EVE. Again, I’ll have to see what the current NPE in EVE is like to see if it’s as bad as you say it is, hah. Though I think that new activity tracker thing introduced in the last patch or two might be another small step in the right direction.

Cheers!

Shhh

heh, i was merely pretending to be retarded, and you fell for it

gotcha, bucko

I don't think you can make it with that low SP and only a Gila. If you have isk to throw, inject into more skills. Also there are some situation you just cannot beat sometimes, don't throw yourself against a wall over it.

What's also simple is taking 60 seconds to look at dotlan - that will illustrate much if what I said about each of the eight corps that you mistakenly assumed "walked out" - which is something both you and the author of this article could have done prior to trying to present your own views here as facts.
---
As for our mistakes, I'm not entirely sure you should make such uninformed statements on our decisions over the last couple of years given your own alliance's performance over the last three weeks and that you've never run anything other than your mouth.

only takes one skill injector to get into a apocalypse with t2 miners and t2 mining upgrades pulls in more than a retriever/skiff iirc

I am brand new, I would like to get into a big corporation, what’s the best way to do it?
---
&gt; The north is crying for over a year now, that goons and TEST cannot be beaten thanks to the rorq and co. 
---
To be exact: The North is crying that TEST+Goons can't be beaten; not that TEST couldn't be beaten alone.  (North can)

Who has my human heads?
---
I admit that. Snuff doesn't. If that's there policy that's fine. People ping the gates and avoid my smart bombs all the time. I'm not the one whining about not getting content.
---
Look for Pandemic Horde, TEST alliance, Goonswarm or Brave Newbies alliance in game description and follow the instructions to join one of their crop (almost all of them have at least one large open corporation)
---
Do you have checklist with checklists you need to check?    
---
You are not going to win a neut war with a Gila vs.  a properly fit curse no matter how hard you try.
---
If it's not too hard of an Abyssal, you could go with a full passive Gila and thus mitigate the Curse's effects of capping you out, then it becomes a drone war and your drones are tankier, you're tankier, and you do more dps. If you can confine it to a tank-dps war you can possibly win by breaking them harder. Their hole will probably be thermal so use Hammerheads on the main ship if they can keep up.
---
Another possible strategy is to try to outrange the curse neut; however it gets a bonus for this and can be very long range. For T2 you'll have 40ish km to keep away, faction 50ish, deadspace 55, and if they're gimmick heavy fit (unlikely) then you can't escape in the Abyss and should give up. The range might actually be a bit longer too, depending on abyssal rolls involved. This strategy is also very difficult because of the arena walls and curse's relative speed.
---
Another possible avenue is using rlml and your drones to defang theirs fast enough that the curse can't pressure your tank. It's unlikely their ship has actual dps, so if they're bad at dronevdrone (which you have a huge advantage to) perhaps you could cut their dps enough that you can win without being capped. This is incredibly slow though and will be timer pressure.
---
All of these strategies have a very slim chance of working and honestly you should probably just give up and work on not blinging your ships too hard if you must take a Gila into pocket. That's one of the worst matchups for any active tanked ships ever.
---
I kinda skimmed through what some have said &amp; here's what I'll add from my usual advice to new players:
---
It's an overwhelming game. You're gonna be overwhelmed at first. Try to figure out what aspects of the game interest you most (the intro tutorials give you a taste of the game's main elements) &amp; then look for corps that do it ASAP. It's a game that's made great by the players &amp; plenty of corps are full of people who will be happy to help mentor you
---
If you're interested in PVP, and you should be, factional warfare is a really great way to learn to fight both solo &amp; in fleets while also making great isk, especially for a new player. Even if you aren't willing to join a side in factional warfare, the warzones are still good places to have fun in cheaper/smaller ships
---
What can you think of that rhymes with tryhard?
---
Gotya, awesome. Thanks.
---
Yeah but unless you never use the titan or ths character and don't have anything else useful on that account you were going to have it subbed anyone to _play eve_. I really fo get the argument you're making, I just think that's a really sad way to play the game if you're beancounting SP per dollar spent as opposed subbing to play a game you enjoy.
---
Also implying anyone who's going to immediately replace a titan within days of losing it isn't subbing with plex.
---
Every time I fall for it 
---
&gt; Skill injectors have diminished what it means to have put years of time in.
---
Good.
---
The only bad thing to this is that it’s done through wallet, so it’s not available to all newbies.
---
This game needs less skills, not more. New players should be able to board something dangerous and fun to kill and kill with without spending months or bucks.
---
Nah he's right, I forgot. It's highsec so an MTU alone isn't good enough. Good luck getting in the bot fleet :P
---
The blob is real !
---
That's right, I forgot.
---
Then, launch an MTU and go can flipping on an alt :D
---
Can flipping is alive again bois
---
According to tapi leadership, that's a skill urself fort hiding behind the FXR banner and had to be killed.
---
noobs these days start with injected Titan, feq rorqs and "210$ plex investment" 
---
Or tho bot figured no ore for x mins is a dead belt?
---
Think in percentages, not numbers here.
---
Also, there are rats that have non-standard resist profile, at which point you might need to do unbonused damage.

well, you could. no reason not to have t4/5/6 cruisers that take as many SP as supercaps and make them scale with alts.
---
Grrr Snuff ?
---
Snuff are cucks
---
Agreed. And it's really, really sad. I truly think if CCP upper management were more competent eve would prosper and make them more money. Basic features that other MMOs have like a dedicated balance team that balances gameplay (ships, module stats for starters) REGULARLY... Hell, the CHAT, a very basic thing hasn't worked properly for months! 
---
Im a full time physics student with grades averaging at 80%. Im also new (since october). In fact, making money while studying works pretty well for me. Fairly afk, just check local. I dont get bored and crave to play 5 different accounts at the same time.
---
I say go for it!
---
You can also find them in data sites, it's decent isk or people wouldn't have blinged out ships worth 3bil+ running them. Do some research and gl
---
no please
---
engrish

You start OP
---
fuck snuff tbh buncha weebs
---
Snuffed doesn't drop caps on rocks, Goons do.

Just fyi, no one in snuff ever said lowsec is dead.

---
I don't think you know what multi boxing means
---
I do yes. 
---
Obligatory link killmail please 
---
why does ccp not just remove the ability to fit mining laser on non-mining ships. (or at least for alpha characters)
---
You pretty much already can. 
---
Save a fit with the items in cargo. Load the fitting.
---
Im sick of snuff ruining lowsec. I try to gate my dread looking for solo pvp \~ \~ \~content\~ \~ \~ and they just tackle me on gate and warp in titan to do the doomsday on me.
---
Its ridiculous. When does CCp fix this ?please

Today I have seen enough of /r/eve.   It’s 5:14 am.

I don't really feel like shooting structures idgaf about.

No, just no.  
---
Why do people want everything easy and convenient in the extreme?  
---
Does your mom decrust your white bread cucumber sandwiches for you?
---
You know what they say: If you can't beat em, join em. So kind of makes sense they'd start imitating Goons.
---
BR died cause FW was killed with citadel mechanics and bots.  Don’t give snuff all the credit.  
---
Grr snuf hat snuf
---
Erm, I'd like to refute the second point. I believe goons are most autistic. :p
---
lol
---
Realistically they are already very limited, ventures with t2 laser and that's it.
---
Problem is people braking the accounts logged limit for alphas.
---
Also what you think would happen if you cant mine as an alpha? People would think this game is all about running missions when they start, that would suck even more.
---
Lol good luck
---
If only you put his much effort into saving your Jita market. If you had this would've been much more significant :) 
---
That's definitely not normal. Even when they deploy updates it's usually a far smaller download than that.
---
I'd reinstall completely, and if that fails contact customer support for help. 
---
Tl;Dr burgerman
---
No grudge against PL but i see it as one character multi-boxing.
---
dose that mean there is a lot of activity ??!!
---
I wish PL grow better than before cause i want more
---
powerful entity in Eve.
---
An actually good StainGuy post.
---
I think the best way to do this would be:
---
* Letting the fitting simulator store and display data for the contents of various bays (hard but possible) using an extended format
---
* having right click &gt; set ship to fit &gt; ...
---
That would let you quick-refit modules too as well, and your saved fits would be like stored ship states.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Lmao. This is so wrong and such a Bad mentality. 
---
FXR are a neutral third party in that region of space, they are fantastic for some subcap gud fites and pretty much always undock, they're pretty active notong after DT, which is probably why they've wedged themselves in a heavy RU/CHTZ region
---
Is it retarded to try to kill a POCO with a solo BS with said over 1K dps ? Will it take forever ?
---
hat snuff 
---
Multi-boxing isn't illegal in EVE, so not cheating. It's only illegal if you start doing stuff like input broadcasting or automating things (botting).
---
Yeah, Eve needs more menial, frustrating, repeated tasks. There's definitely not enough of them right now.
---
Good Idea, still shut Up StainRetard
---
if it was moon goo, it died when it undocked
---
Isn't that Spectre Fleets?
---
don't forget about the mechanic changes that promotes multiboxing. i grew from 2 accounts to 10 in a matter of 2-3 years because of SP/PI farms, VNI farming and rorq
---
Why is full nos a bad idea?
---
It's only menial or repeated if you play in that fashion. For most players limited cargo space is a constraint that adds complexity, realism, and the need for planning and optimisation. Eve needs more stuff like this, not less. If you just want to fly around and mash a fire button, maybe look into some mobile or console offerings.
---
jesus christ you are so retarded
---
yeah they released that expansion without any plans to retain those new players... it's a real shame
---
F2
---
It seemed to me that PGL just wanted to get rid of his damn cache and go home to Eso to escape the embarrasment of getting completely shut down in their deployment
---
Why is it? There are thousands of people looking for this kind of advantage, an unexploited edge to get ahead that no one else used, every day.
---
I think you should read the suggestion again as what you said makes no fucking sense in this context.
---
Look at this heavily washed telling of events.
---
You left out the part where the lowsec entities had to be paid to band together with dirty/laundered casino
---
Isk that got the bankrollers banned from the game. When the money dried up, so did the band.
---
The viceroy program was an on paper theory troll meant to enrage people. It definitely worked. GSF leadership at the time didn’t do squat to actually execute it.
---
Until you can come up with a BANKROLL to motivate all these hostile entities to stay blue, Jack and Shit will be happening to Snuff’s dominance. Nothing else is going to motivate the people of lowsec enough to RISE UP.
---
If shadow cartel had any teeth it would be the placid wars all over again. Alas wowbagger retired and the goober that is thearrowofappolo is in charge of the most risk averse lowsec group.

Sure it's been mentioned but make sure you include Dictor and ceptor skills if you haven't already trained, also super handy to have players willing to help out and learn how to provide this integral tackle support 
---
Complaining about downvotes is as equally lame as downvoting because you dont like the content tho.
---
You are being facetious, but people actually believe this, and they made more headway than PL did in provi.

yikes at this

Oh shit he did joon TRI, i didnt realise. I'd feel even more foolish but the statement still stands for TRI, BAZINGA!
---
Is there any other way to make skills go faster other than paying real money 
---
&gt; While trying to revive your dead corpse of an alliance, now clinging to Horde/NC for life support, it's generally not a great idea to shit talk the former corps that you and PL leadership dragged through the mud of failure of a three-year streak of bad decisions. You're desperately trying to keep talent and get more corps to rebuild, not chase future corps away with your mouth. Public perception of what's left of the husk of PL is everything now. Just sayin'
---
That one is going into my cringe folder.
---
Man sometimes it's really hard to tell between bot and newbie. I wanna give money to the newbie and tell him to not give up, but what if I give a bot the money for a ship again.

Whered they get the extra pieces??? I have to know.

I was one of the people who wrote parts of it knowing full well it was not executable so PLEASE tell me more.

It was like the last thing I did before space retiring.

I'm going to upvote because frankly, I came back to the game recently to discover two of my imlant laden clones were stuck in structures I can't get into any more. And I'm not sure why people are downvoting you. Perhaps for sarcasm?

I do agree, sell it, buy some cruisers, phantasms are fun 
---
Remove caps from low sec. Makes no sense a capital ship is in another empires space and they are just cool with it.
---
im sure there are people in this game who have "do you wanna RP?" in their char bio and its a link to some channel full of wierd people 
---
This assumption is wrong. Very few ppl actually interact with the game that way. There are thousands of ways to make ISK, just because people are content with farming Anoms for terrible isk/hr doesnt mean that its in any way or form a good way to spend your time
---
Wow dude, chill. lol. Let me try to explain this, one more time:  
---
You are not being told you cant have an opinion. You can. No one is throwing you in jail cause you have an opinion. What you are being ridiculed for on here, is your stunning amount of saltiness, especially considering during the experience in question, you killed one of the two! Thats #opsuccess for most people in a 2v1. You fucking got one.   
---
But then, you came on here crying foul. and not just, "damn I got ganked by a guy and his tackle alt, that sucked," but "Damn I got tackled buy a guy and his alt, fuck him, this shouldnt be a thing, the game should be tailored to complete fairness, everyone that fights me should be made to match me, and fuck you guys in particular that dont think the same thing." Im not trying to say downvotes define you dude, Im trying to get you to see WHY youre getting downvoted into oblivion like you are. You came at this the entriely wrong way. EVE is, by definition, unfair. The single most unfair game you will EVER play. And its not going to change, for you. But instead of giving us a story, and a "That sucks," and then ASKING US HOW YOU CAN AVOID A REPEAT OF THAT SITUATION, you decided it was a great idea to come in here, and whine like you are 5 and just had your favorite toy taken by your mom.   
---
Example: - Did your mommy not put out your clothes for you to dress right today? You're a complete asshole. Oh wait, am I allowed to have that opinion? Fucknard!- 
---
Does this sound like an adult to you? No. It sounds like someone who is unwilling to learn from his experiences, and is just gonna sit and rage against this unfair game. Instead of being a success story, youre deciding to fade into Eve's background via downvotes, and everyone is gonna forget about you, and youre just gonna be another someone who failed to adapt to Eve.  
---
The way I see it, you have three choices:  
---
1.  You can recreate this thread, with much more salt, and instead of whining, you can reach out to the community and learn how to be better, and you can be a success in the game.
---
2. You can continue to wallow in your own salt, not learn from the game, keep playing, and keep dying to things you can avoid, and you just become "that pilot that dies all the time."
---
3. You can just stop playing now, and disappear from Eve, and no one will care for your passing from the game one bit.   
---
Personally, I like success stories, and urge you to put aside your salt and reach out. We need more players. We want the game to grow. But, at the end of the day, it's your choice.  
---
give them advice first. like don't orbit the can dumb dumb. and if they get mad they're a bot, if they thank you then reimburse my sneaky bot.
---
But exactly that offcorp alt info is the only interesting thing.
---
Woah, hold you horses there. Don't pressure CCP into banning their No. 1 paying customers. 
---
Trust me, he won't as long as he gets some fleets to fly with.

---
Logi and tackle are great things to get into if you want to be good assistance to your fleets. They're also more fun than pure damage as well although higher profile so any mistakes are more visible. I think the best fleets I've been in have been as logi though. Saving your buddies is just great fun as far as I'm concerned.

Using implants. A new character already have the skills for a +3 set, which can shave off multiple days from your skill queue. By training up the Cybernetics skills to V (quite long), you will get access to the +5 implants, which are extremely expensive but reduce your training time further more.
---
Also, there is also something called "Neural Remap". You can manually set your cerebral attributes so they match best the primary and secondary brain sectors using in training specific skills, which differs between the different sections (example, Engineering and Social skills doesn’t use the same attributes). However, because of their power, Neural Remaps can only be done ONCE each year, with each character having two "bonus" remap, which doesn’t recharge but can be used to bypass the time limit.
---
It can be hard to change your attributes to best match your skills, so let me advise you the get the free application for smartphone called Neocom II. It allow your to manage multiple things for your EVE account, including skills. If you go in the Skills part and select Attributes, it will show you your current ones, alongside the optimal ones for your current skill queue, plus showing you how much time you’ll save by remapping.
---
Have fun !

I did not too well in university and i sort-of blame it on Guild Wars 2. If i could go back in time and give myself any advice it would be to wait until after Ive graduated to pick up an MMO.

I think Spectre fleets run more on "see something kill something" it would probably be in bad form if people used a public fleet for objectives. 
---
He meant extra high mid slot, I'm sure his dread pilots understood this.
---
I like it.

Have had situations where the station I was running some indy jobs at was always reliable, but then the dude that maintained it got repeat-ganked in the next system and rage-quit. Station runs out of fuel, jobs pause, only option is to lose the progress/materials and cancel. I would have happily popped a few blocks in to finish off my runs, but couldn't since the guy wasn't for logging back on.
---
Other time, some of our neighbours got wardecced with a merc pile-on, and the station manager was getting dropped every time he went to collect PI. Given I was on the game about a month, with our corp about that old too, we couldn't afford to get dragged into it, but I wanted to help out keeping their structures alive. Couldn't just donate fuel without exposing myself to possible spies, so their stuff all went LP and stayed that way until the war ended. 
---
Or you just never find out about it since it doesn't die and end up on the kb
---
Nah, it's CODE so it's about attacking people who can't fight back cos, ya know, CODE suck too much to wet their toes outside highsec.
---
Bots don't get tired or salty.
---
No no, it's about staying in the safe confines of highsec and suicide ganking people because you're too afraid to go to low or nullsec. 
---
So basicly because someone posted something that has 3 PL toons on it you assume PL is dead?

Nah, this is CODE we're talking about :) All they can do is gank people in high sec who can't fight back.

Lmao we are proud to be shitting into your mouth and always will admit it. You can suck my thorax soi boi
---
I haven't been in fw for years but how much of an issue is citadels in fw space?  You still can't dock at stations in systems that the opposing side owns can you? (It really has been a long time for me).
---
If they found it and didn't say, they still found it, it's still being exploited.
---
That is entirely based on perspective. If you don't find them fun then that's fine for you but telling other people that they shouldn't be finding it fun because you don't is a bit dickish. Frankly, he should have fun with it while he is having fun with it. Since he's flying logi and not F1 damage he'll have more fun than most.
---
Ehm, if you save your fit incl inventory, it should be possible to use that fit to fit your ships, thus automatically putting everything in?
---
I keep hearing this but no one ever wants to offer up a better way. And no killing people and taking their stuff isn't a sustainable method either. if literally every single person did this and no one ever created anything the net wealth would eventually disappear.
---
Can u please show me where have tell anyone that he should share my view? If he will find it fun and engaging gameplay,well good for him,i was on several goon fleets and i was impresed by just how boring can it become after a while. 
---
One thing i have to give to goons,the infrastructure in delve is impresive to say the least...
---
Can you not do this with the fitting window? Just clicking apply fitting should put the cargo and drones in
---
If said POCO is not owned by your corporation and have retard taxes toward neutrals, you could simply try to seek around and find a better system with similar planets, and different POCO owners.
---
If you have in highsec, you’ll first have to declare a war against the corporation holding the POCO, or CONCORD will come to whoop your ass clean. Then, those structures have a fucking lot of EHP, so I wouldn’t bring an expensive fitted battleship to kill them, rather a fleet of cheap, expendable Oracles to kill it. If it’s in nullsec, carriers will make a short work of it.
---
Also, you should keep a POCO gantry with all the necessary materials stockpiled as close as possible to the planet, because it won’t be long before someone see a free spot, and set their POCO that could have the same dumb taxes.
---
And it is a nice video btw, but what does it have to do with today, apart from some tard farming karma off it?
---
Sorry I forgot to précise i am in a WH so I cant realy find other planets
---
Selling kill rights. Just fit a hauler and get shot at. Not to easy to bait
---
So can most t3 cruisers. So can most ships. Besides, arguably the more important skill for dreads/faxes is the siege/triage skill, kinda more similar to the subsystem skills [that you actually lose], and what I though you'd actually lose, coz that would be more cancerous than losing 5% dmg.

It's been a rough day, but it happens.
---
I can understand your frustration but honestly if snuffed dropped dead today it would be another alliance doing the same exact thing. So it isnt a snuff problem but rather an eve problem. CCP doesnt want to listen to proposal of fixes. Lowsec has issues with capitals for years. many of you guys think this is just a recent thing but before HiC were released we had motherships on gates solo because they were untouchable with the added bonus of 100% EWAR immunity or having a moros on a npc station with 5x Ogre IIs and this was 10+ years ago.

Most likely they are currently working on their next release of content for us to enjoy, but its not close enough to be finished to show off, or its just the right time yet. Also Fanfest is coming so they are most likely saving big goodies for that.

Of course it is possible though, that same as with Scope News videos they seemed to be too much time &amp; effort to bother with when it comes to their resources.

Here's an idea - remove scripts as a consumable and just bake the functions into the module. Scripts are a relic from when the game didn't work very well, but you should be able to click and choose what you want your module to do without having to faff with bringing scripts. If they're not ever used up, why have them in game?
---
Stops you forgetting to undock with a script, and wasting 3-5m3 on something that is literally a piece of code for a piece of hardware
---
I just can't believe there was any more thought put into it other than it'd be funny, a weak attempt at trolling, and there was no real intention to actually incriminate you.

&gt;What exactly CCP got?

CCP got money for the cost of repairing the monument.
---
&gt;You (Goon)

[citation needed]. It shows how far gone your brainworms are when you tell a critic of Goons and Goon culture that they're a Goon. 
---
&gt;If people would support me, that makes it valid. If they don't, then who cares if I run?
---
Your whole platform was for people to NOT support anyone, including yourself. That's a non-platform, a waste of everyone's time. If you had ran on CSM reform like many other candidates, or maybe even abolishment, then you would've been fine. Run again on an anti-corruption platform, leave the tinfoil at the door, and you'll be ignored like all the other irrelevant candidates.
---
&gt;Non-Goon CSMs serve no other purpose than giving fake credibility. They are sidelined and ignored, just read any ex-CSM statements.

More bullshit from someone who has zero understanding of the CSM.

&gt;"Obama" is a shorthand for "US establishment involved in global intervention".

There is a certain COSMOS agent in Gallente space. It is a level 1 agent so it requires no standings at all.

The mission rewards you with a +5% shield implant.

In theory you could farm the mission with new alts.
---
Oh and one more thing. The mission area is unique to the mission taker but becomes public as soon as you warp to it. You could steal the mission loot from the mission area to stop people from farming it (a rat in the mission also drop some random implant).

Losing a 270 dread cache is significant if you take into account that a year ago, they called for their members to crab for a month in order to raise 500 of them. Test gained significant wealth in the meantime though so they'll definitely get over it. I actually wouldn't be surprised if goons srp-ed them for this.
---
I pray everyday for the extermination of snuff. Amarr akbar.

not exactly true op, I've gone through prism before with there being about 10 snuff rorqs mining.  They were mining at the ice anom, however.

Was that the 5 min vids of a cup employee doing little more than reading the front page of the sub?
---
I lived in both null and wormholes for most of my eve career.  The last month or two I was subbed, I lived in highsec ganking people and baiting mission runners.  What does that make me?  
---
Try and remember this is just a game and the guy flying that catalyst is a neckbeard mouth breather just like you.  He plays differently, but there's no "right" way to play Eve.  When your mining barge explodes, it's only pixels.  
---
it wont work because even by some miracle at the end of the day theyll just batphone goons/init
---
Also, the New Order Outreach Division would like to have a word with your finely tuned narrative: https://zkillboard.com/kill/74646851/
---
Then it’s the easiest. Just put a scout in each static present, roll the unnecessary ones and take out a Dreadnought if you have one. Warp at 10, align to a citadel and shoot stuff

Probably the best you’re gonna get. Looks like legacy didn’t kill anything so true numbers are from local scan only

I'm not here to say you're wrong.  But I am here to question whether you really need to be so upset about it.

Damnit!

I'd join in for some passive income off of some sweet money moons...

You do realise, that at the time the so called "casino money" was clean? The EULA didn't forbid casinos.But after the CS:GO gambling scandal CCP thought it would be safer without them, so they changed the eula and banned everyone.Still the money wasn't dirty at the time

I found mine already, remember what thread we are commenting in. OP asked for a novel solution and i pointed out that there was unlikely to be one that someone else hasn't already been found.
---
that's true of any comp doing that dps with such high numbers, the fact that you don't have a shooting radious the size of the moon in actual ship engagements means your booshers are very vulnerable and once they're dead the comp is pretty pointless.

There are 3 constants that seems to be there no matter what. The queen, judge judy, and stainguys shit posts

Maybe they didn't put in much thought in it, because they were drunken idiots. But they still framed me for a crime. The guy who sent bombs to Dems weren't too good in it either.

I've never read anything anti-Goon from you.

No, it was a protest platform. Like the Best Party of Iceland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Party It was a way for the people to express their desire to get rid of the damn thing.

---
Sorry I typo'ed in the last phrase there "a non specialized sub-capital group to engage a carrier."  
---
In a sub-cap vs sub-cap fight at least from my perspective at least there is interesting play. If you don't know how to engage a roaming group that is hunting or looking for a sub-cap on sub-cap fight. It's not the ships that are "too powerful" it's a lack of co-ordination and knowledge of engagements on the defenders part. The ships are not unbalanced, you just don't know how to fly or what to bring to counter. (Pro-tip if you bring out a handful of subcaps and the enemy fleet refuses to engage or leaves you are doing it right.) Likewise it could be a numbers issue, you are just you and fighting against 10+ guys in a 1v10 nearly always goes poorly. What your saying is a round about way of saying "I want to play eve by myself Krabing, undisturbed by groups of people trying to kill me because when I fight I lose, and I don't know why. The enemy ships must be too strong. They go faster than my ship, they tank differently than the fits I know of, they shoot from further away than I can. I don't know how to slow them down, or prevent them from killing me from a position I can't get to them in."  
---
In the sub-cap vs capital theater, the sub-cap fleet (not black ops) of 20 or less must be specialized to even engage a carrier. You can't just bring a kitchen sink fleet of ships and expect to win against a carrier. You need a way to mitigate his damage or disable his drones (ECM, logistics, 100mn fits). You will likely need a bubbler to pin him down. If he cynos friends in like most carriers fit to do, you have to simply disengage or loose your whole fleet. Sometimes even just a fax and another carrier can be too much. My idea of a hunter group is a small gang of cruisers and interceptors moving through hostile space looking for targets  of opportunity. (People don't really fly this way often anymore because it's often very unsuccessful due to the speed at which targets can simply dock, the surrounding intel, and the downtime spent jumping gates, which is sad to me.)  
---
If by "hunter" you mean a cov-ops T3 hunter looking to drop then yes you are correct, the fleet behind him is designed to kill a carrier if that is what he is looking for. He has the advantage of being able to simply wait for the right moment provided his fleet is behind him. The response to this is also to simply dock until the hunter leaves because, well the fleet behind him is likely designed to alpha a carrier and ratting will almost undoubtedly result in a loss. The proper response might be to ping your friends, to get ready to counter drop with a bridge, for some fast tackle but sometimes these engagements are over so quick that there is no time.   
---
Of course this mentality boils down to who can bring more stuff faster, which kinda defeats the whole point of bringing a small gang in the first place to anything. Which I guess is the root problem.

Let the damage cap but stop with the armor and structure timer. It could be healthy for the game that we have only 1 timer after the shield and no timer at all if there is no fuel. These citadel need to die more

Interesting and dynamic game play, really pushing the boundaries of how many F1s can simultaneously be pressed repeatedly around the globe.

Apologies if I gave you the impression CODE has "touched" me. In fact, I don't think I've ever had any contact with CODE as I don't frequent anywhere they do or if I have it didn't have enough impact for me to remember it. I just think groups of people who spend their time trying to drive players away from the game in high sec rather than engaging with the game outside of high sec are kind of pathetic. Whatever the justification they use for it they're simply bad for the game overall. Mind you, this is just my opinion and isn't an absolute truth.

The system is flawed because no one hunts bounties. The max value is necessary because of the insurance, as you said, but it also invalidates the purpose of bounties.
---
No one puts bounties on anyone other than as joke, or they don't know better, because you don't get anything in return.  They aren't hunted and killed in an expensive ship, that cost them more than your bounty.
---
That would be the only case it'd make sense to use bounties. But in that case we probably are back to alts claiming the bounty.
---
Project Manhattan was almost 2 years ago in early spring 2017.

And we don't need goon SRP. From what I know the Perimeter market hub has made us more profit than we lost in dreads.

A quick story: a small group of low seccers were told by snuff directly that ’if you don’t fight us we’ll RF all your structures’, so the group regularly fought snuff and they lost but they gave ‘gfs’ and so their structure were left alone.
---
Some time later a third party made the call to band together to rise up against snuff, the call was answered and snuff were (in this particular battle) defeated.... https://zkillboard.com/related/30002036/201811252000/
---
However, although snuff apparently wanted gf’s, instead of accepting the loss and moving on they waged an eviction campaign against the aforementioned small low sec group who were forced to leave the area dramatically reducing content for all in that region.
---
Moral of the story, snuff are victims of their own success. They have inflated to such an extent that it is not even worth turning up to fight them. It is also a case of ‘damned if you and damned if you dont’ when it comes to providing them with content. My advice would be to just let them get on with it, as is with eve at some point they’ll all fall out with each other and corps will go their separate ways *shrugs*

I can only speak from personal experience when it comes to me trying to fix something broken with EVE:

---
Other alliances have titans = shitty state of eve?
---
Oh, I wondered what they were complaining about. Perfectly normal stuff then?
---
It needs a sign that says: "Thanos was here" !
---
Is this the top corp tax payments in perimeter keepstar? 
---
My debit bank card worked just fine, got me a ticket. As has the last X number debit cards I've had through my bank. If you can pay with it in a store it should work fine online. Unless your bank has some arbitrary rules.
---
wait, wut? SRP from Goons?   I need someone to doctor up a nice little titan loss mail for me
---
If you have a freighter or a JF, maybe but I don't know. If you only have a T1 hauler or a DST/BR, compare to most common isk making, not really.
---
It’s fine though, honestly we were having issues getting people in the hole, but we just waited.  We have people in all the tzs.  Out of the 100 that had things to do with the hole we managed to scrounge up enough members to take care of ourselves.  The timing couldn’t have been worse with the war up north.  Most of our guys were deployed and it’s a pain to go back and forth like that.
---
Bots don't evolve, silly
---
10bil and it's yours
---
No your stupid.
---
    &gt;Vouching in 2019
---
Also logi makes it a fleet not a small gang, do a damage and tackle!
---
And once is more than enough.
---
No and if you think it can be distilled down into one reason then you're either argumentative and trying to win upvotes or stupid. Pick one. 
---
this
---
What about saving your fit with cargo and just click fit ship 
---
Yes. 
---
- Implants increase training speed by a decent ammoint
---
- You can buy skill injectors on the market but it's rather costly if you are a new players
---
Keep in mind that everything you can buy with real money, you can buy with isk since you can buy PLEX from players. So you can basically trade farm time for PLEX in Eve.
---
Do you know anything, at all, about Bat Country?  I love them with all my heart, but this was a long time coming.
---
I know for a fact Lilith is a gate camper. Picked off their camp a few times. All they do is camp auga.
---
I approve of this drop.
---
Thats more batphones than I can count on two hands, well played
---
I quite agree. "Oh damn  none of my desired fighter on market. Well I can get this second best type and still be useful." Better than

"Oh shit an empty space! " While in battle

Praise Bob!

It's coming back, we've just been on a holiday break :D

shield slaves? logi on killmails? the list goes on forever
---
As mentioned in other comments, the save fit option helps you with this. It saves the bays you set even. It's how I save time with my tengu. I have all three fits I normally used saved and linked in the in game notepad and its just two clicks once you are in the right ship. Click link then click fit. It also warns you when you are missing something from it when you click fit. 
---
dude it was genius .. take another upboat
---
Excellent!
---
&gt; Is abyssal deadspace good isk ?
---
Yes. I can pull between 40M and 80M per site in 20min (sometimes less), with an occasional good loot (skill book, unstable mutaplasmid that can be worth 100M to 500M), and not counting BPCs which if you build from can help you make a little extra. That is not subtracting the cost of the filament, which for T4 gamma is 15M~ for example.
---
&gt; And do you just buy the filaments of the market to go there?
---
T1 filament from from datasite but unless you are a new player you do not want to run those. T4, T5 and T3 to some extend is where the real isk is. You will drop higher tier filament from running the sites.
---
You will most likely run one specific weather of one specific tier so you will not have enough of those looted to keep running them, so you will have to buy them from market, and buy them in pack (like 20) so you don't run dry.
---
With Tengus you can repackage them completely and refit from fit, but that's not really viable for anything but T3Cs and corvettes. Also that wouldn't help capitals since secondary bays aren't well supported.
---
Is this a roleplay post?
---
Wat
---
Lol
---
As long as rigs don't change just saving the fit then fit to active ship works for sub caps in my experience, which is why I mentioned the tengu. I've never been in a cap so I can't speak to that. 
---
This post is horribly inaccurate and full of sperg but is great propaganda.

If CCP were to implement all of these QoL changes so we can save time while playing, what the hell would we do when logged in?

I thought they were will praxis mining as alphas.

Let's just ignore the part where CFC actually tried to "invade" lowsec and got humiliated by the lowsec dudes.
---
fixing faction warfare? 
---
Honestly I have not tried, it certainly works with modules... Then again, I don't fly any caps yet. 
---
CCP doesn't seem to be doing anything about fixing anything lately... but hey, new ships and instanced gameplay! Yay! (/s)

I was hoping for CCTV footage of a gay orgie from PL’s S&amp;M meet-ups But we can’t all have what we want.

care to elaborate?

It's 20% *after subtracting insurance*.

So for t1 ships it's literally shit. Like 3%.
---
/u/Amrastion_Tasartir fite me

I disagree, but to each his own opinion mate.

Just remember to aim for the bushes.

"Keep your shit sorted" :D
---
don't you see he was just pretending to be retarded?
---
&gt; You sure won't play that many hours after you've started to play eve. You will however spend an awful lot of time talking with people while not really doing much in-game.
---
This is a pretty accurate description for a lot of people. I can't count the amount of new players that popped into r/eve voice and just hung out for hours, days or even weeks.
---
Isn’t this what most nullsec groups do in their space? Drop everything that moves so they can carebear in peace ? 
---
shut the fuck up you monumental retard
---
Does anyone know why when you hover over an item you're about to sell, it gives an estimated market value, but when you go to sell it, it won't let you?
---
Really? If they’re taking out the insurance and loot value it should be like 90% of what’s left.
---
TIL Hedliner telling his side of the story is "spinning". You're about as dumb as Valkorisa and sue Abbott. 
---
Who would have thought that an entity that can evict people will evict them when they batphone everyone to outnumber them 4:1?
---
500 active members? Galmil took cloud ring with much less than that with hardly any cap usage.

It’s simple, find a target, deploy near them, grind them down.

Yep. The CSM has pushed for it to be increased to 50% or something in the past, but :ccp:

It's okay, we'll make you jc to perimetre all year long.

I mean if you used it in the context you did in that original statement it would totally be viewed as a negative, yes. That's how the language works, context is more important than the potential meaning of a word in a vacuum.
---
My F1 is ab/mwd, f2 is point/scram, f3 and on is web, guns etc.
---
Keep dreaming, we're all practising virgins.
---
Great idea, but I would keep it to supers and titans.
---
So would that mean that every 3 character in game one is an alt? So the actual amount of real online player would be around 25% less? Not counting bots and stuff? 
---
Complaining about complaining about downvotes is as equally lame as downvoting because you dont like the fractal fractal fractal fractal
---
You can make a good living spec hauling in a DST in high sec, depending on your risk tolerance. It'll be very slow to start unless you have a good amount of starting capital.
---
I think that's because you have the selling time set to "immediately". Because of that you can only sell stuff immediately only by the price of the buy order made by a player. If you set the time to days/weeks/months then you can sell it at any price you want (but that is different because you make a sell order, which means that it will show up in the market waiting for another player to buy it). Don't know if that makes sense, but maybe someone will elaborate more clearly.
---
maybe its the high altitude talking but that made me lol irl. Now some table full of frenchies thinks im weird, thanks dude.

PL needs to relearn its roots of turning one man into ten. Noir and all the great MC boys of old didn’t just scale down the F1 meta to defeat people, they leveraged guerilla level warfare to harass and demoralise with sniping and smash and grab attacks. He problem in my opinion is that all your training groups just do scaled down versions of the bigger comps and don’t actually make guerilla warfare effective by promoting individual pilot skills. When PL was formed we were harassing groups 5 times our size with half a dozen guys by using horrifically oppressive compositions that couldn’t be countered by a F1 fleet. Instead if just finding the comp that works for 50 dudes countered by their 50mdude comp you operate like the SAS and split into 4 man type patrol groups with specialist roles using every creative tool in the box to divide and scatter the blobs you attack, then you relearn the art of exfiltration. Forget the reddit blurballs, you didn’t stand and fight baiting and get back to teaching people how to conduct multi pronged attacks. We still have the tools it’s the mindset that’s the problem, you’ve got an opportunity for a clean break start to build from, keep doing what you are doing supporting the big fleet meta but start working on small SIG training to get back to what PL did best - ignore the peanut gallery. I know how good the Noir era guys were and I believe if you take some Brave decisions you can get back to that. There are still plenty of cancer fleet comps to be found outside the n+1 sphere, you just need to be willing to ride out the naysayers and armchair critics to get there. But it’s your shop Hedliner, you are passionate about this shit and you’ll do what’s right as you see it, I just want PL to weather this shitshow of mediocrity because Eve can be so good when you hit that sweetspot of the right guys just tearing it up across an ocean of tears.

Accepting smaller isk payments to welp to snuff.

Minmatar LVL 5 and Gallente Carrier 5 is what you need in wh :D

*"no amount of loot will ever get you the skill to be on my level"*

Of course, we know it doesn’t count if you put it in your mouth. At least what’s what the school priest told me.

His burns were way better than yours. You killed a content creator who is going around solo gratz. I especially liked the tripled your net worth burn lmao

I know they’ve brought Brave up to Gem for important ops, so it wouldn’t make much of a difference if they deployed too

I second that. Been ganking for like 4-5 years now, the numbers are in decline.

Most boring ass Corp I've ever been part of

I mostly assumed it was a "well, we need to entertain our pvpers somehow" sorta thing.  vOv

close enough
---
Sweet baby Jesus, just look at that Ascension bump. I guess players just don't have a reason to subscribe.
---
Nice idea but you forgot to mention that you lose the loot to looting bots there. 
---
It's a good risk vs reward model. Do you want to go to Dread V for top-damage epenis, but risk a month of training if you can't extract. Or are you happy with Dread III and you only put a day at risk...
---
Right, because there are absolutely no goons on that BR...
---
Are you talking about the corp deployments that had zero bloc FC’s/skyteam involved?
---
Why would a member of a officially homo-friendly alliance call you homo in a manner you are implying?.. 
---
Some of those lowsec brawls were legit great &amp; bloody though.  
---
Ding ding ding. It was more of a “3member corps are already doing this, let’s froth hostiles up, and give people something of a framework to strive for as a possible idea”.
---
An average Joe trader will flip (buy/sell) around 25k-30k PLEXes / day. A good trader will flip like 70k-100k / day.
---
My idea is not to hurt normal player but the traders that have ZERO risk on that way of making isk: they stay in Perimeter market and put buy orders / from personal assets they move plexes to vault / redeem them in citadel / put sell order.
---
Sounds like you have some insight, what's that name of your chat channel? 😉
---
How about a succinct summary of every eve reddit post? https://youtu.be/oGUJxvpxyvk
---
Yeah I ended up in one of those with TIKLE, flew logi without whore drones, I was ver sads, fleet was continued by DV when Fawlty went to bed,
---
Much fun.... 
---
Yep, and it was such a departure from their usual modus operandi that they ran a poll on it beforehand among their player base, which I don't remember the numbers but came out overwhelmingly in favor of the idea. I doubt that combination of circumstances will occur again.
---
not sure if copy pasta or 500 words of concentrated autism
---
High cost items are still in panfam citadels lol
---
Nice try Auraus
---
i find you completely correct in saying he is a content creator, i for one, enjoyed the content his Loki gave me very much, but no where near as much as his salt in local after.
---
For the record, anyone going around solo in a logi ship cannot be allowed the chance to complain about dieing to a small gang.
---
Someone link the recording of Nulli welping supers to PL and Tri
---
Yeah, I know it at least works with ammo and scripts, but sure if it would work with drugs and fuel.
---
Fuck off dude.
---
You are a shitposter.
---
You are NOT allowed to make such a good proposal !!
---
How often did I think of this …
---
(You have my upvote of course)
---
So you are sad that the Entity that was holding nearly all money moons in the region before Lifeblood also does after that patch because they adapted to the new meta and now actually put some Excavators onto their Super-Tackle&amp;Loot-Rorquals?
---
Now what do you want??
---
If Lowseccers say its shit to be forced to mine when you wanna PvP, and shit to take away the No.1 income source of Lowsec-PvP-Groups everybody screams "Reeee, adapt or die!". If they than do and adapt to new meta, same people go full "Reeee".
---
They are one in the same
---
Classic AP
---
SNUFF is old and dying, weakened by strong entities such as NC, PL and Horde - removing these athanors would cripple SNUFF's massive low sec rental income and render them poors. Heed the call, Amarr victor!
---
I think there is a huge mismatch between what people on the outside think we were, are, could be and should be or perceived to be versus what we as an alliance (and in particular what I myself) think about all of those things. EVE is a game of ebb and flow in practically every respect and navigating your way through that ebb and flow in a way that works for you is ultimately what matters which is all we've ever done regardless of other people's opinions no matter how loud or obnoxious they may be. I also don't think you can even attempt to call the recent run in Geminate mediocre, unless of course you're batting for the other team and are more or less obliged to in the interests of saving face.
---
I'd rather not. A big part of the charm of this game is how non-hand-holdy it is. It's my responsibility to check for those things, just like I need to check the number of zeros on a contract or market order, or that I'm on the proper overview settings.
---
No that would be the right place 
---
Can confirm was owned
---
that loki does not look like a solo ship to me...
---
People that solo don't have the god given right to be excluded from gatecampers.
---
When we catch a solo guy on a gate... unless we know them (i.e. spaceship friends).. we blow them up.
---
Ooof.
---
Everyone enjoys their first frag over a bill.

The alliance name for the gankers seems pretty accurate.

GET REKT BADDIE

I guess on this occasion he decided to NOT use those Role Bonus 'Feathering Tactics'

Was rekt. Am bad. Next caller.

pretty sure he's just miffed about getting wrecked by the NPC's.

Your gang doesn't look like it was much of a threat.

Oh man, that's a good laugh.

My algorithm for creating shortcuts:

If ship does not have a certain module, everything is shifted left.

It's a rage by the ass kicked ones against the kicking side. Garst, Is that you again?
---
In the Eve Online Launcher, go to the "Shared Cache..." setting (top right corner of the launcher, next to the minimize button) and perfrom in order:
---
1. Fix permission of the cache folder/files.
---
2. Verify integrity of the cache folder/files.
---
Close and restart the launcher. If that doesn't fix the issue, your cache folder might be corrupted (assuming your file system is okay) or inaccessible (make sure you can access and create files in the cache folder, check file permissions and space left on the hard drive). However, you might have to reinstall the Launcher after all. If the reinstallation of the Launcher also fails, which is quite likely, you might want to give the beta Eve Online Launcher a try:

I think for a lot of people, that period gets wishy-washy.  There were definitely plenty of big coalition-level lowsec fights after the viceroy stuff was announced but before the war properly kicked off where Asher, for example, was running big Mach fleets into Lonetrek (over Co2 moons, iirc).  
---
I wanna say the stuff that was really a swing at the viceroy stuff was Dec 2015-Jan 2016, mostly in Black Rise, before our lowsec attention turned to more serious business in Lonetrek in Feb-March.
---
Excavator booshing.
---
Afaik olmeca, myself, and the Wu Tang Clan are the only people to do it successfully.
---
Only person autistic enough to industrialize it is olmeca tho. I just enjoy the isk to Plex my 10 accounts + extra.
---
well, unless flair is bait, its a terrible rp post!  
---
this call to arms in the name of freedom is spoken like a true gallente, where as a true caldari would praise the capitalist exercise that 'deploying refineries on all money moons in lowsec for renting purposes' is.
---
Great contribution! Thank you! Keep feeding the community! Take my upvote.
---
Mouth Breathing Retard. Nice.
---
If you are very lonely and looking at rocks all day long while mining ... I guess this qualifies as a QoL improvement.
---
If something works in theory, but nobody can use it successfully, then the theory is wrong...
---
Building a new freeport market in HS or LS more than 1 jump away from Jita/Amarr/Dodixie/Hek/Rens is a thing, which has been attempted seriously only by few people. I don't really know how successful they were financially. I think (Does that count as "theory"?) it should be profitable, but - since there's a lot of work to do -- probably not the best ISK/hour.
---
Didn't even have to bait with an OOC alt.
---
It depends how much you want to play. If you insist on grinding to plex your account with in game money, you’ll need to play for quite a bit, at least at first. But as long as you don’t do that you can play as little or as much as you like and still have fun. 
---
That would require actual cargo to work in the fitting window lol....
---
yeh, sucks for those who didnt get on the killmail and be a true part of this.
---
and have you looked at the fit? it only has a large booster, not XL. so yes, this loki would break with what small group we had.
---
.....Santa?
---
Yeh no, most of eves items won't show up in cargo, when you save it. You can't see if the items are fitted or in cargo most of the time, unless we are talking charges and such things. 
---
I've flown with that loki.
---
I know that what you had there was not a threat to it.
---
Good boy
---
I heard if you learn the mechanics you have a much better chance of not dying to them. Sucks when you're trying to make content without understanding the game. 
---
If someone tells you that you owe something - tell him to go fuck himself.
---
This also applies if someone gives you something valuable in exchange for expecting you to do something in return, as long as that person isn’t blue. 
---
Truer words, dude, truer words.
---
i didnt realise you was in the lowsec side of that gate waiting for him incase he made it back to gate, which to be fair, he nearly did until we got 2 bumps off on him.
---
but i guess your just presuming this is everyone. its ok, easy mistake to make reddit forgives you.
---
Honestly how dare you 
---
Traveling through highsec is something I've done undisturbed for for years now. In fact more often than not, the faction npcs will web first putting you into warp faster, making it possible to travel highsec in even the largest of ships.
---
atleast they brought a fight which is more then most of the players would have done...
---
Aww, you're so humble now.
---
You know all those stories where a solo player or tiny gang somehow prevails against a much larger or more powerful force because someone on the larger force forgot to bring a single item of something?
---
Yeah, this change would get rid of that.
---
Allowing for (some) human error is what makes for interesting stories and is good game design.
---
Nice kills!
---
what?
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
I find this post offensive please remove it
---
ImHard?
---
One group? Lol. Making money on making drugs is easy and tons of people do it. My Corp have been doing it for years. Buy bulk, sell bulk and you will make a ton of profit. 
---
PLEX is a special item. 
---
If your money gets stolen from the card, you go cry to the bank, and not just hope for the best. 
---
As someone who identifies as a Harugumo, I find this post offensive and ask that you either edit it to be Harugumo-friendly, or delete the entire post. Thank you for your sensitivity and cooperation.
---
it's incredibly infuriating. I want my pink Mega.
---
Isn't that what we all do?
---
the mechanic's are not difficult to learn.  
---
The problem here is being straddled on a highsec gate with bad sec status.
---
If this happens on a lowsec -&gt; lowsec connection there is no issue. he can keep crashing forever until help arrives.
---
But being caught on lowsec-&gt; highsec is just shitty luck.
---
To say he doesnt "understanding the game"  is retarded.
---
I've never seen anyone beaten up for lunch money. Is this a generational thing? 
---
Theoretically it will pull the can after you flip it right? And you can just flip the can with a fleet member in a frig that warps off after flipping? Besides unless the bot has a combat ship no one is gonna light you up when you flip the can.
---
I'll be there, OP
---
Just get gud.
---
your saying you know things that you cannot possibly know about.
---
and i just pyfa'd that fit. it tanks 1600dps with strong blue pill and hardshell 4 running
---
blaster thorax, ham loki, RLML rapier, bomber is going to put some serious pressure on that tank.
---
the fit is over 4% on cpu AND powergrid meaning he was in genolutions, so it cannot be Crystals.
---
im afraid that loki dies no matter what he does. never mind the friends that could of joined but were holding the gate on the other side.
---
I tried to get into it a few years ago, so it might have changed. I was under the impression that there were a few key clouds you had to mine for the ingredients and from that produce the drugs. Those particular areas were controlled by a group that produced most of the drugs for the game. Is that wrong?
---
Okay Fire away in what situation would you use one?
---
with 40k friends
---
wait what but he has been in goons a few weeks only or a month at most and why he was crying over losing it
---
It's an ok video but there is no historical context or historical footage.   Like this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvB2nRGMl2c&amp;t=18s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvB2nRGMl2c&amp;t=18s)

Shut up, you bigot!
---
PVE
---
It's far more fun watching Wrik lose arty Panthers to Chinese krabbers though. 
---
Nope Turrets are fine, they perform great.
---
Thing with XL Missiles is you have so many different reasons why they're shit:
---
Application to Dreads while drifting is just one of them, you usually don't see any doktrin Dreadnoughts with MWD in their midslots. Most go for Capacitor Modules, Tracking Computer, additional Scanresolution or the usual PvP Webber, Grappler and Disruptor combo. 
---
An ordinary Carrier can achieve speedtanking XL Missiles too by slowboating with 80m/s basespeed straight in one direction.
---
Not to any crazy degree but you take about 10%-15% less damage.
---
Also back in the days when there could be several Point Defenses fitted to a Citadel, XL Missiles could not hit anything inside PDrange because Missiles take AoE damage too.
---
Same Principle as Point Defence, in bigger TiDi Fights nowadays Leviathan and Phoenix are the only ships that can be actively "firewalled" by placing bunch of smartbombing battleships between them and their target canceling their DPS entirely.
---
Same as subcap missiles those XL ones also got a damage delay and its easier to call for aid in fleetfights.
---
In big TiDi fights Caldari Capitals usually shoot structures because they're fcking useless otherwise.
---
Generally confirmed, Minmatar and Gallente have the best Capital Ships, followed by Amarr.
---
You can look it up too by counting numbers of operational capitals on zkillboard. Look at overall Deaths / Kills of all Capital Vessels.
---
This way you see wich Faction gets fielded the most, hint there is a reason behind it.
---
Entire Caldari Capital Lineup is kind of lacking tbh.
---
You don't seem to know much about Lowsec or you are a quite new player. Before the transformation of several southern nullsec regions into hello kitty island and the Lifeblood Moonmining Patches a lot of Lowsec Groups were filthy rich and had large capital numbers, even Titans and Supers. After Phoebe patch these were used on daily basis, as you only had to scout inside 1 mid jumprange.
---
They are technically there in the code, but not displayed in the fitting screen (ccp things). 
---
People usually import the fit from pyfa or one of the other fitting tools with all the stuff in cargo. 
---
Even though the extra stuff doesn't show on the fitting, if you try to multibuy the fitting all the items are there. 
---
"not possibly know about"
---
lol, fragging AP's loki has gone to your head very quickly.
---
but for having tackled it in high-sec, you had 0 chance of killing it.
---
Awww Shucks. It's good to know my F1 mashing skills are appreciated
---
He depleted his salt reserves
---
More like: "hey guys we are gonna form a coalition of alliance to fight snuff"
---
&gt; then proceed to never attack any snuff structures that is onlined in the next 2weeks.
---
&gt;then blame snuff for going on the offensive.
---
and oh yeah, when we "evicted" you, your coalition had already disbanded after loosing 1 fight.

They updated the fittings recently. I believe it will save refits, etc in the fittings now.
---
Rebuild? PL is one of the top alliances looking at active pvp, and they are far from the largest
---
Oh this is great
---
what's a scout? whats dscanning a gate and finding another way around so you dont get so mad you end up getting shamed by autists on reddit?
---
Nice work. The final numbers you have are too high with your default values though. Even the theoretical maximum needs to account for the timer not running while you kill the rats.... and in the real world you're going to have to fight and/or run from opponents from time to time. More importantly though the ISK/LP drops dramatically as you go up in tiers. 2000 ISK/LP is achievable if a faction has been at T1 for a while, but prices will drop dramatically as you go up in tiers. At T4 to T5 you're looking at half that return or less. Then again perhaps you can achieve that number if you play the market over the long haul of months or years only cashing out when your faction hits T1 and stays there for a while. 
---
If you *really* want to get rich in Faction Warfare though you run L4 missions as your LP/Hour is much higher than plexing.
---
i have no idea who this AP is, im guessing from this post its some AT dude that some people know about?
---
he died just like any other nerd in hisec does, badly, with tears in local.
---
im interested to know how you think a loki that cannot tank the dps on the group that caught him, when he has 0dps and is alone without a cyno could ever not become a killmail
---
Exactly my thought
---
This. I've always told my self speed is life. You can worry about finding the F4 key and applying damage only after you've provided for your own immediate existence. 
---
Unless you have a doctorate in Customer Service, you can wait in the application queue like everyone else.
---
yeh i can see how a ship caught by 2 rapiers, a web loki, and a web on a thorax all giving enough time to bump him away from gate too, in a ship that couldnt tank the dps if he had drugs and heated everything.
---
yep, that ship for sure makes it back to gate xD
---
&gt; Horde has no real SRP
---
Are you from 2015?  Because that's about the last time this was true.
---
Are you talking about FEDUP?
---
Rofl! Another person throwing around words they don't understand. I'll have you know I'm a very tolerant guy! I just don't like people accusing people of being Nazis when they're clearly not. It's inflamatory and unnecessary. If you disagree with someone tell them you disagree with them. Don't call them a Nazi or a bigot unless they demonstrably are. 
---
highlight of 2019 for these guys. Enjoy being irrelevant for another 11 months. 
---
wait this guy is just too darn smart to be Autism, please drop roles immediately.  
---
We only take idiots in non threatening ships. @Btr0n, you got any more tristans lieing around and want to come fly with us?
---
:p
---
 !remindme 30d 
---
well considering your group felt that fragging "just another nerd" in high sec was worthy of a reddit post i think it is a safe bet to assume you have some idea of who he is.
---
I'm not going to break it down for you. But your bravado over a single logi frag in highsec is really impressive. 
---
Are you telling us TAPI doesn't have SRP?
---
I’ve been in too many battles like Geminate to ever make a call on what was good bad or mediocre, so much of Eve is built on elaborate chess strategies where the peanut gallery just see the BR score. I agree nobody outside a groups leadership really understands what the actual business plan is, for good o-security reason and the majority of reddit is little more than a base for propaganda and peanut gallery grudges to be aired. It’ll get downvoted but a lot of newer players don’t really understand the political narrative as well as they think they do, or the ever shifting sands of ‘the enemy of my enemy is also my friend.’ I think all said and done you do the best by your own people, walk your own path and try and communicate what you are to the people that matter to counter the false narrative of opinion bias. People hate PL because reasons, people have goons because reasons, and yet we are all PL or all goons to someone.Not that this matters in an era where the average reddit contributor has the comprehension of a child and prefers to karma whore withthroaway low effort ur mom trolling rather than contributing to any discussion. I miss the old forums, the level of intro alliance educated posting that analyses every aspect of Eve life makes this sub look like the game’s special needs playgroup.
---
The Scan was taken at the end of the Fight.
---
So it is possible that legacy had more while the Fight was going on.
---
Be like me, space retire and shut up about it.
---
CatThrowup i guess its pure bad luck right? i mean a hisec -&gt; Lowsec gate being camped? who fekin knew!!!
---
Turns out ego is a rather ineffective tank.
---
&gt; We have taken your main income source
---
PLEX and injectors are still traded in our cits.
---
&gt; we have helped end your relationship with gotg
---
TEST had literally zero to do with that, the end of that alliance is attributable solely to goons and Sort.  Unless you're dropping the facade, and "we" includes goons now?
---
yes
---
Roses are red

My Thorax is ready
---
Lemme dock up with you
---
Btr0n he pyfa'd that fit he knows everything there is to know about it's mechanics and how to fly it dude, like he's an elite hiseccer and you're just an integritas pubbie m'kay shut up
---
As I just started recently on FW I only took theoretical, possibile values. As Caldari (which is the Faction I am contributing to at the moment) has been T1 for quite some time, that might explain the numbers I have given. 
---
Thank you for your feedback :)
---
I like Ragelindr because he’s intelligent and passionate enough still about Eve to have a proper debate about the game, you clearly on the other hand struggle to rise beyond the Level 1 redditimg of secondhand karma whore memes with no originality, creativity of personal expression of individuality. You are why the F1 blob exists and crayons are not toxic.
---
my bad dude...
---
Awkward, OP is in WKEND, not in FEDUP
---
If you quit, uh......
---
2000LP never happens unless you're stuck in T1 for like a year
---
Most of the time you can expect 800-1000/LP
---
Something else you should consider if your aim is to extoll the virtues of O-plexing... if you're in T5, there are almost no systems left to O-plex, except basically the staging systems of your factional rivals, if even that.
---
This is among the reasons why LP missions are so popular, because it's without any question the best way to cash in on T4/5
---
Yea, i was skeptical at first, but its come together nicely and the new crew is learning to work together faster than I had hoped.  Assembled a solid directorate who knows what we're about and I've been playing literally every day again.
---
ship cancer
---
i can catagoricly state that i read that bio, and was like look hes some elitetist jumped up dude, who crys like a weekend b\*\*ch. and i said someone should put this on reddit (knowingly its the 'im elite' guys who are going to get even madder seeing it)
---
well damn, somone did put it on reddit, and it made today at work that little bit more enjoyable.
---
I WILL break this down for you, ill just say, eve is what you make it, and i play eve for salt, i play eve for moments like this, so yes, when some 1337 nerd dies like an idiot, im going to swim in the streams of the arguments it creates. 
---
we killed other lokis that actually faught back, other small gang, and a freighter in the same day. (not too bad for a small group of friends on a weekday messaround. but yes, only this was put on reddit because of the salt in local
---
the only items traded at your citadels are PLEX and Injectors. (nobody is trading high cost items like forts) at your azbels, but i understand what you mean.
---
And ya, there is more plex in your citadels, 100%. At 1% instead of your previous 5%. We estimate we control between 30-50% of the market and you guys control the rest. But we are making 300-400bil a month for no cost save fuel and you would barely make 100 from the 1% azbels in the best of situations. 
---
So you folks have went from 800 to 100. possibly more than 800 and now you maybe, maybe get 100. It's important to realize as well that the reason you often don't see plex as much at the TTT is cause those are the ones that get bought first. 
---
Actually this is why I miss Jeffs podcasts, it was nice to listen to a hour of proper discussion of the game rather than everything descending into the usual festival of overused one line shitposting this sub has become. 
---
What did you think was going to happen when you dropped Dreads, we were just gonna roll over and take it?
---
Get spanked
---
Just what we need for making future space travel easier, more debris!
---
that is wrong
---
You need to build a Wall, then deploy John Snow on top

xd
---
I'm sorry that my posts upset you so much. 
---
No, it isn't. If you know that those 200 dreads will die, creating a loss of 15-30 days of SP per dread, you don't drop them even if it means 50% of killing some supers.
---
Those 5 guys that roll in HAW dreads or drop them on battleship gangs will do that anyway, coz it's viable for a small number of wealthy folks even if it means SP loss from time to time. Not to mention it will change absolutely nothing about "drop 10 boson titans on a t1 cruiser gang" mentality in friendly space.
---
The problem was he himself, not the game mechanics or bad luck. An ~elite PVPer~ with such mad skills that money can't buy shouldn't be complaining when dying to police. It's not a mystery mechanic.

good stainguy post

Well, there is only three other lowsec gates into Stacmon, so he never would've been able to get around that not threatening gang.

definitely not
---
Why don't you stick your head up Hedliner's ass more, you flairbating twat lol
---
I'm not flairbaiting. I just hate the retarded homering going around, especially by the likes of you.
---
So you just mega blobbed someone, then smugged on reddit?
---
Sincerely, I'm very glad to hear that Grath. PS: You coming to Toronto? If so, I have some beers I owe you and we should talk about how much money it would take to get a picture of you in a Dino shirt, :)

Get blobbed stupid nullsuckers
---
Not sure they'll willingly let me in Canada :(

You sound mad your batphone didn't commit.

1.7 accounts running per UID is an accurate near recent figure.

I really dont know how to respond to your retardation anymore. You win.
---
This article is clearly meant for the educated who aren't ADHD and can read beyond the first sentence. No one who plays Eve will understand a word of it. 
---
Understood, thanks !
---
Concerning about what you said on the "ranking" of capital ship popularity in the current meta, what about the Avatar ? I heard it’s the Titan with the biggest number present on Tranquility.
---
I also understand why XL missiles are really bad, but what about the Chimera and Wyvern ? Since they use fighters, those ships don’t have the drawbacks on using capital missiles, and the bonus to shield resistance could be quite good during encounters, no ?
---
Do you mind if I put this in my bio? 
---
That makes sense and welcome to FW... I look forward to shooting you and being shot by you. 
---
In case you haven't already run across it you'll be interested in Fuzzwork's [ISK/LP Tool](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/) which gives you the ISK/LP at current sell or buy prices by region of all LP products. Here's their chart for [State Protectorate LP buy prices](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/buy/10000002/1000180/withblueprints) in the Forge region. Just note that the really high values are almost always extreme outliers for very low volume products and aren't realistic except for maybe a one time sale. You can also look at the sell prices but I tend to look at the buy prices of a few things I know are reliably salable/higher volume since that gives a decent idea of an almost guaranteed floor that I know I can beat by a few percent.
---
Also I always have the [warzone map](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Caldari_VS_Gallente#kills) open in another window  and often the [eve overmind 1v1 kills %](https://collab.eveovermind.com/solokills.php) for my current ship and/or the [T1 Frigate Balance Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SV_sWWIinoheBaGZgL2nUVJGYwnsNJqJ/view) to have an idea what kind of fight I'm getting into.
---
Man. 10/10 funny. Went wrong not by dieing to npc, but opening ones mouth and arguing on the interwebs, like really? 
---
It'd be a QoL improvement if the rock slowly shrunk/disintegrated as you mined it - basically an easy visual reference on roughly how much m3 was left without needing to use a scanner.
---
Shoulda used Flex Seal
---
go for it.
---
&gt;Most importantly, if you see botting and RMT happening – REPORT IT.

hmmmmmmmm

Please don’t breed, the further IQ dilution of our species can’t take it.

Check Angel Kyss on Eve who. Look at Corp. Consider if evil plan is afoot.

Is this a recurring normal event? Recently returned to eve and gotta say it’s pretty cool people are doing meet ups 10 minutes from my house. Not sure if I can make tomorrow as I have some errands to run but I’ll try. 
---
DDA proc is best proc
---
and obviously, no amount of skill injectors actually gave this guy any skill 😊

Ironically OP isn't even in our alliance he is just using one of our old KMs that's probably the saddest part lol.

...Excuse me?

&gt;Just smash that F1 button.

...Okay... *click*  
---
&gt;HARDER!!! !!!!NEW PRIMARY!! AND SECONDARY!!!!! PRESS IT HARDERRRRRRRR!
---
Yes truly we got baited into getting paid a gorillion isk 
---
Jokes on us 
---
1.  Cannot dock in Neutral or FW Enemy citadels in an Enemy controlled systems.
---
2.  Increased penalties for citadels owned in enemy FW systems.
---
3.  Remove plexing entirely or only allow LP payouts when the system is flipped.  Increase LP payouts for killing FW enemy ships.
---
4.  Only permit plexing / system sieges in systems adjacent to enemy systems... this creates a battlefront which focuses content instead of spreading it out.  Allow a mechanic that enables FW forces to instigate system sieges in non-adjacent systems (like killing the shields on an ihub) or expending a large amount of LP.
---
5.  Revamp system siege mechanics and add incursion-like sites only accessible by FW players.  Both sides can enter these sites and try to accomplish objectives in direct conflict to one another.
---
This is such a roller coaster between "CCP is doing what it can" to "HERE ARE SOME SKINS BECAUSE LOL". One thing I will say : 
---
&gt; Right now, these explorations are in the early stages and aren’t nailed down, but may include things such as high level (level 4 and 5) courier missions, and other similar activities in New Eden.
---
This would be a bit sad. At least L4 for sure.
---
"If you’re an alliance leader, don’t harbour these people – it won’t serve you well in the end."
---
Is this the first time CCP appealed to alliance leaders in this manner?
---
Is this hinting at holding alliance leaders accountable for knowingly allowing bots?
---
Putting characters that have been permabanned into a Doomheim-esque NPC corp would go a long way to making these security efforts more visible to the community. 
---
we might do x y z but dont forget to buy these new police skins
---
Derty Dan was the king of shitposting. He's the hero /r/eve needs.
---
Also downplaying the CFC's viceroy thing is pretty hilarious. 
---
&gt;Also logi makes it a fleet not a small gang, do a damage ship and tackle!
---
don't let raknor hear you say that m8... 
---
&gt;Armor super fleet is a bit of a overstatement. It's tiny
---
Shield alliance has small armor group.  News at 11.  :eyeroll:
---
But everyone still says ENAM
---
also taking donations to fight SNUFF
---
Know all about it :-D
---
Meh Snuff are basically a goon sig at this point 
---
I guess this isn't much of a theory that nobody does or just a few people had success with it but while I was part of the north bot sympathisers I used to run 9/10 Guristas which tend to be the most hated type of escalations since the site has 3 rooms each escalating in different systems sometimes 1-2 regions apart. Made around 10-15bil easly by running them in a 600milish tengu setup while investigating the botting problem and got out of there before doing something rash and hurting the corp I was part of. After 2-3 months the bots are still there btw. LUL Just being cycled from one alliance to the other and probably getting unbanned with fake tickets or not even getting banned at all. Even the vni bots... shameful. Kinda sad now that Sort let his allies backstab him just to let a dying coalition/alliance drag their legs around the dust for another year. No wonder everything was about making money and getting the fuck out after the goons got the station. 
---
Never had much problem. Was a while back tho. Stopped because it's not very good money. Reliable but just not great.
---
I mean.. this is coming from a Chiken...
---
AP never change
---
Nah, they slid that one in once before. It's mostly a nod to the meme.
---
There's a COSMOS Mission in Caldari space that drops HG-1008 implant, worth ~4b. It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to complete. Sounds great right?
---
Only issue is the mission is part of a chain, and one of the missions along the chain requires an item that only drops from a static DED, that spawns twice a day (DT + 30 minutes after 1st clear). It takes basically no time to complete so it can be farmed using arty machs in a few minutes.
---
It also requires standings, but they can be farmed in about an hour while making ~1b/hr at the same time so w/e.
---
Very few people have had success with this simply because nobody is really interested in out-autisming the russians who currently control it since the timezone is god awful for anyone not chinese/russian.
---
Need orbit, prop and hardeners as well then you're solid 
---
Simple farmers have it figured out. 
---
&gt;Problem is people braking the accounts logged limit for alphas.
---
This was a huge issue when Alphas were announced/in the works, I'm still astounded that anybody thought a rule would be followed. 
---
This is actually a really good idea. I'm gonna echo it on eve-o to try to get it some more traction.
---
Go read the INN post and tell me the whole premise was even remotely executable by any entity in even, and then the wording, and THEN tell me it wasn’t a troll to get people frothing at the mouth.
---
That thing was beyond not doable, and clearly designed to troll/make people mad. 
---
So just to be clear, you were krabbing in a wormhole, nullseccers brought a fight to you, you blobbed them, and then afterwards came and smugged about winning a 9 v 2 fight on Reddit?
---
Sounds about right
---
I've seen it the last security update too. I wish there was some way CCP could enforce rules against bot harboring alliances, but it'd be impossible to distinguish those who do it knowingly and those who don't.
---
It's sad though that most alliances are in a race to the bottom in harboring bots ranging from "everyone else is doing it" to "it's not our job to identify bots". Wouldn't take so much effort to at least kick some of them.
---
I dont see a post in recruitment can you help me find it?
---
No?
---
upvoted for reasonable idea ...
---
Goon pets are gonna Goon pet.
---
Even Yonis is better with Loki than he is
---
Asking me to read INN for facts about something the CFC failed at is like asking me to watch Fox News for facts about american politics.
---
Also would be nice if people received automatic responses when their reports actually led to a ban.
---
You wouldn't do that in Stain coward.
---
More importantly for the botters, I think you can run the apoc on an alpha account, while any mining ship bigger than a venture requires omega.
---
Too busy losin' IHUBs 'n dunkin' TEST dreads
---
If you have the skills, use a Leshak, if not, use a polarized large laser boat (abaddon, oracle, navygeddon). Next best bet is High DPS droneboat. But yeah, it'll take a minute...
---
Mods in cargo do show in ingame fits. You can even drag and drop them to a channel and mods stay. Only thing that keeps dissapearing is the mobile depot... 
---
Meanwhile, my recently recovered account that I wanted to drain some SP off of to make a new character remains permanently banned for the last 8 days without any acknowledgement of my ticket appealing the move. 
---
Absolutely ridiculous.
---
this shit is broke lp shop
---
gatecamper dies like bitch, cries about it on Reddit. 
---
Considering the fax cannot be remote repaired, and that dreads are T1 fit and worth about as much as a battleship? No it seems about right. God forbid you have to change targets to the faxes.
---
That's good news for sure! 
---
The sort of people willing to take more effort than copying whatever is popular, mostly don't "offer up" their findings for the public to copy.
---
A couple points:
---
1. Code never claimed it wants to drive players away from the game; In fact CCP has shown that ganking players actually helps with retention.  Source: CCP Rise (http://i.imgur.com/hGTXfll.jpg)
---
2. By your statement, you believe that a group that engages in highsec is playing the game wrong - the "right" way to play is lowsec or nullsec.  Why do you believe one group is "right" and one group is "wrong" in a sandbox game?
---
3.  In line with point 2, the Initiative just evicted Hard Knocks, and I'm sure some HK guys unsubbed as a result.  Did Initiative do something pathetic?  Are they playing the game wrong?  Or are you saying it's okay to drive players from the game as long as you do it in lowsec, nullsec, or wormholes?   What makes highsec so special?
---
 your bar is indeed high lil wings.  
---
Thats a hendrix riff...pretty dank.
---
I think the most important thing to note here is that the art department continues to do great work.
---
Take my money.
---
What about scope videos?
---
Ever heard of a rorqual?
---
no
---
[MISSION ACCOMPLISHED](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/02/46/64/683325/3/920x920.jpg)
---
3k accounts have been banned. That's a lot when you consider current player numbers and that's obviously only the one's that have been caught...
---
So would carriers then simply be useless as a solo player?
---
bad idea imo. No other ship in the game is completely useless without other people.
---
try not botting xd
---
would take a decade to fix it :CCP:
---
works for drugs but not for fuels like isotopes, stront, or liquid o
---
What if the rocks drop loot boxes and make a rewarding little sound when they deplete?   oO
---
I've tried explaining this to people, but no one seems to get it. When you look at the MER you have to factor in the number of people that live in that area. So when you look at say Delve, you see a big scary number. However when you divide that number by the number of people that live there (This gets you a per capita value), you get the per character value mined/ratted/etc. Then you compare that number with other per capita numbers, and you start to see that Goons/Test/Etc isn't actually out mining/ratting everyone else by very much. 
---
You also then have to consider the fact that many of us make our isk in other ways, ways that do not show up on the MER such as Abyssal Sites, Jita Trading, WH alt corp farming C5s, Goon Rorq alts that ship the money back to the north, etc. 
---
Your face is a scope video!
---
(On a more serious note, perfectly valid question - we plan on ramping up with more Scope videos as we roll toward spring/summer &lt;3)
---
Yea, there are a few ships I do this with, quick load up of drones, probes/ammo and boosters.
---
Rigs in cargo?
---
Thanks for the quick answer, awesome to hear that wooo! \o/
---
API doesn't expose this information, so it can't do that.
---
The CCP security team is literally a joke when you have 
---
one of the [nyx botters](https://zkillboard.com/character/1858133092/) that [died](https://zkillboard.com/kill/67209490/) last year is still active
---
Other [botting corps](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98509161/) are also still active, and running around.
---
I didn’t even have the chance yet! /s
---
Really though their approach to account security is to screw legitimate customers, which is bonkers. The behavior that they are triggering a permanent ban on is just silly, but it wouldn’t be so bad if they were able to clear the inevitable support queue quickly and effectively. Alas, :CCP:
---
Yea yea sure you got banned for nothing
---
him raging in local for a loss of his own fault def doesn't make him look good. on the other hand, you gloating cause you f1-ed a npc tackled ship in hisec is pretty damn pathetic
---
I am shocked that someone actually posted this.
---
I will be equally shocked if CCP actually fixes it, however.
---
That would require anchoring a keepstar in lowsec. 
---
Maybe just limit it to L5.
---
Didn't say that... However a  single carrier on grid, unable to jump needs support, no? 
---
Dude with 50-100 accounts using input broadcasting caught with multiple simo-posts in local and submissions not banned = green light to all players to begin input broadcasting.
---
Because a Bhaalgorn, Hyperion &amp; Astero VS a Rattlesnake is such a fair fight. lol
---
AB instead of MWD, wrong boosts type, etc. I had enough time to fix the boosts, didn't realize the AB thing until we were already way out there. 
---
Putting a skin advertisement in a security devblog was a bit tacky. I blame Pearl Abyss.
---
was -7.5 faction private stand   
---
epic arc + 75% booster = 2.53 faction private stand
---
CCPls
---
Couldn't you use the fitting interface for that?
---
Yes the battle rorqual sends shivers down my spine.... 
---
James 315 is completely right. You can't wipe out bots without collateral damage to the bot-aspirants who camouflage them. The burden of responsibility is not on Agents to prove botting, but on capsuleers to prove their humanity.
---
Just to expound on why I recommend the mega-alliances since this is a NQIS thread:  They've got the logistics and support systems already in-place for new players, and they are heavily involved in every aspect of the game.
---
So the new player is going to have a relatively smooth transition to corp life, can get the ships/skillbooks/mods they need to advance, some direction in how to advance, and a chance to try out almost everything the game offers alongside experts in that part of the game.
---
But don't stay in the mega-alliance if it turns out to not be your thing.  Use it as a training ground and then move on.
---
It is entirely possible that someone could land in a similar situation in a small corp (they won't be doing everything but they may be doing the right things for that player).  But it's less guaranteed.
---
tfw a shitpost gets more attention than any of your eve videos

PH isn't a "pet". A pet is someone that claims to be a 'strong independent alliance that don't need no man", then proceeds to call their dad every time they get into trouble. Pandemic Horde was created as a feeder corp for pandemic legion. Like most pandemics it grew to insane size. However it was created with the purpose of being a sister alliance. 
---
Take me home
---
&gt; The Hel is not associated with Goonswarm

Bastion is part of the Imperium

So basically snuff wants rondos to come and feed them.

This is what I got banned for:
---
After leaving the game in 2016, a good friend of mine expressed a desire to play again. I decided to make a new account to play with him, so he could get a little refer a friend bonus, and I also liked the idea of a fresh start. My old character had been around since 2009 and had ~baggage~ as many of us do who have been around awhile.
---
On my new character, I realized that some SP would really work a treat, because fuck flying tech 1 again. After 2+ years, I didn’t remember my old account password, so I went through the steps to reset it, no problem.
---
On my old account, I log in, buy 20 skill extractors, and start draining. I get through those and contract them to my new guy, swap accounts, go pick up my SP, perfect right?
---
A little while later I realize I need more SP, like a heroin junky. So I go to log back into my old account - but no! I have been banned permanently by GM Unicorn Cupcake for “Account Compromise”. 
---
I immediately open a ticket explaining what’s up and asking for unban so I can continue to spend money on this decrepit game that I really shouldn’t have returned to, but always end up returning to in this vicious cycle. And receive no reply. Ever.
---
&gt;the pilot in question actually joined the Goonswarm alliance not long after loosing this Hel
---
Probably to mine a new Hel.
---
Actually..... if there was a little bonus ore if a rock was depleted, that might help clear-out belts/anoms.....
---
Selling intel
---
shut up pavel, go feed some more supers to venal russians
---
Apologies about the editing also thanks to Gold leader for his pov 
---
This idea has been around for years and from time to time it pops up again, the answer is always: it can't be done due to core mechanics that prevent multiple pods to be inside one ship.
---
tl;dr: it could be cool, but it can't be done.
---
Triggered lol
---
pls. don't cry there
---
You clearly learned how to post from vily

Okay.

When are fleet invites going out?

Oh no however will I continue on my life is ruined. Some random space nerd doesn't like me. Ohhhh nooooooooo.

I guess I should thank you really, for the sensible chuckle.

Carful though. Your neck beard is showing.

Yeah, all lp markets just fucked because of that boosters. 
---
That bio is straight AIDS
---
Half of the ships you had there don't apply well to a 100mn loki. Basically only the rlml rapier will apply full damage to it 100% of the time and it has more than enough tank to survive that plus whatever dps is applying from the other ships.

thats a nice pic of an apocalypse! such a sexy ship

To my dear horde/goon krabs, anyway i will write bugreport)

Because the pople who found far better ways wont share them.
---
I liked the idea someone had before of the bounty office handing out random individual bounty contracts to bounty hunters. That way CCP doesn't have to worry as much about players farming bounties on themselves with an alt. it could still happen if the player gets lucky, but isn't likely to happen often. That leaves the only way to exploit bounty/insurance fraud is for two random players with no reason to trust each other to agree to it: "I have your bounty contract... let me kill you and I'll split the reward with you".... I think you could significantly increase the bounty % before fraud becomes a serious issue. Also... I think it'd be cool to for the bounty hunter to have a list of specific targets he needs to hunt down. 
---
Yes, this was back before everybody got lunch for free. 
---
I support pavels campaign to afford a new rag to feed to horde.

One one hand you describe yourself as a turbo-autist that just lives off other people's tears, and on the other hand you're describing yourself as a casual 'friend of friends' that just plays on the weekend.
---
You have to stay true to one strategy, either you play the autist, or the relaxed casual that doesn't give no shit
---
It’s only for elite players sorry you won’t 🤪
---
You left PL too?
---
Yes mate. I am aware. But how often do you jump a rorq into battle? 
---
I name thee honorific nullsec'ers.

That's about bare minimum of what's needed to break a rattle.... So yes.
---
The pirate epic arcs give a 30% standings bonus base, or 37.5% bonus if you have Social V. Throw the Potency-75 into the mix though and it's a 100% bonus, or 60% total for finishing the arc.   
---
For example, if you were -10 to a pirate faction, did the epic arc with Social V + P-75, you would go from -10 to 2.0 instantly. If you had neutral 0 standings, you would go from 0 to 6 and instantly gain access to level 4 burners. 
---
Awesome! Thank you for the response.
---
OH SHIT THAT GUY, he’s killed me before 
---
I am aware of Fuzzwork's ISK/LP tool, but it shows wrong pricing for some of the items (considering Jita prices), I managed to sell a type of Datacore yesterday getting \~1900 ISK/LP for buy orders and it was featuring a large quantity per day aswell (I double checked my calculations on that aswell). Though that is mostly because of the long time Caldari has T1. 
---
Overmind &amp; the Balance Sheet are two great ressources, thanks for providing! 
---
Also looking forward to shooting you, see you in space! o7 
---
You can already know approx. how much is being mined in a system without going there. Use the ingame map to show the system indexes. Right click systems with index 6, show info, show industrial index. It shows up to +200% of max level. If it's 150-200%, then there is heavy mining going on in that system on a regular basis.
---
Where is the third option of it being the truth?
---
Pilot probably couldn’t care less that he / she lost his hel.

This sounds like PL circa 2015.

Fights still start because of scarcity, not abundance. Scarcity defines your personality as much as abundance.
---
People with too much tend to get lazy, people with too little tend to get desperate. Desperation is what drives conflict, abundance doesn't.
---
When there is no risk of running out of resources, there is no need to plan accordingly. There is no need for desperate measures and there is no actual need for fighting over something, because you do not need anything.

Gonna do my bio like that, clever girl

Did you really colored out that character just to find it on the killmail?

You're aware that according to CCP, newbies who get suicide ganked are more likely to keep playing the game, right?

People still care about this kind of thing?
---
MOAR GONNIE TEARS

Hey now that's no way to talk about yourself. 
---
Please consider suicide.
---
Hrs talking about you saying you don't have kids
---
Its funny when professional burner-ratters with multiple accept/decline mission alts cries on reddit about lp-shop death. They do infinite mission runs without of necessity in waiting 4 hours after mission decline for a years. And now this can be doing by everyone.
---
WOW
---
They can, if they can focus on one target and all come it at once, at the right range. 
---
Doesn’t sound like any of that happened in this battle 
---
Yeah, I think it's a bit behind the real market and it only features the highest buy/lowest sell order at that moment in the past so sometimes you see some random order that's already been filled. Since I'm Gallente so I usually just do VNI's without putting any thought into it. They might not be the best ISK/LP at any given time but they'll always close to it and there's always demand. Not sure what the equivalent would be for you squids, or if there even is one... the VNI's dominating popularity as a ratting ship really is unfair.
---
Me, I use 1,2,3,4,5 and so on.

Is mar5hy banned yet or still protected?

They don't have access to DUI records from longer than 7 years ago and its up to the border guard to check, just mentioning it for a friend.

Panfam is a coalition, gotg is not part of panfam. It's really simple. To NC and horde, as long as you:
---
-don't attack each other's infrastructure
---
-team up for the big fights
---
-try not to bother each other's krabs TOO much
---
you're a coalition, even if you occasionally reset each other for content.
---
That's why many in the North see ImpLeg as a single coalition, because the relationship between Imperium and Legacy is similar to the relationship between NC and Horde, and everyone agrees that Horde and NC are part of a single coalition.
---
Also "call in big daddy NC to win the supercap fight for them while a handful of their alliance members join the NC superfleet"...
---
Nobody's saying that NC hasn't been a big help (they have) but let's look at the latest fight where panfam dropped supers: the dread dunk. Here are the numbers deployed by each member of panfam (according to the BR I saw):
---
Titans:
---
NC-29
---
PH-24
---
PL-11
---
Supercarriers:
---
NC-18
---
PL-7
---
FAX:
---
PH-20
---
PL-20
---
other caps (dreads and carriers):
---
NC-19
---
PL-21
---
Say what you want about PH, but that doesn't look like a "handful of alliance members joining NC's superfleet" to me.
---
TL;DR: Horde and NC seem to have a similar relationship to Legacy and Imperium. To panfam, that means they're in a coalition. Seems like you're the one claiming they aren't in a coalition. Also the latest fight makes your claim about horde relying heavily on NC's super fleet kind of laughable. Sure, NC's helped a ton, but horde formed just about as hard in the most recent fight.
---
Apparently he has "protection".
---
Ow, too soon bro

Wow it's spicy in here

wtf is that fit tho

Or war dec them and take the structure down! Thats my solution.. Only good one next to being able to fuel random people shit.

Whats the old saying? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes?
---
I agree. Sp trading has destroyed the game.
---
How long did this take you? It looks amazing!
---
Pyfa amd ZKillboard are sufficient for most people these days.
---
used to be worse
---
I understand.  I see people recommend newbie corps to day old characters.  A new player gets past the tutorial and maybe has completed some of the career agents and is asking what to do.  It comes down to that player wants to keep learning things on their own for a while or if they want some guidance from someone else.  I usually recommend staying in highsec for at least two weeks.  The first week complete at least some of the career agents missions, mine, explore, get used to piloting/combat/navigation AND ask a LOT of questions.  One of those questions should be what do I like to do.  Then the next week start testing the waters in player Corp recruitment.  Ask recruiters what you need to ask/know, what do you need to do.  What should you start training for (if Omega, a nullified interceptor is a really good idea as a first "expensive" ship, alphas should take a hard look at the astero).  By the end of the second week a new player should have a pretty good idea of where they want to go, how to get there and be able to even fly the right ship(s) to accomplish it.  I would say every player should be interacting with another player (or group of players) on a regular basis by the end of 4 weeks, even if they are taking their time or are a "slow learner".  That will lead to the most enjoyment and they will get the most out of the game (imho).
---
Amen to that.. I dunno who looked worse in this post 
---
They should just publish a fucking list. But they cant do that as people might notice they didnt actually ban 3k bots/trash.
---
next time you go to highsec gank a venture for my sake
---
ICY has been placing new Azbels every week as they get destroyed. 
---
This is disgusting. They log in 20 accounts with one click, activate input broadcasting and gank it before concord even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
They weren't gloating, they gave credit to the rats and said he died like an idiot, which he did lol. 
---
You can activate your missiles while you are lining up your FVB - that way you do damage

Nice wooden wrist rest

---
ASDFG = Prop/Tackle stuff on the medium slot row
---
YXCVB = Guns/highslot stuff on the high slot row
---
for shortcuts and with shift to overheat. 
---
Smallscale PvP habit.
---
So which in-game function will CCP break after adding this?
---
3k down, 17k to go
---
Yes please, because slaves and exotic dancers won't load themselves
---
This, pretty much.
---
Offering them content as a tribute doesn't actually make them fuck off or offer good fights in return. It just hastens their desire to assert further dominance. Honestly you are best off just moving to another region where the fights are of a more suitable size for your group. Playing into the hands of groups that feed on the relatively defenceless is a complete waste of time and energy and only ends up burning out pilots who otherwise might have stuck around.
---
You'll know Eve is dead when there is nobody left to bitch about how it's dead.
---
I think buying out all exotic dancers and selling at a monopoly is the next great wealth maker. 
---
12 years, absolutely incredible. Great video and a best wishes in 2019 to your entire alliance.
---
Yes, I got this message, too. But if they were a Test vassal, they wouldn't lend their banner to enemies, would they?
---
It's also quite surprising, that they are attacked by skill urself one week later. I'm happy that I don't have to understand these politics...
---
I figured as much but I reckon thats why he was calling you a liar. Ps. Tell yer corp m8 thats was some fine salt.
---
Didn't know that. Thanks for the tip! I will have to start putting it to use.
---
Your reply reminded me of actors when they talk about being typecast as something or someone and how hard it is to escape. Just a random thought I had.
---
I'm pretty sure the bonus is capped at 100% though. I tested using just the the P-75 and having P-50+P-75 ticking and the standings gains were identical. 
---
Your post need more blur 
---
Combat looting. Hated by almost every Corp but easy to do
---
The easy victims have all either quit or become experienced and this generation of fortnite lootbox gamers will never play eve. Nice because less stupid/young people playing but shitty because you can't take advantage of them anymore

how are carriers "supposed to do" a thing nothing in this game has ever done

Superior fit. With the mid slots empty you save alot of weight and can go really fast.   /s
---
Plex Vault slowed that part down, folks get dumb from time to time still. You dont need to rely on auto-pilot ignorance to get the loot you describe. Easy enough to scan active piloted haulers as they align to warp, to gank you just need to add a point and get them on the in gates. Lately ive been going straight to the source, the Jita docking point. Perimeter and a few other gates all land on the same point and about 1/3 of the active traffic lands just out of docking range. Sometimes you have time to scan and decide whether to gank. It is more of a scooping alt war on this spot but its slightly less crowded than the undock.
---
&gt; Most importantly, if you see botting and RMT happening – REPORT IT. Even if you think something may be a minor offense, report it.
---
I petitioned someone who admitted via in-game chat to using a botting macro, over 30 days ago.  My petition remains "open" and has no response from CCP.

I will be carful.

Shut up nerd! Give me your lunch money!

Yes. I would imagine you are right about now lol!

I don't know anything about WOW and I don't think there's any should or shouldn't to it. A lot of people, I suspect most, wouldn't hang around in a game where they were destined to be forever gimped by their starting date.

Multiple starving Leshak that slowly regenerate their armor because of RR capabilities. You have something with a battleship tank, a neut that will set a ship capacitor to 0 each 20 seconds and you only have cruiser DPS to break them.
---
And you can have six of them in one spawn.
---
According to this spreadsheet : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RonD1IKLsWnnU8IQ26ykPCTJ3R_BprOL_xvv6VYevQE/edit#gid=0
---
The neuts have a range of 50km (optimal = falloff) and reap 600GJ per cycle. It's impossible for a cruiser to hold against those
---
what leads you to believe there is over fishing occurring? i see so many get away per ganked in Jita. There are folks flying all over hell in the hot spots in highsec, doing a large variety of activities. lowsec is a different story, might be a bit over fished, but not totally (yet).
---
Adding more bots makes them more visible, and more likely to be caught. And since we can pretty much assume there will never be 0 bots in eve, focusing on making them less effective lowers their impact.
---
Is this salt day ? It's like the 3r salt thread we have today
---
Phoenix coming back is the real headline!
---
&gt; We'll see which side gets tired of it first.
---
It's about is it worth it to keep the fight. For TEST they are making income and for ICY it is about making income so he can pay Horde. So how much is either of them making and is there profit on it.
---
It's so you have a spare midslot to fit a cyno when PGL asks you to, obviously.
---
Months ago
---
Nice!
---
Wait what?  They banned the old account, not the new?  Like banned, banned, not just locked out to protect assets from the thief?
---
That makes no sense.  That's punishing the player they think was hacked.  It would make far more sense to ban the beneficiary of the "hack". And TBF, what you were doing **does** look a lot like what hackers do now, log in and immediately drain as much SP as they can.
---
Every day is salt day!!
---
Yet still no opt-in to prevent skill point draining.
---
Thats why it's a feature suggestion 
---
It adds a dramatic effect. I like it when people are passionate when they communicate.   
---
It's better than being 90's smug/chill all the time. 
---
The going rate most of the time is about 1 million isk per jump per billion collateral. For the time it takes and the risk you’re putting up to be ganked no I don’t think it’s very good isk in a freighter. 
---
If you are doing super high collateral but low volume runs then maybe but then you need to have billions on hand at all time for collateral. So now you’re hurting your potential earning from other isk making activities as a large chunk of wealth is reserved just for covering collateral. 
---
Um this looks like an npc killing loki. The only thing he should have issues with is players.

Not getting a reply is what is ridiculous, they did ban you I'm sure as a protective measure.  Extracting that much SP after not logging in for 2-3 years is a huge red flag.  Big bummer they haven't responded because I'm sure it could be settled soon after.

---
mar5hy was visible. Still not banned. Its not about "visibility". Its about if the player has protection.
---
They dont even ban bots that have been reported for months by tons of players.
---
CCP appear to want their friends to bot. So the really visible cases (to the community) are totally ignored. Instead we get another round of bans of chinese RMT bots that primarily hurt CCP. Notice how they dont publish a list of banned bots. There is a reason for that.
---
Can you call Snuffed Out low sec cancer if low sec is dead?

Looks like SC has about 150 active members. Super numbers are probably shit now too considering most probably left for NC, PL or even BBC.

Fighting over low sec is akin to fighting over a muddy field. Seems like it's easier just to go farm under the CFC, PanFam or Legacy umbrella.

Ok how about needing to equip a highslot module in order to facilitate this. This module then disables your ability to use combat fighters.
---
You are then relegated use only support fighters and support modules (commmand bursts anyone?) and being a taxi / mobile depot... 
---
What?
---
what's this protection you speak of 
---
&gt; many of us make our isk in other ways

....looting dread wrecks

I'd swap the drone bay of the Eos and the Strat. The Strat has a bigger dronebay than most BS hulls, which is bullshit.

This one I think about 20 or 30 minutes? I didn't have much of my break left when I started it
---
It's not that it's exceptionally hard. It's mostly that the most isk-positive ways of PVP are pretty boring. To me at least.
---
I've done gatecamping with eyes in the adjacent systems. Or station camping in Jita against wardecced corps. Both of those were "profitable" and there's very little risk of losing ships as long as you're careful.

But idk, I like roaming more.

I remember being on comms when this happened, we all laughed at him and went back to talking about if Hillary Clinton had ever done anal.

The guys you killed arent the nullsec dwellers you think they are, they live in stain and provide most of the fights in the region. 
---
I hope to god this post is ironic.
---
I dont get why a simple bait plan deserves its own reddit thread.
---
The loot thieves there are on point. Gnosis and industrials. They pick up loot unbelievably fast. I can't compete with that.
---
I totally agree with you there.
---
When you have an account give it to me and I double it! 
---
I agree, but there is the historic precedent.
---
It was an item that could be stolen. It added that extra bit of danger to an already very dangerous place.
---
Maybe they should reward the skin to those that correctly report a certain number of bots then.
---
I mean yes but it's got huge bonuses for it and probably has a high rack of literally nothing else. Like, that's its entire job.
---
You could probably do it with another curse or maybe an Ashimmu (though, you wouldn't have damage in the Ash) but otherwise I don't think there's another cruiser capable of that. It's probably futile.
---
Rather than beat it at its own game, I think the best approach is to hit its weakness harder than it can hit yours--namely, it's got 5 fat drones that dont do a whole lot of damage. Either passive permatank it, or defang the Curse.
---
If you can burst down all its drones, you can keep hitting it to harass it to death (especially if buffer fit) or possibly ransom it if you can't break it because that's a stalemate--it has no way of killing you outside its drones.

Remember when CCP told us Alpha clones wouldn't lead to a massive increase in botting and then Alpha clones lead to a massive increase in botting?

I don’t think anyone has ever said we aren’t part of Panfam. And I don’t know where you get the idea that PL is NC’s pet, I’ve literally never heard that before. They both seem to do their own thing and always stay blue. 
---
Meanwhile, TAPI can’t seem to not talk about how they are independent from goons, how goons are just third partying in Gem, and how they only allied in the big war last summer because they had no choice, not because they were bluetral the whole time

This here is a great example of a lazy F1 pusher. 
---
* burns to bridge without prop mod
---
* FC is freaking out about everyone jumping the gate ASAP, yet he burns to the gate without prop mod, meanwhile spamming jump like it's gonna make him get there sooner
---
* FC calls for tracking disruption on the fighters, ignores him for a solid 30 seconds
---
* fails to put guns on target for a solid 30 seconds
---
* ignores command to OH
---
* "The Hel is not associated with Goonswarm."
---
I remember this comment coming up a long while ago. Copy/pasting my idea from then:
---
What if bounties were on a tiered system for intel available? Only the bounty hunter could see this intel.
---
Such as
---
    &gt;250m isk bounty shows when they're online.
---
    &gt;500m isk shows their current region at all times
---
    &gt;1b shows their current ship and if they're undocked or not
---
    &gt;2b shows which constellation theyre in 
---
    etc.
---
Lore wise, the more your bounty is, the more infamous you are, the more people talk about you, the more bounty agents hear, making it easier to find someone. But the hunted would also know this and could await the hunters, making it more interesting.
---
Also, the bounties would have to pair hunters with targets that have similar play times. e.g. 0600-1200 hunters paired up with 0400-0900 bounties so you don't get TZ tanked. Or perhaps you have a small list of targets that shows speculated activity time and you get to choose which targets to pick.

That was defense though, not a campaign

Misses the first bridge (doesn't use AB to get in range in time), afks after bridging waiting to jump the gate for some reason, waits 1 minute on grid before using ewar on fighters. For a video that in the description makes a point of indicating "[... they] don't spend a lot of time in nullsec" the pilot sure is a typical nullsec fleet F1-monkey.
---
Just day no to drugs Stainguy, holy moly.

Those guys have the best gatecamps Ive seen. Normally dodging a couple sabres with a Helios is trivial unless I get distracted by something, but I got into one of their camps and left in structure. Sabres decloaking as you initiate warp, instalock tackle on the other side, etc. Running around the entrance to catch is usually pretty interesting thanks to them.

Personally, when I was ratting in nulsec, I used a Thanatos.  I liked having slightly sturdier fighters over slightly faster ones.  Keep in mind that I warp-in at 100km, and immediately align out, so my fighters have to MWD the distance, and it was never an issue.
---
A Hel is a a lot faster to clear a site, but unless you want to rat for a career to show a profit, and bear the higher risk (I hope you have a good standing fleet) ... I only do stuff in-game I enjoy, and I don't enjoy continuous ratting.

10k player alliance lmao. Goonswarm alone has 34730 members. And yes they have many bots.
---
I don't think it's an unreasonable request for that to be added to the API, however. NPCs killed is a very specific metric, it seems only fair that miners should have a specific metric, eg. m3 mined in the last hour, showing what they're doing as well. Otherwise it feels like the game is slightly favoring the security of miners over ratters.

that would break my brain

You're just mad I'm right.  You feel entitled to OP ships because your account is so old, and cant stand getting beat by newer accounts with more isk to risk.  Only way for you to keep your edge is to keep your SP advantage.

Pandemic Horde is a great place for new/casual players. We have no requirements to initially join, free ships and skillbooks so you can be on the front lines minutes after getting set up. We have around-the-clock content so there is always something going on when you log in.

Brave Newbies, Karmafleet, Eve Uni and Brand Newbros are also solid options I have no problem recommending but I don't have any experience of myself.

I have played for about a year now, and use no spreadsheets, and still make plenty of isk without too much effort. 
---
However, there are some areas of the game that require spreadsheets. If you want to go heavily into reactions/industry/trading, you will massively benefit from spreadsheets. But only a small percent of players actually do those, because most people also dislike dealing with spreadsheets to play internet spaceships
---
There is no external pressure to evolve because of no relevant bans. The dumbest bots that worked 10 years ago would likely work today with small modifications.

When I was still playing, and I wish I had a PC to play again I loved mining, if I lost a mining ship, I would then take my other ship and leave the system, not try to mine in the same system. I know the pains of losing a hulk, but why risk two?

You might want to randomize the name and actual join time, so that botters couldn't use it as a data-point to reverse engineer which bots got banned when.

People don’t owe you anything, they are just players and nobody is responsible for anything as long as he doesn’t get paid for doing it. Just stop being dumb, make more ccplease posts because ccp actually gets money from customers and is responsible for the service they are marketing. It’s not the duty of an alliance ceo to police and it’s no player responsibility to do it. 
---
Yeah they sure make it tough. I find if I'm and careful+lucky i can loot just barely outside their range. also if they arent approaching to maintain position give em a bump. Lastly, I often find times of the day when there are few other looters around. Im great at scouting and ganking the target, i kind of suck at scooping, but I managed to scoop 4 of my last 5 ganks on the dock point.

I think letting alphas fly gilas was possibly a mistake (though one I'm happy to take advantage of on my alt accounts). And is there something we can do to prevent alphas from VNI rat botting? Alpha status should be to try out the game and see if you want to commit to it, to have some small scale fun or to play casually; alphas shouldn't be able to print ISK in large volumes.
---
Regarding 2FA and account security: yes, turn on 2FA. But can we please have a switch to prevent extraction of skills on a character too.

All trading in Eve, with a few exceptions, is one player selling or buying from another. 
---
So, when you try to sell an item, you have two choices. You can always list it for a price you choose and wait for another person to come along and buy it. But often people will undercut your price by .01 isk, and if you aren’t in a major hub it’s unlikely you will have anyone coming along looking to buy some random module. 
---
The other option is to sell it to a buy order someone has placed. However, these buy orders are usually well below the sell order price, and outside of major trade hubs they are usually either non existent or so low you might as well give the item away. 
---
The fair value of an item is usually determined by its price in Jita, since that is the biggest trade hub. You can use sites like evemarketer to check the Jita sell and buy price of any item remotely 
---
#DUDE we get it you're a bitter bag of dicks STFU ALREADY!!!
---
Wouldn't that defeat the entire point? I mean, if I report a bot and see it end up in "botheim" that is gonna be a good thing as it shows reporting bots has function, if you scramble the name, it becomes meaningless.
---
This is not 'absolutely ridiculous'. What you've done - send a password reset, use it to log in, drain all the SP, send them to a brand new account - is exactly what many instances of account stealing look like.
---
They should have acknowledged your ticket I guess, but it will take a while for them to find any proof that that isn't what happened.
---
Kek
---
Right, because they are not rmting and botting RIGHT NOW. In their space. The process of banning them takes time. So while CCP employees do their best on that front the 1% of the player base that actually have any influence over it are doing nothing about it while the dirty isk is being used for alliance stuff. That on it's own renders the entire alliance worthless. And since when is rent not considered a pay?
---
There are not that many actual players as many have more than 1 account but I'm willing to go with you on it.
---
So, following your logic, you just need to show evidence that 17365 players are botting. Or you look like an idiot who makes random claims without any actual evidence.
---
No, banning the account makes sense - if you think an account's compromised, you don't want to let the bad guy keep using it, do you?
---
They should ban both sides of the trade while they investigate, actually.
---
Karmafleet is great too. The biggest mistake you can make is to play by yourself. If any of these corps don't seem to fit, try out another. It's ok to go around a little bit and find a place that fits you
---
Also check out /r/evejobs
---
they hated the goon because he spoke the truth
---
So the result is the same. CCP allows players to "buy" protection. "T20" never stopped, it just evolved into passive protection.
---
And they are trying to placate the community by banning a bunch of irrelevant chinese trash bots that can be recreated instantly. Talk about useless "security".
---
Speaking as a new player, capitals feel like the only class of ship where such a pre-flight check ought be SOP though.
---
No, because James wouldn't dare go out into nullsec where the vast majority of botting happens.
---
How's it render the entire alliance worthless? It's not like we have, or will ever have, your respect. That shit got thrown out before we even entered the room.

tbf most people puts "gf" in local after killing anything in any way, be it 1v1 pirate frigs or 3 supers and a titan dropping on a t1 cruiser hard tackled by a t3c.

The Upvote count on this matches the current population of lowsec \\o/

It’s also what a lot of legitimate use cases look like, ie my specific example. The ridiculous portion is not answering legitimate player concerns in a timely fashion and throwing a permanent ban on my account that has been in good standing for quite literally a decade.
---
Also, lost in this is the giant chunk of change I paid in real money to purchase the skill extractors. Most account hackers aren’t looking to subsequently invest hundreds of real dollars to aid their hack.

So I've got a question. I know you say inject an alt; however, if I injected an alt it would be on the same account as my Sub cap PVP pilot so I find this dumb. If you have reason that it wouldnt ne dumb on the same account I would love to know. I only play with 2 accounts. I have plans on my 2nd account to have a Fax alt. I'm actually Skilling into this right now with that account. 
---
Pretty much. In capitals you tend to carry fuel, fighters, booster charges, refits, etc. All for different occations.
---
I most often change between 2 loadouts; pvp and incursions. Unfortunately both don't fit in the holds at once and it kills me 
---
They can move jump clones that are not being used; everyone can install a clone, you jump to x place and drop them in a new citadel for example, and then everyone has a jump clone there; you can't actually travel with it.

There's a difference between hand-holding and reducing tedium.

Its just pure tedium to double check that the ship is loaded with it, and frankly suspension-of-disbelief breaking to think capsuleers would not automate such menial tasks in a world of warp drives and automatic consciousness transfers.

I'll second r/evejobs as a place to look. You'll get a lot of recommendations to join one of the big "newbie" corps. If you want to go that way, I won't stop you. Just be aware that there are plenty of smaller newbie-friendly corps out there.
---
You're talking about TEST... I'm sure a lot of us tried to drag the cyno to a mid slot just for the lulz
---
Interesting, didnt know that
---
The problem with trying to track how much FW LP is worth is that it depends a lot on the speed in which it can be farmed. When Gallente wad its index down around 1, the price of VNIs went way up because it took more time to get the LP. Conversely, now that the Gallente index is much higher it becomes much easier to get LP. So the isk/LP varies greatly depending on the possible LP/hour.
---
At most I'll do one cycle of a proc mod when I head to the bridge not to bump it.  I'd rather miss the first bridge then bump it for others and it really depends on my range.  I also don't want to go through the bridge hot.  It's not a lot more mass, but when you're bridging 100 bombers and I'm not paying for the fuel... ;)
---
I was within 5000m.  Right after a bridge my first priority is situational awareness, we don't always know exactly what we're jumping into.  Jump range is something like 1000m?  Proc mod could have bought me a few seconds it's true.  I just spam whenever I jump (be it gate, wormhole, bridge), it doesn't do any harm.
---
Again, right after I take the gate in a polarized bomber my first priority is to align out and assess the situation. I can't damage from a pod, so taking a few seconds to check my range, look at what's around me and align out goes a long way to staying alive longer to get more damage on the Hel.
---
True: I don't always overheat right away.
---
I do apologize for my ignorance on the Goonswarm part, I don't know a lot about Alliance politics.
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
Shut up serene 
---
then people will speculate that it is an auto response that comes every 24-72 hours to make it appear as if work is being done
---
Confirmed. All the rorquals.
---
I still get a bit nervous when I line up for my FB run.  I'll try to remember to get those torpedoes launching sooner.
---
My bad... :(
---
probably, but I felt the need to confront my own inconsistencies. If no one listens or gives a shit that's fine, at least I can say I addressed it.
---
The only carrier I don't currently have in my hangar is Caldari. I'm constantly getting the fuel wrong. :'(
---
Kismeteer, I still have the character named Bat, https://evewho.com/pilot/Bat  that I would trade for an AT ship. What a perfect character for Bat Country.
---
Classic story of INIT babysitting snuff again against the smallgang alliances. Snuff are just pets.
---
One form of cancer gets baited by another. It's unclear who to oppose more here.
---
Thats what NER said. Why add anything else?
---
Tri and ra let themselves be evicted by skillu without dropping a single cap but somehow they are feeding them on the daily up north, me mad.
---
Lol, I don't care if he joins the other noob friendly corps, I just want him to continue playing. It does take longer now to join than when I first starting playing, late summer 2016. I think the main part of joining is getting to know the recruiters and going on some fleets with them. Not nearly at quick as joining horde, but you're getting guidance and learning how to play. I don't know the recruiting channel off the top of my head (sorry recruitment guys), but it can't hurt to talk.
---
I disagree about delve being a poor place for a new player though. If you aren't rorqual mining or super ratting, it's a really safe place. Lots of opportunity to make money, plenty of fleets going out, and SIGS when you learn what you like and want to go deeper into it.
---
There isn't any better or worse place to be, they're all different and tailor to different people.
---
(upvoted you btw, spread some love in 2019)
---
Holy crap nobody has ever done this before in the history of eve
---
Why does it sound like the FC is whispering .. I damn near   blew up a speaker trying to turn up the volume to hear what he was saying.
---
Kismeteer, I still have the character named Bat, https://evewho.com/pilot/Bat that I would trade for an AT ship. What a perfect character for Bat Country.
---
So basically despite horde saying the perimeter makes no isk, they find it worth it to keep fighting for it?
---
Thanks a lot! I think I'll be using the guide from EVE University then: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSIn8g-K3-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSIn8g-K3-Y)
---
Jesus, who is even left in PL?
---
Multiboxer mission runner? Maybe
---
It's harder to bump blops than you think unless you're in a plated t3c overheating mwd or something. 1mn purifier certainly won't bump it 
---
This is a really cool idea. It reminds me of locator agents though, so I'd want to think about the implications of someone placing a bounty just for the intel.
---
I've reiterated it like 10 times that I'm not apart of you guys or have a vested interest at all with your corp. No one listens.
---
Ochre first, little bee, ochre first.
---
Thanks! I'm going to use the E-Uni guide then that I linked in this thread. 
---
Well i tend to believe test in this. PH kept saying there is no money to be made in HS. Where as test said that they make tons. 
---
Are there no taxes in Nullsec or is it just generally lower or something?
---
I didn't know they were, I could re-post this in another topic if it shouldn't be here.
---
are you in spartan vanguard by any chance?
---
Was fun fight, we died, I look forward to dying again :)
---
15 is a good number
---
more proof the cta post is pointless
---
Because a 3 (PVP fit) v 1 (PVE fit) fight is so fair. LMAO
---
Supers? In my CALSF? It's more likely than you think!
---
Snuff is NOT part of the imperium you should move then over to the 3rd party category... 
---
To be fair...No one has ever accused Tri of being smart
---
Sorry, didn't know my respect was one of your life goals. And the respect can be earned back, it's not something that happens over night but it can happen in the long run.
---
good video bad piloting.

i used to have a lot of respect for avrse, shame they chose the easy way for snuff.

have this upvote, my son

Wow grab geddons and smart bombs and pop the lot.  🤣

Tbh you guys all sound equally retarded.

It mirrors his personality.

What if you're a bot too? O.o
---
Dale is the only Super in CALSF.
---
Good thing these boosters were limited supply
---
How would something that's objectively impossible to achieve be a life goal? The ship has sailed. We can never earn yours, nor anyone's respect, ever. Why should we even try?
---
Btw welcome to Eve!
---
yeah but then you know autists would mass report everyone and hope that they reach the minimum limit required. 
---
It won't let you sell immediately when there is no matching buy order for the price you set, in your location. Players list the buy orders and they tend to do so in trade hubs so their inventory will be consolidated.  
---
Your options are to set up a non-immediate buy order (eg. 90 days) and wait for someone to notice and buy your item in the future, or to transport the item to a trade hub for immediate sale. 
---
The main trade hubs are:  
---
Jita 4-4 CNAP (Caldari, The Forge, #1 hub)  
---
Amarr 8 EFA (Amarrian, Domain, #2 hub)  
---
Dodixie 9-20 FNAP (Gallente, Sinq Liason)  
---
Rens 6-8 BTT (Minmatar, Heimatar)  
---
Hek 8-12 BCF (Minmatar, Metropolis)
---
It's true - that's the safe way to do it. However, not the quick way. The quick way would be to prop mod on, and either align slightly off the BLOPS so you pass by it, or set orbit 500m. That way there is no risk of bumpage, and you get in on the action sooner, which in cases like these is pretty important. 
---
People get angry when they make mistakes?

Haha so much salt and so many ego ! It has hurted him :D
---
I've only went full nos, but now looking back, atleast a single neut would have been more helpful in dispatching kity frigs, than multiple noses. With a neut You instantly kill the cap of a frig, as soon as you click the module, so no mwd. With a nos the cap warfare effect only applies at the end of the mod cycle, so only after 10 secs, which is ussualy enough for a frig to overheat prop and burn out of Your webs max range.
---
You would have to rat less in a nid than a thanny though..
---
Oh nice an EVE Valkyrie ship! Oh wait...
---
Awesome work btw

Nice AAR

I \*highly\* recommend not touching those characters. If you want to learn from the ground up again, start a new account and learn from the ground up with isk as well as sp. Then in a month or two when you decide you really want an alt, you have one ready and waiting for you.

it still wont stop the spamming4skins though. i like the idea but i just know it will get abused to fuck for that nyx police skin.

Ok i didnt know they took into account after insurance and also the loot.

So yeah for t1 it s shit. But on pod it s not bad :D
---
kiki do you love me
---
2004 legacy code plagues even the bottters, it seems. 
---
I mean most people who have invested ten years into the game like I have are able to do a plethora of things at a high level. I mean god forbid a newer player has to focus their training at doing one thing at a high level. 
---
Why should instant gratification be rewarded when vets had to change attributes to optimally train for their Dreadnaught after training the basic support skills? What is good about a player not learning the basics of character building? I just don’t understand how injectors are a positive other than financial windfall 
---
Yeah maybe so, but in the eight or so years I've played LoL, there's been a very noticeable decrease in toxic behavior since the Tribunal became a thing. I guess I correlate the two, but that's just my personal experience
---
At this point I am wondering if I am actually a bot.

Should try and corner the market on Apocolypse and make isk off the bots.

There's probably something about that in the MOTD of the channel.

but wally how will i capture the vni before he warps off?

I thought Init = goons though
---
Automoderator has detected a blacklisted url posted. If it's Gyazo or Screenshot.sc use imgur.com instead. If you feel this is wrong feel free to message the moderators
---
Ah, that's interesting. Not very useful as a assault method then. More of a logistics thing I guess
---
Yes, let's divert resources away from logistics in order to create a unit with the thankless job of kicking other alliance members based on the *suspicion* that they're botting. Because there's no way our enemies will infiltrate that or find other ways to game the mechanism to weaken the alliance. 
---
Slyce = Goons ? *tinfoil hat*

double captcha

Surprised pikachu

Yeah I tried to do that and couldn't figure it out. Maybe I'll try again

you spelled honor wrong but also neat!

Lol mining.

better solution, remove anoms and let everyone just get 50M isk every 20 minutes.

But you have to mine them in the right order to get it, otherwise it's a boson

imagine if alphas couldn't use faction ships
---
thanks dude
---
i'm just at work watching the discord bot so maybe you should type one up instead
---
You're less likely to get hit with a long captcha if you are currently logged into a google account which is heavily used. So leave YouTube vids in the background 24/7 and hope to God you hit him on the first try.
---
i guess even the br tool forgot they existed
---
You forgot the tinfoil hat. Here you go. *passes a tinfoil hat*
---
Botting renters with legit chat logs of them blatantly talking about botting should be kicked or at least reported by the alliance. As a line member nobody was interested in anything I was saying about the botters who joined Slyce renters even tho I have those chat logs. The little guy can't do much in that scenario while the alliance leader is opposed to it and threatens him.

Blatant shit should be reported, but by individual people rather than a formal alliance mechanism. Once you open that door as an alliance function is a sliding slope that will 100% be used to hit you by your enemies.

I am sorry my dude
---
I suck :(
---
Dear OP, 
---
the reason for the change you observed are many nerfs to ganking and only a few minor buffs.   
---
1) the scanres nerf: before the 'fleet boost change in november of some years ago', there was an option to boost the efficiency of resebos slightly. those few % don't sound much but since eve works in ticks of 1 second(in terms of cargoscan results and so on), you were able to get your result in lets say 2,94s (so 3s) instead of 3,02s(s 4s). 
---
2) the autodock bug: implemented when they changed grid size and classified as an unfixed bug since then. before that patch, ships were landing between 1 and 2500 off the station by random. the chances for that were equally, so p(distance\_to\_station): p(0)==p(1)==...==p(2500). after their grid size patch, ships now land in a bubble around the 0 spot, this changes the formula to: {p(0)=0,5, p(1)==p(2)==...==p(2500). since you were able to only gank shuttles who land at least 2000 off (or had totally crappy stats), the amount of potential targets has decreased by 50%.
---
this even applies when you right click the station in your overview and press 'dock', you don't even have to have a bookmark of the station do be able to 'autodock'.
---
3) citadels: due to the implementation of 0% tax citadels, many traders who often trade plex/skill injectors/skill extractors prefer to do it at citadels because they hope of cutting off the tax. the problem with citadels is, that, due to tethering, ships docking and undocking are completely ungankable. this forces you to take on those haulers at gates and you already know that ganking cloak+MWD ships (especially since you can activate the MWD after you activated the cloak) is pretty difficult. 
---
4) you already named the plex vault but in my opinion, considering the positions of all gankers, the vault is only a minor one
---
5) 10s invu when exiting warp and doing nothing. before ccp changed this game mechanic, people leaving the warp would be lockable immediately. now they got 10s invu unless they take an action. this basically gives them the opportunity (within those 10s) to cut off another 1s of your time to shoot them. same applies to people using an instadock and not docking fast enough. 
---

---
I didn't mean it as in it being something official done by the alliance. I meant it as in the leader not being oppressive about it and only threatening to kick their own line members if they don't stop talking about it since it shows the inability of leadership skills. 
---
Wow I'll try that ty I didn't know
---
That would make sense. I haven't been a rookie in quite a while.
---
I went and checked on an alt and this is the text:

---
I don't think there is a human at the controls. I killed his MTU while it was right next to the Orca and he never pulled it in.
---
What a bunch of idiots dropping dreads on supers, who does that still?
---
Was this before or after the mineral count change 
---
Theres no Empire tax like in hisec, the only tax is the one set by the poco owner, and they are generally lower than in hisec.
---
There's still more than a few
---
True, but if you got randomly selected with targets, you couldn't reliably get intel from bounties. If you put bounties on an FC for example, the kill contract could go to some random high sec person with no care for intel on fleets.
---
I agree though. Without proper testing and balance, it could be a broken free/cheap intel tool. 
---
Would be cool if you could use a spy rorq and jump pilots into a hostile structure
---
Poor Mr.Tyrell. He even asked community for advice how to do the invasion properly and failed miserably...
---
The fuck are you talking about?
---
Oh, this is a serious post.
---
bleep bloop
---
Wait you moved to horde?
---
It's not especially profitable unless you are willing to take risks like hauling high-collateral or high volume (due to ganking), or hauling outside of highsec (no police protection). There is a lot of competition for the low-risk contracts which drives down rates. For freighters, risks increase when you have to fit cargo expanders or carry more than a few billion at once.
---
Yeah this is a regular meet we have been doing for a little over a year now. 
---
We meet up once a month usually on the 3rd Saturday of the month. Hope you can make it to a meet sometime.
---
Can someone please ELI5 why it's not possible for everyone that has a problem with Snuff to just coordinate and attack all their citadels at the same time?
---
Further than that: why is it not possible to attack *every* citadel of a big enemy at the same time. Why is it that citadel bashing has become this fight of all the space penises on the biggest citadel at the same time, rather than spreading out and attacking everything at once?
---
Bless him.  
---
Still clinging to the skynet dream.
---
That is a huge legal thing, iirc.
---
Probably something to do with libel/slander.
---
Awesome, hope you’re able to stop by.
---
legacy code
---
He's dead, you're not. You've just fulfilled the first rule of law enforcement. Be sure when the fight's over you go home alive.
---
Nice!! Glad you can make it.
---
Anything the player could check, CCP could trivially check for across all accounts. If they have to verify it was a bot anyways, this is entirely redundant and they would just be doing their job to begin with.
---
Not to mention that you have now given people a massive incentive to falsely report people.
---
In the age of automation, a universal basic income is essential in this economy.
---
Then they should stop spouting off with the line "there's better ways to do it than combat anoms, those suck." Because after a while it just starts to smack of "i don't like combat anoms they are bad so you should stop doing them."
---
Do you still have the Rakapas cartel discord?  Has the TTS/@everyone pings been disabled yet?
---
They are ex-TRI so seems fair game.
---
solid fit 
---
Pre-alpha/early alpha is not exactly a late stage of development tho. If the game was in beta then I'd agree, but it only just entered alpha in Nov. While scrapping big design elements in alpha is a setback, its def not a death sentence on its own. Most of the stuff that they already spent lots of time on (the character models, animations, the game engine in general, etc.) are still reusable.
---
are approaching fully automatic luxury gay space communism?
---
The only alliance I'm talking about atm who lost my respect is Slyce. Not the individual members. The leadership. The entire thing behind RiotRick doing everything he wants while Soho White pays for it. Soho White himself whoever he is.

Not "grrr gewns". I actually respect the entity Goons have become along the years even with all the hate they got and are still getting.

That explains all the isk that I pay to live in lowsec in Rakapas

You mean that in order to build wealth I’d have to figure how to get ISK from other *people* and not just mindlessly/programmatically shoot red icons?

Now you're on the trolley!

what? no, every 20 minutes your wallet flashes and you get 50M isk. solves botting forever.

OOS boys are very sad that there """secret""" income stream is now being disrupted for the first time in years, now their precious LP exchange rate can't be used to RMT their rent payments.

Lol, wat?

\#illuminaticonfirmed
---
cuz ur posts are fucking garbage this one is further proof of that
---
Libel and slander require the statement to be false, if they've banned x characters from the game because of botting it's not a false statement, even if they weren't botting - they were banned, and ccp had reason to believe they were doing x
---
Apparently the services didn't have the passwords hashed 
---
Temp locking it yeah, but the objective should be to restore the account to its actual owner.  That can't be done if you actually ban the account.
---
Phone CODE. They have ganked them repeatedly with great success. Seems like CCP doesn't care.
---
just app. p3ak is about good apps, not vouches. 
---
TEST wouldn't do this.  TEST maybe a casual alliance but they wouldn't pull mittani level of dirtbaggedness.
---
Tldr
---
no u (whoever you are) 
---
Not gonna lie, that's pretty neat.
---
Zigs5Today at 4:11 PM
---
all good lmao
---
happens
---
Hes not mad B)
---
It's just toon names. It's also true that they were botting, so any kind of legal issue seems unlikely. Otherwise zkb might be illegal and not just horrible for the game.
---
What ever reason they have, it's incredibly convenient as it makes it basically impossible to verify their claims.
---
TEST as an alliance didn't do this. Some nerds who have access to services, their Digi equivalent, did this. 
---
I see, makes sense
---
nah but we had a discord thats existed a longtime before that
---
lmfao
---
I assume you’d want to get rid of bounties as part of that?
---
Haha alright right on! 
---
1. Incentivised reporting means more folk will send half-assed reports on spec, purely because if it turns out to be a bot it's free loot. Grossly inflating the report queue with mediocre reports will make it take longer to get to the genuine reports, thus take longer to get the evidence required to ban said real bots, thus more damage done to the economy whilst they remain active.
---
2. Someone running a bot farm who knows they're about to go down can just hop in on reporting them from a clean account. Gets them something back as well as turn attention away from themselves on the clean account. Thus, profit for the botters &amp; their associates.
---
3. Players will be more inclined to stalk bots to report them and let them continue until CCP step in (since that'll contribute to the 'pot' they get to share in as a reporting reward), rather than hunting them and trying to mess up their farming like they do now. Again, more harm done to the economy as botters get to perform unhindered until banned.
---
4. Could provide a new form of RMT, as the botters can sell 'evidence' of their burnt bots for cash, and the buyer can report using this and get reward loot/isk direct from CCP freshly laundered.
---
Realistically, the incentive to report bots should be the ability to play the game without an economy ruined by botting. It's its own reward.
---
Oh I'm sure, we were just reminiscing about how awful that server was yesterday.
---
Or an in between, not being able to insure them and only getting the base uninsured amount
---
I'm not sure. CCP Falcon has stated that the server software is single-threaded. I'm don't know if this is due to the server software being nearly 20 years old, or if there is some constraint due to the how the game processes actions.
---
If you ask CCP, they'll probably tell you that it's down to current tech not being able to handle the load. I wonder if it would be possible if the load was distributed across multiple cores and CPUs.
---
only from green anoms. escalations, mission rewards, etc. are fair game but if youre killing those rats then u dont get the UBI.
---
Because your karma is shit.. post in other subs to get it up  a bit
---
I sold 13 mil lp about 2 months ago for at least 2k per lp if not more. 
---
It would need a complete overhaul of the code.
---
But I think players would not be happy with such big fights without tidi. You would have so much less time to react to enemy actions.
---
what is going on ?!
---
w/e this comment was, it was a fail.
---
not play eve
---
Hope you can make it down sometime. 
---
The average meet has 6 to 8 people show up. We’ve had as many as a dozen and as few as 5. 
---
How different this game would be if things ran smoothly. As much as Id love to be involved in one of these huge battles, the idea of having to sit around for hours is very unappealing 
---
Not sure what that is. Im in PL.
---
They wouldn’t have gloated if he had just said gf and moved on.
---
So you're whoring for upvotes.
---
Yes, not knowing the finer details behind zkill makes me either ignorant or dumb
---
I’d prefer that escalation and mission rewards be only in items, not ISK. It’d then be up to the player to sell those items for whatever ISK value the market deemed appropriate. 
---
Wtf I hate Snuff now.  
---
Btw, gate campers can eat shit to a hot drop any time as far as I'm concerned.

Yeah...it’s almost like that would require a little skill beyond finding that F1 button. 
---
sure, either way is fine. just get rid of green anoms.
---
sad
---
Oh yeah, new skins!
---
tell that to my apostle
---
the problem isn't that dreads are useless its that fax are super strong
---
Its common knowledge, and yes, its retarded to read stats without knowing what those stats actually say 
---
confirmed, am not mad
---
wtb new thanny tho
---
I think that's the sentiment for a lot of players. The *idea* of a 2000 vs 2000 battle is interesting, but in reality it's fucking awful. 
---
I got close to being in one a few months ago. Fortunately, my carrier was close to the edge of a warp disruption bubble, and I just drifted over there and jumped out. The process of "drifting over there and jumping out" took me over an hour.
---

---
Do yourself a favor and don't. At least over-hyped fights over a static objective/timer.  
---
It has reached a point where the only ships that matter are Titans trading Doomsday's. And even if the fight started right after daily reset, there is a limit on how many titties would die in max time dilation before the next downtime.  
---
The flashform escalations (at least the first hour or so) or bait operations are much more fun than the TiDi slugfests.
---
How is this possible? I thought CCP just nerfed them after carefully thinking about it for 2 years...
---
So you must be Holly Lee Evingod. Idk why you'd edit your name out of the convo and then post the km....

Cheap vexor or oracle and afk it while your sleep... Or contact the owners and offer to buy it.

FC hits fleet warp. Meanwhile in Iceland, server lights on fire.
---
It's actually what made me want to play in the first place. Remember reading about a huge battle that took place over the course of 24 hours. Hundreds of billions, if not trillions of ISK lost. It sounded chaotically beautiful and then you actually read into it.. completely different story. It's a real shame
---
The grand return of the casino. I for one luv it.
---
Batphones until you outnumber your enemy 2 to 1 with about a dread per person in their fleet.

I fight for Gallente in Faction Warfare. I was transporting items from Dodixie with my Iteron Mark V and got killed by an enemy Caldari. Is there any way to safely fly out of areas with lots of people with an industrial?
---
I think that's what drew in a lot of players. Honestly, wars between two smaller, similarly sized groups are way more fun. The problem is that those don't happen too often either. Most times one side calls in help, so the other side does too. It ends up being "let's see who can batphone more dudes".
---
Fortunately, when it does happen, both sides usually have a blast for a few months. It's *that* kind of conflict that keeps me playing, not ones that are half the galaxy vs the other half.
---
My post made me sound like a fairly new player, I guess 2 years isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things. Not been to one yet and don't plan it. Was on a YouTube clickfest and ended up on a few of the older battles. reminded me why I don't bother getting involved 
---
If positive reinforcement works even if tied to nothing in reality, it's still working.
---
&gt; horrible for the game
---
ok guy
---
2019 - PL brings a Stuka fleet and INIT brings Titans/Supers. 
---
What a time to be alive. 
---
We were literally just talking about this in corp chat the other night. 
---
I've been a krab for the last year or so which I regret. Spending a few more days making some isk then liquidating the dirty rorqs and other shite and funding a PVP character. Looking forward to blowing shit up
---
Delayed local covert cyno hunting class chip.

CCP keeps their profits and sub counts from botting.

It's not horribad for human players in the age of ultra safe null and capital umbrellas.

lmao are you for real? 
---
Ah sorry yes thought you were brand new :P
---
Where is your Titan/Super deployed? 
---
My own fault, poorly worded post
---
Uh i believe you mean amazing?
---
Wasn't you gonna app to FETID in snuff 🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Lmao what salt? None of its salt lol. Its hilarious seeing all of this bragging over a failed project lmfao
---
It was amazing because of how much a shitshow it was so yes
---
Huh the br shows a dead snuff erebus but its actually a mobile bubble??
---
That's very true but I'm not sure if that would make it less enjoyable. If you look at the KB of that battle earlier this week (TEST/Goons vs North), most of the ~800b destroyed was in like half an hour. If you listen to the belonging soundcloud someone recorded you can actually hear the fight start and end within like 15  minutes.  
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30002435/201901161000/
---
I think the general consensus is that TiDi in itself is not a bad thing. I think the playerbase APPRECIATES the fact we can get 4-6k people in a single place duking it out. What other game can handle that? And there are benefits to the TiDi for decision making and fleet coordination. Max Tidi sucks, but is bearable - IF IT WORKS.  
---
I think the main issue with these large fights is the disconnects, the modules not cycling etc. Hell I've even had the server tell me I don't have certain skills trained...like wtf.  
---
There would have to be a massive shift in the way the fleets are coordinated if fights of that size were fought in actual real time.
---
So much spin I feel dizzy!
---
apparently im in your alliance too vOv
---
The best is when you drag+drop fuel over the bay without looking at it, have just enough of the right fuel to jump in, and then the rest of the fuel you topped it off with is wrong so you can't jump out.  
---
Giggity? 
---
Not sure I 100% agree on locking Level 4s and 5s behind an omega paywall. The whole point to increasing alpha skil ceiling was to provide them a way to join mainline fleet doctrines and also to unlock a higher tier income. Yes some shitlers are abusing the mechanic but that seems like you need to increase your abilities in policing shit. If someone is running distribution missions 20+ hours a day its 99.99% likely its a bot. Frankly seems like its something fairly simple to police in the grand scheme of things.      
---
I also really like the idea of moving bots to a corp that is visible when they get permabanned. 
---
You never mentioned Slyce, so how could I possibly know it was who you were talking about?
---
Just did this myself and you are absolutely right. 
---
How are you going to sue CCP for "libel" or "slander" when you violated the game's terms?  Is this Texas Law we're talking about?
---
it's not like you can efficiently distribute a giant list when each step *MUST* be resolved before the next task is started 
---
Init is a strong independ... Oh, nevermind. 
---
I too am in the largest bloc. Don't join fleets with a certain few FCs and your life expectancy skyrockets.
---
Please - CCP isn't going to do a guilt by association, EVER.  They don't even ban the guilty.  You think they're going after the alliance heads? 
---
Imagine if 2 faction ships weren't the default PvE ship in eve :|
---
Definitely a botter, I've killed the same setup before. Will head that way, thanks for letting me know.

no that was yonis lol. init had a fleet out at the time too
---
We really do not care, just want things right! And you do not have any proofs of rmt, so your words is just a cry of little girl. And we (oos) learn about this thing form your brah PH, so actually PH said this info to us)
---
I got it, and I laughed.  
---
camping PL cap fleet for weeks while they whined on this sub was pretty fun
---
Fuck Snuff. Fuck CFC. Fuck Mittani. Heil new WWB
---
I never mentioned respect either. Or shit talked any alliance in particular beside slyce which I've been a part of for over 3 years. 
---
The final blow for PL..
---
i like how there is no denial of rmt, just denial of proof
---
Just a few off the top of my head:
---
1. **The battle of 4-CM8I**
---
Back in late 2015, the home station of Phoebe Freeport Republic (PFR) was under siege by two groups I forget the name of. They typically formed the same numbers as us, but usually had better ships. This was a kind of "last stand" for PFR, and we formed harder than I'd ever seen before. When we usually struggled to form over 50 dudes for strat ops, we formed 161 dudes.
---
Long story short, we won the fight, but took a beating to do it. One of my most memorable fleets.
---
2. **Dropping the Vey keepstar with Escalating Entropy**
---
One friday night in December 2016, Escalating Entropy (CHAOS) dropped a keepstar in Vey. But in order to do this, they had to avoid having their freighter ganked by snuffed out, who had high-level spies in CHAOS. Our glorious leader, Punchbug, ragepinged for every character that could light a cyno.
---
We all lit cynos at the same time in different places in the system. Snuff quickly figured out which was was correct, but by the time they destroyed the freighter, they realized it was a decoy, and the real freighter had escaped and dropped the keepstar. [This gif](https://gfycat.com/spotlesssorrowfulkakarikis) pretty much sums it up.
---
3. **Fighting MWM coalition with Centipede Caliphate**
---
I'm going to gloss over a huge amount of information, because this was an entire campaign, but I joined up with some old friends from my PFR days, in CENTI, to fight MWM in tenerifis in early 2018.
---
CENTI regularly fought outnumbered but punched well above their weight. It was challenging, difficult, but a whole lot of fun. In the end, CENTI (80ish characters), defeated MWM (3000+ characters). MWM's main alliance, TBC, Widotted into Test under the corporation "Right click jump to". I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other alliances.
---
[An accurate summary of the campaign](https://giant.gfycat.com/RemorsefulYawningEmperorpenguin.webm)
---
Bang Caligula
---
The Athanor BPO + accompanying Moon Drill, Reactors, etc.
---
The gist of the problem that prevents this is that the major process that decides where things are in game and where they happen is a single threaded process running on a "node" that applies to a single system.
---
So there are two inhibitors: first, the process has to go through every moving object in the system, one by one, decide how and where it's moving and what impact that might have on every other object in the system. It does that one-by-one. Second, there can only be one server associated with the activity in a given system. The workload can't be shared among multiple servers.
---
To make things worse, under normal circumstances, the single servers that make up each of EVE's nodes -- under normal circumstances -- host multiple systems per server. So if you don't warn CCP in advance that a big fight is coming, it is entirely possible that the system where you're having your big fight will be shared with another system where another big fight is happening. And this can be completely random: you can be moving a big fleet through space during a big battle half-way across the galaxy and suddenly your fleet movement gets slowed down by that battle.
---
CCP offers the capability to warn them that a big fight is coming. When this form is filled out, they make sure your big fight's system has a server to itself. But there's two problems. First, if you and your enemy bring 6000 people into that one system, there's not going to be much that single server can do. Second, certain groups in EVE take a perverse pleasure in *not* reporting big fights to CCP in advance so that they can win the fight by deliberately overloading the server.
---
You say they don't care. But these are most likely alpha accounts. Following the money trail can do more to find the real users behind the bots.
---
it'd pretty much kill the game
---
Cloak+MWD trick. Practise it. It won't always work but I use to haul stuff from/to Jita with my DST. 
---
why is four not spelled for?
---
You only cared enough to make a post complaining about it. And as for RMT, you aren't fooling anyone with your denial. Its an open "secret" what you do with all your LP cash, no need to deflect so much.
---
*Implying its not already a viable method :/*
---
&gt;i like how there is no denial of rmt, just denial of proof
---
I can imagine you eating shit every day, but it still need a proof, because i can imagine anything)  Sophism ))
---
It would mean the 5000 raging neckbeard no lifers that have to civilian railgun everything in sight to get on kill mails would stop playing.
---
I'm in Horde, so don't have one.

Hey, people want more passive isk income no ? Better than passive moon mining take my upvote

also a [save module slot location] [load module slot location] buttons
---
I know the typical answer is "fuck those no life neckbeard autists who whore on every kill and jerk off to their k/d" but they're very important just as a reference for everyone else involved in pvp at any level
---
even just as a link to show people what was involved in a fight, or to look at fits, things like that. it's not all stathumping

---
If you're going to repost it, you should at least change the title.
---
Are you kidding? This game's popularity would blow up if we could have those giant battles with no tidi and disconnects. It's exactly what this game needs with all the rorquals pooping out caps like it's nobody's business. People would be much more likely to engage if they knew the other side didn't have hours to gather allies from their bite of the blue donut. 
---
What isk?
---
That's just a titan bridge with 1 Lightyear extra range for 1/10th of the cost.

It was during fountain, idk how you guys are now but back then all people cared for was krabbing

Branch, Omist and Fey landlords, take care. o/
---
Before someone posts BoT, they actively purge people on other players reports even before CCP has acted on it 
---
I don't recall any whining tbh. But I do remember Legacy lookin' like idiots for all the smugging they did before PL moonwalked out and gave you guys the middle finger.
---
But only 1million m3 of ships can go along... Not exactly a titan bridge
---
&gt;I just buy some titans, supers, caps, characters and else, and what brilliant bl do with thier isk?)
---
Dunno, you are so poor, seems legit now)
---
Favourite activity would be Exploration, I love it. Taking a ship into wormhole space and emerging possibly weeks later with a cargo filled with loot. Been an explorer for over 2 years now. 
---
My most memorable moment and my favourite moment by far, was when I was but a 1 year or so old newbro (back in 2011) went and stole an Orca from some hisec miner, poor fellow was using it as a cargo can by ejecting a Hulk to mine in while the Orca stayed there floating. Being rather poor i was missing the last skill to fly an Orca, 45minute train iirc. I grabbed the fastest ship i could find and rushed over to the trade hub, picked the last skill which costed me half of my wallet and started training. 45 minutes I stared at this Orca pilot praying that they would stay until the skill completes, mining alongside them and moving closer slowly in my Covetor. Finally the time had come and the skill popped, I hit board and there I was, in his Orca. In panic and not knowing exactly what to do, I left my covetor out in the field and just spammed Warp. I arrived at the station with my heart pounding and realized I had just stolen a ship worth 5 times my total wealth at the time. I called this ship 'Hijack' and it still is to this day, in my hangar and sees regular use. 
---
In pvp, one could argue, yes.
---
Not actually possible with current tech.
---
Think of it this way, 2000 ships are in combat. Server has to track their position and vector once per second. It has to track their module activations (and related stats). Then add damage applied checks and health applied checks (logi and targets). Then you add drones and fighters - all entities requiring the same checks. The commands to lock targets and de-lock them. Updates to your overview as stuff pops into grid. Then throw in the AOE calculations from bombing runs and smartbombs.
---
Time Dilation is how we can actually have these battles without people crashing or having a server farm in London set its entire neighborhood ablaze
---
Why is "mouth breather" supposed to be so offensive anyways? I often breath through my mouth when working out, or when I have a bad cold and my nose gets congested. I bet if he questioned their sexual orientation in local he would have got to them!
---
BL doesn't do missions, we are able to photosynthesize our isk
---
Is it even possible to split that single threaded check of every action among different threads? No because the math all has to be done in order, right?
---
So the problem is "the code was made this way 20 years ago" as well as "there's no other way to do it without fundamentally changing game mechanics", correct?  
---
Yeah I was referring to general empire Capital Lineup fielding.
---
Minmatar and Gallente got great Capital ships, all of their inherent Dreadnoughts, Carrier, Supercarrier and Titans see use.
---
If you're a new player and think about wich capital to use you usually choose between those factions.  
---
Armortanks can't be neuted to shit since their resistances are passive, but they got less ehp than shieldtanks usually.  
---
Caldari got no good ship, ironically Phoenix is like the best capital in their lineup because you can use them with Rapid Torpedolaunchers, those subcaptial normal Torpedos not XL.
---
Their Carrier got no bonus besides tank resistances, and will get alpha'd of the field in a Capitalfight anyways if he gets primary.
---
Caldari Supercarrier is bricktank as fuck, you get it to like 96mil ehp with SM-706 /  SP-906 implant and Genolution set, problem is if you neut him out he dropps to about 20mil or something so there is that, you can gamble with navy capbooster 800s or 400s so your Invuls won't go offline since Pith A-Type, Pith X-Type and Capbooster got the same cycle time. *^(But good luck with that haha.)*
---
But in all seriousness fuck the Leviathan, you pay 80bil ISK for a slightly less shitty Phoenix with kinetic doomsday strap-on, I'd prefer the giant Amarr Assplug anytime for sure.  
---
Titans like Minmatar *"Tracknarog"* are a nightmare for subcapital fleets if you armortank him and cram his midslots full with tracking, you oneshot Svipuls and other shit.  
---
Leviathan needs to shoot Torpedos with don't apply at all to anything under battlecruisers and can be speedtanked easily. 
---
Look at what smallgangs or solo roamers bring into null:   
---
T3 Cruisers, Heavy Assault Cruisers, Bombers, Assault Frig, Interceptor / Interdictor and T3 Destroyer.  
---
*^(But good luck tracking those with Torpedos haha.)*   
---
All of them got some oversized AB fits or a bonus to MWD signature.  
---
I calculated some damage profile for your usual [Frigates and Destroyers](https://i.imgur.com/uaVoYY6.png) (Wolf - Svipul - Purifier) and boy oh boy you dont hit for shit. In other empire Dreads or Titans you would blapp them or dipp them with few shots into structure.  
---
If you stack Caldari Titans and Dreads in your capital umbrella you might as well don't have one at all, ask TEST Alliance why in their shield capital Doktrin they only field Ragnaroks.  
---
Empires like Minmatar or Gallente got really usefull Turrets and great Boni to Fighters, making them the best to krab with.  
---
Amarr got huge tanks wich can't be neuted and really versetile Ranges, can swap instantly and keep firing.  
---
Not for long #csmLeaks
---
I’ve upvoted you for upvoting him. 
---
We could run whole 6000vs6000 man fleets with low to no TIDI, If the code was built to handle it. It would require maybe 10-20 devs working full time for 1-2 years.
---
I would say they should try and open source some of the code base and let players help. In my corporation alone we are 8-9 people who are in the field of computer science. I've personally worked with both distributed systems and hyper scale parallel applications. And the difference between good and bad in this can be 90 % boost in performance per function. As if you say everything is being checked versus every object. If distance is above (distance-speed) skip check if objects are effecting each other. And do the next calculation. 
---
Click on the titan loss, get a deployable bubble loss. Hmmmm...

TAPI wanted to show Papa Goonie they were a strong independent Alliance and proceeded to meatgrind in to the PanFam super fleet before Vily cucked PGL and called off the "Invasion".  
---
Snuff "left" the Imperium and just third parties Init/Goon operations, never shooting Imperium mind you.  
---
Imperium staged a pretty amazing eviction, for which little Goon line members took credit for on Reddit. HK sort of went meh.

GoTG is still shit but utilizes a strong TZ tank.

Advanced Black Legion Hologram technology
---
quite often...
---
yep also true 
---
Sadly, this is one of the drawbacks you have to accept when enlisting for a faction militia :/
---
As a member of the Gallente militia, players enlisted in the Amarr and Caldari ones will have a free pass to shoot you without fearing any form of response from CONCORD. And if you stay idle for too long around the stargates inside your enemy space, local police forces (**NOT CONCORD**) will try to take you down. For as long as you are in the Gallente militia, you should try to avoid travels to Jita in big slow ships, such as Industrialist, or use a nimbler ship that can get past potentiel threats and reach the station untouched.
---
This does not mean you will be forced to harvest your materials to produce your own stuff. People tend to forget that, but Jita isn't the only trade hub in the cluster ! The main one for Gallente space is Dodixie, you should find whatever you're looking for there, even if the prices are slightly higher than Jita.
---
BR has done that as long as I can remember. The titan pilot launches a bubble and when it dies, it shows as a dead "titan".
---
Snuff is back to snuffing out low sec.
---
Test tried to burn Geminate but instead they burned 260 dreads in 30 minutes instead and then decided they needed to take a step back. They are also facing a SkillU super deployment back home now.
---
HK got evicted but they are still doing stuff.
---
PL isnt actually dead
---
Geminate was heating up and it was fun 24/7 but it seems like that will die off unless xenuria lives up to his rhetoric and burns Geminate and horde because some guy blocked him on discord...but that guy is too busy worrying about how good his shoes look to really do anything.
---
Oh. Well okay then. Good luck
---
hey, PL is totally alive in Geminate and forming regular Jackdaw fleets to large-gang on anyone that moves.
---
Where do you mine and rat? Asking for a friend.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
i think it would be bad overall. sure, the lack of evidence for stupidty/shitfits will encourage pvp but i doubt it would be significant since the main reason people pussy out is the ship loss itself, not the lossmail. as far as i can tell at least. the recruitment process would probably suffer the most since zkill is a pretty clear indicator of one's activity level/type. not talking isk efficiency or other shallow metrics but stuff like "can this guy fit a standard nano cruiser" "does he undock to shoot stuff once a month" or "does he lose the same dumb fit in the same dumb way 5 times a week" kind of thing. and yea, big fleet fights would probably be a nightmare to account for, except the one sided stomps. idk, taking people's e-peen out of video games generally isn't a good idea.
---
&gt; I'm not sure. CCP Falcon has stated that the server software is single-threaded. I'm don't know if this is due to the server software being nearly 20 years old, or if there is some constraint due to the how the game processes actions.
---
I think it's because of how the game *has to* process actions. Here's a [comment from another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7shyp7/ccp_falcon_explains_how_eve_online_nodes_work/dt55189/) from a few months ago explaining why the server code is (mostly) single threaded.
---
While we're perceiving TiDi as evidence of EvE being behind the times and their software being old and creaky (not that that's not true) it's still the only game that offers these kinds of large multiplayer battles at all so far as I know. The largest battles you see in almost all other games would be small(er) battles in eve that are happening all the time, don't cause TiDi and aren't talked about much.
---
Where do you get that info? The vast majority of the playerbase lives in high sec, like 90% of characters. I would wager the vast majority of bots live there too. 
---
nobody respects slyce anyways
---
confirmed, BL is dead for good o7o7o7. RIP.
---
Can't jump with fatigue... You're welcome
---
And do what? Spin your pod and shit talk local?
---
Wait... that's not a bad idea.
---
That comment is a really good description of why it's not really possible to use multithreaded server software. I don't really know that much about it, so I'm kind of guessing at it.
---
Tnt was burning horde refineries for shits and giggles 
---
I'm not sure what Curse fits people use in abyssal sites, so I just reappropriated a very blingy, dual rep DED hunter fit I had laying around. It's fit for cap recharge rather than a cap booster. In this case, your neuts don't even hurt it, as it has about +50GJ/s cap delta with everything running, and the Gila can only put about 25GJ/s of additional pressure on it. 
---
As for neuting power, my Curse is fit with 5 small neuts, same as your Gila, but the Curse gets a 100% bonus to neut effectiveness, which means it drains about twice as much (91.5GJ/s before resistances). 
---
There was this one time that I had bought hulk bpc for 1 milloin isk. A couple year had passed and I was looking up my contracts. I was scared shitles that I had bought hulk bpo for 1 milloin isk and I couldn't find it anywhere. CCP support was nice to HELP meontgis subject. 
---
Lemme be clear with you : if you take this against a Curse, you better be prepared for the three billions ISK lossmail. Why, you may ask ? Because with everything running, and with Navy Cap Booster 200 loaded, you have 1m10s of capacitor life. A single bonused neut from a ship like the Curse, and your tank is gone.
---
In fact, I'm not even sure you'll go through the three abyssal rooms with this fit, as a single neuting spawn is your doom...
---
Really, Gila might not be the best ship to take on the Proving Grounds. Keep away from the PVP gate, and reap the rewards of the normal abyssal sites while waiting for better ships to jump in. If you hate the Curse so much, why not try to become one ? You'll learn their weakness quickly, or develop and affinity toward them.
---
Ah damn guess I can't out neut it. I suppose I'll have to defang it as fast as possible.
---
Great minds think alike 
---
Good idea. Unfortunately, I focus trained gila on this account and all my injectors are being put towards super caps. I guess I'll stick to regular abyssals.
---
They are nice shoes though.
---
Lol blows me away that the dude raging managed to seem like less of an asshole in this thread than you’re being
---
Good choice. If you want to sit in a supercapital, you shouldn't throw ISK out of the window, but rather stockpile it to afford the ship of your dreams =)
---
(also if you have too much ISK think of me !)
---
winner should get your badass coat
---
Contract to Mikhail O'Gara. How much would you sell them for????
---
iama lso rarted
---
Thx,

Who blues who when push comes to shove?
---
TAPI and Goons blue one another still if shit escalated, Id imagine?

I recall feeling extremely secure in Horde when I first joined 2 yrs ago due to NC/PL super umbrella but now it feels like Horde the alliance has grown up extremely well itself re: super proliferation(I can for the first time fly carriers and fax and will remain horde, for example).  I realize NC is Panfam as is PL but wondering if the political situation were to freeze as is today, and 2 or 3 coalitions were to team up, what would the teams looks like?
---
in what world lol 
---
Vexor BPO.  I used to sell 10 run BPCs via contract links dropped in Dodixie local. Folks would pay 20M a pop.  Dunno, maybe they thought it was a BPO
---
I really don't get the rage behind this type of game play tbh. Yeah it's sort of shitty to drop your carrier on a frigate, but I've seen lots of great videos from the likes of Chessur, Xtra squishy, and Bjorne that seem to roll with the punches just fine. Kite out kill fighters (that's a kill mail) , fuck off if it gets to hot. 
---
[Brave Newbies](https://youtu.be/hcmXaQZoAeY)
---
Obviously it was someone looking for Dad
---
Alright, thanks =)
---
Basically, if I want a tanking carrier I should aim for an Archon or an Aeon. And for krabbing, Nyx and Hel (with their younger brothers) ^^.
---
A ship that I really like, both in its design and utility is the Revelation. Could be interesting to use it for moar memes in PVE, or to try out solo dread PVP, like Lasker Emanuel do (I think you know who he is, but just in case : he have a YouTube channel where he post great videos of his roams).
---
Concerning the Leviathan, why can't it use Rapid Torpedo Launcher like the Phoenix ? Even more, won't the Caldari titan have "better damage" if this can be called like that with RTL, since the bonuses per ship skill level are higher when compared to a Phoenix, even with the Siege module ?
---
I still have a long road ahead of me before even having the hull of a capital ship in my hands. Still have to train for Paladin, then Interdictors... And with what you said, I will certainly not spend an entire year (and more) training for something that will cost me as much as a fitted Leviathan for rocks !
---
Made me actually laugh out loud.  Thanks.
---
I'd suggest using courier contracts to move you stuff to your staging system, saves you the risk. It's usually around 1mil per jump per billion isk collateral. Make sure to set the collateral high enough you don't lose out if they fail it.

---
I fucking hate Captcha, it's cancer of the worst kind.
---
Oh no, no, nooo, that simply will not suffice. We shall demand full satisfaction in a duel to the death (of every titan on both sides in a glorious brawl) in a system of our choosing at the time of their choosing! En guarde!
---
What the "achievement get" alternative be here? 
---
but if bots had no way around it, I could force myself to live with it.
---
you dont remember any of the "CCPlease save my shiiiiiip!?"
---
...and we smugged after **winning**   
---
I am still a bit new to the game, can someone explain what exactly happened and what mechanics were in play here that caused the rage on the losing party's behalf?
---
Would help if you linked the post this was related too.  
---
Not sure why people are shitting on you for an apology after critically evaluating the position of your last post that was, to the say the least, a bit hypocritical.  
---
Kudos to you for post IMO.
---
DOPE
---
If PL leadership didnt suck so much, we would still be top dog.
---
The easiest way while still doing your own hauling is to create another character (you have 3 slots) and have them not join the Gallente Militia.  You could still be ganked, but the Caldari Militia won't be able to attack your alt freely.
---
Use "Item exchange" contracts, set to "private", to transfer items back and forth between the characters.
---
\&gt; I'm not sure how that Caldari guy managed to make his way to Gallente trade hub without being killed
---
The NPC police take a little bit to appear when the Caldari guy enters the system.  If he warps fast enough, they will not catch him.
---
Ahem. From the L4X br at least tickle is also deployed. 
---
Things that stand out is getting brave and bovrls sov in catch was so cool as a newbro.
---
Seeing N3 go from half of all sov to just nothing.
---
Getting my dread and trying to bash a station to flip it but nc. sneaked it after everyone left.
---
WWB and just seeing cfc crumble
---
Reminds me of that: https://youtu.be/fsF7enQY8uI

Upvotes, kill mails, members... there isn't much that Recky doesn't whore on
---
True but it was a week not weeks tho. And tapi should have been able to hold but everyone got pinged a hunder times a day no one showed up on the actuall jail break until it was too late.
---
It could have been so much more funny
---
Tri killed a Snuff titan then. BRs do not lie.

Check out the eve portal app, cause this is the sole thing I use it for

CCP, I found a fix to botting, it is so obvious it blew my mind.

Don’t allow it, make it a violation to the EULA.

God you guys are so dumb ... “/“ would indicate both options combined .. it’s like you’re stuck on this reee loop to be “oh oh oh I know the answer to this” which is demonstrated by you all saying the same thing in reply .. as if the first comment wasn’t clear.. but I guess original thoughts don’t come by often with you clowns so I would guess you enjoy the rare moments where you can share 😝

Plus it was sarcasm to begin with .. fuck it’s like being in the movie idiocracy and you guys are the  dumbshits “but but but it’s what plants crave??”

PL/NC/Horde/Frat

GoTG is sort of friendly with NC, not friendly with Horde and PL. When all the chips are on the table who knows where Sort will land. Wouldn't be surprised if it was whoever he thinks will leave his alliance alone when the dust settles.
---
Major outliers would be SkillU and Tri...maybe not even Tri I think they are faislcascading.

I follow the Russians too closely.

when push comes to shove.
---
Panfam blue, though hte balance of power inside panfam is shifting to horde.
---
Test and goons blue, though test is diminishing, becoming more and more reliant on goons to do anything
---
GOTG only blue if they find some more faction forts to sell.
---
Ooooh, yaasssss. That's perfect, thanks!
---
Monopoly much? The tears! LOL
---
There are plenty of null sec and low sec organizations. 
---
Also, I don't think "it takes effort to keep those going" is a valid counter-point. More players in those groups means that things would in reality be spread out as those players become experienced. 
---
Also, I am unsure how the CO2 corp joining Goonswarm will affect things. 
---
PH owns all the highsec markets. PL owns all the Providence faction forts. HK owns the first Keepstar built. CO2 owns lots of sov and isk. Tri owns Skillu. NC owns the title of most undocks in a 24 hour period. Gotg just paid off Sorts house mortgage. BL have solid leadership and hot drop 24/7. MC aquired all the merc corps under one umbrella and are as strong as ever. Goons are dead. Test and Brave are Fraternity pets.
---
Is someone unloading 10+ Arks? Hmm.
---
The problem is the freedom of the game. No matter what you do for a change, it will eventually go back to how it is. You change the balance, big groups adapt and we get what we have now.
---
The problem is that dreads can't be repped. It's an archaic mechanic that needs to go.
---
Or someone who just hates captchas, good God they are in every login, I don't need that in a game.
---
Probably.  Killboards are a great source  of   intel, as such they can be used for threat determination and   to figure out what your enemy likes to fly. Without them  forward intel would be a lot harder 
---
Hello Friend.
---
Please take recruitment posts to /r/evejobs
---
That subreddit is actively lurked by recruiters from all necks of the woods and is specifically designed for this sort of thing.
---
the 4s are a giveaway as to exactly what's happening here.
---
that's not a hill to die on.
---
or we could, y'know, fix the broken shit first?
---
I think it just inherently feels excessive so people have this visceral response of being wronged, much like you can boil a frog slowly but if you drop it in boiling water it'll come out immediately. A slow burn feels less bad even if it's the same result. 
---
Okay, yeah I just signed up, this is literally *EXACTLY* what I was looking for! 
---
&gt; I recall feeling extremely secure in Horde when I first joined 2 yrs ago due to NC/PL super umbrella but now it feels like Horde the alliance has grown up extremely well itself re: super proliferatio
---
In the dread whelp,  PH and NC had pretty much the same amount of supers and a titans on field,  PL had about half the amount of a either.
---
PH guys were eager to be the bait, PH is starting to get kinda scarey
---
I appears you are mistaken :)
---
I'm happy with the skill point loss, so the unanimous part of your statement in the OP is incorrect.
---
thanny, ooof...
---
Killed pilot's negative security status (likely due to podding) warrants NPC faction's disdain and thus navy ships around a hisec-lowsec gate helped the gatecampers with added DPS and webs.  Getting nailed down by gatecampers isn't fun, but getting pinned at the same time by NPC ships is always unfun.
---
Considering how much intel is gathered from killboards/killmails it would dramatically alter the PvP side of the game
---
For sure I understand the motives behind the attitude, I'm just saying maybe it's the wrong one to have in a game where the amount of trolls you can pull off is nearly limitless. You'd think after 15 years people would stop expecting everyone to provide "honorable 1v1"game play. 
---
Yes!!!! Nice grab dude, i bed you got hella shakes. I honey get worse shakes from thefts than i do from fights
---
Terrible idea: make system sec dynamic. The more you rat the higher the system security is until concord move in. When activity dro-s sec status drops with it so the balance between null, low and hi security space isn’t fixed but constantly shifting based on player activity. It would break everything horribly i’m sure.
---
If it comes down to it, the Russians will likely side with Goons/TAPI. 
---
Let's be honest here, dropping in a cap is no less honorable than farming killmails in a SB BS on a lowsec gate, but those nerds don't see half the salt null sec cap pilots do. 
---
They didn't do shit, it was a micro nerf
---
Seems like I'm making more ISK in a cheaper ship in T2s ^^
---
Autism in a can.

Eve Portal on Android. CCPs product...

I'll never understand hisec, the time to return on that investment is stupid. 
---
I recommend solo'ing T1 fleet ones, they're quite easy and if you get lucky, you'll get some nice drops.
---
I'm not involved. Posting for others enjoyment.. 
---
Can confirm am a whore. 
---
idgi
---
I really enjoy killboards for the sake of inspiration when it comes to ship fittings and fleet compositions. It comes in handy for intel to have a better chance of knowing who/what you're going up against.
---
I by no means have a "good" killboard, I don't care about losing ships. And the sooner you let go of killboard stats, the game becomes exponentially more fun. Dont get me wrong, look back at your engagements and see where you can improve.
---
Upgraded to marshals when they came out.

He forgot to say "in game"

Is eveovermine still around?

I want to say yes but am unsure. I've run close to 300 Tier1 frigate sites and have yet to see 1.

Why would you want to? It only lasts 15 seconds, and then it goes into cooldown.

Yeah, this is me. Sorry, just unloading some ancient supply. Once those are gone, I'm out, so don't panic.

That's actually a badass solo logi fit. I'm gonna have to try this sometime.

Yeah, shame it died this way but that’s what makes good fights all that sweeter at least.

Riot rick is a dumb piece of crap. Goons have always supported voters and looked the other way for years. And have always said "it's not our job" blah blah blah. They are ruining the game for tax and rental income.

Probably just an alpha mining bot. Apoc&gt;venture
---
What protection does Mar5hy have then? 
---
Hey that showed up on my recommendations today
---
Agreed - isn't Red Alliance crashing on TAPI's couch? XIX might side with PanFam but they also have pretty good relations with Goons so ya probably neutral.
---
Why would he be banned, unless he's input broadcast in a combat environment? 
---
Yeah, it's been really interesting watching you guys grow up

Maelstrom blueprint I think was the first one I actively saved up for. generally though if I can't afford to casually buy a bpo, then i'll just go with copies until I can.
